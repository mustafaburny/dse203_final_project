Everyone\u2019s quoting the CNN article that makes it sound as though the WFP director was claiming all you\u2019d need is $6 billion to solve all hunger. When the actual statement he made was that it would help to fix the growth in world hunger issues we\u2019ve seen recently, not that it would solve hunger entirely. He very specifically mentions that this is a one time donation that would help 42 million people that need immediate aid, but that wouldn\u2019t be a long term fix. Even the CNN article itself now has a correction at the very bottom acknowledging this was a misleading title. \n\nObviously this is all an over simplification of the issue and you can\u2019t just throw money at it to fix it, but the point he was trying to make wasn\u2019t that one donation from one billionaire would permanently solve all hunger but that a one time donation from MULTIPLE of the world\u2019s wealthiest individuals would help save a lot of people in the short term. I think that\u2019s a pretty massive difference.",

My odds of it happening increase on every pump giving the fact the next stock Tesla would overcome is actually Amazon, then Google. This is not a small market cap stock with unlimited upside, it's running out of room in my opinion. Although it is possible for Tesla to temporarily surpass these companies because of how irrational the market is. (True valuation clearly doesn't matter here) the point here is, its current price may be fair for Tesla but in the future. Not now, the bulls got too greedy too soon.  The argument that Tesla is should not be worth more than companies like Amazon and Google is strong, of course, those companies will grow in value as well where things fall back into a reasonable line.  But, it goes back to square one, too high, too fast, too soon. None of the bull's arguments defend Tesla during a harsh red week or month in the market, worse a crash. We all know based on history Tesla would be the first to go.   \n\n\nDon't get me wrong. I strongly believe Tesla deserves a high valuation. I am all for a $1 Trillion even upwards of a $3 trillion market cap, but all with given time. Too fast, too high, too soon. The cult-like following on Tesla is built of money craving impatient newbs, which a good amount of run away at first sight of a change or new hype. Panic, profit takers. During that time, when it comes, id like to have my turn in making a profit. I rather bet on a dip with such high numbers than bet on an even further run. Then again, even if it goes up we go back to square one, I increase my odds averaging up.  This is a shorter-term strategy, not a Perma bear case.",

Everybody that matters in the market knows what it is, and they all knew it was going to pass the house. Remember, it had strong support by both parties in the senate months ago when it was passed. People have mentioned buying related ETFs (I.e PAVE) and construction companies (like CAT) for that entire time for this reason. Basically, it\u2019s priced in.\n\n2. Besides allowing for news,  speculation and possibly improved forward guidance (all priced in imo) this bill isn\u2019t going to make these companies more valuable overnight. It will take a long time for them to get these projects/money, and even longer for them to report their financial improvements from this, which does have an impact on stock prices. Even then, this is probably priced in.\n\nI hesitate to say this is 100% priced in right now because there are probably retail traders buying in, but the term \u201csell the news\u201d exists for a reason. In general, retail traders tend to buy the top and sell at the bottom, and this event will (probably not) be an exception.",

Everyone\u2019s quoting the CNN article that makes it sound as though the WFP director was claiming all you\u2019d need is $6 billion to solve all hunger. When the actual statement he made was that it would help to fix the growth in world hunger issues we\u2019ve seen recently, not that it would solve hunger entirely. He very specifically mentions that this is a one time donation that would help 42 million people that need immediate aid, but that wouldn\u2019t be a long term fix. Even the CNN article itself now has a correction at the very bottom acknowledging this was a misleading title. \n\nObviously this is all an over simplification of the issue and you can\u2019t just throw money at it to fix it, but the point he was trying to make wasn\u2019t that one donation from one billionaire would permanently solve all hunger but that a one time donation from MULTIPLE of the world\u2019s wealthiest individuals would help save a lot of people in the short term. I think that\u2019s a pretty massive difference.",

My odds of it happening increase on every pump giving the fact the next stock Tesla would overcome is actually Amazon, then Google. This is not a small market cap stock with unlimited upside, it's running out of room in my opinion. Although it is possible for Tesla to temporarily surpass these companies because of how irrational the market is. (True valuation clearly doesn't matter here) the point here is, its current price may be fair for Tesla but in the future. Not now, the bulls got too greedy too soon.  The argument that Tesla is should not be worth more than companies like Amazon and Google is strong, of course, those companies will grow in value as well where things fall back into a reasonable line.  But, it goes back to square one, too high, too fast, too soon. None of the bull's arguments defend Tesla during a harsh red week or month in the market, worse a crash. We all know based on history Tesla would be the first to go.   \n\n\nDon't get me wrong. I strongly believe Tesla deserves a high valuation. I am all for a $1 Trillion even upwards of a $3 trillion market cap, but all with given time. Too fast, too high, too soon. The cult-like following on Tesla is built of money craving impatient newbs, which a good amount of run away at first sight of a change or new hype. Panic, profit takers. During that time, when it comes, id like to have my turn in making a profit. I rather bet on a dip with such high numbers than bet on an even further run. Then again, even if it goes up we go back to square one, I increase my odds averaging up.  This is a shorter-term strategy, not a Perma bear case.",

Everybody that matters in the market knows what it is, and they all knew it was going to pass the house. Remember, it had strong support by both parties in the senate months ago when it was passed. People have mentioned buying related ETFs (I.e PAVE) and construction companies (like CAT) for that entire time for this reason. Basically, it\u2019s priced in.\n\n2. Besides allowing for news,  speculation and possibly improved forward guidance (all priced in imo) this bill isn\u2019t going to make these companies more valuable overnight. It will take a long time for them to get these projects/money, and even longer for them to report their financial improvements from this, which does have an impact on stock prices. Even then, this is probably priced in.\n\nI hesitate to say this is 100% priced in right now because there are probably retail traders buying in, but the term \u201csell the news\u201d exists for a reason. In general, retail traders tend to buy the top and sell at the bottom, and this event will (probably not) be an exception.",

They will get hit by a shortage in chips to produce their cars. The prices of chips will also shoot up so high, Tesla will have no choice but to sell their cars at even lesser margins.\n\nThe green credits which Tesla depends highly on to boost their profit numbers become less attractive in 2022 and it drops significantly. A big revenue stream for Tesla is about to go out of business.\n\nAutonomous driving experiences set back, Tesla cant deliver a workable solution and regulations ban the use of fully auto vehicles due to safety concerns.\n\nThe already crowded Tesla network is both costly to maintain and cant expand quick enough. Other players using standard charging ports catch up and overtake Tesla here. Especially in Europe and China. Since Tesla cars can only charge on Tesla ports, suddenly, Tesla cars are less attractive to own.",

Not many of the basic electronic components everything else is built from are made in the US. American companies like Vishay, Microchip, Texas Instruments, and Xilinx either operate factories in China or contract foundries in China or Taiwan. Other large supplies of ours are not even American such as Yageo and TE Connectivity aren't even headquartered in the US and manufacturer the bulk of their product in their home country. It's been a big issue for my portion of the defense industry the past couple of years because these factories in China are also sourcing a large portion of counterfeit electronic components on the market.\n\nI know we're not the only defense manufacturer using Chinese components because I've seen several news articles and reports from the DOD claiming this is a problem.\n\nhttps://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/dec/10/us-military-reliance-china-foreign-suppliers-expos/\n\nPanasonic and Murata (Japanese) used to produce critical components of our products, but have since stopped selling to us because they don't want their products used in munitions. When that happened the government fronted a lot of money to a couple American companies to produce an alternative since none existed.",

Pick any of the top ten companies in the country or world and you are likely to dominate the average. We have known for 50+ years that Exxon has its hands in government pockets. Easy pick.

They are in a dying industry and have been unsuccessful in pivoting away from fossil fuels to alternative sources of revenue. b.) They are a poorly run company that has had multiple CEOs in the past 10 years. c.) They have had declining revenue since 2014. d.) They are not reinvesting a lot of their profits back into the business because so much of it is released to shareholders as dividends. They know that that is one of the few reasons they are still in a lot of portfolios and ETFs. \"tHey pAy a HeAlThY dIvIdEnD.\" Yes, but as a result they are backed into a corner and their business plan is basically: Extract as much value from the business as possible while we still can. \n\nDoes that mean that you can't make money off Exxon stock? No, ofc not, and in fact it's one of the best performing stocks in the S&amp;P500 this year. However, a company that has peaked without any contingency plan to continued growth will never be able to match the returns of a company like Microsoft or Google that are growing 20+% Y-o-Y top and bottom line. I will happily pay a premium to companies that have an outstanding track record and ample room to grow and, more importantly, *the proven ability to seek out alternative sources of revenue*. That is not priced in because we don't even know where these companies are headed until they tell us. I am putting my faith in Nadella and Pichai to lead those companies to growth opportunities that investors hadn't even considered yet. \n\nMeanwhile back at Exxon they are just doing damage control to make sure that their dividend is paid at all costs. That is a terrible investment strategy and the difference in returns over the past decade show it. How likely is it do you think that Exxon will continue down this path and likewise for Microsoft and Google? I do not want companies that don't have a bright future ahead because the potential for sizeable returns is just so much smaller. Unfortunately, companies like Exxon still occupy a sizeable chunk in the S&amp;P500 because once-upon-a-time Exxon in particular was the largest company in the world by market cap. As a result, it drops the S&amp;P500s total return hence why I went with the NASDAQ-100. \n\nIt's not that I'm actively *picking* tech stocks, it's that I'm *removing* chronically underperforming companies like Exxon, Chevron, Wells Fargo, IBM, Ford, GM, etc. and the NASDAQ is the most similar to what an ideal portfolio would look like.",

Using a 5-year average of price/earnings is ok, because it normalizes the value of the company to their earnings at the time, and shows where wall street is pricing the company over time.  Using 5-year averages on earnings, or revenue only is dumb unless you think the company is going to regress on it's revenue.  \n\nAt one point they're averaging FCF for the last 5 years and comparing that to current market cap.  That just simply doesn't work when FCF today is nearly double what it was 5 years ago, and it's not only still growing - but it's still accelerating.  The fact that MSFT had 34B in free cash flow in 2016 is completely irrelevant to the stock's price today, where they have 56B in FCF.   \n\nThe way these guys are coming up with their valuations are as if MSFT isn't growing any more - it's more useful when looking at mature dividend companies, but it's not really a good way to value a company that is going to aggressively grow for the next 5-10 years.",

Pick any of the top ten companies in the country or world and you are likely to dominate the average. We have known for 50+ years that Exxon has its hands in government pockets. Easy pick. We\u2019ve known for 30 years that Microsoft would rule the PC world. You could have waited 20 years \u201cjust to make sure\u201d before increasing and you would destroy the S&amp;P.

        "body": "We are talking multiple years here if not decades. Companies like Exxon. a.) They are in a dying industry and have been unsuccessful in pivoting away from fossil fuels to alternative sources of revenue. b.) They are a poorly run company that has had multiple CEOs in the past 10 years. c.) They have had declining revenue since 2014. d.) They are not reinvesting a lot of their profits back into the business because so much of it is released to shareholders as dividends. They know that that is one of the few reasons they are still in a lot of portfolios and ETFs. \"tHey pAy a HeAlThY dIvIdEnD.\" Yes, but as a result they are backed into a corner and their business plan is basically: Extract as much value from the business as possible while we still can. \n\nDoes that mean that you can't make money off Exxon stock? No, ofc not, and in fact it's one of the best performing stocks in the S&amp;P500 this year. However, a company that has peaked without any contingency plan to continued growth will never be able to match the returns of a company like Microsoft or Google that are growing 20+% Y-o-Y top and bottom line. I will happily pay a premium to companies that have an outstanding track record and ample room to grow and, more importantly, *the proven ability to seek out alternative sources of revenue*. That is not priced in because we don't even know where these companies are headed until they tell us. I am putting my faith in Nadella and Pichai to lead those companies to growth opportunities that investors hadn't even considered yet. \n\nMeanwhile back at Exxon they are just doing damage control to make sure that their dividend is paid at all costs. That is a terrible investment strategy and the difference in returns over the past decade show it. How likely is it do you think that Exxon will continue down this path and likewise for Microsoft and Google? I do not want companies that don't have a bright future ahead because the potential for sizeable returns is just so much smaller. Unfortunately, companies like Exxon still occupy a sizeable chunk in the S&amp;P500 because once-upon-a-time Exxon in particular was the largest company in the world by market cap. As a result, it drops the S&amp;P500s total return hence why I went with the NASDAQ-100. \n\nIt's not that I'm actively *picking* tech stocks, it's that I'm *removing* chronically underperforming companies like Exxon, Chevron, Wells Fargo, IBM, Ford, GM, etc. and the NASDAQ is the most similar to what an ideal portfolio would look like.",

Using a 5-year average of price/earnings is ok, because it normalizes the value of the company to their earnings at the time, and shows where wall street is pricing the company over time.  Using 5-year averages on earnings, or revenue only is dumb unless you think the company is going to regress on it's revenue.  \n\nAt one point they're averaging FCF for the last 5 years and comparing that to current market cap.  That just simply doesn't work when FCF today is nearly double what it was 5 years ago, and it's not only still growing - but it's still accelerating.  The fact that MSFT had 34B in free cash flow in 2016 is completely irrelevant to the stock's price today, where they have 56B in FCF.   \n\nThe way these guys are coming up with their valuations are as if MSFT isn't growing any more - it's more useful when looking at mature dividend companies, but it's not really a good way to value a company that is going to aggressively grow for the next 5-10 years.",
