Unless you think 93% of the homes they bought in Phoenix came encumbered with tenants, it's not a smart idea to extrapolate from a few anecdotes. Zillow knows when a market turns, it's better to cut losses and take them quickly than let them grow. That's what successful traders and stock flippers do too. The real losers are the other iBuyers that haven't figured out how to cut their losses and get to the sidelines. While Zillow is trying to cut their inventory, OPEN is growing theirs enormously. That's not gonna work out well. The question is, when this Fed-fueled stock market turns, will the apes here be like Zillow, cut their losses and book the gains, or will they be like OPEN and diamond-hand it all the way down.",

Because if you just buy a stock and you let it stay there, unless the company gives dividends you will receive nothing in return. So you agree that a company that gives dividends does have value? Let's say a company that gives 10% of dividends each year, will make you back that money in 10 years and from there everything else is a bonus.\n\nNow. What is the reason why every company doesn't give dividends? The reason is growth. They and their shareholders both think it's better to invest the potential dividends back into growing the company. \n\nBut the company always will have \"potential\" to give out dividends, once they decide they don't need to grow anymore - they could start giving out dividends, but meanwhile you can think of dividends as constantly being automatically invested back into the company, however due to company growing the potential also increases an you can still cash out the \"dividends\" by selling the stock at higher price due to potential of dividends having been grown.\n\nDoes that make sense?",

Great but now you need $900 more to get another 1 share.\n\nIf the price was $100 a share and you bought 10 (same $1000) you would be able to reinvest it and have 11 shares at the end of the year.\n\nWith the $1000 share you would have 1 share and $100 waiting for you to get enough to invest. This slows you down, this becomes less of a problem as you go but can be tough at the start. In this example it limits the ability for the compounding interest to be fully efficient.\n\n2) Smaller amounts of shares can be a problem if you wanted to rebalance or decide to change investments in the future.\n\nKeeping with the previous example of prices per share, if I had 3 shares at $1000 and it went up 10% I may want to take that 10% and invest it somewhere else. Sadly, I only have 3 shares so the best I could do is sell 1 share. So instead of just rebalancing with the 10% I would be limited to rebalancing with 33%.\n\nIf each share was $100, I would have been able to sell 3 shares. Keep my $3000 still invested but move the $300 to something else, vs selling 1 of the 3 shares for $1100.\n\n3) As others have said, it would also involves options, but as you are starting out, this could be something that isn't important to you.\n\nAll of this kinda revolves around you having a basic ideas and understanding of what you are doing, the risks and goals and plans for the investment.\n\nHopefully you understand the risks and basics of investing vs just trying to cash in on a way to get rich, because others have had luck. It is always a bit worrying when the only socks people reference are the \"popular\" picks at the time. \n\nIf you are starting out, please take some time to look at the basics and save yourself the costs of multiple small mistakes costing you your hard earned money. Also please take a look at ETF's as they can be particularly good for starting out while you figure out your long term strategy.",

So you can see a physical, tangible value.  If there is no dividend, then you need to have faith that the stock have value, we all hope they go up as the company becomes more valuable.  Now if you own enough shares you get a stronger say in how the company is run through share voting.  If you own the majority of share you can actually dictate, to some extent, how the company is runned.  So the higher ups in the company tend to own a decent portion of the company to have these votes.  It's also always on the table for the company to buy back more shares, that way they can keep more of the profits in house.  \n\nBut you are not wrong in the way you are seeing things.  If everyone were to collectivelt say this piece of paper isn't worth shit, and try to sell off.  They could all be worth nothing.  But the system has been in place for a long time.  You also have legal rights as a share holder and there are other mechanisms that make the stock have a cash value.",

Either way, more importantly I'm saving up for a robot army that can solve the issue much more effectively than public office. \n\nAnyway, do you recycle? Or do you just put recyclable shit in a recycling bin and never find out where it actually goes? Because if you actually handle your own recycling then great, you're one of those few people who actually tries your best and I was wrong to call you my event. But if you just send your shit to go get co-mingled into the same landfill as your trash, and you call that recycling, shut the fuck up and deep throat my dick. \n\nBut guess what? You don't have to be a political figure or anything to just try your best. I've at least established a home on sustainable land where I help out with the farm when I can and I keep helping improve the property to prepare for what's to come. Thanks to me I have a pretty clear idea of how me and my loved ones can survive everything short of bunker time and I'm still working on something for bunker time. One year ago, I had no idea how I would survive grocery stores running out of food, and neither did any of my loved ones. These resources are available to us now and I have this connection with a farm and live in it now because of my effort and choices.\n\nSimply trying to live sustainably enough to survive is me taking responsibility for my survival and trying my best to avoid extinction at the simplest individual scale. Have you even done that? Have you even got a clear idea of how you're going to be keeping YOURSELF alive, let alone your loved ones, without draining resources that other, smarter, more responsible people prepared while you were jerking off about how you recycle? \n\nIf I have a vastly inflated sense of myself and no realistic conception of the world, that's wonderful. I can only hope I'll meet a really nice girl and we'll start a family and get old together while agriculture just keeps working fine and the weather somehow gets under control.

The cost of one nuclear warhead is 28M dollars. \n3. detonating 100 nuclear warheads across the globe would initiate nuclear winter, and wipe out most if not all human life on the planet. \n\nboom, world hunger solved. And at a measly 2.8 billion dollars - merely half of musk's proposal.  as an added bonus, the soot release from these explosions would blanket the earth in darkness for over a decade, effectively solving Global warming, and droping the planets tempature by about 10 degrees globally, and we would also solve our trash oceans too, as they wont be adding any more trash to it! \n\nI'll take my 6 billion now mr musk. i'll use the other 3.2 billion to build a few vaults so we can rebuild in a hundred years or so.",

I'd wait till Tesla settles down and the IV drops back significantly before you do. But basically at max level options trading you can sell your shares and then close your positions with the money from the shares. \n\nIf you don't have this level of trading/margin available call your broker and they will do this for you. You get the net. Invest 90% in an ETF and never touch it again since you have a gambling addiction. \n\nBut definitely wait till Tesla settles down. Even if it ramps up another 200 bucks over the month. Wait till it does it's thing where it kinda trades down/sideways for 3 months. The IV drop will probably save you 50-100k when closing that position. \n\n\n\nAnd finally, you're not retarded for selling CC.

How many people thought Dec 2018 was going to be a huge bear market? Then March 2019... and everyday since then? If I had sat out that whole time waiting for some other market I would have missed out on $12k in gains!   \n\n\nNow obviously that is one anecdote and past performance is not proof of future gains, but missing out on investing because some people claim to know better than everyone else is a terrible investment strategy.   \n\n\nMy only regret is not investing more when I was in my 20s!",

What I do for one company normally takes 3-5 hours, and I try to do it quarterly for any company I own.\n\nI will usually start by collecting the company's past, current and future valuation metrics.  Things like price to sales, price to earnings, price to forward earnings, debt ratios, etc.  I compare the 5 year averages to what they currently are.  I also do for their competitors and companies in the same financial space (for example, I'd look at Visa, Mastercard, and other card companies together).  I look at past growth and projected growth to see if I think the valuations are justifiable where they currently are.\n\nI look through the financial statements and try to spot trends in cash flow, debt, margin, and many other things to see how the company is performing yoy and qoq.\n\nI look at how the company is engaging with the industry and where they are projecting their growth to come from.  Are the expanding market share, is the sector growing, etc.  I need the company to justify why it can achieve or surpass their growth estimates.\n\nI listen to their most recent conference calls and look though any articles I can find, but I heavily discount opinion pieces.  I actively seek out reasons why this company will fail.\n\nAfter all of this, I try to put together a balanced view of where the company is valued now vs historically and also vs their competition.  It requires a lot of projection and assumptions and I only do it for companies that I can understand their business model.  You have to go into the process without bias, and to be honest the majority of companies that I do this for aren't buys at the time.",

        "body": "Tesla has insane margins on their EVs and its clear that those margins are growing. The competition needs to sell 3+ EVs for every 1 that Tesla sells. And on top of that, Tesla produces cars in 1/3rd the time. Some OEMs are not profitable at all and each EV sold is a loss.\n\nAlso Tesla has car sales back logged for 6 months!\n\nAnd a simple youtube search of FSD 10.3 shows dozens of reviews and drives of the general public. Meanwhile the competition only reveals company videos of their absolute best drives.\n\nHow about autonomous distribution?\nHow many self driving cars can the competition roll out to with these geofenced cars that need lidar and radar? Compare that to Tesla, which can push an over the air update and sell FSD to millions in an instant.\n\nPeople keep calling Tesla just a car company, but what other car company is the:\n\nMajority part Supplier\nDealership\nFuel provider\nMicrochip maker\nAI developer\nSoftware developer",

        "body": "&gt; in fact im fairly certain all of our parts are manufactured on US soil\n\nDown to what level though? Not many of the basic electronic components everything else is built from are made in the US. American companies like Vishay, Microchip, Texas Instruments, and Xilinx either operate factories in China or contract foundries in China or Taiwan. Other large supplies of ours are not even American such as Yageo and TE Connectivity aren't even headquartered in the US and manufacturer the bulk of their product in their home country. It's been a big issue for my portion of the defense industry the past couple of years because these factories in China are also sourcing a large portion of counterfeit electronic components on the market.\n\nI know we're not the only defense manufacturer using Chinese components because I've seen several news articles and reports from the DOD claiming this is a problem.\n\nhttps://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/dec/10/us-military-reliance-china-foreign-suppliers-expos/\n\nPanasonic and Murata (Japanese) used to produce critical components of our products, but have since stopped selling to us because they don't want their products used in munitions. When that happened the government fronted a lot of money to a couple American companies to produce an alternative since none existed.",
