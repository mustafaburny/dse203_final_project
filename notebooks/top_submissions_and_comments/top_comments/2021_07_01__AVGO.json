I'm of the belief that recent COVID-19 Delta fears coupled with CDC court battles are the reason this travel leisure play has not caught traction ([https://www.clickorlando.com/news/2021/07/08/cdc-asks-court-to-put-florida-cruise-ruling-on-hold-after-judge-refuses/](https://www.clickorlando.com/news/2021/07/08/cdc-asks-court-to-put-florida-cruise-ruling-on-hold-after-judge-refuses/)).  \n\nRising options activity in OTM calls has my interest ([https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/noteworthy-tuesday-option-activity%3A-nclh-nke-avgo-2021-07-06](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/noteworthy-tuesday-option-activity%3A-nclh-nke-avgo-2021-07-06)). I've made some significant returns this past CY on Gaming and REITs (CZR;SPG).   I rarely get into trading an industry i'm not long on however but this is the exception.  Listening to the last investor call and forward guidance based on bookings,  I think the upside returns are worth the risk.  This does assume positive CDC actions and continued vaccinations along with a strong August call.  I expect $36-$38 range by October.",
