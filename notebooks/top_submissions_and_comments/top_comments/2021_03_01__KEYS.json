There I was, a kid of 11 from the New York Snow Belt, basking in the warm sun of the Florida Keys. \n\n\nOn my last day there, I went to the juice bar outside out hotel, on the beach. While I was waiting for my fresh tropical juice smoothie, I overheard two men talking. \n\n\n\"Geez, Bill. That Conga line really took it out of me!\" Said one of the men, clean shaven except a bristly mustache above his lip. \n\n\n\"I know, Ted. My legs are on fire! I haven't danced like that since college! Let's hurry up and get back there!\"\n\n\nThe men, both wearing neon swim trunks, raced off over a sand dune and out of sight. \n\n\nI loved dancing! Tropical line dancing sounded so amazing to do right now! I grabbed my drink and sped off over the sand dune towards the sound of music. \n\n\nI followed the music into a secluded opening in a patch of palm trees and undergrowth. There, to my horror, was thirty men in a circle, each fucking the ass of the man in front of him while simultaneously being fucked from behind. \n\n\nMany years later I heard this is sometimes called a \"daisy chain\", or a \"gay Conga line\". \n\n\nIt's the second gayest thing I've ever seen, next to Jim Cramer.",

You should do your own research, read the DD, and make informed decisions. Don't invest money you can't afford to lose.\n\nIn other words, fuck safely, or you'll get fucked.\n\n\u2022\t\u2060There is no \"we.\"\n\t\u2060\u2022\t\u2060I'm holding because that's my choice.

No market manipulation.\n\nReport posts that encourage everyone to buy at the same time. The primary reason for this is legal, but the secondary is that the media will cherry-pick comments like this to give us a bad name and put more negativity out there through their articles, broadcasts, etc.\n\n\u2022\t\u2060There will be plenty of FUD (or \"fear, uncertainty, and doubt\")\n\t\u2060\u2022\t\u2060I am including this out of belief, if not pure spite\n\t\u2060\u2022\t\u2060There are redditors being paid to scare you\n\t\u2060\u2022\t\u2060There are bots made to SPAM negativity\n\t\u2060\u2022\t\u2060There are people profiting when you sell\n\t\u2060\u2022\t\u2060This starts ramping up in the afternoon\n\nThere are two sides to this fight, and we have to remember that there are people profiting if we fail.

But they don't understand just how dumb we really are. We are far too stupid to be afraid of their fearmongering, and we'll hold 'til the moon.\n\n\u2022\t\u2060If you're new, this may not be for you\n\t\u2060\u2022\t\u2060This is something you have to be really brave or really stupid for\n\t\u2060\u2022\t\u2060You will either see enormous gains or enormous losses\n\t\u2060\u2022\t\u2060Invest wisely, don't spend your rent money, and read the DD\n\t\u2060\u2022\t\u2060Read the DD\n\t\u2060\u2022\t\u2060Read the DD\n\t\u2060\u2022\t\u2060DD is short for Due Diligence, and it's basically just researching a stock before you buy in. There's plenty of great DD on this sub, and you can sort by the DD flair to see the highest-voted posts.

        "body": "A lot of people are investing in Bitcoin ETFs and Bitcoin mining companies  without realizing some issues such as the fact that you will not own actual Bitcoin. Also, you will not be insured if anything happens to the ETF. Here are a few points which may or may not be helpful to you from my perspective regarding buying this alternative asset class, cold storage, taxation, and the cheapest method of accumulating/procuring it in Canada:\n\n1. Personally, I only buy on the Newton app since they currently have the lowest purchasing fees out of all of the available exchanges in Canada. Newton's average spread varies from 0.50% to 0.60% which is 2-3 times cheaper than most of the other available exchanges that are available to us as Canadians. I also use the ShakePay app to earn free Bitcoin on a daily basis by physically shaking my phone once a day. Trust me, I know that sounds ridiculous, stupid, and suspicious, but ShakePay is a legitimate company based out of Montr\u00e9al which is regulated by both FINTRAC and AMF while it is also legally licensed as a Money Service Business. I never actually buy from ShakePay because of their high purchasing spreads (which is approximately 1.75%) and I simply use them for the free daily accumulation of Bitcoin. Anyone who uses ShakePay can attest to this and easily confirm their legitimacy. \n\n2. Since I actually want to own the underlying asset, I withdraw my Bitcoin from both of those exchanges and I put my assets into a cold storage wallet. In Canada, this is currently the cheapest method of accumulating Bitcoin and truly owning the assets by storing them \"offline\" in a cold storage wallet. However, in order to unlock the ShakingSats feature in ShakePay to earn free Bitcoin, you will need to be referred as per their current terms and conditions. I can assist you with that in addition to answering any general questions that you may have regarding buying, selling, converting, and taxation-related issues if you want to message me directly as I am always willing to help educate others in this space with whatever knowledge and/or experience that I have gained over the years.\n\n3. If you want tax free capital gains, you can buy QBTC or BTCC in your TFSA. For QBTC, it is certainly expensive in terms of its historical premiums (5%-20%) and MER (1.95%); however, if you are long/bullish in Bitcoin as an alternative asset class, then perhaps it does not really matter. With that said, you do not truly own Bitcoin with QBTC or BTCC because they are a fund; and therefore, you own shares of the fund and not Bitcoin itself. As the saying goes and as you may have heard if you have done your due diligence: \"not your keys, not your Bitcoin\". As such, you run and operate with all of the associated risks of leaving your coins on an exchange which is why I choose to own the real thing and use a cold storage wallet. These products are not insured and same goes with the newly released ETF called BTCC. Big risk, but tax free in a TFSA.\n\n4. You may have heard of a Canadian company named Quadriga. In short, many investors did not truly own their Bitcoin with them since Quadriga sold \"entitlements to receive crypto assets or fiat currency from Quadriga\" while Quadriga held the \"keys\" to the real Bitcoin and investors lost around 135 million dollars CAD, but up to 250 million dollars CAD according to Wikipedia. This is verifiable information, a famous story, and a perfect example of \"not your keys, not your Bitcoin\" as well as a lack of insurance of clients.\n\n5. Unfortunately, with BTCC, QBTC and WealthSimple Crypto, you cannot take your Bitcoin off of their exchanges because, again, you do not truly own Bitcoin with them. Rather, you own shares of the fund whereas those organizations truly own the asset since they have the \"keys\". They are the ones who own the real asset (Bitcoin) and simply run the fund with the Bitcoin backing that fund as they make money through their ridiculously overpriced premiums and spread/fees (WealthSimple's spread is around 1.5-2.0% if not higher and BTCC's MER is about 1%).\n\n6. In regards to taxes, if you truly own the asset (Bitcoin), it is subject to capital appreciation tax whenever you trigger a taxable event such as selling it, buying things with it, and/or converting crypto-to-crypto. As such, you need to be prudent in your bookkeeping behavior and calculate your \"adjusted cost base\" for each transaction. There is no legal requirement forcing you to calculate your \"adjusted cost base\" for each transaction, but it just saves you a lot of headaches later on when you need to pay taxes. This is no different than investing in traditional equities in a taxable account after you have maxed out your TFSA, RRSP, RESP, etc.\n\n7. Before you invest in anything regardless of the asset class, make sure you understand what you are putting your money towards, understand your risk tolerance, understand the proper asset allocation percentages for your risk tolerance, and formulate a clear plan of what you want to achieve. For me, the biggest investment is not really the Bitcoin itself, but rather, it is in the underlying technology and innovation of the blockchain infrastructure which serves as a massive global public ledger leading to the decentralization of this digital currency as well as its invincibility and independence from overbearing governing bodies whereby the Bitcoin unit itself simply has a monetary value relative to fiat currency. Disclaimer: I am super long Bitcoin.\n\nNow, here are some general points of interests to help you understand cold storage wallets:\n\n1. There is a big misconception that if you decide to operate as your own bank (i.e.truly own your Bitcoin) and use a cold storage wallet device (i.e. physical hardware connected via USB to your PC), that your assets (Bitcoin) will be transferred and stored onto that physical USB device. This is the part that confuses a lot of people. In short, Bitcoin is not stored on that device, it will never be stored there, and this is because Bitcoin can never leave its \"blockchain\".\n\n2. So, what does your cold storage device do? The device allows you to have a \"key\" to your asset (Bitcoin) on the blockchain. How is this \"key\" established? Without going too deep into the technical aspects, when you initially setup the hardware wallet device, you will be given a 24-word \"seed phrase\" and it is literally 24 words. From a computer science perspective, this 24-word \"seed phrase\" actually represents and is transcribed into a huge series/string of alphanumeric characters. This 24-word \"seed phrase\" is essentially your \"keys\" to your assets on the blockchain.\n\n3. Your 24-word \"seed phrase\" is what is most important if you decide to act as your own bank and truly own Bitcoin since this is what gives you access to it. It does not matter if you lose your physical device and it does not matter if your physical device was destroyed. Why? Again, your assets are on the blockchain and not on the physical device. So, if you lose your physical device, you can simply replace it with another one (and this can be one from a different manufacturer too), set it up with your original 24-word \"seed phrase\" and you will once again have access to your assets since they are on the blockchain. In essence, never lose your \"keys\" because then you will have truly lost your Bitcoin. \n\n4. As you can probably see now, your 24-word \"seed phrase\" is extremely important (and more important than the physical hardware device itself). Therefore, when you first take note of your 24-word \"seed phrase\" during the initial setup of your physical hardware device, make sure that no one is watching, there are no cameras around you (including your mobile phone), etc. Only you should know your \"keys\". Never type it out on any digital device, never e-mail it to yourself, never take a photo of it, never upload it to a cloud database such as Google Docs and never try to encrypt it and put it on a regular USB drive. You want this 24-word seed phrase as private as possible. So, if anyone/anything asks you for your \"keys\", never give it out. Period.\n\n5. What is a blockchain? It is a transparent, public, and append-only ledger. Basically, you can add data to this transparent, open, and public ledger, but you can never edit/delete previously established data within it. This is executed by a mechanism of consensus creation between geographically scattered parties (i.e. computers) that do not need to trust each other. The parties only need to trust the consensus mechanism itself. Blockchain infrastructure relies on some form of challenge such that no single party on the network can consistently and systematically solve this challenge more than everyone else on the network. This randomizes the consensus mechanism of confirming transactions and ensures that no single party can force the blockchain ledger to accept a particular entry onto the ledger that others disagree with. This is a peer-to-peer network that can maintain updates to the ledger and verify those updates in such a way that it is impossible to defraud and impossible to alter an entry after it has been confirmed via consensus.\n\nI sincerely hope that this has been helpful to you and good luck!",

This would make them the most recognizable name in the Steam key business and would tie their success to Steam's success, which like you said is basically already a monopoly on PC gaming. Also this would be much less expensive and require less licensing than attempting to create a platform for downloading and playing the actual games, not to mention whatever else they would have to do to outcompete Steam. They could also sell keys for games on other platforms like Origin and Epic and tie their success to Steam and Origin and Epic.",

        "body": "Here are a few points which may or may not be helpful to you from my perspective regarding buying this alternative asset class, cold storage, taxation, and the cheapest method of accumulating/procuring it in Canada:\n\n1. Personally, I only buy on the Newton app since they currently have the lowest purchasing fees out of all of the available exchanges in Canada. Newton's average spread varies from 0.50% to 0.60% which is 2-3 times cheaper than most of the other available exchanges that are available to us as Canadians. I also use the ShakePay app to earn free Bitcoin on a daily basis by physically shaking my phone once a day. Trust me, I know that sounds ridiculous, stupid, and suspicious, but ShakePay is a legitimate company based out of Montr\u00e9al which is regulated by both FINTRAC and AMF while it is also legally licensed as a Money Service Business. I never actually buy from ShakePay because of their high purchasing spreads (which is approximately 1.75%) and I simply use them for the free daily accumulation of Bitcoin. Anyone who uses ShakePay can attest to this and easily confirm their legitimacy. \n\n2. Since I actually want to own the underlying asset, I withdraw my Bitcoin from both of those exchanges and I put my assets into a cold storage wallet. In Canada, this is currently the cheapest method of accumulating Bitcoin and truly owning the assets by storing them \"offline\" in a cold storage wallet. However, in order to unlock the ShakingSats feature in ShakePay to earn free Bitcoin, you will need to be referred as per their current terms and conditions. I can assist you with that in addition to answering any general questions that you may have regarding buying, selling, converting, and taxation-related issues if you want to message me directly as I am always willing to help educate others in this space with whatever knowledge and/or experience that I have gained over the years.\n\n3. If you want tax free capital gains, you can buy QBTC or BTCC in your TFSA. For QBTC, it is certainly expensive in terms of its historical premiums (5%-20%) and MER (1.95%); however, if you are long/bullish in Bitcoin as an alternative asset class, then perhaps it does not really matter. With that said, you do not truly own Bitcoin with QBTC or BTCC because they are a fund; and therefore, you own shares of the fund and not Bitcoin itself. As the saying goes and as you may have heard if you have done your due diligence: \"not your keys, not your Bitcoin\". As such, you run and operate with all of the associated risks of leaving your coins on an exchange which is why I choose to own the real thing and use a cold storage wallet. These products are not insured and same goes with the newly released ETF called BTCC. Big risk, but tax free in a TFSA.\n\n4. You may have heard of a Canadian company named Quadriga. In short, many investors did not truly own their Bitcoin with them since Quadriga sold \"entitlements to receive crypto assets or fiat currency from Quadriga\" while Quadriga held the \"keys\" to the real Bitcoin and investors lost around 135 million dollars CAD, but up to 250 million dollars CAD according to Wikipedia. This is verifiable information, a famous story, and a perfect example of \"not your keys, not your Bitcoin\" as well as a lack of insurance of clients.\n\n5. Unfortunately, with BTCC, QBTC and WealthSimple Crypto, you cannot take your Bitcoin off of their exchanges because, again, you do not truly own Bitcoin with them. Rather, you own shares of the fund whereas those organizations truly own the asset since they have the \"keys\". They are the ones who own the real asset (Bitcoin) and simply run the fund with the Bitcoin backing that fund as they make money through their ridiculously overpriced premiums and spread/fees (WealthSimple's spread is around 1.5-2.0% if not higher and BTCC's MER is about 1%).\n\n6. In regards to taxes, if you truly own the asset (Bitcoin), it is subject to capital appreciation tax whenever you trigger a taxable event such as selling it, buying things with it, and/or converting crypto-to-crypto. As such, you need to be prudent in your bookkeeping behavior and calculate your \"adjusted cost base\" for each transaction. There is no legal requirement forcing you to calculate your \"adjusted cost base\" for each transaction, but it just saves you a lot of headaches later on when you need to pay taxes. This is no different than investing in traditional equities in a taxable account after you have maxed out your TFSA, RRSP, RESP, etc.\n\n7. Before you invest in anything regardless of the asset class, make sure you understand what you are putting your money towards, understand your risk tolerance, understand the proper asset allocation percentages for your risk tolerance, and formulate a clear plan of what you want to achieve. For me, the biggest investment is not really the Bitcoin itself, but rather, it is in the underlying technology and innovation of the blockchain infrastructure which serves as a massive global public ledger leading to the decentralization of this digital currency as well as its invincibility and independence from overbearing governing bodies whereby the Bitcoin unit itself simply has a monetary value relative to fiat currency. Disclaimer: I am super long Bitcoin.\n\nNow, here are some general points of interests to help you understand cold storage wallets:\n\n1. There is a big misconception that if you decide to operate as your own bank (i.e.truly own your Bitcoin) and use a cold storage wallet device (i.e. physical hardware connected via USB to your PC), that your assets (Bitcoin) will be transferred and stored onto that physical USB device. This is the part that confuses a lot of people. In short, Bitcoin is not stored on that device, it will never be stored there, and this is because Bitcoin can never leave its \"blockchain\".\n\n2. So, what does your cold storage device do? The device allows you to have a \"key\" to your asset (Bitcoin) on the blockchain. How is this \"key\" established? Without going too deep into the technical aspects, when you initially setup the hardware wallet device, you will be given a 24-word \"seed phrase\" and it is literally 24 words. From a computer science perspective, this 24-word \"seed phrase\" actually represents and is transcribed into a huge series/string of alphanumeric characters. This 24-word \"seed phrase\" is essentially your \"keys\" to your assets on the blockchain.\n\n3. Your 24-word \"seed phrase\" is what is most important if you decide to act as your own bank and truly own Bitcoin since this is what gives you access to it. It does not matter if you lose your physical device and it does not matter if your physical device was destroyed. Why? Again, your assets are on the blockchain and not on the physical device. So, if you lose your physical device, you can simply replace it with another one (and this can be one from a different manufacturer too), set it up with your original 24-word \"seed phrase\" and you will once again have access to your assets since they are on the blockchain. In essence, never lose your \"keys\" because then you will have truly lost your Bitcoin. \n\n4. As you can probably see now, your 24-word \"seed phrase\" is extremely important (and more important than the physical hardware device itself). Therefore, when you first take note of your 24-word \"seed phrase\" during the initial setup of your physical hardware device, make sure that no one is watching, there are no cameras around you (including your mobile phone), etc. Only you should know your \"keys\". Never type it out on any digital device, never e-mail it to yourself, never take a photo of it, never upload it to a cloud database such as Google Docs and never try to encrypt it and put it on a regular USB drive. You want this 24-word seed phrase as private as possible. So, if anyone/anything asks you for your \"keys\", never give it out. Period.\n\n5. What is a blockchain? It is a transparent, public, and append-only ledger. Basically, you can add data to this transparent, open, and public ledger, but you can never edit/delete previously established data within it. This is executed by a mechanism of consensus creation between geographically scattered parties (i.e. computers) that do not need to trust each other. The parties only need to trust the consensus mechanism itself. Blockchain infrastructure relies on some form of challenge such that no single party on the network can consistently and systematically solve this challenge more than everyone else on the network. This randomizes the consensus mechanism of confirming transactions and ensures that no single party can force the blockchain ledger to accept a particular entry onto the ledger that others disagree with. This is a peer-to-peer network that can maintain updates to the ledger and verify those updates in such a way that it is impossible to defraud and impossible to alter an entry after it has been confirmed via consensus.\n\nI sincerely hope that this has been helpful to you and good luck!",

        "body": "I'd suggest a diversified approach like the one you're thinking is more appropriate than a single investment in a banking stock, no matter how fortunate your parents have been in the past. Right now the S&amp;P 500 is a high P/E, high growth-dependent ETF whereas TD is probably set up to do well if interest rates rise - things are just a little easier for them in those environments. \n\nHave you considered any all-in-one ETFs that give you Canadian equity and fixed-income exposure as well? Maybe not much fixed-income considering your age and income needs (I'm assuming you'll be getting enough from your employment), but there are all-in-one ETFs that are 100% equities, just different allocations to each region (Canada, U.S., Europe, Emerging Markets, etc). \n\nYou're young - keep the fees ultra-low, and find your motivation to stay invested. Many successful investors use dividends as a motivator. Even though they theoretically don't change an investor's total returns (the share price is automatically reduced by the exchange on the stock's ex-dividend date), the psychology of receiving a regular stream of payments is enough to keep them focused on their long-term plan. Once you find your motivator for staying invested even through the hard times, you'll find the keys to long-term success.\n\nGood luck!",

Humans are weak in muscle strength, but are built for endurance and delicate manipulation of objects. Things like putting keys in pad locks and basket weaving are easy for a human, but other great apes will struggle and/or not be able to do.

There I was, a kid of 11 from the New York Snow Belt, basking in the warm sun of the Florida Keys. \n\n\nOn my last day there, I went to the juice bar outside our hotel, on the beach. While I was waiting for my fresh tropical juice smoothie, I overheard two men talking. \n\n\n\"Geez, Bill. That Conga line really took it out of me!\" Said one of the men, clean shaven except a bristly mustache above his lip. \n\n\n\"I know, Ted. My legs are on fire! I haven't danced like that since college! Let's hurry up and get back there!\"\n\n\nThe men, both wearing neon swim trunks, raced off over a sand dune and out of sight. \n\n\nI loved dancing! Tropical line dancing sounded so amazing to do right now. I grabbed my drink and sped off over the sand dune towards the sound of music. \n\n\nI followed the music into a secluded opening in a patch of palm trees and undergrowth. There, to my horror, was thirty men in a circle, each fucking the ass of the man in front of him while simultaneously being fucked from behind. \n\n\nMany years later I heard this is sometimes called a \"daisy chain\", or a \"gay Conga line\". \n\n\nIt's the second gayest thing I've ever seen, next to Jim Cramer.",

When I was approved, I was disappointed with the Level 1 access they restricted me to.   \n\nHowever, the limitations of Level 1 access have actually been a benefit IMHO, it has forced me to learn and pay attention to the details. It is rewarding to see my effort starting to pay out!  I'm also starting to realize that writing losing option contracts with level-1 access, while not impossible, is unlikely as long as a little effort is applied.  I think the biggest risk is being flagged as a Pattern Day Trader, which could happen even without options access.  \n\nHad Fidelity just handed me the keys and left me to my own devices I would have been overwhelmed and most likely royally screwed up my account, or worse.  \n\nBTW, selling covered calls has a '*hidden*' benefit I hadn't anticipated, which is simply amazing.   \n The anxiety of watching the price of the stock I own fall or trade sideways is GONE!  \n\n* Stock price went down?  Excellent, I can buy my calls back sooner and sell them again and make money.\n* Stock price went WAY down?  Excellent, I can buy more stock and my calls back sooner and sell more calls and make money.\n* Stock price went sideways?  Excellent, I'm a day closer to expiration and got to burn theta and make money.\n* Stock price went up?

What percentage of the market values companies purely in DCF anyway?\n\nI think this is more a broader correction around fears that the Fed will not live up to it's word on 'average inflation targeting' and will have to raise rates sooner and quicker than normal. I personally can't see this happening, as the Fed has shown itself to be extremely dovish and is trying to recover the real economy first (jobs ans solvency issues). \n\nThere is also the huge debt problem they now have from all the money printing they've done, the easiest way for them to solve that is to inflate it away as quickly as possible, so long term high inflation seems like something they would try for. I can't see the USA going into any kind of austerity to pay it off.",

That end of year statement was a bit of a \"Guh\" moment since everything I had earned plus some basically had evaporated.   But, wasn't like I was going to touch that money then.  I did nothing to change the strategy I had picked for investing and instead doubled up on my 401k contributions.\n\nBest decision I ever made in regards to my retirement investments -- I came out way ahead because I was able to buy more while everything was recovering.\n\nMy biggest regret over the last year is when COVID hit I was too focused on the disaster itself and neglected to make any real changes to how I was investing to take better advantage of it.  If this continues and goes deeper - don't look at it as a loss if your investing for the long term.  Look at as an opportunity to get more potential long term value out of the money you put in now. \n\nAs a current example - I bought NVIDIA because I believed they have a potential for real growth through the autonomous vehicle industry.  But, yeah stocks down since I invested in it.  Bought more this morning - why?  I **STILL** believe it's going to grow in the next 5-years because of the rise of autonomous vehicles tech.  *It's just on sale now.*",

The newest Ryzen chips are incredible, in terms of price to performance, and their newest set of graphics cards, while suffering from the same shortage as their only real competition, nVidia, have on par performance specs for 25% less. I've been an Intel/nVidia user since I built my first PC years ago, but in the last few generations of chips and cards, I've always recommended AMD products to my friends looking to build PCs. In fact, if you look on the logicalincrements website, which is a very popular resource for speccing out a new PC, each and every recommended CPU is AMD. They were small, and overlooked in the past, but they are dominating as of late.\n\nLooking at the prices of the stocks, AMD is still less than 1/3 the market cap of NVDA, despite the fact that NVDA only makes GPUs, while AMD makes both CPUs and GPUs. If you look at Intel, they have 2.5x the market cap of AMD, and they only make CPUs.\n\nWith the way AMD's chips have been performing, and the fact that they are outperforming on both isles of the PC gaming industry, I think they'll end up doing very well. A stock price of $250+ is not out of the question imo.",

I\u2019m keeping tabs on AMAT, TSM, LRCX, NXPI, FORM, UMC).\n\nThen finally the rare earth metals.. companies like MP, AMAT, VALE (I was long on these guys then they got a fucking $7B fine for killing 300 people in a dam explosion.... oops).\n\nLook into Biden\u2019s recent executive order, not only does he address the global semiconductor shortage, but plans to bring jobs back to the states and invest in American companies. MP Materials is the only US based company REM company. \n\nThis all looks so obvious as a long term play. I forget where I read it, but the global semiconductor usage is going to 10x or something insane like that in the next 10 years.\n\nI don\u2019t know why all of these companies are down recently, I haven\u2019t looked into it. I bought $10 worth of every stock listed above so I could keep tabs on them. All of them have followed the same negative trajectory the last month or so. If you zoom out to 5 year though, almost every single company shows insane growth. I imagine that growth will only compound long term. Do you have any thoughts on the reason for this recent downward trend? \n\nI\u2019m considering making a pretty massive 5-10 year long play on semiconductors.",

I personally can't see this happening, as the Fed has shown itself to be extremely dovish and is trying to recover the real economy first (jobs ans solvency issues). \n\nThere is also the huge debt problem they now have from all the money printing they've done, the easiest way for them to solve that is to inflate it away as quickly as possible, so long term high inflation seems like something they would try for.

That end of year statement was a bit of a \"Guh\" moment since everything I had earned plus some basically had evaporated.   But, wasn't like I was going to touch that money then.  I did nothing to change the strategy I had picked for investing and instead doubled up on my 401k contributions.\n\nBest decision I ever made in regards to my retirement investments -- I came out way ahead because I was able to buy more while everything was recovering.\n\nMy biggest regret over the last year is when COVID hit I was too focused on the disaster itself and neglected to make any real changes to how I was investing to take better advantage of it.  If this continues and goes deeper - don't look at it as a loss if your investing for the long term.  Look at as an opportunity to get more potential long term value out of the money you put in now. \n\nAs a current example - I bought NVIDIA because I believed they have a potential for real growth through the autonomous vehicle industry.  But, yeah stocks down since I invested in it.  Bought more this morning - why?  I **STILL** believe it's going to grow in the next 5-years because of the rise of autonomous vehicles tech.  *It's just on sale now.*",

        "body": "March 8 (Reuters) - The Dow climbed on Monday, led by stocks poised to benefit the most from an economic rebound as the $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief bill awaited a final Congressional vote this week, and heavyweight tech-related stocks swung between gains and losses.\n\nAfter the legislation won U.S. Senate approval on Saturday, President Joe Biden said he hoped for a quick passage of the revised coronavirus relief package by the Democrat-controlled House of Representatives so he could sign it and send $1,400 direct payments to Americans.\n\nProspects of more government spending and faster economic growth have stoked fears of a spike in inflation, sending the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield to near one-year highs.\n\nU.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, however, said on Monday the package would fuel a \"very strong\" U.S. recovery and she did not expect the economy to run too hot because of the increased spending.\n\nThe Dow hit a new record intraday high and was trading above its Feb. 24 record close. In the S&amp;P 500, the financial sector was the biggest boost, hitting a record as higher interest rates and a steeper yield curve helped banks. Industrials were right behind, also reaching a record high, while the materials sector neared an all-time peak. The technology sector was deepest in the red.\n\n\"This is an ideal traders' market with certain sectors and individual stocks performing better than the wider market, as investors pick and choose individual stocks that will perform better as the economy reopens,\" said Anthony Denier, chief executive officer of trading platform Webull.\n\nA slide in the big tech stocks that have driven the rally in equities since pandemic-induced lows of last March continued, with Apple Inc(AAPL), Nvidia Corp(NVDA), Tesla Inc(TSLA) and Alphabet Inc's(GOOG) Google leading declining shares on Nasdaq.\n\nTech stocks are particularly sensitive to rising yields because their value rests heavily on earnings in the future, which are discounted more deeply when bond returns go up.\n\nThe divergence between the tech stocks and non-tech stocks explains trading today, said Joe Saluzzi, partner and co-founder of Themis Trading in Chatham, New Jersey.\n\n\"The stimulus package will be certainly helping the bigger cap names,\" Saluzzi said, referring to non-tech stocks. \"The get-out and non-stay at home stocks are doing better now,\" he said.\n\nBy 3:09 p.m. ET (2009 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 416.64 points, or 1.32%, to 31,912.94, the S&amp;P 500 lost 3.83 points, or 0.10%, to 3,838.11 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 259.71 points, or 2.01%, to 12,660.44.\n\nBanks added about 1.7% as the yield on the benchmark 10-year note stood near a 13-month high, while airlines jumped about 5%.\n\nWalt Disney Co (DIS) jumped about 5.8% as California health officials set new rules that would allow Disneyland and other theme parks, stadiums and outdoor entertainment venues to reopen as early as April 1.\n\nGameStop Corp (GME) surged about 33% after the company said it had tapped shareholder Ryan Cohen to lead a transition to an e-commerce business.\n\nAdvancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.68-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.28-to-1 ratio favored advancers.\n\nThe S&amp;P 500 posted 124 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 390 new highs and 21 new lows.\n\n(Reporting by Herbert Lash in New York, Karen Pierog in Chicago and Medha Singh and Shashank Nayar in Bengaluru; Editing by Shounak Dasgupta and Lisa Shumaker)",
