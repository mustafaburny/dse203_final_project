There I was, a kid of 11 from the New York Snow Belt, basking in the warm sun of the Florida Keys. \n\n\nOn my last day there, I went to the juice bar outside out hotel, on the beach. While I was waiting for my fresh tropical juice smoothie, I overheard two men talking. \n\n\n\"Geez, Bill. That Conga line really took it out of me!\" Said one of the men, clean shaven except a bristly mustache above his lip. \n\n\n\"I know, Ted. My legs are on fire! I haven't danced like that since college! Let's hurry up and get back there!\"\n\n\nThe men, both wearing neon swim trunks, raced off over a sand dune and out of sight. \n\n\nI loved dancing! Tropical line dancing sounded so amazing to do right now! I grabbed my drink and sped off over the sand dune towards the sound of music. \n\n\nI followed the music into a secluded opening in a patch of palm trees and undergrowth. There, to my horror, was thirty men in a circle, each fucking the ass of the man in front of him while simultaneously being fucked from behind. \n\n\nMany years later I heard this is sometimes called a \"daisy chain\", or a \"gay Conga line\". \n\n\nIt's the second gayest thing I've ever seen, next to Jim Cramer.",

        "body": "A lot of people are investing in Bitcoin ETFs and Bitcoin mining companies  without realizing some issues such as the fact that you will not own actual Bitcoin. Also, you will not be insured if anything happens to the ETF. Here are a few points which may or may not be helpful to you from my perspective regarding buying this alternative asset class, cold storage, taxation, and the cheapest method of accumulating/procuring it in Canada:\n\n1. Personally, I only buy on the Newton app since they currently have the lowest purchasing fees out of all of the available exchanges in Canada. Newton's average spread varies from 0.50% to 0.60% which is 2-3 times cheaper than most of the other available exchanges that are available to us as Canadians. I also use the ShakePay app to earn free Bitcoin on a daily basis by physically shaking my phone once a day. Trust me, I know that sounds ridiculous, stupid, and suspicious, but ShakePay is a legitimate company based out of Montr\u00e9al which is regulated by both FINTRAC and AMF while it is also legally licensed as a Money Service Business. I never actually buy from ShakePay because of their high purchasing spreads (which is approximately 1.75%) and I simply use them for the free daily accumulation of Bitcoin. Anyone who uses ShakePay can attest to this and easily confirm their legitimacy. \n\n2. Since I actually want to own the underlying asset, I withdraw my Bitcoin from both of those exchanges and I put my assets into a cold storage wallet. In Canada, this is currently the cheapest method of accumulating Bitcoin and truly owning the assets by storing them \"offline\" in a cold storage wallet. However, in order to unlock the ShakingSats feature in ShakePay to earn free Bitcoin, you will need to be referred as per their current terms and conditions. I can assist you with that in addition to answering any general questions that you may have regarding buying, selling, converting, and taxation-related issues if you want to message me directly as I am always willing to help educate others in this space with whatever knowledge and/or experience that I have gained over the years.\n\n3. If you want tax free capital gains, you can buy QBTC or BTCC in your TFSA. For QBTC, it is certainly expensive in terms of its historical premiums (5%-20%) and MER (1.95%); however, if you are long/bullish in Bitcoin as an alternative asset class, then perhaps it does not really matter. With that said, you do not truly own Bitcoin with QBTC or BTCC because they are a fund; and therefore, you own shares of the fund and not Bitcoin itself. As the saying goes and as you may have heard if you have done your due diligence: \"not your keys, not your Bitcoin\". As such, you run and operate with all of the associated risks of leaving your coins on an exchange which is why I choose to own the real thing and use a cold storage wallet. These products are not insured and same goes with the newly released ETF called BTCC. Big risk, but tax free in a TFSA.\n\n4. You may have heard of a Canadian company named Quadriga. In short, many investors did not truly own their Bitcoin with them since Quadriga sold \"entitlements to receive crypto assets or fiat currency from Quadriga\" while Quadriga held the \"keys\" to the real Bitcoin and investors lost around 135 million dollars CAD, but up to 250 million dollars CAD according to Wikipedia. This is verifiable information, a famous story, and a perfect example of \"not your keys, not your Bitcoin\" as well as a lack of insurance of clients.\n\n5. Unfortunately, with BTCC, QBTC and WealthSimple Crypto, you cannot take your Bitcoin off of their exchanges because, again, you do not truly own Bitcoin with them. Rather, you own shares of the fund whereas those organizations truly own the asset since they have the \"keys\". They are the ones who own the real asset (Bitcoin) and simply run the fund with the Bitcoin backing that fund as they make money through their ridiculously overpriced premiums and spread/fees (WealthSimple's spread is around 1.5-2.0% if not higher and BTCC's MER is about 1%).\n\n6. In regards to taxes, if you truly own the asset (Bitcoin), it is subject to capital appreciation tax whenever you trigger a taxable event such as selling it, buying things with it, and/or converting crypto-to-crypto. As such, you need to be prudent in your bookkeeping behavior and calculate your \"adjusted cost base\" for each transaction. There is no legal requirement forcing you to calculate your \"adjusted cost base\" for each transaction, but it just saves you a lot of headaches later on when you need to pay taxes. This is no different than investing in traditional equities in a taxable account after you have maxed out your TFSA, RRSP, RESP, etc.\n\n7. Before you invest in anything regardless of the asset class, make sure you understand what you are putting your money towards, understand your risk tolerance, understand the proper asset allocation percentages for your risk tolerance, and formulate a clear plan of what you want to achieve. For me, the biggest investment is not really the Bitcoin itself, but rather, it is in the underlying technology and innovation of the blockchain infrastructure which serves as a massive global public ledger leading to the decentralization of this digital currency as well as its invincibility and independence from overbearing governing bodies whereby the Bitcoin unit itself simply has a monetary value relative to fiat currency. Disclaimer: I am super long Bitcoin.\n\nNow, here are some general points of interests to help you understand cold storage wallets:\n\n1. There is a big misconception that if you decide to operate as your own bank (i.e.truly own your Bitcoin) and use a cold storage wallet device (i.e. physical hardware connected via USB to your PC), that your assets (Bitcoin) will be transferred and stored onto that physical USB device. This is the part that confuses a lot of people. In short, Bitcoin is not stored on that device, it will never be stored there, and this is because Bitcoin can never leave its \"blockchain\".\n\n2. So, what does your cold storage device do? The device allows you to have a \"key\" to your asset (Bitcoin) on the blockchain. How is this \"key\" established? Without going too deep into the technical aspects, when you initially setup the hardware wallet device, you will be given a 24-word \"seed phrase\" and it is literally 24 words. From a computer science perspective, this 24-word \"seed phrase\" actually represents and is transcribed into a huge series/string of alphanumeric characters. This 24-word \"seed phrase\" is essentially your \"keys\" to your assets on the blockchain.\n\n3. Your 24-word \"seed phrase\" is what is most important if you decide to act as your own bank and truly own Bitcoin since this is what gives you access to it. It does not matter if you lose your physical device and it does not matter if your physical device was destroyed. Why? Again, your assets are on the blockchain and not on the physical device. So, if you lose your physical device, you can simply replace it with another one (and this can be one from a different manufacturer too), set it up with your original 24-word \"seed phrase\" and you will once again have access to your assets since they are on the blockchain. In essence, never lose your \"keys\" because then you will have truly lost your Bitcoin. \n\n4. As you can probably see now, your 24-word \"seed phrase\" is extremely important (and more important than the physical hardware device itself). Therefore, when you first take note of your 24-word \"seed phrase\" during the initial setup of your physical hardware device, make sure that no one is watching, there are no cameras around you (including your mobile phone), etc. Only you should know your \"keys\". Never type it out on any digital device, never e-mail it to yourself, never take a photo of it, never upload it to a cloud database such as Google Docs and never try to encrypt it and put it on a regular USB drive. You want this 24-word seed phrase as private as possible. So, if anyone/anything asks you for your \"keys\", never give it out. Period.\n\n5. What is a blockchain? It is a transparent, public, and append-only ledger. Basically, you can add data to this transparent, open, and public ledger, but you can never edit/delete previously established data within it. This is executed by a mechanism of consensus creation between geographically scattered parties (i.e. computers) that do not need to trust each other. The parties only need to trust the consensus mechanism itself. Blockchain infrastructure relies on some form of challenge such that no single party on the network can consistently and systematically solve this challenge more than everyone else on the network. This randomizes the consensus mechanism of confirming transactions and ensures that no single party can force the blockchain ledger to accept a particular entry onto the ledger that others disagree with. This is a peer-to-peer network that can maintain updates to the ledger and verify those updates in such a way that it is impossible to defraud and impossible to alter an entry after it has been confirmed via consensus.\n\nI sincerely hope that this has been helpful to you and good luck!",

Right now the S&amp;P 500 is a high P/E, high growth-dependent ETF whereas TD is probably set up to do well if interest rates rise - things are just a little easier for them in those environments. \n\nHave you considered any all-in-one ETFs that give you Canadian equity and fixed-income exposure as well? Maybe not much fixed-income considering your age and income needs (I'm assuming you'll be getting enough from your employment), but there are all-in-one ETFs that are 100% equities, just different allocations to each region (Canada, U.S., Europe, Emerging Markets, etc). \n\nYou're young - keep the fees ultra-low, and find your motivation to stay invested. Many successful investors use dividends as a motivator. Even though they theoretically don't change an investor's total returns (the share price is automatically reduced by the exchange on the stock's ex-dividend date), the psychology of receiving a regular stream of payments is enough to keep them focused on their long-term plan. Once you find your motivator for staying invested even through the hard times, you'll find the keys to long-term success.\n\nGood luck!",

While I was waiting for my fresh tropical juice smoothie, I overheard two men talking. \n\n\n\"Geez, Bill. That Conga line really took it out of me!\" Said one of the men, clean shaven except a bristly mustache above his lip. \n\n\n\"I know, Ted. My legs are on fire!

Tropical line dancing sounded so amazing to do right now. I grabbed my drink and sped off over the sand dune towards the sound of music. \n\n\nI followed the music into a secluded opening in a patch of palm trees and undergrowth. There, to my horror, was thirty men in a circle, each fucking the ass of the man in front of him while simultaneously being fucked from behind. \n\n\nMany years later I heard this is sometimes called a \"daisy chain\", or a \"gay Conga line\". \n\n\nIt's the second gayest thing I've ever seen, next to Jim Cramer.",

It is rewarding to see my effort starting to pay out!  I'm also starting to realize that writing losing option contracts with level-1 access, while not impossible, is unlikely as long as a little effort is applied.  I think the biggest risk is being flagged as a Pattern Day Trader, which could happen even without options access.  \n\nHad Fidelity just handed me the keys and left me to my own devices I would have been overwhelmed and most likely royally screwed up my account, or worse.  \n\nBTW, selling covered calls has a '*hidden*' benefit I hadn't anticipated, which is simply amazing.   \n The anxiety of watching the price of the stock I own fall or trade sideways is GONE!  \n\n* Stock price went down?  Excellent, I can buy my calls back sooner and sell them again and make money.\n* Stock price went WAY down?  Excellent, I can buy more stock and my calls back sooner and sell more calls and make money.\n* Stock price went sideways?

I have REEMF + REZZF + ALYI + TLOFF + ILHMF + SXOOF + UAMY + FCSMF + MLLOF + HNCKF + COCBF + MNGG + BMIX\n\nhttps://ragingbull.com/kb/how-to-make-money-with-penny-stocks/\n\nPennystocks can be a way to multiply your money but you can also lose it all. You should only put a small percentage of your portfolio on these cheap stocks .\n\nOtcmarkets.com you can see pennystocks that are being sold ,\u00a0 up to date news by ticker + screener. Some stocks have warnings. \n\nUnbiastock.com shows you stocks that are trading last hour or 6-12-24.\n\nFinviz.com is a stock screener with many filters but only non-OTC .\n\nMy stock portfolio is a free app to monitor your portfolio .\n\nYou can also request email alerts from the ARK website with their daily trades of their extremely popular ETFs.\n\nTD Ameritrade lets you buy almost any stock.\u00a0 RH and Webull don't allow OTC and most pennystocks are OTC. Fidelity also good but occasionally don't offer a stock. \n\nI trade 4-5 stocks daily but that is cuz I'm on my phone most of the day monitoring my 64 stock portfolio and seeing what others recommend or what is selling .\n\nThe general advice for pennystocks is to trade not invest . Occasionally you find a winner that you keep and might add to your holds. You make more money with several 20% short trades that add up over time vs chasing winners and losing money in the process. \n\nWe all make the mistake of getting in late, or selling too early . \n\nI don't do what some do like deeply research a company Sec filings , balance sheet etc. \n\nI go to Yahoo Finance free app and click View All. Check 50/200 MA + Float: ideally under 100M or much smaller.\u00a0 Ideally the numbers at the bottom like earnings growth,\u00a0 operating income,\u00a0 EBITDA should be positive but rarely the case with pennystocks or companies that are growing. \n\nBillions of shares in a pennystock is a warning sign of a pump and dump, so is a price graph that has straight lines up, down and horizontal instead of the standard gradual curve .\n\nBefore a purchase I check Yahoo Finance conversations. You can see how much interest by number of new conversations.\u00a0 Also good info from posters that know about the company.\u00a0 Volume too is important.\u00a0 Should be much higher than usual.\n\nI also go to Stocktwits for the same .\n\nSomeone pointed out that companies that price rises 100% in last year or months will probably keep going . This is very true in pennystocks. \n\nBut these sites + Reddit are full of pumpers and dumpers.\u00a0 So read through the lines.\n\nFinally when a stock seems a winner by the point it crosses 100% for you many recoup investment.\u00a0 I wait until 220-240% so I only have to sell 30% of stocks not 50%. This threshold usually happens in one day. A stock goes up gradually for days or weeks then suddenly flies. \n\nIf you are using RH or WB that don't allow pennystocks there is a subreddit r/RobinHoodPennyStocks .\nOn NASDAQ many options like CTRM + SNDL + DGLY + HIMX + CIDM + NOK + ATOM+ ENG \n\nhttps://www.allpennystocks.com/hotpennystocks/nsd.aspx",

We constantly make clear that you  should not build a portfolio based on what we do because we're  smooth-brained, crayon-eating fucking apes who don't even have an exit  strategy. We do that for a reason. Nobody lost money because of DFV. If  anyone who isn't a hedgie or an astroturf alias of one lost money, it's  because they followed self-described morons when they were openly  talking about how unsound their financial strategy was.\n\nI'll  tell you who does cause investors to lose money: the fucking hedges.  They find an easy target to fucking destroy, then they use strategies  like naked shorting, shit that should be illegal, to manipulate the  market and artificially inflate their short position, then destroy their  easy targets using lies and criminal behavior. They dredge up literal  fake news stories, feed it to the press, and those dumbasses somehow eat  the shit up, then broadcast that bullshit it to the whole country and  world. The hedgies literally manipulate the market, What causes these  bubbles and market manipulation is these shorting practices which any  ape in ECON102 would tell you is fucking dangerous. If we can  \"manipulate\" the market by just holding shares and not fucking doing  anything with them, then just make memes about it, the architects of  that market are probably fucking troglodytes.\n\nI  can't believe these dumbasses are investigating a YouTuber / Redditor, not people who actually hold the necessary power to engage in  financial practices that caused a panic to be possible. They're  interrogating everyday schmucks who engage in literally just having  shares, and those responsible are laughing their asses all the way to  the fucking bank. If the morons in MA are actually dumb enough to blame  us, this is only the first bet of many. The media will move on, but  we'll still be here making bets that stick it to the fucking rich pricks  and powerful morons standing between us and crispy motherfucking  chicken tendies.",

        "body": "Last week saw some recovery for the hard hit tech and growth stocks as investors became slightly more comfortable with inflation forecasts, meaning US bond yields tapered off, which raised stock prices *(they essentially have an inverse relationship, as one rises, the other drops).* In addition, the $1.9 trillion stimulus bill was completed by the US govt.\n\nFor some, reduced stock prices provided a buying opportunity, or at least an opportunity to average down the cost of some of the positions.\n\nI don\u2019t expect us to be fully out of the woods yet in terms or recovery, with monday market opening likely to be red all over, as late on friday, bond yields jumped again following low demand for US govt bonds in auction *(when you take into account inflation, the yields on those bonds means you essentially have less money value than what you invested),* however, that should reduce by end of the week.\n\nStill bullish\n\nTaking a step back and Looking at the overall market, this correction was not just healthy, but overdue. While some assets are still overpriced, overall economy recovery provide a good backdrop for further mark growth, at least in the short-medium term. This current period provides an opportunity to *\u201cbuy the dip\u201c* on stocks which have a solid future, but also to reap the gain from some sectors that will see rapid growth over the next year. After all, rising inflation forecasts are due to the fact that most economists see the world economies recovering rapidly from the return of normality from COVID.\n\nWhat will be the recovering sectors?\n\nIn short, think of any the stocks that you have not been able to use or shop from over the last year.\n\n* Airlines &amp; Travel\n* Hospitality\n* Manufacturing\n* Consumer cyclical\n* Events\n* Retail\n\nBuzzing stocks this week\n\nI have created an algorithm that tracks chatter on social media to identify which stocks are trending, by measuring the shift in mentions this week compared to previous week. Meme stocks are purposely filtered out here.\n\nThe full results can be found here: [https://buzzingstocks.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/March+Stocks+2-01.png](https://buzzingstocks.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/March+Stocks+2-01.png)\n\nHere\u2019s my commentary on the most interesting ones in there:\n\n* **3D Systems, ticker: DDD**  \nSince the time of writing and creating this graph, this stock has shot up **%4.2** and up another **%1.5** in pre-market. Down from All-time high from earlier this year, DDD benefitted from analyst upgrades last week, as its price suffered a big tumble. Furthermore, ARK initiated DDD position in ARKQ (Autonomous Technology &amp; Robotics) ETF yesterday, putting it in the same basket as TSLA. Expect further gains short-term, and high volatility.\n* **Accsys Technologies, ticker: AXS**  \nThis is a very interesting one, especially long-term. A sustainable wood company that produces high technology, alloy-like wood, planting a tree for every one it chops down. Has recently completed the building of 2 large production factories. I might even cover this on a separate article. ***Note:*** *This company has a small market cap, meaning a low number of shares traded, which means it could take longer than you\u2019d like to buy/sell your shares.*\n* **Vermilion Energy Inc, ticker: VET**  \nSaw a price jump as analysts upgraded its price target last week. Energy companies are rising as demand is forecast to increase over the next few months. Not sure how this one will move in the near-future, one to watch.\n* **Teradyne, ticker: TER**  \nAnother one seeing lots of chatter on the back of ARK positioning. This one is a very exciting prospect to me, and ticks A LOT of boxes, most importantly, very solid finances. The company saw Earnings per share *(total earnings of the company, divided by number of shares, the higher the better)* growth of 64% last year.\n\nSummary\n\nExpect a less wild ride next week than the last few weeks, but still with some turbulence. Reduced prices have created a number of opportunities, which are being picked up by the algorithm.\n\nWhile there is likely still some downside in the market, longer-term I see a rosier picture, especially as economies recover and return to normality. I see now as an opportunity to purchase some opportunities at strategic prices, as well as a time to rotate into some of the recovery stocks, taking some profits from the growth/tech sectors along the way.\n\nWhat are your plans for the week? Let me know in the replies\n\n***None of this is financial advice, please do your own research on any stocks highlighted above.***",

        "body": "Looking for cheap Index ETFs for my portfolio. I earn in CHF and spend mostly in CHF and EUR.\n\nFor my S&amp;P500 I have picked Vanguard (VUSA) because of the low TER. Now, I have a few options on how to buy it:\n\n\\- SIX Swiss Exchange (in CHF), would be the cheapest fees (and no FX), it trades at a volume of \\~180k USD \n\n\\- Amsterdam Euronext (in EUR), low fees (but a bit pricier), trades \\~6.5m USD/day\n\n\\- London LSE (in USD), this would be the priciest, trades \\~10m USD/day in volume\n\n\\- London in GBP, I don't see the upside of trading this\n\nThe differences in commissions at the amounts I invest will be \\~0.5% more expensive in LSE than in SIX, with Amsterdam somewhat halfway.\n\nIn what exchange would you recommend I invest? Should I prioritize minimizing fees (by investing in CHF), or higher volume exchanges? Is there any upside to trading it in USD as it's a US stock ETF? I assume underlying prices are just corrected by FX so there should be no hidden cost there? \n\nThank you",
