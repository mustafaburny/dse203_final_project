They (and Siemens with Mentor) hold pretty much the entire EDA design market share but anyone who's used the tech knows that the EDA design industry is pretty much stuck in the 90s. This makes them particularly vulnerable to disruption. HLS is showing promise for FPGA and potentially for ASIC too, and from what I've heard, Synopsys barely has a product in this space, and Cadence's HLS product isn't really competitive either. I anticipate that they'll continue to grow revenues with semiconductor demand, but I'm not sure the high valuations are justified (40 forward pe on CDNS is a bit high imo).",
