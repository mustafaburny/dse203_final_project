Last year they sold off their entire memory business to SK Hynix, now they're outsourcing their silicon manufacturing to TSMC, revenue and net income is trending down (-1% Y/Y), cash on hand is down 45%. Clearly it's a company in decline right now, which is why the P/E is so low.\r  \n\r  \nHigh end semiconductor is a very zero-sum game, every processor sale loss by intel is a sale gained by AMD. If you look at AMD stock they're revenue is up 99.3% Y/Y and net income up 353% Y/Y (mostly due to COVID, but intel had same situation). AMD's revenue wasn't much of a threat to Intel previously. In Q2 2020 AMD made $1.93 billion and Intel $19.7 billion, now AMD is at $3.85 billion and are starting to make significant impact on Intel's numbers.\r  \n\r  \nIntel knew they were on a shit trajectory, that's why they fired their bean counter CEO at the start of this year. However after 8 years of bean counting and coasting on their legacy it's hard to just turn the company around on a dime. I like their new CEO Pat Gelsinger, he has good vision and plans for the company, however I need proof that they can actually execute before I touch Intel.\n\nTheir numbers will continue trending down in the short term, it will be 2 years before the new chip fabs under Pat Gelsinger come online. If AMD keeps their pace of growth at 50%, and continue to execute as well as they have been, then AMD's quarterly revenue would continue to grow to $8.7 billion.  Assuming that increase all comes out of Intel's lunch then Intel's revenue would be declining from $19.6 billion to $14.8 billion (-25%) over the next two years.",

PLTR is currently at a market cap of 45B, so roughly valued at a third of AMD. But last year AMD\u2019s revenue was 3.85B, PLTR was 0.3B. So we have AMD at 3x the market cap, but 10x revenue. Now of course PLTR is growing fast, but the 800M Army contract just announced is a 7yr contract. So ok a nice 100M per year\u2026 that\u2019s what AMD makes every 10 days. \n\nPLTR just is priced for massive growth and needs to grow into it, if they don\u2019t there is massive downside compared to AMD. If their growth rate slows down, it could kill the stock price.\n\nWe also know the fed is planning to raise interest rates in coming years, and that will effect future discounted cash flows and disproportionately hurt the valuation of high growth names (because at higher rates, the future cash flows get discounted more, and don\u2019t look as attractive in today\u2019s dollars). This could effect AMD, but would have a much bigger effect on PLTR.",

You have to learn to not panic and hold through lows. Sure maybe the first stock you bought was Tesla, then you took your gains to spy, amd, google, all things that have had a solid bull run. But there will be times where you get hit with a bear market, and you must learn the self control to come out on top. \n \nPls I get it maybe you inherited or were given or simply had so much money to begin with that the abundance completely outweighed any potential loss and you never felt these emotions, but there are millions of people out there who are less fortunate and trying to better themselves and each dollar lost will feel like a million at first.

The put you purchased allows you to sell 100 shares of AMD at $85 theoretically limiting your downside to $250 per contract. \n\nThe reason you can\u2019t close the spread is that it is so far out of the money that no one is interested in these strike prices. A money maker may take a few dollars off your hands to buy an essentially worthless contract but no one will sell you one to close both sides. If you close the short position (by buying to close a contract) you will be left with owning an essentially worthless put but with no risk if a black swan event happens. \n\nThe trade worked out exactly right for you. You collected premium and the stock moved the right way. I would just better understand the assignment risk you are taking and which half is the short side. That risk is what wipes out beginning options investors.",

        "body": "Personally I think people are blowing the ARM threat completely out of proportion. In my view the concern it poses is that ARM will allow more companies to develop their own in house design plus a new  CPU competitors will enter the market. That being said Intel has an enormous amount of advantages over any possible entrant into the CPU space. Lets not forget they've been in this position for the majority of their corporate history. They fought Power PC and won. They competed in against a multitude of x86 vendors which they brutally destroyed like DEC, Cyrix [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\\_of\\_x86\\_manufacturers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_x86_manufacturers) the only exception is AMD which itself has almost died multiple times. Had Intel not rested on their laurels AMD would be dead now too and this is coming from someone who loves AMD to death. (I bought AMD @ $4 back in 2014). \n\nNot only does Intel have some of the best CPU designers in the industry their Roadmap is insane. They are planning on marrying together all of their IP CPU, GPU, FPGA's, Memory, Software and all the other random highly competitive stuff intel does. I think Big.Little married with chiplets and AI accelerators will be a game changer. The only other company I see approaching this scale of capability is AMD. I also don't think every single company will have their own inhouse designs, building CPU's is very expensive and complicated. The expertise is limited and you open yourself up to a whole host of complications. Yes it makes sense for Apple, Amazon, Microsoft etc. But the small to medium sized players will still need a common platform if they want to exist. \n\nThe Foundry is a risk yes but I believe Intel has the finances and talent necessary to figure out this problem. Perhaps they could even go license a new node from Samsung similar to Global foundries. Or maybe Intel and Samsung partner up to develop new nodes to take on TSMC. To me its not a crazy though that Intel and Apple might partner up on the manufacturing side either. Apple has tried to be less dependent on TSMC by leveraging Global Foundries but they just could keep up with TSMC. I don't think anyone wants to be in a situation where there is one FAB to rule them all especially with the geopolitical risks. I'm willing to bet that their massive war chest will help them solve this problem. If not they can always pull an AMD and sell the fab.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn my opinion Intel's problems have been self inflicted by poor management under Brian Krzanich. They got lazy meanwhile and AMD came in and smashed them. Imagine if Intel began doing their plans 10 years ago? What would the market would look like? The missing element is aggressive management hopefully Pat and Intel's $20 Billion in annual profit will be the answer. The downside is large if the fail yes but the upside is also huge. Imagine Intel retuned as a vertically integrated AI powerhouse that brings giant leaps in performance with every new generation. Intel is the only company in the world capable of doing this. People are underestimating Intel just as they underestimated AMD its a complex situation and takes time to play out but if anyone can pull it off its Intel.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSee Moore's law is dead for more info on the tech\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g44zQII9GV4",

That's a contradiction, how does short interest drop from 121% to 25% SU,  which means they covered A LOT of shares but wasnt behind the price action from GME on January 1st(20-483$).

Intel's main business is in data centres, I think something close to 99% of data centres use Intel, and the big 3 are Google, Microsoft, and Amazon. While Apple is very unlikely to start supplying their chips to other companies, what they have done is proven to everyone just how powerful and efficient ARM chips can be and what happens when you drop a stagnant supplier.\n\nApple may not supply chips but other companies will. We now know that Microsoft and Amazon are working on custom ARM chips for their own data centres, and we also know that the world's most powerful supercomputer runs on ARM chips too. Intel has slept through all of this thinking their ~99% data centre marketshare is safe, but they will very quickly begin to lose marketshare once Microsoft and Amazon are happy with their ARM developments. This is without even mentioning AMD which is also making strides.\n\nI just see it as Intel will begin to shrink and pivot their business a bit, I don't think they'll disappear but I wouldn't expect much growth either. They could make and supply ARM chips themselves, but they don't make nearly as much money as Apple, Google, Microsoft, Amazon, so they won't be able to afford the same engineers who can make such developments. One of the main reasons Apple's chips have been so successful is because they can afford to throw *a lot* of money at it.",

You seem to have a good understanding of these companies what they do, how they make money, etc. And it is totally correct that AMD and NVDA will likely continue to grow at a faster rate than Intel, but I think it is very important to also consider the price you are paying for a stock. At the end of the day a good company can still be priced too high to buy into with any real margin of safety and in my opinion that is the case with both AMD and NVDA. Personally I like discounted free cashflow to determine fair value and if analyst's estimates for revenues over the next 5-10 years are even remotely accurate (which they usually are) AMD and NVDA both look to be trading at much higher prices than what I calculate their intrinsic values to be. Intel is around or a bit below its fair value depending on what numbers you use, but of course there are reasons it is being valued much lower than the other two.\n\ntldr; IMHO (strictly my humble opinion and in NO WAY financial advice): AMD and NVDA are trading too far above intrinsic value to be good buys, and of course even if Intel's stock price looks attractive if you do not like their business prospects for the coming years it may not be a good buy either so I guess I didn't really help you at all lol",

The Fidelity indexes are good because their expense ratios are typically 0.01-0.02% since a computer is doing all the work instead of a human investment advisor. Higher expense ratios aren't necessarily bad if the human-operated fund beats the computer-operated fund by a large enough margin, but that happens less often than you might think.\n\nI'm a relatively risk averse person who nonetheless understands that the optimal amount of risk is not zero, so my investing paradigm is to invest more in lower-risk ventures and less in higher-risk ones.\n\nMy retirement savings are roughly:\n\n* 28% target-date fund (pre-tax account)\n* 22% Fidelity 500 (pre-tax account)\n* 17% Fidelity Mid Cap (pre-tax account)\n* 13% Fidelity Small Cap (pre-tax account)\n* 20% speculative investments in a slew of stocks with high growth potential (post-tax account)\n\nYour mix could look different depending on your own risk tolerance, but for my 2c it helps steel my nerves enough to take the bigger swings like in my post-tax account if I'm only swinging with a small percentage of my savings and the majority of it is in a safer place. There's always a trade-off between risk and reward, you will need to find the sweet spot where you feel most comfortable. At some point you may realize you're not comfortable with as much risk as you thought, and at some point you may realize that you'd be comfortable with more risk, and you can change your 401k allocations along the way to match your comfort level.",

It's far more secure and it's even quicker than pulling up an OTP code for sites that support the FIDO protocol directly, such as Coinbase and Gemini. For sites that don't support FIDO and still use OTP (what Authy/Google Auth is), Yubikey can do those too with a Yubico Authenicator app which requires your key to generate the codes.\n\nYubico's site has excellent setup guides and FAQs to get things going. The only downside is the expense, as you want to buy multiple keys to have a backup incase you lose your primary. But, if you've got a decent chunk of money to protect, spending a hundred bucks for a couple Yubikeys is well worth the vastly improved security.\n\nTradFi is so behind crypto on security models, it's insane. For Fidelity, TDA, and my three banks, they *all* only have SMS 2FA as an option, not even OTP. And for my trading platform, ThinkOrSwim, it doesn't have any 2FA at all to login and make trades.

But that\u2019s mostly because they haven\u2019t seen the historical data (hundreds of years of it). And they tend to draw a false equivalency between options trading/gambling and dollar-cost-averaging into VT or VTI\n\nI think a lot of it comes from accessibility and family influence: back in the day it used to cost a bunch of money to trade and it was super hard to do so most didn\u2019t even bother. And if your parents don\u2019t know anything about stocks, they won\u2019t teach you. I was lucky in that I grew up in a very stock-friendly household with CNBC going 24/7. I was aware of the market in elementary school lol but I recognize this isn\u2019t how most people grew up\n\nAnyways, yeah there\u2019s usually no need for financial advisors. Odds are they\u2019ll get complicated, try to get fees out of you and whatever they tell you will probably underperform VT or VTI anyway. Great choice with Fidelity by the way, they\u2019re an excellent broker. And even if you lost money giving into the hype on CLOV, hopefully you can consider it a cheap \u201cintro to the stock market course\u201d because at least it got you more involved\n\nAlso, just want to mention that there\u2019s probably no need to own VTI and VT/VXUS. If you already own all 3, I wouldn\u2019t bother selling though. Basically VTI is total US stock market, VT is total all stock market and VXUS is total non-US stock market so VT is just a combination of VTI/VXUS. Currently it\u2019s about 62% VTI and 38% VXUS because of the size of the US market but it\u2019s up to you how much you want to weight international. I tend to go less as I have a bit of a preference toward US stocks so I like the weighting you currently have\n\nAnd yeah, I still check my brokerage app way too often but oh well. Just don\u2019t ever panic sell even if the market crashes and try not to act on emotion. I remember people selling when the market was down 7-10% per day during March 2020, thinking they\u2019d buy back later, meanwhile I bought the entire time and the market rallied extremely quickly. Some are still waiting on the sidelines hoping they\u2019ll get the correction they were hoping for. Just remember the two key phrases \u201cmore money has been lost trying to anticipate corrections than lost in the corrections themselves\u201d and \u201ctime in the market beats timing the market\u201d",

I currently have $6,500 split between VOO and VOOV. Based on my amateur research, it seems that for long term gains I should be investing in international, not US, because the US economy isn't looking too great in the long term. Someone on this subreddit suggested VXUS, but Fidelity shows that fund as \"weak\" across the short/mid/long term. Are there any international funds that are a better bet? Thanks!",

Wallstreet  again could care less about politics, you call me naive yet you reference YouTube as a place where you think anti Chinese sentiment is driving the equities markets. Are you listening to yourself? Wallstreet doesn't care what some random Youtuber with 200 subs feels about China. It's all about earnings reports and going through them with a fine tooth comb. However when a good company like BABA is being attacked by a whole ass country, smart money gets out and waits to see what shoe will drop next. No amount of great earnings reports can combat Xi deciding to simply shut down BABA. As far as you not wanting Chinese stocks in Western markets, be careful what you wish for, the only reason BABA's market cap is what it is today is because of Western money. If all Chinese stocks get delisted, they lose 95% of their value instantly. China alone will not be able to keep BABA's MC $500 bil+",

        "body": "Great question! Yes, you can calculate the probability of touch for a *fixed* target stock price in closed-form. The issue we have to address is the fact that, in our case, the target stock price is changing every day we hold the position! \n\nIt's better to explain this with an example:\n\nSay we sell a $1.00 put that expires in 45 Days. We will hold this position until expiration BUT we will close it if we hit 50% of max profit ($0.5). What is the probability of hitting 50% of max profit up until expiration?\n\nAt 45 DTE: you've just opened the position. In order for you to close the position, the short put value has to drop to $0.5. What stock price corresponds to this short put value? If we know the corresponding stock price we can use the Brownian Motion model to calculate the Probability of Touch (PTO) at 45 DTE. Well, we could use the Black-Scholes model to establish the relationship between stock price and options value. This model is pretty complex that takes in multiple inputs like time till expiration, volatility, etc. Great, we can now calculate the 'target' stock price and its corresponding PTO at 45 DTE!\n\nat 44 DTE: Unfortunately, you didn't hit the target stock price at 45 DTE so what's the PTO at 44 DTE? You still need a short put value of $0.5. What stock price corresponds to this short put value? We can use the Black-Scholes model again but now you're inputting different values for time till expiration, volatility, etc. Your target stock price is now different and so is your PTO at 44 DTE.\n\nYou can collect **all** the PTO's for every day up until expiration and do some fancy math to calculate the probability of hitting 50% of max profit up until expiration. But here's the problem: The Black-Scholes model is pretty complex and, to my knowledge, there is no closed-form way of calculating the corresponding stock price given an options value with this model; you would need to use numerical methods to do it. Hence, there is no closed-form way to calculate the probability of hitting 50% of max profit up until expiration.\n\nThe above strategy for calculating the probability of hitting 50% of max profit is plausible but not the same as Monte Carlo Simulations. I thought it would be easier to highlight the complexity of the problem by explaining that strategy. Monte Carlo takes a more stochastic approach where *thousands* of individual simulations are run for the stock price and a probability is averaged out. It's better explained on the website. You could think of it as a more brute-force approach relative to the other strategy with the downside of lower accuracy and being more computationally heavy. However, the upside with Monte Carlo is that you can use much more complex models with it if you wanted to. Maybe you don't want to use Black-Scholes and wanted to use a more complex options pricing model. Maybe you don't want to assume that IV is constant and wanted to use an IV model. Monte Carlo would be a much better choice for these situations. \n\nHope this answers your question!",

Citadel internalise that order and shits out and IOU for you. \n\nAll good so far right?\n\nBut Citadel as MM dont like to cover during major volatility so they keep taking these 50/60/70..$ orders while internalising order flow from RH or other PFOF broker(basically assuming short position), they know from experience that 99.99% of the time markets will calm down, the price will drop and they will be able to secure shares for favorable price to deliver them. PLEASE LET ME CLEAR THAT MOST OF THE TIME ITS DONE UNWILLINGLY BY ALGOS THAT RUN THE MARKET.\n\nSo what happened is that when GME started blowing  up at December/Early January algos took these 20/30/40$ orders gave out IOUs but never delivered actual shares. By mid Jan, some1 got margin call and realised that GME situation is that 00.01% event and now they are on the hook for 2700% payout compared to what they took in. \n\nThats why only PFOF brokers had to turn off buy button, because unlike brokers like fidelity that actually got their shares delivered they only had IOU but not the share and as soon as some1 pressed Sell button they had to pay from their own pocket the difference hence all the liquidity issues.",
