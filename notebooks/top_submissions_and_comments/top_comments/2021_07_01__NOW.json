So finding anything new is difficult. Imho, that's intentional tactic to hide the lack of content.\n3) My native language is Russian, but I live in Poland. Netflix thinks that it knows their customer better and doesn't offer me the selection of Russian subtitles even though those exist in Russia. I can select only Polish or English.\n\nThe only reason I still use Netflix is cause it's free for me due to a certain promotion.

My cost average is low, I'm up significantly and over the past 4 months and there has been significant price consolidation around the $150-200 price point. I would go into more about the business transition into an e-commerce giant, but there's just too many points to list and I can't be bothered on a Sunday night. The subs on this stock are kinda chaotic now with drama, so I don't blame anyone for not wanting to touch it.

        "body": "I work directly in the foreclosure area for one of the biggest banks in the US.  The foreclosure dam is getting ready to burst at the seams again.  Not quite like the crisis but not far from it either.  The emphasis has been to get all these people on loan assistance (forbearance/loan mods) etc., to hold back the flood gates.  So far it's simply putting a bandaid on a bullet hole.  With the US CFPB directions we'll be doing that until the end of the year.  But the jobs that most of these people lost aren't coming back or back in the same capacity as before.  Many are in a continual loop of modifying or forbearance and defaulting on new terms every few months if not every month.  There's only so many times we can change the terms.  CFPB is trying to make it nearly impossible to deny loan mods basically minimal documentation, take their word for it now.  But they keep defaulting regardless.  I have many friends and family that have been trying to buy a house and are being outbid left and right.  People are taking advantage of low rates, which is good but they're overpaying on property that isn't nearly worth what they're financing for.  Driving up market price everywhere and property taxes and causing a bubble to form as these properties values will flip come next year.  All the information we receive from the government is that come Jan 1, 2022 all these borrowers are SOL and no further assistance will be provided.  We've a few hundred thousand loans in default that are marinating in the forbearance/loan mod stew.  I'm pretty sure every bank in the country has a sizable amount of loans that are in the forbearance/loan mod purgatory, waiting to move to foreclosure.  Come Jan 1, there will be some major changes to the housing market if enough people default on their new terms which they already are.  If you're looking to buy a house wait until end of first quarter beginning of second next year.  If the government doesn't take action which is what we've been told they won't do then there'll be an overabundance of foreclosures on the market again and prices should fall.",
