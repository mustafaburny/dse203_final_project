So finding anything new is difficult. Imho, that's intentional tactic to hide the lack of content.\n3) My native language is Russian, but I live in Poland. Netflix thinks that it knows their customer better and doesn't offer me the selection of Russian subtitles even though those exist in Russia. I can select only Polish or English.\n\nThe only reason I still use Netflix is cause it's free for me due to a certain promotion.

Companies arent being valued as \u201clargest, second largest, third largest\u201d they're being valued as cash-flowing productive assets. \n\nIf aapl produced better earnings, it would increase in price because dividends and buybacks can increase. The potential dividends and buybacks create the floor on the asset. \n\nLet's say someone says \u201cno way aapl could be worth $4 trillion!\u201d what if they doubled revenue and earnings? If the price didn't change that means it would be trading at 16 p/e, and sub 3 p/s, which would make it firmly one of the cheapest blue chips on the market, everyone would be buying it. \n\nI remember seeing people say the same thing about aapl when it was the largest company in the world and the first to break $1T. Now it's doubled. There is little doubt in my mind we will see the first $10T in the next couple decades. I don't know if it will be aapl, but I think many companies will hit that market cap.",

My account was breached these past few weeks and I couldn\u2019t do anything about it.\n\nThe hacker logged into my account and loaded up on 7/16 SPY $415 puts starting 6/18 and averaged down all the way to today.\n\nThis person knew my password, had access to my phone and my finger prints. The sick bastard even knew my mother\u2019s maiden name. I know I couldn\u2019t believe it either. He needs to be stopped.\n\nSPY is now trading at $433.72 and each of those contracts is worth $57 now from almost $513. Rent is coming up so I\u2019m going to need my money back.\n\nThanks again,\n\n/r/wallstreetbets bear",

The biggest concern with the delta variant isn't about how it affects the US, it's about how it affects overseas markets that operate the supply chain and transport goods and whose declines negatively affect the US economy. It's true that as you say the US will probably be fine and not go into any more lockdowns, but that doesn't seem to be the case for the rest of the world right now, especially China and other Asian markets.

Facebook was in trouble for collecting data without content too. Remember the whole Cambridge Analytica scandal? But now everyone is hot for FB stocks.\n\nMicrosoft has been fined millions by the EU for monopolistic practices as well. But everyone loves Microsoft stocks nonetheless. \n\nAnd as to Ant Group, they are a massive financial service company that can offer customers credit. How come they don't get to be regulated like a bank? My point is that these actions make sense and good regulations is beneficial for investors too in the long run.",

Then ehhhhh.  4. Dont believe anyone in here is your friend, on your side, trustworthy, or doing anything other than pumping their own personal position to lighten bags. After awhile you'll start to notice a pattern. Actual good DD, about an actual unknown company. Pops up now and then. And slowly fades away. Later on, once its run up already.

Not good or bad just changed.\n\nIt's been all over the place since last year between Vogel and Wu. But this is the final iteration it seems.\n\nThe last iteration was\nWu: 25% locked for 1 year unless above $15 for 20 days. 75% two year locked \n\nOther Microvast shareholders: 6 months\n\nVogel/Tuscan: \n50% is locked for 1 year, unless it trades above $12.50 for 20 days. The other 50% is locked for 2 years.\n\n\n\n**Now it is**\nWu: 25% locked for 1 year unless above $15 for 20 days. 75% two year locked. (Yes unchanged)\n\nOther Microvast shareholders: 6 months\n\nVogel/Tuscan:\n**READ THIS CAREFULLY**\n \nOf 75% of shares, 67% of the shares are locked for 1 year unless above $12.50 for 20 days. The other 33% is locked for 1 year regardless of price. \n\nOf the other 25% of shares, 50% is locked for 1 year unless it trades over $12 for 20 days. The other 50% is locked for 1 year unless it trades over 15. However he will lose his shares if none of these conditions are met.\n\nThese lockups are fairly similar (e.g 67% of 75% is 50%). I don't know if he's fucking with me or I'm just stupid). In summarize it's leaning more positive in my opinion that Vogel got himself a poor man's \"FDs\" and is either bullish or likes to gamble. Can slightly sell more now if it goes up, but will forfeit ownership to them for $0 if it doesn't.",
