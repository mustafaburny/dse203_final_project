Obviously both do plenty of volume in debit and credit, but generally Visa is a more familiar card, particularly in the US, since everyone has a debit card, and then a 50/50 chance of credit card being one or the other. I've had six or seven banks over the years, with national names, and only one used MA. So brand familiarity may be a driver here. And if you want to take that a step further, some beliefs about credit card usage declining may push favor to Visa. I don't have the hard data to back that up, but it's a theory floated by some of the finance guys I've spoken with over the past year or so. Can neither confirm or deny, but maybe something to look into if you're interested in investing.",

He panicked ran out of his office, then his pants fell down and he tripped, and on the way down pulled down someone else's pants. And then that person fell down, and on the way down, pulled down someone's pants. And then that person pulled down someone's pants. And there was a pants down chain reaction which ultimately reached their server devs.\n\nThen, Emily Chang from Bloomburg technology and her filming camera crew reached Mark Zuckerburg for her scheduled interview. \n\nWith the broadcast live and Mark Zuckerburg caught with his pants down, his assistant handed him a phone, it was Eduardo Saverin. \n\nTurns out he purchased 3PL, a belt logistics company that supples belt prongs to belt manufacturers including the Etriviere by Hermes, Mark's favorite belt. Eduardo threatened to CEO of 3PL to send faulty prongs to Hermes, which made their way to Mark's belt, which snapped the second he put 3 Ns of torque when he panicked about the whistle blower news.\n\nEduardo planned the whole thing. And it was all worth seeing the look on Mark's face as his servers went down the second time.\n\nAll fashion companies cut ties to 3PL and Eduardo took a 50 million dollar loss, but it was all worth it.\n\nEdit:\n\nContext\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZ6ZlRnS40s&amp;feature=youtu.be",

Probably the best company to invest in terms of AI is Alphabet (Google).\n\nGoogle leads in every layer of the AI stack.\n\n\n\nSilicon is the bottom of the stack and Google TPUs are record setting with both training and inference.\n\n\"\"Cloud Google TPU Pods break AI training records\"\n\nhttps://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/cloud-tpu-pods-break-ai-training-records\n\nNext layer up is algorithms. The best way to score is papers accepted by the canonical AI research organization, NeurlIPS (Formerly NIPS). \n\nGoogle has lead in papers accepted every year by a HUGE margin. Here is 2019. But it was the same in 2010 and 2018, 2017, etc.\n \nhttps://imgur.com/ZWeeqUg\n \nThe next layer up above algorithms is data. Nobody and I mean nobody has the data that Google has and their data is so much more valuable.\n\nBecause Google data is private data. There is nothing more personal than the things you search on. But it is not just search. \nGoogle has the most video data with YouTube and Google Photos. The most emails with Gmail. The most mapping data with Google Maps. The list goes on and on.\n\nThen there is the applications. I am old and not seen anything in the technology space as impressive as this video.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBJ0GvsQeak&amp;feature=youtu.be\n\nI love the Google setup. They do the AI research in DeepMind and then apply it in other Alphabet units. Waymo is self driving cars. But there is so many other opportunities.\n\nAI/ML is also just perfect from a business perspective. There is nothing in this world that gets better on it's own the longer you own. Well besides something like maybe wine.\n\nThe core aspect of AI/ML is perfect for companies because it accelerates the lead of the first mover. Who gets out first and people start using the technology it improves at an accelerating rate and makes it a lot more difficult for the followers to compete.\nI believe the most important technology going forward is AI/ML.\n\nML - Machine Learning.",

        "body": "This just means that you do not understand the market, not that the market is wrong. The market is the market, its not supposed to be right or wrong as it reflects the thoughts of millions of people investing. But if you have to bet between whether you are right or the market is right, then you really should side with the market as you are really going against millions of people.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI do not follow visa and mastercard but this is common for a stock to fall after earnings even though its a beat, this is because stocks is not just about earnings, its about EVERYTHING, so dont just pay attention to earnings. Did they provide guidance for the next quarter for the next year? Often the guidance has a stronger effect than earnings as guidance is about the FUTURE and at the end of the day stocks reflects FUTURE value.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAdditionally, did the stock run up before earnings? Often many good companies before earnings, the stock will go up because investors anticipate good earnings. But once the earnings comes up it falls because it fell short of expectation. For example if in aggregate investors expect a 40% growth on the next earnings, then it will go up before earnings, this expectation is the overall expectation and NOT analyst expectation. This is an art as you have to decipher how the market feels like how you would decipher how much value a piece of antique is for auction. If on earnings day they release that they grew 35% when analysts expects 34%, well the following day the stock will fall as the stock has gone up with the valuation of growth of 40% so when it reports 35% even though analysts thinks its 34%, its going to tank. You also have to remember analyst expectations are not fluid that they are released on set dates, so by the actual earnings date the analyst might have changed their mind as they released it weeks ago but they do not give an update yet.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnother reason is also if a company tends to beat every earnings, say they usually beat expectations by 10% every quarter. The market knows to value this the next time. So when they only beat by 5%, well its gonna tank cuz the value of the stock went up to match a beat of 10% as everyone already expects this from recent history.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor the Tesla one, you seem bias against this company. You can see that they have made a profit excluding EV credits and even after bitcoin loss, so your sentence that they are using bitcoin and others to pad up their profit is false. Furthermore if you understand capital intensive businesses then you understand that there is a breakeven point to profitability, which Tesla just hit in the last year. Companies when they hit breakeven point, their profit grows faster than linear because every additional unit they make all a huge portion goes straight to profit whereas the units before the breakeven point a portion of it is used to cover for their fixed costs. Tesla's profit is going to grow much more than this as they are jsut at the beginning of their trajectory beyond their breakeven point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThey went up not just because of the Hertz deal but because of their growth in the last year where they have grown significantly like a tech company while the rest of the auto industry has declined in sales growth. All of this at the same time while their stock price remained the same in the last 6 months even after 3 quarters of good results. So the price is actually just catching up. Additionally the hertz deal is a big deal as they are currently delivering 800k units per year. 100k is 1/8th of this, which is huge percentage of their annual sales. They are looking to grow sales by 50% next year. well this 100k secures a portion of this growth already for the next year even though everyone knows that their backlog of order is massive. This secures their growth projection to at least 2023.",

Let me give you the inside scoop.\n\nMark Zuckerburg was BBQing some smoked meats inside his office when someone told him the news about the whistleblower. He panicked ran out of his office, then his pants fell down and he tripped, and on the way down pulled down someone else's pants. And then that person fell down, and on the way down, pulled down someone's pants. And then that person pulled down someone's pants. And there was a pants down chain reaction which ultimately reached their server devs.\n\nThen, Emily Chang from Bloomburg technology and her filming camera crew reached Mark Zuckerburg for her scheduled interview.\n\nWith the broadcast live and Mark Zuckerburg caught with his pants down, his assistant handed him a phone, it was Eduardo Saverin.\n\nTurns out he purchased 3PL, a belt logistics company that supples belt prongs to belt manufacturers including the Etriviere by Hermes, Mark's favorite belt. Eduardo threatened to CEO of 3PL to send faulty prongs to Hermes, which made their way to Mark's belt, which snapped the second he put 3 Ns of torque when he panicked about the whistle blower news.\n\nEduardo planned the whole thing. And it was all worth seeing the look on Mark's face as his servers went down the second time.\n\nAll fashion companies cut ties to 3PL and Eduardo took a 50 million dollar loss, but it was all worth it.\n\nEdit:\n\nContext\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZ6ZlRnS40s&amp;feature=youtu.be",

        "body": "Personally I think people are blowing the ARM threat completely out of proportion. In my view the concern it poses is that ARM will allow more companies to develop their own in house design plus a new  CPU competitors will enter the market. That being said Intel has an enormous amount of advantages over any possible entrant into the CPU space. Lets not forget they've been in this position for the majority of their corporate history. They fought Power PC and won. They competed in against a multitude of x86 vendors which they brutally destroyed like DEC, Cyrix [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\\_of\\_x86\\_manufacturers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_x86_manufacturers) the only exception is AMD which itself has almost died multiple times. Had Intel not rested on their laurels AMD would be dead now too and this is coming from someone who loves AMD to death. (I bought AMD @ $4 back in 2014). \n\nNot only does Intel have some of the best CPU designers in the industry their Roadmap is insane. They are planning on marrying together all of their IP CPU, GPU, FPGA's, Memory, Software and all the other random highly competitive stuff intel does. I think Big.Little married with chiplets and AI accelerators will be a game changer. The only other company I see approaching this scale of capability is AMD. I also don't think every single company will have their own inhouse designs, building CPU's is very expensive and complicated. The expertise is limited and you open yourself up to a whole host of complications. Yes it makes sense for Apple, Amazon, Microsoft etc. But the small to medium sized players will still need a common platform if they want to exist. \n\nThe Foundry is a risk yes but I believe Intel has the finances and talent necessary to figure out this problem. Perhaps they could even go license a new node from Samsung similar to Global foundries. Or maybe Intel and Samsung partner up to develop new nodes to take on TSMC. To me its not a crazy though that Intel and Apple might partner up on the manufacturing side either. Apple has tried to be less dependent on TSMC by leveraging Global Foundries but they just could keep up with TSMC. I don't think anyone wants to be in a situation where there is one FAB to rule them all especially with the geopolitical risks. I'm willing to bet that their massive war chest will help them solve this problem. If not they can always pull an AMD and sell the fab.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn my opinion Intel's problems have been self inflicted by poor management under Brian Krzanich. They got lazy meanwhile and AMD came in and smashed them. Imagine if Intel began doing their plans 10 years ago? What would the market would look like? The missing element is aggressive management hopefully Pat and Intel's $20 Billion in annual profit will be the answer. The downside is large if the fail yes but the upside is also huge. Imagine Intel retuned as a vertically integrated AI powerhouse that brings giant leaps in performance with every new generation. Intel is the only company in the world capable of doing this. People are underestimating Intel just as they underestimated AMD its a complex situation and takes time to play out but if anyone can pull it off its Intel.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSee Moore's law is dead for more info on the tech\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g44zQII9GV4",

        "body": "Even if markets crash by 50% tomorrow, you are around the same buy-in level as during march 2020 lows. Just that you have missed the \\~100% upside.\n\nImo it makes no sense to have a specific cash position for any time in the market; what is much more important is the ratio of your total portfolio size relative to your monthly cashflows. If you are earning so much (or your portfolio is so little) that you earn the total portfolio size within a year for example, it makes no sense to have a high cash position because a true bear market takes on average 12-18 months, so its enough time for you to get cash the following months and deploy directly or start building a cash position during the downtime. If a 1-week downside of -15% or so happens well then you may deploy all the cash you have left at that moment (I personally prefer 5-15% cash at all times but its not set in stone). In case such a crash turns out to be a longer-lived bear market you again have your earnings the next months to deploy.\n\nIf your portfolio is of bigger size/your monthly cashflows are small well then its a different story and you could think about more like 20% cash and a plan to deploy in case of a crash/bear market i.e. dont put in everything at the first -10%. But everything above 20% cash makes no sense from a probabilistic point of view because markets tend to go up most of the time so trying to \"time\" that small window of opportunity when markets indeed go -70% and more (which happens once in a lifetime) I would say is very risky. Markets can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent; in other words: dont try to time what only happens once in a lifetime even though everything looks like it is happening at any moment. Because there are people that have said that since 2010. Dont be that guy. If you happen to be 90% in the market when this once in a lifetime crash of -70%, -80% happens well then you have a once in a lifetime opportunity to buy at cheap prices and if history is any indication, markets wont crash -80% and then get into a V-shaped recovery. A recovery will take time which gives you enough time to scale back into the markets and build a new portfolio.\n\nTL;DR: It makes more sense to stay fully invested; if markets go up nice; if markets go down you can buy whenever you have cash available and if markets completely collapse well then its probably the best that can happen to you from an investment point of view. If markets go down that -70%, -80% it doesnt matter what you have invested because you will be able to build much more wealth from that point onwards over the next 20 years.",

        "body": "Visa is skewed slightly more to debit cards, while Mastercard skews credit cards. Obviously both do plenty of volume in debit and credit, but generally Visa is a more familiar card, particularly in the US, since everyone has a debit card, and then a 50/50 chance of credit card being one or the other. I've had six or seven banks over the years, with national names, and only one used MA. So brand familiarity may be a driver here. And if you want to take that a step further, some beliefs about credit card usage declining may push favor to Visa. I don't have the hard data to back that up, but it's a theory floated by some of the finance guys I've spoken with over the past year or so. Can neither confirm or deny, but maybe something to look into if you're interested in investing.",

Let me give you the inside scoop.\n\nMark Zuckerburg was BBQing some smoked meats inside his office when someone told him the news about the whistleblower. He panicked ran out of his office, then his pants fell down and he tripped, and on the way down pulled down someone else's pants. And then that person fell down, and on the way down, pulled down someone's pants. And then that person pulled down someone's pants. And there was a pants down chain reaction which ultimately reached their server devs.\n\nThen, Emily Chang from Bloomburg technology and her filming camera crew reached Mark Zuckerburg for her scheduled interview. \n\nWith the broadcast live and Mark Zuckerburg caught with his pants down, his assistant handed him a phone, it was Eduardo Saverin. \n\nTurns out he purchased 3PL, a belt logistics company that supples belt prongs to belt manufacturers including the Etriviere by Hermes, Mark's favorite belt. Eduardo threatened to CEO of 3PL to send faulty prongs to Hermes, which made their way to Mark's belt, which snapped the second he put 3 Ns of torque when he panicked about the whistle blower news.\n\nEduardo planned the whole thing. And it was all worth seeing the look on Mark's face as his servers went down the second time.\n\nAll fashion companies cut ties to 3PL and Eduardo took a 50 million dollar loss, but it was all worth it.\n\nEdit:\n\nContext\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZ6ZlRnS40s&amp;feature=youtu.be",

In my view the concern it poses is that ARM will allow more companies to develop their own in house design plus a new  CPU competitors will enter the market. That being said Intel has an enormous amount of advantages over any possible entrant into the CPU space. Lets not forget they've been in this position for the majority of their corporate history. They fought Power PC and won. They competed in against a multitude of x86 vendors which they brutally destroyed like DEC, Cyrix [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\\_of\\_x86\\_manufacturers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_x86_manufacturers) the only exception is AMD which itself has almost died multiple times. Had Intel not rested on their laurels AMD would be dead now too and this is coming from someone who loves AMD to death. (I bought AMD @ $4 back in 2014). \n\nNot only does Intel have some of the best CPU designers in the industry their Roadmap is insane. They are planning on marrying together all of their IP CPU, GPU, FPGA's, Memory, Software and all the other random highly competitive stuff intel does. I think Big.Little married with chiplets and AI accelerators will be a game changer. The only other company I see approaching this scale of capability is AMD. I also don't think every single company will have their own inhouse designs, building CPU's is very expensive and complicated. The expertise is limited and you open yourself up to a whole host of complications. Yes it makes sense for Apple, Amazon, Microsoft etc. But the small to medium sized players will still need a common platform if they want to exist. \n\nThe Foundry is a risk yes but I believe Intel has the finances and talent necessary to figure out this problem. Perhaps they could even go license a new node from Samsung similar to Global foundries. Or maybe Intel and Samsung partner up to develop new nodes to take on TSMC. To me its not a crazy though that Intel and Apple might partner up on the manufacturing side either. Apple has tried to be less dependent on TSMC by leveraging Global Foundries but they just could keep up with TSMC. I don't think anyone wants to be in a situation where there is one FAB to rule them all especially with the geopolitical risks. I'm willing to bet that their massive war chest will help them solve this problem. If not they can always pull an AMD and sell the fab.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn my opinion Intel's problems have been self inflicted by poor management under Brian Krzanich. They got lazy meanwhile and AMD came in and smashed them. Imagine if Intel began doing their plans 10 years ago? What would the market would look like? The missing element is aggressive management hopefully Pat and Intel's $20 Billion in annual profit will be the answer. The downside is large if the fail yes but the upside is also huge. Imagine Intel retuned as a vertically integrated AI powerhouse that brings giant leaps in performance with every new generation. Intel is the only company in the world capable of doing this. People are underestimating Intel just as they underestimated AMD its a complex situation and takes time to play out but if anyone can pull it off its Intel.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSee Moore's law is dead for more info on the tech\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g44zQII9GV4",

        "body": "Even if markets crash by 50% tomorrow, you are around the same buy-in level as during march 2020 lows. Just that you have missed the \\~100% upside.\n\nImo it makes no sense to have a specific cash position for any time in the market; what is much more important is the ratio of your total portfolio size relative to your monthly cashflows. If you are earning so much (or your portfolio is so little) that you earn the total portfolio size within a year for example, it makes no sense to have a high cash position because a true bear market takes on average 12-18 months, so its enough time for you to get cash the following months and deploy directly or start building a cash position during the downtime. If a 1-week downside of -15% or so happens well then you may deploy all the cash you have left at that moment (I personally prefer 5-15% cash at all times but its not set in stone). In case such a crash turns out to be a longer-lived bear market you again have your earnings the next months to deploy.\n\nIf your portfolio is of bigger size/your monthly cashflows are small well then its a different story and you could think about more like 20% cash and a plan to deploy in case of a crash/bear market i.e. dont put in everything at the first -10%. But everything above 20% cash makes no sense from a probabilistic point of view because markets tend to go up most of the time so trying to \"time\" that small window of opportunity when markets indeed go -70% and more (which happens once in a lifetime) I would say is very risky. Markets can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent; in other words: dont try to time what only happens once in a lifetime even though everything looks like it is happening at any moment. Because there are people that have said that since 2010. Dont be that guy. If you happen to be 90% in the market when this once in a lifetime crash of -70%, -80% happens well then you have a once in a lifetime opportunity to buy at cheap prices and if history is any indication, markets wont crash -80% and then get into a V-shaped recovery. A recovery will take time which gives you enough time to scale back into the markets and build a new portfolio.\n\nTL;DR: It makes more sense to stay fully invested; if markets go up nice; if markets go down you can buy whenever you have cash available and if markets completely collapse well then its probably the best that can happen to you from an investment point of view. If markets go down that -70%, -80% it doesnt matter what you have invested because you will be able to build much more wealth from that point onwards over the next 20 years.",

Its the only thing they want. \nAnd if you can influence people to put money down to put a stock in a more favorable position for you - you do that. Need a stock to go up? Tell people to buy it. Need a stock to go down? Tell people to sell it. Need a asset to pump so you can ramp your failing option play mid week and dump it off before shorting a stock you plan to also unload on? - tell people to buy it. See? They dont care what you pick, just pick what helps them. \n\nIts not a narrative, they play a different game and [everyone thinks they are the big dick.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgBA1jA2-mo)",

As a share holder of AMD and TSM I have to say there are always down side in this sector. The two big thing are the numbers of players in the semiconductor manufacturer. There are a lot! AMD is a ant company compare to Intel, Samsung and TSMC. On top of that China SMIC is growing like a weed. This is why Lisa Su is trying to close the deal with Xilinx. She knows they need them to survive. It is though to be in semiconductor business. PLTR on the other has a huge moat it is national security business with next to zero competitor. However, the big issues with PLTR is that it is not a new company and yet its grow is extremely slow. They need to get more commercial clients if they plan to grow.",

Early August there was a crazy AMD bull run that caused a big spread between the stock values and conversion ratio (as much as a 40% upside of holding Xilinx shares when AMD hit 120). Idk exactly what the catalyst was at that time, but I imagine the WSB hype added to the push (+good Q2). The stocks have been moving very similarly apart from that bull run. \n\nIts impossible to say how aware of the full picture the average retail investor is, but my guess is that they've barely heard of Xilinx whilst AMD is more of a household name. \n\nCheck out this link for ratio movement over time: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/upndown/viz/XilinxAMDSharePriceRatio_16114624177710/XilinxAMDSharePriceRatio",

One of my favorite stocks going forward.\n\n(Pro Tip - If you plan on going LONG on AMD, with no plans to sell the stock in the next 90 days, then do yourself a huge favor and buy shares of XLNX instead of AMD. The merger has an 85 percent chance of being approved, and if so, you get 1.7234 shares of AMD for each share of XLNX. If you run the numbers right now, it's like buying an AMD share with a $12/$13 off per share coupon. However, if you plan to swing trade AMD, and you might be selling in the next 90 days, then it's better to stay with AMD shares for this purpose)",
