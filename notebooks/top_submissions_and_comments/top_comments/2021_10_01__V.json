If it's a \"forced sale\" that shouldn't happen.\n\nThis is the mischaracterized and misunderstood point that the pro-dividend argument always tries to make, but no one worth their salt even claims or \"points to\" this. Dividend policy is irrelevant to the valuation of the company, and thus the valuation of its shares. That fact has nothing to do with visible price movement of a security on the ex date.",

Let me give you the inside scoop.\n\nMark Zuckerburg was BBQing some smoked meats inside his office when someone told him the news about the whistleblower. He panicked ran out of his office, then his pants fell down and he tripped, and on the way down pulled down someone else's pants. And then that person fell down, and on the way down, pulled down someone's pants. And then that person pulled down someone's pants. And there was a pants down chain reaction which ultimately reached their server devs.\n\nThen, Emily Chang from Bloomburg technology and her filming camera crew reached Mark Zuckerburg for her scheduled interview.\n\nWith the broadcast live and Mark Zuckerburg caught with his pants down, his assistant handed him a phone, it was Eduardo Saverin.\n\nTurns out he purchased 3PL, a belt logistics company that supples belt prongs to belt manufacturers including the Etriviere by Hermes, Mark's favorite belt. Eduardo threatened to CEO of 3PL to send faulty prongs to Hermes, which made their way to Mark's belt, which snapped the second he put 3 Ns of torque when he panicked about the whistle blower news.\n\nEduardo planned the whole thing. And it was all worth seeing the look on Mark's face as his servers went down the second time.\n\nAll fashion companies cut ties to 3PL and Eduardo took a 50 million dollar loss, but it was all worth it.\n\nEdit:\n\nContext\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZ6ZlRnS40s&amp;feature=youtu.be",

        "body": "Personally I think people are blowing the ARM threat completely out of proportion. In my view the concern it poses is that ARM will allow more companies to develop their own in house design plus a new  CPU competitors will enter the market. That being said Intel has an enormous amount of advantages over any possible entrant into the CPU space. Lets not forget they've been in this position for the majority of their corporate history. They fought Power PC and won. They competed in against a multitude of x86 vendors which they brutally destroyed like DEC, Cyrix [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\\_of\\_x86\\_manufacturers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_x86_manufacturers) the only exception is AMD which itself has almost died multiple times. Had Intel not rested on their laurels AMD would be dead now too and this is coming from someone who loves AMD to death. (I bought AMD @ $4 back in 2014). \n\nNot only does Intel have some of the best CPU designers in the industry their Roadmap is insane. They are planning on marrying together all of their IP CPU, GPU, FPGA's, Memory, Software and all the other random highly competitive stuff intel does. I think Big.Little married with chiplets and AI accelerators will be a game changer. The only other company I see approaching this scale of capability is AMD. I also don't think every single company will have their own inhouse designs, building CPU's is very expensive and complicated. The expertise is limited and you open yourself up to a whole host of complications. Yes it makes sense for Apple, Amazon, Microsoft etc. But the small to medium sized players will still need a common platform if they want to exist. \n\nThe Foundry is a risk yes but I believe Intel has the finances and talent necessary to figure out this problem. Perhaps they could even go license a new node from Samsung similar to Global foundries. Or maybe Intel and Samsung partner up to develop new nodes to take on TSMC. To me its not a crazy though that Intel and Apple might partner up on the manufacturing side either. Apple has tried to be less dependent on TSMC by leveraging Global Foundries but they just could keep up with TSMC. I don't think anyone wants to be in a situation where there is one FAB to rule them all especially with the geopolitical risks. I'm willing to bet that their massive war chest will help them solve this problem. If not they can always pull an AMD and sell the fab.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn my opinion Intel's problems have been self inflicted by poor management under Brian Krzanich. They got lazy meanwhile and AMD came in and smashed them. Imagine if Intel began doing their plans 10 years ago? What would the market would look like? The missing element is aggressive management hopefully Pat and Intel's $20 Billion in annual profit will be the answer. The downside is large if the fail yes but the upside is also huge. Imagine Intel retuned as a vertically integrated AI powerhouse that brings giant leaps in performance with every new generation. Intel is the only company in the world capable of doing this. People are underestimating Intel just as they underestimated AMD its a complex situation and takes time to play out but if anyone can pull it off its Intel.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSee Moore's law is dead for more info on the tech\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g44zQII9GV4",

        "body": "Even if markets crash by 50% tomorrow, you are around the same buy-in level as during march 2020 lows. Just that you have missed the \\~100% upside.\n\nImo it makes no sense to have a specific cash position for any time in the market; what is much more important is the ratio of your total portfolio size relative to your monthly cashflows. If you are earning so much (or your portfolio is so little) that you earn the total portfolio size within a year for example, it makes no sense to have a high cash position because a true bear market takes on average 12-18 months, so its enough time for you to get cash the following months and deploy directly or start building a cash position during the downtime. If a 1-week downside of -15% or so happens well then you may deploy all the cash you have left at that moment (I personally prefer 5-15% cash at all times but its not set in stone). In case such a crash turns out to be a longer-lived bear market you again have your earnings the next months to deploy.\n\nIf your portfolio is of bigger size/your monthly cashflows are small well then its a different story and you could think about more like 20% cash and a plan to deploy in case of a crash/bear market i.e. dont put in everything at the first -10%. But everything above 20% cash makes no sense from a probabilistic point of view because markets tend to go up most of the time so trying to \"time\" that small window of opportunity when markets indeed go -70% and more (which happens once in a lifetime) I would say is very risky. Markets can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent; in other words: dont try to time what only happens once in a lifetime even though everything looks like it is happening at any moment. Because there are people that have said that since 2010. Dont be that guy. If you happen to be 90% in the market when this once in a lifetime crash of -70%, -80% happens well then you have a once in a lifetime opportunity to buy at cheap prices and if history is any indication, markets wont crash -80% and then get into a V-shaped recovery. A recovery will take time which gives you enough time to scale back into the markets and build a new portfolio.\n\nTL;DR: It makes more sense to stay fully invested; if markets go up nice; if markets go down you can buy whenever you have cash available and if markets completely collapse well then its probably the best that can happen to you from an investment point of view. If markets go down that -70%, -80% it doesnt matter what you have invested because you will be able to build much more wealth from that point onwards over the next 20 years.",

        "body": "&gt;Is diversification even a good investment strategy anymore?\n\nThere's no reason to think the value of diversification has changed over time. Diversification means you're not exposed to the uncompensated, idiosyncratic risks of individual companies. Most fund managers diversify across at least a few dozen investments because concentrating in a small number of stocks means that eventually, it's likely that one of them will collapse and wipe out a large portion of your portfolio. If you're investing in similar stocks, it could happen to multiple stocks in your portfolio, as it did for tech stocks in 2000. Drastic stock price falls can and have happened to many large, established companies. Ask [Bill Hwang](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMO42qkPiio&amp;ab_channel=Benjamin) what he thinks of diversification.\n\nThere is another reason for diversifying, which is less appreciated and perhaps more important than the risk of catastrophic loss in concentrated portfolios. Research has [shown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfdMDGIABek&amp;ab_channel=BenFelix) that a small fraction of stocks account for the growth of the entire stock market. This means that those who under-diversify are far more likely to underperform than overperform.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;What\u2019s the point of utilizing their services if they can\u2019t consistently beat the market?\n\nWell why don't we just pick those few stocks that account for all the returns? The issue with this attitude is that it's difficult to beat the market on a risk-adjusted basis in the long run. Very few people can do it. Some retail investors think that because they've beaten the market over the last five or ten years, that this is a good signal that they'll continue to do so. A long bull market makes a lot of people confident in their stock picking skill. To the contrary, even ten years in the stock market indicates very little, because results are so noisy. The evidence shows that few professional managers can outperform on a 20-year timeline, and picking their funds ahead of time is largely a matter of luck. See the [SPIVA reports](https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/documents/spiva/spiva-us-year-end-2020.pdf#page=9) and the [SPIVA persistence scorecards](https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/documents/spiva/persistence-scorecard-year-end-2020.pdf#page=7).\n\nThere *are* ways of outperforming a cap-weighted index in the long-term, by systematically investing in riskier stocks. See [here](https://github.com/investindex/Portfolio) for details. But that's not active management; it's just an extension of the logic of total market indexing.\n\nThe solution to the problem of stock investing is: buy, hold, and rebalance a portfolio of funds with diversification across risk factors and geographies. Investors who are skilled enough to disregard this advice are very rare. The evidence indicates that those who stray from this approach are overwhelmingly likely to underperform in the long run. Short-term outperformance is not evidence against this; it is entirely expected.",

So I\u2019m paying more, but it\u2019s kind of like I\u2019m getting a better deal.

When Google partnered with Martinis, they had a well defined goal of demonstrating quantum supremacy in the fastest possible way. To that end they have achieved exactly what they set out to so. In the end, for Google, the real return on investment isn\u2019t the actually QC technology, but the press coverage they got in order to attract very bright people to Google.\nIBM\u2019s QC department is also there for pretty much the same reason. They though, did help make QC approachable to the public but IBM is such a dinosaur that they can hardly compete even in their traditional markets such a supercomputing clusters and data centers.\nIonq spun out of John Monroe\u2019s group at Maryland. He has been doing trapped ions since forever. So really all these efforts are pretty much transplants of AMO experiment groups into the public sector. You really can\u2019t just decide to build this out of no where.\nThat being said, the all to all connectivity of trapped ions is an incredibly important aspect of trapped ions. And is the main reason this technology is currently in my opinion the best. Everything else about temperature, power draw and fidelity is meaningless. Even for QCs that need to be 100x colder than outer space, when you theoretically scale the computing power exponentially, the power draw is trivial compared to a classical computer with equivalent computing power. The fidelity is a loaded question as well. The gate operation time for trapped ions is so much slower than superconducting qubits that your gate depth is actually shallower for ionq.

Which is perhaps a good thing generally, but doesn't help stock investors. Also, there is real risk of EU political breakdown, Polexit, etc., that would really damage construction and therefore regional materials.\n\nAs for tech, I only do swing trades on tech growth stocks, so I'm very contrarian on that industry. Basically, I think they'll eventually correct to pre-pandemic levels. Even if not, it is a serious risk. Google and Facebook are just advertising companies, after all. Amazon and MS are heavily bought. Apple is advertising and personal electronics with a massive fashion premium. And fashion premiums don't last forever. The big indexes are heavy in these stocks, so if you get them vicariously through an index you'll still get a lot of the gains. I'm mostly focused on small-cap value stocks for tech. But when I do buy large caps, I focus on things like AMD and IBM, and scalp them repeatedly for small gains.\n\nAnd Amazon's main actual money-maker is AWS, which is a great product, but in 2018 most companies were using single-vendor cloud solutions, and now almost everybody is using tools with multi-vendor support. So Amazon is still the top cloud player, but there is a lot of opportunity for competitors.\n\nMicrosoft, just look at their 10-year. They're doing really well, but nobody needs them, they don't have lock-in like before, do they deserve that big a premium still?\n\nInflation is high and might go up even more, and there are still lots of good opportunities in household necessities and finance. And that part is mainstream analysis.",

They are a poorly run company that has had multiple CEOs in the past 10 years. c.) They have had declining revenue since 2014. d.) They are not reinvesting a lot of their profits back into the business because so much of it is released to shareholders as dividends. They know that that is one of the few reasons they are still in a lot of portfolios and ETFs. \"tHey pAy a HeAlThY dIvIdEnD.\" Yes, but as a result they are backed into a corner and their business plan is basically: Extract as much value from the business as possible while we still can. \n\nDoes that mean that you can't make money off Exxon stock? No, ofc not, and in fact it's one of the best performing stocks in the S&amp;P500 this year. However, a company that has peaked without any contingency plan to continued growth will never be able to match the returns of a company like Microsoft or Google that are growing 20+% Y-o-Y top and bottom line. I will happily pay a premium to companies that have an outstanding track record and ample room to grow and, more importantly, *the proven ability to seek out alternative sources of revenue*. That is not priced in because we don't even know where these companies are headed until they tell us. I am putting my faith in Nadella and Pichai to lead those companies to growth opportunities that investors hadn't even considered yet. \n\nMeanwhile back at Exxon they are just doing damage control to make sure that their dividend is paid at all costs. That is a terrible investment strategy and the difference in returns over the past decade show it. How likely is it do you think that Exxon will continue down this path and likewise for Microsoft and Google? I do not want companies that don't have a bright future ahead because the potential for sizeable returns is just so much smaller. Unfortunately, companies like Exxon still occupy a sizeable chunk in the S&amp;P500 because once-upon-a-time Exxon in particular was the largest company in the world by market cap. As a result, it drops the S&amp;P500s total return hence why I went with the NASDAQ-100. \n\nIt's not that I'm actively *picking* tech stocks, it's that I'm *removing* chronically underperforming companies like Exxon, Chevron, Wells Fargo, IBM, Ford, GM, etc. and the NASDAQ is the most similar to what an ideal portfolio would look like.",
