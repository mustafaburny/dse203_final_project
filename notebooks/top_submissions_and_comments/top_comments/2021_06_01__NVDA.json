        "body": "Credits to /u/ixamnis\n\n\" Here are some that I like. By no means an exhaustive list:\n\n**QQQ** \\- This one uses the NASDAQ 100 as its benchmark. Obviously it's an Indexed, non-managed ETF. XTF used to rate this one as a perfect 10.0 out of 10 rating, but recently dropped it to 9.9 out of 10. It has one of the highest rates of return over the past 10 years of any ETF. It does tend to be tech-heavy, especially with the FAANG +M stocks.  (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Google and Microsoft).  Other top holdings include TSLA, NVDA and ADBE.  (The rating dropped recently when the portfolio of the NASDAQ 100 was re-balanced).\n\n**VXUS** \\- Vanguard Total International Index Fund ETF - top holdings include BABA, Tencent, Samsung, Taiwan Semiconductors, Novartis, Toyota. This is a broad market fund investing only in companies overseas.  I'm not generally bullish on foreign markets, but this one is a very solid ETF with some companies that are likely to do extremely well for the foreseeable future.  XTF rates this one a perfect 10.0 out of 10.\n\nAt the suggestion of u/Here4TheCatPics, I'm also going to include **EFA** and **EEM**. These are Emerging Markets ETFs.  Both have some crossover in their top holdings with VXUS. **EFA** is rated 9.6/10 by XTF Analysts and **EEM** is rated only 5.7/10. **EEM** appears to be heavily invested in the Chinese market with Alibaba and TenCent the top two holdings. It also holds quite a bit of cash for an ETF. **EFA** appears to be more tilted toward the European market. \n\n**VOO**/**SPY** \\- **VOO** and **SPY** are non-managed funds indexed to the S&amp;P 500 Index. These funds are very popular on this subreddit, for good reason. They are well diversified, broad market funds investing in mostly US stocks. XTF rates these funds at 9.6 out of 10 because their return on investment over the long term is somewhat tempered by some of the blue chip stocks in the funds. But those stocks also help reduce volatility relative to some other ETFs. These are solid investments, but keep in mind that in the top 10 holdings there will be a lot of crossover between these funds and other broad market funds that hold US stocks like **QQQ**, **VTI**, **VTG**, **VOOG** and **SPYG**.  There are differences, of course, as well, but you always want to know where those duplications exist.\n\n**IWF** \\- This is a Russell 1000 indexed fund. It is one of my favorites that doesn't get talked about much. It does have a lot of crossover with the other funds mentioned above, but the mix is slightly different.  I would describe this fund as more aggressive than **VOO/SPY**, less volatile than **QQQ**.\n\n**IWM** \\- for someone looking to diversify a little bit, this is a great fund to look into. This fund is a non-managed, indexed fund that uses the Russell 2000 index as its benchmark. The big difference between the Russell 2000 index and many of the the other indexes is that the Russell 2000 index looks at small and mid-cap companies, rather than large-cap companies.  Thus, there is zero crossover between this one and the funds mentioned above. While this fund will move up and down with the market, it is often less volatile than the market overall. If you look at the charts, this fund has under-performed some of the other funds over the past few months while the market has been very volatile in an upward direction, but in a crash, this fund would probably outperform the rest of the market.  It has a 9.0/10 XTF rating.\n\nThere are also some sector funds you may want to look at:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**ICLN**/**TAN/FAN** \\- These funds are clean/renewable energy ETFs. ICLN is more broad while TAN focuses more specifically on solar energy and FAN specifically on wind generated energy. I think renewable energy companies are the future. There is no crossover in the top holdings of this fund with the top holdings of QQQ and most of the other broad market funds. Also, these are global, not just US based companies.  QCLN and PBW are also renewable energy funds, but they also contain a lot of TSLA, NIO and W.K. H.S. in their top holdings making them \"electric vehicle\" funds, as well.  No problem if you want to add that, but you'll find a lot of Tesla in some of the funds mentioned above.\n\n**ARK** group of funds: **ARKG**, **ARKF**, **ARKK ARKW**, **ARKQ**, **PRNT** and **IZRL**. These are managed funds investing in companies that invest in disruptive companies in their respective industries. Most posters on this subreddit are bullish on these funds. They are aggressive growth ETFs, but should be considered somewhat risky and volatile.\n\n* ARKG - Genomic Revolution\n* ARKF - Fintech\n* ARKK - Disruptive Companies (broader market)\n* ARKW - Internet/computer/technology  (Telsa is a top holding)\n* ARKQ - Robotics and artificial intelligence\n* PRNT - 3D printing technology\n* IZRL - disruptive companies based in Israel\n\nXL series of funds.  Similar to the ARK series, these tend to be more aggressive growth funds, however these are passively managed indexed funds with various benchmarks that usually are overloaded in the better companies within a sector:\n\n* **XLV** \\- Health Care\n* **XLK** \\- Technology\n* **XLY** \\- Consumer Discretionary\n* **XLF** \\- Financial\n* **XLU** \\- Utilities\n\nAt the suggestion of u/Shaun8030, I'm adding Cloud Computing as another sector to consider.  Some tickers in that sector include:  **WCLD**, **SKYY**, **CLOU**, **BUG** and **XIKT**. Of these **WCLD** has the best 52 week performance.  Top holdings in **WCLD** include **ZM**, **PLAN**, **CRM**, **CRWD**, **ZEN**, **WDAY**, **TENB**, **PCTY**, **DDOG**, **BL**.  Many of these are likely to also appear in **QQQ**, however, they would be in very small percentages as the Cap on these companies is much smaller.\n\nRead through the comments below. Many users have posted some other great suggestions, as well.\n\n***A nice portfolio might look something like this:***\n\n20% - Broad market US fund such as QQQ, VOO or IWF\n\n20% - VXUS - International\n\n20% - IWM - Small/Mid-cap broad market fund\n\n10% each in four sector funds of your choice\n\nHope this helps.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*I'm not a financial expert or advisor and this is not financial advice, just an opinion from a random internet person.  I do own shares in several, but not all of the funds listed above, including QQQ, IWF, some ARK funds, ICLN, VXUS, etc.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**EDIT:**  WOW! Thanks for the awards and the positive comments.  I appreciate the feedback.  I hope this advice really helps some people.\"",

        "body": "Copying and pasting from an earlier conversation I had today:\n\nNvidia has a few CMP HX partner models preparing to launch - these are the mining specific cards. They have no display output which means they can't be used for gaming. Nvidia is also revising ALL current 30 series (except 3090 I believe) to a LHR (light hash rate) version which is a physical difference in the silicon. They are doing this to nerf ETH mining performance on their 30 series cards at the hardware level.\n\nCurrently, Nvidia's CMP HX mining cards make no economic sense to mine on since they are way less power efficient, and have no resale value since they can't be used for gaming. However, if Nvidia completely locks down ETH hash rate on the 30 series, they can increase their TAM by preventing miners from cannibalizing their gaming sales. So far, the CMP HX cards look like they are built on 10 series architecture so they will be able to be produced cheaper and in parallel to 30 series.\n\nLastly, the ARM deal seems to be moving along. Qualcomm has voiced concerns and said they are ready to invest in ARM as a partner if the Nvidia deal falls through. Nvidia says it has 3 other silicon manufacturers who support the Nvidia deal but details aren't known yet. Nvidia's recent rise is likely due to the probability of the ARM deal actually becoming more likely.\n\nIn case you dont understand why the ARM deal is good for NVDA, it means that all ARM-based chip manufacturers are beholden to NVDA. ARM is the most dominant CPU architecture for all mobile CPUs including micro controllers in other devices. Apple, qualcomm, samsung, amd, intel, huawei, IBM all have ARM licenses\n\nIt allows NVDA to penetrate the mobile market. Nvidia has the highest profit margins on their mobile CPUs because they don't have to rely on partners to distribute chunky desktop cards. They sell the silicon directly. Every iphone and samsung galaxy could have an Nvidia-produced CPU and GPU.\n\nThe reason ARM is used for mobile is because of its power efficiency. If Nvidia knows what they are doing (they do) then they know how they can use their proprietary access to ARM to create ultra performant and efficient server chips, feeding into their datacenter revenue.\n\nNvidia has announced plans to enter the server CPU market. When they announced this, Intel and AMD stock tanked 5% or so. My bet is that they are already working with ARM to deliver their CPU server chips\n\nTL;DR - ARM deal going through would make NVDA pull a page out of 2020 TSLA's book. Downside is ARM deal delays, pricing in approval then having it get denied. Would crush the stock.",

        "body": "AMD is in the logic gate design industry, NOT manufacturing. \n\nIntel kept their foundries which is why Intel has worse PE ratios compared to AMD and NVDA. Manufacturing is very capital intensive and low margin (generally). Obviously when they are all running at capacity, margins are great. Capacity is industry secret so nobody will ever know what capacity is and whether anyone is lying. There is basically no reason for foundries to advertise free capacity unless they are stupid. \n\nTSMC are killing it now though and gaining know how with EUV which is very valuable. Its also a strategically important industry which the Taiwan government will protect at all costs. Probably another reason why the US would go to war if PRC tries to invade. They want to keep China out of this bleeding edge technology. TSMC seem to be pumping chunks into Capex for plants in the US. God knows why they pick Arizona when they need water but hey ho. That said, I think there are better investments than TSMC. More on that later. \n\nAMD's main advantage is in CPU over Intel in x86. To this day, I cant allocate how much this is due to AMD being better in R&amp;D than Intel vs Intel giving up on EUV with ASML. Either way, Intel screwed up huge and looks to be about 2 years behind in tech. I read somewhere that Intel has got ASML lined up to provide some hardware for Intel in 2023. They may or may not regain competitive products around there since my gut is they prefer monolithic vs chiplet design and they need pellicles for that (yield reasons) and EUV/Pellicles seems to work now. Nothing to concern me for near future but long term, we will need to see what AMD has lined up for 2023 vs new monolithic dies from Intel. Their latest product stack (Emerald Rapids) slipping into 2023 is great for AMD. Still stuck on 10nm. KEK\n\nWhat the fuck is ASML? They produce the EUV machines for foundries. They have a monopoly on this. All foundries that want to use EUV must buy from ASML. ASML is printing money and cant invest it fast enough so gives dividends. ASML price has gone bananas but its probably still a decent buy imo. Their margins are huge because... they can be. Who else are foundries going to get EUV tech from? Exact entry price? I am going to wait for a small dip and then buy into it. I am late to the party for sure. Applied Materials also a supplier for foundries. No monopoloy like ASML but still very important supplier. \n\nSo why dont I like TSMC as much as ASML and Applied Materials? In the end, they are still a manufacturer. At the mercy of supply demand. Its cyclical. Decent investment but I prefer to invest into monopolies. \n\nNVDA? Priced too high for my liking but prob just still goes up like TSLA for unexplained reasons. They are KILLING it in GPU and datacentre. AMD exists in this space but NVDA just has the superior tech and mature software stack with CUDA. \n\nSo anyway, whats the TL:DR?\n\nSemi conductor market can only go up imo. Up chunks. Like more than analysts estimate. \n\nYou can capture this better through AMD and ASML than vs Intel (bad tech for now), NVDA (over priced for me but might still just go up). \n\nI am long AMD. Looking to hold for 10ish years. Maybe this bitch hits 400 a share or something once AMD holds 60% of datacentre CPU. \n\nDont play weeklies and stuff. Just buy the stock or if you must do options, do LEAPS. \n\n\"its all priced in\" - is it fuck. Still lots of gains to be had, just cant prediuct weekly prices. \n\nNot financial advice bla bla bla",

        "body": "I'm a LT investor in INTC. LT as in nearing decade rather than years.\n\nIMO INTC isn't good for the short term and you'd have to have a lot of faith in Gelsinger turning the ship around. Right now Intel is not undervalued but IMO fairly priced given the risks involved in investing in it. The price is right but I think OP is looking at the upside potential compared to the price and sees a deal. As someone holding the company and considering my holdings, I would say there is upside potential (esp if you hold long) but it's not \"undervalued\".\n\nThe reason why it's not \"undervalued\" is because it's losing and getting disrupted. It's a tech company in the sense that it's in the field of high tech semis, but it's NOT a tech company in the sense of growth and disrupting others. In fact it's looking like a dinosaur. TSM, CSM, Samsung, etcetc. AMD, NVDA, ARM, etcetc. All bombarding it from all sides. Cheaper &amp; faster manufacturing, 7nm/5mn foundries built and running, 7nm/5nm designed and selling, already developing 5nm/3nm, etctec. \n\nAnd that's before we get into the real problem: the FAAAMs &amp; BATs are looking for places to expand and the semi space is where many of them are looking. \n\n&gt;Apple recently stopped using Intel chips and have their in house designed M1/M2 chips manufactured by TSM. Apple isn't going back to INTC anytime soon. And Apple doesn't go away. Nokia/Motorola phones basically dead, watch industry forever changed, Ipad industry disrupted, app store still dominating, apple computers aren't made by someone else, etcetc. Intel cannot fight back against Apple and it will NEVER kill Apple. Maybe Apple gets too comfy and declines, but that's not something Intel can control. If anything, the last 20 years have shown Apple only gets stronger and better with each reiteration of their products.\n\n&gt;MSFT? Doing the same thing AAPL is doing. Intel ain't effecting, killing, or pushing out Microsoft either. MSFT is bigger, more corporate, more innovative, and has stronger ties to China which INTC does not have. INTC isn't going to kill the Xbox, windows, office, github, skype, linkedin, bing, etctec. Nope. INTC has it's hands full desperately struggling to catch up to AMD/NVD/SMG on development and SMG/TSM/CSM in manufacturing. \n\n&gt;AMZN? Already dominating everything. Has AWS needs. Will look to in-housing their chips if supply issues become a problem. AMZN make so much money it has to actively lose money going into new businesses to keep from paying boatloads of taxes. Right now it's shipping, but chips could be next now that it sees MSFT/AAPL doing it.\n\n&gt;GOOG? Already doing chips in their own way. Leader in AI. Can use chips in their own chromebooks/phones. Fighting a cloud war in AAPL which chips might come in handy. Also has tons of cash laying around.\n\n&gt;Now FB is in a war with AAPL with apple using it's products to lockout FB datamining. FB is complaining about Apple app store fees and monopoly. FB will look to ways to circumvent that by going into hardware. And thus they'll be incentivized to not use INTC or go into chips themselves.\n\n&gt;Chinese BATs looking to do the same. Japanese tech leaders playing defensive but not backing down. Europe doesn't have the same tech titans but will pull some legislative B.S. to protect their own markets.\n\nSee the real reason I say INTC isn't \"undervalued\" is because it's fairly valued given the very real threats that surround it on multiple sides. It's big, has US government backing, in a still growing industry, and can whether a beating. But INTC was INTC because it was a technology leader that disrupted the industry. It's technology lead was what kept AAPL using INTC chips and everyone off their back. It was their moat. And now that moat is disappearing if not gone with a lot of bigger, stronger, more innovative, more driven, better runned, and better funded companies that they have no answer to eating it's market share.",

        "body": "you're getting conflicting and wrong information in the replies. hopefully this answers your question\n\n&gt; The stock split will be payable in the form of a stock dividend. Each shareholder of record as of June 21 will receive an additional three shares of stock for every share held. The shares will be distributed after the market close on July 19, and the newly split shares will begin trading when the market opens on Tuesday, July 20.\n\n&gt; Existing shareholders won't have to do anything to receive the additional shares, which will be deposited directly into their brokerage accounts once the stock split takes effect. It's important to note that investors shouldn't necessarily expect the new shares to appear in their account immediately after the market close on July 19. As internal processes differ from brokerage to brokerage, it may take as many as several days for the new shares to show up in investor accounts.\n\n&gt; Finally, investors should remember that a stock split does nothing to change the value of the underlying business, but merely divides it into a great number of ownership portions. As an example, NVIDIA shares have lately been trading for roughly $700. This means instead of having one share worth $700, shareholders would own four shares, each worth $175.\n\nsource: https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/06/08/shareholders-approve-nvidia-stock-split-heres-what/",

One thing we didn't have was a large stock quite as overpriced as Tesla.  Tesla is a $50-$100 company trading at $600.  Cisco only had a PE of 110, not 600 like Tesla.

        "body": "Intel has $24 billion in cash reserves sitting around.\n\nAMD's revenue in 2020 was only $9.8 billion.\n\nThey've got the deep pockets to catch up, they just haven't decided to. Intel's leadership decided to take less risk in innovation because they could afford to, already being the dominant player in terms of market share (and they still are, with $78 billion in revenue for 2020 compared to AMD's measley $10 billion). \n\nIntel now has new leadership, comprised not of business degrees, but rather CS and engineering degrees. They're going to turn back on the R&amp;D, and the fruit of that will probably be seen within 2-3 years.\n\nSo your analysis has one massive critical flaw: **\"I don't think they will ever get back to total dominance like they were 5 years ago\"**\n\nThe flaw is that **Intel currently has that market dominance.** [Intel currently holds 81% market share of laptop CPUs and 80.7% market share of Desktop CPUs](https://www.crn.com/news/components-peripherals/intel-regains-pc-market-share-against-amd-as-cpu-capacity-expands), and that's not even considering the enterprise solutions and data centers which are the real money makers (and areas which Intel handily dominates over AMD, just as NVIDIA does in data centers for GPU solutions as opposed to CPU).\n\nIt's a David and Goliath story, sure, but Goliath is still standing, and they certainly haven't traded places.\n\nEDIT: quick edit to acknowledge you never mentioned AMD, only TSMC, but the general idea still stands.",

AMD dominate the processor space right now.\n\nFaster, cheaper, cooler, higher-yielding chips have resulted in many high-level super computing contracts going the way of AMD over Intel, as well as the general consensus among gamers and content creators that AMD Ryzen is better than Intel Core for gaming (for about 85% ish of games).\n\nAMD fortunately don't take as much of a hit as Nvidia will if crypto crumbles. It'll be a hit, though.",
