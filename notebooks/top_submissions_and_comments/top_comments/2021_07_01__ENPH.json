I think the innovation is there, just unkown ( like with Tesla, they make EV) = Innovation. Apply = new phones. Innovation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere is innovation here among these companies, e.g Maxeon Air are solar pannels that are super lightweight and designed for the european markets where they can't load bare on alot of there structure. $ENPH gave us the world of almost Solar pannels via there converters as we know it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGiven, these guys are small/mid stocks - it was things like $ENPH that went 500% last year, and the same can happen with $SPWR/$MAXN I believe. 500% gain on Maxn would give it a   market cap of $3.5b with revenues touching just under $1b this year. Consistent YOY revenues and growth. I guess valuations in the near terms, do not matter so much as long terms in this market, but I think I'm right with my assumptions of saying, these stocks and many more in solars, are fairly undervalued/ over looked?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks for your feedback :)",

It\u2019s been overvalued for so long because institutional investors anticipate the company\u2019s value will eventually catch up to and exceed its current valuation. I like $ENPH as a long-term hold. I don\u2019t have the omnipotence to predict dips or rallies so I add to my position regularly.

Self-driving cars are unfortunately not as easy to release, but even their release is already priced in in the stock price. Charge stations - competition from PLUG and others. Overall, TSLA is a great company, but the stock prices in a very optimistic scenario, so I doubt it's a great investment currently.\n\nSo cars manufacturer can have a tech valuation, but a company selling hardware and software (elgato streaming software) and running online platform (gaming coaching) will never get a tech valuation? I dunno. I would disagree.\n\nAnyway, even if CRSR maintains P/E of 17, the stock can easily 2-4x in the next 2-5 years. CRSR is spending a lot now on R&amp;D and marketing: they launch multiple new products every month and they are advertised everywhere - they're everywhere on TikTok, which is where kids spend time nowadays. Also, they're paying off their high-interest debt. Once they cut R&amp;D and marketing spending and trim debt, their earnings will be massively larger than currently.",

The American funds has a much higher fee much lower return historically and a much lower dividend yield as well.
