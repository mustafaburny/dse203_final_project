Making an argument along the lines of Amazon = Pets.com on the basis of P/E is pretty damn silly.\n\nYes, there are companies like BLNK that are complete shit propped up by hype. People will go -90% on companies like this eventually. No, the market doesn't give a shit and will march forward on the back of actual companies like Microsoft that are insane cash cows.",

        "body": "- The stock was heavily shorted because their brick and mortar business model was pretty much going extinct and they were in debt. The short sellers, however, ignored some fundamental catalysts like the new console cycle and that ps5 and xbox one would work with game disks (correct me if I'm wrong here).\n\n- They also ignored the fact that GME's online sales had gone up quite significantly. All of this led some redditors early in the game to believe that this was a company that would not go bankrupt. They then had a deal with Microsoft which pumped the stock higher.\n\n- Enter Ryan Cohen. The founder of Chewy ($CHWY) saw the potential in GME and wrote an angry letter imploring them to find better ways of leveraging their popularity and shifting their business online. He has since upped his investment and has more comrades on board.\n\n- All of the above meant that GME was priced very low and was actually a value investment because of the good things coming up for this company. Institutions and retail investors started buying this stock and it kept going up.\n\n- There is evidence that the short sellers kept increasing their position hoping for a reversal that never came. Now their brokers are restricting short selling for GME and as the stock pumps higher, they are closer and closer to getting margin called.\n\n- When that happens, they will be forced to close their positions and buy shares. Creating a short squeeze. The catch here is that there are not enough shares available to buy and close their positions. Essentially, they would have to buy it from insiders or institutions who will most probably not be willing to sell their stake.\n\n- The above would create an infinite short squeeze which would make us all very rich if we could time our exit. \n\nSomeone from r/wallstreetbets correct me if I missed anything.

Also, I think you are misinterpreting 'giant multinational corporations' as belonging to a specific country. That just isn't true. Microsoft and Google for example are headquartered in the US but have employees all over the world. \n\n\\- Canada actually does make cars there are a handful of major manufacturing plants in Ontario. There are also automotive research and design offices. Yes, the companies are headquartered in the US, but that doesn't mean they have no Canadian content. \n\n\\- Canada has a number of hardware companies. ATI which used to design graphics cards was Canadian until it got purchased by AMD. They still have offices in Canada and the graphics cards are competitive with the best made anywhere. I don't think any of the GPU manufacturing is actually in Canada, but lots of the R&amp;D is done here. \n\n\\- Canada does have a significant pharmaceutical industry, it is just small compared to the US where profits can be many times higher due to the high per-person healthcare spending in the US.  Often times viable products designed in Canada get purchased by larger American companies before they reach consumers so you don't realize the Canadian connection. Canada also has facilities to make vaccines, they just don't happen to be compatible with the new type of vaccine being used for COVID (mRNA). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere have been some notable Canadian tech failures. Nortel for example was the world leader in advanced telecommunications technology. Unfortunately, it fell victim to a combination of incompetent management and corporate espionage where it had its designs stolen from competitors. BlackBerry is a bit similar in that it completely DOMINATED the world's smartphone market for well over a decade before Apple disrupted the market with the first-gen iPhone. The smartphone market eventually saw everyone else either make android phones or sell off the cellphone business. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCanadian companies often sell out to large multinational companies. They just have the resources such that it doesn't make sense for someone small to compete against them, it's better to join them.",

I would be they have something in the works to be able to deliver very nice PCs for a very nice price. The competition for retail PC gaming would be low. Around me there's microcenter but they only have so many stores, i think less than 10. So the next one is best buy, but they barely carry gaming pc parts. It's mainly office computers and printers, boomer shit. Yeah you can get stuff online and delivered to your house. I personally am the guy who buys all the shit online and picks up at the store in case I need something extra or have questions. The idea of gamestop having all of this stuff and probably a pc specialist to help with builds is a huge green light. Imagine all the people that go home and build their pc alone with a youtube vid up would be replaced by just going in and building it with someone at gamestop (not sure if that's the plan but maybe?). \n\nAs far as the online goes, again their e-commerce went up 800% and now they have a possible ceo who grew a HUGE online brand and obviously knows that market well. Gamestop already has the branding they just need to convince people to switch to using them for their gaming needs which personally I'm going to put my money where my mouth is and start getting what I need from gamestop when I can. \n\nLots of it also comes down to just believing in RC. Which I have decided after his recent tweets I do. He wants this shit to work, and he turned millions into billions once already. Imagine what he can do with an already established gamestop. I honestly believe all it needs is the new ideas and outlook he and his buddies will bring to completely turn the company around. \n\nI'd love to see a fucking squeeze I'm the next week or so because my investment is pretty small. If there is a squeeze, my plan is reinvest all my profits back into gamestop after the price goes way down again or stabilizes to hold long term and then put my initial investment into bb immediately. Here's to hoping.",

All the major companies are either focusing on growth or have been absorbed by Google, Microsoft, Amazon, etc. It\u2019s a real shame, too, because the companies that have acquired startups are focused on 1-5 year gains. Pressure, in this case leads to poor products or hype. The reality is that quantum computing is the most complicated engineering challenge man has ever faced. You think going from 20nm to 5 nm was tough, quantum computing is much harder but has the potential for gains that will rival what we have seen from the time of Turing to now.\n\nA ~52 logical qubit chip owned by Google achieved quantum supremacy (just Google \u201cquantum supremacy Google\u201d). We are aiming for 100-10000+ logical qubits in the near future. The computational capabilities of such systems will revolutionize drug design, materials and optimal portfolios \ud83d\ude44.",

And then the banks made obscene money and delivered huge bonuses.\n\nSo why can major financial institutions invest in the things that will prop up businesses? Why shouldn\u2019t they fucking want to? Why do we need to keep inflating our currency by printing money as a means to prop up the already wealthy?\n\nWhy can I scream right back in their face and say STOP BEING AMORAL FUCKS \u2014 and Bet On The Recovery that working people need. Bet directly on working people.\n\nThis is why I am LONG AMC AND GME.\n\nAnd fuck the op for his judgmental self-righteous ass-hattery. \n\n5. Most importantly, AMC is heavily invested in by the movement. You can suppprt it for be left behind. You are welcomed to join but don\u2019t tell people not to who believe in the cause. If you do that, then you\u2019re know better than CNBC that keeps reporting GME will lose steam, Jim Cramer who recommended that everyone just stop, or Robinhood who restricted my purchase of buying AMC just as much as GME purely because WE WERE WINNING.\n\nSo fuck you, \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80, this is just the beginning.

        "body": "Known Vulnerabilities is exactly on point.\n\nI have a degree in Computer Science,  I\u2019ve engineered systems that run on Windows, Unix, Linux, containers using Docker and Kubernetes.  Open source software will always have more known vulnerabilities because the code base is easily viewed.  Many people with diverse engineering backgrounds can view that code.  This leads to more vulnerabilities being found, but also to more of those vulnerabilities being fixed, and fixed faster than closed source operating systems.\n\nThere\u2019s a reason why Black Hat hackers love to take advantage of organizations that use windows.  It\u2019s not that Linux is impossible to hack but exploiting windows is easier by an order of magnitude.  Those people that hack for profit usually take the path of least resistance to profit.\n\nAs of macOS Catalina Apple removed all old NeXTSTEP(based on BSD Unix 4.4) code and the OS is now entirely based on FreeBSD Unix with some Apple custom written code on top of it.\n\nFreeBSD is an entirely open source operating system.  It has many contributors but not as many as Linux and is not as popular, it is still considered more secure by miles than the windows kernel.\n\nWindows makes some very stupid architectural decisions when it comes to security.  Couple that with the performance of the windows kernel  vs the Linux kernel and you now know why most cloud providers exclusively offer Linux.\n\nMicrosoft relies on \u201ccapturing\u201d your business and making it difficult to use other technologies as integrating with a Microsoft ecosystem is more opaque than say integrating Linux systems with FreeBSD.  Hell even the majority of Azure Cloud instances are running some kind of linux.\n\nIntegration is the name of the game in tech the tech world at the moment.  Any company not moving to the cloud and away from Microsoft is frankly behind the curve.\n\nHow does this relate to blackberry?  Blackberry devices use two operating systems Blackberry 10 and Android.  Blackberry 10 Based on QNX shown in this chart had its last release three years ago in April and the company has moved to android as of 2019.  Like Microsoft and their Azure Cloud Platform  Blackberry sees that custom homegrown closed source operating systems are dying.  I have a feeling that before the end of the decade Microsoft Windows will either be defunct or will no longer use the closed source NT kernel and be a distribution of Linux or based on some kind of Unix.\n\nTech companies are seeing the writing on the wall folks the open source operating system revolution isn\u2019t just a passing fad but a trend that\u2019s been on the rise for years.  Don\u2019t bet on the losers folks, bet on where the tech industry is innovating, open source software and platforms.\n\nAnyone telling you to buy BB based on Blackberry QNX is either ignorant to the latest trends in tech or are trying to pump the stock and make money off your ignorance.",

        "body": "Why BlackBerry Stock Will Eventually Ride Much Higher\n\nBlackBerry's automobile and IT security products, along with its settlement with Facebook, will boost BB stock.\n\nThose who are bearish on BlackBerry (NYSE:BB) \u2014 including the many people who are short-selling the name \u2014 continue to vastly underestimate how much money the company can make. That\u2019s because BlackBerry\u2019s cybersecurity business is bolstering BB stock, with more upside on the horizon from connected vehicles and more. Basically, cybersecurity threats are becoming more prevalent as we advance technologically and this company stands to gain.\n\nM\ufffcore specifically, the BlackBerry naysayers have failed to take into account the strength of the company\u2019s security products like Spark. And that\u2019s not all \u2014 BlackBerry also has a very large payment in-store, which it\u2019s likely to receive soon from social media giant Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).\n\nSo, here\u2019s why BlackBerry will climb much higher in the future.\n\nBB Stock and Connected Cars\n\nMorgan Stanley\u00c2 (NYSE:MS) embraced \u201cthe monetization of connected cars\u201d this past November. Specifically, bank analyst Adam Jonas stated that \u201cTesla is on the verge of a profound model shift from selling cars to generating high margin, recurring software and services revenue [\u2026] [from] infotainment and performance upgrades.\u00e2\u0080\u009d But instead of focusing on Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) in the connected car space, I\u2019d like to zero in on BB stock.\n\nBack in January 2018, I thought BlackBerry could make money by selling subscriptions through driverless cars. At the time, I wrote that it could sell \u201cads, data, extra security features, and apps\u201d in the space. Now I believe that prospect is even more possible. The company can \u2014 through its highly secure QNX operating system (OS) \u2014 ultimately sell such products and services to the owners of all connected vehicles.\n\nYears ago, I noted something else, too: \u201cBlackBerry can sell data that it obtains from consumers who use its self-driving operating system.\u201d Now in 2021, the idea of collecting and selling data from drivers has become mainstream. Even the notion of selling extra car security features has been raised. In fact, only the thought of selling tracking systems and ads is less prevalent now. However, I still believe that the company will be able to sell such products.\n\nWhat BlackBerry Sells\n\nOne way to think about BlackBerry\u2019s situation in connected cars is to compare it to Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). Of course, that company sells operating systems for computers. But just as Microsoft has made money from software sales, BB can profit from selling OSs for our increasingly tech-advanced vehicles.\n\nSound odd? Well, Amazon\u2019s (NASDAQ:AMZN) decision to work alongside the company to \u201cdevelop and market BlackBerry\u2019s Intelligent Vehicle Data Platform\u201d validates these offerings even further. Even Baidu\u00c2 (NASDAQ:BIDU) has gotten in on BlackBerry\u2019s technology, opening up BB\u2019s ability to meaningfully penetrate the Chinese auto market.\n\nMeanwhile, QNX has also been installed in other spaces, including applications in aerospace and defense, medical devices and \u201cindustrial automation.\u201d With devices of all sorts now being connected to the internet, the number of endpoints that need the security BB provides will likely skyrocket.\n\nSpark Will Jump Start Revenue, Facebook Will Pay\n\nClearly, BlackBerry\u2019s upside is not limited to the connected car space alone. To that end, in May 2020, the company announced Spark Suites. This new security product will provide companies and governments with \u201ca range of tailored cybersecurity and endpoint management options.\u201d\n\nMore specifically, BlackBerry has integrated \u201cendpoint management, user authentication, and application and data encryption\u201d from its original systems with \u201cartificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML) and automation for improved cyber threat prevention and remediation.\u201d Altogether, this new product is a comprehensive and competitive development.\nBecause of that, I believe that the strength of Spark will be able to meaningfully lift the company\u2019s financial results over time.\n\nBut that\u2019s not the only boon for BB stock. On. Jan. 15, BlackBerry also announced that it had settled its patent-infringement lawsuit with Facebook. The dispute involves patents on messaging technologies, which are quite vital to FB\u2019s huge business.\n\nAs a result of the settlement, I expect BlackBerry to receive a large, multi-billion dollar payment from the social media giant. That\u2019s sure to greatly boost BB stock, too.\n\nBottom Line\n\nIt\u2019s true \u2014\u00c2 right now, BlackBerry\u2019s shares are very volatile. Why? The Reddit stock forum, Wall Street Bets (WSB), recently targeted it alongside other names in a massive short squeeze. That situation could continue for some time.\n\nBut I\u2019m convinced that BB stock will climb much higher over the long term. Given these points, I recommend that long-haul growth investors buy shares of BlackBerry now. Investors should also be prepared to buy roughly the same number of shares again if BB pulls back meaningfully in the near-term.",

Hence his support for Pompeo's labeling of genocide, and his reaction against China's sanctions against Trump's staff members. Thinking things are just going back to normal here is completely wishful thinking.\n2. Vaccine rollout is going, but it's hitting hiccups, and we're also facing potential new variants of the virus which are more contagious. Hard to say how much this does or doesn't matter, but it's something that the market does not seem to be pricing in right now.\n3. Interest rates being low is not necessarily as supportive as you may think. The market could easily view this through the lens of \"if we see another economic shock, there is no more ability to lower rates\". IE, removing the fed put to a degree. And yes, I know we can go negative, but that causes other problems and for now, the fed has been vocal about not wanting this. In other words, it would likely take a very significant shock for the fed to decide to go negative on rates. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The Stuff You're Missing**\n\n1. Debt, debt, and lots of debt. Most financial crises are a product of debt in one way or another. And guess what the entire world has? Far more debt than we've ever had before. We also have worse demographics, and worse growth. Hence why the global economy has been propped up by central banks for the last few years, unable to transition back to ***not*** requiring QE / zero percent rates. \n2. The problem with the above is that now that everyone is at zero percent rates, there is a transition towards using more fiscal policy to stimulate. That's required because monetary policy is no longer as effective, we're already at zero percent rates, and it's just causing it's own problems. Fiscal policy typically causes inflation. Inflating over-indebted societies causes financial crises, generally speaking.\n3. We're still out of a ton of jobs. More than the GFC, more than any time since the depression. While some will come back upon reopening, a lot won't. That's a problem, especially if those people can't transition  back into working effectively. \n4. Long term interest rates keep rising with more promise for fiscal policy. This causes tightening in our economy that we simply can't handle. At some point, the market will start to price in rising long term interest rates as a big negative for risk assets, especially the high-p/e stocks that have been the major trade for most market participants over the last 4-5 years.\n5. Record speculative market activity typically mean-reverts at some point. We've seen a shit ton of speculation in the last few months especially, major call option yolo'ing tends to mean revert once the supply of $ to the people buying these items slows down. Those call options have done wonders in pushing markets upwards, but it will require a constant supply of purchasing to keep markets elevated. It's a supply-demand thing in reality, and the supply of buyers speculating in meme stocks is not going to stay at the current pace long-term. When that slows down, you'll likely get a move downward that's even sharper than the move upward.\n6. Zero percent rates push everyone into far more risky financial assets. This has two effects. First, it can push the market up by providing a bid for those risky assets. But on the other hand, it introduces more downside risk if things start moving the opposite way. In short, we get market support at the cost of increasing market fragility and the propensity to see large shocks downward when stuff breaks.\n7. Antitrust + less business friendly political environment. This is a risk that has been considered for a long time, but it's much more likely to happen now. Antitrust suits can take out market leaders ala Microsoft in 2000. Taking out market leaders = bad for markets as a whole. FWIW, I don't think Biden is going to make the environment \"bad\" for business, it's just that we're transitioning away from an administration that created the most favorable financial conditions for corporates in history.\n\nThere is more I can add. But there is **always** more stuff to worry about. Markets do climb a wall of worry, and in today's market structure, we tend to see grinding slow rides upwards with very sharp and sudden selloffs downwards. Markets can and do stay elevated far longer than most bears usually think possible. \n\nRegardless, there is ***plenty*** of very real and very noteworthy risk in the markets today. I would argue there is more now than almost ever before, but we also are getting more government support at a quicker rate than ever before. This prevents cascading impacts of negative economic shocks in a lot of ways, which then provides confidence for investors to speculate.",

Comparing December numbers where there was massive lockdown where retailers left and right are closing stores is going to hurt GME. No SHIT SHERLOCK. With the difficulty  in procuring any gaming hardware in general, just look at PC hardware or PS5/Xbox Series X, of course sales will be down in general. Most of their business \"AT THE MOMENT\" is still retail, they're not going to post gang buster numbers in December. Instead what we'll most likely see is a spread out increase in their earnings over several quarters as opposed to all front loaded as they normally are in the holiday season.\n3. Their E-Commerce jumped 300% also same as 2. They are comparing literally end of cycle numbers, PANDEMIC lockdown, supply shortages and zero rev from Microsoft shared earnings are included in there. I thought the market is forward looking not backwards.\n4. Hedge funds are WRONG ALL THE FUCKEN TIME just look at TSLA. Only time will tell how high GME will go but at this price point you are dead fucken wrong. As for GME, these retards were at the fucken sleep at the wheel, when GME traded at 3$, any fucken person with a brain cell would of closed out their position after a 98% possible GAIN and put their capital elsewhere. These \"reputable hedge fund\" are fucken greedy pigs that are getting slaughtered.\n5. Except they're SPECIFICALLY SAID in their earnings THEY DO NOT NEED MONEY. Q3 earnings transcript THIS QUESTION WAS ASKED SPECIFICALLY, THEY SHOT BACK AND SAID THEY DO NOT NEED IT AT ALL. They are sitting on 500m CASH and paying back debt EARLY, they're going to be swimming in cash from the new console cycle, THEY HAVE 102m STILL ALLOCATED CASH TO STOCK BUYBACK. They'll issues shares when they squeeze those retard shorts when GME trades at 420.69$.\n\nFUCK YOU SHITRON.",

GameStop*\n\n*Trading at just 0.4 times revenue, GameStop (NYSE:GME) is severely undervalued because, well, everyone seems to doubt it -- and not for unjustifiable reasons. In fact, over $1.36 billion of the company's $2.19 billion worth of shares are sold short. Many investors see no reason not to bet against a brick-and-mortar retailer that is still selling physical copies of video games when they are nearly universally available online.*\n\n*If this is your view, you may be surprised to learn that GameStop is still doing pretty well despite its fair share of challenges. During its nine-week holiday sale ended Jan. 2, the company managed to bring in $1.77 billion in revenue, a modest decline of 3.1% from the same period last year. But in the interim, management closed 11% of its stores for being unprofitable; after adjusting for that, sales for the remaining locations actually went up.*\n\n*GameStop now has a robust e-commerce segment -- it's growing at a stunning rate of 309% year over year, and it accounts for over a third of total revenue. Last year, management signed an agreement with Microsoft to update its stores with the tech giant's software and cloud data solutions. In return, GameStop will be eligible for a commission on all digital revenue (such as video game purchases) generated from Microsoft's Xbox platform.*\n\n*Ryan Cohen, a co-founder of online pet food retailer Chewy, joined GameStop's advisory board on Jan. 11. His venture capital firm now owns 13% of the company's outstanding shares.*\n\n*Given these catalysts, I expect GameStop to turn around its operations in no time. Over the past year, its stock is already up a whopping 683%. Even after an amazing run up, though, its market cap ($2.6 billion) is still less than half its annual revenue ($6.46 billion). That makes for a price-to-sales ratios (P/S) far lower than what most retailers are trading at. If you're looking for stocks with the potential to double over time, consider GameStop.*",
