Making an argument along the lines of Amazon = Pets.com on the basis of P/E is pretty damn silly.\n\nYes, there are companies like BLNK that are complete shit propped up by hype. People will go -90% on companies like this eventually. No, the market doesn't give a shit and will march forward on the back of actual companies like Microsoft that are insane cash cows.",

I assumed it was the late 90's early 2000's). \n\nOP I'm drunk enough to not beat around the bush and just say it, the fact that you're 19 and think this shit is passing you by or something is fucking laughable. I'm 29, I've been \"stashing away\" since about 20 but only seriously investing for about a year and guess the fuck what? I'm way ahead of most of my friends. \n\nThe fact that you're here, on this sub or just reading finance news in general puts you ahead of 90% of other 19 year olds. Get involved, invest what you can but if you have no money it is what it is. Finish school, and keep up with the news. Your time will come. There WILL be the next wave to get in on.

        "body": "- The stock was heavily shorted because their brick and mortar business model was pretty much going extinct and they were in debt. The short sellers, however, ignored some fundamental catalysts like the new console cycle and that ps5 and xbox one would work with game disks (correct me if I'm wrong here).\n\n- They also ignored the fact that GME's online sales had gone up quite significantly. All of this led some redditors early in the game to believe that this was a company that would not go bankrupt. They then had a deal with Microsoft which pumped the stock higher.\n\n- Enter Ryan Cohen. The founder of Chewy ($CHWY) saw the potential in GME and wrote an angry letter imploring them to find better ways of leveraging their popularity and shifting their business online. He has since upped his investment and has more comrades on board.\n\n- All of the above meant that GME was priced very low and was actually a value investment because of the good things coming up for this company. Institutions and retail investors started buying this stock and it kept going up.\n\n- There is evidence that the short sellers kept increasing their position hoping for a reversal that never came. Now their brokers are restricting short selling for GME and as the stock pumps higher, they are closer and closer to getting margin called.\n\n- When that happens, they will be forced to close their positions and buy shares. Creating a short squeeze. The catch here is that there are not enough shares available to buy and close their positions. Essentially, they would have to buy it from insiders or institutions who will most probably not be willing to sell their stake.\n\n- The above would create an infinite short squeeze which would make us all very rich if we could time our exit. \n\nSomeone from r/wallstreetbets correct me if I missed anything.

        "body": "Market cap is a seriously terrible metric to look at here. That measures the 'size' of a single corporate entity, not an industry. Also, I think you are misinterpreting 'giant multinational corporations' as belonging to a specific country. That just isn't true. Microsoft and Google for example are headquartered in the US but have employees all over the world. \n\n\\- Canada actually does make cars there are a handful of major manufacturing plants in Ontario. There are also automotive research and design offices. Yes, the companies are headquartered in the US, but that doesn't mean they have no Canadian content. \n\n\\- Canada has a number of hardware companies. ATI which used to design graphics cards was Canadian until it got purchased by AMD. They still have offices in Canada and the graphics cards are competitive with the best made anywhere. I don't think any of the GPU manufacturing is actually in Canada, but lots of the R&amp;D is done here. \n\n\\- Canada does have a significant pharmaceutical industry, it is just small compared to the US where profits can be many times higher due to the high per-person healthcare spending in the US.  Often times viable products designed in Canada get purchased by larger American companies before they reach consumers so you don't realize the Canadian connection. Canada also has facilities to make vaccines, they just don't happen to be compatible with the new type of vaccine being used for COVID (mRNA). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere have been some notable Canadian tech failures. Nortel for example was the world leader in advanced telecommunications technology. Unfortunately, it fell victim to a combination of incompetent management and corporate espionage where it had its designs stolen from competitors. BlackBerry is a bit similar in that it completely DOMINATED the world's smartphone market for well over a decade before Apple disrupted the market with the first-gen iPhone. The smartphone market eventually saw everyone else either make android phones or sell off the cellphone business. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCanadian companies often sell out to large multinational companies. They just have the resources such that it doesn't make sense for someone small to compete against them, it's better to join them.",

I have no idea what they have thought up for the future but we do have a glimpse of it and to me it seems like a great business model. People don't want to stop going to retail stores, it's just right now they have to, retail stores aside though their e-commerce sales this year went up some 800%. That's no joke and it appears they are currently redoing their online presence as well. My guess is they are going to make it feel VERY nice to use their website and I would imagine there will be perks involved also. \n\nhttps://news.microsoft.com/2020/10/08/gamestop-announces-multiyear-strategic-partnership-with-microsoft/\n\nThis is almost all I need to be on board long term. This is huge. \n\nAlso they are about to open PC stores is building stations. That is huge also. PC gaming is BLOWING up rn. I would be they have something in the works to be able to deliver very nice PCs for a very nice price. The competition for retail PC gaming would be low. Around me there's microcenter but they only have so many stores, i think less than 10. So the next one is best buy, but they barely carry gaming pc parts. It's mainly office computers and printers, boomer shit. Yeah you can get stuff online and delivered to your house. I personally am the guy who buys all the shit online and picks up at the store in case I need something extra or have questions. The idea of gamestop having all of this stuff and probably a pc specialist to help with builds is a huge green light. Imagine all the people that go home and build their pc alone with a youtube vid up would be replaced by just going in and building it with someone at gamestop (not sure if that's the plan but maybe?). \n\nAs far as the online goes, again their e-commerce went up 800% and now they have a possible ceo who grew a HUGE online brand and obviously knows that market well. Gamestop already has the branding they just need to convince people to switch to using them for their gaming needs which personally I'm going to put my money where my mouth is and start getting what I need from gamestop when I can. \n\nLots of it also comes down to just believing in RC. Which I have decided after his recent tweets I do. He wants this shit to work, and he turned millions into billions once already. Imagine what he can do with an already established gamestop. I honestly believe all it needs is the new ideas and outlook he and his buddies will bring to completely turn the company around. \n\nI'd love to see a fucking squeeze I'm the next week or so because my investment is pretty small. If there is a squeeze, my plan is reinvest all my profits back into gamestop after the price goes way down again or stabilizes to hold long term and then put my initial investment into bb immediately.

        "body": "Known Vulnerabilities is exactly on point.\n\nI have a degree in Computer Science,  I\u2019ve engineered systems that run on Windows, Unix, Linux, containers using Docker and Kubernetes.  Open source software will always have more known vulnerabilities because the code base is easily viewed.  Many people with diverse engineering backgrounds can view that code.  This leads to more vulnerabilities being found, but also to more of those vulnerabilities being fixed, and fixed faster than closed source operating systems.\n\nThere\u2019s a reason why Black Hat hackers love to take advantage of organizations that use windows.  It\u2019s not that Linux is impossible to hack but exploiting windows is easier by an order of magnitude.  Those people that hack for profit usually take the path of least resistance to profit.\n\nAs of macOS Catalina Apple removed all old NeXTSTEP(based on BSD Unix 4.4) code and the OS is now entirely based on FreeBSD Unix with some Apple custom written code on top of it.\n\nFreeBSD is an entirely open source operating system.  It has many contributors but not as many as Linux and is not as popular, it is still considered more secure by miles than the windows kernel.\n\nWindows makes some very stupid architectural decisions when it comes to security.  Couple that with the performance of the windows kernel  vs the Linux kernel and you now know why most cloud providers exclusively offer Linux.\n\nMicrosoft relies on \u201ccapturing\u201d your business and making it difficult to use other technologies as integrating with a Microsoft ecosystem is more opaque than say integrating Linux systems with FreeBSD.  Hell even the majority of Azure Cloud instances are running some kind of linux.\n\nIntegration is the name of the game in tech the tech world at the moment.  Any company not moving to the cloud and away from Microsoft is frankly behind the curve.\n\nHow does this relate to blackberry?  Blackberry devices use two operating systems Blackberry 10 and Android.  Blackberry 10 Based on QNX shown in this chart had its last release three years ago in April and the company has moved to android as of 2019.  Like Microsoft and their Azure Cloud Platform  Blackberry sees that custom homegrown closed source operating systems are dying.  I have a feeling that before the end of the decade Microsoft Windows will either be defunct or will no longer use the closed source NT kernel and be a distribution of Linux or based on some kind of Unix.\n\nTech companies are seeing the writing on the wall folks the open source operating system revolution isn\u2019t just a passing fad but a trend that\u2019s been on the rise for years.  Don\u2019t bet on the losers folks, bet on where the tech industry is innovating, open source software and platforms.\n\nAnyone telling you to buy BB based on Blackberry QNX is either ignorant to the latest trends in tech or are trying to pump the stock and make money off your ignorance.",

This is wrong in many ways. The plan isnt to keep selling games, but somehow do it online, and thus stay in bussiness. The plan is to switch focus to becoming a cultural center for everything gaming. The one stop for gaming, a game stop if you will. Imagine stores filled with PC parts and accecories, gaming collectibles, esports events and an internet cafe section with cunning employees who can help you with anything computer or gaming related. All these items are high-margin items in a market that is growing by over 10% yoy with some projections showing future growth to be even higher. Heck even today 1/6th of Gamestops revenue, about 1 billion dollars, already comes from collectibles and that stuff is high margin af. Over 33% of revenue comes from online sales and their website is shit. Imagine if you had people who were actually cunning in e-commerce running the show with 55 million registered members in the US alone...\n\nThats how they improve cashflow, along with shutting down stores that arent profitable or barely profitable and which woudlnt make sense to renovate on the scale necessary.  The whole going bankrupt thing is a joke as well, they have been improving their margins and cut costs by over half in 2020 alone, if you think a shift to higher margin items already take place,  a halving in cost and all the other changes will have them loose as much money as they did during 2020 and will go bankrupt in 6-8 months then you are beyond saving\n\nLastly let me touch on your short-squeeze comments. This is the place where I can notice the most that you didnt do any research, since noone is saying that we are in the short squeeze right now, or that Melvin capital has been covering their shorts. Reverse there have been like 1000 posts by now about how the short interest has actually increased to record levels in the past week. This is a good thing, it means the squeeze would be based off of current levels, which are about 2x what they were before, and that there is more squeezing to be done since more shorts would need to cover their position. Just sustaining this price levels, without a jump in price once RC announces his plan for Gamestop going forward, or when he inevitably increases his share % to 19.9% or if Gamestop has a profitable quarter, even if none of that happens, shorts would have to sell their positions within 2 months or they would loose more in fees than the entire earnings potential of their positions and thats not even taking into account the literal billions of dollar they have paid in fees to maintain them so far. Even if you didnt think Gamestop had a long future ahed of it, the short squeeze would still be very likely. \n\nLet this be a lesson, dont go calling Ryan Cohen, Michael Burry and the tons of other GME investors who are way smarter than you retards. Best of luck trading and please short GME for us.",

        "body": "I would probably be defined as a bear by most on here, but you still have to get time-frames correct. Until then, you might as well ride momentum.\n\n&gt; Vaccine is rolling out, interest rates are low for the next decade, a stable president is going into office, and trade war with China is finally coming to an end as China and US move towards friendship once again. \n\nFirst off, you're getting this stuff wrong. \n\n1. Biden has been very vocal that he will continue to work ***against*** China. Hence his support for Pompeo's labeling of genocide, and his reaction against China's sanctions against Trump's staff members. Thinking things are just going back to normal here is completely wishful thinking.\n2. Vaccine rollout is going, but it's hitting hiccups, and we're also facing potential new variants of the virus which are more contagious. Hard to say how much this does or doesn't matter, but it's something that the market does not seem to be pricing in right now.\n3. Interest rates being low is not necessarily as supportive as you may think. The market could easily view this through the lens of \"if we see another economic shock, there is no more ability to lower rates\". IE, removing the fed put to a degree. And yes, I know we can go negative, but that causes other problems and for now, the fed has been vocal about not wanting this. In other words, it would likely take a very significant shock for the fed to decide to go negative on rates. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The Stuff You're Missing**\n\n1. Debt, debt, and lots of debt. Most financial crises are a product of debt in one way or another. And guess what the entire world has? Far more debt than we've ever had before. We also have worse demographics, and worse growth. Hence why the global economy has been propped up by central banks for the last few years, unable to transition back to ***not*** requiring QE / zero percent rates. \n2. The problem with the above is that now that everyone is at zero percent rates, there is a transition towards using more fiscal policy to stimulate. That's required because monetary policy is no longer as effective, we're already at zero percent rates, and it's just causing it's own problems. Fiscal policy typically causes inflation. Inflating over-indebted societies causes financial crises, generally speaking.\n3. We're still out of a ton of jobs. More than the GFC, more than any time since the depression. While some will come back upon reopening, a lot won't. That's a problem, especially if those people can't transition  back into working effectively. \n4. Long term interest rates keep rising with more promise for fiscal policy. This causes tightening in our economy that we simply can't handle. At some point, the market will start to price in rising long term interest rates as a big negative for risk assets, especially the high-p/e stocks that have been the major trade for most market participants over the last 4-5 years.\n5. Record speculative market activity typically mean-reverts at some point. We've seen a shit ton of speculation in the last few months especially, major call option yolo'ing tends to mean revert once the supply of $ to the people buying these items slows down. Those call options have done wonders in pushing markets upwards, but it will require a constant supply of purchasing to keep markets elevated. It's a supply-demand thing in reality, and the supply of buyers speculating in meme stocks is not going to stay at the current pace long-term. When that slows down, you'll likely get a move downward that's even sharper than the move upward.\n6. Zero percent rates push everyone into far more risky financial assets. This has two effects. First, it can push the market up by providing a bid for those risky assets. But on the other hand, it introduces more downside risk if things start moving the opposite way. In short, we get market support at the cost of increasing market fragility and the propensity to see large shocks downward when stuff breaks.\n7. Antitrust + less business friendly political environment. This is a risk that has been considered for a long time, but it's much more likely to happen now. Antitrust suits can take out market leaders ala Microsoft in 2000. Taking out market leaders = bad for markets as a whole. FWIW, I don't think Biden is going to make the environment \"bad\" for business, it's just that we're transitioning away from an administration that created the most favorable financial conditions for corporates in history.\n\nThere is more I can add. But there is **always** more stuff to worry about. Markets do climb a wall of worry, and in today's market structure, we tend to see grinding slow rides upwards with very sharp and sudden selloffs downwards. Markets can and do stay elevated far longer than most bears usually think possible. \n\nRegardless, there is ***plenty*** of very real and very noteworthy risk in the markets today. I would argue there is more now than almost ever before, but we also are getting more government support at a quicker rate than ever before. This prevents cascading impacts of negative economic shocks in a lot of ways, which then provides confidence for investors to speculate.",

Comparing December numbers where there was massive lockdown where retailers left and right are closing stores is going to hurt GME. No SHIT SHERLOCK. With the difficulty  in procuring any gaming hardware in general, just look at PC hardware or PS5/Xbox Series X, of course sales will be down in general. Most of their business \"AT THE MOMENT\" is still retail, they're not going to post gang buster numbers in December. Instead what we'll most likely see is a spread out increase in their earnings over several quarters as opposed to all front loaded as they normally are in the holiday season.\n3. Their E-Commerce jumped 300% also same as 2. They are comparing literally end of cycle numbers, PANDEMIC lockdown, supply shortages and zero rev from Microsoft shared earnings are included in there. I thought the market is forward looking not backwards.\n4. Hedge funds are WRONG ALL THE FUCKEN TIME just look at TSLA. Only time will tell how high GME will go but at this price point you are dead fucken wrong. As for GME, these retards were at the fucken sleep at the wheel, when GME traded at 3$, any fucken person with a brain cell would of closed out their position after a 98% possible GAIN and put their capital elsewhere. These \"reputable hedge fund\" are fucken greedy pigs that are getting slaughtered.\n5. Except they're SPECIFICALLY SAID in their earnings THEY DO NOT NEED MONEY.

They are sitting on 500m CASH and paying back debt EARLY, they're going to be swimming in cash from the new console cycle, THEY HAVE 102m STILL ALLOCATED CASH TO STOCK BUYBACK.

GameStop*\n\n*Trading at just 0.4 times revenue, GameStop (NYSE:GME) is severely undervalued because, well, everyone seems to doubt it -- and not for unjustifiable reasons. In fact, over $1.36 billion of the company's $2.19 billion worth of shares are sold short. Many investors see no reason not to bet against a brick-and-mortar retailer that is still selling physical copies of video games when they are nearly universally available online.*\n\n*If this is your view, you may be surprised to learn that GameStop is still doing pretty well despite its fair share of challenges. During its nine-week holiday sale ended Jan. 2, the company managed to bring in $1.77 billion in revenue, a modest decline of 3.1% from the same period last year. But in the interim, management closed 11% of its stores for being unprofitable; after adjusting for that, sales for the remaining locations actually went up.*\n\n*GameStop now has a robust e-commerce segment -- it's growing at a stunning rate of 309% year over year, and it accounts for over a third of total revenue. Last year, management signed an agreement with Microsoft to update its stores with the tech giant's software and cloud data solutions. In return, GameStop will be eligible for a commission on all digital revenue (such as video game purchases) generated from Microsoft's Xbox platform.*\n\n*Ryan Cohen, a co-founder of online pet food retailer Chewy, joined GameStop's advisory board on Jan. 11. His venture capital firm now owns 13% of the company's outstanding shares.*\n\n*Given these catalysts, I expect GameStop to turn around its operations in no time. Over the past year, its stock is already up a whopping 683%. Even after an amazing run up, though, its market cap ($2.6 billion) is still less than half its annual revenue ($6.46 billion). That makes for a price-to-sales ratios (P/S) far lower than what most retailers are trading at. If you're looking for stocks with the potential to double over time, consider GameStop.*",
