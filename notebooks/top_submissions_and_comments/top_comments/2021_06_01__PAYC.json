        "body": "Hi Friend, \n\nRather than doing deep dives I strongly suggest you focus on historic revenue / profit growth and future revenue / profit projections.   These are by far the most reliable indicators of future performance and the easiest to learn.\n\nProjections are extremely important.  They represent the combined knowledge of the \"deep dives\" of several or even dozens of highly trained analysts.   Any one of these analysts may have strong biases that would lead their analysis astray (note the wide spread in projections for many companies).  However, combining their projections into mean and median projections tends to counter the biases and give a moderately reliable indication of future prospects of a company.  And in fact these combined analyses are the standard by which all stocks are judged on earnings day, so it pays to know them.  \n\nStick to companies with a history of &gt;15% annual revenue growth over the previous five years and the same for the future 1-2 years.  Always look at the 5-10yr price chart.  The last few years at least should be a solid uptrend. \n\nI suggest before investing you do a stock screen for \"mid cap\" companies with &gt;15% revenue growth over the last five years.  I just did one and it gave 121 companies.  Now look at the 10 year chart for every company.  Set the chart axis to \"Log\".  Make a list of the companies with a strong, solid, continuous 3-5yr uptrend.  This indicates that the company has a product that can drive increasing sales.  \n\nHere are some examples of great charts: PODD, CHGG, RNG, SMAR, PANW, PEN, PAYC\n\nHere are some examples of shitty charts: TAP, APPN, PLAN,  LNG, BMRN, BERY, ATHM\n\nHere are some examples of \"tweeners\": ALNY, ANET, CZR, DBX\n\nThe \"tweeners\" are on an uptrend but the ride is pretty wild.  Avoid that until you get more experience.  \n\nHere are two other interesting charts: FATE, ENPH\n\nLook at each with the linear and log axis.  See how changing the axis to log shows you the growth trend better?  With the 10yr chart in linear mode, these look like companies with a wild recent price spike.  With that same chart in log mode, you can see the company has a very strong growth trend.  IMO you should avoid these until you get more experience because they can turn around very rapidly!  But keep an eye on this kind of stock and see how it plays out. \n\nAfter you cull out companies by the charts, start looking at the revenue growth.  Cull out the companies with recent downturns or flats.  After that, look at the forward revenue growth.  Choose the companies with the strongest projections.  Then look for a price point - even if you have to wait a month or two - and buy.  Start with small positions ($0.5K-$2K)and work up as you gain confidence.  \n\nRemember that big companies that have made hundreds of billions of dollars for their investors took many decades to reach their current size - don't listen to this bullshit of \"don't follow trends\".  In fact you \\*\\*MUST\\*\\* follow trends - at least if you want to be a successful investor.   It's true that \"past performance doesn't guarantee future performance\".  It doesn't guarantee it, but it's the best indication available of future performance.  \n\nGood luck man!",
