Both of these companies make the float glass, temper it, and then put it in laminated frames. They they sell this glass to companies like JELD that puts it in framesand then sells it to the consumer for residential projects. For larger projects contractors buy this glass to put it in buildings they are building.\n\nPPG doesn't even make glass anymore. They only make paint. Their glass sector looks like it was bought by Vitro and is traded on MXN.\n\nYou literally have corning in there. They make specialty glass as in glass that does not go in commercial or residential buildings.",
