        "body": "Investing titan Jeremy Grantham made prescient calls about the bursting of bubbles in 2000 and 2008.\n\n\nIn an interview, he said the current market was eerily reminiscent of the dot-com bubble.\n\n\nHe also shared the four indicators that have lined up for the biggest wipeout of value. \n\n\n\nWhen Jeremy Grantham declared in January that \"the long, long bull market\n\nsince 2009 has finally matured into a fully fledged epic bubble,\" he said he knew there would be \"a substantial increase in crazy behavior\" before it all came crashing down. \n\nThe cofounder of Boston's Grantham, Mayo, van Otterloo &amp; Co. is famous for having made prescient calls about the bursting of the 1989 Japanese asset-price bubble, the 2000 tech bubble, and the 2008 real-estate bubble.\n\n\"The thing about a bubble is if you can find more money and more crazy investors, it can keep going,\" he told Insider. \n\nAs it played out, what Grantham saw in the fourth quarter as \"extreme overvaluation, explosive price increases, frenzied issuance, and hysterically speculative investor behavior\" escalated into even more remarkable events in the first quarter of this year. \n\nFrom the epic short squeeze in GameStop to the stratospheric rally of Dogecoin, the latest bout of market euphoria has even taken the spotlight away from special-purpose acquisition companies, which have raised $101.5 billion this year and secured $83.4 billion last year \u2014 more than the previous seven years combined. \n'This is eerily like 2000'\n\nTo Grantham, the tales of frenzy and mania today are eerily reminiscent of the tech bubble, but signs of cracks are already appearing in the SPAC market, where a sentiment shift, an oversupply, and regulatory scrutiny have led the IPOX SPAC Index down 23% from its February peak. \n\nGrantham, a Model 3 owner, said Tesla's price slump was another sign of the mania unwinding. The electric-vehicle maker's stock, which rose nearly eightfold in 2020, has fallen about 24% from its peak in January despite having delivered \"brilliant\" earnings results for the past two quarters.\n\n\"So this is eerily like 2000,\" he said. \"It doesn't mean it might end tomorrow or just be a blip.\"\n\n\nIn his view, the bursting of bubbles comes slowly and then all at once. For example, in 2000, the downfall started with Pets.com in March and then migrated to more respected small tech companies in April before hammering away midcap companies in June and Cisco \u2014 briefly the largest company \u2014 in July. \n\nBy September, the tech sector, which had been 30% of the market, was down about 50%. But the S&amp;P 500 was unchanged, and investors started to dismiss what had transpired as a healthy rotation, Grantham said. \n\n\"What it was really is the lack of confidence began to leak, not surprisingly, from those areas with the craziest amount of confidence where people had lost touch completely with any underlying fundamentals,\" he said. \"And then that spread through the system to merely enthusiastic stocks and finally reached the major market.\"\n\nEventually, the music stopped entirely. In September, the 70% of the market that had not been affected rolled over and dropped 50% in the following two years. \n\n\"It's like the termites that were nibbling away and working their way down,\" he said. \"When they covered enough ground slicing away like that, they stopped slicing and went for the rest of the market en masse.\"\n4 indicators have lined up \n\nThis time, the combination of the massive fiscal-stimulus program and the effective rollout of vaccinations is likely to push the bubble to last longer, according to Grantham. \n\nBut he doesn't think it will change the outcome where asset prices revert to a more reasonable level and investors enter a more pessimistic phase. \"What it means is the higher you go, the bigger the fall,\" he said. \n\nGrantham used the classic example of Japan, which inflated the biggest stock-market bubble of any developed country in the 1980s.\n\n\"At the time, everyone believed it was 65 times earnings,\" he said of the price-to-earnings ratio on the Nikkei. \"So that was just massive. The consequence is we are now 32 years later and the market is still not back where it was in 1989 in Japan.\"\n\nSimilar to how Japan suffered from a \"lost decade\" of economic stagnation following the collapse of the asset-price bubble in 1991, another thing to consider in a bubbly environment is the negative-wealth effect, Grantham said. \n\nWhile the burst of the dot-com bubble dragged down the stock market, the net drag on the American economy was over pretty quickly. By comparison, the 2008 financial crisis affected not only Americans with stock portfolios but also ordinary homeowners who were sucked into the real-estate bubble. \n\nThe housing market has become dangerously overheated once again, with multiple gauges of housing-market activity resembling their pre-2008 levels.\n\n\"Looking at the inventory of housing and looking at the availability of money sloshing around in the system,\" Grantham said, \"it is almost certain that, in the next few months, the US the housing market will pass the previous all-time high of 2006 and will establish a new high multiple of family income.\"\n\nAnother indicator flashing warning signals is the bond market, which has become perhaps more expensive than stocks as a material chunk of global sovereign debt has negative yields, meaning that investors pay to lend governments their money. \n\nAside from stocks, bonds, and real estate all being prohibitively expensive, commodities are also flashing warning signs. Driven by a global supply-chain shortage, commodities such as lumber, copper, steel, wheat, and cotton have all experienced huge price surges to reach multiyear highs. West Texas Intermediate crude oil had bounced back from minus $38 per barrel to about $65 as of Friday in just over a year. \n\nWhen commodity prices soar to record highs, the economy is vulnerable to a sharp contraction as consumers become more reluctant to make purchases and lofty prices of raw materials erode the margins of manufacturers. Specifically, surging oil prices were followed by recessions in every decade from the 1970s through the 2000s. A case in point is the 2008 oil shock, when oil prices hit $140 a barrel in the summer of 2008 from just $50 a barrel in early 2007.\n\nTo be sure, similar signs of asset-price bubbles are shooting up around the world, but \"in America, we have the real McCoy, we've got everything lined up,\" Grantham said.\n\nAs the \"craziest, most overconfident, and overpriced stocks\" such as Tesla start to show weaknesses while the rest of the market continues to go up as it did in 2000, the end might just be in sight, he added. \n\n\"This is pretty bad on a very broad front,\" he said. \"We will have to live, potentially, possibly, with the biggest loss of perceived value from assets that we have ever seen.\"",

I was running a startup hoping to IPO, and I had dozens of friends who were paper millionaires with their stock options, and most wound up worthless. I started with $5k in 1998, and by 2000, I had over $200k in my Schwab account. I thought I had cracked the code, and I was feeling pretty invincible.\n\nIn Feb 2000, I shorted some tech stocks, then bailed when they kept going up and took my losses. As the bubble started to burst, I put all my money in \"safe\" profitable tech stocks (Cisco, Oracle, Network Solutions and Intel). A month later the bottom fell out. It was a roller coaster ride, with enough ups to make you think it was coming back. My \"safe\" stocks lost a bundle. I rode two companies into the ground, and lost 90% on others. \n\nToday, Cisco and Oracle are worth less than they were 21 years ago. Despite consistent earnings increases, they never grew into those valuations. (Yes, I wish I had put everything in AAPL, GOOG and AMZN instead).This market feels \"frothy\" (to quote someone smarter than I am). There will always be winners and losers, but when the market loses its collective mind every time someone says \"inflation\" or \"tightening\" it's concerning. I'm still long, but it seems like it's time to think about taking some chips off the table soon.",

Maybe that's an exaggeration, but I wouldn't touch the stock. There are deep content pools that legacy studios are putting together that will really eat into Netflix, including, ironically enough, the assets of TimeWarner formerly owned by AOL which are now the bundle that is HBOMax. \n\nAny company that isn't an existing conglomerate (like Amazon) that has the word \"cloud\" in its short description worries me. Don't get me wrong, the so-called \"cloud\" is really cool, but I suspect it will be like the old telcos that spent tens of billions burying fiber. Of course, in the long haul that fiber was needed and it was critical for rolling out the data hungry streaming model, but a huge percentage of it got placed and then sat dormant. It absolutely buried companies that were high fliers (you have to understand it wasn't just a dot com bubble, there was an entire telecom bubble as well). A lot of stuff with \"cloud\" in it will probably find a similar fate. There will be winners just like Amazon eventually gained the title of internet commerce king, but the carcasses of the dead will lay across Wall Street only to be forgotten in a few years. \n\nOne that I remember thinking was a turd was PLUG. Look at the max chart on that thing. I still wouldn't buy that. Maybe I'm totally wrong, maybe not. I think TSLA is also overvalued. I'm not saying it's a bad company or anything, but its valuation metrics are way out of whack. \n\nYou have to understand in that era guys would go on CNBC and talk about some new internet IPO was worth x billion because it had y million \"eyeballs.\" I'm not exaggerating. They would multiply page views by 2 and use it as a metric for valuation. That whole thing to me felt like the bigger idiot theory taken to the extreme, but even that feels more reputable than the people who push crypto on CNBC. \n\nI have cash. I want to deploy it because of inflation risks, but there's virtually nothing I want to touch right now so I've just been nibbling on Boomer stocks and swing trading SPY options. \n\nOh, and one other thing. Funds. Back then Janus Twenty was all the rage. They had closed it to new investors. People would brag that they were in it. It had all the high flyers. AOL, Cisco, JDSUniphase, Intel, Microsoft and Oracle. That reminds me of that ARK fund or whatever it is called. Again, not everything in the J20 was a terrible company, but valuations got so out of whack that things like INTC have never returned to their highs and MSFT and ORCL, while good companies, were dead money for over a decade. I think a company like TSLA has the chance to find itself in that sort of company where the stock takes a decade plus to touch its ATH again.",

Very bullish for long term investment in nokia imho. (I have 1871 shares).\"\n\nAlso nokia offers fastest inhouse switch fabric (FP4) and competitors have nothing to compete against that. Nokia is gaining market share from cisco etc. Because of this chip. Google \"Nokia and Elisa push network boundaries with world\u2019s first 1T deployment\". Theres this line: \"Most networks are still operating a multitude of 100GE ports, with 400GE on the horizon.

BB revenue between FY20 - 21 dropped 10%, Crowdstrike grew 80%, Zscaler grew 46%, PNW 18%, Sailpoint 27%. You're comparing a declining company with booming companies and expecting them to share the same valuation.\n\nNot to mention - you're either unaware, or not mentioning the **actual** competitors to BB. Blackberry's Cylance/UEM is more comparable to VMware, or Cisco. Both of which have P/S of around 5, like BB. Companies like Zscaler and SPT don't really have endpoint management or security software, and Crowdstrike's tech blows BB out of the water. Tbh most UES/M companies tech blows BB out of the water - Microsoft, Symantec, VMware etc. PNW UES isn't the best - but they've got a myriad of fantastic enterprise security products besides that, and they don't trade at multiples like Crowdstrike. Don't just lump all companies at the same valuations because they're in the cybersec space - that shows a serious lack of information about the nuances of the industry.\n\nAnd BB isn't really a serious company when talking about cybersec. This is popular misinformation spread around this sub - when companies are talking seriously about enterprise security, at the top of their minds isn't BB.\n\nAlso it's a plain lie to say BB has a moat on all its products. They're barely a competitor on UEM/S. The only moat is QNX, which is an incredibly low revenue product - literally like 4$ or less per car per year.\n\nSaying Chen takes his compensation primarily in stock is also stupid. Most CEOs take their compensation primarily in stock - it's how boards and shareholders enforce that share price is a priority to CEOs. Chen also has sold millions upon millions of stock - he's clearly not forseeing some huge price increase.",

Amazon and Alibabas model is to enter markets in anticipation of competition, even if its  loss leader.\n\nThis is why Buffett avoids technology, because its almost impossible to predict what technology business can sustain itself for decades, unlike say Coke or Gillette.\n\nApple was almost done in the 90s as a company, Microsoft had a lost decade. IBM ruled technology for 50 years, Cisco had its days, Oracle, Sun Microsystem, on and on.\n\nToo many people think FAANG will be around a decade from now, because they can't envision the next disruptor but that is precisely how tech works. The business that will disrupt FAANG will probably be created 2-3 years before they begin doing damage to them.\n\nYahoo was founded in 1994 it IPOed in 1996, and by 2000 was the number 1 internet site in the world.

People look at the self-selective group who post 500% gain on those assets and think that they could have been in those assets too. But that is survivorship bias. \n\nHype eventually died down. Hype and trend investors are, by definition, fickle and change their minds constantly. If you choose to invest with them, you have to follow their sentiment. All the while remember that the fees from a high number of transaction cut away your profit. An analogy to speculative trading is poker: poker becomes a negative sum game the longer the game goes on because as the number of transactions (hands) increase in the game, the higher the sum of cost of the game to all participant is (time spending on DD, transaction, dealer's fee). The pie becomes increasingly smaller the more hands are played. Sure, a small percent of players do earn a living, but compared that to the opportunity cost of had they engaged in some other profession like IT, law, or medical, and it's not clear that the time spent on trading/playing is worth the cost, at least not until you have a sizable portfolio (say, 10 mil+).\n\nSome of these traders think that their hyped picks will become an AMAZON. But what people fail to realize is for every AMAZON winner, there's 10 CISCO losers. It's dangerous to bet that you will be in the lucky 10% of ANYTHING to make a profit. For me, value investing is because the fundamentals of a company is solid enough that, even if that particular company never becomes a meme, I can still put my entire portfolio and come out ahead, if only by the natural growth of the company. I can easily put my life savings into value company such AAPL, but the same cannot be said for TSLA or GME.",

        "body": "True. If you look at all the subs on each of the hype stock, everything is a screaming buy at every level of price. They cannot all be right. Everythingmoney's premise is you take a lot of risk investing in a high PE ratio for future gains that might never come. If AMZ's growth never materialized, you would have never heard about it from the investors who would have lost money. And for every AMZ who made it, there are 10 Cisco whose value are still below their ATH back in 2000. \n\nI don't think people on this sub remember how close AMZ were on the verge of bankruptcy from 2000-2004 and Ebay was dominant. Are people seriously thinking that they would have been able to hold AMZ through that period? Gimme a break.\n\nPoint is, you can't make investing decision, or any decisions for that matter, based on hindsight. Because, based on hindsight, going all in using margin on GME in Jan 2021 and sell at $500 would have been the best decision ever. Recommending against AMZ was the right decision from a value perspective (and probably is still correct, again, based on value).",

Bleeding.  I should have put stoplosses on it but thought it would go up more the next day.  Saw the exit at about 15% gain but let it ride next day. Lesson learned, always stoploss to secure profit, minimize loss. Hoping for a solid Monday or I will have to cut losses.\n\nAlready been in Baba for a while running PMCC, going to expand position and be careful of how far otm the CC are in case it runs.\n\nSame with Aapl.\n\nAdded some CAT today.  Going to set stoploss on Monday and see if it will run anymore.  Saw that you just exited. Even right now.\n\nAdded KMI, seems to be solid.  PMCC on this one because is seems to be a tortoise stock (slow and steady) with good gains already.\n\nOn the wrong side with Tsla, TSM, Pton, Twtr (after drop).  Looking to exit about where you want to short it. TSM seems to be a good PMCC stock because it just hangs around $115 to $122.\n\nPlanning to add ON Long and some shorts on PCG, Dash, Bynd, Afrm, Cisco, QS next week.\n\nAlso saw a comment earlier that ZM is a buy under $300 but I have been bleeding on it the last week just got out yesterday. Looks like it is in a downward trend down.  Also tech and market hates tech right now, any thoughts? Enter a long position with tight stoploss?",

Someone willing to do a lot more DD could easily refute me, but I don't believe any of these companies have much of a moat and even so, they are one failure away from dropping off a cliff. MSFT will survive the recent hack. SolarWinds maybe not so much. Shell, Kroger and a number of others were hacked, they will all survive, but the cyber security company Accelion who is responsible for the vulnerability, who knows.

Cisco was and is a great company, yet it has never recovered to pre-dotcom levels, and you were in the red with Amazon too for like a decade if you bought at highs before the collapse.\n\nFor shittier companies that are valued to tens of billions of dollars without making a single dime of profit, there will be a rude awakening, or at least for their investors.\n\nAddressing your last paragraph, I might be relying on \"outdated financial discipline viewpoints\", whatever the fuck that is (it sounds like you're essentially saying the \"this time it's different\" bs), but at least I'm not relying on hindsight bias and survivorship bias to formulate my models.",

On the other hand, a company priced at $10 which you see as worth $100 has a huge margin of safety. Even if you were off dramatically and it\u2019s true value is $50, you have bought the company at a great price.\n\nPrice to book ratio uses tangible assets, which in the early 20th century America (think Ben Graham) was highly correlated with earning power due to the American economy being more industrial than it is today. Think of companies like Microsoft, Facebook, or Google which need relatively little tangible assets to generate revenues via online advertising, selling subscriptions, etc. Business value is generally accepted to be the present value of future cash flows, so the value of tangible assets today are very dependent on the industry in which a company operates.",

If AAPL stock goes on a run, VOO is going to rise considerably less than straight up owning AAPL.\n\nThe main question you need to ask yourself is if you think you can pick the next AAPL, GOOG, AMZN, MSFT, etc.  If the answer is yes, then it might be better to sell off your current positions in AAPL and MSFT and invest in those.  \n\nIn my opinion, AAPL and MSFT are very safe bets for the time being.  The market is really whacky right now and I would be hesitant to sell those in favor of some other small or mid cap stock that you hope might one day join the ranks of the big boys.",

I can anecdotally confirm from my tech peers.  Also many large companies prefer one vendor and AWS is also cheaper to boot.\n\nAs you know Managers/Execs aren't often tech-savvy and many wouldn't even understand the benefits of Fastly and simply go with AWS.

From what I have read, dividends and value are what folks like during times of inflation and economic uncertainty. Warren buffet invests in value and it stands the test of time. Growth is basically what we have been in after the 2000 bubble recovery, pretty much big gains as the US shifted from industry to tech (Microsoft, apple, google, amazon leading the s&amp;p 500 funds). Time in the market and time period trends are what matters here IMO. Long term/far from retirement = more risk/growth funds, short term during times of uncertainty/closer to retirement = value/dividends/cash. If you are not an active investor and are close to retiring value and dividend are attractive because risk is lower. Could be wrong though, I just read crap on the internet, lol.",

You\u2019re pretending people hold boomer stocks until they die, yet it\u2019s widely agreed that it\u2019s safer and smarter to invest more and more into bonds or the likes, than to have your money in volatile assets that could take a much bigger hit in the time frame you need it. That has nothing to do with believing or disbelieving in the market, that\u2019s taking financial security seriously.\n\nJust because you don\u2019t have a reason to sell doesn\u2019t mean you can speak for the mind of millions. After all, if you intend to enjoy the fruits of your investments, you sell. \n\nThat\u2019s not the difference between investing and trading. You just come across like a smart ass, implying meanings where there are none. Investing and trading aren\u2019t mutually exclusive, you can have both, one or neither. There\u2019s no hard rule like you\u2019re stating. \n\nI never stated what the major players are doing. I\u2019m sensible and don\u2019t speak for millions on data that doesn\u2019t exist because I feel some type of way. The burden of proof falls on those who are making the claim, which is you, me asking for proof is not me arguing for opposite. It\u2019s me arguing to back up your point with facts which you don\u2019t have. \n\nEverything you state is like it\u2019s some black and white opinion. Everything has to be this or that. Numbers don\u2019t speak for beliefs. But what do I expect from someone who doesn\u2019t understand volatility and that sometimes people need to protect themselves from the risk of loss. That volatile investments make for better short term trades, just as you always see volumes spike on massive volatility movements. When Microsoft starts going 20% in a night, than see if your statement holds true. Look at any volatile asset and look at its comparable trade volume. Btc has rose more than 10x Microsoft the past 3 months, if you want short term or big gains, where\u2019s your better chance? And ones beliefs have nothing to do with capitalizing on cryptos appreciation. \n\nFunny how you think you\u2019re educating anyone, but you lacked the knowledge to know you don\u2019t invest money you need immediately and was to worried about buying at the wrong time because you have no apparent ability to do an research on what you could guesstimate to be a fair price and target. From someone who infers useless data to go on about points they know nothing about, while not even understand the concept of volatility and millions of reasons why one could realize gains. \n\nHave a good one. I\u2019ll smack my head on the wall before I give you anymore time out of my day. I proved my point and that was that you couldn\u2019t back shit. The very fear mongering, fud I speak of that\u2019s nothing more than someone\u2019s else ignorant opinion.",

Crypto or BTC specifically, was a reaction to the financial crisis and how the government effectively exercised MMT tactics and bailed out large financial institutions and wealthy risky gamblers at the expense of the every day people. The purpose was to replace a fiat currency with this decentralized currency but that won\u2019t ever happen.

It's not an algorithm that chooses the stocks, it's a group of humans.\n\nThe S&amp;P 500, by its nature, will \"buy high\" and \"sell low\" because a company already needs to be successful to be added to the index and they remove unsuccessful companies.\n\nThere was a study a while ago that found that if you invested in the original list of companies in the S&amp;P 500 and didn't follow the index,  you'd outperform the index by a wide margin. That's because the index has a history of removing companies while they're down and later adding them back when they recover. If you simply held on to the companies, you'd have done better. And that even accounts for the fact that many of the original companies no longer exist.\n\nThe index was meant to track the state of the market, not provide the best returns. The fact that it's now a major investment is something the original designers of the index never intended.",

Market will correct due to a reason which is as of now currently unknown. Remember that markets always require a reason to correct, it doesn't matter what the reason is. The reason isn't important but the behaviour of the correction is far more important.\n\n I personally do not think the correction will be more than 20-25% so you can pretty forget about a big sized one because markets will never give you another such big opportunity to buy stocks at cheap prices because markets are not stupid. You will get cheaper prices, but not the prices you may still be satisfied with\n\n. Yes anything can happen in markets but I'm gonna go out on a limb and say its almost literally impossible for correction to be 40-50% range unless some country starts a war with usa or something or some huge volcano erupts and kills half of united states or some crazy shit like that.",

Soon (probably sooner than expected) the Fed will taper its QE and raise interest rates, which will eat into future earnings of companies who are unable to pass on the cost of rising commodity prices to consumers. The last period of high inflation was the 70s. I wasn't alive then and I'd wager that a huge percentage of you reading this weren't either. We don't have personal experience of high inflation. Everything is getting more expensive, and unless some of this inflation hits salaries (lol) we're going to see an outflow of capital from the stock market. \n\nPersonally, I'm looking at real estate, REITs, gold, uranium and will be dabbling in other asset classes which, historically, have done well during inflationary periods.",
