Whether the populace of the country ever see the monetary gains of the FAANG $5 is a different question, but they at least will see the technological progress. \n\nThe reality is your local family own store is inefficient and its failure assuming the same products are available (i.e. any online retailer) is just economic efficiency.",

They are a monopoly in leading edge lithography (especially EUV), but lithography is only 10% of the manufacturing process (but 20% of the costs because of that monopoly bit)\n\nThe process for manufacturing a microchip at the leading edge is mind boggling.  I remember seeing an old Intel process flow and there was about 600 process steps spanning across likely 100 different tools.  I haven't seen a flow for the latest nodes, these are fiercely guarded secrets that could have geopolitical ramifications, but I would assume there are well over a thousand steps now.  A leading edge fab will have thousands of tools all integrated into the most efficient manufacturing process in the world.\n\nI am not an expert, but I believe the foundry model works like this. \n\n1) foundry such as TSMC or Samsung build R&amp;D line to develop N+1 node (such as 3nm). The equipment likely costs a couple billion.  Thousands of engineers work to develop a process flow that meets customer expected specs and yield. This step happens ~3 years before commercial release.  Usually developed in close collaboration with key customers such as apple or qualcomm.\n\n2) pilot line created to ensure that process flow can enter into HVM (high volume manufacturing). I believe this is the step where the foundries work on the layout and efficiencies.  This is also a couple billion in equipment, but will utilize some equipment from step 1.\n\n3) HVM line is built to meet demand.  For TSMC and Samsung, this means $10B+ in equipment alone.  Then you need the thousands of trained engineers to run the fabs.  \n\nFor this model to work, TSMC will then need to have a long tail of customers that will use these nodes after the leading edge customers such as Apple move on.",

I was young, but I figured that tech was in a bubble but I still wanted to be in tech so I focused on profitable companies that were well respected by Wall Street.  Thinking that profitability would prop up companies in the event of a crash.  I also wanted to get into the new-fangled flat panel display market because I figured that they were going to be the next big thing.  Bought a canadian company called Genesis Microchip (GNSS) that met all of my criteria.\n\nEverything played out exactly how I expected it.  Market crashed, genesis didn\u2019t go down as much, flat panels took off.  But didnt really make any money on that trade.  If I had just bought the obvious winners I would probably have millions.  Hundreds of thousands at least.  Lesson learned: don\u2019t overthink it.  Don\u2019t try to chase P/E ratios and value in tech.  Look 10 years forward with the companies you buy.",

        "body": "Exactly!!! \n\nAlso the virus cannot survive in low temperatures. Not only that, no one is paying attention,  we're already close to herd immunization. Yes \"cases\" are skyrocketing which is a sign of herd immunization in combination with the lowest death tolls since the pandemic began. The virus has already killed as many baby boomers (the last remaining Great Depressioners have a far HIGHER rate of survivability than their successors the Baby Boomers!), morbidly obese and individuals with underlying health issues (not being mean...its just facts...survival of the fittest), also a greater portion of our population seems to either be immune or Asymptomatic, so the super spreaders did what both nature and immunization intended for them to do. \n\nYes the fear of the yearly \"flu\" is a concern for everyone...but if you take the time to actually look at the virus this last strain evolution is so similar to the flu virus itself but on a far higher level and it seems to not allow any other virus to infect a person unless it was already there, so the flu shouldn't really be concern. \n\nIf 1/2 the nation is hit with a snow front, shutting down airlines and travel impaction rendering the majority of citizens to remain home for 4 days or more....we effectively reduce this virus in the US Nation to low double digits to even  possibly single digits. \n\nI'm all for the vaccine in terms of gaining me a stupid amount of money and potentially making me rich and to allow us to return to some form of normality....but honestly they waited too long and I believe there is some shady in the shadows type of stuff that's not being addressed with the production of the vaccine and I'm not talking about the microchip conspiracy theories. \nNot really any trial runs, testings, etc...and then boom massive productions. \n\nCoronavirus is a new strain of the Sars virus.  It's a Sars virus that took on a new viral evolutionary path, but still holds Sars DNA. \nWhen china had that massive Sars outbreak years ago and it traveled to the US and affected many, many produced an immunity from being infected and others created another form of immunity (Asymptomatic), which would explain why so many hold those categories for this \"brand new virus\". \nSo we already had things to combat Sars after that very first introduction to it and we even incorporated it into the flu shot (just read what's in your yearly flu shot....it has the Sars vaccine in it...)\nI've never trusted Big Pharma since Obama sold us out to them and let them become a massive greedy overlord. We have 3 virus warehouses in the US, one of them right in here in my state of VA....they've already had a \"cure\" or rather vaccination for it, they knew that the virus would take out the weaker of the populace (population control), stifle the economy for a stronger reset, distract everyone from the issues that are happening over in the Middle East/Saudia Arabia (oil fields, we secured so many by answering the call of the King/prince of Saudia Arabia and defending his oil fields, giving us a massive amount as thanks and by demanding that he will ONLY trade in USD for his oil) as well as other things that not just our country has been doing but other countries sealing positions of power. \n\nWhy did Gyms of all places close down!? The place you go to get into shape? Getting in shape...shit just working out consistently improves your immune system. Not a single case of the virus has been reported from a gym....\n\nBut Liquor stores and convenience stores were allowed to remain open. \nSchools closed down...but...day cares were allowed open? \nGrocery stores were allowed open, which stimulated the retail market in profits of never before seen potential due to panic buying. \n\nThis was all a major reset, eventually leading to a change in power structure and allowing \"new\" money (potentially you, me, wsb) to enter the fray and potentially become new millionaires &amp; multimillionaires and putting \"old\" money at a cautious gaze. Baby boomers removed a massive portion of not ALL of their monies from the banking systems and from the Market!!! Allowing us to enter in and take hold of what they covetted (creation of new gods to challenge the old gods, sorry was watching 'American Gods'). \n\nAnd when everything is starting to settle...now we have a vaccine! Lol \nEvery vaccine has a small portion of the virus it protects against, I honestly feel that any baby boomer or anyone with a compromised immune system that takes the virus will probably die from it..not immediately but possibly 5yrs (again I can be horribly wrong), this vaccine is probably going to become mandatory nationwide. Seeing as it will put jobs at a dilemma with an employee that refuses to take it and other employees are afraid of becoming infected (even though they took the vaccine...smh), which would allow them to terminate that employee without any lawful action to be taken against them...\n\nThere's so many plays that are happening and will continue to happen. Part of me is actually seeing this as an opening for my/younger generations and a force out of older generations. An exchange of power and a reconstruction of our economic system and the flow of both finances and cash. \nThe housing market changed rapidly with rates so excessively low, mimicking the 2008 market crash as well as the 2000 dot.com bubble crash. \nBut look who is infiltrating and starting to control these businesses? \n\nTldr; Too many variables, too many possibilities....the virus is dying out by itself. Its ran its course and it starting to get really cold and its own survivability rate is dropping rapidly.",

Amazon - Dominant player in the cloud hosting space, and this will just become a bigger revenue stream. eCommerce should go up and I could see them gaining more advertising revenue than Google over time. Also moving in to health care\n2. Microsoft - Dominant in the cloud. Sound leadership and growth under Nadella.\n3. Alphabet - Advertising revenue. The leader in AI, which I expect will be further monetized in the next 10 years\n4. Alibaba - Chinese Amazon. Invested heavily in EVs\n5. Apple - Apple products not going away. Huge potential to gain market share across the globe\n6. Visa/Mastercard - FinTech will be huge. Could even see them acquiring PayPal/Square\n7. Tesla - If this turns out to be true it won't be because of the cars\n8. Johnson &amp; Johnson\n9. Walmart \n10. NVIDIA",

        "body": "If you\u2019re looking for super long term growth, the best bet is usually blue chips (I prefer KO, PEP, JNJ, MSFT, etc.) They will fluctuate up and down (so don\u2019t fret about green days vs red days) but over a period of 10-20 years they should grow in terms of decent value. For reference I\u2019ve held a $300 investment in KO for 23 years, and it\u2019s now valued over $3000 (was $3600 pre-pandemic). With blue chip stocks, the usual idea is to reinvest your dividends automatically. That\u2019s how you get more shares and over time bigger dividends. When I started with like 12-14 shares, I\u2019d get a $3 check maybe, but using the reinvestment option (eventually) without any additional self-purchasing of shares I was up to 61 shares because of the dividend reinvestment. And now I receive a dividend on 61 shares instead of 12, so obviously now much more than $3 per quarter.\n\nSpread out among a few good stable blue chips, ones that have weathered crises like (recessions and viruses). You also might be interested in doing ETF\u2019s, they cover sectors mainly, and they\u2019re usually more stable since they cover multiple stocks - however with lower risk comes less return usually. An ETF you\u2019re sort of playing by an average of whatever is in that portfolio.\n\nJust like with a 401k, typically the sooner you start, the better, since you\u2019re looking for that exponential growth with dividend payouts.\n\nBest of luck!",

So you need to manage your risk better and enter trades with more insight, so that you're not panicking in the future. Let this be a lesson learned.\n\nYou're not at a loss yet. Be patient, look for the spike to go up, when your options are worth a profit then consider selling them immediately to alleviate any more stress and anxiety to yourself, and consider it a valuable and inexpensive lesson.

By the next day the stock had recovered and I missed my window to close thanks to my broker fucking me when I needed to sell, which seems to be disturbingly common.\n\nI remember calling them and telling them I wanted a broker, not a babysitter. The dude sounded completely annoyed like he was my dad and doing me a favor. He wasn't wrong in hindsight. I was like a chimp with a machine gun back then. I'm better now. But damn...let the monkey shoot his load if he wants.\n\nFidelity isn't a bad broker. But they're like strict parents. They're not quick to trust or forgiving if you throw a party and their risk department flags you as a retard. TD is like your friend's cool parents who don't really give a fuck. And Robinhood is the skeevy guy outside the liquor store selling fake IDs. That guy will hook you up with whatever you want. He's cool, but not really a friend.

I said I didn't know. Then he looked at me with those penetrating blue eyes and simply said in that soothing voice \"She seems like she's hungry.\"\nThen he lifted up his shirt and breastfed my niece right there in the salon lobby. \n\n\nTrue story.",

Investors are giving us a lot of credit for future profits, but if, at any point, they conclude that\u2019s not going to happen, our stock will immediately get crushed like a souffl\u00e9 under a sledgehammer!\n\nMuch more important, in order to make our cars affordable, we have to get smarter about how we spend money.

A great idea would be on that saves $5, but the vast majority are 50 cents here or 20 cents there.\n\nIn order to make the electric revolution happen we much make electric cars, stationary batteries and solar affordable to all.\n\nThanks and great working with you as always,\nElon\"",

The right question is why can't we have one uniform impartial payment system for all international transactions. Instead we have a moronically slow and expensive but reliable wire system. On top of it we have fast and reliable credit card system that makes spending easy but you can't easily receive transactions as a private user. And we have the PayPal, that has mandatory consumer protections that encourage chargeback fraud making it unsuitable for any large scale business. \n\nAnd for some reason in every civilized country local wire transfers are nearly free and work well for any usecase. Why can't we have it globally?",

        "body": "&gt; Second, the majority of exchanges these days aren\u2019t sketchy. They are regulated \n\nFor real?  I understood Bitcoin is still unregulated.  Are you absolutely sure about that?\n\n&gt; Is PayPal sketchy?\n\n\nWell, from my experiencing using it to sell things, hell yes, PayPal is sketchy.  They have their own rules and screw the customer at every turn.  But of course you and I mean sketchy in comparison to these mtgox type scams I've heard about and in comparison, so yes PayPal is not going to vanish in the night.\n\n&gt; Is the CashApp sketchy? Is Square sketchy?\n\nAren't those the same?  Is Bitcoin on cash app for individuals or just Square merchants?\n\n&gt; Third, crypto wallets are difficult to use with no experience but I guarantee if you make one transaction using one it\u2019s easy from there; what task isn\u2019t tough at first?It\u2019s like when a middle school aged child starts doing algebra. At first it seems daunting but after a few lessons things get easier and you wonder why it ever seemed so difficult in the first place.\n\nI'll take your word for it.  I've jusg seen hundreds of messages where people post that they lost their bitcoins due to wallet issues, and then edgelords mock them for not doing these series of non-intuitive hold and cold and medium wallet transfers and for not making copies of copies of their keys, etc. \n\n&gt; The mining of the Bitcoin does take some electricity but it\u2019s the mining that makes the network decentralized. \n\nI'm not talking about the mining which of course is massively wasteful on electricity.  I mean the computation energy needed to verify a transaction.  Isn't that expensive on electricity and takes a long time to clear?\n\n&gt; The decentralization is key. Without it that's just another currency controlled by a central figure\n\nWell, I'm not as averse to hard currency.  I'll take any pesky centralized currency you are sick of holding :-)\n\n\n&gt; As long as the average person buys and holds Bitcoin long term the elite won\u2019t ever be able to get it all. \n\nBut would that just guarantee it's death?  What good is a currency that doesn't circulate, which nobody is willing to use for buying and selling things?  It would be like illiquid real estate.\n\n\n&gt; Remember, there will only ever be 21 million bitcoin.\n\nI've heard that. But I've also heard there's only 10% left to be unlocked?\n\n\n&gt; And don\u2019t forget, crypto can make buying things online more anonymous because your name doesn\u2019t or personal info doesn\u2019t need to be attached to crypto. \n\nTo me that would be a drawback.  I don't buy anything illegal, and I'd rather my neighbors pay their share of taxes, so I don't it to be easy for them to do tax fraud.  And can't any Sec Treasury declare a ban at any time on the hidden transactions? \n\n\n&gt; As you can see I believe in Bitcoin and what it can do for society. \n\nSo what do see as the benefit to society?  You've said it would bypass central bank, which may or may not benefit society.  And the other feature was making tax dodging and money laundering easy for criminals, which is basically the opposite of good for society.  \n\nI'm still wondering about the heavy cost and delays of transactions.  \n\nBut to me, something that would meet your goal of an alternative to central money would be if say Google started Google dollars and let people of any station in life transact instantly, safely, for free.  \n\nThey'd instantly chop the legs out of elitist banks and Visa/MasterCard/PayPal, and democratize transactions for everyone.  I'd think that's something you'd appreciate?  \n\nSo all the societal benefit but without the societal drawbacks of Bitcoin.\n\n&gt; Get in now before the FOMO starts.\n\nWell frankly I did a long time ago, before bitcoin crashed hard.  But I did it through proxies like Square and Overstock and Nvidia.  But not sure if there's a current proxy I like.",

A good example here are tail risk funds - which should payout massively during a pandemic (as an example) and be a small cost in normal operations. These funds are managed by money managers, like ackman and co. This service means that pensioners get a steady income flow.\n\nYour anger seems to be that those folks have higher leverage - the effort to manage 1 billion is not substantially higher than 10 billion. But in a market there\u2019s competition - and those guys on the whole have been getting their lunch eaten by passive funds.\n\nI could keep going but you clearly don\u2019t understand how any of these things interconnect.",

The right question is why can't we have one uniform impartial payment system for all international transactions. Instead we have a moronically slow and expensive but reliable wire system. On top of it we have fast and reliable credit card system that makes spending easy but you can't easily receive transactions as a private user. And we have the PayPal, that has mandatory consumer protections that encourage chargeback fraud making it unsuitable for any large scale business. \n\nAnd for some reason in every civilized country local wire transfers are nearly free and work well for any usecase. Why can't we have it globally?",

But it\u2019s also become a meme stock on wallstreetbets.\n\n\u201cHere's the deal. PLTR is a solid, growth company helmed by Peter Thiel (co-founder of PayPal) and also other billionaires. The company is not hurting for cash, but is still in its early years even though it was founded 15+ years ago. There is tremendous upside in government contracts, and other sectors.\n\nIMO, this stock will be $100+ in a couple of years, but it won't happen overnight. Still a 500% gain in 2-3 years beats the avg 8-10% annual gain of index funds or 2% for savings accounts.\n\nThis is a simple correction due to the recent run from $12 to $30 in a matter of weeks.\n\nNothing fundamentally changed with this business. \n\nHowever, \n\n1) you should ONLY invest money in the stock market that you won't need for any reason for the next 5+ years\n\n2) you should always expect 10-20% pullback in a new position and should have additional funds at your disposal to buy on dips to average down\n\n3) ONLY invest in stocks on which you did your own research and you fundamentally believe in the company's LONG TERM trajectory. This will help you weather short term pull backs and correction and you won't panic sell at the worst time\u201d",

Prints money with microtransactions preying on their undeveloped brains &amp; access to parents credit cards.\n\n-Airbnb is the wild card they are burning cash like uber/lyft but I wonder if hotels are fading away to an extent.

Plenty of services like Zelle exist for near-real-time payments and FedNow is on its way (equivalent already here in Europe). I can send money to friends with Venmo or GPay or PayPal or Chase Quickpay and those are way more user friendly than crypto and with zero fees.\n\nIf you can code, you can build stuff in centralized finance too. Hell, Stripe is pioneering some awesome stuff like [banking-as-a-service](https://stripe.com/treasury) that'll really change the industry. You'll impact far more people doing this.\n\nThe value in crypto comes from its trustlessness. There are massive positive ramifications to having a trustless, decentralized financial system. The benefits are not that it's more user-friendly. In fact, it will be far less user-friendly for a long time. And it's going to take a while to have a real decentralized financial ecosystem. But the foundation is being laid and we will get there someday.",

The right question is why can't we have one uniform impartial payment system for all international transactions. Instead we have a moronically slow and expensive but reliable wire system. On top of it we have fast and reliable credit card system that makes spending easy but you can't easily receive transactions as a private user. And we have the PayPal, that has mandatory consumer protections that encourage chargeback fraud making it unsuitable for any large scale business. \n\nAnd for some reason in every civilized country local wire transfers are nearly free and work well for any usecase.
