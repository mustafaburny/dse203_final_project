However if you remove that it really looks like this stock price is just ready to take off.\n\nAh, ok, you're one of those technical analysis guys who thinks you can get rich quick off of reading charts / relying on what you think other market participants are going to do (rather than company / industry risk and cashflow fundamentals.....)\n\nBut your argument is (a) buy KHC because it's at ATH (buy high / sell low, I guess...) and (b) it's going to go up further because there are two material holders that are fairly well known to the mainstream (The Oracle and that guy from the Margot Robbie movie that taught you everything you needed to know about finance)? \n\nNot a super sound investment thesis IMO, when you consider the above + the national ketchup shortage that's dominating all major media outlets right now.\n\n\n&gt;I see this article and it was the final piece of the puzzle for me. If we have another wave of covid,. KHC goes up. If everything opens up, KHC goes up. If stock market keeps ripping and roaring, KHC goes up. Market and economy crash, KHC goes way up.\n\nSo...first off, what article? Second of all, you're predicting KHC will continue to rise (which we've already established is at ATH) regardless of what the broader market does - so essentially a risk-free, perpetually appreciating asset, no matter what. \n\nGotcha - guess I better lever the fuck up on long dated ketchup futures in the meantime.",

It\u2019s database offerings, in addition, are essentially the only real alternatives to SQL Server. P/E is ~17. I bought that when they announced a dividend increase.\n\nI have some others I\u2019m less confident about. OI has a lot of debt that it seems to have managed (which in 2020 was not easy). LH and KT are both ones I have positions in. I think KT might turn into a long term play if it turns out to dominate the Korean market.",

In particular, the group chair of HSBC is considered the top position of that institution, outranking the chief executive, and is responsible for leading the board and representing the company in meetings with government figures. Before the creation of the group management board in 2006, HSBC's chair essentially held the duties of a chief executive at an equivalent institution, while HSBC's chief executive served as the deputy. After the 2006 reorganization, the management cadre ran the business, while the chairperson oversaw the controls of the business through compliance and audit and the direction of the business.",

Again, if you invest a third of what buffet did into stocks your return would be exactly the same and you still would have beaten the market just as much.\n\n&gt;Warren Buffet didn\u2019t get particularly \u201cfilthy stinking rich\u201d\n\nHe absolutely did though.\n\nhe had today's equivalent of 1.16 million at the age of 26 and had today's equivalent of 9.5 mil at 30. That's pretty filthy stinking rich at that age.\n\n&gt;I\u2019m fairly sure Buffet\u2019s shown that his way of valuing stocks is at the very least not quite as effective as it used to be, seeing as currently he struggles to beat the market, not the least because the sheer scale of tech has changed things. In addition, it\u2019s just a different market, as is somewhat laid out by this article: https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/22/why-warren-buffets-way-of-beating-the-market-will-not-be-repeated.html. Long story short the market of Buffet\u2019s time was less competitive and value investing was new: now everyone serious can define value investing and there\u2019s way more money involved and there\u2019s a much larger proportion of professionals.\n\nLargely due to his age and ironically yes his method. He completely avoided the tech sector for instance which really hurt him in the early 200's as he wasn't competent in that field. However it was his age moreso than methodology that caused that.",

Here's a fast bear case.\n\n2020 was an election year, and by all rights probably the biggest ad spend in history for online campaign money. The tailwind in earnings Facebook picked up from that cannot be understated. Assuming $10/share earnings is \"the low end\" for Facebook is the only way they end up at a 30 P/E, which is an implied 3% return, unless they grow significantly into the future.\n\nI'm not convinced their meteoric rise in earnings is going to continue the next decade. Myspace was thought to be unstoppable at it's time in the limelight too, until it got face-checked into the history books. Maybe it's different this time, but these sorts of companies has a fragile side cheerleaders don't like to see. When they get unpopular, or something better comes along, the exodus can be very hard and fast.\n\nFacebook has been surviving by buying out all challengers. If they can keep that up, great. Microsoft (sort of) did over the years, but they got hit with Antitrust all the same and some competitors found holes and ate their lunch too (Amazon Cloud, Oracle Database Lawyers (tm), Zoom, etc. etc.)\n\nA lot of professionals I know won't touch Facebook (or Twitter, etc) simply because it's a bad career move. One mistake, unpopular opinion, bad remark after one too many cocktails, etc. can sink a career. It's just not worthwhile.\n\nSome past monopolies (Bell/AT&amp;T, Standard Oil are good examples) pulled a Terminator and re-morphed after being split up, because they had oligarchic qualities where each of the \"babies\" could sort of carve up a region and not compete with each other seriously. They waited it out and eventually just merged back into an oligarchy.\n\nFacebook is the AT&amp;T model, minus the regulation. Every user adds additional value to the system. Maybe it can be chopped up and survive, but it seems far-fetched to me. That's a very real risk.\n\nAs much hate as Microsoft got in the 90's, I would argue the disdain for monopoly is much more pronounced and organized today.\n\nAs for timing, Facebook is trading at all-time highs. I'm not sure \"deeply undervalued\" has a strong case, unless you are banking on $30/share earnings in 5-10 years from now.",

BGFV is one of these for me (OI, KT, VIAC are a few others). It\u2019s probably got 10-15% upside in the next few months based on my research, and some probably have a bit of a longer period of upward momentum. But the plan is to sell once they hit a specific price (usually that margin is a minimum of 20% upside of the purchase). \n\nAny disciplined approach needs to have a goal for the specific position, aside from MPT (which is just garbage anyway) so long term holds need to be understood within the context of evaluating the investments future periodically. This is essentially the same thing someone who trades on price trends will tell you, it\u2019s just that they work on must shorter time frames.\n\nThere are certainly alternative strategies, but I suspect people like Cathie Wood who buy on future promises will be as forgotten as the investors of the past who ignored things profitability and debt.",
