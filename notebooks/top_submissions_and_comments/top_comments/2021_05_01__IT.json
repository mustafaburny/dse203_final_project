One of the biggest social media apps in the last 5 years is TikTok, which just is a super-powered Vine. Then they bought Periscope, which had a really interesting version of mobile-live streaming. They never figured out how to integrate that very well into their own platform and didn't know what to do with it, so they killed that too. TikTok also now has a live streaming feature that works exactly the same way.   \n\n\nNow Twitter has created Spaces as their new innovation, which is just a copycat of what the new social media website Clubhouse does, audio chatrooms.   \n\n\nJack Dorsey also owns Square and Cashapp and both of those services have expanded to meet the needs of consumers on multiple fronts to make themselves useful time and time again, but for some reason he always just views Twitter as this \"free speech haven\" and never leaned in creatively to expand it into a service that does more than blast someone's thoughts to everyone else. He could have had his own TikTok years before that app was invented.",
