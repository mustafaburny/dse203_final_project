It is eating away enterprise shares from Intel for datacenter and computing applications.  And we are only talking about its CPU architecture here. \n\nIt has an entire separate GPU division that is competing against Nvidia right now.  Hardware is not going anywhere, unless the world begins to adopt an entire new non-x86 architecture we will be seeing constant growth here.  There are still much of the world that hasn't been digitized yet.  I am longing AMD even after its insane gains for the past years.",

These things take time, initial adoption is always slow, but then there is usually the tipping point where things change drastically.\n\nIntel may be involved in deals to undercut their competition on pricing and they may also have long term contracts in place. However, they such things can't go on forever. As more and more companies are moving to the cloud, also cloud business from existing customers is growing by leaps and bound, there is more than enough room for both of them to grow. Along the way, AMD technology will prove it's worth and hopefully grab bigger of server market share.\n\nTo your VMWare point, I wasn't aware of it, and it sure is cause for concern. They are by far the largest market shareholder in server virtualisation space, especially for companies who have too much money to throw and are not worried about reducing costs. I will have to look into it further.\n\nI have been buying one AMD share for each $100 I make in a profitable trade. I have accumulating AMD shares this way for a while now.",

If you actually knew the history\u2019s of these two companies you wouldn\u2019t be drawing the conclusions that your drawing. Additionally although CPUs are are the core of Intels business. Intel has invested greatly in a multitude of areas and has a ton of valuable IP. So the fact that your sitting here saying that Intel doesn\u2019t have any IP advantage speaks to your lack of knowledge about the company.\n\nAt the end of the day the only thing AMD stepping means is that the consumers are gonna get a ton of bang for their buck over the next couple of years. Intel is going to be pushing hard to regain there position in the consumer market and AMD is going to be fighting hard to keep and continue to take more of Intels market share. This means both companies are going to be pushing hard to develop higher performance products while competing which each other in price. So again, this is a great time to be a consumer right now.",

That means, 7nm is not based 100% on 10nm as one may logically believe.\n\nBy the time 7nm development has to make technology choices, the new processes developed for 10nm are often not mature enough and too risky to use, so they would often choose the proven process from 14nm instead. That's why we often see process innovations jump a node. In this case it could be good as the mistakes that were made in 10nm would not be automatically ported to 7nm.\nSame thing at TSMC, their 7nm was gold, just like 16nm. 5nm will suck, just like 10nm. And so on, and so on.\n\nSo Intel still has a chance of coming out will a brilliant 7nm that will be the industry's first fully-fledged EUV node and taking everyone (here) by surprise.

Using old manufacturing technology makes the products they design less competitive which means less revenue and less money to invest into fab tech. They are in a downwards spiral exactly because their strategy is based on the \u201cold ideas\u201d and their organization is too stuck in the past to adapt to the future.\n\nI\u2019m sorry man your just super lost, Intel is not stuck on trying to keep with Moore\u2019s law. They saw the end game of this race long ago and have been adapting their business. Moore\u2019s law was predicted to die by 2025 long ago. They didn\u2019t hear this and just decide to ignore it knowing that they won\u2019t be able to maintain there advantage indefinitely. This is why they have pushed so hard into integration and other areas. \n\nAnd despite your uniformed opinion as we have been currently learning over the past two years these integration features matter a lot especially when it comes to industry. As we have seen with NVME drives and data transfer, having correctly  working integrated PCIE lanes can cause a variance in data transfer speeds that range from 20Mbs to 10Gbs. This is literally a gigantic deal.\n\n\nThis all be said, we seem to be going in circles, so thank you for the lively debate but this doesn\u2019t seem to be going anywhere.",
