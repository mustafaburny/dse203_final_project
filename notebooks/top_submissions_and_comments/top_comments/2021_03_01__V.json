He is pretty well-spoken, so if you are feeling uneasy or confused go ahead and give this analysis a listen.**\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzmWAlSpmZE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzmWAlSpmZE)\n\nRember guys -uh apes excuse me- this is not like the last time.\n\n1. **Look at the more gradual climb of the Stock, no really.** I know that may sound crazy, being up 1055 this week alone, but compared to last time it's a HUGGGGGGEEEE difference.\n2. **We are still up $10\\~ 7%, after a 107% drop today,** in comparison to last time you should be at least a little reaffirmed!\n3. **Look at the options call to put ratio,** it is still extremely bullish, and with the massive, I MEAN MASSIVE 300c volume expiring this week-- SHEESH!\n4. **Probably the most important, THIS IS NOT OUR FIRST TIME HERE????** I know you all know where this is going... We dropped like shit from ass cheeks and we bounced back, 1000s of shares were immediately bought? COME ON DO THEY KNOW WHO WE ARE, WHAT OUR COMMUNITY IS???\n\nTL:DR- Just watch the video apes, it is insightful and helps put things in perspective. And remember APE strong, we can do this, we will finish what we started.\n\nI am not a FA, We just like the stock man.",

        "body": "Inflation happens when the M2 expands (banks lending) and the money reaches the economy (M2 Velocity shows how easily money is exchanged between hands of business and consumers). I'm not sure I understand what the overturn of money means. However, when people pay down debt, money is destroyed in the process. The data has been showing people are paying down debt, which is likely why the M2 has remained relatively flat for the last few months.\n\nIf you have the time, I found this video to be super interesting and enlightening on the banks' role with the money supply. I also have a massive distaste for the central banks now.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkKwcXSbDK4&amp;ab_channel=SIMAY2K",

        "body": " \n\nHey apes,\n\n**I know today for some of us was still a +7% day, and for others, it was an \"uh oh I am freaking out\" kinda day.** So I have been looking in the Mega-Thread and I stumbled upon a comment about a GME analysis! **I watched a few of this guy's videos and I have to say I am impressed. He is pretty well-spoken, so if you are feeling uneasy or confused go ahead and give this analysis a listen.**\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzmWAlSpmZE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzmWAlSpmZE)\n\nRember guys -uh apes excuse me- this is not like the last time.\n\n1. **Look at the more gradual climb of the Stock, no really.** I know that may sound crazy, being up 1055 this week alone, but compared to last time it's a HUGGGGGGEEEE difference.\n2. **We are still up $10\\~ 7%, after a 107% drop today,** in comparison to last time you should be at least a little reaffirmed!\n3. **Look at the options call to put ratio,** it is still extremely bullish, and with the massive, I MEAN MASSIVE 300c volume expiring this week-- SHEESH!\n4. **Probably the most important, THIS IS NOT OUR FIRST TIME HERE????** I know you all know where this is going... We dropped like shit from ass cheeks and we bounced back, 1000s of shares were immediately bought? COME ON DO THEY KNOW WHO WE ARE, WHAT OUR COMMUNITY IS???\n\nTL:DR- Just watch the video apes, it is insightful and helps put things in perspective. And remember APE strong, we can do this, we will finish what we started.\n\nI am not a FA, We just like the stock man.",

WSB keeps deleting my post about liquidity black holes, but its happening, look at this fucking low volume, its fucking low!! look at two days within a week with V dips and immediate recovery, these are good signs. Long's are on the right side, and shorts are about to get the mother of all rockets.\n\nKey Take Away: DO NOT FEAR, expect the price to keep going down a bit, keep watching the volume, if this volume tanks this is good. The more frequent the V dips happen the worse the black hole is going to be= the bigger our rocket is going to get",

The concept is simple, someone sells shares they don't have, then they take that money out of the system (buys a lambo, 5th house).  Entities manipulate the system to kick the can down the road, and it is feared this could be a large percent of trades (between 7-35% according to the video).   \n\nWe have no idea how bad it is.

Look at what they\u2019re going after. Rocket mortgage, GME, even AMC/BB. These were all companies that were overshorted. The price was artificially held down by the high short percentage. They were undervalued in most cases because of that. Shorts got greedy, and got taught a lesson that they can no longer act with impunity. Now, clearly a lot of these have swung wildly to the upside, and will have to come down significantly to settle near fair value. But isn\u2019t this the sign of a market functioning the way it should? Clearly, this shit has unnerved the broader market, or parts of it anyway, for stretches that has made this v painful at times to watch. But GME was a penny stock for a while this past year, while it still had billions in cash flow and a new console cycle coming. As long as these stocks settle closer to fair value, I actually am beginning to think that the positives outweighs the negatives over the longer term. \n\nFlying taxi SPACs, well, that\u2019s a different story for a different time!!!",

Essentially, a virtual character is placed in a game with \u2018real\u2019 players for the purposes of visualizing the action of the game from the perspective of the virtual player.\u00a0The character\u2019s movements are triggered by a form of artificial intelligence designed to follow the most interesting and exciting action of each game. Since this technology\u2019s development, this spectator view has been employed by Super League in the live broadcast and spectating of competitive gameplay across multiple video game titles, including League of Legends, PUBG Mobile, Clash Royale, CS:GO, Street Fighter V, Minecraft and more. \"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nalright fuck it im in",

But did you notice something about the word moon?\n\nWe can also type as so\n\n`moon = Moon = M00N = M00IV`\n\nNow we are left with digits and roman numerals. Now lets dig deeper. We will assume charitable values for the roman numeral since it's the freaking moon. M is the thousands in roman numerals. But we can be more charitable, because we all know that 1000 is the bare minimum. So I believe it instead reads as: \n\n`IVI`\n\n`I &amp; V &amp; I`\n\nTherefore, instead of limiting ourselves to the mere 1 thousands place with `M` we assume that the first three digits are 1,5, and 1. Coincidental that it is the number of original pokemon? You tell me, but this thread looks like a bunch of primeapes here. 0, 0  is self explanatory, but for the who ate too many crayons...we are now at 1,5,1,0, and 0.
