He is pretty well-spoken, so if you are feeling uneasy or confused go ahead and give this analysis a listen.**\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzmWAlSpmZE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzmWAlSpmZE)\n\nRember guys -uh apes excuse me- this is not like the last time.\n\n1. **Look at the more gradual climb of the Stock, no really.** I know that may sound crazy, being up 1055 this week alone, but compared to last time it's a HUGGGGGGEEEE difference.\n2. **We are still up $10\\~ 7%, after a 107% drop today,** in comparison to last time you should be at least a little reaffirmed!\n3. **Look at the options call to put ratio,** it is still extremely bullish, and with the massive, I MEAN MASSIVE 300c volume expiring this week-- SHEESH!\n4. **Probably the most important, THIS IS NOT OUR FIRST TIME HERE????** I know you all know where this is going... We dropped like shit from ass cheeks and we bounced back, 1000s of shares were immediately bought? COME ON DO THEY KNOW WHO WE ARE, WHAT OUR COMMUNITY IS???\n\nTL:DR- Just watch the video apes, it is insightful and helps put things in perspective. And remember APE strong, we can do this, we will finish what we started.\n\nI am not a FA, We just like the stock man.",

I'm not sure I understand what the overturn of money means. However, when people pay down debt, money is destroyed in the process. The data has been showing people are paying down debt, which is likely why the M2 has remained relatively flat for the last few months.\n\nIf you have the time, I found this video to be super interesting and enlightening on the banks' role with the money supply.

He is pretty well-spoken, so if you are feeling uneasy or confused go ahead and give this analysis a listen.**\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzmWAlSpmZE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzmWAlSpmZE)\n\nRember guys -uh apes excuse me- this is not like the last time.\n\n1. **Look at the more gradual climb of the Stock, no really.** I know that may sound crazy, being up 1055 this week alone, but compared to last time it's a HUGGGGGGEEEE difference.\n2. **We are still up $10\\~ 7%, after a 107% drop today,** in comparison to last time you should be at least a little reaffirmed!\n3. **Look at the options call to put ratio,** it is still extremely bullish, and with the massive, I MEAN MASSIVE 300c volume expiring this week-- SHEESH!\n4. **Probably the most important, THIS IS NOT OUR FIRST TIME HERE????** I know you all know where this is going... We dropped like shit from ass cheeks and we bounced back, 1000s of shares were immediately bought? COME ON DO THEY KNOW WHO WE ARE, WHAT OUR COMMUNITY IS???\n\nTL:DR- Just watch the video apes, it is insightful and helps put things in perspective. And remember APE strong, we can do this, we will finish what we started.\n\nI am not a FA, We just like the stock man.",

WSB keeps deleting my post about liquidity black holes, but its happening, look at this fucking low volume, its fucking low!! look at two days within a week with V dips and immediate recovery, these are good signs. Long's are on the right side, and shorts are about to get the mother of all rockets.\n\nKey Take Away: DO NOT FEAR, expect the price to keep going down a bit, keep watching the volume, if this volume tanks this is good. The more frequent the V dips happen the worse the black hole is going to be= the bigger our rocket is going to get",

Entities manipulate the system to kick the can down the road, and it is feared this could be a large percent of trades (between 7-35% according to the video).   \n\nWe have no idea how bad it is.

Even if I don't think that crypto will take their economic lunch from them I think the larger trend in banking of consolidation will take their lunch in a more gradual way.

Any person can set up shop, accept crypto payment, and hand over the equivalent local currency.\n\nI say this with my investor hat on.
