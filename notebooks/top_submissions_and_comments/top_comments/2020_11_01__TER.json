And besides that's the smallest part of my portfolio right now (20%). TER is 0.6 , a little high but well can't learn if I don't try and make some mistakes. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn the ETFs that are not on the list, Degiro charges me 2\u20ac+0.03% per order, so I was trying to find ETFs that suited my needs on the free list first. Unfortunately the only EU Healthcare on the list is the Lyxor EU 600 that I was asking about on the other thread.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI might spend some time doing the math to see what is the best way to approach an EU healthcare ETF like the one you suggested taking into account my brokers fees.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you again for taking your time to do the write up",

        "body": "&gt;I was looking in https://www.justetf.com/de-en/find-etf.html?index=MSCI%2BWorld&amp;groupField=none&amp;sortField=ter&amp;sortOrder=asc comparing different products for the MSCI World index. I see that the one with the lowest TER is Lyxor (0.12%) and the iShares is one of the highest (0.50%).  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I see that a lot of people around me buy iShares. I assume that sometimes the broker does not offer Lyxor and so people would buy iShares, and probably the broker gets a kickback. But it appears that a lot of times the broker offers both and people sometimes go for iShares.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I was wondering if there is ever a good reason in the example above to go for the more expensive TER product (iShares) instead of Lyxor?\n\nCan you tell me what you consider a small amount? is 10K a small amount or large?",

        "body": "People were bashing Trul for : SSO, Unlocks... also saying \"they will lose market share\".\n\nI would argue that they keep on executing and dominating in Florida. Everyone expects them to lose market share but we see quite the opposite. 22% of dispensaries and 52%+ of flower and concentrates week in week out.\n\nIf anything, the competition should watch out in other states because they are the only company proven to be number one in sales per store in a state where where there are all the big names (Cura, Gtii, Harv, Medmen, LHS, Surterra...). What will happen when Trul (by surprise) decides to expand in a state where Cresco or Gtii or Cura are present ? They will replicate the winning formula there. I think the competition will lose market share (imo).\n\nGenerating the highest fcf is also a reason they continue to expand in the most profitable market. They will be able to use all that $ to fund expansions elsewhere with no/minimal dilution.\n\nAll this to say, Trulieve criticisms dont hold up for me personally.\n\nThey have opened 23 dispensaries this year alone (organically !!!) with Cura being number 2 with 11 and Gtii number 3 with 10. Can't wait for 2021 additional ~1m sq. ft of cultivation opening until Q12021. 2022 rec in Florida ? 130 million visitors a year also...\n\nP.S. I'm extremely bullish on all top 5 msos (Ter being my number 5). Just commenting my points on why Trul is my #1.",
