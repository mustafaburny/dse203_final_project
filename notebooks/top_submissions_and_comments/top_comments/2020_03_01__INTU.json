        "body": "So, here\u2019s a thought. One strategy that people use to defend a losing position is to sell the opposite, turning a put spread into an iron condor or an iron butterfly to mitigate the loss.\n\nLast Friday I sold a 277.50/275 put spread on INTU expiring this past Friday. My thought was that they would have good earnings because it\u2019s tax season and they\u2019re buying Credit Karma. Which they did, but I couldn\u2019t buy back the spread right away on Tuesday so I decided to let it expire. Unfortunately the stock went down with the rest of the market for the rest of the week.\n\nSo, what I did was I sold the 277.50/280 call spread to mitigate my loss. Instead of going max loss on the trade, I lost $77. I made $132 on the call side and was able to eventually buy back the put side on Friday morning when volatility was high, preventing max loss.\n\nInstead of doubling down on a losing trade by doing the same thing, I defended my position by taking the opposite trade. I didn\u2019t make a profit, but I didn\u2019t blow up my account, either.",

You and I both know that coronavirus went from being a relatively minor thing to a global pandemic very quickly.  This knowledge is priced into the cost of equities, because everybody knows that.\n\nWhile new developments occur every day and make pricesls go up or down, it's important to note that old information has already been priced in. That's kind of the whole point with markets, they are one of the most efficient mechanisms we know at turning information into prices.\n\nSo why did the markets go up today? Well, the news about covid19 isn't all that different today versus yesterday.  And maybe there's anticipation that government bailout packages will have a positive impact.  Or maybe panic selling has slowed and a large number of people are \"buying the dip\" driving the prices back up.\n\nRealistically, we've entered a bear market and there's a lot of uncertainty floating around that has yet to crystalize into information which would then be consumed by the market to produce pricing.  During this time, we can expect to see high volatility, which doesn't always mean declines. A million factors can cause things to yoyo, and no one has reliably been able to predict that kind of activity.\n\nAs always, stay the course and batten down the hatches.  Long term investments will recover.  And if they don't for the first time in history? Well the world as we know it will end and some clever market timing won't be nearly enough to have saved you.",

What you said is very good proof:\n\n\"I haven't even mentioned coronavirus and unemployment until now. I've stated previously we are on track to hit around at least 10,000 coronavirus cases by the end of this month. It's looking closer to now 20-30,000. Next month we are looking to at least 100,000 by the end of April. We might hit 1,000,000 by May or June.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nmost people would think this is shocking. But, actually, coronavirus cases will hit 100k by the end of March in the US, and if there's no kind of partial shutdown, it will progress to 10 million by the end of April. That's how fast the coronavirus spreads. So basically, there will be a lockdown of important sectors. Guaranteed. The US might be hit worse than Europe, I have not seen a country see 50% growth figures while they're already at so many cases, which indicates that they're still catching up with testing. New cases in the US yesterday were at the same level as new cases in Italy, indicating that total cases in the US are already at a similar level to Italy, if you'd use the same testing criteria (not sure which one tests less, to be honest). Globally, we're eyeing 1 million pretty soon. The virus is hitting Latin America and Asia. The realization that summer won't make the virus disappear is not completely priced in yet, I think. It will take some more growth in cases in Malaysia or a Latin American country before that gets priced in.\n\nOther investors have the same problem, they cannot fathom that shit is hitting the fan right now in the US, and if they can understand it, they cannot fully intuit what exponential growth actually means. The US is being overwhelmed by this virus, and immediate action is needed on a federal level.\n\nBasically, stocks are going to keep tumbling down for a while.",

About the best news, I've seen is the number of cases in China has slowed, at least if you believe them.\n\nSo, the things that triggered the correction have only gotten worse.

But you couldn\u2019t, you didn\u2019t, and now you\u2019re paying the price, you arthritic handed little shit. I will shit puts all over you and you will drown in it. You\u2019re fucking dead, kiddo",

Lack of PJ, improper venue, even SJ since it\u2019s all federal securities (though many states have their own securities regulatory bodies).\n\nNow, there are jurx that don\u2019t follow mandatory arbitration (LA, NC) so technically those RH users in these states could file and not necessarily get bumped out on the MtD phase. However, since this is mainly federal stuff, I still think most courts will defer to FINRA.\n\nThe main strategy would be to file in court and then immediately leverage settlement before the judge rules on dismissal. Settlement for each individual case would be low and so would be the bargaining power of the potential plaintiff. You\u2019d want to consolidate all actions into a class. The problem with this is it takes time and then you\u2019ll have fights over class cert. that can move the settlement needle back and forth.",

I'd wager that 4/5 of the posts that you're complaining about don't even see the light of day. Which should impress and terrify you.\n* It's difficult trying to strike a balance. The public attention has brought a lot of legitimate traders here who just want to share their experience, real DD, technical analysis, etc and we want to encourage that. They obviously make new accounts and we want them to contribute immediately.\n* We're tweaking things everyday in response to rapidly changing growth and news that swings the entire sub in a matter of hours (like our pumping problem last week). This weeked now everyone is talking about their local Costco, committing bioterroism, and killing the pope. Also, please calm the fuck down with killing the pope, guys. It's borderline enciting violence, I've temp banned a few people who take it wayyyy too far.\n* Our sexuality aside, we're volunteers from around the world. Our hours and availability differ, so there are mod lulls where a lot of one liner shitposts get through. We do our best, but we really focus on providing the best experience we can for you guys during trading hours when the engagement here is through the roof.\n* As far as you or others wanting to volunteer, you guys actually do a pretty good job en mass with downvoting and reporting bullshit. Keep it up. We appreciate that.\n\nThat's all I got at the moment. Hope it gives you some kind of something.",

        "body": "since no ones helped you out\n\noptions are contracts entered into by you and someone else (a counter party). There's 2 types of options, puts and calls. If you look at OP's picture you'll see that one of his \"trades\" is for SQQQ $29 CALL 3/20.\n\nSo he wants to buy a call. Now, like I said this call is a contract between OP and someone else. This contract states that at anytime between the day that OP purchases the call contract and the expiration date of the contract, stated as 3/20/2020. OP has the 'option' or choice to buy 100 shares of the etf SQQQ from the counter party of the contract for $29 regardless of what the actual price of the ETF is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo theoretically, if on 3/15 SQQQ is trading at $50 a share, OP can exercise his option and buy those 100 shares for $29 dollars from the counter party and sell those shares immediately in the open market for $50. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe downside is that OP has to pay the counter party a 'premium' in order to have this option. Right now the premium has a bid/ask of $2.65 x 2.95. So if OP wants to buy the call he has to pay $2.95 x 100 (per share, remember the call gives op the right to buy 100 shares from the counter party). Now, you may be asking, why is the spread so wide? Wouldn't OP immediately lose $30 or 10% on his trade? Is OP gambling with probably zero actual insight on investing? I'll let you figure those out on your own.",

Lack of PJ, improper venue, even SJ since it\u2019s all federal securities (though many states have their own securities regulatory bodies).\n\nNow, there are jurx that don\u2019t follow mandatory arbitration (LA, NC) so technically those RH users in these states could file and not necessarily get bumped out on the MtD phase. However, since this is mainly federal stuff, I still think most courts will defer to FINRA.\n\nThe main strategy would be to file in court and then immediately leverage settlement before the judge rules on dismissal. Settlement for each individual case would be low and so would be the bargaining power of the potential plaintiff. You\u2019d want to consolidate all actions into a class. The problem with this is it takes time and then you\u2019ll have fights over class cert. that can move the settlement needle back and forth.",

I was forced to hold over the weekend by 2 personal policies I established before all this craziness:\n* Don't use market orders\n* Don't make decisions in panic situations\n\nI tried to sell my SPY puts(SPXS calls) during the last 2 minutes of Friday market but the price kept falling below the limit price I set. Then I tried to find news of why the sudden SPY spike was happening. Couldn't find it and barely had 45 seconds to market close so I just gave up and said to myself: _\"Whatever, I'm going down with the ship\"_.\n\nIt's only now that my sinking ship is looking more like a space shuttle preparing for take off.",

I'd wager that 4/5 of the posts that you're complaining about don't even see the light of day. Which should impress and terrify you.\n* It's difficult trying to strike a balance. The public attention has brought a lot of legitimate traders here who just want to share their experience, real DD, technical analysis, etc and we want to encourage that. They obviously make new accounts and we want them to contribute immediately.\n* We're tweaking things everyday in response to rapidly changing growth and news that swings the entire sub in a matter of hours (like our pumping problem last week). This weeked now everyone is talking about their local Costco, committing bioterroism, and killing the pope. Also, please calm the fuck down with killing the pope, guys. It's borderline enciting violence, I've temp banned a few people who take it wayyyy too far.\n* Our sexuality aside, we're volunteers from around the world. Our hours and availability differ, so there are mod lulls where a lot of one liner shitposts get through. We do our best, but we really focus on providing the best experience we can for you guys during trading hours when the engagement here is through the roof.\n* As far as you or others wanting to volunteer, you guys actually do a pretty good job en mass with downvoting and reporting bullshit. Keep it up. We appreciate that.\n\nThat's all I got at the moment. Hope it gives you some kind of something.",

If you look at OP's picture you'll see that one of his \"trades\" is for SQQQ $29 CALL 3/20.\n\nSo he wants to buy a call. Now, like I said this call is a contract between OP and someone else. This contract states that at anytime between the day that OP purchases the call contract and the expiration date of the contract, stated as 3/20/2020. OP has the 'option' or choice to buy 100 shares of the etf SQQQ from the counter party of the contract for $29 regardless of what the actual price of the ETF is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo theoretically, if on 3/15 SQQQ is trading at $50 a share, OP can exercise his option and buy those 100 shares for $29 dollars from the counter party and sell those shares immediately in the open market for $50. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe downside is that OP has to pay the counter party a 'premium' in order to have this option. Right now the premium has a bid/ask of $2.65 x 2.95. So if OP wants to buy the call he has to pay $2.95 x 100 (per share, remember the call gives op the right to buy 100 shares from the counter party). Now, you may be asking, why is the spread so wide? Wouldn't OP immediately lose $30 or 10% on his trade? Is OP gambling with probably zero actual insight on investing? I'll let you figure those out on your own.",

        "body": "Zoom is my biggest position.\n\nThe security concerns are overdone which is why large enterprises like Walmart and Nasdaq and Autodesk and AB InBev continue to use them.\n\nIt's why listed company CEOs are coming out to publicly defend Zoom -- here are [Equinix](https://twitter.com/Equinix/status/1249146616247922689), [HubSpot](https://twitter.com/bhalligan/status/1248688101091872775), [PagerDuty](https://twitter.com/pagerduty/status/1248697090743644160), and [Five9](https://medium.com/@rowantrollope/beyond-the-noise-7-reasons-its-safe-to-run-zoom-9a2e639b13ec).\n\nIt's why when Zoom announced their [CISO Council and Advisory Board](https://blog.zoom.us/wordpress/2020/04/08/update-on-zoom-90-day-plan-to-bolster-key-privacy-and-security-initiatives/) last week, CISOs from VMware, Netflix, Uber, and Electronic Arts agreed to join the Advisory Board that personally advises Eric Yuan, Zoom's CEO.\n\nIt's why [Alex Stamos agreed to join as a consultant](https://medium.com/@alexstamos/working-on-security-and-safety-with-zoom-2f61f197cb34). Alex is Facebook's Chief Security Officer, [known for](https://9to5mac.com/2020/04/09/zoom-security-advisory-council/) disagreeing with Facebook's privacy policy, challenging the NSA on encryption backdoors, discovering vulnerabilities in MacOS, and being an expert witness in digital privacy matters for Google and the Electronic Frontier Foundation.\n\nOn China in particular, yes, as they were dealing with the growth from 10 million users to 200 million users of a couple months they did misconfigure some new Chinese servers so that some US users did use them when US servers were full. Normally China is geofenced so US users never use them. To understand the extent of this error, on the 1st of April there were 37 participants in the US that went through servers in China out of 233 million participants worldwide that day. All 5 US servers had to return no response for this to happen, so it was very rare, and it's now fixed.\n\nIn terms of customers dropping them, the vast majority of the ones you mention are companies that never implemented Zoom in a top-down way and are responding to employees using it. A company wanting employees to not use software that hasn't been vetted seems reasonable to me.\n\nI've spoken to a number of large multinational enterprise customers who use Zoom and they seem comfortable, think the press reports are overdone, and think Zoom's response has been good. That's one reason I'm comfortable being long.",
