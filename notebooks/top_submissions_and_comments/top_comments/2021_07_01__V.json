Direct competitor to Paysafe in all respects except we were more restrained on gambling.\n\nPaysafe make money, in large part, by charging merchants for a fee per card transaction. This is known as merchant acquiring. (Yes, the term \"acquiring\" is a little odd here, but keep following)\n\nThis fee is subject to many variables, including interchange fees charged to Paysafe by the card scheme (Visa/MC), as well as competition. Acquirers historically were subsidaries of banks - Chase Paymentech are examples of one that still is - JPM, in this case.\n\n As fees are usually taken before income is paid to the merchant (else invoiced payable within 30 days), it means bank-linked acquirers can significantly reduce their txn fee (and thus increase the topline) for merchants as an incentive they want to upsell more profitable products like loans to. I have worked in the industry and seen it time and again. One large international merchant even got free acquiring, they were that good a customer of the bank's other services. I even worked personally in combo with a bank on a deal of such a type.\n\nWhilst I appreciate that gambling companies are higher risk and some acquirers won't touch them...the barrier to entry is just the acquiring price and the willingness of a competitor to pant-drop. And they do.\n\nPlus I interviewed at Paysafe once. UK office, pre-Covid. There wasn't any buzz, any excitement. It seemes boring and uninspired. Granted, its a subsidary office.\n\nI hold no position on this stock and I am not planning to. Nor am I looking to shit all over the stock per se. Just cautious advice from personal experience.",

Don\u2019t hop into a trade unless you are guaranteed to win that trade. Cheap calls generally aren\u2019t worth it. You should also base your call on a lot more data. I only trade SPY gaps and LEAPS on some stocks. When SPY goes straight down vertically that money comes right back and it goes straight back up vertically within a few days. I buy an ITM call within a few days of the decline. 19/20 trades profited from that. \nFor LEAPS you have to understand Theta and time decay more, and go far far ITM which means the price of the call will be extremely expensive, but they are worth it in my opinion. I bought a $200 strike Visa call expiring in a year, when Visa was at $234 a share. it\u2019s now at $238 a share and the call is up 4% or so. the contract cost $4,000 but I lose a dollar (-0.01 x 100 shares) per day to time decay if the stock doesn\u2019t move, which is nothing. I gain $79-80 or so every dollar the stock moves up. I only discovered these methods after 2 years of losing in options, and now I\u2019m winning",

Once the access to low cost leverage is gone (loan paid off) simply buying quality REITs might provide a similar level of after expense income in the same sector (unless your client places a very low value on their time).  Granted income yields are low just about everywhere.                      \n\nAs an interest rate hedge it might be worth it in the longer term to hold if a sufficient amount of leverage is still held.  Yes a spike in rates might hurt the theoretical equity position but that should, in theory at least, balance against the inflated currency.                         \n\nAnyways, if your client is purely interested in income why not put together an alternative income proposal that matches their timeline and risk profile?  You sell at U, pay V taxes, invest in W, see X income, free up Y hours, and avoid risks Z.",

But compound growth is killer if the business continues to rapidly expand year over year. It would also make up more of the S&amp;P as well though to be fair, which favors index investing in terms of optimal risk-reward). \n\n2. OP was talking about the top 10 companies by market cap which is all big tech other than Johnson &amp; Johnson, and Berkshire Hathaway. They named Microsoft, Apple, and Visa off-hand. \n\n3. I Hate this crystal ball argument, of course the future is impossible to 100% predict. That\u2019s why you pick financially healthy companies with great growth prospects and economic moats. You invest in companies that give you the highest probability of outperforming the market. It\u2019s obvious a company like Microsoft is likely going to outperform a mid-cap company such as Texas Roadhouse. Just as how I can\u2019t guarantee I won\u2019t be alive tomorrow. But I have a higher chance of living if I pay attention while driving a car vs texting while driving. \n\n4. You don\u2019t just invest in one company. You invest in a handful of individual stocks that you expect to have a high probability of beating the market (Buffet and Lynch recommend 7-15 roughly). People should only do this if they know what they are doing. The average person should stick to indexes if they are not willing to do the research of course. \n\nI\u2019m not disagreeing with index investing as much as I want to highlight that beating the market isn\u2019t this absurdly, low probability phenomenon people want to believe that it is. OP has the right premise for a high probabilistic chance to beat the market.",

He thought there were only two things that can happen when trading \"spreads\" but he found out about a third. That third thing was the one that cost people big bucks. Now I know why the market often takes a down turn just before the close on Fridays.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uImgQWZofjA\n\nThe second thing I saw was him saying don't listen to the day trading hype on a certain web site. He said only 1% of option traders make money so don't listen to the B.S. Thank you for not bull shitting me, you are OK in my book. \n\nI then thought of playing online poker where only 12% make money because of the \"rake\". \nAt least the sites publish what they take from every pot so one knows what the odds are. 12% of poker players verses 1% of options traders making money is a big difference, though both are not good odds. In poker when you sit down at the table if you don't see the sucker you are it. This video is on his front page.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfMiRVQJuTj3NpZZP1tKShQ\n\nSo I watched a little of the first lesson but my enthusiasm has drained; maybe Vanguard won't approve my application to write necked puts so learning about them won't be necessary.
