        "body": "(Bloomberg) -- China\u2019s government quietly appointed a director to the board of ByteDance Ltd.\u2019s key domestic subsidiary several months ago, an unusual arrangement that offers Beijing even more sway and insight into the world\u2019s largest private technology company.\n\nThe video and news giant in April sold a 1% stake in Beijing ByteDance to three entities including one controlled by the country\u2019s internet overseer and gave the government a board seat, according to a person familiar with the matter. The entity, which owns licenses to operate the company\u2019s TikTok-like Douyin and news service Toutiao within the world\u2019s No. 2 economy, remains separate from ByteDance Ltd., the company\u2019s main fundraising vehicle through which it operates TikTok globally.\n\nChinese state organs have for years invested billions of dollars into high-profile startups from Didi Global Inc. to Jack Ma\u2019s Ant Group Co., but few if any manage to secure a seat at the highest decision-making table. The revelation about ByteDance, first reported by The Information, is likely to deepen investors\u2019 concerns about Beijing\u2019s attempts to wrest control of data from its giant technology industry, to both curb their influence and secure a valuable resource to power the economy and drive Xi Jinping\u2019s vision of common prosperity.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear what motivated the government\u2019s involvement at ByteDance earlier this year, but it coincides with Beijing\u2019s sweeping crackdown on private enterprises, particularly in the tech sector. Regulators have expressed concerns about data security and the tools that companies like ByteDance use to present content to users.\n\nBut the fact that the industry regulator can designate someone to the board of a prominent sector player may unsettle investors worried about the broader ramifications of Beijing\u2019s clampdown. Even before Xi\u2019s administration tightened its grip on the tech sector, ByteDance had grappled with American lawmakers\u2019 accusations that TikTok in particular threatens national security and could aid Beijing in espionage efforts. In May, the month after the Chinese regulator took its stake, founder Zhang Yiming relinquished day-to-day control of his company to its closest lieutenant, a decision regarded as an attempt to distance himself from the growing turbulence at home and abroad.\n\n\u201cIt intensifies worries about the government\u2019s intentions for China\u2019s internet sector and the concessions private firms may have to make,\u201d said Michael Norris at consultancy AgencyChina. \u201cIt gives new context to Zhang Yiming\u2019s decision to step down from his position as ByteDance\u2019s CEO.\n\n\u201dXi\u2019s crackdown on businesses from ride-hailing firms to fintech and edtech upstarts to the largest players in commerce has traumatized markets throughout much of 2021, wiping more than $1 trillion off Chinese stocks and igniting intense debate about the Communist Party\u2019s longer-term objectives for private enterprise.\n\nBeijing ByteDance Technology \u2014 a Chinese entity established in 2012 when Zhang started his now thriving internet apps empire -- sold a 1% stake in an April 30 deal to WangTouZhongWen (Beijing) Technology, which is owned by three state entities. According to Tianyancha, a widely referenced database of corporate records, the trio included the China Internet Investment Fund, controlled by the Cyberspace Administration of China; China Media Group, the Party-controlled national broadcaster, and the Beijing municipal government\u2019s investment arm.\n\nThat deal allowed the investing entity to appoint one of only three board members, named Wu Shugang in the database. Instead of selling a stake in the holding company that includes its overseas businesses such as TikTok, the firm negotiated to have the government invest in the Beijing entity, according to the person.\n\n\u201cThe Chinese subsidiary referenced only relates to some of ByteDance\u2019s China-market video and information platforms, and holds some of the licenses they require to operate under local law,\u201d a ByteDance spokesperson said in a statement.\n\nThe investment itself wasn\u2019t unusual. The China Internet Investment Fund, run by the same powerful watchdog that initiated a probe into Didi in the wake of its $4.4 billion initial public offering in New York, has taken stakes in a plethora of startups including ByteDance\u2019s chief rival Kuaishou; podcast giant Ximalaya; truck-hailing app Full Truck Alliance and AI leader Sensetime.\n\nBut it\u2019s highly unusual for the government to directly appoint a board member at a private tech firm. Beijing, worried that entrepreneurs like Ma and their expanding dominions would eventually undermine the influence of the Party, has moved since late last year to rein in the industry\u2019s biggest enterprises. Various government agencies have launched investigations into monopolistic behavior at a slew of firms including Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Wang Xing\u2019s Meituan, initiated deep data security reviews at Didi and Full Truck Alliance Co., pulled the plug on tech firms\u2019 IPOs abroad and even ordered vast swaths of the after-school tutoring industry to go non-profit.\n\n\u201cHaving a state-backed investor is still not sufficient to address regulatory challenges facing ByteDance\u2019s listing,\u201d said Feng Chucheng, a political analyst with consultancy Plenum in Beijing. \u201cWhat prevents the company from going public is not its corporate governance structure or source of funding, but the risk it could potentially impose on national security, due to the amount of data it accesses.\n\n\u201dThe unprecedented salvos have stoked concerns that Beijing is intent on exerting undue control over private enterprise, fomenting uncertainty that some say is making China Inc. un-investable.\u201cIt reignites debate in overseas markets as to whether TikTok could be a vehicle for state influence,\u201d Norris said.\n\nRIP BABA longs.",

        "body": "Because the banking system is ancient and outdated. Jim Bianco:\n\nLet me talk about the banks and let me not get p\\*** off while I do so.*\n\nIn 1871 Western Union invented the wire transfer and if you wanted to send $300 to somebody say in San Francisco it would cost you 3%. Back in 1871 they had to but the 300$ in a pouch, get on a horse and ride it to San Francisco. It cost you 3% to send money in 1871 and it took to two to four days.\n\nIn 2021 to do a wire transfer (not a bank transfer) it costs 3% and takes two days. Not one damn thing has changed in 150 years when it comes to the banking system. Nothing is changed when you look at remittances. There are over one billion migrant workers right down around the world. They are working in some of the worst conditions ever to make some money to send back to their families.\n\nThe average commission on a remittence is about 10 to 15%. They work one month a year to basically pay the bank and its 500 billion dollars a year that they are paying to the banks to send money to their families. We could give them a month of their life back or we can give their families 13 months of pay for 12 months of work by disrupting these terrible payment rail systems that we have right now. They are broken, they are highly regressive, they create inequality and they create a lot of problems.\n\nThat\u2019s why we have 1.7 billion people unbanked around the world and you have tens of millions of people underbanked in the United States as well. They had 150 to fix this system. The Federal Reserve has been running the payment rails of the United States for 107 years and it still takes two days to send money using their payment systems. Oh but don\u2019t worry, we got FedNow coming and we might get to real time payments by 2025. That is at least what their hope is at the moment. This is a terrible system that is slow, expensive and it falls right down on the poor.\n\nWhenever is say this, people are like, oh but I can use Venmo and I can send money in a second. Yeah, because you are rich and you have a bank account. You have enough money in the bank that they have already ripped your eyeballs out with fees so that they give you this free little app. But boy, you paid for that. You have paid for that in a big way before you get to that point.\n\nBut if you want to pay 30 bucks to Ryan, try going down to the bank you have no relation with and ask them to send it for you. You will be surprised what they charge you for and how long it will take. That is the problem with the banking system right now and a lot of the regulators are at the fault of it. They have been terribly slow to fix this system and reluctant to change this permissioned system.",

        "body": "Here's a great excerpt from Jim Bianco on Bankless:\n\n*Let me talk about the banks and let me not get pissed off while I do so.*\n\n*In 1871 Western Union invented the wire transfer and if you wanted to send $300 to somebody say in San Francisco it would cost you 3%. Back in 1871 they had to but the 300$ in a pouch, get on a horse and ride it to San Francisco. It cost you 3% to send money in 1871 and it took to two to four days.*\n\n*In 2021 to do a wire transfer (not a bank transfer) it costs 3% and takes two days. Not one damn thing has changed in 150 years when it comes to the banking system. Nothing is changed when you look at remittances. There are over one billion migrant workers right down around the world. They are working in some of the worst conditions ever to make some money to send back to their families.*\n\n*The average commission on a remittence is about 10 to 15%. They work one month a year to basically pay the bank and its 500 billion dollars a year that they are paying to the banks to send money to their families. We could give them a month of their life back or we can give their families 13 months of pay for 12 months of work by disrupting these terrible payment rail systems that we have right now. They are broken, they are highly regressive, they create inequality and they create a lot of problems.*\n\n*That\u2019s why we have 1.7 billion people unbanked around the world and you have tens of millions of people underbanked in the United States as well. They had 150 years to fix this system. The Federal Reserve has been running the payment rails of the United States for 107 years and it still takes two days to send money using their payment systems. Oh but don\u2019t worry, we got FedNow coming and we might get to real time payments by 2025. That is at least what their hope is at the moment. This is a terrible system that is slow, expensive and it falls right down on the poor.*\n\n*Whenever is say this, people are like, oh but I can use Venmo and I can send money in a second. Yeah, because you are rich and you have a bank account. You have enough money in the bank that they have already ripped your eyeballs out with fees so that they give you this free little app. But boy, you paid for that. You have paid for that in a big way before you get to that point.*\n\n*But if you want to pay 30 bucks to Ryan, try going down to the bank you have no relation with and ask them to send it for you. You will be surprised what they charge you for and how long it will take. That is the problem with the banking system right now and a lot of the regulators are at the fault of it. They have been terribly slow to fix this system and reluctant to change this permissioned system.*",

If youre buying weekly options then yeah, youre playing with fire holding options through earnings. But if you have options contracts that has a lot of time left after the earnings call then you have time to recover. If your options contracts has months left until expiration then holding through earnings is not going to hurt you too bad. I bought calls on AMD at the end of June and they were down 50-80% leading up to earnings. I have been slowly (maybe prematurely) selling my calls all for profits of 150-300%. My calls expired in September, November, and December. I like to stagger mine. \n\nWith that being said, I think people grossly missunderstood the position AMD is in. The signs were all there. Technically AMD was finishing up making a cup-and-handle formation. Say what you want about charts but they are a great indication of market sentiment and direction. \n\nFundamentally, AMD has been stealing market share quite aggressively from Intel. Intel's last earnings call was a huge sign. Literally every semi-company is reporting great numbers except Intel. Intel's last earnings call was not very positive. AMD's revenue has been growing rapidly over the last year. On top of the company actually hitting on all cylinders, the semiconductor industry as a whole is rapidly growing. Demand is severely outstripping supply. Then you have another positive catalyst with the potential of the Xilinx purchase. Frankly, I see no reason why China will approve it, but I have been wrong in the past. \n\nEven after earning, with the astronomical increase in volume when AMD broke the $96 price point. That was a huge buy signal since it was the completion of the cup-and-handle pattern. If you would have loaded up on September calls after earning after the huge first day run up, you would be sitting nicely.",

The merger is currently being approved by regulators in Europe and China and my guess is that China fears have created this arbitrage situation. If the merger fell through - which is seems unlikely to do in my opinion - people generally think XLNX will fall from its current $140 to around $100. No idea what the AMD stock would do - I'm just parroting what I've read elsewhere.\n\nSo - as of right now AMD is around $120 and XLNX is around $140. If price according to the merger terms, XLNX should be trading at $206 to equal 1.72 shares of AMD ($120 x 1.72 = $206). I'm currently selling my AMD and buying XLNX under the belief that the merger will go through. As the merger date approaches (later 2021, early 2022) the arbitrage opportunity will disappear and the prices of the two stocks will follow that 1.72:1 ratio that I mentioned earlier. There is risk but I have not seen anything in the news to suggest the merger won't occur, so I am comfortable converting my shares now to take advantage of that \\~30% differential ($140 vs $206). The downside is probably around a 30% loss ($140 to $100) if the merger fails, but again, I'm long AMD and would LOVE an opportunity for a discount on the share price via arbitrage.",

I\u2019m not sure what the threshold is for review, but they do substantial business and have operations in the country - and they sell their products there \n\nSo that gives China authority to block it\n\nThey may want to block it to prevent foreign chipmakers from becoming stronger. Ever since the trade war with the IS started both countries have blocked acquisitions.\n\nDoesn\u2019t mean it will happen in this case but the threat is higher than it would normally be - especially since China is cracking down on companies generally",

This is fixed.\n\nSo theoretically the more that AMD converges on a 1:1 ratio with XLNX, the more discounted the XLNX shares are before the merger.\n\nHowever, as of today, the ratio is now 1.34 after AMD dropped today and XLNX gained. So you risk it if say by the time the merger closes and you're holding all XLNX and no AMD, and XLNX is 2.0x more than AMD, you would lose money on the merger and the conversion of XLNX to AMD.",

FPGAs do lots of different thing (they can and will be used in servers but they are so much more). And they bring a deep software engineering bench that AMD has often lacked over the years, so the tie up ought to work out well along several lines. \n\n&gt; now that TSMC is being used by Intel, Apple, AMD, and anyone who needs 5nm, it may be difficult to keep up with demand until the new TSMC fabs come online\n\nApple will always get first crack at the new stuff because they essentially pay TSMC a premium for it and subsidize its R&amp;D for the newest nodes. Intel has announced a need to turn to TSMC for fabrication of at least some of its leading edge chips, due to its own technical problems. \n\nHowever, between AMD and Intel, AMD will be given preference. The reason is simple. Intel has declared open warfare on TSMC with the announcement of its \u201cIDM 2.0\u201d initiative, which aims to open Intel\u2019s fabrication facilities to third parties \u2014 essentially, they want to take a chunk of TSMC\u2019s foundry business. As a result, while TSMC will supply Intel to a reasonable extent, they will almost certainly give AMD preference over Intel, as a way to check Intel\u2019s ambitions. \n\nIn other words, TSMC says if you want to cut into our core business (foundry), we will enable AMD to cut into your core business (x86 server and laptop CPUs) by making sure they have whatever they need on the fabrication side of things.",
