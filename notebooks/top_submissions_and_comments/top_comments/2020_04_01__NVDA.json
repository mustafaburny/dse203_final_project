Now nVidia are very well positioned to take advantage of this but there is no guarantee they will be the only players in this field, in fact I expect the software guys to come and steal their lunch because: \n\n1) Game publishers are rich as fuck and have all the money necessary to create this AI hardware divisions\n2) Epic Games who own Unreal Engine are 49% owned by Tencent and China has been ramping up their own silicon lately, and I can guarantee they will not miss this chance of controlling PC gaming hardware\n\nBasically nVidia's pie will continue to dwindle on the PC gaming and their growth on emergent markets will also be capped pretty soon.\n\nThanks for coming to my Ted Talk",

There was no way to predict it, so the real smart decision learned would've been to just spread out a bit, and split my cash into both, so if one does particular well, I can at least average and balance with the other.

Look back over time at how the stonk tends to trade around VWAP and the upper/lower bands.\n\nMost of the time, you should see that the stock will want to \"float\" back to VWAP throughout the day-sometimes it doesn't, but it's better than just trying to trace a chart with your finger on robinhood and guestimate purely off price and not volume.\n\nCombine this with time and sales flow to get an idea as to the momentum.  It's something you need to just play with and get a feel for.\n\nMy approach is basically - has the stock plunged well below VWAP, and pierced the lower bound?  I probably wouldn't go short but will consider going long to catch a bounce back to VWAP.  Inverse?  Consider going the other way.  Sitting at VWAP and VWAP is flat?  Probably won't touch it as I'm not an oracle  \n\n\nIt's not a silver bullet though and won't always work - I've seen SPY explode over VWAP and just keep reaching upwards, beyond the upper band.

Since the S&amp;P 500 is a broad representation of the market, where the FAANGs make up about 15% of the S&amp;P 500\u2014a staggering figure considering the S&amp;P 500 is generally viewed as a proxy for the United States economy as a whole,  you have basically just invested in the market as a whole, as stated by /u/Chuckox50.\n\nNot to mention that investing in Berkshire ($BRK.A) is like investing in an index fund of sorts, where Berkshire's \"fund\" also owns positions in Apple (33.9%), Amazon (0.57%), and Johnson &amp; Johnson (0.24%), adding to your positions in those three companies. Additionally, Berkshire owns relatively small positions in the SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust ([$SPY](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/SPY:US)) and VANGUARD IX FUN/S&amp;P 500 ETF SHS NEW ([$VOO](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/VOO:US)) ETFs, which both track the S&amp;P 500 and in turn have positions in some of the companies you have mentioned: Microsoft ($MSFT), Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Berkshire, Johnson &amp; Johnson, and Alphabet.\n\n**That being said, I still think that they are rock-solid choices and I have several of those on my radar and just as many already in my portfolio, and I intend to add to my positions for those companies.**\n\nI am investing for the long-term and currently have a high tolerance for risk, so the majority of the stocks on my lengthy list of about 55 companies on my radar right now are tech.\n\nJust to mention a bunch of them (on top of MSFT, AAPL, GOOG, NFLX, FB, and AMZN):\n\n* Financial: Visa, Mastercard, PayPal, Square\n* Healthcare: JNJ, UnitedHealth, AbbVie, Illumina, InVitae\n* Services: AMZN, Walmart, Disney, Spotfiy\n* Technology (Software): Oracle, Adobe, Salesforce, Shopify, Splunk, Docusign, Twiliio, The Trade Desk\n* Technology (Gaming): Activision Blizzard, Take-Two\n* Technology (Semiconductors): Intel, NVIDIA, AMD, Micron, Teradyne\n* Telecom/Communications: Verizon, AT&amp;T, Cisco\n\nI would like to caution you for your analysis in the write-up in regards to Berkshire. You state that your rationale for Berkshire having a competitive edge post-COVID-19 is simply \"Warren Buffett\". By the time that COVID is on the decline, Buffett will be 90 years old. I think the company can thrive without him, but if your basis for investing in that company for the long-term is a man born in 1930, I think you need to reassess your rationale.",

Similar as it is in the world of investing in mutual funds/ETFs in a 401k/IRA (diversify and avoid pricey managed load-fee funds) there is such a thing as diversifying in options trades (not all-in on SPY or SPY and QQQ, place only small % on a position, include a contrarian position, don't overpay, always keep sufficient \"dry powder\"/cash equity that allows for repositioning in trades you believe in but market moved against in near term, have plan when to enter/exit before making a trade, don't get emotional, cut losses sooner rather than later, etc).  \n\nYou know you're in trouble if this applies:  \n\n\\--&gt; If you catch yourself using the word \u201chope\u201d.

The reason he got such a huge following was because his earliest posts seem to do just that and as time moved forward it became clear to everyone that no one can predict and not even the most detailed thorough TA can give away clues for what will happen a week+ down the road.  \n\nHave a fun ride on this rollercoaster of a market!

I forgot exactly what his lifetime income would have been....like half a million a year.  He declined and so he lost about $70 mm when the stock tanked.   They moved the hdqtrs to Colorado from Silicon Valley and somehow clawed their way back to profitability and a high stock price.  The second time I met with the client we recommended a $5 mm CRT again to lock in some diversification and life time income as well as generate some tax deduction so he could sell some of his low basis company stock.  Again he declined.  The second time he lost nearly all of what was that time about $60 mm of stock.  Brilliant people don't always make the best decisions.",

You just need a basic understanding of how to read Financial Statement and you can see that.\n\n#2 I don't see current Oil Prices staying where they are at long term because this is artificially induced by two countries where this current price is not feasible for either of them long term. \n\n#3 In order to make large returns in Markets, you have to take risk. There is no other way around it. There is always a risk factor when investing in the Stock Market. \n\nLastly, Oil is not going to go anywhere in the future as far as I am aware. It still makes up a large part of our daily lives and is still a large part of our Economy whether you like it or not. \n\nSide note to OP: Although one may have only earned a 3% yield during 2009 you have to remember that most of investors that earned that were most likely the large institutional investors whose Investment Mandate are limited to just Companies that pay out Dividends. There are individuals that invest solely on dividend yield and not Capital Appreciation.",

Look back over time at how the stonk tends to trade around VWAP and the upper/lower bands.\n\nMost of the time, you should see that the stock will want to \"float\" back to VWAP throughout the day-sometimes it doesn't, but it's better than just trying to trace a chart with your finger on robinhood and guestimate purely off price and not volume.\n\nCombine this with time and sales flow to get an idea as to the momentum.  It's something you need to just play with and get a feel for.\n\nMy approach is basically - has the stock plunged well below VWAP, and pierced the lower bound?  I probably wouldn't go short but will consider going long to catch a bounce back to VWAP.  Inverse?  Consider going the other way.  Sitting at VWAP and VWAP is flat?  Probably won't touch it as I'm not an oracle  \n\n\nIt's not a silver bullet though and won't always work - I've seen SPY explode over VWAP and just keep reaching upwards, beyond the upper band.

Since the S&amp;P 500 is a broad representation of the market, where the FAANGs make up about 15% of the S&amp;P 500\u2014a staggering figure considering the S&amp;P 500 is generally viewed as a proxy for the United States economy as a whole,  you have basically just invested in the market as a whole, as stated by /u/Chuckox50.\n\nNot to mention that investing in Berkshire ($BRK.A) is like investing in an index fund of sorts, where Berkshire's \"fund\" also owns positions in Apple (33.9%), Amazon (0.57%), and Johnson &amp; Johnson (0.24%), adding to your positions in those three companies. Additionally, Berkshire owns relatively small positions in the SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust ([$SPY](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/SPY:US)) and VANGUARD IX FUN/S&amp;P 500 ETF SHS NEW ([$VOO](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/VOO:US)) ETFs, which both track the S&amp;P 500 and in turn have positions in some of the companies you have mentioned: Microsoft ($MSFT), Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Berkshire, Johnson &amp; Johnson, and Alphabet.\n\n**That being said, I still think that they are rock-solid choices and I have several of those on my radar and just as many already in my portfolio, and I intend to add to my positions for those companies.**\n\nI am investing for the long-term and currently have a high tolerance for risk, so the majority of the stocks on my lengthy list of about 55 companies on my radar right now are tech.\n\nJust to mention a bunch of them (on top of MSFT, AAPL, GOOG, NFLX, FB, and AMZN):\n\n* Financial: Visa, Mastercard, PayPal, Square\n* Healthcare: JNJ, UnitedHealth, AbbVie, Illumina, InVitae\n* Services: AMZN, Walmart, Disney, Spotfiy\n* Technology (Software): Oracle, Adobe, Salesforce, Shopify, Splunk, Docusign, Twiliio, The Trade Desk\n* Technology (Gaming): Activision Blizzard, Take-Two\n* Technology (Semiconductors): Intel, NVIDIA, AMD, Micron, Teradyne\n* Telecom/Communications: Verizon, AT&amp;T, Cisco\n\nI would like to caution you for your analysis in the write-up in regards to Berkshire. You state that your rationale for Berkshire having a competitive edge post-COVID-19 is simply \"Warren Buffett\". By the time that COVID is on the decline, Buffett will be 90 years old. I think the company can thrive without him, but if your basis for investing in that company for the long-term is a man born in 1930, I think you need to reassess your rationale.",

The only top of the mind thoughts I had are:\n\nGo with individual stocks if you enjoy stock picking, you can index in your 401k and ESOP.\n-drop oracle from the list\n- add AYX and possibly ANET to your tech list, everything else on there looks great.\n- I like higher growth names in healthcare as well, LVGO, GH, HQY come to mind as all long term plays (I also own Illumina, watching NVTA but don\u2019t love it)\n- PINS and SFIX seem to have a lot of upside from current levels as well, (SFIX popped pop my radar due to incredible amounts of insider buying). \n\nHope this gives you some decent ideas, either approach seems well thought out and would work fine.  I guess it depends on how much time you want to dedicate to it and how much you enjoy stock picking.",

Similar as it is in the world of investing in mutual funds/ETFs in a 401k/IRA (diversify and avoid pricey managed load-fee funds) there is such a thing as diversifying in options trades (not all-in on SPY or SPY and QQQ, place only small % on a position, include a contrarian position, don't overpay, always keep sufficient \"dry powder\"/cash equity that allows for repositioning in trades you believe in but market moved against in near term, have plan when to enter/exit before making a trade, don't get emotional, cut losses sooner rather than later, etc).  \n\nYou know you're in trouble if this applies:  \n\n\\--&gt; If you catch yourself using the word \u201chope\u201d.

Right before the first discovery of the books being cooked we had recommended he take $10 mm of his company stock and do a Charitable Remainder Trust.  I forgot exactly what his lifetime income would have been....like half a million a year.  He declined and so he lost about $70 mm when the stock tanked.   They moved the hdqtrs to Colorado from Silicon Valley and somehow clawed their way back to profitability and a high stock price.  The second time I met with the client we recommended a $5 mm CRT again to lock in some diversification and life time income as well as generate some tax deduction so he could sell some of his low basis company stock.  Again he declined.  The second time he lost nearly all of what was that time about $60 mm of stock.  Brilliant people don't always make the best decisions.",

This requires a bit of technical knowledge to understand, but this network works in conjunction with other types of DLTs. It solves the biggest problem of smart contract technology. Essentially it lets DLT applications make API calls to external systems (the web). I'm most bullish on this by far.\n\nIOTA: an outlier, a potential game changer. A more exploratory type of network that uses DAG tech which could ultimately be the fastest and cheapest per transaction.

To answer your question, i dont know, but he did say he bought too early in 2008. Also, a lot of his business probably badly hard and may need his cash injection.",

        "body": "U/Spuri0n have you taken a look at the competitors? IBM (Kenexa), Oracle, Citrix, and SAP released their 2019 annual reports. Some of them released their Q1 earnings, too.\n\nOracle and IBM earn 70-80% of their revenue from their cloud based services and software. SAP and Citrix (Web-Ex) is more weighted in this area. Growth has been trailing for all of these companies, except for one: Citrix.\n\nMy favorite out of all of them, including Cornerstone, has to be Citrix. Unfortunately, that Citrix ship has sailed. It had a damn check mark recovery! Citrix seems like a safe bet to go long, but this LMS industry seems like a short term play for me. \n\nI'd stick with CSDO for the earnings play with a small position of $32.5 5/15 calls. I would prefer going out to June, but there is no volume.\n\nI think I'll wait and see how Citrix behaves to decide if I want to jump in long term.",

Grocery retailers, biotech. \n\nI\u2019m not sure if you are thinking big enough. Maybe you think every restaurant, airline, and consumer discretionary is struggling and NFLX will benefit. Here let me rattle of a list of large companies for you and you can check out there peers that are in the industry. \n\nOff the dome:\n\nKHC, ORCL, NFLX, INTC, AMD, CAG, STZ, ZM, ATVI, CLX, KR, NVDA, PEP, KO, COST, GILAD, SPOT, CHWY, AMZN, MSFT, CISCO, RNG, SPOT, EVERYBIOTECHINDUSTRY, EVERYECOMMERCESERVICE, EVERYINTERNETSECURITY, EVERYSTREAMINGSERVICE, EVERYCLOUDBASED\n\nThose are just some tickers, there are probably thousands more tickets that all BENEFIT or remain very largely unaffected from the Coronavirus. As a majority I\u2019m certain that most businesses will service. \n\nI know since I\u2019ve been unemployed I\u2019ve subscribed to three online subscriptions and have bought at least a half dozen books. \n\nDid anyone use Zoom before Coronavirus? \n\nSo, depends how you define a lot, I suppose.
