        "body": "Yea that's a good question (tldr at end).  For some stocks it can be like 5+ years.  For sure, Tesla won't realize it's fundamentals until like 5+ years, and even then, it can pull a MSFT in which it goes from a blue chip to a blue chip + growth stock (with Azure), in which case, it still may not fully realize that part of it's fundamentals until we know how big cloud will be.\n\nBut when I invest, my target is always like 2+ years for all my stocks and for the stock market as a whole.  That's why I've always been buying this entire time, since even though we can definitely sell off short term back to say 240, I know long term, the stock market will be better than 280.  More importantly, I am confident the individual stocks I pick will be better than what they are currently longer term.  That's why a DCA approach is a fairly standard and safe approach.  Of course, you can adjust this DCA approach to be way more aggressive on drops and less aggressive on up moves (like buy way less on a day like today, if today was your set buying date).  I don't worry about the market going down short term for my long term investments.  Plus, if you look, so many tech stocks, like MSFT, AMZN, NVDA, NFLX, etc. are all up for the year despite this!\n\nNow, for trading, you can also trade the fundamentals in the short term - which would be months here.  If you believe the economy will be slower to return to work, if the Q1 and Q2 earnings will be bad, if the vaccine will take longer than normal, if social distincing in a way still continues even after we open up, if consumer demand is less, if the credit problem comes back, etc., or some combination of that, you can trade that.  So for example, you can buy like a 3 month 15% OTM put or something.  Perhaps you believe QQQ &gt; IWM (that's what I believe), so in that case, maybe if you are long QQQ, you can short IWM as a market hedge.  So many ways to trade that.\n\ntldr: \n\nTrading should be on either short term TECHNIALS (days - weeks) or short term FUNDAMENTALS (which will be months)\n\nInvesting should be on long term FUNDAMENTALS (which will be years).  I'm a believer in the US Economy and particularly the tech sector and a few non-tech stocks like COST, so I will always invest when I have the chance to do so, without having to always try to predict the bottom.  Predicting the bottom or the top is best used in the above trading section.",

        "body": "Jesus H Christ. There is so much conspiracy theory in here that it would be impossible to maintain if this was even remotely true. The fact of markets is that its driven by 80% financial institutions who are not barred from holding short positions. The market is irrational in the short term, but its never irrational long term. \n\nTake a look at the VIX, its at 42. This implies that SPY can move 12% up or down as driven by premium prices. This means that the underwriters of options (the guys you buy options from) are pricing in this movement. Now lets look at SPY's movement the last 2 weeks, gee what do you know? its moved up 12% well within the expected volatility of the market. \n\nThis means that the SPY index can swing up or down 12% within this month, and it will mean absolutely NOTHING. It would be considered random noise.\n\nNow during the last 2 weeks we've had 2 uncertainties become certain.\n\n1. PPP was activated and disbursed\n2. Fed commited to buying Equity based securities\n\nThese were the 2 big driving factors of the gains.\n\nNow if you scrutinized the winners and losers of the last 2 weeks of gains, you can notice a theme. Companies like MSFT/AMD/NVDA/Netflix are rewarded. Can you think of a rational reason why that is? Compared to say BA? This is proof the market is evaluating companies rationally corp to corp.\n\nNext, I want all the bears to understand that in the history of 100 years of equity movement, the stocks only moved down 4% of the time ( vs 96% of the time up) and in addition, bear markets only lasted 200 days on average. With the way algos reacted and the fed, you can expect this bear market to be compressed at LEAST by a factor of 2. Lets say 100 days. Now we've had market reaction for over 60 days now. this means, we are likely already halfway through this market correction statistically.\n\nKnowing the above quantifications, how many are actually brave enough to continue to short? It makes no sense logically given the above.",

And this is all only in the cpu side of the house. \n&gt;\n\nThe gpu side, they are far far behind Nvidia, so really there is only upside there.  I don't really think they can get worse here. They have not had a top of the line competitor in several years, so they really need a Zen like comeback in the gpu segment.  They have competitive mid level gpu products but they are unable to win any  mind share over Nvidia with the lack of top end competitiveness.",

        "body": "No although you\u2019re very invested in technology\nWhich isn\u2019t a bad thing.  \n- AAPL is great, their market value will always go back to what it was even if they don\u2019t release the new iPhone. Don\u2019t be afraid of a drop just average costs if it drops dramatically. \n\n- Adobe should do well with this stay at home. School is requiring the use as well as businesses from home. \n\n- Amazon is essentially showing its untouchable currently. I\u2019m large into amazon as well. \n\n- Disney is another powerhouse that you\u2019ll never need to worry about. The lost revenues over the following 8 months could cause a dramatic drop, in this scenario don\u2019t panic and average your cost. \n\n- Enph - energy, I\u2019m not familiar with this company. \n\n- Facebook is another powerhouse good pick. \n\n- Google - Great pick. \n\n- MasterCard is also a good pick, hold this. Average if it comes down to although you shouldn\u2019t have to they trade rather high. If you\u2019re at a major loss with their recent decline. Average in the next 3 months when there\u2019s a better understanding how financials will deal with crisis. (You shouldn\u2019t need to) \n\n- Microsoft - I love microsoft. They are on a tear currently. Teams daily usage is up 12 million users in the last month, this is major. Their competition is \u201cwork\u201d slack technologies who I am also Long. \n\n- Netflix has been great good pick. \n\n- Nike is a great pick. I could expand but they\u2019ve always done well. Constant increase throughout the life of their stock. \n\n- Nvidia is a powerhouse as well. Great pick. \n\n- Starbucks is great. I haven\u2019t followed them through the virus but they\u2019re a strong company large capital, their profits are also great. Good pick. \n\n- Square I like square a lot. Square has major potential in different avenues. Cash app, lending (they just got approved to lend during this time). Prior to the virus square was on a tear. I\u2019m long on this I got in early and am very big on square. \n\nIf you\u2019re interested in diversification:\n\nAll that being said you really are big into tech, I would suggest diversification. \n\n\u201cOxy\u201d - occidental petroleum is a good long term stock. They\u2019re trading extremely low currently due to oil wars, corona virus, issues on the board and the purchase of anadarko. (This scares a lot of investors but you seem to want long term investments) it\u2019s a steal at 15$ a share. \n\n- Johnson and Johnson is a powerhouse. \n\n- Jet blue &amp; Delta - long term great investments. Short term extremely risky. \n\n- Walmart: trading high but they\u2019re only going to go even higher when this is over. \n\n- AT&amp;T and Verizon: AT&amp;T trades fairly low with a large dividend. GREAT LONG TERM. Verizon has been extremely strong throughout the years.  \n\n- Ford on the long term has a lot of upside trading around half of its average price. Ford pays dividend and  history has proven America will never let ford fail. \n\n- USO is an ETF that tracks United States Oil, It\u2019s trading extremely low, no reason not to diversify with this. ( The oil war between Saudi and Russia is coming to an end, this should do well in the long term) \n\n- Have you put any though into mutual funds to also diversify ? A good managed funds typically has large returns and low risk. \n\nReach out to me if you\u2019d like.",

Although the entire industry is getting raped and most of them are not getting any government bailout, still Carnival owns almost 50% of the market and financially the most stable one. Now, plenty of other similar companies will go out of business this year or next and if Carnival manages to pull this through they have the opportunity to increase their market share way above 50%. \n\nThis is a long play and not without risks and I don't like cruises so will not go for it.\n\nOther than this I believe technology stocks which provide cloud services or the infrastructure/hardware to it will remain in high demand (Amazon, Microsoft, Nvidia, Google) or companies with loyal and huge fan base (Apple) are safe bet. I also like Applied Materials, basically they're providers to semiconductor manufacturers equipment and technology wise. \n\nI'm personally also looking at Visa, Mastercard and Paypal as they still have plenty of growth potential as I see still many developed countries are relying on payment with cash.",
