By the time they are resolved, Intel will capitalize on laptop and server processors with Alder Lake using its own capacity.\n\n\\- Xilinx merger may get cockblocked or delayed by China, as well as force AMD to make costly concessions.\n\nOn the other hand, we can draw a few astrological lines and prey.",

Idk exactly what the catalyst was at that time, but I imagine the WSB hype added to the push (+good Q2). The stocks have been moving very similarly apart from that bull run. \n\nIts impossible to say how aware of the full picture the average retail investor is, but my guess is that they've barely heard of Xilinx whilst AMD is more of a household name. \n\nCheck out this link for ratio movement over time: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/upndown/viz/XilinxAMDSharePriceRatio_16114624177710/XilinxAMDSharePriceRatio",

I think the market will be down pretty big in November and December.\n\nHalf of my portfolio is in cash. \n\nHalf of my portfolio is in play, and the reason it's still there is because I do believe there might be one more mini-bull rally before we get closer to November 2nd. My 2nd largest position is in AMD.\n\nMy plan is to try to milk whatever mini-bull rally happens prior to November 2nd. I see October 20th or 21st as the last chances to exit before everybody starts to get really nervous about November 2nd. Starting Monday, I only have about 8 or 9 more market days for half this portfolio.\n\nThen I might be jumping 100 percent to cash. This of course will be a temporary move, but I'm expecting November and December to just be months that most stock enthusiasts would like to forget. So, it's going to take a lot of discipline for me to hold out for the real lows that I'm expecting (at least 25 percent of all-time highs).\n\nBasically, I think when I buy back in either in November or December, I will load the boat with XLNX shares over AMD shares, but who knows if the spread will be as big then?

        "body": "I view the ratio between Xilinx and AMD as a measure of confidence in the likelyhood of the merger. \n\nSince the merger announcement the ratio has mostly been in the 10-15% area. Early August there was a crazy AMD bull run that caused a big spread between the stock values and conversion ratio (as much as a 40% upside of holding Xilinx shares when AMD hit 120). Idk exactly what the catalyst was at that time, but I imagine the WSB hype added to the push (+good Q2). The stocks have been moving very similarly apart from that bull run. \n\nIts impossible to say how aware of the full picture the average retail investor is, but my guess is that they've barely heard of Xilinx whilst AMD is more of a household name. \n\nCheck out this link for ratio movement over time: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/upndown/viz/XilinxAMDSharePriceRatio_16114624177710/XilinxAMDSharePriceRatio",

As a share holder of AMD and TSM I have to say there are always down side in this sector. The two big thing are the numbers of players in the semiconductor manufacturer. There are a lot! AMD is a ant company compare to Intel, Samsung and TSMC. On top of that China SMIC is growing like a weed. This is why Lisa Su is trying to close the deal with Xilinx. She knows they need them to survive. It is though to be in semiconductor business. PLTR on the other has a huge moat it is national security business with next to zero competitor. However, the big issues with PLTR is that it is not a new company and yet its grow is extremely slow. They need to get more commercial clients if they plan to grow.",

I haven't checked since I bought a shitload at the start of August, but there's an arbitrage discount between the two for when xlnx will be converted into AMD. Should be happening any day/week now. \n\nLooking now, 1 xlnx becomes 1.7234 AMD post-merger. AMD is at ~$107 and xlnx is ~$160 today, and even though that's it's 52w high, it should be valued at $184 (107 x 1.7234) if the merger were to go through today. Obviously either stock could move as the one to close the gap and nothing is guaranteed, but worth looking into. \n\nJust make sure you buy a number of xlnx shares that gives a round number when you multiply it by 1.7234",

I think the market will be down pretty big in November and December.\n\nHalf of my portfolio is in cash. \n\nHalf of my portfolio is in play, and the reason it's still there is because I do believe there might be one more mini-bull rally before we get closer to November 2nd. My 2nd largest position is in AMD.\n\nMy plan is to try to milk whatever mini-bull rally happens prior to November 2nd. I see October 20th or 21st as the last chances to exit before everybody starts to get really nervous about November 2nd. Starting Monday, I only have about 8 or 9 more market days for half this portfolio.\n\nThen I might be jumping 100 percent to cash. This of course will be a temporary move, but I'm expecting November and December to just be months that most stock enthusiasts would like to forget. So, it's going to take a lot of discipline for me to hold out for the real lows that I'm expecting (at least 25 percent of all-time highs).\n\nBasically, I think when I buy back in either in November or December, I will load the boat with XLNX shares over AMD shares, but who knows if the spread will be as big then? Or maybe the merger will have been announced as final.",

Since they actually don't manufacture their chips and instead rely on TSMC for doing so, they are actually limited by the shortage. \n\nThey have the better product compared to Intel especially in the hugely important server market. They are gaining market share, but the lack of supply actually saves their rival at the moment. Similarly they'd have no problem selling more CPUs in the laptop/desktop market, chips for the PS5 or hugely in demand GPUs (even though nvidia still has an edge there). \n\nThey'll also buy Xilinx, which adds some nice synergies with the FPGAs. I feel like they most of all need to work on their software and GPUs, but they kind of already have the product range that nvidia would like to achieve by purchasing ARM (which so far doesn't seem to happen).",

I've traded the stock back and forth since February, and I can tell you that the stock was mostly not doing much of anything for long stretches, and then it finally had a big breakout, that pushed it above $100. This happened in this most recent 6 month period, so it seems like AMD is this outstanding performer in the most recent 6 months, but for 4 of those months, it didn't do much of anything.\n\nI still love AMD by the way. One of my favorite stocks going forward.\n\n(Pro Tip - If you plan on going LONG on AMD, with no plans to sell the stock in the next 90 days, then do yourself a huge favor and buy shares of XLNX instead of AMD. The merger has an 85 percent chance of being approved, and if so, you get 1.7234 shares of AMD for each share of XLNX. If you run the numbers right now, it's like buying an AMD share with a $12/$13 off per share coupon. However, if you plan to swing trade AMD, and you might be selling in the next 90 days, then it's better to stay with AMD shares for this purpose)",
