Scanners and hardware once upon a time but now moving more and more into tracking and delivery and data. When you have a barcode on your bracelet at a hospital, it\u2019s theirs. Every item that gets scanned from grocery stores or warehouses is a datapoint. \n\nASML is picks and shovels for semiconductors. If you can\u2019t decide on TSM or NVDA or AMD or MU, then don\u2019t. Get ASML. \n\nICE was boring until recently. Basically stock exchange information and skimming off of trades, solid and safe play. But they just bought Ellie Mae and are very clearly making a play to disrupt the real estate market or at least start skimming from that market as well as selling that data. \n\nWas feeling helpful this evening. Hope you make some money. All of the above have solid balance sheets if anyone still cares about that sort of thing.",

You can take some lessons from it, but think about how much has changed since 1930 when Graham was teaching it, or since 1950 when the book was published, or since 1976 when Graham died. Specifically, the flow and availability of information to the general public, the speed at which information travels, the changes in the business landscape.\n\nYou don't have to invest in \"tech\" (although potentially lumping in a car company \\[TSLA\\], a phone making company \\[AAPL\\], a telecommunications company \\[ZM\\], and payroll company \\[PAYC\\], and an advertising company \\[TTD\\] all together as \"tech\" is somewhat dubious in my opinion). But investing isn't buying a car. Something overpriced can be overpriced forever, and something cheaper is not necessarily going to do the same job as the overpriced one. Cheap stocks are cheap for a reason, you better know why the market is wrong about it or believe in its ability to either become less cheap or grow enough so that even if it stays cheap its price rises. Overvalued is also overvalued for a reason, and selling means you know more than the market and there's a reason it will become less overvalued at some point, at least in relation to how quickly it grows.",
