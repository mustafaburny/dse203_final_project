It's related and I hope some of you can find value in it.\n\nThe people saying \"this isn't a big deal\", I think that's disingenuous.  The people saying \"panic!\", that's also disingenuous.  The fact is, we don't know.  I found [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XtJQzkeAaY) to be very helpful.  He summarizes the potential issues with this new 'nu' variant:\n\n1. It may be more transmissible than other variants, including delta.  That would be shocking because delta is already highly transmissible.\n2. It may be able to get around the vaccines we already have.\n3. It may result in more serious illnesses in those who are infected.  This one is not a serious concern at the moment.\n\nDo note that in this new variant there's 30 mutations to the spike protein, which is why we're concerned that there may implications for vaccine efficacy ([source](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/25/who-calls-special-meeting-to-discuss-new-covid-variant-from-south-africa-with-large-number-of-mutations.html)).\n\nIn terms of investing, I don't encourage anyone to sell off right now.  That's silly.  Stick to your plan.  This was not meant to be a gloom and doom post.  But at the same time, the folks saying \"this is nothing\", that's not accurate.  It might be!  There's been scares before, obviously.  But at least inform yourself a bit before making statements that not only relate to finance and investing, but also to public health.\n\nFurthermore, at least in my case I'm a little scared.  I remember the feeling of the original Covid outbreak.  At first it was some obscure story in China, then Italy, and next thing I know I was told I was going to have to be working from home and could only go out to buy groceries.  I guess I'm a little traumatized.\n\nFor people who think life is clean and perfect all the time, I'm sure this will look like fear mongering or whatever.  So be it.  But hey, I'm scared right now.  I've got a trip back to the USA to visit my parents for Christmas.  I haven't seen them in 2 years.  I'm worried about what this means for my travel plans.  It's normal.  It's human.  Pretending like there isn't a problem when there is one doesn't solve anything.  There's a reason governments are taking this seriously.\n\nAnyway, it may all blow over, I fully acknowledge that and I hope it's the case!  But just pretending like everything is fine isn't the reality of what we're seeing right now.  I imagine I can't be the only one feeling this way.\n\nSo, best of luck to everyone, stick your investing plan and take care of yourselves!\n\n\\-shorty",

We can now address them without nuking the economy. \n\nIt's up to leaders to make good decisions, which are generally sorely lacking, but they can hardly claim ignorance now.\n\nWhat we have learned is that lockdowns don't work but social distancing does. \n\nMarkets aren't stupid, there is a reason we had a V recovery in March. Most businesses are more able than ever to react to a digital first commerce strategy. There is no reason for the economy to tank.\n\nThe only real reasons behind the market crashing are growth. Is growth slowing? Well China is beginning to flash some pretty big signals and as tapering takes it's toll you'll see normal economies slow too. With slowing growth comes P/E ratios under focus. There are a lot of companies that are overvalued BUT there are also a lot of companies which are at like 50% of this years ATH... There are absolutely bubbles in EVs and such but other areas I'd say are fair valued.\n\nOverall we're just entering a time where you need to modify the way you appraise value and what sectors will be more robust against repeat waves of pandemic. It's sort of like being in a war-time market. \n\nSo, all that being said the broad sell off is a big over-correction because of the short trading day and market Thursday close. By Wednesday the headlines will read \"Markets shrug off virus concerns. Fund managers confident businesses can navigate new strains.\" \n\nThe only real areas of struggle will continue to be big events, big sports events and such. Some regions will have them, some will not. Downtown core commercial property will continue to face headwinds but rents just need to fall. This virus is with us literally forever, it will become another seasonal cold/flu/infectious disease and you'll hear about new variants each year. Pharama will start making broad spectrum covid shots that you'll get with your other myriad. Every country will do deals with pharma so they can maintain critical supply. \n\nThrough all this society will, by and large, ignore issues of health, diet, nutrition, and underlying diseases like diabetes, smoking, lack of exercise. Society will also ignore age and treat all people, including children, at the same risk level as an 85 year old. This irrationality will make people more aggressive, combative, and you'll see more political factions in every nation, especially 'freedom parties'. The only way these are neutralized are with open policies but those are by and large against government directives. Truth is they are welcoming the greater control, digital ID, travelling surveillance, contact tracing, immunization databases. These are all useful for maintaining the elites control, and so these ideas will continue.",

Things like pictures of them in the same room as prostitutes or drinking too much so they'd be unsure of what they did the previous day/night and if they said or did something wrong.  He'd then use this as leverage to get them to say favorable things about Russia in the US.\n\nThat was it.  It was all about perception.
