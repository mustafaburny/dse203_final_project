After he was proven right and WSB got 10 times bigger in wake of this insane meme stock bull run, people stopped being so skeptical of investment theses. Hardly anyone plays devils advocate in the comments anymore. This has significantly lowered the quality of investment ideas here",

On a personal note, I want you to know I\u2019m humbled to be elected to your board and serve as your Chairman. We have a lot of work in front of us, and it will take time. We\u2019re trying to do something that nobody in the retail space has ever done but we believe we\u2019re putting the right pieces in place and we have clear goals: delighting customers and driving shareholder value for the longterm. The management team and refreshed board will remain totally focused on these goals at all times. We know some people want us to lay out a whole detailed plan today, but that\u2019s not gonna happen. You won\u2019t find us talking a big game, making a bunch of lofty promises, or telegraphing our strategy to the competition. That\u2019s the philosophy we adopted at Chewy. Here are a few things we\u2019ve done so far: refresh the board, added technology and retail experience to the leadership team, paid off all our long term debt and strengthened the balance sheet, and begun laying the foundation for long term growth. Moving forward, we want you to judge GameStop based on our actions, not our words. Thank you everyone, and as my dad would say, \u201cbuckle up.\"\"",

Most likely to another hedgie.\nWanted to sell 500mil shares at one point for fucks sake, which would\u2019ve doubled the share count.\n\nSame board and ceo whose crap leadership almost bankrupted the company.\n\nDidn\u2019t even give you the option to vote no in the shareholder proxy on board members, only to abstain.\n\nAnd yet people think this is going to squeeze. It\u2019s not. You at least need the company to be a little on your side for damn sake, and all they seem to want to do is dilute the shares and make money for their Golden parachutes. They\u2019ve shown by their actions they\u2019re going to pocket as much money as you\u2019re willing to give them.\n\nI\u2019d rather have one share of GME than 20 shares of amc right now.\n\nI hate this concept of GME and Amc being brothers in squeezing, because the situations of both companies couldn\u2019t be any more different.",

After he was proven right and WSB got 10 times bigger in wake of this insane meme stock bull run, people stopped being so skeptical of investment theses. Hardly anyone plays devils advocate in the comments anymore. This has significantly lowered the quality of investment ideas here",

(Borrow and sell @10 then buy back and return at 5 so you keep 5 bucks per share minus fees). \n\nNaked short selling is when they do this without locating shares to borrow and when they do this in a extremely predatory way, without intention to return the shares via shorting them into bankruptcy. \n\nThe big problem is that short selling dilutes the float and in extreme cases like GME and I'm sure many others, 1 share can be shorted multiple times and there's no limit or restrictions enforced to stop this. (B borrows from A and sell to C. A has the actual share and C is holding a borrowed share. Now D comes in and borrows C's borrowed share and sells to E so on and so forth.) Suddenly you have 1 share but multiple \"fake shares\" out there that are being traded like regular shares. Now at some point these shares must be returned and if the price has risen from the time the shares were shorted, the shorters are at a loss and when they all rush to cover their shorts is what causes the short squeeze.\n\nYes, it is prevalent out there.

[https://www.finra.org/#/](https://www.finra.org/#/)\n\nThey're supposed to regulate all the big boys, but only give them a small fine when they catch them, even if it's for a large infraction that has billions of dollars of implications. It's common for companies to mismark positions as long when they're actually short positions. Sometimes they get caught multiple years later and have to pay a small fine as the \"cost of doing business.\"\n\nFun concluding fact: FINRA as a private corporation has it's own investment portfolios that are managed by the companies that they're allegedly regulating.... Hmmmm seems like some conflicts of interest.\n\nI'm disgusted by all that I've learned about how the U.S. Stock market operates.

I chose to put my money into BB because they seemed like they were the company that was ACTUALLY best positioned for long term growth. The other 2 stocks fucking SKYROCKETED and I missed out on a huge amount of money (which is fine). And now this post is kind of attacking us BB holders for finally trying to ride the hype train and smash the hype? That kind of hurts. I thought apes were strong together :(",

        "body": "Last Friday, when meme stocks AMC and (to a lesser extent) Gamestop were soaring after the latest Reddit-raid decided to snuff out any remaining shorts while piling into the two legacy retail names, we said that the only question is \"whether AMC management will surprise the Reddit army today or if it will wait until after the long weekend to unveil the latest dilution.\"\r  \n\r  \nOne hour ago, with the Memorial Day weekend now in the rearview mirror, we got the answer: it was indeed the latter, with the company announcing the sale of another 8.5 million AMC shares (this followed just three weeks after the company raised $428MM in share) to Mudrick Capital at a price of about $27.12 each. The offering price was, strangely enough, a premium to Friday's close of $26.12 and suggests that Mudrick is now also in on the joke, and is hoping to buy more stock at a higher price while squeezing shorts in the process boosting his existing holdings",
