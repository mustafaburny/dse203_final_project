I fully understand where you're coming from.  I usually invest that way too although I prefer individual stocks to ETFs and mutuals.   \n\nThe market is fucked man.  We already crashed and it's on life support right now from government stimulus.  Canada has already dumped $250 billion into stimulus and the US has put in at least $3 trillion.  That's all gone already, poof.  That is why we saw the recent bump in the market.  Nothing more.  Productivity is not picking up the way we hoped.  There are more shockers on the horizon.  Namely the US unemployment stimulus is ending soon and so is the mortgage holiday.\n\nThe world's economy is teetering right now.  There's more to the story than can be explained here.  What we are going to see is massive consolidation.  Big companies eating up small ones, the FAANG stocks are doing well right now but they rely on a healthy economy for people to buy their products.  It's hard to pay for Netflix if you lost your home.\n\nYou don't have to listen to me and this isn't my opinion either.  Take a look at the latest IMF reports for an impartial viewpoint on what is going on.  Things are bleak and that's accounting for everything that we already know.  Just look at the unrest in the last two weeks.  If any major stressors present themselves we are ultra-fucked.\n\nThe market is in full-on hope and dream mode with a vaccine already priced in.  Even if we had a vaccine today we'd still be screwed.  As long as we get a vaccine, maintain productivity, continue to innovate, and somehow reconcile the massive debt problems we will pull through this.  Those are big ifs.  \n\nThe world will survive I'm not saying this is the apocalypse but economic paradigm shifts have happened before.  China is already pushing out a new government-controlled cryptocurrency and that has powerful ramifications for the USD.  Check out this link (https://www.wired.co.uk/article/china-digital-currency-crypto).\n\nIt's ugly man.  I'm not just sharing my opinion here, the facts are all around us.  I wish this wasn't happening but it is.  The government stimulus kept the boat afloat and gave us time to get our affairs in order.  \n\nI wish nothing more than to be wrong about all of this.  If you know something that I don't please share it with me and I'll jump right back into the market and DCA all day long.\n\nHere are a couple more links:\nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-06-08/a-crash-in-the-dollar-is-coming\nhttps://www.foxbusiness.com/economy/fed-economist-argues-negative-interest-rates-needed-to-boost-us-economic-recovery\nhttps://www.nsenergybusiness.com/features/fossil-fuel-profits-decline/\nhttps://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/06/3-keys-understanding-strangest-economy-ever/612373/\nhttps://www.munknee.com/shift-from-u-s-dollar-as-world-reserve-currency-underway-what-will-this-mean-for-america/\nhttps://theconversation.com/buckle-up-for-turbulence-why-a-global-debt-crisis-looks-very-hard-to-avoid-127260\nhttps://theconversation.com/buckle-up-for-turbulence-why-a-global-debt-crisis-looks-very-hard-to-avoid-127260",

You can get lucky, go on a nice streak and see your stocks rise a lot in a short period of time, but you\u2019re playing with a house of cards.  you want your money to work for you. You may only have $1,300 now, but if you invest in a few, strong companies (profitable, strong balance sheets with positive free cash flow) or in an ETF / index fund where the stock prices will continue to increase over time, then each month or paycheck, set up a recurring deposit. Just like a 401k, you don\u2019t want to touch the money. Just put it in there and try to forget about it (please note, there is nothing wrong with looking to\nRebalance your portfolio every so often) \n\nThere are really 2 keys to investing: 1) always keep investing and 2) having the strength to stay in the game when the market drops 5-10%. \n\nYou want to be in the game as long as possible. \nFor example: if you invest $1,300 today with a $100 recurring monthly deposit and attain a 9% return (average annual return of the S&amp;P 500), in 10 years you\u2019ll have $22,050, in 20 years you\u2019ll have $71,170, but in 30 years you\u2019ll have $187,460. \n\nYou want your investment earnings to keep compounding over time.

        "body": "As a new investor, you\u2019re probably going to get better advice on r/PersonalFinanceCanada about getting started. There are good resources on the sidebar of that sub, search previous posts, and ask questions if you don\u2019t see what you need.\n\nWhether you focus on passive investing, dividend growth, value investing, or something else, you\u2019ll achieve the greatest success by developing an informed strategy and sticking to it. The three keys are: [maximize your investments early](https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2012/01/13/the-shockingly-simple-math-behind-early-retirement/) (the power of compound interest); stick to your strategy (\u201ctime in the market beats timing the market\u201d); and keep your fees low. \n\nFor passive investing, I suggest reading Andrew Hallam\u2019s *Millionaire Teacher* (2nd ed) and John Robertson\u2019s *The Value of Simple*. The archive of the [CCP blog](https://canadiancouchpotato.com/model-portfolios/) is a great resource, and more tips on the mechanics of passive investing are on the [CPM blog](https://www.canadianportfoliomanagerblog.com/model-etf-portfolios/). There are great videos on discrete passive investing topics on Ben Felix\u2019s [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDXTQ8nWmx_EhZ2v-kp7QxA) but I suggest reading the resources I\u2019ve mentioned (particularly the two books) to have a better sense of what he\u2019s talking about.\n\nIf passive investing isn\u2019t for you, there are great resources on the sidebars (wikis, FAQs, book lists) of r/SecurityAnalysis, r/stocks, and r/investing.\n\nMy two cents: use your TFSA to buy shares in an all-in-one fund that tracks with your [risk profile](https://www.vanguardcanada.ca/individual/questionnaire.htm). Your greatest advantage is time, and investing early in a balanced all-in-one ETF could provided you with 20x-30x your investment by the time you retire.",

My company was a partner of Avalara's for years.\n\nI'm not familiar with AVLR's financials so I can't speak to how efficiently they are being run, but they are virtually guaranteed to continue their strong revenue growth. As it relates to the US ecommerce market, it's been the wild west since online shopping's inception. AVLR automates key tax processes &amp; compliance by State, which as most would imagine differs significantly from one State to another and is a real pain in the ass for online retailers to keep up with changes/nuances/requirements/regulations. Up until the last few years, there hasn't been any governance around taxes for online shopping (even for large online retailers like Amazon). It sounds crazy, but a lot of online transactions haven't been taxed properly/correctly. That's starting to change and be monitored by Government, State by State and Avalara offers a great solution for this. With ecommerce adoption being further accelerated thanks to COVID, it stands to reason that an already growing industry (ecommerce) will continue to grow and AVLR stand to benefit nicely from this.\n\nThey are not the only players in this space (they do have lots of competition), but are easily one of the leading solution providers and have been for some time. One of the big keys to me for software like this is integration into other core ecommerce systems like payment processors/systems, ecommerce platform (ECP), order management (OMS), CRM/ERP/and more.

Never before have we had a system where anyone could create value and do it without the government stepping in. In traditional financial systems your value is controlled by the company in their own database. In crypto everyone involved gets ownership over their own part of the database if you control the keys yourself (holding on coinbase vs your own means). \n\nHowever, there are problems. One of the biggest now is scaling blockchains to handle more users. Right now both Bitcoin and Ethereum are struggling with how to deal with this. There are solutions, but they will take time to implement and they require general acceptance from the community to be useful. If you want to know what scaling problems mean to you just look at what it costs to send a transaction on the chains. \n\nThere is a lot more to look at with cryptos, but I would say if you want the value to increase then the issue of scaling the blockchains would be the biggest risk to the value of your coins right now.",

You can get lucky, go on a nice streak and see your stocks rise a lot in a short period of time, but you\u2019re playing with a house of cards.  you want your money to work for you. You may only have $1,300 now, but if you invest in a few, strong companies (profitable, strong balance sheets with positive free cash flow) or in an ETF / index fund where the stock prices will continue to increase over time, then each month or paycheck, set up a recurring deposit. Just like a 401k, you don\u2019t want to touch the money. Just put it in there and try to forget about it (please note, there is nothing wrong with looking to\nRebalance your portfolio every so often) \n\nThere are really 2 keys to investing: 1) always keep investing and 2) having the strength to stay in the game when the market drops 5-10%. \n\nYou want to be in the game as long as possible. \nFor example: if you invest $1,300 today with a $100 recurring monthly deposit and attain a 9% return (average annual return of the S&amp;P 500), in 10 years you\u2019ll have $22,050, in 20 years you\u2019ll have $71,170, but in 30 years you\u2019ll have $187,460. \n\nYou want your investment earnings to keep compounding over time.

Focus on maybe 2 or 3 stocks that you think could move well in the day and go after them. If you're trying to do like 10 or 15 or something, you're splitting up your attention too much. This then directly leads to;\n\n2) Don't be too greedy. If you earn some gains, take them. Prioritize ending the day up from where you started, even if it's by a smaller amount than you maybe would hope. I think a lot of day traders end up losing because they stay on a position too long, hoping for more, and then the floor falls out from under them.\n\nAnd (again this is just personal opinion), don't play options. Options, to me, are just pure gambling and really stupid, because even if you take a chance on a stock and it doesn't pan out that day, well, at least, you own it, it's still an investment \u2013\u00a0six months later it might go up again and you can sell it them.",
