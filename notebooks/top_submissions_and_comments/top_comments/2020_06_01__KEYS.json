        "body": "This is highly misleading and not narrow enough to see the true scope of what is happening to hotels/hospitality right now.\n\nWhile leisure bookings are way up, this short term booking window is simply opening the valve on pent up demand. This is in no way sustainable. Leisure bookings cannot support the current hotel infrastructure.\n\nThe loss of Group is the major blow to the hospitality community. Even if this leisure booking wave continues, the loss of major Banquet and Catering revenue is going to challenge many of these hotels, leisure resorts included. Groups dwarf leisure travel in non room revenue spend on a percentage basis. Any hotel of size in terms of meeting space will be looking at dramatically reduced revenues for the next 2-3 years, best case.\n\nThe Corporate, Association, and Citywide group segment that layer in critical base to hotels in all markets have essentially been wiped out. This leaves the SMERFE (Social, Military, Educational, Religious, Fraternal, and Ethnic) and Wedding segments as the primary driver of group business during this transitional period. These typically stay during weekends, which will crossover with the leisure segment. Even the most famous \"pure\" leisure markets (think Hawaii or Palm Springs) still have a 15-20% dependency on Group.\n\nThe second issue is supply. There is a dramatic reduction in the number of keys available compared to February. Many hotels are operating with reduced staffing and reduced available keys. As more of this supply comes on board, the pool of leisure will not increase, just get more diluted. This will naturally lead to ADR and RevPAR reduction over time.\n\nFinally, with events of all size unlikely to either come to fruition in the next 12 months or looking at reduced head counts, hotels are frankly operating with absolutely no long term base of size. The only group production coming is moved events from 2020 during the heart of the crisis. Once these events are consumed, the long range scope for hotels is very disheartening. Furthermore, the return of COVID in general is causing the last bits of 2020 business to either cancel or give notice that it is a possibility.\n\nFranchise models like Marriott and Hilton will be looking at heavily reduced Franchise Fees, especially in the F&amp;B segment (where they typically command a higher % than rooms). The questions I come back to are the following:\n\n1. How many of these leisure bookings came via point redemption? Without the ability to fill consistently and hit enhanced occupancy monetary kickers, individual properties get low compensation for these bookings. My statistics (I work for a hotel company) show that these types of bookings are leading the charge as the highest performing segment. In some of my hotels, these are compensated to the property at less than $40.\n2. The complete lack of Group for the remainder of 2020, and the lack of new Group pipeline for 2021 through 2025. In turn, the loss of profitable F&amp;B will take years to rectify.\n3. Secondary and tertiary markets are showing alarming statistics in terms of long range base business. I'm not worried about the mega markets long term (NYC, Chicago, SF, LA, NOLA etc.) but the secondary and tertiary hotel markets have a heavier dependency on Group and Convention business. The leisure pool is too small to support these markets.\n\nI am primarily looking at hotel companies that have a larger portfolio of independent hotels in destination markets that have a reliable drive-in base AND/OR a limited/select service portfolio.",

I fully understand where you're coming from.  I usually invest that way too although I prefer individual stocks to ETFs and mutuals.   \n\nThe market is fucked man.  We already crashed and it's on life support right now from government stimulus.  Canada has already dumped $250 billion into stimulus and the US has put in at least $3 trillion.  That's all gone already, poof.  That is why we saw the recent bump in the market.  Nothing more.  Productivity is not picking up the way we hoped.  There are more shockers on the horizon.  Namely the US unemployment stimulus is ending soon and so is the mortgage holiday.\n\nThe world's economy is teetering right now.  There's more to the story than can be explained here.  What we are going to see is massive consolidation.  Big companies eating up small ones, the FAANG stocks are doing well right now but they rely on a healthy economy for people to buy their products.  It's hard to pay for Netflix if you lost your home.\n\nYou don't have to listen to me and this isn't my opinion either.  Take a look at the latest IMF reports for an impartial viewpoint on what is going on.  Things are bleak and that's accounting for everything that we already know.  Just look at the unrest in the last two weeks.  If any major stressors present themselves we are ultra-fucked.\n\nThe market is in full-on hope and dream mode with a vaccine already priced in.  Even if we had a vaccine today we'd still be screwed.  As long as we get a vaccine, maintain productivity, continue to innovate, and somehow reconcile the massive debt problems we will pull through this.  Those are big ifs.  \n\nThe world will survive I'm not saying this is the apocalypse but economic paradigm shifts have happened before.  China is already pushing out a new government-controlled cryptocurrency and that has powerful ramifications for the USD.  Check out this link (https://www.wired.co.uk/article/china-digital-currency-crypto).\n\nIt's ugly man.  I'm not just sharing my opinion here, the facts are all around us.  I wish this wasn't happening but it is.  The government stimulus kept the boat afloat and gave us time to get our affairs in order.  \n\nI wish nothing more than to be wrong about all of this.  If you know something that I don't please share it with me and I'll jump right back into the market and DCA all day long.\n\nHere are a couple more links:\nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-06-08/a-crash-in-the-dollar-is-coming\nhttps://www.foxbusiness.com/economy/fed-economist-argues-negative-interest-rates-needed-to-boost-us-economic-recovery\nhttps://www.nsenergybusiness.com/features/fossil-fuel-profits-decline/\nhttps://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/06/3-keys-understanding-strangest-economy-ever/612373/\nhttps://www.munknee.com/shift-from-u-s-dollar-as-world-reserve-currency-underway-what-will-this-mean-for-america/\nhttps://theconversation.com/buckle-up-for-turbulence-why-a-global-debt-crisis-looks-very-hard-to-avoid-127260\nhttps://theconversation.com/buckle-up-for-turbulence-why-a-global-debt-crisis-looks-very-hard-to-avoid-127260",

Right now, any business you invest in that depends on trade with China (in other words: **every stock you own**) is being whipsawed around based on how many farts the bozo-in-chief had that day.

You can get lucky, go on a nice streak and see your stocks rise a lot in a short period of time, but you\u2019re playing with a house of cards.  you want your money to work for you. You may only have $1,300 now, but if you invest in a few, strong companies (profitable, strong balance sheets with positive free cash flow) or in an ETF / index fund where the stock prices will continue to increase over time, then each month or paycheck, set up a recurring deposit. Just like a 401k, you don\u2019t want to touch the money. Just put it in there and try to forget about it (please note, there is nothing wrong with looking to\nRebalance your portfolio every so often) \n\nThere are really 2 keys to investing: 1) always keep investing and 2) having the strength to stay in the game when the market drops 5-10%. \n\nYou want to be in the game as long as possible. \nFor example: if you invest $1,300 today with a $100 recurring monthly deposit and attain a 9% return (average annual return of the S&amp;P 500), in 10 years you\u2019ll have $22,050, in 20 years you\u2019ll have $71,170, but in 30 years you\u2019ll have $187,460. \n\nYou want your investment earnings to keep compounding over time.

There are good resources on the sidebar of that sub, search previous posts, and ask questions if you don\u2019t see what you need.\n\nWhether you focus on passive investing, dividend growth, value investing, or something else, you\u2019ll achieve the greatest success by developing an informed strategy and sticking to it. The three keys are: [maximize your investments early](https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2012/01/13/the-shockingly-simple-math-behind-early-retirement/) (the power of compound interest); stick to your strategy (\u201ctime in the market beats timing the market\u201d); and keep your fees low. \n\nFor passive investing, I suggest reading Andrew Hallam\u2019s *Millionaire Teacher* (2nd ed) and John Robertson\u2019s *The Value of Simple*. The archive of the [CCP blog](https://canadiancouchpotato.com/model-portfolios/) is a great resource, and more tips on the mechanics of passive investing are on the [CPM blog](https://www.canadianportfoliomanagerblog.com/model-etf-portfolios/). There are great videos on discrete passive investing topics on Ben Felix\u2019s [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDXTQ8nWmx_EhZ2v-kp7QxA) but I suggest reading the resources I\u2019ve mentioned (particularly the two books) to have a better sense of what he\u2019s talking about.\n\nIf passive investing isn\u2019t for you, there are great resources on the sidebars (wikis, FAQs, book lists) of r/SecurityAnalysis, r/stocks, and r/investing.\n\nMy two cents: use your TFSA to buy shares in an all-in-one fund that tracks with your [risk profile](https://www.vanguardcanada.ca/individual/questionnaire.htm). Your greatest advantage is time, and investing early in a balanced all-in-one ETF could provided you with 20x-30x your investment by the time you retire.",

Best to enter a position on MAC with short puts, since the premiums for options are quite healthy.  \n\nWith mall reits in particular, it is important to consider which loans are recourse or non recourse.  Non recourse simply means that MAC can always just toss the keys back the lender and tell them to fuck off.\n\nMAC has a lot of leverage, but 84% of the total obligations are non recourse loans.  Lenders either play ball, or MAC can hand the keys over and wash their hands of it and selling the mall is now the bank's problem.  You can be sure the banks do not want to become mall owners.\n\nThe rest is a combination of credit facilities and recourse loans.  Either way, I think MAC isn't going to go bankrupt, even if you assume MAC hands back the keys for every non recourse loan, and keeps only those properties with recourse loans, or are unencumbered by debt, they will have substantial positive NAV that will easily support a 9.00 a share price.  MAC has a lot of high quality real estate, it is these malls and real estate that will hold value the best and that make MAC the most money.\n\nWhatever malls don't look great, MAC can just hand the keys to the lender and let the mall be their problem. 84% non-recourse debt is nice.",

What concessions will groups now be seeking? How many associations will disband because they couldn't hold a conference this year (where attendance fees often provide more money than Association dues) \n\nWith that said, I'm much more concerned about the current COVID spike reverting some states back to late March/early April restrictions.

Okta had a very good quarter the other day, Crowdstrike yesterday. Visa said two days ago that trends continue to improve, Paypal said April was the best month since its IPO.\n\nSome emerging markets tech names doing well. Look at SE +117% YTD. MELI +40%\n\n Google and Facebook suffered from ad spending on things like travel being down (Booking and Expedia spend a fortune on Google ads - Expedia's chairman noted \"\u201cAt Expedia, for instance, we spend $5 billion a year on advertising. We won\u2019t spend $1 billion on advertising probably this year.\" A couple of years ago, Booking spent a billion on Google ads in the quarter (https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/05/travel-giant-booking-spent-1-billion-on-google-ads-in-the-quarter.html.) So those companies are uniquely effected, but things have improved as Facebook noted on their conference call. Google may have suspended some spending recently, but they announced the other day that employees who choose to work from home can expense a grand worth of office furniture. https://nypost.com/2020/05/26/google-will-let-workers-expense-1000-worth-of-office-furniture/\n\nWork from home has certainly done well too, but if that becomes a bigger part of culture going forward to some degree, that becomes a long-term theme. Remote work - look at RNG, ZM, FIVN.  Look at telehealth - Teladoc has done well this year but Livongo +145% YTD. Look at CDN names like FSLY, which is +150% YTD/NET +71%",

As for the lists I believe there are etfs with all the holdings so kind of defeats the purpose of paying monthly.\n\nThat being said marketsmith is pretty good no doubt. Just very expensive. At around 50 a month it would be great for individual investors.\n\nThe cup and handle pattern is great pattern for the bull market no doubt about it.\n\nI havent looked at gorilla trades.

        "body": "You probably should have closed 5 minutes before close but maybe QCOM rockets tomorrow and also has high IV, resulting in you making even more money.  I'll discuss my trade and perhaps my thought process will help you, but keep in mind what I did may not yield the highest profit (i.e., you might make more by holding).\n\nI bought 1 QCOM 12 JUN 20 85c at 0.52 at 11:40 am ET ([proof](https://imgur.com/a/voVXNSz), the times in the trade here are Pacific but I use Eastern in the post so people don't get confused) and closed at 3:55 pm ET at 1.87.  In light of the other activity in the option chain, I was confident that this unusual option activity (UOA) was not an arbitrage play (e.g., conversion or reverse conversion).  That said, the UOA volume on calls doesn't tell you if the \"smart\" money was short or long in the position (i.e., in the 22,000 that resulted from the 35,000 volume yesterday, how many of those 22,000 contracts is the smart money long or short on, it's one or the other).  I did not look at the history to see the skew between calls and puts, but perhaps selling calls might have netted more premium in the event of a decline in QCOM (e.g., instead of buying puts at a higher premium and profiting when the stock declines, maybe they were looking to sell a call at, say, 0.50 and with a market decline, buy to close their calls at, say, 0.25).  But I ultimately concluded that the smart money being short on the calls was highly unlikely in light the QCOM's presence in the 5G arena and then some; and, therefore, I was fairly confident that the smart money was bullish on QCOM and therefore long on all of these calls.  How confident?  1 contract worth, lol...but this more or less stems from me selecting--in a testing type way--UOA to participate in and gauge my analysis of the UOA.  I want to see if I am analyzing things correctly before I go to 5 or 10 contracts.\n\nWith such large activity on the call side, the market maker who is short all of these calls is in a risky situation since they are short \\~22,000 calls at this strike price alone (remember, other UOA was present on calls at other strike prices).  That means the market maker may, but not necessarily, start buying stock to hedge its position against these short calls.  Why does this matter?  If the market maker chooses to hedge, this can cause a rally because the market maker is buying TONS of stock.  Perhaps that's what happened today, or maybe the market maker didn't hedge and the rally is attributable to something else.  To me, it seems like the market maker hedged by buying shares because of the absolutely staggering increase in volume on the stock (not the option) starting at around 2:40 pm.  Who knows, maybe this volume wasn't the market maker.  I welcome any thoughts on my analysis.\n\nNow, why did I close at 3:55 pm?  I looked at one thing (because the position was already doing very well):  The volume on the 12 JUN 20 85c at the time.  It was around 20,000-21,000 (I don't remember exactly).  I interpreted this to mean that the smart money had closed most, if not all, of their long calls.  We'll find out tomorrow morning when we look at OI.  [Here](https://imgur.com/a/Pkd9wly) is a picture of the option chain after close (it shows OI and volume).  I'm guessing the OI will be around 5,000 or less.  If the smart money is closing, I wanted to follow suit and so I did.  Why does it matter?  If the rally was indeed a result of the market maker hedging its position on all of the short calls it held, then after it's need for the hedge disappears, so too does its need for the shares and a sell off by the market maker can (but not necessarily) occur.  [Here](https://imgur.com/a/viVMkyu) is a picture of the afternoon rally.  I got one of the highest prices when I closed.  Within the last 5 minutes after I closed my position, the premium dropped to around 1.70.  You can see the last trade in the option chain picture is 1.71.\n\nHope all of this helps.  Again, I welcome anyone's feedback on my analysis!  And who knows, maybe I missed out on profits by closing at 3:55pm.  Time will tell.  Regardless, I am very happy with this trade.  Good luck to you all!\n\nEdit:  Another possible scenario I thought of is the smart money wanting to enter a large position in the underlying in a short period of time and so to offset the increased cost of the shares they buy in a vast quantity, they buy calls beforehand to reduce their basis in the stock by selling the calls after their entry causes a rally.",

        "body": "\nAs an engineer I implore that you take a look into Cloudflare Workers and Fastlys media optimizations. You have organizations like Reddit using Fastly because the companies are supermassive and can't always commit the same concentrations to processing or security like smaller, lazer focused, mature startups. Fastly and Cloudflare aren't startups anymore - they are pioneers in the modern CDN market where a CDN service is built around specific optimizations. In the case of Cloudflare - it's security. In the case of Reese's, it was peanut butter.\n\n\n\nCloudflare Workers is impressive because it compiles down to web assembly when you're computing requests at the network level.\n\n\nThe point of the thesis is that the demand for all CDN and cloud *infrastructure* has accelerated. The inherent value of the product is evident in Akamais long term survival.\n\n\nLyft, Facebook, Shopify, Stackoverflow, NPM and hospitals are all market mover enterprises that use Cloudflare.  We use Cloudflare at my job for error logging and speed performances (fintech)\n\n\nSeries D invested by Google, Microsoft, Baidu, and Qualcomm:\n\n\n\"So lastly, I wanted to talk about some of our customer wins for the quarter. We had some incredible wins, like a credit reporting service that signed a three-year deal worth $800,000 per year; a major gaming platform with a deal worth over $1 million per year; a reinsurance provider who will pay us $750,000 over three years to protect their network; and a U.S. government agency using a broad set of our platform's features to secure nuclear research for over $150,000 per year. But let me focus on some customers that are uniquely relevant to this moment.\n\nA company, many of us are relying on to deliver food to our homes while we shelter in place signed a deal for over $600,000 per year in January. In March, their demand was up so much, they increased their deal by more than $500,000 per year. One of their goals was to ensure that they could decrease their dependency on Amazon Web Services. They found Cloudflare was not only faster and more robust but also significantly more cost effective.\n\nOne of the largest telemedicine providers in the United States turned to Cloudflare as the crisis set in. They had to shift the majority of their physicians from clinics where they had legacy on-premise security hardware to their homes where, obviously, they did not. As a highly regulated industry, security of patient information is critical. They onboarded their physicians onto Cloudflare for Teams so they could keep serving patients.\n\n...\n\nAnd JD Cloud really fit that bill incredibly well. And so we signed an agreement with them. It's going to take us a little bit of time for us to get that online, but I'm incredibly excited about it. We're adding 50 new cities per year to a total of 150 PoPs across China that will augment the existing network that we have with Baidu\"",

Vinh thinks the request would be granted, and that it would be accompanied by a patent license agreement between Qualcomm and Huawei.
