A lot of eggs in a few baskets is easier to watch than ten baskets. You can't effectively watch ten companies. You will have more luck getting to know two or three. You will also be more invested mentally. Putting $3k in ten companies doesn't make you more secure. It thins out your ability to pay attention effectively. Ten will make you emotional. You're focus will be split ten ways and you won't be making significant money from any of them. Focus on your best three or four ideas. Put $10k into Disney. Then wait another quarter and put another $10k into Disney. Wait another quarter and put the last $10k into Disney. ONE stock. Or you can buy some junior mining penny stocks like me. Up 50% since Thursday. This is speculation on the assumption that after a crash there is a mining boom. This is gambling. Disney is the real deal. Bank on Disney, put $3k into sphinx resources. You'll regret sphinx, but Disney will pay off until the day you're diagnosed with stage 4 cancer. Know what causes cancer? stress. You'll stress about ten small investments until you sell for some reason some day, or you'll feel secure in one good investment forever. \n\nWhy DXC? because it's a spin off and Joel Greenblatt told me those can be lucrative. I'm a fan though. I want it to do well. I like DXC and Garrett... I own neither. There are at least seven companies I'd buy before those two. Six of them are Canadian banks. If I wanted a sure thing... If I wanted something that would exist in 50 years... something I could buy enough of so that their dividends afforded more shares of that company... something that creditors trust even in a crisis, something with a brand akin to a cult... something that just cannot fail... I'd buy Disney. It's only $30k. Buy Disney all through the recession. $30k worth of shares averaging down over the next year will pay off until you die. \n\nAll those other choices are meh. Amazon might be a good one, but it's on top already. Tesla isn't profitable and they make cars. These other ones are not 50 year companies. They compete in competitive industries where competitive destruction reigns. Disney is different. In conclusions: spend $30k on apple.",

Don\u2019t be afraid of a drop just average costs if it drops dramatically. \n\n- Adobe should do well with this stay at home. School is requiring the use as well as businesses from home. \n\n- Amazon is essentially showing its untouchable currently. I\u2019m large into amazon as well. \n\n- Disney is another powerhouse that you\u2019ll never need to worry about. The lost revenues over the following 8 months could cause a dramatic drop, in this scenario don\u2019t panic and average your cost. \n\n- Enph - energy, I\u2019m not familiar with this company. \n\n- Facebook is another powerhouse good pick. \n\n- Google - Great pick. \n\n- MasterCard is also a good pick, hold this. Average if it comes down to although you shouldn\u2019t have to they trade rather high. If you\u2019re at a major loss with their recent decline. Average in the next 3 months when there\u2019s a better understanding how financials will deal with crisis. (You shouldn\u2019t need to) \n\n- Microsoft - I love microsoft. They are on a tear currently. Teams daily usage is up 12 million users in the last month, this is major. Their competition is \u201cwork\u201d slack technologies who I am also Long. \n\n- Netflix has been great good pick. \n\n- Nike is a great pick. I could expand but they\u2019ve always done well. Constant increase throughout the life of their stock. \n\n- Nvidia is a powerhouse as well. Great pick. \n\n- Starbucks is great. I haven\u2019t followed them through the virus but they\u2019re a strong company large capital, their profits are also great. Good pick. \n\n- Square I like square a lot. Square has major potential in different avenues. Cash app, lending (they just got approved to lend during this time). Prior to the virus square was on a tear. I\u2019m long on this I got in early and am very big on square. \n\nIf you\u2019re interested in diversification:\n\nAll that being said you really are big into tech, I would suggest diversification. \n\n\u201cOxy\u201d - occidental petroleum is a good long term stock. They\u2019re trading extremely low currently due to oil wars, corona virus, issues on the board and the purchase of anadarko. (This scares a lot of investors but you seem to want long term investments) it\u2019s a steal at 15$ a share. \n\n- Johnson and Johnson is a powerhouse. \n\n- Jet blue &amp; Delta - long term great investments. Short term extremely risky. \n\n- Walmart: trading high but they\u2019re only going to go even higher when this is over. \n\n- AT&amp;T and Verizon: AT&amp;T trades fairly low with a large dividend. GREAT LONG TERM. Verizon has been extremely strong throughout the years.  \n\n- Ford on the long term has a lot of upside trading around half of its average price. Ford pays dividend and  history has proven America will never let ford fail. \n\n- USO is an ETF that tracks United States Oil, It\u2019s trading extremely low, no reason not to diversify with this. ( The oil war between Saudi and Russia is coming to an end, this should do well in the long term) \n\n- Have you put any though into mutual funds to also diversify ? A good managed funds typically has large returns and low risk. \n\nReach out to me if you\u2019d like.",

For example i have been buying BMY and ABBV on a 30% discount (3.5% and 5.5% dividend respectively). But also stocks with a lot of growth potential like ENPH and LRCX. I am not done buying so whenever they get cheaper I spill in some more. These are not recommendations but stocks I have found potential in. \n\nGood thing about dividend stocks is that they tend to have a more stable price and not swing down that much.",

Our clients want renewable power, and we make it happen for them, sending out RFPs to developers and getting their project bids. We get a fee from our clients for brokering these projects.

Just wait until you feel it\u2019s ready to break out of its range and boom you\u2019ll make an easy 300%+.",

        "body": "You should be writing cash covered puts if this is your entry method.\n\nIf you're picking a fixed price and not taking in a premium in exchange for the hour-to-hour uncertainty, then I can't say I agree at all with this method.\n\nI've been active trading this market since the peak and there have been days where I've flattened my account three separate times in the course of a single market session. Some days have more price discovery action and more game changing news than entire weeks had during the previous low-vix periods. If you're picking a price (which seems arbitrary to begin with, but let's assume it's a price perfectly in the middle of the \"fair\" price for your investment portfolio), then it's a distinct possibility that the assumptions that went into choosing the price are very out of date within even 24 hours.\n\nI'd rather just scale in over a fixed period of time and not fixate on specific price points. And again, if you do have a fixed entry in mind, then write puts on that strike. You will get paid for the implied uncertainty that propagates out over the time period that you choose the entry price to the expiration date. I did this for IBM @ 90 a few weeks back (because I was 100% on board with buying IBM at 90 even if the bottom fell out of the market and SPY went to 2k), and picked up 4 bucks for it. That's a 5% discount on entry if it executed, and since it's not going to execute it's simply a decent chunk of money in exchange for just for committing to the offer to buy at 90.",

Or maybe that was some later old conspiratorial white dude.  Anyway, no longer backed by a tangible asset, but rather by the \"faith and credit\" of the US, we started using money that couldn't be turned into gold.\n\nHas the same thing happened with stocks?  Earnings aren't here yet, and who knows what the damage is to the companies traded, but have we silently, through ma and pop retail investors, indexes, fed pumping, etc., also changed the stock market to fiat stocks where my shares of SPY have nothing to do with the value of the underlying companies, and everything to do with the \"faith and credit\" of the good ole Ameri-cone dream?  \n\nSeriously, is there any other way to explain the behavior of the markets lately?

Exp: 4/9 Reason I did a spread and not naked was due to lack of capital at time being.\n\nI'm new to TA but wanted to try using what seem to be the most intuitive indicators for me - RSI, VWAP, and 50/200 MA.\n\n**My DD**\n\nWhen I entered the position, RSI seemed good but has gone up to 56 now, so that's got me a little bit worried.\n\nHowever, APT has crossed and come over the 50MA line 3 times in the last 5 days, which I read now as a support rather than a distance. It has also directly bounced off the 200MA which is good to see as well.\n\nMarket EOD was $18.xx or so, but VWAP is around $15\\~. Perhaps a good entry tomorrow for a long position will be if it returns to VWAP, but regarding the explosiveness and nature of the stock I'm also debating just buying ASAP with expiry for next week.\n\nAs for the strike price I'm looking at, I'm looking at around $25/26, which is where it peaked last time in early march.\n\n**Sentiment** \\- Talks about Americans getting used to the idea of having to wear masks. The thing is 3M, DuPont, etc. make PPE (personal protection equipment) but really APT has been sort of the front man of that for a while now. \n\nWith fear going to spike up again this week, I think it'll be good to get in and take a long. Plus volume was only 20 million today, so hasn't been \"discovered\" by the media yet. \n\nAny tips/advice for a newbie would be very beneficial.",

Get out before the turn.\nEven my 10-40 sma crossover gives false signals.\nObviously, the goal is to ride some wave higher.  It's coming today or next week, but this week, using this method is a bust.\nI bought a 5% position in SSO Wednesday at a crossover signal (~2500), but ended up holding it vs selling on a down signal.  I did that because I knew price would cover back to this level.  Then, as prices hit the 78.6% retracement, I added another 5%.  O added a third 5% on another retracement Thursday.\nI held these 3 positions until Thursday pm.  Sold for $2000 gain.\n\nSo it was a combination of...\n1. Moving average crossover entry.\n2. Dollar cost averaging on retracements.\n3. Fib levels for entry.\n4. Double top level for exit (Thursday high).\n\nA lot more work than the casual investor is looking for.

        "body": "Reasonable options, but they all have notable downfalls.\n\nOne of the big ones is that a centralized blockchain will never suffice to replace something like Visa.\n\nThe current international transaction rate of credit cards peaks around 25,000 per second (christmas eve of 2019) combining major brands (visa, mastercard, etc)\n\nCash is probably significantly higher than that worldwide.\n\nFor a currency to \"replace\" money or credit cards or banks, as the long-term stated goal of crypto enthusiasts, it has to scale to numbers on the order of thousands of transactions per second.\n\nBitcoin, Zcash and Monero as they are designed, are all fundamentally centralized public blockchains that implement various forms of anonymization for wallet transactions.  \n\nHowever, in reality, it's probably not practical for all nodes to know about all transactions everywhere in the world at all times.   That requirement fundamentally means that every node everywhere has to constantly consume 5-20mbps of incoming transaction data, 24/7/365 and that's assuming no significant growth in transaction volumes.\n\nEven with aggressive pruning of transactions, the volume of data to accurately summarize the net worth of 7 billion people plus their various businesses, teams, organizations, accounts and otherwise would be extraordinary (trillions of transactions, at least - possibly a petabyte of data).\n\nIn the current blockchain concept, any transactions that have any significant notable value to the network have to be recorded on this chain, or they can't be verified.  Concepts like lightening network on bitcoin can \"shard\" some of this off, but these side transactions are fundamentally unverified, and the money used in them is fundamentally locked out of the main wallet of anyone using these channels, making them practical for certain activities (say, buying some gum), but impractical for something like transacting your rent, or any other dollar value that you value.\n\nSome concepts of more broad global sharding of the main chain exist, but under \"proof of work\" that doesn't really work well without establishing \"trusted nodes\" to referee the sharding and that doesn't make the decentralization proponents happy.\n\nIt's probably possible to design something, maybe using a proof of stake system with stakeholders pooled into smaller shards, but that runs a greater risk of having network takeovers, unless you have a referee system that patrols for large movements of stakeholders into shards in order to pool stakes and subvert the voting system for monetary gain.\n\nIt's not a solved problem and no platform currently exists that could plausibly take over world currency transactions, or even a smaller credit card player like Discover, in terms of size and volume.\n\nProof of work, in my opinion, is a poor tech and while I play in crypto as a speculative instrument, I view it like a penny stock in a worthless industry from a true fundamentals perspective.\n\nBut that's just my educated opinion.",
