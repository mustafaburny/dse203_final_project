As I mentioned though, I've been doing both. For VTI as an example, I've been buying on a regular cadence (weekly Market orders) as well as setting limit orders at $130, another at $120, another at $110, another at $100. My $130 and $120 filled on the way down, my $110 and $100 will likely expire before they fill and thats ok!\n\nIf you eventually get into individual stocks, then limit orders make more sense. For example, I wanted to get into BRK.B, (Berkshire Hathaway) so I had a limit order set at the exact price where the price was equal to the book value of the company. That isn't a 'foolproof' way to invest or anything and isn't the best metric to look at, but it's what I decided on. I wasn't alone in that idea though, as it didn't really drop too far below that before going back up. YMMV.",

As I mentioned though, I've been doing both. For VTI as an example, I've been buying on a regular cadence (weekly Market orders) as well as setting limit orders at $130, another at $120, another at $110, another at $100. My $130 and $120 filled on the way down, my $110 and $100 will likely expire before they fill and thats ok!\n\nIf you eventually get into individual stocks, then limit orders make more sense. For example, I wanted to get into BRK.B, (Berkshire Hathaway) so I had a limit order set at the exact price where the price was equal to the book value of the company. That isn't a 'foolproof' way to invest or anything and isn't the best metric to look at, but it's what I decided on. I wasn't alone in that idea though, as it didn't really drop too far below that before going back up. YMMV.",
