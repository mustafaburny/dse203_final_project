So competitors tried to copy the size and shape without really understanding where the world was heading under their nose.\n\nI think that analogy is playing out right now in autos. Every trad auto company still thinks the goal is to build a better EV than Tesla. The goal is to build a better robotic transportation device. A working EV is the bare bare minimum.",

I hate that on some Samsung and lg androids you get a whole package of bloat ware that makes it a little different than other android devices and then after a while you just stop getting updates. I really prefer Motorola flagship phones with a metal frame that come with a completely bone stock android meaning they\u2019ll be the first to get updates. My last androids were from the Moto z series that worked with the moto mods, really wish they kept going with that experiment, the possibilities were endless. I bundle phone with home internet with Xfinity though and only so many phone options are supported. I even told the sales guy that someone could make a fortune selling iPhone cases (kinda like the charge cases) that had all the extra features people miss",
