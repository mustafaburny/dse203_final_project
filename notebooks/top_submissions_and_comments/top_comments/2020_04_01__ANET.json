I appreciate your disciplined approach, especially being in your mid-20\u2019s.  The only top of the mind thoughts I had are:\n\nGo with individual stocks if you enjoy stock picking, you can index in your 401k and ESOP.\n-drop oracle from the list\n- add AYX and possibly ANET to your tech list, everything else on there looks great.\n- I like higher growth names in healthcare as well, LVGO, GH, HQY come to mind as all long term plays (I also own Illumina, watching NVTA but don\u2019t love it)\n- PINS and SFIX seem to have a lot of upside from current levels as well, (SFIX popped pop my radar due to incredible amounts of insider buying). \n\nHope this gives you some decent ideas, either approach seems well thought out and would work fine.  I guess it depends on how much time you want to dedicate to it and how much you enjoy stock picking.",

So what this should do is continue to provide the businesses hat utilize zoom or ANET to have a better connection overall.\n\nSo it's definitely seeing a benefit here thanks to this stay home economy. \n\nMy only concern with ANET is just the volume, as the stock price has been good the last 5 years, but still needs more volume to justify a high price as well as consistent earnings to keep this baby above $200 per share.",

AMZN which is one of the biggest cloud providers have completely standardized on CSCO.\n\nArista unlike CSCO with Webex does not have a WFH story yet. They have been trying to move into Enterprise with a few WiFi acquisitions, but so is everybody else and CSCO is still holding strong.\n\nThey are also completely dependent on BRCM for ASICs, hence not able to increase product margins. Unless they give up their strategy of not making ASICs they can't really bring feature distinction to the market. Also with CSCO selling its ASICs to MSFT directly, things will be tougher for BRCM and Arista.\n\nDon't get me wrong, it is a very good and very well run company, but there will be short term pain for Arista and long term may be good if they are able to beat Cisco on the WiFi side, which is very difficult as of now.",

Arista's Linux-based EOS is compatible with its entire product line, and that it is fully programmable such that others are able to write their own software that works with the EOS. This makes it far easier for companies who wish to plug into Arista's EOS. Cisco, on the other hand, does not seem as prominent in this regards.",

With controllers it does not matter what Software runs on the devices and CSCO has two of them one for Data Centre (ACI) and one for enterprise (DNAC), they are working on merging them now.\n\nArista needs to get their story going for Hybrid Cloud, SD-WAN, IoT and 5G which will be the next high growth areas for Network Infra providers. They still don't have enterprise grade security such as Identity services etc. so breaking into Enterprise is tough for them as of now.\n\nAll the big cloud providers have moved to Dis-aggregated model for network devices (opencompute.org) which means they dont care who provides the hardware as long as the hardware support certain common APIs.",

        "body": "&gt;Here\u2019s the problem. Zoom provides nothing that\u2019s not hard to replicate.\n\nI disagree with that.\n\nIf you look at their position before coronavirus, Zoom was [gaining significant share because it's a superior product](https://www.ciodive.com/news/zooms-rise-carving-market-share-from-microsoft-cisco/560526/).\n\nAlthough video conferencing seems like a commodity that anyone can offer, Zoom does have a superior underlying architecture because it was built to be cloud-native and video-first and built by a team with significant domain expertise.\n\nFor very large enterprises this translates into better quality of service and greater bandwidth efficiency. For day-to-day use it's one of the reasons they can show 49 video streams in a 7x7 matrix which is significantly more than others (Webex 25, BlueJeans 9, Teams 4).\n\nHere's a [blog post](https://blog.zoom.us/wordpress/2019/06/26/zoom-can-provide-increase-industry-leading-video-capacity/) and a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BMbsFqtD0A) that talks a little about their architecture.\n\nIt reminds me a lot of Google's hardware advantage in the early days where they built their own operating system that ran on commodity hardware which gave them a cost-per-search advantage over all competitors. More recently it reminds me of Arista Networks building a modern OS for their switches which have let them continue to gain share against Cisco in datacentres. Zoom will be no different -- they were gaining share before, they'll continue gaining share because their product is superior in a way that others can't easily compete against without changing the fundamentals of how they work.\n\nI am talking enterprise use though. If you're chatting with some friends then Zoom vs Hangouts vs FaceTime etc are pretty commoditised.\n\nSo how does the world look for Zoom going forward? In the space of 3 months they've gone from a leading enterprise app to a household brand. Every business will be considering video conferencing option, and post-coronavirus more businesses will be offering flexible work arrangements which will accelerate the structural growth of video conferencing adoption.\n\nThe fact that Zoom increased their userbase by 20x in 3 months is extraordinary, even if many are free, as that branding and recognition is valuable. The only reason the stock isn't up significantly more is because of security concerns, but as I said before I think they're overblown, and all the third party endorsements I'd say confirm that. At the end of their 90 day security focus they're likely to emerge as the most secure platform out there and will dominate this space.",
