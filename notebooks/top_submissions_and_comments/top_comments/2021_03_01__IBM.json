        "body": "IBM generates plenty of cash to cover its high dividend as well as share buy backs. What does that have to do with their ability to be competitive in the market? Free cash flow yield is a completely different metric, and it returns more value to shareholders for a company that is stagnating or declining. It's perfectly reasonable for them to buy back shares instead of sit on cash. I would prefer to hold a company like this than one that continually is able to be 'competitive in the market' but doesn't generate any cash so it has to issue shares year-over-year in order to supplement it's growth",
