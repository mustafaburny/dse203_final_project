I would say it doesn't actually fall under most current anti-trust legislation which is related to price competition and its revenue area is actually advertising where there is lots of competition BUT I agree that practically it is enough of a monopoly that it will likely get dragged into it.  I sold my Google and FB a few months ago, both just to take profits and because I think there's a solid chance they spend the next 2-4 years in continuous litigation and hearings over how to manage data more responsibly and how they should be regulated.  Doubt anyone can agree to anything, but it will put a damper on their acquisition and expansion sprees.\n\nAmazon is a very different case as Amazon isn't really a monopoly in any way, they just compete in SO MANY categories that it feels that way.  But when you look at it...in e-commerce, its hard to call someone a monopoly when Walmart, Target, Costco Best Buy and every other big box compete with them; AWS is fighting tooth and nail with Microsoft Azure, Google could, IBM, Oracle etc.; \n\nWe can keep going down the list - Prime video competes with Netflix and Hulu; Amazon logistics competes with UPS and Fedex and Uber Cargo...so while their everpresence in our lives makes it feel like it MUST be a monopoly, its actually hard to identify anywhere specifically that Amazon isn't subject to pretty intense competition by big players, thus hard to make a case for anti-competitive behavior or anti-trust violations.",

        "body": "Warren's philosophy revolves around value investing and buying what you know. Warren doesn't know tech, and he knows that he doesn't.\n\nInvesting is all about risk management; how much risk are you taking on for a realistic reward? What happens if you lose a large portion of your money? I personally don't want to spend an extra five to ten years not retired because of a stupid mistake trying to double my money.\n\nIt's not as simple as buying Apple or Microsoft and earning 30% average per year. There were many years where they traded sideways or downwards. Look at Microsoft from 2001 to 2014. Thirteen years of doodoo in terms of equity appreciation. It can happen again.\n\nMany of the companies you see popularized today will not be around in 5 to 10 years. For some reason it is popular to lose money and then try to go public.\n\nI wouldn't hesitate to call myself a value investor. One of my \"top\" holdings is eBay. I don't expect for eBay to 10x overnight, but I do believe that it is fundamentally undervalued, and that it is an e-commerce/tech company that pays a dividend. I'll probably still be holding this company in 10 years, and my dividend yield on cost should be pretty juicy at that point, so long as they continue to up the dividend. eBay is also relatively recession proof, as people will continue to buy and sell on their platform no matter what the economy looks like, which brings risk down.\n\nI'm long MSFT, AAPL and EBAY.\n\nThe price of the larger companies you mentioned has a lot to do with how much money they are making. IBM is still a fantastic company, but they don't raise their earnings by much. They have quite a bit of debt based on a quick look at finviz, and their dividend payout ratio looks like it is 103%, which is a little \"uh-oh\", as it means they are paying out more than they can afford to, putting their dividend at risk.\n\nThere are lots of value plays out there. I think Utz is a good value. WMT or TGT are arguably value companies.\n\n\nSorry for the rambling; hope any of this helps!",

The 2-qubit gate fidelity is the most relevant system parameter for systems today (it determines to a large degree the quantum circuit complexity that can be run), along with the number of qubits.  The Google Sycamore device has a 2-qubit gate fidelity of \\~0.994, and that was a device developed in 2019.  It is not clear if they have anything better at this point, as most of their recent publications rely on Sycamore.\n\nIonQ seems to claim to have a 32 qubit system that has a 2-qubit fidelity of 0.999, but they have not published data showing that.  I believe the 32 qubits.  My guess is that it is not quite that good yet on gate fidelity, otherwise they would have published.  Honeywell has shown data indicating their system is currently capable of 0.995-0.998.  I expect IonQ is similar at this point.\n\nYou can dismiss IBM, but they have a lot of excellent people working on hardware and algorithms.  I think they are probably behind Google at the moment on superconducting, but it would be wrong to dismiss them at this point.  \n\nBut honestly, what all these companies have right now is not really all that important in terms of what company may \"win\" the race.",

Economic growth is good for Ford but it's going to be good for QCOM as well and SWKS and those companies have monster margins. And that is not considering the still coming 5G cycle and Semi chips going into everything.  The shortage is good for semi companies margins where they have a production pipeline.   \n\nExample: SWKS earned 3.36 last quarter.  With semi shortage and seeing as they are the only company that produces their own chips, they are selling out at prices set by them.  If, if SKWS maintains that earnings momentum and pulls out 12-14$ in 2021, the stock is selling for 12-15 earnings.  That does not look bad with their growth numbers in a supercycle economic boom compared to Banks at 12x earnings  \n\nSWKS is just an example but you get the picture.  If value keeps outpacing Tech, we will be looking at value fully valued and tech, with still higher growth, undervalued. \n\nFirst quarter earnings report could bring suprises and, finally, good guidance.  If things get cheaper or even bottom here, that sets up for a major rally post earnings, sometime in April.  \n\nStrat your shopping list now and average in, that my couch potato advice. \n\ndisclosure: I am long SWKS, QCOM and IBM and Apple Calls in TEch.",

Last few years, the dividends collected has been 20K in 2018, 25k in 2019, 31K in 2020 (a couple cuts like DIS and SLB), expecting this year to be around 35K+. Regrets? I have none. I think I've done decently well and this approach has gotten me thru 2 recessions now so I feel somewhat comfortable with it.\n\nI read some of the comments here and what I would caution people on is putting too much emphasis on classic high yield areas like utilities, REITs, or certain energy plays. These areas may look attractive from a current yield perspective but they typically come with drawbacks that are not immediately evident to newbie dividend investors. \n\n* Utilities for example carry very high debt loads and typically grow the dividend very slowly, and the debt can be a problem in certain scenarios.\n* REITs like utilities also don't grow their dividend at very high natural rates and like MLPs rely on access to capital markets to grow assets and payout since they don't retain much earnings. This can pose a risk in certain market conditions and affect long term dividend growth profile/risk\n* High yielding energy plays are almost always dividend traps due to the cyclicality of the industry, except pipelines and major integrated companies. But never say never, as even companies like Exxon and Chevron are struggling to cover the dividend these days organically\n\n\n\nIf you're young, I would highly suggest limiting exposure to the higher yielding but slower growing areas to a smaller portion of a dividend portfolio. There is definitely room in a portfolio for stuff like that, but the sweet spot for this approach is the 3-5% yielding stuff capable of sustainably growing the dividend at 6-7% annually, or the 1-2% yielding stuff capable of sustaining 10-15% annual dividend growth. \n\nHere's what my portfolio looks like (first 1-2 are core positions)\n\n* Telco/Utilities: AT&amp;T, H, RCI.B\n* Staples: KO, PM, MO, HSY\n* Healthcare: JNJ, AMGN, UNH\n* Industrials: CNR, MMM, GD\n* Energy: XOM, ENB, KMI, TRP, SLB\n* Discretionary: NKE, DIS\n* Tech: V, IBM\n* Financials: TD, BNS, USB",

I see a lot of value coming up in tech when this drops off. I think semiconductor companies ($TI, $CREE, $On) might have some higher value coming up.
