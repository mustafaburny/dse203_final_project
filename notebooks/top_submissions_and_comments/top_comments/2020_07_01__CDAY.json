Lots of stores do online shopping and delivery these days.  [Jet.com](https://Jet.com) was a thing.\n\nOracle, Azure, Google all have AWS competitors.\n\nNFLX, Disney+, et al for video streaming.\n\nAmazon isn't getting big via acquisitions of its competitors, either.  There's no antitrust discussion like there would be if ATT tried to buy Verizon, for example.\n\nI think AMZN is safe from any kind of antitrust lawsuit.

If a company is very difficult to replace their business with, then that is a moat.

Are consumers becoming almost forced to use their business because they are so widely accepted? If so, this is a moat.\n\nCost Advantages (Non scale and Scale) - Does the company have access to tech that makes production cheaper or the cheapest available? Is there scale so massive competition can\u2019t move in? Are they able to keep their prices low through other means? If so, this is a moat.\n\nHope this helps!",

        "body": "I'm not per se. I hold all of ARKW/F/G/K with heavier weighting toward K. The reasoning for this is I feel as though K has a lot of room to really explode as it is really speculative. Thats similar to WCLD and SKYY, in my opinion. I'm going to do a lot of writing about the subject but the TLDR is: buy them all. They're all uniquely positioned and have very different holdings. The ARK funds are huge spec plays that I really believe in, while WCLD/SKYY/CLOU are all cloud computing ETFs with really diversified holdings I also believe in. \n\nARKW is the next gen internet ARK fund which sounds really speculative but it really just holds Tesla, Square, FB, Roku &amp; Splunk, among others. Compared to WCLD which holds NET, FSLY, SHOP, TWLO, COUP, ZM, DDOG, etc. If you just compare the two holdings and let SHOP &amp; TESLA both cancel each other out (huge run ups the last few months) - I consider NET, FSLY (huge boom recently), TWLO, COUP, ZM (Obviously huge boom), DDOG, COUP, Etcetera to have WAY more room to grow than Roku, Square (which I consider overvalued personally), Zillow, pinterest, etcetera. Basically, WCLD is just much more future-focused, in my opinion. NET, FSLY, DDOG and TWLO alone are going to be monsters. \n\nCLOU, on the other hand, I consider much closer to ARKW in growth potential. Their holdings to me are largely slow &amp; steady, whereas WCLD has potential to absolutely jet. \n\nI personally really like SKYY as well. Its basically a mini QQQ it has a TON of bluechips. BABA, AMZN, MSFT, SHOP, ORCL, &amp; GOOGL - not to mention FSLY. If you want slow and steady, hold for years - I think this is your play. \n\nNow comparing the three, SKYY has a 0.6% E/R, while CLOU is 0.68%, and WCLD is 0.45%. The ARK funds are all around 0.75% E/R which is significantly higher than WCLD. So again it comes down to your belief in the individual holdings of each ETF. I have all 3 and I weight WCLD and SKYY higher than CLOU because I believe in their holdings more. \n\nThe ARK funds are all very very different. I know each pretty much all holds 10% TSLA but beyond that they're much more specific sector ETFs, and I think worthwhile to hold all of them. ARKW is the next gen internet, while G is genomic revolution (heavy biotech spec plays and like 97% of its holding are in 'Healthcare'). Where this differs from traditional biotech plays, is that it is banking on genomic healthcare as the wave of the future - and I agree. In a similar sense, the ARKQ is the same but for robotics and autonomous tech. If you look at why TSLA is so booming compared to other EVs, one of the main reasons is their huge advancements in autonomous vehicles. Especially in the wake of Covid, we can easily chart point A to B of autonomous tech and robotics taking over as the future of retail. AMZN is pushing hard on that front, which should tell you just about everything you need to know about ARKQ's value. ARKF is the fintech etf, basically banking on online retail and money management. Obviously they hold SQ, but they also hold APPL, PDD (huge runner, imo), MELI (gigantic), TCEHY (huge), and PYPL. Again, under the \"new normal\" its very easy to see the value of fintech. There's a reason ARKF, ARKQ, and ARKG have all run up massively since the covid dip. \n\nThen there's ARKK which is their 'innovation' fund. Its heavily diversified - much more than the others, and sort of is a 'best of' their other funds. If you have to pick one ETF I would recommend this one. \n\nNow all that is to say: ARKW is okay but maybe consider these other options instead. Of the listed ETFs I would rank it second to last just above CLOU.",

I appreciate that the technical reality has little bearing on how high the stock will go, but saying AMZN is a safe place to park your money is kind of like saying IBM is as well because \"nobody ever got fired for buying IBM\".  Like that phrase rested on it's laurels for a long ass time, and AWS' time will come too.\n\nAlmost every new feature they release is delayed, comes out with bugs, the amount of effort they actually ask their customers to put in to developing working solutions that integrate their services together in to something valuable is high.\n\nThe total cost of ownership angle, once you get past the strippers and steaks pitch to your management, is far less compelling than they would like you to believe.  In some cases Amazon will charge you what an FTE salary would be for something that could be accomplished with a pair of $15 servers and still leaves you with half the operations concerns - then tell you gee aren't you glad it's semi-managed? AWS likes to bring up the Dynamo paper as if that's not like Al Bundy's four touchdowns in one game.\n\nAzure, Oracle Cloud or Google Cloud have (Spanner, CosmosDB, and so on) offerings that beat the pants off of RDS.\n\nOn the frontier, AWS' serverless approach is woefully inadequate and only really offsets a portion of the devops overhead and only integrates 'loosely' with a lot of their services.  Okay, I've already typed way more than you care about, but my point is while I would never say short AMZN because who knows how long they'll run for, and with COVID, it will be interesting to see what impact a lack of re:Invent will have once their fans stop getting treated to outlandish parties, I'd be cautious about treating it like some safe haven. They are also notoriously high-stress, high-turnover, and I think that negatively impacts their ability to attract the talent needed to elevate their platform or keep it in league.",

ML provides a fair starting point, but I need to use several other resources to get the big picture that I'm looking for.  I'm especially disappointed in their lack of tracking with dividend suspensions.  I use Finviz for dividend info.  ML has amazing customer service though.  I called to ask about some of their paid services and they talked me out of it.  What company talks people out of giving them more money?  The kind that cares more about quality customer service than a few bucks.  \n\nWhat I like about Snowflake:\n- I'm still learning about Cloud Computing and Data Warehousing, but they seem to be doing a good job and be in a competitive position in this area.  From what I can tell, they call their customers partners.  Partners include AWS, MS Azure, Google Cloud, Salesforce, and more.  I could be wrong about the partner vs customer terms, but I do know that they really work with this companies to some capacity.  I didn't see a customer count on their website, but I saw an article that says Snowflake has over 3,500 customers that include Netflix, Yamaha, Lululemon, and some universities.\n- Their website is clean and easy to navigate.  They offer free demos, 30 day free trials, and training labs.  Starting up with them is supposed to be as easy as filling out a single form.  They charge by usage, not subscription.  Supposedly this is the same model Twilio uses.  All of these things are good for customers.\n- Website also acknowledges that sometimes partners can also be competitors and has a Standards of Conduct Guide that tries to address it.  They also post their Code of Conduct.  Both documents say things in a general, common sense way.  But I appreciate that they publicly address it and have a baseline.\n- The platform they use is theirs, as in they built it.  I like that they own their product.\n- $100M revenue in 2019 - 174% increase (from various articles)\n- Valuation in Feb 2020 was $12.8B (from various articles)\n- Founders come from Oracle, IBM and Alphabet.  \n- Current CEO, Frank Slootman, has a good track record.  Was previously the CEO of ServiceNow.  Took them from $100M revenue to $1.4B revenue (refer back to Snowflake's 2019 revenue for significance).  CEO also ran Data Domain and sold that for $2.4B.  \n- I've seen a variety of good customer comments and reviews across different sources.  Customers don't really seem to express negativity, it's more that there is an option or function that they want and isn't currently available.  Everyone seems to be happy with the service that is provided.\n- Employees on Glassdoor seem to believe in the product.  Complaints are either sales members who are struggling or people who aren't comfortable in competitive and fast growing company.  Regarding sales - there are also good reviews from that department who say it's a good company that needs minor improvements.  I don't have a Glassdoor subscription so I could only see what was free to access, but their overall rating is 4 stars.\n\nOverall they just seem like a good company with a good product.",

        "body": "I would be more concerned with people eventually catching on that AWS is the General Motors of the cloud and that most of their competitors, even Oracle, have product offerings that run circles around them.  I appreciate that the technical reality has little bearing on how high the stock will go, but saying AMZN is a safe place to park your money is kind of like saying IBM is as well because \"nobody ever got fired for buying IBM\".  Like that phrase rested on it's laurels for a long ass time, and AWS' time will come too.\n\nAlmost every new feature they release is delayed, comes out with bugs, the amount of effort they actually ask their customers to put in to developing working solutions that integrate their services together in to something valuable is high.\n\nThe total cost of ownership angle, once you get past the strippers and steaks pitch to your management, is far less compelling than they would like you to believe.  In some cases Amazon will charge you what an FTE salary would be for something that could be accomplished with a pair of $15 servers and still leaves you with half the operations concerns - then tell you gee aren't you glad it's semi-managed? AWS likes to bring up the Dynamo paper as if that's not like Al Bundy's four touchdowns in one game.\n\nAzure, Oracle Cloud or Google Cloud have (Spanner, CosmosDB, and so on) offerings that beat the pants off of RDS.\n\nOn the frontier, AWS' serverless approach is woefully inadequate and only really offsets a portion of the devops overhead and only integrates 'loosely' with a lot of their services.  Okay, I've already typed way more than you care about, but my point is while I would never say short AMZN because who knows how long they'll run for, and with COVID, it will be interesting to see what impact a lack of re:Invent will have once their fans stop getting treated to outlandish parties, I'd be cautious about treating it like some safe haven. They are also notoriously high-stress, high-turnover, and I think that negatively impacts their ability to attract the talent needed to elevate their platform or keep it in league.",
