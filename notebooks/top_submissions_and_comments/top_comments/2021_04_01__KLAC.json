        "body": "Your analysis is probably true for delta, but the problem with playing those names using vol is that the IV is higher. Options trading is most useful when you get the gamma cheap while also calling the direction right.\n\nI'm buying INTC 23Apr 70c because resistance at 65 has kept IV muted. My bet is that INTC will break through that resistance on 6Apr or 23Apr. I hate talking in terms of resistance in general, but looking at the long-term chart as well as price action in the morning after the Intel Unleashed event, it certainly seems like you'd need a big catalyst to justify a breakout beyond 65. I'd probably play those profits -- if any -- into AMD puts through to May, because I think hedge fund selling will take place when Lisa Su inevitably acknowledges the incorrectness of her prediction that supply \"tightness\" would clear up by 2H21.\n\nI also believe that the Archegos liquidation is another sign that correlated hedge fund losses will spell disaster for the market. We saw this already with GME and the other short-squeeze names. Chipmakers like to lay out their capex as close to production ramp-up as possible, which means that LRCX/AMAT/ASML/KLIC/KLAC/CAJ/etc won't book profits immediately even if billions of dollars are allocated to the roadmap. So I'm waiting for a big selloff this summer to get into those names as a long-term position. May try to play that selloff using hedgie favorites and names that have a lot of room to fall. ARKK, TSLA, TSM, NVDA come to mind. TSM seems counterintuitive but you get the added potential catalyst of Chinese brinkmanship as well as a deepening of the water supply woes.\n\nI mention CAJ because it gives a good read on DUV demand. Their equipment segment had a lot of profit growth last quarter. But it's not as good a play as the others because only a fifth of its revenue comes from that segment.",

        "body": "Your analysis is probably true for delta, but the problem with playing those names using vol is that the IV is higher. Options trading is most useful when you get the gamma cheap while also calling the direction right.\n\nI'm buying INTC 23Apr 70c because resistance at 65 has kept IV muted. My bet is that INTC will break through that resistance on 6Apr or 23Apr. I hate talking in terms of resistance in general, but looking at the long-term chart as well as price action in the morning after the Intel Unleashed event, it certainly seems like you'd need a big catalyst to justify a breakout beyond 65. I'd probably play those profits -- if any -- into AMD puts through to May, because I think hedge fund selling will take place when Lisa Su inevitably acknowledges the incorrectness of her prediction that supply \"tightness\" would clear up by 2H21.\n\nI also believe that the Archegos liquidation is another sign that correlated hedge fund losses will spell disaster for the market. We saw this already with GME and the other short-squeeze names. Chipmakers like to lay out their capex as close to production ramp-up as possible, which means that LRCX/AMAT/ASML/KLIC/KLAC/CAJ/etc won't book profits immediately even if billions of dollars are allocated to the roadmap. So I'm waiting for a big selloff this summer to get into those names as a long-term position. May try to play that selloff using hedgie favorites and names that have a lot of room to fall. ARKK, TSLA, TSM, NVDA come to mind. TSM seems counterintuitive but you get the added potential catalyst of Chinese brinkmanship as well as a deepening of the water supply woes.\n\nI mention CAJ because it gives a good read on DUV demand. Their equipment segment had a lot of profit growth last quarter. But it's not as good a play as the others because only a fifth of its revenue comes from that segment.",
