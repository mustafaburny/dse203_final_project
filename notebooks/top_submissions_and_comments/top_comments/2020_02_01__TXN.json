        "body": "Yea that's right, I think MMs must've initially put in a later earnings date based on history and then when ROKU announced an earlier date, a lot of them were screwed.  And it's a lot more costly to be wrong in ROKU since it actually moves a lot for earnings so the earnings implied vol is quite high and costly to be short vol a week in which you thought had 0% chance to be earnings but turned out to be the earnings week.\n\nAMZN is very consistent and a lot of names are, but a lot aren't.  Even a stock like GOOG is kind of inconsistent (when they announce and also the date they announce it for).  A lot of times, it's a guessing game, so you'll see MM split their probability like 60% vs. 40% on two weeks.\n\nThe question you are asking on when an earnings date is announced kind of just comes from experience and since most traders have only like 4-5 names they look at, they have a general sense.  Like I don't really trade TSLA, but I wanted to look at it just for fun with the recent news, and I noticed they sometimes announce an earnings date on Friday NIGHT even (after market is closed) for a date that is less than 2 weeks away (happened this year).  So you kind of just have to know based on each stock you trade from experience and assign probabiltiies.  For like AMZN, you should almost know 100% since they are just way too consistent.  If AMZN earnings is not on a Thursday and not announced 2 weeks before, that's probably not good lol.\n\nFor your LRCX example, I would imagine the primary MM trading at these large firms only trade like LRCX, TXN, AMAT, TSM, or something like that and work closely with the AMD, NVDA trader and the SMH ETF trader, so they have it all covered.  Because not only do you want to know LRCX's earnings date/earning's timing, but it helps knowing when NVDA's earnings are since NVDA's large enough earnings could move the entire semi-sector.  So it's just they have so few names to cover, they have enough experience to kind of at least get a solid sense of it but not 100% of course unless it's something like AMZN.  Finally, the LRCX trader has access to order flow (retail vs. \"smarter\" hedge funds) which can also help them assign their probabiltiies better.",

My personal opinion is have about 70% of my portfolio in stuff like Coke, McDonalds, Visa, Microsoft, maybe a good utility that has a healthy dividend record (ED and SO are mine). I think McCormick and Smuckers are some other good ones although i haven't bought either yet. I think Johnson and Johnson is a good one too. I've done quite well with that last one. Proctor and Gamble also.\n\nThink about it...people always going to have babies, eat, drink, take a dump, etc. Who makes most of the stuff that covers those needs? Also credit card companies. how many people do you know who dont use a credit card?\n\nNow for the other 30%, I have stuff that is a little more risky. Thats where your Tesla's and Nvidia's come in. I've always heard that computer chips are cyclical so be ready for that with Nvidia in my opinion. Also for the electronics/internet...look at FTEC. I think they are going to blow up in the next few years...it's a still-cheap QQQ in my opinion.\n\nIf you have 15 years to retirement or more, Tesla and Nvidia are good. In the electronics area, I think you'd like Texas Instruments stock also. Very good track record there.\n\nlike i said, this is just what i think and what i have done in the past. it's worked out for me but i have stayed in the market a long time. don't expect to get rich over night. with this stuff you won't go broke over night either.\n\nalso, i dont pull out everything every time the market tanks....i buy more.\n\nedit: spelling",
