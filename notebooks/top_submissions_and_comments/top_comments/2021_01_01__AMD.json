Share by share, dollar by dollar, until we\u2019re finished. We are in it right now. And we can get the shit kicked out of us, or we can fight back. One trade at a time. Now I can\u2019t do it for you. I\u2019m too poor. I look around and I see all these autist, and I think, I made every wrong move a trader can make, I said Tesla can\u2019t go any higher, believe it or not, that AMD was going out of business, and lately I sold GME at $30. When you get poor in trading, things get taken from you, you know but that\u2019s trading. But you only learn that when you start losing trades. You find out that trading is a game of shares. The margin for error is so small, I mean one hour to early or too late and you miss it, one second to fast or too slow and you don\u2019t quite hit it. The shares we need are everywhere around us. They are in every day, every minute, every second of trading. On this sub-Reddit we fight for those shares. On this sub-Reddit we tear ourselves and everyone around us to pieces for that share. We claw for that share. Because we know when we add up all those shares, that\u2019s going to make the fucking difference between taking down these Wall Street assholes and losing. Between living and dying. I\u2019ll tell you this, in any fight it\u2019s the guy who\u2019s willing to die who is going to win that share. And I know if I\u2019m going to have any life anymore it\u2019s because I\u2019m still willing to die for that share, because that\u2019s what living is. The ten shares in front of your face. Now I can\u2019t make you do it, you\u2019ve got to look at the autist next to you, look into his eyes. Now I think you are going to see a guy who willing to give it everything for that share with you. You\u2019re going to see a guy who\u2019s willing to sacrifice themself for this sub-Reddit because he knows when it comes down to it you\u2019re going to do the same for him. Either we get ready now, as a team, or we die as individuals. That\u2019s trading guys. That\u2019s all it is.\n\nNow what are you gonna do?",

        "body": "Market cap is a seriously terrible metric to look at here. That measures the 'size' of a single corporate entity, not an industry. Also, I think you are misinterpreting 'giant multinational corporations' as belonging to a specific country. That just isn't true. Microsoft and Google for example are headquartered in the US but have employees all over the world. \n\n\\- Canada actually does make cars there are a handful of major manufacturing plants in Ontario. There are also automotive research and design offices. Yes, the companies are headquartered in the US, but that doesn't mean they have no Canadian content. \n\n\\- Canada has a number of hardware companies. ATI which used to design graphics cards was Canadian until it got purchased by AMD. They still have offices in Canada and the graphics cards are competitive with the best made anywhere. I don't think any of the GPU manufacturing is actually in Canada, but lots of the R&amp;D is done here. \n\n\\- Canada does have a significant pharmaceutical industry, it is just small compared to the US where profits can be many times higher due to the high per-person healthcare spending in the US.  Often times viable products designed in Canada get purchased by larger American companies before they reach consumers so you don't realize the Canadian connection. Canada also has facilities to make vaccines, they just don't happen to be compatible with the new type of vaccine being used for COVID (mRNA). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere have been some notable Canadian tech failures. Nortel for example was the world leader in advanced telecommunications technology. Unfortunately, it fell victim to a combination of incompetent management and corporate espionage where it had its designs stolen from competitors. BlackBerry is a bit similar in that it completely DOMINATED the world's smartphone market for well over a decade before Apple disrupted the market with the first-gen iPhone. The smartphone market eventually saw everyone else either make android phones or sell off the cellphone business. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCanadian companies often sell out to large multinational companies. They just have the resources such that it doesn't make sense for someone small to compete against them, it's better to join them.",

There is no next GME. I like GME. I'm not selling till 10k. Or I may never sell. Only paper handed bitches sell at 1k\n\nBut like real talk AMC SEEMS LIKE A FUCKING TRAP. Its only got 60% of shares shorted. There are like 10 stocks with around 50-60% of shares shorted - Why not them? There is nothing to differentiate AMC.

They\u2019re quietly positioning themselves on a foundation made of damn gold. Not to mention Papa Chen has turned this company around in what 7 years only? Give him a little more time and he will be our next meme lord aka Elon Musk. \n\nSay what you want about their marketing and lack of PR tactics, but I respect the company even more as they don\u2019t care about exposure atm and are focused on laying a foundation to successfully pivot into EV and cyber security. Which they have been doing successfully... Cylance acquisition was also huge. \n\nPlease do your damn dd. I haven\u2019t been this confident in a growth stock in awhile. Sure, I\u2019m biased since I\u2019ve had a position in them for awhile, but your DD will give you conviction as did mine. \n\nAlso, it is absolutely not ridiculous to compare BB to AMD growth in the short/medium term, or even Tesla.

The short sellers, however, ignored some fundamental catalysts like the new console cycle and that ps5 and xbox one would work with game disks (correct me if I'm wrong here).\n\n- They also ignored the fact that GME's online sales had gone up quite significantly. All of this led some redditors early in the game to believe that this was a company that would not go bankrupt. They then had a deal with Microsoft which pumped the stock higher.\n\n- Enter Ryan Cohen. The founder of Chewy ($CHWY) saw the potential in GME and wrote an angry letter imploring them to find better ways of leveraging their popularity and shifting their business online. He has since upped his investment and has more comrades on board.\n\n- All of the above meant that GME was priced very low and was actually a value investment because of the good things coming up for this company. Institutions and retail investors started buying this stock and it kept going up.\n\n- There is evidence that the short sellers kept increasing their position hoping for a reversal that never came. Now their brokers are restricting short selling for GME and as the stock pumps higher, they are closer and closer to getting margin called.\n\n- When that happens, they will be forced to close their positions and buy shares. Creating a short squeeze. The catch here is that there are not enough shares available to buy and close their positions. Essentially, they would have to buy it from insiders or institutions who will most probably not be willing to sell their stake.\n\n- The above would create an infinite short squeeze which would make us all very rich if we could time our exit. \n\nSomeone from r/wallstreetbets correct me if I missed anything.

Also, I think you are misinterpreting 'giant multinational corporations' as belonging to a specific country. That just isn't true. Microsoft and Google for example are headquartered in the US but have employees all over the world. \n\n\\- Canada actually does make cars there are a handful of major manufacturing plants in Ontario. There are also automotive research and design offices. Yes, the companies are headquartered in the US, but that doesn't mean they have no Canadian content. \n\n\\- Canada has a number of hardware companies. ATI which used to design graphics cards was Canadian until it got purchased by AMD. They still have offices in Canada and the graphics cards are competitive with the best made anywhere. I don't think any of the GPU manufacturing is actually in Canada, but lots of the R&amp;D is done here. \n\n\\- Canada does have a significant pharmaceutical industry, it is just small compared to the US where profits can be many times higher due to the high per-person healthcare spending in the US.  Often times viable products designed in Canada get purchased by larger American companies before they reach consumers so you don't realize the Canadian connection. Canada also has facilities to make vaccines, they just don't happen to be compatible with the new type of vaccine being used for COVID (mRNA). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere have been some notable Canadian tech failures. Nortel for example was the world leader in advanced telecommunications technology. Unfortunately, it fell victim to a combination of incompetent management and corporate espionage where it had its designs stolen from competitors. BlackBerry is a bit similar in that it completely DOMINATED the world's smartphone market for well over a decade before Apple disrupted the market with the first-gen iPhone. The smartphone market eventually saw everyone else either make android phones or sell off the cellphone business. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCanadian companies often sell out to large multinational companies. They just have the resources such that it doesn't make sense for someone small to compete against them, it's better to join them.",

I have no idea what they have thought up for the future but we do have a glimpse of it and to me it seems like a great business model. People don't want to stop going to retail stores, it's just right now they have to, retail stores aside though their e-commerce sales this year went up some 800%. That's no joke and it appears they are currently redoing their online presence as well. My guess is they are going to make it feel VERY nice to use their website and I would imagine there will be perks involved also. \n\nhttps://news.microsoft.com/2020/10/08/gamestop-announces-multiyear-strategic-partnership-with-microsoft/\n\nThis is almost all I need to be on board long term. This is huge. \n\nAlso they are about to open PC stores is building stations. That is huge also. PC gaming is BLOWING up rn. I would be they have something in the works to be able to deliver very nice PCs for a very nice price. The competition for retail PC gaming would be low. Around me there's microcenter but they only have so many stores, i think less than 10. So the next one is best buy, but they barely carry gaming pc parts. It's mainly office computers and printers, boomer shit. Yeah you can get stuff online and delivered to your house. I personally am the guy who buys all the shit online and picks up at the store in case I need something extra or have questions. The idea of gamestop having all of this stuff and probably a pc specialist to help with builds is a huge green light. Imagine all the people that go home and build their pc alone with a youtube vid up would be replaced by just going in and building it with someone at gamestop (not sure if that's the plan but maybe?). \n\nAs far as the online goes, again their e-commerce went up 800% and now they have a possible ceo who grew a HUGE online brand and obviously knows that market well. Gamestop already has the branding they just need to convince people to switch to using them for their gaming needs which personally I'm going to put my money where my mouth is and start getting what I need from gamestop when I can. \n\nLots of it also comes down to just believing in RC. Which I have decided after his recent tweets I do. He wants this shit to work, and he turned millions into billions once already. Imagine what he can do with an already established gamestop. I honestly believe all it needs is the new ideas and outlook he and his buddies will bring to completely turn the company around. \n\nI'd love to see a fucking squeeze I'm the next week or so because my investment is pretty small. If there is a squeeze, my plan is reinvest all my profits back into gamestop after the price goes way down again or stabilizes to hold long term and then put my initial investment into bb immediately. Here's to hoping.",

Now that I know they have agreements with Microsoft and Sony in place for a cut of digital revenue I would hope that one of the income streams they look to is making their buy-back program digital. Something like  we hand in the game, we can get credit towards another. It would make me consider using whatever platform GME comes up with instead of Steam.

Open source software will always have more known vulnerabilities because the code base is easily viewed.  Many people with diverse engineering backgrounds can view that code.  This leads to more vulnerabilities being found, but also to more of those vulnerabilities being fixed, and fixed faster than closed source operating systems.\n\nThere\u2019s a reason why Black Hat hackers love to take advantage of organizations that use windows.  It\u2019s not that Linux is impossible to hack but exploiting windows is easier by an order of magnitude.  Those people that hack for profit usually take the path of least resistance to profit.\n\nAs of macOS Catalina Apple removed all old NeXTSTEP(based on BSD Unix 4.4) code and the OS is now entirely based on FreeBSD Unix with some Apple custom written code on top of it.\n\nFreeBSD is an entirely open source operating system.  It has many contributors but not as many as Linux and is not as popular, it is still considered more secure by miles than the windows kernel.\n\nWindows makes some very stupid architectural decisions when it comes to security.  Couple that with the performance of the windows kernel  vs the Linux kernel and you now know why most cloud providers exclusively offer Linux.\n\nMicrosoft relies on \u201ccapturing\u201d your business and making it difficult to use other technologies as integrating with a Microsoft ecosystem is more opaque than say integrating Linux systems with FreeBSD.  Hell even the majority of Azure Cloud instances are running some kind of linux.\n\nIntegration is the name of the game in tech the tech world at the moment.  Any company not moving to the cloud and away from Microsoft is frankly behind the curve.\n\nHow does this relate to blackberry?  Blackberry devices use two operating systems Blackberry 10 and Android.  Blackberry 10 Based on QNX shown in this chart had its last release three years ago in April and the company has moved to android as of 2019.  Like Microsoft and their Azure Cloud Platform  Blackberry sees that custom homegrown closed source operating systems are dying.  I have a feeling that before the end of the decade Microsoft Windows will either be defunct or will no longer use the closed source NT kernel and be a distribution of Linux or based on some kind of Unix.\n\nTech companies are seeing the writing on the wall folks the open source operating system revolution isn\u2019t just a passing fad but a trend that\u2019s been on the rise for years.  Don\u2019t bet on the losers folks, bet on where the tech industry is innovating, open source software and platforms.\n\nAnyone telling you to buy BB based on Blackberry QNX is either ignorant to the latest trends in tech or are trying to pump the stock and make money off your ignorance.",

This is wrong in many ways. The plan isnt to keep selling games, but somehow do it online, and thus stay in bussiness. The plan is to switch focus to becoming a cultural center for everything gaming. The one stop for gaming, a game stop if you will. Imagine stores filled with PC parts and accecories, gaming collectibles, esports events and an internet cafe section with cunning employees who can help you with anything computer or gaming related. All these items are high-margin items in a market that is growing by over 10% yoy with some projections showing future growth to be even higher. Heck even today 1/6th of Gamestops revenue, about 1 billion dollars, already comes from collectibles and that stuff is high margin af. Over 33% of revenue comes from online sales and their website is shit. Imagine if you had people who were actually cunning in e-commerce running the show with 55 million registered members in the US alone...\n\nThats how they improve cashflow, along with shutting down stores that arent profitable or barely profitable and which woudlnt make sense to renovate on the scale necessary.  The whole going bankrupt thing is a joke as well, they have been improving their margins and cut costs by over half in 2020 alone, if you think a shift to higher margin items already take place,  a halving in cost and all the other changes will have them loose as much money as they did during 2020 and will go bankrupt in 6-8 months then you are beyond saving\n\nLastly let me touch on your short-squeeze comments. This is the place where I can notice the most that you didnt do any research, since noone is saying that we are in the short squeeze right now, or that Melvin capital has been covering their shorts. Reverse there have been like 1000 posts by now about how the short interest has actually increased to record levels in the past week. This is a good thing, it means the squeeze would be based off of current levels, which are about 2x what they were before, and that there is more squeezing to be done since more shorts would need to cover their position. Just sustaining this price levels, without a jump in price once RC announces his plan for Gamestop going forward, or when he inevitably increases his share % to 19.9% or if Gamestop has a profitable quarter, even if none of that happens, shorts would have to sell their positions within 2 months or they would loose more in fees than the entire earnings potential of their positions and thats not even taking into account the literal billions of dollar they have paid in fees to maintain them so far. Even if you didnt think Gamestop had a long future ahed of it, the short squeeze would still be very likely. \n\nLet this be a lesson, dont go calling Ryan Cohen, Michael Burry and the tons of other GME investors who are way smarter than you retards. Best of luck trading and please short GME for us.",

        "body": "I would probably be defined as a bear by most on here, but you still have to get time-frames correct. Until then, you might as well ride momentum.\n\n&gt; Vaccine is rolling out, interest rates are low for the next decade, a stable president is going into office, and trade war with China is finally coming to an end as China and US move towards friendship once again. \n\nFirst off, you're getting this stuff wrong. \n\n1. Biden has been very vocal that he will continue to work ***against*** China. Hence his support for Pompeo's labeling of genocide, and his reaction against China's sanctions against Trump's staff members. Thinking things are just going back to normal here is completely wishful thinking.\n2. Vaccine rollout is going, but it's hitting hiccups, and we're also facing potential new variants of the virus which are more contagious. Hard to say how much this does or doesn't matter, but it's something that the market does not seem to be pricing in right now.\n3. Interest rates being low is not necessarily as supportive as you may think. The market could easily view this through the lens of \"if we see another economic shock, there is no more ability to lower rates\". IE, removing the fed put to a degree. And yes, I know we can go negative, but that causes other problems and for now, the fed has been vocal about not wanting this. In other words, it would likely take a very significant shock for the fed to decide to go negative on rates. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The Stuff You're Missing**\n\n1. Debt, debt, and lots of debt. Most financial crises are a product of debt in one way or another. And guess what the entire world has? Far more debt than we've ever had before. We also have worse demographics, and worse growth. Hence why the global economy has been propped up by central banks for the last few years, unable to transition back to ***not*** requiring QE / zero percent rates. \n2. The problem with the above is that now that everyone is at zero percent rates, there is a transition towards using more fiscal policy to stimulate. That's required because monetary policy is no longer as effective, we're already at zero percent rates, and it's just causing it's own problems. Fiscal policy typically causes inflation. Inflating over-indebted societies causes financial crises, generally speaking.\n3. We're still out of a ton of jobs. More than the GFC, more than any time since the depression. While some will come back upon reopening, a lot won't. That's a problem, especially if those people can't transition  back into working effectively. \n4. Long term interest rates keep rising with more promise for fiscal policy. This causes tightening in our economy that we simply can't handle. At some point, the market will start to price in rising long term interest rates as a big negative for risk assets, especially the high-p/e stocks that have been the major trade for most market participants over the last 4-5 years.\n5. Record speculative market activity typically mean-reverts at some point. We've seen a shit ton of speculation in the last few months especially, major call option yolo'ing tends to mean revert once the supply of $ to the people buying these items slows down. Those call options have done wonders in pushing markets upwards, but it will require a constant supply of purchasing to keep markets elevated. It's a supply-demand thing in reality, and the supply of buyers speculating in meme stocks is not going to stay at the current pace long-term. When that slows down, you'll likely get a move downward that's even sharper than the move upward.\n6. Zero percent rates push everyone into far more risky financial assets. This has two effects. First, it can push the market up by providing a bid for those risky assets. But on the other hand, it introduces more downside risk if things start moving the opposite way. In short, we get market support at the cost of increasing market fragility and the propensity to see large shocks downward when stuff breaks.\n7. Antitrust + less business friendly political environment. This is a risk that has been considered for a long time, but it's much more likely to happen now. Antitrust suits can take out market leaders ala Microsoft in 2000. Taking out market leaders = bad for markets as a whole. FWIW, I don't think Biden is going to make the environment \"bad\" for business, it's just that we're transitioning away from an administration that created the most favorable financial conditions for corporates in history.\n\nThere is more I can add. But there is **always** more stuff to worry about. Markets do climb a wall of worry, and in today's market structure, we tend to see grinding slow rides upwards with very sharp and sudden selloffs downwards. Markets can and do stay elevated far longer than most bears usually think possible. \n\nRegardless, there is ***plenty*** of very real and very noteworthy risk in the markets today. I would argue there is more now than almost ever before, but we also are getting more government support at a quicker rate than ever before. This prevents cascading impacts of negative economic shocks in a lot of ways, which then provides confidence for investors to speculate.",

Only time will tell how high GME will go but at this price point you are dead fucken wrong. As for GME, these retards were at the fucken sleep at the wheel, when GME traded at 3$, any fucken person with a brain cell would of closed out their position after a 98% possible GAIN and put their capital elsewhere. These \"reputable hedge fund\" are fucken greedy pigs that are getting slaughtered.\n5. Except they're SPECIFICALLY SAID in their earnings THEY DO NOT NEED MONEY. Q3 earnings transcript THIS QUESTION WAS ASKED SPECIFICALLY, THEY SHOT BACK AND SAID THEY DO NOT NEED IT AT ALL. They are sitting on 500m CASH and paying back debt EARLY, they're going to be swimming in cash from the new console cycle, THEY HAVE 102m STILL ALLOCATED CASH TO STOCK BUYBACK. They'll issues shares when they squeeze those retard shorts when GME trades at 420.69$.\n\nFUCK YOU SHITRON.",

GameStop*\n\n*Trading at just 0.4 times revenue, GameStop (NYSE:GME) is severely undervalued because, well, everyone seems to doubt it -- and not for unjustifiable reasons. In fact, over $1.36 billion of the company's $2.19 billion worth of shares are sold short. Many investors see no reason not to bet against a brick-and-mortar retailer that is still selling physical copies of video games when they are nearly universally available online.*\n\n*If this is your view, you may be surprised to learn that GameStop is still doing pretty well despite its fair share of challenges. During its nine-week holiday sale ended Jan. 2, the company managed to bring in $1.77 billion in revenue, a modest decline of 3.1% from the same period last year. But in the interim, management closed 11% of its stores for being unprofitable; after adjusting for that, sales for the remaining locations actually went up.*\n\n*GameStop now has a robust e-commerce segment -- it's growing at a stunning rate of 309% year over year, and it accounts for over a third of total revenue. Last year, management signed an agreement with Microsoft to update its stores with the tech giant's software and cloud data solutions. In return, GameStop will be eligible for a commission on all digital revenue (such as video game purchases) generated from Microsoft's Xbox platform.*\n\n*Ryan Cohen, a co-founder of online pet food retailer Chewy, joined GameStop's advisory board on Jan. 11. His venture capital firm now owns 13% of the company's outstanding shares.*\n\n*Given these catalysts, I expect GameStop to turn around its operations in no time. Over the past year, its stock is already up a whopping 683%. Even after an amazing run up, though, its market cap ($2.6 billion) is still less than half its annual revenue ($6.46 billion). That makes for a price-to-sales ratios (P/S) far lower than what most retailers are trading at. If you're looking for stocks with the potential to double over time, consider GameStop.*",

That is why Tesla announced it is creating cheaper \u201c25k model\u201d for each of China, EU, and USA separately that will cater to their respective market. \n\nYou are correct here as well. But currently, majority of Toyota\u2019s 10M sales come from US, Japan, EU, China and Tesla can achieve similar feat if they focus enough on these markets (except Japan). When other developing countries like Vietnam can afford cars, Toyota will sell way more than 10M cars, maybe around 15M in 6 years. I never said Toyota will fail, they currently make the best (ice and non-plug hybrid) cars after all. \n\nYour argument that Tesla isn\u2019t doing well in EU is completely incorrect. They are doing really well, with demand very high. Unfortunately for now, they still have to import cars from China, which itself is supply constraint. Nevertheless, it\u2019s still the 2nd best selling EV in EU despite being a lot more expensive due to import tax and transportation; and once giga Berlin goes online, things would get much clear. At current rate, Tesla can easily get 1.5M in EU in 6 years, especially after they introduce their budget hatchback model specifically designed for EU. \n\nAnd Japan and Korea aren\u2019t that much of nationalistic as you think. If someone can make a better car, they will buy it. Japanese manufacturers did make the best cars, so there was no need to buy earlier. I mean, Apple sells millions of iPhones in Japan despite Sony and Motorola having released decent phones but barely selling anything. Japan and Korea can still represent 200-250k sales, but that\u2019s not necessary for 10M target. USA, China, EU, UK, and Norway are the most promising market that can account for majority of 10M sales. And I believe Tesla is focusing on these markets for now anyways.",

        "body": "I've been doing it for about a year now. In FY 2020, I made approximately $34,591.71 BY day and week trading \\*\\*(Please keep in mind that the trades I made were with excess cash on the sidelines and my \"core\" portfolio, was never touched so that appreciated substantially, just as I am sure everyone else's \"Long term hold portfolio also appreciated\" from March thru year end 2020). My day trading thesis was that if I could make $300 a day, when the charts of a particular stock or ETF were in support of my approach, then I would go for it. IF the market dipped OR if I felt that I was trading just to trade, then I would sit on the sidelines for that day and wait for a better support level on any given equity. So, out of a possible 253 trading days, I ended up day / week trading on 118 days and averaged a return of $293.15 per day that I actually traded. . So, as we rolled into 2021, where I do expect a substantive pull back, I have been playing with SPY puts (in anticipation of some pullback with a June expirations), and I rolled in and out of CVS, multiple times, to create about $1,400 of profit in 2 days. \n\nI can tell you first hand, if you have the cash on the sidelines to play with, that day trading is a viable revenue stream (especially if you're working from home), however, you have to have discipline AND, I would say, most importantly, that you have to play with quality day trading names. Most of my profit was made on the following day trade names: Amazon, Google, CVS, RVLV, DBX, QCOM, AMEX, LYB, FB, SWKS, GS, C, ADBE, etc...My thinking on these names was that if there was another massive drop, like we had in March / April, that I didn't mind holding these names for the long term BUT, at the same time, based on reading the charts, they had substantial \"support\" levels at particular prices, Amazon, specifically, would seemingly bounce off of $3,000 virtually everytime it hit that price. \n\nIn any event, I am really curious to see if I can hit the $100,000 mark in 2021, so far I am off to a good start, but if anyone is looking for additional tips OR for some guidance on my thought process and how I approach it, private message me and I'm happy to share additional details.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGood luck trading everyone and happy new year.",

Most people outside of finance had never heard about an \"ETF\". We were also seeing 6.5% CD rates in 2000. We didn't have iPhones back then, but my Lexus had a \"car phone\". Enjoyed the ride up in 1999, and saw much of that money erode come 2000. However, since I still had a job, I was able to continue to buy in 2000 when things were going down. Made my first $1M after 2 drawdown periods (1999 and 2008); $150k invested over 12 years (I'd try to put in $1k/month most months, and a bit extra when I could) turned into $1M.\n\nThere's just so much more information and knowledge available now, and the folks of today don't seem to have a problem with holding through drawdowns. I look at the \"new investments\" like Bitcoin in amazement, and not because of the parabolic moves, but because so many people have been holding on through 80% drawdowns. I've never seen such an iron conviction before. Folks of today are not afraid of drawdowns or volatility. Additionally, between all of our corporations, we're pumping in billions of new dollars every single week into the market now.\n\nTimes have changed, and you're kidding yourself if you haven't seen the change.",

This hasn\u2019t mooned yet and it\u2019s due for a run like BTBT. A lot of people don\u2019t know about EBON right now just like they didn\u2019t know about BTBT. It\u2019s going to be huge. A lot of people compare CAN to EBON but CAN has 150mil float (hard to move fast) and they don\u2019t have anything in the pipeline in terms of catalysts like EBON does for q1 2020. CEO is bullish and bitcoin at 28-29k is huge for them.\n\nBloomberg also released an article recently, calling them the next \u201cQualcomm of bitcoin mining hardware\u201d on December 26th. I made 4x my money on BTBT because I knew it was lagging behind mara/riot in terms of market cap to hash power.\n\nMy play now is EBON and I am extremely confident this unknown play is going to be the play for cryptocurrency. A bitcoin mining farm and crypto exchange in the pipeline is HUGE especially when they also are a market leader in terms of computing power for their bitcoin mining hardware (plus the patented exclusive rights to asicBOOST) \n\nBitmain planning to IPO at 50b and EBON has the chance to 4x or beyond just like BTBT.

        "body": "Ok, try my best:\n\nx86 and ARM are two different CPU architectures. AMD/Intel are based on x86 architecture.\n\nWithin the chips are CPU cores (hence u see 4-core/6-core/8-core CPUs etc). In (current) x86 architecture, all the cores are the same.\n\nIn ARM they are hybrid cores where some of these cores are power-hungry powerful cores for high-performance and some are lower power cores but more power-efficient. \n\nTraditionally more power = more performance (a simplified view) but there's a diminishing return and also in a battery-powered situation, this doesn't really scale.\n\nThe majority of pc/laptops/electronic devices don't always need to use powerful cores all the time. So when you have a hybrid architecture you can save power and only use the efficient cores when you are doing light tasks and then turn on the high-performance cores when you are doing demanding tasks.\n\nApple has been producing their own chips based on the ARM architecture and with the recent release of M1, they showed that CPUs can be both powerful and also energy-efficient in a mass-produced, everyday machine. This is especially true when you design the software (e.g. the OS) to distribute tasks accordingly to the right hybrid cores in order to improve performance per watt. i.e. optimising the software to take advantage of the chip design.\n\nTaking an assumption that AMD/Intel can not keep up with the pace of innovation that Apple is doing with producing their own chips, and that they will for the near-future stick with the x86 architecture, they will need to do something to mitigate this performance per watt difference between Apple and themselves. \n\nI'm thinking that AMD/Intel will also go down the route of Big.Little design employed by ARM while sticking with the x86 architecture. \n\nIntel I believe, is releasing a new CPU based on this architecture in the coming year. AMD I think is waiting on software to take advantage of this hence my comment on there is a dependant variable on Microsoft if they can optimise Windows for Big-Little Architecture and also ARM.\n\nIf MSFT spends more time on ARM optimisation you might see laptop manufacturers start using ARM chips from companies such as Qualcomm with their Snapdragon chips vs AMD/Intel chips (an example of this would be Microsoft Surface Pro X laptop).\n\nCircling it all back, this might have an effect on the future growth of AMD. How much, positive vs negative, that's for anyone to guess....\n\nHope that helps but also caveat disclaimer; there's a lot of \"if then therefore\" simplified logic in there.",

Qualcomm will be reaping massive returns in automotive by the time apple has something that's not as shit as the Intel ones they had been using. Qualcomm will still earn $9-18 an iPhone even if Apple is using 100% their own parts. They settled the 4.5bn lawsuit because they didn't want to admit stealing source code from qualcomm and giving it to Intel (and still failed), pretty red flag that they have to resort to that. \n\nBroadcom is definitely worthy of owning for a broad 5G portfolio. QCOM has my heart and is just making so much money. QCOM sets the global standards, owns the relevant patents and is so incredibly positioned for 5G take off it's insane. Most people think of 5G as faster cell service for smartphones when it's not for that at all.

Imagine the value of the IP from a company that has the cell tech which would replace all battery pack modules in most every product which uses lithium-ion. That's a pretty big reason, amongst other smaller factors, that justified them spiking. Reaching 130 a little while ago, I can't say that it's justified without a product and still a projected ways into the future for being able to have a product. However, at 100; yes? It's undervalued if it's trading at 70-80 or less. I could easily see this having a run-up similar to Qualcomm, once they've resolved the hurdles with their lithium solid-state. This was a big reason that I felt that RMO was more future-proof. They've stated they can transition their current battery packs from lithium-ion to solid-state in a short period of time. The number of people that haven't been able to differentiate between battery cells and module packaging is really overwhelming.\n\nQS product is solid-state battery cells, which is what stores potential energy from the configuration of a solid electrode and electrolyte, instead of liquid.\n\nRMO product is battery packaging, modules, and applications, which is what takes the battery cell tech, finds solutions for applying it to end-products, and manufactures them for those end-products.\n\nThese two companies are literally two different markets and aren't even competitors.",

And [Nvidia is the one leading the charge in terms of Ray Tracing](https://www.tomshardware.com/features/amd-vs-nvidia-gpus) - which most will agree is the future. \n\nAlso, [for the past 15 years Apple has exclusively used Intel CPUs in their notebooks and desktops](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/10/why-apple-is-breaking-a-15-year-partnership-with-intel-on-its-macs-.html). Which is a relatively small blow to Intel's overall sales, but it impacts AMD even less. Now if Apple were to start making CPUs for retail consumers as a standalone product, then AMD might be in some trouble. But that seems extremely unlikely as one of the main reasons Apple wants to make their own SoCs is so that they can move away from x86 to ARM architecture. \n\nNvidia has said they plan to purchase Arm from Softbank for $40 billion. The beauty of this acquisition for Nvidia is that Arm licenses out their CPU architecture to companies like Apple, Qualcomm, and Samsung.\n\nTL DR; Nvidia will be here for a while.",

I remember one day QCOM went up by more than 100 points. I made more on QCOM that day than my annual salary. By the fall, I was looking at huge capital gains and I decided to just hold out until the new year to sell that way I could delay paying the capital gains tax by another year.\n\nSo, I sold out of my position the first week of January.

In FY 2020, I made approximately $34,591.71 BY day and week trading \\*\\*(Please keep in mind that the trades I made were with excess cash on the sidelines and my \"core\" portfolio, was never touched so that appreciated substantially, just as I am sure everyone else's \"Long term hold portfolio also appreciated\" from March thru year end 2020). My day trading thesis was that if I could make $300 a day, when the charts of a particular stock or ETF were in support of my approach, then I would go for it. IF the market dipped OR if I felt that I was trading just to trade, then I would sit on the sidelines for that day and wait for a better support level on any given equity. So, out of a possible 253 trading days, I ended up day / week trading on 118 days and averaged a return of $293.15 per day that I actually traded. . So, as we rolled into 2021, where I do expect a substantive pull back, I have been playing with SPY puts (in anticipation of some pullback with a June expirations), and I rolled in and out of CVS, multiple times, to create about $1,400 of profit in 2 days. \n\nI can tell you first hand, if you have the cash on the sidelines to play with, that day trading is a viable revenue stream (especially if you're working from home), however, you have to have discipline AND, I would say, most importantly, that you have to play with quality day trading names. Most of my profit was made on the following day trade names: Amazon, Google, CVS, RVLV, DBX, QCOM, AMEX, LYB, FB, SWKS, GS, C, ADBE, etc...My thinking on these names was that if there was another massive drop, like we had in March / April, that I didn't mind holding these names for the long term BUT, at the same time, based on reading the charts, they had substantial \"support\" levels at particular prices, Amazon, specifically, would seemingly bounce off of $3,000 virtually everytime it hit that price. \n\nIn any event, I am really curious to see if I can hit the $100,000 mark in 2021, so far I am off to a good start, but if anyone is looking for additional tips OR for some guidance on my thought process and how I approach it, private message me and I'm happy to share additional details.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGood luck trading everyone and happy new year.",

This hasn\u2019t mooned yet and it\u2019s due for a run like BTBT. A lot of people don\u2019t know about EBON right now just like they didn\u2019t know about BTBT. It\u2019s going to be huge. A lot of people compare CAN to EBON but CAN has 150mil float (hard to move fast) and they don\u2019t have anything in the pipeline in terms of catalysts like EBON does for q1 2020. CEO is bullish and bitcoin at 28-29k is huge for them.\n\nBloomberg also released an article recently, calling them the next \u201cQualcomm of bitcoin mining hardware\u201d on December 26th. I made 4x my money on BTBT because I knew it was lagging behind mara/riot in terms of market cap to hash power.\n\nMy play now is EBON and I am extremely confident this unknown play is going to be the play for cryptocurrency. A bitcoin mining farm and crypto exchange in the pipeline is HUGE especially when they also are a market leader in terms of computing power for their bitcoin mining hardware (plus the patented exclusive rights to asicBOOST) \n\nBitmain planning to IPO at 50b and EBON has the chance to 4x or beyond just like BTBT. A lot of these plays are unknown and you just need to go in early. Don\u2019t go in the popular stocks that everyones talking about because most of the time, they just fail. We got a great stock here and we\u2019re early. Good luck to all. Bullish. BTC nearing 30k ATH hit 29600 and now around 29100-29200.",

        "body": "Ok, try my best:\n\nx86 and ARM are two different CPU architectures. AMD/Intel are based on x86 architecture.\n\nWithin the chips are CPU cores (hence u see 4-core/6-core/8-core CPUs etc). In (current) x86 architecture, all the cores are the same.\n\nIn ARM they are hybrid cores where some of these cores are power-hungry powerful cores for high-performance and some are lower power cores but more power-efficient. \n\nTraditionally more power = more performance (a simplified view) but there's a diminishing return and also in a battery-powered situation, this doesn't really scale.\n\nThe majority of pc/laptops/electronic devices don't always need to use powerful cores all the time. So when you have a hybrid architecture you can save power and only use the efficient cores when you are doing light tasks and then turn on the high-performance cores when you are doing demanding tasks.\n\nApple has been producing their own chips based on the ARM architecture and with the recent release of M1, they showed that CPUs can be both powerful and also energy-efficient in a mass-produced, everyday machine. This is especially true when you design the software (e.g. the OS) to distribute tasks accordingly to the right hybrid cores in order to improve performance per watt. i.e. optimising the software to take advantage of the chip design.\n\nTaking an assumption that AMD/Intel can not keep up with the pace of innovation that Apple is doing with producing their own chips, and that they will for the near-future stick with the x86 architecture, they will need to do something to mitigate this performance per watt difference between Apple and themselves. \n\nI'm thinking that AMD/Intel will also go down the route of Big.Little design employed by ARM while sticking with the x86 architecture. \n\nIntel I believe, is releasing a new CPU based on this architecture in the coming year. AMD I think is waiting on software to take advantage of this hence my comment on there is a dependant variable on Microsoft if they can optimise Windows for Big-Little Architecture and also ARM.\n\nIf MSFT spends more time on ARM optimisation you might see laptop manufacturers start using ARM chips from companies such as Qualcomm with their Snapdragon chips vs AMD/Intel chips (an example of this would be Microsoft Surface Pro X laptop).\n\nCircling it all back, this might have an effect on the future growth of AMD. How much, positive vs negative, that's for anyone to guess....\n\nHope that helps but also caveat disclaimer; there's a lot of \"if then therefore\" simplified logic in there.",

The new 480 chip might make samsung not even bother. Even apple's modems will likely be the otherside of snapdragon vs A13. Qualcomm will be reaping massive returns in automotive by the time apple has something that's not as shit as the Intel ones they had been using. Qualcomm will still earn $9-18 an iPhone even if Apple is using 100% their own parts. They settled the 4.5bn lawsuit because they didn't want to admit stealing source code from qualcomm and giving it to Intel (and still failed), pretty red flag that they have to resort to that. \n\nBroadcom is definitely worthy of owning for a broad 5G portfolio. QCOM has my heart and is just making so much money. QCOM sets the global standards, owns the relevant patents and is so incredibly positioned for 5G take off it's insane. Most people think of 5G as faster cell service for smartphones when it's not for that at all. Once retail investors understand this, they'll be hoping on qualcomm. \n\nI think we will see significant investment in 5G infrastructure in the coming US infrastructure bill, telcoms and companies like Ericsson rely on that.",

Imagine the value of the IP from a company that has the cell tech which would replace all battery pack modules in most every product which uses lithium-ion. That's a pretty big reason, amongst other smaller factors, that justified them spiking. Reaching 130 a little while ago, I can't say that it's justified without a product and still a projected ways into the future for being able to have a product. However, at 100; yes? It's undervalued if it's trading at 70-80 or less. I could easily see this having a run-up similar to Qualcomm, once they've resolved the hurdles with their lithium solid-state. This was a big reason that I felt that RMO was more future-proof. They've stated they can transition their current battery packs from lithium-ion to solid-state in a short period of time. The number of people that haven't been able to differentiate between battery cells and module packaging is really overwhelming.\n\nQS product is solid-state battery cells, which is what stores potential energy from the configuration of a solid electrode and electrolyte, instead of liquid.\n\nRMO product is battery packaging, modules, and applications, which is what takes the battery cell tech, finds solutions for applying it to end-products, and manufactures them for those end-products.\n\nThese two companies are literally two different markets and aren't even competitors.",

In the end, quality always matters. As a part of my framework, I allocate roughly 5% of my portfolio to purchase speculative stocks which don't yet meet my criteria for a core position in my portfolio. Speculative plays include things like IPOs, SPACs, etc. They can also include items like Gamestop, AMC or Blackberry. \n\nHaving a dedicated allocation of your portfolio to take on these items offers multiple benefits:\n\n1. If the play finds support at zero, its a maximum of 5% across my account.\n\n2. Since this 5% total is between any of my new or speculative stocks, it limits exposure overall (e.g. a blend of GME, AMC, BB, + CCIV, IPOE) limits your risk as opposed to dedicating all 5% to one play.\n\nIf a speculative item does well and I start to gather more data to support my position on it (e.g. understand what the company is actually doing/their roadmap, their customers/contracts, and sector risks; hard data/math: volatility, geometric mean, Sharpe/Sortino ratios) I consider adding it to my core portfolio (purchasing more and elevating it out of \"speculative\" status). \n\nOnce added to my core portfolio, it becomes something that I purchase on a regular cadence (e.g. every pay period I purchase my core portfolio). \n\nRisk management takes incredible discipline, but having a strategy and sticking to it (until something materially changes with your strategy to warrant changes) will give you the best results in the long-term, especially if you're buying individual securities. \n\nGood luck",

No doubt it's loaded with risk, the TAM is still a projection, but to claim there isn't a way to forecast how they make money seems a bit much. Now, it can take them another 3-5 years to make a profit best case, but there are more than enough rich people with $250k to blow for the next few years while they ramp up flight cadence and bring costs down. \n\nI'm _barely_ bullish long term, but with that said there is nothing but hope and dreams driving the stock price right now. If for some reason (hype?) the stock does double in price again before end of Q1, I'm certainly selling some to cover my principle plus 3x and letting the rest ride.\n\nHonestly to me the biggest mistake most people make looking at the stock is underestimating how rich people spend their money and how many rich people will line up to go to space once the first people posts about it on social media.",

Sure, they've got hype and good press, but their business is not set up to be competitive in the space tourism sector.

It may seem at the moment that they're close to launching paying passengers, but let's look at their competitors 3-5 years down the line. You have SpaceX with both Crew Dragon (just announced their first all-civilian flight) and Starship (coming soon\u2122\ufe0f, but will have huge implications for space tourism), as well as Blue Origin, which is less ambitious but about in the same product slot as SPCE. Both of these companies have huge financial backing and are on track to have significantly lower costs, higher launch cadence, and better product. SPCE may have a small niche somewhere in that market, but I don't think long-term it is a good play.\nSource: am space nerd. \n\nDisclaimer: not financial advice, no position in SPCE",

        "body": "As a person who focuses exclusively on buying baskets of individual stocks, I say this to you: You need to focus on quality portfolio construction. In the end, quality always matters. As a part of my framework, I allocate roughly 5% of my portfolio to purchase speculative stocks which don't yet meet my criteria for a core position in my portfolio. Speculative plays include things like IPOs, SPACs, etc. They can also include items like Gamestop, AMC or Blackberry. \n\nHaving a dedicated allocation of your portfolio to take on these items offers multiple benefits:\n\n1. If the play finds support at zero, its a maximum of 5% across my account.\n\n2. Since this 5% total is between any of my new or speculative stocks, it limits exposure overall (e.g. a blend of GME, AMC, BB, + CCIV, IPOE) limits your risk as opposed to dedicating all 5% to one play.\n\nIf a speculative item does well and I start to gather more data to support my position on it (e.g. understand what the company is actually doing/their roadmap, their customers/contracts, and sector risks; hard data/math: volatility, geometric mean, Sharpe/Sortino ratios) I consider adding it to my core portfolio (purchasing more and elevating it out of \"speculative\" status). \n\nOnce added to my core portfolio, it becomes something that I purchase on a regular cadence (e.g. every pay period I purchase my core portfolio). \n\nRisk management takes incredible discipline, but having a strategy and sticking to it (until something materially changes with your strategy to warrant changes) will give you the best results in the long-term, especially if you're buying individual securities. \n\nGood luck",
