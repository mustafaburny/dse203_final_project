        "body": "I think having an America-centric outlook on canna is going to make folks miss out. Glad the aph/til has a strong global focus and I suspect the US market will be very chopped up between growers. All due respect to places like California and Washington, but the world knows the British Columbia reputation for quality first. Sweetwater is going introduce Americans to Broken Coast, which is the company that made me invest in Aphria in the first place. Too many financial squares with no real understanding of the industry. Consumers, both medical and rec will catch on soon and demand quality. Crazy it is dropping today but I am used to the ridicousness at this point and will be patiently sitting on my shares.",

They had a solid cash float and their revenues were increasing for a while quarter after quarter. They were making great investments and compared to the competition like Canopy and Tilray, they had the soundest business model going but for some reason theit stock wasn't seen as sexy as Canopy. \n I bought in at around $14 in mid 2018 and bag held until early 2021 when I could finally make a profit. Nearly 3 years of bag holding at a loss anywhere between 20-60% sucks, especially when I didn't know if I'd ever get it back.",

I like what the other OP said to reset your cost basis every now and then so it becomes more manageable.  It has become a huge problem for me too.   I too have massive long LGTC &gt;500k on a stock that I\u2019m not sure I want to hold for the next 5 years just so I can sell ~100k a year to reduce taxes.\n\nYou say TODAY you want to hold MSFT for a long time but at some point, you will have to pay the taxes.  MSFT might not be around when you retire in 20-30 years.  Just because MSFT has been doing well for the last 5 years doesn\u2019t mean it will do well the next 25.

As of Q1 2020 current management has yet to receive any company (CCTL) books, statements, bank info, property, assets or proof of any Bitcon holdings from old management. All previous financial reports 2018 and 2019 were mostly reconstructed from previous reports filed by Coin Citadel and old CEO Bill Schaefer. Without substantive proof of current Bitcoin holdings still held by old management, or that a loss was incurred from an unusual event and or negligent action by prior management due to lost access to private keys and or wallets, or Bitcoin was sold and previous sale was never disclosed to new management, Coin Citadel cannot continue to reference the aforementioned Bitcoin Treasury in its financials moving forward.\"\n\nSo it's either been a scam or someone pocketed 500+ bitcoin, or someone lost access to wallets.

They all have their own supply and demand and the more credible companies hop on, the more credible it will get.(compared to currencies being manipulated by stimulus packages, interest rates and buying other currencies). \n\n\nIt IS being regulated and audited. The mid February crash happened because some firm falsely stated that they found a double transaction. It was later backtracked but the damage was done. \n\nThe values is linked to how hard it is to mine 1 coin at this point. You could mine a coin with an idle computer so at the time it was chump change, now it takes high powered hardware, a heavy electricity bill and a ton of cooling to get one so the price goes along with it + how it can only get harder to have one. \n\nYour coins are as secure as you make it. There are crypted USB keys  to keep your wallet safe but like everything, the more valuable it is, the more someone will have the patience to get it.\n\nThe future is in that it cuts currency exchange fees(the banks) and rates(the government) and financial institutions from host to client. You get a coin, you trade parts of it the way you want internationally or confidentially with no brick and mortar fees. \n\nThe GME saga showed big banks can and will interfere to make money over the well being of free market.\n\nBitcoin might not be the end all solution but something can be said about the infrastructure behind it where no \"package\"(hash) can be hacked since the time and date , the number of characters, sender and receivers , and so much of the the data that makes the hash can be used to encrypt it thus can't be \"reinserted\" in the blockchain.",

In other words the un verified unsecured currencies died a decade plus ago from not being hack proof.\n\nThe currencies are currently competing with each other the same way the Yen, Euro, US dollar and more are competing with each other. They all have their own supply and demand and the more credible companies hop on, the more credible it will get.(compared to currencies being manipulated by stimulus packages, interest rates and buying other currencies). \n\n\nIt IS being regulated and audited. The mid February crash happened because some firm falsely stated that they found a double transaction. It was later backtracked but the damage was done. \n\nThe values is linked to how hard it is to mine 1 coin at this point. You could mine a coin with an idle computer so at the time it was chump change, now it takes high powered hardware, a heavy electricity bill and a ton of cooling to get one so the price goes along with it + how it can only get harder to have one. \n\nYour coins are as secure as you make it. There are crypted USB keys  to keep your wallet safe but like everything, the more valuable it is, the more someone will have the patience to get it.\n\nThe future is in that it cuts currency exchange fees(the banks) and rates(the government) and financial institutions from host to client. You get a coin, you trade parts of it the way you want internationally or confidentially with no brick and mortar fees. \n\nThe GME saga showed big banks can and will interfere to make money over the well being of free market.\n\nBitcoin might not be the end all solution but something can be said about the infrastructure behind it where no \"package\"(hash) can be hacked since the time and date , the number of characters, sender and receivers , and so much of the the data that makes the hash can be used to encrypt it thus can't be \"reinserted\" in the blockchain.",

Options trading is most useful when you get the gamma cheap while also calling the direction right.\n\nI'm buying INTC 23Apr 70c because resistance at 65 has kept IV muted. My bet is that INTC will break through that resistance on 6Apr or 23Apr. I hate talking in terms of resistance in general, but looking at the long-term chart as well as price action in the morning after the Intel Unleashed event, it certainly seems like you'd need a big catalyst to justify a breakout beyond 65. I'd probably play those profits -- if any -- into AMD puts through to May, because I think hedge fund selling will take place when Lisa Su inevitably acknowledges the incorrectness of her prediction that supply \"tightness\" would clear up by 2H21.\n\nI also believe that the Archegos liquidation is another sign that correlated hedge fund losses will spell disaster for the market. We saw this already with GME and the other short-squeeze names. Chipmakers like to lay out their capex as close to production ramp-up as possible, which means that LRCX/AMAT/ASML/KLIC/KLAC/CAJ/etc won't book profits immediately even if billions of dollars are allocated to the roadmap. So I'm waiting for a big selloff this summer to get into those names as a long-term position. May try to play that selloff using hedgie favorites and names that have a lot of room to fall. ARKK, TSLA, TSM, NVDA come to mind. TSM seems counterintuitive but you get the added potential catalyst of Chinese brinkmanship as well as a deepening of the water supply woes.\n\nI mention CAJ because it gives a good read on DUV demand. Their equipment segment had a lot of profit growth last quarter. But it's not as good a play as the others because only a fifth of its revenue comes from that segment.",
