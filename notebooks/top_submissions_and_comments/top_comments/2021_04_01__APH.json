Glad the aph/til has a strong global focus and I suspect the US market will be very chopped up between growers. All due respect to places like California and Washington, but the world knows the British Columbia reputation for quality first. Sweetwater is going introduce Americans to Broken Coast, which is the company that made me invest in Aphria in the first place. Too many financial squares with no real understanding of the industry. Consumers, both medical and rec will catch on soon and demand quality. Crazy it is dropping today but I am used to the ridicousness at this point and will be patiently sitting on my shares.",

They had a solid cash float and their revenues were increasing for a while quarter after quarter. They were making great investments and compared to the competition like Canopy and Tilray, they had the soundest business model going but for some reason theit stock wasn't seen as sexy as Canopy. \n I bought in at around $14 in mid 2018 and bag held until early 2021 when I could finally make a profit. Nearly 3 years of bag holding at a loss anywhere between 20-60% sucks, especially when I didn't know if I'd ever get it back.",
