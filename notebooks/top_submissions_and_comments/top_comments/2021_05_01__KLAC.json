This was the closest someone could be to an investor in those days.  Stoic philosophy encouraged living in accord with Nature, which didn't simple mean the natural earth but also reality more broadly, that the key to escaping suffering is to live life with accurate expectations about Nature.  It's hard to imagine a Stoic who takes up investing not to be interested in things like the balance sheet.    Here's what Wikipedia says about him.\n\n*Diogenes reports that Zeno's interest in philosophy began when \"he consulted* [*the oracle*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythia) *to know what he should do to attain the best life, and that the god's response was that he should take on the complexion of the dead. Whereupon, perceiving what this meant, he studied ancient authors.\"*[*\\[5\\]*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeno_of_Citium#cite_note-6) *Zeno became a wealthy merchant. On a voyage from* [*Phoenicia*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenicia) *to* [*Peiraeus*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peiraeus) *he survived a shipwreck, after which he went to Athens and visited a bookseller. There he encountered* [*Xenophon*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenophon)*'s* [*Memorabilia*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memorabilia_(Xenophon))*. He was so pleased with the book's portrayal of* [*Socrates*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socrates) *that he asked the bookseller where men like Socrates were to be found. Just then,* [*Crates of Thebes*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crates_of_Thebes)*, the most famous* [*Cynic*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cynicism_(philosophy)) *living at that time in* [*Greece*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greece) *happened to be walking by, and the bookseller pointed to him.*[*\\[6\\]*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeno_of_Citium#cite_note-FOOTNOTELa%C3%ABrtius1925%C2%A7_2%E2%80%933-7)\n\n*Zeno is described as a haggard, dark-skinned person,*[*\\[7\\]*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeno_of_Citium#cite_note-FOOTNOTELa%C3%ABrtius1925%C2%A7_1-8) *living a spare,* [*ascetic*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascetic) *life*[*\\[8\\]*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeno_of_Citium#cite_note-FOOTNOTELa%C3%ABrtius1925%C2%A7_26%E2%80%9327-9) *despite his wealth.

[Source](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/AOUT/)\n\n* Conglomerate of multiple business in the outdoor industry.\n\n* Spin off from Smith &amp; Wesson (SWBI).\n\n* AOUT does not sell firearms--IIRC this is why the AOUT-SWBI split was performed--the items most associated with firearms and/or the defense industry it sells are through Crimson Trace (scopes, red dot, lasers), Frankford Arsenal (reloading), Caldwell (ear protection, range gear, targets), and Tipton (gun cleaning and maintenance). Operates in the outdoor industry through Uncle Henry, Old Timer, and Schrade (knives), Meat! (meat processing), UST (camping supplies such as tents, sleeping bags, cookware, etc.), Bubba (fisherman\u2019s gear for processing), among others. \n\n* Few publicly traded competitors in this outdoor recreational sector; Great American Outdoors Group owns Bass Pro Shops, Cabela's and recently acquired the previously publicly traded Sportsman's Warehouse. The only publicly traded competitors in this broad, overarching recreational category that I can think of are Vista Outdoors (VSTO), Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS), Gander Mountain (MM), and Academy Sports &amp; Outdoors (ASO).\n\n**Vista Outdoors - VSTO**\n\n**Dry &amp; Drab overview of VSTO:** Vista Outdoor Inc. designs, manufactures, and markets various consumer products in the outdoor sports and recreation markets in the United States and internationally. It has a portfolio of brands that provides consumers with a range of products for individual outdoor recreational pursuits. The company operates through two segments, Shooting Sports and Outdoor Products.

Vista Outdoor Inc. was incorporated in 2014 and is headquartered in Anoka, Minnesota. [Source](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/VSTO/) \n\n* Large conglomerate of multiple business in the outdoor industry.\n\n* VSTO does not sell firearms, the items most associated with firearms and/or the defense industry it sells are through Alliant Powder (smokeless powder), CCI (ammo and primers), Hevi-Shot (shotgun ammo), Federal (ammo and reloading supplies), Remington (ammo), Speer (ammo and reloading supplies), Bushnell (scopes and optics), and RCBS (reloading tools). Operates in the outdoor industry through Bell (helmets), Blackburn (bike gear), Krash (kids helmets and scooters), Copilot (child bike carriers), Camelback (hydration), Bushnell Golf (really?), Eagle Industries (for the Gravy Seals amongst us), Primos (hunting gear), among others. \n\n* Few publicly traded competitors in this outdoor recreational sector; Great American Outdoors Group owns Bass Pro Shops, Cabela's and recently acquired the previously publicly traded Sportsman's Warehouse. The only publicly traded competitors in this broad, overarching recreational category that I can think of are American Outdoor Brands (AOUT), Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS), Gander Mountain (MM), and Academy Sports &amp; Outdoors (ASO).\n\n* Divested of it\u2019s gun manufacturing subsidiaries, Savage Arms and Stevens, in 2019; so VSTO does not sell firearms. \n\n* Through bankruptcy proceedings in October 2020, VSTO will acquire Remington Arm\u2019s ammunition manufacturing facility in Arkansas, and related intellectual property, including the Remington brand and trademarks, for $81.4 million.\n\n* Expect reactive stock moves to Federal rhetoric and legislature surrounding guns and ammo.\n\n* Expect reactive stock moves to Federal elections (POTUS and Congress).\n\n* Due to my experience in the firearms and outdoor industry and being fully aware of what's been happening the last 12-18 months within these sectors, I question their ability to sustain such dramatic growth related to ammunition and reloading components beyond calendar year 2021. \n\n\n**Microsoft - MSFT**\n\nMSFT isn\u2019t that into aerospace and defense, but I\u2019m including them because of the following notable contracts. \n\n**Dry &amp; Drab overview of MSFT:** Seriously!? If you're really asking then there's a tree stump out in the holler with a higher IQ.\n\n* $10B JEDI (Joint Enterprise Defense Initiative) contract - intended to provide the government with a cloud computing platform that would sit atop all other cloud deployments at the DoD and provide a general-purpose cloud environment; smaller, specific clouds \u2014 what the government called \u201cfit for purpose\u201d clouds \u2014 were only to be utilized on an as-needed basis. Contract has been riddled with controversy and litigation due to protests by Amazon and Oracle. DoD has taken actions that indicates that it may scrap the whole JEDI project due to delays as a result of protests and litigation. \n\n* $22B HoloLens contract over 10-years -  augmented reality headset for Army.\n\n**Uranium**\n\nFor an analysis of the uranium market, DD, and recommendations, I'm referring you apes to the Uranium Prophet himself, r/3STmotivation \n\nI personally consider r/3STmotivation to not only be the Uranium Prophet, but to be made of pure Gold-Titanium-Sulfur-Tellurium. Refer to their posts, specifically [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/UraniumSqueeze/comments/mo46cg/preservation_of_nuclear_power_and_the_green/), [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/kpjvhs/2021_will_be_an_unforgettable_year_for_uranium/), and [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/kt36if/answers_to_the_10_most_asked_questions_regarding/); 3STmotivation has indicated that most of his new content on uranium will be published [here.](https://www.patreon.com/contrariancodex) \n\nI'm not the most autistic ape out there, so at the moment, I'm not too sure how programs such as the Nuclear Triad will impact uranium stocks/ETFs; this topic needs further exploration.",
