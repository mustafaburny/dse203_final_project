        "body": "I'm sorry but this is a gross misunderstanding of what is going on.\n\nThe S&amp;P 500 is not the economy.  It also is not an equal weighing of all the companies in the S&amp;P.  As long as there's not full blown fear, there should be some differentiation.  Owning MSFT and owning M are not equal.  The stocks like MSFT are helping carry the S&amp;P while M being down a lot is a not a proportionate loss.\n\nDon't forget, we are down.  It's not like we're up YTD.\n\nYou also have to remember that there's no competition to equities.  The 10-year is yielding less than 1%.  Why would I buy that when I can buy AAPL and get a better dividend than that?  After all, it has about $100 billion in cash alone right now so the dividend seems pretty safe.\n\nThere's also this thing called sentiment.  In layman's terms, it's the general belief of what will happen.  So while unemployment may not return to the record pre-crisis levels, the market believes most of these jobs will be back soon.  And that makes a lot of sense if you believe the world will be re-opening soon, which I do.  Since the general belief is that unemployment will be resolved shortly, the market is priced accordingly. \n\nThere's also TRILLIONS of dollars of stimulus being issued in a variety of ways.  I think you might underestimate how much TRILLIONS really is.\n\nEven if you're right and the market is being irrational, these bullish rallies are normal in a bear market.  That means you can be right AND THIS STILL HAPPENS.  These must be accounted for but you're not accounting for them whatsoever.\n\nMost importantly, you're looking at this like an amateur.   Big time investors are capitalists.  They understand ups and downs and all sorts of things I'm sure I don't know.  But markets are functioning.  The big fear in the Great Recession is that markets weren't functioning.  We recovered once it proved the markets functioned.  Knowing this, the Fed went right after this point immediately.  THAT'S WHY THE FED DID WHAT IT DID BECAUSE IT'S THAT IMPORTANT.  The day the Fed announced infinite QE was the bottom on the chart for the reason.  The Fed basically guaranteed markets will work so the worst case scenario is off the table.\n\nLastly \"Things aren't returning to normal anytime soon\" is a massive assumption.  I'm not saying the world will be back to normal on May 15th but a lot of people think the opposite of you, myself included.  Be careful what assumptions you make.\n\nEDIT:  You also have to remember how people think.  Let's say 20% of people thought the world would open again in April, 20% in May, 20% in June, 20% July, and 20% in August.  Well it's May now so the April 20% and the May 20% think re-opening is right around the corning - that's 40%.  In June, you add that 20% to the existing 40% and now we're up to 60%.  Just like you think the market will fall every day, they believe the opening is just around the corning.  You keep thinking \"tomorrow is the day\" forever.  Being stubborn  goes both ways.",

        "body": "Well now it\u2019s time to make money champ, I held puts from end of March to beginning of May, my portfolio was a disaster. I doubled it today alone, still down overall but I\u2019m seeing returns now and it feels good.  \n\nFind smart plays to go bullish on for the next month or so. Avoid tech, they\u2019re at ATH and have less room for growth. If you want quick returns buy calls on Aero stocks for tomorrow\u2019s launch. NOC, MAXR, SPCE. My plays right now are GLW 22.5c 24c, CERS 6c, PSTG 20c, all 6/19\n\nAlso as you trade more you\u2019ll start to recognize market movements better. I had some 292p last week but sold them Fri when it became clear we wouldn\u2019t break 293. I switched to 5/26 otm calls bc I suspected another leg up like last monday, and it played out as I expected and sold those calls for 500% gains this morning. Take it slow at first, don\u2019t get FOMO, I look forward to your gain porn.",

In terms of business similarity (not at all investing prospect similarities) I think of tech companies as:\n\n- chip/components/data center hardware: NVDA, AMD, INTC, QCOM, TXN\n- fabrication: TSM (I don't follow anything else sorry)\n- PaaS: MSFT, AMZN, IBM/RedHat, GOOG (trying aggressively)\n- SaaS/Software: MSFT, GOOG, ORCL, IBM/RedHat, ADEB, FB, AMZN\n- Consumer Electronics: AAPL\n- Ads: GOOG, FB\n\nobviously there are many other companies that I don't follow, and the categorization isn't 100% clean either. AAPL's services (music, icloud, etc) are forms of SaaS. FB is technically ads, but they are also a complete marketing SaaS especially globally where many businesses rely 100% on FB for their entire online presence. Ads also depends on your reach. Both GOOG and MSFT have consumer electronics, but I don't use that to drive investment. I won't be surprised if GOOG or MSFT cancel a major line of their hardware any time.\n\nThere are many other consumer electronics companies but nothing as fully integrated as AAPL in that area, including MSFT and GOOG.\n\nRedHat is active in the datacenter space and probably why IBM acquired them. IBM is more of a global tech projects coordinator, and manages a lot of banks infrastructures, but are feeling the pressure from other PaaS providers. I don't have any investments in it though. \n\nTech companies always have their toes in many businesses because of the nature of software. I can't think of one with more toes than MSFT (maybe GOOG second), which could be unfocused waste depending on their management. It certainly feel like it was for MSFT for most of the 2000s.\n\nTo answer OP's question though, I think any of these companies are probably fine with equal chances, though you will introduce yourself to company specific short term volatility. Who knows when a random bad news for AAPL, MSFT, AMD, NVDA, etc might hit affecting the stock price in the short term. Balancing (depending on the amount) or using an etf like others mentioned is a good idea, though I don't think any of your picks will be bad in the long run either.",

All the buzz about AI and machine learning on supercomputers currently is nothing more than a fancy algorithm (maybe not even that fancy) which takes huge amount of time and resources for self learning. Google\u2019s AlphaGo AI played insane number of games with itself before it managed to beat Ke Jie in human vs machine.

For value companies that care more for stability over growth (think P&amp;G, IBM, McDonalds, Coke), they care more about maintaining their earnings just enough so that they can grow their dividend with the natural (slow) growth of their company.",

Not only can they charge more on their website, its also more efficient. People are willing to pay a premium for their products. \n\nUlta - 21%. The largest makeup retailer. Women like to try on makeup in store. It's one of the few retailers that won't go bust from online competition. They are also focusing on online sales. Both online and physical stores will continue to grow. ULTA is a first stop for women looking for every day makeup. \n\nATVI (Activision) - 21%. COD warzone is a huge hit. All my coworkers are talking about it. Activision Blizzard has some of the most loved titles. The video game industry is going to grow for a long time. Activision will continue to follow trends and advance with technology.\n\nDIS (Disney) - 19%. Another great brand that people love. Disney+ is a huge hit and will continue to grow at a rapid pace as more people learn about it. Disney plus can catch up to Netflix in a few years. Both Disney and Netflix have roughly the same market cap. That means for the price of Netflix you can buy Disney+ and the rest of Disney is free. Disney owns so many entertainment companies it's pretty much a monopoly. \n\nAKAM (Akamai) - 9%. The largest security company in the world. Their customers are huge corporations like Adobe,  Airbnb, AMD, Audi, best buy, Fiat, Fox, Honda, IBM, Ikea, MSI, Microsoft, NBA, NBC, us air Force, US Department of state, Ubisoft, and Verizon. As technology becomes more advanced and connected, security demand is going to grow exponentially. Currently adding more to Akamai.",

Here is a 15-year chart of BRK.B vs S&amp;P500TR (untaxed dividends included):\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/BerkshireHathaway/comments/gd1ogo/brkb_vs_sp500_with_dividends_very_similar/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share\n\nThe airline loss for Berkshire was less than $3.5 billion. To put that in persepective, Berkshire had **operating earnings of almost $2 billion PER MONTH** in Q1 of 2020\n\nAnd quoting Bryant24 on SeekingAlpha:\n\n\"People always bring up IBM, he bought that in 2011 so it wasn't all that recent. It didn't work out as well as he'd hoped but he still made a little money on it. Also I give him credit because he got out in the $160's after he saw they were not doing as well in the cloud as he had expected. The stock has traded down in the lower $100's for the last couple of years so he at least made a good decision to get out.\"\n\n\"He bought his position in Heinz in 2012 and the deal with Kraft was done in 2015, so again not all that recent. He's also made money on KHC through it's dividend, I think the share price is about at the Berkshire cost basis. He had some KHC preferred shares that paid a really high coupon for several years. So he's returned well over 5% per year on his KHC investments and it's actually preforming pretty well right now. Again, not a great investment so far, but far from the disaster people make it out to be. It has been a disaster for those that bought it at 90.\"\n\n\"The airlines were actual losers but he was up a decent amount on them and then we had a pandemic. So perhaps he shouldn't have bought them, but things happen and the loss from the airline investment was tiny and immaterial in the scale of Berkshire. My point to all of this is people go out of their way to bring up Buffet's disappointing trades even nearly 10 years later and they way overstate the losses. Most are not educated on the trades and just repeat how big of a disaster IBM was when it was 9 years ago and not really a disaster.\"",

It became a dinosaur with the emergence of personal computers. But while many dinosaurs have been dead for years, IBM is still alive because -- IMO -- it has done one thing right: IBM Research.   IBM Research is what has kept IBM alive, staying with the youngsters.  \n\nGuess what. The current giants have learned from this. They all have invested heavily in research.  Most interestingly is Google. Most of their products are \"betas\", which are experimental research projects that are deployed to the public.\n\nAnother thing the giants have learned is that they need to be very flexible and adaptive to rising trends.   Microsoft raised because of the dominant of software, which by the way was the dead sentence for hardware giants.   But this dominant almost killed Microsoft, turning it into a dinosaur, when software became a commodity and not a specialty product.  Demanding customers to pay for each version of Windows and Word was no longer the right thing to do, Microsoft adapted to a model the sells software as a service.  And they have survived. They have also excelled due to Microsoft Research. This has allowed them to stay at the forefront.\n\nGoogle, Apple and FaceBook will be the dominating players in the near future because -- IMO -- data, data about people, and the interconnection of people have become more important than anything else.\n\nIt is very possible that data will become cheap in some sense, a commodity.  Although data has become more open, certain types of data can be very expensive to collect.  So I think Google and FaceBook will continue to have a promising future.\n\nApple is in a very interesting situation. It doesn't sell a product.   Other cellphone companies sell utilities. But Apple sells the experience of people connecting to people. It's like FaceBook in some way.  People inherent want to connect to other people. This is a lasting value.

IBM hasn't gone away but it lost its dominance and sharehodlers haven't reaped the same profits in the past decades as they did in its heyday. It could be worse: Kodak and Nokia are still around too!\n\nToo often people in this sub think \"can't disappear = can't lose money\" but it couldn't further from the truth. There are many ways a business can destroy shareholder value, or simply underperform the market, without going bankrupt.",

For the longest he refused to invest in tech sector then picks IBM....over AMZN, GOOGL, and FB.\n\nIt could be a ploy to drive the whole industry lower so he can take over a major airframer like Boeing.",
