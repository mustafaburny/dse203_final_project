If people can\u2019t drink themselves silly at a bar, are they now buying cars, good equipment, computer games, and other things with money that would have been spent at the bar? \n\nExample \u201cchip shortages\u201d. Nothing mentioned in the $NVDA about a shortage, just excessive demand and not being able to keep up with production.  \n\nAdditionally, many companies have dug themselves into a hole and aren\u2019t owning up to their mistake (automakers).  They cut production at the beginning of COVID and we are literally paying for their mistake by not being patient.  It\u2019s also a fault of inventory management system like \u201cJust In Time Inventory management (JTM) where it assumes the supply chain won\u2019t have major interruptions in the supply chain.
