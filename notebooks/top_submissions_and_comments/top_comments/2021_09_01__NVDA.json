Think about it this way: if definitive proof came out today that every short position in the stock was covered and there was no possibility of a squeeze, would you pay $200/share?",

Lehman Brothers was leveraged 31-to-1: https://www.investopedia.com/articles/economics/09/lehman-brothers-collapse.asp\n\n2) The crash of 2008 happened because prices were going one way, and demand was going the other. For instance, the supply of houses grew for **three years** before the bubble popped in 2008. In late 2008, the supply of housing was the highest it's ever been in recorded history. In late 2020, the supply of housing was the lowest it's ever been in recorded history. Even in 2006, it was obvious that supply was getting excessive. We're in the complete opposite situation right now: [supply is at an all time low.](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MSACSR)\n\n3) In 2008, the Federal Reserve did not own any mortgage backed securities whatsoever. Today, the Fed owns $2.5T in MBS. If the price of homes actually declined, they'd just buy more.\n\nSaying that \"housing is going to crash\" is like saying \"used car prices are going to crash\" or \"PS5 prices are going to crash\" or \"NVIDIA cards are going to be $50 next week.\" It's just absurd. Supply and demand is a thing.",

When I walkout of the door, a AMZN package I ordered 18 hours ago had already been here, neat. Then I take out my AAPL phone and go to GOOGL to look for a place to eat/chill, just got my PFE vaccine last month so I\u2019m good to go. Hoping into my trust worthy F F150 and starting to drive, I notice that hmmm I have been seeing a lot of TSLA cars around, maybe it\u2019ll be my next car? I\u2019m daydreaming. The drive is 5 miles, I wonder why the HDs, COSTs, WMTs, TGTs parking are always packed like that, even tho it\u2019s only Wednesday, \nHmmm guess I\u2019ll skip groceries today. I feel lazy. Sitting at the restaurant\u2019s outdoor patio, I enjoy my brunch with a glass of wine, my eyes start wandering around. What a beautiful day, the birds, the air, the people. Maybe it\u2019s enough wine for the day, I go in to grab a soft drink. 8 out of 10 drinks on the fountain machine are KO products. Lots people around me are working on their AAPL and MSFT laptops. They are so thin yet very powerful. As a tech geek I know they are powered by INTC and AMD CPUs, and the heavy stuffs are done with NVIDIA GPUs. Gosh people are so productive nowadays! It\u2019s time to leave, I lay my JPM V card to the tray, 5x points for dining baby! 5 mins later I\u2019m on my way. Shit, I\u2019m almost out of gas, pulling into a CVX gas station, tap my BAC MA card because I\u2019ll get 3% cash back on Gas. Damn there\u2019s a line wrapping around that MCD and SBUX drive thru, the food is unhealthy but well business is still booming I guess. \nGetting back into my home, I suddenly remember tomorrow is Oct 1st. I have T, VZ, NFLX bills to pay. \nDamn, I observed a lot from my lazy day today. I wonder what my life would be without all of the conveniences I saw today. \nI log into my Fidelity account and buy 4 more VOO shares. \nFeeling good.",

Converting Intel's fabs into a foundry business will be incredibly hard. From a technical standpoint, fabbing your own chips is extremely different from being a contract foundry. Intel, in particular, is known for doing a lot of manual layout/hacks to squeeze performance out of their process nodes, and this will be difficult (if not impossible) to replicate for foundry clients.\n2. Intel isn't really an attractive place to work anymore. Most of the best people I know aren't going to Intel, they're going elsewhere: Apple, Nvidia, etc.\n3. Intel has absolutely no chance in competing with TSMC on advanced nodes and realistically is out of this race for a long time. They're late to EUV, and TSMC's head start is pretty insurmountable.\n\n\nThis isn't to say that Intel won't be profitable over the next years, but I think it's important to keep some perspective.

Plus, Nvidia is now selling Low Hash Rate cards and Coin Mining Processors so I believe that they can push down that number even lower from now. \n\nSo my take on this issue is that I don't think coin mining is the wolf at the door.

I would appreciate an answer.\n\nGPU crypto mining is more likely to die out than to grow. As far as I know, no new crypto project uses Proof of Work. That leaves us with Bitcoin and its cousins. If Bitcoin succeeds, mining difficulty will ratchet up and GPUs will not even be considered for mining. If Bitcoin fails, no one will want to mine anyway. And already, most of network's hashing power comes from ASIC rigs, if I'm not mistaken.\n\nFor gaming, NVIDIA does have a pretty good moat in PC gaming, eventhough they have lost the consoles to AMD for now. And AMD is closing in. But, I think the bigger threat is a good game streaming service. If Google Stadia or a hypothetical Apple service becomes good, which I think is highly likely, they won't have any trouble catching a userbase, given their extensive ecosystem. While GeForce Now might be a good subscription model for NVIDIA, IMO it'll be difficult for it to compete against a service that comes with an entrenched ecosystem. While it is possible that NVIDIA chips power those game streaming services, it is also possible that they don't. With AMD closing in, and the larger trend of companies designing their own chips, no telling how that might go.\n\nI welcome critical comments.",

        "body": "The huge growth companies at the top are always going to be the ones that do the most damage to people's portfolio if there is indeed a bubble because most investors are in those companies, hence their high prices.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/kfMFDcuDKYA?t=76\n\nNote how none of these companies are bullshit dotcom hype companies and most of them are not even tech companies. They almost all ate shit when the bubble burst. General Electric lost like half its market cap in a year. Walmart, Exxon and Pfizer took a huge hit.\n\nNow, go down the list of S&amp;P 500 companies and look at the price to sales ratios. These companies are roughly 30% of the S&amp;P. \n\n| Company | P/S |\n| ----- | ----- |\n| Apple | 7.16 |\n| Microsoft | 13.81 |\n| Amazon | 15.33 | \n| Facebook | 10.29 |\n| Google | 8.73 |\n| Berkshire Hathaway | 1.76 |\n| Tesla | 20.58 |\n| Nvidia | 25.29 |\n| JP Morgan | 4.01 |\n| Johnson and Johnson | 4.94 |\n\nLook at this bullshit: https://www.multpl.com/s-p-500-price-to-sales They were looking a bit high before the pandemic, and during the pandemic they went from high to fucking nuts. \"Normal\" numbers are between 1 and 2 and all the companies at the top are from like 7 to 25.\n\nPrice to book has all kinds of problems but it's hard for me to hand wave away such a massive increase in such a short time. Corporate debt is eventually going to matter. https://www.multpl.com/s-p-500-price-to-book\n\nHigh P/S makes sense when pricing in growth, but how many of these companies actually going to have that growth? With the exception of Tesla, these are pretty mature companies with growing revenue. But they're priced for a *lot* of growth, not *some* growth. If that growth narrative ends up being overblown, future revenue expectations will drop, the net present value will drop, and the prices will decline and most investors will see large losses because most investors are in these companies, hence their high prices.\n\nSome of these companies have PE ratios above 60. Again, high PE ratio makes sense when pricing in growth, but these companies are already at the top of the S&amp;P.",

Apple will no doubt offer incentives to keep as much of the aps commissions as possible, then make up for any losses with their new advertising ventures. Advertising is a huge untapped resource for Apple.   Since everything else is going Apple's way, the stock is undervalued and the 3% drop is an over-reaction toon to be corrected.  I also like SWKS, both undervalued.",

Cook just disclosed 40% growth in iPads and that means every other sector of hardware is growing as never before as well.  Services may take a hit from the epic lawsuit (not right away but eventually)  but Apple has plenty of time to make up for any slowness there by growing other sectors, like advertising which it has never really exploited, but if they take a hit on video games, they can make up for it with ads.  And btw these will be ethical ads, that is no datamining.  I still see $200 within a year and SWKS is also a buy, a key Apple supplier which for no good reason is a bit beaten down.  Instreaming media, VIAC is a steal, T a bargain buy and Apple may make a  big move with an aquisition, though that would be first for them. They usually only buy small strategic companies but if they want 100+ million of streaming subs they need to buy a chunk of Hollywood and VIAC is the obvious target.",
