Missed out on huge gains over 2018 but was long gone by the time the crash happened.  Was very close to jumping back in, but glad I never did. \n\nTried to pick the bottom and catch a falling knife with SNC.  Was down -65% (almost 4K) at one point.  Kept dollar cost averaging on the way down.  And doing just fine now.",

I can't wait to see the harvest numbers next Q because if this isn't just some kind of ramp up issue and is more a systematic issue with their automation (they've already said they had to grow smaller plants than anticipated to have it play nicely with the machinery) then this is a much bigger problem.\n\nRegarding stench - Aph has had 40% and other significant runs.
