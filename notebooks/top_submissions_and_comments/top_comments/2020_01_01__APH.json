Missed out on huge gains over 2018 but was long gone by the time the crash happened.  Was very close to jumping back in, but glad I never did. \n\nTried to pick the bottom and catch a falling knife with SNC.  Was down -65% (almost 4K) at one point.  Kept dollar cost averaging on the way down.  And doing just fine now.",

Did I sell off multples of my originally investment in excess of a million dollars in realized gains, for sure as well.\n\nStaying long on APHA and Weed only as the demand is there in Canada, legal sales have to slowly increase the 10% market penetration from the black market and I feel it will, just will be slow and not as exciting as pre rec.

They also have alefias deposit looming over their heads, but that might be a while away.\n\nu/arauz07 was right along. While aph may be relatively underrated compared to bloated pigs like acb and weed, it was always relative and never as a standalone company. And the cannabis sector doesnt trade in some invisible silo. \n\nIt wasnt an accretive raise, and it actually makes you wonder just how far away they are from being operationally profitable. If they were close at all, I imagine you wouldnt see this raise. \n\nEven worse is Simon keeps referencing buying distressed assets like that's what they need. The DD ramp up should provide them with more than enough weed to execute their vision. The international landscape is years away from changing in anyway and hes reiterated getting 'Canada right's multiple times.\n\nPerhaps they wanted security in case they miss their newly stated guidance, which is also probable I believe. The raise doesn't inspire hope. What's worse is, unless you got in early like a bunch of us - you're quite fucked sitting on a stock that might not eclipse $9 anytime soon barring something major happening on a macro level. I feel for you guys with avgs in the double digits. Irwin talks a lot and a lot of what he says has no real basis in reality.  He honestly scares me as an investor.\n\nFor a company with a PB ratio of 1ish, was this deal 'fair'? I know people have been usinc their price book as a primary basis for investing. Was this deal accretive to you guys? Because using that logic, it wasn't at all.",

Their assets mean next to nothing if they are not productive and can produce a profit.  Those two should not be selling for a premium to APH...if anything, a discount.  Cannabis is the only industry where the physics of finance are ass backwards, but as more time goes on, true equilibrium will settle in.

Canopy and Aurora being even poorer ones doesn't change that fact, and that's really the only response you ever receive around here these days when you try to have a reasonable discussion about valuations.\n\nAphria does not have anywhere close to 2B in assets, so these book values often touted are complete bunk.",
