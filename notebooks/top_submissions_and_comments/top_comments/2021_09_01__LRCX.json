TSMC is building new fabs, Intel is building, GlobalFoundries is building, Samsung just announced increase in capital spending and they will profit from it in 2-3 years as this is on average how long it takes to finish a new fab. Right now the equipment makers will be the big winners on chip shortage. AMAT and LRCX are particularly undervalued. They sold off recently along with MU because they also supply DRAM equipment and there is suspicion in the industry DRAM cycle peaked. But their DRAM manufacturing equipment is less than 10% of portfolio. Moreover, new generation of DRAM goes 3D stacks which need new manufacturing equipment. So the whole industry will \ud83d\ude80",

Their Stock Advisor/Rule Breakers combo is a mere $500/year.\n\nIMO, it's good to hold some cash for buying dips. ABNB, ETSY, NFLX are a few examples from the last 6 months. \n\nSome of my favorite stocks to hold long-term (and with less volatility) are GOOG (although facing regulatory risks), AAPL, NVDA, MSFT, LRCX, SQ, and ADBE.",
