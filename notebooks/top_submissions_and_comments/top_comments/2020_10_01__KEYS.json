Not as overvalued as they seem at first glance.\n\nI thought it was cool when they hit 1t. Bonkers when they hit 2t.

He's going to have GME buy out G2A and create a marketplace for game keys, replacing GME's outdated used game sales and simultaneously making it an Amazon-esque storefront for gaming.

More or less. You get android switchers who comes back in a cycle or two. \n\nJust think about the monthly revenue from the app store, and other services. The games you play that requires a payment in game, Apple just tax those payments at 30% by providing the resourses for distributing it on the app store etc etc.\n\nThat adds up to crazy amount of revenue. The whole market evaluating their tech and expecting their downfall each and every time they release their new phones are really missing it. The whole market for the high end mobile phones only has a couple of players, and only ONE in the entire industry that holds the keys to both software, hardware eco system which includes the OS and the distribution platform. \n\nThat's not including the rest of the eco system of iPads, Apple watch, pen, Macs, air pods. These are all high margin products mind you and they are sold at a high volume. And of course they are consistently best in class or considered to be, in order to command that pricing.  \n\nIt's almost as if Apple has a tax system on almost 10% or more of the global population, extremely reliable and consistent income.

This video will get you there: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBC-nXj3Ng4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBC-nXj3Ng4)\n\nBitcoin has some extraordinary properties that make it worth hanging onto Just In Case\u2122 even if you plan on simply using it as an investment vehicle.\n\nI'm much more familiar with Bitcoin than Ethereum, but this video also explains Ethereum pretty well: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxLkbJozKbY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxLkbJozKbY)\n\nAs for actually purchasing crypto, I personally prefer Gemini: [https://gemini.com/](https://gemini.com/)\n\nI don't know how familiar you are with investing, but I'd recommend using the Gemini Exchange vs. just using the broker. Broker fees are always much higher.\n\nI'd stay away from Coinbase. They've been engaging in some shady activity for a while, and they're getting into bed with the Feds. I used them for years and made the switch this year because I hate some of their business practices.\n\nAfter purchasing on the exchange/brokerage, you have two choices: hold your coins there (like a bank) or withdraw the coins to a wallet you control. Your decision will depend on how much you're buying, how much you trust the exchange, and how much personal responsibility you're willing to take to secure the asset.\n\nIn either case, I'd recommend always keeping at least a *little* bit of your crypto in a non-custodial wallet (a wallet that you-- and *only* you-- have the private keys to.)\n\nI apologize if this was a little too much info, I get really enthusiastic when I talk about Bitcoin. :)\n\nAnd try not to let yourself feel overwhelmed. The basics of buying, selling, and transmitting crypto are actually super simple. \n\nCrypto still feels clunky and alien to us right now, just like email did to people in 1992. \n\nI am totally confident that by the end of the decade, most Americans are going to know how to set up and use a crypto wallet.",

Paypal is extremely popular in online stores and opens the door for Crypto users even if the seller doesn't plan on keeping the coin as-is\n* Following up on the previous point, if more online shopping is conducted with Crypto it will encourage adoption and makes a future where online sellers want to keep the coin rather than convert them more likely as they could replenish stock with their Crypto or make other business purchases\n\nOverall though the long-term goal is for Bitcoin / Crypto to mature enough and be user friendly so that 3rd party help isn't required. It has made impressive improvements over the last few years but I still don't trust my Mom / Dad / Others to know how to responsibly hold their keys so I'm glad that an option like this is available in the meantime.",

The newsletter I subscribe to is Stock Advisor is run by the two founders (brothers) and has a lot of variety. Some of their marketing can be over the top and click-baity, but don\u2019t pay that any mind. You could also just check out their basic stock investing book. \n\nSome keys to their philosophy are:\n\n1. You don\u2019t need to be an expert or genius to grow wealth in the market. You need to be patient and unemotional (that\u2019s harder than it sounds.)\n\n2. You actually have an advantage over professional investors such as fund managers because you have a longer time horizon for investments to pay off (3-5 years) while the pros really can\u2019t hold things that long with out seeing gains. \n\n3. They focus on buying companies, not buying stocks. They look at the brand, the ownership, the management, customer loyalty, their products, etc...\n\n4. ...and that doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t look at the technical aspects of EPS, P/E, cash flow, etc, but they place those things in context of companies themselves. \n\n5. They reinforce that you only need to be right 51% of the time to beat the market (though for me they\u2019ve been right more like 90% of the time.)\n\n6. They do recommend beginners anchor their stock investments around ETFs to start. And fuck mutual funds.\n\nYou can probably look at the track record of their picks pretty easily. I will say this, towards the beginning of the pandemic, I went in on a total of 7 new investments. Even after the last weeks major sell off, I\u2019m up 80% in 6 months for those. For reference, SPY is up about 50% from the dead bottom of the pandemic (I bought in a little above that so up more like 40% from when I bought.) And one of those companies went completely belly up (a Chinese coffee company that wasn\u2019t just brewing Java, they were cooking the books, too.) \n\nGod, I sound like I work for them, but I just have been so happy that I discovered them when I was younger (I\u2019m 48, started with them in my early 30s) I like to share my experience.",

        "body": "As long as a coin is as volatile as bitcoin it will not be sufficient replacement for the reasons you listed. However, it is an excellent store of value. That isn't the end-goal though. Stability can be achieved through a few ways:\n\n* Market saturation will eventually find us the true \"value\" of Bitcoin. Right now the value is volatile because people are onboarding / offboarding / trading where as a hypothetical future where everyone wants / has some would see far less market uncertainty. Something to keep in mind is that over 90% off all bitcoin that will ever exist has already been created. There are no more major halvenings to cause major disruption in the supply / demand like we've seen in the past. Scarcity has been established, all that is left is saturation.\n* Stable-coins that are tied to the USD (USDC, Tether, etc.) or other fiat currencies are already being used to benefit from the flexibility / durability / program-ability / etc. of crypto, without the volatility. These coins can be used for shopping, salary / income, savings, everything a normal dollar can be used for but also so much more (such as decentralized finance).\n\nThis is all off the top of my head and I'm sure you could find a more helpful source for the items above and others that I'm not creative enough to think about.\n\nSomething else to think about is the potential beyond the \"currency\" agenda. Ethereum for example is opening the door to immutable data / computation. It's still very much in the early stages but is under very active development with 2.0 being launched soon(c). \n\nMy personal favorite pipe-dream for blockchain / crypto is the decentralized file storage / distribution. Siacoin, Storj, Filecoin, etc. are all projects that I follow as I love the idea of simply renting / borrowing space from other computers around the world. If you have extra storage space on your computer just rent it out. As for renting the space for yourself it is significantly cheaper than Amazon S3 for example and some of those coins can serve as a drop-in replacement for S3 compatible applications.\n\nAnd finally something else to keep in mind are the number of \"killer apps\" and coins being announced that simply don't need the burden of a blockchain to be successful. Blockchain is certainly a .com bubble type buzzword so be prepared for a lot of projects / partnerships to fail due to hype driven decisions. But Bitcoin has definitely proven the following to me:\n\n* It's provably scarce, unlike precious metals\n* It's easily divisible, unlike precious metals\n* It's as durable as your memory, so arguably more or less durable depending on who you are and how you backup your keys\n* It is secure beyond theft (see point above about how you handle keys), more-so than precious metals outside Ft. Knox.\n* It is portable, unlike precious metals\n* It is uniform, unlike metals of varying purity\n* It is arguable more fungible than currency / precious metals, depending on how volatility affects you",

        "body": "&gt;Forgive my ignorance, if bitcoin is set aside and converted to USD through an established mainstream financial institution with connections to actual banks then how exactly is the cryptocurrency decentralized anymore? \n\nSo for starters, you are right. This specific use case isn't particularly decentralized. That said, it's important to note decentralization is in some ways a scale not an on / off switch. As well as some things don't really need to be as decentralized as others. Storing 90% of my coins I hold for long term investment - I want to be as decentralized as possible and control my own crypto (keys). Having $100 of BTC on PayPal for those once in a while purchases - I don't mind some centralization for ease of use. It's like really anything else in life, extremism in either direction often either fills a niche situations or simply isn't ideal.\n\nBut to some degree, the decentralization is still there. At the end of the day PayPal will need a wallet / wallets that account for every single BTC &amp; ETH they own. So PayPal will have the ability to say \"we hold 100,000 BTC and here is the proof we own it\". Which in some respects is impressive because they can't really do that with cash. They can say they have $X Billion in cash in their bank accounts, but no one can actually see their bank statement. We have to trust the company and their auditors. Which isn't like make or break for anyone, but a something 'neat' to see exist. And is sort of the party that gets some decentralized benefits. \n\nAnd as the other poster noted, some of this is taking baby steps to get to the end goal. The modern internet took decades to get where we are now.\n\n&gt;Furthermore, if BTC is continuously pegged to USD, and transactions are purely converting BTC to USD and USD to BTC instead of BTC to BTC, then isn't BTC just another form of traditional currency? \n\nI think you are a little confused here. First, there is no reason PayPal couldn't do BTC to BTC. My example was to 'calm the fears' of the person who really just wanted USD as the end user. At the end of the day, PayPal is loosely creating an exchange. They will have a giant pile of Cash, BTC, and ETH. Everyone on their site will have a claim to a certain amount of that. When I sent you .1BTC and you get your .1BTC, nothing on the PayPal side changes with the physical BTC in the wallets, it's just that internal ledger PayPal has that shows me now owning .1 less is changed. (Which, back to point 1, is the centralized aspect).\n\nIf your referencing my \"Stablecoins\" that are pegged to the $1, that is a whole other animal. They have mechanisms in place to stay tied to $1. I don't think you are referencing that, but if you are let me know and I can expand. BTC is like any other object, it's price is determined by the market. \n\nAs for \"Isn't just BTC another form of traditional currency\", the answer is essentially yes. And ultimately it's good that this is yes, as that is BTC's / cryptos main goal - to be come a currency. That goal short of shifted to \"Store of Value\" but that really starts to dig into the history of bitcoin and how it's user base have evolved philosophies... more of a 2 hour documentary then a Reddit post!",

With a baby and an extra sleeping space in the living room AirBNB fits a lot better than a hotel (ideally).\n\nWe found a killer looking condo in a brand new building, and the price was comparable with a hotel, but again with the added sleeping space, kitchen, room for the baby to crawl around, etc. it looked like a great deal.\n\nHowever, when we got to the building the person that was supposed to meet us with the keys told us we had to go \u2018walk\u2019 into the parking garage under the building through the exit, go deep into the parking garage and find a lockbox with the keys.  THEN we were supposed to walk through the garage entrance to the building and we\u2019re told we couldn\u2019t walk through the front lobby.  As many of you are now thinking, we\u2019re fucked.\n\nIt\u2019s already late in the evening, we\u2019ve been traveling for 14 hours (woke up at 3am to catch the flight), it\u2019s snowing out, and we have an infant.  All the other hotels are now booked solid and we have to play this one out.\n\nThe keys don\u2019t work to the downstairs so we end up calling the \u2018contact\u2019 and finally they come and show us how to get in.  We\u2019ve already been in the freezing garage for an hour.  I was literally ready to strangle the guy when he walked up.\n\nNeedless to say we were able to make it all work in the end, the condo was killer, but it was obviously not okay with the building that they were renting short terms in AirBnB.\n\nThese types of rentals are going on all over in many cities and states.  Eventually, like Uber, AirBnB is going to have to follow the laws of the land, new laws and regulations will be made, and they won\u2019t be able to keep throwing hundreds of millions battling lawsuits while they disrupt (or break laws) to turn a profit.\n\nThis is one area that absolutely hate with the business models of these upstarts.

However, I wouldn't be full on stocks that did great in the 1st round of covid in spring (like zoom) cuz people got used to this shit and there is not a lot of space to grow. Take zoom for exemple. Now everybody is using it and those who dont wont convert (like most of the universities in EU. They make their courses on MSFT Teams or GOOGLE classroom cuz Zoom is shitty). \n\nNow, here's the list:\n\n1. Retail (both online and physical): Walmart, Costco, Target, Amazon, Shopify, Etsy, Best Buy, Home Depot, Lowe's\n\n2. Construction: DR Horton, TOLL Brothers due to low interest rates \n\n3. Materials: only wood shit or lithium if you are risky af. Silver and gold suck atm but will get a boost soon due to the stimulus\n\n4. Tech, semis, comms: (carefull with the FAANGs. Might get blown if Biden wins) Crowdstrike, Telekom, Verizon, NVIDIA, Intel, AMD, Skyworks, Broadcom, Keysight, Texas Instrumets, Taiwan Semi, you get the idea. Every 5G and powerfull cyber company. \n\n5. Consumer discretionary (if you are truly a bear and life sucks in COVID, quarantine shit, depression and you dont like easy money): General Mills, Pepsi, Cola, other bullshit like this\n\n6. This is my power move: Energy: EVERY FCKING THING THAT IS RENEWABLE ENERGY. Buy an etf and it should be all good. I have a position in one since last month, up 20%. \n\n7. Video Games: EA, Activision, Sony, MSFT, Ubisoft",

Like 20x sec4 filings\n- 500mil loss in previous years was due to stock payouts to Ceo Alex and co. Looks like as if they delayed IPo so they could get more stocks.\n- Biden winning = reduction to defence budget. \n- Employees been screaming how bad company inside operates. Look up working at palantir and reviews.\n- it needs many forward deployment engineers to customize solution, very tricky to recruit one and train up. \n- it uses oracle and raptor backend, again gonna be tricky to implement and manage/expand \n- 17 years no profit. \n\nIf they do make profit - i will grab few shares and gamble.",

Jamie Dimon could be caught red handed on the Epstein private jet with a 10 year old on his lap and JPM would still shrug off the news.\n\n*The world's largest investment banks made more money in fees during the        first nine months of the year than at any point since before the 2008        financial crisis, fueled by emergency fundraisings, initial public        offerings and a rash of mergers and acquisitions activity.*\n\n*Investment banking fees soared to around $64 billion in        the first three quarters of 2020, the most lucrative start to the year        for the sector since 2007, when banks were riding high at the top of the        last M&amp;A cycle and a year before Lehman Brothers collapsed.*\n\n*Five banks -- JPMorgan        (JPM), Goldman Sachs (GS), Bank of America (BAC), Morgan        Stanley (MS) and Citigroup (C) -- accounted for around a third of        that, collectively raking in fees of $19.8 billion in the        nine months to end of September, according to data from Dealogic.*\n\n*With just three months left until the end of 2020, banks are on course        for their best year in more than a decade. Global M&amp;A volumes surged to $1        trillion over the summer, according to data provider Refinitiv        -- the best third quarter since it started tracking numbers in 1998.*\n\n*However, some lawyers and bankers cautioned that a rise in coronavirus        infections could dampen deal making.*\n\n*\"Clearly there is great momentum to this deal activity, but another        winter COVID spike (*[*https://www.marketwatch.com/*](https://www.marketwatch.com/)*story/who-warns-of-serious-situation-unfolding-in-europe-as-covid-19-cases-climb-11600428004)        with further lockdowns could slow the pace and push deals into 2021,\"        said Frank Aquila, global head of M&amp;A at international        law firm Sullivan &amp; Cromwell.*\n\n*Eamon Brabazon, co-head of EMEA M&amp;A at Bank of America,        said there was an \"underlying fragility and nervousness\" that something        akin to a significant second COVID wave could happen. \"If so, we would        expect the recent positive learnings around virtual processes would mean        that any impact on M&amp;A would be less acute than otherwise\"*\n\n*Equity capital markets bankers were kept busy, as a stampede of        companies took advantage of the rapid recovery in capital markets to        sell their shares, with fees soaring by 73% on last year to $18.8        billion. So far this year, IPOs have raised $135.5 billion        globally, 56% of which was unveiled in the third quarter, with health        care, technology and blank-check companies*\n\n*Martin Steinbach, EY EMEIA global leader, said the demand for        IPOs was being driven by investors looking for returns in a low interest        rate environment. \"If equity stories, management and balanced pricing        are met -- we predict this will bring a strong close to 2020,\" he said,        adding that the trend could accelerate as multinationals look to spin        off divisions to focus on core businesses.*\n\n*A series of emergency fundraisings by companies looking to shore up        their finances when the pandemic hit in March also provided a big payday        for debt capital markets bankers. DCM fees have surged by nearly 30% in        the same period in 2019, to $22.9 billion.*\n\n*Among those raising hundreds of billions of dollars were computer        technology company Oracle (ORCL) ($20 billion), U.S.        oil major Exxon Mobil (XOM) ($8.5 billion), and the        world's largest brewer Anheuser-Busch InBev (ABI.BT) ($5.0 billion).*\n\n*The resurgence of activity across all areas of investment banking will        come as a relief to bankers, as M&amp;A deal making and IPOs ground to a        halt  at the height of the pandemic in March and April.*\n\n*\"For the next 12 to 18 months the investment banking wallet opportunity        looks buoyant, but the product mix will adjust,\" said Philip        Drury, head of banking, capital markets and advisory for EMEA,        at Citigroup.*\n\n*However, despite the recent spike in M&amp;A, the total value of global deal        making for the first nine months of 2020 is $ 2.1 trillion        -- 21% lower than it was during the same period last year.*\n\n*Volumes were boosted by a wave of megadeals across sectors and        geographies, as companies sought to become bigger and more diversified        to help them weather the pandemic.*\n\n*These included Gilead Sciences's $20 billion takeover of        biopharmaceutical company Immunomedics and Nvidia's $40 billion    acquisition of U.K.-based        chip designer Arm from Japan's        SoftBank Group, whichhas helped spur a huge uptick in deal making over        the summer.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*The Americas        almost doubled activity in the third quarter compared with the same        period last year, while Europe        is still lagging, recording just $232 billion of deals in        the third quarter, a 3.5% fall on the same period in 2019.*\n\n*\"M&amp;A activity in Europe        will follow the U.S.,\"        said Javier Oficialdegui, co-head of global banking at UBS        (UBS). \" Every single sector and market needs to restructure in one way        or another because of COVID-19 and we expect a big uptick in activity        over the coming quarters.\"*\n\n*Activity in the region is also expected to pick up once the final Brexit        terms       are known and the consequences are understood. \"Then we can expect to        see a significant number of European deals as companies inside and        outside the EU seek to realign based on the new economic reality,\" said        Sullivan &amp; Cromwell's Aquila.*\n\n*Technology deals have surged this year, accounting for 16.9% of overall        activity -- or $377 billion -- compared with to 11% in        2019, as companies look to capitalize on their record valuations and use        their stock to become dominant players in emerging sectors.*\n\n*\"There is a lot of momentum going into year-end. Europe        is at the epicenter. When you look at the pipeline of deals into 2021,        we see a material year-on-year uplift,\" said Brabazon.*\n\n*-Lina Saigol; 415-439-6400;* [*AskNewswires@dowjones.com*](mailto:AskNewswires@dowjones.com)\n\n*(END) Dow Jones Newswires   10-01-20 1331ET*",

They'll do a lot of data cleaning since a lot of what they're bringing in is probably garbage, and they'll set up a repeatable process for loading, managing and monitoring what they've built.\n\n2) A data analysis GUI. Basically a combination of data visualization and predictive analysis that's been simplified for someone who doesn't code. So far this almost completely customized for specific use cases depending on customer.\n\nI see a couple problems:\n\n1) This is how they've worked their way into organizations so far, but it's also been completely duplicated by every major cloud service provider and legacy database provider. I see them having a hard time proving their value over the major players like AWS, Azure, GCP, IBM, Oracle and SAP in this area.\n\n2) Once a company has chosen someone for step 1, they can now choose any analytics tool. I know Palantir has built a reputation as having some magic predictive power, but in reality, there are a limited number of algorithms that are useful for any given problem, and they're all going to be built in as options for any tool now that they pretty much just incorporate the best open source solution. I don't see them beating out Tableau, PowerBI, Adobe Sensei, Alteryx, Kibana, etc. in this space.\n\nMaybe I'm wrong, but they've had Foundry out for a few years now, and it has a few dozen customers. I would think if it were a clearly superior product, that would be much higher. It basically seems to only be useful for customers who are willing to pay for a completely customized interface, which I think will be a hard sell for most businesses.",

        "body": "I track the total index as well. I am also comfortable risking a minimal amount of captial on more speculative plays, like those surrounding disruptive innovation. This means any technology that has the potential but not the guarantee to shake up current industry. Especially if that technology is not yet polished or proven, because refinement can come in time and it likely will as long as the medium provides for greater access, better utilization, and/or further propagation of ideas. \n\nTake the internet as whole. It was initially discounted, it lacked polish or proof of validity over the long term and yet today it is indispensable to nearly everyone. Take the evolution of the blog, which at first was ridiculed and said to be unreliable and immature, but now provides a medium rich in information and validity. \n\nThese things take time. I am happy to allocate a small percentage of my equity to these ideas. All I need is one of 30 to hit big and my assumed risk will be rewarded. \n\nI would never advocate for putting an individuals entire networth into these types of funds, but I think it is irresponsible to discount the possibility of success based on a fear of failure or outmoded models of allocation that in all reasonable assessment have been behind the curve of innovation. \n\nI can see clear upside in technologies surround genomics and financial technology, for instance. Let's take traditional banking as an example. This system regularly cuts out access to large portions of the global population based in numerous factors, such as physical or geographical lack of access, or because they are deemed too risky to take on, or because of structural bias against subsets of the population. \n\nIf a disruptive technology comes along like SQ that offers greater access and mobility of capital accross populations and classes, it makes sense that they will attract and retain users on a more rapid scale than traditional firms. That creates a sustained competitive advantage, and if the firm is able to build consumer loyalty it will be difficult to wrench the consumer away unless another firm can provide adequate economic incentives for the customer to switch. \n\nSustaining this advantage can be done by creating a sticky business model, like IMB did in the past (we know how that turned out) or Oracle does currently (this has yet to play out, but I would argue without a fundamental shift in philosophy Oracle will continue to lose marketshare to their more innovative competitors), or by building an innovation stack that can rapid respond to a dynamic marketplace and continually create value for the consumer (Amazon, for instance). \n\nRarely do entrenched businesses have a culture or leadership team that can rapidly respond to these disruptions in a way that can effectively recapture lost market share. I am absolutely willing to take a small bet on the increased prevalence of Zillow or Open Door, for instance, because I can see that the current firms surrounding housing sales have not adapted to shifting market demands very effectively. They are entrenched, archaic, and tedious to deal with; in contrast, Zillow provides a much smoother and friendly experience in searching for and procuring a new home. So much so that these more traditional firms have largely begun to utilize the platform to serve their own ends. This makes it easier for Zillow to leverage the competition to their advantage and further disrupt the traditional business model. \n\nOf course, there are local, state, and federal regulatory hurdles to be managed, but over time the efficiency of captial markets will favor the most innovative and accessible firms over the more entrenched and laggard ones. \n\nIn summary, taking on a small amount of risk in emerging technologies often leads to greater returns on capital than the conservative and traditional methodology of 60, 40 \"safe\" equity and bonds. That isn't to say an individual should fully embrace that risk, but it is prudent invest in all potential outcomes with varying allocation based on individual preferences for risk. \n\nTime will tell.",

        "body": "Active management isn't necessarily a money losing proposition, it's just that you face an additional headwind.\n\nFrom 1993 to present, the market (represented by SPY, which we can invest in) has returned 9.67% annually. Therefore, we can say that 9.67% is the return generated by all active management strategies, before fees. Once you add in fees, say 1%, then active management in total should have provided a return of 8.67% annually.\n\nOf course, there have been underperformers and overperformers during that time period. The question is whether you can spot the over performers before they over perform, and if you can avoid the under-performers. It's not that easy - here's a [Barron's](https://www.barrons.com/articles/3-big-actively-managed-mutual-funds-that-are-beating-the-s-p-500-51573842353) article from last year pointing out that at that time, only 3 of 20 mutual funds they were following were beating the market.\n\nWe've all heard the stories about how the average investor in Peter Lynchs Magellan Fund (one of the best performing funds ever) had a [negative experience](https://www.alphawealthfunds.com/2019/08/the-average-investor-lost-money-in-the-best-performing-mutual-fund-in-history/) on average due to performance chasing - they would see it's end of year numbers and after good years, they would jump in hoping for a repeat of that experience, and after years that it did poorly, they would exit. Their search for the best active return did a number on their portfolio.\n\nAnd even now - we all know Warren Buffett as the Oracle of Omaha, and he also has an unparalleled track record. Except for the last 10 years, where Berkshire has also been trailing the market. There's plenty of other examples of this phenomenon.\n\nThat's the risk of active management. You can only see what their track record has been until now, and have no idea what the future will provide.\n\nFor myself, I own some ARKW (1.31% of my portfolio), and also own Sequoia Fund (SEQUX - 5.42%), but also have 7.5% in QQQ and 12% in SPYX.\n\nSequoia has a long track record, going through many economic cycles, but with that said, they have lagged the last 5 years. Fidelity's Contrafund is another example of a fund with a very long track record that has done well relative to the market.  But that said, history is full of actively managed funds that have failed to generate better return that the markets, but the mutual fund companies work overtime to make sure we don't see them - failing funds are merged with more successful funds or just closed altogether, making it much more difficult to find old data on them - it's called survivorship bias.\n\nWhat i do know is that the ARK funds have all done very well, the question is whether they will continue to shine in whatever the next phase of our economy actually is.",

        "body": "sure do! so boiling it down as simply as I can, I would say their main differentiator is for client facing sides of the software, with Salesforce being the best, followed by oracle, which needs a lot of tuning, and then SAP is great for enterprise companies that don't need client facing software. SAP is lame. It can be a powerful tool but it's just god awful to look at.  \n\n\nI will note that there is a ceiling on all of this, and at some point your business needs will force you to go totally custom built on one of those platforms, and by then it depends more on 3rd party vendor pricing, whatever deal you can get from them, and extras where you can save, such as Saleforce's marketplace of apps that you can add. Things like that add a TON of value for Salesforce where you can save money on custom dev by adding prebuilt software and skinning it, as well as Salesforce Trailhead training program absolutely smashes the competition as far as getting teams up to speed on transition.",
