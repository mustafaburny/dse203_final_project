It\u2019s also the fact that they hold the keys to the App Store and have an ever growing network of services they monetize.\n\nApple is overvalued. How overvalued I don\u2019t know. Not as overvalued as they seem at first glance.\n\nI thought it was cool when they hit 1t. Bonkers when they hit 2t. But nobody cares about my opinion.\n\nIt\u2019s not that surprising that a US company has the marketcap of the top 100 UK firms. It\u2019s not 1820. There is no East India company. The UK has less people, less capital, and hasn\u2019t benefited from the pro capitalist policies of the US for the last however many years. \n\nTLDR: typing \u201cMurica\u201d on my iPhone",

More or less. You get android switchers who comes back in a cycle or two. \n\nJust think about the monthly revenue from the app store, and other services. The games you play that requires a payment in game, Apple just tax those payments at 30% by providing the resourses for distributing it on the app store etc etc.\n\nThat adds up to crazy amount of revenue. The whole market evaluating their tech and expecting their downfall each and every time they release their new phones are really missing it. The whole market for the high end mobile phones only has a couple of players, and only ONE in the entire industry that holds the keys to both software, hardware eco system which includes the OS and the distribution platform. \n\nThat's not including the rest of the eco system of iPads, Apple watch, pen, Macs, air pods. These are all high margin products mind you and they are sold at a high volume. And of course they are consistently best in class or considered to be, in order to command that pricing.  \n\nIt's almost as if Apple has a tax system on almost 10% or more of the global population, extremely reliable and consistent income. With no need for them to cut corners or reduce their profit margins.\n\nOf course feel free to rebut me, after all I'm typing this out on the go on a cracked android device with two thumbs.

Paypal is extremely popular in online stores and opens the door for Crypto users even if the seller doesn't plan on keeping the coin as-is\n* Following up on the previous point, if more online shopping is conducted with Crypto it will encourage adoption and makes a future where online sellers want to keep the coin rather than convert them more likely as they could replenish stock with their Crypto or make other business purchases\n\nOverall though the long-term goal is for Bitcoin / Crypto to mature enough and be user friendly so that 3rd party help isn't required. It has made impressive improvements over the last few years but I still don't trust my Mom / Dad / Others to know how to responsibly hold their keys so I'm glad that an option like this is available in the meantime.",

        "body": "Okay my comment was removed because I mentioned a failed investment. I have edited my comment. \n\nYou will not be disappointed. The newsletter I subscribe to is Stock Advisor is run by the two founders (brothers) and has a lot of variety. Some of their marketing can be over the top and click-baity, but don\u2019t pay that any mind. You could also just check out their basic stock investing book. \n\nSome keys to their philosophy are:\n\n1. You don\u2019t need to be an expert or genius to grow wealth in the market. You need to be patient and unemotional (that\u2019s harder than it sounds.)\n\n2. You actually have an advantage over professional investors such as fund managers because you have a longer time horizon for investments to pay off (3-5 years) while the pros really can\u2019t hold things that long with out seeing gains. \n\n3. They focus on buying companies, not buying stocks. They look at the brand, the ownership, the management, customer loyalty, their products, etc...\n\n4. ...and that doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t look at the technical aspects of EPS, P/E, cash flow, etc, but they place those things in context of companies themselves. \n\n5. They reinforce that you only need to be right 51% of the time to beat the market (though for me they\u2019ve been right more like 90% of the time.)\n\n6. They do recommend beginners anchor their stock investments around ETFs to start. And fuck mutual funds.\n\nYou can probably look at the track record of their picks pretty easily. I will say this, towards the beginning of the pandemic, I went in on a total of 7 new investments. Even after the last weeks major sell off, I\u2019m up 80% in 6 months for those. For reference, SPY is up about 50% from the dead bottom of the pandemic (I bought in a little above that so up more like 40% from when I bought.) And one of those companies went completely belly up (a Chinese coffee company that wasn\u2019t just brewing Java, they were cooking the books, too.) \n\nGod, I sound like I work for them, but I just have been so happy that I discovered them when I was younger (I\u2019m 48, started with them in my early 30s) I like to share my experience.",

With a baby and an extra sleeping space in the living room AirBNB fits a lot better than a hotel (ideally).\n\nWe found a killer looking condo in a brand new building, and the price was comparable with a hotel, but again with the added sleeping space, kitchen, room for the baby to crawl around, etc. it looked like a great deal.\n\nHowever, when we got to the building the person that was supposed to meet us with the keys told us we had to go \u2018walk\u2019 into the parking garage under the building through the exit, go deep into the parking garage and find a lockbox with the keys.  THEN we were supposed to walk through the garage entrance to the building and we\u2019re told we couldn\u2019t walk through the front lobby.  As many of you are now thinking, we\u2019re fucked.\n\nIt\u2019s already late in the evening, we\u2019ve been traveling for 14 hours (woke up at 3am to catch the flight), it\u2019s snowing out, and we have an infant.  All the other hotels are now booked solid and we have to play this one out.\n\nThe keys don\u2019t work to the downstairs so we end up calling the \u2018contact\u2019 and finally they come and show us how to get in.  We\u2019ve already been in the freezing garage for an hour.  I was literally ready to strangle the guy when he walked up.\n\nNeedless to say we were able to make it all work in the end, the condo was killer, but it was obviously not okay with the building that they were renting short terms in AirBnB.\n\nThese types of rentals are going on all over in many cities and states.  Eventually, like Uber, AirBnB is going to have to follow the laws of the land, new laws and regulations will be made, and they won\u2019t be able to keep throwing hundreds of millions battling lawsuits while they disrupt (or break laws) to turn a profit.\n\nThis is one area that absolutely hate with the business models of these upstarts.  Imagine I open up a business in your field and don\u2019t follow any of the rules but just fight everything in courts and pay fines while you follow the rules and I break them.  As publicly traded companies this is going to have to get cleaned up.",

Now everybody is using it and those who dont wont convert (like most of the universities in EU. They make their courses on MSFT Teams or GOOGLE classroom cuz Zoom is shitty). \n\nNow, here's the list:\n\n1. Retail (both online and physical): Walmart, Costco, Target, Amazon, Shopify, Etsy, Best Buy, Home Depot, Lowe's\n\n2. Construction: DR Horton, TOLL Brothers due to low interest rates \n\n3. Materials: only wood shit or lithium if you are risky af. Silver and gold suck atm but will get a boost soon due to the stimulus\n\n4. Tech, semis, comms: (carefull with the FAANGs. Might get blown if Biden wins) Crowdstrike, Telekom, Verizon, NVIDIA, Intel, AMD, Skyworks, Broadcom, Keysight, Texas Instrumets, Taiwan Semi, you get the idea. Every 5G and powerfull cyber company. \n\n5. Consumer discretionary (if you are truly a bear and life sucks in COVID, quarantine shit, depression and you dont like easy money): General Mills, Pepsi, Cola, other bullshit like this\n\n6. This is my power move: Energy: EVERY FCKING THING THAT IS RENEWABLE ENERGY. Buy an etf and it should be all good. I have a position in one since last month, up 20%. \n\n7.
