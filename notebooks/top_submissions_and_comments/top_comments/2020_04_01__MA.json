Just the tip, lmao, am I right, famma-lam?\n\nBut before we get started, make sure to *smaaaaaaash* that Like button, tap the ass of that Subscribe button, and ring that notification bell. [Doorbell chime sound.]\n\nToday\u2019s stock of the day is an old-school stock called Enron. A lot of old ass motherfuckers used to make bank on this shit in the late 90s and the early 2000s, I guess during the Vietnam War or some shit. Anyway, this shit was lit, they had dope ass energy products and MA BOI Kenneth Lay is the CEO! His fucking last name is **LAY**! So you know my boi KL lays more pipe than just oil pipelines. He\u2019s probably getting *all* the Dallas Cowboy cheerleaders pregnant.\n\nSo that brings us to tip 2. Before you invest in a company, always look at the CEO. If he looks like a fuckin\u2019 nerd, **left swipe that bitch**. But if he\u2019s a dope-ass motherfucker with a bangin\u2019 name? Back up the truck, and get ready to make a buck.\n\nAlright that\u2019s all the tips I got for you right now. I\u2019mma bout to to hit the bong and trade some Tesla and Carnival Cruise options.\n\nAnd don\u2019t forget to sign up for Battle Legends using my affiliate code. You\u2019ll get 65,000 gold coins.

Or maybe that was some later old conspiratorial white dude.  Anyway, no longer backed by a tangible asset, but rather by the \"faith and credit\" of the US, we started using money that couldn't be turned into gold.\n\nHas the same thing happened with stocks?  Earnings aren't here yet, and who knows what the damage is to the companies traded, but have we silently, through ma and pop retail investors, indexes, fed pumping, etc., also changed the stock market to fiat stocks where my shares of SPY have nothing to do with the value of the underlying companies, and everything to do with the \"faith and credit\" of the good ole Ameri-cone dream?  \n\nSeriously, is there any other way to explain the behavior of the markets lately?  Fiat stocks.  Think about it.",

Will have to keep a close eye on those last 5 before jumping in. \n\nPlus a bunch will go in ETFs: 1/3 in QQQ (tech heavy, tracks to NASDAQ), 1/3 in MTUM (tracks to S&amp;P movers), 1/3 in LGLV (large cap low volatility).

Do you think prices will get back down to those levels?

Exp: 4/9 Reason I did a spread and not naked was due to lack of capital at time being.\n\nI'm new to TA but wanted to try using what seem to be the most intuitive indicators for me - RSI, VWAP, and 50/200 MA.\n\n**My DD**\n\nWhen I entered the position, RSI seemed good but has gone up to 56 now, so that's got me a little bit worried.\n\nHowever, APT has crossed and come over the 50MA line 3 times in the last 5 days, which I read now as a support rather than a distance. It has also directly bounced off the 200MA which is good to see as well.\n\nMarket EOD was $18.xx or so, but VWAP is around $15\\~. Perhaps a good entry tomorrow for a long position will be if it returns to VWAP, but regarding the explosiveness and nature of the stock I'm also debating just buying ASAP with expiry for next week.\n\nAs for the strike price I'm looking at, I'm looking at around $25/26, which is where it peaked last time in early march.\n\n**Sentiment** \\- Talks about Americans getting used to the idea of having to wear masks. The thing is 3M, DuPont, etc. make PPE (personal protection equipment) but really APT has been sort of the front man of that for a while now. \n\nWith fear going to spike up again this week, I think it'll be good to get in and take a long. Plus volume was only 20 million today, so hasn't been \"discovered\" by the media yet. \n\nAny tips/advice for a newbie would be very beneficial.",

Get out before the turn.\nEven my 10-40 sma crossover gives false signals.\nObviously, the goal is to ride some wave higher.  It's coming today or next week, but this week, using this method is a bust.\nI bought a 5% position in SSO Wednesday at a crossover signal (~2500), but ended up holding it vs selling on a down signal.  I did that because I knew price would cover back to this level.  Then, as prices hit the 78.6% retracement, I added another 5%.  O added a third 5% on another retracement Thursday.\nI held these 3 positions until Thursday pm.  Sold for $2000 gain.\n\nSo it was a combination of...\n1. Moving average crossover entry.\n2. Dollar cost averaging on retracements.\n3. Fib levels for entry.\n4. Double top level for exit (Thursday high).\n\nA lot more work than the casual investor is looking for.

        "body": "Reasonable options, but they all have notable downfalls.\n\nOne of the big ones is that a centralized blockchain will never suffice to replace something like Visa.\n\nThe current international transaction rate of credit cards peaks around 25,000 per second (christmas eve of 2019) combining major brands (visa, mastercard, etc)\n\nCash is probably significantly higher than that worldwide.\n\nFor a currency to \"replace\" money or credit cards or banks, as the long-term stated goal of crypto enthusiasts, it has to scale to numbers on the order of thousands of transactions per second.\n\nBitcoin, Zcash and Monero as they are designed, are all fundamentally centralized public blockchains that implement various forms of anonymization for wallet transactions.  \n\nHowever, in reality, it's probably not practical for all nodes to know about all transactions everywhere in the world at all times.   That requirement fundamentally means that every node everywhere has to constantly consume 5-20mbps of incoming transaction data, 24/7/365 and that's assuming no significant growth in transaction volumes.\n\nEven with aggressive pruning of transactions, the volume of data to accurately summarize the net worth of 7 billion people plus their various businesses, teams, organizations, accounts and otherwise would be extraordinary (trillions of transactions, at least - possibly a petabyte of data).\n\nIn the current blockchain concept, any transactions that have any significant notable value to the network have to be recorded on this chain, or they can't be verified.  Concepts like lightening network on bitcoin can \"shard\" some of this off, but these side transactions are fundamentally unverified, and the money used in them is fundamentally locked out of the main wallet of anyone using these channels, making them practical for certain activities (say, buying some gum), but impractical for something like transacting your rent, or any other dollar value that you value.\n\nSome concepts of more broad global sharding of the main chain exist, but under \"proof of work\" that doesn't really work well without establishing \"trusted nodes\" to referee the sharding and that doesn't make the decentralization proponents happy.\n\nIt's probably possible to design something, maybe using a proof of stake system with stakeholders pooled into smaller shards, but that runs a greater risk of having network takeovers, unless you have a referee system that patrols for large movements of stakeholders into shards in order to pool stakes and subvert the voting system for monetary gain.\n\nIt's not a solved problem and no platform currently exists that could plausibly take over world currency transactions, or even a smaller credit card player like Discover, in terms of size and volume.\n\nProof of work, in my opinion, is a poor tech and while I play in crypto as a speculative instrument, I view it like a penny stock in a worthless industry from a true fundamentals perspective.\n\nBut that's just my educated opinion.",
