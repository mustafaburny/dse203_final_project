Had been hesitant to invest because the market seemed bloated, but now could be a good time to get in. \n\nNo debt, getting married in next 12 months, buying house in next 12-18 months. Will keep funds for wedding, down payment, closing costs, furniture/upgrades and 6 month emergency fund as cash. \n\nSeparate from those funds, my financial picture is basically 1/3 401k (target date fund), and 2/3 cash. I want to put that cash in the market over the next few weeks/months. Here's what I'm thinking:\n\n\\- Reallocate 401k to more growth oriented funds to ride back up over the next couple years. \n\n\\- Invest the cash 50% in ETFs, 50% in individual stocks. \n\n\\- ETFs: 1/3 QQQ (tech heavy, tracks to NASDAQ), 1/3 MTUM (momentum companies, mainly S&amp;P), 1/3 LGLV (large cap low volatility, mainly DJI). I feel like these 3 give a good swath of the market while being able to outperform it. \n\n\\- Sotcks:  5 low risk: AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, MA, V. 5 medium risk: SBUX, MCD, JPM, DEO, DIS. 5 higher risk: MGM, SYY, YUM, MAR, FANG. Will have to keep a close eye on those last 5 before jumping in. \n\nQuestions:\n\n\\- It's best to keep my down payment and emergency fund as cash, right? Will need it in 12-18 months. \n\n\\- What do you think of those ETFs/Stocks? Both overall allocation and individual picks?\n\n\\- Other things I should be investing in other than stock market? \n\nAppreciate it folks!",

Exp: 4/9 Reason I did a spread and not naked was due to lack of capital at time being.\n\nI'm new to TA but wanted to try using what seem to be the most intuitive indicators for me - RSI, VWAP, and 50/200 MA.\n\n**My DD**\n\nWhen I entered the position, RSI seemed good but has gone up to 56 now, so that's got me a little bit worried.\n\nHowever, APT has crossed and come over the 50MA line 3 times in the last 5 days, which I read now as a support rather than a distance. It has also directly bounced off the 200MA which is good to see as well.\n\nMarket EOD was $18.xx or so, but VWAP is around $15\\~. Perhaps a good entry tomorrow for a long position will be if it returns to VWAP, but regarding the explosiveness and nature of the stock I'm also debating just buying ASAP with expiry for next week.\n\nAs for the strike price I'm looking at, I'm looking at around $25/26, which is where it peaked last time in early march.\n\n**Sentiment** \\- Talks about Americans getting used to the idea of having to wear masks. The thing is 3M, DuPont, etc. make PPE (personal protection equipment) but really APT has been sort of the front man of that for a while now. \n\nWith fear going to spike up again this week, I think it'll be good to get in and take a long. Plus volume was only 20 million today, so hasn't been \"discovered\" by the media yet. \n\nAny tips/advice for a newbie would be very beneficial.",

That requirement fundamentally means that every node everywhere has to constantly consume 5-20mbps of incoming transaction data, 24/7/365 and that's assuming no significant growth in transaction volumes.\n\nEven with aggressive pruning of transactions, the volume of data to accurately summarize the net worth of 7 billion people plus their various businesses, teams, organizations, accounts and otherwise would be extraordinary (trillions of transactions, at least - possibly a petabyte of data).\n\nIn the current blockchain concept, any transactions that have any significant notable value to the network have to be recorded on this chain, or they can't be verified.  Concepts like lightening network on bitcoin can \"shard\" some of this off, but these side transactions are fundamentally unverified, and the money used in them is fundamentally locked out of the main wallet of anyone using these channels, making them practical for certain activities (say, buying some gum), but impractical for something like transacting your rent, or any other dollar value that you value.\n\nSome concepts of more broad global sharding of the main chain exist, but under \"proof of work\" that doesn't really work well without establishing \"trusted nodes\" to referee the sharding and that doesn't make the decentralization proponents happy.\n\nIt's probably possible to design something, maybe using a proof of stake system with stakeholders pooled into smaller shards, but that runs a greater risk of having network takeovers, unless you have a referee system that patrols for large movements of stakeholders into shards in order to pool stakes and subvert the voting system for monetary gain.\n\nIt's not a solved problem and no platform currently exists that could plausibly take over world currency transactions, or even a smaller credit card player like Discover, in terms of size and volume.\n\nProof of work, in my opinion, is a poor tech and while I play in crypto as a speculative instrument, I view it like a penny stock in a worthless industry from a true fundamentals perspective.\n\nBut that's just my educated opinion.",

        "body": "Here\u2019s my analysis of the market from a technical and fundamental perspective. On the TA side, the stochastic momentum indicator on the daily candlestick chart is showing that bullish momentum is slowing down. Furthermore, the more damning indications are the fact that the S&amp;P failed to break above the 20 daily MA when reaching it and also failed to break through the 38.2% fib retracement level at 2640 at least three separate times which was also where Friday\u2019s high was around. \n\nFrom the fundamental side I believe that focus is shifting from the stimulus bill and relief actions(which was a big driver in last week\u2019s gains) and the market will instead start pricing in the rapidly growing amount of COVID cases as well as the extended lockdown of the economy. This will only be exacerbated once financial reports start coming out for companies and the true damage is revealed. We also have the weekly jobless claims report tm(with a projected figure of 4 million) and the unemployment rate on Friday(which is projected to be around 3.7%). I believe that all of this will drive price down to test the lows and possibly break below them. Things are only gonna get worse for at least a month but we may start seeing a recovery at the end of April or in May. This is just my analysis though, if anyone wants to chime in with their own opinion I\u2019d love to hear it!",

Google --- (Obvious choice with TONS of cash, tons of free cash flow and, more importantly, a business model that will survive the test of time). Premarket, it looks like the price is about $1,126.00. (I like to see this one at $1000, or below, but I've been nibbling on down days. \n\n2.  Amazon --- (Another pick where they have a solid balance sheet and continue to do business is in this tumultuous environment. I think bricks and mortar retail, outside of pharmacies, grocery stores, auto parts stores and few others, are going to be in big trouble unless there is a bailout --- Amazon will benefit from this and I've been buying on down days WHEN the stock is sub $1750. (It hit below this number twice since we have been having these crashes)\n\n3. Facebook --- (Another one with an unreal balance sheet, like Google. I've been adding to this name when it dips below $150.00 BUT at $162 premarket, I may add some more today)\n\n4. Skyworks / Qualcomm --- Both are solid, necessary companies, especially in mobile / 5G. I've been buying Qualcomm at below $70 and Skyworks below $80. Skyworks has ZERO debt and Qualcomm, as we all know, is a powerhouse of a company that most phone companies use: (LG, Samsung, Google, Oppo, Nokia, Apple (Verizon phones), etc...) this company isn't going anywhere and I would start to nibble on what looks to be a red day today!\n\n5. CVS Pharmacy --- This company has huge potential stock growth because they just acquired Aetna health insurance. They also have the brick and mortar CVS stores, along with the minuteclinics AND they have a PBM (Caremark) which negotiates lower drug prices for consumers and large companies. They are well diversified and have serious stock appreciation potential, even during these tough times, because there really is nowhere else to shop for goods, outside of Amazon and Grocery stores, PLUS everyone needs health insurance, which CVS offers through the recently acquired Aetna arm!\n\nGood luck today and happy investing --- for the long term!",
