Only about 6,000 companies are public and the *biggest* 500 (or so) compromise the SPY. \n\nAre you seeing where this is going yet? You all are shorting the 500 companies *that are best positioned to, not only survive this, but THRIVE in the post-corona economy.* They have the best capital access, the best size, the best market position....I can keep going. The companies that comprise the SPY are going to survive, particularly the top ~100 or so that comprise 80% of the SPY action.\n\nWhat the fuck are you retards thinking shorting those companies?? Why the fuck are you ***SHOCKED*** you are losing money? WSB: \u201cSee that ETF that is comprised of the companies best positioned to go up?I\u2019m betting my life savings on Puts.\u201d If one of my analysts came to me with that thesis, I\u2019d assume they had brain damage and fire them. \n\nThere are *obvious* shorts out there. I\u2019m not giving specific names but first off, get the fuck away from large caps and start thinking about S/Mid caps that service those 12M operating companies that are fucking hating it right now.\n\nYou people getting lit on SPY puts are getting *exactly* what you should have expected.",

Send 2,500 a tip about that stock going down.\n\nBoom.  Now, as far as 2,500 people are concerned, you've hit two times in a row.  Do this one more time: two more groups of 1,250 each with \"advice\" about another stock.  You get down to a group that thinks you've hit three miracle stock picks in a row.\n\nFinally, to cash in on your little scam, you tell that final group that you have a fourth hot tip, but you cannot give your services away for free forever...\n\nNow, obviously it is possible to look up Goldman Sachs and see their past predictions, but it's funny how we tend to over-value the times people guess shit correctly and assign those predictions too much weight in our memories.",

In addition the vaccine news seems disappointing thus far. An 8-person study on the Moderna vaccine is meaningless when so many hurdles lie between that and eventually administering billions of doses to the general population. It\u2019s like the difference between a baby taking his first steps and Usain Bolt running the 100m. \n\nAnother issue is vaccine safety. Medications that take years to develop and look great in phase 3 can turn out to be quite horrible once distributed. Take Fen-Phen and Vioxx for example. There\u2019s going to be a lot of caution about administering a vaccine that only has months of safety data. I\u2019m a proponent of vaccination. But I would be nervous about receiving something in December that was conceived in January. This is assuming a vaccine can even be made.\n\nI don\u2019t know much about how this virus will evolve either. I trust the experts who say it will persist. So I take the persistence of the virus, the lack of a clear treatment/vaccine potential, and most of all, our government\u2019s poor response as reasons to be in cash for a while. The environment seems uncertain and dangerous for now.",

It is because the rest of the world is even more fucked. Japan is in its 4th lost decade. China was heading to recession before this from the largest credit build up in world history. Euro zone is on the verge of fracturing with a banking system that makes us during 2008 seem sane. Emerging markets is completely and utterly fucked for the next 10 years due to capital outflows and the inability to engage in stimulus without making their currency go to zero, global trade shrinking before covid and many countries such as Mexico and Brazil were already in recession.\n\nBasically the world is going to burn for the next 10 years and the us is the safest place to put your money. If you are going to short, you should short like London commerical RE or HK developers, or Brazilian retailers, not cash rich us large corporate or tech companies.

I used to fly 200k miles per year and had all the expenses that came along with that - flights, rental cars, hotels, meals for myself and entertaining clients.  But honestly a lot of it was just built on old traditions and wasn't/isn't necessary.  I am seeing early signs that the younger generation (40-50 y/o) of execs is using coronavirus as a way to make 80% WFH and virtual meetings permanent.  It's becoming much easier to measure performance and impact quantitatively now whereas before it was largely based on travel schedule and face time (both of which involved so much wasted time/time lost).  If the top banks, consulting companies, and tech companies adopt a 2-3 day/week WFH policy as standard then the rest of the corporate world has to follow.  It will be interesting to watch.",
