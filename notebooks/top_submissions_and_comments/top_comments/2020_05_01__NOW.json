Apple and Nvidia seems to be slowing down now waiting for competitors to catch up but they were going ham on generational improvements. We will soon see what Nvidia has up their sleeve with Ampere as AMD starts catching up on the GPU front as well. AMD single handily put a fire in both the CPU and GPU industries previously dominated by Intel and Nvidia, and now they are starting to haul ass. I wouldn\u2019t count out Intel yet because yesterday\u2019s announcement was the first competitive move that Intel has done in a long time. Yes it lowers their margins, but this move to drastically lower price and enable previously locked features like hyper-thread on their lower end chips will definitely help to take back some of the market share from AMD. We will see what comes with 7NM.",

        "body": "Wow, you got pretty heated buddy.  \n\n\nSales are declining now because we're at the end of the console cycle. I expect them to boom this holiday season and we have evidence for that below:\n\n *\"The Company\u2019s comparable store sales for the nine-week period ended April 4, 2020, declined approximately 23% on a year-over-year basis, which includes the impact of the majority of stores closed in most operating countries throughout the fiscal month of March.*\n\n* *In the fiscal March period ended March 21, 2020, the date when the Company closed its stores to customer access,* ***comparable U.S. store sales grew approximately 3% as the Company experienced a surge in demand across products that people need to work, learn or play from home.***\u00a0\n* ***For the five-week fiscal March period, Australia posted comparable store sales increase of approximately 64%.\"***\n\nAdditionally, the anecdotal evidence you mentioned from the Gamestop subreddit means they're running out of supply because of increased coronavirus demand. This is GOOD NEWS because they're selling through old inventory at a premium rather than a discount before the new consoles come out.\n\nThey have more than enough liquidity to buy back debt below par and/or refinance. They're obviously controlling operating expenses and cutting costs, so I'm not expecting operating losses to be significant. Additionally, I'm sure they qualify for gov't covid-19 support if needed.\n\nPeople are shorting this stock betting on bankruptcy that isn't happening for years down the road until optical drives are obselete. The short's timing is wrong, so that means their short positions are wrong and they'll be forced to cover in the short/medium term. Gamestop still has much flexibility in time and balance sheet to innovate, especially with the new executives on board. \n\nWhich makes more sense - short YEARS early paying ridiculous borrowing costs (some 200%), or short years later after the new cycle boom when there's evidence Gamestop isn't succesfully pivoting?",

At present, over 60 US cities are bankrupt with no ability to pay their pension liabilities. \n\nThe pandemic has been everyone's get out of jail free bailout. Failing businesses, failing equity, failing cities, failing states...everyone thought they could sneak a clean slate under the radar but the Fed went all in immediately. \n\nWe might very well witness the *beginning* of a State secession movement or a collapse.

        "body": "&gt; Which in general should imply fewer Americans working \n\nWhy would increased real wages and increased total comp imply less people working if the wage % of GDP falls?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt; capital holders capturing greater share of profits \n\nNo, it does not measure or indicate this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt; Which means as a share of the economy, the typical person has a newer iPhone and bigger Funko collection but when they make $1000 for their boss they're taking a smaller chunk of that \n\nNo, that isn't how that works nor is that what has been happening. (Unless I have been mislead and profit margins have increased and this has been hidden by every company filing a 10-k). Out of curiosity, what do you think the average profit margin in The US is?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt; The average person has basically no savings or investments, so the average person is benefiting less and less from economic growth now compared to previously \n\nNo. Even with no savings (which, btw, are exactly equivalent to investments) economic growth benefits everyone. This is why the least expensive car in 1980 was sold for around $16,000 in today's USD while the least expensive car today goes for $14,000 and has airbags, backup cameras, bluetooth conectivity, wifi connectivity, and other features that didn't even exist in 1980. Even if wages had stagnated for 40 years you would still be able to buy much better things for the same amount of money.\n\nAssume no inflation:\n\nIf your wages and my wages are both $10/year and you sell me your house for $10 we have GDP of $30 and wages of $20.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNext year I sell you back the house for $10 which you then sell back to me for $10 and then we repeat this 4 more times. Our wages haven't changed relative to inflation so now we have wages of $20 + sales of $100 for a GDP of $120.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOur wages are now a much smaller share of GDP, but we are no worse off than last year. We could very easily increase our wages as a % of GDP simply by not trading the house back and forth.",
