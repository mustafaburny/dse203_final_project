There are people who want to make content and can't afford 50 a month for Premiere etc. Also Adobe has been teasing some really cool AI stuff for years.... but where is it? They haven't really done anything huge in a while.. Creative Cloud is okay.. but its clunky and people don't like paying subscription and they don't like dealing with millions of passwords on an enterprise level etc. Adobe could be great.. but they need to do something big.... although every lawyer on the planet uses Acrobat and calls it Adobe. \"Do you have adobe?\"... Yet acrobat itself is kind of clunky as well.   \n\n\nBut who is their rival? If you look it up.. None of those companies have much to do with creating content: \"Adobe's top competitors include SAP, Salesforce, DocuSign, Dropbox, Getty Images, Shutterstock, Apple, Microsoft, IBM and Autodesk. Adobe is a software company developing digital marketing and media solutions.\"",
