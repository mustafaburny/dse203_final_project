They haven't really done anything huge in a while.. Creative Cloud is okay.. but its clunky and people don't like paying subscription and they don't like dealing with millions of passwords on an enterprise level etc. Adobe could be great.. but they need to do something big.... although every lawyer on the planet uses Acrobat and calls it Adobe. \"Do you have adobe?\"... Yet acrobat itself is kind of clunky as well.   \n\n\nBut who is their rival? If you look it up..

        "body": "&gt; As chip production begins to pick back up, Intel\u2019s stock should begin to go up as well.    \n\nChip production never significantly dropped, so there is no recovery.   \n\nThe \"chip shortage\" is more accurately: A chip shortage in *certain sectors* who cancelled their chip orders/slots, which were happily picked up by others expecting a surge (like consumer electronics). Some of these sectors, like cars, who were expecting decreased consumer demand instead witnesses unusually high demand, and they were unable to regain their slots. \n\nAlso building a chip plant takes at bare minimum five years and that is assuming the wait list for chip manufacturing equipment isn't already years (which, spoilers: it is). Intel's biggest asset is that they're a US company, and there's national security interest in on-shoring. So I expect the USG to bail them out by funding a major US chip production facility within the USA for mostly USG/DoD consumption. In the meantime AMD/TSM will continue to eat Intel's lunch, and their market share (which is a lagging indicator) will continue to shrink.   \n\nWhile I'm bullish on Intel over tens of years for the reason above, I'm bearish right now as I don't believe we've hit the bottom. P/E may actually get worse if earnings sink as Intel tries to compete with AMD's superior products in the enterprise/data-center space (i.e. deep discounts).    \n\nSo I may buy Intel but not at $57, maybe at $45~.",

I wanted to pay a guy to do some weedwacking for me and he wanted $200 for about 2.5 man-hours of labor (I know because I just did it myself once i got my weedwacker working).  Weed wacking is almost $100/hr right now where I live because this guy amd several others are booked solid.  \n\nThere are a few key issues here imo and they all work together to exacerbate things:\n\n\n1. Stim money and pent up spending is creating a cash grab.       People are charging it because people are paying it.\n\n\n2. What people did to pass the time during covid was highly viral.  Buying TP, jigsaw puzzles, meme stocks... home improvement.  So there's extra demand, tons of people halfway done with something.\n\n3. There are a fair number of people in trades that just work on an as needed basis.  Every plumber, carpenter, and earth mover I know is saying it's super hard to find help right now.\n\nI see basically all of this going away once John Q Public's bank account gets back down to \"paycheck to paycheck\" level.  \n\n\n I wonder if theres a good way to get stats on avg americans  savings level.",

Not everything can be determined ahead of its time. \n\nI remember a time where my friend introduced me to Bitcoin back in 2012 way back when I was still in high school. We did some research and said \u201chey this could be a good investment\u201d. We didn\u2019t have a job nor extra money. We tried to talk to our parents about it even just asking for $100 to put into Bitcoin, but with no luck we just sat and watched it. We still often talk about it to reminisce about how we could have been living the life. I believe back then, 1BTC was $10 so a $100 investment would have been $379k today and nearly 600k at its peak earlier this year. \n\nI also did some research and wanted to invest into AMD back when it was $3 in 2015, I didn\u2019t have money because I was in college and told my dad because he asked for advice for a $30k investment that he said was his gambling money. He didn\u2019t listen and invested into an oil company and broke even after about a year. \n\nI don\u2019t really regret much, but it just did reassure  me that putting good research into something can definitely yield good results. The good thing is that you still did make a hefty profit on it.",

Which is exactly what's happening. I would not want them to jack up the price to make some short term revenue, and then abandon all their loyal customers who right now, could easily switch to AMD and get similar performance.\n\nA lot of other companies are in similar positions, TSM comes to mind.

Also the move to do custom fabs for competitors actually let's them partner with the googles, Amazon's, etc of the world as they desire more customization/specificity for their particular cloud servers.\n\nI think people are giving AMD too much credit considering half their earnings last year was tax provision related (I do tax provisions for public companies for work), buybacks at rieic valuations (they criticized Intel for this but not AMD), inability to increase supply/sales because TSMC is in charge, likely margin pressure due to TSMC passing costs to them for buildouts and better margins supply shortages, refusal to integrate thunderbolt.

Some of these sectors, like cars, who were expecting decreased consumer demand instead witnesses unusually high demand, and they were unable to regain their slots. \n\nAlso building a chip plant takes at bare minimum five years and that is assuming the wait list for chip manufacturing equipment isn't already years (which, spoilers: it is). Intel's biggest asset is that they're a US company, and there's national security interest in on-shoring. So I expect the USG to bail them out by funding a major US chip production facility within the USA for mostly USG/DoD consumption. In the meantime AMD/TSM will continue to eat Intel's lunch, and their market share (which is a lagging indicator) will continue to shrink.   \n\nWhile I'm bullish on Intel over tens of years for the reason above, I'm bearish right now as I don't believe we've hit the bottom. P/E may actually get worse if earnings sink as Intel tries to compete with AMD's superior products in the enterprise/data-center space (i.e. deep discounts).    \n\nSo I may buy Intel but not at $57, maybe at $45~.",

Weed wacking is almost $100/hr right now where I live because this guy amd several others are booked solid.  \n\nThere are a few key issues here imo and they all work together to exacerbate things:\n\n\n1. Stim money and pent up spending is creating a cash grab.       People are charging it because people are paying it.\n\n\n2. What people did to pass the time during covid was highly viral.  Buying TP, jigsaw puzzles, meme stocks... home improvement.  So there's extra demand, tons of people halfway done with something.\n\n3. There are a fair number of people in trades that just work on an as needed basis.  Every plumber, carpenter, and earth mover I know is saying it's super hard to find help right now.\n\nI see basically all of this going away once John Q Public's bank account gets back down to \"paycheck to paycheck\" level.  \n\n\n I wonder if theres a good way to get stats on avg americans  savings level.",

Not everything can be determined ahead of its time. \n\nI remember a time where my friend introduced me to Bitcoin back in 2012 way back when I was still in high school. We did some research and said \u201chey this could be a good investment\u201d. We didn\u2019t have a job nor extra money. We tried to talk to our parents about it even just asking for $100 to put into Bitcoin, but with no luck we just sat and watched it. We still often talk about it to reminisce about how we could have been living the life. I believe back then, 1BTC was $10 so a $100 investment would have been $379k today and nearly 600k at its peak earlier this year. \n\nI also did some research and wanted to invest into AMD back when it was $3 in 2015, I didn\u2019t have money because I was in college and told my dad because he asked for advice for a $30k investment that he said was his gambling money. He didn\u2019t listen and invested into an oil company and broke even after about a year. \n\nI don\u2019t really regret much, but it just did reassure  me that putting good research into something can definitely yield good results. The good thing is that you still did make a hefty profit on it.",

Which is exactly what's happening. I would not want them to jack up the price to make some short term revenue, and then abandon all their loyal customers who right now, could easily switch to AMD and get similar performance.\n\nA lot of other companies are in similar positions, TSM comes to mind.

Intels R&amp;D is more than all of AMD and NVDA combined.\n\nIntels current price gives it no credit for likely having flat sales YoY (projections are sandbagged, there is a supply shortage for EVERYONE so expect sales to be flattish), mobileye growth, Alder Lake catching them up to AMD in CPU this year, their moves to enter into GPUs with performance very close to AMD/NVDA (https://wccftech.com/intel-xe-hpg-dg2-graphics-card-pcb-leak-4096-cores-16-gb-vram-gaming-performance-close-to-rtx-3080/), potentially BILLIONS in US tax credits (more than a few years worth of AMDs earnings), US pressure on businesses to have US Fab. Also the move to do custom fabs for competitors actually let's them partner with the googles, Amazon's, etc of the world as they desire more customization/specificity for their particular cloud servers.\n\nI think people are giving AMD too much credit considering half their earnings last year was tax provision related (I do tax provisions for public companies for work), buybacks at rieic valuations (they criticized Intel for this but not AMD), inability to increase supply/sales because TSMC is in charge, likely margin pressure due to TSMC passing costs to them for buildouts and better margins supply shortages, refusal to integrate thunderbolt. Businesses are increasingly moving to laptops with a docking station. They want the laptop that lets you hook up to everything via 1 cable.\n\nThat's just my 2 cents. I am long INTC from $46 and adding to this and other positions as I get cash flow.",
