Those are entirely arbitrary values.  Determining market cap segments based on a nominal figure makes absolutely no sense for any practical function.  In a very general sense the market and thus market cap of constituent companies appreciates over time.  Standard Oil was at it's peak worth 1.1B.  A small cap by your standard, yes?  A company had never been worth 100B until IBM hit that milestone in 1987 and yet now its the median.  See why static figures are useless?\n\nI think perhaps your expectations are more incorrect than the index methodology.\n\nAlso Vanguard does not determine index composition for any of its funds.",

        "body": "I agree with all your points. In terms of business similarity (not at all investing prospect similarities) I think of tech companies as:\n\n- chip/components/data center hardware: NVDA, AMD, INTC, QCOM, TXN\n- fabrication: TSM (I don't follow anything else sorry)\n- PaaS: MSFT, AMZN, IBM/RedHat, GOOG (trying aggressively)\n- SaaS/Software: MSFT, GOOG, ORCL, IBM/RedHat, ADEB, FB, AMZN\n- Consumer Electronics: AAPL\n- Ads: GOOG, FB\n\nobviously there are many other companies that I don't follow, and the categorization isn't 100% clean either. AAPL's services (music, icloud, etc) are forms of SaaS. FB is technically ads, but they are also a complete marketing SaaS especially globally where many businesses rely 100% on FB for their entire online presence. Ads also depends on your reach. Both GOOG and MSFT have consumer electronics, but I don't use that to drive investment. I won't be surprised if GOOG or MSFT cancel a major line of their hardware any time.\n\nThere are many other consumer electronics companies but nothing as fully integrated as AAPL in that area, including MSFT and GOOG.\n\nRedHat is active in the datacenter space and probably why IBM acquired them. IBM is more of a global tech projects coordinator, and manages a lot of banks infrastructures, but are feeling the pressure from other PaaS providers. I don't have any investments in it though. \n\nTech companies always have their toes in many businesses because of the nature of software. I can't think of one with more toes than MSFT (maybe GOOG second), which could be unfocused waste depending on their management. It certainly feel like it was for MSFT for most of the 2000s.\n\nTo answer OP's question though, I think any of these companies are probably fine with equal chances, though you will introduce yourself to company specific short term volatility. Who knows when a random bad news for AAPL, MSFT, AMD, NVDA, etc might hit affecting the stock price in the short term. Balancing (depending on the amount) or using an etf like others mentioned is a good idea, though I don't think any of your picks will be bad in the long run either.",

If someone wants to just be an absolutist yes stock markets have gone up from 15 years ago.  It hasn\u2019t been a straight line and it isn\u2019t \u201cexactly Apples to Apples\u201d.  When I started investing a long long time ago the Dow was a little over 1000 so yes it has gone up tremendously.  And yes I tell people just buy the companies you know about that are run good and forget about the day to day or year to year machinations of the market.  It was true then and true now.  In between just buying and forgetting about the stock price there is life.  Children, marriages, divorce, sickness, accidents, etc.  A lot depends upon those factors and when did someone enter the market.   The 30 stocks in the Dow aren\u2019t the same 30 when I was a young man.  Before Amazon was the unstoppable force it was IBM back in the day.  Yahoo was king for awhile.  Merck at one time own the market, etc.  All of that was long before $25T+ in national debt and Doctors &amp; Lawyers barely paying off their student loans.  It\u2019s all well and good for now.  The people posting here saying \u201cOh well I\u2019m going to ride this thing until I can\u2019t\u201d.  Well good for them.  Some people were doing just that.  Then this hit, they got called on margin and are going to have to sell their home to get right.  Pigs get slaughtered. Past performance does not equal future success.  Etc. etc.  A lot of shxt is going to happen between now and \u201cit\u2019s all going to be fine\u201d.",

General purpose quantum computer might offer infinitely more than that. All the buzz about AI and machine learning on supercomputers currently is nothing more than a fancy algorithm (maybe not even that fancy) which takes huge amount of time and resources for self learning. Google\u2019s AlphaGo AI played insane number of games with itself before it managed to beat Ke Jie in human vs machine. With quantum computer where computing power doubles every time you add one qubit. The AI might become an actual AI. Quantum cryptography will finally bring information security. Bringing closer possibility of teleportation. Think about all the jobs it will create which you can\u2019t even imagine now. Yes, it might sound like a cheap sci-fi novel, but that could be our or our grand kids future. So not everyone\u2019s investment horizon.\n\nThis is why I\u2019m very hyped about quantum computing. It\u2019s super exciting, and equally terrifying.\n\nThat said. I\u2019m not saying that it will be IBM who will make a breakthrough. Or even if they do, that it will be them who will benefit from it the most. Google is also working on quantum computer. They might even be on par with IBMs one by now. I don\u2019t hold IBM and not planning on buying.",

EPS is not a universal scale cause companies have different numbers of total shares and have business models that expect to earn money at different rates. What does matter is the growth of earnings per share because growth over time generally increases stock price at the same pace (if not faster) as as the growth in earnings. For value companies that care more for stability over growth (think P&amp;G, IBM, McDonalds, Coke), they care more about maintaining their earnings just enough so that they can grow their dividend with the natural (slow) growth of their company.",

Women like to try on makeup in store. It's one of the few retailers that won't go bust from online competition. They are also focusing on online sales. Both online and physical stores will continue to grow. ULTA is a first stop for women looking for every day makeup. \n\nATVI (Activision) - 21%. COD warzone is a huge hit.

Activision will continue to follow trends and advance with technology.\n\nDIS (Disney) - 19%. Another great brand that people love. Disney+ is a huge hit and will continue to grow at a rapid pace as more people learn about it. Disney plus can catch up to Netflix in a few years. Both Disney and Netflix have roughly the same market cap. That means for the price of Netflix you can buy Disney+ and the rest of Disney is free. Disney owns so many entertainment companies it's pretty much a monopoly. \n\nAKAM (Akamai) - 9%. The largest security company in the world. Their customers are huge corporations like Adobe,  Airbnb, AMD, Audi, best buy, Fiat, Fox, Honda, IBM, Ikea, MSI, Microsoft, NBA, NBC, us air Force, US Department of state, Ubisoft, and Verizon. As technology becomes more advanced and connected, security demand is going to grow exponentially. Currently adding more to Akamai.",

Here is a 15-year chart of BRK.B vs S&amp;P500TR (untaxed dividends included):\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/BerkshireHathaway/comments/gd1ogo/brkb_vs_sp500_with_dividends_very_similar/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share\n\nThe airline loss for Berkshire was less than $3.5 billion. To put that in persepective, Berkshire had **operating earnings of almost $2 billion PER MONTH** in Q1 of 2020\n\nAnd quoting Bryant24 on SeekingAlpha:\n\n\"People always bring up IBM, he bought that in 2011 so it wasn't all that recent. It didn't work out as well as he'd hoped but he still made a little money on it. Also I give him credit because he got out in the $160's after he saw they were not doing as well in the cloud as he had expected. The stock has traded down in the lower $100's for the last couple of years so he at least made a good decision to get out.\"\n\n\"He bought his position in Heinz in 2012 and the deal with Kraft was done in 2015, so again not all that recent. He's also made money on KHC through it's dividend, I think the share price is about at the Berkshire cost basis. He had some KHC preferred shares that paid a really high coupon for several years. So he's returned well over 5% per year on his KHC investments and it's actually preforming pretty well right now. Again, not a great investment so far, but far from the disaster people make it out to be. It has been a disaster for those that bought it at 90.\"\n\n\"The airlines were actual losers but he was up a decent amount on them and then we had a pandemic. So perhaps he shouldn't have bought them, but things happen and the loss from the airline investment was tiny and immaterial in the scale of Berkshire. My point to all of this is people go out of their way to bring up Buffet's disappointing trades even nearly 10 years later and they way overstate the losses. Most are not educated on the trades and just repeat how big of a disaster IBM was when it was 9 years ago and not really a disaster.\"",

        "body": "The present giants are not the same as dinosaurs of the past.  They learned the goods and the bads from giants of yesterday.\n\nIBM is a dinosaur. It became a dinosaur with the emergence of personal computers. But while many dinosaurs have been dead for years, IBM is still alive because -- IMO -- it has done one thing right: IBM Research.   IBM Research is what has kept IBM alive, staying with the youngsters.  \n\nGuess what. The current giants have learned from this. They all have invested heavily in research.  Most interestingly is Google. Most of their products are \"betas\", which are experimental research projects that are deployed to the public.\n\nAnother thing the giants have learned is that they need to be very flexible and adaptive to rising trends.   Microsoft raised because of the dominant of software, which by the way was the dead sentence for hardware giants.   But this dominant almost killed Microsoft, turning it into a dinosaur, when software became a commodity and not a specialty product.  Demanding customers to pay for each version of Windows and Word was no longer the right thing to do, Microsoft adapted to a model the sells software as a service.  And they have survived. They have also excelled due to Microsoft Research. This has allowed them to stay at the forefront.\n\nGoogle, Apple and FaceBook will be the dominating players in the near future because -- IMO -- data, data about people, and the interconnection of people have become more important than anything else.\n\nIt is very possible that data will become cheap in some sense, a commodity.  Although data has become more open, certain types of data can be very expensive to collect.  So I think Google and FaceBook will continue to have a promising future.\n\nApple is in a very interesting situation. It doesn't sell a product.   Other cellphone companies sell utilities. But Apple sells the experience of people connecting to people. It's like FaceBook in some way.  People inherent want to connect to other people. This is a lasting value. As long as Apple excels at this, it will be around for a long time.",

        "body": "Well, the incremental value of data might decline. Lots of big companies are built on technological change but no change lasts forever. Car companies for example. Or oil/coal--OPEC probably seemed invincible but between demand drops, renewables and fracking they no longer seem as invincible as before. Or moore's law powered companies like IBM, Dell, Microsoft but is now slowing down (in both tech and demand for faster personal computers). \n\nSo is it inconceivable that data mining might top out too? Legislation, or using anonymous VPNs become like brushing your teeth, or  every company has so much data that it levels out. Google knows when I flip lightswitches in my house but it's not as valuable as reading my email and exact location, surely.",

IBM hasn't gone away but it lost its dominance and sharehodlers haven't reaped the same profits in the past decades as they did in its heyday. It could be worse: Kodak and Nokia are still around too!\n\nToo often people in this sub think \"can't disappear = can't lose money\" but it couldn't further from the truth. There are many ways a business can destroy shareholder value, or simply underperform the market, without going bankrupt.",
