I understand that bonds (and deposit accounts) have very low yields, but in a poor economy like this one, why aren\u2019t investors more concerned about limiting risks?  I buy Apple because bonds don\u2019t pay very much. Then everyone loses their job, stops spending money on iPhones, and the stock goes down. I would have been better off in a low yielding bond.\n\nI get where Krugman is coming from, but there\u2019s a lot more downside potential in stocks than in bonds. Honest question, is the Dow going back to 30,000 just because bond yields aren\u2019t attractive?",

No one was interested in shorting either one.\n\nYet TSLA has 4Xed in less than a year, while F &amp; GM have tanked 40% in less than a year &amp; cut their dividends.\n\nI think the results speak for itself, don't listen to conventional wisdom about TSLA, many people don't understand the business model, and don't understand why it's competitors in the auto industry are in trouble, or worse yet, don't even realize that they're in trouble in the first place.\n\nLiterally all the companies you list OP have one thing in common with their sales and revenue numbers over the last few years. Either those numbers are stagnant (at best) or in steep double digit decline (even before the coronavirus) at worst. TSLA's numbers on the other hand continue to go up exponentially, and investors like companies that can consistently post rapid growth, and promise continued rapid growth in the future.\n\nThere's two major factors fundamentally changing the auto industry and disrupting the business models of F, FCAU, DAI, HMC, GM, HOG, and others in the auto industry.\n\n* The shift to BEV's (which the auto-makers all agree is happening, even the ones who used to deny it like Toyota).\n\n* The shift to self driving cars.\n\nTSLA is leading both of those disruptions, while the rest of the automakers are struggling badly at adapting to one or both of them. Consumers aren't stupid, they know this, this makes Tesla's cars more appealing, and the rest of the automakers cars less appealing. TSLA is called the Apple of the car auto-industry for good reason.\n\nIs TSLA expensive OP? Heck yes. But are there good reasons to justify it being expensive? Heck yes.",

        "body": "Full memo from Pichai:\n\nHi everyone,\n\nIt\u2019s now been well over two months since we closed the first Google offices in Asia out of an abundance of caution around the spread of COVID-19. We couldn\u2019t have imagined then how much could change, and how quickly, for so many people around the world. Our thoughts remain with those who have lost loved ones and with those who are currently battling the disease.\n\nWe\u2019re only a quarter of the way through 2020, and it\u2019s already been the most unusual year in memory. None of us could have predicted that most of us would now be working from home during the biggest global pandemic of our lifetimes.\n\nDespite these strange circumstances, it\u2019s been remarkable to see us step\u00a0up to\u00a0meet this challenge by doing what we do best: being helpful. We\u2019ve continued to show up for people in moments big and small, whether it\u2019s providing accurate and authoritative information to keep families safe; supporting products and infrastructure to keep our and others\u2019 services running; and delivering great content to keep people\u2019s spirits up in tough moments. We\u2019ve also committed more than\u00a0$800 million\u00a0in grants, loans and ad credits to help small businesses and others affected by COVID-19, and Google.org has committed\u00a0$50 million\u00a0(plus an additional\u00a0$2,500\u00a0in gift-matching per Googler) to help communities all over the world.\n\nIn addition to these efforts, many teams have been focused on helping governments and public health officials slow the spread of the disease. We\u2019ve released insights based on aggregated, anonymized data to help public health experts measure the impact of social distancing measures. We announced a joint effort with Apple on contact tracing designed with strong privacy protections. And we\u2019ve invested in ramping up testing (including through Verily) and the production of PPE and lifesaving medical devices.\n\nI am so proud of the way we\u2019ve come together across the company, and I want us to continue living\u00a0up to\u00a0our important mission in the weeks and months ahead. It won\u2019t be easy. Just like the 2008 financial crisis, the entire global economy is hurting, and Google and Alphabet are not immune to the effects of this global pandemic. We exist in an ecosystem of partnerships and interconnected businesses, many of whom are feeling significant pain.\n\nThe clear lesson from 2008 is that preparing early is key to weathering the storm and emerging in a position to continue long-term growth, as we have done over the past decade. So I wanted to share with you our current plans on what we think is the best path forward.\n\nWe are reevaluating the pace of our investment plans for the remainder of 2020. That starts with taking a more critical look at the pace of hiring for the rest of the year. For context, we hired 20,000 Googlers in 2019 and had been targeting a similar number for 2020. We have already onboarded more than 4,000 Nooglers and Characters in the first quarter, and thousands of additional new hires are starting soon. Not only are we facing delays in getting everyone their essential equipment, such as laptops and security keys, there are challenges in getting Nooglers\u00a0up to\u00a0speed, trained and productive on their new teams.\n\nWe believe now is the time to significantly slow down the pace of hiring, while maintaining momentum in a small number of strategic areas where users and businesses rely on Google for ongoing support, and where our growth is critical to their success. By dialing back our plans in other areas, we can ensure Google emerges from this year at a more appropriate size and scale than we would otherwise. That means we need to carefully prioritize hiring employees who will address our greatest user and business needs. Your leads will be in touch with you about how this will work for your team.\n\nBeyond hiring, we continue to invest, but will be recalibrating the focus and pace of our investments in areas like data centers and machines, and non business essential marketing and travel.\nIf you have additional ideas about how we can free up or redeploy resources to make us more efficient and support our priorities, I welcome your thoughts and invite you to share them by replying here.\n\nAmid this uncertainty, the bright spot for me has been watching everyone pitch in to help your teammates and communities, and to make things better for the people we serve. We\u2019ll need that same level of energy, ingenuity and teamwork in the weeks and months ahead. Working together, I\u2019m confident that we\u2019ll emerge from this challenge in a strong position.",
