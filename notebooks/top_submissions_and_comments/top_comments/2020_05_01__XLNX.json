        "body": "Yeah entry point is essential in options. More important often than the right ticker. Ive made good money day scalping bounces off support, holding for like 30mins to a couple hours... \n\nSo I'm a tech tard. I know the cloud software sector really well as well as the semiconductor sector. If you were looking to park money in a stonk then I would stick to tech long term although there are some serious discounts in the banks, REITs &amp; cruises long term (I ignore the airlines due to dilution and possibly long term weak demand, as opposed to the cruises where Americans will fucking flock to even if it was the end of the world)   but there discounts are value plays so beware; personally I 'feel' best investing in the best. I dont want to risk my company losing to another so I go with the fastest growth/strongest market positioning. \n\nIn stonks you cant go wrong with ROKU SQ TSLA long term. All leaders, fast growth, the future of consumer tech (RST is the new FAANG). I'll get hate on here but ROKU SQ TSLA could run 500% easy over the next 5 years. No joke.\n\nIn cloud you will pay a premium to own the best but I would go for it. My favorite positions are AYX (actually not cloud but its a data science platform) DDOG/ESTC (observability/APM/API/SEIM) CRWD OKTA (cybersecurity, ZS is a distant-er 3rd). ESTC AYX probably the best value proposition of these companies right now. CRWD is still a buy and going to new highs by next year easy. \n\nAlso check out SE PDD BILI as Chinese stonks, INSG for 5G, and then basically the entire semiconductor sector especially AMD NVDA MU MRVL XLNX. \n\nPeep VTIQ which is the future Nikola motors as well. Peep INMD which is a high gross margin, high growth aesthetic medical device company thats trading at a massive discount. Peep DXCM PODD also in medi devices; peep VRTX CRSP EDIT NVTA TWST in bio - can also buy ARKG. Hope thats helpful",

Harley is a no; people are not buying Harleys - that's why the stock is where it is. Millennials are not buying Harleys. They've had like 2 or 3 strategic plans to revamp the company in the last 2 or 3 years and it wasn't doing well before this all happened. No thanks to LUV. XLNX and IT are somewhat interesting.",

        "body": "Thanks for the comments. Playing my own devil's advocate, I have been thinking that I could stomach a 50% drawdown on the stock, which would bring the multiples (P/E, EBIT/TEV) to a more \"normal\" 25-30. Given historical volatility that's definitely a possibility and I would probably buy more at that point unless something fundamentally changed. So I don't know if it's fair to say it's \"expensive\" at this point.\n\nI appreciate the insight on the sector demand moving in spikes, revenues did almost double from 2016 to 2018.\n\nAs for cards being overpriced, maybe, but people who work on this stuff have told me there aren't any very good alternatives (unless you're a company that has the resources to make their own SoCs and can invest in the SW stack). In my line of work, we don't use GPUs but we use FPGAs and it's interesting how there are really only two companies that make FPGA chips and tools (Altera, which is now Intel and Xilinx). If FPGAs could experience similar demands spikes as GPUs, I would definitely invest in Xilinx but I think GPUs and FPGAs are night and day when it comes to ease of use, SW readiness etc.",
