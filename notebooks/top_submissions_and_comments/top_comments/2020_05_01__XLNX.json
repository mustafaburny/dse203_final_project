Even the CEO of Booking has said that there is concern that some business travel does not come back and is deemed non-essential/people just do things remotely instead.\n\nNo to XOM. Harley is a no; people are not buying Harleys - that's why the stock is where it is. Millennials are not buying Harleys. They've had like 2 or 3 strategic plans to revamp the company in the last 2 or 3 years and it wasn't doing well before this all happened. No thanks to LUV. XLNX and IT are somewhat interesting.",
