But in 1999 after Yahoo and America Online had already gone up like tenfold, I got the bright idea at Soros to short internet stocks. And I put 200 million in them in about February and by mid-March the 200 million short I had, lost $600 million on, gotten completely beat up and was down like 15 percent on the year. And I was very proud of the fact that I never had a down year, and I thought well, I\u2019m finished.\n\n&gt; So, the next thing that happens is I can\u2019t remember whether I went to Silicon Valley or I talked to some 22-year-old with Asperger\u2019s. But whoever it was, they convinced me about this new tech boom that was going to take place. So I went and hired a couple of gunslingers because we only knew about IBM and Hewlett-Packard. I needed Veritas and Verisign. I wanted the six. So, we hired this guy and we end up on the year \u2014 we had been down 15 and we ended up like 35 percent on the year. And the Nasdaq\u2019s gone up 400 percent.\n\n&gt; So, I\u2019ll never forget it. January of 2000 I go into Soros\u2019s office and I say I\u2019m selling all the tech stocks, selling everything. This is crazy\u2026at 104 times earnings. This is nuts. Just kind of as I explained earlier, we\u2019re going to step aside, wait for the next fat pitch. I didn\u2019t fire the two gunslingers. They didn\u2019t have enough money to really hurt the fund, but they started making 3 percent a day and I\u2019m out. It is driving me nuts. I mean their little account is like up 50 percent on the year. I think Quantum was up seven. It\u2019s just sitting there.\n\n&gt; So like around March I could feel it coming. I just \u2014 I had to play. I couldn\u2019t help myself. And three times the same week I pick up a \u2014 don\u2019t do it. Don\u2019t do it. Anyway, I pick up the phone finally. I think I missed the top by an hour. I bought $6 billion worth of tech stocks, and in six weeks I had left Soros and I had lost $3 billion in that one play. You asked me what I learned. I didn\u2019t learn anything. I already knew that I wasn\u2019t supposed to do that. I was just an emotional basket case and couldn\u2019t help myself. So, maybe I learned not to do it again, but I already knew that.\n\n- Stan Druckenmiller\n\nStay bear my brother",

        "body": "I have 4 different strategy of investments, where two of them correlated.\n\nThe 5 strategy is currently off and it is a SP500 ETF, I'm not buying not because of FED, more because of the indicators I had mentioned. If they will go to the normal levels I will convert some share of the portfolio to the SP500 ETF or maybe some leverage Index ETF if it be good enough.\n\nFirst two strategies are become clarified as we enter the Great Commodities Cycle. You can see everywhere, with gold prices, uranium, ore and more. Gold is actually outperform the broad market in the last two years because of this. And it isn't going to stop. The Great Commodities Cycle was predictable because of some rates and graphs, but it a little bit more complicated to explain it here. My good performance is literally from the big hedge with gold against the markets. \n\n So how we can earn some money from it? \n\n1. Just buy Gold (GLD or IUA) and hold for 10 years.\n2. Buy commodities connected companies. But you have to choose good ones, with small debt, great management, and good free cash flow.\n\nThe 3 strategy is to find \"hidden\" value companies. Companies with a good history, perfect management, growing sales, but bad times. Not so bad, just for some reasons the news coverage is bad for them right now. It couldn't be a \"hype\" company like Amazon, it has to be smaller one, who nobody from the newbie investor knows.\n\nIt is very complicated strategy, but it is very rewarding one. To find this kind of company a great work needed to be done. A lot of financial data investigated, and a lot of research on the company. But as I said it is very rewarding. Returns on this are very high.\n\nThe 4 strategies is to find a flawns, a perfect places to earn some good return in the short period of time. It could be some crazy and unknown commodity or a short. Shorts are very dangerous, cause you play against the market mood, which is forever up. But.\n\nFor example I shorted the ADSK, very unusual things to do. If you ask today somebody about ADSK in the reddit, everybody will explain how great the company is, and how good to invest in it. \n\nI buy short at February this year for 210 and sell it for 140 in the pick of the crisis in March. Making literally nice money from it.",
