China's CSI 300 index gained 0.6%, with around a 3.5% rise in the first half. An official gauge of China's factory activity slipped in June, dented by chip and power supply shortages, while nonmanufacturing growth also slowed amid rising Covid-19 cases.\r  \n\r  \nWorries over the highly contagious Delta strain of Covid-19 may be weighing on investors on Wednesday. \"The delta variant is now traveling the world in a worrisome speed, hampering the prospects of economic recovery, yet again,\" said Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior analyst at Swissquote, in a note to clients.\r  \n\r  \nThe Stoxx Europe 600 index was under pressure, dropping 1% amid losses for banks and autos. The index was still set for a nearly 13% gain in the first half of the year. Data showed German jobless claims fell by 38,000 in June against a forecast for a fall of 20,000 from economists polled by The Wall Street Journal.\r  \n\r  \nU.S. stock futures also turned lower, following another record session for the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite that was driven by upbeat economic data, while investors managed to brush aside some worries about the Delta variant. The S&amp;P 500 is looking at an 8% gain for the second quarter and a 15% rise over six months, according to FactSet.\r  \n\r  \nEconomic data is swinging back into focus on Wednesday, with the June ADP private-sector employment report and pending home sales on tap. But the biggest data point for investors will be Friday's nonfarm payroll data for June.\r  \n\r  \nChinese ride-hailing giant Didi, which priced its initial public offering at $14, will make its trading debut on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday under the ticker DIDI.",

Some of these sectors, like cars, who were expecting decreased consumer demand instead witnesses unusually high demand, and they were unable to regain their slots. \n\nAlso building a chip plant takes at bare minimum five years and that is assuming the wait list for chip manufacturing equipment isn't already years (which, spoilers: it is). Intel's biggest asset is that they're a US company, and there's national security interest in on-shoring. So I expect the USG to bail them out by funding a major US chip production facility within the USA for mostly USG/DoD consumption. In the meantime AMD/TSM will continue to eat Intel's lunch, and their market share (which is a lagging indicator) will continue to shrink.   \n\nWhile I'm bullish on Intel over tens of years for the reason above, I'm bearish right now as I don't believe we've hit the bottom. P/E may actually get worse if earnings sink as Intel tries to compete with AMD's superior products in the enterprise/data-center space (i.e. deep discounts).    \n\nSo I may buy Intel but not at $57, maybe at $45~.",

        "body": "I think we all have regrets when some stocks rise by a large amount. You just need to accept that not everything always goes 100% your way. Not everything can be determined ahead of its time. \n\nI remember a time where my friend introduced me to Bitcoin back in 2012 way back when I was still in high school. We did some research and said \u201chey this could be a good investment\u201d. We didn\u2019t have a job nor extra money. We tried to talk to our parents about it even just asking for $100 to put into Bitcoin, but with no luck we just sat and watched it. We still often talk about it to reminisce about how we could have been living the life. I believe back then, 1BTC was $10 so a $100 investment would have been $379k today and nearly 600k at its peak earlier this year. \n\nI also did some research and wanted to invest into AMD back when it was $3 in 2015, I didn\u2019t have money because I was in college and told my dad because he asked for advice for a $30k investment that he said was his gambling money. He didn\u2019t listen and invested into an oil company and broke even after about a year. \n\nI don\u2019t really regret much, but it just did reassure  me that putting good research into something can definitely yield good results. The good thing is that you still did make a hefty profit on it.",

Knowing they have pent up demand means they can work on increasing supply, and lowering economies of scale, although they're probably reached a good medium for that a long time ago.\n\nI don't really care who gets a graphics card as long as they get sold and NVDA makes money on it. Which is exactly what's happening. I would not want them to jack up the price to make some short term revenue, and then abandon all their loyal customers who right now, could easily switch to AMD and get similar performance.\n\nA lot of other companies are in similar positions, TSM comes to mind. Long term all you would be doing is making sure nobody works with you again.",

Intels R&amp;D is more than all of AMD and NVDA combined.\n\nIntels current price gives it no credit for likely having flat sales YoY (projections are sandbagged, there is a supply shortage for EVERYONE so expect sales to be flattish), mobileye growth, Alder Lake catching them up to AMD in CPU this year, their moves to enter into GPUs with performance very close to AMD/NVDA (https://wccftech.com/intel-xe-hpg-dg2-graphics-card-pcb-leak-4096-cores-16-gb-vram-gaming-performance-close-to-rtx-3080/), potentially BILLIONS in US tax credits (more than a few years worth of AMDs earnings), US pressure on businesses to have US Fab. Also the move to do custom fabs for competitors actually let's them partner with the googles, Amazon's, etc of the world as they desire more customization/specificity for their particular cloud servers.\n\nI think people are giving AMD too much credit considering half their earnings last year was tax provision related (I do tax provisions for public companies for work), buybacks at rieic valuations (they criticized Intel for this but not AMD), inability to increase supply/sales because TSMC is in charge, likely margin pressure due to TSMC passing costs to them for buildouts and better margins supply shortages, refusal to integrate thunderbolt. Businesses are increasingly moving to laptops with a docking station. They want the laptop that lets you hook up to everything via 1 cable.\n\nThat's just my 2 cents.
