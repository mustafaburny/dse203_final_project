All their growth is from acquisitions and they have a lot of debt. Disney + is fine, but $5/month should have never made this a $140 stock. I may start nibbling at shares, but haven\u2019t made up my mind yet.\n\n\u2022 SBUX. This will probably drop more. Selling the $45p next week gives you a cost basis of ~ $43.50. I like the stock here. Another name that will never go away.\n\n\u2022 HD. Im shocked to see it this low, but makes sense as people aren\u2019t rushing to renovate homes in they\u2019re getting laid off. I missed the boat on this stock, so I\u2019d like to start building a position.\n\n\u2022 WEN. I know the growth isn\u2019t there, but I sold 2x $8p\u2019s today. If I get assigned, fine by me.\n\n\u2022 XLK around $65\n\n\u2022 AMD around $28 if we get there",

As you get further away from this most recent release of information, uncertainty grows until the next quarterly release. Likely IV will rise until that time unless other macro events or other news about this stock provide more certainty about the direction of this company, then the IV rise will likely still happen but be more muted.\n\nOther examples of this, if there are major pending litigation against a company or phase III drug trials within the next X months anticipated, will also see a inflated IV for that particular stock and not for the overall market. For example in the phase III trials, when the results of that get released IV drops due to less uncertainty. That is very likely regardless of if its a big positive move or big negative move or no move at all. Although you'll see less of an IV loss of value of the contract if you're in the money, have bought in an expiration time frame significantly out (3 months or more), or if the movement is in your direction (or some combination of all of these, and probably some other factors I'm forgetting about like spread or liquidity of the contracts).\n\nMacro does play a part too as I mentioned earlier, and IV is down market wide as well today with the release of the unemployment numbers.",

Still is total lockdown, btw. SK has already locked down some cities and italy I believe is considering it. Not saying we will have total quarantine here stateside, but I wouldn't be shocked if Seattle, LA, or NYC went into partial lockdown. This will most likely be bad for MU",
