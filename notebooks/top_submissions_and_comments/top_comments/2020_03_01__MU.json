Apparently raw material manufacturers are still no where near operating capacity ([manufacturers as well](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/02/the-rush-to-deploy-robots-in-china-amid-the-coronavirus-outbreak.html)), which some analysts predict will cause shortages in merchandise in the coming months once the \"reserve inventory\" is sold\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI mostly watch tech news, but I'm monitoring AMD, Nvidia, Microsoft and possible some other markets (Sony, Samsung, Nintendo) because it's possible various pieces of hardware will be difficult to obtain.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBig hardware launches (Xbox Series X, PS5, new Nintendo iteration, new phone launches) already decrease the supply and we've already had delays due to manufacturing. I'm not currently investing, but if one of the \"big\" hardware stocks drop significantly, I'll probably buy in. I'm not expecting to see any significant issues until the aforementioned big launches get closer though.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSources:\n\n* [Low inventory levels, price increases](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/coronavirus-update-ram-resistor-prices-effects)\n* [Discusses how US based manufacturers could benefit](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/chip-stocks-catch-brunt-of-tech-decline-but-coronavirus-could-benefit-us-memory-makers-2020-01-27)\n   * [This analyst also predicts US manufacturer gains](https://wccftech.com/micron-upgraded-by-baird-even-amid-dram-nand-demand-disruptions-due-the-coronavirus-epidemic/)\n* [Intel and Dell admit CPU shortages are an issue](https://www.pcworld.com/article/3529969/dell-q4-2019-earnings-call-punts-on-coronavirus-impact-but-confirms-cpu-shortages-still-exist.html)",

        "body": "Here are the usual caveats:  I'm just a guy in my bedroom.  I don't have a fancy MBA or work at some prestigious, boutique financial firm.  I'm just a guy trying to day/swing-trade for a living in my humble abode.  Watching the show, *Billions*, back in 2016 is what first piqued my interest.  And I started actively trading at the beginning of 2019.\n\n**One:**  Re hard economic data and China-- It's a country of \\~1.4 billion people.  Because of the one-child policy that lasted for decades, there's also a pretty big M/F gender disparity.  Additionally, in such a top-heavy government, Xi cannot afford to look weak for much longer; his COVID-19 honeymoon is quickly waning, IMHO.  Many big companies are already highly automated anyways.  Those of them that aren't will simply throw human bodies at the assembly lines to meet production quotas again, regardless of the infections.  Remember, there are no human rights in China; it's a communist state.  Either come to work or you're fired and will never work again *anywhere* for the rest of your days.  I recall that scene from Chernobyl where the workers were already so badly radiated that they decided to just keep shoveling the uranium \"for the greater good.\"  In times of crisis, humans lives (esp in communist states) are forfeit and cheap in the mission of the almighty dollar/RMB.  Gotta keep the engine of capitalism humming!  (There is some great irony in this, I know.)\n\n**Two:**  Looking forward, what is the strategic macro picture?  Here's my speculation for several moves ahead on the board:\n\n\\- Meat-space is going to get increasingly more fraught.  I currently live in an apt rental complex and I already see those Amazon Prime vans making multiple trips *a day* delivering stuff to our complex.  Millennials are already reluctant to go outside.  My God, back in my day, going to the mall, getting pizza, and hanging out at the arcade was a thing.  [Nowadays.](https://www.theatlantic.com/notes/2019/05/dead-malls-everywhere/588970/) \n\n\\- The other day I was in line at our local Walmart (when times are good, it's Target and Whole Foods.  When times are like now, it's Walmart and Aldi's) and some guy ahead of me was in line was trying to use multiple gift cards to make a huge purchase.  There was some problem with the register and the whole ordeal took something like ten minutes as the queue grew increasingly long, with everyone inline considerably annoyed.   Yes, there was something like twenty registers, but only three were manned at the time (it was a weekday afternoon).  I mean, seriously, can you blame millennials for not wanting to venture out into meat-space?  It's awful.\n\n\\- So back to now:  What are the implications of COVID-19?  Will it make meat-space more attractive or less?  You do that math.  My feeling is that the Coronavirus will just accelerate what had already been a growing trend:  People doing more commerce from home, people being more entertained at home, etc.  I'm a big follower of a16z and their big claim to fame is *\"Software is Eating the World.\"*  I wholeheartedly believe in that.  This is why I currently have huge positions and am overweight in memory and semiconductors.  I believe in more datacenters, more people going online (according to Andreessen, only half of the global population is currently online.  Vast swathes of South America, Africa, etc are still in the queue), and the basic human way-of-life is fundamentally changing.\n\n**Also:**  I do believe we'll eventually figure out crypto.  And that translates into (my belief, anyway) a big/bright future for semis and memory.  Long AMD and MU!",

        "body": "Here are the usual caveats:  I'm just a guy in my bedroom.  I don't have a fancy MBA or work at some prestigious, boutique financial firm.  I'm just a guy trying to day/swing-trade for a living in my humble abode.  Watching the show, *Billions*, back in 2016 is what first piqued my interest.  And I started actively trading at the beginning of 2019.\n\n**One:**  Re hard economic data and China-- It's a country of \\~1.4 billion people.  Because of the one-child policy that lasted for decades, there's also a pretty big M/F gender disparity.  Additionally, in such a top-heavy government, Xi cannot afford to look weak for much longer; his COVID-19 honeymoon is quickly waning, IMHO.  Many big companies are already highly automated anyways.  Those of them that aren't will simply throw human bodies at the assembly lines to meet production quotas again, regardless of the infections.  Remember, there are no human rights in China; it's a communist state.  Either come to work or you're fired and will never work again *anywhere* for the rest of your days.  I recall that scene from Chernobyl where the workers were already so badly radiated that they decided to just keep shoveling the uranium \"for the greater good.\"  In times of crisis, humans lives (esp in communist states) are forfeit and cheap in the mission of the almighty dollar/RMB.  Gotta keep the engine of capitalism humming!  (There is some great irony in this, I know.)\n\n**Two:**  Looking forward, what is the strategic macro picture?  Here's my speculation for several moves ahead on the board:\n\n\\- Meat-space is going to get increasingly more fraught.  I currently live in an apt rental complex and I already see those Amazon Prime vans making multiple trips *a day* delivering stuff to our complex.  Millennials are already reluctant to go outside.  My God, back in my day, going to the mall, getting pizza, and hanging out at the arcade was a thing.  [Nowadays.](https://www.theatlantic.com/notes/2019/05/dead-malls-everywhere/588970/) \n\n\\- The other day I was in line at our local Walmart (when times are good, it's Target and Whole Foods.  When times are like now, it's Walmart and Aldi's) and some guy ahead of me was in line was trying to use multiple gift cards to make a huge purchase.  There was some problem with the register and the whole ordeal took something like ten minutes as the queue grew increasingly long, with everyone inline considerably annoyed.   Yes, there was something like twenty registers, but only three were manned at the time (it was a weekday afternoon).  I mean, seriously, can you blame millennials for not wanting to venture out into meat-space?  It's awful.\n\n\\- So back to now:  What are the implications of COVID-19?  Will it make meat-space more attractive or less?  You do that math.  My feeling is that the Coronavirus will just accelerate what had already been a growing trend:  People doing more commerce from home, people being more entertained at home, etc.  I'm a big follower of a16z and their big claim to fame is *\"Software is Eating the World.\"*  I wholeheartedly believe in that.  This is why I currently have huge positions and am overweight in memory and semiconductors.  I believe in more datacenters, more people going online (according to Andreessen, only half of the global population is currently online.  Vast swathes of South America, Africa, etc are still in the queue), and the basic human way-of-life is fundamentally changing.\n\n**Also:**  I do believe we'll eventually figure out crypto.  And that translates into (my belief, anyway) a big/bright future for semis and memory.  Long AMD and MU!",

I'd wager that 4/5 of the posts that you're complaining about don't even see the light of day. Which should impress and terrify you.\n* It's difficult trying to strike a balance. The public attention has brought a lot of legitimate traders here who just want to share their experience, real DD, technical analysis, etc and we want to encourage that. They obviously make new accounts and we want them to contribute immediately.\n* We're tweaking things everyday in response to rapidly changing growth and news that swings the entire sub in a matter of hours (like our pumping problem last week). This weeked now everyone is talking about their local Costco, committing bioterroism, and killing the pope. Also, please calm the fuck down with killing the pope, guys. It's borderline enciting violence, I've temp banned a few people who take it wayyyy too far.\n* Our sexuality aside, we're volunteers from around the world. Our hours and availability differ, so there are mod lulls where a lot of one liner shitposts get through. We do our best, but we really focus on providing the best experience we can for you guys during trading hours when the engagement here is through the roof.\n* As far as you or others wanting to volunteer, you guys actually do a pretty good job en mass with downvoting and reporting bullshit. Keep it up. We appreciate that.\n\nThat's all I got at the moment. Hope it gives you some kind of something.",

        "body": "since no ones helped you out\n\noptions are contracts entered into by you and someone else (a counter party). There's 2 types of options, puts and calls. If you look at OP's picture you'll see that one of his \"trades\" is for SQQQ $29 CALL 3/20.\n\nSo he wants to buy a call. Now, like I said this call is a contract between OP and someone else. This contract states that at anytime between the day that OP purchases the call contract and the expiration date of the contract, stated as 3/20/2020. OP has the 'option' or choice to buy 100 shares of the etf SQQQ from the counter party of the contract for $29 regardless of what the actual price of the ETF is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo theoretically, if on 3/15 SQQQ is trading at $50 a share, OP can exercise his option and buy those 100 shares for $29 dollars from the counter party and sell those shares immediately in the open market for $50. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe downside is that OP has to pay the counter party a 'premium' in order to have this option. Right now the premium has a bid/ask of $2.65 x 2.95. So if OP wants to buy the call he has to pay $2.95 x 100 (per share, remember the call gives op the right to buy 100 shares from the counter party). Now, you may be asking, why is the spread so wide? Wouldn't OP immediately lose $30 or 10% on his trade? Is OP gambling with probably zero actual insight on investing? I'll let you figure those out on your own.",

Still, if there\u2019s any time gold should see its price increase, it would be now - when global interest rates are low and economic outlook is poor.

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), in contrast, has done only 459 tests since the epidemic began. The rollout of a CDC-designed test kit to state and local labs has become a fiasco because it contained a faulty reagent. Labs around the country eager to test more suspected cases\u2014and test them faster\u2014have been unable to do so. No commercial or state labs have the approval to use their own tests.\u201d",

Join the conversation below.\n\nColleges say they are following guidelines established by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, including recommending 14-day self-isolation for individuals who may have been exposed.\n\nFour students at three schools in the Los Rios Community College District around Sacramento are in isolation, after being exposed to an individual who tested positive in northern California. The University of California, Davis, said Saturday evening it had released three students\u2014one being tested, and that person\u2019s roommates\u2014from isolation after the results came back negative for the virus.\n\n\nThe American College Health Association, an organization of campus health programs at more than 1,100 institutions, created a task force on the virus 10 days ago. \u201cAnd it is as if we have been shot out of a cannon since then,\u201d said Dr. Jean Chin, an associate clinical professor of medicine at the University of Georgia who is chairing the new group.\n\nThe team is reviewing guidelines from the CDC, World Health Organization, the U.S. State Department and other authorities, distilling medical literature into digestible advisories for campus communities and establishing guidelines to help members prepare for the disease.\n\nThe University of Rochester established a Coronavirus University Response Team in February, looking at everything from emergency response and public health to addressing possible xenophobia, monitoring international travel and planning for the potential impact on applications and enrollment.\n\nThe University of Colorado Boulder created a pandemic section for its emergency operations plan in 2015, and one for infectious disease a year later. The guidelines lay out things like how to coordinate with local health officials and various containment measures once a threat has been identified. The campus has roughly 35,500 students.\n\nDecisions such as halting campus operations would depend on how many cases were confirmed and where the affected people live, said Dan Jones, Boulder\u2019s associate vice chancellor for integrity, safety and compliance.\n\n\nSome schools don\u2019t have to dust off their doomsday guides because they have recently battled contagious diseases. Syracuse University had dozens of confirmed cases of mumps in late 2017 and had to coordinate closely with the CDC and county and state health departments.\n\nA few years ago, Rochester had roughly 200 reported cases of norovirus, whose symptoms include vomiting and diarrhea. Dr. Manchester said there were likely closer to 1,000 people affected.\n\nThe last six weeks of spring semester that year, the university was in \u201call-out \u2018control-this-outbreak\u2019 mode,\u201d Dr. Manchester said. The school stepped up regular cleaning services, switched to packaged-food distribution rather than open buffets like salad bars, and even swapped out buckets of coffee stirrers for individually wrapped ones.\n\nSchools see coronavirus preparation as a good opportunity to remind students and others to maintain proper hygiene, including covering coughs with arms and not hands, staying home when sick and washing hands regularly. To get the message out, they are sending emails, issuing flashing alerts on central websites and posting signs around campus.",

Equal weight to each.\n\n17% Bonds/Treasury ETFs: EDV\n\n50% Individual Stocks:  I play long term dividend stocks, 5G, Autonomous and Electric Vehicles, and AI/Robotics atm with a portion that goes to the five ARK ETFs and some leveraged ETFs like TMF and SSO.\n\nI harvest dividend stocks for cash and keep it in a separate HYSA.  I like dividend stocks for this purpose only.  With each one I intend to invest just enough to get one share a quarter through DRIP.  First year you sell 2 shares and keep 2 shares.  This provides you income and growth and you never have to invest in the stock again.  Eventually you will be able to sell 3 shares a year while keeping 3 and so on.  You usually have to pick stocks that will be around for at least 10 years to see a full return of your investment if the yield is around 5%.  I currently have T stocks set up this way and am now working on VZ.  Both are good 5G plays in my opinion as well so I expect they will see 100%+ ROI.\n\nYou may want to increase your exposure to bonds.  They are nice to sell off during a downturn like right now to provide you with some additional dry powder to buy stocks with.  With my 17% allocation, I sold a quarter of my shares last week.  If the overall market sees another 10% drop, I will sell another quarter.",

Mind you, Air Freight is not a viable way to transport some things, but for a lot of industries Air Fright is allowing them to \"patch\" their supply line disruptions by rushing parts from China to the USA.\n\nAnything that shortens that time and makes it easier to get in parts and material from China and alternate suppliers will help.

As OP stated, Trump is brazenly corrupt and reckless and dishonest, so once you lift the restrictions that any sane or reasonable or honest person would respect, it's easy to see what could happen.\n\nRate cuts: he and his unqualified minions have already successfully manipulated Powell and the Fed into a wholly unnecessary rate cutting mindset.  Over 70% of analysts now *expect* more cuts.  He's been crying like a baby for negative interest rate policy for a year.\n\nSecond, you don't need actual tax cuts, you just need *announcements* of tax cuts.  He can't pass any legislation, and the one and only big piece he did pass during his whole term was a huge cut for billionaires/corporations. So he doesn't have to actually *pass* legislation, he just needs to *promise* it.  And guess what he just started doing again: promising some mysterious \"middle class\" tax cut.   The cuts can be as fraudulent as the last ones.  His followers ar paying more but claiming they're not.  Reality has no meaning.\n\nBut then you say there's nothing else he can do.  So wrong.  He can declare fake victory in his fake trade war against China.  Like everything he says, it can be a lie.  Look at what his fake and bizarre \"phase one deal\" announcement did to supercharge stock prices.  Him declaring \"the war is over\" (again) will elevate stocks.  He'll know that following the election he can just declare a new fake war if he feels like it or if his age-related paranoia kicks in.\n\nNext, he can make fraudulent \"infrastructure\" promises.  This is why I really wish the idiot Democrats would claim \"Infrastructure bill\" as one of their main platforms, like how reasonable health care or new green deal or student loan relief are indelibly associated with the Dems.\n\nWhichever party *credibly* owns the promise to create millions of jobs to repair our decaying infrastructure, that party will win. (If the Dems weren't so dumb they would have made New Green Deal a job stimulus concept instead of an ecological one.).  And just the announcement of such an infrastructure initiative is guaranteed to pump some of the most beaten down sectors and names.",

Lack of PJ, improper venue, even SJ since it\u2019s all federal securities (though many states have their own securities regulatory bodies).\n\nNow, there are jurx that don\u2019t follow mandatory arbitration (LA, NC) so technically those RH users in these states could file and not necessarily get bumped out on the MtD phase. However, since this is mainly federal stuff, I still think most courts will defer to FINRA.\n\nThe main strategy would be to file in court and then immediately leverage settlement before the judge rules on dismissal. Settlement for each individual case would be low and so would be the bargaining power of the potential plaintiff. You\u2019d want to consolidate all actions into a class. The problem with this is it takes time and then you\u2019ll have fights over class cert. that can move the settlement needle back and forth.",

I'd wager that 4/5 of the posts that you're complaining about don't even see the light of day. Which should impress and terrify you.\n* It's difficult trying to strike a balance. The public attention has brought a lot of legitimate traders here who just want to share their experience, real DD, technical analysis, etc and we want to encourage that. They obviously make new accounts and we want them to contribute immediately.\n* We're tweaking things everyday in response to rapidly changing growth and news that swings the entire sub in a matter of hours (like our pumping problem last week). This weeked now everyone is talking about their local Costco, committing bioterroism, and killing the pope. Also, please calm the fuck down with killing the pope, guys. It's borderline enciting violence, I've temp banned a few people who take it wayyyy too far.\n* Our sexuality aside, we're volunteers from around the world. Our hours and availability differ, so there are mod lulls where a lot of one liner shitposts get through. We do our best, but we really focus on providing the best experience we can for you guys during trading hours when the engagement here is through the roof.\n* As far as you or others wanting to volunteer, you guys actually do a pretty good job en mass with downvoting and reporting bullshit. Keep it up. We appreciate that.\n\nThat's all I got at the moment. Hope it gives you some kind of something.",

I'd wager that 4/5 of the posts that you're complaining about don't even see the light of day. Which should impress and terrify you.\n* It's difficult trying to strike a balance. The public attention has brought a lot of legitimate traders here who just want to share their experience, real DD, technical analysis, etc and we want to encourage that. They obviously make new accounts and we want them to contribute immediately.\n* We're tweaking things everyday in response to rapidly changing growth and news that swings the entire sub in a matter of hours (like our pumping problem last week). This weeked now everyone is talking about their local Costco, committing bioterroism, and killing the pope. Also, please calm the fuck down with killing the pope, guys. It's borderline enciting violence, I've temp banned a few people who take it wayyyy too far.\n* Our sexuality aside, we're volunteers from around the world. Our hours and availability differ, so there are mod lulls where a lot of one liner shitposts get through. We do our best, but we really focus on providing the best experience we can for you guys during trading hours when the engagement here is through the roof.\n* As far as you or others wanting to volunteer, you guys actually do a pretty good job en mass with downvoting and reporting bullshit. Keep it up. We appreciate that.\n\nThat's all I got at the moment. Hope it gives you some kind of something.",

        "body": "since no ones helped you out\n\noptions are contracts entered into by you and someone else (a counter party). There's 2 types of options, puts and calls. If you look at OP's picture you'll see that one of his \"trades\" is for SQQQ $29 CALL 3/20.\n\nSo he wants to buy a call. Now, like I said this call is a contract between OP and someone else. This contract states that at anytime between the day that OP purchases the call contract and the expiration date of the contract, stated as 3/20/2020. OP has the 'option' or choice to buy 100 shares of the etf SQQQ from the counter party of the contract for $29 regardless of what the actual price of the ETF is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo theoretically, if on 3/15 SQQQ is trading at $50 a share, OP can exercise his option and buy those 100 shares for $29 dollars from the counter party and sell those shares immediately in the open market for $50. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe downside is that OP has to pay the counter party a 'premium' in order to have this option. Right now the premium has a bid/ask of $2.65 x 2.95. So if OP wants to buy the call he has to pay $2.95 x 100 (per share, remember the call gives op the right to buy 100 shares from the counter party). Now, you may be asking, why is the spread so wide? Wouldn't OP immediately lose $30 or 10% on his trade? Is OP gambling with probably zero actual insight on investing? I'll let you figure those out on your own.",

The rollout of a CDC-designed test kit to state and local labs has become a fiasco because it contained a faulty reagent.

Shale wells have a high decline rate and need to be re-fracked every so often.\n\nWith oil prices dropping, it might no longer make sense to keep investing capital into oil production. It could also be possible there simply isn't enough oil storage to hold all the excess production.\n\nWith supply now dropping all it takes is for demand to immediately return that will spike the price up. There will now not be enough oil supply to meet demand which will cause prices to skyrocket.

Get the patient into an isolation room. Rule out other possible causes. Notify county and state health officials.\n\nNow, the student health center is setting up a similar planning session.\n\n\nThere have been no suspected cases of Covid-19, the illness caused by the virus, at the University of Rochester. But the school, with more than 12,000 students in western New York state, knows it might not stay that way.\n\n\u201cWe need to really get on top of things early,\u201d said Dr. Ralph Manchester, vice provost and director of University Health Service, the student health center.\n\nColleges and universities across the U.S. are updating pandemic protocols in anticipation of potential widespread outbreaks of the fast-moving virus. They have a unique challenge that can\u2019t be addressed by setting work-from-home policies, the way companies can. On campuses, thousands of students live in close quarters, with communal bathrooms and dining facilities.\n\nSchools look far different than they did during the H1N1 flu pandemic in 2009. The college student population has grown more diverse and mobile in the past decade, and faculty have more research relationships with counterparts in far-flung regions. That means plenty of people with recent travel to, or other connections with, China, South Korea, Europe and elsewhere.\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS\n\nWhat is the conversation on your college campus like around the topic of coronavirus? Join the conversation below.\n\nColleges say they are following guidelines established by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, including recommending 14-day self-isolation for individuals who may have been exposed.\n\nFour students at three schools in the Los Rios Community College District around Sacramento are in isolation, after being exposed to an individual who tested positive in northern California. The University of California, Davis, said Saturday evening it had released three students\u2014one being tested, and that person\u2019s roommates\u2014from isolation after the results came back negative for the virus.\n\n\nThe American College Health Association, an organization of campus health programs at more than 1,100 institutions, created a task force on the virus 10 days ago. \u201cAnd it is as if we have been shot out of a cannon since then,\u201d said Dr. Jean Chin, an associate clinical professor of medicine at the University of Georgia who is chairing the new group.\n\nThe team is reviewing guidelines from the CDC, World Health Organization, the U.S. State Department and other authorities, distilling medical literature into digestible advisories for campus communities and establishing guidelines to help members prepare for the disease.\n\nThe University of Rochester established a Coronavirus University Response Team in February, looking at everything from emergency response and public health to addressing possible xenophobia, monitoring international travel and planning for the potential impact on applications and enrollment.\n\nThe University of Colorado Boulder created a pandemic section for its emergency operations plan in 2015, and one for infectious disease a year later. The guidelines lay out things like how to coordinate with local health officials and various containment measures once a threat has been identified. The campus has roughly 35,500 students.\n\nDecisions such as halting campus operations would depend on how many cases were confirmed and where the affected people live, said Dan Jones, Boulder\u2019s associate vice chancellor for integrity, safety and compliance.\n\n\nSome schools don\u2019t have to dust off their doomsday guides because they have recently battled contagious diseases. Syracuse University had dozens of confirmed cases of mumps in late 2017 and had to coordinate closely with the CDC and county and state health departments.\n\nA few years ago, Rochester had roughly 200 reported cases of norovirus, whose symptoms include vomiting and diarrhea. Dr. Manchester said there were likely closer to 1,000 people affected.\n\nThe last six weeks of spring semester that year, the university was in \u201call-out \u2018control-this-outbreak\u2019 mode,\u201d Dr. Manchester said. The school stepped up regular cleaning services, switched to packaged-food distribution rather than open buffets like salad bars, and even swapped out buckets of coffee stirrers for individually wrapped ones.\n\nSchools see coronavirus preparation as a good opportunity to remind students and others to maintain proper hygiene, including covering coughs with arms and not hands, staying home when sick and washing hands regularly. To get the message out, they are sending emails, issuing flashing alerts on central websites and posting signs around campus.",

I like dividend stocks for this purpose only.  With each one I intend to invest just enough to get one share a quarter through DRIP.  First year you sell 2 shares and keep 2 shares.  This provides you income and growth and you never have to invest in the stock again.  Eventually you will be able to sell 3 shares a year while keeping 3 and so on.  You usually have to pick stocks that will be around for at least 10 years to see a full return of your investment if the yield is around 5%.  I currently have T stocks set up this way and am now working on VZ.  Both are good 5G plays in my opinion as well so I expect they will see 100%+ ROI.\n\nYou may want to increase your exposure to bonds.  They are nice to sell off during a downturn like right now to provide you with some additional dry powder to buy stocks with.  With my 17% allocation, I sold a quarter of my shares last week.

Mind you, Air Freight is not a viable way to transport some things, but for a lot of industries Air Fright is allowing them to \"patch\" their supply line disruptions by rushing parts from China to the USA.\n\nAnything that shortens that time and makes it easier to get in parts and material from China and alternate suppliers will help.

Possibly garnished a lot more as I def don't need $15k/mo to maintain my lifestyle.

They don't even need to have one every day. They could just have it every other day and give important updates, take a few questions, and be done\n\nSecond, the longer he talked today the worse it got. It's like he was just rambling on, and eventually as he kept getting asked more and more stuff, he just started either repeating things, or coming up with something dumb to say\n\nThird, I've watched every press conference, and half the stuff he was saying came straight out of left field. What happened to his serious tone of we are going to do what it takes and pull together and get through this? Now all of a sudden he acts like it's over, when we haven't even gotten into the worst part of it here. Like where the fuck did this come from?\n\nI agree the economy is important and we can't just let it tank bc of this virus, but we are not going to be ready to open back up in 1 week. We need at least 2-3 more weeks, and probably a month before we are ready to slowly start lifting restrictions in specific areas. He shouldn't be saying shit like we are going to open up next week, because he doesn't know that. He should have just said that in a week they would evaluate where we are. But they should do that every day. He shouldn't be expecting us to open up in a week, and he definitely shouldn't be telling the American people that we might. He's putting it in people's heads that we are almost through this, and this is the worst possible time for him to say that. Now is the most crucial time for us to be cracking down and stopping the spread. People need to take it seriously right now so that it isn't a problem later, and it's like he doesn't understand that.",

That's only because if you start (and continue) to invest because you somehow believe \"I should start investing\" or \"I should be consistently investing\" (what brokers would have you believe, to ensure their survival) rather than \"I have found a good investment\" then you will always invest an inopportune moments. Buffett invests on very long timelines, using historical trends and ratios as a guide, whereas many investors look at more recent information, and only start investing at the point where recent history shows good returns. I'd say when recent history shows poor returns but long term history shows good, and the particular company you're looking to invest in has some kind of difficult to emulate competitive advantage (be it financial, operational, market, or some combination thereof) then go and invest. Otherwise, keep your money on the sidelines (and let it pile up) whilst you observe the market/industries/companies and wait for a great opportunity to buy. This is what the Oracle does, I think.",

That can range from servers to applications. Technology vendors have been developing \u201ccloud\u201d technology for years and have been pushing this to market. However, because true cloud or \u201cpublic cloud\u201d is hosted in a vendors data center people are skeptical of using vendors because they don\u2019t control everything. This means all the responsibility is on the vendors to secure everything. \n\nSince cloud is the new way of deploying IT solutions and people are starting to accept the model more governments want in on the benefits of cloud. \n\nBut since the government won\u2019t be in full control of the cloud (see Microsoft, IBM, AWS, Oracle gov data centers) they need a way to ensure security, deployment, and capabilities are met.
