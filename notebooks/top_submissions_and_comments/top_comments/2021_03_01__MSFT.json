He rolls his eyes as he realizes he'll be sleeping on the couch tonight since his wife's boyfriend is sleeping over tonight. He continues scrolling through WSB reading every retarded post about him he can find.  He begins to feel sadness and a lump in his throat and he thinks about his 401k being down 2.5 points on the day.  Tears swelling in his eyes as he hears the unmistakable sound of a hand slapping and smacking his wife's bare ass as she moans in pleasure as her boyfriend rails her for the fifth time tonight. Jimmy knows he will never be able to satisfy his wife the way her boyfriend can.  He closes WSB as the tears of disappointment and rage roll down his face.  How dare these selfish retail traders, who know nothing about investing, question me and CNBC!  How dare they make money! MONEY IS FOR HEDGIES ONLY! he exclaims. He navigates to his bookmarks to find his favorite cuck porn help him relieve the swelling rage, anger, and fear that have been building within him over the past two months.  How much more of this can I take he wonders and he manually stimulates himself to cuck porn while his wife and her boyfriend begin round six in the next room over, all the while tears streaming down his face.  Finally after several hours he achieves a sweet release however his anger still remains balled up inside him.  In a fit of rage he throws his $IBM toughbook to the floor and pulls out his $T $AAPL iPhone and heads over to $TWTR where he goes on an 18 tweet rant about the retards on WSB before he finally passes out after his 9th $BUD.",

I will shamelessly slap my DD on your post so that these lost retards may see the light.\n\nTldr; They have used machine learning and AI to solve/map genetic pathways in yeast to create almost any molecule at production scale. \n\nOnce it runs, this is literally a fucking money printer. \n\nThe modded yeast eat sugar and shit out a more expensive molecule (like CBD). They already have mapped out 400+ molecules. Its like they have a machine where if you feed it a dime, it spits out a quarter. Even a retard can understand this math.\n\nThey have the google maps for yeast and everyone else is navigating by the stars. And they patented the shit out of all the major streets so no one can follow them.\n\nIf green sustainability had a dick, it would have such a huge hard on for this company. They replace dirty chemistry with clean, sustainable, low cost, and better organic chemisty.\n\nHow did they get so fucked in the first place? \n\nThey tried biofuels but gas prices went down so they got boned and couldn't compete. They pivoted to flavors and fragrances because that stuff is worth more per kilogram than fuel. So they rested there like a wounded animal while still dumping 70M into RnD yearly. And now bankruptcy is off the table. Their consumer brands are taking off and they are rising like a goddamn yeast phoenix. It cost them 2B to get to this point.\n\nWhy should you buy? - Pick from the list below. I know you've put your money in tickers with less potential.\n\nThey are a part of BioMade which is the U.S. initiative for a syntheic bio industrial revolution. Think about it, fermentation plants across the U.S. and it becomes the largest chemical/raw materials exporter. \n\n- 13 molecules at commercial scale and 18 in the pipeline. They can take any molecule to commercial scale in under a year.\n- they are making a protein platform, beyond meat and impossible foods better watch out. \n- they can claim \"all natural\" on all their products\n- The golden goose tendie machine - yeast map\n- vaccine play - they produce squalene which is used as an adjuvant to boost vaccine efficacy. It also saves millions of sharks from being killed\n- they teamed up with IDRI to create a 2nd gen vaccine an SA-mRNA vaccine that can be stored room temp for 8months, longer if kept cold.\n- they worked with DARPA living foundries program to develop their machine learning\n- they make sustainable jetfuel with the Navy https://twitter.com/DARPA/status/1313500978864324608\n- they are working on a monoclonal antibody platform, no more twiddling hamster ovaries\n- also HMO (titty milk sugars) platform, and an mRNA (printing vaccine antigen) platform. \n- they have created next gen sweeteners which will help our fat asses consume less sugar without the fake taste. and they are partnering with Raizen on it\n- they are a cannabis play - they produce CBD and CBG at commercial scale (there is a lawsuit but it looks frivolous, just look up the lawyers on both sides. Amy is going to be fine)\n- Its P/S multiple is around 10-15x and similar companies have 100x.\n- its only 3B mcap. This thing can run.\n- 5 years ahead of competitors \n- 800+ patent wall. They have locked yeast down.\n- their tech is being applied to other organisms too\n\nImagine an economy that can produce chemicals sustainably and if a pandemic arises, it can immediately shift production to counter it.\n\nThis is a ten year trip to Tendie Town. You can hop off whenever you have had your fill. You retards are looking at the next (Genetic) Microsoft. Machines are here to help us master DNA. Synthetic Bio is the future.\n\n\n\nWant more DD?\n\nThis is the Amy starter package - an intro to the tendie machine.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/hbAmYkX1Lus\n\nhttps://youtu.be/os5CB2NN5k0\n\nhttps://www.webcaster4.com/Webcast/Page/2101/38935",

Worst of all, their cost of revenue went WAY up on last earnings.  Future business should be getting cheaper for a mature company like PLTR, they aren\u2019t a startup.  My last problem with them, too many fan boys who are trading emotionally rather than logically.  PLTR will grow steadily but they will not be busting out to 100B+ anytime soon.  Give it a few more quarters and let them prove they can beat their numbers, retain customers, and reduce their cost of revenue until you put too much into them.",

        "body": "Alright, I'll play devil's advocate.\n\nGamestop is a game retailer, not directly part of the gaming industry. The videogame industry is continuing to blow up but it's shifting more and more to digital goods.\n\nGamestop has yet to adapt, or give any long term plans about how it will adapt. None of the current online storefront runners, like Microsoft, Sony, Nintendo, Valve, not Epic have any reason to give Gamestop a place in their ecosystems for no reason. Especially since for Microsoft and Sony, their ecosystem is how they make all the money back from selling consoles at a loss.\n\nLooking at the PC market for example, getting any sort of beachfront in the store market share is brutal. Epic games spent years spending outrageous amounts of money doing things like giving away free games and large discounts to attract users, and they still didn't make more than a scratch until Fortnite came along. Origin and Uplay are both seen as annoyances rather than desirable services.\n\nSo given all that, I don't see what gamestop has to offer in the digital marketplace. Forget drive or investment experience or even business sense for a second, because unfortunately those don't mean anything if your company doesn't have anything to offer. The Gaming industry is definitely not going anywhere, but that doesn't mean gamestop won't either.\n\nPlus, RC and crew haven't actually released any sort of plan or direction for the company yet, so as of now it's still just kind of sinking without any future rescue in sight.\n\nThat's my devil's advocate opinion for it. There are some points it has in it's favor, but if they try to become a digital game retailer they're going to get destroyed mercilessly imo. They just don't have anything to sell or anything in exchange for one of the current big players to let them have a slice of the market \u00af\\\\\\_(\u30c4)\\_/\u00af",

If you learn nothing else from this long post, it's this: test your gut feelings against cold, hard facts to see how right or wrong you are. \n\nDevote yourself to learning and reading. Start with some basic metrics, like topline revenue, profit margin, ROE. Pick stocks, or industries, or sectors you think you understand. Commit to a certain number of hours per day or per week diving into numbers. \n\nStart making concrete predictions and holding yourself accountable. (ie: I think stock X will be at price Y on date Z.) Keep track of these predictions and review your work. A good one to start with is: \"Do you think the S&amp;P 500 will be higher or lower 3 months from today?\" What about 6 months? End of year? Evaluate your gut feelings against cold, hard facts. Do this for individual stocks too. Do it for AMZN, TSLA, NIO, RKT, CAT, JNJ, and MMM. Keep a spreadsheet. Document your accuracies and inaccuracies. \n\nWhile you're starting down your path, keep your real money relatively low risk. Either have your funds in low-risk plays, or only put a small amount of your funds into the high risk plays you're interested in. \n\nOn that note, one of the most important things to be honest with yourself about is, how well do you understand risk? How risky is it to put all your money into AAPL, vs MSFT, vs VOO, vs QQQ, vs (insert penny stock of choice here)? How do you tweak your portfolio so it matches your risk tolerance? \n\nThese are the things you should be focusing on. DD is only a small piece of the equation.",

If you had a crystal ball that says its gonna keep going for all of 2021, then yes you should switch asap. But many people (me included) think growth will be doing well again by the end of the month. Heck, growth/tech did wonderful monday.\n\n\nBut i think a decent strategy is to find something that does good in both worlds. You don't need to choose between risky tech and oil.

I personally can't see this happening, as the Fed has shown itself to be extremely dovish and is trying to recover the real economy first (jobs ans solvency issues). \n\nThere is also the huge debt problem they now have from all the money printing they've done, the easiest way for them to solve that is to inflate it away as quickly as possible, so long term high inflation seems like something they would try for.

That end of year statement was a bit of a \"Guh\" moment since everything I had earned plus some basically had evaporated.   But, wasn't like I was going to touch that money then.  I did nothing to change the strategy I had picked for investing and instead doubled up on my 401k contributions.\n\nBest decision I ever made in regards to my retirement investments -- I came out way ahead because I was able to buy more while everything was recovering.\n\nMy biggest regret over the last year is when COVID hit I was too focused on the disaster itself and neglected to make any real changes to how I was investing to take better advantage of it.  If this continues and goes deeper - don't look at it as a loss if your investing for the long term.  Look at as an opportunity to get more potential long term value out of the money you put in now. \n\nAs a current example - I bought NVIDIA because I believed they have a potential for real growth through the autonomous vehicle industry.  But, yeah stocks down since I invested in it.  Bought more this morning - why?  I **STILL** believe it's going to grow in the next 5-years because of the rise of autonomous vehicles tech.  *It's just on sale now.*",

        "body": "March 8 (Reuters) - The Dow climbed on Monday, led by stocks poised to benefit the most from an economic rebound as the $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief bill awaited a final Congressional vote this week, and heavyweight tech-related stocks swung between gains and losses.\n\nAfter the legislation won U.S. Senate approval on Saturday, President Joe Biden said he hoped for a quick passage of the revised coronavirus relief package by the Democrat-controlled House of Representatives so he could sign it and send $1,400 direct payments to Americans.\n\nProspects of more government spending and faster economic growth have stoked fears of a spike in inflation, sending the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield to near one-year highs.\n\nU.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, however, said on Monday the package would fuel a \"very strong\" U.S. recovery and she did not expect the economy to run too hot because of the increased spending.\n\nThe Dow hit a new record intraday high and was trading above its Feb. 24 record close. In the S&amp;P 500, the financial sector was the biggest boost, hitting a record as higher interest rates and a steeper yield curve helped banks. Industrials were right behind, also reaching a record high, while the materials sector neared an all-time peak. The technology sector was deepest in the red.\n\n\"This is an ideal traders' market with certain sectors and individual stocks performing better than the wider market, as investors pick and choose individual stocks that will perform better as the economy reopens,\" said Anthony Denier, chief executive officer of trading platform Webull.\n\nA slide in the big tech stocks that have driven the rally in equities since pandemic-induced lows of last March continued, with Apple Inc(AAPL), Nvidia Corp(NVDA), Tesla Inc(TSLA) and Alphabet Inc's(GOOG) Google leading declining shares on Nasdaq.\n\nTech stocks are particularly sensitive to rising yields because their value rests heavily on earnings in the future, which are discounted more deeply when bond returns go up.\n\nThe divergence between the tech stocks and non-tech stocks explains trading today, said Joe Saluzzi, partner and co-founder of Themis Trading in Chatham, New Jersey.\n\n\"The stimulus package will be certainly helping the bigger cap names,\" Saluzzi said, referring to non-tech stocks. \"The get-out and non-stay at home stocks are doing better now,\" he said.\n\nBy 3:09 p.m. ET (2009 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 416.64 points, or 1.32%, to 31,912.94, the S&amp;P 500 lost 3.83 points, or 0.10%, to 3,838.11 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 259.71 points, or 2.01%, to 12,660.44.\n\nBanks added about 1.7% as the yield on the benchmark 10-year note stood near a 13-month high, while airlines jumped about 5%.\n\nWalt Disney Co (DIS) jumped about 5.8% as California health officials set new rules that would allow Disneyland and other theme parks, stadiums and outdoor entertainment venues to reopen as early as April 1.\n\nGameStop Corp (GME) surged about 33% after the company said it had tapped shareholder Ryan Cohen to lead a transition to an e-commerce business.\n\nAdvancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.68-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.28-to-1 ratio favored advancers.\n\nThe S&amp;P 500 posted 124 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 390 new highs and 21 new lows.\n\n(Reporting by Herbert Lash in New York, Karen Pierog in Chicago and Medha Singh and Shashank Nayar in Bengaluru; Editing by Shounak Dasgupta and Lisa Shumaker)",
