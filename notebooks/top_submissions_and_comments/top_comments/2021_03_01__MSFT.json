The main reason was because I was too busy with work and family to spend time investing. It grew a lot because I was in some very good names.  I got more involved because I had rolled over a 401k to an IRA and needed to re-deploy.  There were too many good companies available really cheap so after I had invested the IRA I moved on to my Roth.  But since then I have invested into a more diversified but still very tech heavy portfolio.  I sold the Panasonic &amp; TSM first, then the QQQ, finally sold my last MSFT a couple months ago.  \n\nLately, I have been going with a much more active strategy holding usually 6-18 months.  I still have the first position I got into from Panasonic proceeds, $TEAM (I got in at $52.87/share).  \n\nMy advice would be don't get emotional about selling a position you have held for a really long time if you find a better opportunity.  I also think that the walking away for a long time was a good move for me because being this active takes a lot of time doing research and tracking the news.  It would have detracted from my career path and family to do it between 2018-2016 and my portfolio size wasn't large enough to make the extra returns worthwhile.",

Their valuation was $25B, and you need to pay a premium in order to acquire a company.  And the play wasn't a result of trying to get Slack's revenue or profit.  Microsoft has been pushing Dynamics *hard* as part of the O365 licensing model.  That's a direct competitor to SFDC.  And MSFT's message that their sales org is pushing is \"We hit all of your software needs with one license.\"  The biggest driver of upsales on O365 are Dynamics and Teams.  Bundling CRM and UCaaS is a gamechanger, and has been wildly successful for them.\n\nSFDC needed to be able to compete with that bundling.  So they bought the biggest competitor to Teams.  And they'll bundle it with SFDC licenses.\n\nTableau is a similar purchase.  BI is a huge play right now, and *also* a feature that MSFT is bundling with O365.  Adding Tableau into the fold allows SFDC to directly compete with MSFT on that front, too.\n\nThese aren't cookie jar acquisitions, they're competitive expansion via acquisition.",

No matter what position is taken (short or long) it is very difficult to accurately enter a trade, hit the target before hitting stop loss. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI day trade - not very successful - just enough success to cover my losses :P \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe problem with doing the \"opposite\", with the strategy I use, is this : \n1. The stocks I pick for day trading are large caps - e.g. - Apple, MSFT etc.\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n2. If you consider an up trending day, then the obvious position to take is a long position for the day.\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n3. On a typical day, a stock price is range bound - for example between $100-$101. \n&amp;nbsp;\n\n4. Typically, I would start building a long position when the price is near $100.2 and set a stop loss at $99.6 and target at $101. \n&amp;nbsp;\n\n5. Probabilistically, the long position on a large cap on a up trending day, is correct.  The problem really occurs when the price momentarily  (spike) drops to 99.6 and hits the stop loss (kills the trade).\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n6. Later in the day, of course the stock moves back to the target price. \n&amp;nbsp;\n\n7. It takes a long time to enter trades correctly and avoid stop loss. The basics of trading really do work over time - e.g. - always take positions with the trend (of the stock and the index). Always enter high probability trades (as per whatever trade indicators you use).  \n&amp;nbsp;",

Had you been accumulating Microsoft over the years since 2004, you'd be doing pretty well today.  I think the special dividend is meant to show that they value the shareholders and payback that growth.  They want to be considered a fintech company though (a growth company) and not a value stock, so I would imagine they will resist issuing more dividends in the near term.  That doesn't mean 10 years from now they wont.  This is the kind of stock you hold on to (IMO) and don't worry about \"thinking it will dump\".  As I've described the price will take at least a 5% loss (probably more) after March 9th when people sell after the div payment.  What they don't realize is by doing that they are actually losing money. Yes they got the dividend but they also took the share price decrease and the additional decrease from the other sellers, which in the example above, would be more than the $1,100 you get issued (i.e. a net negative investment). You can short term play it if you like but your profits are only going to be in what the stock price rises between now and the div payment.  If you plan to sell directly after March 9, just know you are probably losing money.  You would need to hold after the 9th until the stock price rises a bit (hopefully).  OR you can just continue to hold a great stock, which to me is the better move.",

Look at as an opportunity to get more potential long term value out of the money you put in now. \n\nAs a current example - I bought NVIDIA because I believed they have a potential for real growth through the autonomous vehicle industry.

        "body": "March 8 (Reuters) - The Dow climbed on Monday, led by stocks poised to benefit the most from an economic rebound as the $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief bill awaited a final Congressional vote this week, and heavyweight tech-related stocks swung between gains and losses.\n\nAfter the legislation won U.S. Senate approval on Saturday, President Joe Biden said he hoped for a quick passage of the revised coronavirus relief package by the Democrat-controlled House of Representatives so he could sign it and send $1,400 direct payments to Americans.\n\nProspects of more government spending and faster economic growth have stoked fears of a spike in inflation, sending the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield to near one-year highs.\n\nU.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, however, said on Monday the package would fuel a \"very strong\" U.S. recovery and she did not expect the economy to run too hot because of the increased spending.\n\nThe Dow hit a new record intraday high and was trading above its Feb. 24 record close. In the S&amp;P 500, the financial sector was the biggest boost, hitting a record as higher interest rates and a steeper yield curve helped banks. Industrials were right behind, also reaching a record high, while the materials sector neared an all-time peak. The technology sector was deepest in the red.\n\n\"This is an ideal traders' market with certain sectors and individual stocks performing better than the wider market, as investors pick and choose individual stocks that will perform better as the economy reopens,\" said Anthony Denier, chief executive officer of trading platform Webull.\n\nA slide in the big tech stocks that have driven the rally in equities since pandemic-induced lows of last March continued, with Apple Inc(AAPL), Nvidia Corp(NVDA), Tesla Inc(TSLA) and Alphabet Inc's(GOOG) Google leading declining shares on Nasdaq.\n\nTech stocks are particularly sensitive to rising yields because their value rests heavily on earnings in the future, which are discounted more deeply when bond returns go up.\n\nThe divergence between the tech stocks and non-tech stocks explains trading today, said Joe Saluzzi, partner and co-founder of Themis Trading in Chatham, New Jersey.\n\n\"The stimulus package will be certainly helping the bigger cap names,\" Saluzzi said, referring to non-tech stocks. \"The get-out and non-stay at home stocks are doing better now,\" he said.\n\nBy 3:09 p.m. ET (2009 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 416.64 points, or 1.32%, to 31,912.94, the S&amp;P 500 lost 3.83 points, or 0.10%, to 3,838.11 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 259.71 points, or 2.01%, to 12,660.44.\n\nBanks added about 1.7% as the yield on the benchmark 10-year note stood near a 13-month high, while airlines jumped about 5%.\n\nWalt Disney Co (DIS) jumped about 5.8% as California health officials set new rules that would allow Disneyland and other theme parks, stadiums and outdoor entertainment venues to reopen as early as April 1.\n\nGameStop Corp (GME) surged about 33% after the company said it had tapped shareholder Ryan Cohen to lead a transition to an e-commerce business.\n\nAdvancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.68-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.28-to-1 ratio favored advancers.\n\nThe S&amp;P 500 posted 124 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 390 new highs and 21 new lows.\n\n(Reporting by Herbert Lash in New York, Karen Pierog in Chicago and Medha Singh and Shashank Nayar in Bengaluru; Editing by Shounak Dasgupta and Lisa Shumaker)",

Probably the best CEO in the space as well. \n\nI also like Qualcomm a lot for similar reasons, but also because they\u2019re positioned to win big in 5G and will probably do well in the IoT space as well.

The newest Ryzen chips are incredible, in terms of price to performance, and their newest set of graphics cards, while suffering from the same shortage as their only real competition, nVidia, have on par performance specs for 25% less. I've been an Intel/nVidia user since I built my first PC years ago, but in the last few generations of chips and cards, I've always recommended AMD products to my friends looking to build PCs. In fact, if you look on the logicalincrements website, which is a very popular resource for speccing out a new PC, each and every recommended CPU is AMD. They were small, and overlooked in the past, but they are dominating as of late.\n\nLooking at the prices of the stocks, AMD is still less than 1/3 the market cap of NVDA, despite the fact that NVDA only makes GPUs, while AMD makes both CPUs and GPUs. If you look at Intel, they have 2.5x the market cap of AMD, and they only make CPUs.\n\nWith the way AMD's chips have been performing, and the fact that they are outperforming on both isles of the PC gaming industry, I think they'll end up doing very well.

I\u2019m keeping tabs on AMAT, TSM, LRCX, NXPI, FORM, UMC).\n\nThen finally the rare earth metals.. companies like MP, AMAT, VALE (I was long on these guys then they got a fucking $7B fine for killing 300 people in a dam explosion.... oops).\n\nLook into Biden\u2019s recent executive order, not only does he address the global semiconductor shortage, but plans to bring jobs back to the states and invest in American companies. MP Materials is the only US based company REM company. \n\nThis all looks so obvious as a long term play. I forget where I read it, but the global semiconductor usage is going to 10x or something insane like that in the next 10 years.\n\nI don\u2019t know why all of these companies are down recently, I haven\u2019t looked into it. I bought $10 worth of every stock listed above so I could keep tabs on them. All of them have followed the same negative trajectory the last month or so. If you zoom out to 5 year though, almost every single company shows insane growth. I imagine that growth will only compound long term. Do you have any thoughts on the reason for this recent downward trend? \n\nI\u2019m considering making a pretty massive 5-10 year long play on semiconductors.",

They\u2019re in their growth phase and will be for a long time. \n\nThe bear case is that Cosair\u2019s niche is very specific and they could face big hurdles if Logitech steps up its game or Nvidia decides it wants to get into the market. \n\nFubo could face mergers by other competitors like we saw between DraftKing and Dish. HOWEVER, the reason why I\u2019m so bullish on Fubo and why this recent dip is a massive buying opportunity is that Dish + DraftKing merger is not even a big threat. Dish is LOSING 100,000+ subscribers quarterly. Why? Because unlike Fubo, it requires satellite (not the future). Also, Verizon has a 7%+ stake in Fubo which gives it a lot of potential partners. Fubo\u2019s financials are getting hit because they\u2019re focusing on spending NOW to grow their customer base as fast as possible during the pandemic. Don\u2019t be too alarmed by their missed earnings and remember, even a behemoth like Amazon was not profitable for a long time.",
