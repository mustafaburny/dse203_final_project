I guess as much as anything, we should be looking beyond what happens next month as you suggest. \n\nEven if it's not a V shaped recovery, it doesn't make it a market that you shouldn't invest into. \n\nIt just means you need to adjust your expectations and further your timeline. This market is rewarding companies that have navigated well not just throughout the Corona Virus, but have also stood the test of time. \n\nApple and Microsoft both faced challenging times in their histories, but they made it through. \n\nWe've also been fully trained to be forward looking. That's why you have NKLA, TSLA, ZM, DKNG, LULU, DOCU, ADBE, NVDA all trading at crazy valuations. People are willing to gamble on the long term success of what they see as great companies.\n\nI think if you look at everything that has happened recently, we've all shrugged the effects of Covid-19 off, regardless of the consequences. \n\nWe're not slowing down the American economy anymore at this point. It took a heinous act for us to get off the couch and hit the streets, but it felt good to be back around other people again.

I really appreciate it.\n\n- software automation and AR tech will augment core products like MSFT and APPLE. Automated drawing on iPads? Yes. Software automations on O365 and Windows machines? Yes please. I think those acquisitions highlight their approach.\n\nApple and their relationship with Adobe is the biggest contender to FB. FBs reach is enormous but that may change with iPhone price decline in places like Mexico where Huawei has aggressively ran their footing.\n\n- brkshire vs Costco; comparison was supposed to highlight their MO of finding excellent quality (excellent value or product)\n\n- I view cloud computing as an distributor ML. Google's ML kit for example. Both are operators of massive data dams and rivers.",

Apple didn't become the giant company they are by being stupid.  \n\nThe interfaces are the same so for almost any other developer writing software for the Mac is going to be a similar proposition. Recompile, fix a bug or two. \n\nChip architecture is vastly abstracted away, even more now than it was 20 years ago when Apple went to Intel in the first place. Most software developers are writing in Javascript which can target web, mobile, and desktop (electron). Anyone writing native apps specifically for Mac will notice almost no difference because Apple will provide all the tools.  Anyone writing apps for something else is using Windows in the first place or if they are using a Mac they're compiling using virtualization which is going to work exactly the same way.\n\nVery few developers care about x86 vs anything else and any who do are probably already using Windows.",
