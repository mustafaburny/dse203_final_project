        "body": "What stocks are you referring to? Obviously there are stocks like Square, Enphase, etc. That were below 40$ a share a couple months ago and have tripled or more since then and are actual legitamite companies. I personally bought LRCX at 300$ a share a couple months ago and it's up 65% now, so it all depends on the company really.\n\n\nFor example: Tesla is like 600 bucks a share now and is still very volatile while many other 600$ per share stocks are not. NKLA is a very volatile 18$ stock while there are many stocks in that price range that are not as volatile. But TSLA ans NKLA are much more risky due to their tendancy to drop hard as well.\n\n\nThe point is that the stock price really does not determine anything. A volatile stock can make you a ton of money and it can lose you a ton of money just as easily.",

Been on a tear for years and does pay a dividend although yield is below 1%.  On a forward basis it's still cheap despite rising from $340 pre-covid to $480 now. \n\nHON - hella diversified and iirc a very solid balance sheet. Dividend is only 1.7% but their product diversification makes them a relatively safe long term play imo. \n\nWM - leading market share in waste disposal, so it has good long term prospects. Many defensive companies like WM often don't do too well but management has done a great job and the company has done very well for shareholders. 1.8% dividends, which again isn't very high, but at the same time it's more than doubled over the past five years.",
