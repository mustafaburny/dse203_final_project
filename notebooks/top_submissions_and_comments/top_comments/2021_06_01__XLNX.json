It they screw up only half as much on 7NM while doubling down on their own fabs they might be doomed. \n\nThey may also manage to turn it around. Anyway TSMC has the money to stay at the very least competitive with Intel amd this takes away Intels competitive advantage it enjoyed for so long a thing of the past. Bidens American Billion subsidies can't help intel. The problem of Intel has never been financial. They had enough money to buy back stock like crazy and they still have a shit-ton of money.\n\nAMD has been underlromising and overdelivering. I would expect this to continue.

The question is can amd keep beating earnings estimates. I'm betting that after a few good earnings it will go over 100 and surpass 52 week high either this quarter or 3rd quarter. Note they don't have to be blow out results as they only need to show investors that the downside risk is very low. \n\nIt's a wrap in the server space. One unique feature which is huge in new amd chips is the hyperviser security which essentially is specifically made for virtual containers made for cloud provider like Google cloud. The gaming market, especially the higher end is a kill too, but this is a very small business for amd.",

Tons of people are hoping for a strong showing, as the technology can literally make people obtain from 30% to 200% better FPS from GPU products.\n\n\\- Q2 financials reporting to be released on the last week of July (specific date not announced yet). I'm expecting a beat here, as they raised their guidance during the Q1 results... and likely their execution is exceeding their own expectations.\n\n\\- 5700G and 5600G APUs to be released for sale in early August\n\n\\- Q3 results sometime in October 2021. Again, I expect a beat vs. their 50% sales increase guidance. Mostly as new products will begin ramping to deal with the Q4 holiday season (e.g. Valve handheld).\n\n\\- Before the end of the year, the Xilinx deal should be closing.\n\n\\- Sometime in early December, there should be news on the Samsung S22 (High-end Galaxy mobile line-up), which will bring AMD graphics and is expected to clean the floor on the mobile industry. This is VERY important... as if they have a great showing, many more mobile players may license AMD technology.\n\n\\- Mid-December, there should be more clarity on the release of Zen3 stacked Cache technology, which will provide an extra 15% performance average to FPS boost. Consumers are very excited with this technology, as the cache would go up drastically.\n\n\\- Before the X-mas holidays, Valve should be release their portable handheld device. It is expected to have AMD hardware (likely an APU) which should be more powerful than Nintendo's Switch and likely take the crown in the portable gaming arena.\n\n\\- Lastly, Zen4 and RDNA3 are planned for 2022. The leaks so far are just incredible, but there should be more info towards the end of 2021. Some leaks have already indicated that Zen4 will have 128 cores (256 threads). This is just ludicrous!!!... but AMD is used to increasing cores and leaving Intel in the dust. RDNA3 on the other hand is expected to have 2.8x performance vs. the 6900XT... which is a GIGANTIC LEAP in performance that is simply unheard of. Never has a new GPU architecture brought so much performance vs. a prior generation. This is mostly thanks to MCM design (multichip).\n\nKeep in mind that neither of these products will be cheap... they are enthusiast or workstation products, but the push the boundaries of technology quite radically.\n\nHope that provides some color on the upcoming events, product launches and financial reporting. In any case, I plan on writing a new article in a couple of weeks, with updates.",

You can then have an on-demand co-processor for the specific application that is hogging resources from the CPU, such as graphics processing (GPUs), for example. \n\nIn the absence of ideas what to use the FPGA for, you can instantiate a soft processor core (soft-core, hihi) on-demand ,such as the Xilinx Microblaze (hihi again), to off-load processing from the hard-cores (hihi once again). This means that you don't need to have 8 core CPUs any more with 6 cores idle. Rather, you can have a 2-core processor that scales as needed.",

        "body": "The basic gist is that AMD bought Xilinx for 35 B in an all stock deal. This means a sort of dilution for AMD when it occurs, The deal as it stand would mean that for every share of Xilinx the holder will get 1.7 shares of AMD when it it done. If AMD keeps going up it would mean that AMD is no longer paying an effective 35 B, and they will be paying more. Thus the Arbitrage would be to short AMD to lower the price so AMD gets cheaper deal but also buy Xilinx so you will get more AMD for less. The sus part about this was that if you look at the volume, the amount of sales in AMD does not equal the Xilinx purchasing. So it's a lot of AMD shorting by big funds. If Lisa comes out July 27th earnings and says that the merger is done because EU said it's good on June 30th and UK said it's good on July 6th, AND she says it's retroactive to July 15th it means that the shorts will be caught with their pants down because the merger price and share count is now one, so big funds will push in because its a 30 PE ratio as Nvidia is 80, and growing at 50% even after a covid year. It's a secular growth story and only growing with Tesla (EV infotainment) and Data center growth. Shorts need to cover as fast as possible or get wrecked. People who are holding will just raise their sell limits higher and it's recipe for a 15% moon to at least touch 100$ at all time highs. Then we can start an Nvidia climb of our own!",
