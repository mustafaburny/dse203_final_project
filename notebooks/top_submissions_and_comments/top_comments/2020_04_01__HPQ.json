        "body": "Things to love about Apple as business:\n\n* Other worldly return on invested capital going back a decade plus (which is downstream from everything that comes after)\n* Smartphones is a massive, stable market with an incredibly high ROI to their users: Apple derives $150bn+ of annual revenue from iPhones, most of that from North America and Europe. Despite how expensive smartphones are, tell me how much would I have to pay you to go back to using a Brick? $3000 per year? $5000 per year? The $350 / year of hardware + $500 / year of data that seemingly everyone gleefully pays is a function of just how amazing it is to have a computer / phone / camera in one, that fits in your pcoket, all with ubiquitous broadband speed internet.\n* Absurd brand premium to their products: Hardware assembly is infamously commoditized yet Apple's gross margin on its smartphones is 65% (compared to say 18% for HPQ); part of it is the pricing power Apple gets from the loyalty of its customer base, part of it is the sexiness of the design of their products. Android user = poor in New York, Los Angeles and many of the other cultural capitals of the world.\n* Customer lock in: Despite the designed obsolescence of its products, despite the high prices, despite the fact that many iPhone users (myself included!) don't even like the interface, almost all of us pony up the $700 every two years because a) the damn phones are in our palms 24/7 and it would be a nightmare to refamiliarize ourselves with a new OS, b) we'd lose the trade in value of our existing phone (though there is something of a secondary market so this isn't too crucial a factor as much as it was 5-10 years ago) and c) we've all bought so much other crap (cases, chargers, etc.) that we'd have to repurchase on top of the hardware if we switched to a different ecosystem\n* Network effect from ecosystem: the massive amount of users begets app developers, the app developers create apps that are specific to iOS which in turn begets users, Apple builds its own stuff (namely iMessage) that add to the ecosystem and is able to push services (see Apple Music) into that ecosystem, driving incremental revenue\n* Closed system = they own the ecosystem: Unlike the WinTel (+ Adobe) ecosystem of PCs in the 20 aughts or the Android ecosystem, Apple has a closed system with proprietary OS and processors.\n* Their suppliers are dependent on them / they are not dependent on suppliers: When it looks like Apple might be dependent on a supplier, they in house the capabilities, often driving the supplier bankrupt.\n\nBesides how great a business Apple is, the stock is valued much more rationally (usually mid to high teens P/E) and on current metrics than any other Tech giant therefore it makes sense that Buffett chose them and not say Facebook.\n\nEdit: fixed the size of iphone market",

        "body": "Thanks for your comment. A lot of what you said makes perfect sense. I agree with almost all the points you made but here are the parts that I am not sure about. \n\n \\&gt; Absurd brand premium to their products: Hardware assembly is infamously commoditized yet Apple's gross margin on its smartphones is 65% (compared to say 18% for HPQ); part of it is the pricing power Apple gets from the loyalty of its customer base, part of it is the sexiness of the design of their products. \n\nThey do have brand premium but the question is how much is it gonna last? Their brand premium comes from fantastic designs and breakthrough innovations from the past. In the last few years, they basically reproduced the same thing with minor changes. Ford had a great brand premium but when people started to realize they can buy Toyota for like 20% less the brand loyalty faded away (correct me if I am wrong cuz I'm not certain of numbers). Do you think people are willing to spend 700$ every two years + all the expensive accessories to buy a slightly changed iPhone? \n\nI have to disagree with the design part. If you look at their hardware and compare it to common android phones in the same price range you will see that Apple is not that great.  You can look at Galaxy S11 as an example. Big notch and bezzles and 60hz screen just to name a few downsides of iPhone. Again, I am not saying iPhones are bad but on a cost relative basis, there are better alternatives. \n\nAs far as the software goes, Apple is ahead of android in my opinion but is it worth paying that much more?",
