        "body": "Thanks for your comment. A lot of what you said makes perfect sense. I agree with almost all the points you made but here are the parts that I am not sure about. \n\n \\&gt; Absurd brand premium to their products: Hardware assembly is infamously commoditized yet Apple's gross margin on its smartphones is 65% (compared to say 18% for HPQ); part of it is the pricing power Apple gets from the loyalty of its customer base, part of it is the sexiness of the design of their products. \n\nThey do have brand premium but the question is how much is it gonna last? Their brand premium comes from fantastic designs and breakthrough innovations from the past. In the last few years, they basically reproduced the same thing with minor changes. Ford had a great brand premium but when people started to realize they can buy Toyota for like 20% less the brand loyalty faded away (correct me if I am wrong cuz I'm not certain of numbers). Do you think people are willing to spend 700$ every two years + all the expensive accessories to buy a slightly changed iPhone? \n\nI have to disagree with the design part. If you look at their hardware and compare it to common android phones in the same price range you will see that Apple is not that great.  You can look at Galaxy S11 as an example. Big notch and bezzles and 60hz screen just to name a few downsides of iPhone. Again, I am not saying iPhones are bad but on a cost relative basis, there are better alternatives. \n\nAs far as the software goes, Apple is ahead of android in my opinion but is it worth paying that much more?",

So these investors fell into some form of modern [cargo cult](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult) and overly attributed their success to their personality quirks. Startup founders know how to take advantage of this too, at around 2012ish a lot of founders started showing up to VC pitch meetings with messy hair and wrinkled hoodies just to subconsciously remind investors that they could be the next Zuckerberg.\n\nIn the end despite the amount of resources involved in the startup funding world, a lot of it is driven by human emotion and people doing dumb things like FOMO.",

        "body": "I'm just gonna jump in here because it isn't the first time I've seen \"short squeeze\" seemingly used incorrectly and I feel like maybe some of you don't really understand what it is. The chart we are seeing now cannot be a short squeeze nor can it be a \"short squeeze in reverse\".\n\nShorting a stock means you're borrowing shares from your broker and selling them to someone at the current price. The idea being that you think the price will go down and then you can buy them back at a lower price. So if you short XYZ today at $100/share and buy them back tomorrow at $90/share, you've made $10/share. If, on the other hand, the stock goes up to $110, you've lost $10/share.\n\nNow the tricky thing about shorting a stock is that there is no limit to the upside (of the stock price). When you buy a stock, the maximum you can lose is 100%. You buy it at $100 and it goes to zero, you've lost $100/share and can't lose more. That's it. But if you short a stock, your losses are theoretically unlimited. If you shorted TSLA at $300 you'd be in a world of pain when it hit $950 because that means your losses are $650/share at that point. Your downside (on the trade) is unlimited but your upside is limited to 100% (and that's if the shares go to zero).\n\nFor these reasons, you don't want to short a stock and hold on to it forever like you might if you were long. The pain of holding onto it as the losses mount become too much to bear, but also because you don't have an unlimited amount of money in your account. At some point, you will be FORCED to buy back the stock before the losses outstrip your funds.\n\nSo a short squeeze occurs after a stock has run up considerably and reaches a point where everyone who has shorted the stock is essentially forced to buy it back before it goes too high. At this point, you'll see a huge spike on top of a run up.\n\nThere is no real opposite to a short squeeze because when you hold stocks long, your max loss is 100% and no one is ever forced to sell. You can just hold on until zero. In real life, however, you will often reach a point where people just don't want to lose more money and get out anyway. When everyone is running for the exits and sells their stock at the same time, you'll see a huge downward spike after a run down. This is usually called capitulation and often signals a reversal to an uptrend.",

        "body": "For everyone wondering why the big miss (&amp; you're going to see this with every bank btw).\n\n- It includes the impact of adoption of the new credit loss accounting standard (CECL).\n\n- Day 1 (1/1/20 no COVID) impact goes through retained earnings (i.e. no income statement impact), but subsequent measurement (i.e. 3/31/20 big COVID) goes through income. Hence the massive pop in reserves.\n\n- Key difference between old GAAP and new GAAP is that you must now estimate the lifetime expected credit loss for your loans adjusted for forecasted conditions\n\n- They're likely using a multi scenario weighted model and would have shifted the weightings to reflect the COVID environment; think something like 80-10-10 of most stressed economic environment:moderate stressed economic environment:baseline\n\n- Subsequent Q's won't see as big an income statement impact as the delta between prior Q provision (officially Allowance for Credit Losses) and current Q provision shouldn't be as vast.\n\n- You effectively had a black swan event for this adoption where 1/1/20 (it's effective date), you wouldn't have weighted a stressed economic environment as heavily (if at all, we nearly had the tip in 30,000 DJI almost as recently as Feb), versus 3/31/20 the remeasurement date where you have to account for, well virtually total cessation of normal economic activity.\n\nSo when they speak to building reserves (FASB will have a conniption at that language btw), they've assessed their entire portfolio for lifetime expected credit loss. You see the numbers pop particularly in cards, which are unsecured and your loss given default would to all intents and purposes be 100% vs mortgage loans where you've collateral.\n\nAlso important to bear in mind that since ~2018 the bigger lenders have been keeping higher quality mortgage loans on the books (basically they aren't selling top quality 800 FICO stuff to FNMA FMCC much if at all).\n\nJPM are very well placed to weather this, as they were in 2008. It's a well run shop under Daddy Dimon.\n\n**TL;DR: Watch out for the banks who elect to defer CECL implementation because it likely meant their models adjusted for COVID gave them numbers they didn't want to push through Q1 earnings**\n\n**TL;DR of the TL;DR = Accounting rules fucked EPS in the ass but it shouldn't be as volatile going forward**",

I think this is okay to do here, because it's not the daily thread. \n\nI'm pretty new to WSB, but I have been trading [badly] for a long time, and I have to say it's felt like treading water. I used to think that unless I was some trust fund baby with 2mil in cash waiting to be invested, it was gonna be the long haul for me.\n\nThen I found WSB, and it was great, but with each gain, there'd be things I couldn't control, or I'd chase the advice of people who didn't really do their DD. I was convinced that with all the bad news we were getting, that stocks would plummet last week, as I learned the hard way something I [and I would imagine, all of us] already knew -- the market doesn't do what it is supposed to, it does what the MMs want it to do, and in the process it takes advantage of the common trader.\n\nBut every once in a while, we get someone like /u/Variation-Separate who not only takes the time to share his secrets, but breaks it down for us, interacts with the community, and even fucking gives us confidence when the market seemingly isn't following the prophecy. He doesn't have to do any of this.\n\nI cannot do what he does as well as he does it. Not yet. But I am thankful for the knowledge I've gained, thankful for the tendies, and thankful for having my faith in good people and challenging corrupt systems resurrected.\n\nMuch love, OP. It's a rough time for a lot of people out there. You're a godsend.",

I've got a bit riding on this, a lot of which will die if a viable downtrend doesn't start before May and I can't adjust. I don't subscribe to telling people diamond hands, or blindly worshipping VS. We all have to adapt. But I am incredibly appreciative for the time he's put into these posts and educating us.\n\nThat said, we have no idea yet what will actually happen long term. /u/Variation-Separate has put together a really compelling plan. He didn't have to share it. No one has to follow it. But if you, like me, believe that there is validity and truth in his analysis, then do your own DD to embrace that vibe. Yesterday, people were freaking out in the first two hours of intraday when there was no drop, then we plummeted. Today, we flirted with 252 and are at risk of another leg up. If in the last two days, you have decided that this uptrend in the market is enough to call it quits, no one can blame you, but I would argue, maybe VS's posts aren't for you. \n\nI am a bear rn. I'm a bear not just because I have positions that reflect it -- I truly believe we're in a bad spot, and corporations, MMs, the Fed are being really irresponsible right now.  We're being set up for some horrible economic rebuilding in the 2020s. The longer the market waits to reflect this, the more fucked ordinary people are when they do. They don't have our best interests in mind. Deep down, I want us all to get through this and come out on top.\n\nI hope I'm not foolish in thinking that, collectively, we have the tools and minds to figure this out and at least make a little money before things get really bad. It's a difficult time to have conviction, but that's why I'm here in this thread (and no longer checking the dailies). Keep strong, fellow autists.

If we hit 270, we are going to 300. It would be a sharper \"V\" shape recovery. \n\nTomorrow, or even next week, it is possible to do battle at 248 and win and signal a downward movement towards 231. Here we get into a faster free-fall.\n\nIt looks like a bear flag is happening on SPY and it is possible that the movement down is an escalator. If SPY breaks 263, the bear flag is pretty invalid IMO. VIX would mellow and we could reach the goal, but with more sideways trading (drawn out over months).\n\nCorrect or comment, please\n\nEdit: could also be other continuation patterns, but this theory more aligns with a quicker drop, like the bear flag...",

In order to delta hedge those contracts they are having to sell more underlying equities which is putting even more downwards pressure on the market. \n\nGiven that DIX is the second highest print the system has ever seen, even on a -5% day, it\u2019s likely that market makers are being forced to buy to prevent an even greater collapse. Correct me if I\u2019m wrong here but this could get ugly tomorrow.\n\nEdit: looking at December 2018 recovery we saw a large discrepancy between the DIX and GEX. DIX was in the high 40\u2019s and GEX was extremely negative. Negative gamma causes the movement of the market to be accelerated, no matter if it\u2019s up or down. In the 2018 recovery it was an upward movement...today we\u2019re seeing a downwards trend. This is why I think it will continue to trend downwards.",
