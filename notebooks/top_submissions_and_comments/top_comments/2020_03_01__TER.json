Note that there aren't many of them and that they are still relatively expensive (e.g. TER 0.2%, and 0.4% for the latter).\n\nSmall-cap single stocks, I don't recommend any, because I don't consider myself a good stock picker and already burnt my fingers with promising small caps. The other one I bought years ago has had a terrific run. Lab/Pharma company which reinvented itself successfully after more than 100 years. Unfortunately, I was a student back then and had neither more than a few hundred bucks to invest, nor any sophisticated knowledge of business. But hey, some luck and lots of intuition (or the other way around) - it's still a gem in my portfolio.\n\nI don't know how real estate will perform in the future, tbh. This sector had an incredible run in the past and led to the ascend of large-cap realtors like Vonovia. When it comes to tech, I'd consider B2B businesses. Let's face it, boring, dull, heavily-regulated businesses which no one other wants to do are our secret super-power. There might still some growth in SAP. Or payment services, like other posters here have already mentioned. Netherland-based Adyen is quite expensive though, and Wirecard's secrecy does not inspire tons of trust, unfounded or not. I think there could be exciting developments happening in Europe, as soon the barriers (legally and culturally) for cross-border services are teared down. A multi-lingual service economy already works well in Switzerland, for example.",
