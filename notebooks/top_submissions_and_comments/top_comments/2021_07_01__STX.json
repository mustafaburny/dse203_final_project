It's a person calling out a dam burst and there's no way you can time it or convince enough people in time to prevent it from happening. I myself believe in the things you say and have been expecting a crash for a long time now. None of these highs make sense or look sustainable in the long run. I am greatly concerned that the people do not understand that each subsequent crisis or string of bubbles is adding more dimensions to the unpredictable nature of the problem.

Folks, I know you don't want to plow through the SEC filings and nit pick them. But you really have to. Zy had already been borrowing massively from the dubious Perspective Credit Holdings II, **second line** in their s-1. When a company tells you it is in trouble, believe them. They RUSHED to IPO, with no revenue in Covid, because they were going to have to fork over everything to their creditors unless they had a big cash raise. They had a 100 million credit facility on December 31, 2020. They had liens on substantially all their assets when they IPO'd. Perceptive Credit Holdings will own every patent of ZY within days, now. Read your SEC docs, folks. Rely on teams with great lawyers and auditors that provide us with well crafted SEC filings in a timely manner. Edit: I mean it could still be salvageable because they raised about 548Mil in the IPO to service their debt, but the evidence was in the s-1s. And the analysts have only downgraded to hold, left them with a $12 instead of a $54. lol. who knows. My point is related to the SPAC vehicle and the SEC filings. Follow your teams and follow the quality, and please don't compare ZY to $DNA, they really do not match.",

I know very little about them.\n\nCHPT - Chargepoint - Their business model relies on the sales of cloud services to partners that provide colorful reports on charger utilization. The partner provides the power and in many cases the maintenance as well. Each charger nets them at least $300/year in revenue, with more if the customer buys a maintenance plan.\n\nEVGo - EVGo builds the infrastructure and pays for the power, and profits based upon how they bill customers. Their primary revenue source is customers using the network. Their prices are a bit high, but they are working on getting really valuable locations.  \n\n\nBLINK - They revenue share with the site hosting the charger and are mostly installing low-reliability chargers at usage prices that make gas look dirt cheap. Without a major change in their business model, I don't see this going far, but the upside is that low information site hosts (often in the hospitality industry) find them appealing.\n\nVOLTA - Advertising based free charging. The way I see it, these guys have figured out a way to buy billboard space in high traffic areas for &lt;$100/month in operational costs. Its a really clever business model. Not sure how sustainable it is, but maybe?\n\nElectrify America &amp; Tesla Superchargers - Automaker subsidiaries, so not independently traded. Probably closest business model-wise to EVGo, though with slightly different pricing strategies.\n\nI've probably left out some other charge equipment manufacturers, but I can't think of them right now.",

        "body": "Yep, at the end of the day: all investments are return mechanisms.\n\nYou lay out money today (principal) to get a return over time.\n\nTherefore, when the 10 year is at 1.2%, it doesn't even make sense to invest in bonds so people have been heavily investing in equities because the current S&amp;P earnings yield is around 3.3% (The S&amp;P PE ratio OP provided does not include Q2 earnings which means the real S&amp;P PE right now I think is between 29-30)\n\nA return of 3.3% with the ability to reinvest itself compared to 1.2% which is stagnant... not a hard decision to make there.\n\nThis is incredibly simplifying things but this is the general view that Buffett and Munger hold with investing. It's all about opportunity cost, and the benchmark they largely compare investments to (and discount future cash flows with) is the risk-free rate of return, which is the 10-year note.\n\n**EDIT:** The kicker of this highly unusual market is that many investors, like Buffett, seek 10% returns. If you see above, the TTM earnings of the S&amp;P is far from 10%, even with expected growth priced into the equation. BUT by pure investing standards, when the S&amp;P TTM earnings yield is over double the return of the 10-year yield... equities are without question the smarter investment. BUT (x2) is a 3.3% yield today (probably 4.5% by January 2022) a return you want to lock yourself in for the long term?.. BUT! (x3) Sitting in cash, or even government bonds, you're guaranteed to lose money with inflation..\n\nTLDR: The market is both objectively cheap and historically expensive. Some people call it a \"logical bubble\". Only time will tell what will happen, but remember the job of the investor is to not get sidetracked by macro factors and instead continue to assess the earning power of companies for the long term.",

Offerings with intel chips frequently outnumber AMD chips by 4:1 and they hold a significant portion of the market for inexpensive consumer machines and office workstations. They're not going away soon. They're starting to produce GPUs again, which may or may not go anywhere, but it's a consideration on a \\~5 year horizon.\n\nPersonally I don't think  who's going to \"win\" Intel vs AMD is really all that important in the market space. They're both good companies for different reasons. If intel doesn't turn things around design-wise in a couple years and start producing more competitive products (outside of the bargain and top-end ranges) rather than relying on market dominance, then there's reassessment that needs to happen.\n\nPersonally, I think the thing that really needs to be watched in that marketspace is what Nvidia does with ARM. If they can break ARM processors out of the mobile world into the desktop/notebook space then that's a shakeup that could affect the team red/blue balance. We really don't know where that's going yet, and until we do, I still like Intel (it's currently maybe 2% of my portfolio, notwithstanding however much may be held in ETFs).",

Also, I would love it if you can list several Large Cap Growth companies that pay a 3% or higher dividend. I know of one (BX) that has gone up quite a bit in the last 2+ weeks.\n\nNo one buys AAPL for their .60%, MSFT for their .79% dividend, or NVDA for their .80% dividend. Because you might be able to make more money opening up a Savings/checking account or a CD in a bank. People buy those stocks because of their growth. I own all 3 of those stocks. I've had NVDA for about 4 years and it has grown 415%. I've owned MSFT for a little over a 1 year and I am up 55%. I've owned AAPL since August of last year and I am up 18%. \n\nHowever, people will buy NLY specifically for its 10.37% dividend, or EPD specifically for its 7.98% dividend, or T specifically for its 7.42% dividend. But, none of those companies are considered \"Growth\" companies and of course, they do not grow much either.\n\nGrowth stocks similar to the ones you mentioned will never pay a high dividend, even though they could afford to. IBM pays a good dividend, but its stock never moves. Three years ago it was at a $152 and today, it is down to $140 (It's not a growth company). CVX pays a good dividend, but it grows at a snail's pace. Three years ago it was at $120 and today it is down to $102 (Not a Growth Company). \n\nPlease, share your knowledge/wisdom.",

Thus, will be adding this post here.\n\nI have started investing about approximately 1 month ago, and have picked out these stocks and crypto as long term positions. I would be listing out the main reasons on why I have purchased these stocks and crypto, and would like to get some opinions on my current portfolio.  \n50% Stocks  \n\\- Apple (AAPL) 8%  \nApple products are widely used, many loyalists to its product. Still has room for growth and do not see it dying anytime soon. Picked as tech blue chip.  \n\\- AMD 14%  \nBullish on semiconductors in the long term, picked both AMD and NVDA as forerunners in the industry. Picked for growth potential.  \n\\- Microsoft (MSFT) 3%  \nSimilar to AAPL, both companies are huge and have a large customer base, with further room for growth. Picked as second tech blue chip.  \n\\- Nvidia (NVDA) 5%  \nSimilar to AMD, hard to pick between both companies, and thus have chosen both. Picked for growth potential.  \n\\- SEA LTD (SE) 11%  \nSEA LTD has 3 subsidiaries, Shopee (e-Commerce), GArena (Gaming) and SEA Money (Digital Payment). A long term pick in which I believe has a chance of being a multi-bagger and that its growth potential has not peaked yet.  \n\\- Tesla (TSLA) 9%  \nFuturistic EV company, a favorite pick of certain investors. Similar reasoning to SE, with a certain amount of risk tied to it.  \n20% Cryptocurrency  \n\\- Ethereum (ETH) 16%  \n\\- Chainlink (LINK) 4%  \nPurchased mainly to gain some exposure to cryptocurrency. Currently viewed as a commodity, in which I believe ETH and LINK has high growth potentials to it.  \n30% Cash  \nCurrently untouched and waiting to be used to buy any potential dips or add positions in other sectors, as I am very exposed to tech-related movements. Will gain about 1% every month from salary, which can then be used to purchase more stocks.   \nCurrently red on SE, AAPL and MSFT as most of my positions are new and would be looking to average down on these depending on market conditions. Also looking to diversify out of tech with stocks such as Disney (DIS) and Thermo Fisher (TMO). Not adding more funds into crypto, as I feel 20% is already a high ratio.   \nOpinions for improvement are welcome.",

Checkout dividend aristocrats.\n\n2. The dividend yield%. If you\u2019re going for a higher yield, make sure the dividend is sustainible.\n\n3. Pay-out ratio. How much does the company give out in dividends? Again looking for the dividend\u2019s sustainability here. Lower pay-out ratios might also mean that the company is still investing their capital and growing. Examples: Apple, Microsoft, Visa and Nvidia.",

I will continue selling a contract here and there to play safe, but I have no intention of bailing when it hits $120.  I went through the same routine with NVDA a few years back and the only mistake was getting excited and grabbing profits too early.  I jump in and out of here for fun, but I am not a trader/speculator.  The stars are aligning for AMD and this one will grow long term.  Data center/gaming/consumer CPU demand through the ROOF and AMD is    eating INTC market share in CPU and slowly catching up to NVDA on GPU side.  LFG.",
