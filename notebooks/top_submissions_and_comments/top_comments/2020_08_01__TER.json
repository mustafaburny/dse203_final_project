As they bring these markets online and/or ramp their footprints, financial performance should be quite strong relative to peers.  I also like the Canopy relationship, and have noted their increasing preference to discuss Terrascend rather than Acreage.  It certainly feels like Terrascend is viewed as a winning investment by CGC.\n\nI finally opened a modest position in TRSSF earlier this week, right at the recent support level.  I have a couple of deeper limit buys set should support fail.  If pps holds and climbs from here, I don't feel the need to chase.  As one of the best positioned companies outside of the top tier, I'm happy to have a bit of exposure going into this phase of MSO growth.\n\nThat said, I'm channeling the lessons I learned during the LP bubble.  In particular, I'm committed to taking profit and closing out positions on mid-tier names when things get nuts.  Terrascend is not a long hold for me, barring some sort of major shift in strategy or success.  When the US cannacraze happens, I'm going to winnow my exposure down to a couple of core long positions in the best run companies at that time.  Even if TER is looking really good mid-bubble, I'm going to accept that for the win it is and move on with my gains.  I'm not going to ride over the top of another wave holding onto underdogs.\n\nFWIW, I think it's important to note that Terrascend is beholden to two major insiders (Canopy and JW Asset Management).  So much so that common shareholders are certainly an after thought.  Also, so much so that those insiders should be viewed skeptically as possible vultures looking to force a takeover in the end.  In other words, Terrascend may prove to be a good company that's not a great investment for the common shareholder.  It's important not to lose sight of that as a possibility.",
