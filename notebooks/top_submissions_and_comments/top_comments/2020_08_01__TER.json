Sell at open and possibly buy a longer dated call at higher strike.\n\nOn a side note, LULU, IMMU, and TER all look to be coiling to break out just like SQ just did.

Their TER are also as low as 0,07%. Of course, you will have currency issues, i.e. the value per share which is often denominated in EUR will vary depending on the exchange rate, but so would it be if you bought shares at a US-based broker. You can also see exchange rates as a virtue: Currently, for example, all US shares are on a 10% discount for Europeans, compared with a few months ago.\n\nJust look into EU-based products by, e.g., iShares (Blackrock), x-trackers (Deutsche), Vanguard, SPDR etc. pp.",
