INTC 10nm process has more transistor density than TSMC 5nm. This is because of INTC's super finfet technology. Power and performance will always be better for INTC. \n\n2- supply and demand.  Competitors are struggling to meet the demand on 7nm and 5nm as they have to rely on TSMC. INTC on other hand has in house FABs and can meet the excessive demand. Based on inventory shortages only,  INTC will go to $60+  before Jan 2021.\n\n3- history.  INTC has been there and done it. AMD was gonna eat INTC for lunch in 2000s, IBM in 1990s,  QCOM in 2010s and AAPL in 2020s. INTC is still here and will be relevant for decades to come. \n\n4- Autonomous driving:  MOBILEEYE, acquired  by INTC , has 10+ major auto makers signed up.  If you retarded morons think TSLA will be only relevant players in this technology,  you have no fucking idea.",

I still keep a few hundred dollars aside for fun penny stock plays, but the majority of my trading is with solid companies that get a consistent 10% - 100% gains per month\n\nFor instance, check out the last 6 months of PTON, or the last 3 months of FNGU, DFEN, KSS, QCOM, ERIC, TAN, and JETS.

During the crash, many online shopping companies, such as Pets.com, Webvan, and Boo.com, as well as several communication companies, such as Worldcom, NorthPoint Communications, and Global Crossing, failed and shut down. Some companies, such as Cisco, whose stock declined by 86%, Amazon.com, and Qualcomm, lost a large portion of their market capitalization but survived.  \n\n[About Me](https://np.reddit.com/user/wikipedia_text_bot/comments/jrn2mj/about_me/) - [Opt out](https://np.reddit.com/user/wikipedia_text_bot/comments/jrti43/opt_out_here/) - OP can reply !delete to delete - [Article of the day](https://np.reddit.com/comments/k9hx22)",

In addition, some of the better known ETFs out there are focused on AI coupled with robotics (e.g. ARKQ, BOTZ, IRBO, etc.).  I think that focus misses the mark because the future growth of AI is in helping to automate white collar jobs, IMO.  I don't think there's a great answer.\n\nTesla is the darling of the AI crowd right now. I get AI exposure via funds that are invested in the biggest players, such as Amazon, Google and Microsoft, as well as the manufacturers of deep learning chips; Xilinx, AMD, Qualcomm, NVidia and Intel.",

AMD I'm not sure.\n\nARM doesn't really make anything except license out instruction sets. Apple has an architectural license and they just have to support the ARM instructions but it gives them freedom to design the CPU as they see fit. Same with Qualcomm. Other licensees can only sell reference CPU designs with little changes.\n\nThe M1 is a great design but it's nothing that AMD and Intel can't do in the PC market on their own. AMD already does this for game consoles. they don't even need to go to ARM to get most of the M1's performance gains. the PS5 and Xbox Series X are perfect proof.",

But it came with increased heat, so that hamstrung them in the laptop market (sort of).\n\nThe modem integration doesn\u2019t really make sense because the baseband is its own little ARM package to begin with. There\u2019s just no advantage in what you describe from a performance standpoint. If it somehow shared memory or resources with the application processor, then you might see it, but it doesn\u2019t work that way. At least as of now, it doesn\u2019t.\n\nIt would also rule out using binned desktop processors in iPads, which will probably happen at some point just for cost reasons.\n\nCramming more stuff on to the same die isn\u2019t necessarily better, unless they are somehow sharing a high speed interconnect/otherwise using shared resources. This does not describe an LTE/5G modem.\n\nI am not saying this will never happen, but it doesn\u2019t \u201cneed to\u201d happen, and at least in terms of current hardware I don\u2019t see any advantage. Qualcomm\u2019s decision to do this in their X-series platforms is just as much a factor of giving OEM\u2019s a fully functioning design as it is for speed reasons (e.g. you\u2019re going to buy all your stuff from Qualcomm if it\u2019s all coming on the same piece of silicon). This isn\u2019t a problem for apple because they do all their own integration anyway.\n\nAlso, Qualcomms modems are just really good. And everyone uses them, so they are pretty standardized which is important in radio communications. Apple fought a big fat lawsuit to be able to use those modems. They clearly think they have merit.\n\nI\u2019d be interested to see if/how/why there would be power savings to having a modem on die... could be. If there is, maybe Apple will try it. But I\u2019m quite certain it wouldn\u2019t make radio connections faster.",

I have not invested much since as I am trying to build my savings again however I aim to start investing $400 - $500 per month into my brokerage account starting 2021. Now my issue is how do I allocate that money into my stocks and funds? I have high priced stocks like Tesla(641) and Twilio(309). While also having lower priced stocks like Cloudflare(81) and Pagerduty(40). Now which stocks and ETFs deserve deposits of new money? The ones that are winning or the ones that are losing? Or should I plan to reinvest into 1 to 2 companies per month? So that by the time a year completes every stock/etf has had their fair share of deposits.\n\nIf any additional information is needed, please let me know! Thanks again",
