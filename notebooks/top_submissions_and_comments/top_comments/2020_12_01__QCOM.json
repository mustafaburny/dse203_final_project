Apple has an architectural license and they just have to support the ARM instructions but it gives them freedom to design the CPU as they see fit. Same with Qualcomm. Other licensees can only sell reference CPU designs with little changes.\n\nThe M1 is a great design but it's nothing that AMD and Intel can't do in the PC market on their own. AMD already does this for game consoles. they don't even need to go to ARM to get most of the M1's performance gains. the PS5 and Xbox Series X are perfect proof.",
