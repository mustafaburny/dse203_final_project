My view on swing trading is you need either a positive or negative view on a stock, and depending on that view, you can only ever go long or short on it, but never flipping between long and short on the same stock.   So I'm not a technician whatsoever.\n\nBut to answer your question, obviously, you want stocks that will do at least \"ok\" during this odd period in history.   I wouldn't bet on the \"back to normal\" trade, personally, but whatever floats your boat.\n\nOn the long side....I like...\n\n\\-Citrix at $120-$125, or so\n\n\\-McDonalds at $150-$155, or so\n\nOn the short side....\n\n\\-Intuit, at it's current price ($285), seems wrong.\n\n\\-Hilton at mid/high $70s, is short material\n\n\\-Las Vegas Sands has no business being over $50. \n\n\\-I also don't like Sirius XM above $5.50.

Right now almost every single stock in the market is overpriced due to significantly decreased consumer demand.\n\nHowever, the economy isn't the market... until it is.  Fed injections of capital in the market are driving investors and private equity away from low safe returns (such as walmart) as they have been propping up companies whose debt ought to be forcing onerous terms from Private Equity and Banking or the consideration of bankruptcy.   The Fed is doing this to preserve a job market that some estimate could add another 20-50M unemployed if the S&amp;P500 in earnest began to reduce employees inline with lost revenue.  \n\nWithout these sorts of checks and balances in the market it is more than ever...  broken.   This does mean that many jobs out there shouldn't currently exist.  Further, the lack of Fed transparency and oversight has furthered this inability to make rational investments save one.\n\nCompanies will continue to explore mergers and acquisitions to shore up lost revenues and take advantage of EXTREMELY cheap capital.  We can expect to see more Grubhub/Uber investments.\n\nTLDR:  SMAR because they are primed for a buyout by ServiceNow, Google, Intuit, or Salesforce",

        "body": "Thanks for explaining your strategy in great detail. It is always fascinating to see other strategies. I think you\u2019ve gone above and beyond by offering to \u201cshow your statement\u201d at the end of the year. People can either believe you, or they can choose not to, and that\u2019s their choice.\n\nWhat I would like to point out are a couple of things:\n\n1- You\u2019re comparing an active trading strategy vs buy and holding an index. Indexes are fine for maintaining wealth. They are a passive strategy that people can use to get mediocre returns. People tend to enjoy \u201cguarantees\u201d and they like don\u2019t deal well with ambiguity. Passive Index investing has so much documented about it that people feel like this is the way to go. There\u2019s very little ambiguity their results. To that end, it is no surprise whatsoever that your strategy is surpassing index returns. \n\n2- When comparing your strategy with a properly constructed long portfolio, we can begin to see the differences. You said that you can do $500 per day with your strategy on less than $600k. How much are you putting at risk to get the $500? If we say that $500 per day is our baseline, then with roughly 240 trading days per year, we get to $120k. How many trades are required to achieve this result?\n\nIf we look at an active portfolio which returns a [20% YoY CAGR](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&amp;timePeriod=4&amp;startYear=1985&amp;firstMonth=1&amp;endYear=2020&amp;lastMonth=12&amp;calendarAligned=true&amp;includeYTD=false&amp;initialAmount=600000&amp;annualOperation=0&amp;annualAdjustment=100&amp;inflationAdjusted=true&amp;annualPercentage=0.0&amp;frequency=2&amp;rebalanceType=1&amp;absoluteDeviation=5.0&amp;relativeDeviation=25.0&amp;showYield=false&amp;reinvestDividends=true&amp;benchmark=VFINX&amp;portfolioNames=false&amp;portfolioName1=Portfolio+1&amp;portfolioName2=Portfolio+2&amp;portfolioName3=Portfolio+3&amp;symbol1=Wm&amp;allocation1_1=33&amp;symbol2=MSFT&amp;allocation2_1=34&amp;symbol3=INTU&amp;allocation3_1=33), we can begin to see the differences in strategy and returns. The active portfolio can scale with no trading required in order to achieve its results. It\u2019s beaten the SPY for 26 years and I\u2019ve posted about it before. I don\u2019t personally run the above portfolio, because I target even greater returns with similar risk profiles (typically 8-20 securities in aggregate). I use the above example just as one to get people thinking about quality portfolio construction. I would say that a 20% CAGR with smaller drawdowns than the S&amp;P is the bare minimum one should target with a properly constructed long portfolio. \n\nThe question in my mind then becomes, how well does your strategy scale?\n\nThis of course isn\u2019t to challenge you. I think your returns are acceptable for what you\u2019re doing. You are already ahead of many since you have a strategy for your trades. You\u2019re also eliminating risk by being in cash when appropriate vs letting things ride. \n\nThere are many different ways to invest. I\u2019m glad you posted as it gives folks something to think about. Thanks",

        "body": "I\u2019ve said it before, but it\u2019s worth reiterating: If you want to preserve your wealth, then index investing is the way to do it. If you want to grow your wealth, then you need to construct a high quality portfolio. \n\nWith the advent of fractional shares, you can now spread the risk of your dollars around to multiple quality names. You no longer need to buy penny pump and dump stocks to get a return. Also, no longer do you have to choose AMD or INTC. If you have $10 and decide that you want to reap the benefits of both, you can spread the risk evenly, by putting $5 into each. In this scenario, the odds of your $10 going to zero is highly unlikely. \n\nPortfolio construction is a skill that can be taught. I rely heavily on past data to inform me of what the possible outcomes of my portfolios will be. And yes, I have substantially beaten the index year over year, including this year where I am running over 50%, compared to -11% in the SPY (so I\u2019m beating the index by 61%)\n\nAll too often investing is thought of as a simple sequence. You have $100, which isn\u2019t enough to buy a share of NVDA, so instead you buy a different corporation and hope for similar returns. People also tend to think in terms of short-term gains. If they get a  10% return on a stock, they want to sell. While there\u2019s nothing wrong with selling at a gain, building a quality portfolio that you can invest in will be worth more to you in the long run. \n\nStock picking gets a bad name because people want to invest in one stock and hope for the best. A quality portfolio can survive even scenarios where one part of the investment fails.\n\nGenerally, I recommend that each portfolio which you construct contain at least 3 companies, and it should contain no more than 16 companies. \n\nHere\u2019s an [example](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&amp;timePeriod=4&amp;startYear=1985&amp;firstMonth=1&amp;endYear=2020&amp;lastMonth=12&amp;calendarAligned=true&amp;includeYTD=false&amp;initialAmount=10000&amp;annualOperation=0&amp;annualAdjustment=0&amp;inflationAdjusted=true&amp;annualPercentage=0.0&amp;frequency=4&amp;rebalanceType=1&amp;absoluteDeviation=5.0&amp;relativeDeviation=25.0&amp;showYield=false&amp;reinvestDividends=true&amp;benchmark=VFINX&amp;portfolioNames=false&amp;portfolioName1=Portfolio+1&amp;portfolioName2=Portfolio+2&amp;portfolioName3=Portfolio+3&amp;symbol1=WM&amp;allocation1_1=33&amp;symbol2=MSFT&amp;allocation2_1=34&amp;symbol3=INTU&amp;allocation3_1=33) , 33% INTU (intuit), 33% WM (waste management) and 34% MSFT.\n\nThe above combination has beaten the index for over 25 years and is beating the index this year too. When this combination goes down, the indexes go down further. When this combination goes up, the indexes don\u2019t go up as high. This is what I mean about quality portfolio construction. You can do this with other companies too and come up with your own combinations. \n\nCould this change? Absolutely. Just because something worked for 25 years doesn\u2019t guarantee that it will work for another 25. However, the idea is the same in that if you buy into a good portfolio, you can reap the benefits.\n\nAgain, I can just speak of my experiences here. My poorest performing investments is my 401k plan, where indexes are the only option. And although it performs poorly relative to building my own portfolio, there are tax incentives which drive me to fully fund it each year.\n\nGood luck to all. I believe that some of you will be able to take this knowledge about building a quality portfolio and go on to do great things.",
