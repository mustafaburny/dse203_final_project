I'm waiting on UMC to blast off and have been buying every time it dips more. What Im looking at is when Biden decides to try to ramp up semiconductor production in the USA to compete against China, who is going to get government grants and huge tax breaks? TXN? MU? AVGO? For the Automotive industry, who is the most important US company producing the specific semiconductors the car manufactures need?",

The moderators, the OG members, the high profile members (DFV), the new members who are as clueless as me, the new members who can only post emojis and have a vocab of five words, the bots, and even the hedge fund infiltrators... if there is such a thing.  \n\nThis is the ultimate game. Do your own research, listen to smart people, and get rid of any MSM opinions. You will do great.\n\nNo one cares, but my favorite game of all time is Drug Wars on my good ole TI-85 Texas Instruments calculator (fucking nerd). The basics of that game is the exact same as the stock market. Buy low, sell high, fuck the loan shark. Difference - you will lose real money, you might get arrested, and you could probably get mugged? \n\nI was always scared to jump in to the big leagues but after the first GME squeeze I decided why not throw fun money into stocks instead of busch light and other useless crap. So I started throwing money into stocks and busch light.\n\nJokes aside, I did quit drinking every night. Started working out. Got a damn haircut. Almost bought a bidet... but I'm an american who needs to see my waste on paper. I'm one line of stripper salt and a convertible Pontiac fiero away from doing this full time. Because of this great community.\n\nI've learned a lot over the last month or two. Not from the GME experts and emoji people, but from the OG's who have been to battle. GME will not last forever but that does not mean the money will dry up. Soak the useful info in. This is the difference between dying alone in your recliner while watching 'the office' reruns or dying at the ripe age of 85 in a horrific, power grid altering accident that involves your diamond encrusted lambo wrapped around a telephone pole. \n\nI fucking love you people. To Valhalla!\n\nTLDR: read first 6 paragraphs and then skip to the last line.",

Basically the most fabs have been out of game for advanced technology nodes. For example, TXN has some fabs, but they are old technology (still a descent market especially for analog chips). MU has fabs but mainly for memory (memory and logic CMOS are different in manufacting). There are also markets for power semiconductor, optical sensors and etc. For advanced SoC chips, only major players left right now are TSM and INTC. Samsung is still in the game and SMIC is trying to catch up. But basically TSM takes the majority of the market. \n\nDisclosure: I have been holding TSM for a couple of years. I personally prefer fab+fabless and I am a little bearish on US-based fab. But I am not an expert in the field.",
