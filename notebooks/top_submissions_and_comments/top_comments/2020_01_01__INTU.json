Of course, looking backward you can calculate it, or get a crude estimate of what it will be from some hand-waving, but you never know ahead of time what the realized volatility will end up being.\n\nI had assumed the OP was interested in estimating what a given option should be priced given some _estimate_ of the current volatility. The reason training a model that has realized volatility as an input is a bit dubious because you never _know_ the instantaneous volatility. If you can divinely intuit what it is then yeah it's just plug and chug with whatever model is most appropriate.",
