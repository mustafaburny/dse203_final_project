With time wave and tidal energy will become affordable and feasible, there is just too much energy potential for it not too happen. With Carnegie\u2019s 20 + years of experience working on trying to address the challenges you mentioned and hundreds of patents and intellectual property it could be well positioned to meet the need. The big if is if they find the right partner with deep pockets and engineering expertise to make it happen. HPE is a huge step in the right direction.",

        "body": "Look at numbers. California and these areas have seen a influx of people who make $200k plus. Starter homes in the Bay Area are easily a 1m+. High taxes? People with money gladly pay them in exchange for the quality of life CA provides. Also! Half a dozen \"tech\" companies have \"left\" CA -Oracle, Hewlett-Packard printing, and a few others... But the majority of those companies staff are staying in California... Signaling no exodus of business. People have been saying California is taxing people to death for 40 years... And somehow the quality of life continues to rise and people making good money continue to spend that money in CA. \n\nYou would think by selling a shack in California for 1.5 million and buying a very decent property with land and a nice house for half that in all these \"red\" states would make people think \"maybe our economy isn't as strong as CA?\"",
