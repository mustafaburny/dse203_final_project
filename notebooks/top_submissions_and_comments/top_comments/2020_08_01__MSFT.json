Oh you paid off your house? Save for your kid's six figure college fund. Oh all that's done?

        "body": "&gt;Google and FB are not allowed in China. Even services like Dropbox and Box don't work in China.\n\nThat's because the Chinese government has some crazy draconian laws that applies to *all* companies, foreign and domestic. FB/Google/Twitter decided they don't want to comply (for good reasons), but companies like Microsoft and Apple do. The CCP doesn't specifically target any American companies.\n\n&gt;We should reciprocate.\n\nShould we copy their Great Firewall as well and ban any apps that doesn't allow government backdoor for data access? Winnie the Pooh can unilaterally ban any site/app he doesn't like, and that's what makes their government terrible, do we really want our President to have *exactly* the same type of power?\n\nIf there are privacy/national security concerns, then legislate through Congress and punish all apps/software that doesn't abide by the law, be it Facebook or WeChat. \n\nHowever I feel extremely uncomfortable that \"national security concern\" is now just the magic keyword that gives the President unlimited power to do whatever he wants. What's next, banning CNN and MSNBC because the FBI \"uncovered\" some connection between the networks and some foreign government?\n\nFurthermore speaking from personal experience, WeChat is used by millions of Chinese Americans as a chat app, very often with friends/relatives back in China. It's very similar to Line and WhatsApp in that regard. Using this logic Trump can ban all phone calls or emails or texts to China because there is a risk of the CCP government monitoring on their side.",

One day I can buy a lambo, the next I cannot buy bread to feed my family.\n\nI wake up to my Amazon Alarm Clock\u2122\ufe0f. It\u2019s the future, so it\u2019s integrated with my sprinkler system for maximum efficiency or some shit. I have to recite the phase \u201cAll hail Jeff Amazon\u201d for it to turn off. I trip on my Purple mattress bedroom set but am unfazed after last nights draft kings app winnings. \n\nI go downstairs and turn on my Microsoft TV\u2122\ufe0f. I do so early so I can watch the required 2 hours of advertisements in order to watch 10 minutes of news. Weird, it\u2019s showing adverts for Grindr - I am not sure why that is, it must be broken\n\nThey come on and read the financial quotes. SPY is still around 330 and has been hovering there for over a decade now. Scientists have figured out how to harness this oscillation to create electricity and now 70% of the world\u2019s power is generated from it\n\nI blow my nose using a dollar bill from the box next to me. I teleport to work using my Zoom Teleporter\u2122\ufe0f. Today I am writing fake Google reviews about the Sony PlayStation 69 and the Microsoft Xbox 420. Should be a good day.\n\nI go home to my iTrailer \u2122\ufe0f  eat my BYND Food Patty \u2122\ufe0f  all is good. I chuckle at my neighbor crying outside after another day of waiting for his Nikola truck that he was scammed on. God bless America.\n\nFYI all WMT September calls are free money. this is the way. Fuck you bears",

I sold my $210 calls yesterday and today the stock dropped (one of the few times I got lucky) so I\u2019m going to just buy more shares and wait it out that way. When we got to $220-$225, I\u2019ll buy some weeklies @$230.",

        "body": "Low float is one of the most important thing about penny stocks. It is what allows runners to actually run when good news is released. Getting rid of all low float tickers is more censorship which everyone seems to whine about.\n\nSecondly, covid had a large effect on the user count. A lot of bored people at home decided to try to learn how to trade pennies, which gave us an influx of users. Then, as people became uninterested, many of them stopped checking the subreddit frequently but they are still subscribed to the subreddit. This would explain the decrease in users online.\n\nAlso, when you mention \u201cgambling\u201d, THE WHOLE STOCK MARKET IS A GAMBLE. Whether that be buying Apple or Microsoft or buying a low float penny, it is all gambling and speculation. That is the nature of the stock market. We are all civilized people, and if you\u2019re buying stocks based off of the # of upvotes and the # of posts, THAT IS YOUR PROBLEM. Mods can\u2019t make you buy/not buy stocks. That is your own decision.\n\nIf you lost money on a stock, TAKE RESPONSIBILITY. You bought the stock yourself, no one held you at gun point and forced you to buy it. Stop blaming the subreddit and mods for removing spam posts because you \u201cmissed out on a stock\u201d. Many of those posts end up being spam, and if the stock didn\u2019t do well, then the users would praise the mods for removing it. WE DONT KNOW WHICH STOCKS WILL GO UP. We remove all posts equally and do our best to keep bias out. If your post was removed, ask a moderator why it was removed and they will tell you how you can make your post a \u201cnon-spam\u201d post",
