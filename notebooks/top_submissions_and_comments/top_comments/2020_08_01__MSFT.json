Having debt is the only way to get yourself into more debt like a better house or car needing a credit score.\n\nOh, you paid off your student loans? Get a car. Oh you paid off your car? Buy a house. Oh you paid off your house? Save for your kid's six figure college fund. Oh all that's done? Hope you have enough left for retirement and enjoy your last 10 years of life, thanks for contributing to society with your 9-5 life.\n\nWe all need to hit it big. That's why we're here. Fuck those 2% savings accounts. Go for the millions. If you don't make it, it doesn't matter anyways because most of us will die working.

        "body": "&gt;Google and FB are not allowed in China. Even services like Dropbox and Box don't work in China.\n\nThat's because the Chinese government has some crazy draconian laws that applies to *all* companies, foreign and domestic. FB/Google/Twitter decided they don't want to comply (for good reasons), but companies like Microsoft and Apple do. The CCP doesn't specifically target any American companies.\n\n&gt;We should reciprocate.\n\nShould we copy their Great Firewall as well and ban any apps that doesn't allow government backdoor for data access? Winnie the Pooh can unilaterally ban any site/app he doesn't like, and that's what makes their government terrible, do we really want our President to have *exactly* the same type of power?\n\nIf there are privacy/national security concerns, then legislate through Congress and punish all apps/software that doesn't abide by the law, be it Facebook or WeChat. \n\nHowever I feel extremely uncomfortable that \"national security concern\" is now just the magic keyword that gives the President unlimited power to do whatever he wants. What's next, banning CNN and MSNBC because the FBI \"uncovered\" some connection between the networks and some foreign government?\n\nFurthermore speaking from personal experience, WeChat is used by millions of Chinese Americans as a chat app, very often with friends/relatives back in China. It's very similar to Line and WhatsApp in that regard. Using this logic Trump can ban all phone calls or emails or texts to China because there is a risk of the CCP government monitoring on their side.",

Trump, Microsoft is prepared to continue discussions to explore a purchase of TikTok in the United States.\nMicrosoft fully appreciates the importance of addressing the President\u2019s concerns. It is committed to acquiring TikTok subject to a complete security review and providing proper economic benefits to the United States, including the United States Treasury.\nMicrosoft will move quickly to pursue discussions with TikTok\u2019s parent company, ByteDance, in a matter of weeks, and in any event completing these discussions no later than September 15, 2020. During this process, Microsoft looks forward to continuing dialogue with the United States Government, including with the President.",

Getting rid of all low float tickers is more censorship which everyone seems to whine about.\n\nSecondly, covid had a large effect on the user count. A lot of bored people at home decided to try to learn how to trade pennies, which gave us an influx of users. Then, as people became uninterested, many of them stopped checking the subreddit frequently but they are still subscribed to the subreddit. This would explain the decrease in users online.\n\nAlso, when you mention \u201cgambling\u201d, THE WHOLE STOCK MARKET IS A GAMBLE. Whether that be buying Apple or Microsoft or buying a low float penny, it is all gambling and speculation. That is the nature of the stock market. We are all civilized people, and if you\u2019re buying stocks based off of the # of upvotes and the # of posts, THAT IS YOUR PROBLEM. Mods can\u2019t make you buy/not buy stocks. That is your own decision.\n\nIf you lost money on a stock, TAKE RESPONSIBILITY. You bought the stock yourself, no one held you at gun point and forced you to buy it. Stop blaming the subreddit and mods for removing spam posts because you \u201cmissed out on a stock\u201d. Many of those posts end up being spam, and if the stock didn\u2019t do well, then the users would praise the mods for removing it. WE DONT KNOW WHICH STOCKS WILL GO UP. We remove all posts equally and do our best to keep bias out. If your post was removed, ask a moderator why it was removed and they will tell you how you can make your post a \u201cnon-spam\u201d post",

        "body": "Options work just like stock, only x100.\n\nLet's look at buying first. You buy an option what you're really buying is control over 100 shares of the underlying stock. \n\nAn option has three parts, a type, an underlying, and a strike price. The type is call or put. Tje underlying is the stock symbol, and the strike price is the dollar value at which point an option is \"at the money\"\n\nHow do people make money? Because an option contract has value. Let me give a concrete example. I buy a put contract on MSFT. That means I'm buying the option to sell 100 shares of MSFT at the strike price. So if I buy a contract at $200 and MSFT drops to $195 I stand to make ~$500 (difference between the strike, and underlying *100 less fees) So that option contract will be worth slightly less than $500, so if I sell the contract I'll make the difference between my purchase and sale price. Or, if I excercise the option I can sell 100 shares of MSFT that I own at $200, regardless of the actual price. \n\nCalls are the same except it's the option to buy 100 shares at the strike price. So the contract gains money as the underlying price rises.\n\nMost people buy options expecting the underlying to move in their favor and they sell, collecting the difference in prices.\n\nOptions sellers sell options, collect the sale price and want the underlying to move against them so the contract expires and they can keep the sale price.",

Their technology is also simple; they make it easy to create online stores and handle payments.\n\nAnother example is Paycom. They provide a simple service to do payroll processing. Again they have stable growth being able to grow as a technology company, with revenue growth of 30%.\n\nChegg is another example. They provide a subscription based education service. This includes problem guides, practice problems, study material, math tools, etc. Their revenue growth is 28%.\n\nSo a good strategy might be to find easy to understand industries that can benefit from technology and there's plenty of those to be found!\n\n[Wix.com](https://Wix.com) makes it easy to make websites.\n\nSquare makes it easy for business owners to accept payments.
