        "body": "There\u2019s tons of competition this is an emerging space I would say where what this category of software is not fully defined and tons of people are converging in the same space from different directions.\n\nThe Problem?  In large businesses you have tons of data from different systems and lots of inefficiencies.  It is very hard to have a single source of truth and front line workers attempt to game most systems that measure them.\n\nThe Solution: I like the title Execution Management Systems (coined by Celonis), but no one yet agrees.   This emerging class of software attempts to combine data, analyze it, and allow you to automate and take action from one central system.  It also allows you to set different business priorities and based on those may recommend different actions.\n\nThe competitors:\n\nAnalytics tools:  You have Tableau, Domo.  Primarily built on reporting they need to extend into automation, and process mining and AI recommendation engines.  I\u2019d say they have a ways to go expect Tableau with Salesforce could have many of the pieces.\n\nData Warehouse Tools: Palantir is somewhere between this and analytics tool with an AI component already well developed.  These tools work to store and analyze data and also usually have some automation with the systems they interact with.  Snowflake is the big name here.\n\nERP/System of Records: These systems mostly approach the problem by trying to do all analytics , AI, automation, within their platform.  You\u2019ve got Salesforce, Workday, SAP and Oracle here.\n\nSystems of engagement: a set of tools that usually are a front end for other systems of record.  Notably ServiceNow trying to be a universal front end to business systems.\n\nProcess Miners:  Celonis is the big name and growing fast.  They approach the problem with unique tech that analyzes how processes flow through these systems.  I think process mining is a critical piece you need to execute the insights and automation and a lot of the players above don\u2019t have too much of that piece.  \n\nRPA:  UIPath and Automation Anywhere.  They started out just automating on the front end.  Now they\u2019re trying to add other components to be a universal execution engine.  \n\nMiddleware: Boomi but notably Salesforce Mulesoft.  They need to add analytics, AI and process mining to get to where this space is going.\n\nEveryone knows this Execution System/Universal Truth is where the future is at.  No one has every piece of that figured out.  But everyone sees while there will always be a place for a system of record (like an ERP/HCM and CRM tools) this new kind of software will be what guides those tools (the one tool to rule them all so to speak).  \n\nDespite what Palantir claims they aren\u2019t the universal leader but they are like a top 3 choice.  This space is crazy fragmented and no one even knows what to call it yet.",

Splunk has a market cap of 32B and snowflake is 90B. Snowflake is definitely big and a lot of companies are using it. I do think it's a bit overpriced to be honest, but I could be wrong. If PLTR actually does what it says it does, successfully, it should be worth more than snowflake, especially if it begins to partner with Azure, GCP, and AWS. The value of unstructured data integration and interpretation is huge, but I'd have to see exactly how they are doing it to be a good judge of character. I'm optimistic about all three companies for sure, based on their use-cases.  Splunk has good competition which makes it less valuable in my eyes, like data dog. The world of data integration is a tougher problem to solve, which cloud providers have addressed, but still limited due to their inability to put tons of resources into just that problem. Companies like oracle and SAP do this, but they are clunkier/lagacy (however SAP is EVERYWHERE) Hadoop tools do this, but with a lot of manual work. I'm definitely keeping my eye on PLTR (and holding) to see if they live up to their promises because the upside can be huge. with a market cap of 50B, I could see it doubling if they are very good at what they claim to do.",

        "body": "Somewhat of a long reply below. In the likelihood I get banned or downvoted, I don't care. I'm speaking my mind here because I made some damn good coffee and why not?\n\nBeing able to directly transfer value to another party using only an address and no company or third party is pretty wild. You can create an address and receive the value in a few minutes (sometimes a few seconds) without any accounts, companies, or logins 24/7 365. The wallet that you use is not even where the value is stored, it's just a key to access the value on the network. It took me a few years for all of that to click and was like, \"Huh, that is actually pretty cool to just transact without anything getting in the way\". This is in contrast to having a bank account, which you don't even have ownership of. I, like many others, had banks suddenly close all of my accounts and there's no appeal. Your crypto private key is a proof of ownership and there's usually not any ToS or rules about using the network directly. You will, however, run into some random bs when you start dealing with the companies and centralized exchanges. I think this is where some users get sour as it's not really what crypto's tech is about...they are just another company/middle-man that can take away or make changes anytime they want.\n\nAnyway, this concept has been helpful for my small company to negotiate deals with parties outside of the US and provide remittance without fiat foreign currency exchanges. The banks tend to have pretty unfavorable forex rates, which cut into the margins and took 3-5 days to send. The transaction cost itself is a few pennies. The main cost is the taker fee from buying on the exchange, but it's still cheaper and faster than a bank wire by far. From there, the other party and I just agree to a fixed crypto amount and they will have their value settled in a few minutes. We do everything by the book and pay our taxes on any short/long gains using online crypto tax software that uses APIs to get the yearly data from the major exchanges to spit out the 8879 docs.\n\nI'm in the camp that people should use the cryptocurrency and do stuff with and to learn more about it. Buying even a few dollars worth kind of has the effect of nudging you to learn more. We're all human so sure some will not give a damn and just look at it as a number that changes, but that might not always be the case as the applications and usage continues to increase. The incentive to use your crypto to earn income is a pretty nice incentive to at least check things out more.\n\nA few years ago, I was playing a crypto random dice game that had a 1% house edge, which from my limited understanding of gambling is pretty good. You set your bet amount and risk threshold then 'roll the dice'. The result is a random number between 1 and 99 (I don't remember the exact values) This interaction with the smart contract gives out a result from a random number generator oracle and you either win or lose. For example, you can bet that the dice will roll a number under 80. So if the result is 79 or under, you win. The winning amount is more if you choose to roll under a lower number, which has a lower probability. You can keep playing and change your risk tolerance and have a little more fun. The kicker is that there is a token this game uses that facilitate fractional control of the game's profits. Every few weeks, those who had ownership of the tokens can claim their share of the house profits as income by just pressing a button. Some weeks the house lost money, which means those users averaged a profit. It's all pretty cool. This sort of goes into the territory decentralized organizations (or DAOs) and even decentralized governance, which is used today for voting mechanisms and changes.\n\nI'm not an expert mind you (fucking far from it), but the innovation is mainly happening with Ethereum and other platforms that take that frictionless transfer of value and apply more logic to it. For example, Polkadot or Tezos allows you to stake with a few clicks and earn a passive income at a rate that is somewhere between 6-10% APY (assuming the value at least holds and you're realizing the gains in regular intervals). \n\nScalability for hundreds of thousands of transactions per second is possible in the next couple of years with Ethereum 2.0. We get things like decentralized loans, exchanges, non-fungible tokens/assets, programmatic contracts, yield farming, etc. The returns on the DEFI products can be pretty high. I've heard over 30% APY. However, there is always some risk with the early adoption of tech but that hasn't stopped the billions of dollars from pouring into these contracts over the years.\n\nI'm looking for the future where we don't need to use password managers or have accounts with every-single-fucking-website and have a private identity that will allow you to buy things for autonomous delivery but the companies wouldn't be able to get your data compromised in a hack or sold/tracked to/with third parties. BTC was the beginning, it's limited for sure, but it's not going to be the end. But yeah, fuck Libra and fuck anything Facebook touches. The last thing we need is a huge centralized corporation controlling our money and what we choose to do with it. I would rather use a decentralized stable coin like DAI that is governed somewhat democratically.",

        "body": "APXT DD:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAPXT has reached a deal to merge with AvePoint, the largest Microsoft 365 Data Management Solutions Provider. The company is being valued at $2 billion and will trade under AVPT.\n\nAPXT has a huge client base already, at an estimated 7 million members. 25% of the Fortune 500 uses Avepoint.\n\n'AvePoint\u2019s 7 million customers represent a 3% share of Microsoft\u2019s 250 million 365 users. AvePoint believes it can get to 10% share and Microsoft will hit 500 million users in the future, good for 50 million AvePoint future customers.'\n\nAddressable market: $33 billion by 2022. \n\nThe company ALREADY HAS REVENUE (unlike other SPACs), which is expected to total $148 million by the end of this year. A large % of this is recurring revenue as well, with 78% of revenues in 2020 estimated to be recurring. Expected revenue CAGR of 30% to 2022. \n\n**5-time winner of Microsoft Partner of the Year award.**\n\nManagement: 'Apex is led by former Oracle CFO Jeff Epstein and former Goldman Sachs Head of Technology Investment Banking Brad Koenig'. These are huge, knowledgeable players. They can turn this company into a goliath, especially with the extra capital from a SPAC. \n\nBig name backers: Sixth Street Partners, Goldman Sachs, \n\nBig advisors on the deal, including Goldman Sachs, Evercore and Citigroup.\n\nThis seems similar to the other data related plays we've had this year \\*cough\\* PLTR \\*cough\\*. Not the same type, but definitely in a growth market with strong margins. Also allows you to diversify away from EVs a bit.\n\nThe SPAC hasn't run yet, currently trading at $10.75 per share, so this has a lot of room to run. Very little downside, but huge potential upside. \n\nSources:\n\n[https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201123005590/en/AvePoint-the-Largest-Microsoft-365-Data-Management-Solutions-Provider-Announces-2bn-Merger](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201123005590/en/AvePoint-the-Largest-Microsoft-365-Data-Management-Solutions-Provider-Announces-2bn-Merger)\n\n[https://www.avepoint.com/](https://www.avepoint.com/)\n\n[https://www.marketwatch.com/story/microsoft-cloud-partner-avepoint-going-public-via-merger-with-blank-check-company-apex-technology-2020-11-23](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/microsoft-cloud-partner-avepoint-going-public-via-merger-with-blank-check-company-apex-technology-2020-11-23)\n\n[https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/avepoint-public-via-spac-valued-160729256.html](https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/avepoint-public-via-spac-valued-160729256.html)\n\n[https://www.benzinga.com/m-a/20/11/18489999/microsoft-cloud-provider-avepoint-going-public-via-apex-technology-spac](https://www.benzinga.com/m-a/20/11/18489999/microsoft-cloud-provider-avepoint-going-public-via-apex-technology-spac)\n\nDisclaimer: I have APXT shares and this does not constitute financial advice.",

I just don't see people in this space paying for a proprietary solution for data integration.\n\nNow the silver lining may be that they have friends at the top that'll push it on users.  This does happen.  But it won't come from the engineers.\n\nOpen source tech like Kubernetes/Elastic/Python are all big in this space.  Palantir isn't and us tech leans toward open source not closed platforms.\n\nAnyhow this is all entertaining for me.  Just don't be left holding the bag.",

        "body": "Amazon won\u2019t be literally wiped out. The mistake is assuming stock returns will remain positive as long as the company continues to do well. \n\nI use this example all the time. Qualcomm is THE wireless chip designer. If you\u2019re using a piece of tech that has wireless capability, there\u2019s a very good chance it uses QCOM tech. Obviously wireless has exploded over the last 20 years, mostly with smart phones, but pretty much everything... TV, consoles, microwaves. \n\nQualcomm was perfectly positioned for the 21st century. They make money on every piece of hardware sold that uses their chips. \n\nTheir revenues were $2-3bn in the late 90s. With the advent of the smart phone, revenues jumped to &gt; $10bn by 2008. \n\nIf you knew wireless was going to explode in the 2000s, QCOM was as sure a bet as anything. I mean, *smart phones!* \n\nExcept if you bought QCOM in 2000, ignoring dividends, you made your money back... this July, 2020. Qualcomm predictably did very well with the rise of smart phones. Their stock? Trash. \n\nThe point is that markets are far from one dimensional, and overly simple narratives display a clear lack of understanding of market psychology, market flows, how and when valuations matter (they don\u2019t, until they do), etc. \n\nBubbles are a hell of a thing, because they can destroy the stocks of good companies for years or even decades. \n\nAmazon? IDK. But I see MSFT at 11x price/sales and I\u2019m reminded of one of the all time greatest stock quotes, ever:  \n\n&gt; At 10 times revenues, to give you a 10-year payback, I have to pay you 100% of revenues for 10 straight years in dividends. That assumes I can get that by my shareholders. That assumes I have zero cost of goods sold, which is very hard for a computer company. That assumes zero expenses, which is really hard with 39,000 employees. That assumes I pay no taxes, which is very hard. And that assumes you pay no taxes on your dividends, which is kind of illegal. And that assumes with zero R&amp;D for the next 10 years, I can maintain the current revenue run rate. Now, having done that, would any of you like to buy my stock at $64? Do you realize how ridiculous those basic assumptions are? You don\u2019t need any transparency. You don\u2019t need any footnotes. What were you thinking?\n\n- Scott McNealy, CEO of Sun Microsystems. \n\nThe last thing I will say is *a lot* of high flyers this year have charts that display the hallmarks of a bubble; exponential ascension with no regard for long term fundamentals, big drop, claw back some of the losses from the initial drop for a few weeks/months, before the steady decline hits and before you know it, the stock is stealthily down 40% despite no major catalysts or changes to the company.",

If you wait until the news cycle starts reminding us, then you've already missed a bigger bounce than you can reasonably expect from this year's biggest tech winners over the next few weeks.",
