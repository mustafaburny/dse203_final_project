        "body": "How about to copy just some your favorite investors? Maybe not blindly, but pick some moves based on their portfolio changes? I bought MU because of Mohnish Pabrai. Even Mohnish by himself encouraging others to copy famous investors. I would like to add that I personally would not buy everything what Mohnish bought, like SRG for example, I just don\u2019t like their business. I think problem with your proposed idea of automatic buying/selling stocks is that sometimes it might not work well. First of all 13f arrives with several months delay and this will impact you a lot. For example that famous GOLD buy from Buffett and everybody was exited and maybe even somebody bought it but then in next quarter he sold almost half of it. So if you follow blindly then this seems not really profitable move for you, because you receive data with delay. Another move from last Buffett\u2019s 13f - he sold a very small stake in Apple, again very strange move and I do not think that this should be copied, just because we do not understand nature of it. Maybe he was doing some kind of rebalancing or whatever, but my point is you can use 13f like starting point and then adjust it a bit and I believe this will give you a better result. And again I think you need to do a bit research on your side too, otherwise I think this might be a bit of costly. On other hand you can just buy Berkshire Hathaway, if you really want this to be super easy and without any efforts from your side.",

You'll find many investors like Peter Thiel and Michael Burry were the children of engineers frustrated by the narrow focus and lack of big picture of their parents and decided to go into finance instead.\n\nEngineers are extremely specialized and think their narrow domain is all that mattered. When I was discussing with my dad's friend who was a senior engineer at Apple 10 years ago and he asked me what was the most important driver for Apple going forward and was shocked when I said new product lines and sales in China. He was convinced that the tiny bit of firmware tweak he was working on the 4G antenna was the key to apple sales.\n\nMy dad also worked at Marvell for a number of years especially with the lawsuit from Carniege Mellon and panic sold his shares when I told him it was a buying opportunity as the lawsuit would be delayed and the fine would be spread out and disputed over a decade. He then worked for Micron as a director and panic sold his shares based on Samsung capacity and ignored the thesis I outlined to him from David Einhorn and that Samsung was going to rationalize the memory sector much like what happened with hard drives. But he was convinced there was going to be another Chinese player just like in the previous cycles with Taiwan, Skorea and Japan and dumping.\n\nTrust me, engineers are some of the worst investors in the world from my experience.",

Where did they think those people were going? Cause they definitely went to go work for someone else! \n\nIf I had to guess I think Intel is still in this mindset where they're competing against IBM and HP like they were in the 1990s and they could firmly make the argument \"where else are you going to go?\" a lot easier.  The company had basically been killing it since the Core 2 Duo rolled out and I don't know that management has really wrapped their head around the idea that there's a new emerging class of competitors out there with deep pockets and big ambitions.  They've been just shrugging their shoulders about losing market share to AMD too, and while I do think it's kind of inevitable until they get their next node working, longer term I don't think that's the biggest threat really.  NVIDIA acquiring ARM, Apple making their M1, Microsoft potentially doing something similar and even Amazon focusing increasingly on workload specific ASICs.  Apple fired a big shot across the bow with the M1 here not because it's necessarily the most amazing piece of silicon on earth but because it represents a move towards that in house fabless model and another big push towards heterogeneous SoC architectures that are increasingly less CPU dominated.  Discrete CPUs aren't going away in the data center space for sure but overall percentage of cost and value they're going to be able to extract going forward is likely to remain under pressure.",

Had Intel's plans worked out, they'd look smart because of all the money saved on not buying next gen ASML machines, but it didn't.  \n\nThe only Intel should really be considering is trying to buy up space on TSMC 5nm while they get their own in house fabs in order.  It's expensive, but Intel still has more money than AMD and if Intel swoops in and buys up whatever 5nm capacity that Apple doesn't buy, they'd ensure AMD sees this growth capped due to supply shortages.",

I use 2-5% of my portfolio to be in options. I\u2019ve been riding MAD,NVDA, and MU up for the last few years in stocks in order to give myself some room for options. If my options expire or I lose them I wait until I can save up more from my next few, but I don\u2019t do weeklies, and always sell my options a week before they expire so no matter what I don\u2019t lose something useless. \n\nCurrent positions:\n\nHella MU calls for 01/2021 and 06/2021\nSome F calls for 6/2021\nCRM calls for 03/2021\n\nStocks:\nQCOM,MU,AMD,NVDA\n\nnew adds: GME (\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80),PLTR,MT\n\nTotal portfolio under 80k but started at 20k so I\u2019m OK with that return after 6 years.\n\n\nedit: yes I work in software, no I\u2019m not in sales",

If the Kanye effect has any impact on stock price, this could be a huge buying opportunity! Kanye took Adidas stock from $45 in 2013 to its current price at $162.  Home Depot is a solid value company with steady consistent growth in stock price.  Not to mention collecting a nice dividend while holding.  HD has been consolidating and looks prime for a breakout to retest/break all time highs.  great buying opportunity as it dips to $260's.  Opendoor (IPOB) is an excellent growth opportunity to 2-5x your investment.  Backed by  billionaire investor Chamath Palihapitiya, this company has strong management/leadership with great experience.  It is a great buy in the low 19's or under $18.  watch the full analysis with charts and technical analysis here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zs5xQd5tXJo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zs5xQd5tXJo)",

The call OI around 370 concerns me a bit, selling pressure might increase due to profit taking at those levels and VIX dying won't allow SPY to moon as hard as before. \n\nMy strategy is simple and it's been good so far. I just buy $1-2 OTM 45+ DTE and sell for $350-400 profits and buy a share of SPY with it. It's boring but I wanna get to the point I can sell premiums on it once I collect 100 shares. I accumulated 100 shares of AMD that way, now I use those AMD premiums to day trade 0DTE SPY on expiry days cause it's really predictable due to the price getting pinned at the max pain. I just scalp trade calls when the price dips below the max pain and I watch it shoot up in a V shape like clockwork lol. And I have no money at risk. You could probably bank hard on those 400C if it works but the risk might not be worth giving your hard earned money to theta gang. How much you planning to buy?",

If it explodes in your face, you wait until next payday. If it's a bottle rocket - you send 75% of those profits off to pasture (i.e. lock it up in a retirement account). The other 25% is a bonus bet you get to make, instead of having to wait for another paycheck.\n\nYou want to be playing with underlyings that are just stupid, volatile and wild. Super high IV when it's not earnings time. The ones that just make no sense, and they're swinging up and down violently every day. The more drama, the better. If you were betting on a horse, you don't want the big stud horse that everyone is betting on because the payout sucks.
