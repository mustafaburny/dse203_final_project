It\u2019s fucked up but most of the time you\u2019ll see larger retail allocations on shitty deals that will get pushed to that retail channel bc the \u201csmart money\u201d wont take it. Keep in mind when a PM (portfolio manager) at fidelity or T. Rowe price call an investment bank they are the ones placing these huge orders for shares basically allowing the deal to price. These are the buyers that keep the lights on and have huge amounts of capital to buy these deals...so banks will usually help them stay away from soft equity deals\n\nThe reason that these don\u2019t happen at market is because with such a large chunk of equity being sold into the market, this has potential to push price way down and so the buyer (hedge funds, pension funds, and to some extend the bookrunner(s) retail channels) will need to be compensated for that risk with a large discount %",

Even Interactive Brokers, among the best at handling expats et al, requires you to be a Canadian resident to open an IB Canada account.\n\nIf you just want to hold a CAD balance and trade CAD-denominated securities, many US brokers can support that. Interactive Brokers is probably best since they offer low-cost trading on Canadian exchanges and by far the cheapest currently conversions you\u2019ll find anywhere (0.2 bps on top of the interbank rate). You can easily wire your CAD savings from a Canadian bank to IB in the US. Assuming you plan to return to Canada at some point, they\u2019ve got a process to transfer your holdings from an IB US account to an IB Canada account if you\u2019re moving.\n\nFidelity, TD Ameritrade, and (I believe) Schwab also offer multi-currency accounts with access to Canadian exchanges. But even after the latest trading commission price war their Canadian trading commissions are high.\n\nWord of warning (but you probably already know this as a US citizen in Canada): don\u2019t invest in any mutual funds or ETFs domiciled in Canada (or anywhere outside the US) outside an RRSP, 401(k), or IRA.

        "body": "Okay. What I would personally recommend is looking at your $30k and asking yourself how much if it you will need in the next 4 years for your living/school situation. Most likely that will be a large portion of the $30k. For the parts that you want to keep in cash, but aren't using on a regular basis, stick it into a savings account with the highest rate you can find (CapitalOne usually does pretty good with this). An alternative would be a CD, but that prevents you from having instant access to the cash unless you break the terms of the CD, which forfeits portions of your yield. I may be more conservative than most, but I would probably only take $1-$2k of your money to invest. Think \"how much of this money would I be okay with never seeing again?\"\n\nIn specific terms, open an online account with either Fidelity, TD Ameritrade, or another low cost broker. Both Fidelity and TD have no commission trades now, I have accounts with both and would probably give Fidelity the edge but the difference won't be huge. Next step is choose what kind of account you want. I'm pretty sure your taxation rules are the same for the USVI, but you might want to double-check before choosing the account type. I think a Roth IRA would be best for you since contributions are post-tax (your current tax rate is likely pretty low), and ALL gains in this account can be realized tax free once you are 59.5 years old. The only catch is you cannot withdraw money outside of contributions before then without incurring tax/penalties.\n\nNext step is choosing what to invest in. You'll get a hundred different answers from a hundred different people, but I would recommend looking at a company's financial statements and cash flow. Do they make money? How much debt do they have on their balance sheet? Do they pay a dividend? If so, what percent of their total earnings goes towards paying their dividend? What do you think the industry is like? Is it highly competitive? Is technology changing it like cars destroying the horse-drawn carriage industry? There is no easy answer here.  \n\n\nShort and quick, I am apprehensive of current stock valuations but there are still some deals out there. I like GE or KHC (if you want a big company that had trouble, but has good upward potential). Exxon Mobil (XOM), Johnson &amp; Johnson, and Procter and Gamble are all considered blue chip dividend stocks if you want more security. BGS is another one if you want to chase dividend yields, but I would caution you on this because their debtload could be an issue. In full disclosure I own some GE, KHC, XOM, and BGS, but would be happy to discuss others with you too.\n\nSorry for the book. Skepticmal's advice is probably where you should focus most of your time and money at this stage, so keep learning and good luck!",

I ask because Fidelity has different target date funds, some of which are much more expensive.\n\n2) What funds are available in your 401k plan? Can you purchase iShares ETFs? Or is the fund selection pretty small?\n\nI ask these things because while factor investing is pretty cool and technically more theoretically optimal when implemented properly, it\u2019s hard to beat the behavioral benefits of automatically DCA-ing into a dead simple one fund portfolio that automatically rebalances for you.\n\nIf you\u2019re really dying to get some flexibility though, then I think your plan of contributing up to the 401k match then maxing your Roth IRA (do Roth if you can) is good.

Combined we make right around $200k a year. We have about $95k in retirement accounts and about $10k in savings. We want to continue to grow our retirement savings, and still be able to travel.\n\nWe\u2019re not against taking risks and playing the long game. Thought our single largest Rollover IRA has been fairly flat for the last 10 years (currently at $52k). It\u2019s in a managed account with a financial advisory firm and in a fidelity account. The fees are $628 per month. I believe the fees are destroying my gains. It looks like the fund choices are producing, but the bottom line has felt flat (slightly upwards over the last 10 years). \n\nOut of that $95k, $18k is in a separate Fidelity account in a S&amp;P 500 fund/product. And we have  5 shares of Amazon (totaling about $10k now) and a few shares of Visa &amp; MasterCard (totaling $2.5k). \n\nOur home is valued at about $360k and we have about $250k left on the mortgage. Out two vehicles were both PreOwned, but not inexpensive and we owe about $20k on the 2016 Mini Cooper and $33k on the 2013 Porsche Cayenne. We have about $20k credit card debit we\u2019ve been grinding down the CC debt over time. From as high as $45k or so, to $20k). \n\nMy wife is very good with money. I am not. We money becomes an issue, I tend to look for a different employer. (My job is in pretty high demand and I have a good bit of experience).  \n\nThe two other upcoming expenses we foresee will be buying a preowned Airstream travel trailer and replacing our floors in our home. Other than that, it will be retirement savings. \n\nAny advice would be welcome.",

This is your first and foremost, put the money away, let Fidelity or whoever do their jobs, don\u2019t touch it.  Monitor it, ask questions, maybe make some changes WITH your financial advisor.

I'd also personally prefer these 2 since they offer more than Vanguard: 24/7 customer service, checking or cash management accounts with ATM fee refunds (Vanguard closed the closest thing they had over the summer, and even then, it was much more limited than Fidelity or Schwab's offerings), and both offer optional credit cards if you wish. For stocks and ETFs, Fidelity is in the process of rolling out fractional shares over the next few weeks, Schwab has announced it but has not started a rollout yet (I believe I heard spring?).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou should open a high yield savings account in addition to everything else, possibly except if you go with Fidelity or Schwab and use their CMA or checking accounts (since you can invest money there in money market funds which should return similar to a HYSA, but you do give up FDIC or NCUA insurance by doing this).",

(e.g. I have a good bit of Fidelity\u2019s 2055 Index FDEWX). I ask because Fidelity has different target date funds, some of which are much more expensive.\n\n2) What funds are available in your 401k plan? Can you purchase iShares ETFs? Or is the fund selection pretty small?\n\nI ask these things because while factor investing is pretty cool and technically more theoretically optimal when implemented properly, it\u2019s hard to beat the behavioral benefits of automatically DCA-ing into a dead simple one fund portfolio that automatically rebalances for you.\n\nIf you\u2019re really dying to get some flexibility though, then I think your plan of contributing up to the 401k match then maxing your Roth IRA (do Roth if you can) is good. But I would put leftover money after this back into the 401k and max it before looking at a taxable account. Utilize those tax advantages accounts as much as you can!",

Combined we make right around $200k a year. We have about $95k in retirement accounts and about $10k in savings. We want to continue to grow our retirement savings, and still be able to travel.\n\nWe\u2019re not against taking risks and playing the long game. Thought our single largest Rollover IRA has been fairly flat for the last 10 years (currently at $52k). It\u2019s in a managed account with a financial advisory firm and in a fidelity account. The fees are $628 per month. I believe the fees are destroying my gains. It looks like the fund choices are producing, but the bottom line has felt flat (slightly upwards over the last 10 years). \n\nOut of that $95k, $18k is in a separate Fidelity account in a S&amp;P 500 fund/product. And we have  5 shares of Amazon (totaling about $10k now) and a few shares of Visa &amp; MasterCard (totaling $2.5k). \n\nOur home is valued at about $360k and we have about $250k left on the mortgage. Out two vehicles were both PreOwned, but not inexpensive and we owe about $20k on the 2016 Mini Cooper and $33k on the 2013 Porsche Cayenne. We have about $20k credit card debit we\u2019ve been grinding down the CC debt over time. From as high as $45k or so, to $20k). \n\nMy wife is very good with money. I am not. We money becomes an issue, I tend to look for a different employer. (My job is in pretty high demand and I have a good bit of experience).  \n\nThe two other upcoming expenses we foresee will be buying a preowned Airstream travel trailer and replacing our floors in our home. Other than that, it will be retirement savings. \n\nAny advice would be welcome.",

Combined we make right around $200k a year. We have about $95k in retirement accounts and about $10k in savings. We want to continue to grow our retirement savings, and still be able to travel.\n\nWe\u2019re not against taking risks and playing the long game. Thought our single largest Rollover IRA has been fairly flat for the last 10 years (currently at $52k). It\u2019s in a managed account with a financial advisory firm and in a fidelity account. The fees are $628 per month. I believe the fees are destroying my gains. It looks like the fund choices are producing, but the bottom line has felt flat (slightly upwards over the last 10 years). \n\nOut of that $95k, $18k is in a separate Fidelity account in a S&amp;P 500 fund/product. And we have  5 shares of Amazon (totaling about $10k now) and a few shares of Visa &amp; MasterCard (totaling $2.5k). \n\nOur home is valued at about $360k and we have about $250k left on the mortgage. Out two vehicles were both PreOwned, but not inexpensive and we owe about $20k on the 2016 Mini Cooper and $33k on the 2013 Porsche Cayenne. We have about $20k credit card debit we\u2019ve been grinding down the CC debt over time. From as high as $45k or so, to $20k). \n\nMy wife is very good with money. I am not. We money becomes an issue, I tend to look for a different employer. (My job is in pretty high demand and I have a good bit of experience).  \n\nThe two other upcoming expenses we foresee will be buying a preowned Airstream travel trailer and replacing our floors in our home. Other than that, it will be retirement savings. \n\nAny advice would be welcome.",

This is your first and foremost, put the money away, let Fidelity or whoever do their jobs, don\u2019t touch it.  Monitor it, ask questions, maybe make some changes WITH your financial advisor.  Other than that, leave it alone. \n\n2.  Want to be like OP and never trade again, cuz you suck at it?

Not touching 1 or 2 whatsoever, day trade with separate funds that you\u2019re ok with losing.

Sell the shit that is cluttering up your life.  Anytime you think about buying some new shiny thing, ask yourself these two questions:  1. How have I gotten along without this in the past?  2. Why do I need it now?\n\nPut a sign on your bedroom wall that says \"Look around... All of this stuff used to be Money\"  You won't buy half the stuff you currently think you need.  \n\nNow that you have your money going into your pocket instead of toward some meaningless stuff, learn how to read and interpret a balance sheet and income statement.  Next, fund an account with whatever you can afford.  Start small and buy shares in companies that you understand.  What is their business model?  How do they make money?  For example, Hewlett Packard will give away the printer to sell you the ink.  Gillette (before being bought out) gave away the razor to sell you the blades.  Apple used to be a gadget maker and they banked on the product replacement cycle (you gotta buy the new model because it does so much extra for you and is better)....  PKG sells packaging...  Timken sells bearings...  Do you know anything about those businesses?  If not, then don't buy it.  Buy the companies that you know and understand how they work and how they make money.  If they pay a dividend, great.  At least you get paid to wait.  \n\nThe alternative is to YOLO your paycheck into binary option plays that might not payoff.  Think about this....  A stock will move one of three ways - up, down, or sideways.  If you buy a call option, the only way you can win is if the stock moves up.  You can lose if the stock moves down or sideways.  So you lose in 2 out of 3 scenarios, win in only 1 of the 3 scenarios.   You don't have to be an expert in Black-Scholes option pricing methodologies or even understand all the Greeks (delta, gamma, vega, theta, etc).  \n\nGood luck.  We've all been where you are, and it's hard to see these other people have so much success when you're hardly making ends meet.  You'll get there....  But it takes time.",

Here are my big lessons on the market. \n\n1) Earnings are wayyyy too risky to hold through. Do not hold through earnings. Buy 1-2 weeks out when IV is still low, watch that shit swing up right before the bell on ER day. Sell \\*minutes\\* before 4pm. \n\n2) If a company drops after ER, and if they only missed ER by a little bit, then buy that fucking dip and watch it rip in the coming days/weeks. \n\n3) Do not buy PTON or ROKU. They will fuck your life up. \n\n4) Play the big names, AMZN, GOOGL, MSFT, V. \n\n5) Red days usually mean green days are around the corner. Load up on red days, sell on green days. \n\n6) Do not buy PTON or ROKU. \n\n7) Do not play biomedical. See EPZM, AIMT. \n\n8) Listen to the old heads here, they have a lot of game. \n\n9) Trust your gut. \n\n10) SELL INTO STRENGTH.",

        "body": "&gt; Also, a 100% index fund into the S&amp;P 500 proves to work out just  fine and shouldnt be looked down upon as a great way to make money for  your retirement. \n\nSo just some comments and I have been drinking whiskey to bear with me.\n\nAn advantage of a 60/40 Stock to Long term bond portfolio is historically it has slightly less returns than 100% stock but is much less volitional\n\nusing [https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-asset-class-allocation#analysisResults)\n\nIf you started with 10k and made 1k annual contribution starting from 1972  \n\na 60/40 would give you a  CAGR of  13.29% \n\na 100 stock would give you a CAGR of  13.67% (not adjusted for inflation)  so in this test the 60/40 ends with a balance of 1.9 million vs 2.2 million . \n\nThat is not a astronomical difference however the big advantage of a 60/40 portfolio, worse year -15% vs -42%\n\nMax draw down 28% vs 50%\n\nIt helps people stay invested, having lived through 2008 I saw smart , financially knowledgeable people do the thing we all tell ourselfs we won't do, panic sell and get out of the market.\n\nBeing down 15% in a year is easier to stomach than being down over 50%. A 60/40 portfolio helps you stay invested and not panic sell , with out hurting returns all that much",

Couldn't believe the gains posts I was seeing and felt compelled to start learning to trade options. \n\nSpent months reading and slowly losing a couple hundred here and there on cheap FD's and other shit contracts on weak stocks with no liquidity. Started making smarter plays until I gained some confidence and hit on a few earnings plays in a row. Been hooked ever since. Still here and still net positive.\n\nTo the recent slew of noobs...spend a few minutes on google and answer your own retarded ass questions. I get it if you just wanna yolo some lunch money on TSLA, but god damn. Do yourselves a favor and do your own DD if you plan on staying in the game.\n\nThis sub introduced me to something I always needed. A way out. A legitimate chance at financial freedom and an escape from the monotonous routine of the daily rat race. \n\nGet rich or expire worthless!!!\n\nCheers boys!",
