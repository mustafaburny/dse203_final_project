Although...It\u2019ll usually be more like 70/30 institutional to retail or 80/20 especially with a popular momentum stock like $TSLA. It\u2019s fucked up but most of the time you\u2019ll see larger retail allocations on shitty deals that will get pushed to that retail channel bc the \u201csmart money\u201d wont take it. Keep in mind when a PM (portfolio manager) at fidelity or T. Rowe price call an investment bank they are the ones placing these huge orders for shares basically allowing the deal to price. These are the buyers that keep the lights on and have huge amounts of capital to buy these deals...so banks will usually help them stay away from soft equity deals\n\nThe reason that these don\u2019t happen at market is because with such a large chunk of equity being sold into the market, this has potential to push price way down and so the buyer (hedge funds, pension funds, and to some extend the bookrunner(s) retail channels) will need to be compensated for that risk with a large discount %",

There's no need to buy and hold in a roth, you can flip if you decide you want a different alloc or manager later, since no taxes. The vanguard fund has ok expense, .15%, the fidelity however is .75% and is a low performer on top of that and not just because it has diversification via commodities - definitely dump the fidelity one. You can replicate it's effects with either the cheaper vanguard fund, or by buying an even cheaper product. Fidelity has a zero cost stock funds you could replicate with easily - to replicate it more or less exactly with cheaper fidelity products, you'd just do 54% FZROX, 39% FZILX, 7% agg (etf). If you don't have this on fidelity, you'd replace FZROX and FZILX with just straight up ACWI or VT. Technically those are a bit less diversified because they lack commodities, but I don't love throwing commodities into a roth. I also don't love the AGG for what it's worth, but that replicates the design. \n\nI would try to consolidate your retirement accounts into ones you manage at the same place. DO NOT roll into 401k, you lose control and often end up with higher fees.\n\nThe other comment I would make is you should just save more if you want to retire faster/better.\n\nGood luck.",
