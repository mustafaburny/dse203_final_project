The rent moratorium is one point that makes the bearish case stronger that I forgot to mention also. \n\nDon't quote me on this, but the ADP report is adjusted for seasonal changes vs the BLS one is not, plus kids with summer jobs are headed back to school. \n\nDaily COVID cases doubled in August vs July, I think that'll be a theme if my prediction is correct.",

        "body": "So I'm actually going to do some market analysis on the direction of the market, and I'd like thoughts and a discussion if possible. Think Socratic discussion. \n\nIn the U.S. I think that the markets are going to soon start a rotation to value, and you can sort of see it starting to occur as bond yields have started to rise, meaning that growth stocks will start to become less attractive relative to value stocks. You've been seeing supply chain and logistics companies like Matson, Maersk, Zim, and other assorted shipping stocks boom during this time period. Commodities stocks in the aluminum sector are poised to outperform, because Guyana just had a coup, and it's a huge exporter of aluminum... Especially to China. With that said, steel and iron ore are the same with exports to China from Australia of iron ore outperforming despite negative relations between these two nations. Both of these types of stocks have outperformed year-to-date, and will continue to do so for the next month or two as forward looking investors look at commentary stating that supply chain, and commodity prices will be elevated well into next week. Finally, home builders have outperformed, and are poised to continue their outperformance due to a massive shortage of homes that will take years to a decade to fix.\n\nI believe in the latter months, in 2022, and heading into 2023 financials will outperform as yields for the 10 year T note rise. First, domestic debit and credit card transaction volume will rise (which bank CEO's , and Visa's CEO, have noted has already started to happen), and this will be followed by international travel spend (Which is very lucrative). This will primarily help Visa, and Mastercard as they have been essentially flat year to date and on a yearly basis. It will also help American Express, and Discover Financial to a lesser extent. Then, credit card balances will grow and forward looking investors will start looking at interest rate hikes by the FED in late 2022-2023, which is the one-two punch that bank stocks will need to see outsize profitability. The strong M&amp;A activity, even in the face of anti-trust scrutiny, is also helping banks. Third, ADP and other benefit provider/payroll companies will do well as payrolls continue to increase, and unemployment continues to go down. The runway is still clear there. Then, there are the mortgage companies where there currently has been a pricing war which should cool sometime in early 2022, allowing for Gain on Sale margins to normalize to roughly 115-185BPS, while the value of their Mortgage servicing rights should increase alongside the yield for the 10YR T notes. Open banking should continue its outperformance, with strong markets in Asia, the Middle East, Europe, and Latin and South America, and growing adoption in North America. Companies like Paysafe, PAG, Razer, etcetera should do well in this environment. Finally, the moratorium on school loan payments should cease very soon allowing companies like Navient and Sofi to regain momentum.\n\nI also believe that airlines will start to outperform starting in Q1-Q2 2022, as flight restrictions start falling away, and business travel starts to resume at a more normal tempo. Personally, Delta Airlines and the budget airlines are my preferred ones. Then, there are homebuilders who will continue their outperformance as they have significantly deleveraged and still have long runways for price to earnings growth. I'd expect dividend increases in the latter half of 2022 to reflect this. Third is General Electric under Larry Culp, who's turnaround efforts haven't recently been noticed, but who's conducted strong execution. From their wind turbines, to their jet engines, to their medical division, there is strong growth to be had and I believe we'll see a spurt in the share price to reflect the reality of 2022 and Culp's momentous turn around. I also believe chip fabricators (and chip designers) will outperform. TSM has been relatively flat in the last 3 months, save for a one week burst of over 5% to reflect the fact that they're increasing prices across the board from 10 to 20%. Intel, meanwhile, is building a chip fabrication plant in Ireland which will be entirely dedicated to vehicle chip manufacturing, which I think will be a success. Finally, I believe the used car (autonation), and new car companies such as Ford and GM as well as Volkswagen will outperform in 2022 due to the scarcity of vehicles, compounded by Hurricane Ida's destruction of numerous vehicles (And the risk that other natural disasters destroy even more vehicles).\n\nThe China rally, meanwhile, is unsustainable in the light of the regulatory tempo on the free market principle that China ever so briefly embraced. In light of all these actions, it is my firm belief that  China is, or will, embrace capitalism \"with chinese characteristics.\" The crackdowns are far from over, and I believe the state will go further in the realm of entertainment and video streaming, such as suspending screen time for minors on video streaming platforms (something they already do) to a level consistent to where they've placed video gaming limits to combat the myopia epidemic as well as fan culture. They are also likely to crackdown on drinking establishments, and liquor companies to crack down on the excessive drinking in China, in an attempt to stave off chronic health conditions that could accrue, as well as crack down on companies trying to profiteer off a rapidly aging China. These are just a few sectors where I see potential intervention, but there are likely others. The fact that systematic debt has reached such dizzying levels in China is also worrying, and presents a structural issue. A house of cards, if you will. The fact that JD bought an insignificant sum of shares, means that there is a rally in tech stock shares today is foolish, especially since it's broad based and not tailored means there's no solid shoring. Furthermore, the debt to equity levels for some companies, such as Iqiyi, Evergrande, and other stocks is extremely worrying.\n\nI believe emerging market stocks in Brazil, Mexico, India, the Middle East, and Turkey present better opportunities.",

        "body": "\"people that really have no business speculating on stocks\"\n\nFor far too long investing in the stock market has been the domain of the wealthy elite. The premise for this is predicated by capitalism, of course. The ordinary folk are expected to spend every penny they earn or can borrow so that the companies the wealthy are invested in can rake in massive profits. \n\nThe tide is slowly turning, and more and more people, particularly the younger folk, have begun to learn the ropes of investing. And are happy to do it by themselves using low cost funds rather than through an intermediary (aka financial advisor) and high cost mutual funds. If you visited Fidelity Canada's website just 10 years ago you would have noticed that it was pitched toward investment advisors - and how they can help their clients. Not so any more - and it's the same with other companies like Vanguard as well. \n\nThe new investors stepped into the market in March last year because they had learned to recognize value. Stocks, in spite of the risks of Covid, were ridiculously cheap. They stepped in and set the floor on a market that traders would have happily shorted until it went even lower. \n\nSo yes, the shoe shine boys are now becoming savvy investors. What would be interesting to see is how such a democratization of investing would impact corporate bottom lines in 15 - 20 years. After all, Zeus help us all if the people who are supposed to borrow and spend suddenly start saving and investing.",

Fidelity has a introductory article on the subject which is helpful as well. *: A keyword you might want to look up is \"holding period\". Selling contracts on stock affects the holding periods.    \n  \nThe two big things I'd note is that:   \n1. Collecting premium is a taxable event.   \n2. Selling \"unqualified\" options contracts can create taxable events as well. Generally, selling in the money covered calls is effectively selling the stock (since it's likely to be executed) so the IRS treats it as selling the stock. This means that the capital gains rate is whatever it would be for the stock the day you open the contract. \n  \nThe devil is in the details of course, but essentially, be aware that selling in the money calls on stock you've owned less than a year is likely to be taxed as short term capital gains. \n  \nOut of the money contracts and stock you've held longer than a year pretty much avoids these issues though.",

This is good!  give yourself a pat on the back.\n\nI didn't note any mention of an emergency fund.  This should be cash that can be used to cover your living expenses fully for 3-6 months if something really goes wrong.  if you don't have that, start prioritizing cash flow to build that up.\n\nAnd yes, maximize your retirement benefit plans.  On the 403b, make sure you are getting the maximum match.  I can't tell for sure from the way you have described it, but if you are missing any % on the match, that is free money that you should prioritize getting (some employers match the first x% of your salary... if that is 10% in this case you should increase your contribution to 10%).  On a cash flow basis if you have to pick between getting the maximum match in 403b over maxing out Roth IRA, get the 403b match first, then try to max the Roth.  Prioritize those two goals above money you put into taxable investing.\n\nIMO, Fidelity was the right choice of the two providers you mentioned, as you can build a wider relationship with them over time and they have a lot of other financial options.  Set up your brokerage account with them if you haven't already.  You did mention VTSAX so maybe you already have a set up with Vanguard.\n\nregarding funds: at your age capital appreciation is the best goal.  keep it simple and manageable.  I would pick the Fid 500 as large cap is the right strategy at this stage of the bull market and at your age and investment horizon.  The other fund is target age fund (typically a fund that holds other Fidelity funds and changes allocation over time along with your expected retirement age).  This will be better during a down market for sure than the other, but I don't see one of those for a while.  So pay attention and plan to change allocation when a bear market comes along.\n\nKeeping it simple makes things easier to manage, while you grow your understanding of investing.  Best wishes!",

This means you are short this call your counterparty can exercise the call which forces you to sell this counterparty 100 shares (per call) at the designated strike price.\n\nWhat it sounds like you are describing is Covered Calls and Naked Calls. Covered simply means you already own 100 shares, so you sell what you already own. Naked means when assigned you have to go onto the open market, buy 100 shares at the current price, and sell them to your counterparty at the strike price.\n\nWhat this means functionally is if you are not covered you are subject to theoretically infinite loss because there is no ceiling to what price a stock could get to.\n\nA basic example: You sell a call at a strike of 10 but do not own the stock. If the option is exercised and the stock price is 100? You must go out and buy 100 shares at 100/sh and sell them at 10/sh, incurring a loss of 90/sh.\n\nBeing \"Covered\" is represented differently on different brokers. I use Fidelity and they also do not explicitly say whether my covered calls are covered or not.\n\nAnother notable difference is you should not be able to open naked calls if you are not approved for the proper level of options (level 4). Same with covered calls but they require a looser level (level 1).\n\nedit: [Here's](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/032615/what-difference-between-covered-call-and-regular-call.asp#:~:text=An%20investor%20in%20a%20naked,generates%20income%20for%20the%20investor) a good source that probably describes this better :)",

        "body": "&gt; Would it be a correct statement that if my overall portfolio consistently shows higher gains than the S&amp;P and/or VTI, then I\u2019m \u201cbeating the market\u201d? . . . And, conversely, if my portfolio consistently has lower gains than those indexes, I\u2019m better off just putting everything into the index instead?\n\nNo, because of the point you recognized with your next example:\n\n&gt;A more specific example: let\u2019s say (hypothetically) my portfolio is like 70% tech stocks, should I be comparing my performance to QQQ? It makes sense in my mind, just want to make sure my logic is correct.\n\nThat is probably a closer analogue, yes. \n\nThe reason QQQ is the better benchmark (and why beating the S&amp;P with such a profile wouldn't necessarily be \"beating the market\") is you've bought a riskier portfolio, so *should* see greater returns as a result. \"Beating the market\" tends to be discussed in terms of *risk-adjusted* returns. \n\nIf you have a portfolio that is much riskier than the S&amp;P and outperform it by 1%, you haven't \"beaten\" the S&amp;P, you haven't generated any [alpha](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/alpha.asp) as an investor, you've just added risk. As with your QQQ example, if you just want that added risk, you could just buy QQQ instead of S&amp;P to get that added risk without your stockpicking.\n\n&gt;I use Fidelity, and the performance page says (I think) that my personal return over the last 3 months is 36% higher than the return of S&amp;P, but I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m reading it right or if that metric is useful at all.\n\nThe other thing to remember is that short-term overperformance is no guarantee of *long-term* overperformance. Looking to the 2017 year-end SPIVA \"scorecard\", roughly 40% of US fund managers [managed to beat their benchmark index over one year](https://www.aei.org/carpe-diem/more-evidence-that-its-very-hard-to-beat-the-market-over-time-95-of-financial-professionals-cant-do-it/) (after fees). Heck, a *majority* of mid- and small-cap fund managers did. But, over the *long* haul (3, 5, 10, 15 years) that edge quickly vanished, and the vast majority underperformed their benchmark index.",

I look at FinTechs more so as partners with V/MA and not competitors. Unless one of these companies wanted to start their own payment network directly. \n\nBNPL (like Affirm) could take some of the credit card business but I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if some companies could start letting you even make installment payments via CC instead of direct ACH. I\u2019m sure people even use their debit cards, which are V/MA branded\n\nMy biggest concern is more regulation around payment networks and potential allowance of smaller networks to gain a piece of the pie. I read an article the other day how Australia may mandate low-cost debit card system for payments, which would allow banks to potentially utilize cheaper payment networks as opposed to V/MA (which are more expensive). I\u2019m still not overly concerned with this yet to make me back off my stance that both V/MA are great long term holds, but something to watch. \n\nOnce international travel comes back some post COVID, V/MA will shoot up as this is their bread and butter.

        "body": "Generally not.  Visa and MasterCard don't sell to or deal with cardholders.  Their customers are vendors (store merchants) and franchisees.  The franchisees pay for the privilege of operating a visa franchise.  The franchisee (like your local savings and loan, or chase or capital one, etc) uses the visa name and network, but they own the loan.  That's the whole business.  Hometown Bank Ltd pays Visa so they can have a Hometown Visa card, and they hope that all the cardholder debt earns them profit that exceeds what they have to pay Visa.  \n\nSo in the BNPL model, the debt is structured differently.  The hope is to make money on the \"pay later\" aspect, with fees or charges or interest.  It's sort of competitive to Visa/MasterCard's way of lending.",

        "body": "First of emergency funds are called are not suppose to have risk associated with it that's why they are emergency funds. But if insist on protecting the money against inflation then you are looking at the wrong asset class. You should be looking at bonds which have a safer risk specifically TIPS(treasury inflation protected securities). \n\nIf you are unfamiliar with bonds here is a quick break down. Bonds pay coupon payments a percentage of the par or principle value of the bond. E.g a bond sells for 1000$ and has a coupon rate of 3%. You get 30$ every year until the maturity of the bond. They are usually semi-annual so you get paid 15 every 6 months.  Yield to maturity is the estimated yield you would get if the bond is held to maturity. At maturity you collect the face value of the bond. Say you held the bond had a maturity of 2 years then you get your 1000 back plus 60 from your coupon payments.\n\nBonds have 2 major components of risk principal and interest risk. This can get complicated but all you need to know is if interest rates go up bond price go down and vice verse.(if you want me to explain I can, just let me know) There are ma y different types of bonds and not all have the same risk.\n\nHow does TIPS solve your problem? \nWell as the name suggest TIPS moves with inflation. If inflation rises by 3%. Then the principle value increases by 3% as well as your coupon payments. If there deflation the principle value decrease as well as coupon payments. E.g from the previous example your bond will be worth 1030$ and coupon payments would be 30.9$ annually.",

If you buy a put spread, the vol collapse and the spread having to go fully ITM to realize a full gain has more variables at work.

That\u2019s a 55% upside - earnings are expected to double next year. Also, Li Lu and Mohnish Pabrai have 50% of their clients assets in it - nearly $1B for Li Lu. Every other value investor you can think of has a meaningful stake in it; David Tepper, Guy Spier, Seth Klarman, Stan Druckenmiller, the list goes on.

Big takeaway from the last 8k Form was his \u201cCorbett Clause\u201d. This company has so much potential. OTC stocks need P/R in order to survive. No volume almost guarantees the stock will regress negatively. That\u2019s been the case since April. $IPSI has invested in a P/R according to one of their early 4-K Form so hopefully that comes into fruition. He put his daughter on IPSI chair board as a high ranking member. The kiosks deployment has been delayed but the blame is due mostly to covid. One thing I can see Corbett did well is eliminate all the toxic debt. I\u2019m just worried he runs this stock up and dips. $IPSI has the potential to be the next PayPal and having William Corbett at the helm has raised more questions than answers in the shareholders eyes. Not to mention spelling mistakes on the website. This company is very early which is a good thing, they just need to clean up their errors",

        "body": "Less bad then you might think. Most people fundamentally misunderstand what caused the supply crunch thus fundamentally misunderstand who is adversely affected.\n\nCovid didn't suddenly cause a massive spike in demand in order to precipitate a crunch. There was some demand increase in consumer electronics sector as more people purchased equipement to work from home but this is rather minimal and mostly focused on products that people didn't already have and are using lower end semiconductor processes, think webcams, mice, keyboards. Take a look at LOGI to see how this side of the demand increase played out.\n\nNow, so what -actually- caused the supply crunch? Well actually it was automakers and other traditional industries that forecasted a massive decrease in demand cancelling or scaling back their supply contracts. This caused foundries to either spin down for retool or sell capacity to someone else. Both are having a significant impact on auto chips right now which are mostly produced on the less advanced 32nm+ node processes.\n\nThe latter is why this affects TSLA less (though they are ultimately still affected which I will address later). They went ahead and purchased the depressed capacity, similarly AAPL/GOOG/QCOM/MRVL all took advantage of this to buy up capacity and lock in cheaper rates for the next couple of years while autos and industrial companies were panicking about a sustained economic recession.\n\nHowever this still ultimately does affect TSLA (and NIO, LI, etc that took similar approaches) in that purchasing capacity during the dip doesn't protect you from increased requirements going forward due to growth. So while they aren't needing to cut production like traditional autos that stupidly cancelled their contracts they aren't able to grow capacity because the same companies that cancelled are now willing to buy capacity at a premium and are buying everything they can.\n\nThis has some big follow-on effects for the semi-conductor industry though, especially combined with developments over the last few years w.r.t geopolitics. Firstly all the big foundries (INTC/TSM/Samsung) are building out new fabs now. These take 2-3 years to online but once they do come online we are going to see a massive supply glut which will drastically lower the prices of NAND, consumer electronics chips etc and free up the older fabs for the next gen of auto/industrial chips which will slowly upgrade from 32nm+.\n\nThe boom/bust, crunch/glut cycle is nothing new for semi-conductors but there has just been a perfect storm of factors to make this particular cycle very noticable for the first time of people outside of consumer electronics.",
