I believe cyber security will be a big winner in the years to come, but I can\u2019t justify buying at these prices. I follow CRWD, OKTA, ZS, and NET. Like I said though everyone has my same idea and these companies are highly over valued IMO. For nearly all of 2021 I\u2019ve been deep into oil and steel stocks since I thought they were super under valued. I am completely out of steel now because this clown market only cares about tech at the moment. I have way more companies I follow, but most are small caps around 1-3B that I view as undervalued that show growth potential and that doesn\u2019t fit your criteria.",
