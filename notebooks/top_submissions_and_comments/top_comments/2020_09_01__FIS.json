        "body": "\"Due to those losses, I stopped investing for a couple of months exactly when the prices were at minimum of the year.\"\n\nI think a broad issue with this sub that I've seen over the years is that people buy when things are good (eventually - this happens after a couple of months of half a dozen \"WHY IS THE MARKET GOING UP?\" threads every day), but when the market has a correction - something that used to be viewed as normal - it's viewed as almost apocalyptic. I saw a post the other day about Amazon being down 10% as a \"massive decline\" - if you cannot tolerate a 10% decline in Amazon don't own it, because there are times where that's the initial reaction to earnings. If a 10% decline throws your view of owning a company into question, then your thesis on why you bought it in the first place probably wasn't that strong. If something goes down 10% and you look at it in your portfolio and if your first instinct is to dump it, then that tells you exactly how strong you really feel about the company.  Growth stock investing is not going to be trees grow to the moon or years like this where Ark funds are up 70% or whatever they were; there's going to be periods that are highly volatile and far more volatile than the last month - look at growth names at the end of 2018.  This year with growth is not normal; it's a situation where things came together that benefited a lot of growth companies tremendously.\n\n1) I think people have to view a March when the VIX is 80 and the CNN Fear and Greed is 2 and yadda yadda as the time to really lean in. That's the time when if you have an even somewhat longer-term view you're getting opportunities. By the time this sub has warmed up to the market is not the time to lean in.\n\n2) People have to have a longer-term view and not this \"one foot out the door\" mentality where every bit of market volatility and events that might cause volatility is something to flee from. There's been way more threads in the last year where people talk about \"selling everything\" - not a decision that should be easy and a decision you should make very, very rarely - if ever. Volatility creates opportunities, you just have to think in months and years with purchases, not \"OMG WHAT IS THE MARKET GONNA DO TOMORROW?\"  \n\n\" I want to know how can I feel less sad about this.\"\n\nIt's a bummer and I'm sorry that you're dismayed at what happened but you're going to miss opportunities. Everyone does. I owned VFF when it was around $1 and sold not long before it went to $6 and then eventually the high teens. There's plenty of other instances over the years. I think what I'm looking for in terms of individual names has become specific enough that there are things that do well where I know I wouldn't have bought it any way, but with that it's not being bummed as much as trying to understand why it did well and any takeaways - could I have looked at it differently? Etc. If I missed something there's always going to be a bit of dismay, but I've gradually tried to be far more automated about it - is there is a lesson/takeaway from this? y/n? then move on.\n\nThere is going to be a lot of \"could haves\" throughout your time in investing. The issue I think becomes that was before and today is a new day - literally. Chasing now after what you could have done is not always going to be the best idea - have to look at it with a fresh perspective and consider what is the best long-term strategy to build on right now.\n\n\"When I backtested my ETF purchase across my deposit intervals, I found that I could have made 37.9% in returns\"\n\nCould have. I wouldn't base decision making on what things have done, the question becomes what is the potential going forward for the next 3-5 years. I look at my portfolio all the time with the thought of - if I was stuck with this portfolio tomorrow and couldn't sell it for 5 years, would I be okay with that? If something is a no, then changes need to be made. Things are bought with the intent of owning long-term and bought with the view of potential over the coming years. I have no idea what the market will do tomorrow or next week.\n\n\"When I want to invest smaller amounts of money, I have to rely on fractional shares and my brokerage doesn't provide that, so I have to shift to Robinhood or other trading platform.\"\n\nIf you want fractional shares, I'd much rather suggest Fidelity than RH. I don't see the appeal of RH at this point.\n\n\"AAPL 20%, MSFT 15%, AMZN 15%, \"\n\nSo half your portfolio is the household names everyone already knows, likes and probably owns. These are not bad companies and I think they will continue to do well in the future, but I also do think that it's at a point where people have to devote more if they're going to be in tech to finding growth beyond FANG names.",

        "body": "\"But at some point valuations might be over-stretched, future growth priced in and no greater fool showing up to pass the hot potato.\"\n\nThe issue with this is that I've read \"DOT COM!\" \"BUBBLE!\" on here for 5 years. There have absolutely been major rotations out of tech at times over the last 5 years but if you regarded those as confirmation of your bias that everything is a bubble rather than as a buying opportunity then you've missed out. Buying what \"appeared cheap\" and/or was \"impacted\" earlier this year when markets were cratering has not turned out nearly as well as buying what this sub has continually complained about as being \"too expensive.\"\n\nWill that change? Quite possibly.  When? Nobody on here has any idea. But the issue I think becomes sort of like the people who said for the last 10 years that \"value has gotta make a comeback, right?\" Just because something is cheap does not mean it can't get cheaper, just because something seems expensive does not mean it cannot get moreso. Just because something has underperformed for 5 years does not mean that it can't continue to underperform for another 5.  Without a very distinct catalyst in mind, incessant top calling (and you've seen it on this sub for years) is often an error.  Without a catalyst in mind, calling something cheap can often wind up waiting while watching what's working continue to do so. This sub has talked up big oil this year a lot because of being impacted (this, after big oil names have largely disappointed for 5+ years before this) and when BP literally came out and predicted that \"oil demand growth may have peaked\" and a lot of the responses on here were basically: \"well, what do they know?\" Buffett sold airlines: \"well, what does he know?\"\n\nThere is an eagerness to dismiss tech and growth and embrace what is viewed as cheap but when what is viewed as cheap isn't working, people keep trying to will the trade into working. There was a great interview with Fidelity Contrafund manager Will Danoff the other day and I liked this particular part:\n\n\"So, I'd say it's a very healthy give-and-take and dialogue. And I would say, often because Joel and I and all the other fund managers started as Fidelity research analysts, when a new analyst arrives, they usually show up at my office with a list, and say \u201cI'm the new railroad analyst. Here are my names, and I like XYZ railroad because the group's trading at 14 times earnings, and this ones trading at 11 times earnings.\u201d And I might say, \u201cWow, that's interesting. Why is that one trading at such a discount to the group?\u201d *And the analysts might say, \u201cWell, they just lost their largest customer\u201d or \u201cthey've got a big business into Mexico and Mexico's into a recession,\u201d or \u201cTrump wants to build a wall and therefore the Mexican business is falling off a cliff.\u201d And I usually say, \u201cThat's not the type of company I'm interested in*. **I'm interested in companies that are doing well, where the earnings outlook is positive, where earnings per share is growing. Maybe it's growing faster than people think. What do you have on your list that would fit that bill even if it's more expensive than the average company in your group?\u201d** So, it's that's sort of give-and-take. And I might encourage an analyst to reorient their priority list to help me look for stocks that fit my ideal pattern.\" I think this sub is often looking for the impacted, but maybe - just maybe - consider more the Danoff perspective. (https://www.morningstar.com/podcasts/the-long-view/40)\n\nAs for tech, there are things that are absolutely ahead (or well ahead) of themselves, but I wouldn't paint everything in tech with one broad brush or would I be a tech fund either (tech and healthcare are about 65%ish of my portfolio, with the latter making up a large chunk of that.) There's a lot of innovation going on beyond tech. \n\nIf you think that tech is overheated, that doesn't mean that looking into what's been the most impacted is the correct answer, either. What's somewhere in the middle? Something that isn't \"hot\", but also hasn't been obliterated and where you can make a good fundamental case (not just \"it's down a lot!\") for the company in the coming years?",

I think actual compelling value ideas are difficult and few-and-far-between. There is this perception that everything that is big and known and down a lot is a compelling value when much of these are not and/or are value traps. Somewhat related, I really agree with this discussion by Fidelity Contrafund manager Will Danoff: https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EiEOiBRWoAQaPdZ?format=jpg&amp;name=medium on focusing on what is doing well.\n\n2. You have a time period where the new economy names are the focus and there has been significant growth pulled forward. I don't think that this current crisis \"changes everything\", but it has pulled forward growth in the winners and there are themes and behaviors that I think will carry forward for years after this is over. While many on here still seem to disagree with this, there have clearly been winners throughout this that have benefited, some significantly.\n\n3. The problem with that is that you basically have a crowding (this year it's been a stampede) into new economy names and people ignoring old economy names (and that does play to Train's discussion in that 2018 article: \"\u201cIn 2018 it looks as though working out which companies are advantaged and which challenged by digital disruption may deliver better returns than establishing what is currently \u2018cheap\u2019 or \u2018dear\u2019 or whether macro-economic trends favour \u2018cyclical value\u2019 or \u2018quality growth\u2019,\u201d he said.\") A funny bit but I think this is very true this year - \"even when the market is in \"rotation\" mode, you can feel that moment intraday when people are like wtf am I doing, give me a hit of that sweet sweet digital transformation (https://twitter.com/modestproposal1/status/1293211807709003776) The problem with that is that you now have a lot of people focused on/crowding into one part of the market and it gets ahead of itself (and some niches way ahead of themselves.) There's no gradual cool off of what's done well, the rotations are total \"escalator up\" for months followed by these \"elevator down\" movements.\n\n4.  There will probably be a more sustained rotation if there was a real solution to this crisis, but even then I think my question becomes how \"sticky\" are people in various \"value\" sectors. A rotation out of the winners into losers doesn't fix the pre-existing issues of poorly run retailers but I think people confuse price increase with the idea that everything is a-okay now. I think a lot of impacted sectors are going to be to some degree impacted even after this is over. So I think ultimately the rotation out of winners into losers is more an opportunity to buy the winners and with the losers, you have to be selective.  I've talked up medical devices (SYK) as a sector given the procedure delays, but those are well off the lows. People just think everything impacted by this is a value and is going to be okay again after, I just don't feel that way - especially if this takes another year to before it's really solved.\n\n5. It's pretty telling that for all the outperformance of growth over the last decade that even in the midst of a pandemic, value still underperformed in the decline in March and then proceeded to spectacularly outperform post March low.  I do think that value will make a comeback, but it will probably be brief and I think people are going to have to be selective.",

NVDA -1.20% for more than $40 billion, according to people familiar with the matter, the latest in a series of big asset sales by the Japanese technology conglomerate.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe cash-and-stock deal being discussed would value Arm in the low $40 billions, the people said. The terms under discussion would mark a big win for SoftBank, which bought Arm four years ago for $32 billion and had struggled to jump-start growth in the business.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nArm and Nvidia have been in exclusive talks for several weeks and a deal could be sealed early next week, the people said \u2014 assuming it isn\u2019t derailed at the last minute.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nArm designs microprocessors that power most of the world\u2019s smartphones. By joining forces with Nvidia, the combined company would be a powerhouse in the chip industry.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNvidia is a fast-growing industry player whose chips are used to run the intense calculations for graphics\u2014and play a key role in videogaming, cloud-computing and other activities for which the coronavirus pandemic has stoked demand. That has sent its shares up more than 100% this year, making it the best-performing stock in the S&amp;P 500 index.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShould a deal come together, it would be one of the largest transactions so far this year and potentially the largest semiconductor deal ever. Though business disruptions stemming from the pandemic have dented global deal volume, consolidation has kept up pace in the semiconductor industry as chip makers seek scale and expand their product portfolios to support the increasing number of everyday items that are connected to the internet. Such linkage is commonly referred to as the Internet of Things. Another of the year\u2019s biggest deals was the $22 billion purchase of Maxim Integrated Products Inc. MXIM -0.53% by fellow chip maker Analog Devices Inc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA sale to Nvidia could prompt scrutiny from antitrust regulators and potentially pushback from Arm\u2019s customers, which include major chip makers and electronics manufacturers such as Intel Corp., Samsung Electronics Co. and Apple Inc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported in July that SoftBank was exploring options for Arm including a full or partial sale or an IPO. Arm had said it planned to transfer two Internet of Things services units into new entities that would be owned and operated by SoftBank as part of a move to focus on its core semiconductor-Ip business. It later reversed course on that move, saying it would instead keep the operations in-house.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSoftBank, for its part, had been under pressure to shore up its flagging stock price and promised some $40 billion in asset disposals. Most or all of that is already under way or completed and its shares are up more than 20% this year. Among the sales: big chunks of its holdings in China\u2019s Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and T-Mobile US Inc. following the wireless provider\u2019s merger with Sprint Corp.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSoftBank has also purchased options tied to around $50 billion worth of individual tech stocks this year. The sheer size of the bet has had an outsize effect on the overall stock market, driving prices higher, the Journal has reported.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt SoftBank, Chief Executive Masayoshi Son has been working with a small team to negotiate the Arm deal including the chief executive of the chip company, Simon Segars, Chief Financial Officer Yoshimitsu Goto, as well as Rajeev Misra, CEO of the firm\u2019s giant Vision Fund, and Akshay Naheta, another executive at the fund.",

Due to their lithographic issues outlined [here](https://www.infinitevalueptr.com/post/intel_10nm) Intel have been forced to turn to TSMC for chips.\n\nThe second part of your statement would be true in a completely free market, but TSMC's management have stated that they don't view Intel as a long term customer (while they do view AMD as one). This is pretty evident given the fact that once Intel sort out their process they'll abandon TSMC and go back to in house manufacturing only, meaning TSMC's long term interests are aligned with ensuring AMD sees long term growth over Intel. From the comments TSMC management has made over the past few years and the execution of their business plans, I believe that TSMC management is focused more on long term value generation than short term profit, meaning your scenario wouldn't be likely to occur.",

They need to hire talent but instead have opted out for nepotism and politics. Their yields are awful, their CPUs were never efficient (Lookup Delidding), their pricing is high, always over heating, always higher than advertised power usage, and struggles to run games by throttling the GPU. Some of these could be my personal experience, but I've seen this posted too many times now.\n\nThey do have an edge on some things, but that's not going to stay long. Their current strategy is to buy back their stock and market against AMD instead of investing in their own technology and talent.\n\nThis stock will be a buy the day they put a CEO with an engineering background that'll fire a lot of the dead weight and hire talented people to focus mainly on technology and ease off of the advertisement and stock buy backs.\n\nIf you've read thus far, great. If you're still not convinced, which most Intel people aren't, here is a question: What would convince you? An actual live video of Lisa Su wiping the floor with Intel CPUs?

They stand to gain the most of anyone on earth.   \n\n\nSuddenly if you want their datacenter grade GPUS (they limit industry use GPUS and APUS) you have to use ARM as they only make drivers for ARM for those GPU.\n\n  \nThen suddenly, just maybe, they plan to stop supporting x86\\_64 completely, and develop something not unlike risc-v with the previous ARM team behind it. They now have a proprietary chip with none of the backwards compatability slow downs that come with Intel based chips. (they hold backwards compatible registers going back to the 1970s, taking up valuable die space).   \n\n\nSuddenly RISC might be able to leverage it's benefits to become CRISC-V with that kind of backing, and since RISC is always clock cycle fast, x86 will literally die when CRISC-V comes (multiple RISC executions per clock cycle, a complex reduced instruction set computer).   \n\n\nThat's it.

So per core they are doing better and also more gpu speed / cores.   They sacrificed cores for that, hence the lower multithreaded.  I'd guess intel figures most people using thin and light notebooks don't really need 8 cores and would rather have more GPU., probably a good tradeoff for most people\n\nThere will eventually be a tigerlake - H is rumored to actually have less GPU onboard than tigerlake-u since I guess its assumed those will use discrete graphics anyway.  So Intel probably will sell a lot of tigerlake.  It shouldn't really lose much ground on laptops if any in the next year or 2.  I do own a lot of intel shares, and fully expect it to get back to $60 ish in the next 3-6 months.  There is actually a shortage of laptops / chromebooks right now because of the wfh / school from home thing even for the older cpus so Intel should do allright",
