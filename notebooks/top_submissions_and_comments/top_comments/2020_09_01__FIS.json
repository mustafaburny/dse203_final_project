        "body": "\"Due to those losses, I stopped investing for a couple of months exactly when the prices were at minimum of the year.\"\n\nI think a broad issue with this sub that I've seen over the years is that people buy when things are good (eventually - this happens after a couple of months of half a dozen \"WHY IS THE MARKET GOING UP?\" threads every day), but when the market has a correction - something that used to be viewed as normal - it's viewed as almost apocalyptic. I saw a post the other day about Amazon being down 10% as a \"massive decline\" - if you cannot tolerate a 10% decline in Amazon don't own it, because there are times where that's the initial reaction to earnings. If a 10% decline throws your view of owning a company into question, then your thesis on why you bought it in the first place probably wasn't that strong. If something goes down 10% and you look at it in your portfolio and if your first instinct is to dump it, then that tells you exactly how strong you really feel about the company.  Growth stock investing is not going to be trees grow to the moon or years like this where Ark funds are up 70% or whatever they were; there's going to be periods that are highly volatile and far more volatile than the last month - look at growth names at the end of 2018.  This year with growth is not normal; it's a situation where things came together that benefited a lot of growth companies tremendously.\n\n1) I think people have to view a March when the VIX is 80 and the CNN Fear and Greed is 2 and yadda yadda as the time to really lean in. That's the time when if you have an even somewhat longer-term view you're getting opportunities. By the time this sub has warmed up to the market is not the time to lean in.\n\n2) People have to have a longer-term view and not this \"one foot out the door\" mentality where every bit of market volatility and events that might cause volatility is something to flee from. There's been way more threads in the last year where people talk about \"selling everything\" - not a decision that should be easy and a decision you should make very, very rarely - if ever. Volatility creates opportunities, you just have to think in months and years with purchases, not \"OMG WHAT IS THE MARKET GONNA DO TOMORROW?\"  \n\n\" I want to know how can I feel less sad about this.\"\n\nIt's a bummer and I'm sorry that you're dismayed at what happened but you're going to miss opportunities. Everyone does. I owned VFF when it was around $1 and sold not long before it went to $6 and then eventually the high teens. There's plenty of other instances over the years. I think what I'm looking for in terms of individual names has become specific enough that there are things that do well where I know I wouldn't have bought it any way, but with that it's not being bummed as much as trying to understand why it did well and any takeaways - could I have looked at it differently? Etc. If I missed something there's always going to be a bit of dismay, but I've gradually tried to be far more automated about it - is there is a lesson/takeaway from this? y/n? then move on.\n\nThere is going to be a lot of \"could haves\" throughout your time in investing. The issue I think becomes that was before and today is a new day - literally. Chasing now after what you could have done is not always going to be the best idea - have to look at it with a fresh perspective and consider what is the best long-term strategy to build on right now.\n\n\"When I backtested my ETF purchase across my deposit intervals, I found that I could have made 37.9% in returns\"\n\nCould have. I wouldn't base decision making on what things have done, the question becomes what is the potential going forward for the next 3-5 years. I look at my portfolio all the time with the thought of - if I was stuck with this portfolio tomorrow and couldn't sell it for 5 years, would I be okay with that? If something is a no, then changes need to be made. Things are bought with the intent of owning long-term and bought with the view of potential over the coming years. I have no idea what the market will do tomorrow or next week.\n\n\"When I want to invest smaller amounts of money, I have to rely on fractional shares and my brokerage doesn't provide that, so I have to shift to Robinhood or other trading platform.\"\n\nIf you want fractional shares, I'd much rather suggest Fidelity than RH. I don't see the appeal of RH at this point.\n\n\"AAPL 20%, MSFT 15%, AMZN 15%, \"\n\nSo half your portfolio is the household names everyone already knows, likes and probably owns. These are not bad companies and I think they will continue to do well in the future, but I also do think that it's at a point where people have to devote more if they're going to be in tech to finding growth beyond FANG names.",

        "body": "\"But at some point valuations might be over-stretched, future growth priced in and no greater fool showing up to pass the hot potato.\"\n\nThe issue with this is that I've read \"DOT COM!\" \"BUBBLE!\" on here for 5 years. There have absolutely been major rotations out of tech at times over the last 5 years but if you regarded those as confirmation of your bias that everything is a bubble rather than as a buying opportunity then you've missed out. Buying what \"appeared cheap\" and/or was \"impacted\" earlier this year when markets were cratering has not turned out nearly as well as buying what this sub has continually complained about as being \"too expensive.\"\n\nWill that change? Quite possibly.  When? Nobody on here has any idea. But the issue I think becomes sort of like the people who said for the last 10 years that \"value has gotta make a comeback, right?\" Just because something is cheap does not mean it can't get cheaper, just because something seems expensive does not mean it cannot get moreso. Just because something has underperformed for 5 years does not mean that it can't continue to underperform for another 5.  Without a very distinct catalyst in mind, incessant top calling (and you've seen it on this sub for years) is often an error.  Without a catalyst in mind, calling something cheap can often wind up waiting while watching what's working continue to do so. This sub has talked up big oil this year a lot because of being impacted (this, after big oil names have largely disappointed for 5+ years before this) and when BP literally came out and predicted that \"oil demand growth may have peaked\" and a lot of the responses on here were basically: \"well, what do they know?\" Buffett sold airlines: \"well, what does he know?\"\n\nThere is an eagerness to dismiss tech and growth and embrace what is viewed as cheap but when what is viewed as cheap isn't working, people keep trying to will the trade into working. There was a great interview with Fidelity Contrafund manager Will Danoff the other day and I liked this particular part:\n\n\"So, I'd say it's a very healthy give-and-take and dialogue. And I would say, often because Joel and I and all the other fund managers started as Fidelity research analysts, when a new analyst arrives, they usually show up at my office with a list, and say \u201cI'm the new railroad analyst. Here are my names, and I like XYZ railroad because the group's trading at 14 times earnings, and this ones trading at 11 times earnings.\u201d And I might say, \u201cWow, that's interesting. Why is that one trading at such a discount to the group?\u201d *And the analysts might say, \u201cWell, they just lost their largest customer\u201d or \u201cthey've got a big business into Mexico and Mexico's into a recession,\u201d or \u201cTrump wants to build a wall and therefore the Mexican business is falling off a cliff.\u201d And I usually say, \u201cThat's not the type of company I'm interested in*. **I'm interested in companies that are doing well, where the earnings outlook is positive, where earnings per share is growing. Maybe it's growing faster than people think. What do you have on your list that would fit that bill even if it's more expensive than the average company in your group?\u201d** So, it's that's sort of give-and-take. And I might encourage an analyst to reorient their priority list to help me look for stocks that fit my ideal pattern.\" I think this sub is often looking for the impacted, but maybe - just maybe - consider more the Danoff perspective. (https://www.morningstar.com/podcasts/the-long-view/40)\n\nAs for tech, there are things that are absolutely ahead (or well ahead) of themselves, but I wouldn't paint everything in tech with one broad brush or would I be a tech fund either (tech and healthcare are about 65%ish of my portfolio, with the latter making up a large chunk of that.) There's a lot of innovation going on beyond tech. \n\nIf you think that tech is overheated, that doesn't mean that looking into what's been the most impacted is the correct answer, either. What's somewhere in the middle? Something that isn't \"hot\", but also hasn't been obliterated and where you can make a good fundamental case (not just \"it's down a lot!\") for the company in the coming years?",

No one has a perfect memory, and we all occasionally get things wrong.**\n\nBut what we have witnessed at Nikola, and specifically from Trevor Milton, is a pattern of well-planned and deliberate acts of deception ranging from (a) the staging of non-working products as if fully functional, wrapped in numerous lies about capabilities that don\u2019t exist; (b) the staging of misleading videos, which require extensive premeditation, planning and execution; (c) material lies about capabilities, partnerships and products that simply do not exist at all, on video and often in front of entire rooms full of people; and (d) a culture of secrecy and intimidation that to this point has largely kept it all under wraps.\n\n\n*We think Trevor Milton is incapable of telling the truth. We believe he lies like most people breathe. It is natural for him, and our extensive review of his history suggests it has been this way throughout his entire business career.*\n\nEvery now and then a story comes around that exposes how little the \u201cexperts\u201d really know. Theranos had inked partnerships with Walgreens, Safeway, and Cleveland Clinic and had staffed its board with luminaries. Madoff raised billions in capital from sophisticated investors across the globe.\n\n*The remarkable thing about Nikola\u2019s story is not that someone like Trevor Milton exists, but that he has managed to parlay his stories and lies into deals with some of the best manufacturers and partners in the world by claiming to own vast proprietary technology and having successfully built revolutionary products that simply didn\u2019t exist.*\n\nHe transformed these deceptions and false promises into an empire that at one point was valued at $34 billion, larger than Ford and Fiat Chrysler. He\u2019s signed deals with GM, Anheuser Busch, Bosch, Worthington, and a slew of significant automotive players. He received investment from Fidelity and ValueAct, among other name-brand institutions.\n\nWe truly think Nikola is both a sign of the times and a story for the ages.",

        "body": "This, to some degree: \"Train conceded value will become so unloved it will have to make a comeback, but warned that some of value investors\u2019 most compelling opportunities will be revealed to be ruinous value traps, due to digital disruption.\" (https://portfolio-adviser.com/nick-train-value-was-a-20th-century-phenomenon/)\n\nVarious thoughts:\n\n1. I think actual compelling value ideas are difficult and few-and-far-between. There is this perception that everything that is big and known and down a lot is a compelling value when much of these are not and/or are value traps. Somewhat related, I really agree with this discussion by Fidelity Contrafund manager Will Danoff: https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EiEOiBRWoAQaPdZ?format=jpg&amp;name=medium on focusing on what is doing well.\n\n2. You have a time period where the new economy names are the focus and there has been significant growth pulled forward. I don't think that this current crisis \"changes everything\", but it has pulled forward growth in the winners and there are themes and behaviors that I think will carry forward for years after this is over. While many on here still seem to disagree with this, there have clearly been winners throughout this that have benefited, some significantly.\n\n3. The problem with that is that you basically have a crowding (this year it's been a stampede) into new economy names and people ignoring old economy names (and that does play to Train's discussion in that 2018 article: \"\u201cIn 2018 it looks as though working out which companies are advantaged and which challenged by digital disruption may deliver better returns than establishing what is currently \u2018cheap\u2019 or \u2018dear\u2019 or whether macro-economic trends favour \u2018cyclical value\u2019 or \u2018quality growth\u2019,\u201d he said.\") A funny bit but I think this is very true this year - \"even when the market is in \"rotation\" mode, you can feel that moment intraday when people are like wtf am I doing, give me a hit of that sweet sweet digital transformation (https://twitter.com/modestproposal1/status/1293211807709003776) The problem with that is that you now have a lot of people focused on/crowding into one part of the market and it gets ahead of itself (and some niches way ahead of themselves.) There's no gradual cool off of what's done well, the rotations are total \"escalator up\" for months followed by these \"elevator down\" movements.\n\n4.  There will probably be a more sustained rotation if there was a real solution to this crisis, but even then I think my question becomes how \"sticky\" are people in various \"value\" sectors. A rotation out of the winners into losers doesn't fix the pre-existing issues of poorly run retailers but I think people confuse price increase with the idea that everything is a-okay now. I think a lot of impacted sectors are going to be to some degree impacted even after this is over. So I think ultimately the rotation out of winners into losers is more an opportunity to buy the winners and with the losers, you have to be selective.  I've talked up medical devices (SYK) as a sector given the procedure delays, but those are well off the lows. People just think everything impacted by this is a value and is going to be okay again after, I just don't feel that way - especially if this takes another year to before it's really solved.\n\n5. It's pretty telling that for all the outperformance of growth over the last decade that even in the midst of a pandemic, value still underperformed in the decline in March and then proceeded to spectacularly outperform post March low.  I do think that value will make a comeback, but it will probably be brief and I think people are going to have to be selective.",

        "body": "FWIW, I'm a (hobbyist) Unity dev, and there are definitely some recent trends that are frustrating, but it really boils down to growing pains.\n\nFor a long time Unity was the cute little free engine for making dime-a-dozen mobile games and lightweight, browser-based knockoffs of bigger franchises. You *could* use it to target platforms like PC and consoles, but Unity games couldn't yield the quality and performance that something like Unreal could.\n\nSince John Riccitiello signed on, there's been a big push to make it a grown-up, do-everything, AAA-quality game engine that can compete on Unreal's level. There's been an absolute crap-ton of resources dumped into R&amp;D and engineering to improve the core engine at a pretty breakneck pace, and those improvements have consistently been really impressive.\n\nUnfortunately, what that means for Unity developers *right now* is that we're in this awkward limbo between the old legacy good-enough-for-prototyping systems and the new grown-up good-enough-for-AAA systems. A lot of the new systems are in beta, and are *really* enticing to start using now because the improvement over the old systems is like night and day, but they're also kind of a huge headache to work with because they're under active development, so the APIs are constantly changing, the UX is a little rough around the edges, and there are some missing features and the occasional bug that can be frustrating to work around.\n\nBut I've been around long enough to see at least a few of those systems go from unusable nightmare beta status to production-ready releases, and it's frankly amazing how fast it's happened and what a boon those new systems have been. For a couple examples:\n\n* The scriptable render pipelines bring an unprecedented level of flexibility (for a closed-source engine) to engineers who need more low-level control over rendering, and the two pre-packaged SRPs (URP and HDRP) bring an absolutely massive improvement in graphical fidelity and performance over the built-in renderer.\n* The new DOTS/ECS system is one of the single most exciting developments in gaming tech I've ever seen, and none of their competitors (even the smaller players like CryEngine and Godot) have anything close. I won't delve into the technical details here, but Unity's ECS system was *super* janky to work with as recently as a year ago, but I just gave it another test run the other weekend because I was curious to see how it's coming along, and was really impressed by how intuitive it was to work with and how fully-featured it is now. If you're willing to get your hands a little dirty, it's viable to build an entire Unity game with ECS today. If you wanted to do that with any other off-the-shelf engine, you would literally have to rewrite all of the core systems from scratch.\n\nAnyway, this comment is long enough, but to summarize: Yes, it can be annoying to work with right now, but there are good reasons for that. Unity is getting way better and way more capable than it's ever been, and it's doing it really, really fast.",

Of course this isn\u2019t an absolute rule by any means but what Fidelity\u2019s research shows.\n\nIf you go by the 4% rule you\u2019ll need 25x your expected annual expenses in your retirement to never run out of money. Going with $40K/year would mean you\u2019ll need $1M, which is very doable given you still have 15-20 years of peak income earning potential. Not to mention that most people who retire will still earn some type of supplement income (e.g. your pension) and collect some sort of social security.",

By looking at the overall profitability? Sure, AWS has a much higher profit margin but that doesn't say anything about whether or not they are subsidizing products on retail. Amazon e-commerce, by design, is reinvesting all the cash back into the business for top-line growth. E-commerce divison itself has so many other businesses within it - profits from TV could be subsidizing shoes or phone cables. We only see the overall profits of the _entire_ e-commerce divison.  Also, the marketplace division is significant chunk of the e-commerce revenue (Amazon only counts the fees they charge 3rd parties as revenue). Profit margins for those will be a lot better than that of the first-party retail business as Amazon doesn't have to carry inventory at all. Also, advertising is another fast growing segment with higher profit-margins.I am not sure if we have enough data to make any comment regarding who is subsidizing what.\n\nAlso, AWS itself faces very serious competition from Azure, GCP, IBM, Oracle etc They are releasing a tonne of new features every year. Why will they not want use the cash from AWS for growing AWS but subsidize toilet-paper? Seems odd to me.\n\nFrom what I understand the profitability of AWS is providing a cover for Amazon from a Wall Street standpoint - \"Here have some profits, let us concentrate on growth.\"\n\nI also don't see how breaking up Amazon into AWS and E-commerce creates room for additional innovation. There is very serious competition for both the businesses.",

        "body": "Absolutely brilliant write up. Tech equities became really expensive and I was looking for some value alternatives in tech sector as well. HPE definitely stood out but initially I was quite skeptical as I thought this would be company that sells servers or networking equipment. Upon investigating it I'm super intrigued and will open position next week.  \n\nI love that they detached from legacy PC and printers business, I love that early on they spun off their services &amp; consulting business, I love that they offloaded their legacy software business to Micro Focus (poor guys are struggling to sell it now) and I love that they are not competing with Azure or AWS but instead specialise in their own niche. I think that HPE's hybrid cloud solution is probably the best offering in industry right now. IBM, AWS and Google Cloud offer hybrid solutions but it looks like they are very nascent offerings compared to HPE's.\n\nI also love acquisitions they been making. Like you mentioned Silver Peak and Cray (which were very smart acquisitions) but also BlueData (AI &amp; big data analysis), Plexxi (hybrid networking) and others.\n\nAlso, their focus on the edge and hybrid seems to be very well timed. Edge computing is still in its early stages but will undoubtedly expand in the future. A lot of people talk about hybrid as stepping stone for legacy infrastructures which is true. However, with data privacy and data security regulations becoming stricter hybrid will become way more than just stepping stone to full cloud. In Europe it already matters great deal where are you servers located and who can access them.\n\nFinally, HPE feels like it could be story similar to Microsoft. That is, Microsoft was perceived as this legacy, stagnant organization and it was trading at price reflecting that sentiment. Until their cloud offering changed everything. If all goes well with HPE it could be very similar story and brilliant entry point right now.\n\nP.S.\n\nSpeaking of undervalued tech equities. Do you have any thoughts on Seagate? They are trading at quite low multiples and with growing cloud, data storage will have to grow too. On the  other hand HDDs are legacy hardware and they are not very strong at making SSDs yet.",

        "body": "I bought some stock on June 1st, not the best day price wise but it\u2019s the stock I plan to hold the longest out of my whole portfolio, except for MSFT maybe. I made a DD for myself and made a brief summary around April. Most of it is based on their 10-K last year and their first 10-Q of the year. The key here is that this has been seen as a dinosaur for the past decade, due to lack of innovation, terrible management decisions (crazy high EPS and a buyback program that should have been cut long ago), and recruiting issues. A new CEO (Arvind Krishna) and a switch to the cloud (and quantum computing for the 2030s at least) are the key changes that could drive change. Sorry if it\u2019s a bit messy, was not meant to be posted when I wrote it : \n\nIBM : New CEO Arvid Krishna has my trust, hope he will change top and mid tier management (which did weird accounting tricks like the pseudo Lenovo \u00ab\u00a0sale/buy\u00a0\u00bb, laid off workforce for no reason, did not R&amp;D enough, focused on business services and consulting too much, had the crazy 20$ EPS goal, etc\u2026). Krishna pushed Red Hat acquisition (open source enterprise software, will allow them to become hybrid cloud providers, hybrid cloud is interoperable (BFF example), scalable (ERP switch to 3rd parties), portable, and secure (user data still in private cloud)). Krishna was senior VP for cloud and cognitive software. \nIBM has switched industries several times throughout its life : time clocks, then tabulating machine, then typewriter, then mainframe (good changes), then personal computers (good initially but then poor because used competitors\u2019 chips), etc\u2026 Cloud/AI could be their next successful switch (1/3rd of revenue in 2019, still increasing). Quantum Computing too, as they\u2019ve strongly positioned themselves as industry leaders, but that\u2019s in the very, very long run.\nWhile not the most important aspect, company is a dividend aristocrat (increasing div payout for 25 years), but what matters is that div payment was never removed, even though I think it should have been decreased during the struggles of the 2010s and instead reinvested in R&amp;D, they should have also paused their share buyback program. Financials : P/E around 10 (very good for a tech company), P/BV is 5.5 (good for a tech company, especially one transitioning to less tangible assets), net income slowly increasing, current ratio of nearly 1 at end of 03/31 which is decent given Red Hat acquisition and coronavirus, D/E is 2.62 (that one is indeed bad, but they got cash I guess, still not great).",

        "body": "Bit of a personal anecdote here:\n\nSo I have a degree in IT with a focus on Computer Networking.\n\nI once interviewed for IBM because they had positions open for Network Admins.  Unfortunately, when I sat down and looked over their list of jobs I discovered that they were only looking for senior level positions (something they did not mention in the email they sent to my university).\n\nI decided to interview anyway because I was already there in suit and tie so I wasn't about to get all dressed up for nothing.\n\nThe interview went well, but the guy told me he just didn't have anything for me at the time.\n\nI decided to walk around afterwards and saw a guy interviewing for entry level programmers.  My campus did not offer a Software degree (they offered it at a different campus), but I did have to take 9 credits in basic programming which was Java, C++, and HTML.  I had already taken the Java and C++ classes.\n\nI sit down with the guy and we get to talking.\n\nHe asks my background in coding.  I tell him one intro in Java and C++ so far.\n\nHe asks why am I interviewing if my degree is not focused on coding.  I tell him because those two classes opened my eyes to something that I didn't even know I wanted before.  I love creating stuff with code, I find it cathartic to sit and stare at code, getting lost in it while trying to figure out where my errors are, the absolute joy of finally getting it to compile and run.  I even started to make some basic programs at home in my free time.\n\nHe asks me if I have any of my work to show him.  I did not bring any copies of my code because I wasn't even thinking about the possibility of interviewing for any other positions (let this be a lesson to anyone who's still getting their degree, bring everything!).\n\nI tell him I did have it on a thumb drive that I carry around in my briefcase, but of course he waves his hand and says that's a security issue (totally agreed).\n\nHe asks me what a function is.  I draw a blank.  I ended up stammering out something like, \"it's the part of the code that does stuff\".  Not necessarily wrong, but more of an ELI5 definition.\n\nHe shows me some code and asks what I can decipher from it.  It's a function that takes a variable, runs it through a formula, returns a variable, and then loops 4 more times using the new return variable each time, and finally shows a set of the return variables at the print out.  He confirmed that I was right.\n\nHe asks me what that sets of numbers is called.  Obviously it's an array, and I had heard the term before, but again I did not know at the time.  He frowns and says something along the lines of, \"You really don't know basic terminology.  You should work on that.\"\n\nWe shook hands and parted ways, never got a call back.  Now, I know I messed up by not having some of my work printed out, and not being up on the terminology.  But it really rubbed me raw that this guy was so hung up on terminology, knowing that coding was like 5% of my entire degree, and yet I still had a basic working knowledge of programming to at least be able to read and understand what was going on, and that I was passionate enough about it to go home and write some basic programs of my own.\n\nNow I don't know that the lack of terminology was the ultimate reason I was turned down.  I do know that they were looking to start up a class that would take about 3 years to go through, and they were going to teach a proprietary language that was similar to Java.  Obviously, the terminology would have been brought up again multiple times in that 3 year program.  The only clue I had for why I was turned down was the lack of lingo.\n\nI am now a manager at a FinTech company, and I don't ask \"lingo\" questions of interviewees.  I want to know if they understand the meat and potatoes of what the job entails because, to me, that means so much more.  Lingo will happen over time as they do the job.\n\nI'm not saying that is all the OP was concerned about in their interviews, but they certainly seem to think it's a flaw in an interviewee that makes them unsuitable for hiring.",

DLSS is something AMD or any other company with a bunch of ML engineers and money can replicate given some time. \n\nIt's not impossible for other companies to replicate or immitate or substitute some of those technologies / products. AMD is certainly catching up and will carve off some fractions of the market in the AI/ML &amp; datacenter businesses.\n\nThe ARM acquisition, if it happens, will confer a competitive advantage like no other. As an NVDA stockholder I wish this happens. As a Brit working in and loving tech, I am slowly dying on the inside... \n\nSomething to remember is that this is a fast expanding market and not a saturated one, there's room for multiple players to grow and win at the same time. \n\nThat being said, I still think Intel will likely be the next IBM. Is it gonna tank overnight? No, and there will probably be plenty of rallies to make money off, but long term I wouldn't look to hold.",

But intel is undervalued in the short term based on reactionary sell offs due to bad news. It\u2019s undervalued. They have a lot of talent. I live close to intel. I know a lot of people who work there. They\u2019re not going to go under overnight and they don\u2019t ONLY sell chips. They\u2019ll pivot and react accordingly. If I\u2019m wrong then I only lose a small percentage of money, if I\u2019m right, then I make serious gains. It\u2019s meant to mitigate risk. Buying into intel is meant to help diversify my portfolio and I honestly feel they are undervalued at this point. Should it have dipped? Yes. By that much? No. Intel is still fucking intel. They will continue to do well for the coming years.\n\nCould they turn into an ibm? Yeah maybe. But by then I\u2019ll be out of the stock. But the revamped logo and some updates to hardware is enough to push the needle.",

It might not be quite as steep a bubble yet, but its definitely getting there.  it took 4 years to go from 1200 -&gt; 5000 in 2000.   4 years ago the nasdaq was 5000 or so, so I could see it gettingto even 15000 and then crashing.  maybe not quite as big, but still as someone above mentioned economic conditions are far far worse now and we have much more debt than we did in 2000 as a nation",
