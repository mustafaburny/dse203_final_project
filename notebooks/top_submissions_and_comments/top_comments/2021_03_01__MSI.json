I used to follow the situation in Ukraine back in 2014 - 2016 when it was more active. \n\nA lot of them had notoriety and even became memes of sorts. They were usually assassinated with explosives by the Ukrainian government. I dont know the guy in the video but as an example [Givi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Tolstykh), who among other things got his meme status from a video clip where he is completely unphased that there is artillery landing a couple of meters from him, died by an unexpected visit of an ATGM to his office. Another guy, \"[Motorola](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsen_Pavlov)\" got killed by an IED in an elevator to his apartment.\n\nDont feel too sorry for them though. Givi was recorded abusing Ukrainian POWs and using them for forced labor (against the Geneva conventions)\n\nSo dead, just not by drone but by IEDs and rockets.\n\n(I am recalling these things and may not have all the facts straight, so dont get mad but correct me if Im wrong)",
