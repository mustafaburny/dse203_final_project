I went from HP to Hewlett-Packard Enterprise to DXC Technology, and the whole time we were employed at DXC there was a feeling of death around with no morale and a very sad feeling around the fact that most were told they should just be happy they have a job. Although I literally sat and watched as person by person around me all inevitably got laid off. They'd come in on Thursday and be told the next day (Friday) would be their last day and they'd be lucky to get severance. I eventually left the company because of anything could be better, and I was looking to grow and not be held down. \n\nNo raises or bonuses for years, layoffs left and right, vile environment, etc. I wouldn't own it, but then again I don't track the stock price and I see it from a perspective that would never interest me in looking.",

I am not done buying so whenever they get cheaper I spill in some more. These are not recommendations but stocks I have found potential in. \n\nGood thing about dividend stocks is that they tend to have a more stable price and not swing down that much.",

Our clients want renewable power, and we make it happen for them, sending out RFPs to developers and getting their project bids. We get a fee from our clients for brokering these projects. We also finance solar projects ourselves so that we own the power - this is a steady source of revenue for the life of the solar system. We closed ~$270mil of on-site solar deals in the last month.

        "body": "If you really wanted to buy just stick to solid companies or etfs. GOOGL, AAPL, MSFT, FB, etc and etfs lik voo, spy, qqq or xlk(?)are going to do fine. \n\nAMZN, DG are solid bets to weather the storm but arent down a ton compared to others.\n\nAnything thats a necessity or provides bargains will be fine PG, KO, PEP, HD, WMT, etc\n\nMedical is probably okay tho I'd stick with solid companies not speculative unless you can tolarate risk but BMY, JNJ, ABBV, etc should be fine.\n\nDefense never goes away HON, LMT, RNT, etc\n\nCan play the \"game is rigged\" card and go with kinda scumbags JPM, BLK, etc\n\nUtilities AWK, AQN, D, SO, WEC etc just watch for what kind of exposure you want i.e. oil, coal, nat gas folk have different feels on em.\n\nRenewables its eventually the future but caution as the sector is getting fucked by cheap oil, the pandemic, and a loss of subsidies. A dem in the white house would prob be needed to get the subsidies back. But SEDG, NEE, VSLR, ENPH, etc are decent.\n\nThere's a bunch of other good buys for good reasons but this should be a good start for ya.\n\nAlso and it should be obvious, I am not a financial advisor nor should anything I say be taken as anything other than friendly scuttlebutt.\n\nTickers are from memory so hopefully I got em right.r\n\nEdit: typos",
