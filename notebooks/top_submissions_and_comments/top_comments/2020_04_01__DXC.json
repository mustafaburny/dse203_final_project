They have 100 people saying 100 different things, so whatever happens, they can claim they were right, and ignore all of their bad calls.  \n\nI don't keep a record, but it seems like they are wrong worse than Cramer... I remember their price reduction on TSLA back in 2013 when it first broke $100 per share, and they reduced their target to $80. It shot up from there, doubling in less than a year.",

I went from HP to Hewlett-Packard Enterprise to DXC Technology, and the whole time we were employed at DXC there was a feeling of death around with no morale and a very sad feeling around the fact that most were told they should just be happy they have a job. Although I literally sat and watched as person by person around me all inevitably got laid off. They'd come in on Thursday and be told the next day (Friday) would be their last day and they'd be lucky to get severance. I eventually left the company because of anything could be better, and I was looking to grow and not be held down. \n\nNo raises or bonuses for years, layoffs left and right, vile environment, etc. I wouldn't own it, but then again I don't track the stock price and I see it from a perspective that would never interest me in looking.",

        "body": "$30k is significant. I'd love to have $30k, but I don't because I'm poor. And that's why I'm giving investment advice on reddit...so... A lot of eggs in a few baskets is easier to watch than ten baskets. You can't effectively watch ten companies. You will have more luck getting to know two or three. You will also be more invested mentally. Putting $3k in ten companies doesn't make you more secure. It thins out your ability to pay attention effectively. Ten will make you emotional. You're focus will be split ten ways and you won't be making significant money from any of them. Focus on your best three or four ideas. Put $10k into Disney. Then wait another quarter and put another $10k into Disney. Wait another quarter and put the last $10k into Disney. ONE stock. Or you can buy some junior mining penny stocks like me. Up 50% since Thursday. This is speculation on the assumption that after a crash there is a mining boom. This is gambling. Disney is the real deal. Bank on Disney, put $3k into sphinx resources. You'll regret sphinx, but Disney will pay off until the day you're diagnosed with stage 4 cancer. Know what causes cancer? stress. You'll stress about ten small investments until you sell for some reason some day, or you'll feel secure in one good investment forever. \n\nWhy DXC? because it's a spin off and Joel Greenblatt told me those can be lucrative. I'm a fan though. I want it to do well. I like DXC and Garrett... I own neither. There are at least seven companies I'd buy before those two. Six of them are Canadian banks. If I wanted a sure thing... If I wanted something that would exist in 50 years... something I could buy enough of so that their dividends afforded more shares of that company... something that creditors trust even in a crisis, something with a brand akin to a cult... something that just cannot fail... I'd buy Disney. It's only $30k. Buy Disney all through the recession. $30k worth of shares averaging down over the next year will pay off until you die. \n\nAll those other choices are meh. Amazon might be a good one, but it's on top already. Tesla isn't profitable and they make cars. These other ones are not 50 year companies. They compete in competitive industries where competitive destruction reigns. Disney is different. In conclusions: spend $30k on apple.",

I think this is okay to do here, because it's not the daily thread. \n\nI'm pretty new to WSB, but I have been trading [badly] for a long time, and I have to say it's felt like treading water. I used to think that unless I was some trust fund baby with 2mil in cash waiting to be invested, it was gonna be the long haul for me.\n\nThen I found WSB, and it was great, but with each gain, there'd be things I couldn't control, or I'd chase the advice of people who didn't really do their DD. I was convinced that with all the bad news we were getting, that stocks would plummet last week, as I learned the hard way something I [and I would imagine, all of us] already knew -- the market doesn't do what it is supposed to, it does what the MMs want it to do, and in the process it takes advantage of the common trader.\n\nBut every once in a while, we get someone like /u/Variation-Separate who not only takes the time to share his secrets, but breaks it down for us, interacts with the community, and even fucking gives us confidence when the market seemingly isn't following the prophecy. He doesn't have to do any of this.\n\nI cannot do what he does as well as he does it. Not yet. But I am thankful for the knowledge I've gained, thankful for the tendies, and thankful for having my faith in good people and challenging corrupt systems resurrected.\n\nMuch love, OP.

I've got a bit riding on this, a lot of which will die if a viable downtrend doesn't start before May and I can't adjust. I don't subscribe to telling people diamond hands, or blindly worshipping VS. We all have to adapt. But I am incredibly appreciative for the time he's put into these posts and educating us.\n\nThat said, we have no idea yet what will actually happen long term. /u/Variation-Separate has put together a really compelling plan. He didn't have to share it. No one has to follow it. But if you, like me, believe that there is validity and truth in his analysis, then do your own DD to embrace that vibe. Yesterday, people were freaking out in the first two hours of intraday when there was no drop, then we plummeted. Today, we flirted with 252 and are at risk of another leg up. If in the last two days, you have decided that this uptrend in the market is enough to call it quits, no one can blame you, but I would argue, maybe VS's posts aren't for you. \n\nI am a bear rn. I'm a bear not just because I have positions that reflect it -- I truly believe we're in a bad spot, and corporations, MMs, the Fed are being really irresponsible right now.  We're being set up for some horrible economic rebuilding in the 2020s. The longer the market waits to reflect this, the more fucked ordinary people are when they do. They don't have our best interests in mind. Deep down, I want us all to get through this and come out on top.\n\nI hope I'm not foolish in thinking that, collectively, we have the tools and minds to figure this out and at least make a little money before things get really bad. It's a difficult time to have conviction, but that's why I'm here in this thread (and no longer checking the dailies). Keep strong, fellow autists.

        "body": "To all those worried: I don't believe that VS meant that the direction of this market depends on today's actions alone. He is saying that there is major support point around SPY 248 - if the market lands above 252, it signals an upward movement to 263 which, if broken, means we are going to 270. If we hit 270, we are going to 300. It would be a sharper \"V\" shape recovery. \n\nTomorrow, or even next week, it is possible to do battle at 248 and win and signal a downward movement towards 231. Here we get into a faster free-fall.\n\nIt looks like a bear flag is happening on SPY and it is possible that the movement down is an escalator. If SPY breaks 263, the bear flag is pretty invalid IMO. VIX would mellow and we could reach the goal, but with more sideways trading (drawn out over months).\n\nCorrect or comment, please\n\nEdit: could also be other continuation patterns, but this theory more aligns with a quicker drop, like the bear flag...",

Correct me if I\u2019m wrong here but this could get ugly tomorrow.\n\nEdit: looking at December 2018 recovery we saw a large discrepancy between the DIX and GEX. DIX was in the high 40\u2019s and GEX was extremely negative. Negative gamma causes the movement of the market to be accelerated, no matter if it\u2019s up or down. In the 2018 recovery it was an upward movement...today we\u2019re seeing a downwards trend. This is why I think it will continue to trend downwards.",
