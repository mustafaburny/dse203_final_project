        "body": "The situation has changed after the 15% run up. Each day that the market moves +=5%, there is more movement under the surface than we were seeing over an entire month last year. Yesterday's smart entry might offer mediocre immediate value tomorrow.\n\nThat said, here are some examples from last week, before the 15% runup. All of these were actual purchases for a fairly large account looking for smart entries for longer term holds of 1-2 years at minimum (bottom price, current price). Any mention of value is referencing a situation closer to the bottom price than the current price.\n\nBlackstone (37 -&gt; 46): Private equity with a solid foundation was offering value and future growth, with a historical precedent for being a smart buy in such times.\n\nStarbucks (50 -&gt; 66): Quality company at a fairly good price. China recovery play. Bought leading into an analyst day with the assumption that it would soothe the extreme uncertainty and draw in some buyers (bought when VIX was 70+).\n\nCapri Holdings (5.62 -&gt; 11.67): Mispriced equity. Was priced below bankruptcy and/or forced asset sales to larger players. Immediate risk was short term debt, which was refinanced to 2023 two days after entry.\n\nVentas (17 -&gt; 31): Mispriced. Priced at bankruptcy with a 20% dividend at the bottom.  REIT with exposures like healthcare that should be priced as under threat or distressed, not literally at liquidation prices. They reaffirmed dividend a few days after entry and the CEO did some PR.\n\nWelltower (27 -&gt; 50): Mispriced like VTR. Retirement home REIT trading with a 15% dividend yield. Strong strong value under the scenario of trending back to a \"return to normalcy\".\n\nLAM research, KLA Tencor, ASML: All have had a decent bump. EUV silicon lithography transition will not be stopped by the virus. An absolute juggernaut of a market force to buy into and put up against the current crisis.\n\nNokia: 5g buy and hold. Mediocre company at a great price. (Sometimes this can have a place in a portfolio. If everything is bought because of the same factors like \"quality company at a good price\", the portfolio will likely share some outsized exposures that need to be hedged against.)\n\nDiscover Financial Services (25 -&gt; 40): Strong consumer credit exposure. Incredible value otherwise. Once the Fed started stepping up to other asset classes it made sense to buy in. When the Fed announced CC debt could be used as collateral it made sense to go in hard. We saw two back to back 30% rises after buying in, probably because of the timely Fed pump.\n\nSabre (0.50 (yep) -&gt; 6): Has an entrenched position in a lucrative market with a valuable tech infrastructure. Strong possibility for a 1000% return in the next 5-10 years from the $3 buy in, outstripping the bankruptcy possibility.\n\nSo there is a recurring theme that you want to try and step away from possible cliff-faces and step in front of possible positive events. Would CPRI be forced to pay the short term debt at the end of the year, have no cash, not be able to sell off quality intangible assets like Versace, not be able to negotiate with their bank, and not be able to refinance? Possibly, but there was arguably a better possibility that they would find some breathing room and stop the drowning and thus the share price.",

Apparently raw material manufacturers are still no where near operating capacity ([manufacturers as well](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/02/the-rush-to-deploy-robots-in-china-amid-the-coronavirus-outbreak.html)), which some analysts predict will cause shortages in merchandise in the coming months once the \"reserve inventory\" is sold\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI mostly watch tech news, but I'm monitoring AMD, Nvidia, Microsoft and possible some other markets (Sony, Samsung, Nintendo) because it's possible various pieces of hardware will be difficult to obtain.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBig hardware launches (Xbox Series X, PS5, new Nintendo iteration, new phone launches) already decrease the supply and we've already had delays due to manufacturing. I'm not currently investing, but if one of the \"big\" hardware stocks drop significantly, I'll probably buy in. I'm not expecting to see any significant issues until the aforementioned big launches get closer though.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSources:\n\n* [Low inventory levels, price increases](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/coronavirus-update-ram-resistor-prices-effects)\n* [Discusses how US based manufacturers could benefit](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/chip-stocks-catch-brunt-of-tech-decline-but-coronavirus-could-benefit-us-memory-makers-2020-01-27)\n   * [This analyst also predicts US manufacturer gains](https://wccftech.com/micron-upgraded-by-baird-even-amid-dram-nand-demand-disruptions-due-the-coronavirus-epidemic/)\n* [Intel and Dell admit CPU shortages are an issue](https://www.pcworld.com/article/3529969/dell-q4-2019-earnings-call-punts-on-coronavirus-impact-but-confirms-cpu-shortages-still-exist.html)",

Loews (L) is an example of this, to the point where they had a superhero comic strip about it some years ago.\n\n\"Why isn't Zoom being treated as a cyclical stock even though coronavirus is most likely a \"1 cycle\" effect?\"\n\nWhy would people not pile into something that is benefiting from what's going on? The question becomes when it gets ahead of itself and I think with Zoom today, it's starting to feel like people are chasing/piling in late. Teladoc and Everbridge are also up double digit % today.\n\nThe question that I have with Zoom is how many of their (very, very, very) many new free users are going to be converted to paid. I think Zoom does have strong leadership and may continue to be \"top of mind\" when it comes to remote work if they can manage their way through this well, but even if that is the case at some point the stock will probably return to reality once this situation starts to cool off a little and Zoom is sold as a source of funds to buy what hasn't done well. \n\nToday, however, is certainly not that day.",

For like 3 weeks it was spreading unchecked with officials trying to save face. (We, along with Britain and the EU are here) then, there was an explosion of cases that began to overwhelm the system (SK and Italy are getting here) and then it was total lockdown. Still is total lockdown, btw. SK has already locked down some cities and italy I believe is considering it. Not saying we will have total quarantine here stateside, but I wouldn't be shocked if Seattle, LA, or NYC went into partial lockdown. This will most likely be bad for MU",

        "body": "Here are the usual caveats:  I'm just a guy in my bedroom.  I don't have a fancy MBA or work at some prestigious, boutique financial firm.  I'm just a guy trying to day/swing-trade for a living in my humble abode.  Watching the show, *Billions*, back in 2016 is what first piqued my interest.  And I started actively trading at the beginning of 2019.\n\n**One:**  Re hard economic data and China-- It's a country of \\~1.4 billion people.  Because of the one-child policy that lasted for decades, there's also a pretty big M/F gender disparity.  Additionally, in such a top-heavy government, Xi cannot afford to look weak for much longer; his COVID-19 honeymoon is quickly waning, IMHO.  Many big companies are already highly automated anyways.  Those of them that aren't will simply throw human bodies at the assembly lines to meet production quotas again, regardless of the infections.  Remember, there are no human rights in China; it's a communist state.  Either come to work or you're fired and will never work again *anywhere* for the rest of your days.  I recall that scene from Chernobyl where the workers were already so badly radiated that they decided to just keep shoveling the uranium \"for the greater good.\"  In times of crisis, humans lives (esp in communist states) are forfeit and cheap in the mission of the almighty dollar/RMB.  Gotta keep the engine of capitalism humming!  (There is some great irony in this, I know.)\n\n**Two:**  Looking forward, what is the strategic macro picture?  Here's my speculation for several moves ahead on the board:\n\n\\- Meat-space is going to get increasingly more fraught.  I currently live in an apt rental complex and I already see those Amazon Prime vans making multiple trips *a day* delivering stuff to our complex.  Millennials are already reluctant to go outside.  My God, back in my day, going to the mall, getting pizza, and hanging out at the arcade was a thing.  [Nowadays.](https://www.theatlantic.com/notes/2019/05/dead-malls-everywhere/588970/) \n\n\\- The other day I was in line at our local Walmart (when times are good, it's Target and Whole Foods.  When times are like now, it's Walmart and Aldi's) and some guy ahead of me was in line was trying to use multiple gift cards to make a huge purchase.  There was some problem with the register and the whole ordeal took something like ten minutes as the queue grew increasingly long, with everyone inline considerably annoyed.   Yes, there was something like twenty registers, but only three were manned at the time (it was a weekday afternoon).  I mean, seriously, can you blame millennials for not wanting to venture out into meat-space?  It's awful.\n\n\\- So back to now:  What are the implications of COVID-19?  Will it make meat-space more attractive or less?  You do that math.  My feeling is that the Coronavirus will just accelerate what had already been a growing trend:  People doing more commerce from home, people being more entertained at home, etc.  I'm a big follower of a16z and their big claim to fame is *\"Software is Eating the World.\"*  I wholeheartedly believe in that.  This is why I currently have huge positions and am overweight in memory and semiconductors.  I believe in more datacenters, more people going online (according to Andreessen, only half of the global population is currently online.  Vast swathes of South America, Africa, etc are still in the queue), and the basic human way-of-life is fundamentally changing.\n\n**Also:**  I do believe we'll eventually figure out crypto.  And that translates into (my belief, anyway) a big/bright future for semis and memory.  Long AMD and MU!",

        "body": "Here are the usual caveats:  I'm just a guy in my bedroom.  I don't have a fancy MBA or work at some prestigious, boutique financial firm.  I'm just a guy trying to day/swing-trade for a living in my humble abode.  Watching the show, *Billions*, back in 2016 is what first piqued my interest.  And I started actively trading at the beginning of 2019.\n\n**One:**  Re hard economic data and China-- It's a country of \\~1.4 billion people.  Because of the one-child policy that lasted for decades, there's also a pretty big M/F gender disparity.  Additionally, in such a top-heavy government, Xi cannot afford to look weak for much longer; his COVID-19 honeymoon is quickly waning, IMHO.  Many big companies are already highly automated anyways.  Those of them that aren't will simply throw human bodies at the assembly lines to meet production quotas again, regardless of the infections.  Remember, there are no human rights in China; it's a communist state.  Either come to work or you're fired and will never work again *anywhere* for the rest of your days.  I recall that scene from Chernobyl where the workers were already so badly radiated that they decided to just keep shoveling the uranium \"for the greater good.\"  In times of crisis, humans lives (esp in communist states) are forfeit and cheap in the mission of the almighty dollar/RMB.  Gotta keep the engine of capitalism humming!  (There is some great irony in this, I know.)\n\n**Two:**  Looking forward, what is the strategic macro picture?  Here's my speculation for several moves ahead on the board:\n\n\\- Meat-space is going to get increasingly more fraught.  I currently live in an apt rental complex and I already see those Amazon Prime vans making multiple trips *a day* delivering stuff to our complex.  Millennials are already reluctant to go outside.  My God, back in my day, going to the mall, getting pizza, and hanging out at the arcade was a thing.  [Nowadays.](https://www.theatlantic.com/notes/2019/05/dead-malls-everywhere/588970/) \n\n\\- The other day I was in line at our local Walmart (when times are good, it's Target and Whole Foods.  When times are like now, it's Walmart and Aldi's) and some guy ahead of me was in line was trying to use multiple gift cards to make a huge purchase.  There was some problem with the register and the whole ordeal took something like ten minutes as the queue grew increasingly long, with everyone inline considerably annoyed.   Yes, there was something like twenty registers, but only three were manned at the time (it was a weekday afternoon).  I mean, seriously, can you blame millennials for not wanting to venture out into meat-space?  It's awful.\n\n\\- So back to now:  What are the implications of COVID-19?  Will it make meat-space more attractive or less?  You do that math.  My feeling is that the Coronavirus will just accelerate what had already been a growing trend:  People doing more commerce from home, people being more entertained at home, etc.  I'm a big follower of a16z and their big claim to fame is *\"Software is Eating the World.\"*  I wholeheartedly believe in that.  This is why I currently have huge positions and am overweight in memory and semiconductors.  I believe in more datacenters, more people going online (according to Andreessen, only half of the global population is currently online.  Vast swathes of South America, Africa, etc are still in the queue), and the basic human way-of-life is fundamentally changing.\n\n**Also:**  I do believe we'll eventually figure out crypto.  And that translates into (my belief, anyway) a big/bright future for semis and memory.  Long AMD and MU!",

I'd wager that 4/5 of the posts that you're complaining about don't even see the light of day. Which should impress and terrify you.\n* It's difficult trying to strike a balance. The public attention has brought a lot of legitimate traders here who just want to share their experience, real DD, technical analysis, etc and we want to encourage that. They obviously make new accounts and we want them to contribute immediately.\n* We're tweaking things everyday in response to rapidly changing growth and news that swings the entire sub in a matter of hours (like our pumping problem last week). This weeked now everyone is talking about their local Costco, committing bioterroism, and killing the pope. Also, please calm the fuck down with killing the pope, guys. It's borderline enciting violence, I've temp banned a few people who take it wayyyy too far.\n* Our sexuality aside, we're volunteers from around the world. Our hours and availability differ, so there are mod lulls where a lot of one liner shitposts get through. We do our best, but we really focus on providing the best experience we can for you guys during trading hours when the engagement here is through the roof.\n* As far as you or others wanting to volunteer, you guys actually do a pretty good job en mass with downvoting and reporting bullshit. Keep it up. We appreciate that.\n\nThat's all I got at the moment. Hope it gives you some kind of something.",

        "body": "since no ones helped you out\n\noptions are contracts entered into by you and someone else (a counter party). There's 2 types of options, puts and calls. If you look at OP's picture you'll see that one of his \"trades\" is for SQQQ $29 CALL 3/20.\n\nSo he wants to buy a call. Now, like I said this call is a contract between OP and someone else. This contract states that at anytime between the day that OP purchases the call contract and the expiration date of the contract, stated as 3/20/2020. OP has the 'option' or choice to buy 100 shares of the etf SQQQ from the counter party of the contract for $29 regardless of what the actual price of the ETF is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo theoretically, if on 3/15 SQQQ is trading at $50 a share, OP can exercise his option and buy those 100 shares for $29 dollars from the counter party and sell those shares immediately in the open market for $50. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe downside is that OP has to pay the counter party a 'premium' in order to have this option. Right now the premium has a bid/ask of $2.65 x 2.95. So if OP wants to buy the call he has to pay $2.95 x 100 (per share, remember the call gives op the right to buy 100 shares from the counter party). Now, you may be asking, why is the spread so wide? Wouldn't OP immediately lose $30 or 10% on his trade? Is OP gambling with probably zero actual insight on investing? I'll let you figure those out on your own.",

Family couldn't come in because they were quarantined and our unit is isolated bc of being a covid unit and so I went into his iso room so he wouldn't die alone. \n\nI stood there as I put him on comfort measures and watched him die in front of me and almost broke down. It's been so depressing watching these intensive care covid patients die one after the other. No one has survived intubation yet. I understand Italy. It's depressing. \n\nYeah it's cool making money. I've doubled my yearly resident salary in two weeks. But my heart is fucking broken and crying out to these people and their families and we're trying so hard to find a cure that I would literally undo those trades in a second to even save one of them. Just one. \n\nThis will get lost in the wsb thread, I know. Just needed to share.  But it's been a hard day and I'm up again in 5 hours for another 18 hour day watching people die and trying new therapies. Wsb makes me smile on my few min that I take for myself during the day.

Get it done in federal - disability money garnished at 25% for 10 years, then debt forgiven and IRS taxes the forgiven amount. Possibly garnished a lot more as I def don't need $15k/mo to maintain my lifestyle. Gonna need a super lawyer to keep it in state as I stayed in CA the entire time, opened the account in CA, and TDA has state presence by having physical retail buildings so are bound to state creditor laws. \n\n# TL;DR\nMay be paying a lawyer 100k-1m to not owe 1m to keep it in state court, lol.

They don't even need to have one every day. They could just have it every other day and give important updates, take a few questions, and be done\n\nSecond, the longer he talked today the worse it got. It's like he was just rambling on, and eventually as he kept getting asked more and more stuff, he just started either repeating things, or coming up with something dumb to say\n\nThird, I've watched every press conference, and half the stuff he was saying came straight out of left field. What happened to his serious tone of we are going to do what it takes and pull together and get through this? Now all of a sudden he acts like it's over, when we haven't even gotten into the worst part of it here. Like where the fuck did this come from?\n\nI agree the economy is important and we can't just let it tank bc of this virus, but we are not going to be ready to open back up in 1 week. We need at least 2-3 more weeks, and probably a month before we are ready to slowly start lifting restrictions in specific areas. He shouldn't be saying shit like we are going to open up next week, because he doesn't know that. He should have just said that in a week they would evaluate where we are. But they should do that every day. He shouldn't be expecting us to open up in a week, and he definitely shouldn't be telling the American people that we might. He's putting it in people's heads that we are almost through this, and this is the worst possible time for him to say that. Now is the most crucial time for us to be cracking down and stopping the spread. People need to take it seriously right now so that it isn't a problem later, and it's like he doesn't understand that.",

        "body": "Many industries will see a decline in demand (thinking especially in service, experience, and overall discretionary sectors), but let me use a more circular example for clarity. If you consider food-service: clearly social-distancing will likely result in decreased spending in restaurants, so what do restaurants do when facing declining revenues? Tell their workers not to come in or lay them off entirely. These workers are no longer collecting a pay check and therefore see no benefit from a payroll tax cut. They are not collecting more in after-tax income and do not have more money to put out into the economy as a result. That\u2019s the inherent issue of PTC as it does not aid in those who will no longer be collecting an income as a result of COVID-19. As testing ramps up and new cases are identified, panic will heighten and people will take more extreme measures to avoid interaction. Sure, your local grocer may see an acute bump in sales, but the broader economy will have declining consumer demand.",
