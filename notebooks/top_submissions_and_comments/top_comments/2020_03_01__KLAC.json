        "body": "The situation has changed after the 15% run up. Each day that the market moves +=5%, there is more movement under the surface than we were seeing over an entire month last year. Yesterday's smart entry might offer mediocre immediate value tomorrow.\n\nThat said, here are some examples from last week, before the 15% runup. All of these were actual purchases for a fairly large account looking for smart entries for longer term holds of 1-2 years at minimum (bottom price, current price). Any mention of value is referencing a situation closer to the bottom price than the current price.\n\nBlackstone (37 -&gt; 46): Private equity with a solid foundation was offering value and future growth, with a historical precedent for being a smart buy in such times.\n\nStarbucks (50 -&gt; 66): Quality company at a fairly good price. China recovery play. Bought leading into an analyst day with the assumption that it would soothe the extreme uncertainty and draw in some buyers (bought when VIX was 70+).\n\nCapri Holdings (5.62 -&gt; 11.67): Mispriced equity. Was priced below bankruptcy and/or forced asset sales to larger players. Immediate risk was short term debt, which was refinanced to 2023 two days after entry.\n\nVentas (17 -&gt; 31): Mispriced. Priced at bankruptcy with a 20% dividend at the bottom.  REIT with exposures like healthcare that should be priced as under threat or distressed, not literally at liquidation prices. They reaffirmed dividend a few days after entry and the CEO did some PR.\n\nWelltower (27 -&gt; 50): Mispriced like VTR. Retirement home REIT trading with a 15% dividend yield. Strong strong value under the scenario of trending back to a \"return to normalcy\".\n\nLAM research, KLA Tencor, ASML: All have had a decent bump. EUV silicon lithography transition will not be stopped by the virus. An absolute juggernaut of a market force to buy into and put up against the current crisis.\n\nNokia: 5g buy and hold. Mediocre company at a great price. (Sometimes this can have a place in a portfolio. If everything is bought because of the same factors like \"quality company at a good price\", the portfolio will likely share some outsized exposures that need to be hedged against.)\n\nDiscover Financial Services (25 -&gt; 40): Strong consumer credit exposure. Incredible value otherwise. Once the Fed started stepping up to other asset classes it made sense to buy in. When the Fed announced CC debt could be used as collateral it made sense to go in hard. We saw two back to back 30% rises after buying in, probably because of the timely Fed pump.\n\nSabre (0.50 (yep) -&gt; 6): Has an entrenched position in a lucrative market with a valuable tech infrastructure. Strong possibility for a 1000% return in the next 5-10 years from the $3 buy in, outstripping the bankruptcy possibility.\n\nSo there is a recurring theme that you want to try and step away from possible cliff-faces and step in front of possible positive events. Would CPRI be forced to pay the short term debt at the end of the year, have no cash, not be able to sell off quality intangible assets like Versace, not be able to negotiate with their bank, and not be able to refinance? Possibly, but there was arguably a better possibility that they would find some breathing room and stop the drowning and thus the share price.",

Now that the virus is just ramping up in the US and parts of Europe, the demand side of the economy is going to suffer.Any companies or industries that were struggling, slowing, or on the verge of being insolvent are going to crash.\n\nThe virus' impact could be much greater in the US too. Americans suffer from an over-sized sense of independence/self-reliance which will result in a less unified response and likely allow the virus to spread further because the citizens won't allow their liberties to be infringed. Add to that a working class that has tons of debt and cant afford to take days off work and you've got yourself a nice recipe for disaster.\n\nFactor in all the other economic data and it's hard to see how this isn't headed for a cliff.\n\nTL;DR SPY 290P 5/15",

        "body": " \n\nDebt Threat: Corporate debt is at a record level of $10 Trillion. AAPL has a Debt-to-Equity Ratio of 1.21, and that was reported before the market took a crap. Over half of \"investment quality\" bonds are now rated BBB, the the lowest investment grade rating available. Corporate cash holdings have dropped to $1.69 Trillion. The US Debt-to-GDP Ratio is 107% .\n\nConsumer Debt is at a record high of $13.95 trillion. Meanwhile, the Prime Age (working age) Employment Ratio has not returned to pre-recession levels. If you look at personal savings rate by income quintile, only the top 20% are saving more than 4%. the bottom 60% aren't saving anything at all. this is largely because the majority of income growth has been in the top 20%. Even the average including the top 20% is only 8%, still historically low.\n\nThe equity market cap-to-GDP ratio is at an all-time high, above 200%. The Price-to-Earnings-Growth Ratio (PEG) is at it's highest ever.\n\nIn other words, spending and prices have become decouples from actual productivity and earnings. With high debt, low savings, and low credit ratings, both consumers and corporations face default if they have a minor hiccup in revenue.\n\nNote: These numbers rely on the best available data, based on large numbers of tests, available from the WHO and academic sources. they could change as more information comes in from other countries.\n\nDisease threat: In China, the In China, the overall CFR for COVID-19 was 17.3% for cases before they improved standards of care (access to sophisticated medical equipment and trained personal); it then dropped to 0.7%. The much heard 2.3% Case Fatality Rate is an average between these two. This explains the variance in CFR, and why countries such as South Korea, which had preparation and foreknowledge, have a lower CFR.\n\nThe disease has a 1 to 14 day incubation rate. This explains the variance in apparent asymptomatic rates (diseases in incubation appear asymptomatic). Hundred of thousands of tests have been conducted in South Korea; the WHO reported that China produced millions of tests. Some cases, such as the first Italy, have shown several weeks of no symptoms before becoming severely ill. This makes it difficult to control the spread.\n\nThe data from both China &amp; South Korea seem to support that about 80.9% of cases are mild, 13.8% of cases become severe, and 4.7% become critical. The remaining 0.6% may be asymptomatic. The sum of severe &amp; critical cases is 18.5\u202c%, close to the 17.3% early CFR in China, suggesting that those people would die without significant supportive care. This care includes: oxygen production and breathing apparatus to support respiratory failure, IVs &amp; vasopressor medication to support septic shock, and dialysis to support kidney failure. The median time to recover is 3-6 weeks for patients with severe or critical disease.\n\nThis suggests that about 20% of those infected will need about 4.5 weeks of intensive care. The hospitalization rate for the flu is only 1%.\n\nThe overall CFR rate (including all ages and comorbidity statuses) for seasonal flu is about 0.1%. The CFR for COVID-19 ranges from 0.2% for peole in their 20s &amp; 30s, 0.4% for people in their 40s, 1.3% for people in their 50s, 3.6% for people in their 60s, 8.0% for people in their 70s, to 14.8% for people over 80.\n\nCFRs vary by comorbidity. For those with no comorbidity (otherwise in good health), the CFR is 0.9%. Remember that the flu is only 0.1% overall, which lumps in those with comorbidities. Those with diabetes have a CFR of 7.3%, those with hypertension have a CFR of 6.0%, those cardiovascular disease have a CFR of 10.5%.\n\nSo, the fatality of the disease ranges from twice as deadly as the overall rate for flu for the healthiest people, to 148 times as deadly as the overall rate for those over 70. It's significantly more likely to result in hospitalization, and that hospitalization will be longer.\n\nThe disease appears to have an R0 of about 2.5 without \"intense quarantine and social distancing measures\". most epidemiologists, and other relevant experts, don't think the world could maintain for the 6 months to a year necessary to develop a vaccine. Current estimates by epidemiologists range from 20% to 70% of adults being infected within a year, depending on control measures. Washington State Department of Health officials stated that they expect to see more cases of COVID-19 in the coming months than cases of flu.\n\nQuarantine and Control Measures Impact: If we want to prevent that millions of people being infected thing from happening, we could do this. The effect on productivity and demand would be tremendous. Additionally, transaction costs go way up; it's difficult to conduct business when you're in different quarantine zones. Their are also multiple legal and political hurdles.\n\nDisease Impact: 20% hospitalization of 20% infected of 209.1 Million adults in the US is 8.4 Million needing about 4 weeks of intensive care. 20% hospitalization of 70% infected of 209.1 Million adults in the US is about 29.3 million people requiring about 4 weeks of intensive care.\n\nA 1% fatality rate of 20% infected adults is 289,940 dead in the US. A 2% fatality rate of 70% infected adults is 2,927,400\u202c dead in the US.\n\nNormal annual fatalities in the US are 2.8 Million. These death amount to between a 10.4% increase and 104.6% increase in deaths for the year.\n\nIf we choose to control it, the control measures will directly impact production and reduce demand in an immediate fashion.\n\nIf we allow the disease to run rampant, and it actually does, the deaths and hospitalizations will pose significant disruptions; massive resource will be allocated to medical requirements, people will take time off work to care for their family members or stay in hospital, deaths will result in a significant increase in empty housing, municipal property taxes will decline (increasing the likelihood of default on municipal bonds), assets such as stocks &amp; bonds will pour into the market either because the owner is dead or they need to pay for medical expenses.\n\nWith high debt and low savings, consumers and corporations are ill prepared to endure such an impact to production and revenue. Since we are close to full employment, have such high valuations compared to production, and have a high level of government debt already, we are primed for inflation if the government decides to print money to save these entities. In a worst case scenario, the government's credit laying could lower, and t-bonds would be dumped on the market.\n\nHowever, these are all just possibilities. the chance of the worst case scenarios happening is still low; it could be contained in relatively small areas. The full potential threat may not become apparent to the non-epidemiologist for six months or so, when we have significantly more cases and their impact is directly visible. Actions such as the additional rate cuts could raise prices in the meantime.\n\nPossible high risk long play: INGN is down to $ 47.67 from $67.59 about 8 weeks ago. They produce lightweight portable oxygen concentrators. They could have an increase in demand of orders of magnitude, in a market with a high barrier of entry (FDA regs, IP, expertise). However, they could face supply chain problems.",

However, since this is mainly federal stuff, I still think most courts will defer to FINRA.\n\nThe main strategy would be to file in court and then immediately leverage settlement before the judge rules on dismissal. Settlement for each individual case would be low and so would be the bargaining power of the potential plaintiff. You\u2019d want to consolidate all actions into a class. The problem with this is it takes time and then you\u2019ll have fights over class cert. that can move the settlement needle back and forth.",

I'd wager that 4/5 of the posts that you're complaining about don't even see the light of day. Which should impress and terrify you.\n* It's difficult trying to strike a balance. The public attention has brought a lot of legitimate traders here who just want to share their experience, real DD, technical analysis, etc and we want to encourage that. They obviously make new accounts and we want them to contribute immediately.\n* We're tweaking things everyday in response to rapidly changing growth and news that swings the entire sub in a matter of hours (like our pumping problem last week). This weeked now everyone is talking about their local Costco, committing bioterroism, and killing the pope. Also, please calm the fuck down with killing the pope, guys. It's borderline enciting violence, I've temp banned a few people who take it wayyyy too far.\n* Our sexuality aside, we're volunteers from around the world. Our hours and availability differ, so there are mod lulls where a lot of one liner shitposts get through. We do our best, but we really focus on providing the best experience we can for you guys during trading hours when the engagement here is through the roof.\n* As far as you or others wanting to volunteer, you guys actually do a pretty good job en mass with downvoting and reporting bullshit.

        "body": "since no ones helped you out\n\noptions are contracts entered into by you and someone else (a counter party). There's 2 types of options, puts and calls. If you look at OP's picture you'll see that one of his \"trades\" is for SQQQ $29 CALL 3/20.\n\nSo he wants to buy a call. Now, like I said this call is a contract between OP and someone else. This contract states that at anytime between the day that OP purchases the call contract and the expiration date of the contract, stated as 3/20/2020. OP has the 'option' or choice to buy 100 shares of the etf SQQQ from the counter party of the contract for $29 regardless of what the actual price of the ETF is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo theoretically, if on 3/15 SQQQ is trading at $50 a share, OP can exercise his option and buy those 100 shares for $29 dollars from the counter party and sell those shares immediately in the open market for $50. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe downside is that OP has to pay the counter party a 'premium' in order to have this option. Right now the premium has a bid/ask of $2.65 x 2.95. So if OP wants to buy the call he has to pay $2.95 x 100 (per share, remember the call gives op the right to buy 100 shares from the counter party). Now, you may be asking, why is the spread so wide? Wouldn't OP immediately lose $30 or 10% on his trade? Is OP gambling with probably zero actual insight on investing? I'll let you figure those out on your own.",
