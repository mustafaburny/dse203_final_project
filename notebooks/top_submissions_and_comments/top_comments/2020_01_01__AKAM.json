Their enterprise products tell a different story... slightly. \n\nIntel royally fucked things this year with numerous security/manufacturing/shittly made enterprise chips. They\u2019re 3x the cost of AMD and can\u2019t compete with threading.\n\nAMD, however, is back from Intel\u2019s shadow(again). They\u2019re safer, better threading, faster, less overhead, and cheaper. A maxed out Intel powered management server from Dell is like $25k compared to the same Dell with AMD; $16k.\n\nLook at tech companies that specialize in global architecture/networking/edge cache; e.x. Akamai, etc. expect them to move from intel to AMD as the year goes on and hardware is updated. eBay will end up with a bunch of Dell EMC servers filled with Intel chips. \n\nI definitely think that Intel will get their shit together. The two go back and forth every couple years (I\u2019m looking at you Bulldozer/i7). Right now, though, AMD is a pretty safe long. \n\nTL;DR:\nLook at their enterprise business. They do good. Good chips. UTZ+",

I use a stock screener and nothing on there is very interesting. Usually by the time I sell one stock another one comes up that looks promising. But not lately. I think everything is just over valued right now. I'll buy something soon as I see a good company show up on my screener.",
