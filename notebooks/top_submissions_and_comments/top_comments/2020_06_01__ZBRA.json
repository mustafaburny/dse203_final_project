        "body": "Thank you for your reply mate!\n\nI picked them up both from Couch Potato. I thought it would vary my portfolio while benefiting from a seemingly safe investment.\n\nMy goal right now is not very defined but I have savings sitting around and would like to make them grow. My \u201ccareer\u201d is not going well and I\u2019m looking at ways to make money on the long run without relying too much on my degree. I plan for long term (10+ years) but I would like to enjoy some gains before that if I make a substantial gain.\n\nI picked mostly Canadian stocks as I trade on Wealthsimple and would prefer to avoid extra fees.\n\nI have 20% \u201cemergency fund\u201d on Wealthsimple on auto trade to which I contribute every pay check.\n\nI picked the banks because the charts tell me they\u2019ve been steadily going up for the past few years.\n\nZBRA because I was told to find good stocks, I should look at the things I use and know is good. We use those Zebra scanners at my job and they are really well made and super expensive too so I thought it might be good. Looked at the chart and the price keeps going up lately so I figured it was a good idea overall!\n\nAC because it seems low right now and I think once planes are back up in full force, Air Canada will have a lot to gain.\n\nAs you can tell, I\u2019m a big big noob but I really need to start right now as accumulating more info before I start will keep me paralyzed forever! I\u2019ve already missed the big crash in March and probably a lot more these last 2-3 years!",
