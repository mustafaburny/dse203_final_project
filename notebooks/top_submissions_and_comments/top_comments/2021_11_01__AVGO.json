One is managed by Edward Jones and the other I take care of myself. Both accounts were initially funded about 2.5 years ago. Edward Jones with 70k from an inheritance and Fidelity with about 59k that I received after having to medically retire from the Fire Department I worked for (open heart surgery as a result of hypertension all my life, take your meds people). I also receive 5k plus a month from a tax free annuity as a result of my injury. This also increases yearly with cost of living raises of 3 percent. I also receive a small amount per month as a veteran and being diagnosed with hypertension while serving. Please skewer my portfolios, I know they are not balanced.

These particular mutations are of a major concern because they likely (A) increase the virus's ability to evade vaccine and (B) increase transmissibiliy.\r  \n\r  \nThe belief is that these mutations ALL HAPPENED IN ONE HOST (which is nuts and scary but fucking Zoonotic diseases mutate faster than rabbits fuck so this shit is gonna happen). Covid in the past has shown strange mutogenic acceleration in AIDS patients, and they're thinking this Nu variant attained all of its mutations at once in an undiagnosed AIDS patient (which btw if there was any doubt left about Covid being a blood-borne illness....).\r  \n\r  \nDelta has been saving our asses for awhile but Nu may be an actual competitor. Delta spread from India to the entire planet in 2 weeks. The delta variant of covid is likely the most transmissible illness ever.\r  \n\r  \nIt is so transmissible that variant Mu and Lambda (for example) which had elevated mortality couldn't out-compete Delta to be the dominant strain. If you're vaxxed, Delta is pretty survivable. So its been keeping some of these other variants at bay for awhile.\r  \n\r  \nGiven the immediate market/medical community/travel responses to Nu, I'd say this variant has the best chance of overcoming delta in the coming weeks. The number of mutations are truly scary.\r  \n\r  \nThings to watch for to know if we're pretty fucked:\r  \n\r  \nHow fast is it? If three weeks go by and Nu doesn't yet have large numbers in the US and Europe, we may be good because Delta can still more easily find hosts. Given the number of mutations to the spike protein alone, I this might be a long shot at this point. But if 3 weeks go by and you haven't heard much about this, we may be gtg.\r  \n\r  \nHow are vaxxed people affected? If the spike proteins are different enough, Nu could bypass vaccination and infect vaccinated (and maybe even boosted people).\r  \n\r  \nIf neither of these things look ominous, terrific. But if the Nu variant is fast and bypasses immune responses coached by vaccines, the worst days of the pandemic may be coming this winter.\r  \n\r  \nI should probably put some cites on this shit but I'm lazy. Just google it, everything I wrote is correct.",

        "body": "Great article! Nvidia's sales have shown the sector to be far more resilient to rising costs and prices than anticipated, I think even surprising management themselves if the 10% hike in share price was anything to go off of. \n\nFull disclosure: I have the entirety of my retirement portfolio vested in ASML &amp; SOXX. \n\nA huge concern is government investment which has been put into consideration greatly by many of the giants such as ASML and TSMC, who would both benefit greatly from the supposed $50 Billion investment from Uncle Sam. Other nations around the world are looking to achieve tech sovereignty and are putting forth big bucks to make this happen, all of which will help offset the cost of production and manufacturing. ASML has a few slides about this in their investor presentation, but a really in-depth macro report was done by the Boston Consulting Group with the Semiconductor Industry Association - [you can read it all here](https://www.semiconductors.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/BCG-x-SIA-Strengthening-the-Global-Semiconductor-Value-Chain-April-2021_1.pdf). \n\nAnother driver that will lower the impact of the rising costs is the semiconductor space race going on between all the massive names. There are record levels of private sector investments from the likes of Intel, Micron, Texas Instruments, etc in an effort to grab market share and secure deals as the consumer facing conglomerates such as Apple begin to consolidate their supply chain. Nvidia is wrangling with the ARM deal, and TSMC has been tasked with supplying Apple's next generation of chips, which is an insane feat given what was showed off in the new series of Macbooks. Intel is under new management and is fighting tooth and nail to get back in the race and into Apple's good graces. All of these events fit into the broader picture of the race to 3nm - 2nm chips as we close in on the twilight years of Moore's Law. \n\nPerhaps I am overly optimistic right now, but there is a great deal to look forward to in the coming years from the semiconductor space. Maybe it won't be all sunshine and flowers, but overall the industry is certainly in an upward trajectory with more attention than ever before. I look forward to seeing how the market reacts to these developments as they mature.",

I had originally bought 100 MU $80 calls on Thursday before close for 5,000 when I saw the random big green bars beginning on it. But I already had cash spread out in too many positions so I halved it and sold 50 calls. I sold the 50 calls first thing in the morning when MU was at 80 when I saw the 200%. If I held all 100 to closing on Friday, it would have been 5000 to 30,000 gain.\n\nThen there's SHOP, I also sold this during the morning pump. If I stayed for this one, I would have lost in the end as SHOP sank towards the end of the day. \n\nSo even with missed gains, it's always better to book profit because you really never know what will happen!",

You tell me how probable it is that they're undervalued.\n\nIt's much more likely to find mispriced companies if you look where fewer people are looking, e.g. in small/micro caps, foreign markets etc. Why do you think Mohnish Pabrai, one of the most relevant current value investors, isn't invested in any of these, but instead has the vast majority of his holdings (aside from Micron) in obscure foreign small caps?",

When the actual statement he made was that it would help to fix the growth in world hunger issues we\u2019ve seen recently, not that it would solve hunger entirely. He very specifically mentions that this is a one time donation that would help 42 million people that need immediate aid, but that wouldn\u2019t be a long term fix. Even the CNN article itself now has a correction at the very bottom acknowledging this was a misleading title. \n\nObviously this is all an over simplification of the issue and you can\u2019t just throw money at it to fix it, but the point he was trying to make wasn\u2019t that one donation from one billionaire would permanently solve all hunger but that a one time donation from MULTIPLE of the world\u2019s wealthiest individuals would help save a lot of people in the short term.

My odds of it happening increase on every pump giving the fact the next stock Tesla would overcome is actually Amazon, then Google. This is not a small market cap stock with unlimited upside, it's running out of room in my opinion. Although it is possible for Tesla to temporarily surpass these companies because of how irrational the market is. (True valuation clearly doesn't matter here) the point here is, its current price may be fair for Tesla but in the future. Not now, the bulls got too greedy too soon.  The argument that Tesla is should not be worth more than companies like Amazon and Google is strong, of course, those companies will grow in value as well where things fall back into a reasonable line.  But, it goes back to square one, too high, too fast, too soon. None of the bull's arguments defend Tesla during a harsh red week or month in the market, worse a crash. We all know based on history Tesla would be the first to go.   \n\n\nDon't get me wrong. I strongly believe Tesla deserves a high valuation. I am all for a $1 Trillion even upwards of a $3 trillion market cap, but all with given time. Too fast, too high, too soon. The cult-like following on Tesla is built of money craving impatient newbs, which a good amount of run away at first sight of a change or new hype. Panic, profit takers. During that time, when it comes, id like to have my turn in making a profit. I rather bet on a dip with such high numbers than bet on an even further run. Then again, even if it goes up we go back to square one, I increase my odds averaging up.  This is a shorter-term strategy, not a Perma bear case.",

Everybody that matters in the market knows what it is, and they all knew it was going to pass the house. Remember, it had strong support by both parties in the senate months ago when it was passed. People have mentioned buying related ETFs (I.e PAVE) and construction companies (like CAT) for that entire time for this reason. Basically, it\u2019s priced in.\n\n2. Besides allowing for news,  speculation and possibly improved forward guidance (all priced in imo) this bill isn\u2019t going to make these companies more valuable overnight. It will take a long time for them to get these projects/money, and even longer for them to report their financial improvements from this, which does have an impact on stock prices. Even then, this is probably priced in.\n\nI hesitate to say this is 100% priced in right now because there are probably retail traders buying in, but the term \u201csell the news\u201d exists for a reason. In general, retail traders tend to buy the top and sell at the bottom, and this event will (probably not) be an exception.",

And I don't mean the namby-pamby 20% capital gains tax, these are going to be paid as if they were earned income.\n\nSo to deal with that his choice is either to take out a huge loan for all of the tax value and the cost to exercise.\n\nOr sell some of his existing stock, pay the much smaller capital gains on it, and use the money freed up there to exercise the options and pay the income tax.\n\nBeyond those two likely options the only third option would be to not exercise the options and let them expire worthless.\n\nThis tweet is all about framing the decision for public perception. He's already made up his mind and run the numbers.",

When the actual statement he made was that it would help to fix the growth in world hunger issues we\u2019ve seen recently, not that it would solve hunger entirely. He very specifically mentions that this is a one time donation that would help 42 million people that need immediate aid, but that wouldn\u2019t be a long term fix. Even the CNN article itself now has a correction at the very bottom acknowledging this was a misleading title. \n\nObviously this is all an over simplification of the issue and you can\u2019t just throw money at it to fix it, but the point he was trying to make wasn\u2019t that one donation from one billionaire would permanently solve all hunger but that a one time donation from MULTIPLE of the world\u2019s wealthiest individuals would help save a lot of people in the short term.

My odds of it happening increase on every pump giving the fact the next stock Tesla would overcome is actually Amazon, then Google. This is not a small market cap stock with unlimited upside, it's running out of room in my opinion. Although it is possible for Tesla to temporarily surpass these companies because of how irrational the market is. (True valuation clearly doesn't matter here) the point here is, its current price may be fair for Tesla but in the future. Not now, the bulls got too greedy too soon.  The argument that Tesla is should not be worth more than companies like Amazon and Google is strong, of course, those companies will grow in value as well where things fall back into a reasonable line.  But, it goes back to square one, too high, too fast, too soon. None of the bull's arguments defend Tesla during a harsh red week or month in the market, worse a crash. We all know based on history Tesla would be the first to go.   \n\n\nDon't get me wrong. I strongly believe Tesla deserves a high valuation. I am all for a $1 Trillion even upwards of a $3 trillion market cap, but all with given time. Too fast, too high, too soon. The cult-like following on Tesla is built of money craving impatient newbs, which a good amount of run away at first sight of a change or new hype. Panic, profit takers. During that time, when it comes, id like to have my turn in making a profit. I rather bet on a dip with such high numbers than bet on an even further run. Then again, even if it goes up we go back to square one, I increase my odds averaging up.  This is a shorter-term strategy, not a Perma bear case.",

Everybody that matters in the market knows what it is, and they all knew it was going to pass the house. Remember, it had strong support by both parties in the senate months ago when it was passed. People have mentioned buying related ETFs (I.e PAVE) and construction companies (like CAT) for that entire time for this reason. Basically, it\u2019s priced in.\n\n2. Besides allowing for news,  speculation and possibly improved forward guidance (all priced in imo) this bill isn\u2019t going to make these companies more valuable overnight. It will take a long time for them to get these projects/money, and even longer for them to report their financial improvements from this, which does have an impact on stock prices. Even then, this is probably priced in.\n\nI hesitate to say this is 100% priced in right now because there are probably retail traders buying in, but the term \u201csell the news\u201d exists for a reason. In general, retail traders tend to buy the top and sell at the bottom, and this event will (probably not) be an exception.",

So you can sell it and take what the contract is worth right now. Or exercise it. Exercising means you'll be purchasing 100 shares at the strike price of which you bought the option for, you pay per share the strike price. So you bought .03 cent option strike price. You pay .03 cents for each share of 100. You then own 100 share of Said company, this is for going long on a company. There's much to option but it really isn't that hard to understand once you begin learning and understanding. Cause when you purchase a option contract your buying the \"rights\" to 100 shares of said company. Options are a tricky game but is a good game when played strongly. If you knew a stock was going up and you purchased many calls you can profit more for calls than buying said stock. Puts are like shorting, when you expect a stock to go down.

You can learn massive amounts and the only risk is money.\n\nFor those of us who are older the risk begins to include cars, home, feeding family, stable marriage etc. The smart of us work to isolate that risk to what we can afford to lose and still operate normally. Take your big risks now while it only has minor impact. It will give your pops opportunity to mentor you too.\n\nLots of words to say YOLO on young autist. There is much to learn.",
