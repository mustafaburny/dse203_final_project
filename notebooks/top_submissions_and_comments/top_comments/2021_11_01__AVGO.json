        "body": "\nThis is a list of the top 20 companies that experienced the largest change in insider shares in the last seven (7) days.\nThe SEC defines an insider as any officer, director or 10% shareholder. It is not illegal for these people to buy or sell their own shares.\nIn fact, since most of them get paid in stock options, it is expected. However, it is illegal for them to trade on inside information\nthat has not been made public. So for example if there are drug trial results that are bad and not public,\ninsiders cannot dump shares. That said, many people have observed that insiders - in general - seem to have a good\ntrack record at timing their purchases.  All trades that are marked as part of a 10b5 plan are excluded from this report.\n\n## Largest Insider Buying (Last 7 Days)\nCompany|Count|Shares Changed|Avg.

Switched to spreads and thought of doing PUt credit spreads and iron condors. Took positions in GPN, CAR thinking they were the safest play ( what could go wrong with AVIS). Oh well ran up 300% the day after earnings. Last week took apple bear credit spread and guess what , ALL TIME HIGH :) so not sure if anything wrong with my trading or just bad luck ! \n\nAre you still doing spreads ?",

I was blown away that Zuck did not even once mention it. they are basically making a more modern version of this, and they are going to try to shove their oculus to everyone's face. \n\nThe value proposition is valid, it is that 3d gaming is the future of social chatter. \n\nThe VR push  however is going  to be a major flop. No amount of high tech is going to change the fact that a blindfold is not something you want to wear for long. Also, Facebook sells attention, and AR is the opposite of attention, it's distraction. \n\nUnity will benefit enormously from this,  but mobile gaming will lose a lot of momentum for a long time. \n\nHere is what people buy in second life: Avatars, avatar skins, avatar clothes, penises, vaginas, sexy clothes, even more sexy clothes. Basically take the most superficial and vain doll-dressing app and pump it up by 10 times or so, that's the future. No, it won't be the hub for tech and work and education and research, it will be as vapid and vain as facebook and instagram are now. \n\nFacebook will probably push its own, controlled and censored \"crypto\" to people. This will be their most controversial move,  but maybe their lobbyists are already in agreement with US govt. This is about ensuring that the next global payments system is controlled by the US govt.",
