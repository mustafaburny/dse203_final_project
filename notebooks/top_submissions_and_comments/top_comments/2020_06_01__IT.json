So what\u2019s the point of selling right now if your actually investing for years, decades? None. Especially when it\u2019s super easy to get a loan for rock bottom rates, cash is very accessible for all the big boy investors and institutions. \n\nEveryone constantly downvoted bulls in March for even thinking that a V shape market recovery was gonna happen, for ever thinking we were gonna see ATHs again this year. Don\u2019t worry I haven\u2019t forgotten. There\u2019s a lot of remind me bot posts I got coming due soon from March . \n\nOnce again bears, hold this L . Scoreboard don\u2019t lie.

When you see this sub push the rhetoric that the stock market right now has to be irrational because it isn't highly correlated with present day macro conditions you should take that as indicative of the broad inexperience present here rather than any sort of useful analysis of markets.

        "body": "Options are contracts.  They are not stocks, they are a contract stating that the holder has the right (the choice, or the *option*) to purchase/sell 100 shares of a specific stock at a specific price on a specific date.  Calls are for purchasing 100 shares on a later date, puts are for selling 100 shares on a later date.\n\nLet's say a stock, we'll call them AAAA for simplicity, is at $100 today.  If you were to buy 10 shares of this company, that would cost you $1000.  You would own 10 shares of that company for $1000 though.  If you instead buy options, you would likely be able to get a couple options instead for the same price.  Let's say that a $100 call on AAAA for next friday costs $5 per share, or $500 per contract.  For that same $1000, you could have 2 calls on AAAA.\n\nIn both scenarios, you're looking for the value of the stock to go up obviously.  If you have 10 shares and AAAA goes up one dollar, you gained 10 dollars.  If you have 2 calls (which is 200 shares worth of an option) and AAAA goes up by a dollar, those calls increase in value as well, although not quite as much, we'll say it increases by $0.50 per share.  That's still a lot.  Instead of making $10 from your $1000 investment, you made $100 instead.  It's not quite that simple though.\n\nCalls (and puts) have an expiration date.  If the call is expiring on the 12th (next Friday), then the value of the stock needs to be decently close or above the value stated in the contract, or the \"strike price\".  In our $100 AAAA calls, if the stock goes below $100 (especially on the Thursday), the value of the call will plummet.  And remember, since these are just contracts, you don't actually own anything with the money you spent.\n\nSince you also spent $5 per share in order to get the call, the value of AAAA needs to not only be above $100 on the 12th to be redeemed (nobody should ever execute a right to buy at a higher than market price, obviously, you'd just be throwing away money for no reason) but it needs to be above $105 in order to make a profit.  You had already paid $5 per share for the right to buy those shares later at $100 per share.\n\nNext, and here's what many people do in order to make their profit instead, *you do not have to hold your contracts.*  If you buy a call on Monday, you don't have to wait until it expires on Friday to make money.  If AAAA jumps to $120 on Tuesday, you could sell your 2 calls for likely $23-$24 per share.  That would turn a $1000 investment into $4600.  What a hell of a gain, right?  If you just had 10 shares, you'd have only made $200 on a 20% stock jump when people who are options trading just made a $3600 or a 460% return.\n\nLastly, the reason that so many people avoid them.  *Options can expire* ***worthless***.  If the stock drops to $95 on Tuesday, those calls are suddenly only $2 per share, you just lost $600.  If it drops again to $90 on Wednesday, those calls are suddenly less than $1 per share, you're at an $800+ loss.  If you had 10 shares, you'd have only lost $100.  On Friday if you still have those calls, if AAAA never hits $100, your calls will expire and you'll have lost the full $1000 investment with absolutely nothing to show for it.  That money is gone for good, no amount of wishful thinking is going to make it come back to you.\n\nPuts are the opposite of calls in a way, they're the right to sell 100 shares at a certain price.  You get a put when you believe the value of the stock is going to drop.  Let's say you have a $100 put on AAAA and the stock drops to $80 on Friday.  On Friday, you would purchase 100 shares of AAAA at market value ($80, or $8000 worth) and then immediately sell it to whoever wrote the contract for $100 per share, or $10000.  That's quite a profit right there too, you made money when a stock decreased in value.  You can't really do that with standard stock trading.  Puts do still come with the same risk as calls in the fact that they too can expire worthless if the value of the stock is above the strike price.  If you have a $100 put on AAAA and the value on Friday is $105, it would be absolutely stupid to purchase 100 shares at $105 to sell them immediately for $100.  Remember, these contracts give you the *option* to buy/sell at a certain price, it doesn't mean that you have to when they expire.\n\nI hope that helps!  If you've got more questions, I'd be happy to answer them to the best of my ability.",

This can be FOMO in anticipation or FOMO in reflection. In both cases, you feel a negative emotional reaction to missing or potentially missing a big move.\n\nAs you know, negative emotions are very bad as a trader and can limit your Trading Vision - preventing you from seeing a much clearer move that fits within your own defined strategy and risk tolerance.\n\nThere is no such thing as \"missing out\" in the stock market. There are infinite opportunities presented to you every single second. So focus on that. Focus on the stream of infinite opportunities and how you can interpret and decipher this data stream to pluck out trades within your own strategy boundaries.\n\nStick to your rules, manage your emotions, and focus on what is right in front of you.\n\n**I'd love to hear some thoughts from other traders who very recently learned this lesson.

You can get lucky, go on a nice streak and see your stocks rise a lot in a short period of time, but you\u2019re playing with a house of cards.  you want your money to work for you. You may only have $1,300 now, but if you invest in a few, strong companies (profitable, strong balance sheets with positive free cash flow) or in an ETF / index fund where the stock prices will continue to increase over time, then each month or paycheck, set up a recurring deposit. Just like a 401k, you don\u2019t want to touch the money. Just put it in there and try to forget about it (please note, there is nothing wrong with looking to\nRebalance your portfolio every so often) \n\nThere are really 2 keys to investing: 1) always keep investing and 2) having the strength to stay in the game when the market drops 5-10%. \n\nYou want to be in the game as long as possible. \nFor example: if you invest $1,300 today with a $100 recurring monthly deposit and attain a 9% return (average annual return of the S&amp;P 500), in 10 years you\u2019ll have $22,050, in 20 years you\u2019ll have $71,170, but in 30 years you\u2019ll have $187,460. \n\nYou want your investment earnings to keep compounding over time. The stock market should not be viewed as a get rich quick scheme",

Focus on maybe 2 or 3 stocks that you think could move well in the day and go after them. If you're trying to do like 10 or 15 or something, you're splitting up your attention too much. This then directly leads to;\n\n2) Don't be too greedy. If you earn some gains, take them. Prioritize ending the day up from where you started, even if it's by a smaller amount than you maybe would hope. I think a lot of day traders end up losing because they stay on a position too long, hoping for more, and then the floor falls out from under them.\n\nAnd (again this is just personal opinion), don't play options. Options, to me, are just pure gambling and really stupid, because even if you take a chance on a stock and it doesn't pan out that day, well, at least, you own it, it's still an investment \u2013\u00a0six months later it might go up again and you can sell it them.",
