        "body": "Just a correction: China's smartphone industry did not steal or reverse engineer Apple or Samsung tech. It was Motorola's technologies, but they did not have to steal or reverse engineer anything. Motorola, seduced by the lure of China's gigantic market, went in and taught its Chinese suppliers everything they needed to know to supplant them. And looking at where Motorola is now, that was a lesson they did not survive.\n\nSecondly, the reason Samsung is no longer in the China market isn't due to some insidious conspiracy, but because a change in market conditions and Samsung was unable to compete with domestic smartphone manufacturers. There's a silver lining, though, in that Samsung's experience there allowed it to successfully (so far) fight Chinese smartphone companies in other markets, most notably in Europe and India.",

But now I'm cautiously optimistic with Gelsinger at the helm. Gelsinger needs to (and I think he is)  identify all the negatives (or current issues they face, including internal bureaucracy) and quickly address the vision on how to rectify these issues. At this point who cares if the stock price is affected... he didn't own the disfunction.  Once he does that,  and realigns the vision and internal systems to achieve the goal,  he might have the most successful turn around story ever.   I'm betting on him. I'll give him 5 years.  If successful I'll be rewarded. If not,  another fine US company lost to the great American corporate bureaucracy.",

So I think it will require either phone tech to improve or will be very slow latency. The limited number of sattelites and the fact Motorola tried this with sat phones twice, there is one other competitor that charges insane rates as well, and more or less space x will soon have this massive data network in space... It's redundant, they don't have the tech, predecessors have failed or broke even, and they lack the logistics to compete. May work out. No time soon. Can find something better to do with $300 than buy leaps and hope this one pans. No point in being a bear either, they are so far out from a product it may work in 5 years.

They had a 16-bit CPU 8086 but tried to make it a 20-bit one.  That was so awkward to program with segmentation.  Motorola with the 68000 was so much better with no memory segmentation.  Even though Intel has been behind for over forty years, the company still comes out ahead.  I wouldn't bet against Intel.",
