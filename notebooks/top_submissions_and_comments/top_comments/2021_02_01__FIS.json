Something big is coming.\n\n8) Massive # of FTDs will get exposed ... there is a 21 day locate limit that will be reached approx between Feb 15-20\n\nDIAMOND HANDS BITCHES",

Any price decreases (today) are LIES as even a 5th grader with the most basic understanding of economics should be able to see.\n\nFidelity has this cool thing where you can see that info [https://eresearch.fidelity.com/eresearch/gotoBL/fidelityTopOrders.jhtml](https://eresearch.fidelity.com/eresearch/gotoBL/fidelityTopOrders.jhtml) You don't even have to have an account or be logged in or anything.\n\nSo here's the strategy. See that big ass green bar next to $GME? Is the red (supply) bigger than the green (demand)? No? Then HOLD or better yet BUY MORE.\n\n\\*braces for downvotes for suggesting anything other than HOLD forever\n\nNote: If anyone has the requisite Karma and would like to post this to the main page please feel free to steal this post. I feel like people are too worried about the price and not enough about basic supply and demand.  \n\n\nThis is of course not financial advice just some info I found and am sharing. I know nothing.",

        "body": " KEY POINTS: (Please read) Like  \n\n\n1. Patience !! Hedge Fund's will now be banking, literally, on the notion we, or most of us, will be impatient and take profits right away. If you do - this whole plan falls apart. Do not be tempted by small profits. You need to hold and not sell. We also have to keep buying. For those here mostly for the \"cause\" - spread your buying out because we need continued buying from retailers.  \n\n\n2. Do not set sell limits at $30, $50, or $100. If you're going to make a sell limit, put it at $1,000 or higher. Please, everyone, stop saying \"lets get this to $30\" or \"let get this to 100\". This has so much more potential than those low numbers. Patience, and hold.  \n\n\n3. How does a short squeeze work: Watch this video &gt;&gt;&gt; [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJPNdJ06AqY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJPNdJ06AqY)  \n\n\n4. What are the tactics Hedge Fund's play to scare you into selling? This video will show you: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpMEFtPZJLc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpMEFtPZJLc)  \n\n\nFamiliarize yourself with their games and what they do so you can spot it and not fall into their traps.  \n\n\n\\- They will manipulate the market to drop the price. DO NOT SELL if you see it drop drastically, only buy. DO NOT SELL at prices for small profits and gains.  \n\n\n5. Stop asking what the price will go to or expecting a specific price. Nobody can predict this and nobody will be able to tell you, period. However - if everyone has patience, buys, and holds - it will go up, and up, and up. The price, technically speaking, is infinite.  \n\n\n6. Do not exit your Robinhood today to move it to another account. Just open another broker account and buy through there: Fidelity, Wealthsimple, Direct Investing (RBC), or any other platform that doesn't restrict buying. If you have a RH account, just keep holding those there for now.  \n\n\n7. Make sure you only invest as much as you are comfortable with losing. You could lose money, or you could make a boat load of money - both are possible.  \n\n\n8. What is short selling: &gt;&gt; [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortselling.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortselling.asp)  \n\n\n9. Short selling does not expire. Options do expire. Familiarize yourself with the difference. Link here: [https://www.investopedia.com/articles/trading/092613/difference-between-short-selling-and-put-options.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/trading/092613/difference-between-short-selling-and-put-options.asp)  \n\n\n10. Fundamentals alone, AMC is easily worth $30-$40 long term after the pandemic, that is why you should DEFINITELY not sell for less than this. With a clean balance sheet now due to getting rid of all of their debt, AMC is going to be a valuable company regardless of what happens.  \n\n\n11. Short Interest is calculated by dividing the amount of shares shorted by the float shares. Float shares are the amount of shares available in the market for trading. Float is NOT the same as Oustanding shares (287m). Please understand the difference.  \n\n\n12. Again. I cannot stress this enough - if you are here, you are either wanting to make good money, or you want to stick it to Wall Street, or both. To do this, WE need to hold out longer than they do in order to drive that price up and up. HOLD. Buy, and HOLD. Do not sell for small profits.  \n\n\nI hope this helps many.",
