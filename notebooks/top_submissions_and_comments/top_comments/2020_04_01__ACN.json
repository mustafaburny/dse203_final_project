        "body": "Zoom is my biggest position.\n\nThe security concerns are overdone which is why large enterprises like Walmart and Nasdaq and Autodesk and AB InBev continue to use them.\n\nIt's why listed company CEOs are coming out to publicly defend Zoom -- here are [Equinix](https://twitter.com/Equinix/status/1249146616247922689), [HubSpot](https://twitter.com/bhalligan/status/1248688101091872775), [PagerDuty](https://twitter.com/pagerduty/status/1248697090743644160), and [Five9](https://medium.com/@rowantrollope/beyond-the-noise-7-reasons-its-safe-to-run-zoom-9a2e639b13ec).\n\nIt's why when Zoom announced their [CISO Council and Advisory Board](https://blog.zoom.us/wordpress/2020/04/08/update-on-zoom-90-day-plan-to-bolster-key-privacy-and-security-initiatives/) last week, CISOs from VMware, Netflix, Uber, and Electronic Arts agreed to join the Advisory Board that personally advises Eric Yuan, Zoom's CEO.\n\nIt's why [Alex Stamos agreed to join as a consultant](https://medium.com/@alexstamos/working-on-security-and-safety-with-zoom-2f61f197cb34). Alex is Facebook's Chief Security Officer, [known for](https://9to5mac.com/2020/04/09/zoom-security-advisory-council/) disagreeing with Facebook's privacy policy, challenging the NSA on encryption backdoors, discovering vulnerabilities in MacOS, and being an expert witness in digital privacy matters for Google and the Electronic Frontier Foundation.\n\nOn China in particular, yes, as they were dealing with the growth from 10 million users to 200 million users of a couple months they did misconfigure some new Chinese servers so that some US users did use them when US servers were full. Normally China is geofenced so US users never use them. To understand the extent of this error, on the 1st of April there were 37 participants in the US that went through servers in China out of 233 million participants worldwide that day. All 5 US servers had to return no response for this to happen, so it was very rare, and it's now fixed.\n\nIn terms of customers dropping them, the vast majority of the ones you mention are companies that never implemented Zoom in a top-down way and are responding to employees using it. A company wanting employees to not use software that hasn't been vetted seems reasonable to me.\n\nI've spoken to a number of large multinational enterprise customers who use Zoom and they seem comfortable, think the press reports are overdone, and think Zoom's response has been good. That's one reason I'm comfortable being long.",

If the market is going to collapse, you'll know because the agents will be trying everything to get you to buy.\n\nReal talk, I bought a studio in NW DC for dirt cheap in 2012. Ironically, real estate prices in the area have risen so much, I've been priced out from buying a significantly larger spot now (2+ br) without moving far, far out to the burbs (currently renting again while renting out my studio). I've been waiting for another buyer's market so I'm really pumped for this. How were you narrowing your search during this time period? I found my 1st place because my roommate at the time was a real estate agent and specialized in foreclosures/short-sales.",

        "body": "I think Calgary and Edmonton will take a trim (might be small, but could be a big trim). They never did have a strong bounce back from the 2015 debacle. Now with the 1-2 punch of oil layoffs and corona virus some people are fucked and panicking. I have the following comments to support a decline in Calgary specifically: \n\n\\-Job losses in oil and layoffs from COVID\n\n\\-The market hadn't fully bounced back since 2015\n\n\\-There's already a huge influx of fully furnished apartments hitting websites like RentFaster. People's investment properties that run on Air BNB are now empty and burning holes in their pockets. The market can only absorb so many of these rentals hitting the market at once. Few people want to move apartments in this environment, so its quite plausible these units will have to be put up for sale. Then you have even more folks forced to sell, without an increase in buyers. \n\n\\- Using a specific example. There was a 1 BR+den unit in Mission (Young but nice area, within walking distance of downtown Calgary) for $293K. It was being used for short term rentals. This week the priced dropped $75K to $218K. \n\nI'm expecting some more fire sales out of desperation (job losses and empty investment properties) which will drag down the price of most sales. Long term though there could be 1 last boom in AB oil and gas. Should TMX, KXL and Enbridge Line 3 replacement all be executed and put into service, the mid 2020s could provide 1 last big hurrah for Canadian Oil.",
