Personally, I am not confident on FEYE long term. It has been trading sideways for 4-6 years. Meanwhile Palo Alto, Zscaler, and Fortinet put some tremendous growth in the same amount of time. Depending on Monday's volume you may see a short term trade, but if you're looking long term look into other options. \n\nDisc: I'm long Palo Alto and Crowdstrike.",

I became interested and after a bit of research I started thinking that it will be one of the most important sectors going into the future (I hadnt really paid any attention to it before the documentaries). Next step was to google who are the players in the space. I put every stock into a screener (I use finviz) and looked at the numbers to give me a basic understanding of how each is doing. Then I google each company and learn about them: how long have they been in business, do they have a steady track record (no crazy stuff/ bad mistakes in terms on how they are managed). After my research I ended up investing in a company called Fortinet because they actually had profits unlike most other cybersec companies (most of them have negative EPS) and they had a fair valuation given the growth prospects. Fortinet also seemed to be one the most trusted and well run companies out there.\n\nHope this example helps in some way when looking for stocks!\n\nOh and read Beating the street by Peter Lynch and watch videos of warren buffett talking about companies/investing in general from youtube.",

A moat that is not even considered being attacked by Microsoft exchange or anyone else as its not a huge breadwinner. Nevertheless a good recurring earner for a small cap company that is trying new things and acquisitions etc. I was expecting it to slowly grow with aome reasonable catalysts by way of them acquiring someone or being acquired. However, this pump is ridiculous and has no fundamental basis whatsoever. Even their red team tools that were stolen did  ot have any zero day. Fortinet and Qualys are really good buys still and i have them from roughly 30% ago. I will look to even add to them once cybersecurity euphoria calms down a bit.\n\nTldr: feye pure spec play at your own risk. Stock  ot worth this price atm.
