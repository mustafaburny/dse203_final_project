This is not even supported. It's not even possible to fake this because you can't initiate an ACH withdraw from PayPal.\n - 02/27/2019, someone upgraded to Gold and ignored every description of the service and regulatory requirements. They are shocked that they needed to meet the $2k minimum to have margin extended to them. They didn't have $2k in their checking account.\n - 02/26/2019, someone reports that they can't withdraw their $228.45. No details. AML hold? Who knows. Has it settled? Who knows.\n\n10 people on the first page of the BBB's site and only 1 is an actual issue. None of them have had their orders cancelled.

Seems like this would be an easy way to increase their main revenue stream without having to increase their customer base.\n\nAlso when you consider the insane number of transactions they process every hour, it could have a substantial impact.

You take multiple pictures of an object with you phone and you get a 3D model on the other side. This is current tech, though young. YOU WILL BE ABLE TO TAKE PICTURES OF YOUR MOUTH AND RECEIVE ALIGNERS. If SDC goes there with it, (and you better believe one of these aligner companies certainly will), and when APPLE BANK gives you 0% loans, kids wanting to commit suicide because the world became a vanity contest will flock to SDC for a fix. To be clear, that vision is a bunch of depressed teens fixing their teeth for IG/ticktock whatever the heck, using nothing but their phone. Is it a good idea? It doesn't matter, believe it or not teeth aligning isn't that high tech, and tech advances with time, exponentially. I'm long SDC.    \n\n\n\u2022   Now CSPR, that's a different case. It's a slab of rubberized foam. It's ONLY reason for being popular is because, again, you can get one using nothing but your phone. A man delivers it to your crappy apartment in a box. People are very, very lazy. See the stupid trend here? I mean you're onto it but you're not speaking in that nuanced fashion I crave.   \n\n\n\u2022  I'm into any company that reduces the effort required to access something everyone wants/needs. If the change in required effort is substantial or fundamentally different, the company will be a world player. Here are some companies that reduced the effort required to access something: documents (hand written to typewriter to msft), which gave rise to access to: music (apple), stalking (fb), porn (major telecom), public transit (uber). Garage sale? No, ebay. Send cash in the mail for buying that used dress? No, paypal. \n\n\u2022  Just look to whatever allows a person to think and move the least for these so called black box trades. The other tickers don't fit that mold\n\n **SPCE is WWF for nerds.

Below is also the translations.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  \n\n**Mushrooms for Peter Thiel: how a Russian woman and an American raised $ 58 million to treat depression with hallucinogens**\n\nEkaterina Malievskaya knows firsthand the horrors of clinical depression: her son suffered from the disorder. Existing drugs did not help, and she, along with her husband George Goldsmith, proposed to treat depression with an ingredient in hallucinogenic mushrooms. Crazy at first glance, the idea found the support of investors, among which the founder of PayPal Peter Thiel\n\nEkaterina Malievskaya was born and lived in Yekaterinburg until the age of 22, but she hardly speaks Russian. Her speech half consists of Englishisms: now and then, instead of \u201cadvice\u201d, advice slips , instead of \u201cmeeting\u201d, meeting , and each phrase ends with the saying you know . In the early 1990s, the medical practitioner Malievskaya went to the United States, where she settled: she continued her medical career and gave birth to a son. Nearly thirty years later, she, along with her husband George Goldsmith, senior adviser to McKinsey and founder of consulting TomorrowLab, created the startup Compass Pathways, which deals with clinical depression with a non-standard method.\n\nThe couple suggested synthesizing the psilocybin compound, which is found in some types of mushrooms and is responsible for the hallucinogenic effect, and use it as an active ingredient in anti-depression tablets. In 2017, the project managed to attract investments from PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel and twenty other private investors, as well as obtain approval from the US FDA medical regulator for testing the drug.\n\nWill an ambitious startup with Russian roots change the approach to treating one of the most common mental disorders in the world?\n\n**Migrate to the USA**\n\nWith symptoms of clinical depression - a depressed emotional state, unwillingness to communicate, lack of appetite and even suicidal thoughts - Ekaterina Malievskaya faced in 2012. The disease developed in her 19-year-old son. \u201cBefore, when I saw the patient, I just prescribed tests for him and on their basis I understood how to help with medication. But in the case of her own son, she turned out to be powerless: there have been no discoveries in the field of psychiatry for 50 years, all the medicines are old, and no one knows how to effectively treat acute depression, \u201dsays the co-founder of Compass Pathways.\n\nIn the early 1990s, she moved with a young man to New York. The migration details are not disclosed: \"it was a long time ago.\" \u201cIn the beginning of the 90s there was a completely different reality, the move did not seem difficult. I was young, I had no family, no children, no husband, and nothing globally held me in Russia, \u201dexplains Malievskaya. By that time, she had already managed to get a higher education: she first entered the journalism department of the Ural State University, but a year later she moved to the Sverdlovsk Medical Institute, from where she transferred to the Leningrad Medical Academy (now - St. Petersburg State Medical Academy named after Mechnikov). \u201cIn journalism, you talked with someone, wrote a note and that\u2019s it - you switch to another. And I wanted to know one thing, but to be a specialist, \u201dthe entrepreneur explains her choice.\n\nAfter moving, she continued her medical education: she entered the residency (analogous to residency in Russia) School of Medicine at New York University, where two years later she received a master's degree in public health. Before that, in order to learn the language, I had to work for five years as a nurse and a seamstress in a New York factory. Having received a \u201ccrust\u201d, Malievskaya began to conduct private medical practice and got a job as a professor-researcher at the City University of New York and a clinical instructor at the Ikana School of Medicine at Mount Sinai Medical Center. During this time, she had a son - from the man with whom she moved to the United States. When the boy was 6, his parents broke up. \u201cHis father went his own way, since then we did not know anything and did not hear about him,\u201d says Malievskaya.\n\n**Cure son**\n\nIn the 2000s, through mutual friends, Malievskaya met George Goldsmith, a serial entrepreneur from Philadelphia, the founder of TomorrowLab, a consulting company, and Tapestry Networks, a center for leadership development. A year later, they got married, and in 2011 moved together to London, where \"part of George's business was based.\"\n\nMalievskaya\u2019s 18-year-old son went to college in Washington and lived on his own. In 2012, during the first semester, he developed depression and obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, which did not respond to treatment. Malievskaya does not disclose the symptoms in detail: \u201cI have no right to describe the clinical picture, because he is an adult and this is his story. I can only say that months of visits to a psychiatrist worth $ 960 per hour and antidepressants did not help. He was getting worse and worse, but we could not do anything. \u201d According to statistics from the World Health Organization, the described case is not an exception: standard methods of treating depression help only 70% of patients, the remaining 30% (and this is about 90 million people!) Suffer in the absence of more effective practices.\n\nAfter a year of futile attempts to cure her son, Malievskaya stumbled on the Internet on a study in the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Arizona, published in 2006. Scientists conducted an experiment in which nine patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder were given weekly doses of different doses (from 25 \u03bcg / kg to 300 \u03bcg / kg) of synthetic psilocybin, a substance contained in hallucinogenic mushrooms and reconstituted chemically. The reaction was recorded after 0, 1, 4, 8 and 24 hours after administration. As a result, several subjects experienced significantly less noticeable symptoms. Malievskaya and Goldsmith were so inspired by what they read that they began to financially support this and similar experiments.\n\nThe use of hallucinogenic substances in psychotherapy is not a new practice, says a psychiatrist, author of the project \"Find your psychiatrist\" Maxim Malyavin. \u201cFormerly, for example, cannabis, opium tinctures, even cocaine were used for medicinal purposes, until they noticed that people developed drug addiction. The medicine was extreme: all side effects were noticed after mass use. In the XX-XXI centuries, those substances were replaced by less dangerous psilocybin, \u201dsays the expert. According to him, the main factors that prompted researchers to study the compound more deeply were the similarity of its chemical composition with serotonin - the so-called hormone of joy - and the effect of a \"complete reset\" produced on the subjects.\n\nUntil 2017, the founders of Compass Pathways transferred hundreds of thousands of dollars of personal savings to research universities and participated in trials of experimental drugs, one of which helped his son Malievskaya to seriously advance in treatment. At the same time, an effective medicine in the public domain did not appear. \u201cWe realized that the path from scientific work at universities to the release of real money is a very long one: the researchers are not focused on this. Therefore, we decided to create our own project, which will be engaged in the production of medical psilocybin, in which we believed so, \u201dexplains Malievskaya.",

They are still funneling money into their business to expand even further, so the (I think) 6 billion dollar market cap likely isn\u2019t even close to the scale they could grow to. They are a subscription based service so we Investors love that steady stream of income. Etc.

Them and WM are more or less a duopoly in the industry. 10 billion a year in revenue, still finding ways to cut costs and \u201cinnovate\u201d.
