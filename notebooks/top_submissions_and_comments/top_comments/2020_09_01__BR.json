The odds your in your ability to pick the right stock at the right price and right time.\n\nThat being said,\n\nId suggest you just do the SPY or QQQ.\n\nreason?\n\n1) Less chance for it to go bankrupt over individual companies.\n\n2) Your expected unrealized loss today is 50-60%. Meaning if you bought today and did nothing else, you could he sitting on a 50-60% loss.\n\n3) potential for \"unlimited\" growth.  This doesnt mean stocks go up forever. They may not. The market may br at its top and never recover like japans market. \n\nRegarding #2, this looks like shit right? well, it is. How do you get around this? Dollar cost averaging, options, and drip.\n\nIf the market tanked today and youre sitting on a 50% loss with the expectation that this is a japan type of setting, it wont recover fully for about 30 years. Markets will likely recover about 50% of their losses though.\n\n If you DCA, this cuts your loss in half, and reduces your recovery time from 30 years to 15 years and a 25% loss. Do it right, factor in dividends, and options premium from covered calls, this reduces can reduce your loss to around 10-15%, with the recovery time being cut down by another 5-7 years. This is with buying it st the top and buying in when it drops 50%.\n\nSo considering real return, its about 6-10% year in the spy. Average bull market is from 5-10years (currently being the longest). So youre looking at 30-100% return versus the 10-15%.\n\n\n\nNow look at it from a gambling perspective.\n\nIf someone told you your max loss at any time is only 50% of what you bet and that you only lose it entirely if you leave the table. Doesnt that sound like a good deal?",

(NASDAQ: WSTL), a leading provider of high-performance network infrastructure solutions, announced that at the Annual Meeting on September 29, 2020, the Company\u2019s stockholders voted to approve proposals authorizing the Board of Directors of the Company to amend the Company\u2019s certificate of incorporation to effect a 1-for-1,000 reverse stock split of the Company\u2019s Class A and Class B Common Stock, followed immediately by an 1,000-for-1 forward stock split (the \u201cTransaction\u201d). The reverse and forward stock splits will be effected on October\u00a01, 2020 and the Company\u2019s Class A Common Stock is expected to begin trading on the NASDAQ Capital Market on a post-forward stock split basis upon the opening of trading on October 2, 2020.  \n\n\nAs a result of the reverse stock split, each share of the Company\u2019s Common Stock held by a stockholder of record owning immediately prior to the effective time of the reverse stock split fewer than 1,000 shares of the Company\u2019s Common Stock will be converted into the right to receive $1.48 in cash, without interest, and such stockholders will no longer be stockholders of the Company. To be entitled to such cash payment, a stockholder must be a record holder of fewer than 1,000 shares immediately prior to the effective time of the reverse stock split. Investors who purchase fewer than 1,000 shares prior to the effective time of the reverse stock split and settle such purchases after the effective time shall not be entitled to such cash payment and instead their trades will be settled on a post-forward stock split basis. Trades in the Company\u2019s Common stock made on or after October\u00a01, 2020 will settle on a post-forward stock split basis.\n\nStockholders owning 1,000 or more shares of Class A Common Stock or Class B Common Stock held in a single account immediately prior the effective time of the Reverse Stock Split will not receive any payment for their shares and, immediately following the Transaction, will continue to hold the same number of shares as before the Transaction.\n\nThe Transaction will apply directly only to record holders of the Company\u2019s Common Stock. Persons who hold shares of Common stock in \u201cstreet name\u201d are encouraged to contact their bank, broker or other nominee for information on how the transaction may affect any shares of the Company\u2019s Common Stock held for their account.\n\nWestell\u2019s transfer agent, Broadridge Corporate Issuers Solutions, Inc., which is also acting as the exchange agent for the Transaction, will provide instructions to stockholders regarding the process for exchanging share certificates. Stockholders owning less than 1,000 shares will receive cash for their shares.\n\nThe Company has given notice to NASDAQ of its intent to voluntarily delist its Common Stock and to withdraw the registration of its Class A Common Stock with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). **The Company intends to file a Form 25 Notification of Removal from Listing with the SEC on or about October 9, 2020. As a result, the Company expects that listing of its shares on NASDAQ Capital Market will be terminated on or about October 19, 2020.** The Company also intends to file a Form 15 with the SEC to suspend the Company\u2019s reporting obligations under the Exchange Act. Following its delisting, the Company\u2019s Class A Common Stock may be quoted on the OTC Pink Open Market (the \u201cPink Sheets\u201d), a centralized electronic quotation service for over-the-counter securities, if market makers demonstrate an interest in trading in the Company\u2019s Common Stock. However, the Company can give no assurance that trading in its Class A Common Stock will commence or continue on the Pink Sheets or any other securities exchange or quotation medium.\n\nAs previously announced, the Company is taking these steps to avoid the substantial cost and expense of being a public reporting company and to focus the Company\u2019s resources on enhancing long-term stockholder value. The Company anticipates savings of approximately $900,000 on an annual basis as a result of the proposed deregistration and delisting transaction.",
