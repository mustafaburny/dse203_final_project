Still holding this position and planning to sell half of the position at $60. \n\nWhile there is definitely some luck with this one, I do like combing through Canadian small cap stocks and look at a combination of financial performance, product viability, competition, etc. I take a special interest in companies that are just on the verge of being profitable and in industries that I understand (mostly renewables and high tech). \n\nAlso holding positions in FLT, GDNP, YNV, GRN, GRA, XBC and UGE which are all up 100% - 300% since I bought them...\n\nThe most 2 important virtues are confidence in the company and patience. I don't think there are any shortcuts in regards to DD. If you put in the time for research and analysis you will be rewarded - eventually ;-)",

The position was not large.\n* Decided part of my portfolio to be \"fire and forget\" (it's 70% MSCI World, 30% EM ETFs). They will just live their own life and grow with the world for the next decades. (It involved a bit of reshuffling that account, but worth it).\n* My broker app supports alarms, so for each of the remaining positions I decided what my plan was and then I set corresponding alarms. Some stocks I will keep forever, some I will sell if their price leave an interval, some I will buy more of if the price is below a point (but never sell) or sell (but never re-purchase).\n* So now I wait for my phone to alert me rather than checking constantly.\n* I do a weekly check of my regime - plan to shift to monthly.\n\nMy returns are better (!) and I can focus on day2day and get more money into the system.\n\nAll the best.",

It can't keep running hotter on the same process to try to match the performance from smaller processes working cohesively (AMD). And that's just for chips on x86, Apple now has brought ARM as a real alternative to that space as well. Intel doesn't even really tangibly exist on the mobile side or on tablets as it's Qualcomm and Apple running that show. They will need to make big changes going forward to gain market share back from foreign chip makers in these spaces.",

B/c the share gives you the power during the short squeeze and there is no knowing when exactly that squeeze will happen.

With that catalyst they get an acute 1-2 day squeeze (like VW in 2008).\n\nI don't think the catalyst scenario will happen until the summer at the earliest, but I think the unwinding will probably start in the next few weeks.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy personal position in GME is currently at 1685 shares (cost basis around 19), 16C 4/16 all in IRA or Roth so I am not worried about taxes on short term gains.

If you need any more convincing, go look at the list of their platinum sponsors for next weeks #ConvergeConnect21 conference.. You might recognize some of the companies: IBM, Redhat, Google Cloud, Microsoft, Dell, VMware, AWS, PureStorage, Cisco, and Snowflake. Lenovo and PaloAlto are two of the gold sponsors. Hewlett-Packard and Intel are two of the silver sponsors. This is a Constellation Software-like company in the making- MASSIVE.

They outsource it.\n\nSamsung is currently producing 5nm, and I think TSMC is too, but their entire inventory appears to be contracted to Apple right now.\n\nIt's also not an apples-to-apples comparison from fab to fab.  Intel's 14nm is closer to a 10nm from TSMC and Samsung, and the 10nm is expected to be closer to a 7nm process.  Intel's 7nm corresponds well with a 5nm TSMC/Samsung process.\n\nIntel's 10nm is slated to come out later this year, with a slow trickle.  This puts them about 1.5 generations behind Samsung and TSMC.  In spite of this, Intel's processors are still competitive with AMD's, if just barely behind and slightly costlier (though prices for Intel are dropping and AMD are rising).\n\nI think this means overall that Intel has either a better design or manufacturing process that if they can push their node process to improve at a heightened pace could have them dominating the performance-to-price market in 2-5 years again.  Intel definitely has the cash on hand to invest in this, but they made many missteps on their push to get the 10nm and 7nm chips ready, so I'm not hopeful that Intel can pull this off, regardless of who heads the company.",
