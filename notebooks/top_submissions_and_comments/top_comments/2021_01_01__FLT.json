These shipments are a result of close collaboration with our supply chain partners, and our operational readiness to expertly handle them\u201d said Vito Cerone, Vice-President, Cargo Sales and Commercial Strategy.\n\nAir Canada Cargo underwent an extensive preparedness exercise in 2020 to ensure all aspects of its operations were up-to-date and reflective of current requirements and standards for transporting vaccines.\n\nIn July, Air Canada became the first airline in Canada to achieve IATA\u2019s CEIV Pharma certification. CEIV Pharma certification ensures international and national compliance to safeguard product integrity, while addressing specific air cargo needs. Certification requires that facilities, equipment, operations and staff comply with all applicable standards, regulations and guidelines expected from pharmaceutical manufacturers. \n\nAs part of its preparation, Air Canada Cargo also finalized agreements with additional suppliers of active, passive and hybrid packages, and increased capabilities for pharma handling by undergoing a thorough review of all stations in its network, including those managed by third parties.\n\nSee more on air Canada\u2019s website news page.
