        "body": "Yes Gilead/remdesivir also announced that their sales jumped 2.5X in the last quarter.  It will be used for many countries that can't get the vaccine or if the vaccine is not 100% effective so expect a long runway.  But also the point with this company is that their patented technology is not just a covid play - they help the body absorb drugs intraveneous or oral.  And they have emerging platforms to help companies develop drugs as well with their other acquired products.  There's upside to their results tomorrow but definitely in 2021 since the presentation is from Oct 31 and there have been some developments since then that would lead to higher revenues.  You can see they are working with every major drug company in the world - Merck, Novartis, new GSX partnership, Pfizer, etc. etc.  I don't like pharma plays typically but this is a picks and shovels type of idea with predictable recurring revenue, low risk investments, patented technology and a diversified business.  Its basically the Qualcomm of pharma.",
