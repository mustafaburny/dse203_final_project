        "body": "Long history to answer your question, but on a high level.....\n\nUnder Steve Ballmer (2000-2014), Microsoft was all about preserving their cash cow.  Their cash cow being licensing of Windows and Office.\n\nWhen Satya Nadella became CEO in 2014, he had a different philosophy and started opening up Microsoft to different revenue streams.  Microsoft became more open to open source and the company became more relevant again with enterprise companies.  For example, there is now native support to allow running Linux on Windows.  This would never have happened under Ballmer.\n\nWall street has always rewarded companies with re-occurring revenue model vs companies that had a \"CAPEX\" or \"one time purchase\" revenue model such as Apple (but now Apple is pivoting more towards software and services) with higher valuation.  Microsoft shifted from one time purchase model of their consumer Windows (95/XP, Vista, 7, etc) and Office licensing.  Office became O365, which could be purchased on a monthly/annual subscription.\n\nAzure services helped and played into the re-occurring revenue model for Microsoft.  AWS was introduced in 2006 and took many years to be where they are at today.  Microsoft is playing catch up with Azure.  However, the big advantage with Microsoft and Azure is that they have an existing enterprise organization that sold into enterprise accounts for many years.\n\nAWS didn't have an enterprise sales team and in the early years really only catered to the developers and \"rogue IT\".  Even today, in my opinion, AWS still doesn't have have the enterprise sales organization they need to compete more effectively.\n\nSame with Google.  Google never had an enterprise sales organization for GCP and is really playing catch up.  It was mentioned by Thomas Kurian that GCP sales team was only 1/15th the size of Microsoft/AWS and would like to be 1/5th the size in the next 2 years.",

        "body": "I just left my funds alone and didn't invest any of my cash, so what kind of genius does that make me?  I'm feeling pretty awful about not \"riding the wave\".  Most of the stocks I thought about buying back in March have all gone up, some 1,000% (much higher than their 52-wk highs).  Sure, my funds are almost back to where they were before March but had I played the stocks I wanted to, I would have tripled or more the value of my main fund.\n\nI was bullish but acted bearish and now I kick myself for it.  It would have had a huge effect on my life and security.\n\nThere were a few ways I was thinking of going:\n\n1. Buy solid large companies that are basically guaranteed to recover (AAPL, MSFT, AMZN, SHOP) or just QQQ fund.\n2. Buy the top 3 cruise lines at the bottom and sell no longer than a week later and take the money to put into the next trade. By then, I had Wayfair and Overstock on my watchlist and was thinking of getting into both. Analysts scared me away from W and I didn't know enough about OSTK, which had a rough several months.  Of course, W goes up 400% and OSTK goes up 1,000% from the day I would have gotten in.\n3. Join Stocktwits and FOMO until I'm down to $0 or up by $1 million.  What a pumper shit show this was.\n\nI didn't do any of them, instead, I just started learning about day trading, swing trading, how to do due diligence, how to scan for promising stocks, how to read the news, etc.  I developed a Python script to filter all the news and show me only what I want.  I started reading several books, most written many years ago but still applied.  I started watching good traders on YouTube and learning how to read charts and use indicators.  I opened some accounts with various brokers so I can test their platforms and discovered that most sucks.  I now mostly use Thinkorswim and Webull.  \n\nI have been paper trading.  I find pretty good companies, but I sometimes get in too late or sell too soon.  Learning many lessons from that.  I find companies on news before they rocket, but I rarely invested in those because I didn't think the news was a big deal.  I later learned that these penny stocks with low floats react to the news differently, even if the news is not a \"big deal\".  Some people on Stocktwits do make good calls, but they also make bad calls, so you have to do your own research (they'll only show you screenshots about their good calls later).  Fundamentals have been thrown out the window with these speculative momentum trades, which I didn't think existed.\n\nMy picks for yesterday were VCNX, CAPR, AIKI, ONTX, SONM, CCX, NIO, AYRO, ACRX.  All did great instead of ACRX.  However, it all depended on when you go in and out.  As someone with a day job, that would have been tough to keep an eye on.",

Imagine you have 100 million dollars. Where are you gonna put that money? In a savings account for it to be outpaced by inflation? \n\nIn bonds that will be outpaced by inflation? \n\nGovernment debt has gotten so out of control under trump even T-note yields are pretty garbage.\n\nThe equity market is really the only part of the financial sector which is offering yield right now, hence why asset prices are being super inflated. Amazon for instance has jumped 1300$ a share since March lows. That\u2019s not because they\u2019re increasing their volume by ridiculous amounts to justify that level of return to shareholders. \nRich people are parking their money in blue chip companies like amazon, msft, Apple etc. that\u2019s why those companies in particular have experienced parabolic explosions in equity prices.",

        "body": "It is hard to tell what tech stocks and the NASDAQ will do but a bit of history is worth studying.\n\nIn 2000 Cisco was the giant of the internet and the internet was the giant of tech stocks. Every employee at Cisco was rich because they all got stock options (yes, including the janitors in those days) and the stock price had climbed from $10 in 98 to $33 in 99 and $79/sh in 2000. They did then sell and still do sell routers that were the backbone of the internet and CSCO was everyone's tech darling. I can't tell you how many Cisco employees had told me in spring of 2000 that they were not going to diversify until CSCO hit $100/sh. In Sept of 2001, their share price had dropped to $12/share. They still were the backbone of the internet but the internet and tech were no longer the darling of the Market. In Feb of 2009 they were at $14/sh and are today at $48/sh. So they today as an ongoing company still doing what it did and with a strong balance sheet are trading at roughly 2/3rds the price they were 20 years ago. That is what can happen to a really good tech company.\n\nBTW, CSCO is not the only one. Intel was at $74.88 in the fall of 2000 and is at $60/sh now and was running around in the $20's for most of the past 20 years. Still a great tech company doing great things.   And yes Intel employees also got rich on options.  I met with a Intel employee, a janitor, single, living in a trailer that was about to exercise $3 mm in net in the money INTC options and needed help with estate planning.   Those were the days.  A short edit:  In 2000 the estate tax began with only $675,000 of assets at death and it started just below 50% and quickly grew to 55%.   So you didn't need to be very wealthy to need estate tax planning.\n\nMicrosoft, one of today's tech darlings, was $50/sh in early 2000. It wandered around $25/share for 15 years until it again hit $50/sh in fall of 2015, fifteen long years later. The last 5 years have been good for it but will it stay at $200/sh?",

I believe big tech like and Apple and Google as well know the value of investing into schools for potential new customers in the future.

In fact MSFT has one of the largest market capitalizations of any company (in 2nd behind AAPL). Even higher than AMZN &amp; TSLA but if you compared them based on price, it would seem that AMZN &amp; TSLA \u201care better.\u201d Obviously a stock price means something as it correlates to the market cap and also where it is in its trading range and so forth but a better way to compare companies is by their market cap, P/E, and future growth for example. Also, certain industries have a higher average P/E such as tech and industries have a lower P/E such as auto so it\u2019s important when comparing companies within the same industry but not so much when comparing companies like MSFT and F. \n\nThe future of the cloud and MSFT\u2019s Azure cloud in addition to its irreplaceable &amp; monopolized Office software suite such as Excel, Word, PowerPoint, Outlook, etc. as well as Xbox and the future of gaming and their Windows\u2019 OS make it have an incredible economic moat. Plus, its ingenuity and innovation, I see it being a winner along with AAPL for decades to come.",
