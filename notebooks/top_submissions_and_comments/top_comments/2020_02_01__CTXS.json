        "body": "&gt; Yes.  Or only a handful of people who work as a team.  You haven't heard the expression, \"too many chefs in the kitchen?\"\n&gt; Data is useful for scientific exploration.  It is NOT useful in designing usability for software.\n&gt; It's not up to physicians to come up with the solution.  That's the whole point.  Just like food critics don't need to be world class chefs to be able to tell what's good food from bad food. To be a leader in any field means presenting to the public what they never knew they needed.  I presume you are aware of the history of technology.  You shouldn't need me to explain this to you.\n\nIt\u2019s not the 1960s anymore. You\u2019re describing the cowboy Don Draper way of doing business. Multi-billion dollar enterprises don\u2019t operate that way. Period. It\u2019s not as effective as data driven decision making. \n\nFor example, if there are 3 different workflows for completing the same task, with 300 hospitals having  adopted each workflow, Epic can collect KPIs related to user satisfaction, efficiency, health outcomes, billing outcomes, etc for each workflow. Keep in mind that these KPIs are designed by organizations like Epic then recommends the workflow with the best outcomes, and they design their system around it. \n\nNo single human being is wise enough to consistently beat this model by choosing the workflow with their \u201cgut\u201d. That sort of \u201cvisionary\u201d is myth. Nothing more. \n\n&gt; More IT people isn't going to help the problem.  The problem is the fundamental model of Epic is not well-designed and depends far too much on healthcare workers who know what they need FOR THEIR JOB, but don't know what they need from Epic to get it done optimally.\n\nUntil there\u2019s further standardization in healthcare models, I\u2019m afraid more QUALIFIED IT workers are necessary. There\u2019s a certain amount of adjusting that\u2019s required not because Epic is flawed but because every health organization is using slightly different workflows, slightly different orders, slightly different physical layouts, etc. \n\n&gt; Yet, they expected us to know how Epic, a software that we had no experience in, should build our module.\n\nSounds like you had some incompetent implementers. They should have been able to build the system for you based on a serious of Q&amp;A\u2019s that require zero knowledge of Epic. Basically, \u201cDo you do it this way or that way? Do you have this device or that device?\u201d Etc \n\n&gt; FINALLY, one day I figured out what happened.  My keyboard has a backslash key above the Enter key that I was accidentally brushing when I was typing.  Apparently, doing this while in a report, it functions as some kind of \"escape\" key.  If you keep typing on the keyboard, nothing appears.  However, if you tap it again, it brings up a little window that shows everything you were typing while it was in \"escape\" mode.  The IT people had no idea why it was doing that nor what it was for.  There is NO indication on the screen that you've entered this mode, or what that little window is for after you type it in.  As far as I can tell, it's some developer's backdoor way of doing something to the system. That is just a tiny example of all the little random unexplainable hair pulling shit that happens in Epic.\n\nThis is exactly what I\u2019m talking about in my previous post. This has NOTHING to do with Epic. That\u2019s not an epic function. No idea why your computer was doing that. Maybe your IT staff installed a program that hijacked the / key? Or they installed something on the Citrix server? \n\n&gt; Okay, it's pretty clear that you work for Epic at this point.  Judy is NOT Steve Jobs.  Maybe she's a good company leader - I don't know.  I have no knowledge of her at all.  But based on the software, she's certainly not a visionary. \n\nI don\u2019t work for Epic. \n\n&gt;  I get frustrated with Epic not because it's not functional.   We certainly CAN get our jobs done by figuring out workarounds.  But there are so many examples of things that shouldn't need a workaround.  I get frustrated because being a tech savvy person, I KNOW that current day software is capable of so much more and has been for a long time.  Another example?  The search bar in Epic feels like it's there just because Google made it trendy.  I've tried searching for so many things.  It's pretty much useless.  If I have to learn how to use a search bar, it's already a failure.\n\nEpic is functional. You think companies like Mayo Clinic, Cleveland Clinic, and KP would invest in a software that doesn\u2019t function? Your particular build of Epic might require workarounds but that\u2019s because your IT staff messed it up. And the search function works great. No idea why you think it doesn\u2019t. It\u2019s not complicated. \n\nAnyways, not arguing for the sake of being controversial, it\u2019s just not often I get to have this conversation anonymously. Dialogue can be constructive :)",

I'd also personally prefer these 2 since they offer more than Vanguard: 24/7 customer service, checking or cash management accounts with ATM fee refunds (Vanguard closed the closest thing they had over the summer, and even then, it was much more limited than Fidelity or Schwab's offerings), and both offer optional credit cards if you wish. For stocks and ETFs, Fidelity is in the process of rolling out fractional shares over the next few weeks, Schwab has announced it but has not started a rollout yet (I believe I heard spring?).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou should open a high yield savings account in addition to everything else, possibly except if you go with Fidelity or Schwab and use their CMA or checking accounts (since you can invest money there in money market funds which should return similar to a HYSA, but you do give up FDIC or NCUA insurance by doing this).",

(e.g. I have a good bit of Fidelity\u2019s 2055 Index FDEWX). I ask because Fidelity has different target date funds, some of which are much more expensive.\n\n2) What funds are available in your 401k plan? Can you purchase iShares ETFs? Or is the fund selection pretty small?\n\nI ask these things because while factor investing is pretty cool and technically more theoretically optimal when implemented properly, it\u2019s hard to beat the behavioral benefits of automatically DCA-ing into a dead simple one fund portfolio that automatically rebalances for you.\n\nIf you\u2019re really dying to get some flexibility though, then I think your plan of contributing up to the 401k match then maxing your Roth IRA (do Roth if you can) is good. But I would put leftover money after this back into the 401k and max it before looking at a taxable account. Utilize those tax advantages accounts as much as you can!",

Combined we make right around $200k a year. We have about $95k in retirement accounts and about $10k in savings. We want to continue to grow our retirement savings, and still be able to travel.\n\nWe\u2019re not against taking risks and playing the long game. Thought our single largest Rollover IRA has been fairly flat for the last 10 years (currently at $52k). It\u2019s in a managed account with a financial advisory firm and in a fidelity account. The fees are $628 per month. I believe the fees are destroying my gains. It looks like the fund choices are producing, but the bottom line has felt flat (slightly upwards over the last 10 years). \n\nOut of that $95k, $18k is in a separate Fidelity account in a S&amp;P 500 fund/product. And we have  5 shares of Amazon (totaling about $10k now) and a few shares of Visa &amp; MasterCard (totaling $2.5k). \n\nOur home is valued at about $360k and we have about $250k left on the mortgage. Out two vehicles were both PreOwned, but not inexpensive and we owe about $20k on the 2016 Mini Cooper and $33k on the 2013 Porsche Cayenne. We have about $20k credit card debit we\u2019ve been grinding down the CC debt over time. From as high as $45k or so, to $20k). \n\nMy wife is very good with money. I am not. We money becomes an issue, I tend to look for a different employer. (My job is in pretty high demand and I have a good bit of experience).  \n\nThe two other upcoming expenses we foresee will be buying a preowned Airstream travel trailer and replacing our floors in our home. Other than that, it will be retirement savings. \n\nAny advice would be welcome.",

This is your first and foremost, put the money away, let Fidelity or whoever do their jobs, don\u2019t touch it.  Monitor it, ask questions, maybe make some changes WITH your financial advisor.  Other than that, leave it alone. \n\n2.  Want to be like OP and never trade again, cuz you suck at it? Ok, open a second IRA, a Roth preferably, 100% ran by you, buy and hold the next Amazon, Apple, Netflix, etc. Woohoo, you\u2019re a genius. \n\n3.  Not touching 1 or 2 whatsoever, day trade with separate funds that you\u2019re ok with losing.  Have some type of limit...IE \u201cif I lose 50k, I\u2019m done because obviously I suck at this.\u201d",

Almost as good as Lightspeed and I can easily open a new stock and have an opening order submitted a within a second if I choose. The ladder is good to trade on.
