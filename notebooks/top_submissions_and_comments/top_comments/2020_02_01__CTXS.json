        "body": "&gt;This is exactly what I\u2019m talking about in my previous post. This has NOTHING to do with Epic. That\u2019s not an epic function. No idea why your computer was doing that. Maybe your IT staff installed a program that hijacked the / key? Or they installed something on the Citrix server?\n\nLet me be more precise.  This was not a system window.  It was a window WITHIN Epic that popped up.  To be more precise, it was a frame that pops up under my pending cases list and above the report control list.  It is definitely in the Epic system because the other Epic frames resize to accommodate it.  Also, none of the other apps or Windows functions are affected by it.  Just Epic.  The IT people observed me doing it via remote desktop and they didn't know why it was there or what it was for.  They just shrugged their shoulders and said to avoid hitting the backslash key.  \n\nWhile I'm at it, formatting is another area that drives me nuts.  Our reports are defaulted to Arial size 10.  I've tried changing them in SmartPhrases but whenever I drop in a Smartphrase, it goes to Arial size 10 and loses all other formatting - bold, italics, etc.  Because it LOOKS like Microsoft Word, I figured there must be some way to change it.  I've looked in all the menus to see if there was a way to change the defaults and as far as I could tell there wasn't.  In the SmartPhrase editor, there is an option to Keep Formatting Changes, but that doesn't allow it either.  When I complained about it (this was two years ago when Epic went live for us), they said it would need to be implemented on the server side, but that was the default that everyone else chose.  IOW, \"Too bad, live with it or make the changes yourself.\"  This is pretty basic stuff that shouldn't be an issue in modern software.  I wasted countless hours trying to figure it out and also re-editing each report by hand because I can't get the SmartPhrase to drop in and look the way I want it to.  I'm SURE there is a way to do it.  But I'm a tech savvy person and I can't figure it out.  And the IT people were distinctly unhelpful with it.  So eventually of course, I gave up.  But it left a seriously sour taste in my mouth.  This is why I compare it to an iOS app.  This should not be a problem in a modern day app.",

        "body": "&gt; Yes.  Or only a handful of people who work as a team.  You haven't heard the expression, \"too many chefs in the kitchen?\"\n&gt; Data is useful for scientific exploration.  It is NOT useful in designing usability for software.\n&gt; It's not up to physicians to come up with the solution.  That's the whole point.  Just like food critics don't need to be world class chefs to be able to tell what's good food from bad food. To be a leader in any field means presenting to the public what they never knew they needed.  I presume you are aware of the history of technology.  You shouldn't need me to explain this to you.\n\nIt\u2019s not the 1960s anymore. You\u2019re describing the cowboy Don Draper way of doing business. Multi-billion dollar enterprises don\u2019t operate that way. Period. It\u2019s not as effective as data driven decision making. \n\nFor example, if there are 3 different workflows for completing the same task, with 300 hospitals having  adopted each workflow, Epic can collect KPIs related to user satisfaction, efficiency, health outcomes, billing outcomes, etc for each workflow. Keep in mind that these KPIs are designed by organizations like Epic then recommends the workflow with the best outcomes, and they design their system around it. \n\nNo single human being is wise enough to consistently beat this model by choosing the workflow with their \u201cgut\u201d. That sort of \u201cvisionary\u201d is myth. Nothing more. \n\n&gt; More IT people isn't going to help the problem.  The problem is the fundamental model of Epic is not well-designed and depends far too much on healthcare workers who know what they need FOR THEIR JOB, but don't know what they need from Epic to get it done optimally.\n\nUntil there\u2019s further standardization in healthcare models, I\u2019m afraid more QUALIFIED IT workers are necessary. There\u2019s a certain amount of adjusting that\u2019s required not because Epic is flawed but because every health organization is using slightly different workflows, slightly different orders, slightly different physical layouts, etc. \n\n&gt; Yet, they expected us to know how Epic, a software that we had no experience in, should build our module.\n\nSounds like you had some incompetent implementers. They should have been able to build the system for you based on a serious of Q&amp;A\u2019s that require zero knowledge of Epic. Basically, \u201cDo you do it this way or that way? Do you have this device or that device?\u201d Etc \n\n&gt; FINALLY, one day I figured out what happened.  My keyboard has a backslash key above the Enter key that I was accidentally brushing when I was typing.  Apparently, doing this while in a report, it functions as some kind of \"escape\" key.  If you keep typing on the keyboard, nothing appears.  However, if you tap it again, it brings up a little window that shows everything you were typing while it was in \"escape\" mode.  The IT people had no idea why it was doing that nor what it was for.  There is NO indication on the screen that you've entered this mode, or what that little window is for after you type it in.  As far as I can tell, it's some developer's backdoor way of doing something to the system. That is just a tiny example of all the little random unexplainable hair pulling shit that happens in Epic.\n\nThis is exactly what I\u2019m talking about in my previous post. This has NOTHING to do with Epic. That\u2019s not an epic function. No idea why your computer was doing that. Maybe your IT staff installed a program that hijacked the / key? Or they installed something on the Citrix server? \n\n&gt; Okay, it's pretty clear that you work for Epic at this point.  Judy is NOT Steve Jobs.  Maybe she's a good company leader - I don't know.  I have no knowledge of her at all.  But based on the software, she's certainly not a visionary. \n\nI don\u2019t work for Epic. \n\n&gt;  I get frustrated with Epic not because it's not functional.   We certainly CAN get our jobs done by figuring out workarounds.  But there are so many examples of things that shouldn't need a workaround.  I get frustrated because being a tech savvy person, I KNOW that current day software is capable of so much more and has been for a long time.  Another example?  The search bar in Epic feels like it's there just because Google made it trendy.  I've tried searching for so many things.  It's pretty much useless.  If I have to learn how to use a search bar, it's already a failure.\n\nEpic is functional. You think companies like Mayo Clinic, Cleveland Clinic, and KP would invest in a software that doesn\u2019t function? Your particular build of Epic might require workarounds but that\u2019s because your IT staff messed it up. And the search function works great. No idea why you think it doesn\u2019t. It\u2019s not complicated. \n\nAnyways, not arguing for the sake of being controversial, it\u2019s just not often I get to have this conversation anonymously. Dialogue can be constructive :)",
