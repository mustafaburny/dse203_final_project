So their President said fuck it we\u2019ll use magic Internet money to get around that since magic Internet money doesn\u2019t care if you have ID. Plus they\u2019ll basically get a pretty legit GDP boost solely from remittances not having 10% taken by Western Union and the like.\n\nHonestly it seems crackpot from the outside but it actually solves a lot of the issues holding their nation back from modernizing their financial system so this guy just said fuck it and went for it.

They want to reward n thank the PIPE.\n\nHere is the kicker. Why would they announce when PIPE can sell causing the momentum to be lesser on the uptrend. Also, Vogel (Spac guy), and Wu (CEO) both have stock options conditional on MVST being above $12 or $15 (cant remember) for 20 out of 30 days.

Looking further ahead, we are taking measures to work with our strategic foundry partners to further enlarge our longer-term capacity pool. We will give more details as they come about,\u201d concluded Mr. Jordan Wu.\n\nFirst quarter driver IC revenue for automotive amounted to $43.7 million, up 16.4% sequentially and up 44.3% year-over-year. Automotive driver IC business accounted for more than 14% of total revenues in this quarter. Notwithstanding the decent growth, the Company is still suffering from severe foundry capacity shortage for automotive applications. While the shortage is expected to persist, as indicated in the last earnings call, Himax expects to enlarge its shipment quarter by quarter this year and beyond into next year.",

        "body": "I have been researching and investing in CASI Pharmaceuticals since June 2021. I wanted to share with you my DD and encourage you to view my 'Master File' on Google Sheets that I have linked below.\r  \n\r  \n$CASI is a US-based Oncology/Hematology pharmaceutical company founded in 1990 (formerly Entremed). The company has shifted in recent years to place their focus on developing and commercializing their drugs in China. This is primarily due to China's rising cancer population, facilitated approval process, less competition, and to ride the wave as more $ is flowing into R&amp;D and STEM in China than another country as China transitions from a manufacturing/industrial powerhouse.\r  \n\r  \nUnlike the majority of clinical-stage biotech/pharma companies, CASI already has a commercially available drug (EVOMELA) on the market, bringing in over $15 in 2020, with over 80% in sales this year alone. The CEO, Wei-Wu He, has said the drug is nearly bringing in enough revenue to cover all of CASI sales and marketing expenses. However, CASI primary and game changing drugs are CNCT-19 (phase 2 registration trial), BI-1206 (phase 1/2 &amp; 1/2a), CID-103 (phase 1), CB-5339 (phase 1) and various other assets already approved that they are submitting NMPA registrations studies for i.e. Thiotepa and Octreotide.\r  \n\r  \nCASI is focused on building its business through partnerships, co-commercialization agreements, and equity stakes in other therapeutic and pharmaceutical companies. For example, CNCT-19 is being developed by Juventas, BI-1206 by BioInvent, CB-5339 by Cleave Therapeutics, etc. These deals have allowed CASI to secure promising lead drug candidates, that, if approved, CASI has exclusive licensing and commercialization for the Greater China market.\r  \n\r  \nIn this post I would like to focus on their t-cell therapy CNCT-19 as it is the nearest to trial completion, shows very promising results, is an innovative cancer treatment for ALL and NHL, and has competitors that I can use for potential revenue modeling. If approved, CNCT-19 will be the only domestically manufactured t-cell therapy in China. Because of this CASI expects their drug to be much more affordable compared to current treats that average $300,000. BTIG release a report in May 2021, explaining that if CASI can offer their drug for under $80,000 their price target would increase from $4 to $21. Their current CAR-T competitors include Novartis' Kymriah ($298m in revenue first half of 2021) and Gilead's Yescarta ($338 million in the first half of 2021). CASI's market cap currently sits at around $232 million, with no debt, enough cash ($73m in C&amp;CE Q2 2021) runway to fund operations through 2023, with a current burn rate of only $6m (Oppenheimer). Their CNCT-19 results, showed that 90% of patients reached complete remission within 28 days, and there was a 95% confidence level after a 24-month follow-up.\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nr/pennystocks \\- $CASI - Due Diligence including MASTER FILE (Oppenheimer $6 PT - 260% Upside)\r  \nHere is Oppenheimer's $6 price target.\r  \n\r  \nI would encourage you to do more research on CASI and check out the master file that I have created which contains more information about their assets with all clinical trial data, financials, insider ownership, rating reports, competitors, and information on the 100,000 sq meter manufacturing facility they are building (CASI WUXI). Thank you for your time! Here is the Master File!\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nr/pennystocks \\- $CASI - Due Diligence including MASTER FILE (Oppenheimer $6 PT - 260% Upside)\r  \nThe CEO has been loading the boat, with over 21m shares (15% ownership) as of 8/19/21",

AMD is growing in x86 server and nVidia is going to get ARM (there should be a slight discount for the uncertainty but the duffers are probably overbidding it so it washes).\n\nBut, I believe that people don't understand that the XLNX deal is dilutive and will be a millstone around AMD's neck until a massive, expensive restructuring of XLNX's whole ecosystem is done, while they also don't understand the full implications of nVidia's domination of the AI/ML market.\n\nSo, unless there's some surprise for us all, that 4.6:1 ratio between them is going to grow.",
