        "body": "OK it's really pretty easy. Imagine you want to buy a house that is worth $100,000. You put down a down-payment of 5%, or $5000.\n\nNow let's say a month later you've done the appraisal and all the paperwork is ready and it's time to buy. But during that month something indirectly happened that affected the value of the house. \n\nMaybe Disney announced they were building a new park nearby and the value of the house doubled.\nMaybe the city announced they were building a sewage plant nearby and the value of the house plummeted.\n\nEither way, you've already got an option to buy the house at the $100,000 agreed on a month ago regardless of what the price is today. Notice I said option. You don't actually have to.\n\nIn the 1st example where the value went up, you can buy the house for $100,000 even though it's worth $200,000, instantly pocketing $100,000 profit in equity. Maybe Beyonce buys the house across the street and the house you wanted goes up to $5 million *in value*. The *cost* remains the same to you. You still get to buy it for $100,000. In theory the price of the house could skyrocket to any amount and you'd still only have to pay $100,000 since you secured that price when you put down the down payment. The possibilities for profit are endless, the sky is the limit. \n\nIn the 2nd example where the price went down and they're building a sewage plant nearby, you decide you don't want the house anymore. You're not required to buy it, but you forfeit your down payment and lose $5000. No matter how much the value of the house has dropped, you can't possibly lose more than your $5000 down payment. \n\nSo while the possible profits are infinite, the possible losses are capped at your initial down payment. \n\nLet's use that extreme example; Beyonce moves in next door and the house is worth $5 million now. You decide you just want the cash, you don't even care about the house. You want to pocket the money and you can go buy a different house. You sell the option to buy the house at $100,000 to someone else for say $4.6 Million. Not quite the full $5 million because they still have to buy the house, there's a lot of paperwork, etc. You never even owned the house, all you ever owned was the option to buy the house, but you sold that option to someone else and made a huge profit because you were smart (or lucky) and secured that option when the price was low.\n\nThis is almost exactly what call options are, with the most significant difference being that your 'down payment' is not applied to the cost of the stock if you choose to buy it. Instead it's paid like a fee for the privilege of buying the option. Otherwise it's pretty much the same. You buy an option today to lock in the price (called a strike price) to buy the stock next week, next month, or whenever you choose. If you locked in a price lower than the stock is actually worth you can either buy the stock at that lower price, or sell your option and let someone else buy the stock at that strike price. If the stock goes down below the strike price, you don't have the buy the stock, you just lose your deposit. So the profit potential is limitless, but your potential loss is capped at your deposit fee.\n\nSo let's look at a call option example using simple numbers.\n\nToday's AMC price is $50. You think it will go up to $100 by next Friday. With a traditional long sale you just buy the stock at today's price and hope it goes up. If it's $100 next Friday you've made $50. If it's $200 you've made $150. If it's $10 you've lost $40. This is how you currently buy stock. The problem is your potential earnings is limited to how many shares you can afford to actually buy, and your potential loss is... well you could lose everything if the business goes bankrupt.\n\nThis is the beauty of call options. Options are pretty cheap, and you don't have to actually buy the shares. I can buy an option to buy 100 shares for a deposit fee of anywhere between maybe $1 to $15. Even though I don't have enough money to buy 100 shares, I do have enough money to pay for an option, knowing I have no intention of actually buying the stock. Instead, if the price of the stock moves up above what I guessed it would and what I have the option of paying (the strike price), I can sell the option to someone else who can afford to buy the stock. They're happy to buy it because they're getting the stock at less than market price, and I'm happy to make money selling the option. If my prediction was wrong, I'm not on the hook for buying the shares, I just forfeit my deposit.... times 100. Wait what? Times 100?! Yes but wait it's not as bad as it sounds. 1 option allows you to buy up to 100 shares, however you pay the deposit on each share if you buy the stock, and you forfeit the deposit on each share if you don't. It's not that bad though if you consider you could be buying stock at way below market value. \n\nSo let's look at the example above again. If AMC is $50 today, and I think it will be $100 next Friday. I don't have enough money to buy many shares but I do have enough money to buy an option to buy the stock for $50 per share (the strike price) any time until the end of the day next Friday, that option only costs me a $10 deposit fee. That's all I need to put down today. Now if I'm right, and the price hits $100 next Friday, I could buy up to 100 shares for $50 each plus that $10 deposit on each share for a total of $60 per share. That $10 deposit seems steep times 100 but remember the stock is worth $100 so if I do exercise my option to buy all 100 shares I've made a $40 profit on each one.\n\n$50 strike price +$10 deposit fee X 100 = $6000 cost to buy 100 shares\nValue $100 per share X 100 = $10,000\nProfit $4,000\n\nWell why not just buy the 100 shares today for $50 each? You could, let's consider that.\n\n$50 X 100 = $5000\nValue $100 per share X 100 = $10,000\nProfit $5,000\n\nAt first glance it seems like it simply makes more sense to just buy the stock and not bother with the call options at all. In this particular case with these particular numbers that would have been the smarter choice. But what if the value didn't go to $100? Let's look at some other scenarios.\n\nFirst let's simply say you don't have $500 today to buy the 100 shares but you are expecting to have money next Friday. Well you could buy the shares next Friday but by then they're up to $100 each remember? You can only afford 50 shares instead of $100 and you have $0 profit. In this case where you don't have money right now, buying a call option today to lock in the price for next Friday would have been your better choice since you'd have 100 shares and $4000 profit instead of 50 shares and $0 profit.\n\nWhat if you don't have $5000 to buy in today and you won't have $5000 by next Friday? Well remember you don't actually have to buy the stock. You can sell the option to someone else and let them buy it. You can buy an option today for just $10 and sell it before the end of the day next Friday for a profit as long as the share price hasn't dropped below the strike price + deposit fee. If it goes to $100 you'll be able to sell for somewhere around $2000. You don't get the full $10,000 of course because the guy you sell the option to still has to actually buy the stock himself. But still you can make a ton by selling your option as long as it's still at a profit (in the money). Worst case scenario it drops below the strike price you locked in and you are required to forfeit the deposit times 100 for a total loss of $1000. But that's the maximum you could lose, even if the stock drops to zero you're not required to buy it, you can't lose more than your deposit times 100 shares. While it seems like a big risk, your risk is capped, and the potential profits are ridiculous for very little investment. \n\nSome other factors to consider are determining the strike price and the expiration, as these both affect your deposit fee.\n\nIf the stock is at $50 today and you choose a strike price of $50, the deposit is kind of high ($10 per share) because there's a very good chance you will make a profit.\nIf the stock is at $50 today and you choose a strike price of $100, the deposit is lower (maybe $6 per share) because it's less likely that the price will go that high and your risk of losing your deposit is higher.\nIf the stock is at $50 today and you choose a strike price of $150, the deposit is much lower (maybe $3 per share) because it's very likely the price will not hit $150 per share and you will lose your deposit. \n\nThe maximum strike price you can choose is capped at roughly 300% of the current share price.\n\nYou can actually choose a strike price *lower* than than today's price, however the deposit is extremely expensive because it's very likely that the price won't drop below the strike price. For example you can actually buy an option to buy AMC shares for 50\u00a2 each! But it costs almost a $60 deposit fee PER SHARE, lol.\n\nIf the call option expires and you haven't sold it, your broker will automatically exercise it for you if you have enough buying power in your account. Otherwise it will automatically sell it for you. If the price has dropped below the strike price, the cost of the deposit times 100 will be deducted from your account.",

The assignment of the two Amazon people as CEO and CFO is again very bullish. All I want to see is this company turning a profit again.\n\nBut let's be honest, it didn't matter what the earnings were: the price was gonna drop after market anyways because of planned moves and bad liquidity. The real question is how the price will move tomorrow at market opening.\n\nHowever, don't be fooled: there is no fundamental reasoning behind current price levels. The only reason it's there now is because of meme stock season/the short squeeze story. If you buy in now, better 'buckle up' for some heavy volatilty. Better have some diamond hands (and not just for the meme).\n\nFor the record, I bought shares early December at around $16 and I've held my shares ever since then so I feel like i'm pretty neutral on this topic. The company turnaround was the reason I bought in, the short squeeze thing just the cherry on top as it seemed improbable to me at the time. To me, the positive factor about the short percentage was just that the price was so low at the time, I could get in fairly cheaply.\n\nMaybe I should have sold in January, but tbh I kind of believe that the shorters must have just delayed the inevitable or done some illegal stuff to not cause the MOASS back then. The stock was rocking at $400 with still an incredible amount of short %, genuinely don't know how they managed to get out of that situation. I think I'll just hold and if the squeeze happens then I'll sell, if it doesn't i'm fine with holding because this is probably the best trade I'll ever do in my life and I just like the stock ;)",
