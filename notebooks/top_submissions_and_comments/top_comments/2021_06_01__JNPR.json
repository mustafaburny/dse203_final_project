Years down the line, the same title will be sold for a fraction of the price on their own platform... and that's it.\n\nWhy the focus on the amount of times a digital title can earn the publisher money? The incremental costs of producing additional copies of a digital game are near 0.\n\n&gt; A small percentage off tens of thousands of resales of an old or obsolete title that is no longer offered in the publisher's own catalogue vs. buying the game from the publishers' own old game discount bin for a few bucks... again, once? Might not make sense initially, but especially in the used / old game market those small revenue streams would add up: especially when compared to a scenario where users would not otherwise buy the game.\n\nI still don't see the incentive for a publisher to cannibalize their own sales. As an example, Fallout: New Vegas was released in 2010 on Steam and other digital platforms. It cost $59.99 then. \n\nToday, Fallout: New Vegas is available on Steam for $9.99. A person that wants a copy of the game can buy it today. The publisher will receive the same percentage cut of the $9.99 sale that they received from the $59.99 sale.\n\nLet's now assume that Gamestop has a digital NFT token that allows resale of digital games. Someone in 2010 buys the game for $59.99, and today sells its for $9.99. The publisher receives a cut of the $9.99 sale, in addition to the original $59.99 sale.\n\nThe problem here is, what's the difference to the publisher? They receive the same amount of money from the sales. The keys to sell a second copy of the game have already been generated and sent to Steam for resale, so there's no incremental cost there. The NFT resale is basically cannibalizing a new sale.\n\n&gt; drive up scarcity of used titles? Release special NFT collector's versions of certain titles which are unlikely to ever go down in price due to extreme rarity?\n\n&gt; Especially the latter: think Magic the Gathering and take the Black Lotus card as an example. If you could release a fixed amount of those into the wild and get a cut for each and every high-price resale of those decades down the line... wouldn't you?\n\nI can see the argument/value for NFT sales of collectible items intended to be artificially scarce. Maybe not a multibillion dollar market, but definitely a possible avenue for revenue growth.\n\n I don't see the argument for driving artificial scarcity for regular, non collectible digital games. Even in the pre digital games, the games that were scarce were driven by production costs, and not by publishers attempting to drive up prices by limiting availability.",

        "body": "\nPaysafe preps post-Spac\u00a0refi\n\u00a0\n\n02 Jun 2021\n\nFintech payments provider Paysafe has launched a refinancing of its remaining credit facilities, following its $9bn merger with a Bill Foley-controlled Spac, which closed in March. The merger and its accompanying PIPE allowed the firm to pay down debt and cut its leverage, and now it wants to lock in the benefits with a lower-cost refi.\n\nJP Morgan is sole physical bookrunner on the dollar and euro term loans, totalling $1.026bn between the currencies. This will be followed with an equal sized slug of bonds in dollar and euros, yet to be launched.\nTalk on both tranches is 300bp-325bp at 99.5, with a 25bp margin step-down if the firm hits 3.7 times net leverage, half a turn below its present level, according to the loan marketing materials.\nLenders have successfully pushed back on proposed margin ratchet terms \u2014\u00a0including Cerba, for example \u2014 but these are generally deals which started with more aggressive terms, such as multiple step-downs for each quarter-turn of leverage. Deals with 25bp for half a turn have largely sailed through.\n\"It's a real economic term and something investors can easily rally around,\" said a leveraged finance syndicate banker. \"Some of the other docs points can be a bit of a niche interest but this is universal.\"\nPaysafe earmarked \u20ac1.25bn-equivalent of its outstanding debt for repayment as part of the merger, which closed at the end of March. The company said in\u00a0its introduction to equity market analysts\u00a0that it would have net leverage of 3.6-3.8 times on its 2021 earnings following the transaction \u2014 suggesting it intends to activate the margin step-down quickly.\nIt will, however, be going on the acquisition trail as well. Outlining the deal to analysts, Foley said: \u201cOne of the keys to this transaction and value creation for our shareholders is the reduction of Paysafe\u2019s leverage ratio to 3.6 times. As Paysafe continues to grow and generate cash flow, that leverage ratio will continue to come down creating even more opportunity to pursue accretive M&amp;A opportunities.\u201d\nMoody\u2019s estimated leverage at 5.2 times on March 2021 numbers, after backing out some of the company\u2019s adjustments.\nBased on its expected 2021 Ebitda, the business was 6-6.2 times levered at the end of last year, with net debt of $2.99bn, incurred when Blackstone and CVC took the firm private in 2017. The sponsors scored a huge win with the transaction, paying \u00a33bn for the company and selling it on at a valuation of $9bn.\nHowever, both firms will remain invested. They took $2.3bn off the table as part of the Spac deal, but rolled over $3.29bn, while the Spac itself put in $1.467bn.\nThe PIPE investment (private investment in public equity) closed at the same time injected a further $2bn, with cornerstones from Foley-affiliated entities Cannae Holdings and Trasimene Capital Management, and outside capital from Fidelity, Third Point, and Maplelane Asset Management.\nAlongside the term loan and bond refi, the company will have a new $305m revolver in place following the closing of the deal.\nSpac-driven M&amp;A activity is increasingly\u00a0feeding through to leveraged credit markets and to CLO portfolios, as sponsor-owned companies become targets for SPAC acquisitions. The equity raised through this route usually deleverages the company, meaning loan repayments or refinancings tighter \u2014 in some cases, helping take out loans trading at low levels at par.\nPaysafe\u2019s existing euro loan already had a margin of 325bp, the wide end of the new guidance, but it also had outstanding second lien debt of $200m and \u20ac214m in its original LBO capital structure, which paid 725bp and 700bp respectively and have now been repaid.",

Always getting in to late, holding to long...yadda yadda..always failing to catch that  early point of entry, before they take off.  Fascinating stuff, if anyone can figure out a sure fire method of picking these, there is some serious money to be made.

And that valve index, does it have same day delivery from steam? Price matching?",

        "body": "&gt;Can I come in?\" Said the Salesman.\r  \n\r  \n\"Why certainly, have a seat in the parlor. I'll just be a moment\"\r  \n\r  \nI gripped the doorknob to the bedroom just opposite the kitchen and down the hall from the parlor, and stepped inside. I removed my apron with a flourish, I spent far more time in it than my fashionable casual clothes. The floral canvas material made a \\*thwap\\* sound as I folded it with machinelike precision.\r  \n\r  \nI kicked off my dumpy flats, spritzed myself with a bit of Chanel, and reapplied my lipstick. I dropped the dull beige dress I'd been wearing, admiring the soft flowing patterns of white lace on my lingerie. It felt silly to wear it during housework, but it made me feel alive. I threw on my royal purple Peignoir, popped a cigarette in the gilded cigarette tip David gave me for Christmas.\r  \n\r  \nFinally I tightened the straps on my long forgotten stilettos, and strutted to the kitchen, briefly passing the parlor, where the salesman waited patient clutching his porkpie hat. In my haste the top of the robe slipped a bit, and I felt his momentary glance dance over my exposed shoulders.\r  \n\r  \nClicking my heels with delight, I raced toward the corner. From the window I could see the July sun beaming down on our emerald green yard, My fingers clung to the icebox, ripping open the door like a puma tearing into an unsuspecting doe. Like a factory robot assembling its 10,000th radio, I prepared a highball. Lemon Wedge. Ice Cubes. Club soda. Scotch, In a frosty tall glass.\r  \n\r  \nMy feel stalked slowly now into the parlor, with ice cubes clinking in the artisan glass David had purchased on a business trip to Paris. He bragged to his poker buddies about all the time, but today Sam the Salesman would be enjoying its handblown curvatures.\r  \n\r  \n\"Would you like a drink Sam?\" I asked rhetorically, pushing the glass toward his chest. He didn't decline of course.\r  \n\r  \n\"Why thank you ma'am.\" He muttered. Sam seemed a bit flustered, adorably so. The young man could barely grow a mustache, which now twitched at the sight of the bare leg stretching towards him from the split in the robe.\r  \n\r  \n\"Mrs. Carter. I'm sure a home spouse such as yourself, often despairs at the sight of stains. With Sergeant Scrubbers patented, full lather, color-safe, lavender scented, gentle, one-of-a-kind, detergent, you will never see a lingering spot, stain, or mark on your clothes, linens, or undergarments.\"\r  \n\r  \nMy expression dropped, wincing in shock. I was more than a little bit angry.\r  \n\r  \n\"Is something wrong Mrs. Carter?\" Sam was perspiring. He was new to this job and wasn't prepared for his faux pas.\r  \n\r  \n\"What did you call me? A...a 'house spouse'? Why would you use that word?\"\r  \n\r  \nI pulled the chrome lighter from my Pegnoir pocket, and sparked up a small flame and thrust my cigarette into it. A deep drag filled my lungs. Like a wrathful dragon, a cloud of wiry smoke poured from my nostrils and flowed into air above. A haze began to blur the lime green and chrome of the parlor.\r  \n\r  \n\" I...I..I was trying to use gender neutral language. I meant no offense.\"\r  \n\r  \n\"Let me tell you something Samuel. I grew up a boy. Everyone mocked me when I chose a color considered 'feminine. My father sent me to join Scouts, where my friend's father touched me in the tent where I was supposed to learn to 'be a man'. Father never believed me'\r  \n\r  \nBut you see, I never felt like a man. I've always felt the drums of some forgotten goddess thundering through my heart and my loins. I grew my hair long, I paid for expensive surgeries. I had to beat back men who wanted to kill me, because they wanted to end their attraction to me. Through it all, I knew that one day everyone would finally see me as I am. I am a woman. I have faced terrible injustices for the right to be called a 'housewife' . Please don't take that away from me.\" I puffed another long drag.\r  \n\r  \n\"Mrs. Carter... I'm certain you're an amazing housewife.\" He looked up nervously to me like a young lion with a thin mane at the senior female of a passing pride.\r  \n\r  \nThe salesman buggered my tight asshole with his throbbing youthful cockmeat. I never felt more like a real woman. A jangle of keys permeated briefly betixt my moans. The door creaked open. David was home.",

Years down the line, the same title will be sold for a fraction of the price on their own platform... and that's it.\n\nWhy the focus on the amount of times a digital title can earn the publisher money? The incremental costs of producing additional copies of a digital game are near 0.\n\n&gt; A small percentage off tens of thousands of resales of an old or obsolete title that is no longer offered in the publisher's own catalogue vs. buying the game from the publishers' own old game discount bin for a few bucks... again, once? Might not make sense initially, but especially in the used / old game market those small revenue streams would add up: especially when compared to a scenario where users would not otherwise buy the game.\n\nI still don't see the incentive for a publisher to cannibalize their own sales. As an example, Fallout: New Vegas was released in 2010 on Steam and other digital platforms. It cost $59.99 then. \n\nToday, Fallout: New Vegas is available on Steam for $9.99. A person that wants a copy of the game can buy it today. The publisher will receive the same percentage cut of the $9.99 sale that they received from the $59.99 sale.\n\nLet's now assume that Gamestop has a digital NFT token that allows resale of digital games. Someone in 2010 buys the game for $59.99, and today sells its for $9.99. The publisher receives a cut of the $9.99 sale, in addition to the original $59.99 sale.\n\nThe problem here is, what's the difference to the publisher? They receive the same amount of money from the sales. The keys to sell a second copy of the game have already been generated and sent to Steam for resale, so there's no incremental cost there. The NFT resale is basically cannibalizing a new sale.\n\n&gt; drive up scarcity of used titles? Release special NFT collector's versions of certain titles which are unlikely to ever go down in price due to extreme rarity?\n\n&gt; Especially the latter: think Magic the Gathering and take the Black Lotus card as an example. If you could release a fixed amount of those into the wild and get a cut for each and every high-price resale of those decades down the line... wouldn't you?\n\nI can see the argument/value for NFT sales of collectible items intended to be artificially scarce. Maybe not a multibillion dollar market, but definitely a possible avenue for revenue growth.\n\n I don't see the argument for driving artificial scarcity for regular, non collectible digital games. Even in the pre digital games, the games that were scarce were driven by production costs, and not by publishers attempting to drive up prices by limiting availability.",

        "body": "\nPaysafe preps post-Spac\u00a0refi\n\u00a0\n\n02 Jun 2021\n\nFintech payments provider Paysafe has launched a refinancing of its remaining credit facilities, following its $9bn merger with a Bill Foley-controlled Spac, which closed in March. The merger and its accompanying PIPE allowed the firm to pay down debt and cut its leverage, and now it wants to lock in the benefits with a lower-cost refi.\n\nJP Morgan is sole physical bookrunner on the dollar and euro term loans, totalling $1.026bn between the currencies. This will be followed with an equal sized slug of bonds in dollar and euros, yet to be launched.\nTalk on both tranches is 300bp-325bp at 99.5, with a 25bp margin step-down if the firm hits 3.7 times net leverage, half a turn below its present level, according to the loan marketing materials.\nLenders have successfully pushed back on proposed margin ratchet terms \u2014\u00a0including Cerba, for example \u2014 but these are generally deals which started with more aggressive terms, such as multiple step-downs for each quarter-turn of leverage. Deals with 25bp for half a turn have largely sailed through.\n\"It's a real economic term and something investors can easily rally around,\" said a leveraged finance syndicate banker. \"Some of the other docs points can be a bit of a niche interest but this is universal.\"\nPaysafe earmarked \u20ac1.25bn-equivalent of its outstanding debt for repayment as part of the merger, which closed at the end of March. The company said in\u00a0its introduction to equity market analysts\u00a0that it would have net leverage of 3.6-3.8 times on its 2021 earnings following the transaction \u2014 suggesting it intends to activate the margin step-down quickly.\nIt will, however, be going on the acquisition trail as well. Outlining the deal to analysts, Foley said: \u201cOne of the keys to this transaction and value creation for our shareholders is the reduction of Paysafe\u2019s leverage ratio to 3.6 times. As Paysafe continues to grow and generate cash flow, that leverage ratio will continue to come down creating even more opportunity to pursue accretive M&amp;A opportunities.\u201d\nMoody\u2019s estimated leverage at 5.2 times on March 2021 numbers, after backing out some of the company\u2019s adjustments.\nBased on its expected 2021 Ebitda, the business was 6-6.2 times levered at the end of last year, with net debt of $2.99bn, incurred when Blackstone and CVC took the firm private in 2017. The sponsors scored a huge win with the transaction, paying \u00a33bn for the company and selling it on at a valuation of $9bn.\nHowever, both firms will remain invested. They took $2.3bn off the table as part of the Spac deal, but rolled over $3.29bn, while the Spac itself put in $1.467bn.\nThe PIPE investment (private investment in public equity) closed at the same time injected a further $2bn, with cornerstones from Foley-affiliated entities Cannae Holdings and Trasimene Capital Management, and outside capital from Fidelity, Third Point, and Maplelane Asset Management.\nAlongside the term loan and bond refi, the company will have a new $305m revolver in place following the closing of the deal.\nSpac-driven M&amp;A activity is increasingly\u00a0feeding through to leveraged credit markets and to CLO portfolios, as sponsor-owned companies become targets for SPAC acquisitions. The equity raised through this route usually deleverages the company, meaning loan repayments or refinancings tighter \u2014 in some cases, helping take out loans trading at low levels at par.\nPaysafe\u2019s existing euro loan already had a margin of 325bp, the wide end of the new guidance, but it also had outstanding second lien debt of $200m and \u20ac214m in its original LBO capital structure, which paid 725bp and 700bp respectively and have now been repaid.",
