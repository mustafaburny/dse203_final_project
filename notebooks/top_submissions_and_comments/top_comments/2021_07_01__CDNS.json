Therefore, I laughed a bit of the initial valuation. I have bought near the IPO at $19.27 and accumulated until it was my second biggest position when it dropped from \\~$40+ to $34. I have sold half at $80, bought back at $67 and sold everything at $102.\r  \n\r  \nCloudflare is the better one between the two in my professional experience. Cloudflare is also a \"sort-of\" moat since they invested a lot in CDN infrastructure and it's extremely hard even for AMZN/MSFT/GOOGL to close in on them.\r  \n\r  \nRight now they are extremely overvalued and I would wait for it to drop to at least $50-60. Assuming they turn on the money printer at \\~33% profit margin and keep on growing the revenue 50% YoY (which is extremely far-fetched IMO), only after 5 years will they reach a fair value for the market cap that they have today ($35B with $7.5B in revenue and $2.5B in earnings). For 40% growth YoY it will take them 8 years, whereas for 30% it will take them almost 11 years.\r  \n\r  \nThere are far better valued companies (including tech stocks).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIMO, FSLY is a much better value right now compared to NET.

This is where noting support and resistance and share-price cadence on the chart could come in handy. But you never know. Managing credit spreads, debit spreads, calendar spreads, long calls, and long puts is tough. Lots of folks adhere to strict strategies to exit and close out and cut losses or take profit. I'm still in the process of refining my approach, which at this point is a little chaotic and inconsistent, and relies heavily on my intuition and gut!  Everyone will eventually find their own zone and strategy based on their own trial and error and risk tolerance.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSELLING puts and calls (wheel method) is currently my favorite approach. You don't have to monitor the fluctuating values daily to the same degree as the approaches mentioned above (though I do anyway). But, of course, I personally can't do that with stocks like NVDA that are super expensive, which is the whole point of your post!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf the stock is tanking, you'll want to factor the time till expiration and do your best to gauge which way the wind will be blowing! It sucks to back out early and close out for a small loss only to see the stock rally back up above your short call strike. But a small loss might be better than a potential large loss. Trying to find a put credit spread that has a max buy back loss of $250 (difference between strikes of your short and long legs (i.e. $735 / $737.5)) might be better than one that is $500 (my suggested example above) which can help mitigate the downside.",
