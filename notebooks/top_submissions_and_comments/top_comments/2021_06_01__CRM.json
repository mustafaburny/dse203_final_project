        "body": "Credits to /u/ixamnis\n\n\" Here are some that I like. By no means an exhaustive list:\n\n**QQQ** \\- This one uses the NASDAQ 100 as its benchmark. Obviously it's an Indexed, non-managed ETF. XTF used to rate this one as a perfect 10.0 out of 10 rating, but recently dropped it to 9.9 out of 10. It has one of the highest rates of return over the past 10 years of any ETF. It does tend to be tech-heavy, especially with the FAANG +M stocks.  (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Google and Microsoft).  Other top holdings include TSLA, NVDA and ADBE.  (The rating dropped recently when the portfolio of the NASDAQ 100 was re-balanced).\n\n**VXUS** \\- Vanguard Total International Index Fund ETF - top holdings include BABA, Tencent, Samsung, Taiwan Semiconductors, Novartis, Toyota. This is a broad market fund investing only in companies overseas.  I'm not generally bullish on foreign markets, but this one is a very solid ETF with some companies that are likely to do extremely well for the foreseeable future.  XTF rates this one a perfect 10.0 out of 10.\n\nAt the suggestion of u/Here4TheCatPics, I'm also going to include **EFA** and **EEM**. These are Emerging Markets ETFs.  Both have some crossover in their top holdings with VXUS. **EFA** is rated 9.6/10 by XTF Analysts and **EEM** is rated only 5.7/10. **EEM** appears to be heavily invested in the Chinese market with Alibaba and TenCent the top two holdings. It also holds quite a bit of cash for an ETF. **EFA** appears to be more tilted toward the European market. \n\n**VOO**/**SPY** \\- **VOO** and **SPY** are non-managed funds indexed to the S&amp;P 500 Index. These funds are very popular on this subreddit, for good reason. They are well diversified, broad market funds investing in mostly US stocks. XTF rates these funds at 9.6 out of 10 because their return on investment over the long term is somewhat tempered by some of the blue chip stocks in the funds. But those stocks also help reduce volatility relative to some other ETFs. These are solid investments, but keep in mind that in the top 10 holdings there will be a lot of crossover between these funds and other broad market funds that hold US stocks like **QQQ**, **VTI**, **VTG**, **VOOG** and **SPYG**.  There are differences, of course, as well, but you always want to know where those duplications exist.\n\n**IWF** \\- This is a Russell 1000 indexed fund. It is one of my favorites that doesn't get talked about much. It does have a lot of crossover with the other funds mentioned above, but the mix is slightly different.  I would describe this fund as more aggressive than **VOO/SPY**, less volatile than **QQQ**.\n\n**IWM** \\- for someone looking to diversify a little bit, this is a great fund to look into. This fund is a non-managed, indexed fund that uses the Russell 2000 index as its benchmark. The big difference between the Russell 2000 index and many of the the other indexes is that the Russell 2000 index looks at small and mid-cap companies, rather than large-cap companies.  Thus, there is zero crossover between this one and the funds mentioned above. While this fund will move up and down with the market, it is often less volatile than the market overall. If you look at the charts, this fund has under-performed some of the other funds over the past few months while the market has been very volatile in an upward direction, but in a crash, this fund would probably outperform the rest of the market.  It has a 9.0/10 XTF rating.\n\nThere are also some sector funds you may want to look at:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**ICLN**/**TAN/FAN** \\- These funds are clean/renewable energy ETFs. ICLN is more broad while TAN focuses more specifically on solar energy and FAN specifically on wind generated energy. I think renewable energy companies are the future. There is no crossover in the top holdings of this fund with the top holdings of QQQ and most of the other broad market funds. Also, these are global, not just US based companies.  QCLN and PBW are also renewable energy funds, but they also contain a lot of TSLA, NIO and W.K. H.S. in their top holdings making them \"electric vehicle\" funds, as well.  No problem if you want to add that, but you'll find a lot of Tesla in some of the funds mentioned above.\n\n**ARK** group of funds: **ARKG**, **ARKF**, **ARKK ARKW**, **ARKQ**, **PRNT** and **IZRL**. These are managed funds investing in companies that invest in disruptive companies in their respective industries. Most posters on this subreddit are bullish on these funds. They are aggressive growth ETFs, but should be considered somewhat risky and volatile.\n\n* ARKG - Genomic Revolution\n* ARKF - Fintech\n* ARKK - Disruptive Companies (broader market)\n* ARKW - Internet/computer/technology  (Telsa is a top holding)\n* ARKQ - Robotics and artificial intelligence\n* PRNT - 3D printing technology\n* IZRL - disruptive companies based in Israel\n\nXL series of funds.  Similar to the ARK series, these tend to be more aggressive growth funds, however these are passively managed indexed funds with various benchmarks that usually are overloaded in the better companies within a sector:\n\n* **XLV** \\- Health Care\n* **XLK** \\- Technology\n* **XLY** \\- Consumer Discretionary\n* **XLF** \\- Financial\n* **XLU** \\- Utilities\n\nAt the suggestion of u/Shaun8030, I'm adding Cloud Computing as another sector to consider.  Some tickers in that sector include:  **WCLD**, **SKYY**, **CLOU**, **BUG** and **XIKT**. Of these **WCLD** has the best 52 week performance.  Top holdings in **WCLD** include **ZM**, **PLAN**, **CRM**, **CRWD**, **ZEN**, **WDAY**, **TENB**, **PCTY**, **DDOG**, **BL**.  Many of these are likely to also appear in **QQQ**, however, they would be in very small percentages as the Cap on these companies is much smaller.\n\nRead through the comments below. Many users have posted some other great suggestions, as well.\n\n***A nice portfolio might look something like this:***\n\n20% - Broad market US fund such as QQQ, VOO or IWF\n\n20% - VXUS - International\n\n20% - IWM - Small/Mid-cap broad market fund\n\n10% each in four sector funds of your choice\n\nHope this helps.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*I'm not a financial expert or advisor and this is not financial advice, just an opinion from a random internet person.  I do own shares in several, but not all of the funds listed above, including QQQ, IWF, some ARK funds, ICLN, VXUS, etc.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**EDIT:**  WOW! Thanks for the awards and the positive comments.  I appreciate the feedback.  I hope this advice really helps some people.\"",

        "body": "This is one of the most frequent questions we got during our PIPE roadshows and your answer is basically correct\u2014it is far more effective to work with partners.\r  \n\r  \nMicrosoft has the biggest partner ecosystem in the industry. It has hundreds of thousands of partners across their various lines of business. Microsoft is very good at establishing a platform and relies on partners to complement and extend their offerings. \n\n\r  \nAvePoint is very good at inventing *with* Microsoft instead of inventing *versus* Microsoft. AvePoint sits on multiple Microsoft product councils, has 3 Microsoft Regional Directors on staff (a special designation Microsoft reserves for the most trusted 200 or so third-party voices on their solutions), and works closely with Microsoft to understand their development roadmap so our investments extend what Microsoft is doing and planning to do vs duplicating. \n\n\r  \nMicrosoft and every big cloud collaboration platform depend on a strong partner ecosystem. It\u2019s very difficult to build a solution that meets the needs and use cases of every single type of organization and hundreds of millions of users while remaining simple and easy to use. Their business model is predicated on building solutions that cover 80 percent and having their partner ecosystem build the last mile. Again, that is how AvePoint has grown for 20 years.\n\n\r  \nAdditionally, AvePoint is investing in more vertical solutions like EduTech as well as additional collaboration platforms like Salesforce and Google Workspace. The AvePoint solution portfolio is very deep and broad.

        "body": "20 years old, Portfolio review\n\nI wanted to get opinions from strangers on the internet about my holdings. I am 20 years old and currently attending university. Additionally I am an E4 in the NG and employed part time at a grocery chain earning $15 hourly. I live at home still but plan to move back up to university next year.\n\nRETIREMENT: I deployed with my National Guard unit and put a bit of money towards my TSP. The TSP is nice because of the contribution matching and the fact that I never notice the missing money. Last I checked I have about 11k of value inside it with $900(?) from employer contributions. I\u2019m back on drill status and putting 60% of my drill paychecks toward it. This is approximately $200 monthly with more from Annual training. In addition to this I started a ROTH IRA in 2020 while deployed and have $4,200 inside that. I have to put another $5k in it for FY2021 to max it out, which is top priority now.\n\nPORTFOLIO: Current value: 34.5k, 2.8k in unrealized gains. Pays 2.4k annually in dividends. I realize this is close to \u201cyield chasing\u201d and that I should aim to focus more on value. A year ago I had approximately 15k invested in F which wasn\u2019t the smartest decision but I sold at 50% gains which net me a lot more money. I still hold about 1.5k in F. Larger positions I hold are T, ABBV, CRT, TWO, WBA, GSDB, DAL, NVDA, HUBS, CRM, These make up 15k. ETFs/Funds I hold are QYLD, RYLD, PDI, VNQ, and SWYJX. These make up 18.5k.\n\nAs far as my goals go I would like to hit 50k in net assets in my Schwab account. To do this I need to save another 10k. I am aiming to hit it by 2022 which is ambitious I know. It\u2019s mostly a test to see how extreme I can get with saving and selling off stuff to downsize. If the market goes red of course it\u2019s not going to be possible. If I can get close to 50k I am satisfied. I need to max out my ROTH IRA for the year and focus on more quality value stocks inside my portfolio. I realize that I am well \u201cahead\u201d of my peers financially for this I have my deployment money, part time job, and some gift money to thank.",

I also love COIN as a long term boring hold and I also like PCT as another boring hold. \n\nI\u2019m starting to scale down risk and invest in more quality long term multibaggers. The 3 I just mentioned, I feel are good long holds. Full disclosure, don\u2019t own COIN or PCT, and I only hold like $500 in EDR.",
