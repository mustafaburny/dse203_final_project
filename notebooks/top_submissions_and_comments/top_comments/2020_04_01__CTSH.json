Even without the SEC investigation, this stock hit .30 a month ago and came crashing down to .06. I should have realized when it was at .40 that it was going to crash down. I was planning on selling the rest of my shares this morning, but yea, as we all know we are forced to wait May 7th. Outside of FDA approval and vindication with the investigation, this stock is going way down.",

After filing taxes for the first time, I noticed on my 1099 that my SWSSX LT capital gains were about 15 times higher than that of SWTSX -- which was pretty surprising to me.\n\nAs I become more cognizant of the tax implications of certain funds, I was wondering:\n\n1. Would it be a good idea to sell my holdings in SWSSX and use that money to purchase its ETF equivalent, SCHA, which appears to be more tax efficient?\n2. Is there any downside to simply holding on to my shares in SWSSX and simply purchase shares in SCHA going forward? In other words, is there any downside to holding both the mutual fund and ETF of the same small cap index?\n\nThanks in advance!",

        "body": "My amateur theory is that it's politics. 9/11 was 3k+ dead and it stopped the world because we could blame it on someone. If you can blame it on a terrorist a capable politician can unite the country and convince them to mourn.\n\nRight now you have an apolitical enemy and the only blame can go toward the administration. This isn't ALL their fault, of course, but they clearly have been fucking it up a lot more than they've done right with the typical Trump admin ineptitude... so true to their nature the last 3 years, the administration goes into defensive mode. Which means the 1/2 of America under Trump's spell follows that and thinks we're on the verge of bouncing back, despite 50,000 dead people. Doesn't help the virus is tending to affect liberal cities more. \n\nAnd part of that CYA effort is the bailout, which of course Dems won't refuse either even if they're cognizant of Trump's awful handling of this mess and the reality that there's no easy way out of this.\n\nThe markets don't really CARE about politics vis-a-vis politics. I mean I guess they like Republicans more than regulators. But all that matters to them is political allyship. So the bad news on the virus front is being covered up by hope or ignorance on the right, and the bailout in economic terms and that's all you need for this weird spot we're in where the market has 1) support of the Fed and politicians and 2) the American public doesn't seem to care. I think the market has **just enough** to sustain it. If this were a terrorist takeover or a war, or a different time politically, I think it'd be totally different. If the American public was freaking out like it should be over this, I think the market would be deep in the red.",

Knowing what you know? Can you stomach losses of 20-50%+ and still believe that this is a good investment? \n\n&gt; And how you approach these answers should inform how you go about your diligence process, because your diligence process is really there to make you feel comfortable. Something that I personally like to do, that I wish I was more consistent at, was writing pre-mortem and post-mortems regarding the investments I make. \n\n&gt; Perhaps, that approach can work well for you as well, as you learn to take on Mr. Market.\n\nWriting pre-mortem and post-mortems regarding your investments allows you to take a more systematic approach to stocks with already planned my entries and exits without focusing on the emotion. \n\nIf you ever want to get better at the consistency of hitting singles, doubles and triples, start tracking your options plays down via a journal using the above pre-/post-moretem method. If you feel like a physical journal is a little too cumbersome, you can check out our website www.poolsapp.com\n\nCognizant that not everyone has access to a full service broker, we also have options price history, shown here https://www.poolsapp.com/pool/HYfEmdtDkNRlKEq8V7Ns for the positions so that people can more easily interact with the plays and you can use our platform as you learn by simulating long-term trading. \n\nLet me know if you have any questions about this, and feel free to reach out any time on /r/PoolsApp and I'll get a notification.",
