This isn't ALL their fault, of course, but they clearly have been fucking it up a lot more than they've done right with the typical Trump admin ineptitude... so true to their nature the last 3 years, the administration goes into defensive mode.

I mean I guess they like Republicans more than regulators. But all that matters to them is political allyship. So the bad news on the virus front is being covered up by hope or ignorance on the right, and the bailout in economic terms and that's all you need for this weird spot we're in where the market has 1) support of the Fed and politicians and 2) the American public doesn't seem to care. I think the market has **just enough** to sustain it. If this were a terrorist takeover or a war, or a different time politically, I think it'd be totally different.

        "body": "OWNERS: Have a Heart Compassionate Care dispensaries were not economically feasible to operate\nRobert Connelly Mar 31, 2020 Updated Apr 1, 2020 \n\nIndustry experts say Iowa and federal medical marijuana regulations make it difficult to operate a dispensary in the state. Their comments come as the Iowa Quad-Cities' only medical cannabidiol dispensary closed suddenly Monday.\n\nHave a Heart Compassionate Care dispensaries in Davenport had opened in late 2018. Its Council Bluffs location also closed Monday.\n\nHarvest Health &amp; Recreation Inc. said Have a Heart Iowa, LLC, elected to cease operations after determining it was no longer economically feasible to operate.\n\n\u201cHarvest Health &amp; Recreation Inc., through a recently acquired subsidiary, provided support services to Have a Heart Iowa. Harvest\u2019s subsidiary plans to terminate its support services agreement with Have a Heart Iowa following its decision to close the dispensaries,\u201d Harvest Health said.\n\nIowa Department of Public Health officials are looking to assist patients and caregivers who used the two locations and \u201cwill work to license two new dispensaries as soon as possible,\u201d according to a department news release.\n\nPatients seeking guidance can call (515) 725-2576.\n\nNo notice\nOwen Parker, the program manager of Iowa\u2019s office of medical cannibiodal, said state law asks for six months\u2019 notice for closure, which did not happen.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to do our best because we weren\u2019t given that,\u201d he said.\n\nState officials are drafting request for proposal documents for the now-vacant dispensary licenses. Parker said license applicants get to choose the location, so the new licenses may not be in the same areas.\n\nThe timeline is currently being worked on, and the COVID-19 outbreak could alter the time it takes to get the two dispensaries operating.\n\nMedPharm Iowa, which operates Iowa's only cultivation center and other dispensaries attempted to buy or acquire the two Have a Heart Compassion Care dispensaries last year., Lucas Nelson, general manager of MedPharm Iowa, said. That plan was denied by the Iowa Department of Health in November 2019.\n\nHave a Heart was acquired by Harvest Health, Parker said.\n\nNelson said MedPharm will \u201clikely\u201d apply for those two licenses.\n\nTwo dispensaries closing is a \u201cconcern about the health\" of the young industry in Iowa, Nelson said.\n\n\u201cAt the same time, we have seen some really incredible results for the majority of our patients,\" Nelson said. \"We know the good work it can do and the good work it can do for patients so I don\u2019t know a scenario where we would not make an application on those.\u201d\n\nLegislative actions stalled\nThe closure comes as Iowa legislators continue to debate increasing the THC level of products in the state program. MedPharm has been vocal in that debate for two years.\n\n\u201cThis is probably another piece of evidence that we need some improvements to the program for this to survive,\u201d Nelson said. The \u201clong-term sustainability of this program is at risk without improvement \u2026 we've got to make some improvements if this thing is going to last long-term.\u201d\n\nThe Quad-Cities market is also complicated by the legalization of recreational marijuana in Illinois.\n\nAndrew Livingston, director of economics and research at Vicente Sederberg LLP in Colorado, is co-host of the \u201cWeed Wonks\u201d podcast and cannabis industry veteran. He said the dispensary closures in Iowa, though rare, is a confluence of factors.\n\nPart of the issue is legal marijuana businesses, whether adult-use and/or medical, need more capital in a restrictive market such as Iowa. But businesses, and capital investment, is currently under a crunch with the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nCannabis businesses can only use private investment, they can\u2019t access banks, and financial institution resources, as the national Safe Banking Act has stalled in U.S. Congress which would have opened up banks for cannabis businesses. So they have to circle back to investors in the first year or two to stay afloat as the market develops and grows, Livingston said.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing right now is a combination of hesitancy of the investors within the cannabis space, generally, over the last six to eight months, and that, combined with the current investment freeze that has been occurring due to this outbreak, means there is no more water left in that well,\u201d Livingston said.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t have any more potential investment to keep your lights running and you\u2019re not making enough money to continue to pay your staff, you have to close. There\u2019s no other option,\" he said.\n\nAnd that further compounds things for the Quad-Cities market, because Illinois operators may want to instead focus resources there, because of the robust medical program and growing adult-use market.\n\nLivingston further said the reduction in assets within the cannabis business segment is something Iowa, and its legislators, need to be cognizant of moving forward.\n\n\u201cIowans understand business and they understand tight profit margins, because it\u2019s a farming state. And they understand business needs a certain amount of revenue to run and pay its employees, particularly when you\u2019re setting up a new system that\u2019s restrictive,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201c\u2026 I would basically encourage them to consider ways to ease the operational burden and increase the potential for revenue for these medical cannabidiol businesses in Iowa so that they can continue to serve patients across the state.\u201d\n\nIowa state Sen. Joe Bolkcom, D-Iowa City, has been vocal about increasing the THC cap in Iowa for the state\u2019s medical program.\n\n\u201cIowa has the most bureaucratic, expensive and ineffective program in the country and it just got worse. The medicine is expensive and it\u2019s too hard to get people qualified,\u201d he said Tuesday.\n\n\u201cMore evidence is now in with two of our dispensaries essentially going out of business because it\u2019s economically not feasible.\u201d\n\nThe Iowa City Democrat points to the low THC cap making it hard to generate revenue for the program to work properly. While the Iowa House had passed a bill further restricting Iowa\u2019s program, the state Senate had only gotten a bill out of committee before things ground to a halt due to COVID-19.\n\nIf the Iowa House bill moves forward, Bolkcom said it would be bad for Iowans.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s good for Illinois because Iowa patients will go over to Illinois, albeit illegally, to get medicine that\u2019s more effective that\u2019s cheaper \u2026 unfortunately we\u2019ll turn them into lawbreakers to manage their chronic conditions.\u201d",

Knowing what you know? Can you stomach losses of 20-50%+ and still believe that this is a good investment? \n\n&gt; And how you approach these answers should inform how you go about your diligence process, because your diligence process is really there to make you feel comfortable. Something that I personally like to do, that I wish I was more consistent at, was writing pre-mortem and post-mortems regarding the investments I make. \n\n&gt; Perhaps, that approach can work well for you as well, as you learn to take on Mr. Market.\n\nWriting pre-mortem and post-mortems regarding your investments allows you to take a more systematic approach to stocks with already planned my entries and exits without focusing on the emotion. \n\nIf you ever want to get better at the consistency of hitting singles, doubles and triples, start tracking your options plays down via a journal using the above pre-/post-moretem method. If you feel like a physical journal is a little too cumbersome, you can check out our website www.poolsapp.com\n\nCognizant that not everyone has access to a full service broker, we also have options price history, shown here https://www.poolsapp.com/pool/HYfEmdtDkNRlKEq8V7Ns for the positions so that people can more easily interact with the plays and you can use our platform as you learn by simulating long-term trading. \n\nLet me know if you have any questions about this, and feel free to reach out any time on /r/PoolsApp and I'll get a notification.",

        "body": "Yea that's a good question (tldr at end).  For some stocks it can be like 5+ years.  For sure, Tesla won't realize it's fundamentals until like 5+ years, and even then, it can pull a MSFT in which it goes from a blue chip to a blue chip + growth stock (with Azure), in which case, it still may not fully realize that part of it's fundamentals until we know how big cloud will be.\n\nBut when I invest, my target is always like 2+ years for all my stocks and for the stock market as a whole.  That's why I've always been buying this entire time, since even though we can definitely sell off short term back to say 240, I know long term, the stock market will be better than 280.  More importantly, I am confident the individual stocks I pick will be better than what they are currently longer term.  That's why a DCA approach is a fairly standard and safe approach.  Of course, you can adjust this DCA approach to be way more aggressive on drops and less aggressive on up moves (like buy way less on a day like today, if today was your set buying date).  I don't worry about the market going down short term for my long term investments.  Plus, if you look, so many tech stocks, like MSFT, AMZN, NVDA, NFLX, etc. are all up for the year despite this!\n\nNow, for trading, you can also trade the fundamentals in the short term - which would be months here.  If you believe the economy will be slower to return to work, if the Q1 and Q2 earnings will be bad, if the vaccine will take longer than normal, if social distincing in a way still continues even after we open up, if consumer demand is less, if the credit problem comes back, etc., or some combination of that, you can trade that.  So for example, you can buy like a 3 month 15% OTM put or something.  Perhaps you believe QQQ &gt; IWM (that's what I believe), so in that case, maybe if you are long QQQ, you can short IWM as a market hedge.  So many ways to trade that.\n\ntldr: \n\nTrading should be on either short term TECHNIALS (days - weeks) or short term FUNDAMENTALS (which will be months)\n\nInvesting should be on long term FUNDAMENTALS (which will be years).  I'm a believer in the US Economy and particularly the tech sector and a few non-tech stocks like COST, so I will always invest when I have the chance to do so, without having to always try to predict the bottom.  Predicting the bottom or the top is best used in the above trading section.",

        "body": "Jesus H Christ. There is so much conspiracy theory in here that it would be impossible to maintain if this was even remotely true. The fact of markets is that its driven by 80% financial institutions who are not barred from holding short positions. The market is irrational in the short term, but its never irrational long term. \n\nTake a look at the VIX, its at 42. This implies that SPY can move 12% up or down as driven by premium prices. This means that the underwriters of options (the guys you buy options from) are pricing in this movement. Now lets look at SPY's movement the last 2 weeks, gee what do you know? its moved up 12% well within the expected volatility of the market. \n\nThis means that the SPY index can swing up or down 12% within this month, and it will mean absolutely NOTHING. It would be considered random noise.\n\nNow during the last 2 weeks we've had 2 uncertainties become certain.\n\n1. PPP was activated and disbursed\n2. Fed commited to buying Equity based securities\n\nThese were the 2 big driving factors of the gains.\n\nNow if you scrutinized the winners and losers of the last 2 weeks of gains, you can notice a theme. Companies like MSFT/AMD/NVDA/Netflix are rewarded. Can you think of a rational reason why that is? Compared to say BA? This is proof the market is evaluating companies rationally corp to corp.\n\nNext, I want all the bears to understand that in the history of 100 years of equity movement, the stocks only moved down 4% of the time ( vs 96% of the time up) and in addition, bear markets only lasted 200 days on average. With the way algos reacted and the fed, you can expect this bear market to be compressed at LEAST by a factor of 2. Lets say 100 days. Now we've had market reaction for over 60 days now. this means, we are likely already halfway through this market correction statistically.\n\nKnowing the above quantifications, how many are actually brave enough to continue to short? It makes no sense logically given the above.",

Then buy puts against the shares so if we do go down soon you\u2019ll have cash to buy more shares on down days. Over time you\u2019ll be rich, alternatively buy long calls instead of shares. Always at least a month out. \n\n\nBuy the oil dip, airline dip, hotel dip. But don\u2019t expect bug returns in the short term. \n\nFinally. Don\u2019t listen to advice on this sub. The confirmation bias here is god tier.",

Laying off at least half of our dick beating workforce will save us enough cash to be able to start buying back shares of our stonks again, boosting EPS by {UNREASONABLE\\_PERCENTAGE}.\n\nThanks to the free money printer, we haven't had to outlay much working capital to continue to pay our work from home employees, as JPOW has been cranking that money crank till his eyes started bleeding and he had to hire an intern to take over.  In addition, team JPOW has been buying up our high yield bonds that we've been issuing, further preparing us to continue our very efficient stonk buyback program.\n\nWhile we can't issue guidance at this time, we all here at {COMPANY} want you to know that we are very excited about what 2021 is going to look like.",

        "body": "For me the 3 companies I regret not investing in was Microsoft, Monster Energy and ethereum (not exactly a company I know).\n\n \n\nMicrosoft:\n\nIn 2005 I discovered the stock market for the first time at 16 and I wanted to invest but back then I thought investing was super risky, basically gambling like playing slots... Anyway I had \u00a3500 that I had got from my family for getting certain grades at school and after looking at a list of companies I decided I was going to invest in Microsoft only to discover that I wasn't old enough to open an account.\n\nA year later and by the time I was old enough I had completely forgotten all about it and had blown the money on clothes, a swanky new Motorola Razr and other assorted material goods.\n\n \n\nMonster Energy:\n\nThen I got my first job in 2007 after finishing my A-Levels and by late 2008 I had a few thousand in savings. The housing crash had really started kicking in and everyone was terrified the world was ending so I had about \u00a32000 in savings but was terrified to invest in the stock market. Nevertheless my curiosity made me look into what things were looking like and again I was looking at a bunch of companies and remember looking back at Microsoft thinking \"wow I'm so glad I didn't invest in Microsoft back in 2005 \" as it was currently down about 30% from when I was going to invest in 2005.\n\nAs a huge Monster Energy drinker back then, that was one of the companies I looked at and had it not been for the huge crash, I probably would have bought in just because I enjoyed the beverage...\n\n \n\nEthereum:\n\nThe next 8 years or so it never occurred to me to think about investing again and so I just spent money like it was going out of fashion until I quit my job and decided to look for a new career. I decided upon programming (never stuck with it) and somehow I remember stumbling onto bitcoin on a programming forum. I first heard about bitcoin back when it was selling for a dollar but I literally thought it was some scammy game currency people were selling like runscape gold so I didn't do any research into it at all.\n\nAnyways I decided to check the price and my mind was blown... $250 bitcoin, like what the fuck! Of course this got me very interest until I heard about Mt Gox and it was crashing so thought the scam was over. I came into contact with Ethereum, which at the time had just ICO'd and was about $2 but I was still sceptical, if bitcoin was a scam, then surely the thing copying bitcoin is a scam... right?\n\nI was uneducated at the time and didn't know much about any of this stuff. I watched ethereum on and off and watched it \"crash\" from $2 to $0.40 and was very smug that I didn't fall for the scam... Again I had forgotten about it completely until a few years later and long story short, I fomo'd into ethereum at $250 in 2017 after doing a lot of research, I rode the wave all the way up to $1400, didn't take any profit, ended up selling at $250 in 2018... It took me 12 years to pluck up the courage to invest in something since first discovering investing and it was a damn cryptocurrency \ud83e\udd74\n\n \n\nBut if I did invest in Microsoft, Monster and Ethereum and held my positions, to this day I'd have:\n\nMicorsoft: \u00a3500 @ ~$25 = \u00a33,200 (560%)\n\nMonster Energy: \u00a32000 @ ~$4 = \u00a330,600 (1404%)\n\nEthereum: (probably would have only invested \u00a3100 or so) @ $2 = \u00a37613 (7513%).\n\n \n\nSo what stories do you have?",
