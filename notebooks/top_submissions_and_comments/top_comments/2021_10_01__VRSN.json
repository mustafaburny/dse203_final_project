Early August there was a crazy AMD bull run that caused a big spread between the stock values and conversion ratio (as much as a 40% upside of holding Xilinx shares when AMD hit 120). Idk exactly what the catalyst was at that time, but I imagine the WSB hype added to the push (+good Q2). The stocks have been moving very similarly apart from that bull run. \n\nIts impossible to say how aware of the full picture the average retail investor is, but my guess is that they've barely heard of Xilinx whilst AMD is more of a household name. \n\nCheck out this link for ratio movement over time: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/upndown/viz/XilinxAMDSharePriceRatio_16114624177710/XilinxAMDSharePriceRatio",

AMD is a ant company compare to Intel, Samsung and TSMC. On top of that China SMIC is growing like a weed. This is why Lisa Su is trying to close the deal with Xilinx. She knows they need them to survive. It is though to be in semiconductor business. PLTR on the other has a huge moat it is national security business with next to zero competitor. However, the big issues with PLTR is that it is not a new company and yet its grow is extremely slow. They need to get more commercial clients if they plan to grow.",

I see October 20th or 21st as the last chances to exit before everybody starts to get really nervous about November 2nd. Starting Monday, I only have about 8 or 9 more market days for half this portfolio.\n\nThen I might be jumping 100 percent to cash. This of course will be a temporary move, but I'm expecting November and December to just be months that most stock enthusiasts would like to forget. So, it's going to take a lot of discipline for me to hold out for the real lows that I'm expecting (at least 25 percent of all-time highs).\n\nBasically, I think when I buy back in either in November or December, I will load the boat with XLNX shares over AMD shares, but who knows if the spread will be as big then?

Idk exactly what the catalyst was at that time, but I imagine the WSB hype added to the push (+good Q2). The stocks have been moving very similarly apart from that bull run. \n\nIts impossible to say how aware of the full picture the average retail investor is, but my guess is that they've barely heard of Xilinx whilst AMD is more of a household name. \n\nCheck out this link for ratio movement over time: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/upndown/viz/XilinxAMDSharePriceRatio_16114624177710/XilinxAMDSharePriceRatio",

        "body": "Just a quick comment about AMD. I've traded the stock back and forth since February, and I can tell you that the stock was mostly not doing much of anything for long stretches, and then it finally had a big breakout, that pushed it above $100. This happened in this most recent 6 month period, so it seems like AMD is this outstanding performer in the most recent 6 months, but for 4 of those months, it didn't do much of anything.\n\nI still love AMD by the way. One of my favorite stocks going forward.\n\n(Pro Tip - If you plan on going LONG on AMD, with no plans to sell the stock in the next 90 days, then do yourself a huge favor and buy shares of XLNX instead of AMD. The merger has an 85 percent chance of being approved, and if so, you get 1.7234 shares of AMD for each share of XLNX. If you run the numbers right now, it's like buying an AMD share with a $12/$13 off per share coupon. However, if you plan to swing trade AMD, and you might be selling in the next 90 days, then it's better to stay with AMD shares for this purpose)",

        "body": "I reckon there'll be some sell pressure initally, yea. Xilinx haven't paid dividends since the merger was announced, so they'll bring a decent chunk of cash. Current market cap for Xilinx and AMD is 39B + 128B. Please correct me if I'm wrong, but wouldn't their combined total value push more funds to pick them up? Scaled up production and synergy effects should so some work as well.\n\nI'm really not sure how the market will react, so it's just a wild guess from my side. Only been following AMD/Xilinx since the merger announcement",
