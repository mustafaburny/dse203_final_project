For example, if they sell a contract with a delta of 0.5, they will buy 50 shares. That way, if the share price goes up a dollar, they will break even (-$50 on the call and +$50 on the shares). And vice versa if the price drops a dollar.\n\nHowever, you also have to take gamma into affect. Delta does not remain constant as the price fluctuates. Take the same example and assume gamma is 0.1. Let's say the price raises a dollar. The MM comes out even as explained. But because of the gamma, delta is now 0.6 and the MM is no longer delta neutral. They must buy another 10 shares. OK, fine, so they do that and they are neutral again. HOWEVER, if they have to do so in such a large volume that it actually raises the share price, it can have a compounding effect: buying shares to delta hedge raises the price, which raises the number of shares they need to hedge. This is a gamma squeeze.",

Not only can it lead to you becoming a bag holder, but the SEC frowns upon the \u201cwe talk\u201d you mentioned in your post. I do not mean this in any rude way but everyone makes their decisions themselves and is ultimately for themselves. We are not a pack here in WSB. We are individual investors who do not coordinate in any way on a stock. \n\nIf you see information that is scattered, like you mentioned, it is imperative to do your own research and figure out what is true and what is not. Not everyone who got in early on RKT did DD but the people who got in last week and knew about this definitely did. \n\nAs far as UWMC goes, I have seen a few posts about it but nothing close to the amount on RKT or GME. I plan on doing my own DD on UWMC tonight before deciding to go in tomorrow morning. \n\nI have no positions in UWMC as of now but I am intrigued enough to do some DD and possibly get in tomorrow. \n\nAnother major point to keep in mind, if you do get into something like RKT, make sure you have a PT in mind and do not be greedy. My EOW PT for RKT was hit today and I cashed out to secure my profits. Could it continue its run the rest of the week? Absolutely. Could it pullback and decline the rest of the week? Absolutely. If you plan on getting into UWMC, plan on how you will get out. Everyone likes to talk about how losses aren\u2019t realized until you sell. But the same goes for gains. It\u2019s great seeing green in your account but until you sell, it\u2019s not real.\n\nAlso, this is a casino.",

Well not so cheap now but we're cheap when I was entering long positions. Another good angle is to invest in US defense contractors. Defence budgets will only go up and those companies actually treat shareholders very well. Just today while my tech equities were killed, GD (have long position) announced 8% dividend increase. Nice.

Daily utilization is nearly 100% of float.  Reported SI is 44% but is that possible?\n\nThey are shorting 7mm shares daily.  14 million so far this week, not counting prior weeks where they were forcing sideways movement/decreases by shorting...\n\nThese hedge players I read recently have been fined 58 times for violations which include under reporting shares shorted.  IOW, they will lie about their short position, and count the fine as cost of doing business.\n\nGoing through short volume numbers by week since 1/14 through 3/15 provides some interesting insight.  We know our starting point was 140% short interest.\n\nTotal long volume since 1/14 is 764603691 shares\n\nTotal (reported) short volume is 743764136 shares\n\nNow if we take the absurd position that EVERY long share sold was to cover a short...  I know it's impossible but just play along...\n\nTaking that position, we see that 20839555 shares short were covered.\n\nGME's float is 45MM shares.  140% SI would be  63MM shares short.\n\nSo using the numbers THEY reported, there would still be 43MM shares short, or 96% SI\n\nWSB has 9MM members.  Even if only 25% of members here own a absurdly conservative estimate of 2 shares, that is  4.5MM shares, or roughly 10% of float.\n\nWhen we subtract those numbers from the overall long totals and recalculate the previously ridiculously conservative prior estimate the outcome is 106% SI.\n\nHowever, my gut feeling is WSB probably owns 50-75% of float at this time which means that the actual number of shares short (as reported) actually increased anywhere from 1.6MM to 12.9MM, resulting in actual SI of somewhere around 146% to 169%.\n\nIf the HF's are underreporting, then that number could be insanely high.\n\nTLDR:  It's is numerically impossible the SI has decreased from Jan 14th and has actually risen anywhere to 146%-169%.",

        "body": "Copied from r/stocks. Link to the original comment below. Tons of dd on r/stocks and other subreddits on how uwmc is tremendously undervalued, especially now with RKT at $30.\n\nI've responded a few times to these posts in the last week or so (maybe I responded to you before, sorry if I have) but uh, I agree. Its not gotten much love here on reddit, its hated in the SPAC subreddit and most threads about it have been pretty quiet here.\n\nThey have a market cap of 15 billion and as you noted have 7.5% of their market cap in straight cash! They have a forward P/E of 6.5 while RKT has a forward PE of 10. My brains a little tired and I didn't feel like doing the math to calculate their current P/E. Their share of the market sphere is picking up. For example, RKT is a consumer driven mortgage originator, RKT deals with people like you or I and attempts to fund and approve the loan. UWMC is a broker dealer, and deals primarily with the loan officers and lending companies directly. That share of the market sphere (broker dealers) peaked in 2008 and has subsequently fell and leveled off in 2014 at 14%. Its currently been rising for the last 7 years at a rate of 1-2% per year. Broker dealers like UWMC dealt with roughly 20% of the mortgage market in 2019 and will capture an estimated 21% in 2020 and return to the peak 33% by an estimated 2026. Their refinance volume obviously will shrink as it doubled with the low rates, but they should continue to capture more of the original home loans as broker dealers continue to regain market sphere, plus they are now looking to target jumbo loans adding more original loans to their books\n\nCommenced plans to restart jumbo offerings which are expected to go  live in March 2021 and will also materially increase purchase volume  during the remainder of 2021.\n\nThey have an industry leading close time (twice as fast as rocket, 3x as fast as industry average) and have one of the highest NPS scores in the industry. They have insane margins and their cost to originate the loans are much lower than the retail sector (RKT) They also pay a good dividend, which as price keeps dropping increases. It was up to 4.6% last time I calculated it.\n\nUnited Wholesale has invested heavily in technology. Findamortgagebroker.com, which aired a 2021 Super Bowl ad, was a massive investment. It intends to raise awareness of mortgage  brokers as a lending vehicle for homebuyers. Consumers will be able to  get referrals to a mortgage broker that will help the consumer decide  which product is best. Other technology investments include UTrack, a tracking application  that will tell the borrower, broker, and realtor the current status of a  loan. Blink+ is the company's loan origination system, which assembles  the documents and handles the nuts and bolts of putting together the  loan. Finally, EASE Docs handles the final documents for closing.\u00a0The payoff for that technology is not only faster times to close but  lower costs to originate. In the fourth quarter, United Wholesale took  18 days to manufacture a loan compared to 56 days for the typical retail  lender. On the conference call, CEO Tim Forrester said that United  Wholesale's cost to originate a loan (including the broker's  compensation) was $5,800 per loan compared to the average retail cost of $8,872. This translates into lower borrowing costs. United Wholesale's  average loan rate was 2.74% in the fourth quarter compared to 2.89% for  the overall industry.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThey absolutely must have fantastic technology and workflow tools as they process loans that quickly but just go ask any of your friends or family whom are in the business what they think of them. One of my best friends is a loan officer who deals with UWMC directly multiple times a month, and he loves them, like, thrice as much as RKT whom he compares to a used car salesman (Tho RKT has good reviews online, not trying to trash them either, they're being beat down for whatever reason too)  and says the tech is so much cooler than anything else he uses. Their customers had an average credit score of 757 and a DTI of 36%. Not exactly clients I expect to be going defunct in a correction or pandemic.\n\nFinally, United Wholesale introduced a  quarterly dividend of $0.10 per share, which gives the company a 4%  dividend yield. This is higher than most of its competitors aside from New Residential, an originator with a different business model. The Street sees United Wholesale earning $1.40 next year, giving the company a price-to-earnings ratio of 7.1 times. United Wholesale's cost advantage may allow it to take share from other lenders\n\nObvious cant analyze a stocks upside without downside too.\n\nDownside - The massive amount of shares make every dollar a 1.5b increase in cap\n\nCounter - Does that matter in this market? Well until UWMC I thought not, but it gives people a reason to be bearish and somewhat understandably so.\n\nDownside - Refinances will go down in volume causing profit to shrink if/when rates up\n\nCounter - but I disagree that this will cause massive downside for the company. Refinance should level off as they increase original loan volume elsewhere which is their main goal, and rates are not intended to go up anytime soon\n\nDownside - Big banks space - People liken big banks to home loans (BOA/WFC etc)\n\nCounter - They should also be taking more and more market sphere from big banks and others, not losing it no?  Who wants to go deal with wells Fargo tho? People hate those motherfuckers and for good reason lol.\n\nDownside - Market crash / Housing crash\n\nThese really don't have a counter, wont be pretty for most companies should this happen and is not something that I really take into account when picking stocks in most sectors. I'm not countering the downsides to say they don't exist, I'm just interjecting why I think they're not a massive reason to be bearish, but maybe I'm blinded because I like the company and have been in it for awhile (and I made a good chunk of change before merger) - I am not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice and just the reasons I jumped into the stock, blah blah. Currently holding most my shares in my retirement account and recently added back in at 9.37 and 8.88 for another swing in webull. People online are saying this is heavily shorted, but highest I saw was 42% short interest (Someone said as high as 68% but I wasn't able to verify that) - Every time I type this up or paste this and modify it a little I get more bullish, double check their investor presentation and their recent SEC filings and... I want to buy more. At 8 dollars I just cant help myself, maybe I'll be broke soon, who knows.\n\nhttps://www.bamsec.com/filing/119312521027468?cik=1783398\n\nhttps://www.bamsec.com/filing/119312520296072?cik=1783398\n\nhttps://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=uwmc\n\nEdit; Forgot, great advertising too. They're now on the Detriot Redwings helmets, they had a Superbowl commercial although it was very underwhelming and the company treats their employees rather well. They win awards for something in the sector year after year, 6 years running now I believe? Like what the fuck am I missing?? Late edit2; I just realized if you google uwmc helmets like for me trying to source the link above, you get things from UW university and UW hospitals, and so fourth. That's no help.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/li2yau/uwmc_seems_extremely_undervalued_to_me/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf",

With that said, I will update this again tomorrow morning based off the values after hours.\n\nSo below is an expansion of my previously posted theory that we are following the same trend. Note DFF is differential difference factor. The Difference factor is the a comparison of the value from the current run divided by the value from the January run. The DDF is a comparison of the day to day change for the current run divided by the day to day change for the January run.\n\nClosing Values From the January Run Up Compared to March Run Up\n\n1/11/21 / 19.94 || 2/22/21 / 46.00 || Difference Factor 2.31\n\n1/12/21 / 19.95 || 2/23/21 / 44.97 || Difference Factor 2.25 [Day2Day Change -0.01||-1.03; DDF 10300]\n\n1/13/21 / 31.40 || 2/24/21 / 91.71 || Difference Factor 2.92 [Day2Day Change 11.45||46.74; DDF 4.08 ]\n\n1/14/21 / 39.91 || 2/25/21 / 108.73 || Difference Factor 2.72 [Day2Day Change 8.51||17.02; DDF 2]\n\n1/15/21 / 35.50 || 2/26/21 / 101.74 || Difference Factor 2.87 [Day2Day Change -4.41||-6.99; DDF 1.59]\n\n1/19/21 / 39.36 || 3/1/21 / 120.41 || Difference Factor 3.07 [Day2Day Change 3.86||18.67; DFF 4.84]\n\n1/20/21 / 39.12 || 3/2/21 / 118.00 || Difference Factor 3.02 [Day2Day Change -0.24||-2.41; DFF 10.04]\n\n1/21/21 / 43.03 || 3/3/21 / 124.18 || Difference Factor 2.89 [Day2Day Change 3.91||6.18; DFF 1.58]\n\n1/22/21 / 65.01 || 3/4/21 / 132.37 || Difference Factor 1.59 [Day2Day Change 21.98||8.19; DFF 0.37](&lt;- we are here)\n\n1/25/21 / 76.79 || 3/5/21\n\n1/26/21 / 147.98 || 3/8/21\n\n1/27/21 / 347.51 || 3/9/21\n\nThe average difference factor is 2.63, the maximum is 3.07, and the minimum is 1.59. The standard deviation is 0.49.\n\nThe reason I say we are following the January pattern is because of two factors; 1) the difference factor is generally around the average difference factor 2) the day to day changes generally follow the same \"pattern\" as January (on days that had negative change in January, there was negative change now, and this is true for increases and stagnant days).\n\nPreviously I assumed a 10% margin of error because I was mostly doing back of envelope calculations only looking at key points. From here on out I will consider the margin of error equal to the standard deviation divided by the average difference factor, which is currently 18.51%. Unfortunately it seems that we are beginning to see a breakdown of my hypothesis, so the error is getting higher. Based off these values here are my estimates for the next few trading days.\n\n3/5/21 / $201.96 +/-$37.38\n\n3/8/21 / $289.19 +/-$53.53\n\n3/9/21 / $913.95 +/-$169.17\n\nPEAK VALUE Previous run / $483.00 || This run / $1270.29 +/-$235.13\n\nThe peak value should occure between opening bell March 8th and closing bell March 10th, based off what happened on the January run.\n\nI will be updating this as the next few days progress. The current outlook is that the hypothesis is breaking down, and my calculations have to account for that with a larger margin of error. Chances are that by Monday my model won't track the current trajectory at all. That being said, keep my calculations in mind and watch the stock!",

        "body": "A lot of new retail shorts entered the game. Today when the price dropped i saw at least 1000 messages on yahoo finance board. All the shorts where screaming. When price goes up they are silent, but when the price drops couple % they start screaming. We need to learn these guys a lesson. I'm planning to sell 30 Tesla shares and couple Amazon to buy more GME tomorrow. We have a long way to go and i know every investment now is a big profit over couple weeks. I never saw a community like GME. We are like 50 stock communities in one. If we jump the world will shake you will see earthquakes and tsunami everywhere. Thats with how many we are. If we hold together and buy more together nobody will able to stop us. But we need to remove our stop loss limits. Hedge funds are aiming on stop loss limits and when they hit these limits all these shares of the paperhands pussies enters the market. When pussies see this orders they panic and start to sell for lower price. Thats what happend today. I went to the garden to smoke a cigarette when i saw the drop and drink a cup of coffee. Came back was around $180 saw chaos on yahoo finance i laughed made another coffee made a short flight with flight simulator 2020 when i came back it was over 250 again. My mentality is if i die i die like a man. If it goes up nice if it stays here nice and if it goes down i buy more and more every month. First time Robinhood and hedge funds together tried to fuck us and they are warned. We took some scars and are still alive. This time nobody will be able to stop us. Together with hedge funds a lot of little retail shorters will be squeezed. There is no way back we kill or we die. One of us must die.",

        "body": "I follow Steve Van Metre pretty religiously and he's shown that past QE and papers from the FED have stated that deflation is the mostly likely path right now. If you have a chance, listen to lectures by Richard Koo, he was working with Japan during their market collapse in the 80's and he has amazing insight into expectations. Overall, the FED's goal is to drive bond interest rates to 0, which will cause stonks to fall. The Eurozone and Japan have been exporting deflation and our companies have not been able to pass on inflated prices of raw goods onto consumers lately, so this is hurting companies right now and consumer prices will fall soon (also deflationary). \n\nThe only way we get inflation is if the banks open their doors and start lending to everyone right now (which they won't, given the current unemployment rates). So all this QE money will stay locked away within the banks and stonk market (unless the GME bubble super pops!) until further notice. This also causes a dollar shortage (see M2 velocity &amp; remember companies not accepting dollars &amp; banks not issuing dollars last year?), which will also lead to a dollar rally and will cause yields to drop (and the stonk market).\n\nTLDR: Deflation is certain until banks ease lending restrictions. The FED has already stated what's going to happen, but people don't listen/understand what they're saying.",

        "body": "I don\u2019t think RKT is a purposely crafted distraction, just a coincidence. The company had their IPO a few months ago and after gaining value for a couple weeks it crashed, and since then has drawn a few hedge funds who have spent the last few months shorting it. However, it has backfired on the shorts for a few reasons, the biggest being that RKT\u2019s execs aren\u2019t fucking around and have decided to actively fuck over the shorts. In late November, RKT announced they intend to do a massive stock buy back of $1 billion worth of shares during Q1. This has yet to happen so it\u2019s likely to occur in the very near future; current float is about 100M, so they intend to buyback roughly 25% of all outstanding stock. Then, during their Q4 earnings report on 2/25, they announced a special dividend of $1.1/share is going to be paid out to all holders at the end of market 3/9. On top of that, the shorts got noticed by the retail investors, having overplayed their hand again and irresponsibly pushed to 40% short interest. So now the shorts are stuck in a shitty position. If they don\u2019t settle up their positions by 3/9, they\u2019ll wind up having to cover that dividend, and on top of that retail is buying the stock up like crazy. Bonus, RKT is roughly 70% institutional ownership, and those firms are more than happy to throw fuel on the fire to burn their competitors attempting to short them.",
