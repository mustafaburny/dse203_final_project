Do not do that.  \n\nTake time off, decide on a rational INVESTMENT strategy and get back in when you are ready.\n\nLosing significant sums of money is a life event... like getting fired, getting married, etc.  Acknowledge that, take time off, reflect... embrace how you are feeling now so you remember what it feels like next time you want to yolo.\n\nLets also accept the fact most of us are gambling... perhaps you (and me for that matter) need to think long and hard about (y)our motives for that yolo.  Get rich quick or slow and steady for retirement?  \n\nLastly, staying on WSB and other similar subs is unhealthy during your time off.  Seeing gain porn is the worst thing you can see right now... it will make you want to jump right back in.

For example, if they sell a contract with a delta of 0.5, they will buy 50 shares. That way, if the share price goes up a dollar, they will break even (-$50 on the call and +$50 on the shares). And vice versa if the price drops a dollar.\n\nHowever, you also have to take gamma into affect. Delta does not remain constant as the price fluctuates. Take the same example and assume gamma is 0.1. Let's say the price raises a dollar. The MM comes out even as explained. But because of the gamma, delta is now 0.6 and the MM is no longer delta neutral. They must buy another 10 shares. OK, fine, so they do that and they are neutral again. HOWEVER, if they have to do so in such a large volume that it actually raises the share price, it can have a compounding effect: buying shares to delta hedge raises the price, which raises the number of shares they need to hedge. This is a gamma squeeze.",

This oil company's workers claimed they found oil, but when they finished the contract everyone changed their tune and management abruptly started avoiding the topic. The oil company and the transport company haven't been back up there since. My friends seem to think they did find something, but they're saving it to go back to later. At the time, oil prices were declining. I wouldn't be surprised if they moved back up there again now that oil has gone back up. Another possibility, the oil workers just assumed they found oil and told the transport workers they hit a gold mine and then turned out completely wrong.\n\nThis isn't financial advice.

Not only can it lead to you becoming a bag holder, but the SEC frowns upon the \u201cwe talk\u201d you mentioned in your post. I do not mean this in any rude way but everyone makes their decisions themselves and is ultimately for themselves. We are not a pack here in WSB. We are individual investors who do not coordinate in any way on a stock. \n\nIf you see information that is scattered, like you mentioned, it is imperative to do your own research and figure out what is true and what is not. Not everyone who got in early on RKT did DD but the people who got in last week and knew about this definitely did. \n\nAs far as UWMC goes, I have seen a few posts about it but nothing close to the amount on RKT or GME. I plan on doing my own DD on UWMC tonight before deciding to go in tomorrow morning. \n\nI have no positions in UWMC as of now but I am intrigued enough to do some DD and possibly get in tomorrow. \n\nAnother major point to keep in mind, if you do get into something like RKT, make sure you have a PT in mind and do not be greedy. My EOW PT for RKT was hit today and I cashed out to secure my profits. Could it continue its run the rest of the week? Absolutely. Could it pullback and decline the rest of the week? Absolutely. If you plan on getting into UWMC, plan on how you will get out. Everyone likes to talk about how losses aren\u2019t realized until you sell. But the same goes for gains. It\u2019s great seeing green in your account but until you sell, it\u2019s not real.\n\nAlso, this is a casino.",

Even on this sub you can find them, but mostly just the good outcomes- people don't post/brag about the horrors so much. \n\nI do remember a post a year or so ago on this sub by someone that inherited a bunch of money from their grandpa and 'YOLOing' most of it by shorting Carvana when it was $100ish... with aims to hold it til at least the 2020 election.  If they did they'd have seen it grow to over $200 per share and it's now sitting at nearly $300 per share.  \n\nI virtually high-five anyone that makes out well on these bets as you did.

        "body": "So mixed news and results for the day; while we ended above my previous low estimate of $130, we did not close much higher than that (I recorded $132.37 at 4PM on the dot). With that said, I will update this again tomorrow morning based off the values after hours.\n\nSo below is an expansion of my previously posted theory that we are following the same trend. Note DFF is differential difference factor. The Difference factor is the a comparison of the value from the current run divided by the value from the January run. The DDF is a comparison of the day to day change for the current run divided by the day to day change for the January run.\n\nClosing Values From the January Run Up Compared to March Run Up\n\n1/11/21 / 19.94 || 2/22/21 / 46.00 || Difference Factor 2.31 \n\n1/12/21 / 19.95 || 2/23/21 / 44.97 || Difference Factor 2.25 [Day2Day Change -0.01||-1.03; DDF 10300]\n\n1/13/21 / 31.40 || 2/24/21 / 91.71 || Difference Factor 2.92 [Day2Day Change 11.45||46.74; DDF 4.08 ]\n\n1/14/21 / 39.91 || 2/25/21 / 108.73 || Difference Factor 2.72 [Day2Day Change 8.51||17.02; DDF 2]\n\n1/15/21 / 35.50 || 2/26/21 / 101.74 || Difference Factor 2.87 [Day2Day Change -4.41||-6.99; DDF 1.59]\n\n1/19/21 / 39.36 || 3/1/21 / 120.41 || Difference Factor 3.07 [Day2Day Change 3.86||18.67; DFF 4.84]\n\n1/20/21 / 39.12 || 3/2/21 / 118.00 || Difference Factor 3.02 [Day2Day Change -0.24||-2.41; DFF 10.04]\n\n1/21/21 / 43.03 || 3/3/21 / 124.18 || Difference Factor 2.89 [Day2Day Change 3.91||6.18; DFF 1.58]\n\n1/22/21 / 65.01 || 3/4/21  / 132.37 || Difference Factor 1.59 [Day2Day Change 21.98||8.19; DFF 0.37](&lt;- we are here)\n\n1/25/21 / 76.79 || 3/5/21\n\n1/26/21 / 147.98 || 3/8/21\n\n1/27/21 / 347.51 || 3/9/21\n\nThe average difference factor is 2.63, the maximum is 3.07, and the minimum is 1.59. The standard deviation is 0.49.\n\nThe reason I say we are following the January pattern is because of two factors; 1) the difference factor is generally around the average difference factor 2) the day to day changes generally follow the same \"pattern\" as January (on days that had negative change in January, there was negative change now, and this is true for increases and stagnant days).\n\nPreviously I assumed a 10% margin of error because I was mostly doing back of envelope calculations only looking at key points. From here on out I will consider the margin of error equal to the standard deviation divided by the average difference factor, which is currently 18.51%. Unfortunately it seems that we are beginning to see a breakdown of my hypothesis, so the error is getting higher. Based off these values here are my estimates for the next few trading days.\n\n3/5/21 / $201.96 +/-$37.38\n\n3/8/21 / $289.19 +/-$53.53\n\n3/9/21 / $913.95 +/-$169.17\n\n**PEAK VALUE**  Previous run / $483.00 || This run / $1270.29 +/-$235.13\n\nThe peak value should occure between opening bell March 8th and closing bell March 10th, based off what happened on the January run.\n\nI will be updating this as the next few days progress. The current outlook is that the hypothesis is breaking down, and my calculations have to account for that with a larger margin of error. Chances are that by Monday my model won't track the current trajectory at all. That being said, keep my calculations in mind and watch the stock!",

        "body": "**SUMMARY OF GME SHORT INCLUDING KEY DATES AND RESOURCES**\n\nIf you're here for the short...\n\nFINRA, a US government backed non-for-profit, reports SI% on stocks on a regular cadence. The numbers are calculated and provided to investment agencies/firms, which are cascaded to the public. It's my understanding that the raw data is provided, so some agencies provide different SI%.\n\nFINRA SI Reporting Schedule\n\n[https://www.finra.org/filing-reporting/regulatory-filing-systems/short-interest](https://www.finra.org/filing-reporting/regulatory-filing-systems/short-interest)\n\nNext time numbers get to the public is 3/9. That means we'll find out if the short is still on (more than likely is - in fact, there are still firms shorting the stock even now, betting that we won't continue to hold long enough for them to get executed).\n\nYou find out about if the short is still on by visiting multiple credible sites, and making your own judgement about what the SI% is based on the firms findings.\n\n[https://fintel.io/ss/us/gme](https://fintel.io/ss/us/gme)\n\n[https://finra-markets.morningstar.com/MarketData/EquityOptions/detail.jsp?query=126%3A0P000002CH&amp;sdkVersion=2.58.0](https://finra-markets.morningstar.com/MarketData/EquityOptions/detail.jsp?query=126%3A0P000002CH&amp;sdkVersion=2.58.0)\n\nThere are others. If someone posts them in the comments I'll add them to this next time I post.\n\nRight now, based on the average of these 2 sites, we have about a 40-50% Short %. This is how we will end commanding the price, as long as we hold. When they come to collect these shares, and they must be collected, they will have to buy the shares from us, at whatever price we've set.\n\nNow they could short their short, in order to buy themselves more time. But that also gives US more time to accumulate real shares. So again, a few weeks later when the calls come up, they must again either pay us, or short their short, that they'd already shorted. This would be reflected in the SI% going above 100%.\n\nIf the SI% has increased when posted on 3/9, the short is more than on - it's growing, hold. If it's the same, hold. If it's &lt; 20% **on every site**, things get real questionable imo.\n\nSI% gets updated every 2 weeks. Those are the big landmarks. And each Friday, calls are executed, which is when shorts may start collecting shares, in order to payout. I believe they have until Tuesday to fully pay out all executed shares.\n\nAt the moment, the price has been very stable, which is excellent. And today isn't likely to be a big key event date, it's likely that shorters aren't buying yet, waiting longer before they MUST collect. So a flat day like today is totally normal. Tomorrow will likely be similar. We may even see a dip. Anything below &lt; $120 is a discount imo (considering that has been our floor for 3 days now). At 45% SI, all seriousness, I believe $500+ is not a meme. And it could certainly go WAY higher, if we all held together.\n\nThis is basically how it works, I think. There are people way smarter than me here, and I wouldn't be surprised if I was off on a few things. I'm not an advisor; this isn't financial advice. Just a dumb ape who wrote this up as a comment to someone who asked how this works and wanted to share. Let's build on this post together and keep it circulating. I also like the stock.\n\nFeel free to edit, expand, and share. Just be sure to include your resources.\n\n\ud83d\udc8e\ud83e\udd8dWe need to educate fellow ape.

Well not so cheap now but we're cheap when I was entering long positions. Another good angle is to invest in US defense contractors. Defence budgets will only go up and those companies actually treat shareholders very well. Just today while my tech equities were killed, GD (have long position) announced 8% dividend increase. Nice.

Daily utilization is nearly 100% of float.  Reported SI is 44% but is that possible?\n\nThey are shorting 7mm shares daily.  14 million so far this week, not counting prior weeks where they were forcing sideways movement/decreases by shorting...\n\nThese hedge players I read recently have been fined 58 times for violations which include under reporting shares shorted.  IOW, they will lie about their short position, and count the fine as cost of doing business.\n\nGoing through short volume numbers by week since 1/14 through 3/15 provides some interesting insight.  We know our starting point was 140% short interest.\n\nTotal long volume since 1/14 is 764603691 shares\n\nTotal (reported) short volume is 743764136 shares\n\nNow if we take the absurd position that EVERY long share sold was to cover a short...  I know it's impossible but just play along...\n\nTaking that position, we see that 20839555 shares short were covered.\n\nGME's float is 45MM shares.  140% SI would be  63MM shares short.\n\nSo using the numbers THEY reported, there would still be 43MM shares short, or 96% SI\n\nWSB has 9MM members.  Even if only 25% of members here own a absurdly conservative estimate of 2 shares, that is  4.5MM shares, or roughly 10% of float.\n\nWhen we subtract those numbers from the overall long totals and recalculate the previously ridiculously conservative prior estimate the outcome is 106% SI.\n\nHowever, my gut feeling is WSB probably owns 50-75% of float at this time which means that the actual number of shares short (as reported) actually increased anywhere from 1.6MM to 12.9MM, resulting in actual SI of somewhere around 146% to 169%.\n\nIf the HF's are underreporting, then that number could be insanely high.\n\nTLDR:  It's is numerically impossible the SI has decreased from Jan 14th and has actually risen anywhere to 146%-169%.",

For example, if they sell a contract with a delta of 0.5, they will buy 50 shares. That way, if the share price goes up a dollar, they will break even (-$50 on the call and +$50 on the shares). And vice versa if the price drops a dollar.\n\nHowever, you also have to take gamma into affect. Delta does not remain constant as the price fluctuates. Take the same example and assume gamma is 0.1. Let's say the price raises a dollar. The MM comes out even as explained. But because of the gamma, delta is now 0.6 and the MM is no longer delta neutral. They must buy another 10 shares. OK, fine, so they do that and they are neutral again. HOWEVER, if they have to do so in such a large volume that it actually raises the share price, it can have a compounding effect: buying shares to delta hedge raises the price, which raises the number of shares they need to hedge. This is a gamma squeeze.",

        "body": "I highly recommend doing your own DD. It\u2019s not a good idea to just \u201cfollow the pack\u201d when it comes to investing. Not only can it lead to you becoming a bag holder, but the SEC frowns upon the \u201cwe talk\u201d you mentioned in your post. I do not mean this in any rude way but everyone makes their decisions themselves and is ultimately for themselves. We are not a pack here in WSB. We are individual investors who do not coordinate in any way on a stock. \n\nIf you see information that is scattered, like you mentioned, it is imperative to do your own research and figure out what is true and what is not. Not everyone who got in early on RKT did DD but the people who got in last week and knew about this definitely did. \n\nAs far as UWMC goes, I have seen a few posts about it but nothing close to the amount on RKT or GME. I plan on doing my own DD on UWMC tonight before deciding to go in tomorrow morning. \n\nI have no positions in UWMC as of now but I am intrigued enough to do some DD and possibly get in tomorrow. \n\nAnother major point to keep in mind, if you do get into something like RKT, make sure you have a PT in mind and do not be greedy. My EOW PT for RKT was hit today and I cashed out to secure my profits. Could it continue its run the rest of the week? Absolutely. Could it pullback and decline the rest of the week? Absolutely. If you plan on getting into UWMC, plan on how you will get out. Everyone likes to talk about how losses aren\u2019t realized until you sell. But the same goes for gains. It\u2019s great seeing green in your account but until you sell, it\u2019s not real.\n\nAlso, this is a casino.",

With that said, I will update this again tomorrow morning based off the values after hours.\n\nSo below is an expansion of my previously posted theory that we are following the same trend. Note DFF is differential difference factor. The Difference factor is the a comparison of the value from the current run divided by the value from the January run. The DDF is a comparison of the day to day change for the current run divided by the day to day change for the January run.\n\nClosing Values From the January Run Up Compared to March Run Up\n\n1/11/21 / 19.94 || 2/22/21 / 46.00 || Difference Factor 2.31 \n\n1/12/21 / 19.95 || 2/23/21 / 44.97 || Difference Factor 2.25 [Day2Day Change -0.01||-1.03; DDF 10300]\n\n1/13/21 / 31.40 || 2/24/21 / 91.71 || Difference Factor 2.92 [Day2Day Change 11.45||46.74; DDF 4.08 ]\n\n1/14/21 / 39.91 || 2/25/21 / 108.73 || Difference Factor 2.72 [Day2Day Change 8.51||17.02; DDF 2]\n\n1/15/21 / 35.50 || 2/26/21 / 101.74 || Difference Factor 2.87 [Day2Day Change -4.41||-6.99; DDF 1.59]\n\n1/19/21 / 39.36 || 3/1/21 / 120.41 || Difference Factor 3.07 [Day2Day Change 3.86||18.67; DFF 4.84]\n\n1/20/21 / 39.12 || 3/2/21 / 118.00 || Difference Factor 3.02 [Day2Day Change -0.24||-2.41; DFF 10.04]\n\n1/21/21 / 43.03 || 3/3/21 / 124.18 || Difference Factor 2.89 [Day2Day Change 3.91||6.18; DFF 1.58]\n\n1/22/21 / 65.01 || 3/4/21  / 132.37 || Difference Factor 1.59 [Day2Day Change 21.98||8.19; DFF 0.37](&lt;- we are here)\n\n1/25/21 / 76.79 || 3/5/21\n\n1/26/21 / 147.98 || 3/8/21\n\n1/27/21 / 347.51 || 3/9/21\n\nThe average difference factor is 2.63, the maximum is 3.07, and the minimum is 1.59. The standard deviation is 0.49.\n\nThe reason I say we are following the January pattern is because of two factors; 1) the difference factor is generally around the average difference factor 2) the day to day changes generally follow the same \"pattern\" as January (on days that had negative change in January, there was negative change now, and this is true for increases and stagnant days).\n\nPreviously I assumed a 10% margin of error because I was mostly doing back of envelope calculations only looking at key points. From here on out I will consider the margin of error equal to the standard deviation divided by the average difference factor, which is currently 18.51%. Unfortunately it seems that we are beginning to see a breakdown of my hypothesis, so the error is getting higher. Based off these values here are my estimates for the next few trading days.\n\n3/5/21 / $201.96 +/-$37.38\n\n3/8/21 / $289.19 +/-$53.53\n\n3/9/21 / $913.95 +/-$169.17\n\n**PEAK VALUE**  Previous run / $483.00 || This run / $1270.29 +/-$235.13\n\nThe peak value should occure between opening bell March 8th and closing bell March 10th, based off what happened on the January run.\n\nI will be updating this as the next few days progress. The current outlook is that the hypothesis is breaking down, and my calculations have to account for that with a larger margin of error. Chances are that by Monday my model won't track the current trajectory at all. That being said, keep my calculations in mind and watch the stock!",

        "body": "**SUMMARY OF GME SHORT INCLUDING KEY DATES AND RESOURCES**\n\nIf you're here for the short...\n\nFINRA, a US government backed non-for-profit, reports SI% on stocks on a regular cadence. The numbers are calculated and provided to investment agencies/firms, which are cascaded to the public. It's my understanding that the raw data is provided, so some agencies provide different SI%.\n\nFINRA SI Reporting Schedule\n\n[https://www.finra.org/filing-reporting/regulatory-filing-systems/short-interest](https://www.finra.org/filing-reporting/regulatory-filing-systems/short-interest)\n\nNext time numbers get to the public is 3/9. That means we'll find out if the short is still on (more than likely is - in fact, there are still firms shorting the stock even now, betting that we won't continue to hold long enough for them to get executed).\n\nYou find out about if the short is still on by visiting multiple credible sites, and making your own judgement about what the SI% is based on the firms findings.\n\n[https://fintel.io/ss/us/gme](https://fintel.io/ss/us/gme)\n\n[https://finra-markets.morningstar.com/MarketData/EquityOptions/detail.jsp?query=126%3A0P000002CH&amp;sdkVersion=2.58.0](https://finra-markets.morningstar.com/MarketData/EquityOptions/detail.jsp?query=126%3A0P000002CH&amp;sdkVersion=2.58.0)\n\nThere are others. If someone posts them in the comments I'll add them to this next time I post.\n\nRight now, based on the average of these 2 sites, we have about a 40-50% Short %. This is how we will end commanding the price, as long as we hold. When they come to collect these shares, and they must be collected, they will have to buy the shares from us, at whatever price we've set.\n\nNow they could short their short, in order to buy themselves more time. But that also gives US more time to accumulate real shares. So again, a few weeks later when the calls come up, they must again either pay us, or short their short, that they'd already shorted. This would be reflected in the SI% going above 100%.\n\nIf the SI% has increased when posted on 3/9, the short is more than on - it's growing, hold. If it's the same, hold. If it's &lt; 20% **on every site**, things get real questionable imo.\n\nSI% gets updated every 2 weeks. Those are the big landmarks. And each Friday, calls are executed, which is when shorts may start collecting shares, in order to payout. I believe they have until Tuesday to fully pay out all executed shares.\n\nAt the moment, the price has been very stable, which is excellent. And today isn't likely to be a big key event date, it's likely that shorters aren't buying yet, waiting longer before they MUST collect. So a flat day like today is totally normal. Tomorrow will likely be similar. We may even see a dip. Anything below &lt; $120 is a discount imo (considering that has been our floor for 3 days now). At 45% SI, all seriousness, I believe $500+ is not a meme. And it could certainly go WAY higher, if we all held together.\n\nThis is basically how it works, I think. There are people way smarter than me here, and I wouldn't be surprised if I was off on a few things. I'm not an advisor; this isn't financial advice. Just a dumb ape who wrote this up as a comment to someone who asked how this works and wanted to share. Let's build on this post together and keep it circulating. I also like the stock.\n\nFeel free to edit, expand, and share. Just be sure to include your resources.\n\n\ud83d\udc8e\ud83e\udd8dWe need to educate fellow ape.

Well not so cheap now but we're cheap when I was entering long positions. Another good angle is to invest in US defense contractors.

Looking back now I realize that the price today of one GME is equal to my 2 months salary.\n\nMy 9 shares are worth more than my annual income. I have come a long way and I\u2019m glad that I\u2019m fortunate enough that I could get into GME with the money I can afford to lose. It\u2019s hard to believe that the amount that was my annual income 2 years ago is now my play money.\n\nMakes me realize that how quickly things can change if you stay focused. Be grateful.\n\nApes strong together.",
