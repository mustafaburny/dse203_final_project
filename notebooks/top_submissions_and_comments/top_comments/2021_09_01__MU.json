Selling the call spread is a little bit easier to predict what you'll make. If you buy a put spread, the vol collapse and the spread having to go fully ITM to realize a full gain has more variables at work. You can buy the put spread and still lose even with having the direction right.\n\nWorking myself out of a put that is ITM right now.\n\nI'm looking to get out next week and waiting until earnings to put new positions on.  \n\nI wouldn't be betting against MU just because spot prices are falling. That means supply chains are working their way out and that they will be producing at capacity vs charging a little bit more per diminished output.
