It went up because people had more money to spend, due to the stimulus checks, mortgage moratorium, the suspension of student loan payments, and the increased unemployment benefits. All of these things will end and with that we'll see decreased spending. JPOW in one of the last conferences spoke about how unemployment levels are still high, while the amount of open jobs in the US is also still high(when they have an inverse relationship usually) Some people made more money on unemployment than they did actually working their regular jobs(service industry) Minimum wage has seen laughable increases over the last decade but hilariously enough most of these minimum wage positions people saw as \"vital\" enough to keep working during a pandemic.\n\nLockdown wise totally possible if not probable. Something that a lot of people don't talk about is that the initial lockdowns were also meant to inhibit COVID's chances to mutate into something worse. Which we saw with Delta. The Delta variant is more contagious and more deadly than the original strain. And now there is another variant making the rounds called the Mu variant, which in turn is more deadly and more contagious and initial tests show that the current vaccines don't offer the same level of protections. This is going to get worse before it gets better because of the issues the US and how bipartisan the entire pandemic has become.",

        "body": "A few things to think about related to space junk and collisions.\n\nFirst, space junk is a real problem.  There is no denying that.  But the solution isn't to avoid commercializing space.  The solution really involves a multi-pronged approach.\n\n1) Insurance - there are insurance plans available for launch/deployment as well as for damage from collision with other things in space.  Typically these plans only cover the financial loss related to replacing the satellite itself, and not the loss that comes from loss of services the satellite provided.\n\nWhich leads to the second strategy:\n\n2) Redundancy - and really, redundancy applies at all levels.  The modular design of Blue Walker 3 and the Blue Bird 1 satellites have redundancy at all levels.  An individual micron, or group of microns can fail (though collision or through just plain old electronic parts failure), and the satellite will still be operational - although it will have a reduced capacity proportionate to the number of micros affected.\n\nBut redundancy isn't just something done at the individual satellite level - it also applies to the constellation.\n\nPhase 1 will consist of 20 satellites, but only 18 are needed to provide equatorial country coverage.  2 satellites are spares that can step in for satellite failure, or to provide more robust coverage.\n\nThe the plan for between now and 2025 calls for 168 satellites, but only 110 are needed for global coverage.\n\nThis idea isn't unique to AST SpaceMobile.  When Iridium lost a satellite to collion in 2009, they had a \"parked\" satellite in place within a few weeks.  Similarly, if you look at Iridium's current constellation, they have global coverage provided by 66 satellites, but they have 9 spares in orbit that can be maneuvered into position for service if needed, and they have another 6 satellites on the ground ready to be deployed in case they run through a lot of spares.\n\n3) Be a good space citizen - responsibly operating a satellite constellation involves caring about the needs of others.  If a satellite needs to be taken offline because of obsolescence or for other reasons, don't leave it in orbit - take it down into the atmosphere where it will burn up on re-entry.",
