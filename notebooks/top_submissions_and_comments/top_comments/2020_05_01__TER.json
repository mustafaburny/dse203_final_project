A few quick questions:\n\n&gt; they are the largest wholesaler in the state.\n\n~~Are you sure this is accurate?  Can you provide a source that backs this up?  This is not my understanding.~~  I now see mnyahoo's comment below regarding the tripling of production \"making them the largest player in the state.\"  Still not sure if that's verifiable, but I'll take it for now.  Is wholesale really the brass ring though?  Do they have a meaningful path to a leading position on the retail/cpg side of the market?\n\n&gt; NJ is very intriguing because it is a limited license state w only 9 dispensaries currently, and there is a very strong chance of adult use legalization come November.\n\nNJ is very attractive.  My comments on it above were not to denigrate that opportunity.  They were meant to acknowledge that NJ has potential, but that potential is still very uncertain and in the distance.  Look at NY, for example. The MSOs with early licenses (IAN, MMEN, etc) were supposedly well set up to capitalize on that incredibly limited license state that was \"due to go rec legal anyday.\"  Fast forward a couple years, and we're still waiting for NY to pay off.  Again, I'm not tearing down NJ.  I'm simply acknowledging that, outside of PA, all of TER's chosen markets appear aren't that exciting as of today.\n\n&gt; It is inevitable, in my opinion, that over time, M&amp;A will be a focus of this company to enter new states.\n\nWhile wading through my (limited) research into this one, I couldn't help but wonder if they might be on the target end (sellers) of the next M&amp;A rush.  Maybe they find a way to merge with a company like 4Front, but is PA enough of a carrot?  Time will tell.  \n\n&gt; I dont care if they are only operating in 3-4 states now, i care about strong rev growth and positive ebitda which down the line will allow them to expand their business within the US\n\nAgreed, for the most part.  Looking forward to digging into Q1 in the coming days.",

STZ will *only* have 56% *after* they've executed the remaining three tranches: ~ at the 48CAD, 76CAD, and VWAP pricing.\n\nThat said, I still think CGC is going to be a monster in a decade. The number of paths of revenue they will have - no other cannabis company compares to: Canadian ops, ACRG + TER, This Works, BioSteel, Storz &amp; Bickel, clinical trials, all their partial investments in other companies...\n\nSTZ sure may regret their purchase price, but they don't regret being in this space - they know how massive it's going to be. Like Klein said last fall: \"[STZ] might've been early, but we weren't wrong\" for what the cannabis industry is going to be globally. STZ is fine apparently spending lots of money now to explore different cannabis revenue streams and get each product just right to ensure they're the dominant player in town a decade from now.",

Legal and General just launched their Global Equity ETF at 0.1% TER, which could form the backbone of your portfolio. This will deliver exposure to mid and large cap across the developed world. However, you're missing out on Emerging Markets, so an tracker like the iShares MSCI Emerging Markets could fit nicely. The rest in a 60/20/20, 70/15/15, or 80/10/10 distribution can either be bonds or even a specific tilt towards certain sectors like Information Technology. This will depend upon your risk appetite, naturally. In any case, make sure you avoid unintentional overlap and choose the ETFs with as low fees as possible",

Terrascend is a client of Alan Brochstein (and likely others), which tends to generate a lot of retail buzz imho.  \n\nI [dug into Terrascend](https://old.reddit.com/r/weedstocks/comments/gse5jn/cresco_labs_announces_first_quarter_2020_results/fs50hlh/) yesterday as a result of the growing hype around them on the sub.  Was curious to see if this really was an interesting value play.  Based on what I found, I'm not interested as of today.  Some promising fundamental progress but I don't see enough upside in their chosen markets as of right now.  Seems like they're a middle tier MSO without a stategic path to climb the rungs.  And middle tier companies in the cannabis sector have proven time and again not to be worth the investment.  TER already valued over $750M fully diluted/converted (right?  anyone have the actual figure?  283M + 30M recent raise + whatever the Canopy loan adds if converted = at least 375M shares diluted/converted?).  \n\nI'm not sure a middle tier MSO valued in this range has much more upside without new market expansion.  Growth into other markets will require additional dilution to finance m&amp;a and capex, further inflating that market cap.  I just don't see much price appreciation possible for them based on current valuation, cash position and footprint.\n\nFor the sake of those excited by this company, I do hope I'm wrong on this.  Also, fwiw, I have not dug into Q1 yet.  Perhaps I'll find something that changes my mind.",

Two limited-license markets with huge current upside on medical growth, as well as long-term upside upon adult-use legalization. Will be great markets in 2020 and beyond, and will drive most of their revenue growth for the foreseeable future.\n\nTHE MEDIOCRE- California. This is more a challenge of the high taxes/black market competition in the state, but i would struggle to call TER a leader in Cali. Revenues are stagnating/declining showing a lack of both retail and wholesale growth, with their long-established Apothecarium stores still unprofitable and dragging on cash flow. There is still potential in this market, but operational results have not been great in the state since TER took over.\n\nTHE BAD- CBD Business and Canada. Q4 showed declining revenues and growing EBDITA losses for both these segments. Saying TER is the only company with US and international exposure is a nice talking point, but in reality, their financials are struggling as a direct result of these non-US THC operations.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLooking at Q4 2019 which included a full quarter of Illera (PA acquisition), TER had some negative impairments that somewhat skewed the actual result, but gross margins were negative on the quarter at -16% (and still quite poor compared to peers with those impairments removed), they had an ajt EBDITA loss of almost $6M, and a much larger OCF and FCF loss. Cash position is solid with recent raises and i think 2020 should be a better year, but TER definitely needs to show improved profitability metrics over the coming year and focus on key limited-license US markets.",

As far as current operations go, their position in PA, despite the competition, is remarkable. PA is the fastest growing medical market in all the country, and they are the largest wholesaler in the state. NJ is very intriguing because it is a limited license state w only 9 dispensaries currently, and there is a very strong chance of adult use legalization come November. The business model of being in as many states as possible has proven to be a failed model. I like how TER is focusing on high margin limited license states. There is plenty of opportunity for revenue and margin expansion currently if they choose to only stay in these 3 markets. It is inevitable, in my opinion, that over time, M&amp;A will be a focus of this company to enter new states. I dont care if they are only operating in 3-4 states now, i care about strong rev growth and positive ebitda which down the line will allow them to expand their business within the US",

        "body": "&gt; The Company closed the final tranches of its previously announced private placement in January resulting in proceeds of $12.7 million and completed a loan financing agreement with Canopy Growth in March, providing $80.5 million in capital that was partially used to fully retire an existing credit facility held with JW Asset Management.\n\nThis is interesting. [Canopy recently extended a C$80.5 million loan](https://www.terrascend.com/canada-80-5-million-financing-arrangement-canopy-growth-corporation/) to Terrascend (with 18M warrants issued as a sweetner).  That loan is \"to be used ... for general corporate purposes and the funding of its Canadian operations, its Arise Bioscience U.S. hemp division, international expansion **and the repayment of indebtedness**.\"  The final piece of this sentence is perhaps the most important, as the company acknowledged in today's release (quoted above).  Canopy's financing was used to pay off the JW Asset loan.  The size of the payoff is not (afaik) public available, but the original loan rom JW Asset Management was US$75M, which was converted to a [2-year loan carrying 12.5% interest](https://www.terrascend.com/terrascend-announces-agreement-on-two-year-term-loan-and-extension-to-credit-facility/) at the end of 2019.  It seems safe to assume that very little of the principal of this note was paid down, meaning most of Canopy's financing went to the debt held by JW Asset Management.  In exchange, Canopy got 18M warrants plus a sizable debt liability to Terrascend (admittedly, it's quite favorable to TER; 6% interest, non-convertible, not guaranteed, secured by Terrascend Canada, which doesn't have many assets, right?).  JW Asset management then bought 2/3 of the company's [recent US$30M capital raise](https://www.terrascend.com/terrascend-announces-us30-million-non-brokered-private-placement-with-indicative-lead-orders-of-approximately-us28-million/), netting them 20M shares (at an effective price of US$2/share) plus 20M warrants (at an effective price of US$3/share).\n\nSo, JW made bank off a 12.5% loan to TER (some of which may still be outstanding?).  Canopy paid off that debt to JW (seems unlikely this was paid in full, right?), at more favorable terms but with very little new cash likely making it into TER's account.  In return, Canopy received warrants that represented a roughly 6% stake in TER (18M warrants against 280-ish million outstanding shares, at that time) plus they now hold an $80M note to TER.  And then JW secured the right to 40M shares of cheap paper through the subsequent raise.\n\nThat's a lot of card shuffling--with at least 60M new shares/warrants issued to Canopy+JW (80M net all investors)--with very little new free cashflow to show for it ($30M, at most?).  Definitely a blow to existing shareholders.  And it consolidates/grows the interest of these two sizeable insiders, and issues a lot of cheap paper (with a warrant hedge) to the pe fund.\n\nNot saying this is all bad.  The terms (for now; if they don't wind up having to re-negotiate) of the loan provided by Canopy are far better than those provided by JW.  But, this is the exact sort of thing that give me the heebies.  We've seen far too many mid-tier companies in all subsectors of the cannabis market sell their capital structure down the river while reaching for the brass ring, placing all of the outsized risk squarely on retailers shoulders.  That definitely appears to be what's happened here.  This is a part of the Terrascend story to watch closely, at least.",
