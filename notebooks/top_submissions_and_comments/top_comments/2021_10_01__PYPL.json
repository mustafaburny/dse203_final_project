At $39 billion, this approaches... an eBay valuation. \n\nClearly one of two things with this leak\u2014either Pinterest thinks the valuation is too low and wants a bidding war, or PayPal (or a faction of PayPal) believes the price is too rich and is relying on market sentiment to make the case. \n\nI don\u2019t know about better.

As someone who used to draft securities filings for these, there will be a section called reasons for the transaction and usually the first thing listed is that shareholders will obtain more value long term. And often it\u2019s correct and not just financial engineering. Just look at how much more PayPal has be able to do not shackled to eBay. Ans sometimes it\u2019s a disaster.

It'll be a long slow march to the bottom and you'll have plenty of time to get out without losing your shirt. The only reason to stay out of them for now is if you're motivated by ethics and willing to avoid an otherwise good investment on principle.\n\nYou do want to also be invested in the sectors that may eventually displace them, and over time if the new sectors start to steadily outperform them, you'll reallocated bit by bit correspondingly. Industry ETFs are attractive options because they just require you to feel good about a particular technology or product category for very new industries, because you don't have to pick the winner out of all the small companies racing to become the dominant one. I think some important categories over the next 10-20 years will be: machine learning applications, 5G and beyond wireless standards, autonomous driving cars, and fintech. There are precious few individual companies in any of those categories that I'm willing to bet on as individuals. $PYPL for sure, they're the closest thing fintech has to a $V or $MC level titan. $ROKU as a gamble that I feel good about. \n\nI'm in $PAWZ because the amount of premium/niche pet products has been exploding, people are spending more money than ever on their pets, and a record % of Millennials - already a huge generation numerically - have decided to have pets instead of children. While they will cut back on spoiling their pets in a economic drawdown, spending won't collapse overnight because of how beloved pets are to the people driving growth in this category. So I don't necessarily think it's going to be a top performer forever, like oil and banks, I think it's got good medium-range prospects and will be easy to get out of with minimal losses when/if it draws down.\n\nI'm also invested in $WM because of the foresight they've shown in aggressively moving into biofuels, which is wringing yet more money out of trash they were already paid to collect, and positions them to increasingly benefit from the drawdown of fossil fuels in the future while still having an entirely stable, profitable business cranking along in the immediate.",
