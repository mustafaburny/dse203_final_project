I don\u2019t even know what that means...the stock is already running why do they have to pump it? \n\nPumping a stock would also imply they are dumping later. Most of the stocks they tip are massive companies that pump and dump schemes simply wouldn\u2019t work even if every subscriber of motley fool started buying the stock immediately. Like are they going to pump and dump Netflix? That wouldn\u2019t make any sense. \n\nThey recommend a lot of stocks and they do tip stocks that are going on long bull runs. However that has, for the most part, be a pretty good strategy the last few years. Recommending a stock after it has been running already that day could be down to pure chance or they could be rushing out the recommendation to hop on the gains train.\n\nEither way this is a pretty flimsy argument and without more research I think it\u2019s kind of jumping to conclusions. \n\nI have nothing but good things to say after using the service.

        "body": "It reminds me of this thought: *When does the breadth of contemporary evidence supersede the depth of historical data?*\n\nGenerally, I agree with your overall sentiment, but not for the reasons you cite here. I think there's a couple of things being conflated in the messaging. First, a 3-fund portfolio isn't going to get you some kind of multi-digit percentage return most of the time. You invest in a 3-fund portfolio if you're trying to preserve your money. Comparing a 3-fund portfolio to (insert growth fund here) isn't quite a fair comparison because the goals are different.\n\nAdditionally, I will point out that thematic investing isn't new. ARK and others have been following themes to great success, and as long as the theme remains hot (technology, clean energy, genomics, medical devices, etc.) the funds will continue to do well. [IHI](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&amp;timePeriod=4&amp;startYear=1985&amp;firstMonth=1&amp;endYear=2020&amp;lastMonth=12&amp;calendarAligned=true&amp;includeYTD=false&amp;initialAmount=10000&amp;annualOperation=0&amp;annualAdjustment=0&amp;inflationAdjusted=true&amp;annualPercentage=0.0&amp;frequency=4&amp;rebalanceType=1&amp;absoluteDeviation=5.0&amp;relativeDeviation=25.0&amp;showYield=false&amp;reinvestDividends=true&amp;benchmark=VFINX&amp;portfolioNames=false&amp;portfolioName1=Portfolio+1&amp;portfolioName2=Portfolio+2&amp;portfolioName3=Portfolio+3&amp;symbol1=IHI&amp;allocation1_1=100), for example, has done a compounding return of of 15% per year since inception (2007), blowing away the SPY in all metrics (less drawdowns, higher return, lower volatility, etc.).\n\nTraditional thinking states that you can't beat the market over time, so why even bother trying. People who believe this accept it as fact, when there are so many other factors involved (e.g. was the person who picked stocks buying the same stocks every time they got paid?).  I expect this notion to be challenged over the next decade, and quite frankly, I hope the thinking dies out. There are plenty of funds and folks buying baskets of stocks (e.g. 10-20 stocks) especially now with fractional shares weighted for specific targets and are continuing to ascend to new highs.\n\nAs much as people want to speak poorly of strategies that differ from their index investing, rarely have I ever seen someone address the elephant in the room which is, \"By not investing in the index, you were able to beat the index.\" I've had many debates here about this because there is a camp of diehards who refuse to look at any kind of alternative data. If I say [here's an example of a basket of 3 stocks that has beat the SPY for the past 26+ years](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&amp;timePeriod=4&amp;startYear=1985&amp;firstMonth=1&amp;endYear=2020&amp;lastMonth=12&amp;calendarAligned=true&amp;includeYTD=false&amp;initialAmount=100000&amp;annualOperation=0&amp;annualAdjustment=0&amp;inflationAdjusted=true&amp;annualPercentage=0.0&amp;frequency=4&amp;rebalanceType=1&amp;absoluteDeviation=5.0&amp;relativeDeviation=25.0&amp;showYield=false&amp;reinvestDividends=true&amp;benchmark=VFINX&amp;portfolioNames=false&amp;portfolioName1=Portfolio+1&amp;portfolioName2=Portfolio+2&amp;portfolioName3=Portfolio+3&amp;symbol1=MSFT&amp;allocation1_1=33&amp;symbol2=WM&amp;allocation2_1=33&amp;symbol3=INTU&amp;allocation3_1=34), is that enough evidence to show that consistently beating the market is at least *possible?? (put your pitchforks down, I did not say guaranteed).* I've been talking about this for the entire lifecycle of this reddit account, so it's nothing new.\n\nIf you're a person who is looking for outsized returns, you'll need to go outside the index. Momentum is one strategy that has consistently worked to accomplish this.\n\nGood luck",

In other words, their trajectories are detached from what you believe should be a reality and therefore one shouldn\u2019t invest in them for \u201cthe long term\u201d.\n\nIf someone is interested in Thematic investing, then the ARK funds fit that niche. Owning an ARK* fund simplifies the research that a person needs to do in order to get a blended exposure to a specific theme. For many investors, this is \u201cgood enough\u201d, because they want a simplified approach for certain factors.\n\nThematic portfolios aren\u2019t something new, and the SPY  isn\u2019t some holy grail for where someone should always place their money. There\u2019s plenty of poor performing companies in the SPY, but their terrible performance is masked by the weighting mechanisms used to derive the portfolio. \n\nAs far as following a theme goes, Ishares Medical Device ETF (IHI) has outperformed the SPY for the past 12 (going on 13) years, and that\u2019s across all metrics (gross CAGR, drawdowns, volatility, etc.) \n\nIf 13 years isn\u2019t good enough, I\u2019ve pointed out many times over the years here that a portfolio of 34% MSFT, 33% INTU, 33% WM has [beaten the market](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&amp;timePeriod=4&amp;startYear=1985&amp;firstMonth=1&amp;endYear=2020&amp;lastMonth=12&amp;calendarAligned=true&amp;includeYTD=false&amp;initialAmount=10000&amp;annualOperation=0&amp;annualAdjustment=0&amp;inflationAdjusted=true&amp;annualPercentage=0.0&amp;frequency=4&amp;rebalanceType=1&amp;absoluteDeviation=5.0&amp;relativeDeviation=25.0&amp;showYield=false&amp;reinvestDividends=true&amp;benchmark=VFINX&amp;portfolioNames=false&amp;portfolioName1=Portfolio+1&amp;portfolioName2=Portfolio+2&amp;portfolioName3=Portfolio+3&amp;symbol1=MSFT&amp;allocation1_1=33&amp;symbol2=INTU&amp;allocation2_1=33&amp;symbol3=WM&amp;allocation3_1=34) almost every single year for the past 26 years. Again, just because it\u2019s worked 26 years in a row doesn\u2019t mean that it will keep persisting, but I wouldn\u2019t bet against that blend. \n\nFor me, figuring out where we are in a cycle and then building a basket of stocks around the metrics that I target has led to far better outcomes than investing in the SPY. I\u2019m typically purchasing at all cycles and l rarely change the stocks that I\u2019m holding, except to rebalance as things move away from my target allocations. \n\nI would be careful drawing conclusions based on one author or based on a specific investment style. No one has it all figured out. You have to figure what works for you, and how much risk you\u2019re willing to take.",

        "body": "Some observations from my side:- Mindmed seems to have the best cards to rock the psymed market and this is being noticed by many investors (small to big). Resulting in positive sentiment.- More and more studies by respected institutions/universities are conducted and many have positive outcomes on several serious psychological disorders (ptsd, anxiety, depression etc.). Resulting in positive sentiment.- Because these studies are conducted by professionals, governments seem to open up about legislation of psychedelic medicines. Resulting in positive sentiment.- Lastly, to me it seems that media coverage on the psymed industry is rising. I might be biased here, however, it is very likely that MMED's uplisting on Nasdaq won't come through without some noise. And since the uplisting is positive, it results in additional positive sentiment.\n\nNow, the exact influence of these observations is hard to factor out, but I believe these are the keys to the recent surging market. Can't answer your question (obviously), but I look at it this way:\n\nMMED hype is going on right now and the uplisting is yet to come, so I'm not expecting a major pull back anytime soon. However, Mindmed generating a decent amount of revenue is YEARS away, let alone a decent amount of profit. They will likely encounter some challenges which may push back the positive sentiment quite a bit (and thereby stock price). In the long run though, they will likely get somewhere since MMED has such a diversified product line. Thus: either try to make a quick buck on the current hype cycle or make a shit ton of money in the long run.\n\nIf you want to keep up with Mindmed specific news/updates, you might wanna check out /r/MindMedInvestorsClub. Just sayin\n\nDisclaimer: this is no financial advice, just my view on Mindmed's case. I have a small amount of MMED stocks.",

        "body": "&gt; Second, the majority of exchanges these days aren\u2019t sketchy. They are regulated \n\nFor real?  I understood Bitcoin is still unregulated.  Are you absolutely sure about that?\n\n&gt; Is PayPal sketchy?\n\n\nWell, from my experiencing using it to sell things, hell yes, PayPal is sketchy.  They have their own rules and screw the customer at every turn.  But of course you and I mean sketchy in comparison to these mtgox type scams I've heard about and in comparison, so yes PayPal is not going to vanish in the night.\n\n&gt; Is the CashApp sketchy? Is Square sketchy?\n\nAren't those the same?  Is Bitcoin on cash app for individuals or just Square merchants?\n\n&gt; Third, crypto wallets are difficult to use with no experience but I guarantee if you make one transaction using one it\u2019s easy from there; what task isn\u2019t tough at first?It\u2019s like when a middle school aged child starts doing algebra. At first it seems daunting but after a few lessons things get easier and you wonder why it ever seemed so difficult in the first place.\n\nI'll take your word for it.  I've jusg seen hundreds of messages where people post that they lost their bitcoins due to wallet issues, and then edgelords mock them for not doing these series of non-intuitive hold and cold and medium wallet transfers and for not making copies of copies of their keys, etc. \n\n&gt; The mining of the Bitcoin does take some electricity but it\u2019s the mining that makes the network decentralized. \n\nI'm not talking about the mining which of course is massively wasteful on electricity.  I mean the computation energy needed to verify a transaction.  Isn't that expensive on electricity and takes a long time to clear?\n\n&gt; The decentralization is key. Without it that's just another currency controlled by a central figure\n\nWell, I'm not as averse to hard currency.  I'll take any pesky centralized currency you are sick of holding :-)\n\n\n&gt; As long as the average person buys and holds Bitcoin long term the elite won\u2019t ever be able to get it all. \n\nBut would that just guarantee it's death?  What good is a currency that doesn't circulate, which nobody is willing to use for buying and selling things?  It would be like illiquid real estate.\n\n\n&gt; Remember, there will only ever be 21 million bitcoin.\n\nI've heard that. But I've also heard there's only 10% left to be unlocked?\n\n\n&gt; And don\u2019t forget, crypto can make buying things online more anonymous because your name doesn\u2019t or personal info doesn\u2019t need to be attached to crypto. \n\nTo me that would be a drawback.  I don't buy anything illegal, and I'd rather my neighbors pay their share of taxes, so I don't it to be easy for them to do tax fraud.  And can't any Sec Treasury declare a ban at any time on the hidden transactions? \n\n\n&gt; As you can see I believe in Bitcoin and what it can do for society. \n\nSo what do see as the benefit to society?  You've said it would bypass central bank, which may or may not benefit society.  And the other feature was making tax dodging and money laundering easy for criminals, which is basically the opposite of good for society.  \n\nI'm still wondering about the heavy cost and delays of transactions.  \n\nBut to me, something that would meet your goal of an alternative to central money would be if say Google started Google dollars and let people of any station in life transact instantly, safely, for free.  \n\nThey'd instantly chop the legs out of elitist banks and Visa/MasterCard/PayPal, and democratize transactions for everyone.  I'd think that's something you'd appreciate?  \n\nSo all the societal benefit but without the societal drawbacks of Bitcoin.\n\n&gt; Get in now before the FOMO starts.\n\nWell frankly I did a long time ago, before bitcoin crashed hard.  But I did it through proxies like Square and Overstock and Nvidia.  But not sure if there's a current proxy I like.",

By the next day the stock had recovered and I missed my window to close thanks to my broker fucking me when I needed to sell, which seems to be disturbingly common.\n\nI remember calling them and telling them I wanted a broker, not a babysitter. The dude sounded completely annoyed like he was my dad and doing me a favor. He wasn't wrong in hindsight. I was like a chimp with a machine gun back then. I'm better now. But damn...let the monkey shoot his load if he wants.\n\nFidelity isn't a bad broker. But they're like strict parents. They're not quick to trust or forgiving if you throw a party and their risk department flags you as a retard. TD is like your friend's cool parents who don't really give a fuck. And Robinhood is the skeevy guy outside the liquor store selling fake IDs. That guy will hook you up with whatever you want. He's cool, but not really a friend.

I said I didn't know. Then he looked at me with those penetrating blue eyes and simply said in that soothing voice \"She seems like she's hungry.\"\nThen he lifted up his shirt and breastfed my niece right there in the salon lobby. \n\n\nTrue story.",

If you are buying TSLA now you are up for a hard reckoning.\n\n\"At a time like this, when our stock is reaching new highs, it may seem as though spending carefully is not as important. This is definitely not true.\n\nWhen looking at our actual profitability, it is very low at around 1% for the past year. Investors are giving us a lot of credit for future profits, but if, at any point, they conclude that\u2019s not going to happen, our stock will immediately get crushed like a souffl\u00e9 under a sledgehammer!\n\nMuch more important, in order to make our cars affordable, we have to get smarter about how we spend money. This a tough Game of Pennies \u2013 requiring thousands of good ideas to improve part cost, a factory process or simply the design, while increasing quality and capabilities. A great idea would be on that saves $5, but the vast majority are 50 cents here or 20 cents there.\n\nIn order to make the electric revolution happen we much make electric cars, stationary batteries and solar affordable to all.\n\nThanks and great working with you as always,\nElon\"",
