I don\u2019t even know what that means...the stock is already running why do they have to pump it? \n\nPumping a stock would also imply they are dumping later. Most of the stocks they tip are massive companies that pump and dump schemes simply wouldn\u2019t work even if every subscriber of motley fool started buying the stock immediately. Like are they going to pump and dump Netflix? That wouldn\u2019t make any sense. \n\nThey recommend a lot of stocks and they do tip stocks that are going on long bull runs. However that has, for the most part, be a pretty good strategy the last few years. Recommending a stock after it has been running already that day could be down to pure chance or they could be rushing out the recommendation to hop on the gains train.\n\nEither way this is a pretty flimsy argument and without more research I think it\u2019s kind of jumping to conclusions. \n\nI have nothing but good things to say after using the service.

        "body": "It reminds me of this thought: *When does the breadth of contemporary evidence supersede the depth of historical data?*\n\nGenerally, I agree with your overall sentiment, but not for the reasons you cite here. I think there's a couple of things being conflated in the messaging. First, a 3-fund portfolio isn't going to get you some kind of multi-digit percentage return most of the time. You invest in a 3-fund portfolio if you're trying to preserve your money. Comparing a 3-fund portfolio to (insert growth fund here) isn't quite a fair comparison because the goals are different.\n\nAdditionally, I will point out that thematic investing isn't new. ARK and others have been following themes to great success, and as long as the theme remains hot (technology, clean energy, genomics, medical devices, etc.) the funds will continue to do well. [IHI](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&amp;timePeriod=4&amp;startYear=1985&amp;firstMonth=1&amp;endYear=2020&amp;lastMonth=12&amp;calendarAligned=true&amp;includeYTD=false&amp;initialAmount=10000&amp;annualOperation=0&amp;annualAdjustment=0&amp;inflationAdjusted=true&amp;annualPercentage=0.0&amp;frequency=4&amp;rebalanceType=1&amp;absoluteDeviation=5.0&amp;relativeDeviation=25.0&amp;showYield=false&amp;reinvestDividends=true&amp;benchmark=VFINX&amp;portfolioNames=false&amp;portfolioName1=Portfolio+1&amp;portfolioName2=Portfolio+2&amp;portfolioName3=Portfolio+3&amp;symbol1=IHI&amp;allocation1_1=100), for example, has done a compounding return of of 15% per year since inception (2007), blowing away the SPY in all metrics (less drawdowns, higher return, lower volatility, etc.).\n\nTraditional thinking states that you can't beat the market over time, so why even bother trying. People who believe this accept it as fact, when there are so many other factors involved (e.g. was the person who picked stocks buying the same stocks every time they got paid?).  I expect this notion to be challenged over the next decade, and quite frankly, I hope the thinking dies out. There are plenty of funds and folks buying baskets of stocks (e.g. 10-20 stocks) especially now with fractional shares weighted for specific targets and are continuing to ascend to new highs.\n\nAs much as people want to speak poorly of strategies that differ from their index investing, rarely have I ever seen someone address the elephant in the room which is, \"By not investing in the index, you were able to beat the index.\" I've had many debates here about this because there is a camp of diehards who refuse to look at any kind of alternative data. If I say [here's an example of a basket of 3 stocks that has beat the SPY for the past 26+ years](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&amp;timePeriod=4&amp;startYear=1985&amp;firstMonth=1&amp;endYear=2020&amp;lastMonth=12&amp;calendarAligned=true&amp;includeYTD=false&amp;initialAmount=100000&amp;annualOperation=0&amp;annualAdjustment=0&amp;inflationAdjusted=true&amp;annualPercentage=0.0&amp;frequency=4&amp;rebalanceType=1&amp;absoluteDeviation=5.0&amp;relativeDeviation=25.0&amp;showYield=false&amp;reinvestDividends=true&amp;benchmark=VFINX&amp;portfolioNames=false&amp;portfolioName1=Portfolio+1&amp;portfolioName2=Portfolio+2&amp;portfolioName3=Portfolio+3&amp;symbol1=MSFT&amp;allocation1_1=33&amp;symbol2=WM&amp;allocation2_1=33&amp;symbol3=INTU&amp;allocation3_1=34), is that enough evidence to show that consistently beating the market is at least *possible?? (put your pitchforks down, I did not say guaranteed).* I've been talking about this for the entire lifecycle of this reddit account, so it's nothing new.\n\nIf you're a person who is looking for outsized returns, you'll need to go outside the index. Momentum is one strategy that has consistently worked to accomplish this.\n\nGood luck",

In other words, their trajectories are detached from what you believe should be a reality and therefore one shouldn\u2019t invest in them for \u201cthe long term\u201d.\n\nIf someone is interested in Thematic investing, then the ARK funds fit that niche. Owning an ARK* fund simplifies the research that a person needs to do in order to get a blended exposure to a specific theme. For many investors, this is \u201cgood enough\u201d, because they want a simplified approach for certain factors.\n\nThematic portfolios aren\u2019t something new, and the SPY  isn\u2019t some holy grail for where someone should always place their money. There\u2019s plenty of poor performing companies in the SPY, but their terrible performance is masked by the weighting mechanisms used to derive the portfolio. \n\nAs far as following a theme goes, Ishares Medical Device ETF (IHI) has outperformed the SPY for the past 12 (going on 13) years, and that\u2019s across all metrics (gross CAGR, drawdowns, volatility, etc.) \n\nIf 13 years isn\u2019t good enough, I\u2019ve pointed out many times over the years here that a portfolio of 34% MSFT, 33% INTU, 33% WM has [beaten the market](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&amp;timePeriod=4&amp;startYear=1985&amp;firstMonth=1&amp;endYear=2020&amp;lastMonth=12&amp;calendarAligned=true&amp;includeYTD=false&amp;initialAmount=10000&amp;annualOperation=0&amp;annualAdjustment=0&amp;inflationAdjusted=true&amp;annualPercentage=0.0&amp;frequency=4&amp;rebalanceType=1&amp;absoluteDeviation=5.0&amp;relativeDeviation=25.0&amp;showYield=false&amp;reinvestDividends=true&amp;benchmark=VFINX&amp;portfolioNames=false&amp;portfolioName1=Portfolio+1&amp;portfolioName2=Portfolio+2&amp;portfolioName3=Portfolio+3&amp;symbol1=MSFT&amp;allocation1_1=33&amp;symbol2=INTU&amp;allocation2_1=33&amp;symbol3=WM&amp;allocation3_1=34) almost every single year for the past 26 years. Again, just because it\u2019s worked 26 years in a row doesn\u2019t mean that it will keep persisting, but I wouldn\u2019t bet against that blend. \n\nFor me, figuring out where we are in a cycle and then building a basket of stocks around the metrics that I target has led to far better outcomes than investing in the SPY. I\u2019m typically purchasing at all cycles and l rarely change the stocks that I\u2019m holding, except to rebalance as things move away from my target allocations. \n\nI would be careful drawing conclusions based on one author or based on a specific investment style. No one has it all figured out. You have to figure what works for you, and how much risk you\u2019re willing to take.",

Small number of clients still and lower contract value vs PLTR but not government and not consulting business. i.e actual fucking growth potential.\nThey not only operate in same space but also face some of the same challenges, namely scaling down their product offering so it can address a broader market.\n\nInitial investors include MSFT and Blackrock at IPO. Underwritten by Morgan Stanley and JP Morgan/BofA. Founder is Tom Siebel of Seibel fame (yes, that POS Oracle software but whatever).\n\nIPO price if it actually lists at that will be about an 11x multiple of sales which is very reasonably priced.\n\nMake no mistake this is a better buy than PLTR ever was.",
