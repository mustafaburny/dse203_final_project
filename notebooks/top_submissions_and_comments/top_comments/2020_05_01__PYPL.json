Elon worked shitty jobs and when he ended up starting his first company (zip2) he and his Canadian illegal immigrant friend slept in their office because they couldn\u2019t rent an apartment. Elon doesn\u2019t speak to his dad to this day. \n\nZip2 sales gave him 20 or so million dollar. That money he used to found x.com (Paypal). Selling that gave him 170 million. He used that money to start SpaceX/Tesla. These sales are all on record, he\u2019d as self made as anyone else could be.",

Secondly, no one is \"shocked\" when you pull out cash as people who don't live in China cannot use most of the electronic payment options.  Also, the Chinese government demands that cash be accepted at all businesses.  In all but the smallest cities, there are people who don't live in China going to businesses and using cash.\n\n&gt;Paypal hit all time high today and it still may be a good time to get in.\n\nThis is all just painicked capital looking for a home.  Any hint of news and then a shit ton of money is thrown into it.  Reminds me of when any company that has the name \"blockchain\" in it doubled or tripled in a week.\n\nIt's stupid.  When the stimulus payments wear off and the increased UI payments go away, we're going to see company after company miss earnings targets and these 90x Forward P/E valuations are going away.\n\nI called the financial crisis before 2021 about 3 years ago and I'm calling this now.
