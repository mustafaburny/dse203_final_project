Elon doesn\u2019t speak to his dad to this day. \n\nZip2 sales gave him 20 or so million dollar. That money he used to found x.com (Paypal). Selling that gave him 170 million.

Secondly, no one is \"shocked\" when you pull out cash as people who don't live in China cannot use most of the electronic payment options.

Their week long run up leaves little room to go more upwards, and a lot of room to go down.\n\nI got lucky with fsly, but fsly and twilio, whom both skyrocketed, didn\u2019t really move at all the week prior to earnings. PayPal was the only exception in this case where hype and rise happened on both occasions. That was most likely a one off, especially due to their not so great earnings and having unexpected news that made them skyrocket. (Their increases user base with Venmo)\n\nTLDR: be careful playing calls on the earnings of big companies, especially fds",
