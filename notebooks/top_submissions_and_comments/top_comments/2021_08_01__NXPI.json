While companies don't have to win approval in their end markets, that would entail losing access to that consumer market, which would be terrible for business and almost certainly override any positives from the deal going thru. By the way, the US and EU do the exact same thing to foreign companies that export there. Recently, more deals are being held up for geopolitical and national security reasons. Read up on Qualcomm-NXP and Nvidia-ARM.",

The key here is that parts are ordered as and when they are needed so as to minimize warehousing idle parts. When the pandemic hit and we had that big crash most auto manufacturers have cancelled their chips orders as they were expecting economic slowdown and less cars demand. Nobody has expected this to be the shortest recession in history. On the other hand, electronics manufacturers were happy to take those cancelled slots as they were experiencing unprecedented demand because of work-from-home orders. Well, to everyone's surprise we had V shaped recovery and very strong demand for new cars. Car manufacturers tried to re-book their slots for chips their needed but chips manufacturers said, \"sorry, we sold all the capacity you cancelled to electronics companies, you'll have to wait\". On top of that we had Samsung and NXP outages due to Texas winter blackouts and major fire in Renesas facilities (all these companies are major chips fabs). So that's how we got where we are.",
