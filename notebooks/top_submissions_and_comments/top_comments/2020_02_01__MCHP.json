They\u2019re an AI, software, battery, solar, energy, microchip, potentially robo taxi company amongst others. \n\nThey have around 2billion miles of self driving data. The next biggest company has around 20million afaik. \nThat\u2019s significantly more data. \n\nThey may not have refined their production processes yet, but Tesla is years ahead of the competition in terms of the next era in technology. Most other companies are sitting on their hands right now because they\u2019re complacent with where they\u2019re at.",
