Likewise, with a calendar spread, you are long vega, yet because shorter dated options have larger IV swings, it can act like short vega.\n\nAnother example is a call ZEBRA - for all strike ranges from the current stock price up, it acts like 100 shares of stock and you're neutral in theta. But under that price, you're short theta. Very similar in other ratio spreads or broken wing flies where if you have a stock near the max profit zone, you won't realize it until very close to expiration as the Greeks flip.\n\nSo it's complicated to say the least...",
