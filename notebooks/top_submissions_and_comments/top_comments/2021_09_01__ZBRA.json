        "body": "&gt;It is a directional play and has 2X the downside risk to the strike the calls were purchased, for only 1X upside potential.\n\nI'm not sure what you mean by this. With any long option or spread, your max loss is the price you paid. The upside potential is unlimited. It's 100 long deltas.\n\nI suppose in this case you could divide the premium by 100 and say that's your range before max loss. A spread with 100 deltas will roughly behave that way, but not exactly, since you'll lose net deltas if the underlying moves against you.\n\n&gt;Not a bad idea if you're confident in direction. Could bite you if direction doesn't work out and you have no hedge.\n\nOP is asking about a PMCC. This is a simulated stock position which is directional. I'm suggesting other ways to simulate stock than just a far dated, deep ITM call.\n\n&gt;I believe Liz and Jenny from TastyTrade/Works created this idea - or at least brought it to the public eye.\n\nThat's correct that TT coined that phrase and popularized the idea. Backspreads or back ratio-spreads have been around long before TT. Any long ratio spread will reduce your negative extrinsic value. The ZEBRA is a specific type of backspread that seeks to have zero extrinsic. I just find it's easier to explain it rather than confuse people with specific names.\n\n&gt;The idea that extrinsic values are negative is in how you frame the value of an option.\n\nNot really. This is just options terminology. If something works in your favor you are \"long\" or it's \"positive.\" Same as any greek or price factor. If you buy an option, you have \"negative\" extrinsic, meaning that value will work against you over time. If you sell an option, you have positive extrinsic. It's not something TT invented.\n\n&gt;Option Premium = intrinsic + extrinsic\n\nThis is true for ITM options. OTM options do not have intrinsic value and will decay to zero, as long as they stay OTM. The same way deep ITM options have very little extrinsic.",

Intrinsic and Extrinsic are typically positive. Sign changes are made to a trader's liking/understanding. \n\nI know TastyWorks does this negative stuff but IMO it is not a good idea. It confuses people more than it helps if you ask me.\n\nAn option must have an extrinsic value until full expiration. When you introduce terms like negative extrinsic it becomes very nuanced and could confuse someone into thinking that extrinsic value doesn't exist, it actually reduces the cost of the option! Or something like that... this is not true and is why I dislike the the usage/perspective of explaining it as a negative value without full and proper context. \n\nJust my 2 cents.",

This will give you pretty descent leverage (4x).\n\nThe zebra strategy is a good one look at two but harder to manage then a synthetic long stock.
