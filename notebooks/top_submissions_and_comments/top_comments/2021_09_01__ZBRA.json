Just off the top of my head without looking at the option chain for appl, I would be long any upward movement in aapl 1:1 because I\u2019m buying 2 70 delta calls and selling 1 40 delta call. (70x2 - 40x1= 100 delta).    \n    Im headed off to play catch w the kids but I\u2019ll pull up the chain and lay out the numbers for you a little later.\n   Maybe I should start start a seperate thread for this as it\u2019s getting off-strategy from your original post?",

        "body": "&gt;but would it take even less BP doing a tighter PCS\n\nYes, with a tight spread it would take less BP but also you would be burning much more theta and have lower delta.  With a true synthetic you don't have to pay a debit.  If you go tight spread you would have less downside but pay a larger debit for the call.\n\n&gt;Also can you detail the last \u2018bonus\u2019 he provided long 2x 75D and short the 50D - wouldn\u2019t this just be a call debit spread plus another long call?\n\nYes, you can think of it that way.  Specifically, it's a back ratio spread.\n\n&gt;Wouldn\u2019t it theoretically be better to do calendars/PMCCs?\n\nThe ZEBRA strategy stands for \"Zero Extrinsic Back Ratio\"  It is actually similar to just buying LEAPS, but your breakeven will be at the current stock price since you are cancelling out the extrinsic value.  With LEAPS your breakeven will be something greater than the current stock price.",

Alas, if in your example, aapl never falls below that strike, buying the long end of the strike turned out to be a waste of Money if you want to own the shares.   \n     Have you looked into a ZEBRA?  Buy 2 70 delta calls and sell 1 40/50 delta call.  You are then long 200 share for the strikes between 70 delta and 40\u2019delta and then long 100 shares above 40 delta for zero extrinsic cost.
