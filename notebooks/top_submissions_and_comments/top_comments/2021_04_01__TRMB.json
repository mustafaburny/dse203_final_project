The top 10 holdings aren't as stupid as some of the stuff - L3Harris, Iridium, LockMart, and Thales are actual space companies. Trimble and Kratos are also pretty close to spacey.

        "body": "So I work for McLane Foodservice here in Houston, Tx and we were suppose to pick up Jack in the Box this summer. Due to us closing a deal with Whataburger, those JIB plans have been scrapped temporarily. What we were planning to do was send a empty trailer from Houston to Dallas and have a full load of JIB shuttled back to be distributed around the Houston area. We have done this in the past with companies such as Arby's and Panda Express. Multiple trailers go up empty while swapping trailers and coming back with 40k lbs of food product to be delivered. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOk, so now that I got that out of the way. McLane Foodservice is one of Berkishire Hathaways holdings. Been around since the year 1906, family owned until Sam Walton bought it and the old owner bought the Astros. (not important) Sam Walton eventually sold after Pepsi, AmeriServ, PFS, and Finally Berkshire. (might not be 100% accurate on timeline of ownership)\n\nRecently, McLane invested in Orange EV yard trucks (bobtails that move trailers around the parking lot and docked into building doors to be loaded) at some of their locations. As of January/February I was having a discussion with our director of operations and he said that we would not be hiring any extra drivers when we take on JIB this summer and trailers would be shuttled using the driverless technology in these trucks by AEVA. \n\nNow, it was cool to hear that but at the same time it was hard to believe that we would be incorporating a technology that hasn't even been figured out in mainstream automobiles to be 100% safe and we are expecting this company to have figured it out in Semi-Trucks. The technology would drive the truck from the Distribution Center in Dallas to the Distribution Center in Houston all the way to the entrance gate before a driver on location takes over. \n\nSince we have scrapped the JIB plans for now, I don't know much more about what is happening with this technology but it all started from what is going on with our DC is Arizona. I was told they are or have been using this in Phoenix with this driverless technology. I could attempt to find out more information but the company right now is not worth much. I think that once phones are mandatory, and everyone has internet as well as road ratings (driverless % ratings of auto-piolet disablement) with quick updates to construction through city contracts and policys, this will still not be 100%. Highway use may be a different story but like what just happened not to far from where I live in The Woodlands, Texas, that Tesla Car Crash is a concern because the technology didn't respond. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPublic (Stock) Companies we also use daily are Trimble, VMWare, Zebra, Volvo Trucks, Freightliner trucks. We service Yum Foods (Taco Bell, KFC, Pizza Hut), Chilies, Applebee's, IHOP, Whataburger, Buffalo Wild Wings, Chick Fil-A, Golden Coral, and others. Our grocery division has contracts with Walgreens as well. We are nation wide and that's what landed us the distribution contract with Whataburger. We make 65-100k+ a year and we are always hiring. 4 day work weeks but you can work more if you want more $. If you or anyone you know that has a CDL, is mentally tough, and has a good attitude but kinda edgy, please make them aware as job openings are ramping up and we want to help employ people that want to work at McLane. \n\nSummary; I gave you the inside scoop on our companies use of OP mentioned company and an potential job opportunity for you or someone you know",

        "body": "Over/under-valued is supposed to be fundamental. You should keep that separate from your opinion on it.\n\nYou should be psychologically and emotionally able to say, \"I recognize that the stock is currently over-valued, but I think it has a better future than the professionals realize, so I still like it at this price.\"\n\nWhen you're completely honest about your evaluation, you end up with better information about what your opinion actually is. In this case, do you actually have better information about Apple's future than everybody else? Is there some popular idea about Apple that pulls the stock price down, that you think is incorrect? Are they planning to move into some new area of business that you understand, and most people don't realize is important?\n\nFor example, AMD. My day job is firmware engineer. AMD put out a press release earlier this year about two new patents. All the analysis I read, both in the stock market, and on the engineering websites, presumed these are two different, unrelated things, that they just coincidentally talked about on the same day. I disagree; I think they're part of one new future product, that is also related to their Xilinx acquisition, and will bring real advantages to their server products. Right now their server market share is only 10%; the forecasts are that they will increase this to 20% in about 18 months. If they come out with a new product that enhances their competitive position in this area right when they're also already expanding their market share, that could be a huge driver for them and for the stock. So I think the stock is really worth at least 15% more than it can be objectively valued at now. But that doesn't mean it is undervalued now; just that I have a higher price target!\n\nAnother example is if a hedge fund releases research report that bad-mouths a company, and the stock goes down, and you read the report (most people don't even read it, they just sell!) and you think the report doesn't actually accuse them of anything. So then you might reasonably have a different evaluation than others.\n\nAs with all other parts of trading and investing, psychology is the most critical aspect of success. Don't be credulous of your own opinions; and treat your emotions with skepticism. When you love a stock, be nervous about your evaluation. You want to trade on what you rationally think will go up, not what you love.\ud83d\udc7c",

Personally, I think it clears 100 after earnings, AND prob does when XLNX merger is official (since that helps em with the server market share).",

AMD is currently worth $81, so a share of XLNX should be worth $139.  But it isn't, it's $130, because there is a small risk the deal wont go through.\n\nThe last major hurdle to the merger is the shareholder meeting on April 7th.  So take your 4k and buy 20 $132 XLNX calls exp 4/9.  If the price goes to $139 after the meeting, you go up 350%.",

When ( IF? ) AWS starts using AMD for EC2, AMD is going to the moon for sure.\n\ncons - Intel's new CEO Pat Gelsinger seems to be quite competent, and most of their announcements as of recent times have been a confidence boost in the face of their past failures.\n\nI think it's a good buy for the quarter at least.",
