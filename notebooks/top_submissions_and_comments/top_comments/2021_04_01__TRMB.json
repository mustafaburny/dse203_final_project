Like movie theaters, resorts, etc. will go up organically as people start to get out. Gas prices rise in the summer, construction companies not running TRMB equipment will NOT be able to compete in the industry much longer(I use it at work and am up 20% in a year), things like that.

        "body": "So I work for McLane Foodservice here in Houston, Tx and we were suppose to pick up Jack in the Box this summer. Due to us closing a deal with Whataburger, those JIB plans have been scrapped temporarily. What we were planning to do was send a empty trailer from Houston to Dallas and have a full load of JIB shuttled back to be distributed around the Houston area. We have done this in the past with companies such as Arby's and Panda Express. Multiple trailers go up empty while swapping trailers and coming back with 40k lbs of food product to be delivered. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOk, so now that I got that out of the way. McLane Foodservice is one of Berkishire Hathaways holdings. Been around since the year 1906, family owned until Sam Walton bought it and the old owner bought the Astros. (not important) Sam Walton eventually sold after Pepsi, AmeriServ, PFS, and Finally Berkshire. (might not be 100% accurate on timeline of ownership)\n\nRecently, McLane invested in Orange EV yard trucks (bobtails that move trailers around the parking lot and docked into building doors to be loaded) at some of their locations. As of January/February I was having a discussion with our director of operations and he said that we would not be hiring any extra drivers when we take on JIB this summer and trailers would be shuttled using the driverless technology in these trucks by AEVA. \n\nNow, it was cool to hear that but at the same time it was hard to believe that we would be incorporating a technology that hasn't even been figured out in mainstream automobiles to be 100% safe and we are expecting this company to have figured it out in Semi-Trucks. The technology would drive the truck from the Distribution Center in Dallas to the Distribution Center in Houston all the way to the entrance gate before a driver on location takes over. \n\nSince we have scrapped the JIB plans for now, I don't know much more about what is happening with this technology but it all started from what is going on with our DC is Arizona. I was told they are or have been using this in Phoenix with this driverless technology. I could attempt to find out more information but the company right now is not worth much. I think that once phones are mandatory, and everyone has internet as well as road ratings (driverless % ratings of auto-piolet disablement) with quick updates to construction through city contracts and policys, this will still not be 100%. Highway use may be a different story but like what just happened not to far from where I live in The Woodlands, Texas, that Tesla Car Crash is a concern because the technology didn't respond. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPublic (Stock) Companies we also use daily are Trimble, VMWare, Zebra, Volvo Trucks, Freightliner trucks. We service Yum Foods (Taco Bell, KFC, Pizza Hut), Chilies, Applebee's, IHOP, Whataburger, Buffalo Wild Wings, Chick Fil-A, Golden Coral, and others. Our grocery division has contracts with Walgreens as well. We are nation wide and that's what landed us the distribution contract with Whataburger. We make 65-100k+ a year and we are always hiring. 4 day work weeks but you can work more if you want more $. If you or anyone you know that has a CDL, is mentally tough, and has a good attitude but kinda edgy, please make them aware as job openings are ramping up and we want to help employ people that want to work at McLane. \n\nSummary; I gave you the inside scoop on our companies use of OP mentioned company and an potential job opportunity for you or someone you know",

It\u2019s an infrastructure play very strong within the US developing needs. It\u2019s a strong stock and knowing that Ark has it invested in the same vein as their fanboy love of Tesla it could really be injected and have tremendous numbers and value growth by next year. Yes there are haters yes there are naysayers and people parading around screaming all the negative hysteria\u2019s in the world. But in my eyes this stock has very very good numbers come May. Injecting 10k on TRIMBLE now, holding for a year?? Forget about it your gonna be mega rich in the Tesla numbers only you\u2019d have been lucky to buy Tesla before it was over 80$ Tesla is now pushing 650-700 range nowadays",
