So you\u2019re probably best off having most of your money in something like spy. But I know that\u2019s not much fun (I pick my own stocks for my Roth IRA). So if you want to pick stocks, I\u2019d say have 15-20 companies or so (more is fine with zero commissions now). Pick stocks that have monopolies (Apple, Facebook, Google, Amazon), the strongest brands (Starbucks, Disney, Nike), and stocks which are growing their earnings and their revenue consistently over time (United health, Home Depot). Plus maybe throw in some newer companies (just 1 or 2 or a few more if you want more than 20 stocks) that have hyper growth and you think will be dominant in 2030 or whatever (square, crowdstrike, Zillow). AI is good! (Nvidia, Tesla) And definitely have half or more of your stocks NOT tech! New investors seem to want mostly tech....you need diversity. Also, really try to have most of your stocks be on the cheaper side as far as forward P/E ratio. Under 30 forward p/e is good right now. And if it\u2019s higher, at least have a lowish PEG ratio, like Amazon. Dividends are good too! Other stocks which will be great for many years to come are Linde, Deere, JP Morgan, Blackrock, Microsoft, Goldman Sachs, PayPal, Lam Research, Chipotle, Visa. Do your thing! Make sure you\u2019re super diverse and have mostly the biggest, best companies that will grow earnings and revenue for many years!",

Every industry thats booming needs them. The shortage is a positive thing for us. Demand is high. We dont want a glut. We want to operate at a slight shortage. That said, we will need perfect numbers to start the next leg up or a breather to let things cool off.

        "body": "A comment I was replying to was deleted, it was basically asking about different ways to play semis this summer on a budget, and mentioned they had done calls on SOXL and puts on SOXS so far. So I wanted to post the reply here anyway.\n\n\\---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSOXL/counter-SOXS is a good way to play the semi expansion through all of its phases; I have long SOXL in my investment account for this reason. It's 3x levered already, so adding leverage through options takes nerves of steel, because that leverage swings both directions -- you will need to ride out the stomach-churning drops that can happen day-to-day. However, swing-trading or scalping options on SOXL/SOXS can work, because the semi industry only has tailwinds right now, and at 1,000 feet, I think SOX/SOXL/counter-SOXS trends upwards through this year.\n\nIt's possible to do the same with individual names, including some of the ones I mentioned. One of the issues will be figuring out whether the recent gap-ups in names like AMAT, ASML, LRCX and TER are fully pricing in PEG, because AMAT jumped from 24x TTM earnings to 30x; TER jumped from about the same level to 27x; LRCX to 28x. But that's all TTM earnings -- these companies are expecting additional earnings growth this year on the back of announcements by Intel and TSMC to spend upwards of at least $120B over the next three years ($100B announced by TSMC, $20B so far announced by Intel, with a hint of more to come later this year). In Feb 2021, [the AMAT earnings release had already painted a rosy picture for 2021](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/02/19/applied-materials-amat-q1-2021-earnings-call-trans/); we'll possibly know more come the [AMAT Investor Day on April 6](https://ir.appliedmaterials.com/events/event-details/investor-meeting). Also know that AMAT supplies not just the CPU/GPU manufacturers, but also has good exposure to the memory semiconductor manufacturers, such as Micron (MU), who just had an incredible ER and gave impressive 2021 projections.\n\nI keep singling out AMAT because in terms of options, they are the most liquid, and therefore the most accessible; ASML and LRCX are great companies but their options chains tend to be less liquid than AMAT's; LRCX is a bit better than ASML's in this regard. These could be good LEAPS opportunities if you are willing to wait out IV before entering, and wait out buyers when you go to sell. TER only has monthlies, and have OK liquidity around the money, but you can still get decent action out to 0.04 delta above the money on TER calls. TER IVR is currently 11, but the options are still running in the 40s/50s for IV. \n\nI had previously done 113/114 put credit spreads on AMAT for Mar-5 and Mar-12 expirations, and those both held (Mar-5 closed at 113.45 IIRC, however). I later opened a PMCC on AMAT for Jan22\\[80c\\]/Mar-26\\[121c\\] and ended up chasing the short higher because AMAT jumped so fast (up to that point, AMAT had been trending steadily upwards, but not leaping like it has the past few days). I was able to get out of the short (which I had rolled to Apr-9 125) when AMAT retreated a bit, and then sold the LEAPS too because I figured the spike was done -- regretting that now. ;) I'm waiting a few more days to see if the churn is done (and for IV to come back down), and will probably open another LEAPS on it at some point. AMAT is still pretty volatile -- IVR 46 (which is unusual for them up to this point this year) and Apr-16 options are still in the 40s and 50s, favoring selling, rather than paying, premiums. \n\nI don't think we see a retreat in any of these names this summer; they've been able to withstand the rotation in and out of tech the past couple of weeks, which suggests that traders and investors are finally done painting everything that smells of tech with the same broad brush.",

TSM, Samsung and INTC have near-term headwinds in terms of earnings based on semiconductor demand simply because it takes so long to expand capacity. The front-end winners in current semi production efforts are going to be those who supply the tools, products and services that go into these fabs that are planned for construction: AMAT, ASML, TER, LRCX, to name a few. Secondary effects on earnings from this will come 1-2-3 years down the line for the semi manufacturers themselves, depending on whether or not they are expanding/upgrading an existing facility, or building one from the ground up.\n\nThe end-users of these semiconductor products (GM, F, NVDA, AMD, etc.) will be the last ones to benefit from expanded chipmaking capacity, as easing the demand crunch allows them to resume normal sales levels. Note that for auto mfrs, this has a ripple effect on rental car companies, who sold all of their fleets in fire sales last year and now can't replace them because the auto mfrs can't make cars.\n\nAdditionally, TSMC is booked up for the foreseeable future; these bookings have prices agreed well in advance, and are almost certainly not subject to TSMC's recent statements that they plan to increase prices; that will happen with new bookings down the line.",

        "body": "Your analysis is probably true for delta, but the problem with playing those names using vol is that the IV is higher. Options trading is most useful when you get the gamma cheap while also calling the direction right.\n\nI'm buying INTC 23Apr 70c because resistance at 65 has kept IV muted. My bet is that INTC will break through that resistance on 6Apr or 23Apr. I hate talking in terms of resistance in general, but looking at the long-term chart as well as price action in the morning after the Intel Unleashed event, it certainly seems like you'd need a big catalyst to justify a breakout beyond 65. I'd probably play those profits -- if any -- into AMD puts through to May, because I think hedge fund selling will take place when Lisa Su inevitably acknowledges the incorrectness of her prediction that supply \"tightness\" would clear up by 2H21.\n\nI also believe that the Archegos liquidation is another sign that correlated hedge fund losses will spell disaster for the market. We saw this already with GME and the other short-squeeze names. Chipmakers like to lay out their capex as close to production ramp-up as possible, which means that LRCX/AMAT/ASML/KLIC/KLAC/CAJ/etc won't book profits immediately even if billions of dollars are allocated to the roadmap. So I'm waiting for a big selloff this summer to get into those names as a long-term position. May try to play that selloff using hedgie favorites and names that have a lot of room to fall. ARKK, TSLA, TSM, NVDA come to mind. TSM seems counterintuitive but you get the added potential catalyst of Chinese brinkmanship as well as a deepening of the water supply woes.\n\nI mention CAJ because it gives a good read on DUV demand. Their equipment segment had a lot of profit growth last quarter. But it's not as good a play as the others because only a fifth of its revenue comes from that segment.",

        "body": " TL:DR - looking for feedback on a simple hi return stock screen and thoughts on how to rank results.\n\nEarly 60's, simple, diversified, buy and hold retirement portfolio approach my whole life. Looking at working probably another 5-10 years and starting to get a lot more active in my portfolio. Nothing crazy and I'm fundamentally a conservative+ investor, but I do not subscribe to moving 100% into ultra safe right before retirement. Portfolio size is low 7 figure for reference.\n\nOver the past few months I subscribed to a couple of authors on Seeking Alpha and have tried out a few strategies with minimal exposure and have a good idea of how to use some of the approaches in my portfolio. I want to develop my own screens because at least on Seeking Alpha, the authors I've found charge a small monthly fee for their updates. It's nothing huge, and for me at least has been worth seeing their approaches, but nothing I want to pay for the rest of my life.\n\nI'm going to put together a dividend screen/strategy and a \"better than cash\" parking lot strategy. Pretty basic and straightforward. I also just got started on putting together a screen to identify a more hi growth strategy - thought being on a monthly basis invest in the top 4 stocks that fall out of the screen. Would love some feedback on the screen (I'm stock knowledgeable, but certainly not an expert). When looking at the screen and giving feedback keep in mind my objective: not looking for the perfect approach or for mega returns, I'm an 80/20 kinda guy so looking for a decent, simple to execute strategy to reliably give back a growth-class return. (And using the Fidelity screener as that's where my portfolio is).\n\nScreen as it stand currently:\n\n* Tagging Energy, Health Care, Financials, Information Technology and Industrials sectors\n* Market cap down to Medium (as defined by Fidelity: 6-33B)\n* 13 week price performance down to 13%\n* 3 yr annualized Beta of 1.1 and up (conflicted on whether this really helps the screen)\n* Very Bullish or Bullish analyst recommendations (Summary score from StarMine)\n* Forward EPS 3-5 yrs high to very high (16.5% and up)\n* EPS growth Projected year versus last year high to very high (40% and up)\n\nAs an example, running that screen today resulted in a list of 7 stocks (sorry not allowed to link image or would give you a shot of the fundamentals):\n\n1. AMAT - Applied materials\n2. FANG - Diamondback Energy\n3. EOG - EOG Resources\n4. NXPI - NXP SemiConductor\n5. KKR - KKR &amp; Co\n6. LRCX - LAM Research Corp\n7. MU - Micron Technology\n\nSo the thought would be to run this first day of every month and put a set amount in the top 4 stocks in the filter. I would guess some stocks might stay in for months, some might rotate in and out quickly.\n\nMy question is basically around how to rank. So do I just pick a screening metric (or some other metric) and do a simple rank on that metric to determine top 4, or do I create a formula to weight and aggregate multiple metrics into an overall score and rank on that?\n\nSorry for the long post - thank you to those who stuck with it and are willing to share your thoughts.",

That means TSM, INTC, MU, TSEM, Samsung, and TXN as your semi stocks, ASML, AMAT, KLAC, LRCX as your front end capital guys.  I also like AMKR and ICHR, even though they aren't technically on the front end side of things, and maybe 3-6 months from now I'll perk up on companies like KLIC.\n\nI'm not big on HIMAX's short term prospects, because I think the semi shortage will hurt them as much as help them, and I'm not big on their long-term prospects because I think it's only a matter of time before a bigger fabless company acquires one of Himax's direct competitors.",

It already went up 500%, means it'll keep that pace forever. \n\nI think the one speculative stock I like that I purchased recently was lam research, I aim to hold that for years though. Other than that I'm bullish on banks, I picked em all up early March 2020 so I'm already doing well on them. Goldman Sachs I really liked  last year, it's growth is priced in, if it doesn't keep it's pace the share price will likely falter. \n\nI like Cigna a whole lot right now, as well as vertex pharmaceuticals. I do not own vertex, I sold last year. but I would like to own it again at some point, I've been buying cigna more recently. \n\nGE is my favorite, I've been playing it last year with leaps and 3-6 month calls and decided that I should finally buy some shares with all the sweet gains it has given me. \n\nConstellations and altria I like a lot because it's safe marijuana exposure without the pump and dumps. Also altrias dividend is nice although I don't view it as a value stock, I may have to trim that one down as I see it getting close to overvalued. \n\nAPD is a great stock, good green hydrogen and commodity play. More low-key and a boring slow mover but I see in the next 5 years it doing very well.",

They are getting their revenue boost sooner as TSMC, Samsung etc. add capacity.",

Not a lot at all, but enough to compensate a bit if my port retraces a bit, I'd rather hold than sell right now.\n\nI'm not big on tech in my port, but I am bullish. I have about ~11% tech. I think the semiconductor stocks will be my largest holdings in that category moving forward. \n\nI hate crypto honestly, the function of it is all the same whether or not it's expensive. It's just whatever someone is willing to pay into it to hold it for an asset. I don't understand it the way I can read and understand a stock. But blockchain tech is a bit interesting, although I think practical use is far away.\n\nMy thesis for crypto will be to test it in a bear market, and see if it outperforms gold and metals. I have a feeling it might. But I wouldn't ever consider buying it now, it's lofty.\n\nI don't think we're IN a bubble, I think certain sectors are in a bubble, but I think for once, big tech is not part of that. I think crypto and the ev/autos may be in slightly lofty territory, but I think it's because people are excited for the next step of innovation. And SOME tech is relatively cheap for their growth prospects right now,(more so a couple weeks ago.) referencing my AMD and lam research picks. I think they always have room to pullback, but those are good buying opportunities in an industry that is only growing.",
