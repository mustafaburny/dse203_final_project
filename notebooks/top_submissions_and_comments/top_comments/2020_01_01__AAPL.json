This counts are ordinary income for the market value of the stock on the day you receive it.\n2) Selling the stock for a profit. This counts as a short-term or long-term capital gain (depending on how long you held it) of the amount its price increased by.\n\nFor example, suppose you received a free share of AAPL on July 30, 2019. AAPL closed at $213.04 that day, so you would report $213.04 as income. Now suppose you sold it on December 31, 2019 for $291.52. Your short-term capital gain is $291.52 - $213.04 = $78.48. Whether either of these events increases the taxes you have to pay depends on your other income, your filing status, other gains/losses, etc.\n\nI'm thinking of writing a tax primer for Robinhood users and posting it here sometime during the next few days since there seem to be so many questions.",

Your very existence was priced in decades ago when the market was valuing Standard Oil's expected future earnings based on population growth that would lead to your birth, what age you would get a car, how many times you would drive your car every week, how many times you take the bus/train, etc. Anything you can think of has already been priced in, even the things you aren't thinking of. You have no original thoughts. Your consciousness is just an illusion, a product of the omniscent market. Free will is a myth. The market sees all, knows all and will be there from the beginning of time until the end of the universe (the market has already priced in the heat death of the universe).

I also filtered on market cap to avoid penny stocks, and a few other factors.\n\nWith the list I had, I did some research on each and tried to guess which would continue their growth during a recovery. I was focused on growth, but I know plenty of other people who were picking up dividend growth stocks on a steep discount.\n\nMy best two picks were AAPL and ISRG.\n\nThe strategy I used wouldn't have worked well during the dotcom bubble burst because many of those companies never recovered or took ~10 years to eventually recover. But because the recession was due to factors unrelated to overvalued tech (the housing bubble), I felt confident investing in tech stocks and it paid of *really fucking well* for me.",

        "body": "**Magical Crayons TA.**\n\n[As I was saying yesterday](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/euueg4/what_are_your_moves_tomorrow_january_28/ffrtwgr/), indicators were at oversold because we never had a reaction at the support level. I also said that normally it would have been a good place to buy the dip, but buying didn't come. I ascribed it to impending volatility and that waiting seemed wise. \n\nToday we did reverse up, and did so in a way that looked almost like a \"delayed\" reaction at the crayon support levels I had drawn, [gapping up almost precisely to the support and fighting up on the 5 minute chart.](https://imgur.com/7883OJk) \n\nWith AAPL beating and futures mooning, I normally would be saying this is continued business as usual, even with some impending volatility ahead. But while we often joke about needing to feel the market around here, I really do have an uncomfortable feeling about this market behavior.  So for this Magical Crayons TA episode I will withhold any of my own ranges or predictions. For those that still want numbers, Bollinger Bands gives ranges at approximately 322.7-330.2. I think the earnings release of multiple big companies tomorrow AH and the FOMC meeting in the morning will provide better guidance from my own crayons. \n\nI hope you all grow lots of tendies tomorrow and let's see what Papa Powell does to the market.",

I bet I've typed those words 200 times now.\n\nBy default, it's the mark price that triggers the stop.  I'm not 100% sure RH does it this way too for most brokers, they use the midpoint between bid and ask to mark the price.  This works fine for a stock that normally has a bid/ask a few cents apart.  With an option, even something more liquid like AAPL, the spread can be a dollar or more wide.   So if the bid price drops to an unrealistic number, the platform just adjusts the midpoint, even if no one would ever sell for that price.   So now, with no real trade even happening, your trigger is hit and a market order to sell goes in to the market.  I see you used a stop limit.  That's only a little better than a stop because what do you set the limit to?",

So this external cash flow should in no way impact its stock price, as that is sound based on actual cash flows from consumer group.

        "body": "My experience has been that with a large special dividend, the share price will drop equal to the amount of the dividend on the payment date.  So if NLOK is $28 now, when it pays the dividend you will get $12 cash and the share price should drop to $16.  If you then sell your shares, you will end up with the same amount of money, but will have to pay additional taxes on that dividend.  \n\nTax treatment of special dividends can be different from regular dividends, and can sometimes be treated by the IRS as ordinary income or a return of capital (meaning your cost basis will adjust, and you won't get a capital loss for taxes).  And if you don't hold the shares for 61 days, those dividends will be unqualified and taxed even higher.  As a short-term bet, you're probably losing money after taxes.  \n\nMore on Special Dividends: https://www.simplysafedividends.com/intelligent-income/posts/234-special-dividend-definition-rules-and-impact-on-stock-price\n\nYou need to do a lot more research before chasing special dividends.  There's no free money.\n\nIf you really like NLOK and want to own it long-term, I would wait until after the share price drops on the dividend date and then buy it.  Avoid the taxes on the dividend and buy more shares with the same amount of money.",

But it's not quite as straightforward as that. In the article's example, the stock makes a run up prior to the dividend payout (probably due to yield chasers) then drops down by the amount of the payout. But this drop is not the amount of the payout if you take the pre-run up as your starting point, so you still may have come out ahead.",
