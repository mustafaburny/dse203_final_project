This counts are ordinary income for the market value of the stock on the day you receive it.\n2) Selling the stock for a profit. This counts as a short-term or long-term capital gain (depending on how long you held it) of the amount its price increased by.\n\nFor example, suppose you received a free share of AAPL on July 30, 2019. AAPL closed at $213.04 that day, so you would report $213.04 as income. Now suppose you sold it on December 31, 2019 for $291.52. Your short-term capital gain is $291.52 - $213.04 = $78.48. Whether either of these events increases the taxes you have to pay depends on your other income, your filing status, other gains/losses, etc.\n\nI'm thinking of writing a tax primer for Robinhood users and posting it here sometime during the next few days since there seem to be so many questions.",

I also filtered on market cap to avoid penny stocks, and a few other factors.\n\nWith the list I had, I did some research on each and tried to guess which would continue their growth during a recovery. I was focused on growth, but I know plenty of other people who were picking up dividend growth stocks on a steep discount.\n\nMy best two picks were AAPL and ISRG.\n\nThe strategy I used wouldn't have worked well during the dotcom bubble burst because many of those companies never recovered or took ~10 years to eventually recover. But because the recession was due to factors unrelated to overvalued tech (the housing bubble), I felt confident investing in tech stocks and it paid of *really fucking well* for me.",

This has already started a couple of years ago and will continue to do so until basically all of the old companies that used to be in those categories are forgotten like old railroad companies and the new categories will be based of the new technology.

I also said that normally it would have been a good place to buy the dip, but buying didn't come. I ascribed it to impending volatility and that waiting seemed wise. \n\nToday we did reverse up, and did so in a way that looked almost like a \"delayed\" reaction at the crayon support levels I had drawn, [gapping up almost precisely to the support and fighting up on the 5 minute chart.](https://imgur.com/7883OJk) \n\nWith AAPL beating and futures mooning, I normally would be saying this is continued business as usual, even with some impending volatility ahead. But while we often joke about needing to feel the market around here, I really do have an uncomfortable feeling about this market behavior.  So for this Magical Crayons TA episode I will withhold any of my own ranges or predictions. For those that still want numbers, Bollinger Bands gives ranges at approximately 322.7-330.2. I think the earnings release of multiple big companies tomorrow AH and the FOMC meeting in the morning will provide better guidance from my own crayons. \n\nI hope you all grow lots of tendies tomorrow and let's see what Papa Powell does to the market.",

I bet I've typed those words 200 times now.\n\nBy default, it's the mark price that triggers the stop.  I'm not 100% sure RH does it this way too for most brokers, they use the midpoint between bid and ask to mark the price.  This works fine for a stock that normally has a bid/ask a few cents apart.  With an option, even something more liquid like AAPL, the spread can be a dollar or more wide.   So if the bid price drops to an unrealistic number, the platform just adjusts the midpoint, even if no one would ever sell for that price.   So now, with no real trade even happening, your trigger is hit and a market order to sell goes in to the market.  I see you used a stop limit.  That's only a little better than a stop because what do you set the limit to?",

It might've been funds trying to buy the stock because there was a large request to short it, so they bought it so they could lend it out. now this shit may sound like a bunch of baloney, but i would bet that we do not see any recovery soon until mid jan at the earliest. there is no positive news until then which they could release to pump the market. china trade deal is set, and can only backfire if china backs out, the positives are already priced in. earnings doesnt start till mid-late january, so stocks will continue sliding down until then\n\n(im buying puts and GLD btw, if im wrong u can thank me for saving ur calls)",

Apple doubling over the past year with no to little profit increase is another.  Am I the only one to remember 1999?  From Mar of 99 to Mar of 2000 the NASDAQ doubled for no good reason.  This is exactly what this feels like.    By 2003 we all had egg on our faces and realized how really stupid we had been.  The NASDAQ had come down from near 5000 in Aug of 2000 to 1320 in Sept of 2002 and valuations were again reasonable.   And we got some progress forward from that point with rational exuberance.  What does interest me most is that doubling occurred the last time the Fed injected huge amounts of liquidity into the system, that time for the worry around computers and the date change from 99 to 00.   Then in late winter 2000 they started unwinding that trade and you saw the result.  Will that happen again this late winter or spring?   It sure feels possible.   TSLA at 250 again is a distinct possibility.",
