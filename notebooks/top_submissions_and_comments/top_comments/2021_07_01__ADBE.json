Two years is still a little short, investing needs longer time frames, five to ten years, and longer the better.\n\nIf you don't actually need that money in two years, I would buy around 15-30 growth and tech companies. Maybe throw like 5% across voo and vxus, then spread like 80% of my cash across positions in solid growth and tech names. Think shopify, Adobe, service now, kind of companies. Then I'd put  the remaining 15% into smaller scout positions in long shot companies. Like Spce, or apph, or clov. And I'd spread that around these high risk high reward companies. Remember even a small position can become big with compound interest. And besides you're 19. You can add to the positions later or just hold for decades and your small position will become a large one. You got tons of time on your side.\n\nI wouldn't touch bonds, you're too young for that drag on return. Even the etfs will be a drag on returns at your age, but they're good for diversification in case the market shits itself. Keep it all in equities, but no more than 15% in long shots. \n\nNow what would I do if I needed that money in two years? If you absolutely need that cash in two years, it can't be invested. Cause you need time for compound interest to do it's thing. And if you're gonna withdraw. You might withdraw after a bad market drawdown and you're boned. You need time to smooth out the market downturns. And you got time, dude. Buy and hold.",

I'm now just learning how to use GIMP (the open-sourced app, not the other one lol) and it's still taking quite some time to get used to. Photoshop was just easier to use cos it's what I've been taught and used for a loooong time.\n\nThough from a user perspective, I think the shift from having the option to buy a one-time purchase license to periodic subscription is pretty shit (I know you still can do it, but it's definitely harder to do now). From a financial perspective, I think Adobe knows what's up lol. It'll take a massive amount of capital and integrated education promotion to get people to use alternative software (think Chrome OS with students &amp; schools today vs Microsoft Windows as default elsewhere).",

        "body": "I think the current state of investing has to be considered here.  Social sentiment plays such a role in the conversation.  People answer Netfix because it is the \"sexier\" choice.  I think Netflix has a great runway, but you are right, Adobe is more diverse, which should matter.  In the long run I don't think either is a bad choice.  Due to all of this I think Netflix has more risk, but potentially more reward for being in your face all of the time.",

        "body": "Affinity photo for instance is pretty comparable to PS  and they have their own version of illustrator that they keep improving. But if we keep the conversation about OP's dilemma of why the market sees more runway for Netflix, the answer is in your comment and the few comments above. Professionals love it but the masses are ignorant of it. Think GARMIN, in the early 90s, only ver specialised people used their products but they quickly realised how soon their business model would plateau. They have now made a transition and made their main product accessible to the masses. If I were to rephrase OPs question, it would be which of these two companies is poised to make such a transition. Adobe or Netflix? Adobe products such as PS are not a consideration to the average point and shoot photographer and Netflix subscription price point is probably to high for people in emerging markets.",

        "body": "Here is my issue / concern with your results. That being said I don't personally care enough to look it up myself but if I was to do your test I would be interested in testing more to verify the results.\n\n1) it looks like you are assuming you should be using s&amp;p500 as your benchmark. As you have stated there seems to be a larger proportion of tech stocks in your list. This makes your assumption about good place to work meaningless unless you test against similar market breakdown. Others have suggested qqq and I would venture to say the outcomes could look fairly different if a more tech heavy benchmark was picked. Would be interested to see if this would hold up to qqq.\n\n2) it sounds like you got caught up in proving yourself right vs trying to objectively find your answer. Comments like \"no matter how you slice it\" (could be showing) a bias to prove to yourself and others that good culture is equivalent to good company, perhaps it was pure luck for you that Adobe was one of the picks.\n\n3) If you did decide s&amp;p500 needed to be used I would be interested in finding out if it still stood up with the removal of some or all of the tech stocks, perhaps a weighting similar to s&amp;p 500 if you want that as benchmark. As mentioned you didn't have all the data so companies were missing, that alone could have results in different results.\n\n4) I understand everyone is looking for an edge, let's be honest if this was so simple we would be seeing more ETF's built around this model, or simply companies or individuals already doing this. Perhaps this is my own assumptions creeping in, but I would say a meaningful edge long term over the market, is probably more complex then pick from forbs best companies.\n\nTakeaway seems to be you set out to prove something, intentional or not, could have come up with wrong conclusion just trying to justify your theory. I do also see a bonus for (click bait) or a catchy title. It is an interesting idea to look up, but I feel to find a true or accurate answer to your question, you would need to test more variables.",
