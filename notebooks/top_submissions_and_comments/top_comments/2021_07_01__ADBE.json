Two years is still a little short, investing needs longer time frames, five to ten years, and longer the better.\n\nIf you don't actually need that money in two years, I would buy around 15-30 growth and tech companies. Maybe throw like 5% across voo and vxus, then spread like 80% of my cash across positions in solid growth and tech names. Think shopify, Adobe, service now, kind of companies. Then I'd put  the remaining 15% into smaller scout positions in long shot companies. Like Spce, or apph, or clov. And I'd spread that around these high risk high reward companies. Remember even a small position can become big with compound interest. And besides you're 19. You can add to the positions later or just hold for decades and your small position will become a large one. You got tons of time on your side.\n\nI wouldn't touch bonds, you're too young for that drag on return. Even the etfs will be a drag on returns at your age, but they're good for diversification in case the market shits itself. Keep it all in equities, but no more than 15% in long shots. \n\nNow what would I do if I needed that money in two years? If you absolutely need that cash in two years, it can't be invested. Cause you need time for compound interest to do it's thing. And if you're gonna withdraw. You might withdraw after a bad market drawdown and you're boned. You need time to smooth out the market downturns. And you got time, dude. Buy and hold.",

We've seen how Netflix changed the game when they had a broader access to IPs/contents from other studios/companies back in the day. Now we've also seen how Netflix got fucked raw by the other studios/companies developing their own streaming platforms.\n\nI think Disney is in a great position since their acquisitions, but yeah we'll have to see if any of the studios/companies can constantly pump out great new contents in the future.\n\nWith Adobe products you might have to retrain yourself and get used to new products, which might just be the tallest wall to climb over if you want to not depend on Adobe. I'm now just learning how to use GIMP (the open-sourced app, not the other one lol) and it's still taking quite some time to get used to. Photoshop was just easier to use cos it's what I've been taught and used for a loooong time.\n\nThough from a user perspective, I think the shift from having the option to buy a one-time purchase license to periodic subscription is pretty shit (I know you still can do it, but it's definitely harder to do now). From a financial perspective, I think Adobe knows what's up lol. It'll take a massive amount of capital and integrated education promotion to get people to use alternative software (think Chrome OS with students &amp; schools today vs Microsoft Windows as default elsewhere).",

Think GARMIN, in the early 90s, only ver specialised people used their products but they quickly realised how soon their business model would plateau. They have now made a transition and made their main product accessible to the masses. If I were to rephrase OPs question, it would be which of these two companies is poised to make such a transition. Adobe or Netflix? Adobe products such as PS are not a consideration to the average point and shoot photographer and Netflix subscription price point is probably to high for people in emerging markets.",

Revenue might even be larger than 50% growth in 2022 and 2023 because AMD has been held back by the chip shortage... TSCM and Samsung are building huge chip fabs here in US, AMD will be a top customer of both. The product pipeline of AMD is insanely strong.

        "body": "Just fyi MU's products, DRAM, NAND are commodity products. Commodity anything are cyclical as they ramp up production when the expectation is that the economy will grow. This then leads to overproduction and ultimately low prices due to supply and demand. Take a look at the MU chart the past decade (or even longer) to get an idea of this. Granted, the memory industry is now an oligopoly, and some would argue we are in a multi-year up-cycle due to technological advances, so the cycles may be much more contained. \n\nI would advise looking more into the companies you listed. The fact that you list these stocks together kind of hints to me that you don't really understand them other than that they are in the semiconductor industry. I see many posts suggesting a stock because of how great their quarter and guidance are, but please remember the market is forward looking; chances are that great guidance is already priced in. \n\nIn regards to your MU, TSM comment, just realize that there's probably a reason they are lower valued. My two cents for why they aren't trading at multiples like the others are: MU - commodity products as I mentioned in the first paragraph. As such, you can't expect them to trade at a growth premium like AMD since they don't control their price. DRAM by Micron is not better than DRAM by Samsung. People pick which to buy based on price. TSM - may be accounting for the political risk of China invading Taiwan. TSM is also an independent, pure-play foundry. Their entire capacity is already being utilized so you could say their growth is capped and already priced in. For them to grow more, they would have to increase capex and build more foundries. This takes months/years to complete.\n\nTL;DR: Not saying MU, TSM can't rise more, but not for the argument you mentioned.\n\nGood luck!",

Besides that I would recommend being long in something you know a lot about that you think is a game changer in 5-10 yrs. Tilt your portfolio towards that a bit &amp; don't worry about the drops as long as you still believe. \n\nI say this as someone who gave up on amd at under $4, Nvidia at $50, amzn $100, and the list goes on and on..\n\nI believe there is a famous saying that people lose more money preparing for the black Swan than in the black Swan.",

Plus, INTC is planning to diversify into being more of a company-independent fab company (arguably similar to TSMC, just behind currently on manufacturing advances like 7nm and below).  If tariffs on China start going back up, it will have a more highly-protected competitive moat.  And, think about the possible huge revenue gains in future, with pent-up demand from semi shortages.
