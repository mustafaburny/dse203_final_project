        "body": "The sectors that Corsair competes in and gets the vast majority of its revenue from are low-margin, commoditised products like memory and PSUs where everyone just rebrands Micron/Samsung/Superflower products. The only small advantage they have here is the brand, sustained by massive marketing spend. All of the acquisitions they've done are tiny and don't shift the needle on the bottom line. Elgato is probably the best business they have but that's tiny.  \nLook through the financial statements going through history, and you'll notice that historic gross margins have stayed around 20%,and net income margins float around 0%. In 2020, net income margins were 6.1%. All of that increase (and more) can be attributed to the  700bp increase in gross margin. They have no operating leverage whatsoever.   \nThe key to this investment is whether that increase sticks around - not the PE firm, or meme potential, or growth of the wider gaming industry. If all of those go right, but gross margins go back to historic means, CRSR WILL NOT PRINT FCF.  \nMy view of the gaming market is that the past year has been a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for component makers like CRSR. The demand was so high that they could gouge prices and increase margins, but that's not going to stick around forever. I haven't seen a compelling argument for gross margins continuing to stay where they are.  \nArguments like Elgato having higher margins, or debt all being paid off in the future simply don't have big enough impacts to alter the fact that gross margin is the linchpin.",

Their flagship cpus are THE BEST for workstations. Point blank. No comparisson. Their multi core cpu like the 5950x is actually as good as intels i910900k processor for gaming if not just a cunt hair better...plus it blows intel out of the water for multicore uses but at 2x the price. I used intels 10900k in my gaming build as it is neck and neck for the best cpu for gaming for half the cost. I have no use for the amd 5950x because i dont do content creation or stream.

In my post I even talked about how they sync their product with SAP platform to even further automate the financial reporting process.  Hell my company abandoned Blackline all together for Workiva cause it offers more.\n\nYou can cherrypick anything in an argument to try and make me sound dumb or misinformed but if you read my post you'll see what i'm talking about.

These guys are super smart and worth every penny. Made soooo much money off then over the years. Their Equity Oracle service is nice too.",

        "body": "The reason it hasn't been done before is because nobody thought it up/implemented it.  Or else it required the level of digital connectivity we only recently achieved to be realistic.  Or required too much effort from developers to get involved that it wasn't worth it.  In any case, that's a whole other discussion.  \n\nBut I find \"if it's such a good idea why hasn't someone thought of it?\" to be a weak argument -- it's true of just about every big thing before it becomes such.  Things catch on when they do because they do, often for a variety of connected reasons born of circumstance and chance.  It's enough to be a good idea, it doesn't have to be completely new -- execution matters.\n\nI think the NFT thing is just a piece of the puzzle.  Easier to plug into than a proprietary Oracle DB or whatever.  It exists on its own and you just have to use it, not design/build/maintain it since it does that on its own.  In and of itself that's a huge benefit.  Not so much \"necessary\" as an obvious, effective solution to a problem of the business model -- namely, \"how do we keep track of who owns what, and with which type of ownership status?\"  But I'll admit I'm going beyond my depth in getting into the details -- I have to stop at being able to see how it could work, and can't walk through an airtight case that it would.\n\nAnyway, Gamestop would add value as a gatekeeper/broker/middleman.  Business model as old as time.  Users go to Gamestop as the entry point to their gaming lives -- managing hardware/content.  Developers go to Gamestop to manage distribution.  Just because both parties *can* do it another way doesn't mean a central broker that makes things easier won't have value.  If the goal is for Gamestop to be the facilitator of all manner of gaming-related transactions (and they pull it off), that's an incredibly valuable position to be in.\n\nListen, I'm not saying it's a slam dunk by any means.  Just that I can see the path forward and how it might work out, in particular how going in some of these new directions could be lucrative.  Gaming is huge, and the infrastructure around it will need to evolve with the times.  Anyone who is successful at getting a piece of that pie will do very, very well.",
