The position was not large.\n* Decided part of my portfolio to be \"fire and forget\" (it's 70% MSCI World, 30% EM ETFs). They will just live their own life and grow with the world for the next decades. (It involved a bit of reshuffling that account, but worth it).\n* My broker app supports alarms, so for each of the remaining positions I decided what my plan was and then I set corresponding alarms. Some stocks I will keep forever, some I will sell if their price leave an interval, some I will buy more of if the price is below a point (but never sell) or sell (but never re-purchase).\n* So now I wait for my phone to alert me rather than checking constantly.\n* I do a weekly check of my regime - plan to shift to monthly.\n\nMy returns are better (!) and I can focus on day2day and get more money into the system.\n\nAll the best.",

Would be nice if allowed to make its own thread.   \n\\~  \nYou see, what WSB started is actually a good thing.\n\nFor too long, the 1% have inflicted grave injustice after grave injustice on the common people. They have manipulated and stolen money from the economic ecosystem of nations and socieities, under the shroud of \"its lawful however\". I ask you this: Jim Crow Laws were 'lawful', but were they *right?* Separate law from rightful justice, and suddenly you find that there is a gap that has been steadily abused.\n\nBut now in the 21st century -  *this is payback* of the general populace vs the 1%. Think about it.\n\nIn Britain, hedge funds *profited* from the Brexit vote. On Black Wednesday 1992, [scumbag George Soros massively shorted on the British currency](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/08/george-soros-bank-of-england.asp) to make a tidy sum on a national disaster.\n\n2008. Credit swap junk blah blah etcs brought the world economy to its knees because bankers and traders massively lied to each other about the quality of their assets and credit lines. They did'nt suffer. The rest of the population did. Jobs went, prospects went, people were foreclosed and made homeless. Since 2008 the Western economy has staggered, but never really rip-roared for its citizens benefit. But oh, the NASDQ is up. Wall Street pointers are up. And so forth. And these indicators are what politicians and the 1% have told us means that actually everything is alright and the economy is fine.\n\nIs it? Is it really? I fail to see where somewhere has to work two to three dead end jobs to barely pay rent and still be impoverished can be classed as 'all right'.\n\nAnd yet for so long, the wealth in stocks, fixtures, securities etc has been kept away from the man and woman on the street. You needed to have a business degree. You needed to go through a broker. You had to be a trader in a job. You needed to go through so many loops and holes to be able to invest, so it seemed.\n\nThen the digital age happened. Suddenly you or I could invest via online apps with no need for a broker, or time delay. You can monitor stocks for new leads or in an emergency crash, pull out and minimise the damage on your smartphone. You're somewhere, say out with a friend at a meal?\"Can you give me five minutes please?\" you can ask.Check the stock. See the crash news. Portflio activate. Sell all. Authorise sell all. See the returns back into your wallet. Your money now safe even if your profits took a hit. And then you can relax and go back to your meal, and the attention to your friend.\n\nAnd then it got better.\n\n\"4Chan with a Bloomberg terminal.\" Remember how [4Chan turned into a multi-human quantum computer, its contributors the processors and information gatherers](https://www.vice.com/en/article/d7eddj/4chan-does-first-good-thing-pulls-off-the-heist-of-the-century1) to play and defeat Shi LeBouef no less than six times at \"Capture the Flag\"? They would find the video and then call on expertise diverse and arrayed throughout the active userbase. [Flight con trails, star patterns and other niche areas of expertise were called up and used to determine where the damn flag was.](https://www.rt.com/viral/380338-4chan-capture-anti-trump-flag/)\n\nNow see that \"human quantum computing\" pooled in a more civilised forum - Reddit. Then see it aimed at something else arcane and obscure to the normal working class person. Perhaps something like...*wealthy Wall Street stock market tradings.*\n\nPeople have had enough. First of all, again, knowledge and expertise on trades, stocks etc is shared. It is free. You no longer have to pay a broker. Secondly, other users can provide the DD - the intel on stocks and businesses. See how Gamestop actually has a potentially good future case, with the rise of Ryan Cohen.\n\nAnd yet Wall Street is now crying to legislators. They're only **crying because they're losing for a change. Enough is enough.**\n\nOnwards and upwards.",

For 20 years it\u2019s been intel in the datacenter, colocation, servers etc it was 99.9% Intel \n\nIt\u2019s now about 90% intel and that\u2019s a huge drop as the server market doesn\u2019t change cpu brands like ever.  \n\nIn the consumer space AMD has properly smashed intel in the DIY market, in some OEM markets etc, Steam and some gaming sites have a decent polll and AMD has advanced far faster than most think.\n\nArm, what apple has done with the chips is amazing.  My iPad Pro will edit videos faster than my intel desktop, is definitely smaller more portable, more efficient, does not require a fan.  Apple blew every one away with the M1, I\u2019m not sure how good the arm x86 emulator will be these chips are blazing fast.  The a14x or m1 is nearly on par with the i9 i7 now so it\u2019s going be leapfrogging intel this year or next by some margin",

With that catalyst they get an acute 1-2 day squeeze (like VW in 2008).\n\nI don't think the catalyst scenario will happen until the summer at the earliest, but I think the unwinding will probably start in the next few weeks.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy personal position in GME is currently at 1685 shares (cost basis around 19), 16C 4/16 all in IRA or Roth so I am not worried about taxes on short term gains.

I feel comfortable that even after the squeeze it will be worth $50+ but expect there is a short term win that I can claim before then.",

If you need any more convincing, go look at the list of their platinum sponsors for next weeks #ConvergeConnect21 conference.. You might recognize some of the companies: IBM, Redhat, Google Cloud, Microsoft, Dell, VMware, AWS, PureStorage, Cisco, and Snowflake. Lenovo and PaloAlto are two of the gold sponsors. Hewlett-Packard and Intel are two of the silver sponsors. This is a Constellation Software-like company in the making- MASSIVE.

Intel's 14nm is closer to a 10nm from TSMC and Samsung, and the 10nm is expected to be closer to a 7nm process.  Intel's 7nm corresponds well with a 5nm TSMC/Samsung process.\n\nIntel's 10nm is slated to come out later this year, with a slow trickle.  This puts them about 1.5 generations behind Samsung and TSMC.  In spite of this, Intel's processors are still competitive with AMD's, if just barely behind and slightly costlier (though prices for Intel are dropping and AMD are rising).\n\nI think this means overall that Intel has either a better design or manufacturing process that if they can push their node process to improve at a heightened pace could have them dominating the performance-to-price market in 2-5 years again.  Intel definitely has the cash on hand to invest in this, but they made many missteps on their push to get the 10nm and 7nm chips ready, so I'm not hopeful that Intel can pull this off, regardless of who heads the company.",

Intel has reserved 3nm with TSM. The real question is how much.\n\nOther than that, AMD will lose market share in desktop, because Intel is actually going to try now. AMD will gain in laptops and datacenter, which will more than make up for the losses in desktop. The second half of 2021 will see AMD profits rising massively.",

He is a globalist, but that doesn\u2019t make him a China sympathizer. \n\n\n\n\nThe Trump admin. kept the Uyghurs out of their mouth because they were deeply islamaphobic, this is a last ditch effort to be on the right side of history when the people of the world finally see the atrocities with their own eyes. The Trump admin resentment for China had nothing to do with this genocide, otherwise they would have played this card before. In fact they decided not to sign on to a UN letter, signed by basically every western democracy, condemning the camps and detentions because they were in the midst of climbing their way out of a bungled trade war. Multiple sources even reported that Trump was essentially supportive of Xi\u2019s \u201cre-education\u201d approach. \n\n\n\nThe Uyghur story is so massive and for now just lurks behind the scenes, but Trump and his advisors have classified intel and they know how bad it is. It will come to light and that will be a flashpoint for our relationship with China. And when it happens, we\u2019ll look back and say it was **Trump** who was the first to \u201ctake action\u201d, despite the fact that he\u2019s signing off on this with one foot out the door and no real plan of action.

Dell, HP, Lenovo etc., all still go to Intel for most of their chips. Ryzen is a great CPU, but the narrative is being driven by gamers and YouTubers along with benchmarks - most x86 OEMs don't care about those. They care about volume, reliable sourcing and brand, none of which AMD provide.\n\nNow as for missing out of new markets, well those markets are not using x86 at all, they're leveraging ARM. So herein lies an important question - who is more likely to transition successfully to ARM, Intel or AMD? \n\nAMD have just finally overtaken Intel in performance for an architecture that's rapidly dying. That's no victory at all.",

        "body": " \n\nSo for the past year or so I\u2019ve become more knowledgeable and invested in the stock market. Through reading and watching YouTube videos online, I\u2019ve taught myself technical analysis and the ability to distinguish well-run companies from bad ones. One company in particular that I\u2019ve been following has been AMD.\n\nAMD is a company that is close to my heart and many of you as well because we use their products. Whether you\u2019re PC Master Race or a console player, AMD has had a significant impact on your gaming life. With the release of their new Ryzen Zen 3 CPUs and 6 series graphics cards, they have completely turned the Computer &amp; Graphics industry on its head and are siphoning a growing percentage of market share from industry leaders such as Intel and Nvidia.\n\nThis became very evident when they announced their Q4 earnings report this past Tuesday. To put it simply, they CRUSHED IT. AMD\u2019s revenue was up 45% in 2020, led by the growth of the companies server CPU and game console CPU segments which increased by 176% year over year.\n\nOn the earnings call, AMD\u2019s CEO, Lisa Su, gave great guidance and announced AMD expects 37% revenue growth in 2021 despite supply issue concerns due to the pandemic.\n\nSo why am I writing all of this? Since AMD announced its earnings on Tuesday, the stock has plummeted almost 10 percent due to market manipulation. It\u2019s no secret that large hedge funds are trying to cover the losses they\u2019ve endured in stocks like $GME and $AMC by shorting well-performing stocks that retail investors are heavily invested in. And yesterday Robinhood facilitated this transfer of wealth by preventing retail investors from buying more than one share of $AMD at a time.\n\nHerein lies the problem. We are told in this country to pick ourselves up by our own bootstraps. To put in the effort and the work and you\u2019ll be rewarded. But the events of the past week have made it evidently clear that the \u201cAmerican Dream\u201d only applies to a select segment of the population. Because whenever the working class beats the rich at their own rules, they immediately change the rules to punish us. It\u2019s honestly sickening.\n\nSo what can we do to combat this? Essentially, what the large hedge funds are doing right now is a high stakes game of rob Peter to pay Paul. They have lost billions in $GME and $AMC so now they are attacking (shorting) larger market cap stocks to make up the difference. WE CANNOT ALLOW THEM TO DO THIS. If we do not fight back, we will allow them to continue the status quo of changing the rules for their benefit.\n\nI am not a financial advisor, but we need to do what we can to protect companies such as $AMD and any of the other companies Robinhood has targeted over the past couple of days. If we\u2019re able to beat these hedge funds at their own games, maybe our government can finally intervene, which could lead to policy reform/regulation that supports the retail investor. Maybe I\u2019m being overly optimistic, but who knows. I think we really have a revolution on our hands here if this becomes a full fledged grassroots movement.",

Traders who traded out of their BTC and ETH positions for shitcoins in the last bubble got burned badly.  I don't think people will fall for it to the same extent as they did last time.\n\nThe market clearly values the network effects and liquidity of BTC and ETH over the high throughput, low fees, and \"better tech\" shitcoin narratives.",

        "body": "Bitcoin supply and demand factors:\n\nBitcoin\u2019s supply is famously limited, with only 900 per day being created currently. Compare this to a trade volume around 3,000,000 daily. Unlike most commodities, an increased price does not lead to increased supply, so your Econ 101 supply curve is flat.\n\nThe recent bull run has instead been driven by increased demand, with four primary factors:\n\n* Institutional demand is the biggest story. When 150+ year old insurance company MassMutual buys in with a cool $250m, you know institutional acceptance is finally happening. Institutions hold just 15% of all Bitcoin and we should expect to see that increase dramatically this year.\n* New retail exposure. New demographics of retail buyers now have crypto exposure through easy, established channels like PayPal and Cashapp.\n* Payments use case. PornHub going crypto-only is a big deal IMO. Many people globally don\u2019t have credit cards and cryptocurrency holds the promise of actually increasing the reach of ecommerce. The internet revolutionized content delivery but has always been missing the same level of revolution in payments to complete the cycle. Porn has always been an innovation leader on the Internet, and if the PornHub experiment is successful, it could open the door for others.\n* Gold replacement. Investment banks have issued statements saying their clients are shifting their gold allocation to Bitcoin. Also, a survey of Millenials found that they prefer Bitcoin to gold. As fiat currencies devalue globally, Bitcoin gains.\n\nWe are just getting started and this bull run has a long way to go. I\u2019ve been in crypto professionally since 2013 and IMO we are nowhere close to the next top.",

I would just be a lot more picky of your sectors. You have way, wayyy too many tickers, which I'm sure you have realized. Just choose your top 3-5 secular growth sectors, play top 2 per sector and don't over diversify.",

It has been like arguing with a brick wall trying to talk with them. Now that the market is rallying, we can do our victory lap. Bears need to be put into hibernation until it crashes again.\n\nAs for bitcoin becoming a currency, I would not rule it out. Paypal adoption is moving in the right direction. Ultimately, I don't care. I'm happy to use it as digital gold.",
