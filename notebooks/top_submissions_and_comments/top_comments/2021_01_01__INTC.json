The position was not large.\n* Decided part of my portfolio to be \"fire and forget\" (it's 70% MSCI World, 30% EM ETFs). They will just live their own life and grow with the world for the next decades. (It involved a bit of reshuffling that account, but worth it).\n* My broker app supports alarms, so for each of the remaining positions I decided what my plan was and then I set corresponding alarms. Some stocks I will keep forever, some I will sell if their price leave an interval, some I will buy more of if the price is below a point (but never sell) or sell (but never re-purchase).\n* So now I wait for my phone to alert me rather than checking constantly.\n* I do a weekly check of my regime - plan to shift to monthly.\n\nMy returns are better (!) and I can focus on day2day and get more money into the system.\n\nAll the best.",

It\u2019s uplisting to the TSE is set for February 17th and I would recommend hopping onboard this choo choo train before it hits double digits. Institutional ownership sits at a mere 3.8%. Insiders have bought ~950K shares in the past 12 months and own ~12.3%. They haven\u2019t sold a single share and the biggest holder is the CEO at 8.13%. The company has made something like 17 acquisitions in North America since October 2017 and have plans to expand into Europe in the future. If you need any more convincing, go look at the list of their platinum sponsors for next weeks #ConvergeConnect21 conference.. You might recognize some of the companies: IBM, Redhat, Google Cloud, Microsoft, Dell, VMware, AWS, PureStorage, Cisco, and Snowflake. Lenovo and PaloAlto are two of the gold sponsors. Hewlett-Packard and Intel are two of the silver sponsors. This is a Constellation Software-like company in the making- MASSIVE. Their latest bought financing closed today fully subscribed for a mere 80+ million dollars. Guess what they plan to do with it that money- M&amp;A. Did I forget to mention that they are very likely to break a billion in revenue this year? Oh yeah and they\u2019re still on the venture exchange! \n\nTLDR: CTS.V - strong buy before Q4 earnings (don\u2019t know when they are), or at least before uplisting to TSE in mid Feb. Thank you.",

There\u2019s a good reason Facebook took out multiple full page ads trying to attack apple over it.\n\nAnd that leads into Apples other area they are owning. Privacy. Google and Facebook are the opposite and Apple are giving people exactly what they want. Protecting your data, alerting you when someone wants to take your data. They\u2019ve taken the users side in the data war, that is only going to add to their business in the coming years as it hurts google and Facebook.",

They outsource it.\n\nSamsung is currently producing 5nm, and I think TSMC is too, but their entire inventory appears to be contracted to Apple right now.\n\nIt's also not an apples-to-apples comparison from fab to fab.  Intel's 14nm is closer to a 10nm from TSMC and Samsung, and the 10nm is expected to be closer to a 7nm process.  Intel's 7nm corresponds well with a 5nm TSMC/Samsung process.\n\nIntel's 10nm is slated to come out later this year, with a slow trickle.  This puts them about 1.5 generations behind Samsung and TSMC.  In spite of this, Intel's processors are still competitive with AMD's, if just barely behind and slightly costlier (though prices for Intel are dropping and AMD are rising).\n\nI think this means overall that Intel has either a better design or manufacturing process that if they can push their node process to improve at a heightened pace could have them dominating the performance-to-price market in 2-5 years again.  Intel definitely has the cash on hand to invest in this, but they made many missteps on their push to get the 10nm and 7nm chips ready, so I'm not hopeful that Intel can pull this off, regardless of who heads the company.",

And don\u2019t just limit your search to major processor suppliers.\n\nWould also look into companies that supply all of the peripheral chips for auto and consumer electronics (think TXN, ADI). Your average BOM includes 1 main processor, and many, many peripheral chips.. Peripheral chips are typically cheaper, less competitive, built on more stable processing nodes, and have high margins.\n\nOne other company of interest related to semiconductors is TER. Wide moat tester supplier for just about every one of these chip makers. The need for comprehensive test solutions is growing (arguably) faster than the semiconductor market itself, especially as INTC and AAPL are reaching their 5-7nm process nodes. \n\n- An engineer in the semiconductor industry",
