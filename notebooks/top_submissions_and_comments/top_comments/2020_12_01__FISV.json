Bought more at 0.66, which I thought was too late but I'm over 100% gains now.  Now I'm just holding long and laughing as great deals keep getting announced and moving the price higher.  \n\nJust pay attention.. the things talked about today like FLT and PNG will take off eventually.  Be patient, and realize that it's gambling.  Buy a bunch of a cheap penny stock and hope it takes off.  Sometimes they do, sometimes they don't.  If you want safe returns, don't play around with penny stocks.  \n\nMIR might go big, they're making a new class of pain killer that could disrupt the opiod industry.  Super cheap, might be worth a ton, but I've parked my money in there (and lost a bunch at this point) in the hopes their Phase 3 trials go great and this thing goes up 1000% in a year or two.",
