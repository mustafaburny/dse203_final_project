NIO, while being a great company with a lot of growth potential, lives on government subsidy and tax allowance.\n\nConsequently, Baba and Ant are regulated and punished by the CCP and therefore their value is lowered due to the risk. NIO is growing well because their development is aligned well with the vision of the Chinese government.\n\nWestern media may be mostly critical of the Chinese government but the hedge funds are very honest with their money.",

Trust me, they spend an absolutely crazy amount of money and effort to track down and shutdown fraudulent stores. They use both automation and manual reviews of accounts, and have some very impressive detection technology in place. They also restrict all sorts of high risk type stores from their gateway outright.\n\nThey operate their own payment gateway, and both Visa and Mastercard hold heavy obligations to gateway owners when it comes to preventing fraud. Shopify has one of the more sophisticated programs Ive ever seen in my career in SAAS.\n\nThe main issue with that type of fraud prevention, is that its always inevitable that fraudsters will start recognizing the approach Shopify uses to detect them, and then they change their patterns. This results generally in a wave of fraudulent stores getting through until reported. Its really an endless game of cat and mouse, and theres some very big companies around the world that constantly open stores and attempt to get around the preventative measures. \n\nTo say that scams don't violate their T&amp;C and that Shopify doesnt care is just downright ridiculous. In the end of the day Shopify ends up eating the costs of the chargebacks when visa and mastercard come calling. Its not only 100% in their best interest to combat fraudulent stores, but they are fully obligated to by owning a payment gateway.",

I don\u2019t even think that\u2019s a word. After she scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly",
