Since I knew I was wanting to take a big risk, I thought it was wise to invest in a miner since there would be a higher likelihood of success rather than betting on one major EV player. I thought this approach would be similar to those who made a fortunate selling mining picks during the gold rush rather than taking the chance to mine themselves. \n\n(3) I then began to look at different countries and realized quickly that Australia is a leader when it comes to minerals so it seemed like a no brainer to me.\n\n(4) I then looked at the different opportunities in Australia and started filtering down by key factors such as management, current grades, director\u2019s confidence, etc. to ultimately decide on LTR",

Every single article is about how he tweeted at papa Musk and how he thinks that the company is the worst thing since he dropped his glass eye into his cat's litter box.\n\nHe doesn't think that Tesla will implode. He doesn't think it's a failing company. He just sees the reality, which is that all of their profits/revenues are way in the future.\n\nLet's just say you win a time-delayed lottery and get $1,000,000 in 15 years. Not bad! Now let's say you won the same lottery in Venezuela in 2005. It's not even worth cashing the ticket.\n\nIt's the same deal with companies. Growth companies, however promising, have most of their expected profits in the future. Those profits have to be discounted by the **interest rate** to be turned into todays dollars. In other words, it doesn't matter how much money Tesla is going to make in the future if interest rates surge today. Well... it does matter... it's just worth a lot less.\n\nSo how does this relate to the Burry bet? You just have to scroll down a few lines on his 13F filing.\n\nBurry has almost as many GOOG/FB calls as he does TSLA puts. Around \\~$330MM of them. Why does this matter? These are big tech companies that are actually printing out metric shit-tons of profit today.\n\nInterest rates stay the same but big tech goes up? Break even. Big tech goes down? Break even. Interest rates rise? Burry makes more money in a year than all of your wives boyfriends combined.\n\nTL;DR:\n\nThe Burry TSLA short isn't a bet against Tesla, it's a bet on interest rates rising (AKA inflation).",

Luckily, I had an emergency fund to cover my bills or I would be colossally FUCKED.  $15-20k in cash is not going to make you rich invested over decades. Why risk it? It\u2019s worth more if it\u2019s kept close to insulate you in case of unforeseen circumstances. It simply doesn\u2019t make sense not to. \n\nFidelity, Vanguard, &amp; TD all offer their own (as well as assess to) any and all small return/low risk ishares type shit to park good money in. They\u2019re a great option to have as far as \u201csafe\u201d plays that will mostly keep pace with the markets and still not over leverage you as far as risk. \n\nThe well-established individual stocks will always be a good play so long as you don\u2019t get caught up in every little detail of day-to-day pricing.

Then I launched my own consulting company - quickly figured out that services work doesn't scale well - pivoted the business to a product startup and used the consulting to finance it.  All told, it took 20 years to get a really big exit - like net of over $200M.  \nThere is no shortcut that I know of - education, skills, experience,  lots of hard work for years and then luck.\nNow I get to do whatever I like, I am typing this from a private jet on the wifi coming back from vacation... I know, wtf. I pinch myself too.\n\n\n2) How can I invest like you?\n\nWell. I have a lot of money so I can make risky bets.  I don't do options though, only stocks. I put $50k into GME on a whim at $65 and sold when it hit $350.  That was a laugh.  \n\nBut seriously, I invest in stocks that I feel like I know. I use HUBS - they are in a great space and really appealing to SMB. I see them as the most viable competitor to Salesforce - go look at Salesforce's market cap. Classic Clayton Christensen - you will be eaten from below.\n\nI am not really much of an investor - just see things that make sense. I bought Amazon at $350 - should have put in more...\n\nI typically invest in tech stocks because I feel like I understand the business.\n\nMy stock account is just my plaything. My real investing is much more structured and done with my wealth advisor at a large brokerage.",

It can take multiple generations for people to even save up enough for a down payment. The cost of real estate is astronomical, and it's only been going up and up for many many years. Hence why people invest in it.\n\nBut the problem is that there are huge numbers of residences that have been purchased as investment properties, and they are vacant. Huge swaths of unfinished apartment buildings have been demolished because the construction wasn't finished.\n\nI wouldn't consider this similar to Lehman Brothers going under.

The name is Auto Callable Yield Note, the way we write these is that you set a time period normally 2-5 years they are linked to normally 2-3 indexed or individual stocks. They come with a fixed rate that is based on how the VIX is doing, the higher the VIX the higher the yield. Then you have a downside barrier that is normally 30-40%, if any of the indexed go below that barrier on coupon payment date you miss coupon. If it makes it to the very end of the term and it's below that barrier you have principal loss.\n\nTo summarize there are 3 major risks:\n1. The bank goes bankrupt and you are a creditor and hope you make the list of payees.\n2. It goes below the barrier in the middle of term and you miss 1 month) quarters worth of coupon payment.\n3. You go full term and it's below the barrier st the end of the term and you participate in principal loss. \n\nI currently hold a note that looks like this:\n\nIndex's: SPY INDU and DAL\nTerm: 4 years\nCoupon barrier 20%\nPrincipal barrier 30%\nRate: 13.65% yearly",
