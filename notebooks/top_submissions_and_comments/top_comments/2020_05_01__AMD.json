They took a beating and am expecting a bounce back from the 132-133 level. I'll be going short term calls tomorrow for a quick scalp at open.\n\nPTON Calls: Same as above \\^ bounce back from the $40-41 level\n\nDKNG: FOMO if you want. This thing could pop to $40 or drop to $30. I won't be touching this until at least another week or so. Risky af but mad tendiez if you guess the right direction (calls/puts)\n\nCOTY: Same as above, but I expect this will hold better than DKNG since its already near rock bottom prices. Might throw a few thousand at it tomorrow in calls.\n\nSPY: i personally don't play SPY, but there is mad tendiez to be made if you get in calls at a dip (around the 295-297 range) or puts (around the 301-303 range).\n\nCCL, RCL, NCLH: Easy plays to go long on a dip, Beaten up cruise stocks that have been forming new bottoms. Easy 2x 3x bagger if you get in before a large move up in the premarket. They seem a bit overheated lately though so I would be careful of a pullback soon, in which case go short term puts.\n\nAAL, DAL, UAL, LUV, SAVE: Same as above\n\nAAPL, MSFT, AMD, NVDA: Tech saw a big hit today, might be a good spot to buy the dip. I'll be watching closely tomorrow if we continue to fall in tech at open, then I'm buying the dip for sure.\n\nBABA, TSM: GYNA stocks if you want i guess\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGood luck making your parents money back you fucking autist.",

OK I did that, I did crypto, OK now I own Tesla, I get it. But there has to be more to investing than just Tesla.\u201d*\n\n**No, all there is to investing is owning Tesla, in call form specifically. Mr Camillo clearly has not read that many posts here.**\n\n*\"The fingerprints of tiny investors are all over the options market. Trades consisting of just one contract now account for 13% of total volume, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. analysts led by John Marshall. That supports a view that \u201cindividual investor active trading is playing an increased role in market volatility.\u201d In some popular stocks, like Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc. and Alphabet Inc., small options trades account for nearly a third of total volume.\"*\n\n**CMG options? Really? Not AMD? Or DIS? Or MSFT? Or TSLA? Or MRNA? Chipotle???**\n\n*That\u2019s been true for Ameer Umarov, a cab driver in Arizona with an interest in math and a passion for video games. Months ago, when he realized the coronavirus was growing into a global health crisis, he reactivated his Amazon.com account to make some purchases. Not for masks or hand sanitizer -- for books on stock trading. Two a week, at one point.*\n\n*When equities started surging in late March, Umarov stayed away, scared by the volatility. He was ready to act by the first week of April. He bought shares of Boeing Co., a bad decision that set him back more than $4,000. But a stake in Halliburton Co. brought him $9,800, after he sold shares on the day of a 16% rally late last month. A few other purchases -- Goldman Sachs and Micron Technology Inc., among them -- yielded mixed results. All told, Umarov is down some $400 since he began.*\n\n**Definitely more losses than that.**\n\n*\u201cIt\u2019s a gamble, but a highly intellectual gamble,\u201d he said by phone. \u201cIt\u2019s about knowledge and risk, but especially for guys like me, it\u2019s all about sheer luck.\u201d*\n\n**He gets it.**\n\n*This month, he stopped buying books and instead signed up for a virtual trading boot-camp. He paid $4,100 for two days of 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. classes, where he learned about concepts like support, resistance, and trading on gaps. To Umarov, the course is a long-term investment, and he\u2019s decided eventually he wants to make trading his full-time job.*\n\n**I really hope that's not code for True Trading Group.**\n\n*\u201cI have no idea how it\u2019s going to go,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it will be stupid not to try.\u201d*\n\n**Sums up this sub entirely.**\n\n**BTW, Ameer, you should reveal yourself. I assume you are reading this.**",

        "body": "You have to really study the company and the industry. Probably impossible to do so with a bunch of companies and industries at the same time so my advice is to pick a few industries and just lock in on those. \n\nI\u2019ve caught a few. I had Best Buy in 2014, AMD in 2016, Geron in 2015, Valeant in 2017, Apple in 2018, and was ahead of the runup for all of them. But it was months and months of research to where I knew the stock was coming before the public did.\n\nOnce you have industry and company specific knowledge you learn to read between the lines. For example, the presentations Geron releases data in are the same time every year, so naturally if they have big data and that event is 2 months away, you can infer big data is coming out, even if they haven\u2019t announced such yet. And I studied the tech industry to know that AMD was likely to capture significant market share before those earnings ever happened. Etc etc\n\nSo yes it is possible but the important point is you can\u2019t be everywhere at once. I pick a focus area and ignore 100% of noise outside those areas. Any high-growth company outside my research area is automatically eliminated, no matter how good it sounds.\n\nUsually that means my high-growth portfolio is only 1-3 stocks at any given time. I don\u2019t diversify at all. If you look at my list of successes, it\u2019s not a coincidence I only got one per year. Because it took up to a year of digging just to find each one.\n\nThis post ended up way longer than I planned. Sorry lol",

        "body": "I can give the perspective from a tech/software dev.\n\nIn my opinion, these are sort of different players. In fact, I would say that NVDA and AMD are far more analogous to each other than even AMD -&gt; AAPL, and certainly to MSFT. The  way that I see it, NVDA/AMD are fundamentally companies that are concerned with producing a *physical good* \\- literal chipsets and dies. AAPL seems to waver on the hardware side of things (they have been known to go proprietary in that arena, but have also loaned out work to INTC on more than one occasion). I most certainly see MSFT as a true software/PaaS/SaaS company - suffice to say that they are producing very little in the way of physical goods.\n\nI think the *soft/hardware* direction is important to mention, because that fundamentally plays into the way that these companies deal in the market. Developing hardware is a mind-bendingly expensive process (relatively speaking). It takes years of R&amp;D and cash on hand to fund something that is truly great. An example of this would be the move AMD made to Zen (which is based on the concept of 'chiplets'; highly-scalable many-core designs that are fundamentally different from their monolithic predecessors).\n\nIn terms of growth, I would have to say that I see two viable options here: *NVDA and MSFT*. MSFT is pretty easy to explain; they create a product that fundamentally has lower upstart costs (software development's most expensive attribute is the cost of human labor) and lower maintenance costs (I would think). There is some movement towards a more data-center driven profit scheme (which would require boots on ground hardware en masse), and Azure is certainly an AWS competitor, but I think we've yet to see them really go full throttle on that (I think it could be big if they did).\n\nNVDA is a leader from a technological perspective. GPU compute-cores are very specialized devices that are good at doing only a few things, but very, *very well.* NVDA has been hammering away at this technology for years - they know the game, and they know where the money is. Autonomous cars, drones...the computer viz recogition software for postal, for literally anything, runs on a platform that is fundamentally a GPU (very high level view here). Machine learning applications in this field at the data-center level (think machine learning on AWS) are absolutely dominated by NVDA; In fact I would go as far as to say there aren't really a lot of competitors out there that are bringing to the table what NVDA does (Honestly AMD has severely gimped even their consumer dies at this point).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can elaborate more, but I'd go with MSFT and NVDA on this one.",

Bought more at 15.20 before Ryzen launch, and then it started to drop. I panic sold. Then it was going up again between 14 and 15ish. I decided it was time to stop. So I set a buy above and below the current price.\n\nForgot to cancel one after the other filled and I doubled up on margin. Next day, -10%. Then it continued sliding until like... $9. Was up around 40%, then down nearly 80% on my first play. Then I got margin called. I decided the best play was to straight up ignore the emails from questrade. Play fucking dumb - who cares. \n\nThankfully it bottomed out and I rode it back up until I was profitable, sitting on over 1100 shares at an average of 14.20. Decided to stop being a dumbshit and [\"diversified\"](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/diversified).  Could have made a fat stack if I held all of it.

I looked some 5/29 puts, first OTM, and compared the premium received (bid) and the strike to get some percentages. You can think of this as a percentage return in a week (premium received / collateral held for a cash secured put):\n\nGOOG:\n\n15.90/1410 = 0.011\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAMZN:\n\n30.45/2435 = 0.013\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMSFT:\n\n1.74/182.5 = 0.01\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTSLA:\n\n19.05/815 = 0.023\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAMD:\n\n1.08/55 = 0.02\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSPY:\n\n3.09/295 = 0.01\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTQQQ:\n\n4.4/79 = 0.056\n\nBasically, for the best return in a weeks time?
