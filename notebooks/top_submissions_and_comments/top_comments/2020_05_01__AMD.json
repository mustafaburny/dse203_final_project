        "body": "I can give the perspective from a tech/software dev.\n\nIn my opinion, these are sort of different players. In fact, I would say that NVDA and AMD are far more analogous to each other than even AMD -&gt; AAPL, and certainly to MSFT. The  way that I see it, NVDA/AMD are fundamentally companies that are concerned with producing a *physical good* \\- literal chipsets and dies. AAPL seems to waver on the hardware side of things (they have been known to go proprietary in that arena, but have also loaned out work to INTC on more than one occasion). I most certainly see MSFT as a true software/PaaS/SaaS company - suffice to say that they are producing very little in the way of physical goods.\n\nI think the *soft/hardware* direction is important to mention, because that fundamentally plays into the way that these companies deal in the market. Developing hardware is a mind-bendingly expensive process (relatively speaking). It takes years of R&amp;D and cash on hand to fund something that is truly great. An example of this would be the move AMD made to Zen (which is based on the concept of 'chiplets'; highly-scalable many-core designs that are fundamentally different from their monolithic predecessors).\n\nIn terms of growth, I would have to say that I see two viable options here: *NVDA and MSFT*. MSFT is pretty easy to explain; they create a product that fundamentally has lower upstart costs (software development's most expensive attribute is the cost of human labor) and lower maintenance costs (I would think). There is some movement towards a more data-center driven profit scheme (which would require boots on ground hardware en masse), and Azure is certainly an AWS competitor, but I think we've yet to see them really go full throttle on that (I think it could be big if they did).\n\nNVDA is a leader from a technological perspective. GPU compute-cores are very specialized devices that are good at doing only a few things, but very, *very well.* NVDA has been hammering away at this technology for years - they know the game, and they know where the money is. Autonomous cars, drones...the computer viz recogition software for postal, for literally anything, runs on a platform that is fundamentally a GPU (very high level view here). Machine learning applications in this field at the data-center level (think machine learning on AWS) are absolutely dominated by NVDA; In fact I would go as far as to say there aren't really a lot of competitors out there that are bringing to the table what NVDA does (Honestly AMD has severely gimped even their consumer dies at this point).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can elaborate more, but I'd go with MSFT and NVDA on this one.",

AMD is also slowly eating Intel's market share as well. Which NVDA can't do.\n\nAAPL is being destroyed by Huawei especially in China. And the growing anti-US sentiment in China as well as China being one of the few economically opened markets through this Pandemic won't help Apple's overall sales anytime soon.\n\nMSFT is a blue chip. It's not going to grow very fast. It will likely move with the overall market.\n\nAMD will be that stock in 2025 that people will go, \"I wish I would've bought AMD back in 2017 after Lisa Su overhauled the product line.\" Like AAPL 2004, AMZN 2012, or NFLX 2013. Full diclosure, I bought a boat load of AMD at \\~$10 in 2017. I don't know if that makes me too biased to listen to or more credible about the stock but there you go.",
