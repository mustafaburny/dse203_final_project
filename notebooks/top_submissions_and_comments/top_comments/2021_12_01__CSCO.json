If you pick the right stocks, adjust your portfolio, and make good plays and time your buys well, stock picking can be great... but the problem comes with the fact that unless you're investing in specific stocks, most stocks go flat or die. People who bought Cisco and stuck with it since then are now underperforming the market, for instance, and Cisco's basically a success case.  \n\n\nCSCO jumped from 47.75 at the start of the year to 56.23 now, which is about half the market's move in the same timeframe.

People can't even agree on what those things really are. You have companies planning to create the same virtual worlds that were possible 20 years ago, but this time calling it \"Metaverse\", and suddenly it boosts valuations because they saw an article in the Wall Street Journal about it and Mark Zuckerburg said its the future.

I mean, NVDA's earnings are 33% lower then Amazon's, although their revenue is 15 times lower their margins are insane and the only reason they can't sell more hardware is because there's a worldwide shortage, their retail price is also so low retailers can literally charge twice as much and still sell everything they received in a day. This kind of growth is already priced in, it's a growing market, one that's growing so fast supply literally can't keep up.\n\nThis is transitory. Their demand is entirely pumped up by a perfect storm of stimulus boosting consumer demand, and the mining bubble boosting demand from people seeking to profit. When that bursts, so will there sales, especially with Intel entering the market.\n\n&gt;It's a different market, it's different times, the world is very different today than what it was 3 years ago (COVID), and the world 3 years ago was very different to what it was 15 years ago.

Fast Ethernet was 1995. Gigabit 1999. 10gig really didn't start taking off until nearly 2010, and fiber is still sporadic. And yeah, there were incremental improvements, and expansions along the way, but it still stands in stark contrast to the near-daily innovation happening in FLOPS (floating point operations per second) throughput.\n\nCisco hasn't been on the cutting edge of anything for a long time. They got lazy, rode on their name, and stopped innovating. Nvidia, on the other hand, is the *technical* king of their craft, and unlike Cisco, and IBM before it, they're still doing it.\n\nCisco, like IBM before them, got to a point where they weren't doing anything anyone else couldn't do better and cheaper. Nvidia's not there yet. AMD might get them someday, but as it stands, their capital is still relatively limited, and their main focus seems to be taking advantage of Intel's stumbles to knock Intel off the top of the mountain. Not happening anytime soon.\n\nNvidia is the undisputed king of FLOPS. They're ahead of the pack, and they're running faster than anyone else. Cisco was sitting on their asses for a long time when the let down came. There's just absolutely no comparison to be made, and attempting to do so demonstrates a fundamental lack of understanding in the space.\n\nNow, it's always possible that Nvidia's culture could fall prey to the same MBA idiocy that took down IBM (which is a more apt comparison, because they had a lot of runway, much like Nvidia does, unlike the shorter runway provided by switching technology.) But that's an issue of company culture, and you can't make that argument for Nvidia as it stands today.",

You need grey neck beards to make their stuff work.  \n\nI like that Larry was involved in the America's cup, but he cheated.

It's also ironic that as the world moves away from or hide the POSIX model, everything is looking more like an AS400.     IBM kind of missed out on this hypertext fad, and that was their death knell.   Maybe Watson can save them, but it might be a gimmick.    \n\nCisco did a nice job of getting all the \"I want a lucrative career in IT\" pups trained in on their stuff, essentially locking themselves in as the de-facto standard.

If you pick the right stocks, adjust your portfolio, and make good plays and time your buys well, stock picking can be great... but the problem comes with the fact that unless you're investing in specific stocks, most stocks go flat or die. People who bought Cisco and stuck with it since then are now underperforming the market, for instance, and Cisco's basically a success case.  \n\n\nCSCO jumped from 47.75 at the start of the year to 56.23 now, which is about half the market's move in the same timeframe. CSCO's dividend is 2.6%... not horrible, but it doesn't offset the opportunity loss. \n\nEquities don't gain compound interest. This is an unfortunate misnomer that's come from fund marketers trying to pump 401ks and it's radiated out to promote a buy-and-hold mentality which establishes a value baseline for funds. The value of a share of CSCO doesn't compound, in this example. If you bought it at the beginning of the year and it dropped to $45 tomorrow, the holder has lost $2.75 per share, full stop.",

Its a great company with great growth ahead but there is such a thing as overpaying for growth. Intel is currently the most profitable chip maker in the industry. They make over 77 billion dollars in revenue and Nvidia makes over 16 billion dollars in revenue yet they are currently priced to be 3 times bigger then Intel is right now. Its a big hype and speculation stock. \n\nNvidia is here to stay and they are probably going to keep increasing revenue and earnings but that doesn\u2019t mean their stock price id going to move.",
