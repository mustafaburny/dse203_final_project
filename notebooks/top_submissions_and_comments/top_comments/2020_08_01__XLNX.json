        "body": "Intel is the most prominent because it used to be Altera but intel bought them. However intel has been in some rocky water with chips recently which points to XLNX doing better. NVDA is another one, but XLNX has specialized in the FPGAs or Field Programmable Gate Arrays and really taken that as their niche. \n\nThe most exciting thing about that is that a lot of electrical engineer journals i read while researching the company stated that there has been no perfect fit for FPGAs yet. What tends to happen is that FPGAs, due to their built in flexibility, are not the optimal piece to use for the final product created by the end user. Generally, the end user can find some other chip that performs the job at a slightly more efficient clip at the end of the production cycle of the product.\n\nWhy is that exciting? Well in those same electrical engineering journals they stated that VR and AI may be the best fits for FPGAs, because those technologies need to constantly adapt to their environment and change specifications (especially AI because of machine learning characteristics). Essentially, I see XLNX as a good bet for 5G, which is inevitable, a good bet for automated vehicles, which isn\u2019t too far off, and a good bet for VR and AI, which may never happen. If they do though, XLNX could stand to profit a ton.",

        "body": "Intel is trying to compete in GPU with Ponte Vecchio, but that was designed around the Intel 7nm process. I stopped trying to follow whether or not they'd leverage TSMC capacity for that as it seemed to change on a daily basis.\n\nYou mentioned the difference between GPUs and accelerators but you do have to keep in mind that the high end GPU products actually just have tensor cores on them anyway. The v100, for example, has 640 tensor cores on it. Since you mentioned Altera, there are also a lot of interesting ML/API capabilities for FPGAs. I think Xilinx is probably the leader in that space but both Intel and Xilinx have to contend with the fact that there is just a lot more IP available for GPU right now, partly due to the Nvidia software catalog.",

However, they also spent a lot creating tools for marketplaces and licensing so that you can access a market of FPGA IP, but at a cost. Until there's more incentive to have opensource FPGA IP, I don't think adoption is going to be very good.",
