        "body": "MONTREAL, Sept. 29, 2021 /CNW Telbec/ - Lightspeed Commerce Inc. (NYSE: LSPD) (TSX: LSPD) today commented on the short seller report published today by Spruce Point Capital Management.\n\nThe report contains numerous important inaccuracies and mischaracterizations which Lightspeed believes are misleading and clearly intended to benefit Spruce Point, which itself has disclosed that it stands to profit in the event that the stock price of Lightspeed declines. Lightspeed cautions investors to not make decisions based on this report and instead strongly encourages them to consult credible sources, including Lightspeed's filings with the Canadian securities regulatory authorities and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, prior to making their investment decisions.\n\nLightspeed is confident in its governance, financial reporting and business practices. Lightspeed has consistently delivered revenue growth since its initial listing on the Toronto Stock Exchange in March 2019. In the quarter ended June 30, 2021, revenue of $115.9M increased 220% from the prior year quarter with organic1 software and transaction-based revenue growth of 78%.\n\nThe Company will not be providing further comment on the report at this time as it maintains its focus on building its business and delivering exceptional products and services for customers. \n\n1\nReferences herein to \"organic\" growth exclude the impact of any acquisitions that occurred since the end of the prior comparable period so as to provide a consistent basis of comparison.\nAbout Lightspeed\n\nPowering the businesses that are the backbone of the global economy, Lightspeed's one-stop commerce platform helps merchants innovate to simplify, scale and provide exceptional customer experiences. The cloud solution transforms and unifies online and physical operations, multichannel sales, expansion to new locations, global payments, financing and connection to supplier networks.\n\nFounded in Montr\u00e9al, Canada in 2005, Lightspeed is dual-listed on the New York Stock Exchange and Toronto Stock Exchange (NYSE: LSPD) (TSX: LSPD). With teams across North America, Europe and Asia Pacific, the company serves retail, hospitality and golf businesses in over 100 countries.",

What I can say is that a lot of those names have been trading very high lately... AMD, Nvidia, TSM, ASML, etc. Those companies in particular all seem to have bright futures, but if there is any significant correction in tech stocks, you're very exposed, especially if you bought recently at high valuations.  You'll have very little margin of safety.\n\nAnd if there's any broader economic disruption, it's possible that not all of these companies make it out safe and sound, or at least as healthy as you'd like to seem them given current valuations.\n\nFor example, even good companies like Cisco didn't make it out in one piece from the dot-com bubble.  And old industry leaders like IBM and Intel have gotten hammered in the past two decades, while Microsoft made something of a surprise comeback after being declared dead around 2012.\n\nThe point is that if you've bought growth stories, that's OK, but it seems your whole portfolio is growth stories.  It's forward-looking.  Which is the idea, in a way, but IMO you want at least some of your portfolio dedicated to something that is solid in the present, and doesn't rely on a growth story in order to generate or even maintain returns.  The benefit of an ETF is you get a bit of everything, and even QQQ is quite diversified compared to your portfolio.  \n\nI'm new but this is my understanding of things.  I hope it made sense.",

Selling the call spread is a little bit easier to predict what you'll make. If you buy a put spread, the vol collapse and the spread having to go fully ITM to realize a full gain has more variables at work. You can buy the put spread and still lose even with having the direction right.\n\nWorking myself out of a put that is ITM right now.\n\nI'm looking to get out next week and waiting until earnings to put new positions on.  \n\nI wouldn't be betting against MU just because spot prices are falling. That means supply chains are working their way out and that they will be producing at capacity vs charging a little bit more per diminished output. They can actually make more money overall at lower prices. This will be a quicker price recovery than the 2011 Fukushima earthquake. Demand is not going away.",

        "body": "Less bad then you might think. Most people fundamentally misunderstand what caused the supply crunch thus fundamentally misunderstand who is adversely affected.\n\nCovid didn't suddenly cause a massive spike in demand in order to precipitate a crunch. There was some demand increase in consumer electronics sector as more people purchased equipement to work from home but this is rather minimal and mostly focused on products that people didn't already have and are using lower end semiconductor processes, think webcams, mice, keyboards. Take a look at LOGI to see how this side of the demand increase played out.\n\nNow, so what -actually- caused the supply crunch? Well actually it was automakers and other traditional industries that forecasted a massive decrease in demand cancelling or scaling back their supply contracts. This caused foundries to either spin down for retool or sell capacity to someone else. Both are having a significant impact on auto chips right now which are mostly produced on the less advanced 32nm+ node processes.\n\nThe latter is why this affects TSLA less (though they are ultimately still affected which I will address later). They went ahead and purchased the depressed capacity, similarly AAPL/GOOG/QCOM/MRVL all took advantage of this to buy up capacity and lock in cheaper rates for the next couple of years while autos and industrial companies were panicking about a sustained economic recession.\n\nHowever this still ultimately does affect TSLA (and NIO, LI, etc that took similar approaches) in that purchasing capacity during the dip doesn't protect you from increased requirements going forward due to growth. So while they aren't needing to cut production like traditional autos that stupidly cancelled their contracts they aren't able to grow capacity because the same companies that cancelled are now willing to buy capacity at a premium and are buying everything they can.\n\nThis has some big follow-on effects for the semi-conductor industry though, especially combined with developments over the last few years w.r.t geopolitics. Firstly all the big foundries (INTC/TSM/Samsung) are building out new fabs now. These take 2-3 years to online but once they do come online we are going to see a massive supply glut which will drastically lower the prices of NAND, consumer electronics chips etc and free up the older fabs for the next gen of auto/industrial chips which will slowly upgrade from 32nm+.\n\nThe boom/bust, crunch/glut cycle is nothing new for semi-conductors but there has just been a perfect storm of factors to make this particular cycle very noticable for the first time of people outside of consumer electronics.",
