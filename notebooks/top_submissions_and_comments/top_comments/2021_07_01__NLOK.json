        "body": "To preface this, I have an MBA and have spent years studying some of this stuff. It's not a race, but a marathon. Take things in small chunks. Also, I've never found a comprehensive book that brings everything together. (It would be impossibly large.) To become an effective investor and trader, you need to develop a variety of skills. My own approach is top-down. At the highest level, you've got:\n\n1. How the stock market (really) works;\n2. How the options market (really) works;\n3. Macroeconomics;\n4. Trading principles;\n5. Financial accounting (for fundamental analysis and cross-company comparisons);\n6. Finance;\n7. Statistics;\n8. Technical analysis;\n9. Strategic analysis (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats);\n10. Trade/Investment design: including portfolio management and risk management;\n11. Data sources and tools; \n12. Integration (of everything into a concrete trading system); and\n13. Experience executing, documenting, and learning through a \"negative feedback loop.\"\n \nI'm going to suggest some of the books that I've found helpful, but I have a broader recommendation: go to https://b-ok.org or http://gen.lib.rus.ec and look for yourself. Search on what you're interested in. Grab a large number of books. See what each says on a particular topic. Find the one that makes the most sense to you. Not everyone will agree on what the \"best\" books are, so I can only suggest what I've personally found helpful, or have some other reason for recommending.\n\nReady?\n\nHere we go:\n\n1. KP Security Industry Essentials: License Exam Manual, 3rd ed.\n\nEveryone who wants to trade securities for someone else (i.e. to become a licensed professional) needs to get sponsored by a financial institution and pass a series of licensing examinations. Anyone can take the very first one, including you and me. The book, above, is a manual that prepares you to pass that first exam, which is about how the stock and options markets work at a high level: https://www.finra.org/sites/default/files/SIE_Content_Outline.pdf\n\nI don't know where you can find the manual that I have online, but if you private message me, I can help to point you in the right direction.\n\n2. The best place to start for most people is _The Options Playbook_ by Brian Overby. It's dead simple and short. There is also an accompanying website: https://optionsplaybook.com/. (Check out the strategies section.)\n\nI also created a PowerPoint presentation to help newcomers to learn options; it makes it especially easy to understand the game being played. It's intended to be delivered as an online lecture with Q&amp;A as we go. We've presented it once, and might record the next one and put it up on YouTube. \n\nOnce you get your bearings, read:\n\n_Trading Options Greeks: How Time, Volatility, and Other Pricing Factors Drive Profits_ by Dan Passarelli\n\n__Trading Options in Turbulent Markets_ by Larry Shover\n\n3. _Macroeconomics_, 10th ed., by N. Gregory Mankiw\n\n_Guide to Economic Indicators Making Sense of Economics by The Economist_\n\n_Economics for Investment Decision Makers: Micro, Macro, and International Economics_ by Christopher D. Piros CFA, Jerald E. Pinto, and Larry Harris\n\n4. We (we're a learning community of friends and collaborators who work hard to build wealth and generate cash for short-term expenditures; we always look for sharp, eager people who want to learn, improve, and contribute, to our community) developed 57 trading principles that many people have made a great deal of money by using. We're not going to publish them on Reddit, and even though they're easy to understand and very concise, they take significant experience to learn to apply effectively. I consider these absolutely essential.\n\nOther individuals or groups have developed their own trading principles. Many of these are similar (so you can bet that those that repeat often across individuals and groups are good advice). I can't vouch for any but our own. The most important point is to follow a set of principles consistently, literally every single time. (We believe that ours are universally valid.) And always judge those principles, whichever ones you use by the results that they produce. Just don't wing trades, or you're gambling, and that's no way to make money over time.\n\n5. _Financial Intelligence_ by Karen Berman. This is the gentlest introduction to financial accounting that I know of, but I have to be honest and say that unless you have a business background, the first two-thirds of the book will seem vacuous, and the final third, useful but perhaps not actionable. This isn't an action-oriented trading book, but one intended to explain to you what the numbers on financial statements mean, where the money's going, and what financial ratios mean, so that you can really understand the financial statements and use them to compare one company against similar ones to see how strong or weak it is in various ways. This book is infinitely easier and more useful than a proper financial accounting textbook, but if you really (really) want to learn financial accounting, en route to mastering fundamental analysis, you may want to study:\n\n_Fundamental Accounting Principles_, 24th ed., by John J. Wild\n\n6. _Introduction to Finance: Markets, Investments, and Financial Management, 16th ed._ by Ronald W. Melicher and Edgar A Norton.\n\nThis is a tremendously important book that will teach you about our financial system and the relationships between money and time. (Think of it as the financial counterpart to philosopher Martin Heidegger's _Being and Time_. :) )\n\n7. _Discovering Statistics Using R_ by Andy Field, Jeremy Miles, and Zoe Field\n\nThis is a great book for both learning statistics and the R language. (If you buy the paper version, you're going to freak out at how large and heavy it is. You've _never_ seen a book like this!) It's overkill for what you need to do, but so, so useful. (You need to learn to grab stock data from a data source, such as the Google Finance API, get it into Excel, and then import it into R, and check things such as how strongly two securities (or other entities such as an index) are correlated [so that you can exploit divergences when they occur], descriptive statistics, etc.)\n\n8. _The Art and Science of Technical Analysis_ by Adam Grimes. There's also an accompanying workbook: _The Art and Science of Trading: Course Workbook Course Workbook_. You'll like these, a lot!\n\n9. I don't have a specific book recommendation here, but instead: read the annual report (10-K) of the company that you're interested in. Pay attention to the SWOT factors, and compare them against those of competitors. Consider the total size of the addressable market (TAM), the age and track record of the CEO, what employees say about the company on glassdoor.com, etc. Use seekingalpha.com. (Install the \"Bypass Paywalls Clean\" extension for your web browser to bypass the paywall.)\n\n10. I don't have a specific book in mind here, since what we do comes from experience, but I'd love suggestions, if anyone else has them! You really need to use stop losses and manage risk, but you also need to know when to sell securities from a long-term portfolio and buy something else, or just stay in cash and wait. Lock in gains. \n\n11. In addition to my comments in 7, you either need to develop your own tools, which could be as simple as Excel worksheets with data imported from gurufocus.com, or use someone else's. Remember that the investment banks, hedge funds, and prop trading firms have python developers, statisticians, financiers, et al., whose day job is to take our money away! We can't fight them by trading by the seat of our pants. We need data, tools, and a process, that's sensitive to changing market conditions. \n\n12. This isn't a book recommendation, but a comment. The more that you learn from the above, the stronger of a position you'll be in to truly see the big picture and make strong stock picks and design winning options plays. Build a trading system for yourself (or just join and help us :) ).\n\n13. Another comment: practice. Trade in all conditions, using very small position sizes. It's the only way that you'll learn. Trade on the way up. Trade on the way down. Trade to win. Document everything, perform a post-mortem analysis on every trade, and work hard to learn what to keep doing and what to stop doing.\n\nFinally, subscribe to Richard Moglen's YouTube channel. Watch all of the elite traders that he interviews. Read their books. See if a particular style resonates with (i.e. works for) you. Take small steps and play the long game. If you can verify that you've got an edge, run with it. If not, it's okay. Just keep investing money index funds and get rich slowly. All will be well.\n\nI hope this helps a bit!\n\nArtem",

Problem is: some bank institutes don't want to finance them because of the bad press.\n\nMy take:\nA) offers a good margin of safety even if things go south. B) banks want one thing and that is make money. GEO offers strong CF and is likely to be able to repay debt and interest. I believe some institute is going to refinance them.\n\nI hope that helped. I wish you all the best and continue to do your own DD. I am interested in your opinion!\n\nBR,\nChris",

This means we have no edge in w.e analysis we have. those privy to this information before hand will have edge. If you are relying on this, your hope is that someone in the future sees the same value you see today.\n\nyou will find your dd has a tendency to be more right in a bull market, since everything is going up. \n\nIf you really want to confirm your DD and research ability, then you will have to find those come back stories in bull markets and have a high degree of success. You will also need to be able to identify when a stock will sell off.\n\nHowever, unless you are getting paid well and this is your sole occupation, its unlikely you will pick up on these, to the success that would confirm your ability.\n\nsome people will disagree with the above, but this is my observations after 15 years.\n\nYour best bet in being successful is focusing on risk management.\n\nYour overall portfolio should have an expected return and a plan for a drawdown. Within this portfolio you can have an allocation for riskier plays but a drawdown in these positions should not eclipse your expected annual return.\n\nThe real game is holding on to your winnings.",

No revenue, but huge multi billion valuations.\n\n&gt; Where as today the tech giants are figuratively printing profits.\n\nThe tech giants of yesteryear were also printing profits like MSFT, HPQ, CISCO, etc. Those were the FAANGs of the day.",
