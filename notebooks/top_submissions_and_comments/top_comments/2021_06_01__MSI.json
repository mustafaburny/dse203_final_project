        "body": "I'm a LT investor in INTC. LT as in nearing decade rather than years.\n\nIMO INTC isn't good for the short term and you'd have to have a lot of faith in Gelsinger turning the ship around. Right now Intel is not undervalued but IMO fairly priced given the risks involved in investing in it. The price is right but I think OP is looking at the upside potential compared to the price and sees a deal. As someone holding the company and considering my holdings, I would say there is upside potential (esp if you hold long) but it's not \"undervalued\".\n\nThe reason why it's not \"undervalued\" is because it's losing and getting disrupted. It's a tech company in the sense that it's in the field of high tech semis, but it's NOT a tech company in the sense of growth and disrupting others. In fact it's looking like a dinosaur. TSM, CSM, Samsung, etcetc. AMD, NVDA, ARM, etcetc. All bombarding it from all sides. Cheaper &amp; faster manufacturing, 7nm/5mn foundries built and running, 7nm/5nm designed and selling, already developing 5nm/3nm, etctec. \n\nAnd that's before we get into the real problem: the FAAAMs &amp; BATs are looking for places to expand and the semi space is where many of them are looking. \n\n&gt;Apple recently stopped using Intel chips and have their in house designed M1/M2 chips manufactured by TSM. Apple isn't going back to INTC anytime soon. And Apple doesn't go away. Nokia/Motorola phones basically dead, watch industry forever changed, Ipad industry disrupted, app store still dominating, apple computers aren't made by someone else, etcetc. Intel cannot fight back against Apple and it will NEVER kill Apple. Maybe Apple gets too comfy and declines, but that's not something Intel can control. If anything, the last 20 years have shown Apple only gets stronger and better with each reiteration of their products.\n\n&gt;MSFT? Doing the same thing AAPL is doing. Intel ain't effecting, killing, or pushing out Microsoft either. MSFT is bigger, more corporate, more innovative, and has stronger ties to China which INTC does not have. INTC isn't going to kill the Xbox, windows, office, github, skype, linkedin, bing, etctec. Nope. INTC has it's hands full desperately struggling to catch up to AMD/NVD/SMG on development and SMG/TSM/CSM in manufacturing. \n\n&gt;AMZN? Already dominating everything. Has AWS needs. Will look to in-housing their chips if supply issues become a problem. AMZN make so much money it has to actively lose money going into new businesses to keep from paying boatloads of taxes. Right now it's shipping, but chips could be next now that it sees MSFT/AAPL doing it.\n\n&gt;GOOG? Already doing chips in their own way. Leader in AI. Can use chips in their own chromebooks/phones. Fighting a cloud war in AAPL which chips might come in handy. Also has tons of cash laying around.\n\n&gt;Now FB is in a war with AAPL with apple using it's products to lockout FB datamining. FB is complaining about Apple app store fees and monopoly. FB will look to ways to circumvent that by going into hardware. And thus they'll be incentivized to not use INTC or go into chips themselves.\n\n&gt;Chinese BATs looking to do the same. Japanese tech leaders playing defensive but not backing down. Europe doesn't have the same tech titans but will pull some legislative B.S. to protect their own markets.\n\nSee the real reason I say INTC isn't \"undervalued\" is because it's fairly valued given the very real threats that surround it on multiple sides. It's big, has US government backing, in a still growing industry, and can whether a beating. But INTC was INTC because it was a technology leader that disrupted the industry. It's technology lead was what kept AAPL using INTC chips and everyone off their back. It was their moat. And now that moat is disappearing if not gone with a lot of bigger, stronger, more innovative, more driven, better runned, and better funded companies that they have no answer to eating it's market share.",

They went from being a pretty consistent budget option to being one of the best options around for memory. They've segued into peripherals very easily, and seem to be following the same pattern. They made a lot of cheap but reliable products, and then moved into the high end of quality. They are rarely the biggest brand name for any product, but it's even rarer they're a bad choice.\n\nAs to the stock itself, it's sitting at a P/E of 24, which puts them on par with Logitech, above MSI, and under people like AMD. I'm not sure there's a great case for them being incorrectly valued to a large degree in either direction. If I were to invest in Corsair, it would have to be a long-term investment, because I believed in their ability to continue expanding and improving. They are still a growth investment in that respect. I would definitely not be buying short-term moonshot call options.",

Some of them still exist today, but they are basically relics of a bygone age.

Intel and AMD's sales aren't primarily composed of retail sales, they are from OEM companies like Dell, HP, Lenovo, ASUS, MSI, etc. Yeah, there's a market for learning about computers, but definitely nowhere near enough of a market such that it should even be mentioned when talking about sustaining a business like GameStop.\n\nAnd finally, in regards to eCommerce and online sales, if you think GameStop is so innovative for same-day delivery, you're missing out, as Amazon and Walmart have already rolled that out in some markets. When it comes to eCommerce, there is no room for them in the market to establish a new marketplace. On PC they cannot compete with the spending done by Tencent-backed Epic Games to secure free games, nor can they compete with the chokehold on the entire market that Steam maintains. On consoles, there's no reason in shit people would order digital games from GameStop when they can just order the games from the respective platform stores, whether from the PSN Store, the Nintendo eShop, or the Xbox Store. Plus, the above poster is definitely correct. Look towards the market of video to know where the market of gaming is going. The Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Hulu, Disney Plus, and HBO Max of gaming are going to be Xbox Game Pass, and their PlayStation and Nintendo counterparts. Yeah, sure, you can still buy videos digitally, but who the fuck does that anymore?",

At first glance, they are already offering more services than a bank, and the best part is, everything can be accessed directly in the palm of your hand, not waiting in line for a teller.\"\n\"SoFi is structured around 3 key segments, Lending, Financial Services, &amp; Its Technology platform.\n\nIts lending platform offers student loan refinancing, personal loans, home loans, and school loans.\n\nIts financial services include its stock\ntrading app and the recently launched\nSoFi credit card. All of these businesses\noffer a huge advantage in that they can\ncross-sell multiple financial products in\norder to boost revenue while lowering\nchurn. This has been highlighted by its\nmulti-product member growth going\nfrom 74k in Q2'19 to 400k today and a\nplan to get that to 775k by the end of\n2021.\n\nOne of my favorite parts of Sofi and why\nlam bullish on the company is its\nTechnology Platform. This includes a\nproduct called Galileo, which powers\nSofi Money and companies like Chime,\nTransferwise, and even Robinhood.\nGalileo is an API and white-labeled\npayments platform. This means that\nother companies looking to build\nfinancial services products can build on\nthis technology, creating an alternative\nrevenue stream for SoFi.",

It will happen instantly unlike many services, cheaper and will be done with using crypto so there\u2019s no issue having to convert or exchange money into another currency. As someone who has family back home, my grandparents always watch the Filipino channel and half the commercials are about how to send money home and they always have a huge fee because it\u2019s not as feasible with other platforms so it costs a lot more.\n\nBeing able to use PayPal to buy things from other countries isn\u2019t the same as using it to send money to other people in other countries. People live very different lives to those of us in 1st world countries. Many of these people (about 50% of the world) don\u2019t have bank accounts. An app like humbl can help make the transition from all paper/coin transactions to having the ability to buy/sell/transfer anywhere in the world on one app at lower costs compared to existing services in their areas",

I'm from Singapore and we have this App called DBS Paylah which is a P2P payment app, basically anytime i want to transfer money to a friend i simply type in their number and the amount that i want to transfer to them, this works for businesses as well, and there is no extra charge of the sort. Is this similar to what paypal means to you, i presume in the united states?",

Every request, such as bank account approval takes weeks or months to complete. The fees are quite high. Besides, I don't see much progress over the years, they still offer the same limited amount of services as 10 years ago, their target market is freelancers/nomads/digital entrepreneurs. They have partnerships with all the major marketplaces such as fiverr, upwork, envato and so on. You'll always find payoneer amongst default withdrawal methods.\n\nThe unique perk of payoneer is that it provides a virtual US bank account. It's very convenient for foreign entrepreneurs, who want to start an online business in the US. Only a few companies can do that.\n\nThe main competitors are PayPal, Transferwise, Payability, Airwallex, Hyperwallet, WorldFirst, Mercury. The mercury.com is a new competitor, they provide virtual bank accounts as well.\n\nTL;DR payoneer - lazy ass company, stagnating over the years.",
