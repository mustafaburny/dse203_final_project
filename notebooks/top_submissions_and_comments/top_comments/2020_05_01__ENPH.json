New Call of Duty is going to be a killer. July calls to be safe\n* MO - Trading 40% less than it's fair value according to MS\n* FLXN - Guggenheim just announced a massive 106% upside. Stock went up 4% in afterhours\n* ENPH - Solar energy hype is real and is comings strong. ENPH is the only big player and just had a dip\n* SIMO - HK based semi-conducted giant that just took an unfair beating with China news. Company is compliant since they are based in HK",

        "body": "No, it\u2019s nearly at 52 week highs. Yeah the breakout stock in a recession/depression with extreme unemployment is a solar company that has high costs to convert struggling businesses/homeowners from fossil fuel dependency to solar dependency. Maybe if things were going really well for businesses and consumers, this would. And it probably will be in the future. But to say with 30% or whatever of citizens out of work and majority of businesses showing decreased revenue and earnings, now is clearly not the time to pay a big up front fee to convert when they\u2019re worried about paying employees and leases next month. Long shares, sure. Calls a month out? Fuck no. Maybe leaps. **maybe**. Even jpow said this shit economy will take longer than originally expected to bounce back. Enph is cyclical, it drives up then drives down. I would be weary and trying to find a peak to sell your shares and I goddamn sure wouldn\u2019t be buying a call.\n\nAlso as another comment posted, your claim of 97.5% efficiency from solar panels is only attainable if you have some fucking alien technology, they all sit around 20% and MAX 45%. Ain\u2019t no fucking business or consumer paying 10,000% premium to squeeze an extra 20% off efficiency when I can connect to city power for 1/25 of the upfront cost and even if I did, I wouldn\u2019t expect to see a recoup of my initial upfront investment of \u201cgoing green\u201d for 5 years.

It's easy to doubt our decisions, right?   \n\n\nSEDG is similar to ENPH. I think SEDG is more focused on optimizers and ENPH more on micro inverters on every panel which might require some more up-front costs. Together, they occupy about 95% of that market. I think they'll both do fine in the long run. SEDG seems to have good growth rates and solid financial fundamentals. Anyway, this is for commercial, industrial and domestic use. It's how I imagine the future. I need to do some more digging on ENPH and might open a position there, too.",
