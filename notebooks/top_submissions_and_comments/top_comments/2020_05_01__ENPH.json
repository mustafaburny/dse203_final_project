Yeah the breakout stock in a recession/depression with extreme unemployment is a solar company that has high costs to convert struggling businesses/homeowners from fossil fuel dependency to solar dependency. Maybe if things were going really well for businesses and consumers, this would. And it probably will be in the future. But to say with 30% or whatever of citizens out of work and majority of businesses showing decreased revenue and earnings, now is clearly not the time to pay a big up front fee to convert when they\u2019re worried about paying employees and leases next month. Long shares, sure. Calls a month out? Fuck no. Maybe leaps. **maybe**. Even jpow said this shit economy will take longer than originally expected to bounce back. Enph is cyclical, it drives up then drives down. I would be weary and trying to find a peak to sell your shares and I goddamn sure wouldn\u2019t be buying a call.\n\nAlso as another comment posted, your claim of 97.5% efficiency from solar panels is only attainable if you have some fucking alien technology, they all sit around 20% and MAX 45%. Ain\u2019t no fucking business or consumer paying 10,000% premium to squeeze an extra 20% off efficiency when I can connect to city power for 1/25 of the upfront cost and even if I did, I wouldn\u2019t expect to see a recoup of my initial upfront investment of \u201cgoing green\u201d for 5 years.

I think they'll both do fine in the long run. SEDG seems to have good growth rates and solid financial fundamentals. Anyway, this is for commercial, industrial and domestic use.

It became a dinosaur with the emergence of personal computers. But while many dinosaurs have been dead for years, IBM is still alive because -- IMO -- it has done one thing right: IBM Research.   IBM Research is what has kept IBM alive, staying with the youngsters.  \n\nGuess what. The current giants have learned from this. They all have invested heavily in research.  Most interestingly is Google. Most of their products are \"betas\", which are experimental research projects that are deployed to the public.\n\nAnother thing the giants have learned is that they need to be very flexible and adaptive to rising trends.   Microsoft raised because of the dominant of software, which by the way was the dead sentence for hardware giants.   But this dominant almost killed Microsoft, turning it into a dinosaur, when software became a commodity and not a specialty product.  Demanding customers to pay for each version of Windows and Word was no longer the right thing to do, Microsoft adapted to a model the sells software as a service.  And they have survived. They have also excelled due to Microsoft Research. This has allowed them to stay at the forefront.\n\nGoogle, Apple and FaceBook will be the dominating players in the near future because -- IMO -- data, data about people, and the interconnection of people have become more important than anything else.\n\nIt is very possible that data will become cheap in some sense, a commodity.  Although data has become more open, certain types of data can be very expensive to collect.  So I think Google and FaceBook will continue to have a promising future.\n\nApple is in a very interesting situation. It doesn't sell a product.   Other cellphone companies sell utilities. But Apple sells the experience of people connecting to people. It's like FaceBook in some way.  People inherent want to connect to other people. This is a lasting value. As long as Apple excels at this, it will be around for a long time.",

        "body": "I don't have an opionion on many of these, but I have looked into some. What I am missing most about your list is the financials and management analysis. Good investments are only good if you can calculate an expected return on the capital, otherwise you're just hoping that the stock goes up in value because someone else will be there to pay even more than you did without any underlying reason. Good investments are only good if it is managed so that shareholders get their returns. For lots of companies the shareholder is just another customer that they can get money from to run their business, whatch out for that.\n\nI have some opinions(!) on the following:\n\n\\- FB: They rely solely on their scale and networkeffect to make money. I don't see a moat that protects that network. New exciting apps can greatly reduce this networkeffect, and their scale and profitability with it. With that in mind I can not say definitvely that they will be around in 5, 10, 20 or 30 years. THey might be, they might not be. But if I can not be 100% certain the comapny will be around for the next 30 years, I'm not putting my money in it (rule nr 1: don't loose money). I also don't like the management, they don't seem honest to their users, customers or shareholders.\n\n\\- MSFT: This is one of my biggest holdings. I think the company is run well, the financials are in order, their markets are increasing, many businesses depend on them and are locked in (which is only getting stronger). I don't see them disappearing anytime soon, and even if they have bad years they can scale down in costs, and have enough time and capital to try new things. The only thing I'm worried about at the moment is their popularity, you may be buying at a high price now because there aren't as many good alternatives. I try to avoid popularity like that (what happens to the hot 20yr old when she turns 40?).\n\n\\- WM: I think they are now popular/hype without any good reason. The company might be solid, but I think their growth is not gonna be spectactular. Half the current price would be more realistic if you plan to hold forever.\n\n\\- Cisco: Old behemoth like IBM. They might do well, good long term outlook and their price is acceptable. For the next 30 years they will need to keep up with new technologies and I have a nagging feeling they are milking their existing customers and not focusing on the future enough. Not in my portfolio, but well worth considering.\n\n\\- Apple: I own a couple shares. Great lock-in, good rpicing power, good consumer satisfaction, but future may still be uncertain looking forward 30 years. They depend on constant innovation and trying to get people that next \"fix\" as it were. I'm not sure they can keep that up for years and years and years. Current price is high but acceptable I think, but be on the lookout for changing consumer behavior (new more exciting companies can nibble at their marketshare).\n\n\\- TMobile: I think telecoms are going to face some serious headwinds as satellite cell network communications start. That will be some years from now, but systems like starlink might become serious global contendors wiping out current investments by telco's. I'm not sure investment made now will give you the return you need long term. My money is on starlink IPO.\n\n\\- Financials: I stick to european and canadian banks. Not really any reason other then I don't have first hand experience with american banks.\n\n\\- Volkswagen: I think the car market is too competitive to ever give a steady return without risk of being wiped out multiple times in between. No carmaker has any moat over others. I don't think Tesla has a moat, I don't think Volkwagen has either. If I look for a new car, I don't have any brand loyalty. Their is no real reason for me to buy a volkswagen over a toyato, kia or renault. I think Tesla is massively overvalued, I bought the model3 but returned it in the first week because of all kinds of quality and service problems. I like my 10yr old volvo better. Therefor I don't see any reason to invest in any of them.\n\n\\- Panasonic: I agree with your assesment. I own some shares myself. The company is well run and well positioned to take advantage of a growing market. It may not be a quick return, but I believe long term they will do well.\n\n\\- Crypto: It doesn't produce anything of value nor is it a resource that can be used in production. It is not regulated or controlled by any meaningfull organisation. It is highly manipulated and riddled with fraud (my opinion). Therefor I don't see why it has any inherent value, and I don't own any nor ever have or will. Would you buy land that doesn't produce anything and you cannot build on? Gold has it's uses, just like silver and other scarce metals. Crypto has no inherent use, I would even argue that it's consuming energy to create nothing, and should therefor be of negative value.",

It was the day they met:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Buffett skipped the small talk; he immediately asked Gates whether IBM was going to do well in the future and whether it was a competitor of Microsoft. Computer companies seemed to come and go, and why was that? Gates started explaining. He told Buffett to buy two stocks, Intel and Microsoft. Then he asked Buffett about the economics of newspapers, and Buffett told him that they had gotten worse, because of other media. Within minutes the two were deeply immersed in conversation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe book later talks at length about the dilemma warren had with tech companies, specially Microsoft and Intel:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;And as much as Buffett admired Noyce, he did not buy Intel for the partnership, thus passing on one of the greatest investing opportunities of his life. While he had lowered his investing standards in difficult environments\u2014and would do so again\u2014one compromise he would never make was to give up his margin of safety.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Now, his interest piqued, he bought a hundred shares of Microsoft, which, to him, was like eating a single Cheerio. He couldn\u2019t bring himself to buy any Intel, even though he sometimes bought a hundred shares just to keep track of a company. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Buffett, who deemed computers outside his \u201ccircle of competence,\u201d might still have been the richest man in America instead of Gates, had he bought stock in Microsoft and Intel. Instead, he was now number two. But he did not care. Or rather, he did care\u2014he cared a lot; he would rather be number one, much rather\u2014but he cared far more about avoiding excess risk. He didn\u2019t know which company would turn into the next Microsoft or Intel and which would crash and burn. He would never give up his margin of safety. He knew that the life cycle of many technology businesses was as short as a naked mole rat\u2019s.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;But he would not consider buying a technology stock at *any* price. *\u201cWhen it comes to Microsoft and Intel,\u201d* he said, *\u201cI don\u2019t know what that world will look like ten years from now. And I don\u2019t want to play in a game where the other guy has an advantage.... The software business is not within my circle of competence.... We understand Dilly Bars and not software.\u201d*",

The big red flag to me was one of the tech names he did invest in was IBM. He started buying like in 2011 and finally sold it all a few years ago. That was a big red flag. Out of all the names in tech he could have chosen, he chose the one that had stunted growth. \n\nIronically if this CEO is good and IBM starts focusing on like cloud, they might actually be ok next few years.",

Think how fast we went from 1980 the world of tech (computer capabilities) to 1999?

HOWEVER WITHOUT A WAY TO STORE KWZ Produced on a UV INDEX DAY OF 9 so we have a surplus to use when 0 KWZ are produced on a rainy day or season when the dam dries up for 6 weeks twice a year?   \n     POINT?&gt;??

KB!!!!!!!!!!!!!! IMAGINE ?  THIS SEEMS ALSO SIMPLER SINCE WE JUST NEED A WAY TO STORE Kwz made a dozen ways and THAT IS THE END OF COAL AND DONAL:D  TRUMP\"S VISION OF AMERICA ?&gt;  I voted and might again for the DONALD BUT I BELIEVE PRES OBAMA WHEN HE SAID \"I HAD A Different Vision of America 2000.  \"  IT did not include the black clouds once again eminating from the coal mines of WEST VIRGINIA OR THE 12 hr work days on assembly lines in sweat shops called TRUMP'S \"BRING AMERICA'S FACTORY JOBS BACK!\".

        "body": "Google is search based on text and hoping websites adjust to that using SEO soft influence. Their banners are more and more lowering quality of search and overall search use is dropping due to apps and closed websites. They are big but a niche. Their model works for specific products only.\n\nFacebook is a developing world family and friendship automation. A lot of room to grow in places like Bangladesh. But technology which delivers value to customers is actually simple and they can easily be replaced. They are based on soft value not tech. \n\nAmazon us big in USA. It is a big country which used mail order catalogs way before internet. You can not have a store everywhere in America. Rest of the world isn't like that. They have been adding value to their offering because they want to offer the most for least like all retail but eventually someone will take this over. Just that their competitor can not be in USA or Europe. Europe is too small.\n\nData means nothing to customers. Customers want value for money. Data maybe can help speed up selection within millions of products but this doesn't really work as good as they promise. Ads and e-commerce recommendations are very much off once shoppers are not super easy predictable. Data and AI are a hype.\n\nMicrosoft also is a business software company with some diversification. In business it succeeds just like SAP and Oracle etc. It enters and it is hard to get it out. Not many players there as well as CIOs don't take much risk. But it's success is not because of them but simply because of digitalisation and globalisation. Microsoft itself hasn't created any relevant competitive value. They are just a big political entity in the right time and place. If something changes for them it will also change for SAP Oracle IBM etc. But they appear to be different because of hardware and games (more consumer) and Bill Gates always spent a lot on his PR.",

That's the period airline stocks were doing great (and he had a bunch of them).\n\nHe also sold IBM when at the end of 2019 when the stock hit its low.  Since then it recovered just to get hit again with COVID-19.  Currently, it's at the same level back in 2019.\n\nThis time,  I am betting that he's wrong.   I don't think the Fed would let a market segment that frequency talked about to go under.   The Fed and Trump won't let their $$$ that went into the airliners bailout package vaporize.  \n\nThe Fed will see their initial loan repaid even at the cost of dumping billion more in grant into the airliners. - Whatever it costs - is the stand the Fed is holding right now.
