Both of these companies make the float glass, temper it, and then put it in laminated frames. They they sell this glass to companies like JELD that puts it in framesand then sells it to the consumer for residential projects. For larger projects contractors buy this glass to put it in buildings they are building.\n\nPPG doesn't even make glass anymore. They only make paint. Their glass sector looks like it was bought by Vitro and is traded on MXN.\n\nYou literally have corning in there. They make specialty glass as in glass that does not go in commercial or residential buildings.",

I sold out of my positions last Thursday to pay off the margin call, and I\u2019m restricted until I can deposit the actual amount into my account. One of my positions I sold was a bunch of GLW 24c that I had bought at 0.11 and sold at 0.5. On Friday those calls dropped down to 0.22. I wanted to buy back in but I couldn\u2019t. Now they\u2019re at over 0.6. If I hadn\u2019t been so stupid I could\u2019ve already tripled my money. Instead I\u2019m sitting in cash, unable to buy, shedding a tear for missed tendies.",

And as that Chinese electric car company grew and took 1/3 of the 1 billion person Chinese market, my ETF kept buying more on the way up.\"\n\nAlthough in that same vein, getting ahead of the tech curve might be one of the few ways for someone outside of the professional investor/institutional world to realistically get ahead. The trick is having the fortitude to hold for 1-2 decades. The financial crisis in '08 blew me out of so many hilariously good positions, like SBAC because the iPhone was just invented and 3G means more cell phone towers... It's not always rocket science. Anyone with some specialized insight into the future, whatever it may be, should consider putting a small well thought out speculative position on and leave it be. Small enough to not hurt if it goes nowhere, but big enough to care enough to check up and manage every few months.\n\nWow, just looked up an email from over 10 years ago. These names are probably in the mainstream investing language now, but wow... 10-100x if they were held. And it wasn't complex quant investing or anything, just looking ahead, positioning, and waiting.\n\nQuotes from the email circa 10 years ago: \"NVDA... They are also making a leap into scientific computing, where there's a lot of money to be made. They're the first major player to enter that arena to fight Intel and AMD in a long time, and their architecture is much more suited to scientific computing than the traditional CPUs that currently rule the top 100 supercomputer list. I think I'll see how that works out before selling NVDA\"\n\n\"I might want to put some money in AMD as well. They're here to stay and may still be undervalued...\"\n\n\"Universal Display Corp and LG Display (PANL/LPL) are also the leaders and partners in OLED screen development, which is bound to catch on eventually. Lower power use and much better image quality mean that it's just a matter of time before more devices adopt this new display technology and it becomes a new standard. I actually expect Apple to eventually partner up with LG (I think LG is their main LCD supplier) and use and use an OLED display on either a new product or a new Iphone version, which will kick OLED production into overdrive.\"\n\nFood for thought... MicroLED is likely going to grow 1000x over the coming decades. AR and LIDAR sensors for AR will probably not just be used for face unlock and will get some killer apps, the next Snapchat or TikTok might be AR based. Self-Driving is going to be powered by thousands of companies, not just NVIDIA and Waymo. Quantum computing? AI providers in the military contracting space? Clean cargo ship tech to get in front of green regulations? It's endless, and so many people know about these little niches of information that very few others do. Even mundane spaces see world changing innovation every day. Getting in front of a curve is inherently speculative but it is also entertaining, educational to follow through development, and can be extremely profitable.\n\nThat's my appeal for pulling a few pennies out of the ETF pile and doing some a little different, especially if you have a \"wheelhouse\" that you know a little bit more about.",

So if people can't find much besides a \"short the shit out of this company\" report, it might be more important for management to attempt to keep the stock afloat, whether it's in their own self interest or not.\n\nIf you try to short Intel it's a bit of a different story considering there are 40 analysts covering it and an ungodly amount of brand recognition. If one analyst comes out with a short and 39 say Intel is fine, it's unlikely the short piece actually does anything. But if you have three analysts covering you, which is very common for small-cap companies, one short piece can actually fuck your shit up. \n\nAlso since companies often use their equity as collateral for a loan, the higher stock price could afford more reasonable loan terms, which could help the company's actual business.",
