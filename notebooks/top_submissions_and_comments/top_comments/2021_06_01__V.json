Get enough of it so you can start writing weeklies (probably a few hundred is where I like to start so fees don't kill your weekly profitability), monthlies, whatever premium is best for you.\n\n2. If it goes up, you get exercised and win. You can re-buy back in at the elevated share price if you want, and restart your premium gathering again, OR shift the winnings over to another stock you like that is down currently. (It's more about booking premiums on plays like this. Your entry and exit points become less relevant if you're immediately buying back in as long as the price hasn't skyrocketed. If it goes back down after you get exercised you win twice. Great!)\n\n3. If it goes down, as long as you believe in the fundamentals behind the stock, you can buy more, average down, and start new sub-positions. When I do this, I immediately write new CCs with the cheaper shares and track the premiums I earn vs. original share cost so I always know what my adjusted cost basis is. If it goes down further, you can buy back your original covered call and write a monthly to remain profitable.\n\nLots of plays here you can do. If you start to get a really big position you can hedge by buying puts so that if your stack value drops you win that way in return for a small portion of your premiums.\n\nDoes that help?\n\nAlso good watching if you're green:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsxmuQlNCKQ",

The comps are:\n\n* Warrants:\n   * AEVA: $3.50\n   * INVZ: $2.66\n   * OUST: $3.71\n   * CFAC: $1.65\n   * VLDR: $3.34\n   * LAZR: Called (traded $10+ one point if I recall correctly).\n* Commons:\n   * AEVA: $11.08\n   * INVZ: $10.32\n   * OUST: $12.89\n   * CFAC: $10.01\n   * VLDR: $10.98\n   * LAZR: $22.78\n\n2 . Quanergy was last valued at $2.1B pre-money in October 2018. Here is an excerpt on the deal: \"The company raised $175 million of Series C venture funding from G Squared, Manhattan Venture Partners, MicroVentures, Manhattan Venture Partners and Tower Equity on October 30, 2018, putting the company's pre-money valuation at $2.1 billion. Alisher Usmanov, Daimler, Reform Ventures, Canas Capital, Trans-Pacific Technology Fund and HOF Capital (New York) also participated in the round.\" So valuation at $1.1B has halved in 2.5 years. Likely not a great sign.\n\n3. Quanergy seems to be positioning itself as non-automotive LIDAR play - e.g. targeting infrastructure, airport security, logistics and as a lower-cost provider due to fewer number of required sensors in these applications. E.g. stuff like:\n\n* [https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210504005236/en/Quanergy-and-Digital-Mortar%E2%80%99s-Partnership-Brings-Advanced-LiDAR-based-Retail-Analytics-Covering-the-Entire-Shoppers%E2%80%99-Journey-for-Retail-and-Smart-Spaces](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210504005236/en/Quanergy-and-Digital-Mortar%E2%80%99s-Partnership-Brings-Advanced-LiDAR-based-Retail-Analytics-Covering-the-Entire-Shoppers%E2%80%99-Journey-for-Retail-and-Smart-Spaces)\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBNOY30BOCA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBNOY30BOCA)\n\nConclusion: Even if Quanergy is lower quality (probably the case given large valuation contraction), I think warrants below $1.40 is undervalued considering comp average are $3. Don't think commons break $10. At first glance of course, need to see DA and investor deck.",

        "body": "Thanks for your question. There are a number of ways in which we are very different, and the differences are really significant. First and foremost, Payoneer was custom-built for business to business transactions, while Paypal focuses primarily on consumer to business payments.   This means our infrastructure and pricing are targeted at bigger transactions at lower price points while Paypal is essentially built around consumer credit card infrastructure and pricing, which is too high for B2B.  Secondly, one of our key areas of focus and strength lies in our global breadth, including our focus on emerging markets \u2013 no other company really has the reach that Payoneer does. While some companies avoid emerging markets or shy away from geographies seen as higher risk, Payoneer\u2019s mission has always been to be a global partner for businesses from everywhere in the world, and here we really stand out in the industry.  We\u2019re excited to have built a branded global platform that is similar to Paypal in some ways, but focuses on the very large and very different B2B segment of the market.    \r  \n\r  \nIt\u2019s also important to keep in mind these aren\u2019t \u201cwinner take all\u201d markets that Payoneer and Paypal operate in.  Paypal largely competes in the market for consumer payments.  This market supports something like $1 trillion of market capitalization with companies like Visa, MC, Square, Adyen, Fiserv, FIS, Stripe and more.  It\u2019s a huge market with lots of winners.  We see ourselves as part of a group of companies that are opening up B2B payments globally, which is estimated at something like $100 trillion of volume each year.  Much like consumer payments, there is room for many winners and lots of value to be created for investors in the years to come from the digitalization of B2B commerce and payments.   We think we\u2019re really well-positioned as a pioneer in this market with some really unique assets and are excited about our future.",

[Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eqqCwhPlyU)'s his presentation at a PRI conference. Tl;rw is basicaly what I said in the first comment- when Brad was trading for Royal Bank of Canada starting from 2007 he was only able to get a fraction of the shares he saw offers for. It turns out his order first arrived at BATS echange, then Direct Edge, then NASDAQ, then NYSE. When his order arrived at BATS high-frequency traders raced his orders to 1) cancel their sell order on the following exchanges and then buy up the shares offered there. They were faster than him, because they had a goddamn underground tunnel dug up in a straight line to those exchanges with fiber cables to send their orders in less than 0.5 ms. Then they would just try to sell them to him at a higher price.\n\nThe shit that's going on in the stock market is frankly just disgusting and bilions upon bilions of dollars are just drained from pockets of people every year without them ever noticing it. That's what the r/Superstonk community has found out through the GME saga and we want to raise awareness about this in the public. Wall Street is robbing everyday people and frankly, the United States as a country. Same shit's probably going down in many other countries, although US gotta be among the worst regulated ones.\n\nedit: if you want some more, you can watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkkQkMlaZpc) interview with Michael Lewis, author of the book \"Flash Boys\", which is about Brad Katsuyama and HFTs.
