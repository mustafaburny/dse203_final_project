Get enough of it so you can start writing weeklies (probably a few hundred is where I like to start so fees don't kill your weekly profitability), monthlies, whatever premium is best for you.\n\n2. If it goes up, you get exercised and win. You can re-buy back in at the elevated share price if you want, and restart your premium gathering again, OR shift the winnings over to another stock you like that is down currently. (It's more about booking premiums on plays like this. Your entry and exit points become less relevant if you're immediately buying back in as long as the price hasn't skyrocketed. If it goes back down after you get exercised you win twice. Great!)\n\n3. If it goes down, as long as you believe in the fundamentals behind the stock, you can buy more, average down, and start new sub-positions. When I do this, I immediately write new CCs with the cheaper shares and track the premiums I earn vs. original share cost so I always know what my adjusted cost basis is. If it goes down further, you can buy back your original covered call and write a monthly to remain profitable.\n\nLots of plays here you can do. If you start to get a really big position you can hedge by buying puts so that if your stack value drops you win that way in return for a small portion of your premiums.\n\nDoes that help?\n\nAlso good watching if you're green:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsxmuQlNCKQ",

        "body": "My thoughts:\n\n1 . Warrants on other LIDAR firms are trading very well and even if CCAC trades at a large discount, the warrants should trade higher. The comps are:\n\n* Warrants:\n   * AEVA: $3.50\n   * INVZ: $2.66\n   * OUST: $3.71\n   * CFAC: $1.65\n   * VLDR: $3.34\n   * LAZR: Called (traded $10+ one point if I recall correctly).\n* Commons:\n   * AEVA: $11.08\n   * INVZ: $10.32\n   * OUST: $12.89\n   * CFAC: $10.01\n   * VLDR: $10.98\n   * LAZR: $22.78\n\n2 . Quanergy was last valued at $2.1B pre-money in October 2018. Here is an excerpt on the deal: \"The company raised $175 million of Series C venture funding from G Squared, Manhattan Venture Partners, MicroVentures, Manhattan Venture Partners and Tower Equity on October 30, 2018, putting the company's pre-money valuation at $2.1 billion. Alisher Usmanov, Daimler, Reform Ventures, Canas Capital, Trans-Pacific Technology Fund and HOF Capital (New York) also participated in the round.\" So valuation at $1.1B has halved in 2.5 years. Likely not a great sign.\n\n3. Quanergy seems to be positioning itself as non-automotive LIDAR play - e.g. targeting infrastructure, airport security, logistics and as a lower-cost provider due to fewer number of required sensors in these applications. E.g. stuff like:\n\n* [https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210504005236/en/Quanergy-and-Digital-Mortar%E2%80%99s-Partnership-Brings-Advanced-LiDAR-based-Retail-Analytics-Covering-the-Entire-Shoppers%E2%80%99-Journey-for-Retail-and-Smart-Spaces](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210504005236/en/Quanergy-and-Digital-Mortar%E2%80%99s-Partnership-Brings-Advanced-LiDAR-based-Retail-Analytics-Covering-the-Entire-Shoppers%E2%80%99-Journey-for-Retail-and-Smart-Spaces)\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBNOY30BOCA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBNOY30BOCA)\n\nConclusion: Even if Quanergy is lower quality (probably the case given large valuation contraction), I think warrants below $1.40 is undervalued considering comp average are $3. Don't think commons break $10. At first glance of course, need to see DA and investor deck.",

That according to Article. 102 of the Constitution of the Republic, the State is obliged to promote and protect private enterprise, generating the necessary conditions for it to grow national wealth in the benefit of the largest number of citizens.\n\nII. That under Legislative Decree No. 201, published in Official Gazette number 241, Volume 349, dated December 22, 2000, the United States of America dollar was adopted as legal tender.\n\nIII.

That according to the previous considerations, it is essential to issue the basic rules that regulate the legal course of bitcoin.\n\nArticle 1. The purpose of this law is to regulate bitcoin as legal tender, unrestricted with liberating power, unlimited in any transaction and to any title that public or private natural or legal persons want to carry out.\n\nWhat is mentioned in the previous paragraph is without prejudice to the application of the Monetary Integration Law.\n\nArticle 2.

The State will promote the necessary training and mechanisms so that the population can access bitcoin transactions.\n\nArticle 9. The limitations and operation of the alternatives of automatic and instantaneous conversion from bitcoin to dollar provided by the State will be specified in the Refunding issued for this purpose.\n\nArticle 10.

They are excluded from the obligation expressed in article 7 of this law, who by notorious fact and obviously do not have access to the technologies that allow to execute transactions in bitcoin. The State will promote the necessary training and mechanisms so that the population can access bitcoin transactions.\n\nArticle 13. All obligations in money expressed in dollars, existing prior to the effective date of this law, may be paid in bitcoin.\n\nArticle 14. Before the entry into force of this law, the State will guarantee, through the creation of the trust in the development bank of El Salvador (BANDESAL), the automatic and instantaneous convertibility to dollars of the alternatives provided by the State mentioned in the Article 8.\n\nArticle 15. This law will have a special character in its application with respect to other laws that regulate the matter, being repealed any provision that contradicts it.\n\nArticle 16.

I then proceeded to not sell during the epic V shape recovery like a true retarded ape and for the first time experienced the massive dick of jpowell and i ended up losing it all, all the way down to -$22K. lol yes I even used margin despite not knowing shit. \n\nI slowly grew my account with just shares and no options to about \\~$14k over the next five months all while watching hours and hours of youtube videos on technical analysis. I truly think learning TA was a game changer for me personally. \n\nThen, out of the blue, the startup I have been working at for the past six years got acquired by a public company October of last year. I couldn't believe it. Surreal. Totally unexpected. From that liquidity event, I was able to invest $380K back in October 2020 into my RH account. \n\nI know that's not as impressive as growing an account into the millions from a couple thousand but hey, cheers everybody!",

        "body": "Thanks for your question. There are a number of ways in which we are very different, and the differences are really significant. First and foremost, Payoneer was custom-built for business to business transactions, while Paypal focuses primarily on consumer to business payments.   This means our infrastructure and pricing are targeted at bigger transactions at lower price points while Paypal is essentially built around consumer credit card infrastructure and pricing, which is too high for B2B.  Secondly, one of our key areas of focus and strength lies in our global breadth, including our focus on emerging markets \u2013 no other company really has the reach that Payoneer does. While some companies avoid emerging markets or shy away from geographies seen as higher risk, Payoneer\u2019s mission has always been to be a global partner for businesses from everywhere in the world, and here we really stand out in the industry.  We\u2019re excited to have built a branded global platform that is similar to Paypal in some ways, but focuses on the very large and very different B2B segment of the market.    \r  \n\r  \nIt\u2019s also important to keep in mind these aren\u2019t \u201cwinner take all\u201d markets that Payoneer and Paypal operate in.  Paypal largely competes in the market for consumer payments.  This market supports something like $1 trillion of market capitalization with companies like Visa, MC, Square, Adyen, Fiserv, FIS, Stripe and more.  It\u2019s a huge market with lots of winners.  We see ourselves as part of a group of companies that are opening up B2B payments globally, which is estimated at something like $100 trillion of volume each year.  Much like consumer payments, there is room for many winners and lots of value to be created for investors in the years to come from the digitalization of B2B commerce and payments.   We think we\u2019re really well-positioned as a pioneer in this market with some really unique assets and are excited about our future.",
