I personally had to buy a desk and clear out a space in the basement because all of our bedrooms are occupied by children. Once I\u2019m set up I\u2019m to bring my work rig (custom built machine made to run a bunch of AutoDesk software) home and VPN to the servers at work. I serve a critical role at my company as I am the only one authorized to set up or update project sheets or backgrounds in AutoCAD. I am very optimistic to our success through this. I have several months of work lined up for me that can\u2019t really be interrupted. Contracts are signed, bonds are voter-approved, work is going to get done. A year from now, who knows. But I\u2019ve been with my place for 15+ years. They hss as be been good to my family and I at every juncture in our lives. My sentiment for the future is still quite strong.",

Microsoft on the other hand, missed several technology transitions and came back last decade. While yes, they participated in the SaaS transition, that was one of many strategic changes Satya Nadella enacted when he took the helm.\n\nI see the SaaS transition as secular rather than company-specific driver. From my perspective, Adobe's primary competitive threat was piracy, but that was an industry-wide phenomenon (particularly in software and music) and not unique to the company. I'd say both of these industries as a whole came back due to the SaaS transition. You could literally pick any leading software company in 2013-2016 and watch as they reclaimed profits from piracy during this transition. Some that are transitioning later, like Autodesk, are going through that now. You could also argue that Universal, Warner, and Sony regained their competitive advantage, but it is actually Apple (via Apple Music) that participated in the SaaS transition (Spotify was SaaS only).",

A year ago they had no viable offerings for a good CPU (fx was dated af and not a contender, dont tell me about the fx series as an offering) and their best GPUs were weaker and not as cost effective as nVidias. The best they had was low to medium performance options for both markets. This has been their position with respect of Intel and nVidia for a long time. Now their CPUs are king and their GPUs are competitive, even lacking a flagship as powerful as the 2080 or 2080ti. \n\nThey have rapidly transitioned from a sustained underdog position to a real tooth and nail competitor. If we assume that this trend will continue does it not stand to reason that their share price should also continue to perform as they seize a greater market share?\n\nThis of course says nothing about server and console hardware, which im less familiar with but i hear they're doing well in those sectors as well.",

AMD's limited research budget has been mostly focused on their CPU technology, as it should be, so it's going to take longer for them to catch up with nVidia, if they can at all.",

Possibly garnished a lot more as I def don't need $15k/mo to maintain my lifestyle.

They don't even need to have one every day. They could just have it every other day and give important updates, take a few questions, and be done\n\nSecond, the longer he talked today the worse it got. It's like he was just rambling on, and eventually as he kept getting asked more and more stuff, he just started either repeating things, or coming up with something dumb to say\n\nThird, I've watched every press conference, and half the stuff he was saying came straight out of left field. What happened to his serious tone of we are going to do what it takes and pull together and get through this? Now all of a sudden he acts like it's over, when we haven't even gotten into the worst part of it here. Like where the fuck did this come from?\n\nI agree the economy is important and we can't just let it tank bc of this virus, but we are not going to be ready to open back up in 1 week. We need at least 2-3 more weeks, and probably a month before we are ready to slowly start lifting restrictions in specific areas. He shouldn't be saying shit like we are going to open up next week, because he doesn't know that. He should have just said that in a week they would evaluate where we are. But they should do that every day. He shouldn't be expecting us to open up in a week, and he definitely shouldn't be telling the American people that we might. He's putting it in people's heads that we are almost through this, and this is the worst possible time for him to say that. Now is the most crucial time for us to be cracking down and stopping the spread. People need to take it seriously right now so that it isn't a problem later, and it's like he doesn't understand that.",
