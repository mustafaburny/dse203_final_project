        "body": "valid point, but I think the world is in a much different place now compared to then. The tech explosion has happened and Apple has been at the forefront since, plus there are BILLIONS of people loyal and carrying the Apple product(s) in their pockets daily. I just can't see a way Apple disappears like IBM did (bet people then said that about IBM too lol)...I just feel like if Apple ever went to shit, it would be after AT LEAST 5 years of owning it and by then you'd see a trend (because I would not be buying their products anymore)...and in the meantime would have probably already doubles my month. Just thinking out loud...also I think '90s data on this is a bit skewed because the average person didn't interact with their products like they do now. Maybe I am just pissed at myself for not throwing a grand into their stock 20 years ago when I bought my first iphone lol",
