So, after losing 50% of portfolio then I stopped the weeklies.\nNow, I only trade in growth companies after reseraching. I follow four rules mostly:\n\n1. High growth companies (usually have high IV as well) - I have leaps for PLTR, NIO, XPEV,SKLZ, SQ, MVIS, ABNB etc.( had DKNG, SE,RIOT and JMIA but sold too early yet made goos money)\n\n2. ER corrected companies- I buy leaps for those companies which have good performance but got corrected. Like EHTH, QCOM,AMD, CRM,U,UNH, ANTM, ENPH.\n\n3. Companies which have been consolidation phase- NVDA, CRM since,  I can't time them well so I buy longer period calls and IV is relatively low so they price not that bad for me.\n\n4. Upcoming trends: like currently semi conductors shortages so i bought TSM, TER, AMD, QCOM and NVDA are also in that sector. Also, traditional internal combustion engine companies like GM and Ford making headlines on Ev  and current initiatives are making me bullish on that so I have been buying their leaps too. I missed the TSLA train but I dont want to miss others.\n\nLeaps give me 70%-80% success rate in this bullish market. It may not give very fast returns but helps me focus on my full time job give me less stress than short term trades.\n\nSorry for the long message.",

In researching to install solar at the house, one of the big problems with solar arrays (when you don't live in a flat, open area) is that production is drops to the level of the lowest producing panel in the array. That big tree at the corner of my property starts throwing some shade on the array, all of those panels in full sun are slacking. Enphase makes \"micro-inverters\" which allow each panel to operate independently. Their product makes the solar installation a little more expensive on a per-panel basis. In non-ideal solar areas (like where I live), though, the price per kWh produced is better -- or, more accurately, I can produce the power I need with fewer panels (less space AND less money). I expect additional federal incentives either this year or next, so anticipate an increase in residential solar installations. And I'm hoping growth in residential solar installations in places that aren't wide open, flat, super sunny locations drive micro-inverter sales.",

SPWR makes panels with ENPH micros built in - ENPH is the provider for these. So don't be surprised if good earnings for ENPH reflects in upward momentum for SPWR and vice versa.

So, after losing 50% of portfolio then I stopped the weeklies.\nNow, I only trade in growth companies after reseraching. I follow four rules mostly:\n\n1. High growth companies (usually have high IV as well) - I have leaps for PLTR, NIO, XPEV,SKLZ, SQ, MVIS, ABNB etc.( had DKNG, SE,RIOT and JMIA but sold too early yet made goos money)\n\n2. ER corrected companies- I buy leaps for those companies which have good performance but got corrected. Like EHTH, QCOM,AMD, CRM,U,UNH, ANTM, ENPH.\n\n3. Companies which have been consolidation phase- NVDA, CRM since,  I can't time them well so I buy longer period calls and IV is relatively low so they price not that bad for me.\n\n4. Upcoming trends: like currently semi conductors shortages so i bought TSM, TER, AMD, QCOM and NVDA are also in that sector. Also, traditional internal combustion engine companies like GM and Ford making headlines on Ev  and current initiatives are making me bullish on that so I have been buying their leaps too. I missed the TSLA train but I dont want to miss others.\n\nLeaps give me 70%-80% success rate in this bullish market. It may not give very fast returns but helps me focus on my full time job give me less stress than short term trades.\n\nSorry for the long message.",

In researching to install solar at the house, one of the big problems with solar arrays (when you don't live in a flat, open area) is that production is drops to the level of the lowest producing panel in the array. That big tree at the corner of my property starts throwing some shade on the array, all of those panels in full sun are slacking. Enphase makes \"micro-inverters\" which allow each panel to operate independently. Their product makes the solar installation a little more expensive on a per-panel basis. In non-ideal solar areas (like where I live), though, the price per kWh produced is better -- or, more accurately, I can produce the power I need with fewer panels (less space AND less money). I expect additional federal incentives either this year or next, so anticipate an increase in residential solar installations. And I'm hoping growth in residential solar installations in places that aren't wide open, flat, super sunny locations drive micro-inverter sales.",

Enph has patented all the magic tricks that makes their micros tick and they are coming after commercial installs next (iq8D). Their brain trust is grade A and is continually iterating and improving.  Also, SPWR owns a large chunk of ENPH shares still as part of an agreement when ENPH was restructuring. SPWR makes panels with ENPH micros built in - ENPH is the provider for these. So don't be surprised if good earnings for ENPH reflects in upward momentum for SPWR and vice versa.  Also of note - SI on SPWR is enormous right now. If the market likes this quarter it's not gonna be pretty for the bears. \n\nSource: I yolo'd approx 50k on ENPH about 2 years ago because I understood the tech (BSEE) and it's still my biggest position.

Now review all your lists, maybe after market close, but look for categories that are mostly red. Thats how you ID hot and cold sectors. As for finding undervalued companies, that's the part that involves homework. I will often identify a handful of worst performers, try to see if it's based on news, poor earnings, poor sentiment, etc. Go through the financials. Learning about balance sheets is key here, and its not very hard... Not as fun, but if you ID a good company thats undervalued, it will pay to buy and hold.
