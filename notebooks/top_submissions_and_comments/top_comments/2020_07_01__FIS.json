        "body": "Some relevant points for interested potential investors:\n\n- this is an OTC stock which means 1) there is no pre-market trading and 2) you cannot trade it on Robinhood. You will need to use another broker, like eTrade, Fidelity, etc. to purchase this stock. \n\n- this is going to open up tomorrow with a gigantic spike UNLESS news comes out in PM that somehow nullifies the expected reverse merger. Such news is unlikely at this point. \n\n- \u201cbuy the rumor, sell the news\u201d is excellent advice for penny stocks, but does not really apply here. If you\u2019ve followed this sub closely the last several weeks, you\u2019ve undoubtedly seen PASO mentioned numerous times, but it\u2019s never been a \u2018pump\u2019 stock so to speak, like IDEX, SOLO, GNUS, XSPA, IZEA, BIOC, BYFC, NBRV... the list goes on. This is largely due to its status as an OTC, but also because a gag order has been in place to outlaw any PR about the upcoming deal, therefore stifling any solid catalysts and subsequent short-term trader enthusiasm. This is not something penny stocks do; this is what huge companies (like the $50B company handling this merger) do. \n\n- so how tf does PASO play into this? Essentially, they\u2019re a shell. CLX has been openly wanting to go public for some time now. The easiest way to go public without filing a separate IPO is an RM with a partnered, joint venture company who is already trading on the market. Hence the letter of intent (LOI) explicitly stating CLX\u2019s intentions to merge with PASO. \n\n- I\u2019m always a proponent of selling before news with pennies, simply because the rumor is almost ALWAYS more valuable than the news itself. Personally I believe this one to be different. You see on this sub, and others, tons of posts saying \u2018this is a great long term hold\u2019, and I hope most are right, but it\u2019s highly unlikely. To me, this scenario looks like a similar type of deal as NKLA, going from ~$15 to $30, then $80s not much later. PTs I\u2019m seeing are 0.3 (2.3x of 7/14 closing price), but that was before the news that TRU is involved. \n\nOpen disclaimer: I own 9000 @ 0.114\n\nAs always, good luck to everyone, and may the stock winds be ever in your favor.",

        "body": "I realize that most people here are very new to investing and tend to think that's an accurate statement, so I'm sure there's going to be plenty of angry comments in my inbox after this, but that isn't remotely true. \n\nCommissions have been steadily declining since May day in 1975 with the removal of the price fixing requirements.  Reaching zero was a logical endpoint, they'd fallen from nearly $40-60 per trade in the 70s down to $20 in the 90s, $10 in the 00's, and sub $5 all well before Robinhood was a thing.  Charles Schwab(the person) had said his eventual goal was to get commissions down to 0 decades ago. \n\nAnd frankly Robinhood's model doesn't work.  It's not a profitable company.  There had been zero commission brokers before and they all failed as well because nobody figured out how to make it sustainable - from that standpoint Schwab and Fidelity have really lead the way in changing the brokerage platform to one that can sustain profits from things like fund management and NIM without the need to push commissions.  The entire reason why the TD deal happened is because they weren't ready for zero commissions and everyone else was.  RH can continue to burn VC cash for a while so it's of little consequence to them but let's not pretend like Schwab, Vanguard, and Fidelity have been shifting their revenue streams for decades towards management fees and NIM because of a broker that just started.  \n  \nAlso, to be quite frank, Robinhood largely caters to a trader that isn't profitable for most brokers.  They hold low amounts of cash but trade often and don't care about spreads much - this is how they're able to generate significantly more cashflow from order flow than other firms.  \n\nCrediting robinhood with creating the current commission environment basically ignores everything that's happened in securities regulation and brokerage structure from the 70s till today and instead just presumes that there wasn't already downward trajectory in fees prior to like 2016.  I get that people who just started investing in the last few years, likely with Robinhood, might not be aware of all of these things so there's that, but IMO it's somewhat absurd to credit them here.  It's like saying they were the reason your team won the game when they showed up to the stadium with 2 minutes left, and made a field goal while your team was already up by four touchdowns.  The only way you could think that is if you only turned the game on with a minute and a half left.",

The next thing is to use low-cost index funds like through Vanguard Schwab or Fidelity.  Etfs  like VTI, SCHB,for domestic and VXUS, SCHF for international.  Studies say you do better when you go all-in rather than timing the market but I'm too risk-averse, I've always been.  What I would probably do is gradually dollar cost average into the market over a period of time. Kind of like you do what with your company 401K when you are contributing a little bit each paycheck.  For instance if you had $20 to 30,000 I would want to average in over 12 months you would put 1/12 each month into the market. Personally I feel the market is  being manipulated by fed policy and there's  \"irrational exuberance\" in the market so I believe the market will correct in 3-12 mo's. Read up about the three or four fund / ETF portfolio. It keeps it simple. if you want to be more speculative I would use 5% of your investments to buy individual stocks, gold, silver,  etc but not expose the majority of your holdings. Bogleheads.com is a good site where most of the participants believe in indexing, low-cost, and not timing the market. I think Warren Buffett said that investing should be about as boring as watching grass grow.I'm telling you what I would tell my own children. Good luck. You have time on your side. Try not to let worry, fear, greed, pride , ego control your investment decisions. If it sounds too good to be true it probably is. Hope this helps Dutch.",

I feel like it's going to be $430 in a month, or close to it, 425 at least.. I don't have enough money to cover a naked call though, and I know shit about Greeks, because I'm not gay. Or is it I don't know anything about being gay, because I'm not Greek. \n  \nAnyway, I'm holding AAPLs atm.",

I legit would not hold most pennies long term unless my research pans out and they look undervalued. Most pennies run on hype and will crash hard after the sell off.

From what I\u2019ve heard from Schwab themselves, the robo-advisors make a real difference against tax loss harvesting and essentially building your own personal ETF. That\u2019s why the advertised robo products require like 100k or more. You have to have cash so the algorithm can re-balance and/or rotate when necessary.\n\nGiven the comparison expense ratios, Id stick with Vanguard, Schwab, Fidelity, BlackRock ETFs. For example, Vanguard\u2019s funds are straightforward to comprehend and their website explains performance and holdings quite well. Just as a comparison: Vanguard\u2019s VOO (s&amp;p500), VTI (all USA), VT (all world), VUG or MGK (growth), VIG (dividend), and sector-specific products are all solid for 3k total. Could split your money across multiple funds. Likewise, QQQ (growth) is one of the best performing ETFs out there and only has an expense ratio of .20%.",

        "body": "Found an article by Syntegon, dated June 8, that adds some color on the potential market size for glass vials and many useful tidbits on Corning\u2019s Valor glass. \n\nGLW previously stated the firm \u201cexpect[s] ultimate annual sales to match our cumulative investment level, which could be as much as $4 billion\u201d w.r.t. Valor glass. Same Corning update suggested that this sales levels would materialize upon the product\u2019s \u201csuccessful adoption\u201d by the market. Reasonably likely that demand from clinical trials and production of Covid vaccine/treatments alone would be sufficient to satisfy the threshold for \u201csuccessful adoption\u201d if not more; not surprising per se, covid is merely a catalyst. If true, then the marginal contribution of Valor sales to the bottom line will be substantial.\n\nLinks to referenced sources:\n\n [Pharmaceutical Glass Packaging 2017](https://s22.q4cdn.com/662497847/files/doc_news/disclosure/valor_FAQ.pdf)\n\n[Examining Supply Chain Risk For Pandemic Preparedness](https://pharmablog.syntegon.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2020/06/whitepaper-Corning-Valor.pdf)",
