        "body": "Some relevant points for interested potential investors:\n\n- this is an OTC stock which means 1) there is no pre-market trading and 2) you cannot trade it on Robinhood. You will need to use another broker, like eTrade, Fidelity, etc. to purchase this stock. \n\n- this is going to open up tomorrow with a gigantic spike UNLESS news comes out in PM that somehow nullifies the expected reverse merger. Such news is unlikely at this point. \n\n- \u201cbuy the rumor, sell the news\u201d is excellent advice for penny stocks, but does not really apply here. If you\u2019ve followed this sub closely the last several weeks, you\u2019ve undoubtedly seen PASO mentioned numerous times, but it\u2019s never been a \u2018pump\u2019 stock so to speak, like IDEX, SOLO, GNUS, XSPA, IZEA, BIOC, BYFC, NBRV... the list goes on. This is largely due to its status as an OTC, but also because a gag order has been in place to outlaw any PR about the upcoming deal, therefore stifling any solid catalysts and subsequent short-term trader enthusiasm. This is not something penny stocks do; this is what huge companies (like the $50B company handling this merger) do. \n\n- so how tf does PASO play into this? Essentially, they\u2019re a shell. CLX has been openly wanting to go public for some time now. The easiest way to go public without filing a separate IPO is an RM with a partnered, joint venture company who is already trading on the market. Hence the letter of intent (LOI) explicitly stating CLX\u2019s intentions to merge with PASO. \n\n- I\u2019m always a proponent of selling before news with pennies, simply because the rumor is almost ALWAYS more valuable than the news itself. Personally I believe this one to be different. You see on this sub, and others, tons of posts saying \u2018this is a great long term hold\u2019, and I hope most are right, but it\u2019s highly unlikely. To me, this scenario looks like a similar type of deal as NKLA, going from ~$15 to $30, then $80s not much later. PTs I\u2019m seeing are 0.3 (2.3x of 7/14 closing price), but that was before the news that TRU is involved. \n\nOpen disclaimer: I own 9000 @ 0.114\n\nAs always, good luck to everyone, and may the stock winds be ever in your favor.",

        "body": "I realize that most people here are very new to investing and tend to think that's an accurate statement, so I'm sure there's going to be plenty of angry comments in my inbox after this, but that isn't remotely true. \n\nCommissions have been steadily declining since May day in 1975 with the removal of the price fixing requirements.  Reaching zero was a logical endpoint, they'd fallen from nearly $40-60 per trade in the 70s down to $20 in the 90s, $10 in the 00's, and sub $5 all well before Robinhood was a thing.  Charles Schwab(the person) had said his eventual goal was to get commissions down to 0 decades ago. \n\nAnd frankly Robinhood's model doesn't work.  It's not a profitable company.  There had been zero commission brokers before and they all failed as well because nobody figured out how to make it sustainable - from that standpoint Schwab and Fidelity have really lead the way in changing the brokerage platform to one that can sustain profits from things like fund management and NIM without the need to push commissions.  The entire reason why the TD deal happened is because they weren't ready for zero commissions and everyone else was.  RH can continue to burn VC cash for a while so it's of little consequence to them but let's not pretend like Schwab, Vanguard, and Fidelity have been shifting their revenue streams for decades towards management fees and NIM because of a broker that just started.  \n  \nAlso, to be quite frank, Robinhood largely caters to a trader that isn't profitable for most brokers.  They hold low amounts of cash but trade often and don't care about spreads much - this is how they're able to generate significantly more cashflow from order flow than other firms.  \n\nCrediting robinhood with creating the current commission environment basically ignores everything that's happened in securities regulation and brokerage structure from the 70s till today and instead just presumes that there wasn't already downward trajectory in fees prior to like 2016.  I get that people who just started investing in the last few years, likely with Robinhood, might not be aware of all of these things so there's that, but IMO it's somewhat absurd to credit them here.  It's like saying they were the reason your team won the game when they showed up to the stadium with 2 minutes left, and made a field goal while your team was already up by four touchdowns.  The only way you could think that is if you only turned the game on with a minute and a half left.",

The next thing is to use low-cost index funds like through Vanguard Schwab or Fidelity.  Etfs  like VTI, SCHB,for domestic and VXUS, SCHF for international.  Studies say you do better when you go all-in rather than timing the market but I'm too risk-averse, I've always been.  What I would probably do is gradually dollar cost average into the market over a period of time. Kind of like you do what with your company 401K when you are contributing a little bit each paycheck.  For instance if you had $20 to 30,000 I would want to average in over 12 months you would put 1/12 each month into the market. Personally I feel the market is  being manipulated by fed policy and there's  \"irrational exuberance\" in the market so I believe the market will correct in 3-12 mo's. Read up about the three or four fund / ETF portfolio. It keeps it simple. if you want to be more speculative I would use 5% of your investments to buy individual stocks, gold, silver,  etc but not expose the majority of your holdings. Bogleheads.com is a good site where most of the participants believe in indexing, low-cost, and not timing the market. I think Warren Buffett said that investing should be about as boring as watching grass grow.I'm telling you what I would tell my own children. Good luck. You have time on your side. Try not to let worry, fear, greed, pride , ego control your investment decisions. If it sounds too good to be true it probably is. Hope this helps Dutch.",

Vanguard has been behind on the times for a while now and shows no signs of getting with it.\n\nWith all of the great brokerage account options out there, there's very little reason to use Vanguard. Don't get me wrong, I love the Vanguard funds, but you can access all of their ETFs in many other platforms. For example, you can literally buy fractional shares of Vanguard ETFs in Fidelity for no extra cost at the same expense ratio as you get in Vanguard.

Nonetheless, it\u2019s been pretty boring, trading around the $15-17 range but had 22% rev increase YoY and is possibly benefiting from covid as everyone\u2019s home and utility bills are up (my friends on island tell me their bills are way up). Mgmt bought shares at $14-$15 back at March lows (basically its 2-yr low). \n\nOn 7/7 at 9am, Janney Montgomery Scott announced its rating downgrade on the stock from Buy to NEUTRAL. At market open, the stock dumped from $15.50 to $13 bc of the downgrade, then continued to fall to $12 next day and closed at $12.50 yesterday. Janney \u201cexpert\u201d had no commentary on the \u201cdowngrade\u201d and haven\u2019t changed the rating in 3+ years. I also read all the recent ERs, Janney didn\u2019t ask a single fucking question on the calls. Yet it\u2019s still a \u201cbuy\u201d overall and a 9.2 equity scorecard on fidelity and trades cheap, w/ options volume.\n\nBasically this dumped ~20% near 2-yr lows based on an irrelevant analyst \u201cdowngrade\u201d (to neutral) with zero commentary. Spreads look wide but they filled cheap. I\u2019m long this company and buying cheaper than mgmt, $15c and $17.5c for it to rubber band back to range. It\u2019s extremely oversold.\n\nTLDR: CWCO calls or shares",

Shocking that young people didn't want to pay $9.95 per trade on a platform that was designed in the 80s and had little to no mobile integration. Hell, I had a Vanguard account only a few years ago and the whole site seemed like it was designed for people age 50+.\n\nLet's not forget RH was incredibly popular well before they ever introduced option trading. They just didn't grab any fear mongering headlines.",

        "body": "Honest answer: if 3k is a lot, opt for broad ETFs with low expense ratios from the big guys. From what I\u2019ve heard from Schwab themselves, the robo-advisors make a real difference against tax loss harvesting and essentially building your own personal ETF. That\u2019s why the advertised robo products require like 100k or more. You have to have cash so the algorithm can re-balance and/or rotate when necessary.\n\nGiven the comparison expense ratios, Id stick with Vanguard, Schwab, Fidelity, BlackRock ETFs. For example, Vanguard\u2019s funds are straightforward to comprehend and their website explains performance and holdings quite well. Just as a comparison: Vanguard\u2019s VOO (s&amp;p500), VTI (all USA), VT (all world), VUG or MGK (growth), VIG (dividend), and sector-specific products are all solid for 3k total. Could split your money across multiple funds. Likewise, QQQ (growth) is one of the best performing ETFs out there and only has an expense ratio of .20%.",

Every employee at Cisco was rich because they all got stock options (yes, including the janitors in those days) and the stock price had climbed from $10 in 98 to $33 in 99 and $79/sh in 2000. They did then sell and still do sell routers that were the backbone of the internet and CSCO was everyone's tech darling. I can't tell you how many Cisco employees had told me in spring of 2000 that they were not going to diversify until CSCO hit $100/sh. In Sept of 2001, their share price had dropped to $12/share. They still were the backbone of the internet but the internet and tech were no longer the darling of the Market. In Feb of 2009 they were at $14/sh and are today at $48/sh. So they today as an ongoing company still doing what it did and with a strong balance sheet are trading at roughly 2/3rds the price they were 20 years ago. That is what can happen to a really good tech company.\n\nBTW, CSCO is not the only one. Intel was at $74.88 in the fall of 2000 and is at $60/sh now and was running around in the $20's for most of the past 20 years. Still a great tech company doing great things.   And yes Intel employees also got rich on options.  I met with a Intel employee, a janitor, single, living in a trailer that was about to exercise $3 mm in net in the money INTC options and needed help with estate planning.   Those were the days.  A short edit:  In 2000 the estate tax began with only $675,000 of assets at death and it started just below 50% and quickly grew to 55%.   So you didn't need to be very wealthy to need estate tax planning.\n\nMicrosoft, one of today's tech darlings, was $50/sh in early 2000. It wandered around $25/share for 15 years until it again hit $50/sh in fall of 2015, fifteen long years later. The last 5 years have been good for it but will it stay at $200/sh?",

The people hyping up Tesla so much, are arguing that it's a tech company, even though it makes cars.\n\nThe big 5 (MSFT/AAPL/AMZN/FB/GOOG) are definitely solid companies.  That doesn't change the fact that they've gotten overvalued.  Apple has grown 2.5x in value the past few years, but revenues have slowed, and profits really haven't changed much.  \n\nBelow that top tier you have a bunch of unprofitable $100-300M companies that have gotten hyped up.  And simply comparing it to 2000 without reference is ignoring it.  Microsoft, Cisco, and Intel were top 10 companies and weren't the single product late 90's product that you focus on.  Cisco still lost 90% of it's value, and still isn't back up there.  Microsoft still took 16 years to recover it's lost market cap.  \n\nHow am I throwing a tantrum.  It's a fact that the only time that valuation compared to trailing earnings was higher was the dot com bubble, and near right before great depression, the only time that market cap was higher as a percentage of GDP was dot com bubble.  There's tons of comparables that suggest this market is overvalued, and absolutely 0 that it's undervalued compared to history.",

I don\u2019t think you can put it in the same box as Cisco or Intel, hardware companies focused on providing a single service. \n\nMSFT has greater market share in the broader tech sector than either of those companies because it has expanded vertically (across sub sectors, for example gaming, office software, web services, laptops/hardware) instead of trying to expand horizontally (within its own sub sector) and has plans to continue to do so via its cloud services. I personally do not know who will \u201cwin\u201d the cloud web services sub sector but I know that MSFT won\u2019t lose purely due to its advantage in existing office software (MS Office integrates well with devices like Azure and Sharepoint making it more appealing to companies exploring the cloud).\n\nI love your take regarding the cyclical nature of those speculator dollars, but I think MSFT should be compared to AAPL, AMZN, and GOOG instead of CSCO and Intel. Maybe Shopify is a better comp for CSCO and Intel?",

We'll have a more in depth DD post dropping soon, but for now I'll address your partnership comment.\n\nThose companies are listed on the \"Partners\" page of the OSS site and you cannot use the logo of or claim to be a partner of a major tech company without permission. Source, I worked for a start up and we were doing food safety tech through a company that served Google campus so we tried to put the Google logo on our site under partners and we got a serious slap on the wrist.\n\nNow to address the concerns about whether or not they are a partner or just compatible with their technology - yes, they are partners. Specifically using the HPC server technology, which is high performance computing, that is listed on that partners page in the small blurb. This would typically be some type of server rack with the PCIe backbone to have multiple processors or GPUs to do high performance computing of some variety for those companies listed such as Apple, Intel, etc. It may be crunching numbers for Apple Maps or maybe just for how many times the restrooms were cleaned across the Apple campus. We don't know. We just know they use the OSS HPC products at a large enough scale that they have approval to put them on the partners page.\n\nI hope that helps clear things up. Please be on the look out as we continue to publish more information that we find. Thanks and enjoy the rest of your weekend.",

This sounds like the parroting of a nonsensical idea that world's populous has permanently altered their habits (be it in the form of individual consumption or in business practices) in the last 4 months thus justifying the valuations of companies that were likely already trading at lofty sums pre-crash.\n\nThe \\*only\\* way you can justify this narrative is if you believe the world isn't heading into a deep recession for the next 1-3 years and that the new normal is simply a reorienting of pre-COVID level spending and consumption toward these few \"tech titans\".\n\nAs you continue to buy into this sand castle story of infinite tech growth, ask yourself...\n\nWhy Zoom's execs have been dumping their stock during it's COVID run?\n\nHas Apple sold more iPhones since March YOY (and will people have the disposable income to continue to buy Apple products for the next year)?\n\nIs NVIDIA really worth more than Intel now at 1/7th their revenues?\n\nIs Netflix, a company that isn't profitable, worth more today with the increasing competition in the streaming space?\n\nIs Shopify with an estimated PEG of above 20 (when anything above 1 is considered over valued) going to sustain it's current price with massive earnings while we're in the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression?\n\nFacebook losing it's biggest advertisers is bullish?\n\nAnd don't even get me started on Tesla... \\*bUt iT's a BaTtErY sTaRt-Up\\*\n\nIt's hard to believe so many people are justifying these company's valuations based on this idea that the companies themselves somehow represent the next major technological revolution.

        "body": "TL;DR AMD is currently the smaller competitor in CPUs vs Intel and GPUs vs Nvidia. But for various reasons AMD is set to dominate Intel and be much more competitive vs Nvidia in the next few years. That and AMD is just becoming profitable and has nearly paid off its debt, so P/E should improve a lot pretty fast.\n\n**CPU Context**\n\nTheir main competitor is Intel who for a long time have been the dominant force in CPU design and manufacture - at least for laptops, desktops and servers anyway. They had most of the market share (think 90% +) earning most of the revenue and most of the profit.\n\nIntel managed this because both their CPU architecture was superior to their competitors and their manufacturing capability was also significantly more advanced. Intel simply made a better product for a long time. In contrast in the mid 2010s AMD released a new CPU architecture called Bulldozer which was *terrible*. It was so bad it almost killed the company.\n\nBut Intel was badly mismanaged in recent years. Instead of continuing to invest heavily in R&amp;D to maintain their dominant position, they milked their customers by selling virtually the same products every year at high markup. They managed to get away with it because their manufacturing technology continued improving with node shrinks roughly every 2 years which translated to better performance, energy efficiency etc.\n\nBut then everything went wrong for Intel and right for AMD at roughly the same time.\n\n**CPU Manufacturing**\n\nIntel got stuck on their 14nm process. They were supposed to begin mass producing products on their next 10nm node way back in 2016 but they still haven't really managed it. There are some 10nm products on the market now but performance is really poor and yields are terrible i.e. a lot of Intel's 10nm CPUs are broken and can't be used.\n\nDuring this time their manufacturing competitors like TSMC simply caught up and have now overtaken them. I think TSMC 5nm is entering mass production later this year. AMD CPUs are manufactured by TSMC so AMD have been benefiting from this significantly and all signs are pointing to this advantage increasing.\n\n**CPU Architecture - Zen**\n\nAMD's bulldozer sucked, but they followed it up with a new architecture called Zen in 2017 which was much more competitive. Their current Zen 2 architecture is pretty much equal to Intel's current offerings in terms of IPC and Zen 3 is rumoured to be a pretty big jump which may give them the architecture lead as well.\n\n**CPU Architecture - Chiplets**\n\nOne of the ways Intel screwed customers was not increasing core counts for years - they just didn't innovate in this area. AMD however did.\n\nThey came up with a chiplet design where rather than having the whole CPU on one die like Intel (a monolithic design) they consist of multiple smaller chiplets which are connected together. It's much easier to manufacture large core count CPUs this way as if a single large die has a defect on it it can kill the whole thing, so it's less risky to make smaller dies and hook them up.\n\n**CPU Summary**\n\nThe combination of the improved Zen architecture, the chiplet design and the TSMC manufacturing lead means AMD can produce higher core count CPUs than Intel can at lower cost. They also use less energy. They also tend to offer more features. They also run faster when core counts are high.\n\nSo now their products in the consumer space are very competitive VS Intel. Intel has a marginal gaming lead due to higher clocks at lower core counts still but AMD looks like a no-brainer in a lot of cases.\n\n* If you need lots of cores - go AMD\n* If you want a laptop with long battery life - go AMD (at least when their new Zen 2 based models are out - mobile chips come last for AMD)\n* If you need features like ECC - go AMD\n* If you need lots of PCI-E lanes - go AMD\n* If you run a datacenter - go AMD for the greatly reduced cost per core and better power efficiency. There is a **LOT** of money here.\n\nAll signs are pointing to these advantages only getting larger as AMD releases Zen 3 and TSMC extend their manufacturing lead over Intel.\n\n**GPUs**\n\nNvidia has been dominating AMD in the GPU space for a long time. AMD has some products competitive in the low-mid range but they just haven't been able to match Nvidia's best performance. The 2080ti came out in Sep 2018 but AMD still haven't released anything as fast.\n\nBut it's rumoured AMD may make a bit of a comeback when their new architecture RDNA 2 hits later this year. It's supposedly significantly faster than their current offerings and it looks like they may have manufacturing leadership as well. Again TSMC produce AMDs GPUs but normally they also produce them for Nvidia as well. But supposedly Nvidia tried pitting Samsung vs TSMC to reduce their prices and TSMC just gave them the boot, meaning Nvidia now has to produce their next gen cards on Samsung who offer an inferior process.\n\nA lot of this is based on rumour though. It's looking fairly certain AMD will be making serious headway on the CPU front, the GPU front is more of an unknown at this point.\n\n**Consoles**\n\nNot much to say here - AMD is producing the CPUs and GPUs for both the next Xbox and Playstation. This will bring a nice revenue boost in Q4 this year and in to next year, but this should be priced in.\n\n**Coronavirus**\n\nAMD is set to benefit greatly from coronavirus. There has been increased demand for their products as adoption of cloud services increases and consumers need their own devices to WFH. Intel may gain significantly as well as they are still the dominant player, and the server markets move slowly and consumers can take a while to change their opinion of brands. But it should still be a positive.\n\n**Risks**\n\nOn the negative side AMD is really vulnerable to political issues with China. They are reliant on TSMC to manufacture their products and TSMC are based in Taiwan.\n\n**AMD's Finances**\n\nAMD is coming from a situation to where they were nearly bankrupt to one where they are rapidly gaining market share. They are set to capture market share in CPUs, a market which is also growing significantly at the moment and may well do so in the GPU space as well.\n\nThey have also been paying off their debt and have nearly got rid of all of it. Together that means they are set for a rather big jump in earnings which could quickly lower their P/E ratio. Or they could increase R&amp;D investment which helps them build on their success on the longer term / a bit of both.",

We\u2019re talking self driving cars, delivery drones, and doctors in New York performing surgery on soldiers in Afghanistan in a tent. \n\nFrom there you have the companies that make the actually radio transmission device like Nokia and Ericsson (both very reasonably priced). Those devices have to go somewhere so you put them on a tower owned by AMT and CCI (crown castle, not carnival cruise line). Those companies make money renting the towers to the service providers. Then you have the companies that make the chips that go into those devices, the chips that go into cell phones, drones and the internet of things (NVDA, INTC, MRVL, QCOM, etc.). Then there are the companies that make the devices we buy to connect us to 5G (Apple, amazon, google, Tesla). Finally there are the service providers like Verizon att and t mobile that connect our devices to the 5G network. \n\nI suggest starting at YouTube. There are videos that explain what each company does and their role in the 5G network.\n\nHowever, I wanted ALL of the companies with not a lot of money so I went after the 5G ETF (ticker: FIVG).",

        "body": "Lets take this one bite at a time. Please understand this isn't a personal rant of Intel hate or AMD love, just my informed opinion about the companies as investments. \n\nClock speed - Yep. Intel still holds *single core* performance crown, at the cost of incredibly high power draw and all for maybe 5% improvement. Multi-Core AMD still leads and offers more value per $ overall. \n\nMarket Share - Depends on your sources and regions so I won't nitpick on specifically \"who has more % of market share\" but rather, who has momentum and is gaining vs. losing market share. AMD is gaining consistently regardless of data source. \n\nSecurity Flaws - Threat to both, Intel has just had more bad press lately. No telling when these flaws get picked up in the media or how much they will effect. However, the CTS Labs scandal from 2018 shouldn't be ignored. An intel funded \"security\" company based in Israel announces AMD vulnerabilities publicly without contacting AMD (industry standard to give notice so they can fix). Vulnerabilities were practically nothing (diversion from Spectre and Meltdown) and company has faded into the background without answering any questions, deleting their webpage \"[AMDFlaws.com](https://AMDFlaws.com)\"\n\nMarketing Deception - \n\n* 2018 Computex Industrial Chiller incident to distract from Threadripper\n* Principled Technologies funded study, using an Intel funded benchmark, that pitted the i9-9900K  against a 2700X that deliberately had half its cores disabled\n* Threadripper losing to an i5 in same Intel funded benchmark\n* 2019 MDS vulnerability appears, Intel bribes researchers to downplay severity\n* \"Real World Performance\" campaign the moment benchmarks started showing AMD consistently in the lead, trying to devalue long standing benchmark validity. \n* \"Financial Horsepower\" $3 BILLION set aside to persuade anyone considering AMD to stick with Intel.\n* \"Real World Performance\" caught deliberately hiding disclosures, which exist because Intel was previously caught in anti-consumer deceptive practices in 2009. \n* Plethora of vaporware product announcements with rigged benchmarks, but since the product was never released we can't independently test. \n\nAnti-Competitive Practices - See $3Billion bullet above. And dont' recall what their latest margins on CPUs were, but AMD margins are increasing and Intel has been price cutting. Again, momentum in AMDs favor. \n\nNvidia Market Leader - Team Green has long been the GPU market leader and it isn't debatable, but as AMD (hopefully) and Intel both become more competitive Nvidia may be forced to cut into their margin to stay on top. Sources vary again, but typically they sit at about 70% market share +/-. \n\nMy comparison to Ford/Tesla = Intel/Nvidia remains. Intel has the capability/cash to turn the ship around but I'm not buying until I see a defined culture shift there.",

We had just had the internet millenial clock challenge so everybody and been spending a lot on hardware.  And the market simply projected that growth forward for years.   It didn't happen.  Are we making the same mistake now with services and the Cloud?  There has to be a point where, like hardware, the services are mature and the crazy growth comes back to single digits.  When/if that happens these crazy multiples will come way down.

Workstations don't care about clock speed, they  want multi core throughput. \n\nWhat is your technical knowledge? I doubt any average software uses more than 6 cores. Not only that, but multi-cores becomes very ineffecient the more cores you have.\n\nAlso games don't use 1 or 2 cores, games really do use all the cores usually, just at a certain point it doesn't make a difference anymore because of a lot of technical difficulties. And most of modern games barely use the CPU for anything, so the FPS differences between 9600K and 3700X will be almost none except for very CPU-intensive games. \n\nYou should watch this : [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5-3MMoA\\_A0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5-3MMoA_A0)\n\n&gt;again I have both AMD and Intel comps, the AMD wins hands down with  price per performance on everything but gaming higher clock speed and I  could still overclock if I absolutely needed more but most games do not  care about CPUs its GPU bottle-necked. \n\nHow did you test that? Sounds like some bullshit you made up with no objective data. As I said before, most programs don't use multiple cores effeciently as they simply can't.\n\nThe only thing a 3700X, which is much more expensive than the 9600k, would beat the 9600K in, would be either specific software utilizing multiple cores to compute independent lines of code or a lot of active programs being ran at once. \n\n&gt;only in single core speed, in multi core processes the 3700X has 2 more  cores and twice the threads it would dominate the i5 9600K. A better  comparison in the cheaper benchmarks is a 3600X anyways as it has the  same 6 cores but more threads at roughly the same clock speed and  similar price as a i5 9600K. Making it a better choice than the i5 9600K  in everything but gaming and in gaming both CPUs would perform just  fine. \n\nSame answer as above. \n\nAnd no, a 9600K should be compared to a 3700X, the 3600X is no match at all. The 9600K outperforms the 3600X even on the 8-core test, lmao. Showing how threads aren't that useful. \n\n**Here are the specific and objective numbers that are relevant :**\n\n3700X is \\~42% more expensive than the 9600K, 170 euros vs 240 euros.\n\nThese are the performance scores, 9600K on the left and 3700X on the right. Non-OC :\n\nMemory speed : 93,3 vs 79\n\nSingle-core : 136 vs 136\n\nTwo-core : 271 vs 269\n\nFour-core : 532 vs 516\n\nEight-core : 761 vs 928\n\nSixty-four core : 905 vs 1499\n\nOC :\n\nMemory speed : 97,4 vs 89,2\n\nSingle-core : 155 vs 141\n\nTwo-core : 308 vs 281\n\nFour-core : 616 vs 548\n\nEight-core : 899 vs 1025\n\nSixty-four core : 768 vs 1418\n\nSource : [https://cpu.userbenchmark.com/Compare/Intel-Core-i5-9600K-vs-AMD-Ryzen-7-3700X/4031vs4043](https://cpu.userbenchmark.com/Compare/Intel-Core-i5-9600K-vs-AMD-Ryzen-7-3700X/4031vs4043)\n\nAs you can see, objectively, there's no reason to ever buy the much more expensive 3700X over the 9600K unless you specifically require a very high core count.  Also note that in benchmarks the conditions for multi-core are ideal with minimum memory usage and no overlapping calculations. In real world software, there will always be a lot of memory storage and reading between CPU's, which will make the multi-cores less effective. \n\nIn games that like multi-core CPU's like CS:GO the 9600K still outperforms the 3700X by 20% in fps, this mostly likely caused by the memory latency of the 3700X. \n\nI'm not saying Intel is much better, I'm saying Intel's performance is king, while AMD's price per performance is king.\n\nI believe the Ryzen 5 3600 is the most valuable processor right now. As you can see, many AMD's on the list :\n\n[https://www.cpubenchmark.net/cpu\\_value\\_available.html](https://www.cpubenchmark.net/cpu_value_available.html)",

For some officials to say, \"we will not go back into lockdown or close businesses\" and then a couple days later close down businesses, they must be receiving enough intel/pressure to know they're going to lose far more tax revenue in the long run if they try and keep everything open through a huge holiday weekend and just shut everything down on Monday 7/6.

Samsung is probably the second best in the world, and they're a good 3 years behind TSMC's current node.\n\nTSMC manufactures chips for companies like Apple, AMD and Tesla. This is how good their reputation is. They're the best.\n\nBet against shit companies. Not the Rolls Royces of the industrial world.\n\nIf you're gonna bet against a foundry, bet against UMC or something. If Intel were just a foundry, I'd bet against them, because their foundry side has been floundering for years now. But I would never bet against Intel's sales and marketing....",

This has started to decay a bit in recent years, but the last time AMD had the better CPUs in the processor space (a couple of decades ago) you still could not buy a PC with an AMD processor because of various contracts Intel had with the PC manufacturers.\n\nThis is no longer an accurate description of the market. AMD and Intel are both widely available in basically every single OEM's product lineups. I'm sure there's a few random OEMs out there that only use one chip manufacturer for accidental reasons - they got a good wholesale deal, or they have a limited lineup of models and it was easier to use a single chipset - but in general AMD is equally available from all the big OEMs.",

Their CPUs are currently smashing Intel in terms of price to performance, and thir GPUs are significantly cheaper than Nvidias, alebeit with less performance.\n\nNvidia is the market leader in terms of GPUs, have just signed a deal with Mercedes and their next generation of GPU is said to be coming out later this year. With a significant performance increase, you'll be able to get a 2nd tier GPU from the new generation, which will outperform the 1st tier from the previous generation, giving them an even more sizable lead over AMD.\n\nSomeone mentioned in a post here that the future could be APUs - essentially you wouldn't need a GPU becuase the computer's CPU is so powerful it runs all the graphics requirements. And at the moment AMD and Intel do offer some APUs, but right now they are no match for having a dedicated GPU. We're probably 10 years or so away from APUs taking over, if they do.\n\nI personally hold a position in Nvidia.",
