Architects using Revit and contractors coordinating in 3D modeling/Navis is becoming the standard. Delivering that model to the end user building managers is still in its infancy, but it's the goal.   \n\n\nAutodesk moved to a subscription platform some time back for their software to milk more cash out of their users (everyone) instead of just being able to buy it. And all the subcontractors along the way involved in constructing a building need the software to participate.\n\nThey also recently acquired Plangrid, which is pretty damn impressive. Their proprietary compression blows the pants off shitty Acrobat and .pdfs. \n\nHow this relates to this week's earnings I don't know, but I'm long for sure.",
