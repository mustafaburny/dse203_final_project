But my point isn't to start and argument about that one SPAC. my point is that even when there are legitimate headwinds that can stifle non-SPAC focused traders/investors to enter pre-merger, and is really a strong source of pre-merge push, those voices are drowned out and down-voted, and literally called clueless. \n\nSo yeah, for any given SPAC, most seem driven by the next shiny toy, as as I put it, the appearance of the next \"Squirrel\", which grabs everyone's attention as they chase trying to get in early and eventually leave at the top. This is great for bragging rights, or ego, or trying to back up their claim of being some oracle or whatever, but actually hurts profits.

They have some great partnerships in the works, and you might think of them as something like MS was to hardware in the 90s when it comes to big data and automotive.  \n\nOne example - if TSLA is like Apple - a company that wants to build their own hardware and software so that everything is tightly integrated, and if it's difficult for a hardware company to simply \"get good\" at software (it is), then it makes a lot of sense for a company like BB to step in and fill that void.\n\nhttps://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2019/blackberry-qnx-software-now-embedded-in-more-than-150-million-vehicles#:~:text=Automotive%20OEMs%20and%20tier%20ones,%2C%20KIA%2C%20Maserati%2C%20Mercedes%2D\n\n150 million cars have embedded the QNX platform now.  So if TSLA gets to self-driving by having a lot of their own cars on the road, imagine how much quicker these companies can get there using collective data mining from ALL the cars they're making.  \n\nRight now - they're making use of QNX for other purposes - but the software is already there.  The connectivity and interoperability and the _contracts_ are there.  For a company that's good at software, it's a simple thing to build more functionality to support new needs.  For a company that's good at hardware, you just keep making good hardware and win customers as you always have.\n\nRecall that MS rose to prominence because Gates and Co. saw a path to making great software that worked on any hardware - while these hardware companies were trying to make their own software suites to compete with each other.  Only Apple really survived in the PC space (you could argue Sun went the distance, perhaps you can argue it for IBM and Oracle, though I think they were players in hardware / software to different degrees).  \n\nThere are some big challenges that need solving in the next decade.  For the automotive space, TSLA isn't going to solve those challenges for all drivers.  Mercedes isn't going away.  Toyota isn't going away.  There are entire cities in Germany where I haven't seen anything else but BMWs.  So who is going to step in and augment those companies with software expertise?\n\nIt very well may be Blackberry.",

I learned some of this stuff doing DD prior to the PLTR \\*DPO.\n\nICE actually has two completely separate divisions in what they do in terms of business function/responsibility/jackasses running it: \n\n* HSI, Homeland security investigations, they look for foreign criminals and criminal acts.\n* ERO, Enforcement and Removal Operations, they having nothing better to do than deport people who don't have citizenships.\n\nOriginally the contract was only to support HSI.  They were working on breaking up importation violations w/ CBP, Customs and Border Protection (under the DHS umbrella that ICE also exists under along w/ secret service, OIG, Coast Guard, TSA, FEMA, USCIS) and work w/ local LE to identify people in criminal rings in illegal importation of drugs, non-CARB legal Skyline GT-Rs, Silvias, AE86s, and other drift cars, gang/cartel activity including human trafficking.\n\nERO got a hard-on (erection/sexual arousal) when they found out about Palantir's capabilities and walked over to their HSI buddy cubicles and started shoulder surfing PLTR and eventually just taking over by using the platform for their own investigations.\n\nThis all began under the Obama administration.  So I mean, I get that the United States should be developing best in class stuff so we can keep up with foreign governments.  But it speaks volumes that our administration (bipartisan) would do this kind of BS.\n\nLike China has MiningLamp which is supposed to be a data analytics platform comparable to Palantir.  And now w/ the stolen F35 lightning plans, they have their own facsimile (look up the Shenyang J31).  So \"foreign adversaries\" aka \"foreign trade partners\" are on the same or similar level to us, blame foreign espionage, blame globalism, if humanity was equal in terms of tech and trade, there'd be no problem.\n\nIf we're really pissed off about the comings and goings of the United States' actions, we should dump the assholes in Congress, Senate, and Executive leadership to figure out a way that doesn't involve inciting revolution, installing shill gov'ts, and drone bombing people the opposition to keep a hold on oil.  \n\nData analysis platforms are just going to get more important as the years go by.  Data analysis has been the next gold rush for the past decade and a half with Facebook, Google, Amazon, Oracle, AdTech, Medical Research, and other companies using the data to streamline operations, manufacturing, production, research, and sales.  \n\n*Punishing Palantir for witchcraft is akin to fearing doctors because bloodletting used to be a thing.*\n\n**Palantir is going to the moon first** before everyone else cuz they were fucking *tits deep* in this stuff since 2004.  And they'll continue to be tits deep before anyone even gets balls deep.\n\nIt's like Tesla and electric vehicles.  \n\nOnly now is GM (Nikola lol), Ford (Rivian), and other manufacturers trying to get in.  But Tesla's bottom up approach, listening to consumers, is destroying all the other car manufacturers (because traditional big AF car companies do a top down approach by having marketing teams making assumptions of what consumers really care about).\n\nUltimately, we don't need to shill WSB to get people to invest, we're already doing that.  What is important is to help \"Main street\" understand the implications.  Palantir has a bipartisan pass.  AOC is raising concerns, but is doing it for clout.  If she was in a presidential position, she'd be riding the PLTR Train to the moon too.\n\nPLTR doesn't need rockets to get to the moon.  They built the fucking railroad to get there.\n\n\\--\n\n\\*because I keep calling it an IPO by accident when it was a direct listing",

Snowflake is replacing datawarehouse and data lake at our work. Most apache projects need lot of infra support understanding of things that make adoption and maintenance a nightmare. Snowflake is after growth so they are spending huge on sales and marketing. Additionally, check data sharing and data marketplace features of snowflake. Those allow data sharing between companies without etl. Marketplace allows companies to sell data to others using snowflake cloud. The revenue from this could be huge similar to app store.

If they do go fabless like AMD, I'd expect them to go down pretty quick.  It's the reason why they're able to get such high margins, it's what their entire design process is built around, and it's likely what's allowing them to maintain market share while AMD and NVidia face supply shortages.  However, you do raise a good point about ongoing costs.\n\nFab Under-utilitization.  Seems like they've gotten a ton of product out of 14 nm, to the point that it's become a running joke.  I heard your point about them not selling space to other companies, but this seems to be partially because nobody wants that space.  TSMC is the fab everybody goes to because they're not producing their own products, Intel has no such claims.\n\nToxic Culture - I've also heard the rumors, but having worked for a number of big companies there always seems to be the same old rumors.  MSFT, Oracle, etc have all had the same things said about them, and they continue to be successful.  Steve Jobs is like the prototypical toxic boss, waking people up at 3 am when they're sleeping under their desks to tell them their shit sucks.  Truth is that in a large enough company there's always going to be disgruntled employees, toxic bosses, and drama.\n\nI missed their CES, but I'll give you this point and the server loss.  I've heard enough about mix ups, and apparent bad communication between marketing and engineering.\n\nI'll also agree with you that this idea of the \"Great Man\" fixing things seems to be pretty dumb.  I don't think CEOs have anywhere near the impact people thing they do, any more than I think Jim Keller was going to do something amazing for them, or Bob Swan was the origin of all their problems.  Just not possible to have a large impact in an organization of 100K employees.\n\nAny particular reason for the 25-50% prediction?  Seems like it's already priced in with people arguing that NVidia and AMD are fair value.  If INTC traded at those same valuations, they would be a $255 per share company.  Even just trading at 25x P/E like, say Texas Instruments would double their price.",

But, let me follow up with insight from my buddy who's in \"the field\" in a manner of speaking. Palantir is doing two things that are untouched at the moment. First, he says that as a contracting agency is doing their own background research on their own needs, Palantir is at the table and listening and constantly sculpting their product to meet that demand. This means that when an RFP comes out that Palantir already has the product ready and tailored for the need. That's one great advantage. Second, Palantir is eliminating the need to hire a secondary \"integrator\". In layman's terms, their competitors like Salesforce and Oracle and so on only sell the client a license to use the software. This means that you need to hire an external consulting firm to integrate (tailor) the product to the contracting agency's demands. Palantir eliminates this middle man (integrator) entirely. He says that the product and service that Palantir offers is more expensive than their competitors, but there they offer the product at a much lower effort level than anyone else. These are two things you won't really find elsewhere in the forums.",

There\u2019s a reason for this: SAP not only helped invent the ERP space, starting with an integrated accounting solution in 1973 and leading the industry as it grew into what it is today. It also is the largest ERP vendor and the 12th largest technology company in the world, used by more than 404,000 businesses across 180 different countries.\n\n&gt;Most large businesses use SAP or its closest competitor, Oracle, and SMBs also rely on SAP software; 80 percent of SAP\u2019s customer base is made up of small to medium-sized businesses (SMBs), a surprising number given the company\u2019s reputation for powering some of the world\u2019s largest multinationals.\n\nAnd guess what integrates with SAP (and Oracle)?  Microsoft products. In fact last I checked, SAP's software only runs on Windows. So any company using SAP at bare minimum needs Windows just to manage it...and if they are planning to use it for anything they need Microsoft products (Excel is a big one since it can link directly into SAP and many companies use Microsoft SQL Server as the data backend for SAP, and they use Power BI for analysis on that data...). \n\n\nGoogle has made zero inroads here.",

        "body": "Oh no I'm not trying to shit on you or anything. Again, I agree with the majority of your points. That all is why I'm not already invested in PCPL. However, I still do think it'll rise a good 20-30% leading up to merger just because E2Open has good enough numbers to be believably hype-able. Long term I wouldn't want to be in it overall, but at the same time I'd also rather be in E2Open long term over the majority of companies we've been seeing come out of SPACs recently. Agreed that there's companies more likely to take over their market than them, but I felt as if your initial comment was a little too bearish. E2Open has an uphill battle to break out in their industry, but at the same time I felt as if you were down playing their industry's growth potential a little too much. \n\nUnfortunately an ODS is not quite the cure all that I wish it could be. I can already pull past supplier information pretty easily just with QMF queries, the issue is more putting it together with my company's other data sources since sourcing has to use more than just operational data. There's ways that I could (and do) work around this, but in a macro sense most of my dept doesn't have the SQL skills or willingness to learn them that I might have. Hilariously, I'm slowly turning into a SQL query machine for some of my team. While I enjoy that more than the real shit work, it's inefficient and not what I signed up for. I could design a program to help people do this, which is actually how our main sales scan data software was created (a sales associate got sick of writing queries so he literally made an entire system to do it so people wouldn't ask him), but I know exactly how underappreciated he was for that. Both in a financial and promotional sense within the company...\n\nI think part of what's going on here is that you have a much better grasp than I do of the tech side of E2Open versus their direct or indirect competition, but because I'm in sourcing at a company that already uses Oracle and previously used SAP services, I can tell you that what they can offer us doesn't quite do what we need it to. My company actually completely revamped our data management systems in the past year, but because they couldn't find a good solution in the same timeframe for sourcing (from both incumbent providers and the other bids that got rejected), my dept got a bit left behind. AFAIK the plan is now to find a new provider/service that can do what we need, but my company is a boomer company so these things take longer than they should lol.",

        "body": "You have a lot of good points here, but there's a couple things that are missing. So to explain, I work in corporate sourcing (for those unfamiliar, it's very tied in with supply chain/operations) for a Fortune 100 (we're bigger than that but giving myself some wiggle room to keep my own privacy) company. SAP/Oracle and other related SQL type programs/interfaces are essential for my job, and my company makes use of other software that is comparable to Salesforce. We heavily use PowerBI and other related programs as well. \n\nHowever, all of these tools do not fit perfectly into my or my department's day to day demands. As a result, we waste time and money cobbling together reports from different sources. This is not hyperbole, I quite literally spend more time on most reports cleaning up data and getting different data sets to fit together than actually figuring out what needs to be reported. Now, this wouldn't matter if my dept was small and/or stagnant. That's not the case. The industry I work in (one of the largest in America) isn't going anywhere, but the way the companies within it are approaching their business optimization has changed drastically. Sourcing in particular has exploded and the department at my company was less than half the size a year ago as it is now. This is not just my company being a trendsetter. We're slightly late to the party but by no means at the end of the timing distribution. As the sourcing department grows we'll eventually need truly dedicated software solutions, and a company like E2Open is a prime candidate. The sales teams can use their software or salesforce, HR can use workforce, operations and supply chain can use our current ERP software (though even corporate supply chain employees would probably prefer a sourcing designed software setup), and marketing can use powerbi (mostly, but they also use salesforce), but sourcing truly needs its own software at companies like mine to work efficiently.\n\nNow, I cannot say that my company would choose E2Open, but going with another company to design our systems has been the go to for my company for decades. The existing solutions aren't truly viable as they don't exactly fit what we need. Sure, large companies like SAP or Oracle could rework their systems to fit us, but that takes years and would probably be more expensive than an existing solution.\n\nAdditionally, my company technically isn't even the largest company in our industry, we're second largest in our subset and smaller than 4 or 5 of our indirect competitors. 2 of those larger indirect competitors have their own software for certain, but the others and pretty much every single smaller competitor is in a similar position to my company.\n\nI don't want to say exactly what industry I work in, much less the company, but there is certainly a growing market in some industries that E2Open and similar companies can tap. I don't know if they will, but the potential is there, and honestly we all know that's what most SPAC investors are looking for, potential.",

That in fact is the reason SAP is selling a lot of new systems (S4 Hana). That incidentally also gives them protection against Oracle!\n\nHowever while your points are valid remember from a valuation point E2 will have to win more against entrenched competitors. Their own confidence (they could certainly be lowballing their growth numbers in order to give themselves a lift up) but that will show up in later years if we believe their narrative then 10% growth is what we bake into valuation game and margins being standard I don\u2019t see how we can value them higher than 10-11 range which gives them a valuation of 2.7b grow that at 10%compounded where\u2019s the meat to give uplift? The trick is this is not revolutionary tech but maybe incremental difference that can\u2019t justify a common at 15 and growing - there are better investments out there why not put your money in Infor or SAP or CRM? \n\nThe enterprise application world will grow but at 8-10% what will grow is apps that enable new markets and new clients personalization and all things digital. \n\nThese are my inputs and I know this place I have got a lot in these forums so want to lend my experience to folks who want to make money in tech world - no offense intended we are all here to share our ideas.

I learned some of this stuff doing DD prior to the PLTR \\*DPO.\n\nICE actually has two completely separate divisions in what they do in terms of business function/responsibility/jackasses running it: \n\n* HSI, Homeland security investigations, they look for foreign criminals and criminal acts.\n* ERO, Enforcement and Removal Operations, they having nothing better to do than deport people who don't have citizenships.\n\nOriginally the contract was only to support HSI.  They were working on breaking up importation violations w/ CBP, Customs and Border Protection (under the DHS umbrella that ICE also exists under along w/ secret service, OIG, Coast Guard, TSA, FEMA, USCIS) and work w/ local LE to identify people in criminal rings in illegal importation of drugs, non-CARB legal Skyline GT-Rs, Silvias, AE86s, and other drift cars, gang/cartel activity including human trafficking.\n\nERO got a hard-on (erection/sexual arousal) when they found out about Palantir's capabilities and walked over to their HSI buddy cubicles and started shoulder surfing PLTR and eventually just taking over by using the platform for their own investigations.\n\nThis all began under the Obama administration.  So I mean, I get that the United States should be developing best in class stuff so we can keep up with foreign governments.  But it speaks volumes that our administration (bipartisan) would do this kind of BS.\n\nLike China has MiningLamp which is supposed to be a data analytics platform comparable to Palantir.  And now w/ the stolen F35 lightning plans, they have their own facsimile (look up the Shenyang J31).  So \"foreign adversaries\" aka \"foreign trade partners\" are on the same or similar level to us, blame foreign espionage, blame globalism, if humanity was equal in terms of tech and trade, there'd be no problem.\n\nIf we're really pissed off about the comings and goings of the United States' actions, we should dump the assholes in Congress, Senate, and Executive leadership to figure out a way that doesn't involve inciting revolution, installing shill gov'ts, and drone bombing people the opposition to keep a hold on oil.  \n\nData analysis platforms are just going to get more important as the years go by.  Data analysis has been the next gold rush for the past decade and a half with Facebook, Google, Amazon, Oracle, AdTech, Medical Research, and other companies using the data to streamline operations, manufacturing, production, research, and sales.  \n\n*Punishing Palantir for witchcraft is akin to fearing doctors because bloodletting used to be a thing.*\n\n**Palantir is going to the moon first** before everyone else cuz they were fucking *tits deep* in this stuff since 2004.  And they'll continue to be tits deep before anyone even gets balls deep.\n\nIt's like Tesla and electric vehicles.  \n\nOnly now is GM (Nikola lol), Ford (Rivian), and other manufacturers trying to get in.  But Tesla's bottom up approach, listening to consumers, is destroying all the other car manufacturers (because traditional big AF car companies do a top down approach by having marketing teams making assumptions of what consumers really care about).\n\nUltimately, we don't need to shill WSB to get people to invest, we're already doing that.  What is important is to help \"Main street\" understand the implications.  Palantir has a bipartisan pass.  AOC is raising concerns, but is doing it for clout.  If she was in a presidential position, she'd be riding the PLTR Train to the moon too.\n\nPLTR doesn't need rockets to get to the moon.  They built the fucking railroad to get there.\n\n\\--\n\n\\*because I keep calling it an IPO by accident when it was a direct listing",

But, let me follow up with insight from my buddy who's in \"the field\" in a manner of speaking. Palantir is doing two things that are untouched at the moment. First, he says that as a contracting agency is doing their own background research on their own needs, Palantir is at the table and listening and constantly sculpting their product to meet that demand. This means that when an RFP comes out that Palantir already has the product ready and tailored for the need. That's one great advantage. Second, Palantir is eliminating the need to hire a secondary \"integrator\". In layman's terms, their competitors like Salesforce and Oracle and so on only sell the client a license to use the software. This means that you need to hire an external consulting firm to integrate (tailor) the product to the contracting agency's demands. Palantir eliminates this middle man (integrator) entirely. He says that the product and service that Palantir offers is more expensive than their competitors, but there they offer the product at a much lower effort level than anyone else. These are two things you won't really find elsewhere in the forums.",

However, I still do think it'll rise a good 20-30% leading up to merger just because E2Open has good enough numbers to be believably hype-able. Long term I wouldn't want to be in it overall, but at the same time I'd also rather be in E2Open long term over the majority of companies we've been seeing come out of SPACs recently. Agreed that there's companies more likely to take over their market than them, but I felt as if your initial comment was a little too bearish. E2Open has an uphill battle to break out in their industry, but at the same time I felt as if you were down playing their industry's growth potential a little too much. \n\nUnfortunately an ODS is not quite the cure all that I wish it could be. I can already pull past supplier information pretty easily just with QMF queries, the issue is more putting it together with my company's other data sources since sourcing has to use more than just operational data. There's ways that I could (and do) work around this, but in a macro sense most of my dept doesn't have the SQL skills or willingness to learn them that I might have. Hilariously, I'm slowly turning into a SQL query machine for some of my team. While I enjoy that more than the real shit work, it's inefficient and not what I signed up for. I could design a program to help people do this, which is actually how our main sales scan data software was created (a sales associate got sick of writing queries so he literally made an entire system to do it so people wouldn't ask him), but I know exactly how underappreciated he was for that. Both in a financial and promotional sense within the company...\n\nI think part of what's going on here is that you have a much better grasp than I do of the tech side of E2Open versus their direct or indirect competition, but because I'm in sourcing at a company that already uses Oracle and previously used SAP services, I can tell you that what they can offer us doesn't quite do what we need it to. My company actually completely revamped our data management systems in the past year, but because they couldn't find a good solution in the same timeframe for sourcing (from both incumbent providers and the other bids that got rejected), my dept got a bit left behind. AFAIK the plan is now to find a new provider/service that can do what we need, but my company is a boomer company so these things take longer than they should lol.",

        "body": "You have a lot of good points here, but there's a couple things that are missing. So to explain, I work in corporate sourcing (for those unfamiliar, it's very tied in with supply chain/operations) for a Fortune 100 (we're bigger than that but giving myself some wiggle room to keep my own privacy) company. SAP/Oracle and other related SQL type programs/interfaces are essential for my job, and my company makes use of other software that is comparable to Salesforce. We heavily use PowerBI and other related programs as well. \n\nHowever, all of these tools do not fit perfectly into my or my department's day to day demands. As a result, we waste time and money cobbling together reports from different sources. This is not hyperbole, I quite literally spend more time on most reports cleaning up data and getting different data sets to fit together than actually figuring out what needs to be reported. Now, this wouldn't matter if my dept was small and/or stagnant. That's not the case. The industry I work in (one of the largest in America) isn't going anywhere, but the way the companies within it are approaching their business optimization has changed drastically. Sourcing in particular has exploded and the department at my company was less than half the size a year ago as it is now. This is not just my company being a trendsetter. We're slightly late to the party but by no means at the end of the timing distribution. As the sourcing department grows we'll eventually need truly dedicated software solutions, and a company like E2Open is a prime candidate. The sales teams can use their software or salesforce, HR can use workforce, operations and supply chain can use our current ERP software (though even corporate supply chain employees would probably prefer a sourcing designed software setup), and marketing can use powerbi (mostly, but they also use salesforce), but sourcing truly needs its own software at companies like mine to work efficiently.\n\nNow, I cannot say that my company would choose E2Open, but going with another company to design our systems has been the go to for my company for decades. The existing solutions aren't truly viable as they don't exactly fit what we need. Sure, large companies like SAP or Oracle could rework their systems to fit us, but that takes years and would probably be more expensive than an existing solution.\n\nAdditionally, my company technically isn't even the largest company in our industry, we're second largest in our subset and smaller than 4 or 5 of our indirect competitors. 2 of those larger indirect competitors have their own software for certain, but the others and pretty much every single smaller competitor is in a similar position to my company.\n\nI don't want to say exactly what industry I work in, much less the company, but there is certainly a growing market in some industries that E2Open and similar companies can tap. I don't know if they will, but the potential is there, and honestly we all know that's what most SPAC investors are looking for, potential.",

        "body": "I hear you and there is a market for E2Open however what you are saying as well what your groups need can be resolved by creating Operational Data Source (ODS) of which one can report say past performance of a supplier (timeliness, quality price etc) in fact the world is moving to a on the fly reporting that SAP is able to do using their Columnar database. That in fact is the reason SAP is selling a lot of new systems (S4 Hana). That incidentally also gives them protection against Oracle!\n\nHowever while your points are valid remember from a valuation point E2 will have to win more against entrenched competitors. Their own confidence (they could certainly be lowballing their growth numbers in order to give themselves a lift up) but that will show up in later years if we believe their narrative then 10% growth is what we bake into valuation game and margins being standard I don\u2019t see how we can value them higher than 10-11 range which gives them a valuation of 2.7b grow that at 10%compounded where\u2019s the meat to give uplift? The trick is this is not revolutionary tech but maybe incremental difference that can\u2019t justify a common at 15 and growing - there are better investments out there why not put your money in Infor or SAP or CRM? \n\nThe enterprise application world will grow but at 8-10% what will grow is apps that enable new markets and new clients personalization and all things digital. \n\nThese are my inputs and I know this place I have got a lot in these forums so want to lend my experience to folks who want to make money in tech world - no offense intended we are all here to share our ideas. This is very close to the problems of CCXX and MPLN (though there it was also debt) similar market problems. Here\u2019s to making more money in 2021 that\u2019s all the goal should be!",

Something breaks, turn up a new container and keep on trucking.\"\n\nMost of their business will be at the enterprise tier which greatly reduces the pool of customers they can pull from.",

Palantir\u2019s bread and butter is their team of devs and engineers who build out the customized components of the platform but at that time it seemed difficult (read: bleeding out shares) to produce a realistic M&amp;O transition to the client. Their previous business model relied heavily on hiring contractors to providing ongoing technical/help desk support with a heavy emphasis on training users, however they are a software company and not a service company so they canned a lot of their professional services when the board realized they were losing too much on the services aspect. \n\nIt\u2019s like a graph database on roids with some geospatial pumps. The current industry/use cases is more focused on finding/connecting people through exposed data. Where they\u2019ve always struggled is with managing data quality as you essentially share the content on your network with everyone else on that network and people are constantly fucking things up like entity resolution (I.e. Dude 1  merges an entity with another entity with a similar name, Dude 2 is posed because this is NOT the same dude and now they need to unfuck the dude cluster. It\u2019s like a graph database on roids with some geospatial capabilities. \n\nCurious as to what you mean by functioning more like Oracle and less like an up and comer?\n\nIt seems like the platform could be changed to tackle different industries such as healthcare (provider/care management), insurance (claims management), and maybe logistics/operations (route optimization). There are other much more established organizations already owning these industries but it still seems scalable for them if they wanted to go that route.",

(I \\*do\\* own an electric car that I built myself. Love it. Planning to convert my daughter's car soon.)\n\nHere's why I think Tesla's stock value *could* be justified and *may* continue to go up.\n\n1. Tesla is a car company that makes a profit. It's not Amazon. But then, Amazon *didn't* make a profit for a long, long time. Amazon's retail product delivery service still doesn't make a profit. Who could have known that Amazon would beat Microsoft, Oracle, Cisco, Walmart, Akamai and all the others at cloud services? AWS is the meat of Amazon's profits. Who could have predicted this when they were just a book store?\n2. Tesla is also a consumer goods company. Solar power is just the tip of the iceberg. Heat pumps, Smart Homes, Satellite Networking... Yes, it's a tech company -- but it's more than that, it's a *BRAND*. Brand is far more valuable than innovation. The story you sell is more effective than the product you sell, *especially* if it's an also-ran product...\n3. Musk only knows one way to manage -- like a startup. Still going strong, like a start-up, after all these years.\n4. Leverage. Space-X, Boring Co. Tesla and whatever else comes along -- Grid-scale electrical storage? Off-grid self-sufficient housing? Insurance services? They all share tech between them. Tesla's Octo-valve, for instance. Almost certainly was designed by an aerospace engineer at Space-X.\n5. Tesla isn't Apple, or Amazon, or Microsoft. It's more like Java (the programming language) in the late 1990s.  Java didn't do anything better than any other language could do. It was a far worse language than many other more suitable, more mature ones. It failed at its main promise (write once, run anywhere!) Most seasoned programmers laughed at it. They said it wouldn't last. And yet...\n\nSo, forget about the cars. Tesla is a *brand*. It's a consumer technology-goods company that got it's start with cars, like Amazon got its start with books until it found gold in cloud services. Tesla is still digging, currently using a constellation of satellites... It won't end there. That's guaranteed.\n\nHaving said that, keep in mind that any one of IBM, Oracle, Walmart or a dozen others *could* have eaten Amazon's lunch at any time. Amazon was lucky no one tried very hard.",
