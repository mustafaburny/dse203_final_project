        "body": "Noobs gather around for story time.\n\nOnce upon a time, the short interest on GameStop was 140% (what in the Roth IRA fuck) and the shares hit $490.\n\nWhat does that mean?\n\nI\u2019ll explain like we\u2019re on a short bus on the way to space camp. Keep your arms and legs inside the vehicle all times.\n\n_____\n\nThere\u2019s only 100 crack rocks in the streets of Compton. Then these greedy ass bloods at Melvin St ask to borrow 140 crack rocks to return later and to pay interest on those rocks even though only 100 exist.\n\nMelvin St does this without actually holding any crack because they\u2019re not about that life. They\u2019ll buy and return the rock when it\u2019s cheaper in the future than when they borrowed it and pocket the change.\n\nThey do this order to drive the friendly neighborhood crack dealer GangStop out of business.\n\nMelvin St been doing this for years and when the last did this, one crack rock is worth $4. Melvin St really wants the rock to hit $0 and for GangStop to go out of business.\n\n______\n\nI love GangStop. They sell me my hood rat stuff for cheap. So I buy 10 crack rocks. My homies at Grove St Bets likes GangStop too. So they buy 10 crack rocks.\n\nThere\u2019s only 80 rocks available in the wild now.\n\n______\n\nRyan Cohen and his gang of crips see value in this enterprise. They come in and buy up 30 crack rocks which is a controlling stake. Now there is only 50 rocks left in the wild and shorts still have to return 140 rocks. \n\nThe price of a crack rock skyrockets because Ryan Cohen promises to close underperforming corners and sell the gang shit online instead.\n\nCall options to buy a bag of crack rock at a certain price are purchased and this drives the prices up. The kingpins who wrote those contracts buy up rocks in case those calls are exercised. This is called gamma hedging.\n\n______\n\nGrove St Bets gets wind of this and /u/deepfuckingvalue the oracle of the crack rock leads the charge in buying up crack rock to fuck the nerds at Melvin St. Now there is only 30 rock available for sale.\n\nToday, a price of a crack rock is $312. And the supply of crack on the streets is dwindling. Melvin St tried their darndest to manipulate the pricing on this because they\u2019re about to get gang banged if the debts are called in. This is called a margin call.\n\n______\n\nThe snitch ass bitches at the Citadel Community Center (who has a stake in Melvin St) called in the police commissioner at Apex Clearing House and they put pressure on Robinhood, Webull, E-Trade, etc to stop allowing the purchase of crack rock.\n\nHowever when the kingpins start gamma hedging, Melvin knows they\u2019ll either be butt fucked or gangbanged on the street.\n\n______\n\nThey still owe 140 pieces of crack rock when there is only 100 available. On top of that rocks are held by OG Ryan Cohen, Smart institutions, GSB, and Ja Rule.\n\nMelvin St and friends will have to pay any price in order to return the rocks that they borrowed to keep their homes and are already $70b in the hole.\n\nhttps://www.reuters.com/article/us-retail-trading-shortbets-idUSKBN29X1SW?taid=6012f37e9ac87d000147d4e3\n\n______\n\nSome say the price of a rock could reach $10,000.\n\nIn order for that to happen. You must follow rule number 4 of Biggie Smalls 10 Crack Commandments. Never get high on your own supply. \n\nTLDR: Hold that shit. Cocaines a helluva drug.",

The money won't just flow to other stable coins, but rather destabilize the entire market. \n\n- Exchanges will stop withdrawals\n- Trading will be paused\n- Investors will panic\n- Prices will crash as people try to sell.\n\n10) At the end of the day, nobody knows how long this scam will go on for. It could be days, weeks, months, or even years before they are shut down.\n\nBut educating yourself on whats happening is vital. I'm a huge proponent of Bitcoin, but this isn't sustainable.\n\nCredit: Jacob Oracle (https://twitter.com/JacobOracle)",

Writing seemed to always be on the wall. But my point isn't to start and argument about that one SPAC. my point is that even when there are legitimate headwinds that can stifle non-SPAC focused traders/investors to enter pre-merger, and is really a strong source of pre-merge push, those voices are drowned out and down-voted, and literally called clueless. \n\nSo yeah, for any given SPAC, most seem driven by the next shiny toy, as as I put it, the appearance of the next \"Squirrel\", which grabs everyone's attention as they chase trying to get in early and eventually leave at the top. This is great for bragging rights, or ego, or trying to back up their claim of being some oracle or whatever, but actually hurts profits. Focus on raw % gains, or net gain, on a single (or few) all-in moon shots doesn't maximum gains. It favors ego over profit. I'll focus on the latter personally.",

They have some great partnerships in the works, and you might think of them as something like MS was to hardware in the 90s when it comes to big data and automotive.  \n\nOne example - if TSLA is like Apple - a company that wants to build their own hardware and software so that everything is tightly integrated, and if it's difficult for a hardware company to simply \"get good\" at software (it is), then it makes a lot of sense for a company like BB to step in and fill that void.\n\nhttps://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2019/blackberry-qnx-software-now-embedded-in-more-than-150-million-vehicles#:~:text=Automotive%20OEMs%20and%20tier%20ones,%2C%20KIA%2C%20Maserati%2C%20Mercedes%2D\n\n150 million cars have embedded the QNX platform now.  So if TSLA gets to self-driving by having a lot of their own cars on the road, imagine how much quicker these companies can get there using collective data mining from ALL the cars they're making.  \n\nRight now - they're making use of QNX for other purposes - but the software is already there.  The connectivity and interoperability and the _contracts_ are there.  For a company that's good at software, it's a simple thing to build more functionality to support new needs.  For a company that's good at hardware, you just keep making good hardware and win customers as you always have.\n\nRecall that MS rose to prominence because Gates and Co. saw a path to making great software that worked on any hardware - while these hardware companies were trying to make their own software suites to compete with each other.  Only Apple really survived in the PC space (you could argue Sun went the distance, perhaps you can argue it for IBM and Oracle, though I think they were players in hardware / software to different degrees).  \n\nThere are some big challenges that need solving in the next decade.  For the automotive space, TSLA isn't going to solve those challenges for all drivers.  Mercedes isn't going away.  Toyota isn't going away.  There are entire cities in Germany where I haven't seen anything else but BMWs.  So who is going to step in and augment those companies with software expertise?\n\nIt very well may be Blackberry.",

        "body": "tbf, they started working w/ ncmec since 2010 and signed a contract w/ ICE in 2014.  It wasn't until 2015 when they had a full implementation going.  I learned some of this stuff doing DD prior to the PLTR \\*DPO.\n\nICE actually has two completely separate divisions in what they do in terms of business function/responsibility/jackasses running it: \n\n* HSI, Homeland security investigations, they look for foreign criminals and criminal acts.\n* ERO, Enforcement and Removal Operations, they having nothing better to do than deport people who don't have citizenships.\n\nOriginally the contract was only to support HSI.  They were working on breaking up importation violations w/ CBP, Customs and Border Protection (under the DHS umbrella that ICE also exists under along w/ secret service, OIG, Coast Guard, TSA, FEMA, USCIS) and work w/ local LE to identify people in criminal rings in illegal importation of drugs, non-CARB legal Skyline GT-Rs, Silvias, AE86s, and other drift cars, gang/cartel activity including human trafficking.\n\nERO got a hard-on (erection/sexual arousal) when they found out about Palantir's capabilities and walked over to their HSI buddy cubicles and started shoulder surfing PLTR and eventually just taking over by using the platform for their own investigations.\n\nThis all began under the Obama administration.  So I mean, I get that the United States should be developing best in class stuff so we can keep up with foreign governments.  But it speaks volumes that our administration (bipartisan) would do this kind of BS.\n\nLike China has MiningLamp which is supposed to be a data analytics platform comparable to Palantir.  And now w/ the stolen F35 lightning plans, they have their own facsimile (look up the Shenyang J31).  So \"foreign adversaries\" aka \"foreign trade partners\" are on the same or similar level to us, blame foreign espionage, blame globalism, if humanity was equal in terms of tech and trade, there'd be no problem.\n\nIf we're really pissed off about the comings and goings of the United States' actions, we should dump the assholes in Congress, Senate, and Executive leadership to figure out a way that doesn't involve inciting revolution, installing shill gov'ts, and drone bombing people the opposition to keep a hold on oil.  \n\nData analysis platforms are just going to get more important as the years go by.  Data analysis has been the next gold rush for the past decade and a half with Facebook, Google, Amazon, Oracle, AdTech, Medical Research, and other companies using the data to streamline operations, manufacturing, production, research, and sales.  \n\n*Punishing Palantir for witchcraft is akin to fearing doctors because bloodletting used to be a thing.*\n\n**Palantir is going to the moon first** before everyone else cuz they were fucking *tits deep* in this stuff since 2004.  And they'll continue to be tits deep before anyone even gets balls deep.\n\nIt's like Tesla and electric vehicles.  \n\nOnly now is GM (Nikola lol), Ford (Rivian), and other manufacturers trying to get in.  But Tesla's bottom up approach, listening to consumers, is destroying all the other car manufacturers (because traditional big AF car companies do a top down approach by having marketing teams making assumptions of what consumers really care about).\n\nUltimately, we don't need to shill WSB to get people to invest, we're already doing that.  What is important is to help \"Main street\" understand the implications.  Palantir has a bipartisan pass.  AOC is raising concerns, but is doing it for clout.  If she was in a presidential position, she'd be riding the PLTR Train to the moon too.\n\nPLTR doesn't need rockets to get to the moon.  They built the fucking railroad to get there.\n\n\\--\n\n\\*because I keep calling it an IPO by accident when it was a direct listing",

Snowflake is replacing datawarehouse and data lake at our work. Most apache projects need lot of infra support understanding of things that make adoption and maintenance a nightmare. Snowflake is after growth so they are spending huge on sales and marketing. Additionally, check data sharing and data marketplace features of snowflake. Those allow data sharing between companies without etl. Marketplace allows companies to sell data to others using snowflake cloud. The revenue from this could be huge similar to app store.

If they do go fabless like AMD, I'd expect them to go down pretty quick.  It's the reason why they're able to get such high margins, it's what their entire design process is built around, and it's likely what's allowing them to maintain market share while AMD and NVidia face supply shortages.  However, you do raise a good point about ongoing costs.\n\nFab Under-utilitization.  Seems like they've gotten a ton of product out of 14 nm, to the point that it's become a running joke.  I heard your point about them not selling space to other companies, but this seems to be partially because nobody wants that space.  TSMC is the fab everybody goes to because they're not producing their own products, Intel has no such claims.\n\nToxic Culture - I've also heard the rumors, but having worked for a number of big companies there always seems to be the same old rumors.  MSFT, Oracle, etc have all had the same things said about them, and they continue to be successful.  Steve Jobs is like the prototypical toxic boss, waking people up at 3 am when they're sleeping under their desks to tell them their shit sucks.  Truth is that in a large enough company there's always going to be disgruntled employees, toxic bosses, and drama.\n\nI missed their CES, but I'll give you this point and the server loss.  I've heard enough about mix ups, and apparent bad communication between marketing and engineering.\n\nI'll also agree with you that this idea of the \"Great Man\" fixing things seems to be pretty dumb.  I don't think CEOs have anywhere near the impact people thing they do, any more than I think Jim Keller was going to do something amazing for them, or Bob Swan was the origin of all their problems.  Just not possible to have a large impact in an organization of 100K employees.\n\nAny particular reason for the 25-50% prediction?  Seems like it's already priced in with people arguing that NVidia and AMD are fair value.  If INTC traded at those same valuations, they would be a $255 per share company.  Even just trading at 25x P/E like, say Texas Instruments would double their price.",

But, let me follow up with insight from my buddy who's in \"the field\" in a manner of speaking. Palantir is doing two things that are untouched at the moment. First, he says that as a contracting agency is doing their own background research on their own needs, Palantir is at the table and listening and constantly sculpting their product to meet that demand. This means that when an RFP comes out that Palantir already has the product ready and tailored for the need. That's one great advantage. Second, Palantir is eliminating the need to hire a secondary \"integrator\". In layman's terms, their competitors like Salesforce and Oracle and so on only sell the client a license to use the software. This means that you need to hire an external consulting firm to integrate (tailor) the product to the contracting agency's demands. Palantir eliminates this middle man (integrator) entirely. He says that the product and service that Palantir offers is more expensive than their competitors, but there they offer the product at a much lower effort level than anyone else. These are two things you won't really find elsewhere in the forums.",
