There are very few companies affect by that \"ban\" (which was a bipartisan bill lead by Democrats after investigations started by the Obama administration, lol). Further, AMAT, LRCX, and MU, and others have had exemptions the whole time.     \n      \nChina owns Taiwan, numbnuts. Taiwan is China, anything done in or by Taiwan is an action China can exploit.     \n      \nTSMC building a fab in the US is a good thing, and had the TTP passed, it would have happened ages ago. But, an even better thing would have been any US company building that fab. That didn't happen because Trump/GOP are too dumb to see that semis are the future of military dominance. China gets that; it's why they are blatantly stealing everyone's tech and subsidizing the ever-living shit out of their semis industry.     \n       \nFoxconn moving into India is also bad, dumbass, because it means that's not a US company gaining market share there either. It's further expansion of CCP's ability to steal more tech.     \n       \nAlso, yes, mining is a huge issue that Trump has also failed to solve in the US. In fact, his tariffs have hurt mining companies by significantly increasing their costs while also cutting away a massive chunk of their buyers. Lol. You are a massive idiot who clearly doesn't know shit about any of this. Lmfao, you election trolls are so dumb it's truly amazing.",
