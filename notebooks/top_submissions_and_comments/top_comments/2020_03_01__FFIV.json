Shit like that can take down the entire company, which means your money will get lost as well, even if you weren't trading. FINRA will shutter companies that can't ensure they are financially viable.\n\nBrokerages like Interactive Brokers are the real deal. Even E-trade, Fidelity, TD Ameritrade, etc have been through the dotcom crash, 2009 crash, flash crash in 2010, etc. Although I had trouble logging into Fidelity a few times, which is why I'm on Etrade now.\n\nBut if you want reliability, especially in really bad times, you go with a real brokerage that has seen some shit. Robinhood is obviously unreliable but something like Webull will be even worse, so you would be stupid to migrate to them if you're unhappy with Robinhood.",
