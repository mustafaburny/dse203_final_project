The Dow should've bounced back better this week but there are plenty of reasons why it arguably was not the story this week (same with the S&amp;P).\n\nAnd if we're heading into a December 2018 like situation, then a lot of the big guns better get moving on going lower. Apple didn't close below $160 and Google is still a fair bit higher than its October swing low.",
