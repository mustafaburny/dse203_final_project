I had 3 acquaintances from school I haven't spoken to in over a decade message me asking about /r/wallstreetbets and GME.  \n  \nCorporations everywhere are re-assessing risk management because of what you started. This has now become a global phenomenon, and it can all be tracked back to that summer of 2019 when you were laughed off this very board by everyone. I became a believer in July 2020 and even though I don't have a big position in GME, every single day I cheer you on, along with the millions of retards here.  \n  \nYou will be a part of many MBA in Finance courses my dude. The guy who brought down multibillion dollar hedge funds and star hedge fund managers. Hedge funds, despite their deep pockets, will think twice before naked shorting or trying to bankrupt companies in the future.    \n  \nAND YOU ARE STILL FUCKING IN IT!  \n  \nThe day when your update is all cash and no GME is when I sell my GME. Only you can pry away my 90 shares of gME from my cold, dead hands!  \n  \nOh and fuck my wife please. That would be much appreciated",

Join a class action lawsuit against Robinhood to leverage the losses from the day you couldn't buy GME. Document evidence of owning GME (it will be in your Robinhood history), or any intent of it such as on Reddit about your intent to buy stocks before they locked trading.

        "body": "Explanation to hopefully stop panic selling:\n\nFunds can sell of shares at progressively lower lots to \u201ctap\u201d down prices. And GME enthusiasts may be buying them as a conviction play (it may seem like we are helping ourselves buying here, but it plays into the short strategy...buying but as long as we hold it\u2019s only a temporary decrease in SP). Imagine I have 1 million shares and I sell them in lots of 10,000 each lot $10 cheaper than the next. If people buy, I\u2019ve lowered the stock price  by $100 effectively. It\u2019s a classic short move.\n\nIf you don\u2019t think Melvin and Shitron and the funds that propped them up aren\u2019t calling in favors like this right now you\u2019re living in fantasy land.\n\nSo for a small amount of shares you can take the price of the stock. It\u2019s only going to save shorts though if once the stock is down everyone panics and sells at the new, lower price. If people hold the line, the stock may be down but shorts will have no one to buy shares to cover from, and the shares they used to drop the price will be exhausted. The volume typically tells the tale of a bear raid. There\u2019s no way this is going to work- I feel like this plus the shutdown of wallstreetbets is just going to infuriate GME shareholders more to where holding is a moral issue. Shorts are likely fucked\n\nPlease share and upvote this for god sakes so people don\u2019t think everyone else selling out and giving up!!!!

        "body": "30 Seconds From Triggering Market Nuclear Bomb\n\nI'm glad this place has quieted down enough for some actual DD written by a monkey with a keyboard and Adderall.\n\nDisclaimer: I am that monkey.  Let me explain to you what happened, play by play.  I will give you illiterates who hate reading a spoiler up front:\n\nWe were within approximately 30 seconds of triggering a nuclear bomb that would have blown up the market. Do I have your attention?  Here goes:\n\n1.\t\u2060\u2060Yesterday, new call option strike prices were added all the way up to $570.  Do I have to go over gamma squeezes again?  Really?  We've been over this: when deep out-of-the-money call options start being gobbled up and the price starts moving towards being in-the-money, the call writers have to hedge their risk of having their sold calls exercised, typically by buying stock.  This creates upwards pressure on the market.  We've been seeing these movements all week.\n2.\t\u2060\u2060Yesterday after market, you probably saw that coordinated effort to drive the price down and spook retail investors into a mass sell-off.  It didn't work.\n3.\t\u2060\u2060Last night, Robinhood sent out a message to users: you could no longer enter into new options.  You could exercise them if you had the collateral (money in the account) to do so.  Very interesting and the first sign of pants-shitting fear.\n4.\t\u2060\u2060Today, the market opened very strong.  It opened so strong that we were looking at a self-perpetuating gamma squeeze all the way up way past $570.\n5.\t\u2060\u2060At approximately 9:58 am, the stock had reached $468 in a parabolic move.\n6.\t\u2060\u2060Two minutes earlier, at 9:56 am, Robinhood tweeted that they were not allowing users to buy GME stock, but they would allow selling.\n7.\t\u2060\u2060The trend instantly halted and started a collapse downwards, before picking up a bit, especially after some retail was allowed back in.\n\nOkay, now that you are clear on the facts, understand this: The market ran out of liquidity today, or was threatening to get close enough that they killed it.  What does that mean?  It means they ran out of shares and/or capital. They wouldn't let you buy new shares because we were burning through all the shares on the market.\n\nI saw an unsubstantiated post from a user who said a small sell limit order executed at $2600 for him.  Do you get the severity of the situation, if that's true? It means the buying was getting to the point where it was just about to put INFINITE pressure on the price of the shares.  It means virtually any ask was getting bid.\n\nHow do you get infinite upwards pressure?  A gamma squeeze triggering the mother of all short squeezes, just like we predicted.  The call writers need shares to hedge.  Retail is still buying more.  The short sellers need over 100% of the float back.  Add these together.  There were more shares needed than existed on the open market.  That's what a liquidity crisis is.\n\nListen to this to this remarkable (if infuriating) interview where the chairman of Interactive Brokers admits that they didn't have the capital to pay out the winners (us), so they took their ball and went home.  DO YOU GRASP HOW INSANE IT IS THAT HE SAID THEY NEEDED TO SHUT DOWN BUY ORDERS TO \"PROTECT THE MARKET\"? Hello!  He's not talking about the market for GME shares.  He's talking about the entire market!  The New York Stock Exchange.  The NASDAQ.  All that.\n\nRemember the movie Snowpiercer?  Do you remember that scene where the lower class people realize the soldiers who oppress them have no bullets?  Go to the 1:00 minute mark of this link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EH1EtiOhr6o\n\nIt kick starts a full blown rebellion.  They have no bullets.  It's the exact same in this market:  No capital.  No shares.  Infinite losses inbound.\n\nTL;DR: For all you who will just skip to the bottom to ask, \"Do I get my tendies now?\" the answer is this: they NEED NEED NEED your shares.  Do you get that?  HOLD.  Like the guy in the movie, scream, \"They're out of bullets!\" and create a stampede.  That's how we win.\n\nThey needed your shares so badly that they literally risked PRISON TIME to get them.  They tried robbing you, and I'm not even exaggerating.  They were within 30 seconds of all being wiped out today.\n\nCredit: u/PlayFree_Bird",

The only thing that is guaranteed mathematically is that the shorts will have to cover at some point in the future.

And how they're going to try and break our subreddit during the weekend.\n\n**Way to go, monke.**\n\nWho would have thought we would close Friday with a volume less than [1/4 of last week's](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics?p=GME)? (for us monke, this means everyone is \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c ).\n\nWho would have thought we'd get the stock over 320$ when they manipulated by colluding, limiting our buying power artificially and laddering the price down to 170$ the day before?\n\nEvery single day we \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c , they lose. They lose BIG, so big their wife's boyfriends have kicked them out and sold their lambos. [A 70 BILLION loss](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-retail-trading-shortbets/losses-on-short-positions-in-u-s-firms-top-70-billion-ortex-data-idUSKBN29X1SW).\n\n**Now, this is how they try and bend us over the weekend.**\n\nThey've already lost, what do they have left? To minimize losses. We know all the shit they tried already, so what's going to happen now? **They're doubling down on dilluting this community.**\n\nSorting by new is an absolute disgrace by now and should just be ignored, but some of the post even reach rising. Here's what I've found so far and what even a monke with a smooth brain understands:\n\n\u00b7They've covered their shorts: No. Fucking. Way. They were at [5.91b$ two days ago (139%)](https://twitter.com/S3Partners/status/1354470406934167560). They were [11.2b$ (113%) yesterday](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355249817048522755). And the short volume ratio [has maintained the same the past two weeks](https://fintel.io/ss/us/gme). They're repositioning their shorts. The short interest ratio % will be reduced and the total ammount will continue to increase as we drive the stock price up.\n\n\u00b7$BRUCE is the new $GME.\n\nPART 1: I understand how you feel, you thought you diversified [and then you realized their charts are identical](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l82vi1/gme_with_amc_and_bb_overlay_virtually_identical/). Being smoothbrained does that to you, believe me I know. What does having two identical charts with different DDs mean? [I did some explaining in this reply](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l87d25/amc_short_squeeze_is_absolutely_possible_to_and/glbjsh0?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3). TL;DR: dilluting our funds is the worst fucking thing we can do right now, especially when we have two (almost) identical stocks and GME has a way higher potential of short squeezeng to infinity (based on the ammount of short interest, float and the upwards movement caused by social media clout the past week).\n\nPART 2: $FUCKU (who no one is talking about) is going the new $GME, guys, *\"listen up this is the most important DD you will ever read.\"*. Fuck off, please. Same as above with less spice, tired of read half-assed DDs in the middle of the stock movement of the century.\n\n\u00b7Fearmongering, in general. I'm tired of these posts. You sound like your wife's boyfriend left even her because the weakness of your \ud83e\uddfb \ud83d\ude4c is unbearable.

There are still people paper handing and people that think GME is too risky whereas others are diamond handing and think of GME as a long term play than a short squeeze. All these statements like \"we need to be taken seriously now\" or \"we control the market\", \"new money &gt; old money\" paints wsb in a negative light and it's just not true at all. People told DFV to sell all along the way to what he has now and he had a choice. Just because someone tells you to sell or buy you don't have to follow through.

        "body": "I'm glad this place has quieted down enough for some actual DD written by a monkey with a keyboard and Adderall. Disclaimer: I am that monkey. Let me explain to you what happened, play by play. I will give you illiterates who hate reading a spoiler up front: We were within approximately 30 seconds of triggering a nuclear bomb that would have blown up the market. Do I have your attention? Here goes:\n\nYesterday, new call option strike prices were added all the way up to $570. Do I have to go over gamma squeezes again? Really? We've been over this: when deep out-of-the-money call options start being gobbled up and the price starts moving towards being in-the-money, the call writers have to hedge their risk of having their sold calls exercised, typically by buying stock. This creates upwards pressure on the market. We've been seeing these movements all week.\n\nYesterday after market, you probably saw that coordinated effort to drive the price down and spook retail investors into a mass sell-off. It didn't work.\n\nLast night, Robinhood sent out a message to users: you could no longer enter into new options. You could exercise them if you had the collateral (money in the account) to do so. Very interesting and the first sign of pants-shitting fear.\n\nToday, the market opened very strong. It opened so strong that we were looking at a self-perpetuating gamma squeeze all the way up way past $570.\n\nAt approximately 9:58 am, the stock had reached $468 in a parabolic move.\n\nTwo minutes earlier, at 9:56 am, Robinhood tweeted that they were not allowing users to buy GME stock, but they would allow selling.\n\nThe trend instantly halted and started a collapse downwards, before picking up a bit, especially after some retail was allowed back in.\n\nOkay, now that you are clear on the facts, understand this: The market ran out of liquidity today, or was threatening to get close enough that they killed it. What does that mean? It means they ran out of shares and/or capital. They wouldn't let you buy new shares because we were burning through all the shares on the market. I saw an unsubstantiated post from a user who said a small sell limit order executed at $2600 for him. Do you get the severity of the situation, if that's true? It means the buying was getting to the point where it was just about to put INFINITE pressure on the price of the shares. It means virtually any ask was getting bid.\n\nHow do you get infinite upwards pressure? A gamma squeeze triggering the mother of all short squeezes, just like we predicted. The call writers need shares to hedge. Retail is still buying more. The short sellers need over 100% of the float back. Add these together. There were more shares needed than existed on the open market. That's what a liquidity crisis is.\n\nListen to this remarkable (if infuriating) interview where the chairman of Interactive Brokers admits that they didn't have the capital to pay out the winners (us), so they took their ball and went home. DO YOU GRASP HOW INSANE IT IS THAT HE SAID THEY NEEDED TO SHUT DOWN BUY ORDERS TO \"PROTECT THE MARKET\"? Hello! He's not talking about the market for GME shares. He's talking about the entire market! The New York Stock Exchange. The NASDAQ. All that.\n\nRemember the movie Snowpiercer? Do you remember that scene where the lower class people realize the soldiers who oppress them have no bullets? Go to the 1:00 minute mark of this link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EH1EtiOhr6o\n\nIt kick starts a full blown rebellion. They have no bullets. It's the exact same in this market: No capital. No shares. Infinite losses inbound.\n\nTL;DR: For all you who will just skip to the bottom to ask, \"Do I get my tendies now?\" the answer is this: they NEED NEED NEED your shares. Do you get that? HOLD. Like the guy in the movie, scream, \"They're out of bullets!\" and create a stampede. That's how we win.\n\nThey needed your shares so badly that they literally risked PRISON TIME to get them. They tried robbing you, and I'm not even exaggerating. They were within 30 seconds of all being wiped out today.",

The reality of the situation is Robinhood does NOT have the liquidity or capital to support buys any further due to their clearing house being in house and run by baling wire and dreams. Their owners have a vested interest in ensuring they don't make the collateral demanded by the DTC to move the cash required.\n\nSo here's the fucking rub. There are two CONFIRMED brokers that will do anything in their fucking power to ensure we trade as much as we fucking want. They are...\n\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80Fidelity and Vanguard\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80. You want to know why? They both own millions of shares in GME, do you think they won't do whatever they absolutely can to ensure collateral is covered on GME? They are profiting hardcore off of this. We NEED to be throwing their weight behind them, they are the ONLY future we have if we need to be backing this stock as retail.\n\nThis weekend, we need to push harder than we ever have before to educate people on this reality. Robinhood is bush league shit for processing this kind of demand, and it's time we take it to the big boys like Fidelity and Vanguard to handle the rest of this.\n\nTLDR: Robinhood CANNOT SUPPORT OUR VOLUME. The ONLY brokers right now are Vanguard and Fidelity because they OWN GME SHARES. This is PERFECT for us. Their clearing houses will flip fucking gravity to keep us trading.

They provide deep insight with plenty of url references for you to check out the source material for yourself.\n\nTwo Part Video Series (18 min total) about the SEC's Investigation Of Naked Shorting Of Sedona. A case study on how naked short sellers have destroyed hundreds and hundreds of publicly traded companies. He then goes on to explain how this can go on to effect the broader market:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH5cMQLJRUo&amp;t=8s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH5cMQLJRUo&amp;t=8s)\n\nNine part (Approx 80 min total) series about the corruption of our capital markets due to naked short selling and \"failures to deliver\". He goes over a number of topics just as FTD's (Failures to deliver), how prevalent they are, how long they can last for and the risk they pose to the financial system. He also talks about the DTCC and it's role in clearing money and shares through the market and how it has a history of downplaying the amount of FTD's. Just watch the first (5 min) video and you'll be hooked:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpWzOjB8qtU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpWzOjB8qtU)\n\nIf you didn't watch the above series at least watch part 5 where he explains how the entire market could collapse as a result of a short squeeze on a heavily naked shorted stock:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKc0KQvvfWE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKc0KQvvfWE)\n\n&lt;1 min Video of SEC Chairman stumbling over his words as he answers the question \"do you know of the possibility of short selling taking down Bear Stearns\":\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acKWiE\\_rKXk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acKWiE_rKXk)\n\nVideo explaining how someone bought WAYYY OTM weekly puts on Bear Stearns the day before Bear Stearns started tanking due to over ten million illegal naked short sells and how this started the Global Financial Crisis:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUKSU1qahgE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUKSU1qahgE)\n\nPart 2 of the above video where he goes over the SEC's lack of response to the naked short selling of Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcjssQSthNU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcjssQSthNU)\n\nPart 3 about how hundreds of millions of naked short sales of Lehman Brothers stock put the final nail in the coffin of the company causing the GFC. The SEC did nothing. Hedge fund managers like Jim Chanos and Steve Cohen have too much money and power to ever be prosecuted:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q48eSoTNByQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q48eSoTNByQ)\n\n3 Min Video of a debate on Bloomberg where this Wall Street guy is arguing that short sellers should be able to sell short at will and should never have to actually borrow shares to be able to short:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oerYirYVFE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oerYirYVFE)\n\nThe Bear raid on Overstock.com and the journalists that enabled it (10 min):\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHQeZ9czrKc&amp;t=4s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHQeZ9czrKc&amp;t=4s)\n\nCase study: In the final days of selling of Lehman Brothers stock there we over 150M failures to delivery naked shares sold short when the stock was selling for about $0.10. Imagine LEH ended up not going bankrupt. Imagine something happened and the price suddenly rebounded dramatically. These 150M naked shorts would be caught with their pants down and it would get bloody. The amount it would cost the financial system is the actual number of shares out there x the mean price those shareholders are willing to sell them for (knowing they have the buyers bent over a barrel). There have only ever been 71M shares of GME issued but institutions claim they own 102M shares of GME so how many shares are out there? Lets guess there are actually 200M shares out there and the average shareholder sells for $1000. That's $200B. If there is 333M shares and a $3000 share price that's $1T off of a measly $1B company that naked short sellers got greedy on. Who's going to foot this bill?\n\nTLDR; We're probably not even buying and selling actual shares of GME. When it looked like GME was \"on the ropes\" and there was a good narrative of why they should go bankrupt naked short sellers likely naked short sold an unknowable amount of fake \"IOU\" shares of GME because they thought it would for sure go bankrupt. This plan has worked for them hundreds and hundreds of times in the past making them hundreds of billions or even trillions of dollars. Some high profile examples include: Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. When these sharks smell blood in the water nothing is stopping them from naked short selling tens of millions of fake shares (over 100M in the last three days of Lehman Brothers) to innocent buyers who think they're getting a good deal which ultimately go to zero and equate to an infinite profit margin for the short sellers. What they didn't expect with GME was a bunch of retards doing what we've done over the past months and exposing their fraudulent naked short selling. We have no way to be certain how many shares are actually out there but [/u/johnnydaggers](https://www.reddit.com/u/johnnydaggers/) post shows there was 1.7M shares failed to deliver in December (before shit even hit the fan). The thing is this threatens to undermine the publics confidence in the entire system. How do we know that the shares that we think we are purchasing are actually legit? We could literally being paying good money for something that doesn't actually exist. What this means for GME is someone is going to have to step up and actually pay up for all of these phantom shares that aren't even supposed to exist. What price they will pay nobody knows.",

        "body": "For anyone watching the GME situation (all of us?), consider these relevant points and taking the relevant actions:\n\n 1. Big money is MORTIFIED and the retaliation is completely unprecedented: coordinated attacks, willingness to risk prison over financial loss, concealing data, etc. They're shaking because we're holding GME. Despite any other lack of information available, this may be the best signal for why you should hold. Period.\n\n 2. After the massive GME rise, there was a LOT of bot activity trying to distract, dissuade, etc. They're poisoning the well, and it's difficult to know what can be trusted and what can't. The one thing we DEFINITELY know, however, is that all of those attacks are being done to make us sell GME and spin the narrative that the complicit agents are victims / good guys.\n\n 3. Robinhood + Citadel are trying to spin a BS narrative. If your institution can't afford something, shut everything down equally and go bankrupt. Choosing a specific stock to shut down is perhaps the most egregiously corrupt action ever taken in the market (which is saying A LOT). YOU weren't allowed to buy when major funds were, especially at CRITICAL times with CRITICAL buying opportunities to protect Citadel + big money and it collectively cost us tens of billions in lost opportunity. They're being sued, and rightfully so, but laws need to change to ruthlessly punish them NOW. Contact your representatives, SEC, etc. if you haven't already.\n\n 4. Hedges might lie about their short positions, or restrict visibility as much as possible. They can break laws and face negligible fees by comparison to the rest of what they stand to lose. Therefore, it's reasonable to assume they might do this among many other PR stunts to terrify you. Keep updated. Someone pointed out that iborrowdesk is no longer reporting on updated gme because, again, the legal consequences don't matter enough and they're protecting their interests. Refer to #1.\n\n 5. We don't know WHEN short positions will be covered, only the math that requires them to cover as we move forward. So if they delay and everyone gives in, they could save a lot of money. However, the longer they delay, the more they have to pay. So it's a matter of whether or not they double down and face higher risk/reward or not. Be prepared to WAIT.\n\n 6. If you set visible limits, the hedge funds can use this data to their advantage and potentially have attack vectors against us. However, if you don't set limits, you might miss out on major trading spikes when they happen. The selfless act is to avoid low limits, but the ultimate goal is to distribute wealth to the people so take if you're the people who need it.\n\n 7. If you're angry at Robinhood, move accounts AFTER this is over so that you're not frozen. Also, DO NOT transfer to your bank, because that will trigger a tax event. You're supposed to transfer between brokers. Look into this further yourself, since I'm not a tax expert.\n\n 8. If you're angry at Google for removing negative Robinhood accounts, use Ecosia instead. They're just as user friendly, effective, and they give 80% of their profits to green energy and planting trees. Google will lose hundreds or thousands of dollars per year from your ad revenue and data collection.\n\n 9. It's hard to anticipate what other stunts will be pulled to try to screw us over. Contact your representatives, particularly those in finance committees and demand REAL consequences for this criminal behavior. This matters.\n\nYou're welcome to exchange this info freely if you find it useful. I am not a financial advisor, yadda yadda, you know the drill.",

        "body": "Explanation to hopefully stop panic selling:\n\nFunds can sell of shares at progressively lower lots to \u201ctap\u201d down prices. And GME enthusiasts may be buying them as a conviction play (it may seem like we are helping ourselves buying here, but it plays into the short strategy...buying but as long as we hold it\u2019s only a temporary decrease in SP). Imagine I have 1 million shares and I sell them in lots of 10,000 each lot $10 cheaper than the next. If people buy, I\u2019ve lowered the stock price  by $100 effectively. It\u2019s a classic short move.\n\nIf you don\u2019t think Melvin and Shitron and the funds that propped them up aren\u2019t calling in favors like this right now you\u2019re living in fantasy land.\n\nSo for a small amount of shares you can take the price of the stock. It\u2019s only going to save shorts though if once the stock is down everyone panics and sells at the new, lower price. If people hold the line, the stock may be down but shorts will have no one to buy shares to cover from, and the shares they used to drop the price will be exhausted. The volume typically tells the tale of a bear raid. There\u2019s no way this is going to work- I feel like this plus the shutdown of wallstreetbets is just going to infuriate GME shareholders more to where holding is a moral issue. Shorts are likely fucked\n\nPlease share and upvote this for god sakes so people don\u2019t think everyone else selling out and giving up!!!! Please someone who can post copy and post this I don\u2019t want credit I just don\u2019t want the little guy to lose!\n\nFYI I work in healthcare and have 6 figures in student loan debt and I\u2019m finally making enough $ from you retards that makes me think one day I might pay off.

        "body": "30 Seconds From Triggering Market Nuclear Bomb\n\nI'm glad this place has quieted down enough for some actual DD written by a monkey with a keyboard and Adderall.\n\nDisclaimer: I am that monkey.  Let me explain to you what happened, play by play.  I will give you illiterates who hate reading a spoiler up front:\n\nWe were within approximately 30 seconds of triggering a nuclear bomb that would have blown up the market. Do I have your attention?  Here goes:\n\n1.\t\u2060\u2060Yesterday, new call option strike prices were added all the way up to $570.  Do I have to go over gamma squeezes again?  Really?  We've been over this: when deep out-of-the-money call options start being gobbled up and the price starts moving towards being in-the-money, the call writers have to hedge their risk of having their sold calls exercised, typically by buying stock.  This creates upwards pressure on the market.  We've been seeing these movements all week.\n2.\t\u2060\u2060Yesterday after market, you probably saw that coordinated effort to drive the price down and spook retail investors into a mass sell-off.  It didn't work.\n3.\t\u2060\u2060Last night, Robinhood sent out a message to users: you could no longer enter into new options.  You could exercise them if you had the collateral (money in the account) to do so.  Very interesting and the first sign of pants-shitting fear.\n4.\t\u2060\u2060Today, the market opened very strong.  It opened so strong that we were looking at a self-perpetuating gamma squeeze all the way up way past $570.\n5.\t\u2060\u2060At approximately 9:58 am, the stock had reached $468 in a parabolic move.\n6.\t\u2060\u2060Two minutes earlier, at 9:56 am, Robinhood tweeted that they were not allowing users to buy GME stock, but they would allow selling.\n7.\t\u2060\u2060The trend instantly halted and started a collapse downwards, before picking up a bit, especially after some retail was allowed back in.\n\nOkay, now that you are clear on the facts, understand this: The market ran out of liquidity today, or was threatening to get close enough that they killed it.  What does that mean?  It means they ran out of shares and/or capital. They wouldn't let you buy new shares because we were burning through all the shares on the market.\n\nI saw an unsubstantiated post from a user who said a small sell limit order executed at $2600 for him.  Do you get the severity of the situation, if that's true? It means the buying was getting to the point where it was just about to put INFINITE pressure on the price of the shares.  It means virtually any ask was getting bid.\n\nHow do you get infinite upwards pressure?  A gamma squeeze triggering the mother of all short squeezes, just like we predicted.  The call writers need shares to hedge.  Retail is still buying more.  The short sellers need over 100% of the float back.  Add these together.  There were more shares needed than existed on the open market.  That's what a liquidity crisis is.\n\nListen to this to this remarkable (if infuriating) interview where the chairman of Interactive Brokers admits that they didn't have the capital to pay out the winners (us), so they took their ball and went home.  DO YOU GRASP HOW INSANE IT IS THAT HE SAID THEY NEEDED TO SHUT DOWN BUY ORDERS TO \"PROTECT THE MARKET\"? Hello!  He's not talking about the market for GME shares.  He's talking about the entire market!  The New York Stock Exchange.  The NASDAQ.  All that.\n\nRemember the movie Snowpiercer?  Do you remember that scene where the lower class people realize the soldiers who oppress them have no bullets?  Go to the 1:00 minute mark of this link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EH1EtiOhr6o\n\nIt kick starts a full blown rebellion.  They have no bullets.  It's the exact same in this market:  No capital.  No shares.  Infinite losses inbound.\n\nTL;DR: For all you who will just skip to the bottom to ask, \"Do I get my tendies now?\" the answer is this: they NEED NEED NEED your shares.  Do you get that?  HOLD.  Like the guy in the movie, scream, \"They're out of bullets!\" and create a stampede.  That's how we win.\n\nThey needed your shares so badly that they literally risked PRISON TIME to get them.  They tried robbing you, and I'm not even exaggerating.  They were within 30 seconds of all being wiped out today.\n\nCredit: u/PlayFree_Bird",

All these statements like \"we need to be taken seriously now\" or \"we control the market\", \"new money &gt; old money\" paints wsb in a negative light and it's just not true at all. People told DFV to sell all along the way to what he has now and he had a choice. Just because someone tells you to sell or buy you don't have to follow through. Everyone here is free to do their own analysis and make their own decisions.",

        "body": "I'm glad this place has quieted down enough for some actual DD written by a monkey with a keyboard and Adderall. Disclaimer: I am that monkey. Let me explain to you what happened, play by play. I will give you illiterates who hate reading a spoiler up front: We were within approximately 30 seconds of triggering a nuclear bomb that would have blown up the market. Do I have your attention? Here goes:\n\nYesterday, new call option strike prices were added all the way up to $570. Do I have to go over gamma squeezes again? Really? We've been over this: when deep out-of-the-money call options start being gobbled up and the price starts moving towards being in-the-money, the call writers have to hedge their risk of having their sold calls exercised, typically by buying stock. This creates upwards pressure on the market. We've been seeing these movements all week.\n\nYesterday after market, you probably saw that coordinated effort to drive the price down and spook retail investors into a mass sell-off. It didn't work.\n\nLast night, Robinhood sent out a message to users: you could no longer enter into new options. You could exercise them if you had the collateral (money in the account) to do so. Very interesting and the first sign of pants-shitting fear.\n\nToday, the market opened very strong. It opened so strong that we were looking at a self-perpetuating gamma squeeze all the way up way past $570.\n\nAt approximately 9:58 am, the stock had reached $468 in a parabolic move.\n\nTwo minutes earlier, at 9:56 am, Robinhood tweeted that they were not allowing users to buy GME stock, but they would allow selling.\n\nThe trend instantly halted and started a collapse downwards, before picking up a bit, especially after some retail was allowed back in.\n\nOkay, now that you are clear on the facts, understand this: The market ran out of liquidity today, or was threatening to get close enough that they killed it. What does that mean? It means they ran out of shares and/or capital. They wouldn't let you buy new shares because we were burning through all the shares on the market. I saw an unsubstantiated post from a user who said a small sell limit order executed at $2600 for him. Do you get the severity of the situation, if that's true? It means the buying was getting to the point where it was just about to put INFINITE pressure on the price of the shares. It means virtually any ask was getting bid.\n\nHow do you get infinite upwards pressure? A gamma squeeze triggering the mother of all short squeezes, just like we predicted. The call writers need shares to hedge. Retail is still buying more. The short sellers need over 100% of the float back. Add these together. There were more shares needed than existed on the open market. That's what a liquidity crisis is.\n\nListen to this remarkable (if infuriating) interview where the chairman of Interactive Brokers admits that they didn't have the capital to pay out the winners (us), so they took their ball and went home. DO YOU GRASP HOW INSANE IT IS THAT HE SAID THEY NEEDED TO SHUT DOWN BUY ORDERS TO \"PROTECT THE MARKET\"? Hello! He's not talking about the market for GME shares. He's talking about the entire market! The New York Stock Exchange. The NASDAQ. All that.\n\nRemember the movie Snowpiercer? Do you remember that scene where the lower class people realize the soldiers who oppress them have no bullets? Go to the 1:00 minute mark of this link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EH1EtiOhr6o\n\nIt kick starts a full blown rebellion. They have no bullets. It's the exact same in this market: No capital. No shares. Infinite losses inbound.\n\nTL;DR: For all you who will just skip to the bottom to ask, \"Do I get my tendies now?\" the answer is this: they NEED NEED NEED your shares. Do you get that? HOLD. Like the guy in the movie, scream, \"They're out of bullets!\" and create a stampede. That's how we win.\n\nThey needed your shares so badly that they literally risked PRISON TIME to get them. They tried robbing you, and I'm not even exaggerating. They were within 30 seconds of all being wiped out today.",

They will need to buy it back and repay it.\nEvery dip is just another rise waiting to happen.\nThis is a repost!!!!!!",

And GME enthusiasts may be buying them as a conviction play (it may seem like we are helping ourselves buying here, but it plays into the short strategy...buying but as long as we hold it\u2019s only a temporary decrease in SP). Imagine I have 1 million shares and I sell them in lots of 10,000 each lot $10 cheaper than the next. If people buy, I\u2019ve lowered the stock price  by $100 effectively. It\u2019s a classic short move.\n\n**If you don\u2019t think Melvin and Shitron and the funds that propped them up aren\u2019t calling in favors like this right now you\u2019re living in fucking fantasy land.**\n\nSo for a small amount of shares you can take the price of the stock. It\u2019s only going to save shorts though if once the stock is down everyone panics and sells at the new, lower price.\n\n*If you wake up and see $100 and your heart falls out your pussy and you get paper hands, game over. If you see $100 and instead remember how fucking jazzed you were when it first hit that and hold, you win baby.*\n\nIf people hold the line, the stock may be down but shorts will have no one to buy shares to cover from, and the shares they used to drop the price will be exhausted. The volume typically tells the tale of a bear raid. There\u2019s no way this is going to work- I feel like this plus the shutdown of wallstreetbets is just going to infuriate GME shareholders more to where holding is a moral issue. Shorts are likely fucked\n\nPlease share and upvote this for god sakes so people don\u2019t think everyone else selling out and giving up!!!! Please someone who can post copy and post this I don\u2019t want credit I just don\u2019t want the little guy to lose!\n\nFYI I work in healthcare and have 6 figures in student loan debt and I\u2019m finally making enough $ from you retards that makes me think one day I might pay off.

Wall street is trying to break the rules because retail played fairly, and wall street lost. Is GME worth 200+ dollars? That's for you to decide based on your own value system. For me, there is a lot of value in knowing that having a few shares of this company is causing billionaires and hedge funds to suffer. These people that have juiced our economy for so long with their greed and corruption. \n\nSo what are they doing? They are preventing people from trading while they trade as much as they want to generate price action to get people to panic. They are doubling down on their belief that we are unsophisticated. They are appealing to the SEC to regulate us because they are on the verge of losing an incredible amount of wealth. \n\nThere is a very real chance that if you buy a share today you might lose all that you put into it. But let me ask you this: Is losing $200 worth making these people suffer for the blatant and obvious corrupt behavior they are showing us as I type this? If you can't afford to lose $200 you absolutely should not buy GME. Frankly, I am not a financial advisor of any sort, so if you listen to me you might be an idiot. I'm just another millenial that was raised believing the world was full of opportunity, but even with a degree and full time job in my field I spend 50% of my income on rent. ON RENT. I drive a piece of shit vehicle with 160000 miles on it. I sold 20 of my shares yesterday (don't worry I bought them back on the dip today) and I now have more disposable income that I have ever had in my entire life. \n\nThese people would rather die than let you have any of their money. I am fully prepared to lose everything I have put into GME, and you know what? I will still have more disposable income than ever before because I flipped a quick trade on GME. I am lucky that I was using a broker that let me. If you are still on the fence of whether to buy...well, make your own decision. Do your own due diligence. However, this moment we are witnessing is going to be taught by shitty high school baseball coaches in econ class for decades to come. No matter what happens here, wall street is losing. \n\nPosition: 45 shares. Ride or die bitches\n\nAlso, I realized yesterday that retard is an anagram of trader and I now think you all are geniuses.",

They have no ammo!!!\n\n[https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME)\n\nEDIT2:  \nSO many message coming in:\n\n1. Where to buy: I don't know, read other posts, schwab?TDA? I have no knowledge.\n2. When to buy?when is the dip? THIS IS THE DIP MORONS, it's -28% HOW IS IT NOT THE DIP? BUY NOW!\n3. When to sell? When you see the price going up very crazy like 5x 10x and you see the insane volume being traded. That's when the shorts are covering. might be tomorrow, might be next week. just buy and hold!\n\nmods keep deleting my post!! PIN THIS PLEASE\n\n**What is happening today: Short Ladder Attack, Market Manipulation, Strategy for today and tomorrow, how to not be silenced! \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80**\n\nMy fellow soldiers, I am utterly disgusted by what I am seeing today. I need to write something to get it all out and calm your paper hands.\n\n**What happened**\n\n1. Robinhood, webull, multiple other platforms banned buying shares of our favorite stocks, and a bunch of our stocks. This is clear and definitely market manipulation. They only allow people to sell. Please join the other threads to start a class action and file reports to the SEC! Citadel, Melvin, Point72, Robinhood, Webull, TD Ameritrade, they're all in bed together! They don't want retail investors like us to win and grab their yacht! THIS IS NOT PROHIBITION ERA!\n2. Volume is insanely low, retail traders are sidelined, only hedge funds and institutions are trading. What does this mean? hedge funds are able to set the price since they're the only ones trading!\n3. Short ladder attack. What is this? This is when hedge funds sell their shares repeatedly from hedge fund A to B to trigger the algo thinking there's a massive sell off. Nobody is actually selling the shares! I saw it over the drop from 450 to 230, there is only 3M volume, it's impossible to do so with a free market. What is this meant to do? Rattle retail investors like us, when we see the price dropping like crazy to sell off at whatever price it's at. Guess what? It didn't work! It dropped all the way until 155 and suddenly bounced back to 240 in a second. **You will see this all day and it does not mean anything!!!!**\n4. Why today out of all days? The price went out of control up to 450, if it goes into tomorrow at that price, the gamma squeeze would be insane and it would send us to alpha centauri and beyond!**\ud83d\ude80** **\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80** Triggering the MOASS as well. By lowering the price coming in tomorrow, they can close their positions with lower losses, dampening the squeeze. Proof: [https://imgur.com/BFePDmn](https://imgur.com/BFePDmn) Look at the volume, the ask order book is empty and they drove the price down crazily. Same scenario on all the downward halts.\n\n**Strategy for today and tomorrow**\n\n1. File all the complaints, tweet at whoever will listen (papa elon, king chamath, ryan cohen, list goes on). DO NOT BE SILENCED! bring this to attention of everybody.\n2. Gamma squeeze, with the current prices, gamma squeeze is almost but guaranteed, open interest on this is insane and friday morning the MM will start buying all the shares to hedge their positions. Last chance to strap into this rocket!\n3. Do not sell! Find platforms that allow you to buy and BUY THE DIP. Why buy more you ask when the price is dropping? Because you are taking all their ammo!!! Look at this comparison the 2008 VW Squeeze. They want to dampen the squeeze. [https://imgur.com/9POlMcw](https://imgur.com/9POlMcw)\n\nWe are here, same strategy they employed back then. Didn't work then, will not work today.\n\nTHE ROCKET IS REFUELING BACK AT THE BASE, THIS IS IT, WE HAVE THEM BY THE ROPES!\n\nBUY BUY BUY THE DIPPPP, LIFT OFF IS TOMORROW! GAMMA SQUEEZE IS ALMOST ALL BUT GUARANTEED!!!! CHARGE!!!!\n\nPositions: 1400 shares @ 39, multiple calls in April\n\nDisclaimer: THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE, I REALLY LOVE THE STOCK AND ALL THE GAMESTOP EMPLOYEEES THAT MIGHT LOSE THEIR JOB FROM THIS. SEE YOU IN ALPHA CENTAURI!\n\nTLDR:**\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80** **\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80** **\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80** **\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80** **\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80** **\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80** **\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80** **\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80**",

And GME enthusiasts may be buying them as a conviction play (it may seem like we are helping ourselves buying here, but it plays into the short strategy...buying but as long as we hold it\u2019s only a temporary decrease in SP). Imagine I have 1 million shares and I sell them in lots of 10,000 each lot $10 cheaper than the next. If people buy, I\u2019ve lowered the stock price by $100 effectively. It\u2019s a classic short move.\n\nIf you don\u2019t think Melvin and Shitron and the funds that propped them up aren\u2019t calling in favors like this right now you\u2019re living in fantasy land.\n\nSo for a small amount of shares you can take the price of the stock. It\u2019s only going to save shorts though if once the stock is down everyone panics and sells at the new, lower price. If people hold the line, the stock may be down but shorts will have no one to buy shares to cover from, and the shares they used to drop the price will be exhausted. The volume typically tells the tale of a bear raid. There\u2019s no way this is going to work- I feel like this plus the shutdown of wallstreetbets is just going to infuriate GME shareholders more to where holding is a moral issue. Shorts are likely fucked\n\nPlease share and upvote this for god sakes so people don\u2019t think everyone else selling out and giving up!!!! Please someone who can post copy and post this I don\u2019t want credit I just don\u2019t want the little guy to lose!",

For example you might pull a phone off someone in Iraq at a checkpoint, upload the data, find it has the phone number in the contact list for another phone that was used in a bombing.\n\nStuff like that. It's very useful and the government has tried to replace it _multiple times_ but their attempts are usually not as good and then their funding gets cut after paying hundreds of millions to government contractors.

I learned some of this stuff doing DD prior to the PLTR \\*DPO.\n\nICE actually has two completely separate divisions in what they do in terms of business function/responsibility/jackasses running it: \n\n* HSI, Homeland security investigations, they look for foreign criminals and criminal acts.\n* ERO, Enforcement and Removal Operations, they having nothing better to do than deport people who don't have citizenships.\n\nOriginally the contract was only to support HSI.  They were working on breaking up importation violations w/ CBP, Customs and Border Protection (under the DHS umbrella that ICE also exists under along w/ secret service, OIG, Coast Guard, TSA, FEMA, USCIS) and work w/ local LE to identify people in criminal rings in illegal importation of drugs, non-CARB legal Skyline GT-Rs, Silvias, AE86s, and other drift cars, gang/cartel activity including human trafficking.\n\nERO got a hard-on (erection/sexual arousal) when they found out about Palantir's capabilities and walked over to their HSI buddy cubicles and started shoulder surfing PLTR and eventually just taking over by using the platform for their own investigations.\n\nThis all began under the Obama administration.  So I mean, I get that the United States should be developing best in class stuff so we can keep up with foreign governments.  But it speaks volumes that our administration (bipartisan) would do this kind of BS.\n\nLike China has MiningLamp which is supposed to be a data analytics platform comparable to Palantir.  And now w/ the stolen F35 lightning plans, they have their own facsimile (look up the Shenyang J31).  So \"foreign adversaries\" aka \"foreign trade partners\" are on the same or similar level to us, blame foreign espionage, blame globalism, if humanity was equal in terms of tech and trade, there'd be no problem.\n\nIf we're really pissed off about the comings and goings of the United States' actions, we should dump the assholes in Congress, Senate, and Executive leadership to figure out a way that doesn't involve inciting revolution, installing shill gov'ts, and drone bombing people the opposition to keep a hold on oil.  \n\nData analysis platforms are just going to get more important as the years go by.  Data analysis has been the next gold rush for the past decade and a half with Facebook, Google, Amazon, Oracle, AdTech, Medical Research, and other companies using the data to streamline operations, manufacturing, production, research, and sales.  \n\n*Punishing Palantir for witchcraft is akin to fearing doctors because bloodletting used to be a thing.*\n\n**Palantir is going to the moon first** before everyone else cuz they were fucking *tits deep* in this stuff since 2004.  And they'll continue to be tits deep before anyone even gets balls deep.\n\nIt's like Tesla and electric vehicles.  \n\nOnly now is GM (Nikola lol), Ford (Rivian), and other manufacturers trying to get in.  But Tesla's bottom up approach, listening to consumers, is destroying all the other car manufacturers (because traditional big AF car companies do a top down approach by having marketing teams making assumptions of what consumers really care about).\n\nUltimately, we don't need to shill WSB to get people to invest, we're already doing that.  What is important is to help \"Main street\" understand the implications.  Palantir has a bipartisan pass.  AOC is raising concerns, but is doing it for clout.  If she was in a presidential position, she'd be riding the PLTR Train to the moon too.\n\nPLTR doesn't need rockets to get to the moon.  They built the fucking railroad to get there.\n\n\\--\n\n\\*because I keep calling it an IPO by accident when it was a direct listing",

But, let me follow up with insight from my buddy who's in \"the field\" in a manner of speaking. Palantir is doing two things that are untouched at the moment. First, he says that as a contracting agency is doing their own background research on their own needs, Palantir is at the table and listening and constantly sculpting their product to meet that demand. This means that when an RFP comes out that Palantir already has the product ready and tailored for the need. That's one great advantage. Second, Palantir is eliminating the need to hire a secondary \"integrator\". In layman's terms, their competitors like Salesforce and Oracle and so on only sell the client a license to use the software. This means that you need to hire an external consulting firm to integrate (tailor) the product to the contracting agency's demands. Palantir eliminates this middle man (integrator) entirely. He says that the product and service that Palantir offers is more expensive than their competitors, but there they offer the product at a much lower effort level than anyone else. These are two things you won't really find elsewhere in the forums.",

        "body": "Oh no I'm not trying to shit on you or anything. Again, I agree with the majority of your points. That all is why I'm not already invested in PCPL. However, I still do think it'll rise a good 20-30% leading up to merger just because E2Open has good enough numbers to be believably hype-able. Long term I wouldn't want to be in it overall, but at the same time I'd also rather be in E2Open long term over the majority of companies we've been seeing come out of SPACs recently. Agreed that there's companies more likely to take over their market than them, but I felt as if your initial comment was a little too bearish. E2Open has an uphill battle to break out in their industry, but at the same time I felt as if you were down playing their industry's growth potential a little too much. \n\nUnfortunately an ODS is not quite the cure all that I wish it could be. I can already pull past supplier information pretty easily just with QMF queries, the issue is more putting it together with my company's other data sources since sourcing has to use more than just operational data. There's ways that I could (and do) work around this, but in a macro sense most of my dept doesn't have the SQL skills or willingness to learn them that I might have. Hilariously, I'm slowly turning into a SQL query machine for some of my team. While I enjoy that more than the real shit work, it's inefficient and not what I signed up for. I could design a program to help people do this, which is actually how our main sales scan data software was created (a sales associate got sick of writing queries so he literally made an entire system to do it so people wouldn't ask him), but I know exactly how underappreciated he was for that. Both in a financial and promotional sense within the company...\n\nI think part of what's going on here is that you have a much better grasp than I do of the tech side of E2Open versus their direct or indirect competition, but because I'm in sourcing at a company that already uses Oracle and previously used SAP services, I can tell you that what they can offer us doesn't quite do what we need it to. My company actually completely revamped our data management systems in the past year, but because they couldn't find a good solution in the same timeframe for sourcing (from both incumbent providers and the other bids that got rejected), my dept got a bit left behind. AFAIK the plan is now to find a new provider/service that can do what we need, but my company is a boomer company so these things take longer than they should lol.",

        "body": "You have a lot of good points here, but there's a couple things that are missing. So to explain, I work in corporate sourcing (for those unfamiliar, it's very tied in with supply chain/operations) for a Fortune 100 (we're bigger than that but giving myself some wiggle room to keep my own privacy) company. SAP/Oracle and other related SQL type programs/interfaces are essential for my job, and my company makes use of other software that is comparable to Salesforce. We heavily use PowerBI and other related programs as well. \n\nHowever, all of these tools do not fit perfectly into my or my department's day to day demands. As a result, we waste time and money cobbling together reports from different sources. This is not hyperbole, I quite literally spend more time on most reports cleaning up data and getting different data sets to fit together than actually figuring out what needs to be reported. Now, this wouldn't matter if my dept was small and/or stagnant. That's not the case. The industry I work in (one of the largest in America) isn't going anywhere, but the way the companies within it are approaching their business optimization has changed drastically. Sourcing in particular has exploded and the department at my company was less than half the size a year ago as it is now. This is not just my company being a trendsetter. We're slightly late to the party but by no means at the end of the timing distribution. As the sourcing department grows we'll eventually need truly dedicated software solutions, and a company like E2Open is a prime candidate. The sales teams can use their software or salesforce, HR can use workforce, operations and supply chain can use our current ERP software (though even corporate supply chain employees would probably prefer a sourcing designed software setup), and marketing can use powerbi (mostly, but they also use salesforce), but sourcing truly needs its own software at companies like mine to work efficiently.\n\nNow, I cannot say that my company would choose E2Open, but going with another company to design our systems has been the go to for my company for decades. The existing solutions aren't truly viable as they don't exactly fit what we need. Sure, large companies like SAP or Oracle could rework their systems to fit us, but that takes years and would probably be more expensive than an existing solution.\n\nAdditionally, my company technically isn't even the largest company in our industry, we're second largest in our subset and smaller than 4 or 5 of our indirect competitors. 2 of those larger indirect competitors have their own software for certain, but the others and pretty much every single smaller competitor is in a similar position to my company.\n\nI don't want to say exactly what industry I work in, much less the company, but there is certainly a growing market in some industries that E2Open and similar companies can tap. I don't know if they will, but the potential is there, and honestly we all know that's what most SPAC investors are looking for, potential.",

That in fact is the reason SAP is selling a lot of new systems (S4 Hana). That incidentally also gives them protection against Oracle!\n\nHowever while your points are valid remember from a valuation point E2 will have to win more against entrenched competitors. Their own confidence (they could certainly be lowballing their growth numbers in order to give themselves a lift up) but that will show up in later years if we believe their narrative then 10% growth is what we bake into valuation game and margins being standard I don\u2019t see how we can value them higher than 10-11 range which gives them a valuation of 2.7b grow that at 10%compounded where\u2019s the meat to give uplift? The trick is this is not revolutionary tech but maybe incremental difference that can\u2019t justify a common at 15 and growing - there are better investments out there why not put your money in Infor or SAP or CRM? \n\nThe enterprise application world will grow but at 8-10% what will grow is apps that enable new markets and new clients personalization and all things digital. \n\nThese are my inputs and I know this place I have got a lot in these forums so want to lend my experience to folks who want to make money in tech world - no offense intended we are all here to share our ideas.

Palantir\u2019s bread and butter is their team of devs and engineers who build out the customized components of the platform but at that time it seemed difficult (read: bleeding out shares) to produce a realistic M&amp;O transition to the client. Their previous business model relied heavily on hiring contractors to providing ongoing technical/help desk support with a heavy emphasis on training users, however they are a software company and not a service company so they canned a lot of their professional services when the board realized they were losing too much on the services aspect. \n\nIt\u2019s like a graph database on roids with some geospatial pumps. The current industry/use cases is more focused on finding/connecting people through exposed data. Where they\u2019ve always struggled is with managing data quality as you essentially share the content on your network with everyone else on that network and people are constantly fucking things up like entity resolution (I.e. Dude 1  merges an entity with another entity with a similar name, Dude 2 is posed because this is NOT the same dude and now they need to unfuck the dude cluster. It\u2019s like a graph database on roids with some geospatial capabilities. \n\nCurious as to what you mean by functioning more like Oracle and less like an up and comer?\n\nIt seems like the platform could be changed to tackle different industries such as healthcare (provider/care management), insurance (claims management), and maybe logistics/operations (route optimization). There are other much more established organizations already owning these industries but it still seems scalable for them if they wanted to go that route.",

        "body": "Ok, let's talk about Tesla.\n\nFor the record, I do not own any Tesla stock, nor do I own a Tesla car, nor do I plan to own either in the foreseeable future. (I \\*do\\* own an electric car that I built myself. Love it. Planning to convert my daughter's car soon.)\n\nHere's why I think Tesla's stock value *could* be justified and *may* continue to go up.\n\n1. Tesla is a car company that makes a profit. It's not Amazon. But then, Amazon *didn't* make a profit for a long, long time. Amazon's retail product delivery service still doesn't make a profit. Who could have known that Amazon would beat Microsoft, Oracle, Cisco, Walmart, Akamai and all the others at cloud services? AWS is the meat of Amazon's profits. Who could have predicted this when they were just a book store?\n2. Tesla is also a consumer goods company. Solar power is just the tip of the iceberg. Heat pumps, Smart Homes, Satellite Networking... Yes, it's a tech company -- but it's more than that, it's a *BRAND*. Brand is far more valuable than innovation. The story you sell is more effective than the product you sell, *especially* if it's an also-ran product...\n3. Musk only knows one way to manage -- like a startup. Still going strong, like a start-up, after all these years.\n4. Leverage. Space-X, Boring Co. Tesla and whatever else comes along -- Grid-scale electrical storage? Off-grid self-sufficient housing? Insurance services? They all share tech between them. Tesla's Octo-valve, for instance. Almost certainly was designed by an aerospace engineer at Space-X.\n5. Tesla isn't Apple, or Amazon, or Microsoft. It's more like Java (the programming language) in the late 1990s.  Java didn't do anything better than any other language could do. It was a far worse language than many other more suitable, more mature ones. It failed at its main promise (write once, run anywhere!) Most seasoned programmers laughed at it. They said it wouldn't last. And yet...\n\nSo, forget about the cars. Tesla is a *brand*. It's a consumer technology-goods company that got it's start with cars, like Amazon got its start with books until it found gold in cloud services. Tesla is still digging, currently using a constellation of satellites... It won't end there. That's guaranteed.\n\nHaving said that, keep in mind that any one of IBM, Oracle, Walmart or a dozen others *could* have eaten Amazon's lunch at any time. Amazon was lucky no one tried very hard.",

Institutions hold just 15% of all Bitcoin and we should expect to see that increase dramatically this year.\n* New retail exposure. New demographics of retail buyers now have crypto exposure through easy, established channels like PayPal and Cashapp.\n* Payments use case. PornHub going crypto-only is a big deal IMO. Many people globally don\u2019t have credit cards and cryptocurrency holds the promise of actually increasing the reach of ecommerce. The internet revolutionized content delivery but has always been missing the same level of revolution in payments to complete the cycle. Porn has always been an innovation leader on the Internet, and if the PornHub experiment is successful, it could open the door for others.\n* Gold replacement. Investment banks have issued statements saying their clients are shifting their gold allocation to Bitcoin. Also, a survey of Millenials found that they prefer Bitcoin to gold. As fiat currencies devalue globally, Bitcoin gains.\n\nWe are just getting started and this bull run has a long way to go. I\u2019ve been in crypto professionally since 2013 and IMO we are nowhere close to the next top.",
