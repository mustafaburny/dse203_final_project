When I graduated with my undergrad degree  in biotech 10 years ago the cost to sequence a genome was 10x what it is today.. we now do it for 100x cheaper.. we also have single cell and dropnuqsec the microfluidics tech is amazing for targeted therapeutics. Take the current Pfizer bio tech vaccine and moderna tech was initiated in 2005.. it took a global cataclysmic catastrophe to bring the tech to the forefront. While this tragedy exposed weakness, it also exposed strength.. the possibilities are truly endless.. as a scientist who has struggled for funding (we all have) we\u2019re finally getting the recognition we deserve. The momentum of breakthroughs are only accelerating.. immunotherapeutics, personalized care, telemedicine, metabolic modulation.. the future is very bright.. some highlights would be companies like bluebird biotech that are correcting DMD with crispr technologies, sickle cell anemia, deafness.. there\u2019s risk of course but fortune favors the bold. I for one focus on the interplay of metabolism and it\u2019s effect on health and cardiovascular disease.. Americans aren\u2019t getting any slimmer.. we have enormous problems that we have the ability to fix.. though many admittedly so are those of poverty and societal indifference that will take bold actions from world leaders.. however disruptive tech and medicine will bring a more equitable future to humanity vs driving a wedge of inequality. I firmly agree with the Founder of social capital Chamath Paliphaltya (I think that\u2019s how it\u2019s spelled). Humanity has no choice but to understand the necessity of the coming of age of biotech. Otherwise we as a species will inevitably destroy ourselves.. that was a fun tangent.. long story short.. TL;DR risk is inevitable when you deal with disruptive innovation, however the reward is growth and transformation.",

I noticed is that your net margin is much healthier than those forecasts imply - specifically your SG&amp;A forecasts seem low to me. Across the 3 cases you\u2019re forecasting 16-17% of revenue for SG&amp;A whereas I can\u2019t find a historical quarter where GameStop has kept that figure below 20%. Is this because you believe the console sales don\u2019t require the same marketing spend (ie you\u2019re not spending much because the demand is enough to draw customers)? Or does this have something to do with a larger e-commerce mix? I\u2019d love to hear your feedback on this!",

Meaning he only gets paid for all his efforts if the stock does well. \u2022 A company going BK doesn\u2019t typically buy other companies. \u2022 TLSS has successfully dug themselves out of the financial hole they were in when John and Doug and all other new management took over. \u2022 Companies going BK don\u2019t typically have a positive EBITDA. \u2022 I just don\u2019t see a shipping logistics company going BK in the busiest shipping season the world has ever seen.\n\nNot to mention, they\u2019re working to up list to OTCQB and then before October 2021 up list to the NYSE.\n\nCougar Express is the first acquisition they\u2019ve announced... But it is not the only company they\u2019re currently working to acquire.\n\nThey are also in negotiations with a \u201chousehold name\u201d shipping company to add to their current contract with Amazon.\n\nAlso, in Amazon\u2019s most recent 8k they stated, \u201cAmazon plans to restart 3rd-party shipping services in 2021 after putting the program on hold earlier this year due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\u201d (Which doesn\u2019t specifically mean they\u2019re extending their contract with TLSS. But to me it sure does make sense that they would consider extending their contract with TLSS.)\n\nIf they get the contract with the \u201chousehold name\u201d company and they extend their contract for another few years with Amazon and they successfully up list to OTCQB, AND they successfully up list to NYSE...\n\nI can easily see this company going to a billion or multi-billion dollar company within the next 2 to 4 years. Just in the last month it\u2019s gone from a $20 million market cap to a $41.25 million market cap. Literally MORE than doubling in value... in a month...\n\nJust give it another 24 to 48 months...\n\nThis isn\u2019t a pump and dump because you can verifiably see the steps they have taken and are taking to make all that happen.\n\nI for one, believe they will do it too. Just look at what they\u2019ve accomplished in the past. These guys are brilliant businessmen and I have learned a TON just from watching them work over the last 8 months.\n\nI would absolutely love to have a meeting or lunch with this team and be able to pick their brains.\n\nWhat we are looking at right now, is a phenomenal opportunity.",

We could easily moon for a week or something, but a sentiment change would fuck us pretty hard right now. Not really useful to try to time it, because when in doubt, market goes up.

        "body": "At risk of pissing off the PSTH pumper fanboys: ***The \"tontine\" structure is a garbage fiction invented by Ackman to benefit himself.***\n\nIt has one purpose and one purpose only - to keep the price higher than the NAV (the $20/share cash money in escrow paid in by the spac IPO buyers) so that there are no redemptions that would mess up Ackman's deal.\n\nFor those unfamiliar with spacs - redemptions only happen when the price of the spac falls below the NAV price - then people will buy for the lower value and trade the shares in for the value of the money they represent in the trust.  So imagine you could buy PSTH for $19 because everyone hated it, and then trade it back to Ackman for $20 of the cash the early IPO investors put into his escrow account.  That's a redemption.\n\nIf the price stays significantly above $20 then no one redeems, they'd just sell the shares to some other trader for the market price, since that's more than they'd get by redeeming.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe tontine structure claims you'll get extra warrants if people redeem their shares, but that's a totally fictional concept because no one is going to redeem, because of the warrants attached to the stock until merger.  Here's where the Ackman magic comes in:  Normally spacs trade as \"Units\" and then they split into warrants and stock.\n\nIn a typical situation it would look something like this: 1 Unit gets split into 1 stock and 3/9 warrants - so for every 3 units you have you get 3 stock and 1 warrant - fractional warrants disappear.  Well what Ackman did is leave 1/9 warrants on the units and move 2/9 of the warrants to the stock.  So the first split only created 1/3 of the warrants that will be available.  The other 2/9 will detach from the stock during the merger with the target company.\n\nThe trick is that those 2/9 warrants now have a much higher value than they normally would because there's demand for warrants and not very many of them - supply and demand drives the warrant prices up.  So now you have $20 NAV in stock, plus $2 in fractional warrants attached to the stock.  ***There's basically no way the price can go below NAV to be redeemed, because the value of the stock with the fractional warrants attached will always be far above NAV.***\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSo what's the benefit to the investor?  There isn't one.  The only benefit to \"tontine\" structure was that if people redeemed their fractional warrants would be shared among the remaining investors. But since the price can't go below NAV, no one redeems, so it's a fictional proposition.\n\nThe downside is that it sucks for both serious investors and novice investors. It sucks for the novice investors because they're saddled with 2/9 warrants that they don't understand and probably won't handle in the most profitable way. These aren't free, the novice still has to pay the extra $2/share inflated price of the commons, and there's a risk that the warrants will be worth less when they get them because there will be 3x as many on the market suddenly.\n\nIt sucks for the serious investors because the warrants are overpriced which kills the leverage benefits, and the commons force you to buy warrants you may not want in your trading strategy.  The only people it doesn't suck for are people that want the exact ratio of 9 shares and 2 warrants.  That's a weird target ratio and I doubt anyone specifically desires that.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nTLDR: Ackman rigged the spac for his own benefit, and it's had the unintended consequence of skyrocketing the price because of a feedback loop between warrant demand and stock price.  The money value of a share is $20, and right now you're going to pay 38% more than that if you want one (28% if you can manage to sell the warrants for $9 later on when they split at merger).\n\nIf you think that premium is worth it then invest, but know that ***you're investing in a pile of cash on the hope that Ackman finds an exciting target and someone is willing to pay you an even higher premium for your shares - shares that Ackman himself has deemed are worth $20.*** (that's the value he will negotiate with the target company, not the current stock price)",

        "body": "tbf, they started working w/ ncmec since 2010 and signed a contract w/ ICE in 2014.  It wasn't until 2015 when they had a full implementation going.  I learned some of this stuff doing DD prior to the PLTR \\*DPO.\n\nICE actually has two completely separate divisions in what they do in terms of business function/responsibility/jackasses running it: \n\n* HSI, Homeland security investigations, they look for foreign criminals and criminal acts.\n* ERO, Enforcement and Removal Operations, they having nothing better to do than deport people who don't have citizenships.\n\nOriginally the contract was only to support HSI.  They were working on breaking up importation violations w/ CBP, Customs and Border Protection (under the DHS umbrella that ICE also exists under along w/ secret service, OIG, Coast Guard, TSA, FEMA, USCIS) and work w/ local LE to identify people in criminal rings in illegal importation of drugs, non-CARB legal Skyline GT-Rs, Silvias, AE86s, and other drift cars, gang/cartel activity including human trafficking.\n\nERO got a hard-on (erection/sexual arousal) when they found out about Palantir's capabilities and walked over to their HSI buddy cubicles and started shoulder surfing PLTR and eventually just taking over by using the platform for their own investigations.\n\nThis all began under the Obama administration.  So I mean, I get that the United States should be developing best in class stuff so we can keep up with foreign governments.  But it speaks volumes that our administration (bipartisan) would do this kind of BS.\n\nLike China has MiningLamp which is supposed to be a data analytics platform comparable to Palantir.  And now w/ the stolen F35 lightning plans, they have their own facsimile (look up the Shenyang J31).  So \"foreign adversaries\" aka \"foreign trade partners\" are on the same or similar level to us, blame foreign espionage, blame globalism, if humanity was equal in terms of tech and trade, there'd be no problem.\n\nIf we're really pissed off about the comings and goings of the United States' actions, we should dump the assholes in Congress, Senate, and Executive leadership to figure out a way that doesn't involve inciting revolution, installing shill gov'ts, and drone bombing people the opposition to keep a hold on oil.  \n\nData analysis platforms are just going to get more important as the years go by.  Data analysis has been the next gold rush for the past decade and a half with Facebook, Google, Amazon, Oracle, AdTech, Medical Research, and other companies using the data to streamline operations, manufacturing, production, research, and sales.  \n\n*Punishing Palantir for witchcraft is akin to fearing doctors because bloodletting used to be a thing.*\n\n**Palantir is going to the moon first** before everyone else cuz they were fucking *tits deep* in this stuff since 2004.  And they'll continue to be tits deep before anyone even gets balls deep.\n\nIt's like Tesla and electric vehicles.  \n\nOnly now is GM (Nikola lol), Ford (Rivian), and other manufacturers trying to get in.  But Tesla's bottom up approach, listening to consumers, is destroying all the other car manufacturers (because traditional big AF car companies do a top down approach by having marketing teams making assumptions of what consumers really care about).\n\nUltimately, we don't need to shill WSB to get people to invest, we're already doing that.  What is important is to help \"Main street\" understand the implications.  Palantir has a bipartisan pass.  AOC is raising concerns, but is doing it for clout.  If she was in a presidential position, she'd be riding the PLTR Train to the moon too.\n\nPLTR doesn't need rockets to get to the moon.  They built the fucking railroad to get there.\n\n\\--\n\n\\*because I keep calling it an IPO by accident when it was a direct listing",

You also conflate peoples living expenses and other types of lending.  \n\nFirst you should tell me how renting and mortgages are the same thing, then share the source you mentioned, then explain how other types of lending are 100% related to your original comment.\n\nExample: Someone who is renting can\u2019t be evicted.  They can chose to continue paying their rent so they don\u2019t have to pay it back later (whole separate problem on its own) that person may OR may not have an auto loan/credit card, whatever.  If they do.... they can still pay that back as normal (or not if the lender has a program in place) or in the event of not having any other loans.... just simply not paying rent until legally required to since evictions are not aloud right now.",

As people discover how insane these are, likely the stock will rise in value. A good example is a [Soar.com](https://Soar.com) app, which is going to use AI to generate transcripts and categorize conversations, making a company's Zoom meetings/training sessions searchable. This is a huge deal.\n\nThird, as others have said, it's about managing the relative size of the position in their funds.",

        "body": "Copy-paste of a comment I made somewhere else:\n\nWhat PLTR offers is a quick way to make a Knowledge Graph (KG), filled with data. Which you can then ask questions and interact with visually. Google Search, Wikipedia, Facebook, Uber: they all use a KG to some extent. The power of a KG over traditional tabular datasets (think rows and columns) is that a KG allows you to infer information from the data, which you have not made explicit for yourself. Governmental bodies have been using/developing KG's for a longer period of time, and you can see now that commercial companies see the value in it as well. Just go to Youtube and search for 'Uber Knowledge Graph'. It's relatively dry material, but the Uber vids are short and to the point.\n\nThe fact that it is dry material also explains part of the fact that fucknuggets like Jim Cramer don't understand what they do, and what the implied value is of their offering. It's like trying to explain to my parents what a webbrowser is. It's not their fault, they just don't understand.\n\nBut people don't need to truly understand. You don't know how a Ferrari is made, but you know it's a gorgeous, fast, Italian, expensive, and - above all - quality car. You don't truly understand, but the story around Ferrari explains it to you in a way. The same applies to Palantir. You see how they support in making sure the vaccination process is a success. You don't know exactly how, but you know they do. At the end of the day it's very simple: data is raw information, pieced together by context. PLTR offers the best way to distill information out of heaps of data.\n\n**TLDR**: look up 'uber knowledge graph' on Youtube to understand what a KG is. Then imagine PLTR lets you do what Uber does themselves, only in 3 weeks, with 10x the amount of data sources.",

By the fall, I was looking at huge capital gains and I decided to just hold out until the new year to sell that way I could delay paying the capital gains tax by another year.\n\nSo, I sold out of my position the first week of January.

In FY 2020, I made approximately $34,591.71 BY day and week trading \\*\\*(Please keep in mind that the trades I made were with excess cash on the sidelines and my \"core\" portfolio, was never touched so that appreciated substantially, just as I am sure everyone else's \"Long term hold portfolio also appreciated\" from March thru year end 2020). My day trading thesis was that if I could make $300 a day, when the charts of a particular stock or ETF were in support of my approach, then I would go for it. IF the market dipped OR if I felt that I was trading just to trade, then I would sit on the sidelines for that day and wait for a better support level on any given equity. So, out of a possible 253 trading days, I ended up day / week trading on 118 days and averaged a return of $293.15 per day that I actually traded. . So, as we rolled into 2021, where I do expect a substantive pull back, I have been playing with SPY puts (in anticipation of some pullback with a June expirations), and I rolled in and out of CVS, multiple times, to create about $1,400 of profit in 2 days. \n\nI can tell you first hand, if you have the cash on the sidelines to play with, that day trading is a viable revenue stream (especially if you're working from home), however, you have to have discipline AND, I would say, most importantly, that you have to play with quality day trading names. Most of my profit was made on the following day trade names: Amazon, Google, CVS, RVLV, DBX, QCOM, AMEX, LYB, FB, SWKS, GS, C, ADBE, etc...My thinking on these names was that if there was another massive drop, like we had in March / April, that I didn't mind holding these names for the long term BUT, at the same time, based on reading the charts, they had substantial \"support\" levels at particular prices, Amazon, specifically, would seemingly bounce off of $3,000 virtually everytime it hit that price. \n\nIn any event, I am really curious to see if I can hit the $100,000 mark in 2021, so far I am off to a good start, but if anyone is looking for additional tips OR for some guidance on my thought process and how I approach it, private message me and I'm happy to share additional details.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGood luck trading everyone and happy new year.",

Most people outside of finance had never heard about an \"ETF\". We were also seeing 6.5% CD rates in 2000. We didn't have iPhones back then, but my Lexus had a \"car phone\". Enjoyed the ride up in 1999, and saw much of that money erode come 2000. However, since I still had a job, I was able to continue to buy in 2000 when things were going down. Made my first $1M after 2 drawdown periods (1999 and 2008); $150k invested over 12 years (I'd try to put in $1k/month most months, and a bit extra when I could) turned into $1M.\n\nThere's just so much more information and knowledge available now, and the folks of today don't seem to have a problem with holding through drawdowns. I look at the \"new investments\" like Bitcoin in amazement, and not because of the parabolic moves, but because so many people have been holding on through 80% drawdowns. I've never seen such an iron conviction before. Folks of today are not afraid of drawdowns or volatility. Additionally, between all of our corporations, we're pumping in billions of new dollars every single week into the market now.\n\nTimes have changed, and you're kidding yourself if you haven't seen the change.",

This hasn\u2019t mooned yet and it\u2019s due for a run like BTBT. A lot of people don\u2019t know about EBON right now just like they didn\u2019t know about BTBT. It\u2019s going to be huge. A lot of people compare CAN to EBON but CAN has 150mil float (hard to move fast) and they don\u2019t have anything in the pipeline in terms of catalysts like EBON does for q1 2020. CEO is bullish and bitcoin at 28-29k is huge for them.\n\nBloomberg also released an article recently, calling them the next \u201cQualcomm of bitcoin mining hardware\u201d on December 26th. I made 4x my money on BTBT because I knew it was lagging behind mara/riot in terms of market cap to hash power.\n\nMy play now is EBON and I am extremely confident this unknown play is going to be the play for cryptocurrency. A bitcoin mining farm and crypto exchange in the pipeline is HUGE especially when they also are a market leader in terms of computing power for their bitcoin mining hardware (plus the patented exclusive rights to asicBOOST) \n\nBitmain planning to IPO at 50b and EBON has the chance to 4x or beyond just like BTBT. A lot of these plays are unknown and you just need to go in early. Don\u2019t go in the popular stocks that everyones talking about because most of the time, they just fail. We got a great stock here and we\u2019re early. Good luck to all. Bullish. BTC nearing 30k ATH hit 29600 and now around 29100-29200.",

        "body": "Ok, try my best:\n\nx86 and ARM are two different CPU architectures. AMD/Intel are based on x86 architecture.\n\nWithin the chips are CPU cores (hence u see 4-core/6-core/8-core CPUs etc). In (current) x86 architecture, all the cores are the same.\n\nIn ARM they are hybrid cores where some of these cores are power-hungry powerful cores for high-performance and some are lower power cores but more power-efficient. \n\nTraditionally more power = more performance (a simplified view) but there's a diminishing return and also in a battery-powered situation, this doesn't really scale.\n\nThe majority of pc/laptops/electronic devices don't always need to use powerful cores all the time. So when you have a hybrid architecture you can save power and only use the efficient cores when you are doing light tasks and then turn on the high-performance cores when you are doing demanding tasks.\n\nApple has been producing their own chips based on the ARM architecture and with the recent release of M1, they showed that CPUs can be both powerful and also energy-efficient in a mass-produced, everyday machine. This is especially true when you design the software (e.g. the OS) to distribute tasks accordingly to the right hybrid cores in order to improve performance per watt. i.e. optimising the software to take advantage of the chip design.\n\nTaking an assumption that AMD/Intel can not keep up with the pace of innovation that Apple is doing with producing their own chips, and that they will for the near-future stick with the x86 architecture, they will need to do something to mitigate this performance per watt difference between Apple and themselves. \n\nI'm thinking that AMD/Intel will also go down the route of Big.Little design employed by ARM while sticking with the x86 architecture. \n\nIntel I believe, is releasing a new CPU based on this architecture in the coming year. AMD I think is waiting on software to take advantage of this hence my comment on there is a dependant variable on Microsoft if they can optimise Windows for Big-Little Architecture and also ARM.\n\nIf MSFT spends more time on ARM optimisation you might see laptop manufacturers start using ARM chips from companies such as Qualcomm with their Snapdragon chips vs AMD/Intel chips (an example of this would be Microsoft Surface Pro X laptop).\n\nCircling it all back, this might have an effect on the future growth of AMD. How much, positive vs negative, that's for anyone to guess....\n\nHope that helps but also caveat disclaimer; there's a lot of \"if then therefore\" simplified logic in there.",

The new 480 chip might make samsung not even bother. Even apple's modems will likely be the otherside of snapdragon vs A13. Qualcomm will be reaping massive returns in automotive by the time apple has something that's not as shit as the Intel ones they had been using. Qualcomm will still earn $9-18 an iPhone even if Apple is using 100% their own parts. They settled the 4.5bn lawsuit because they didn't want to admit stealing source code from qualcomm and giving it to Intel (and still failed), pretty red flag that they have to resort to that. \n\nBroadcom is definitely worthy of owning for a broad 5G portfolio. QCOM has my heart and is just making so much money. QCOM sets the global standards, owns the relevant patents and is so incredibly positioned for 5G take off it's insane. Most people think of 5G as faster cell service for smartphones when it's not for that at all. Once retail investors understand this, they'll be hoping on qualcomm. \n\nI think we will see significant investment in 5G infrastructure in the coming US infrastructure bill, telcoms and companies like Ericsson rely on that.",
