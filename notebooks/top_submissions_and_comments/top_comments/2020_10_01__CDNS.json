However, it seems CDNS is falling off compared to SNPS in the last month, possibly due to these disparate earnings stories. CDNS got hit hard this year after a monster Q1, while SNPS has had a positive trend through volatility. That could signal an industry preference for one over the other. I can't figure out anything they're doing differently -- they both run FinFET, same full-suite offerings on the website. One is undervalued, the other slightly over.

At the very least Bezos will be starting with a huge disadvantage. \n  \n&gt; Blue Origin. \n   \nThat's exactly where the problem lies. Blue Origin is realistically the only launch provider that could deploy this system, and they're encountering significant delays. Blue Origin is pretty much synonymous with \"slow\" in the launch industry at this point. It's going to take a very long time before they reach the point where they can hit the launch cadence that SpaceX is currently reaching.  \n  \nI don't remember where I heard it, but IIRC there were rumors a while back that Amazon seriously considered just buying Starlink satellite buses from SpaceX and launching them on Falcon 9, in other words they'd just take Starlink sats and put the Amazon logo on them. If that was seriously considered, that looks really bad.    \n  \nThere is some circumstance where perhaps the Kuiper program gets way ahead of Blue Origin and they have satellites ready before rockets, in which case they theoretically could pay ULA or Arianespace for launches, but I somehow doubt that Bezos would let that happen.    \n  \nI think this is one of those circumstance where we'll just have to wait and see what happens. There is precious little information about project Kuiper. We can try and compare things to SpaceX, but they're notoriously fast and have a ton of experience in this field already.",

Founder, chairman, and co-CEO is Aart de Geus has been around since founding the company in 1986 and a leader in the tech industry. Love seeing a founder who has stuck with and successfully run the business he started. Other co-CEO Dr. Chi-Foon Chan has been with the company 30 years, was an engineering manager at Intel, and has a Masters and PhD in Computer Engineering. Again, a great sign at a tech company, love seeing tech-minded management instead of an MBA.\n\nI ran a DCF for them, and honestly the only major issue I'm seeing is their current price. Currently trading at 55x earnings and a bit overpriced by standard DCF metrics. They would require free cash flow growth of over 30% in order to get a 15% required rate of return on the stock price.\n\nThat being said, they were able to grow cash an insane 85% from 2018 to 2019, and their 2020 is looking great and looking to grow cash flows another 50% for 2020, which is phenomenal! \n\nI would love to dig into them more and learn more about the business model, customers, and their moat, but very interested for sure!

Currently they are serving customers launching nano or micro satellites. This is because Vigoride only has a payload capacity (right now) of up to 750kg. Ardoride which will commercially launch next year will significantly expand the potential payload capacity enabling them to serve larger satellites. The bull case would be that when Starship and New Glenn arrive, every flight will be a rideshare (as opposed to SpaceX's current cadence of 3-4 per year going forward).  Again because the payload capacity will be so massive that no one satellite provider will be able to fill it. Then almost every satellite on those ships could be a potential customer because again, these rockets can only drop off the payload in a specific orbit and there will be many customers on the rocket each with different needs. \n\nNumerically, there are a gigantic almost absurd amount of companies developing satellites right now, whether they be cube sats or larger ones. If you do some googling (or just look through the Momentus press releases on partners), I'm sure your head will get to spinning quickly. SpaceX enabled that through their dramatic lowering of launch costs. Many will fail, but the good thing about Momentus is they are agnostic as to who wins and who doesn't.",

        "body": "I think the important thing to realize is that Snowflake isn't just a general \"cloud\" service. Like you mentioned, they are a data warehousing service. They compete with a small section of AWS called Redshift. Other competitors in this field are IBM DB2 warehouse, Teradata, and MS Azure Synapse. \n\nAs far as competitive advantage over these services from what I know the big one is their ability to separate the scaling of storage vs computing and price those scaling options separately. With most data warehousing solutions when you pay to scale computing, you also have to pay for storage upgrades. This results in larger solutions looking toward snowflake depending on how much work they actually need to do with the data.\n\nSo to complete this point, out of the ones you mentioned. Google has BigQuery or whatever its called, AWS has Redshift, MS has synapse. Salesforce and Cloudflare don't offer the same solutions as they are CDNs and a security service respectively. The other competitors really are IBM and Teradata as mentioned above. I would look into these, read the 10k, see how much profit comes in from these companies and their warehousing solutions. \n\nAs a bonus anecdotal meme, I frequent data engineering and big data subs a bunch even though I'm a boring regular developer and Snowflake seems to be the hot wave that every dev wants to implement. Take that for what you will.",

Did you listen to the earnings call or read the [letter to shareholders](https://investors.fastly.com/files/doc_financials/2020/q3/updated/3Q20-Shareholder-Letter.pdf)? What did you make of the guidance?\n\nPersonally, I would hold the position. Though they just lost 10% of their revenue with TikTok, they've kept 90%. As a CDN, they're going to enjoy considerable network effects with regard to their financial position. They need to work on customer concentration, but as they continue to build out they'll have the ability to do just that.\n\nBeyond that, I think there are some pretty clever things Fastly will be able to do now that they own Signal Sciences regarding package deals to woo current Signal Sciences customers away from their existing CDNs.\n\nWhat's your time horizon?",

        "body": "I do this kind of thing for a living and it\u2019s not my first DDoS rodeo. I\u2019ve lived through several waves of these attacks and seen multiple generations of solutions.  At first we had to figure out how to do it ourselves with on-prem solutions like Radware and Arbor.  Next you had scrappy upstarts like Prolexic that used those techs to build scrubbing centers and offered services to those that couldn\u2019t protect themselves.  Then there was a wave of acquisitions and others trying scale the scrubbing center idea (e.g. Akamai buying Prolexic, carriers adding DDoS services). Now we have some entrenched players like Akamai, CloudFlare and some of the carriers, but I recently noticed that players like A-10, Radware and F5 are getting in the game with hybrid cloud/on-prem DDoS solutions.  From a technical perspective, these are an improvement over the 3 layers of defense I mentioned above because there is an on-perm component, but practically I think only a relatively small subset of customers will need this level of protection. \n\nGenerally some mix of A-10, Radware and Arbor will probably be the technologies the big players like Akamai, CloudFlare, Lumen and even Fastly use to deliver their services. So as these solutions providers build out there networks and scrubbing centers A-10 and the other hardware vendors could benefit in the same way a steel company will benefit when car sales trend up. \n\nThat said, A-10 is a pretty niche player. I run a team at a Fortune 50 multi-national and I\u2019ve only ever used a single pair of A-10 boxes on my network and those were eventually replaced by a feature on Palo Alto firewalls.  I suppose they could be an acquisition target if their tech is good, but I think they\u2019ll have a hard time competing against carriers and CDNs over time because the latter will have an easier time cross selling and up selling. I know I would rather expand services with a current vendor and push for volume discounts than go through the pain of cutting a contract with a new vendor for a niche tech.",

And CDNs don\u2019t really make a whole lot of sense if you need 6 of them in each cloud region to deliver your content based on which provider those workloads are residing with. The fact that Akamai, Fastly, etc. are all neutral in the cloud war is kinda the point. More companies will find themselves in hybrid multi cloud environments in the next 3-5 years, and there will need to be neutral parties to handle the relationships between the giants.",
