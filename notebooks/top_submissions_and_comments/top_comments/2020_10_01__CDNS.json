However, it seems CDNS is falling off compared to SNPS in the last month, possibly due to these disparate earnings stories. CDNS got hit hard this year after a monster Q1, while SNPS has had a positive trend through volatility. That could signal an industry preference for one over the other. I can't figure out anything they're doing differently -- they both run FinFET, same full-suite offerings on the website. One is undervalued, the other slightly over. I'm curious as to why, but the two are telling different stories on the charts.",

Currently they are serving customers launching nano or micro satellites. This is because Vigoride only has a payload capacity (right now) of up to 750kg. Ardoride which will commercially launch next year will significantly expand the potential payload capacity enabling them to serve larger satellites. The bull case would be that when Starship and New Glenn arrive, every flight will be a rideshare (as opposed to SpaceX's current cadence of 3-4 per year going forward).  Again because the payload capacity will be so massive that no one satellite provider will be able to fill it. Then almost every satellite on those ships could be a potential customer because again, these rockets can only drop off the payload in a specific orbit and there will be many customers on the rocket each with different needs. \n\nNumerically, there are a gigantic almost absurd amount of companies developing satellites right now, whether they be cube sats or larger ones. If you do some googling (or just look through the Momentus press releases on partners), I'm sure your head will get to spinning quickly. SpaceX enabled that through their dramatic lowering of launch costs. Many will fail, but the good thing about Momentus is they are agnostic as to who wins and who doesn't.",

        "body": "I think the important thing to realize is that Snowflake isn't just a general \"cloud\" service. Like you mentioned, they are a data warehousing service. They compete with a small section of AWS called Redshift. Other competitors in this field are IBM DB2 warehouse, Teradata, and MS Azure Synapse. \n\nAs far as competitive advantage over these services from what I know the big one is their ability to separate the scaling of storage vs computing and price those scaling options separately. With most data warehousing solutions when you pay to scale computing, you also have to pay for storage upgrades. This results in larger solutions looking toward snowflake depending on how much work they actually need to do with the data.\n\nSo to complete this point, out of the ones you mentioned. Google has BigQuery or whatever its called, AWS has Redshift, MS has synapse. Salesforce and Cloudflare don't offer the same solutions as they are CDNs and a security service respectively. The other competitors really are IBM and Teradata as mentioned above. I would look into these, read the 10k, see how much profit comes in from these companies and their warehousing solutions. \n\nAs a bonus anecdotal meme, I frequent data engineering and big data subs a bunch even though I'm a boring regular developer and Snowflake seems to be the hot wave that every dev wants to implement.

As a CDN, they're going to enjoy considerable network effects with regard to their financial position. They need to work on customer concentration, but as they continue to build out they'll have the ability to do just that.\n\nBeyond that, I think there are some pretty clever things Fastly will be able to do now that they own Signal Sciences regarding package deals to woo current Signal Sciences customers away from their existing CDNs.\n\nWhat's your time horizon?",

At first we had to figure out how to do it ourselves with on-prem solutions like Radware and Arbor.  Next you had scrappy upstarts like Prolexic that used those techs to build scrubbing centers and offered services to those that couldn\u2019t protect themselves.  Then there was a wave of acquisitions and others trying scale the scrubbing center idea (e.g. Akamai buying Prolexic, carriers adding DDoS services). Now we have some entrenched players like Akamai, CloudFlare and some of the carriers, but I recently noticed that players like A-10, Radware and F5 are getting in the game with hybrid cloud/on-prem DDoS solutions.  From a technical perspective, these are an improvement over the 3 layers of defense I mentioned above because there is an on-perm component, but practically I think only a relatively small subset of customers will need this level of protection. \n\nGenerally some mix of A-10, Radware and Arbor will probably be the technologies the big players like Akamai, CloudFlare, Lumen and even Fastly use to deliver their services. So as these solutions providers build out there networks and scrubbing centers A-10 and the other hardware vendors could benefit in the same way a steel company will benefit when car sales trend up. \n\nThat said, A-10 is a pretty niche player. I run a team at a Fortune 50 multi-national and I\u2019ve only ever used a single pair of A-10 boxes on my network and those were eventually replaced by a feature on Palo Alto firewalls.  I suppose they could be an acquisition target if their tech is good, but I think they\u2019ll have a hard time competing against carriers and CDNs over time because the latter will have an easier time cross selling and up selling. I know I would rather expand services with a current vendor and push for volume discounts than go through the pain of cutting a contract with a new vendor for a niche tech.",

The course I went through helped with that and may be most people don't necessarily have the issues that I ran into using these courses. But, in hindsight, I wasted way too much time just going through these free videos without really understanding how they work in the real world.     \n    \nEdit: I didn't want to appear as if I'm spamming but I got a couple of DMs asking about the course I took. It's from ZipTrader. You can get 70% of the information from his youtube channel. But, I wanted something more structured and he really goes in a lot more detail in the course. I highly recommend it. Check out his free videos on YouTube particularly the one on why he is a trader and if it resonates with you (like it did for me), and you want to go ahead and check out the course, DM me for a discount coupon.",

I trade Roth accounts and cash accounts. \n\nThe Roth and IRA accounts have limited trading permissions but I\u2019m ok with that.

It\u2019s free. Practice trading options for months. For free. No risk. You can practice all the strategies and most importantly learn to manage a trade. \n\nYou will need to roll a trade out in time to give yourself more time to be right.

It is as important to manage winners as well as losers. \n\nMonths ago I bought SNAP at $19.8x and sold a $20 covered call for $1. That is 5%. Not bad for a month. \n\nI\u2019ve rolled it out and up so I now have a $25 covered call. I\u2019m still ITM but the point is that it\u2019s never only one trade. And the trade isn\u2019t over. \n\nAm I an expert - no. But just realize that options trading is not one and done. It\u2019s not. \n\nAnd it is a sum zero game. Your lose is my gain.

(I've only ever used Schwab, which is fantastic, but the others are known for great support.)\n* Financial advice and free workshops\n* As far as I can tell, better order flow. Schwab abides by NBBO and provides price improvement on approximately\n90% of orders. (Unlike RH, other brokerages apparently don't make a lot of money on order flow.)\n* Native real-time trading apps (Schwab has StreetSmart, Fidelity has Active Trader Pro)\n* Roboadvisors\n\nNone of this costs anything extra, though tailored financial advisor services do come extra.\n\nI think one of the big draws of a brokerage like Schwab, Fidelity, and Vanguard is access to mutual funds. At Robinhood you're limited to stocks, which includes ETFs. Mutual funds offer a wider range of funds, including target date funds and tax management funds. (Contrary to what many people on Reddit seem to believe, mutual funds don't just mean expensive actively managed funds! There are tons of cheap funds, and some that are even cheaper than ETFs.) For example, my IRAs are all in target date funds that have a fee of just 0.08%.\n\nIf I were starting out today, I'd pick Vanguard. Fantastic company with a uniquely altruistic vision.",

I'm interested in companies that are doing well, where the earnings outlook is positive, where earnings per share is growing. Maybe it's growing faster than people think. What do you have on your list that would fit that bill even if it's more expensive than the average company in your group?\u201d** So, it's that's sort of give-and-take. And I might encourage an analyst to reorient their priority list to help me look for stocks that fit my ideal pattern.\" (https://www.morningstar.com/podcasts/the-long-view/40)\n\nToo many people I think jump to an Intel because \"LOOKS CHEAP!\" when they'd have been better off with the things that appear more expensive where the company is doing well and the outlook is positive.\n\nIntel spent $15B on Mobileye, and for all the discussion of self driving, I don't know that I've heard anything much regarding Mobileye probably since they bought it.\n\nLastly,\n\n\"Intel completely missed out on the smartphone revolution, too, having been unable to come up with an answer for the rise of the ultra-low-power ARM SoC. After its smartphone insurgency, ARM chips quickly moved on Intel's territory by spreading to tablets and laptops. Intel's latest black eye is being completely dumped by Apple, which, after building its own ARM design house for the iPhone and iPad, has announced plans to upscale its ARM chips to Mac laptops and desktops.\"\n\nhttps://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/07/heads-roll-at-intel-after-7nm-delay/\n\n\"Laptops and desktops are the next great frontier for Apple's chip division. That division will help the company avoid the same fate that has befallen Android smartwatch manufacturers: letting some other company dictate your product lineup. Apple's plans to update the Mac have often been stymied by Intel's product roadmap, and Intel does not make chips that serve all of Apple's design priorities. The new CPU will be just one part of an Apple-designed system-on-a-chip that would also include (among other things) an Apple GPU and a desktop version of Apple's Neural Engine machine learning and AI processor found in the iPhone and iPad.\"\n\nhttps://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/06/this-is-apples-roadmap-for-moving-the-first-macs-away-from-intel/\n\n\"Intel actually says that the issues with its current 7nm production means that production is trending a year behind its internal roadmap. For some reason, though, the company says that being a year behind schedule will still only result in that aforementioned six-month delay to market. For comparison, AMD has already been outputting its own Ryzen 4000 chips based on its 7nm architecture for months, which have been handily outperforming Intel\u2019s offerings.\"\n\nhttps://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/7/23/21336356/intel-7nm-chips-next-gen-delay-q2-2020-earnings-amd-10nm-tiger-lake-desktop-laptop-cpu",

I recently opened a Roth IRA with fidelity and I\u2019m loving that tho as well. If you haven\u2019t, I absolutely recommend it. You can put money in there and buy stocks just like robinhood, plus you have access to international stocks if that matters to you, and it will be tax free when you turn 59.5. Plus, you get free withdrawals of your contribution amount anytime (you\u2019re only taxed on your gains for early withdrawals I believe). So there\u2019s not much of a downside.

I had major paper hands, and just couldn't resist checking the prices to see if I had lost a few dollars. \n\nI would say that most people would and should be investing as early as possible, reason being that you can put money in index funds and hold for the long term. Trading is a different matter, I would say that around the age of 15-16 is probably a good time to start. Start with a little bit, and play around with it. The reason being is that you're able to experiment and learn things about the market before actually committing larger amounts of money. \n\nAs for starting off, I would highly recommend watching youtube videos or a udemy course on investing basics, as well as looking at Investopedia. Those in combination with reading posts on specific reddit subs (r/stocks, r/finance, r/stockmarket, r/options) helped me get started. Reading reddit posts gets me more interested into trading. Stay away from WSB though, there's a lot more meme material there.\n\nIf you want to invest and not trade, then research basic market principles, how index funds/ETFs work, and research various ETFs. Generally I like to look at total market index funds, mid-large cap company funds, and emerging markets/fast growing markets such as Tech, EV, and Cannabis.\n\nIf you want to minimize risk, hold ETFs for the long term. Open a brokerage account through Fidelity, TD Ameritrade, Schwab, etc and put a portion of your paycheck into it. I actually really like this short document that has an ETF trading strategy: [https://www.etf.com/docs/IfYouCan.pdf](https://www.etf.com/docs/IfYouCan.pdf)\n\nTL;DR: Look at a basic investing course on Udemy or YouTube to learn basics of the market, and read about things on specific reddit subs. Invest and don't trade (investing tends to be holding for the long term while trading tends to be more short term). Invest in ETFs, and there are many different resources for finding which ones to invest in.",
