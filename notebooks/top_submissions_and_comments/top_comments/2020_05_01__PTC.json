They are leading the way with digitizing the Construction industry...which has been very slow to adopt technology in the office, trailer and job site.  Tons of opportunity there and Autodesk has the best end-to-end solutions. \n\nThey also have a huge opportunity with converting non-paying users.  Only about 4M out of 18M are paying subscription right now.   Lots of 'pirates' who can be turned into paying users and drive growth. \n\nLastly, the manufacturing industry is changing...becoming more digitized and reliant on the cloud which is perfect for Autodesk.  Their Fusion360 solution is way ahead of OnShape (PTC).  \n\nDespite a cut in their numbers this year due to COVID they re-affirmed their targets for 2022 as well.   Lots to like.",

        "body": "The news catalyst wasn't game breaking. It was a mere splash in the water. ZOM has been working with QRVO for years. The technology and platform they're using has been in the pipeline since 2018.\n\n&gt;ANN ARBOR, Mich., Nov. 27, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --\u00a0[Zomedica Pharmaceuticals Corp.](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=BNoKmDqBUI458HpCUH4bxzhaWhwbD7MXispL1rbkS724nmPs8ySLIVPxicMmv7sDwJhvfIvFza6OcvxJmZH3vxG9dH9p4GTBHw9PQYhUHdw=)\u00a0(NYSE  American: ZOM) (TSX-V: ZOM), a veterinary diagnostic and pharmaceutical  company,\u00a0today announced it has entered into a development and supply  agreement with Qorvo Biotechnologies, LLC (Qorvo), a wholly-owned  subsidiary of Qorvo, Inc. (Nasdaq: QRVO) focused on bringing its  piezo-electric Bulk Acoustic Wave (BAW) sensor to the veterinary health  sector. Under the terms of this agreement, Zomedica has exclusive,  global rights to develop and market Qorvo's investigational  point-of-care diagnostic platform for veterinary use.\n\nReading their current press release didn't offer much. It sounds like they completed and verified their first assay of 5 which they intended to conduct. I'm not sure what they need to do to have the assay validated or approved (FDA?) but that's still in the works. They note those works are HINDERED due to the current environment.\n\n&gt;Upon completion of verification testing, the Company expects to  commence the validation of each assay and to initiate a parallel pilot  program focused on optimizing the customer experience. Assuming  successful completion of this verification and development work,  Zomedica intends to commence commercialization of all five initial  assays in select strategic markets.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;As previously reported by the Company, the novel coronavirus, or  COVID-19, pandemic has impacted the Company\u2019s expected timing for the  completion of the development and the initiation of the  commercialization of the TRUFORMA\u2122 platform and the five initial assays.  Once our development partner, validation participants and potential  customers are able to return to normal operating procedures, we will  assess the impact of the pandemic and update our expected timing  accordingly.\n\nI dont remember what the financials showed and the news catalyst leading to an increase was reasonable, but pretending it should have pushed any farther had people not been traumatized is hilarious. The stock was overvalued all things considered, hence the correction. I liked ZOM but my own DD turned me away which sucks, looks like it could have been good for 30-40% conservatively. Hopefully everyone made some money and learned their lesson ;) Which now extends to UAVS/MVIS/ZOM. Ha\n\n&gt;**The Covid 19 Form 8-K provides disclosure of the impact of  the pandemic on the expected timing, and indicates that we will not be  able to achieve the timeframes we had previously anticipated. The Covid  19 Form 8-K also supplements the risk factors disclosed in the Annual  Report, to add three new risk factors related to the pandemic.** Reference is made to the Covid 19 Form 8-K for additional information.The Company also today announce that, as disclosed in its Current  Report on Form 8-K filed with the\u00a0SECon\u00a0April 13, 2020\u00a0(the \u201cNYSEA Form  8-K\u201d), it has received formal notice from the NYSE American it is not in  compliance with the NYSE American continued listing standard set forth  in section 1003(f)(v) of the NYSE American Company Guide because its  common shares have been selling for a substantial period of time at a  low price per share. As disclosed in the NYSEA Form 8-K, the Company  intends to regain compliance with the NYSE American\u2019s continued listing  standards by undertaking a measure or measures that are for the best  interests of the Company and its shareholders.",

I'd like to invest in the Irish domiciled XLK ETF but there are two, one by iShares, the other by SPDR. \n\nBoth QDVE (iShares) and ZPDT (SPDR) have TER 0.15% and they track the same stocks. For 1 year return, one is better than the other. For 3 years return, it's the other way round. \n\nSo, how do I choose between these two ETFs other than TER? Does AUM or trading volume matter?",

        "body": "So here's the crazy part. STZ paid $4B USD + the warrants and the initial November 2017 investment for a combined, let's say, $4.4B USD...for 38%. STZ will *only* have 56% *after* they've executed the remaining three tranches: ~ at the 48CAD, 76CAD, and VWAP pricing.\n\nThat said, I still think CGC is going to be a monster in a decade. The number of paths of revenue they will have - no other cannabis company compares to: Canadian ops, ACRG + TER, This Works, BioSteel, Storz &amp; Bickel, clinical trials, all their partial investments in other companies...\n\nSTZ sure may regret their purchase price, but they don't regret being in this space - they know how massive it's going to be. Like Klein said last fall: \"[STZ] might've been early, but we weren't wrong\" for what the cannabis industry is going to be globally. STZ is fine apparently spending lots of money now to explore different cannabis revenue streams and get each product just right to ensure they're the dominant player in town a decade from now.",

        "body": "I like TER and think they are a much better option than ACRG if you are looking for CGC access through an MSO, but it's definitely a bit of mixed bag in terms of their operational results right now as seen in the Q4 2019 financials:\n\nTHE GOOD- Pennsylvania and NJ. Two limited-license markets with huge current upside on medical growth, as well as long-term upside upon adult-use legalization. Will be great markets in 2020 and beyond, and will drive most of their revenue growth for the foreseeable future.\n\nTHE MEDIOCRE- California. This is more a challenge of the high taxes/black market competition in the state, but i would struggle to call TER a leader in Cali. Revenues are stagnating/declining showing a lack of both retail and wholesale growth, with their long-established Apothecarium stores still unprofitable and dragging on cash flow. There is still potential in this market, but operational results have not been great in the state since TER took over.\n\nTHE BAD- CBD Business and Canada. Q4 showed declining revenues and growing EBDITA losses for both these segments. Saying TER is the only company with US and international exposure is a nice talking point, but in reality, their financials are struggling as a direct result of these non-US THC operations.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLooking at Q4 2019 which included a full quarter of Illera (PA acquisition), TER had some negative impairments that somewhat skewed the actual result, but gross margins were negative on the quarter at -16% (and still quite poor compared to peers with those impairments removed), they had an ajt EBDITA loss of almost $6M, and a much larger OCF and FCF loss. Cash position is solid with recent raises and i think 2020 should be a better year, but TER definitely needs to show improved profitability metrics over the coming year and focus on key limited-license US markets.",
