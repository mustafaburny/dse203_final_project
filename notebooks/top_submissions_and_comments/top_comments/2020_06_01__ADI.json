Usually  the profit ranges from 12-17% per call option sold, depending upon  various factors of course. Have also held ADI, MO, GS and sold calls against them, collecting the dividend and the premium. 90% of the time the calls that I've sold expire worthless - so I keep the premium and the stock.",
