Most automakers are probably using TI, Infineon, NXP or Renesas for processors and Nvidia for AI. Tesla I believe made their own silicon since what is available now wasn't powerful enough. Also at this point ML/AI (used for things like object detection) is primarily based on having a bunch of data collected, which every Tesla car has been providing so they will have years of data over its competition. There was a cool video I watched where his SW/HW engineer were explaining what they were doing to be different.   \n\n\n100% there will be EV competitors that take away Tesla's marketshare, but we are quickly shifting towards autonomous features and I think Tesla will be untouchable there, especially since a lot of the Auto OEM's we're thinking of use other companies for some of their designs like Delphi, Bosch or Continental who don't have the capacity to make their own silicon.  (I still think Tesla is overvalued though)",

IOT is an absurdly cost sensitive area, something Intel is very not experienced and seemingly comfortable with.\n\nI have not seen a single Intel based device in IOT over the past few years. As very beefy gateways then maybe a handful at most. All smart plugs, sensors, etc, have been MCU's, something for which Intel has no reach and products worth a damn (as far as I know).",

If it doesn't have a decent amount of free money, everything will tank because everyone hates not getting free money. And, if it's restricted to SkyWorks and other DARPA dong suckers, everything will tank.     \n       \nAlso, why are you dipshits still fucking with MU? It has been complete shit for ages.
