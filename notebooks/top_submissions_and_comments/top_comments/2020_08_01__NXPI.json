        "body": "Even with a roadmap of what an EV should be, it'll be hard to copy what Tesla is capable of though unless Elon goes through with licensing his tech. Most automakers are probably using TI, Infineon, NXP or Renesas for processors and Nvidia for AI. Tesla I believe made their own silicon since what is available now wasn't powerful enough. Also at this point ML/AI (used for things like object detection) is primarily based on having a bunch of data collected, which every Tesla car has been providing so they will have years of data over its competition. There was a cool video I watched where his SW/HW engineer were explaining what they were doing to be different.   \n\n\n100% there will be EV competitors that take away Tesla's marketshare, but we are quickly shifting towards autonomous features and I think Tesla will be untouchable there, especially since a lot of the Auto OEM's we're thinking of use other companies for some of their designs like Delphi, Bosch or Continental who don't have the capacity to make their own silicon.  (I still think Tesla is overvalued though)",

This field will have more than one winner, and both will coexist well. They also largely move in lockstep with each other, but by diversifying between the two, you do decrease the risk/volatility that each inherently hold (idk like a scandal with one of them, etc.) and its more a bet on the sector/trend sticking with strong companies that will benefit.\n\nFor SQ v PYPL, I actually think they are different enough it warrants investing in one or both depending on your view of their individual futures. PYPL is more of a cashless play whereas SQ has both the Seller ecosystem, cashless (cashapp) and Square Store ecosystems.",

Learned the difference between a hyped up pump-and-dump and a legitimate company, and shifted my focus to more established companies, mainly in tech.\n\nSince then I've followed a strategy similar to what the OP has done, buying stocks whose success is evident in my daily life and companies that demonstrate obvious value to their clients: I work as an IT consultant, so when I see that all my clients are using Paypal, building ecommerce sites with Shopify, and hooking up the CRMs with Salesforce, I research these companies and look for investment opportunities.\n\n1.

If Elon wanted to start having Tesla make commerical aircrafts, he'd probably but Boeing and Airbus out of business in 10yrs. This one guy has been a major face of Paypal, Tesla, and now SpaceX. That doesn't even include his other companies such as The Boring Company or Neuralink. Musk is the Edison of our time and frankly, anyone who doubts him is just doing so out of ignorance and stupidity. All abord the Musk train man.",
