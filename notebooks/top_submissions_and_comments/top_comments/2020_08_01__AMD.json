They simply have nothing that will increase revenue growth while AMD is proceeding to take market share. True that Intel does a lot more than CPUs and  While everything op says is true you can wait for it to go down more before going long on it.",

Total from this trade is around 100K so far, we\u2019ll see when I close out the LEAPS\n\n\nAdvice to you retards is this sub is generally wrong when it agrees on something. Months of listening to morons tell me about how fake China was and how dumb the Alibaba founder is. Yawn. Yeah cus imma buy some shitty mattress penny stock off the pump and dump fucktard trying to dump it. \n\n\nDo your own research. It\u2019s obvious that everyone in China is moving to e-commerce much faster just like in the US and BABA is AMZN except with 3x more customers. Share price was depressed the last few months because of retards scared from watching orange man propaganda. Ant financial is going to break the global IPO record. Not to mention their investments in EV and dominance over food delivery. Just because some shitty coffee chain was a fraud doesn\u2019t mean everything else is. \n\nIs amazon a fraud because Enron exists?  Don\u2019t let yourself fall into the retardation that this sub tries to force on you\n \nCouple of my other positions: FB NVDA AMD LMND NIO FSLY TWTR",

        "body": "Yeah I disagree.\n\nThat\u2019s exactly what I thought when I bought a few shares as a part of my small portfolio. I sold a couple days ago, dumped for more AMD, and that\u2019s worked out really well. \n\nThere\u2019s a few things that caused me to do this.\n\n1. AMD still hasn\u2019t announced their new CPU or even GPU lineup this fall. They\u2019ve said \u201cZen 3 is coming\u201d etc, but they really haven\u2019t said much else. Just look what happened when they announced their latest chips, that\u2019s what like 5% of their overall sales potential? If that???\n\n2. Intel just released a new line of processors. They are fresh and are barely competing with AMD\u2019s latest line, Zen 2. Fact of the matter, intel is holding on to their fan base for the time being, but soon, AMD is going to take that over. Intel will have NO option but to lower their price, which will lower their value even more.\n\n3. AMD is projected to receive between 30% and 50% of market share in certain fields within the next 2-3 years. They\u2019re currently at 5%. To put that in perspective, Intel will just be spitting out 7nm processors when AMD is on Zen5. \n\n4. AMD is supplying XBOX and PS5 with their two most expensive components; even at a measly $300 for those combos, which could be undervalued, and estimated 100 million consoles sold over the next 3 years on the light side, is 30 billion dollars. Almost a third of their total value right now. There\u2019s no way this is priced in yet.\n\nJust by using some basic math, one could tell that AMD has so much further to go and Intel isn\u2019t looking bright for the next couple of years. AMD hands down is the better purchase. Buy Intel after AMD has the dominant market and they\u2019ll come storming back",

I started with 240k in various accounts the beginning of the year. When March hit, I took a beating and dropped to 120k.  I remembered the last big crash a decade ago and couldn't sit on the sidelines and knew I needed to liquidate all my shit stocks which is what I did.  I had to plan for a covid world; teleworking, home offices, vaccines.  I bought a lot of things and sold a lot the past 4 months.  I didn't try to be too greedy with certain stocks. They constantly go up and down.  Even Tesla. It went to 1800. I sold.  I got back in 1400. I go back in and out.  You can't get too emotional. If something is crap, sell.\n\nI've wasted a decade holding onto crappy stocks hoping one day they'll go back.  They usually don't. \n\nThere's money to be made everywhere. And don't fall for hype.  Don't buy shares of Amazon when you only got 10k to invest.  There's new industries everywhere.  \n\nFor long term holds I think NIO, MSFT, AMD, PLUG are the way to go. Hydrogen industry in general is just starting to take off. But I'd stay away from trendy companies like Nikola that haven't really produced anything.\n\ngood luck!!!",

Some are floundering but I have a lot that are doing great. Im so glad I diversified enough to overcome some deficits.\n\nWhy did I invest in these? I watched the news and listened to a lot of commentators and did extremely simple research on industries my gut told me had high growth potential. Am I a savvy investor? **Heck no**. I'm almost 70 years and a grandma who is painfully incompetent on the computer. My advice - pay attention of the trends around you.",

        "body": "I'll keep posting this until people understand that AMD's rise is deserved. \n\nThis is a post from u/Mintykanesh a couple days ago about AMD. \n\n&gt;TL;DR AMD is currently the smaller competitor in CPUs vs Intel and GPUs vs Nvidia. But for various reasons AMD is set to dominate Intel and be much more competitive vs Nvidia in the next few years. That and AMD is just becoming profitable and has nearly paid off its debt, so P/E should improve a lot pretty fast.\n\n**CPU Context**\n\nTheir main competitor is Intel who for a long time have been the dominant force in CPU design and manufacture - at least for laptops, desktops and servers anyway. They had most of the market share (think 90% +) earning most of the revenue and most of the profit.\n\nIntel managed this because both their CPU architecture was superior to their competitors and their manufacturing capability was also significantly more advanced. Intel simply made a better product for a long time. In contrast in the mid 2010s AMD released a new CPU architecture called Bulldozer which was *terrible*. It was so bad it almost killed the company.\n\nBut Intel was badly mismanaged in recent years. Instead of continuing to invest heavily in R&amp;D to maintain their dominant position, they milked their customers by selling virtually the same products every year at high markup. They managed to get away with it because their manufacturing technology continued improving with node shrinks roughly every 2 years which translated to better performance, energy efficiency etc.\n\nBut then everything went wrong for Intel and right for AMD at roughly the same time.\n\n**CPU Manufacturing**\n\nIntel got stuck on their 14nm process. They were supposed to begin mass producing products on their next 10nm node way back in 2016 but they still haven't really managed it. There are some 10nm products on the market now but performance is really poor and yields are terrible i.e. a lot of Intel's 10nm CPUs are broken and can't be used.\n\nDuring this time their manufacturing competitors like TSMC simply caught up and have now overtaken them. I think TSMC 5nm is entering mass production later this year. AMD CPUs are manufactured by TSMC so AMD have been benefiting from this significantly and all signs are pointing to this advantage increasing.\n\n**CPU Architecture - Zen**\n\nAMD's bulldozer sucked, but they followed it up with a new architecture called Zen in 2017 which was much more competitive. Their current Zen 2 architecture is pretty much equal to Intel's current offerings in terms of IPC and Zen 3 is rumoured to be a pretty big jump which may give them the architecture lead as well.\n\n**CPU Architecture - Chiplets**\n\nOne of the ways Intel screwed customers was not increasing core counts for years - they just didn't innovate in this area. AMD however did.\n\nThey came up with a chiplet design where rather than having the whole CPU on one die like Intel (a monolithic design) they consist of multiple smaller chiplets which are connected together. It's much easier to manufacture large core count CPUs this way as if a single large die has a defect on it it can kill the whole thing, so it's less risky to make smaller dies and hook them up.\n\n**CPU Summary**\n\nThe combination of the improved Zen architecture, the chiplet design and the TSMC manufacturing lead means AMD can produce higher core count CPUs than Intel can at lower cost. They also use less energy. They also tend to offer more features. They also run faster when core counts are high.\n\nSo now their products in the consumer space are very competitive VS Intel. Intel has a marginal gaming lead due to higher clocks at lower core counts still but AMD looks like a no-brainer in a lot of cases.\n\n* If you need lots of cores - go AMD\n* If you want a laptop with long battery life - go AMD (at least when their new Zen 2 based models are out - mobile chips come last for AMD)\n* If you need features like ECC - go AMD\n* If you need lots of PCI-E lanes - go AMD\n* If you run a datacenter - go AMD for the greatly reduced cost per core and better power efficiency. There is a **LOT** of money here.\n\nAll signs are pointing to these advantages only getting larger as AMD releases Zen 3 and TSMC extend their manufacturing lead over Intel.\n\n**GPUs**\n\nNvidia has been dominating AMD in the GPU space for a long time. AMD has some products competitive in the low-mid range but they just haven't been able to match Nvidia's best performance. The 2080ti came out in Sep 2018 but AMD still haven't released anything as fast.\n\nBut it's rumoured AMD may make a bit of a comeback when their new architecture RDNA 2 hits later this year. It's supposedly significantly faster than their current offerings and it looks like they may have manufacturing leadership as well. Again TSMC produce AMDs GPUs but normally they also produce them for Nvidia as well. But supposedly Nvidia tried pitting Samsung vs TSMC to reduce their prices and TSMC just gave them the boot, meaning Nvidia now has to produce their next gen cards on Samsung who offer an inferior process.\n\nA lot of this is based on rumour though. It's looking fairly certain AMD will be making serious headway on the CPU front, the GPU front is more of an unknown at this point.\n\n**Consoles**\n\nNot much to say here - AMD is producing the CPUs and GPUs for both the next Xbox and Playstation. This will bring a nice revenue boost in Q4 this year and in to next year, but this should be priced in.\n\n**Coronavirus**\n\nAMD is set to benefit greatly from coronavirus. There has been increased demand for their products as adoption of cloud services increases and consumers need their own devices to WFH. Intel may gain significantly as well as they are still the dominant player, and the server markets move slowly and consumers can take a while to change their opinion of brands. But it should still be a positive.\n\n**Risks**\n\nOn the negative side AMD is really vulnerable to political issues with China. They are reliant on TSMC to manufacture their products and TSMC are based in Taiwan.\n\n**AMD's Finances**\n\nAMD is coming from a situation to where they were nearly bankrupt to one where they are rapidly gaining market share. They are set to capture market share in CPUs, a market which is also growing significantly at the moment and may well do so in the GPU space as well.\n\nThey have also been paying off their debt and have nearly got rid of all of it. Together that means they are set for a rather big jump in earnings which could quickly lower their P/E ratio. Or they could increase R&amp;D investment which helps them build on their success on the longer term / a bit of both.",
