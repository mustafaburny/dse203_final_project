        "body": "This is something you should decide on your own by doing a decent amount of research, rather than investing based on someone else\u2019s words without any rationale. It\u2019ll be a good learning process. Figure out what you goals and risk tolerance are.\n\nIf you are feeling a bit reckless (don\u2019t want to do in-depth research) and looking for stocks/index funds to throw money at, then check out the following:\n\nMA (MasterCard) and/or V(Visa). Both are here to stay and grow for a while. They are currently down significantly from their all time high because of DoJ investigation into anticompetitive practices, but the fears are likely overblown.\n\nVUG. Vanguard growth ETF that gives exposure to US large-cap growth firms. For someone who is young and looking to stay invested for a long time, this is a relatively safe investment.\n\nTGT (Target). Currently trading at almost 10% below its all time high at half the P/E as WMT (Walmart) and COST (Costco), which are similar.\n\nMSFT (Microsoft). The general consensus on this one is that it will continue to grow and perform well.\n\nThese are just some to get started on. There are many others. Be aware that current evaluations for stocks are out of wack because of the Federal Reserve\u2019s monetary policy as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Also, September is generally one of the worst months historically for stocks, so have patience if you decide to invest your money in the next week or two.\n\nThis is not financial advice and I have positions in some of the stocks listed above.\n\nWish you all the best on your investing journey!",

        "body": "Here is the funny thing. Alipay/Ant Group grew up within Alibaba and became China\u2019s largest payments processing company (think Mastercard, Visa, Paypal, and Stripe all in one). It was for many years one of the most valuable parts of Alibaba. Then, in 2011, **Alipay was stolen** from the US and European investors in Alibaba\u2019s VIE structure when the founder and CEO Jack Ma unilaterally transferred 100% ownership of Alipay into a different company controlled solely by himself.\n\nOne of the shareholders hurt was Yahoo who were a big early investor in the Alibaba VIE, amassing a 43% stake. Yet, despite that very substantial ownership, Yahoo did not even find out about the transaction until months later. When they discovered what had happened, they were of course outraged and launched into legal proceedings.\n\nHowever due to the VIE structure, Yahoo (and other shareholders alongside them) were powerless to do anything. They had no legal recourse. Yahoo owned 43% of the Alibaba VIE (BABA stock), so it did not technically own any portion of Alipay at all. What Yahoo legally owned was 43% of a shell corporation listed in the Cayman Islands that had some (unfortunately illegal) contracts with Alibaba. And when it came time to enforce those contracts. they were unsurprisingly unenforceable. Let us be very clear about exactly what happened: Jack Ma took a company worth billions of dollars directly from under the nose of thousands of US and European investors in the VIE, and there was nothing anyone could do about it.\n\nYet, despite this recent, brazen, and high-profile theft, along with many others like it, investors continue to invest in the Alibaba and other VIE stocks to this day. This is even though there is absolutely nothing preventing the same happening again. Western investors continue to eagerly invest billions in the very structure that has been proved to offer them no protection in the past. Do people never learn?!\n\nFrom: https://gci-investors.com/chinese-vie-structure-wall-street-continues-to-ignore-the-risks/",

        "body": "Yes great long term hold. \n\nSome people don\u2019t realize companies like PYPL/SQ still utilize V/MA as their payment networks partner. I look at FinTechs more so as partners with V/MA and not competitors. Unless one of these companies wanted to start their own payment network directly. \n\nBNPL (like Affirm) could take some of the credit card business but I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if some companies could start letting you even make installment payments via CC instead of direct ACH. I\u2019m sure people even use their debit cards, which are V/MA branded\n\nMy biggest concern is more regulation around payment networks and potential allowance of smaller networks to gain a piece of the pie. I read an article the other day how Australia may mandate low-cost debit card system for payments, which would allow banks to potentially utilize cheaper payment networks as opposed to V/MA (which are more expensive). I\u2019m still not overly concerned with this yet to make me back off my stance that both V/MA are great long term holds, but something to watch. \n\nOnce international travel comes back some post COVID, V/MA will shoot up as this is their bread and butter. That segment has still not really recovered yet from COVID and will be one of the last things that does.",

Box office sales improved 3% globally to a record total of almost $40 billion\".\n\nhttps://www.marketwatch.com/story/this-violent-videogame-has-made-more-money-than-any-movie-ever-2018-04-06\n\nGTA V is also heavily quoted as the most profitable and also one of the most expensive entertainment products ever made. It's a narratively driven game although now the online sandbox is a major money maker for them.\n\nIn general multiplayer games do tend to make more than single player, but not because of story - unlike movies you can actively socialize and participate in a joint activity with friends, family, or even just strangers.\n\nPlus with mobile gaming and the lockdowns people have been playing games more than ever. Obviously Netflix has been trying to get in with their interactive shows / movies but not sure how well that's been for them. With more and more services that offer online game streams (MS and Sony both have theirs now and there's also Stadia that's kind of dead) it's possible Netflix may want to head in that direction but who knows...",

This will enhance transaction security and expand acceptance for PayPal\u2019s digital wallet to all physical retail locations where Visa contactless transactions are enabled.

The only one that is really different is Solana just because of the TPS numbers it can reach is seriously incredible for the price to run the software/node. It is only practical for enterprise customers though. Settlement finality could be made faster on the systems we are currently running. Plus almost every one that says all the use cases has not actually programmed one or has any basic idea of macro or micro economics.

Further, there are literally millions of \"off plan\" sales (no real property exists, while full and partial payments for those notional properties have been made and will not be refunded).\n\nConsequently, there will be no \"necessary correction\" where property can be scooped up for pennies on the... uh, yeah, the bond debt being defaulted upon is mostly in the US dollar unit of account.\n\nThe Chinese government had better do fucking something (they're very worried about cultural revolution v2.0, but inaction is *exactly* how that happens).  They still haven't injected liquidity to half the level of Feb 2020.  Honestly, this would be a really excellent time for them to roll out their digital yuan to make short-shrifted property investors whole again.  If I were a Chinese real estate enterprise boardsitter (CCP installed or not), I'd already be on an airplane to that country I got a second citizenship in that lacks an extradition arrangement with China.\n\nThe biggest worry is \"contagion\".  The counter party arrangement in China is an opaque box, with many party officials sitting on company boards and inherently involved with many shady dealings.  How that will translate into other bonds being dumped on the market and how foreign holders of those bonds will seek to mitigate the coming spread of China's bad debt is absolutely unknown.\n\nI would look at places like Australia, Canada and New Zealand to see just how China's bad debt contagion spreads outside of the centrally planned sinosphere.  \n\nOne thing is absolutely for sure:  shit's about to get real interesting in the most Chinese way imaginable.\n\nFor trade ideas, [check this out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN0THKDR014)\n\nVan Metre also [has a good summary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rd7Jq_yIiE8)",

        "body": "The Stock Market Dropped Because There\u2019s Something Scarier Than Taxes, Tapers, and Contagion\nBy Ben Levisohn\nSept. 17, 2021 8:44 pm ET\n\nListen to article\nLength 4 minutes\n\nThe S&amp;P 500 saw its first close since June 18 below its 50-day moving average. For traders, it was very frightening.\nSpencer Platt/Getty Images\nWall Street has found something scarier than tapering, taxes, and China Evergrande Group combined. It\u2019s called the 50-day moving average.\n\nThe predictions of impending doom from Wall Street\u2019s talking heads continued this past week. The reasons for a pullback are many: The stock market has rallied for too long and has gone up too smoothly, the Federal Reserve is about to remove the bond buying that has helped prop markets up, taxes are ready to rise, economic data are slowing. None of it really left a mark.\n\nBut then the S&amp;P 500 dropped 0.6%, to 4432.99, over the week, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.1%, to 34,584.88, and the Nasdaq Composite slumped 0.5%, to 15,043.97. For the S&amp;P 500, it was the first close since June 18 below its 50-day moving average\u2014a technical measure of the previous 50 days\u2019 closes that often ends up acting as support or resistance and that currently sits at 4436.35. For traders, it was very frightening.\n\nThat the drop also occurred on options expiration day\u2014when options bets expire and are rolled over, typically a volatile day\u2014also makes the moment fraught. Since May, options expiration has been the time for the S&amp;P 500 to make a quick test of its 50-day moving average before a bounce higher. And when I say quick, I mean quick, as it usually took the index a day, maybe two, to rebound.\n\n\u201cThe 50-Day MA discussion has been pounded into our heads with every drawdown,\u201d writes Frank Cappelleri, desk strategist at Instinet. \u201cAnd while we may be sick of hearing about it, the dip buying around the line has been a real phenomenon.\u201d\n\n\nMarket Snapshot\nSource: FactSet\n%\nBarron's 400Index\nS&amp;P 500Index\nBarron'sFutureFocus StockIndex\nNASDAQCompositeIndex\nDow JonesIndustrialAverage\n2021\nSept.\n-5\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\nThis time has a different feel to it. The S&amp;P 500\u2019s sojourn near the 50-day has been longer, notes Jonathan Krinsky, chief market technician at Bay Crest Partners. It\u2019s been sitting near it for about six trading days now, without a big drop or big bounce. \u201cThe current set-up looks a bit more like a consolidation on the 50 DMA, as opposed to the prior quick \u2018V-shaped\u2019 dips,\u201d Krinsky writes. \u201cWhat we are saying is that the current way in which we got here feels a bit different than the last four to five times.\u201d\n\nStill, Krinsky acknowledges that one close below the 50-day isn\u2019t enough to panic. That\u2019s because the S&amp;P 500 has now gone 218 days without two closes below the average, the second-longest streak since 1990. We won\u2019t know if that streak breaks until the end of trading on Monday.\n\nREAD MORE TRADER\n\nNike Reports Earnings Thursday. Don\u2019t Expect Good News.\nSupply-Chain Issues Are About to Hit Earnings. What to Expect.\nThe market has plenty of excuses to break the 50-day, if it\u2019s so inclined. Maybe Evergrande (ticker: 3333.Hong Kong), the troubled Chinese property developer, will prove to be a Lehman moment and bring the world\u2019s markets down with it. Maybe the Fed will surprise everyone and start tapering this coming week. Maybe something is lurking out there like the Baba Yaga of the old fairy tales, and maybe it looks a lot like Keanu Reeves.\n\nBut perhaps all the September weakness and worry are a good thing, setting the market up for its next run. \u201cThe ACWI is oversold again, and sentiment is not too optimistic,\u201d writes Ned Davis Research\u2019s Tim Hayes, commenting on the MSCI All-Country World Index. \u201cThe market\u2019s resilience in the face of the negative September seasonality could be the preview of a bullish response to seasonal tendencies that turn favorable in the fourth quarter.\u201d",
