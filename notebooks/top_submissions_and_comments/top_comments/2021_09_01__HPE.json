They don't even know what AI really is and that it is now everywhere, every company is technically an \"AI\" company. \n\nNow if Tesla has a substantially large amount of data on self driving, larger than any competitors, that is an asset that Tesla can absolutely sell. Until everyone else has that data, then the asset is worthless. \n\nOne thing that history has proven though is that getting somewhere first doesn't necessarily mean making the most amount of money. A great example of this is MySpace who was then usurped by Facebook a few years later. Those Wright brothers sure did make a ton of money by discovering flight..right? E.F Codd invented the relational database at IBM but Oracle sure does make a TON more money off it today.",

Most of these companies will start using third party companies, akin to how PC manufacturers used Windows from Microsoft instead of creating their own OS. Initially some will try their hand at the market with their own bespoke solution(like the wild west days of 80's when we had commodores and sinclair spectrums).

They just launched a self-driving taxi service in San Francisco, a dense city with weird roads and many pedestrians.  \nTesla is boasting about FSD(which is between a very good cruise and a poor self driver). The key difference between waymo and tesla is that tesla is heavily reliant on an AI based system, whereas waymo(which does use AI) is heavily dependent on Geolocation and real time data.\n\n\\]&gt;The thesis is that Tesla is far ahead in its self-driving capabilities that other car makers just can't catch up.

I'm not deeply familiar with most of these companies, so I don't know what their revenue streams or growth prospects look like.  What I can say is that a lot of those names have been trading very high lately... AMD, Nvidia, TSM, ASML, etc. Those companies in particular all seem to have bright futures, but if there is any significant correction in tech stocks, you're very exposed, especially if you bought recently at high valuations.  You'll have very little margin of safety.\n\nAnd if there's any broader economic disruption, it's possible that not all of these companies make it out safe and sound, or at least as healthy as you'd like to seem them given current valuations.\n\nFor example, even good companies like Cisco didn't make it out in one piece from the dot-com bubble.  And old industry leaders like IBM and Intel have gotten hammered in the past two decades, while Microsoft made something of a surprise comeback after being declared dead around 2012.\n\nThe point is that if you've bought growth stories, that's OK, but it seems your whole portfolio is growth stories.  It's forward-looking.  Which is the idea, in a way, but IMO you want at least some of your portfolio dedicated to something that is solid in the present, and doesn't rely on a growth story in order to generate or even maintain returns.  The benefit of an ETF is you get a bit of everything, and even QQQ is quite diversified compared to your portfolio.  \n\nI'm new but this is my understanding of things.  I hope it made sense.",
