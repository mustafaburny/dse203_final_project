IHL also reported that the number of chains adding stores in 2019 has increased 56%, while the number of closing stores has decreased by 66% in the last year.\"\n\nit should be noted that GME is closing between 400 and 450 stores though:\n\nhttps://www.cnn.com/2020/09/10/investing/gamestop-store-closures/index.html\n\ni've also looked at several stores that are within the \"specialty retail\" group:\n\nhttps://finviz.com/screener.ashx?v=121&amp;f=ind_specialtyretail&amp;o=pc\n\nsorted by price-to-cash (P/C). a lot of them had great earnings in the last quarter, and many went up after. GME is the cheapest in the group in terms of P/C ratio, perhaps indicating a degree of upside\n\nfurther, MIK and BBW have earnings on dec. 3rd\n\nmaybe, *maybe*, completely guessing: their earnings might provide an indication of what will happen with GME on dec. 8, ah\n\nalthough, that should be combined with the fact that it's a console-release year, along with the fact that gaming is a massive and growing industry",

They belong in your retirement account and you check on them a few times per year.\n\nIf your source of income comes from working, you should be dedicating a portion of your paycheck to your retirement account - and a portion to your YOLO account.\n\nAs money shows up in your YOLO account, you light that fuse and pray for it to be a bottle rocket. If it explodes in your face, you wait until next payday. If it's a bottle rocket - you send 75% of those profits off to pasture (i.e. lock it up in a retirement account). The other 25% is a bonus bet you get to make, instead of having to wait for another paycheck.\n\nYou want to be playing with underlyings that are just stupid, volatile and wild. Super high IV when it's not earnings time. The ones that just make no sense, and they're swinging up and down violently every day. The more drama, the better. If you were betting on a horse, you don't want the big stud horse that everyone is betting on because the payout sucks. You want the horse that stopped in the middle of the last race to eat the shit on the ground from the horses in front of it. The one that has tourette syndrome. You want... the [Becky](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFs9jLN4siQ&amp;ab_channel=dnasewell) version of a horse. You will have no damn clue where it's going, but it's going somewhere - and fast. It's the unexpected move.\n\nWhen you buy that cheap OTM, and Becky happens to pop off while she's carrying you in Geralds bucket - you're turning that $100 into $10k. Risk $100 to make $10k? Fuck yes, all day long. Except, you can't do it with just any stock. It needs to be a Becky stock. (Can someone make me a meme of this, please?) How do you find Becky stocks?

They're not going to use their BTC profits to 100x pump shitcoins on Bittrex, Poloniex, and Binance like the retail traders did in the last bubble.\n\nThe biggest shitcoin narratives \"low fees, high TPS\" have been rekt since then too.  Traders who traded out of their BTC and ETH positions for shitcoins in the last bubble got burned badly.  I don't think people will fall for it to the same extent as they did last time.\n\nThe market clearly values the network effects and liquidity of BTC and ETH over the high throughput, low fees, and \"better tech\" shitcoin narratives.",

        "body": "Bitcoin supply and demand factors:\n\nBitcoin\u2019s supply is famously limited, with only 900 per day being created currently. Compare this to a trade volume around 3,000,000 daily. Unlike most commodities, an increased price does not lead to increased supply, so your Econ 101 supply curve is flat.\n\nThe recent bull run has instead been driven by increased demand, with four primary factors:\n\n* Institutional demand is the biggest story. When 150+ year old insurance company MassMutual buys in with a cool $250m, you know institutional acceptance is finally happening. Institutions hold just 15% of all Bitcoin and we should expect to see that increase dramatically this year.\n* New retail exposure. New demographics of retail buyers now have crypto exposure through easy, established channels like PayPal and Cashapp.\n* Payments use case. PornHub going crypto-only is a big deal IMO. Many people globally don\u2019t have credit cards and cryptocurrency holds the promise of actually increasing the reach of ecommerce. The internet revolutionized content delivery but has always been missing the same level of revolution in payments to complete the cycle. Porn has always been an innovation leader on the Internet, and if the PornHub experiment is successful, it could open the door for others.\n* Gold replacement. Investment banks have issued statements saying their clients are shifting their gold allocation to Bitcoin. Also, a survey of Millenials found that they prefer Bitcoin to gold. As fiat currencies devalue globally, Bitcoin gains.\n\nWe are just getting started and this bull run has a long way to go. I\u2019ve been in crypto professionally since 2013 and IMO we are nowhere close to the next top.",

I would just be a lot more picky of your sectors. You have way, wayyy too many tickers, which I'm sure you have realized. Just choose your top 3-5 secular growth sectors, play top 2 per sector and don't over diversify.",

It has been like arguing with a brick wall trying to talk with them. Now that the market is rallying, we can do our victory lap. Bears need to be put into hibernation until it crashes again.\n\nAs for bitcoin becoming a currency, I would not rule it out. Paypal adoption is moving in the right direction. Ultimately, I don't care. I'm happy to use it as digital gold.",
