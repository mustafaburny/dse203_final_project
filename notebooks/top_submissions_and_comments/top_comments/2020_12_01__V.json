        "author": "x2c3v4b5",
        "body": "Do not trade, just invest. They are not the same thing in my opinion and two completely different games to play. With respect to investing, my overall philosophy, attitude, and position is to simply not give a fuck and not use my brain too much. Trust me, I know how ridiculous, stupid, and counter-intuitive that sounds as well. So, let me elaborate on this stance:\n\n1. Personally, for me, regardless of conditions, there will never be change in plan/strategy (within the foreseeable future). As an individual with a stable income, high job security, DB Pension, and a decent emergency fund, I am always 100% equities and there will never be a change in buying more or less. Simply, I invest on average, half of my pay, every time I get paid (i.e. every two weeks) and I do not give a fuck about government stimulus, wars, low growth times, high growth times, COVID vaccine, no COVID vaccine, \"all time highs\", \"all time lows\" or wherever the fuck we are on the \"graph\". I do not care if the market goes up, down, left, right, sideways, V-shape, W-shape, XYZ-shape, etc. Seriously, I really do not give two shits. Volatility does not mean anything to me since I am a super long-term investor (25-50 years) and I do not respect it or fear it.\n\n2. I realize that I am not an intelligent individual, I recognize that I am not an educated individual (i.e. high school only), I acknowledge that I cannot predict the future, and I certainly cannot time the market over the long-term. I believe that time in the market is superior to timing the market (as per academic studies). Therefore, I will continue to invest on average, half of my pay every two weeks because I am boring, I do not give a fuck about market volatility, and I do not have materialistic wants or needs.\n\n3. Don't try to \"get rich quick\", don't attempt to \"buy low, sell high\", don't buy shit/garbage, don't buy penny stocks, don't buy \"meme stocks\", don't worry about \"missing out\" (i.e. FOMO), don't worry about other people's gains (fuck everyone else), and/or don't try to do some smart shit like \"day trade\". This is not a short-term or medium-term game for me and it should not be for you either. Your mind should be on the future and you should be laser focused on building wealth slowly through the passage of time. Delayed gratification pays off and academic studies have demonstrated that delayed gratification is one of the most effective personal traits of successful people (whatever the fuck \"success\" means in those specific studies).\n\n4. You should consider investing in an \"index exchange traded fund\" or \"index ETF\" if you do not feel comfortable picking individual companies. An index ETF is essentially an investment product which contains numerous individual stocks (usually some of the more bigger dominant ones in the market); therefore, giving you exposure to a wide array of sectors/companies. As such, you reduce your investment risk via diversification. As well, most, if not all, academic studies reveal that average retail investors (such as you and I) will underperform an index ETF over the long-term if we choose to pick individual stocks.\n\n5. Recessions, crashes, dips, depressions, or whatever the fuck people here want to call it is good for you as long as you are not buying shit/garbage and as long as you have a long time horizon. When these events occur, this should be seen as a time of opportunity. The last thing you want to do is panic and sell your investments. It is said that the most important organ in investing is not the brain, but rather, the stomach. Turn your brain off, be disciplined, and \"stomach\" these temporary dips, crashes, recessions, and/or bullshit events. Instead, embrace these times of opportunity since everything goes on sale; and therefore, you get to buy more securities/assets at a discount. Basically, do not fear these times, embrace them with open arms alongside a smile and let the weak minded/stomached people panic sell to you as they shit their pants. You do not even need to rob these folks because they let you rob them and then these people think that you are doing them a favor by giving them money in exchange for their undervalued assets/securities. In the past, there have always been bullshit macroscopic events that are out of our control and we have always gotten through it (less the Japanese Nikkei and perhaps some other markets but this is part of the game as well as the risk you take in investing).\n\n6. You should be building a financial castle brick-by-brick for you, your loved ones, and future generations every two weeks (i.e. when you get paid) regardless of what happens (even if this time is \"different\" due to COVID because you should be a disciplined, strong stomach, long-term minded investor with a high degree of delayed gratification who just doesn't give two fucks). Simply put, just buy as many fucking bricks as you can every two weeks until you retire or die and slowly build your castle's infrastructure as time progresses. There are no guarantees; however, you should have a pretty solid castle in the end.\n\n7. Finally, again, generally speaking, you should not give a shit what happens with the world, economy, politics, monetary policy, fiscal policy, and/or stock market (with respect to how it affects your purchasing behavior). These events are things outside of your own control, so fuck it. \"Catastrophic\" events have happened before and they will continue to happen within your lifetime. So, you need to mentally prepare yourself and accept this fact as part of your investing journey until your existence in this universe has ceased. It is absolutely imperative and crucial that you continue with an unshakable discipline and plan to buy globally diversified index-ETFs and/or well-established, high-quality companies with wide economic/competitive moats with complete disregard and disrespect for macroscopic events out of your control.\n\nKeep buying as many bricks as you can when you get paid, stop giving a fuck, stop using your pre-frontal cortex in attempts to do \"smart shit\", strengthen your stomach, and good luck with both personal finance as well as investing! Wishing you all the best! =)",

        "author": "x2c3v4b5",
        "body": "Not really rules; however, with respect to investing, my overall philosophy, attitude, and position is to simply not give a fuck and not use my brain too much. Trust me, I know how ridiculous, stupid, and counter-intuitive that sounds as well. So, let me elaborate on this stance:\n\n1. Personally, for me, regardless of conditions, there will never be change in plan/strategy (within the foreseeable future). As an individual with a stable income, high job security, DB Pension, and a decent emergency fund, I am always 100% equities and there will never be a change in buying more or less. Simply, I invest on average, half of my pay, every time I get paid (i.e. every two weeks) and I do not give a fuck about government stimulus, wars, low growth times, high growth times, COVID vaccine, no COVID vaccine, \"all time highs\", \"all time lows\" or wherever the fuck we are on the \"graph\". I do not care if the market goes up, down, left, right, sideways, V-shape, W-shape, XYZ-shape, etc. Seriously, I really do not give two shits. Volatility does not mean anything to me since I am a super long-term investor (25-50 years) and I do not respect it or fear it.\n\n2. I realize that I am not an intelligent individual, I recognize that I am not an educated individual (i.e. high school only), I acknowledge that I cannot predict the future, and I certainly cannot time the market over the long-term. I believe that time in the market is superior to timing the market (as per academic studies). Therefore, I will continue to invest on average, half of my pay every two weeks because I am boring, I do not give a fuck about market volatility, and I do not have materialistic wants or needs.\n\n3. Don't try to \"get rich quick\", don't attempt to \"buy low, sell high\", don't buy shit/garbage, don't buy penny stocks, don't buy \"meme stocks\", don't worry about \"missing out\" (i.e. FOMO), don't worry about other people's gains (fuck everyone else), and/or don't try to do some smart shit like \"day trade\". This is not a short-term or medium-term game for me and it should not be for you either. Your mind should be on the future and you should be laser focused on building wealth slowly through the passage of time. Delayed gratification pays off and academic studies have demonstrated that delayed gratification is one of the most effective personal traits of successful people (whatever the fuck \"success\" means in those specific studies).\n\n4. You should consider investing in an \"index exchange traded fund\" or \"index ETF\" if you do not feel comfortable picking individual companies. An index ETF is essentially an investment product which contains numerous individual stocks (usually some of the more bigger dominant ones in the market); therefore, giving you exposure to a wide array of sectors/companies. As such, you reduce your investment risk via diversification. As well, most, if not all, academic studies reveal that average retail investors (such as you and I) will underperform an index ETF over the long-term if we choose to pick individual stocks.\n\n5. Recessions, crashes, dips, depressions, or whatever the fuck people here want to call it is good for you as long as you are not buying shit/garbage and as long as you have a long time horizon. When these events occur, this should be seen as a time of opportunity. The last thing you want to do is panic and sell your investments. It is said that the most important organ in investing is not the brain, but rather, the stomach. Turn your brain off, be disciplined, and \"stomach\" these temporary dips, crashes, recessions, and/or bullshit events. Instead, embrace these times of opportunity since everything goes on sale; and therefore, you get to buy more securities/assets at a discount. Basically, do not fear these times, embrace them with open arms alongside a smile and let the weak minded/stomached people panic sell to you as they shit their pants. You do not even need to rob these folks because they let you rob them and then these people think that you are doing them a favor by giving them money in exchange for their undervalued assets/securities. In the past, there have always been bullshit macroscopic events that are out of our control and we have always gotten through it (less the Japanese Nikkei and perhaps some other markets but this is part of the game as well as the risk you take in investing).\n\n6. You should be building a financial castle brick-by-brick for you, your loved ones, and future generations every two weeks (i.e. when you get paid) regardless of what happens (even if this time is \"different\" due to COVID because you should be a disciplined, strong stomach, long-term minded investor with a high degree of delayed gratification who just doesn't give two fucks). Simply put, just buy as many fucking bricks as you can every two weeks until you retire or die and slowly build your castle's infrastructure as time progresses. There are no guarantees; however, you should have a pretty solid castle in the end.\n\n7. Now that you understand how to build a castle through investing, although it may not be your duty, you should try and help others build their castles as well. Remember where you came from. Remember that at one point in time that you did not know how to build that castle. Remember that at one point in your life, you did not know how to invest, what it meant, or what money truly represents. One day, your entire consciousness as well as your physical body will be completely erased from the universe (as far as we know). Therefore, you should spread your knowledge of investing to those who are willing to open their minds, hearts, ears, and eyes. As you move forward through space and time, you will one day pass the accumulation phase of your life and you will begin to enter old age and a new phase of life. This is the phase of giving. Remember to be generous with both your knowledge and your money in order to help others while leaving this universe a better place. \n\n8. Finally, again, generally speaking, you should not give a shit what happens with the world, economy, politics, monetary policy, fiscal policy, and/or stock market (with respect to how it affects your purchasing behavior). These events are things outside of your own control, so fuck it. \"Catastrophic\" events have happened before and they will continue to happen within your lifetime. So, you need to mentally prepare yourself and accept this fact as part of your investing journey until your existence in this universe has ceased. It is absolutely imperative and crucial that you continue with an unshakable discipline and plan to buy globally diversified index-ETFs and/or well-established, high-quality companies with wide economic/competitive moats with complete disregard and disrespect for macroscopic events out of your control.\n\nKeep buying as many bricks as you can when you get paid, stop giving a fuck, stop using your pre-frontal cortex in attempts to do \"smart shit\", strengthen your stomach, and good luck with both personal finance as well as investing! Wishing you all the best! This is what I call the \"I don't give a fuck strategy\".",

Instead of regurgitating numbers from the fact sheets and earnings I will give my explanation for why I think there is further room for growth, including DOC. Quick summary is financials are very strong over the past year(Cannot wait to see Q4 earnings!!!). \n\nOh, and Canadian health care systems need innovation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhile I think CloudMD will be a slower burn, as the provincial governments are starting  to realize how broken our health care systems are, and the effectivness of telehealth I can only see the market expanding. The Ontario government alone is investing over $15 million into virtual care as hospitals have been overwhelmed throughout the pandemic. Try calling the Ontario telehealth hotline and see how long you are on hold...\n\nAdoption of virtual care Canada wide has been massive over the past year and when you see how much time it saves a the patient I can't see virtual care being swept under the rug post-pandemic. Pre-pandemic, from my own experience and limited survey capabilities, I would say the average wait time in a walk-in clinic was 1-2 hours(suggesting you got there at 20 minutes before the clininc opened and got close to the front of the line) and an ER visit you'd wait for 3 hours on a good day. With these virtual care providers you can now book an appointment at a time that is convienient to you, and have a prescription sent to your pharmacy of referal after the same 10 minute converstaion with the doctor, without the 3 hour wait. \n\nIf you take a look at what services are provided with EMR and virtual care, I dont see how anyone can argue the appeal. [https://cloudmd.ca/?utm\\_source=google&amp;utm\\_medium=cpc&amp;utm\\_campaign=sign\\_up&amp;utm\\_content=c10&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiAifz-BRDjARIsAEElyGICGuLkgxeRRk-YecYe8Hhif20aKd77GqBvOzNXUsQSAQtmsbT0uQAaApRuEALw\\_wcB](https://cloudmd.ca/?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=sign_up&amp;utm_content=c10&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiAifz-BRDjARIsAEElyGICGuLkgxeRRk-YecYe8Hhif20aKd77GqBvOzNXUsQSAQtmsbT0uQAaApRuEALw_wcB)\n\nThe efficiency of being able to access these services from the comfort of your own home I believe is quite remarkable. No more embarassing visits to the family doctor to get your teenage daughter birth control, easily renewing prescriptions, access to be able to ask a doctor about your symptoms instead of self medicating on WebMD... \n\nEven telus is branching into the telehealth industry with its launch of Babylon and aquirment of EQ Care. They are also seeing the potential for growth in this industry. Babylon however is currently not very user friendly, and seems like a slightly rushed product, where I have heard nothing but great things from CloudMD, VirtualCLininc+ and Tiahealth\n\nThere is also not argument there is a client basis for this. If the pandemic has promoted one thing its the use of technology in our daily lives and not just for younger generations. I am sure there are many fathers, mothers, and grandparents who are much more tech savy now then they were in January, and the appeal to do things online has now been cemented into how we live our lives.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhile these may not be 100.00 price point companies in the next year, I can see estimates of 50+% grow continuing over the next few years.\n\nIf I missed anything in this discussion its because its dinner time. I will continue to reply.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR, Company finanials are strong, Earning increasing rapidly, Lots of investment in telehealth, Its way more efficient than the current and pre-pandemic systems. Will be adopted into the future.",

        "body": "A stock option is a contract that gives the buyer the right (AKA the Option) to buy or sell a given stock for a given amount (AKA the strike price) for a given amount of time. A call option is the right to buy shares, while a put option is the right to sell shares.\n\nHow you make money off these is if you buy a call option and the price goes up, you can buy at the low strike price and immediately sell at the higher market price. The inverse is true for buying put options, where if the price falls you can buy cheap shares on the market and immediately sell them at the strike price.\n\nSince options cost a fraction of buying shares, it is possible for a $1 increase/decrease in the stock price to equal a $5, $10, $20, or even higher profit for yourself. This is \"leverage,\" and it can work against you just as easily because if the stock moves in the opposite direction you want your investment can go POOF.\n\nYou can take the opposite side and sell calls/puts that you expect to expire worthless. This is effective to as most options expire worthless and this is statistically more profitable long term (the house always wins eventually, as they say). However, since selling options involve getting paid modest sums up front and taking a small risk of castastrophic losses there's generally heavy collateral requirements.\n\nBut the real money is in spreads, using combinations of buys/sells at various strike prices to get all sorts of risk/reward tradeoffs. Options and other derivatives are associated with high risk trading, and rightfully so, but not that YOU can choose any level of risk you want. Options, live up to their name.\n\n[This guy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzkKFRx1Dhk&amp;list=PL2bLh5ebfay_22mPZKDwqFBf8hEVeua6Y) can explain the rest better than I can, though.",

It was supposed to make 4 stops - Philly, Miami, New Orleans and Houston. Once it hit Miami, we knew it wouldn\u2019t make it in enough time and unloaded it all to beat the deadline before the 25% hit. That was the last time tariffs drove prices. \n\nSince then prices have been driven on supply v demand and the cost of raw materials. \n\nCOVID wrecked the entire supply chain. \n\nThat\u2019s where we are now at and it\u2019s going to get worse before it gets better.  \n\nGood luck though!",

        "body": "My reserve unit is in the bay area, and my unit is cyber. So.. most of my colleagues are either working in non-cleared tech in the bay area, or in defense contracting in a cleared position. Those utilizing their clearance overwhelmingly make more money than those working at big tech companies in the bay, and like I said, it doesn't matter whether you're talking about with or without a degree, it matters that you're comparing apples to apples. The fact that I know three people, two at google, one at salesforce, all with bachelors degrees making less than six figs and working their asses of in the Bay Area tells me a lot. Half the reason I joined is because my transfer was accepted to a university in the bay and saw a lot of my older classmates graduating and celebrating their new job making 60k.. in silicon valley.. that was over 5 years ago now, but not a lot has changed thanks to an incredible amount of people getting into coding and tons of H1B visa workers keeping wages down. It's very competitive, and I see some of my reservist buddies working their asses off in big tech to make about half what I make..  and my job is pretty gravy. There is a higher cap when it comes to tech, but those people making 300-500k a year are not very common, they are the top of their game and you're talking 10+ years experience with grad school and they are working their asses off. 800k.. that is entirely unrealistic and probably less than .01% of people working in tech in the bay area. I think people are a little out of touch with the reality here and watch a lot of movies. A cursory search of average salaries in San Jose, SF, and Santa Clara will tell you that the median salary for a computer programmer is about 78k even in these areas. I'm not super familiar with the DC area, but I have a few people working cyber as their civilian job as contractors and a few in government  agencies making around 300k once you factor in COL allowances, but they usually have 12+ years experience and a grad degree.. but far less competition in the workplace. For my contracting job, I'm more sysad than I am cyber, which is kind of funny since my only 'experience' for getting this job was my 6 month A school.. which was just cyber. Anyway, the guys who have been here for 10+ years max out around 300k a year. Not 500k a year, but you can buy a lakeside 2,500sqft house out here in the high 300k range so I would say it evens out at least. One complaint I also hear a lot about working in big tech in silicon valley from some of my reservist colleagues is the office politics.. especially at Salesforce and Google.. apparently it's cutthroat and they hate how much backstabbing goes on. I don't really have to deal with any of that at my location.. just super chill vets and reservists here and people look out for each other, but I have no idea what it's like at other locations, especially east coast. I'm always on the search of course and if some day I can make the same amount with the same qualifications and not have to maintain this clearance the rest of my life, then I would probably jump on that opportunity, but I don't see that as the reality. It seems like tech wages will continue to be suppressed outside of the cleared domain. I think going forward this issue will only become worse and having a clearance will become more valuable. I was offered a job at Amazon DoD services, but they wanted a Full Scope Poly in addition to a TS, and I, having only a CI poly didn't want to deal with that.. but the pay is lucrative for someone with very little experience just because the pool of people they can pull from is so limited. Scarcity creates value. I would seriously not be so quick to advise someone with a clearance to just throw it away.. it could ruin them financially.",

Are you absolutely sure about that?\n\n&gt; Is PayPal sketchy?\n\n\nWell, from my experiencing using it to sell things, hell yes, PayPal is sketchy.  They have their own rules and screw the customer at every turn.  But of course you and I mean sketchy in comparison to these mtgox type scams I've heard about and in comparison, so yes PayPal is not going to vanish in the night.\n\n&gt; Is the CashApp sketchy? Is Square sketchy?\n\nAren't those the same?  Is Bitcoin on cash app for individuals or just Square merchants?\n\n&gt; Third, crypto wallets are difficult to use with no experience but I guarantee if you make one transaction using one it\u2019s easy from there; what task isn\u2019t tough at first?It\u2019s like when a middle school aged child starts doing algebra. At first it seems daunting but after a few lessons things get easier and you wonder why it ever seemed so difficult in the first place.\n\nI'll take your word for it.  I've jusg seen hundreds of messages where people post that they lost their bitcoins due to wallet issues, and then edgelords mock them for not doing these series of non-intuitive hold and cold and medium wallet transfers and for not making copies of copies of their keys, etc. \n\n&gt; The mining of the Bitcoin does take some electricity but it\u2019s the mining that makes the network decentralized. \n\nI'm not talking about the mining which of course is massively wasteful on electricity.  I mean the computation energy needed to verify a transaction.  Isn't that expensive on electricity and takes a long time to clear?\n\n&gt; The decentralization is key. Without it that's just another currency controlled by a central figure\n\nWell, I'm not as averse to hard currency.  I'll take any pesky centralized currency you are sick of holding :-)\n\n\n&gt; As long as the average person buys and holds Bitcoin long term the elite won\u2019t ever be able to get it all. \n\nBut would that just guarantee it's death?  What good is a currency that doesn't circulate, which nobody is willing to use for buying and selling things?  It would be like illiquid real estate.\n\n\n&gt; Remember, there will only ever be 21 million bitcoin.\n\nI've heard that. But I've also heard there's only 10% left to be unlocked?\n\n\n&gt; And don\u2019t forget, crypto can make buying things online more anonymous because your name doesn\u2019t or personal info doesn\u2019t need to be attached to crypto. \n\nTo me that would be a drawback.  I don't buy anything illegal, and I'd rather my neighbors pay their share of taxes, so I don't it to be easy for them to do tax fraud.  And can't any Sec Treasury declare a ban at any time on the hidden transactions? \n\n\n&gt; As you can see I believe in Bitcoin and what it can do for society. \n\nSo what do see as the benefit to society?  You've said it would bypass central bank, which may or may not benefit society.  And the other feature was making tax dodging and money laundering easy for criminals, which is basically the opposite of good for society.  \n\nI'm still wondering about the heavy cost and delays of transactions.  \n\nBut to me, something that would meet your goal of an alternative to central money would be if say Google started Google dollars and let people of any station in life transact instantly, safely, for free.  \n\nThey'd instantly chop the legs out of elitist banks and Visa/MasterCard/PayPal, and democratize transactions for everyone.  I'd think that's something you'd appreciate?  \n\nSo all the societal benefit but without the societal drawbacks of Bitcoin.\n\n&gt; Get in now before the FOMO starts.\n\nWell frankly I did a long time ago, before bitcoin crashed hard.  But I did it through proxies like Square and Overstock and Nvidia.  But not sure if there's a current proxy I like.",
