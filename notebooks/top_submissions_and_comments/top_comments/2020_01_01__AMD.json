        "body": "Cheers to that. AMD is really making an effort to overshadow it\u2019s competitors. Their technology is years beyond the top level performance products of their competition, not to mention their novel RDNA architecture as a backbone for a series of product line ups help to solidify a strong future heritage of its products just like Intel did with Its processors. I\u2019d expect expenditures to be high for this coming Q1 given their extensive development in the new architecture and in their 7nm. As soon as they ramp up production, a bit of marketing via esports sector and professional workplace sector, their market cap is going to be north of 100B quicker than most can see. The only thing setting them back is their fund allocation and debt management. If they can get the money towards the right development (which they are with graphics and gaming) they\u2019ll bake up a storm and become incredible my profitable. Their partnerships are a great sign of their success, or in other words, Apple, HP, Microsoft, Lenovo, etc are keystone companies that can help gauge the potential market exposure that AMD will get.\n\nMy position/plan: \n\nCurrently 45/46/47/48 Calls expiring 1/17. \n\nWill sell 3 days before expiration hoping it will go up and max out on the gains. \n\nRoll profits into TBD calls",

        "body": "AMD stock price explained by two things:\n\n1. 10% of the price is their great  microarchitecture and multi-chip packaging  combined with  TSMC's prosess. \n2.  90% of the price is  Intel's failed 10nm process technology transition.  Intel dropped the ball and there is room for growth for AMD. \n\nAMD's market share 2019:\n\n* Desktop      20%   \n* Notebook    15% \n* Server          4%\n\nAMD will grow market share  fast next few years. They are expected to more than double their server market share to something like 10% next year alone.  Their Forward P/E is 43.09, PEG Ratio next 5 years is 3.11.  Their success is  limited only by TMSC's capacity. They will win  most deals from Intel if they can deliver the chips. \n\nIntel took  calculated risk in their  attempt to get ahead without EUV lithography and it failed spectacularly. \n\nThere is no reason to expect that Intel's next major process node tech  is failure but it takes several years. I fully expect Intel to be fully back within 5 years  with their  new process and packaging. Until it's ready, they are refining the existing process technology and losing market share.  AMD has few years to gain market share and grow into a big boy that takes on Intel as equal. \n\nThe new lithography process  transition is always a risk. Intel made a misstep and Global Foundries quit the 7nm game.  TSMC or Samsung might fail in their next big process. AMD is now fully reliant on TSMC. \n\n(Btw. Names like 10nm and 7nm are just commercial names and not comparable between companies. \nIntel's 10nm is 100 million transistors per mm\u00b2. TSMC's 7nm Mobile is 96 million transistors per mm\u00b2)\n\nSummary: If you want to value  AMD, look at what happens between TSMC and Intel.",
