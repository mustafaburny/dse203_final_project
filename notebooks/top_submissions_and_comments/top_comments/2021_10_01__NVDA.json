Then you do another trade say NFLX Put options at 2.28 by entering at 2.28, and selling later at 2.97, you just made $69 of profit (without fees/commission).\n\nAll you did there was 2 trades.

I don't currently own any shares, but I'm rooting for this company longterm because he seems like such a genuinely good natured fellow.\n\nI've daytraded and swing traded the stock a few times. Buying the stock at it's price right now, (around 8 bucks), seems like a screaming steal. You can be conservative with it, and just ride it from $8 to $12. The only real problem is that I do think we're headed for a major correction which is going to see huge megacaps like AMZN, MSFT, AAPL, NVDA all down 20 to 25 percent off their all time highs, and what does that mean for a tiny company like HYLN? Could HYLN drop all the way to say 6 bucks a share if the entire market tanks?\n\nThat's really my only hesitation in loading the boat on HYLN. I will say this though, if the market does indeed tank, and HYLN drops to $6, it will be time to buy as many shares as I possibly can stomach.

I remember buying Facebook for $257 earlier this year and it went all the way to $383 at one point. Look at the run NVDA has been on. There's plenty of other stocks that keep pushing towards their ATH's.\n\nThere are a few blue chips that have traded in a very narrow range for quite some time like AAPL, AMZN &amp; AMD, but I see those as more the exception than the rule.\n\nWild valuations wouldn't be the only catalyst for a major correction though. There's literally like 10 major things I can mention that could be the catalyst. \n\nMy current theory is that inflation is going to continue to get out of hand, and the Fed is going to announce on November 2nd that they will begin the tapering process immediately and will likely raise rates sooner than previously expected. This is going to cause a sea of red that will make November, December and the first half of January a time when you're not going to be wanting to check your portfolio on a daily, or even weekly basis. \n\nOf course, maybe I'm just having a fever dream and these are the ramblings of a madman",

        "body": "&gt; It's not C-suite, it's mid that they've tackled most aggressively\n\nI disagree, kinda. Yes, mid level got hammered, but I am arguing that the c-levels were the ones who were at the root of the problem. The previous c-suite levels were optimizing for revenue and profit (short term) at the expense of growth / long term flourishing. They created a toxic culture for engineers to work in. Many were underpaid relative to their contributions and left for competitors or were poached (ie: huge bleed to amd and nvidia). This was especially true at the high talent level, which is arguably the most important. There is absolutely no denying that. This leaves intel in a bad spot from an engineering talent point of view, as yes, you need engineers at intel to make the company work. Without engineers you can't design new CPU's and innovate. This has been reflected in the share price.\n\n&gt; Yes, they've brought a lot of the old team back, however this is just deferring the problem\n\nMaybe. It depends on how funds are allocated. If you don't pay the engineers well enough, or give them a large enough R&amp;D budget, of course they are going to fail. The previous management was pinching pennies like crazy, and bled the R&amp;D budget dry. This is why intel kept failing over &amp; over. They were not investing (very much, relatively speaking) into growth and innovation. The C-suites got complacent with their market lead, pinched pennies to increase revenues / profits (instead of innovate), then suddenly had competitors crushing them from all sides (amd, nvidia, arm, apple, etc.).\n\nMy argument is that the new management has realized this, and is showing signs of turning it around. Bringing back the old team, hiring new talent, spending over $100b on building new fabs, securing gov contracts, etc, all within 8 months of new management. This suggests to me, that they have at least identified the underlying issues and is working towards resolving them. Previous management was trying to increase revenues by gutting the company from the inside. \n\n\n&gt; Ok so they finally completed a node improvement after 6 years and that's enough to convince you they will nail the next 2 by 2024 (which is what they need to hit their roadmap).\n\nThe completed node isn't what convinced me they will turn it around. It's a good sign, but not an end all \"Intel is back!\". Of course that's not true. It's far, far from the truth. I am looking at it from a risk adjusted point of view. They have a ton of products in their pipeline that are being released soon (ie: their gpu's using TSMC 6nm. They reserved tsmc 3nm as well for more gpu's, as well as server xeons). They have the new FABS coming being built. If they didn't think there was a good chance of being able to produce a viable gpu, they wouldn't have reserved tsmc's 3nm for it.\n\n&gt; If you can't see any downside risk from here then think towards what happens if Granite Rapids, Emerald Rapids and Diamond Rapids also trail the competition? What is Intel worth at 50% DC share? What about 30%? What happens to margins then?\n\nWell, the big thing with INTC is that the US gov needs them (and other govs). They are too big to fail. AMD doesn't have its own fabs. It doesn't matter if INTC is slower / makes worse chips in this regard. The US gov &amp; military will still use them. They won't use chips fabricated on foreign soil as it's a national security risk. Countries have realized that the China / Taiwain situation is not looking good, and having the majority of chips produced in the world there, is a global security risk. Intel is investing &gt; $120b into new fabs (that AMD doesn't have) to produce chips for automakers, gov, military, etc. Even if AMD takes 100% of the consumer market, the us government will prop intel up.",

I am going to post my YOLO and due diligence when account is 45 days old. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Growth**\n\n- Their next gen cpu's (alder lake) leaks suggest that they outperform amd 5950x in both single &amp; multithreaded benchmarks. We will know for sure in early nov (nov 4th, rumored release date). I wanted to buy before then. https://www.forbes.com/sites/antonyleather/2021/09/27/new-benchmark-leak-reveals-impressive-performance-of-intels-12900k-12700k-and-12600k-alder-lake-processors/ \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n- Intel has basically bought out all of TSMC's 3nm nodes (https://www.techspot.com/news/90780-intel-has-reportedly-secured-majority-tsmc-3nm-production.html). This is insanely bullish for intel. There will be none left for AMD or NVidia. Even apple gets cucked. People *think* that it means that intel is giving up on their own fabs. They are drastically mistaken. This is a double dick size alpha power move by intel. \n\n 1. Their competition will have a difficult time obtaining fabs to build their next gen cpu's. \n\n 2. Intel can use these 3nm nodes to stay relevant / potentially be top dog while building their new fabs. This gives them time to transition.\n\n 3. Their new fabs are using ASML's next gen tech (ie: ASML's EUV chip-printing machines). Intel will get them before TSMC &amp; Samsung. There have been many closed door meeting between Gelsinger (intels new CEO) and ASML. https://fortune.com/2021/09/10/intel-ceo-big-honking-fab-planned-eu-europe-most-advanced/\n\n&gt; Thanks to an agreement the Intel CEO struck with his immediate counterpart at ASML, whom Gelsinger has already met three times face-to-face in the six months since taking the helm, the Intel facility should be the first to employ the Dutch company\u2019s upcoming \u201chigh numerical aperture\u201d EUV chip-printing machines. (ASML customers Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., known as TSMC, and Samsung are on a waiting list, however.)\n\n&gt; This second generation evolution of ASML\u2019s extreme ultraviolet photolithography can reduce the size of transistors\u2014the building blocks of integrated semiconducting circuits\u2014to just 20 angstroms (\u00c5). That would make them less than a third in length of the current seven-nanometer nodes found in many of today\u2019s smartphones. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n- Management changed. This is the biggest point for me. They booted out the finance bean counter, and replaced him with Gelsinger. Gelsinger was the CTO of intel during their glory years and is known as being a super strong engineer. An engineer leading intel sounds 100x better to me than a finance guy trying to cut corners. He is credited with desigining some of their flagship cpu's / architectures that made Intel relevant in the first place. He knows what has to be done.\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Gelsinger\n\n- Within his first 6-8 months, all of the above is occuring. They are literally investing over half their market cap into new fabs alone. Plus, there have been some major deals struck with the US gov / military.\n\n\n- New fabs: Investing ~120b. Two in the states. The ones in europe. Has already started construction on them.\n\n- Hopping into the GPU game. Intel is known for having a good integrated graphics team. I would think that they have enough experience to pull off the dedicated gpu. Time will tell. https://www.pcgamer.com/intel-claimed-to-be-officially-targeting-rtx-3070-performance-with-first-alchemist-gpu/\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Boomer value**\n\n- Market Cap: ~220b\n\n- P/E: ~12\n\n- 80b revenue\n\n- Stock has been sideways for the last ~3 months, down ~20% from it's peak earlier in the year. The LEAPS I bought have a 3:1 payoff, if it retraces back to $67. ~8-10:1 payoff if my targets hit.\n\n- Personally, my target is ~450-500b market cap. This would put it's P/E ~22-24 (much lower than AMD's). The points above suggest to me that the new management is heavily investing in growth and turning the company around. From a value investing perspective, intel is undervalued via basically all metrics as is.\n\n**Current position, 1100 Jan 2023 $55 INTC calls.**\n\nMy yolo post (I think is hidden because account is new): https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pxh24d/intel_yolo_2023_leaps/\n\nGoodluck out there",

Even if they make a good GPU let's say two years down the road (one for planning, another for actual production because of semiconductors), the software support for it is gonna be close to none. The reason I use a nvidia card and not AMD is that so much more machine learning support is on nvidia. This means large cloud computing companies such as amazon and google won't use AMD or Intel. Maybe in two years, i might change my opinion, but the value trap status still hasn't changed.",

        "body": "Kinda new myself, but my take so far. I think there's probably a lot of variation depending on many factors. For me as someone young it'll look very different to someone close to retirement.\n\nInvest in anything that improves your own education/income potential would likely yield the highest returns.\n\nFor \"normal \"investments i'd say chasing dividends over growth doesnt seem to make sense when planning to hold for a long time. Although i guess a small portion put into some REIT could be an option to diversify? Also don't really see the upside of bonds in my situation, maybe something to add close to retirement to take out volatility.\n\nI'd probably put like 80% in some diversified world etf like VTI in the US (for me it would be something equivalent from my country). Just buy and hold forever. Boring, but it requires low maintenance and the real gains are from the compounding effect that accumulates over time. Maybe check in twice a year and keep an eye out for crashes to be ready to buy a dip.\n\n20% in individual stocks or sector etfs. Partly to have a small chance of increasing returns, out of interest, and to learn a bit. But honestly i probably shouldn't go with more than 5, simply because it's necessary to keep a closer eye on the news. Mostly in larger caps that i assume will have long term growth higher than the average market. So something like the usual suspects of apple/microsoft/google, something from the semiconductor industry (since i know a bit about that) either an individual stock like nvidia/asml or a etf like SMH, and disney also looks interesting. Lastly a small portion as sort of a \"gamble\": So a smaller riskier company that has larger upsides. No concrete ideas there yet, i guess something from the bio/med sector or anything to do with space like rocket lab?\n\nPersonally not a fan of crypto, although it's hard to argue against the returns (in hinsight going all in 10 years ago would have made you filthy rich now). So i guess up to 5% or so could go in bitcoin/ethereum.",

There could be a major correction or crash in the next 7 months, that could chop the entire value of your portfolio in half. Maybe even worse than half.\n\nCan you live with that?\n\nIf you can live with that, my suggestion would be to buy whichever one of these tickers are the most on sale next week:\n\nASML\nADBE\nMSFT\nNVDA\nAMD\nAAPL \nAMZN\nGOOG\nTSM\n\nLook at the 52 week high of each of these companies, and then see which ones have fallen the farthest from their 52 week high. Then, next week, watch all of these tickers closely and see which one happens to be dipping the most at that particular time, and put 1/4th your money into that ticker. Rinse and repeat with the 3/4ths of your portfolio.\n\nWhen you're DCA'ing the $700/$800 each month, again take a look at this list and look for tickers that are the farthest from their 52 week high. \n\nI think the odds are pretty good that the highest end blu chip tech stocks will rally at some point during the next 7 months, but you've got to understand that risk is a part of this thing. There could be a huge stock meltdown and then honestly, I'd think you'd have to postpone getting your car or look for some other income source at that point.\n\n\nRisk = Reward\n\nNo Risk = No Reward",
