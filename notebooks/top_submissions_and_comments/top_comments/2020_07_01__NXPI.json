        "body": "I have some money tucked away for the Snowflake and Palantir IPOs.  No idea what the tickers are yet or potential dates, but thanks to a bunch of people on Reddit I now have google alerts set up to help me track them.\n\nSPCE - I keep a few shares in a nonretirement account because I think they are in a really good position to make commercial space travel possible and hope to use it some day.  I keep some in an roth account for swing trading - just sold for a small profit and watching for the next drop to buy back in.\n\nOther than that, I have a list of EV related stocks I'll be researching this weekend.  They've been on my watchlist for a few weeks and I'm not sure what the sudden run up is.  I'm guessing at least some of this is a by product of TSLA going up, but I won't know till I've done some research.  Here's my EV watch list:\n\nNIO - Recent approval for 10billion Yuan line of credit.  I think I might have seen some actual car news on them recently.\n\nBLINK - Charging equipment.\n\nPLUG - Hydrogen &amp; fuel cells.  \" Its fuel cell system solution is designed to replace lead-acid batteries in electric material handling vehicles and industrial trucks for some distribution and manufacturing businesses.\"\n\nSHLL - Acquisition company that will get Hymillion into the market.  From what I saw on their website, Hymillion already has EV trucks on the road.  Missed it in the $10 range.  It's coming down, but I'm waiting to see if it comes down more.\n\nAPTV - I think they are parts &amp; safety for EVs.\n\nDRIV - EV ETF.  Might be the best play for me so I can get a slice without all the tracking &amp; research of individual companies.\n\nEKAR - EV ETF.  Gotta compare the ETFs.\n\nKARS - EV ETF.  Gotta compare the ETFs.\n\nKNDI - \" Kandi Technologies Group, Inc. engages in the development, manufacture, and trade of vehicles. Its products include electric cars, tricycles, and tractors. \"\n\nNVDA - Chips.  Recent contracts.  Clearly I have some reading to do since that's all I can say.\n\nNXPI - Semiconductors\n\nTEL - \" TEL is the world's largest maker of passive electronic components (75% of sales) led by a leading share (20-25%) in connectors (50% of sales). TEL's biggest served markets have longer cycles, such as auto (30% of sales) &amp; telecom equipment (19% of sales). TEL also produces components for telecom &amp; energy networks (14% of sales) that protect/connect cabling.\"\n\nNKLA - nothing to say, just keeping an eye on it.\n\nForbidden topics because $5 rule...blah, blah, blah...  I know it's to prevent pump &amp; dumps, but these are companies I am legit interested in for investing.\n\n\"Single\" - That single seater is hideous, but they have other designs that look good.  Gotta check and see what they're up to right now.  Starting watching this at about $1.60 / share several weeks ago when they release some new shares that were costing the purchases something like $2 / share.  Considered buying then for swing trade, but had just failed on some other trades and wasn't ready to take the risk.  Now it's close to $5 / share.\n\n\"Werk Hors\" - Actually about $15 now, but I'm pretty sure I saw it banned on this sub since it crossed the threshold by a mod that called it trash.  Could've been a different sub.  In case you don't know this one - \"engages in designing and build performance battery-electric vehicles and aircraft. It develops cloud-based, real-time telematics performance monitoring systems. The firm operates in two divisions, Automotive and Aviation. The Automotive division operates as a original equipment manufacturer of class 3-6 commercial-grade, medium-duty truck chassis, marketed under the Workhorse brand. The Aviation division offers delivery drones and SureFly multicopter.\"\n\n\"Cee Bat\" - Lithium batteries.\n\n\"Cee Pee Ess Tech\" - Metal components - gotta do more research to see specifically what they do to contribute to EV market.\n\n\"Eff You Vee\" - engages in the design, development, manufacture and sale of electric vehicles. It also involves in building products that catalyze the shift to transportation system.\" - Got some more research to do!",
