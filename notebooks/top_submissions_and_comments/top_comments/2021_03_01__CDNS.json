        "body": "There are some significant hurdles to these guys' plans.  They want to build a constellation of 243 satellites, which can cost a pretty penny to launch.\n\nConsidering the large size of AST's proposed satellites, they are going to need big rockets to launch them, like SpaceX's Falcon 9 ($50 million per launch), or ULA's Vulcan Centaur ($100 million per launch), or the Russian Soyuz if they are willing to deal with ITAR red tape ($48 million per launch).\n\nAnd notably, NASA has raised some objections to their plans along with some other telcos who have spectrum rights which AST will need to ensure their satellites don't cause signal interference.  https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/11/texas-satellite-company-defends-itself-against-nasa-criticisms/\n\nThey are projecting cash-flow positive after the first 20 satellites are launched.  I would estimate that at 2024-2025 at the earliest, considering the launch cadence of the various rockets they can buy launches on.",

They're playing with slim margins here and need a very fast flight cadence to do well. Their profitability goals showed the need to hit weekly, sub-weekly, even daily launches.

TSMC is going to build a fab in Arizona (being pressured by the government). There are also some government money for supporting domestic semiconductor fabrication (DARPA ERI for example). And domestically fabricated chips are preferred in government contracts. I would say it is a consist policy that will continue no matter who is in the Whitehouse.\n* TSMC also receive supports from Taiwan government from lower utility cost and research funds. But I think more importantly the pay. Salaries at TSMC are very competitive in Taiwan so that it can easily attract talents with lower costs than its US competitors.\n* I believe some of them are irreplaceable players in the supply chain. If semiconductor sector does well, they does well. But I am not really familiar with them so I cannot give investment suggestion. You can add $CDNS and $SNPS to the list as well. They are also of similar roles.\n* Yes. Lidar and other sensors for autonomous driving. I believe $ON is mentioned the most for the recent months. I believe there are also some other companies but I am not quite sure. A lot of companies are doing CMOS image sensor. Another filed might hot is for VR/AR, like the suppliers for Oculus. But I cannot recall the names. There are a few startups doing optical neural networks. But I guess most of my peers wouldn't believe in any of them.",
