This is how we will end commanding the price, as long as we hold.

But that also gives US more time to accumulate real shares. So again, a few weeks later when they calls come up, they must again pay us, or short their short, that they'd already shorted. This would be reflected in the SI% going above 100%.\n\nIf the SI% has increased when posted on 3/9, they short is more than on, it's thriving, HOLD. If it's the same, HOLD. If it's &lt; 20% on every site, things get real questionable.\n\nSI% gets updated every 2 weeks. Those are the big landmarks. And each Friday, calls are executed, which is when shorts may start collecting shares, in order to payout. I believe they have until Tuesday to fully pay out all executed shares.\n\nAt the moment, we're doing great. And since it's not a key day, the shorters aren't buying yet, trying to buy themselves as much time as possible before they MUST collect. So a flat day is totally normal.

They're playing with slim margins here and need a very fast flight cadence to do well. Their profitability goals showed the need to hit weekly, sub-weekly, even daily launches. Everything in aerospace seems to take longer than anyone expects, and I think that a factory and launch infrastructure to support sub-weekly launches of disposable rockets will follow suit.",

TSMC is going to build a fab in Arizona (being pressured by the government). There are also some government money for supporting domestic semiconductor fabrication (DARPA ERI for example). And domestically fabricated chips are preferred in government contracts. I would say it is a consist policy that will continue no matter who is in the Whitehouse.\n* TSMC also receive supports from Taiwan government from lower utility cost and research funds. But I think more importantly the pay. Salaries at TSMC are very competitive in Taiwan so that it can easily attract talents with lower costs than its US competitors.\n* I believe some of them are irreplaceable players in the supply chain. If semiconductor sector does well, they does well. But I am not really familiar with them so I cannot give investment suggestion. You can add $CDNS and $SNPS to the list as well. They are also of similar roles.\n* Yes. Lidar and other sensors for autonomous driving. I believe $ON is mentioned the most for the recent months. I believe there are also some other companies but I am not quite sure. A lot of companies are doing CMOS image sensor. Another filed might hot is for VR/AR, like the suppliers for Oculus. But I cannot recall the names. There are a few startups doing optical neural networks. But I guess most of my peers wouldn't believe in any of them.",

        "body": "Last week saw some recovery for the hard hit tech and growth stocks as investors became slightly more comfortable with inflation forecasts, meaning US bond yields tapered off, which raised stock prices *(they essentially have an inverse relationship, as one rises, the other drops).* In addition, the $1.9 trillion stimulus bill was completed by the US govt.\n\nFor some, reduced stock prices provided a buying opportunity, or at least an opportunity to average down the cost of some of the positions.\n\nI don\u2019t expect us to be fully out of the woods yet in terms or recovery, with monday market opening likely to be red all over, as late on friday, bond yields jumped again following low demand for US govt bonds in auction *(when you take into account inflation, the yields on those bonds means you essentially have less money value than what you invested),* however, that should reduce by end of the week.\n\nStill bullish\n\nTaking a step back and Looking at the overall market, this correction was not just healthy, but overdue. While some assets are still overpriced, overall economy recovery provide a good backdrop for further mark growth, at least in the short-medium term. This current period provides an opportunity to *\u201cbuy the dip\u201c* on stocks which have a solid future, but also to reap the gain from some sectors that will see rapid growth over the next year. After all, rising inflation forecasts are due to the fact that most economists see the world economies recovering rapidly from the return of normality from COVID.\n\nWhat will be the recovering sectors?\n\nIn short, think of any the stocks that you have not been able to use or shop from over the last year.\n\n* Airlines &amp; Travel\n* Hospitality\n* Manufacturing\n* Consumer cyclical\n* Events\n* Retail\n\nBuzzing stocks this week\n\nI have created an algorithm that tracks chatter on social media to identify which stocks are trending, by measuring the shift in mentions this week compared to previous week. Meme stocks are purposely filtered out here.\n\nThe full results can be found here: [https://buzzingstocks.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/March+Stocks+2-01.png](https://buzzingstocks.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/March+Stocks+2-01.png)\n\nHere\u2019s my commentary on the most interesting ones in there:\n\n* **3D Systems, ticker: DDD**  \nSince the time of writing and creating this graph, this stock has shot up **%4.2** and up another **%1.5** in pre-market. Down from All-time high from earlier this year, DDD benefitted from analyst upgrades last week, as its price suffered a big tumble. Furthermore, ARK initiated DDD position in ARKQ (Autonomous Technology &amp; Robotics) ETF yesterday, putting it in the same basket as TSLA. Expect further gains short-term, and high volatility.\n* **Accsys Technologies, ticker: AXS**  \nThis is a very interesting one, especially long-term. A sustainable wood company that produces high technology, alloy-like wood, planting a tree for every one it chops down. Has recently completed the building of 2 large production factories. I might even cover this on a separate article. ***Note:*** *This company has a small market cap, meaning a low number of shares traded, which means it could take longer than you\u2019d like to buy/sell your shares.*\n* **Vermilion Energy Inc, ticker: VET**  \nSaw a price jump as analysts upgraded its price target last week. Energy companies are rising as demand is forecast to increase over the next few months. Not sure how this one will move in the near-future, one to watch.\n* **Teradyne, ticker: TER**  \nAnother one seeing lots of chatter on the back of ARK positioning. This one is a very exciting prospect to me, and ticks A LOT of boxes, most importantly, very solid finances. The company saw Earnings per share *(total earnings of the company, divided by number of shares, the higher the better)* growth of 64% last year.\n\nSummary\n\nExpect a less wild ride next week than the last few weeks, but still with some turbulence. Reduced prices have created a number of opportunities, which are being picked up by the algorithm.\n\nWhile there is likely still some downside in the market, longer-term I see a rosier picture, especially as economies recover and return to normality. I see now as an opportunity to purchase some opportunities at strategic prices, as well as a time to rotate into some of the recovery stocks, taking some profits from the growth/tech sectors along the way.\n\nWhat are your plans for the week? Let me know in the replies\n\n***None of this is financial advice, please do your own research on any stocks highlighted above.***",

Now, I have a few options on how to buy it:\n\n\\- SIX Swiss Exchange (in CHF), would be the cheapest fees (and no FX), it trades at a volume of \\~180k USD \n\n\\- Amsterdam Euronext (in EUR), low fees (but a bit pricier), trades \\~6.5m USD/day\n\n\\- London LSE (in USD), this would be the priciest, trades \\~10m USD/day in volume\n\n\\- London in GBP, I don't see the upside of trading this\n\nThe differences in commissions at the amounts I invest will be \\~0.5% more expensive in LSE than in SIX, with Amsterdam somewhat halfway.\n\nIn what exchange would you recommend I invest? Should I prioritize minimizing fees (by investing in CHF), or higher volume exchanges? Is there any upside to trading it in USD as it's a US stock ETF? I assume underlying prices are just corrected by FX so there should be no hidden cost there? \n\nThank you",

MSFT might not be around when you retire in 20-30 years.  Just because MSFT has been doing well for the last 5 years doesn\u2019t mean it will do well the next 25.

Satoshi specifically addressed privacy concerns in a separate section of their white paper.\n\n&gt;The traditional banking model achieves a level of privacy by limiting access to information to the parties involved and the trusted third party. The necessity to announce all transactions publicly precludes this method, but **privacy can still be maintained by breaking the flow of information in another place: by keeping public keys anonymous.** **The public can see that someone is sending an amount to someone else, but without information linking the transaction to anyone.** This is similar to the level of information released by stock exchanges, where the time and size of individual trades, the \"tape\", is made public, but without telling who the parties were... \n\nThe fact that Satoshi remains anonymous supports the case, I think. It is meant to be transacted in public, but the identify of the parties transacting is meant to be anonymous.",

And as we munch down on those deep fried birds, consider this:\n\nIf you were Pfizer, why would you pay $100m per year for something when you could just buy the whole dang thing and only owe yourself $100m per year?\n\nPeople think GME was a squeeze but this has heavy short interest, an insider with tons of shares who could quickly use them in diamond hand fashion when big daddy Pfizer comes in to clear a debt off the books of 100m per year through a buyout attempt, and holds the keys to some effective covid services.  And hint hint, covid isn\u2019t going away, it\u2019s the new flu.\n\nAlternatively, let\u2019s say Pfizer buys them out, gives frosty a boatload of Pfizer shares (they pay dividends so he can retire and still earn millions) and pays a handsome sum to all of us retailers for our shares.  Frost has already said he won\u2019t sell unless he rescues those who bought during high offerings which means he would be looking at $18-20 per share price point.  \n\nEither scenario gets investors 300-400% gains.\n\nI do live in fantasy land so not financial advice.",

Without substantive proof of current Bitcoin holdings still held by old management, or that a loss was incurred from an unusual event and or negligent action by prior management due to lost access to private keys and or wallets, or Bitcoin was sold and previous sale was never disclosed to new management, Coin Citadel cannot continue to reference the aforementioned Bitcoin Treasury in its financials moving forward.\"\n\nSo it's either been a scam or someone pocketed 500+ bitcoin, or someone lost access to wallets.

The mid February crash happened because some firm falsely stated that they found a double transaction. It was later backtracked but the damage was done. \n\nThe values is linked to how hard it is to mine 1 coin at this point. You could mine a coin with an idle computer so at the time it was chump change, now it takes high powered hardware, a heavy electricity bill and a ton of cooling to get one so the price goes along with it + how it can only get harder to have one. \n\nYour coins are as secure as you make it.

        "body": " Notice on robinhood they don\u2019t allow you to send and receive crypto through them, they are a stock brokerage not a crypto exchange. if they don\u2019t give you your keys, (ie a personal crypto wallet) that\u2019s not your crypto because it\u2019s not physically your possession to do what you will with it. All you can do is buy and sell it meaning you are not buying crypto you are investing in it, It\u2019s an exchange of fiat for an \u201ciou crypto\u201d. For example say you bought 100 goldfish for $100 but the person you bought them from just gave you a piece of paper that says ok you own 100 goldfish. But you don\u2019t actually have possession of them to give them away to your sister or feed them to your pet turtle, etc. on paper they are yours but those gold fish aren\u2019t physically yours and the same goes for \u201cbuying\u201d crypto on robinhood.",

        "body": "A lot of people are investing in Bitcoin ETFs without realizing some issues such as the fact that you will not own actual Bitcoin. Also, you will not be insured if anything happens to the ETFs. That is a pretty big risk even though this ETF can be held in a TFSA while being subjected to big swings during the weekend. Here are a few points which may or may not be helpful to you from my perspective regarding buying this alternative asset class, cold storage, taxation, and the cheapest method of accumulating/procuring it in Canada:\n\n1. Personally, I only buy on the Newton app since they currently have the lowest purchasing fees out of all of the available exchanges in Canada. Newton's average spread varies from 0.50% to 0.60% which is 2-3 times cheaper than most of the other available exchanges that are available to us as Canadians. I also use the ShakePay app to earn free Bitcoin on a daily basis by physically shaking my phone once a day. Trust me, I know that sounds ridiculous, stupid, and suspicious, but ShakePay is a legitimate company based out of Montr\u00e9al which is regulated by both FINTRAC and AMF while it is also legally licensed as a Money Service Business. I never actually buy from ShakePay because of their high purchasing spreads (which is approximately 1.75%) and I simply use them for the free daily accumulation of Bitcoin. Anyone who uses ShakePay can attest to this and easily confirm their legitimacy.\n2. Since I actually want to own the underlying asset, I withdraw my Bitcoin from both of those exchanges and I put my assets into a cold storage wallet. In Canada, this is currently the cheapest method of accumulating Bitcoin and truly owning the assets by storing them \"offline\" in a cold storage wallet. However, in order to unlock the ShakingSats feature in ShakePay to earn free Bitcoin, you will need to be referred as per their current terms and conditions. I can assist you with that in addition to answering any general questions that you may have regarding buying, selling, converting, and taxation-related issues if you want to message me directly as I am always willing to help educate others in this space with whatever knowledge and/or experience that I have gained over the years.\n3. If you want tax free capital gains, you can buy QBTC or BTCC in your TFSA. For QBTC, it is certainly expensive in terms of its historical premiums (5%-20%) and MER (1.95%); however, if you are long/bullish in Bitcoin as an alternative asset class, then perhaps it does not really matter. With that said, you do not truly own Bitcoin with QBTC or BTCC because they are a fund; and therefore, you own shares of the fund and not Bitcoin itself. As the saying goes and as you may have heard if you have done your due diligence: \"not your keys, not your Bitcoin\". As such, you run and operate with all of the associated risks of leaving your coins on an exchange which is why I choose to own the real thing and use a cold storage wallet. These products are not insured and same goes with the newly released ETF called BTCC. Big risk, but tax free in a TFSA.\n4. You may have heard of a Canadian company named Quadriga. In short, many investors did not truly own their Bitcoin with them since Quadriga sold \"entitlements to receive crypto assets or fiat currency from Quadriga\" while Quadriga held the \"keys\" to the real Bitcoin and investors lost around 135 million dollars CAD, but up to 250 million dollars CAD according to Wikipedia. This is verifiable information, a famous story, and a perfect example of \"not your keys, not your Bitcoin\" as well as a lack of insurance of clients.\n5. Unfortunately, with BTCC, QBTC and WealthSimple Crypto, you cannot take your Bitcoin off of their exchanges because, again, you do not truly own Bitcoin with them. Rather, you own shares of the fund whereas those organizations truly own the asset since they have the \"keys\". They are the ones who own the real asset (Bitcoin) and simply run the fund with the Bitcoin backing that fund as they make money through their ridiculously overpriced premiums and spread/fees (WealthSimple's spread is around 1.5-2.0% if not higher and BTCC's MER is about 1%).\n6. In regards to taxes, if you truly own the asset (Bitcoin), it is subject to capital appreciation tax whenever you trigger a taxable event such as selling it, buying things with it, and/or converting crypto-to-crypto. As such, you need to be prudent in your bookkeeping behavior and calculate your \"adjusted cost base\" for each transaction. There is no legal requirement forcing you to calculate your \"adjusted cost base\" for each transaction, but it just saves you a lot of headaches later on when you need to pay taxes. This is no different than investing in traditional equities in a taxable account after you have maxed out your TFSA, RRSP, RESP, etc.\n7. Before you invest in anything regardless of the asset class, make sure you understand what you are putting your money towards, understand your risk tolerance, understand the proper asset allocation percentages for your risk tolerance, and formulate a clear plan of what you want to achieve. For me, the biggest investment is not really the Bitcoin itself, but rather, it is in the underlying technology and innovation of the blockchain infrastructure which serves as a massive global public ledger leading to the decentralization of this digital currency as well as its invincibility and independence from overbearing governing bodies whereby the Bitcoin unit itself simply has a monetary value relative to fiat currency. Disclaimer: I am super long Bitcoin.\n\nNow, here are some general points of interests to help you understand cold storage wallets:\n\n1. There is a big misconception that if you decide to operate as your own bank (i.e.truly own your Bitcoin) and use a cold storage wallet device (i.e. physical hardware connected via USB to your PC), that your assets (Bitcoin) will be transferred and stored onto that physical USB device. This is the part that confuses a lot of people. In short, Bitcoin is not stored on that device, it will never be stored there, and this is because Bitcoin can never leave its \"blockchain\".\n2. So, what does your cold storage device do? The device allows you to have a \"key\" to your asset (Bitcoin) on the blockchain. How is this \"key\" established? Without going too deep into the technical aspects, when you initially setup the hardware wallet device, you will be given a 24-word \"seed phrase\" and it is literally 24 words. From a computer science perspective, this 24-word \"seed phrase\" actually represents and is transcribed into a huge series/string of alphanumeric characters. This 24-word \"seed phrase\" is essentially your \"keys\" to your assets on the blockchain.\n3. Your 24-word \"seed phrase\" is what is most important if you decide to act as your own bank and truly own Bitcoin since this is what gives you access to it. It does not matter if you lose your physical device and it does not matter if your physical device was destroyed. Why? Again, your assets are on the blockchain and not on the physical device. So, if you lose your physical device, you can simply replace it with another one (and this can be one from a different manufacturer too), set it up with your original 24-word \"seed phrase\" and you will once again have access to your assets since they are on the blockchain. In essence, never lose your \"keys\" because then you will have truly lost your Bitcoin.\n4. As you can probably see now, your 24-word \"seed phrase\" is extremely important (and more important than the physical hardware device itself). Therefore, when you first take note of your 24-word \"seed phrase\" during the initial setup of your physical hardware device, make sure that no one is watching, there are no cameras around you (including your mobile phone), etc. Only you should know your \"keys\". Never type it out on any digital device, never e-mail it to yourself, never take a photo of it, never upload it to a cloud database such as Google Docs and never try to encrypt it and put it on a regular USB drive. You want this 24-word seed phrase as private as possible. So, if anyone/anything asks you for your \"keys\", never give it out. Period.\n\nI sincerely hope that this has been helpful to you and good luck!",

You want this 24-word seed phrase as private as possible. So, if anyone/anything asks you for your \"keys\", never give it out. Period.\n\n5. What is a blockchain? It is a transparent, public, and append-only ledger. Basically, you can add data to this transparent, open, and public ledger, but you can never edit/delete previously established data within it. This is executed by a mechanism of consensus creation between geographically scattered parties (i.e. computers) that do not need to trust each other. The parties only need to trust the consensus mechanism itself. Blockchain infrastructure relies on some form of challenge such that no single party on the network can consistently and systematically solve this challenge more than everyone else on the network. This randomizes the consensus mechanism of confirming transactions and ensures that no single party can force the blockchain ledger to accept a particular entry onto the ledger that others disagree with. This is a peer-to-peer network that can maintain updates to the ledger and verify those updates in such a way that it is impossible to defraud and impossible to alter an entry after it has been confirmed via consensus.\n\nI sincerely hope that this has been helpful to you and good luck!",

I never actually buy from ShakePay because of their high purchasing spreads (which is approximately 1.75%) and I simply use them for the free daily accumulation of Bitcoin. Anyone who uses ShakePay can attest to this and easily confirm their legitimacy. \n\n2. Since I actually want to own the underlying asset, I withdraw my Bitcoin from both of those exchanges and I put my assets into a cold storage wallet. In Canada, this is currently the cheapest method of accumulating Bitcoin and truly owning the assets by storing them \"offline\" in a cold storage wallet. However, in order to unlock the ShakingSats feature in ShakePay to earn free Bitcoin, you will need to be referred as per their current terms and conditions. I can assist you with that in addition to answering any general questions that you may have regarding buying, selling, converting, and taxation-related issues if you want to message me directly as I am always willing to help educate others in this space with whatever knowledge and/or experience that I have gained over the years.\n\n3. If you want tax free capital gains, you can buy QBTC or BTCC in your TFSA. For QBTC, it is certainly expensive in terms of its historical premiums (5%-20%) and MER (1.95%); however, if you are long/bullish in Bitcoin as an alternative asset class, then perhaps it does not really matter. With that said, you do not truly own Bitcoin with QBTC or BTCC because they are a fund; and therefore, you own shares of the fund and not Bitcoin itself. As the saying goes and as you may have heard if you have done your due diligence: \"not your keys, not your Bitcoin\". As such, you run and operate with all of the associated risks of leaving your coins on an exchange which is why I choose to own the real thing and use a cold storage wallet. These products are not insured and same goes with the newly released ETF called BTCC. Big risk, but tax free in a TFSA.\n\n4. You may have heard of a Canadian company named Quadriga. In short, many investors did not truly own their Bitcoin with them since Quadriga sold \"entitlements to receive crypto assets or fiat currency from Quadriga\" while Quadriga held the \"keys\" to the real Bitcoin and investors lost around 135 million dollars CAD, but up to 250 million dollars CAD according to Wikipedia. This is verifiable information, a famous story, and a perfect example of \"not your keys, not your Bitcoin\" as well as a lack of insurance of clients.\n\n5. Unfortunately, with BTCC, QBTC and WealthSimple Crypto, you cannot take your Bitcoin off of their exchanges because, again, you do not truly own Bitcoin with them. Rather, you own shares of the fund whereas those organizations truly own the asset since they have the \"keys\". They are the ones who own the real asset (Bitcoin) and simply run the fund with the Bitcoin backing that fund as they make money through their ridiculously overpriced premiums and spread/fees (WealthSimple's spread is around 1.5-2.0% if not higher and BTCC's MER is about 1%).\n\n6. In regards to taxes, if you truly own the asset (Bitcoin), it is subject to capital appreciation tax whenever you trigger a taxable event such as selling it, buying things with it, and/or converting crypto-to-crypto. As such, you need to be prudent in your bookkeeping behavior and calculate your \"adjusted cost base\" for each transaction. There is no legal requirement forcing you to calculate your \"adjusted cost base\" for each transaction, but it just saves you a lot of headaches later on when you need to pay taxes. This is no different than investing in traditional equities in a taxable account after you have maxed out your TFSA, RRSP, RESP, etc.\n\n7. Before you invest in anything regardless of the asset class, make sure you understand what you are putting your money towards, understand your risk tolerance, understand the proper asset allocation percentages for your risk tolerance, and formulate a clear plan of what you want to achieve. For me, the biggest investment is not really the Bitcoin itself, but rather, it is in the underlying technology and innovation of the blockchain infrastructure which serves as a massive global public ledger leading to the decentralization of this digital currency as well as its invincibility and independence from overbearing governing bodies whereby the Bitcoin unit itself simply has a monetary value relative to fiat currency. Disclaimer: I am super long Bitcoin.\n\nNow, here are some general points of interests to help you understand cold storage wallets:\n\n1. There is a big misconception that if you decide to operate as your own bank (i.e.truly own your Bitcoin) and use a cold storage wallet device (i.e. physical hardware connected via USB to your PC), that your assets (Bitcoin) will be transferred and stored onto that physical USB device. This is the part that confuses a lot of people. In short, Bitcoin is not stored on that device, it will never be stored there, and this is because Bitcoin can never leave its \"blockchain\".\n\n2. So, what does your cold storage device do? The device allows you to have a \"key\" to your asset (Bitcoin) on the blockchain. How is this \"key\" established? Without going too deep into the technical aspects, when you initially setup the hardware wallet device, you will be given a 24-word \"seed phrase\" and it is literally 24 words. From a computer science perspective, this 24-word \"seed phrase\" actually represents and is transcribed into a huge series/string of alphanumeric characters. This 24-word \"seed phrase\" is essentially your \"keys\" to your assets on the blockchain.\n\n3. Your 24-word \"seed phrase\" is what is most important if you decide to act as your own bank and truly own Bitcoin since this is what gives you access to it. It does not matter if you lose your physical device and it does not matter if your physical device was destroyed. Why? Again, your assets are on the blockchain and not on the physical device. So, if you lose your physical device, you can simply replace it with another one (and this can be one from a different manufacturer too), set it up with your original 24-word \"seed phrase\" and you will once again have access to your assets since they are on the blockchain. In essence, never lose your \"keys\" because then you will have truly lost your Bitcoin. \n\n4. As you can probably see now, your 24-word \"seed phrase\" is extremely important (and more important than the physical hardware device itself). Therefore, when you first take note of your 24-word \"seed phrase\" during the initial setup of your physical hardware device, make sure that no one is watching, there are no cameras around you (including your mobile phone), etc. Only you should know your \"keys\". Never type it out on any digital device, never e-mail it to yourself, never take a photo of it, never upload it to a cloud database such as Google Docs and never try to encrypt it and put it on a regular USB drive. You want this 24-word seed phrase as private as possible. So, if anyone/anything asks you for your \"keys\", never give it out. Period.\n\n5. What is a blockchain? It is a transparent, public, and append-only ledger. Basically, you can add data to this transparent, open, and public ledger, but you can never edit/delete previously established data within it. This is executed by a mechanism of consensus creation between geographically scattered parties (i.e. computers) that do not need to trust each other. The parties only need to trust the consensus mechanism itself. Blockchain infrastructure relies on some form of challenge such that no single party on the network can consistently and systematically solve this challenge more than everyone else on the network. This randomizes the consensus mechanism of confirming transactions and ensures that no single party can force the blockchain ledger to accept a particular entry onto the ledger that others disagree with. This is a peer-to-peer network that can maintain updates to the ledger and verify those updates in such a way that it is impossible to defraud and impossible to alter an entry after it has been confirmed via consensus.\n\nI sincerely hope that this has been helpful to you and good luck!",

I've typed this out a few times so I'm going to give you the cliff's notes.\n\n-PlayStation 5 has a digital-only variant with a $100 lower price tag to incentivize its purchase. \n\n-This $100 discount is made up easily because the only place people with that console can buy games is the PlayStation Store. \n\n-Sony no longer allows digital keys to be sold for its games on third party storefronts. \n\n-Microsoft is making moves in this space with a similar goal in mind, but a different route: XBOX Gamepass. \n\n-The long term strategy here is to cut out middlemen like retailers entirely so that Sony and Microsoft no longer has to give them a cut of game software sales.\n\n-They won't complete this transition in the PS5/XSX generation, but it will almost certainly occur in the generation right after, even if it means they'll lose *some* physical media sales in the process. \n\n**When this finishes, Gamestop will have lost the most integral and lucrative component of its retail segment, permanently.** It doesn't matter how well they pivot, here. This is just the way the industry is moving. Sony and Microsoft want their ecosystems to be as profitable as possible. Cutting out retail reclaims a lot of built-in costs with continually decreasing downsides. At that point, Gamestop will be a retro game software, thinkgeek, funkopop, and current era *console* retailer. Fair value under $5/sh. Market is forward-looking and realizes this even if apes don't. The short stuff is the only thing propping the price up, because the company has no future.",
