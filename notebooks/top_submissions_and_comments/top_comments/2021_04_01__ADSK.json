Skim a few hundred thousand on software licenses for a firm and expect a few million insurance premiums if your cheap software resulted in a defect that Autodesk would have caught.\n* Reopening play for infrastructure. As described by OP.\n* University trainging in the software. Companies know what they get from software and also their new hires.\n* Low overhead, high margin business.\n* Good acquisitions and growth into adjacent business.\n* The move to subscription worked well for Autodesk.\n* USA domestic company so no software backdoors for hostile countries to harm infrastructure. \n* Ecosystem to add to the moat. eg: Shipbuilders can make a shipbuilding module for Autodesk instead of making new shipmaking software from scratch, to a guaranteed audience.\n* Not a monopoly. There are alternatives that exist enough to keep antitrust woes at bay. \n\n**Headwinds:**\n\n* Shareholder value gets eroded by their employee option granting over the years.

And as Andrew Walker discusses, even the firm's that sent an angry letter to AutoDesk about the direction they were heading didn't actually switch software. It's too difficult to learn a new platform and migrate all of your data. That's what investors call a moat. Currently the most popular \"cheap\" alternative is Fusion360... also owned by AutoDesk. As a SolidWorks user myself, Fusion360 is a flipped over port-a-potty of a user interface. I guess eventually someone will come along but industry trend momentum is a hard thing to change quickly.\n\nStill, I don't plan on buying in on ADSK... ever, really.",

But the price is too much for the majority of small architects doing residential and small business sects. In fact most of the work done is for Revit models. But that being said the overall experience is mediocre and for a price at 2k+ it's simply not worth it for the lack of any sort of meaningful updates aside from small convenience factors. If they lowered the price, or even did dual business set ups on a permanent license and upgrade later like microsoft it'd be much easier to stomach. But they only run off subscription and do very little in terms of software updates. Thus in my eyes without a shift in the way they handle their product, they won't be able to get anywhere near the levels of a company like Microsoft. Would I short it? No. There will always be a demand considering it has an education license and is the one most people teach, but in the long term I expect a small decline in value but not by much. If they make that product turnaround, I'd expect it to rocket the fuck out.",

Engineering/construction companies are some of the slowest to adapt to new tech, and many times consulting firms and construction companies are trying to reduce cost and the number of licenses they need in each software*\n\nThis lines up with my experience. Sure, Autodesk software is ubiquitous, but that just leads me to believe that it really *can't* grow that much bigger than it currently is. There's not many new sectors for them to break into. \n\nIn the longer-term I feel like it's more likely for a competitor to sink fangs into ADSK's ass than for ADSK to moon. \n\nSoftware licensing fees are brutal and companies are trying to get away from being bent over the barrel. I know at some of the larger firms they're *very* slow to acquire new licenses. At smaller firms like mine we try and do anything else - we developed our own solution method rather than license ADAPT-FELT, for example. \n\nThe US having a big infrastructure spend would be good for US-based construction companies, and decent for engineering companies, but I don't think it's more than a blip for a software company. It won't be a *bad* thing but looking at the price history of ADSK I don't think I'd like to buy in.",

I use it because it's cheap and it can still (barely) get the job done. There's so many things about Fusion that just don't make sense. They say that it's a cad program but the support for .dwg files is still terrible and is lacking the ability to edit 2D stuff easily. The .dwg file format is an Autodesk creation so you'd think that they should have that figured out. It's stuff like that throughout the whole program. Want to make some 2D drawings? Yeah sure. Want to print them? Na you have to export that as a PDF and print it in some other program. They've fixed that a while ago but with the most basic print dialogue box I've ever seen.\n\nMy other options are buy a license for solidworks for around $4000, look at tekla which is like $10k+\nI don't think solidworks is all that much better and I should be an engineer if I'm running Tekla.\n\nI'll probably just end up installing a bunch of plugins into Blender and hacking together a workflow to deliver PDFs and DXFs.",

Photoshop is bloated and there are many competitors...easy to replace. They don\u2019t have what I\u2019d consider a top 10 sketch program, illustrator, Premiere, etc. can all easily be replaced. Even InDesign has direct competitors of repute.\n\nI think people keep moving forward with Adobe because they are part of their workflows, which is powerful and has value, but 1:1 there\u2019s no reason to choose an Adobe program for any specific job.\n\nAutodesk on the other hand is more entrenched in their fields. You straight need AutoCAD to run a lot of tooling equipment, and there is no real competitor to Revit. Revit is also a contractually required deliverable for a lot of municipal and federal work.\n\nAutodesk will be harder to unseat IMO. But regardless, when that day comes for either company I\u2019ll tip back a beer and savor the moment. Absolute leeches those two companies.",

As of 4/5/2021, I see qqq ETF is most likely reach 330 in a week and make all time new high in a month. However, it cannot go straight up without pullback. Sometimes those pullback could be very deep. The worst thing could happen is that qqq falls to the very bottom when you truly need to cash out from it.  Find something less volatile and delivering constant divvy.  You may even build your own high yield fund by investing several stocks such as KO, RIO, and AVGO.",
