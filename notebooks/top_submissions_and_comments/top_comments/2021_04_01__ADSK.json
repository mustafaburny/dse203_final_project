Skim a few hundred thousand on software licenses for a firm and expect a few million insurance premiums if your cheap software resulted in a defect that Autodesk would have caught.\n* Reopening play for infrastructure. As described by OP.\n* University trainging in the software. Companies know what they get from software and also their new hires.\n* Low overhead, high margin business.\n* Good acquisitions and growth into adjacent business.\n* The move to subscription worked well for Autodesk.\n* USA domestic company so no software backdoors for hostile countries to harm infrastructure. \n* Ecosystem to add to the moat. eg: Shipbuilders can make a shipbuilding module for Autodesk instead of making new shipmaking software from scratch, to a guaranteed audience.\n* Not a monopoly. There are alternatives that exist enough to keep antitrust woes at bay. \n\n**Headwinds:**\n\n* Shareholder value gets eroded by their employee option granting over the years.

I use it because it's cheap and it can still (barely) get the job done. There's so many things about Fusion that just don't make sense. They say that it's a cad program but the support for .dwg files is still terrible and is lacking the ability to edit 2D stuff easily. The .dwg file format is an Autodesk creation so you'd think that they should have that figured out. It's stuff like that throughout the whole program. Want to make some 2D drawings? Yeah sure. Want to print them? Na you have to export that as a PDF and print it in some other program. They've fixed that a while ago but with the most basic print dialogue box I've ever seen.\n\nMy other options are buy a license for solidworks for around $4000, look at tekla which is like $10k+\nI don't think solidworks is all that much better and I should be an engineer if I'm running Tekla.\n\nI'll probably just end up installing a bunch of plugins into Blender and hacking together a workflow to deliver PDFs and DXFs.",

Photoshop is bloated and there are many competitors...easy to replace. They don\u2019t have what I\u2019d consider a top 10 sketch program, illustrator, Premiere, etc. can all easily be replaced. Even InDesign has direct competitors of repute.\n\nI think people keep moving forward with Adobe because they are part of their workflows, which is powerful and has value, but 1:1 there\u2019s no reason to choose an Adobe program for any specific job.\n\nAutodesk on the other hand is more entrenched in their fields. You straight need AutoCAD to run a lot of tooling equipment, and there is no real competitor to Revit. Revit is also a contractually required deliverable for a lot of municipal and federal work.\n\nAutodesk will be harder to unseat IMO.

I\u2019m a mechanical designer, autodesk rarely comes out with enhanced features, just completely new products which make it seem like a deal when you get so many products for a cheap subscription. I use 3D modeling software from multiple companies including autodesk and I will always go for Solidworks, you can buy a license and have it forever. \n\nI think that In The future my industry will lean away from subscription based software as soon as a finance manager realizes that you\u2019re only using 30% of the functionality on your $250/mo license, and a $4000 one time license would have been cheaper. The only caveat to this is where an engineering firm is so large that they have a hotline to talk to any autodesk software engineer.",

When building bridges, ships, skyscrapers, consumer products, the cost of a miss due to a software bug is tremendous. Skim a few hundred thousand on software licenses for a firm and expect a few million insurance premiums if your cheap software resulted in a defect that Autodesk would have caught.\n* Reopening play for infrastructure. As described by OP.\n* University trainging in the software. Companies know what they get from software and also their new hires.\n* Low overhead, high margin business.\n* Good acquisitions and growth into adjacent business.\n* The move to subscription worked well for Autodesk.\n* USA domestic company so no software backdoors for hostile countries to harm infrastructure. \n* Ecosystem to add to the moat. eg: Shipbuilders can make a shipbuilding module for Autodesk instead of making new shipmaking software from scratch, to a guaranteed audience.\n* Not a monopoly. There are alternatives that exist enough to keep antitrust woes at bay. \n\n**Headwinds:**\n\n* Shareholder value gets eroded by their employee option granting over the years. That's life in tech companies. \n* PE ratio reflects a lot of years growth already baked into shareprice.

Sure, Autodesk software is ubiquitous, but that just leads me to believe that it really *can't* grow that much bigger than it currently is. There's not many new sectors for them to break into. \n\nIn the longer-term I feel like it's more likely for a competitor to sink fangs into ADSK's ass than for ADSK to moon. \n\nSoftware licensing fees are brutal and companies are trying to get away from being bent over the barrel.

The .dwg file format is an Autodesk creation so you'd think that they should have that figured out. It's stuff like that throughout the whole program. Want to make some 2D drawings? Yeah sure. Want to print them? Na you have to export that as a PDF and print it in some other program.
