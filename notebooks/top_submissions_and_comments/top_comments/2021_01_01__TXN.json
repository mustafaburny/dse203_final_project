And don\u2019t just limit your search to major processor suppliers.\n\nWould also look into companies that supply all of the peripheral chips for auto and consumer electronics (think TXN, ADI). Your average BOM includes 1 main processor, and many, many peripheral chips.. Peripheral chips are typically cheaper, less competitive, built on more stable processing nodes, and have high margins.\n\nOne other company of interest related to semiconductors is TER. Wide moat tester supplier for just about every one of these chip makers. The need for comprehensive test solutions is growing (arguably) faster than the semiconductor market itself, especially as INTC and AAPL are reaching their 5-7nm process nodes. \n\n- An engineer in the semiconductor industry",

        "body": "That's probably one of the best bear cases I've seen against INTC, I'll keep your points in mind.\n\nFab costs- I don't see how INTC survives without a fab.  If they do go fabless like AMD, I'd expect them to go down pretty quick.  It's the reason why they're able to get such high margins, it's what their entire design process is built around, and it's likely what's allowing them to maintain market share while AMD and NVidia face supply shortages.  However, you do raise a good point about ongoing costs.\n\nFab Under-utilitization.  Seems like they've gotten a ton of product out of 14 nm, to the point that it's become a running joke.  I heard your point about them not selling space to other companies, but this seems to be partially because nobody wants that space.  TSMC is the fab everybody goes to because they're not producing their own products, Intel has no such claims.\n\nToxic Culture - I've also heard the rumors, but having worked for a number of big companies there always seems to be the same old rumors.  MSFT, Oracle, etc have all had the same things said about them, and they continue to be successful.  Steve Jobs is like the prototypical toxic boss, waking people up at 3 am when they're sleeping under their desks to tell them their shit sucks.  Truth is that in a large enough company there's always going to be disgruntled employees, toxic bosses, and drama.\n\nI missed their CES, but I'll give you this point and the server loss.  I've heard enough about mix ups, and apparent bad communication between marketing and engineering.\n\nI'll also agree with you that this idea of the \"Great Man\" fixing things seems to be pretty dumb.  I don't think CEOs have anywhere near the impact people thing they do, any more than I think Jim Keller was going to do something amazing for them, or Bob Swan was the origin of all their problems.  Just not possible to have a large impact in an organization of 100K employees.\n\nAny particular reason for the 25-50% prediction?  Seems like it's already priced in with people arguing that NVidia and AMD are fair value.  If INTC traded at those same valuations, they would be a $255 per share company.  Even just trading at 25x P/E like, say Texas Instruments would double their price.",

They have reached highs of 130p in December.\n\nThe main risk they face is time. Share price has went down since they've pushed back their timeframe for being cash-positive(?).

We were not ruined by the various financial crashes through the last couple of decades, but I know it changed their life plans.    \n     \nMy dad had a pretty good job at Texas Instruments and got stock over the years. After the dot com crash, he started to be sent down a dead-end street of transfers to subsidiary companies. Eventually he lost the job he loved.    \nMy mom has always, nearly every single day for almost 20 years, always worked night shift at Parkland hospital. 7p - 7a. I know it wasn't because she liked it, though she did make friends. I always knew it was because the night shift made more than the day shift. She did this for many, many years before she (I'm so glad she did) retired March of last year, just before the pandemic set off.    \nNow, in the middle of all of this I have a brother with special needs. So between them going full steam on their jobs, they restlessly fight the state and county to get my brother support. It's very taxing, trying to talk with government officials.    \n    \nI will never forget when my mom said, \"We thought TI would get us through retirement, but it doesn't look like that's even a possibility now.\" I thought, \"this is it. We've lost it all.\"     \nBut my parents kept going. My mom kept working nights; my dad tried to get another job, but ended up spending a lot of his time taking care of us and learned how to cook very well, and he's now very well known in the Special Olympics circle and that's kind of become his life, his new passion, helping special needs kids.    \n    \nSo my family is okay now, but only because they worked very hard to keep themselves on track. For almost 20 years I only saw my mom a couple of hours every day, if even. I would maybe catch her when she got home, then she'd go to bed when I went to work, then we'd get together for dinner, and she would go back to the hospital.    \n    \nIt makes me tear up... but I'm holding this stock, and I know it won't get me back all the time with my mom, but hopefully it will let us have more fun times in the future to forget about how hard she's worked her whole life.",
