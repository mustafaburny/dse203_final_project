        "body": "If you don't understand the risks, you don't understand the company. I'm not getting  spoon fed my opinions from online articles, I'm a software developer intimately familiar with Intels problems over the last few years.\n\nWe can ignore that they've fallen so far behind in process, and assume new CEO PatG is going to fix that by throwing tens of billions in new capex at it. So higher PP&amp;E costs but hey, they have the cash flow to support it. \n\nAnd we can ignore that TSMC and others are investing even higher amounts in maintaining their process lead, including in US based (Arizona) manufacturing.\n\nLastly lets ignore that AMD has been eating market share over the last decade and is positioned to maintain or grow x86 market share in the future.\n\nBut it's hard to ignore that Intel is losing probably their best PC customer, Apple. Apple never bought from AMD, always Intel, and always Intels higher end CPUs where it makes it's best margins. Last year Apple was likely close to 10% of Intels PC CPU business (not counting chromebooks which buy super cheap shitty CPUs).\n\nThis is only starting to show up in Intels financials. Apple moved their lowest end Macbooks and Mini to Apple Silicon in December of last year, just moved low end iMacs this summer, and now is moving all high end MacBooks to Apple Silicon right now. High end iMacs and Mac Pros get their Apple Silicon by mid next year and it's over, Intel permanently loses over 20M higher end CPU sales a year.\n\nBut worse is that Apple's M1x is not only faster than the fastest of Intel's new Alder Lake CPUs, its offering that performance at  roughly 1/3 the power draw and less than half the cost. Each of those new high end MacBook Pros would have had $500 Alder Lake CPUs (actually they would have been delayed till 2022 till Intel had volume) but TSMC is building Apple's M1x Pro and Max for $150-$250.\n\nYou might say, who cares? Apple was only 8% of PC market by units, even though those were all high end. Microsoft cares. Dell cares. Lenova cares. Now they have to go toe to toe with Apple MBPs that aren't just as fast or faster at the same price points, they are offering double the battery life, and run super cool.\n\nMicrosoft already sells the Surface X using an ARM processor. Their ARM processor sucks, but Apple Silicon has just given them the blueprint for fixing that. They are working on their \"Microsoft Silicon\" higher performance PC ARM processor as I write this. As is Samsung, Qualcomm, etc, etc. They can't sit buy and bleed sales to Apple because Intel's CPUs are too hot, too expensive and use too much power.\n\nSo these things are going to take a while, and unless Intel figures out how to take the cruft out of x86 to make it run far cooler and with lower power at the same performance levels, the ARM trend will continue to pick up speed and market share. Catch x86 up in process size is only one aspect of the ARM lead, on equal process sizes x86 is still at a big disadvantage in power consumption, maybe 2 to 1 instead of 3 to 1, but still big.\n\nBut the even bigger near term threat is to Intels' dominance in servers. Amazon's ARM based server architecture has huge advantages. It doesn't offer anywhere near the same level of single CPU performance, but that matters little to the vast majority of server customers. Instead it offers far more performance per dollar and because it uses so much less power it generates far less heat, meaning more can be packed into server rooms. This has led to some of the highest growth rates the industry has seen in decades, and it's already at 10% in one measure of cloud computering.\n\n[https://www.techpowerup.com/275971/aws-arm-based-graviton-processors-sees-the-biggest-growth-in-instance-share](https://www.techpowerup.com/275971/aws-arm-based-graviton-processors-sees-the-biggest-growth-in-instance-share)\n\nIt's a real risk that ARM based server architectures could have over 50% of cloud server installs in 5 years. That would gut Intel's biggest CPU market.\n\nSo no catch phrases, just some very real, and some very likely risks.",

Intel is the only one to watch going forward with their Arc project, but they\u2019re heavily invested in cloud gaming which is a risky bet, and their performance on past GPU architectures has been lackluster at best.

Those other companies just make things that bridge gaps.\n\nThe major players in computer/data security are MSFT for LAN, your favorite Linux company for servers, network companies like Cisco for communication, and whichever company you house data with. Could be makers of SAN/NAS, or internet/cloud based (Amazon, Google, MSFT, or other hosts), or DB companies like Oracle. You may also have some hardware specific help but you would need to go to the source for securing those. So if you run a lot of intel radios, then you need to work with them to secure things.

        "body": "I am actually slowly transitioning into ETFs...beginning of the year, everything I had was on stocks (and KR\\*Y\\*P\\*TO). Now I have transitioned about 150k into ETFs. I plan to up the ETF allocation to at least 300K by next year. Ideally, within a year or two, I will have a maximum of 10 individual stocks, a handful of themed ETFs and more than 50% of my investment in generic vanguard ETFs, where I do not have to check my portfolio on a daily basis. However, in the mean time, I don't want to sell with 30-40% loss on the ones that I have. I am not in a hurry, so I can hold for a while ( a year or two). Just wanted to know your views if you think some of them are a lost cause (by lost cause, I mean, I will not be able to break even within 2-3 years).\n\n*Since some have wondered about my holdings, I have accounts at 3 brokers. This one where I hold the stocks mentioned above, I have had it for about 1.5 years. I was doing awesome until Feb (was up like 60K from around 200k invested, within 7months, but who was not doing great in late 2020 and early 2021?), then I got really hammered for a few months (was down to -50K at some point), and now have gone up again (was back up to 40K after months of DCAing, but my main holdings BIDU, TDOC, BABA, etc have been hit hard lately and now just around 20K up with 300k invested, so about 7% up only, and not including all the headache and time wasted...). So not so good, I would have done so much better with one of the well known and safe indexes/ETFs...* \n\n*One other account is doing great, but it is mainly due to K\\*R\\*Y\\*P\\*T\\*O certificates. I started buying these certificates (1 to 1 mapped to B\\*T\\*C and E\\*T\\*H), and they have been doing pretty well this year.  Apart from these certificates,  50% of my holdings there are mostly solid companies like amazon, google, amd, qualcomm. So this one in general has been amazing (YTD 42% up, I started this account in july 2015, first times I started investing, and I am up 156%, about 140K gained so far, despite rookie mistakes I've made such as selling a majority of my amzn, googl, msft at the start of the pandemic)*\n\n*The other account is rather small, current value around 30K, but have done quite well here as well, about 30% up this year, and 40% since I opened it about a year and a half ago.*\n\n*I also have K\\*R\\*Y\\*P\\*T\\*O that I have been holding for a while, and I am not planning to sell any time soon... so probably, this is enough risk by itself (in addition to the certificates I hold related to that)*",

Similarly they fell behind in process technology.\n\nThose issues, among others, are being addressed since they re-hired Gelsinger.\n\nHe understands the business from an engineering standpoint, which I believe was seriously lacking under Bob Swan (a bean counter).\n\nGelsinger also comes from a software perspective, having been with VMWARE, and he's expressed his admiration for the software/hardware integration of the Apple model. They've been developing closer ties with customers (Qualcomm for instance) that I believe will tighten their designs with software developers in a similarly cooperative fashion.\n\nSince AMD went fabless, there is now only 1 US fab owner and that is Intel. They will likely get assistance from the government with the massive capex needed to maintain cutting edge tech production, and I believe that government involvement will not hinder them in any way.\n\n[https://www.fabricatedknowledge.com/p/intels-foundry-ambitions-and-updating](https://www.fabricatedknowledge.com/p/intels-foundry-ambitions-and-updating)\n\nfor a perspective on AMD's spinco, Global Foundries,\n\n[https://www.fabricatedknowledge.com/p/global-foundries-s-1-breakdown](https://www.fabricatedknowledge.com/p/global-foundries-s-1-breakdown)\n\nIncidentally, I seriously hope Intel does NOT buy GF.

There are others but I think these are the big fabs and foundries.  I believe $QCOM, $AVGO, $SKWS, $TXN make their own and get some from fans but I am not certain on them.  Other plays to consider are the equipment mfg who make the equipment, parts, and services the fabs are buying in order to make more chips.  Some big players here are $AMAT, $ASML, &amp; $LRCX.",
