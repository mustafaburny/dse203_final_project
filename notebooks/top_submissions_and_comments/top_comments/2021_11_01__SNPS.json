        "body": "I am mostly a conservative investor so for the moment i'm only invested in INTC and texas instruments. If i had to open any other positions i would mostly go to the foundry businesses like TSMC or Samsung. \n\nI feel intel, samsung and tsmc are the more sure bets and have been the only ones able to participate in Moore's law the past few years making the leading edge really a oligoply.\n\nIntel since it is traing really cheap at a sub 10 PE with the companies management expecting the revenue to increase by 10% per year and margins only decreasing only 2-3%. With dividend and buybacks combined they return aboud 7% per year if their revenue of profits wouldn't increase which they almost certainly will.\n\nSamsung makes most of it's money from it's foundy business and retail electronics. If it's foundry business' orders decrease they can fill up the remaining space with their own needs. (same as intel)\n\nTsmc is the real leader in the industry with customers having reserved all capacity for years ahead.\n\nFor price targets i would recomend [this DFCF tool](https://tracktak.com/dashboard). You fill in what revenue growth you expect the comming years, how much the ROIC is and what margins you expect.\n\nNVDA and AMD seem like really good companies but they are priced for perfection.",
