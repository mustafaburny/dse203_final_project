Apple and Nvidia seems to be slowing down now waiting for competitors to catch up but they were going ham on generational improvements. We will soon see what Nvidia has up their sleeve with Ampere as AMD starts catching up on the GPU front as well. AMD single handily put a fire in both the CPU and GPU industries previously dominated by Intel and Nvidia, and now they are starting to haul ass. I wouldn\u2019t count out Intel yet because yesterday\u2019s announcement was the first competitive move that Intel has done in a long time. Yes it lowers their margins, but this move to drastically lower price and enable previously locked features like hyper-thread on their lower end chips will definitely help to take back some of the market share from AMD. We will see what comes with 7NM.",

In other words, AMD offers remarkable bang for your buck. I'm saying this as a long time intel/nvidia fan boy that has jumped ship to AMD; I am by no means trashing their products. These days, if you're buying an Intel for your build, its because you have a stupidly large budget and you're willing to throw money at it.\n\n\n With all that said, AMD's recent strides are only relevant for client computing; which in fairness is the largest market sector. Intel is still king of the datacenter sector which is the fastest growing sector in the market. \n\n\nI think for short term, AMD is smarter but I would put my money on Intel for long term holds.",

And if that's the case shorting it now may lead nowhere.\n\nWe're not talking about NVDA with a P/E of 60+ or AMD with a P/E of 100+. Those are priced for perfection. We're talking about a company that had a great lead for a long time and is now selling at 11 times earnings. Sure, the earnings may drop, but will the price drop accordingly? Or will it just adjust to a slightly higher P/E? Look at JNJ, for instance, it has a P/E of 23 right now.\n\nI think we all agree that Intel is not going to disappear (as a company). Their prices will have to come down given their current position with respect to competitors, but they will adjust and survive. And if the price drops some 20 or 30% (which would give you a decent gain if you're shorting it) it just starts making sense to buy it for the dividend and the low P/E for a decent blue chip.\n\nSo, I'm by no means telling you you shouldn't short it. Go ahead, I'll be happy to be proven wrong. I just think it's not as clear cut a case for shorting than say ZM.",
