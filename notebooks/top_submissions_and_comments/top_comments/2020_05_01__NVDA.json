They took a beating and am expecting a bounce back from the 132-133 level. I'll be going short term calls tomorrow for a quick scalp at open.\n\nPTON Calls: Same as above \\^ bounce back from the $40-41 level\n\nDKNG: FOMO if you want. This thing could pop to $40 or drop to $30. I won't be touching this until at least another week or so. Risky af but mad tendiez if you guess the right direction (calls/puts)\n\nCOTY: Same as above, but I expect this will hold better than DKNG since its already near rock bottom prices. Might throw a few thousand at it tomorrow in calls.\n\nSPY: i personally don't play SPY, but there is mad tendiez to be made if you get in calls at a dip (around the 295-297 range) or puts (around the 301-303 range).\n\nCCL, RCL, NCLH: Easy plays to go long on a dip, Beaten up cruise stocks that have been forming new bottoms. Easy 2x 3x bagger if you get in before a large move up in the premarket. They seem a bit overheated lately though so I would be careful of a pullback soon, in which case go short term puts.\n\nAAL, DAL, UAL, LUV, SAVE: Same as above\n\nAAPL, MSFT, AMD, NVDA: Tech saw a big hit today, might be a good spot to buy the dip. I'll be watching closely tomorrow if we continue to fall in tech at open, then I'm buying the dip for sure.\n\nBABA, TSM: GYNA stocks if you want i guess\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGood luck making your parents money back you fucking autist.",

You\u2019re buying weekly spy calls with 50/60% of your capital buy monthly VIX calls as well as a hedge in case there is a sudden mid day crash that rolls over to next day your hedge will keep you solvent or make bank depending on how it plays out and VIX options are generally very cheaper compared to SPY options\n\n- this one should be a no brainer but don\u2019t be stubborn and hold a bad play for too long, if you made a 2k investment on SPY contracts and it dips beyond 30%, either open a small hedge position or close your positions and take a one day break to reset. 1.4k capital is better than a full 2k loss.\n\nThat\u2019s all folks, thanks for coming to my Ted talk and good luck tomorrow.

Then I looked at BA AAPL NVDA- 3 diff stocks - airplane manufacturer/aerospace stock/tech/semiconductor  all 3 held key support levels so if these 3 hold and SPX held key levels. It implies the market may not go lower(yet) So once you come to the conclusion that the market may not break lower.. You assess and look at which stocks are out performing today..

In fact, I would say that NVDA and AMD are far more analogous to each other than even AMD -&gt; AAPL, and certainly to MSFT. The  way that I see it, NVDA/AMD are fundamentally companies that are concerned with producing a *physical good* \\- literal chipsets and dies. AAPL seems to waver on the hardware side of things (they have been known to go proprietary in that arena, but have also loaned out work to INTC on more than one occasion). I most certainly see MSFT as a true software/PaaS/SaaS company - suffice to say that they are producing very little in the way of physical goods.\n\nI think the *soft/hardware* direction is important to mention, because that fundamentally plays into the way that these companies deal in the market. Developing hardware is a mind-bendingly expensive process (relatively speaking). It takes years of R&amp;D and cash on hand to fund something that is truly great. An example of this would be the move AMD made to Zen (which is based on the concept of 'chiplets'; highly-scalable many-core designs that are fundamentally different from their monolithic predecessors).\n\nIn terms of growth, I would have to say that I see two viable options here: *NVDA and MSFT*. MSFT is pretty easy to explain; they create a product that fundamentally has lower upstart costs (software development's most expensive attribute is the cost of human labor) and lower maintenance costs (I would think). There is some movement towards a more data-center driven profit scheme (which would require boots on ground hardware en masse), and Azure is certainly an AWS competitor, but I think we've yet to see them really go full throttle on that (I think it could be big if they did).\n\nNVDA is a leader from a technological perspective. GPU compute-cores are very specialized devices that are good at doing only a few things, but very, *very well.* NVDA has been hammering away at this technology for years - they know the game, and they know where the money is. Autonomous cars, drones...the computer viz recogition software for postal, for literally anything, runs on a platform that is fundamentally a GPU (very high level view here). Machine learning applications in this field at the data-center level (think machine learning on AWS) are absolutely dominated by NVDA; In fact I would go as far as to say there aren't really a lot of competitors out there that are bringing to the table what NVDA does (Honestly AMD has severely gimped even their consumer dies at this point).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can elaborate more, but I'd go with MSFT and NVDA on this one.",

I'm not saying AMD is a bad investment, I like AMD as a company quite a bit, but I would hope you understand how to project earnings, relate that to share price, and evaluate that in the context of their current P/E. \n\nYou're about to put a lot of money on something I don't think you've quite thought through.\n\n&gt;comparable companies to amd like Nvidia have a stock prices in the hundreds\n\nCompletely irrelevant. If I told you I'd sell you 1/10 of my company for $1, or 1/20 for $0.50, what's the difference?",
