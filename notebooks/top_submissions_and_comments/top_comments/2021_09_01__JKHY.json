As soon as that growth slows, the price takes a hit.  That's why you see so many high flying popular stocks selling off big on earnings these days.  With a P/S of 25, NVDA is up there - not crazy high, but up there.  That doesn't mean it is due for a selloff any time soon, but it does mean your upside from these levels is somewhat limited.",

Nothing mentioned in the $NVDA about a shortage, just excessive demand and not being able to keep up with production.  \n\nAdditionally, many companies have dug themselves into a hole and aren\u2019t owning up to their mistake (automakers).  They cut production at the beginning of COVID and we are literally paying for their mistake by not being patient.  It\u2019s also a fault of inventory management system like \u201cJust In Time Inventory management (JTM) where it assumes the supply chain won\u2019t have major interruptions in the supply chain.

        "body": "I agree with everything you just said. Margin is pretty easy to use in a market like this. But TSLA has a higher cash requirement. And I don\u2019t think TSLA can ever repeat 2020. Too many catalysts that won\u2019t be repeated.. like the short squeeze and the SP inclusion. On the margin.. I use it a lot.. but I\u2019ve been long on GOOGL and NVDA since May.. and up a lot. So the margin pays for itself and more. I think market will tank 4th week of Sept.. then shaky Oct. Back up for Nov-Jan. We\u2019re for sure gonna hit some corrections. Idk I still think Tech is gonna keep running up and looks like SPY too. That\u2019s only gonna help TSLA. We\u2019ll see what happens..",

It\u2019s 100% tech. AAPL is actually the perfect example of what I\u2019m talking about. You can see it in NVDA, TSLA and MSFT as well. Take a look!",

I picked them because they are a solid company with a good plan forward, but had no idea they were going to perform that well. Also picked Apple and Microsoft which are both solid, though not performing as well as nVidia for now. \n\nAs you said XIT is great for exposure to tech stock. I may choose it for one of my accounts. In TEC in my TFSA for tech exposure for now.",
