        "body": "The fact that more people are investing in the market thus price of the equity of company X goes up - doesn't make it a fairly valued company. In the stock market, unlike business, fair value is not what others are willing to pay for it, but rather what the underlying business is worth. If you did your DD on company X and figured that its intrinsic value of the stock is say $10, because its currently at $20 doesn't mean you need to jump in because everyone's are fine with buying at $20. It just means you put that company on your watchlist and move on, looking for something either close to IV or trading at discount. That's what in my opinion a sound investing is overall. At some point investors were buying N-KLA at $70 - but its fair value was nowhere close to that. Just shows that imo markets are inefficient and you can make a decent chunk of $ throughout your investment experience if you exploit those inefficiencies",

They made the account change without any notice, and after being down like 80% on my puts, bad news hit GM and I was only down like 30% and couldn't close the position because my options level was no longer sufficient. By the next day the stock had recovered and I missed my window to close thanks to my broker fucking me when I needed to sell, which seems to be disturbingly common.\n\nI remember calling them and telling them I wanted a broker, not a babysitter. The dude sounded completely annoyed like he was my dad and doing me a favor. He wasn't wrong in hindsight. I was like a chimp with a machine gun back then. I'm better now. But damn...let the monkey shoot his load if he wants.\n\nFidelity isn't a bad broker. But they're like strict parents. They're not quick to trust or forgiving if you throw a party and their risk department flags you as a retard. TD is like your friend's cool parents who don't really give a fuck. And Robinhood is the skeevy guy outside the liquor store selling fake IDs. That guy will hook you up with whatever you want. He's cool, but not really a friend.

If you are buying TSLA now you are up for a hard reckoning.\n\n\"At a time like this, when our stock is reaching new highs, it may seem as though spending carefully is not as important. This is definitely not true.\n\nWhen looking at our actual profitability, it is very low at around 1% for the past year. Investors are giving us a lot of credit for future profits, but if, at any point, they conclude that\u2019s not going to happen, our stock will immediately get crushed like a souffl\u00e9 under a sledgehammer!\n\nMuch more important, in order to make our cars affordable, we have to get smarter about how we spend money. This a tough Game of Pennies \u2013 requiring thousands of good ideas to improve part cost, a factory process or simply the design, while increasing quality and capabilities. A great idea would be on that saves $5, but the vast majority are 50 cents here or 20 cents there.\n\nIn order to make the electric revolution happen we much make electric cars, stationary batteries and solar affordable to all.\n\nThanks and great working with you as always,\nElon\"",

        "body": "&gt; why someone would want to use Bitcoin as opposed to cash on PayPal?\n\nYou're asking the wrong question. The right question is why can't we have one uniform impartial payment system for all international transactions. Instead we have a moronically slow and expensive but reliable wire system. On top of it we have fast and reliable credit card system that makes spending easy but you can't easily receive transactions as a private user. And we have the PayPal, that has mandatory consumer protections that encourage chargeback fraud making it unsuitable for any large scale business. \n\nAnd for some reason in every civilized country local wire transfers are nearly free and work well for any usecase. Why can't we have it globally?",

        "body": "&gt; Second, the majority of exchanges these days aren\u2019t sketchy. They are regulated \n\nFor real?  I understood Bitcoin is still unregulated.  Are you absolutely sure about that?\n\n&gt; Is PayPal sketchy?\n\n\nWell, from my experiencing using it to sell things, hell yes, PayPal is sketchy.  They have their own rules and screw the customer at every turn.  But of course you and I mean sketchy in comparison to these mtgox type scams I've heard about and in comparison, so yes PayPal is not going to vanish in the night.\n\n&gt; Is the CashApp sketchy? Is Square sketchy?\n\nAren't those the same?  Is Bitcoin on cash app for individuals or just Square merchants?\n\n&gt; Third, crypto wallets are difficult to use with no experience but I guarantee if you make one transaction using one it\u2019s easy from there; what task isn\u2019t tough at first?It\u2019s like when a middle school aged child starts doing algebra. At first it seems daunting but after a few lessons things get easier and you wonder why it ever seemed so difficult in the first place.\n\nI'll take your word for it.  I've jusg seen hundreds of messages where people post that they lost their bitcoins due to wallet issues, and then edgelords mock them for not doing these series of non-intuitive hold and cold and medium wallet transfers and for not making copies of copies of their keys, etc. \n\n&gt; The mining of the Bitcoin does take some electricity but it\u2019s the mining that makes the network decentralized. \n\nI'm not talking about the mining which of course is massively wasteful on electricity.  I mean the computation energy needed to verify a transaction.  Isn't that expensive on electricity and takes a long time to clear?\n\n&gt; The decentralization is key. Without it that's just another currency controlled by a central figure\n\nWell, I'm not as averse to hard currency.  I'll take any pesky centralized currency you are sick of holding :-)\n\n\n&gt; As long as the average person buys and holds Bitcoin long term the elite won\u2019t ever be able to get it all. \n\nBut would that just guarantee it's death?  What good is a currency that doesn't circulate, which nobody is willing to use for buying and selling things?  It would be like illiquid real estate.\n\n\n&gt; Remember, there will only ever be 21 million bitcoin.\n\nI've heard that. But I've also heard there's only 10% left to be unlocked?\n\n\n&gt; And don\u2019t forget, crypto can make buying things online more anonymous because your name doesn\u2019t or personal info doesn\u2019t need to be attached to crypto. \n\nTo me that would be a drawback.  I don't buy anything illegal, and I'd rather my neighbors pay their share of taxes, so I don't it to be easy for them to do tax fraud.  And can't any Sec Treasury declare a ban at any time on the hidden transactions? \n\n\n&gt; As you can see I believe in Bitcoin and what it can do for society. \n\nSo what do see as the benefit to society?  You've said it would bypass central bank, which may or may not benefit society.  And the other feature was making tax dodging and money laundering easy for criminals, which is basically the opposite of good for society.  \n\nI'm still wondering about the heavy cost and delays of transactions.  \n\nBut to me, something that would meet your goal of an alternative to central money would be if say Google started Google dollars and let people of any station in life transact instantly, safely, for free.  \n\nThey'd instantly chop the legs out of elitist banks and Visa/MasterCard/PayPal, and democratize transactions for everyone.  I'd think that's something you'd appreciate?  \n\nSo all the societal benefit but without the societal drawbacks of Bitcoin.\n\n&gt; Get in now before the FOMO starts.\n\nWell frankly I did a long time ago, before bitcoin crashed hard.  But I did it through proxies like Square and Overstock and Nvidia.  But not sure if there's a current proxy I like.",
