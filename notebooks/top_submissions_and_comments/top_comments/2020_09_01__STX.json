I got in on AMD at $55 cause they\u2019re making the chips for PS5 and Xbox X.\n\nI\u2019ll trade some Roku stock here and there because they range from 140s to 170s.\n\nMaybe I buy a little of recovery stocks that are hit really hard now or on downward days but that should recover like Coty which is at $3 and they\u2019re a big makeup company that should do better when woman aren\u2019t all wearing masks outside.\n\nAGS makes gaming machines for casinos, they\u2019re at $4, if they hit $3.8 or less that\u2019s a buying opportunity cause they usually go back up to $4.4 and if they survive to post Covid they might be $10+ stock again.\n\nI\u2019m not an expert so please do your research and always diversify.",

        "body": "The price of a stock alone says nothing about it being cheap or expensive. You need to also consider the number of shares outstanding. That's why instead of looking at the stock quote you should look at ratios like P/E.\n\nSo, what you're asking is what are some value stocks with relatively low P/Es compared to the S&amp;P average for example. There are several sectors that are \"cheap\" - these are your banks like JPM and BAC, manufacturers like MMM and HON, even some tech like INTC, CSCO, and STX.\n\nNote that low P/E are often indicative of low growth expectations. So you are trading stability (low beta) and dividends for capital appreciation.",

Even Western Digital has them on the tech front.\n\nIt doesn't even feel like they've capitalized on WD's recent issues as much as they could have. So yea, unless the price drops a ton, I'll keep what I have in the company for its dividend. But I'm not expecting it to go to the moon anytime soon.",

Currently I think AMD (and Nvidia) are massively inflated even if they are the leaders currently and I also have stakes in them as well.\n\nMy logic may be skewed, but you know schools are giving every student a laptop..   Each one of these laptops have intel integrated graphics, which means I'm sure Intel will do fine over the next year.  Same philosophy with logitech, western digital, and seagate..   millions more computers being distributed, means that top companies that produce hard drives, Ram, CPUs, GPUs, and computer accessories are making some good profits. Not to mention gaming during a pandemic is at an all time high.",

I am arguing that just the sheer expansion of cloud storage needs will take care of that. If I'm right and the market has overlooked this, then we could be looking at increased future cash flows =&gt; dividend increases.",
