        "body": "Just fyi MU's products, DRAM, NAND are commodity products. Commodity anything are cyclical as they ramp up production when the expectation is that the economy will grow. This then leads to overproduction and ultimately low prices due to supply and demand. Take a look at the MU chart the past decade (or even longer) to get an idea of this. Granted, the memory industry is now an oligopoly, and some would argue we are in a multi-year up-cycle due to technological advances, so the cycles may be much more contained. \n\nI would advise looking more into the companies you listed. The fact that you list these stocks together kind of hints to me that you don't really understand them other than that they are in the semiconductor industry. I see many posts suggesting a stock because of how great their quarter and guidance are, but please remember the market is forward looking; chances are that great guidance is already priced in. \n\nIn regards to your MU, TSM comment, just realize that there's probably a reason they are lower valued. My two cents for why they aren't trading at multiples like the others are: MU - commodity products as I mentioned in the first paragraph. As such, you can't expect them to trade at a growth premium like AMD since they don't control their price. DRAM by Micron is not better than DRAM by Samsung. People pick which to buy based on price. TSM - may be accounting for the political risk of China invading Taiwan. TSM is also an independent, pure-play foundry. Their entire capacity is already being utilized so you could say their growth is capped and already priced in. For them to grow more, they would have to increase capex and build more foundries. This takes months/years to complete.\n\nTL;DR: Not saying MU, TSM can't rise more, but not for the argument you mentioned.\n\nGood luck!",

Its PE is hovering just above 12 (!) as a tech company, 2.5% starting dividend yield, and its getting US govt backing as part of national and supply chain security from the semi shortage.  Plus, INTC is planning to diversify into being more of a company-independent fab company (arguably similar to TSMC, just behind currently on manufacturing advances like 7nm and below).  If tariffs on China start going back up, it will have a more highly-protected competitive moat.  And, think about the possible huge revenue gains in future, with pent-up demand from semi shortages.  Looks pretty attractive, imo!  (PS: As a consumer, I am an AMD fanboy from circa 2006-2007 onward, if that tells you anything).  :)",

You can jump ship once they get back in the lead. For now, it doesn't make sense to me to buy Intel when AMD is gaining ok them massively.\n\nI think with a good discount, Intel might be worth it, considering they are also trying to get into the gpu segment.",
