Increasingly\u2026 what we may see as a chip is actually a \u2018package\u2019 of multiple pieces of silicon that were individually manufactured separately and attached them together.  \n\nInfrastructure will involve chips.  Our bridges, EV chargers, Solar Panels, and especially cars will all require more and more chips which only further pushes the need for leading edge chips at the heart of data centers or \u201cat the edge\u201d (fully autonomous driving for example).  \n\nThe companies I mention all have market leading positions in steps along the production process for leading edge chips especially ASML who has a literal monopoly.  ASML\u2019s earnings showcased how active the CapEx spend was amongst their clients including in the memory side. \n\nThey will build the upcoming Fabs in which AMD and NVDA can finally get the scale needed to become as big as we all know they should be.",

The issue which has made Intel un-competitive is they're mismanaged their development of their 10nm architecture. This out them far behind the competition for reference AMD is on 7nm reportedly going to 5nm next generation , Nvidia is on 8nm, apple whom has recently entered the chip manufacturing game is on 5nm, and Nvidia has just announced a hybrid x86 gpu + ARM CPU APU combo that is supposed to bring gaming to thinner notebooks.

Its PE is hovering just above 12 (!) as a tech company, 2.5% starting dividend yield, and its getting US govt backing as part of national and supply chain security from the semi shortage.  Plus, INTC is planning to diversify into being more of a company-independent fab company (arguably similar to TSMC, just behind currently on manufacturing advances like 7nm and below).  If tariffs on China start going back up, it will have a more highly-protected competitive moat.  And, think about the possible huge revenue gains in future, with pent-up demand from semi shortages.  Looks pretty attractive, imo!  (PS: As a consumer, I am an AMD fanboy from circa 2006-2007 onward, if that tells you anything).  :)",

If rookie Apple can beat them, Intel should be shuddering at what Nvidia and AMD can do.\n\nAnother factor for me was their dumb choice of an accountant as CEO when it was obvious to all that their biggest problems were all related to a vacuum of technology and engineering leadership.
