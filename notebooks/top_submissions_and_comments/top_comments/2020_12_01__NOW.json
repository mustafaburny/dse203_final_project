The concept of a Black Swan which is simply an event that is unlikely or hard to quantify that can still occur that has an immeasurable but extremely large downward or negative impact.

We saw it mid-September and it took until Nov. to fully recover in many cases. \n\nHow do you quantify the risk of being in positions you cannot get out of when the bubble pops? How do you quantify the lost opportunity of buying SPACs at a discount in the middle of one of those attacks?\n\nMost of my biggest gains in November are the result of having cash on the sidelines that I put to use during the September attack. I just booked a 103% gain on my SPAC holdings due mostly to paying less \"opportunity cost\" in Sept. than a \"zero risk\" parking money in near-NAV strategy would have paid. I could follow a \"park til pop\" strategy for the next 12 months and come no where near my November gains even AFTER excluding the \"average\" SPAC gains. All due to rejecting the \"zero risk\" thesis.\n\nBut of course the bottom line is to follow a strategy that you understand, are comfortable with, and that seems to work for you based on your risk profile.",

I use Revolut app for this, so I am a bit limited to what I can trade, but it seems enough for now.\n\nCurrently, I have:  \nAAL 20,5 shares  \nAAPL 1,72 shares  \nCCL 3 shares  \nNFLX 0,41 shares  \nPLTR 7,58 shares  \nPFE 2,98 shares  \nTSLA 0,94 shares  \nVTRS 6,91 shares  \nXPEV 3,49 shares.\n\nPlayed a little with NIO and SFIX, MSFT, but since I am new to this and impatient, sold at (in my mind) good profit and bought other stuff, now it feels weird to buy back, let's say NIO. Currently, I calculate 27,4% profit on my portfolio from the cash I invested, so I consider myself lucky for not screwing up these savings too much. Usually I stay in the green, except for Netflix, Pfizer and Viatris, so maybe I'll get rid of these when the time feels right. I plan on continuing investing cash every month and learning more, comments are really welcome :)",

It would be 5% of thier current valuation. And if the share price fell, no big deal. They would have enough cash to go hard at their new business lines without worrying about where to get it in the future.\n\nThe counter argument would be that the dollar is losing its value so why do so much now. But it is also my opinion that many experts who believe in this reflation trade and the death of the dollar are wrong. So my assumptions drive my options.",

However if you think that in the future you might start with bigger numbers, which would give you (let's say - 10 dollars for every hour spend researching) then the experience you get now will be pure gold. People also say that starting early is extremaly important when it comes to compound interests, which will go high over the years!",

There were some failed platforms (BitLending I think) but the only time crypto is lent out an interest payed is where it's the borrowed funds in a speculative bet by another party, in the case of Bitcoin always on a centralized exchange. \n\nNo rational individual borrows in crypto because it's like exposing themselves to the most insane currency risk ever. Literally 3 days ago you could buy a Bitcoin for 16,800 USD, now it's nearly 20,000. If you had traded that Bitcoin for services rendered for fiat, you'd have to find 20,000 to replace the borrowed Bitcoin, excluding any interest charges. \n\nThere is a reason that 10 years after Bitcoins inception, its market is still made of up almost entirely of speculation, those in the market for illegal goods and services and the outright insane that believe the world will end but somehow the internet and their Bitcoin / crypto will remain unaffected.",
