Not saying rich people don't do illegal things, but it just doesn't seem worth his time to make up fake deals in order to create fake PR for a small company to siphon investor's thousands of dollars. He's an American citizen who is chairman of an American company and if he wanted to just make money, he could chill out and invest his billion dollars -- which would be a lot easier than creating a lot of fake news in hopes to gain a bit more capital through some shell company. It just doesn't add up for me or seem worth his time. I'd imagine companies doing shady things want to stay on the downlow, and Ideanomics is doing the opposite of that",

And the government can and will seize them, whenever it needs more money to spend. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_6102\n\nAs to the FUD toward Bitcoin :\n\n1. All tech starts complicated, then the iPhone comes along and fixes it, see Libra and the abject fear from government officials just the suggestion created. The first email providers were clunky as hell, you had to set up these two different servers, one to send, and one to receive, it was the dumbest thing ever, it could never catch on that way, but it was clearly better than snail mail, and once a decent web client abstracted away the hard part, then it took over, and the rest is history.\n\n2. Bitcoin is easy to steal with malware, at least from a software wallet, but Hardware Wallets make this almost impossible, and once you get one, its no longer an issue, unless someone tricks you into sending your Bitcoin to them, but people have been tricked into sending Western Union wires to thieves as long as sending money has been a thing, so its not much more steal-able, with precautions.\n\n3. Proper backups make this very unlikely, but not impossible. Anything can be lost, if its physical. Most people just have money in the bank, and its not going to get lost very easily there, so some care is required to avoid this problem.\n\n4. 3000 + new digital currencies have already been created, and some people have purchased them, but then again, some people bought Venezuelan Bolivars as well, but then they learned not to buy candy wrapper money, and then they stopped. A new digital currency doesn't make Bitcoin worthless, its just another thing people might buy, and then they will learn not to. I could offer you a hunk of Pyrite, but only a fool would buy that instead of gold...\n\n5. Yes, requires these things, but modern smart phones have all three of these things, and most people have one, so its less of a barrier as it appears.\n\n6. This is always possible, but since Bitcoin is a distributed ledger, any successful hack could be rolled back (old copy of who owns what is used), or the coin forked to an unbreakable variant (hard fork upgrade), so its not as catastrophic as it appears.",

Seems likely, and it will be bad PR when it happens. Or, if it hangs in the balance long ehough, they might get their revenue right enough to finish renovations and start an impressive Fintech Hub, however I'm not holding my breath for that.\n\nWu was the one to push for Fintech Village, that seems to be what his sights are set on, while Alf seems much more interested in expansion into green energy services.",
