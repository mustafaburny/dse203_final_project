        "body": "One big factor for me is the range of 5G.  I read different things, and it is hard to get a precise number for how far one 5G transceiver can go.  If it only goes 0.15 km, then you would need 600-800 of them to replace 1 typical 4G cell tower.  Some reports say they go 500 feet, others, more than a mile.\n\nWe do know that 5G does not go through some construction materials as well as 4G, so you can't just plop one on a city square and cover a huge area.  Corning is a stock I watch and I know they are working on special glass that doesn't hinder 5G, so they are hoping to be in on any investments.  The 5G transceivers are small enough to fit on stop-lights, street lights, etc., but they would still need power and maintenance, so if you need hundreds of them, that will get expensive.\n\nThe other factor is quality.  The bandwidth is much better sure, but who is going to need that?  Who is willing to pay extra for that?  I'm sure Comcast and Spectrum will love to tout how awesome it is and quote all sorts of fancy numbers, but I won't believe them anyways.  I have been home like everyone else and my many devices are streaming at great quality all the time and I'm just happy with what I have and wouldn't pay more.\n\nSo to me it is more hype than anything, though it should benefit customers in many cases, like old buildings that have crappy wiring/expensive to rewire everything, and huge venues (sports and concerts), but again, the last ones I have gone too, I didn't have any bandwidth issues or needs.",
