Gelsinger needs to (and I think he is)  identify all the negatives (or current issues they face, including internal bureaucracy) and quickly address the vision on how to rectify these issues. At this point who cares if the stock price is affected... he didn't own the disfunction.  Once he does that,  and realigns the vision and internal systems to achieve the goal,  he might have the most successful turn around story ever.   I'm betting on him. I'll give him 5 years.  If successful I'll be rewarded. If not,  another fine US company lost to the great American corporate bureaucracy.",

        "body": "While investing in Chinese companies listed on US exchanges you have to remember 3 additional types of risk you are taking on in addition to your normal investment risk.\n\nFirst is fraud risk. Chinese companies arent held to anywhere near the same standard as American companies. As Luckin Coffee showed, new IPOs and smaller Chinese companies can easily get creative with their accounting. While BABA, JD and other mega caps are less likely to suffer from this problem, generally the risks are much higher with Chinese companies than with their American or European equivalents.\n\nSecond, US political risk. The US government is finally waking up to the fact that China has been competing with us in order to supplant us for the last 20-25 years, and is beginning to take action. China's multinational corporations, especially those listed on US exchanges, are the some of the easiest places to apply pressure.\n\nThird, and probably most importantly, is political risk from the CCP. The Chinese government can be arbitrary, and political concerns supercede economic ones. They can and will crush certain businesses just to make a point. This is real.\n\nAll that being said, I think sentiment for Chinese stocks is about as low as it can be right now. Short of the CCP nationalizing their largest and most profitable companies, or the US banning chinese stocks from US exchanges or US brokers from dealing with them (both real possibilities, although not the most probably outcomes), I dont think Chinese companies, especially Chinese tech companies, have that much further to fall. Selling here is likely selling near the bottom.",

Unfortunately I think the main deciding factor there is how much the service will cost the company, rather than how good it is for the actual employees. It's basically bidding for a contract from what I understand. Lowest bidder wins.\n\nRobinhood might actually be able to steal some market share there though if they come up with an offer to not charge anything for actually managing the assets, and offer expanded employee choice, while making their money off of payment for order flow. I'm sure they could make some good money from a firm that wants to front run bi-weekly automatic purchases! (Is that legal? I have no idea.)\n\nFor my account growth, about $47k was additional deposits and $18k was market growth (mix of unrealized and realized gains, but only time I usually sell is to move money from one company into another if I see a better opportunity.)

        "body": "I understand your point. But putting a higher PT really helps everyone because to my point by now pretty much everyone and their mother own MSFT. Same with Apple, Amazon, etc. So I kinda disagree that it makes business sense because it doesn\u2019t help just institutions it really helps everyone given that MSFT is also probably on every other ETF and Index fund. \n\nI find it more troubling when it is a smaller stock that not everyone owns. I remember earlier this year I think it was Morgan Stanley, late in 2020 they release a sell rating for PLTR and then earlier this year they raised the PT for PLTR and later I saw that they started buying PLTR a month before the PT was released. So I think if it is a smaller stock that it is not \u201cwell known\u201d I definitely would call that helping and pushing their BS",
