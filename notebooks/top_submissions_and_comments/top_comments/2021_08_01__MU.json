If a bottom forms and its not a sharp recovery you should have a list of companies that have low price but good value(offer something people need) also help if it in something you know or use yourself.  Put a percentage in as a bottom forms and cost average from there on the recovery.\n   At this point inflation on any dip in excess of 6 months would have to be brought into consideration.  The gov for sure would try some sort of rescue, unfortunately.   I did miss WM and F@$1 in 08 although it was on my radar fear of loss was a too strong swaying where i put mu money.",
