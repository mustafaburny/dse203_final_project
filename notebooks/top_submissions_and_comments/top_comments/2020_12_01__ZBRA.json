You spent good money on this mattress, but it\u2019s still loud, and you don\u2019t want to wake her.\n\nShe mumbles to herself, and you fight back laughter. Since you began sharing a bed, you\u2019ve learned to live with a sleep talker, but it still amuses you every time.\n\nShe moans, \u201cNo, don\u2019t.\u201d You can see stripes of light across her face, as the full moon spills through the slats in the blinds. You decide to play along. \u201cDon\u2019t what?\u201d\n\n\u201cBuy that car.\u201d You sit up at that, allowing the bed to creak. She continues, \u201cIt\u2019s garbage.\u201d You choke out the words, \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n\nShe sleep chuckles, \u201cIt\u2019s made in China.\u201d\n\nYou stand, suddenly, but she still doesn\u2019t wake. The light through the blinds paints your naked form like a sad, overweight zebra. And now a mental light shines on your sad, overweight NIO bags.\n\n\u201cGo back to sleep,\u201d you say, and within moments you hear her gentle snore. But you won\u2019t sleep tonight. Or ever again.",

You have to be right about direction and size of move - just to break even.\n\nThe ZEBRA works in your favor when the stock moves against you.  It behaves like \\~100 delta when the stock moves in your direction, but the delta decreases when it moves against you (when you have sufficient DTE).  You have to put up more capital for a ZEBRA, but you don't lose if it stays flat.",
