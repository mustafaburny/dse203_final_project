In 2016, Chief Executive Officer Safra Catz served on the president\u2019s transition team, and two years later, dined with him at the White House, where she complained about a government contract she deemed unfair, Bloomberg reported. Vice President Mike Pence visited Oracle\u2019s headquarters in Redwood City, California. Catz has contributed more than $125,000 this year to support Trump\u2019s re-election, according to Federal Election Commission data. And Ellison let Trump use one of his California estates to hold a fund-raiser in February.\n\n&gt;In recent weeks, the U.S. president had publicly endorsed the Oracle bid and called Ellison a \u201ctremendous guy.\u201d Trump economic adviser Peter Navarro, who earlier came out against a potential sale to Microsoft and had at one time advocated banning TikTok completely, echoed that endorsement during an August appearance on Fox News.\n\nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-09-13/oracle-is-said-to-gain-advantage-in-deal-for-tiktok-in-u-s",

Apple and Tesla both dropped by a lot and VIX was even going up, but the market had a HUGE rally into the close. It seems pretty clear at this point that stonks truly only go up, so I bought more calls and pulled back my VXX hedges since they already printed.\n\nCan you believe MSFT is trading at only 231? That will be 250 easily when TikTok comes through. ORCL has no chance. \n\nYours in bullishness,\nSomanychins",

        "body": "## Daily Market and Options Summary for Today -\n\n## Daily Synopsis \n\n* The S&amp;P 500 increased 0.1% on this 19th anniversary of 9/11 but continued selling in the mega-caps limited the upside. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.5%, while the Nasdaq Composite (-0.6%) and Russell 2000 (-0.7%) closed lower. \n* Similar to the days before, today's price action was technically-oriented given the absence of market-moving news and the losses in stocks like Apple (AAPL 112.00, -1.49, -1.3%), Amazon (AMZN 3116.22, -58.89, -1.9%), and Microsoft (MSFT 204.03, -1.34, -0.7%) on no specific corporate news. Apple shares fell 7.4% this week. \n* The difference today was that their losses were offset by relative strength in the cyclical sectors, namely industrials (+1.4%), materials (+1.3%), and financials (+0.8%). Still, when Apple and Amazon are down more than 1.0%, there must be more winners than losers to make a meaningful difference. \n* There were more of the latter on Friday, as declining issues outpaced advancing issues at the NYSE and Nasdaq. The information technology (-0.8%), consumer discretionary (-0.3%), and communication services (-0.3%) sectors ended the day in negative territory due to their exposure to the mega-cap stocks. \n* Interestingly, the S&amp;P 500 was down as much as 0.9% intraday and fell below its 50-day moving average (3322). A broad rebound in the afternoon, however, helped the benchmark index turn positive and close above the key technical level. \n* Shares of Oracle (ORCL 57.00, -0.33, -0.6%), Peloton (PTON 84.04, -3.71, -4.2%), and Kroger (KR 34.37, -0.37, -1.1%) finished lower following their earnings reports. Note, ORCL shares were up as much as 7.9%, and PTON shares were up as much as 11.8%. \n* U.S. Treasuries finished on a higher note. The 2-yr yield declined one basis point to 0.13%, and the 10-yr yield declined two basis points to 0.67%. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.1% to 93.28.
