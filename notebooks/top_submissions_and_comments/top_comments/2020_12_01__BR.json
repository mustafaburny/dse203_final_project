Note that these are usually investing in US-companies. \n\nOutside the US I can't go into much detail (I'm from Germany, we have different ETFs because of regulatory issues), but looking on the internet I found the following ETFs that may be of interest to you: VWO, SCHE, IEMG. Note that VWO and SCHE do not have exposure to South Korea, which leads to overweighing CN, India and BR. Those three aren't growth-specific but Emerging Markets generally, although I'd argue that many of the biggest holdings there can be classified as growth (BABA, JD etc.). \n\netf.com and justETF.com are great resources to look up and compare ETFs aswell. Sorry I can't be of more assistance, I'm just not that familiar with US-based ETFs.",

E.g. if you loan out a security, and it pays a dividend while it is out on loan, the dividend will get paid to the short seller, but the short must contractually pay you that dividend. But now that quasi-dividend you receive is not going to be a \"qualified dividend\" for tax purposes. So Fidelity pays you a little extra in this case to make up for the tax hit.",

So we broke open the window and I was shit, do you guys know how to Hotwire this? No oh fuck the car called the cops on us, run. I got away but my bro turned me in because he\u2019s a \ud83c\udf08\ud83e\uddf8and they said he\u2019d be out in a week if they told him who was with him. Anyway, I was thinking about where it all went wrong, I mean I got money right, I was just doing it for thrills. Anyway, this was right before the Tesla spilt so I was holy fuck bro I got it, I\u2019ll take my 20k out of my fidelity account cause I have a real job, transfer it to Robin Hood and put it all on $2000c TSLA 1/21. After the split I\u2019ll own 4x the calls and it will \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80But the cops came knocking on my door. I was typing in the option and the strikes and soon as hit hit enter, the door burst open and the cops threw me to the floor. The little hourglasss popped up I was looking at my screen and then damn my bulls and bears, you\u2019ll never guess what happened. Robinhood went down and I have no idea if my calls went through. Cops dragged me out and I\u2019m serving 6 months for attempted grand theft auto and contempt of court after telling the judge he was a retrded \ud83d\udc3b. Anyway, I get out in 3 weeks I hope it went through, what\u2019s this about s&amp;P inclusion?",

Here are their margin rates: https://www1.interactivebrokers.com/en/index.php?f=46376\n\nEven then, the rates are still pretty high compared to the rates on Treasuries and so you\u2019d mostly be betting on a decrease in interest rates. \n\nIf you REALLY want to leverage Teasuries, you should use futures. Very low implied financing. This is by far the best way for a retail trader to leverage Treasuries. The only downsides is that nominal contract values are pretty large so it gets a little difficult if you have a small account and you also have to know how to deal with futures in general i.e. they are quarterly contracts and not a real bond.",

E.g. if you loan out a security, and it pays a dividend while it is out on loan, the dividend will get paid to the short seller, but the short must contractually pay you that dividend. But now that quasi-dividend you receive is not going to be a \"qualified dividend\" for tax purposes. So Fidelity pays you a little extra in this case to make up for the tax hit.",

Very low implied financing. This is by far the best way for a retail trader to leverage Treasuries. The only downsides is that nominal contract values are pretty large so it gets a little difficult if you have a small account and you also have to know how to deal with futures in general i.e. they are quarterly contracts and not a real bond.",

You need to file w the SEC and register (I don\u2019t know if \u2018group of 20-something trading fractional shares and derivatives\u2019 is a registered party, but fuck it who cares?). Then you have the right to solicit the rest of the investor base to vote in a slate of directors that will do your bidding. \n\nHere\u2019s the fun part: the filing alone costs about $100k in filing fees and legal fees. And now you\u2019re just getting started.....\n\nYou need to hire board reps, advisors, lawyers, marketers, etc etc. A normal proxy fight costs at least $1M and some have gone up as high as $20M to $30M.....oh yeah *and you can still lose it all too.*\n\nSo I\u2019d love to know where you all plan on coming up with the money to fight this and what your pitch to Fidelity, Blackrock, Vang, SIG and the rest of the top GME holders will be. \n\nThis whole thread is like when a child reaches up, touches the stove and gets burned.

They charge $6.95 to buy shares, and charge $6.95 to sell the same shares. This will eat your profits for breakfast. You're paying for the software they sink a *lot* of money into. Just learning this now.)\n\nFidelity: Actually buying/selling. They don't charge to buy stocks. You can buy/sell stocks/options that are NOT available on Robinhood. Example: CBDD. Two days ago it was at **0.0001**. Today, it topped out at **0.029** If you got in at a low price and dropped $500 and sold at .029, you would have made like $800^^?^math profit.\n\nFidelity and RH for me.",

I figured that without fixing this aspect of the system these random mutations would have serious effects in humans. We see this happen in cell culture and some times in mice too... I was a hater, and now I'm outside looking in. \n\nThat said, I think BEAM and EDIT have a lot of room to grow. BEAM's tech results in less off target mutations, so I like them a lot more.

Bought more at 0.66, which I thought was too late but I'm over 100% gains now.  Now I'm just holding long and laughing as great deals keep getting announced and moving the price higher.  \n\nJust pay attention.. the things talked about today like FLT and PNG will take off eventually.  Be patient, and realize that it's gambling.  Buy a bunch of a cheap penny stock and hope it takes off.  Sometimes they do, sometimes they don't.  If you want safe returns, don't play around with penny stocks.  \n\nMIR might go big, they're making a new class of pain killer that could disrupt the opiod industry.  Super cheap, might be worth a ton, but I've parked my money in there (and lost a bunch at this point) in the hopes their Phase 3 trials go great and this thing goes up 1000% in a year or two.",

On a bigger picture, of course DD occurs anytime I move my money anywhere, as it should for everyone.\n\nI also wouldn't touch FLT simply because I don't believe that drone delivery will replace cheap human labour at this time.  Sure it can help get medicine to far away areas, but that won't double my money anytime soon.",
