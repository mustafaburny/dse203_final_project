Unlike most fintechs Paysafe has a big exposure in live sporting events and brick and mortar retail which was completely shut down in 2020 due to Covid.  In a call with analysts they discussed their decision to keep revenue growth projections in line with the fintech market at large which is 11%.  They are deliberately leaving their M&amp;A plans out of their projections as well as their expected growth in US igaming.  \n\nThis is in keeping with Chairman of the Board Bill Foley's style which has been described as under promise and over deliver.  Many are betting on the growth of this company based on Foley's proven track record.  In just the last five years, Foley and his team grew Ceridian 3.3X ($4.2B to $14B), Dun &amp; Bradstreet 5.6X ($2B to $11.3B) and Black Knight 8.7X ($1.6B to $14B). He also grew Fidelity National Information Services 36.4X ($2.5Billion to over $91Billion). Foley recently said, \u201cThose characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.\u201d",

Great question.  Maybe the better question is why did I keep those 3?  \n\nThe answer is because I still see great share price growth value ahead of both EPR and MO though for different reasons and the SMHB yield (based on pre covid historicals) could yield as high as 72% based on my purchase price.  Though I only collected 10.14% in 2020 and 6.82% so far in 2021.  EPR has yet to reinstate its dividend and I fully expect that when they do, their share price will see a large upward move.  And MO?  Well... it is my opinion that Altria is uniquely positioned to be the largest player in the budding legalized marijuana industry in the USA.  So obviously I will hold that until such a time when that new industry can be realized and profited from and pocket a 9.54% yield (2020 actual) in the meantime.\n\nBut the reality is, I didn't buy some of the best dividend paying companies at the 2020 bottom because I wanted the dividend.  In fact... dividend investing is mostly a waste of time unless you plan on buying and forgetting... in which case... it still is since you'd be better off in an index fund.",

IBM is dying, Intel is 3 years away from the start of unrivaled growth and has potential to eventually surpass TSMC as the industry leader in chip production thanks to the gov/mil backing within 20 years.\n\nIf you're looking for big gains in the next 2-6 years Intel is probably not the stock for you. It's at a 13 P/E ratio because people perceive it like IBM which is fine with me, I'll keep adding.\n\nNo clue what TSMC will plan to do after 3nm to prevent stagnation.

My bet is that INTC will break through that resistance on 6Apr or 23Apr.

I'd probably play those profits -- if any -- into AMD puts through to May, because I think hedge fund selling will take place when Lisa Su inevitably acknowledges the incorrectness of her prediction that supply \"tightness\" would clear up by 2H21.\n\nI also believe that the Archegos liquidation is another sign that correlated hedge fund losses will spell disaster for the market. We saw this already with GME and the other short-squeeze names. Chipmakers like to lay out their capex as close to production ramp-up as possible, which means that LRCX/AMAT/ASML/KLIC/KLAC/CAJ/etc won't book profits immediately even if billions of dollars are allocated to the roadmap. So I'm waiting for a big selloff this summer to get into those names as a long-term position. May try to play that selloff using hedgie favorites and names that have a lot of room to fall. ARKK, TSLA, TSM, NVDA come to mind. TSM seems counterintuitive but you get the added potential catalyst of Chinese brinkmanship as well as a deepening of the water supply woes.\n\nI mention CAJ because it gives a good read on DUV demand. Their equipment segment had a lot of profit growth last quarter. But it's not as good a play as the others because only a fifth of its revenue comes from that segment.",
