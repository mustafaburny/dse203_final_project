I am almost completely in stocks, except with 5% of my portfolio in a Carbon Allowance ETF.\n\nOf the equities in my portfolio, about 40% is in ETFs (with a small exposure to small cap and emerging markets - it's not much because some of my stocks expose me to those markets as well.\n\nWithin my stock picks, I focus on companies with a great track record of growth and mostly with products / business models I understand, so most of it is in tech, especially software. I kinda regret missing out on hardware - AMD and NVDA, for example (though I did hold AMD a couple years ago and did pretty well with it). My best performers overall have been SQ, MSFT, AAPL, DHR and ISRG, but that depends on the timing of my purchases, too. Also TTD and AMD, but I don't hold those anymore.\n\nI try to keep a blend between growth and value, although I am tilted towards growth as I am only 24 and see these companies having a very bright future. These next few years might hit those stocks quite bad with interest rate hikes, but I believe it's worth keeping them for long term. These are stocks like ISRG, SE, SQ, SOFI, ILMN, and a potential longshot with CRSP (that's been doing bad, but it's less than 2% of my portfolio).\n\nWhat I consider the core of my portfolio are proven large cap money making machines which, I believe, have demonstrated their qualities over years - here, I consider AAPL, MSFT, BAM, GOOGL, NEE, DHR, COST, and now underperforming MA and V. I considered selling the last two, but as of now, I still see a brighter future ahead of them.\n\nThe rest is more value oriented with JNJ, BAC, JPM and MCD. I have these mostly to offset  hedge against the growth and tech in my portfolio, though they have been doing pretty well when it comes to stock price as well. I'm up 86% with BAC and 70% with MCD (bought first on March 23 2020).\n\n| Name                                   \t|    Type   \t| Instrument \t|       Sector       \t| Ticker \t| Target Weight \t|\n|----------------------------------------\t|:---------:\t|:----------:\t|:------------------:\t|:------:\t|--------------:\t|\n| WisdomTree Carbon                      \t| Commodity \t|     ETF    \t|                    \t|  CARB  \t|         5,00% \t|\n| iShares Core MSCI World Acc            \t|   Equity  \t|     ETF    \t|                    \t|  IWDA  \t|        29,00% \t|\n| iShares MSCI World Small Cap Acc       \t|   Equity  \t|     ETF    \t|                    \t|  IUSN  \t|         4,00% \t|\n| iShares Core MSCI Emerging Markets Acc \t|   Equity  \t|     ETF    \t|                    \t|  EMIM  \t|         4,00% \t|\n| Brookfield Asset Management            \t|   Equity  \t|    Stock   \t|     Financials     \t|   BAM  \t|         4,00% \t|\n| Intuitive Surgical                     \t|   Equity  \t|    Stock   \t|     Healthcare     \t|  ISRG  \t|         4,00% \t|\n| Apple                                  \t|   Equity  \t|    Stock   \t|     Technology     \t|  AAPL  \t|         4,00% \t|\n| Microsoft                              \t|   Equity  \t|    Stock   \t|     Technology     \t|  MSFT  \t|         4,00% \t|\n| Sea Limited                            \t|   Equity  \t|    Stock   \t|     Technology     \t|   SE   \t|         4,00% \t|\n| NextEra Energy                         \t|   Equity  \t|    Stock   \t|      Utilities     \t|   NEE  \t|         3,50% \t|\n| Costco                                 \t|   Equity  \t|    Stock   \t| Consumer Cyclicals \t|  COST  \t|         3,00% \t|\n| Danaher                                \t|   Equity  \t|    Stock   \t|     Healthcare     \t|   DHR  \t|         3,00% \t|\n| Alphabet                               \t|   Equity  \t|    Stock   \t|     Technology     \t|  GOOGL \t|         3,00% \t|\n| Adobe                                  \t|   Equity  \t|    Stock   \t|     Technology     \t|  ADBE  \t|         3,00% \t|\n| Square                                 \t|   Equity  \t|    Stock   \t|     Technology     \t|   SQ   \t|         3,00% \t|\n| Bank of America                        \t|   Equity  \t|    Stock   \t|     Financials     \t|   BAC  \t|         2,50% \t|\n| Johnson and Johnson                    \t|   Equity  \t|    Stock   \t|     Healthcare     \t|   JNJ  \t|         2,50% \t|\n| MasterCard                             \t|   Equity  \t|    Stock   \t|     Technology     \t|   MA   \t|         2,50% \t|\n| Visa                                   \t|   Equity  \t|    Stock   \t|     Technology     \t|    V   \t|         2,50% \t|\n| McDonald's                             \t|   Equity  \t|    Stock   \t| Consumer Cyclicals \t|   MCD  \t|         2,00% \t|\n| J.

I've done pretty well since I started with by far the biggest contribution to my returns being from buying some very heavily hit companies in March 2020 as I received a lump sum at that time and felt confident in those companies when there was so much panic. As I said above, I regret not being in NVDA and AMD as I thought about those a lot (I was in AMD for over a year in 2018-2020), but I've been doing well otherwise.\n\nI sometimes feel like it's too much companies, but I'm probably not going to reduce the number. Each of these has something I feel I would be missing by getting rid of them.",

Sure google can go after this 50b TAM, but is it worth it? TAM is kind of small for Google with all the existing service.
