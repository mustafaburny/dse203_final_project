Let's be honest: Diamond hands didn't work with this one. IDEX wrecked a lot of people back in June/July, and a lot of those people were in r/pennystocks.\n\nI've watched the stock closely since that last fall from glory, and just recently, I've noticed what I believe is foul play. This brief post will discuss what i've discovered, and will explain how i believe it works and how it affects potential IDEX investors. A conclusion will be included at the bottom for those who don't want to read the book. \n\n**IDEX** \n\nSince the crash, there's hasn't been a lot of news for the company and Alf seemed to go radio silent up until the Aug 11th earnings run up, which culminated in 25% decrease in value that immediately followed the Ideanomics Q2 conference call, but i'm not here to talk about that. What I am here to discuss is the new string of blog posts that have been 'spreading rumors,' about recent events, and what those blog posts mean relative to the 'big picture' of IDEX as an investible company. \n\nSteve Bannon, former white house strategist, was arrested earlier this week for cheating donors out of money. When i first learned of the arrest, it meant nothing to me, because i don't know anything about Steve Bannon. Still, I couldn't help but notice that almost immediately after the arrest took place, buzzing started on forums about how it was somehow connected to Ideanomics' past and present stock performance. \n\nSoon after the arrest and the buzzing, I discovered a link leading to an article on Medium which theorized that Steve Bannon and some Random Billionaire, Guo Wengui, whose yacht Bannon was arrested on, were actually in cahoots to take down Bruno Wu and IDEX.  It was a head scratcher / it's a small world type story, and it ostensibly revealed the inner workings of what IDEX has been through over these past few months. \n\n   The article stated quite clearly that there was a feud between these two rich men, and somehow, Ideanomics, and Ideanomics investors had been caught in the middle of some crazy billionaire pissing contest. Crazy, but very interesting. So, i figure that this is really strange, but billionaires do this kinda stuff, I guess. I mean, you can't make this stuff up, right-or can you?  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Bannon &amp; Guo** \n\nFirst of all, Here is the official-confirmed narrative of why Bannon was actually arrested as presented by the New York Times and other reputable sources^(1):\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Steve Bannon was arrested for fraud concerning a border-wall scheme that remains completely unrelated to Ideanomics or Bruno Wu. ](https://preview.redd.it/ou2xnvjcmmi51.png?width=771&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fee8a853be5a041d08334207543c913c6817b2ae)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Bannon is no angel. He's taken cash from those who were trying to build the 'great wall of Mexico,' yet, I see no mention of anything IDEX related at all.  ](https://preview.redd.it/vrvb0z9c0oi51.png?width=784&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d746c752f9cb322be53e3329472e9e00c93d5d19)\n\nSteve Bannon was arrested for fraud concerning a border-wall scheme, not for involvement in manipulation of the stock market. Basically, Bannon fundraised for Trump's wall but he pocketed some a substantial amount of the cash. Him and some of his friends have been arrested, and they're in trouble, but in all this drama, there's still no mention of Ideanomics or Bruno Wu. \n\nWhat there is mention of is the fact that Bruno was arrested on the 150 ft yacht of a Billionaire Chinese dissident, who has fled his homeland, and has a price on his head in China. The billionaire, Guo Wengui, is known to have a serious beef with Bruno Wu, the founder of Ideanomics. Like, serious beef w/o veggies. They both hate one another with a passion, and each yearns to see the other fail and there life ruined.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[150 ft is a pretty big boat. ](https://preview.redd.it/yvg1kvhm1oi51.png?width=768&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8370e881c8b577f51d5fdf6b080e65b856f2f0fe)\n\nThis well known tiff between Bruno Wu and Guo Wengui is no secret, and knowledge of the feud has lent credibility to some of the deluxe conspiracy theories we've seen released since Bannon's arrest. We'll go over those in a moment. The fact's of the matter though are that Bannon was arrested for something that is utterly separate from IDEX, and if one reads through the official narratives of what has taken place, there is absolutely no way, besides connecting dots whose relations cannot be validated, to reach such imaginative conclusions. \n\nStill, people have wild imaginations that pander to what they want to believe. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Julia Wang's Blog Post**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn August, 6th, Julia Wang, a completely unknown blogger personality, who has no significant article history^(2), decides to write 'Steve Bannon, the War of the Chinese Billionaires, and the FBI.' In the post, which by the way, is her first post on the website [Medium.com](https://Medium.com), Julia lays out several circumstances surrounding the Bannon/Guo relationship, the history between Guo and the Wu family, and a theory that Guo, after meeting Bannon, used the former political strategists connections and ties to attack Wu in various ways that only a connected man could facilitate. \n\nQuite the tale, and after the release of this text which give's what appears to be a windfall explanation as to why those june/july shorting activities took place, those who are invested in IDEX were salivating at the jowls, hoping that Alf would come forth and confirm the random bloggers claims that this had all been some horrible, unjustified hit job on Ideanomics. Many people who had been burned, and had set IDEX aside, now woke out of their slumber. Sentiment, after a very unsuccessful Q2, seemed to be salvageable to at-least some degree. \n\nBag holders rejoiced momentarily, but those interested in knowing whether or not this is actually a good stock to invest in have to stop and consider, what about other huge crashes that this stock has endured, which preceded the Hindenberg/Jcap reports ^(6)? This stock has a very 'sketchy' history.^(7) Should the reputation of IDEX be salvaged by this piece? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Julia Wang writes an article founded on nothing but speculation which attempts to tie Steve Bannon and Guo Wengui to IDEX stock shorting that occured in June. - https:\\/\\/medium.com\\/@juliawang2596\\/steve-bannon-the-war-of-the-chinese-billionaires-and-the-fbi-21e16930dfe1](https://preview.redd.it/6u5kn0cwmmi51.png?width=833&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b4789ef4d3a650d7fef2a982ff64e69afc0bcae7)\n\n   I found this new speculative narrative to be exorbitantly fluffy, meaning it was exclaiming great news for everyone who wanted a reason to be positive about $IDEX, but it had no evidence to back that news up.  So, I went ahead and cross-checked reputable sources (1,1.5, and literally any other official article the mentions the Bannon/Guo arrest and what it means), but, again, I found no credible media outlets that were both covering the Bannon/Guo situation, and that mentioned the words IDEX,  Ideanomics, or anything about Bruno Wu. This leads me to draw the conclusion that Julia is full of 'it', and her article actually is a typical penny stock fluff piece, right? Yes and no.\n\nI now begin to realize what it is I am looking at. To start, this is the beginning of a new pump cycle that IDEX is attempting to put into play. But, little do i know, it's a little more complicated than just that, and this is only the first of a string of articles and mentions that will be attempting to tie Bannon's arrest to Ideanomic's shortcomings as a company. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Investopedias key Takeaways from ' How to spot a Pump-and-Dump scheme'  \\(4\\) ](https://preview.redd.it/ftxjdurv4ri51.png?width=657&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fa7250147799eb57b9a018cc8aca6e263f44240d)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[An excerpt showing the speculative nature of Julia Wang's Thesis. It feels more like an inquiry of 'could i be right?' more than anything else.](https://preview.redd.it/arx86k6sdni51.png?width=757&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4fd44d075b3f3b09ab3a189d8f4cfd4b5c302b1e)\n\nAfter the first article is released by Julia Wang, and after I had begun realizing that there was quite a bit of currently unverifiable claims surrounding this new IDEX speculation, there came more articles and tweets. This time from a new, unknown author who goes by the name of Bert Voss. The man was an Enigma to me for about 15-20 minutes. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Bert Voss**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[This is the first tweet of his that gained significant traction and recognition. Once this came out, volume picked up and $IDEX started moving. Unfortunately, the link goes to Berts Wordpress, where the allegations against Steve Bannon, regarding IDEX stock manipulation, are not substantiated at all. So very shocking.  ](https://preview.redd.it/1swkvxh7xmi51.png?width=939&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=501e561173e9234ec4400880d1bb0deaf577351d)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis character, Bert, who I discover has been releasing content on his newly created Twitter for about ten days, but has only recently been recognized by the IDEX bag holder group, has the same 'predictable focus' as Julia Wang, which is to pin all of  Ideanomics' problems, on Steve Bannon, and Guo Wengui. He exists to alleviate Ideanomics and management of accountability, and to refurbish the public image of Ideanomics stock.  And so, Bert Voss' message begins to travel around the internet, and he becomes a hit with the 'already invested.'  \n\nInitially, Bert was of no great interest to me. He made these over the top claims about Steve Bannon's connection to Ideanomics, and was more overt and outspoken than Julia wang, but again, he gave ZERO EVIDENCE to back those claims up, which is right on par with the type of activity we saw from her. A bit more research into this figure would expose cracks in his speculation and the facade that he's projecting to his viewing audience. After looking closely, it's very easy to see that Burt Voss is neither telling the truth about Bannon/Guos ties to Ideanomics shorting activities-and that is not to be confused with mistakingly giving false information- nor is Burt Voss, Burt Voss. He's a fake persona. \n\nIt's important to note that by this time, I had already called out the inauthenticity of Julia Wang's articles on Stock Twits, and that she had disappeared literally the day subsequent to these aspersions--although i'm not claiming she stopped because of me, or even knew that i was spreading word of my doubt on the internet. \n\n   Reaching back into Bert, Voss has three main presences online right now, which he uses to publish and disseminate his work. Outside of these three web addresses, he can be found **nowhere else**. I've checked, thoroughly, although I wouldn't be surprised if he pops up somewhere else in the future. I will very briefly go over each of these right now. \n\nFirst, we have the Voss Twitter: [https://twitter.com/VossBert](https://twitter.com/VossBert) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Bert Voss' Twitter Page. Created in July, and activated in August, this page is solely dedicated to linking Bannon and the Billionaire, Guo, to the JCapital\\/Hindenberg Shorts that occured in June.

Again, the portfolio of this is a few articles solely dedicated to linking Bannon and the Billionaire, Guo, to the JCapital\\/Hindenberg Shorts that occured in June. ](https://preview.redd.it/rr0jb4gbdni51.png?width=1300&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1d03c4cb2632bffcadac70ab6b8685f6a96dfd7e)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you go to these sites, you can read through Bert's 'blog' publications. I'm not going to go into great detail about what all of his blogs discuss because it's just more of the same; we've already talked about his focus. I encourage you to read them all if you have the time. He's trying to get rid of bad sentiment, to make way for new investors. He's got a long bibliography, as if a long bibliography is an adequate substitute for the legitimate evidence needed to validate extraordinary claims such as the one's he's promulgating, but his main thesis, for lack of better words, is unsubstantiated trash. \n\nAfter the crash happened, Ideanomics became the butt of many jokes, and for good reason. Bag holders were cult like in their conviction that the stock would go back up. Management had every opportunity to prove their legitimacy during the last crash, but they never did. Many people who saw the events take place will likely agree that the damage from Hindenberg/Jcap reports could have been easily mitigated with very little effort. Where's the mother lode, Alf?  \n\nSo, we find that Bert and Julia are here to discredit legitimate concerns about the company that is Ideanomics. Concerns that were brought to the public's attention, and to Ideanomics' attentions, but were never addressed by Ideanomics or their management. Bert is here to convince you that IDEX isn't a fraudulent company, and all allegations brought against it were baseless and without merit. This is actually something IDEX management should be doing, but if they did that, it would be considered securities fraud. So instead, 'Bert' is lying for them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The Persona of  'Bert Voss'** \n\nBert Voss is not a real person. His picture is of a real person, and there's probably a man out there, somewhere, who is indeed named Bert Voss, but Bert Voss, the man on twitter campaigning against Steve Bannon and Guo; the man who is trying to save the reputation of Ideanomics, is not who he claims to be. \n\nHis Twitter biography, at first glance, attempts to humanize him, but the content on that page and on his blogs  confirm that this is fake account with an agenda like no other. In an attempt to substantiate this theory of mine-that Bert is not a real person- I gave 'Bert' an opportunity to vindicate himself by posting a simple verification picture. This Gesture reminded me of when IDEX Bag holders begged Alf to take a simple picture in front of the MEG, but received nothing but silence. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[I can write \\\\\" I am Trebek and I don't believe Bert. August, 23, devils year\\\\\" on a piece of scratch paper, and take a snap shot with my phone in less than 3 minutes. This is an extremely simple task. ](https://preview.redd.it/8tb3rs4ofri51.png?width=617&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6207468cebf9881d1b13a0990e628b3f72ff9b70)\n\n Bert immediately decided to respond with this: \n\n[Catfish Bert at it again. I wonder who is actually running this account. What is there to get, Bert? ](https://preview.redd.it/94rs8gpbhri51.png?width=598&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=149aa2ad2ab985e8d18aa64726cb6997b94ae653)\n\n   Moving forward, Bert's entire persona has been crafted for the sole purpose of discrediting Steve Bannon; Guo, the billionaire; and the validity of the short attacks that occurred in June/July after J Cap and Hindenberg released their reports. An interesting side note is that Voss linked to that first Julia Wangs blog article several (4) times before ever releasing his own pieces. That is a vague connection between these two, and it's interesting, although you can draw your own conclusion on whether they are tied or not. I personally think they're running the same 'game.'\n\nInitially, before asking him for the verification photo, I messaged Voss in an attempt to find out more about his claims. I was hoping he would be able to validate them right there, on the spot. Instead, he told me that he was just ' really interested' and that ' it didn't take long to follow the crumbs and connect the dots.'  Again, he lacked any substance in his responses to me. Bert claims he's just interested in shorts, and has no stake in whatever direction IDEX might go. Fascinating. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Picture perfect: He's just kicking it, running a propaganda anti-steve bannon\\/guo account that's pro idex, posting about 20 times  day, writing speculative blogs, on accounts that are less than a month old with zero internet history when you try to pull up his name. He is white knighting IDEX out of boredom. Wow. ](https://preview.redd.it/lmyum3fmiri51.png?width=634&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=36d38ea1af40bcbbb807c4064c5a79a60d311fea)\n\nHe told me that he was in $SRNE which was affected by a JCAP report, and was taking on his current projects simply due to spare time garnered after Covid-19 left him without a job.  It took only a few messages for me to realize that this was not an authentic person that I was speaking to, because it just didn't add up. Why create a fake, speculative story to save IDEX if you have no stake in that company, and there's absolutely no evidence to validate your claims?  \n\nA normal person with his alleged background would consider the negative ramifications of such behavior. At the very least, he could lose a lot of innocent people a lot of money during a time where people cannot afford to lose. Although i was calm and very respectful, I became 'more inquisitive,' and was blocked from his twitter account almost immediately. And then, last night, he unblocked me. The plot thickens. That's when i asked him to send the snapshot to invalidate my theory, to which his response was to play dumb. So what's the plan here?\n\nWhat Bert is doing, if successful, would mean great things for IDEX. It would get them off the hook for all the just accusations and inquiries that happened earlier this year. The inquiries and accusations, when, un rectified by IDEX management, resulted in the plummeting of IDEX stock. Those Jcap and Hindenberg articles were SEVERE in their revelations, and they made almost all bagholders feel like complete idiots for believing in something, that after closer inspection, was clearly riddled with sketchy hallmarks of a textbook pump and dump scheme. To think, IDEX's last round of lawsuits wasn't even the first round for this year, and bag holders had completely missed that. \n\nAlso, Voss and Wang are taking shots at Guo and Bannon. I could give a shit less about these two latter characters, but apparently Guo and Wu are mortal enemies, and Wu would like nothing more than to shatter Guo's character and have him returned to China to be sent to some re-education camp. I care about none of these men, which is why I can see clearly that this attack does not seem ordinary, it seems like someone is trying to kill many birds with one stone. It's very intelligent, on the surface, but a small amount of cursory research turns up that there's no substance to the allegations presented by either Julia Wang, or the fake catfish, Bert Voss. \n\n**IDEX bag holders need to believe** \n\nIf i want you to believe me, it's pretty easy for me to make that happen. I just give you something you want to believe, and make myself look like a good a person who would never tell you a fib. His profile says he's a father, a mentor; he's a life coach, and he's a person who was ' retired by coronavirus.' It's a very like able portrait of a man who sounds extremely respectable and like someone i would trust if it were a real bio. Unfortunately, it's not a real bio,  It's a trick. \n\n   Bag holders NEED IDEX to do well, and those who play pennies regularly know that if bag holders believe good news, they become their own marketing team and spread that information far and wide as they can. It's pro bono to get them out of their situation. And that's what we're seeing happen here. Bag holders have taken a few speculative Blog articles, and are currently spreading them relentlessly as fact to further their agenda of making IDEX go up. To them, it doesn't matter if unsuspecting new investors are burned in the process, they are looking for RESULTS. \n\n\n\n**Why?** \n\nIdeanomics and management need to be vindicated before the stock can be properly and smoothly pumped and dumped, again. The company has a sheer history of shady practices, lawsuits, trying to pay off debt by offering stock instead of cash resolution to alleviate debt, ect. This list is pretty long if you know where to look. \n\nThese blog 'authors' i've spoken about here are publishing their works in an effort to change public perception about the viability of the stock. Right now, most people who know about IDEX, and former investors, rightfully believe that IDEX is a poor investment choice, even for a penny stock. People lost money to the tune of probably hundreds of thousands during the last crash, and that poisoned the well of good faith many people had in this company before the infamous Hindenberg and Jcap articles were released to the public.\n\nI truly believe that transparency into the companies true inner workings s a response to the short reports was the be response that management could have taken to preserve their image with current and potential investors alike. The fact that management did not make this effort to vindicate themselves, to me, was proof of wrongdoing. It is common sense that if these shorting agencies were incorrect, then all Alf or Wu, or anyone else affiliated with Ideanomics had to do was use honesty to save their name. They didn't use honestly, because honesty was no an option. \n\n   But this is a pump and dump stock, and they need it to go back up again. It's close to reaching one dollar too, so surely, it cannot drop below that mark or it runs the risk of being delisted from the Nasdaq, *again*. So, to effectively pump this stock back up, Ideanomics would HAVE TO CHANGE PUBLIC PERCEPTION of it, and that would include trying to refurbish how investors perceive what happened during the last crash. If they could do that, many bag holders wouldn't sell and bail-out on the re-rise, and it would also bring new investors in on any FOMO that might occur. \n\nThe blog authors insist that IDEX was shorted so heavily not as the result of anything organic, but because of grudge-match between two Chinese billionaires. No reputable outlets are saying ANYTHING even close to what these blogs are insinuating. They're pulling their claims out of thin air and couldn't substantiate them to save their lives. It's a completely fake narrative. But, again, let's not forget that these are blogs that are hyping the stock again, and fluff is always just that: fluff. \n\nDo not believe the fluff. \n\n\n\n**Conclusion** \n\nIdeanomics, which is who I believe is behind this this recent string of speculatory blog posts, is trying to trick their current bag holders, and a new set of potential investors, into believing that their company is a viable investment opportunity, which it is not. In order to achieve this goal of theirs, they have used fake accounts and published fake articles which have gone viral throughout the stock community. These fake articles have been well received by those who are currently invested into the stock, and are being used as catalysts to refurbish the publics perception of the company. \n\nThe main thesis of these articles posted by these bloggers **CANNOT BE SUBSTANTIATED, period, the end.** I put this in bold because this is by far the most important thing for readers to understand. IDEX is running like a legitimate scam MLM pyramid operation, using it's bottom members and bag holders to disseminate false information in hopes of recruiting new, unsuspecting investors  who may potentially stumble and come to this stock, only to be ruined by what will undoubtedly take place, which is the execution of a pump, a dump, or both. \n\nThis refurbishment of public perception is a necessary step towards the goal of successfully re pumping the stock sometime in the future, as well as the immediate goal of staying above one dollar to avoid being delisted by the Nasdaq. New investors will help prop the stock up and maintain the latter. This company has a history riddled with scandal and confusion. \n\nMany 'batches' of investors have been burned here, and it is in the best interest of all investors, both new and old who may be interested in investing in IDEX, to do EXTENSIVE research regarding the history of this company's business practices and how it has steered and then neglected its investor base before you put a single dime into this stock. \n\nI am not invested in IDEX, and I am not short, but I am sincerely concerned at what I see as a not so obvious plot to trick people into a walking into a trap, which is what i believe IDEX is, a trap. Thank you for your time, and please, be careful with your money. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[The internet taking the bait. ](https://preview.redd.it/idv77841nsi51.png?width=591&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d46cf1de8a51362d0ee26920a845a713040f2feb)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nModest bibliography: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1.

        "selftext": "I responded to a comment on this post ([Someone enlighten me on Peloton](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/i36mhk/someone_enlighten_me_on_peloton/)) by u/Wu-Han. So I decided to write up a short article on how I see Peloton Interactive.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nI paid almost $3,000 for a clothes rack. Or at least that\u2019s what all my friends said to me when I decided to buy a Peloton. What they didn't know is that I have already logged 90 rides before I even bought the bike. \n\n*I'm head over heels in love with my Peloton.* \n\nFor anyone who has been living under a rock, Peloton is the new start in home fitness. Except they have been around since 2012. \n\nPeloton offers high-end exercise equipment (stationary bicycle and treadmill) with live and on-demand instructor led fitness classes to take at home. The classes are either streamed or recorded from their fitness studio in NYC. They also offer classes on meditation, yoga, stretching, HIIT, bootcamp, running and more from their tablet and phone apps. \n\nNow that is out of the way, this is what you REALLY get with Peloton. \n\nA high end bike that looks like a piece of artwork. Fancy shoes, water bottle, heart rate monitor, headphones, weights and slim fitted t shirts. A statement piece to put in your living room to show visitors that you have more money than sense. Some of that might be true. \n\n**But what you really get is Tony Robbins in Spandex.** \n\nA Peloton bike is really more like therapy with some fitness mixed in. And fitness and entertainment rolled in to one. (Fit-tainment?) Where else would you find beautiful, charming and fit people telling you these things?\n\n* You got this hill and I got you. \n* Are you going to overcome your fear or are you going to let your fear overcome you? Easy. You are going to overcome. \n* Put on your crowns today. \n* The hardest part about today was showing up.\n* You have no idea what you are capable of. \n\nEvery single class has mantras and motivations just like this. There are instructors of all walks of life that represent the best in all of us coaching, motivating, challenging and sometimes flirting with us (I'm looking at you Jess King - [https://www.instagram.com/p/B-sZ5bGBlE8/](https://www.instagram.com/p/B-sZ5bGBlE8/)).\n\nI'm not alone. \n\nAccording to their website ([https://investor.onepeloton.com/investor-relationS](https://investor.onepeloton.com/investor-relationS)), Peloton has 2.6 million members with a 93% 12 month retention rate. That means it would take 14 years to lose their customers! Talk about stickiness. And those 2.6 million members completed over 44 million rides. In Q3 of 2020, they posted $524 million in revenue. Its had a 316% increase in annual revenue since 2017 - $219m to $915m!\n\nDon't get too excited. Peloton still isn't profitable. Normally, a negative P/E really upsets me. But I love my Peloton bike so much I am still interested. \n\nIts 2019 IPO was to raise funds to expand internationally. Then COVID-19 hit. And it ruined the world. It closed every gym. \n\nThen Peloton soared. Peloton had a 66% increase in orders due to Covid-19 and a 94% increase in subscribers since the year prior. [https://investor.onepeloton.com/node/7041/html](https://investor.onepeloton.com/node/7041/html). And its churn rate was the lowest its been in 4 years. More people are buying and fewer are leaving. \n\nIf it weren't for Covid-19, what would customers be doing? \n\nMaybe the same thing. But look at the alternatives to Peloton. \n\n1. Do nothing.\n2. Go to a gym\n3. Go to a spin class\n4. Workout at home\n\nLots of people do 1. Most  people will continue to do nothing for most of their lives. We don't care about those people right now. \n\nWhat was shocking to read is that 65% of people in a survey by Schwinn Fitness prefer to wkrout at home. [https://augustafreepress.com/survey-most-americans-prefer-home-workouts-to-the-gym/](https://augustafreepress.com/survey-most-americans-prefer-home-workouts-to-the-gym/). I assumed people love the gym. But only 20% of people have a gym membership. And even fewer use it. [https://fortune.com/2020/06/11/coronavirus-gyms-workouts-fitness-apps-reopening/](https://fortune.com/2020/06/11/coronavirus-gyms-workouts-fitness-apps-reopening/)\n\nThe question I get asked all the time - why don't you just go to SoulCycle instead of wasting your money on a Peloton bike? \n\n1. I can't. They all closed due to the Pandemic. Or at least they should.\n2. I don't want to. I want to workout at home. Plus its cheaper to buy a Peloton. \n\nSoulCycle doesn't sell memberships. They sell per class. And it STARTS at $25 and only goes up from there. Remember the 90 classes I took on my Peloton app? That would have cost me $2,250 for SoulCycle. It only cost me $30 for the iPad app. \n\n**Let's do some simple math.** \n\nI love my Peloton and will ride it 3 times per week for the first year I own it. I paid $2,900 up front for the bike and all the accessories. And I pay $39 a month for the membership. My first year I paid $3368 for 156 classes. If I went to SoulCycle I would have paid a minimum of $3900. So I already saved almost 10%. \n\nWhat about 2 years in? I've paid $3836 total for my Peloton. And $7800 for SoulCycle. But what if I want to ride 5 days a week? Now I'm paying $6500 a year for SoulCycle. Plus I have to schedule a class online and be around people. And what if a class fills up? \n\nPeloton is on demand 24/7. No wait times, no classes being sold out.\n\nThere's a hidden benefit to Peloton ownership. What if after 2 years I decide I'm done? I can actually resell my Peloton bike. There is a HUGE used demand for the bike. Right now, used Peloton bikes are being sold for over $2,000. But there aren't many to choose from. The salvage value of the bike makes the decision to buy a Peloton instead of going to SoulCycle even better. \n\n**But when will they be profitable?** \n\nAnalyst and company predictions say 2023. But its hard to tell. It could be so much sooner - or it could never happen. International expansion will surely come with more expenses. Peloton has hardware costs which are variable, software costs which are more or less fixed, studio expenses and marketing. The spend roughly 35% of their revenue per year on marketing. That isn't going to go down anytime soon. \n\n**Investors love Peloton, too. Maybe too much.** \n\nThe stock price has soared in 2020 - nearly 300%. Since P/E doesn't matter, we have to look at the P/B. And its over 12. Which is high. \n\nThe price may be high, but Peloton has the best product on the market. Customers are flocking to buy it. And more importantly they are staying to use it. \n\nI may not have had the fitness transformation that so many Peloton members have had. And I haven't even enjoyed the meteoric rise the stock has given investors (I missed the boat on that one). But my future is much brighter because I bought a Peloton. And I think that is also true for the company.",
