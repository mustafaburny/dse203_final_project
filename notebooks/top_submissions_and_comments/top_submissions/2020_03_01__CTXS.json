Likewise, the Micron CEO recently spoke on the increased datacenter usage and capacity demands.  \n\nJust curious what your favorite companies/ stocks are given this environment?",

        "selftext": "Seems like a good candidate for next few quarters.  Given the COVID, and companies increasing work from home options for their staff, this company provides specialized solutions for this purpose.  \n\nThey were already executing well and this whole beer virus is just going to accelerate the deployment of their system to more corps.  \n\nRecently beat on earnings Jan 23 and ran up to $130.50.  Dropped all the way to $101 a few days ago.  23% drop, definitely overdone given the opportunity they have.  \n\nGood candidate for ATM LEAPs",

They are getting ready to be bombarded with refund requests and are legally obligated of the event is cancelled.  Sports, concerts, plays, everything jus before the spring/summer rush.  This is literally when they make all there money for the year.  They are fucked harder than a boomer bull right now. They've seen a drop but have lots of room left to fall esp when they report negative numbers for Q1.\n\nOn an opposite note. CTXS will have a great Q1 selling VPN services for work from homers.",

        "selftext": "Firewall companies are gonna make bank in the next earnings cycle.. from what I've seen, they're pretty much a lot of the limiting factor for number of employees that can work from home. You want the normal office VPN/firewall that allows 10% of your workforce to work from home? It's $8000 plus $2500/year support. You want the MacDaddy VPN/firewall that allows 100% of your workforce to work from home with plenty of bandwidth? $80000 and $25000/year support..\n\nThe pricing is similar for all the big firewall manufacturers.. My favorite is:\n\n**Check Point Software Technologies (CHKP)**\n\nSay you're some random sales company and you want everyone working from home cause you hate dying of Wuhan Flu.. Well, you also hate laying people off or paying them not to accomplish anything.. And, you hate them complaining that everything is slow or they're getting kicked off. So, you put in a better firewall and now everyone can work from home.. You got a Check Point already? Put in the bigger more expensive one.. and boom.. more bandwidth.\n\nOf course there's other factors.. but aside from ISP bandwidth, the VPN/firewall device is usually a large limiting factor.\n\nAnother one I think is in the same boat is **Citrix Systems (CTXS)**. For some reason, government entities love to set up Citrix virtual desktops and act like they're more secure than other virtual desktops. What are you paying for? Who knows? You get virtual desktops and now your employees can virtually work from home..\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOf course, WSB people will probby sell these for a week to have money to put into SPY puts.. but once they're billionaires, they'll probby wanna spread it out.. and some might happen to fall into these stocks.",
