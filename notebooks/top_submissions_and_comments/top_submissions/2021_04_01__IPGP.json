        "selftext": "[Source](https://rsch.baml.com/access?q=JLQz8CGIkJs)\n\n**Key takeaways**\n\n* Data suggests that institutional announcements, inflows into GBTC, and miner reward cuts help drive Bitcoin prices\n* The main argument for Bitcoin is not diversification, stable returns, or inflation protection, but sheer price appreciation\n* Bitcoin CO2 emissions are the same as Greece's and rise in line with prices. Our ESG reading is low on E, and mixed on S &amp; G\n\n## Bitcoin supply is artificially scarce, demand drives prices\n\nJust like in other commodities, supply and demand drive Bitcoin prices. But there are twists. Bitcoin output is capped at 21mn coins and supply growth halves every 4 years. It is designed to become increasingly constrained. So demand swings are key to price moves. Indeed, we show major institutional announcements and miner reward cuts have been followed by upward Bitcoin moves. Similarly, flows into the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) appear to lead weekly Bitcoin returns. A while ago, we argued a surge in trading liquidity was a key feature of the asset. Yet Bitcoin remains limited by its complex settlement process (crypto mining), and can just handle 14k transactions per hour relative to Visa's stated 236mn.\n\n## No good reason to own BTC unless you see prices going up\n\nBitcoin has also become correlated to risk assets, it is not tied to inflation, and remains exceptionally volatile, making it impractical as a store of wealth or payments mechanism. As such, the main portfolio argument for holding Bitcoin is not diversification, stable returns, or inflation protection, but rather sheer price appreciation, a factor that depends on Bitcoin demand outpacing supply. Unlike other asset classes, our work shows liquidity bursts measured by the Amihud ratio caused positive Bitcoin returns. Average 10y Sharpe ratio for Bitcoin is about 1.3 despite stellar returns, compared to 1 for NDX. Plus Bitcoin returns are sensitive to increased dollar demand. A net inflow into Bitcoin of $93mn may result in a 1% price rise, while the analogue for gold is more than 20 times higher.\n\n## Our Bitcoin ESG read: low on E, mixed on S and G\n\nFew ESG providers factor Bitcoin exposure into ESG ratings. But its Environmental score is poor: the network emits today about 60mn tons of CO2, the same as Greece. Plus a $1bn fresh inflow into Bitcoin may cause CO2 to rise by the equivalent of 1.2mn ICE cars. As hash power today is mostly in coal-fired Xinjiang, a link between prices, energy demand &amp; CO2 means Bitcoin is tied to Chinese coal. Should prices rise to $1mn, Bitcoin may turn into the world's 5th largest emitter, surpassing Japan. On Social &amp;Governance issues, democratization of money and anonymity of ownership can be positive, as it is helpful in territories with corrupt financial systems and lowers costs by eliminating intermediaries. But negatives outweigh. Anonymity aids nefarious activities. Reprisk, an ESG tracker, found 181 companies faced risks linked to Bitcoin around money laundering, corruption, bribery, fraud, and breaches of data privacy.\n\n## CBDCs are kryptonite for crypto, but DeFi is intriguing\n\nA number of central banks (notably, the ECB) are talking about launching retail digital currencies that may use mainstream technology and operate on mainstream payment rails. Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) are aimed at protecting CBs against private sector stablecoins (such as Diem), as CBs view Bitcoin et al as (spec) assets, not currencies. Also, the growth of decentralized finance (\"DeFi\") shows the strength of Ethereum; its computational ability is vital to DeFi applications. Yet Ethereum has similarESG issues as Bitcoin, even if it may have better tools to tackle them. DeFi is interesting, but small and faces challenges in going mainstream. We think it hasn't a compelling lending proposition at present, and its diversification makes it challenging for the mass market.",

        "selftext": "Every single day this month, I tried to do the one thing that everybody says you shouldn't try to do. I tried predict the exact daily movements of the stock market -- specifically, the daily direction, high, and low of the NASDAQ -- and posted my best guess in the daily discussion forum.\n\nI had to pay incredibly close attention to the stock market every day to do it. Every single morning, I did technical and market analysis to try to keep from publicly embarrassing myself. I learned more about the stock market this month than I have in my entire time trading.\n\nTo celebrate one month of predictions, I wanted to take a look back at the month of March and share some of the things I've learned.\n\nHere's the first one:\n\n**I can't predict the stock market.**\n\n*Damn it.* I really thought I'd be able to do it.\n\nYou can see my [full scorecard here](https://datastudio.google.com/reporting/944799e4-93a3-4aa3-9a1a-68059d06c4a2/page/MkMAC), but it isn't really anything to brag about. Here's how I did:\n\n* **Direction:** 65% correct\n* **Daily high:** Median error of 0.26%\n* **Daily low:** Median error of 0.36%\n\nI was always more interested in the highs and lows than the direction, but *damn* is 65% ever a bad score. I've looked into it -- if I'd just predicted whatever the premarket said, I would've been right 74% of the time.\n\nPart of the problem was this:\n\n**When J. Powell talks, there's a 66% chance the market will tank.**\n\nWhen J. Powell talked, my prediction was wrong more often than it was right -- and usually by a lot. On average, my prediction for the daily low was off by 1.37% whenever he spoke.\n\nI wanted to look into that, so I tested out some of the big narratives we heard this month\n\n[Click here to see that research visualized.](https://datastudio.google.com/reporting/944799e4-93a3-4aa3-9a1a-68059d06c4a2/page/HORAC)\n\nJ. Powell used to be able to pump the market -- but since 2020, I learned, the market has turned red on 66% of the days that he has either made a speech or a public testimony, with the market closing, on average, down 1.24%.\n\n**The NASDAQ is often a better predictor of a stock's price than the company itself.**\n\nI've seen a lot of posts here lately saying: \"Why is everybody talking about indexes? Isn't this supposed to be a stock forum?\"\n\nOne thing this month affirmed for me is that, if you want to know what AAPL or MSFT are going to do today, you have to look at the market itself first.\n\nAAPL, MSFT, GOOG, and AMZN were all extremely correlated with the NASDAQ this month, to the point that, statistically speaking, it can be said that 81% of the variations in Apple's price this month can be explained by changes in the NASDAQ.\n\nI saw a lot of people in the daily discussion asking: \"Why is AAPL tanking? What new is there?\" But -- unless there actually is company news -- that's often the wrong question to ask. \n\n**The market isn't always affected by what CNBC says...**\n\nOne of the biggest stories we heard this month was about the \"bond yield\". The 10-year bond yield went up today, CNBC would report, and so the NASDAQ was sure to tank.\n\nIt never really made sense to a lot of investors -- so I looked into whether that story held up.\n\nI'll let you draw your own conclusions, but here's what I can say for sure:\n\n* There was no statistically significant correlation between the 10-year bond yield and the NASDAQ's price in March\n* If there were one, it would be a positive correlation. When the bond yield went up, it was more likely that the NASDAQ would go up with it than down.\n* There was more of a correlation on days when the bond yield reached a new 12-month high -- but only if the new yield was heavily reported. If it went unmentioned, the NASDAQ went up.\n* The days when the bond yield did significantly go up and the NASDAQ did significantly go down were all days when J. Powell gave a speech\n\n**... but sometimes it is.**\n\nThat doesn't mean everything CNBC said was a lie this year.\n\nAnother huge story this month was the rotation out of tech into value stocks -- and then, at the end of the month, the rotation back.\n\nThis story *totally* holds up. If you plot a tech stock like AAPL's price against JP Morgan's (which I've done for you [here](https://datastudio.google.com/reporting/944799e4-93a3-4aa3-9a1a-68059d06c4a2/page/HORAC)), you'll see that, 61% of the time, these stocks went in the exact opposite direction.\n\nPeople really were rotating out of tech and into value -- and they really are starting to come back.\n\n**I still think the stock market can be predicted**\n\nWhen I started doing this, I got a lot of hate from people who said that only an idiot would try to predict the market. But after a while, those hate messages stopped -- and, instead, people started sending me hate messages saying that they could predict the market better than I can.\n\nThey probably can. I didn't do as well as I'd like this month, but, when I was right, I knew *why* I was right. And when I was wrong, I knew *why* I was wrong -- and had a pretty good idea of how to do better next time.\n\nEverything is *not* priced-in, I've learned this month. Take Biden's speech last night. The market didn't even budge while he was talking. Sure, we were in afterhours, but even Robinhood users were allowed to invest -- and his plan had been laid out weeks in advance. But the Wall Street traders were off work, so the market didn't budge until the morning -- when it absolutely mooned.\n\nIf you pay close enough attention, you *can* get ahead of Wall Street. I'm increasingly convinced of that, and I believe that my predictions will get better as time goes on.\n\n[You can see today's prediction here.](https://datastudio.google.com/reporting/944799e4-93a3-4aa3-9a1a-68059d06c4a2/page/kHRAC)",

        "selftext": "The details of the Biden infrastructure plan are now out and let's just say that it is a huge disappointment. We were hoping for unbridled spending instead we get one time, highly precise spending items and a reversal of the Trump tax plan and then some more...\n\nThe reconciliation was meant to allow the dems to spend without any concession of tax increases but it seems that progressive dems want to raise taxes...for the purpose of raising taxes. The sellside is only starting to catch up to this reality.\n\nFirst here is a summary of the tax initiatives by GS:\n\n**A 28% corporate rate**: President Biden proposed this during the presidential campaign. Each percentage point of corporate tax rate increase raises a little over $100bn over ten years in tax revenue, so this proposal would raise between $700-800bn/10 years. *We think Congress can raise the rate to 24-25%, but might start to run into resistance among centrist Democrats between 26% and 28%.\\**\n\n**Tightening GILTI**: Similar to the Biden campaign proposal, the White House proposes to raise the effective tax rate on Global Intangible Low Tax Income (GILTI) to 21% from an effective rate of 10.5% today, move the system to a country-by-country basis that would keep companies from using tax credits from high tax jurisdictions to offset GILTI earnings in low tax jurisdictions, and rescind the policy that applies the tax to income only above a 10% return on physical capital. This would mean that the GILTI regime would apply to most companies with foreign income rather than just to IP-intensive industries like healthcare and technology, and would likely also raise taxes for companies that currently have little to no GILTI exposure. The Tax Policy Center estimated the campaign proposal would raise $442bn over ten years.\n\n**Other international tax changes** The White House release appears to contemplate replacing the Base Erosion and Anti-Abuse Tax (BEAT), saying that it would replace \u201can ineffective provision in the 2017 tax law that tried to stop foreign corporations from stripping profits out of the United States.\u201d It also proposes to eliminate Foreign Derived Intangible Income (FDII), which encouraged US-based companies to hold their IP in the US by setting an effective tax rate on that income similar to the effective tax rate on IP held abroad and taxed through the GILTI regime.\n\n**A minimum tax on book income** The proposal would also establish a 15% minimum tax on corporate book income reported to investors, which would serve as a check against companies that report large profits to shareholders but no profits to the IRS. The campaign proposal would have applied this globally on a country-by-country basis, but the White House release indicates only that it would apply this only to \u201cthe very largest corporations.\u201d\n\n**New restrictions on inversion**s The White House does not define what this would be, but inversions are likely to play a larger role in tax policy if the rest of the proposal were to pass, as the US would then have a high tax on the foreign earnings of multinationals compared with most other developed countries that rely on mainly\n\nterritorial tax systems.\n\n==============================================\n\nGS Estimates a 9% hit on EPS\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/q7ow3gjfujq61.png?width=740&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b8f975ac24b51f5a267719f2b32163fc49168bf4\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y5ag5dhgujq61.png?width=740&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fb110ba1a3f932b9260ad331939d5cd590bab722\n\nBAML Estimates a 7% hit to EPS 2022 (currently consensus at 200$\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g4whch0hujq61.png?width=740&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a088bffcffb6a4595c138380aa8fd82482f96783\n\n**Ed Yardeni**, chief investment strategist at Yardeni Research, wrote this week that Biden's proposed 28% corporate tax rate, if implemented, \"would reduce S&amp;P 500 earnings per share by $15, to $200 in 2022.\"\n\nThat 7% haircut is likely more than Wall Street has been pricing in. **UBS** equity strategist Keith Parker wrote on March 9 that he anticipates a 3.6% hit to EPS from Biden's tax plan.\n\nParker wrote that hiking the tax rate on long-term capital gains from **20% to 39.6% could slice 1.5 points off the S&amp;P 500 P/E multiple,** potentially another 7% hit. UBS expects that not quite half that tax hike will become law.\n\n==============================================\n\nThe only reason the sellside isn't outright bearish yet is because they seem to think that only a watered down version of this bill will pass. that's not true. via reconciliation what Biden wishes is what happens there is only one limiting swing vote in practice and that is senator Joe Manchin. Guess what the man is fine with a tax hike of A*T LEAST 25% so he LOVES THIS:*\n\n&gt;While he didn't predict a price tag, Manchin said Congress should do \"everything we possibly can\" to pay for it. He said there should be \"tax adjustments\" to former President Donald Trump\u2019s 2017 tax law to boost revenues, including by raising the corporate rate from the current 21 percent to at least 25 percent.\n\n[https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/manchin-calls-enormous-infrastructure-package-paid-new-taxes-n1261949](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/manchin-calls-enormous-infrastructure-package-paid-new-taxes-n1261949)\n\n## So for now i definitely don't see how the market can get away with pricing NONE OF THIS. BUY PUTS.\n\nMoving on to other asset classes which will explain why I only anticipate a drawdown of 5% :\n\nthe phasing of the plan is problematic in that infra plans tend to take a long time to start hitting GDP while the taxes hit will be immediate hence it will reduce 2022 GDP growth.

Being the software provider for 23 out of 25 top EV automakers, Blackberry will also experience the same explosive growth soon.\n\nUpgrading train and road infrastructure might imply the adoption of Internet of Things (IoT) and Vehicle to Infrastructure communication (V2X) to enhance logistical/traffic management for better efficiency, productivity and public safety. As major infrastructure becomes connected to the internet, security will be a major requirement because these infrastructure will become hackable surfaces that can cause serious damage. Blackberry is the leading software provider for mission critical applications, IoT cybersecurity and Unified Endpoints Management (UEM) that has a great track record working closely with governments across the world. It is very likely that Blackberry will win major government contracts soon in this space given its technical expertise in the IoT space and huge engineering workforce in the US.",

I know I know -- SEC investigation -- yes I know one of their trucks burned to the ground in January on a test drive.\n\nBut i like the way they are doing the trucks.  They actually look like a truck -- compare it to the Cyber truck, and just looks alone it wins hands down.  I also think the hub motors will be the way for EV to go in the future.  The space a motor like Tesla uses can be dedicated to storage area or more battery space for longer distances.\n\nI'm slowly coming to face reality that EV will be what we drive in the next 10 to 15 years.  So I've been watching and reading on different companies.  I do have a few shares of Lordstown (38 shares -- please stop laughing at the small amount.)\n\nHopefully the remaining test trucks come off the line without a hitch, the testing of them goes off without a hitch, and production starts this fall.\n\n[https://electrek.co/2021/03/31/lordstown-motors-reveals-its-first-two-endurance-betas/](https://electrek.co/2021/03/31/lordstown-motors-reveals-its-first-two-endurance-betas/)",

        "selftext": "I see a lot of people asking about unit splits and determining cost basis after splitting, so I thought it might be helpful to just share a narrative of my recent experience with Fidelity. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***The Request***\n\nOn Monday 3/29/21, I called Fidelity's active trader line and was able to speak with a human within 10 minutes or less.  I told the broker that I wanted to split SPAC units into common shares and warrants for both CPUH and AACU, and he confirmed that Fidelity would submit the split requests to the SPACs.  He also confirmed that it would take 3-5 days to split, although he advised that it could be faster depending on the SPAC.  Once I was on the phone with him the process took maybe 20 minutes, although this likely would have been much quicker if I hadn't called the first morning CPUH was able to be split, as Fidelity was still finalizing the split instructions from CPUH when I called.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***Cost Basis Determination***\n\nI also asked the broker to explain how my new post-split cost basis would be determined.  The broker advised that the unit split is a corporate action and thus Fidelity has no role in determining the post-split cost basis and can only submit the split request to the corporation (the SPAC).  The broker further advised that the SPAC itself actually has fairly wide discretion over determining the new cost basis, as long as they do so within applicable regulatory guidelines (which the broker did not point me to and with which I am not familiar).  In other words, the SPAC gets to divide your original cost basis between the common shares and warrants at their discretion. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***The Result***\n\nAs of this morning, 4/1/21, my AAC units have been split, and my account now shows shares and warrants.  My account shows CPUHU still in the process of splitting.   \n\nFor AAC, the pre/post-split cost basis breaks down as follows:\n\n\\- 1000 AACU original cost basis: $10.60/unit (total: $10,600)  \n\n\\- 1000 AAC common shares: $10.42/share (total: $10,415.88) \n\n\\- 200 AAC warrants: $0.92/warrant (total: $184.12)\n\n\\-------------------\n\nThat's all I've got.

        "selftext": "ETFM FOMO Corp has finally cleared up all previous debt from the old company 2050 Motors. All debt in default has been cleaned up and they are in the free and clear!\n\nIf that doesn't give you hope about what is to come, here is a recap of the information shared during FOMO Hour this week (every Wednesday 5pm eastern:\n\nCharlie Szoradi, CEO of Purge Virus, is pleased to report multiple updates.\n\n\\#1: The disinfection devices have shipped and the installation is now complete for the second and third Pennsylvania senior living condominium community centers. Each location also has hundreds of residential units that we hope will become an additional business.\n\n\\#2: This week, I personally met with the VP of Operations for FASTSIGNS of Exton, PA to demonstrate the multi fan speed and functionality of their new combination disinfection with ionization and ultraviolet light. FASTSIGNS has 700 locations, and we are now waiting on their corporate communications team to approve the recent disinfection promotional video to scale the business opportunity across the US.\n\n\\#3: Our public relations firm Schenck Strategies has been busy at work and scheduled an interview for tomorrow with me and the reporter from Today\u2019s Hotelier Magazine ([https://www.todayshotelier.com/](https://www.todayshotelier.com/)) and another interview is underway with East County Magazine ([www.EastCountyMagazine.org](http://www.eastcountymagazine.org/)). These publications cover national readership as well as a \"niche\" California audience.\n\n\\#4: We are in the final stages of securing the disinfection business for 15 major air handling units within the Philadelphia School District. This comes through working with a leading minority-owned contracting firm, that has had a relationship with Independence LED Lighting over the past few years. (another example of the synergy between the FOMO \"eco-system\" of holding companies).\ud83d\udcf7**5**\ud83d\udcf7**6**\ud83d\udcf7\n\n\\#5: As of March 1, 2021, our new office headquarters will include over 10,000 sq ft of conference areas to expand our ability to ramp up sales and training for indoor air quality and energy efficiency. The Workshop Merchantile (WorkMerk - [https://www.workmerkconshy.com/venue-tour](https://www.workmerkconshy.com/venue-tour)) facility is in Conshohocken, PA, just to the west of Philadelphia. About three years ago, Independence LED provided the lighting upgrade, and here is a highlight of some of the work: [https://youtu.be/vTEPrbiDZNA](https://youtu.be/vTEPrbiDZNA)\n\nRemarks from Vik Grover, CEO:\n\nFOMO CORP. is moving into a new chapter. After completing the purchases of Purge Virus, LLC, Independence LED, and Energy Intelligence Center, we have a foundation for our planned and announced acquisitions of SmartGuard Energy/Lux Solutions, EcoLite LED, and HVAC services contractor. We performed an in-person due diligence meeting with the owners of the first target in Atlanta on Monday of this week and are pleased to report that their businesses are booming and well-positioned to target smart lighting, lighting as a service, energy audits and consultation, and project management. In fact, Lux is now targeting software-driven motor replacements for commercial and industrial buildings to complement their other services, which fits perfectly with our vision for a bundled approach of disinfection, lighting, energy management, and services. It is a potential game-changer as they target large operators.\\*\\*\\*\\[***5:12 PM***\\]***We have reviewed a 35-page draft definitive agreement for both companies and are awaiting changes to them before sending to our counsel. EcoLite is working on their data room and numbers after which time we will light the fuse for their own definitive agreement. Finally, we have sent a team to meet with the HVAC operator and intend to continue on the path towards the acquisition of their already audited results.***\\[***5:13 PM***\\]\\*\\*\\*Regarding the 10-K, the document is completed. That said, we recently hired an outsource CFO firm, BRIO Financial, and SEC counsel, Eilers Law Group, and they need time to review the document. Further, our auditor is preparing his opinion letter. We could have theoretically pressed the button, but there is no reason to do a fire drill. We are growing up in front of your eyes and need to be methodical to avoid errors and amendments. This is a very important document as it demarcates the old entity and the future. There is a lot of information in it.\n\nOn financing, we have friendly relationships with several institutions and family offices and are taking our time to make the right choice. I will not bet the company on any one structure or firm. My goal is to find a team approach for this first round of meaningful financing. Ultimately, EOY or 1Q22, my goal is to move FOMO up to a large exchange and pursue a \u201crights offering\u201d that would allow investors, subject to regulatory and legal, to participate.\n\nI don't know about you, but I am more convinced than ever that FOMO Corp is rolling full steam ahead and its only the beginning of what's to come. More definitive agreements, ticker change over and updated name on brokers pages are going to be the cherry on top.\n\nHere is a link to all the social media outlets our social media rep Andrea is keeping updated so any potential or current shareholder has the most up-to-date info!

As you know, the spreads can be ridiculously large (sometimes more than 20%).\n\n\nI recently discovered that when doing a poor man's covered call (pmcc) and it gets assigned, rather than selling the call, my brokerage places  100 short sale stocks per contract into my portfolio and lets me keep the call.\n\nThe spread to buy to cover short stocks seems far less than the call option.\n\nIf I have a LEAP call that I no longer wish to hold, is it materially different to sell the call with a 20% spread loss or do a pmcc and have the call assigned and keep the long call with the shorted shorted shares? It seems like the latter is the same as liquidating but with no spread loss, plus I earn a premium from writing the call option in the pmcc.",

        "selftext": "Take it from someone who started investing this year and made mistakes and loss money. \n\nYou need to decide what your goals are and how high of a risk you wanna take. Do you want to follow stocks and ETFs that you have to actively manage and attempt to beat the market with or do you wanna put your money in weekly or monthly and watch it grow without having to do constant research? Note- while i consider VTI/ the boglehead method pretty low risk and care free one should still keep up with the market to know whats going on.\n\n1. Open webull \n\n2. Deposit any money you are ready to invest into VTI (US total market etf) until you know what your official investmsnt plan is and have adjusted that a few times. Mine has changed a lot. VTI is a relatively \"safe\" yet great returning etf. \n\n3. Go to the \"paper trading\" section of webull and start looking at stocks. Use these different sub reddits like stocks, stockmarket, etfs and boglehead to do research (note- other brokerages use paper trading but its what i used so its why i said webull). \n\n3a. Learn about what TRUE DD is. Not what W S B tells you. Yes some people here and other forums occasionally post solid DD but you need to know what EPS, PE, BVPS, ROE, Debt, etc. All mean and why they are important. Specifically PE is something ive learned to assess. Webull has some pretty great charts where you can look at the different EMAs. Until you know all of these things and know what the company actually does and how they make money/ will in the future the stock stays in your trading account. \n\n4. Find a stock you like. Add it to your paper trading account and watch it for 3-6 months. \n\n5. Assess it again. Did it drop? Why? Did it run up like crazy? Why? Find out why. Learn how to assess these movements.\n\n6. If and only if 3-6  months later you feel like this stock is a winner then move it to your actual trading account and buy in. (For those of you saying well thats 6 months of gains i just missed. No you are getting VTI gains plus if the stocks solid now itll be solid again in 6 months right? The goals a solid return not day trading 200% gains).\n\nPRO TIPS-\n\n-DO NOT FOMO SELL OR BUY STOCKS. I can not emphasize this enough. Ive bought in where things are gaining 5%/ hour and guess what? The stock within a week dropped back down to \"fill the gaps.\" I never believed that was a thing but ive watched it happen way too many times. About 99% of the time a stock i watchlisted shot up if i got it while going up within a  week it temporarily dropped back before rising again. \n\n-Do yourself a favor and avoid Wall s t r e e t b e t s \n\n-Never invest any money you arent willing to lose today. If you need the money soon (within a year in my opinion) and will need that full amount do not invest it. The market especially now is unpredictable. A lot of people lost a lot of money these last 2 months that they will either never get back or will be holding the bag they call it for years. \n\n- Contrary to popular belief... its okay to sell for a loss. This is a hard lesson and one many people will give you a hard time on saying \"BuY hIgH sElL lOw.\" Guess what? Sometimes we pick bad stocks/ etfs. Especially when you are new you will think you found the gold mind of a stock only for it to get bad news like the trial drug didnt get approved or they delayed production or loss a contract bid. Would you rather be down 20% and perhaps watch it keep going down more and hold that stock for years perhaps before it comes back up or would you rather accept the loss (which youll claim on taxes) and then reinvest in a solid company/ etf that will make that loss back faster. Of course this correction we were just in is an expection in someways because some companies will bounce back relatively quick but i forsee that there will be many people that bought in at all time highs who wont see a profit for a very long time. \n\n- In the same respect above you have to have discipline. Stocks dont only go up. You WILL have down days. Youll temporarily be in the red. This will be the pucker moment you decide if you regret buying that position or not. Be disciplined. \n\n-The same goes for being on top. There is absolutely nothing wrong with taking profits if your stock happens to have a huge run up (knowing youll pay capital gains tax though). \n\n- DO NOT USE MARGIN ACCOUNTS \n\n- Avoid option trading for at least a year till you understand what you are doing and can pick good stocks to buy options for. You can lose so much money so fast. \n\n- these subs can be amazing and they can be toxic. Some people give great advice and others dont. Whatever someone tells you dont take it as fact. They may tell you that AMD will double in 6 months buy buy buy. But its your money not theirs you could lose. \n\n- CNBC gets a lot of hate but Squak box, fast money and mad money on Spotify or watching it live has some really good insight to the market. But again they dont always give great advice. \n\n- you have to decide what your plan is and what stocks/ etfs/ risk fits your life style and plan. \n\n- people are scared of dividends for no reason. Unless you are investing millions upon millions of dollars ignoring solid stocks and ETFs which pay dividends to \"avoid unnecessary tax events\" is silly. If you dont believe me look at an ETF like SCHD. calculate the max amount youll ever get in that account. Divide by shares and multiply by dividend rate. Its not that much in end that you pay taxes on.\n\n- as much as we all wanna make 200% every month on every stock thats so unbelievably unrealistic. Look at some of the biggest ETFs like VT, VTI, SCHA, SCHB, VXUS, etc. And see their YOY returns. That your goal.\n\n\nMy advice/ quick tid bit/ plan\n\nI attempted to beat the market. I fomo'd into stocks and got burnt and loss money. I bought stocks at ATh cause every said stocks only go up. Thankfully my losses are minimal since i invested minimally my first year but i learned some hard lessons. I got humbled quick and ive realized i cant beat the market, i don't have the skill or time to do proper DD and watch the stocks 24/7 to assess whats happening and id rather park my money in a few ETFs and let it grow. Im not gonna gain 300% in a year but if i can gain 5-10% in a year it beats the heck outta what a savings account could ever give me.\n\nMy current 5 fund boglehead portfolio spin off... (which i plan to hold for a year before i rebalance... with the exception of increasing SCHD/ VXUS quicker than that and decreasing VTI to compensate). \n\nVTI- 70% \n\nVXUS- 10%\n\nSCHD- 10% \n\nQQQM- 7.5:\n\nQQQJ- 7.5%\n\nGood luck!",

        "selftext": "I'm not trying to rant about why this is philosophically the case. Yes, maybe we should tax all capital gains at the same rate that income taxes are taxed. What I mean by this question is why, mechanically, wealthy investors get to buy and sell stocks and call it \"capital gains\" and have it taxed at 15% while all of my day trading gains get added into my taxable income and I end up paying 24% on it. Is there some certain way to buy and sell stocks that allows it to be called capital gains? Do you have to hold a certain dollar value? Or hold them for a certain length of time before selling? Is there any way that a middle class investor could pay the 15% rate on his returns if he were organizing his portfolio better?",

        "selftext": "\n\nBlink Charging is a small cap American EV charging provider with a value of 1.45 billion. It has been rallying from a around $1 dollar to a yearly high of $64.00 but in the last couple months has dropped in value by almost half to $34.00 due to a rising short interest amongst hedge funds to around 41% making it one of the most heavily shorted stocks on the Nasdaq right now. Not sure what hedge funds are short but I feel there are a few reasons for this.\n\nThe main reason for this is that there are a number of other competitors that are making inroads in the market and that Blink is relatively small amount of market share at 8% at current. Chargepoint is the largest in the market. Although I feel that that what the hedge funds have overlooked is that there should be room for loads of companys in the EV charging industry. The sheer rate of growth in the EV market has driven this company up 1200% and that has potential to keep going. Blink has implemented a total of 15,760 charging stations and Apple has added all these stations to its Apple Maps which is massive for the company. We also should not underestimate the radical change to the global economy where clean energy is going to overtake traditional fossil fuels. America has a target I believe of 2035 for the phase out of fossil fuel transport while most of Europe has pledged to transform its economy to be carbon neutral by 2030 with EVs playing a major part in that shift. This indicates that there is huge upside for the company in the coming years.\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c\n\nBelow I have highlighted a few of the fundamentals that are interesting and may look familar here including the current short interest (42%) and the current float 32 million. Thats around 20 million LESS than GME currently. \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c\n\nAlso I checked on iborrowdesk where there is currently 45,000 shorts available very similar to GME at the moment although the borrow fee can be as high as 80%?? \n\nHere is where I got these numbers from if people want to expand on this.\n\nhttps://www.highshortinterest.com/ \n\nhttps://iborrowdesk.com/report/CCGID\n\nHowever I do think that there is reason to claim the stock is undervalued regardless of what the squeeze potential may be if that sanario was to play out. What do you guys think I'm not a stock wizard by any means I'm just an Ape like you \ud83e\udda7\ud83e\udda7 all so it would be interesting to get your opinions. \ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\udc8e",

        "selftext": "Take it from someone who started investing this year and made mistakes and loss money. \n\nYou need to decide what your goals are and how high of a risk you wanna take. Do you want to follow stocks and ETFs that you have to actively manage and attempt to beat the market with or do you wanna put your money in weekly or monthly and watch it grow without having to do constant research? Note- while i consider VTI/ the boglehead method pretty low risk and care free one should still keep up with the market to know whats going on.\n\n1. Open webull \n\n2. Deposit any money you are ready to invest into VTI (US total market etf) until you know what your official investmsnt plan is and have adjusted that a few times. Mine has changed a lot. VTI is a relatively \"safe\" yet great returning etf. \n\n3. Go to the \"paper trading\" section of webull and start looking at stocks. Use these different sub reddits like stocks, stockmarket, etfs and boglehead to do research (note- other brokerages use paper trading but its what i used so its why i said webull). \n\n3a. Learn about what TRUE DD is. Not what W S B tells you. Yes some people here and other forums occasionally post solid DD but you need to know what EPS, PE, BVPS, ROE, Debt, etc. All mean and why they are important. Specifically PE is something ive learned to assess. Webull has some pretty great charts where you can look at the different EMAs. Until you know all of these things and know what the company actually does and how they make money/ will in the future the stock stays in your trading account. \n\n4. Find a stock you like. Add it to your paper trading account and watch it for 3-6 months. \n\n5. Assess it again. Did it drop? Why? Did it run up like crazy? Why? Find out why. Learn how to assess these movements.\n\n6. If and only if 3-6  months later you feel like this stock is a winner then move it to your actual trading account and buy in. (For those of you saying well thats 6 months of gains i just missed. No you are getting VTI gains plus if the stocks solid now itll be solid again in 6 months right? The goals a solid return not day trading 200% gains).\n\nPRO TIPS-\n\n-DO NOT FOMO SELL OR BUY STOCKS. I can not emphasize this enough. Ive bought in where things are gaining 5%/ hour and guess what? The stock within a week dropped back down to \"fill the gaps.\" I never believed that was a thing but ive watched it happen way too many times. About 99% of the time a stock i watchlisted shot up if i got it while going up within a  week it temporarily dropped back before rising again. \n\n-Do yourself a favor and avoid Wall s t r e e t b e t s \n\n-Never invest any money you arent willing to lose today. If you need the money soon (within a year in my opinion) and will need that full amount do not invest it. The market especially now is unpredictable. A lot of people lost a lot of money these last 2 months that they will either never get back or will be holding the bag they call it for years. \n\n- Contrary to popular belief... its okay to sell for a loss. This is a hard lesson and one many people will give you a hard time on saying \"BuY hIgH sElL lOw.\" Guess what? Sometimes we pick bad stocks/ etfs. Especially when you are new you will think you found the gold mind of a stock only for it to get bad news like the trial drug didnt get approved or they delayed production or loss a contract bid. Would you rather be down 20% and perhaps watch it keep going down more and hold that stock for years perhaps before it comes back up or would you rather accept the loss (which youll claim on taxes) and then reinvest in a solid company/ etf that will make that loss back faster. Of course this correction we were just in is an expection in someways because some companies will bounce back relatively quick but i forsee that there will be many people that bought in at all time highs who wont see a profit for a very long time. \n\n- In the same respect above you have to have discipline. Stocks dont only go up. You WILL have down days. Youll temporarily be in the red. This will be the pucker moment you decide if you regret buying that position or not. Be disciplined. \n\n-The same goes for being on top. There is absolutely nothing wrong with taking profits if your stock happens to have a huge run up (knowing youll pay capital gains tax though). \n\n- DO NOT USE MARGIN ACCOUNTS \n\n- Avoid option trading for at least a year till you understand what you are doing and can pick good stocks to buy options for. You can lose so much money so fast. \n\n- these subs can be amazing and they can be toxic. Some people give great advice and others dont. Whatever someone tells you dont take it as fact. They may tell you that AMD will double in 6 months buy buy buy. But its your money not theirs you could lose. \n\n- CNBC gets a lot of hate but Squak box, fast money and mad money on Spotify or watching it live has some really good insight to the market. But again they dont always give great advice. \n\n- you have to decide what your plan is and what stocks/ etfs/ risk fits your life style and plan. \n\n- people are scared of dividends for no reason. Unless you are investing millions upon millions of dollars ignoring solid stocks and ETFs which pay dividends to \"avoid unnecessary tax events\" is silly. If you dont believe me look at an ETF like SCHD. calculate the max amount youll ever get in that account. Divide by shares and multiply by dividend rate. Its not that much in end that you pay taxes on.\n\n- as much as we all wanna make 200% every month on every stock thats so unbelievably unrealistic. Look at some of the biggest ETFs like VT, VTI, SCHA, SCHB, VXUS, etc. And see their YOY returns. That your goal.\n\n\nMy advice/ quick tid bit/ plan\n\nI attempted to beat the market. I fomo'd into stocks and got burnt and loss money. I bought stocks at ATh cause every said stocks only go up. Thankfully my losses are minimal since i invested minimally my first year but i learned some hard lessons. I got humbled quick and ive realized i cant beat the market, i don't have the skill or time to do proper DD and watch the stocks 24/7 to assess whats happening and id rather park my money in a few ETFs and let it grow. Im not gonna gain 300% in a year but if i can gain 5-10% in a year it beats the heck outta what a savings account could ever give me.\n\nMy current 5 fund boglehead portfolio spin off... (which i plan to hold for a year before i rebalance... with the exception of increasing SCHD/ VXUS quicker than that and decreasing VTI to compensate). \n\nVTI- 70% \n\nVXUS- 10%\n\nSCHD- 10% \n\nQQQM- 7.5:\n\nQQQJ- 7.5%\n\nGood luck!",

        "selftext": " This latest installment of why $DGX is **still** the safest double up+ opportunity in the market will likely be my last update before earnings this month (baring eventful news). A lot of this will be regurgitation from Parts 1 and 2 because, well, most of what was discussed has been coming to fruition:\n\n[$DGX DD Pt. 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lktkjr/dgx_quest_diagnostics_is_free_tendies/)\n\n[$DGX DD Pt. 2 - Electric Boogaloo](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m2dtqk/dgx_quest_diagnostics_pt_2_electric_boogaloo/)\n\n**TL;DR again** \\- $DGX is now over 8% higher since DD Pt. 2 earlier this month. The stock and associated calls are still trading at very reasonable amounts, continuing to make $DGX the safest double up+ play in the market. **During their Investor Day earlier in March, they doubled both LT Revenue and EPS CAGR guidance. They also confirmed they will be repurchasing $900 MILLION in shares in the FIRST HALF of this year. This will reduce their float by over 5%.** That is material. Now consider 90% of float is owned by institutions. Then add in all EPS guidance given for Q1 and Q2 does NOT factor in repurchases. Blah blah blah ROCKETS.\n\n**Positions** \\- I've given my positions every single time, yet some smucks demanded a screenshot. Why how much $ I have in these positions matters is beyond me. Either I tickled your balls enough during the DDs to invest or I didn't. Anyway, here's a **consolidated** view (100% options), which is drastically understated ($10k+ both gains and total value) because Ally's platform has become unreliable hot garbage:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kspcic1dqjq61.jpg?width=3480&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=05521960a236201679bbda237f3fb5997ad5270a\n\nOpen: May 21 $125, $130, $135. Aug 20 $120, $125, $130, $140, $145, $150, $160\n\nAs previously mentioned, I also have another $50k stock and a small amount of options in my other account with TD. I will be moving all of my holdings to TD eventually because Ally has become completely broken over the past year and their customer service is non existent. **Just a PSA to AVOID ALLY.**\n\n**The new stuff:**\n\n* Most important - March Investor Day LT Revenue and Earnings CAGR increase and MASSIVE share repurchase timing: [**https://finance.yahoo.com/news/quest-diagnostics-updates-strategic-growth-114500393.html**](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/quest-diagnostics-updates-strategic-growth-114500393.html)  \n\n   * This improved LT outlook has yet to be reflected in any new \"analyst\" price targets\n* Acquired Mercy's outreach lab services. Like I said, they will be using their piles of $$$ to make acquisitions. Especially as smaller labs run out of runway as the pandemic slows down. [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/quest-diagnostics-mercy-broaden-access-140700481.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/quest-diagnostics-mercy-broaden-access-140700481.html)\n* Struck deal with Zora Biosciences' to further efforts to enhance direct to consumer self testing offerings. A key growth focus for them is self testing of all kinds in the future: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/zora-biosciences-licenses-ceramide-technology-130400471.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/zora-biosciences-licenses-ceramide-technology-130400471.html)  \n\n   * [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-11/quest-sees-direct-to-consumer-testing-taking-off-post-pandemic](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-11/quest-sees-direct-to-consumer-testing-taking-off-post-pandemic)\n* As previously noted in earlier DDs, analysts were drastically overestimating the Q1 drop off in COVID testing expected. Public data shows daily testing remains absurdly high. In fact, the lowest testing day so far in Q1 is still higher than the highest day from May-Oct 2020. The overall Q1 daily average remains over DOUBLE that period as well. Heck, even Quest's own press release indicates COVID testing remains absurdly high through March (Q1) for them specifically: [https://newsroom.questdiagnostics.com/COVIDTestingUpdates](https://newsroom.questdiagnostics.com/COVIDTestingUpdates)\n* On top of the $50billion in stimulus, $DGX will also be a primary provider of testing services upon school re-openings: [https://www.rockefellerfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/K-12-NTAP.pdf](https://www.rockefellerfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/K-12-NTAP.pdf)\n\n**Some important stuff from the previous DDs because God knows you still didn't click the links above:**\n\n* Based on management's own conservative EPS forecasts (**excl repurchases**), a PE of 10 at mid year results in a share price of $144. This is the absolute floor target. They also announced unprecedented $2b in share repurchases for 2021, meaning they can repurchase over 16m shares at current levels. Their float is 133m shares, **BUT roughly 90% of that is owned by INSTITUIONS, leaving LESS THAN 16m** ***available*** **to public.** Assuming institutions continue to hold the majority of their shares (they will. it's a safe dividend stock), this stock will rocket by end of year.  \n\n   * I have always expected a Q1 diluted EPS &gt; 4. I am currently projecting 4.2, which results in a TTM EPS of 14. Further, I anticipate roughly $3 EPS as the Q2 floor, resulting in a TTM EPS post Q2 of 15.63.\n   * This results in an EPS 20% above the high amount given in guidance, which again, was conservative and didn't account for share repurchases\n\nThe reason this stock constantly runs up into earnings and then ticks lower despite large beats is solely due to their base testing lagging behind typical performance due to COVID. The market is acting as if the COVID faucet will just get shut off in the snap of a finger (soon) and then the base testing will take time to return. Does this sound right to you? **This line of thinking is laughably absurd and na\u00efve.** Reasons:\n\n* After a year of this shit, there is a massive backlog of people/procedures that will be completed after more of the pop is vaccinated. We haven't even seen a DGX Q performance with strong base testing AND COVID $$$ yet. Q1 of 2021 will be the first. Book it.\n* **Political climate / stimulus** \\- I'm sure you all saw the CDC is now \"recommending\" double masking. Hell, I've passed out four times writing this diatribe due to the 6 masks I'm wearing. Why does this matter? For every bit a person feels the previous admin downplayed COVID, the new admin is going 100% the opposite direction. Considering the US is going to continue to pump trillions into the economy, you can bet your ass all testing companies will benefit. There will definitely be huge grants/subsidies for enhanced serology procedures and research....and of course in analyzing COVID further. These testing companies have so much COVID data that will continue to be poured over as the pandemic lessens. You can also bet there will be an increased $ focus on scanning/checking for new viruses in the near future.\n* **$$$$$$$** \\- Do you think DGX is just going to light the enormous $$$ they've made over the past 9 months and will continue to make for 2021 on fire? Because that's what the current stock price/growth reflects. When in reality and in addition to the buybacks, they will be targeting acquisitions and investing heavily in serology capabilities/analysis and self testing expansion.\n\n**Price Expectations by EOY:**\n\n* Worst case - $150. Yea, I'm serious. Baring a market meltdown driven by Biden's tax policy, this baby is a lock.\n* Best case - $200\n\n**Important Dates:**\n\n* Ex-Dividend date this FRIDAY 4/2\n* Q1 Earnings 4/22\n\n**Disclaimer:** I'm a rando on a message board, yada yada yada, not investment advice. Ally SUCKS as a brokerage. Use someone else. Long live GME.",

They manufacture tools and accessories for profesionals and DIYers, like knee pads, saw horses, belts and pouches to store your tools, etc. They've been expanding to Canada, Europe and UK. They've been managing their debt quite well, particularly reduced it in 2020.\n\nMonday, they announced they [fiscal year 2020 results](https://ir.toughbuilt.com/press-releases/detail/79/toughbuilt-industries-announces-fiscal-2020-results) which are, in my humble opinion, quite outstanding. Revenue grew 106% from 2019 and gross profit increased by 160%. Despite this, the stock dipped from $1.15 to $0.85 bringing the market cap to $69M, about 2x their 2020 revenue, which is still low IMO when you compare to other companies.\n\nI think they have tremendous potential for expanding their product lines.\n\nCheers and happy trading !",

        "selftext": "TORONTO, April 1, 2021 /PRNewswire/ - Denison Mines Corp. (\"Denison\" or the \"Company\") (TSX: DML) (NYSE American: DNN) is pleased to announce that it has successfully secured 2.5 million pounds of uranium concentrates (\"Uranium\" or \"U(3)O(8)\"), at a weighted average price of USD$29.61 per pound U(3)O(8) and a total cost of approximately USD$74 million, as part of its previously announced project financing initiative in support of the future advancement and/or construction of the Company's flagship 90% owned Wheeler River Uranium Project (\"Wheeler River\" or the \"Project\"). All purchases were made in the uranium spot market, with delivery dates ranging from April 2021 to October 2021. View PDF version (https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3116340-1&amp;h=59099390&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fmma.prnewswire.com%2Fmedia%2F1479275%2FDenison_Mines_Corp__PDF_2.pdf&amp;a=View+PDF+version) .\n\nThe purchased Uranium is expected to strengthen the Company's balance sheet and enhance its ability to access future project financing, with the potential collateralization of the Uranium holdings. In addition, the purchased Uranium could provide the Company with increased flexibility to negotiate long-term Uranium supply arrangements with future customers. If a future decision is made to advance Wheeler River into construction, the Company could eventually market its physical Uranium investments to its future customers along with the mine production from Wheeler River.\n\nDavid Cates, President and CEO of Denison, commented, \"We're pleased with the result of our recent uranium procurement process \u2013 having secured a significant quantity of material, to meet our target of 2.5 million pounds U(3)O(8), at an average price of USD$29.61 per pound. This material was secured amidst a tightening market, which has seen the spot price of uranium rise approximately 15% within the month of March, in response to various new sources of demand.\n\nUpon completion of our various commitments, Denison's physical uranium holdings will represent a sizeable asset for the Company, with a current market value of approximately USD$78 million (CAD$98 million), which represents greater than one-third of the expected CAD$290 million (Denison's share, from the 2018 Pre-Feasibility Study) of initial capital costs for Wheeler River. This investment in Uranium enhances the long-term financial stability of the company, as we advance towards a definitive development decision for the Project. More specifically, the Company's Uranium holdings have the potential to de-risk the process of future project financing efforts by representing a meaningful source of collateral. Similarly, we expect that our future customers will value, as part of potential future discussions regarding off-take or long-term contracting arrangements, the fact that our Company will already have an established base of physical Uranium before achieving first production from Wheeler River.\"",

        "selftext": " Regardless of your opinion on Wish's products, shipping times etc., $15-16 (ticker price right now) for an ecommerce marketplace consistently in the top 10 in the app store + with billions in revenue is a steal. Wish is a baby, and if it follows the trajectory of marketplaces like Aliexpress, Amazon etc., people are gonna look back on this price like it was a joke.\n\nI'm also saying this as a merchant on the Wish marketplace making a substantial amount of money - they're making **BIG** changes to try and improve delivery times + quality assurance. For example, they recently launched 2 programs:\n\n1. **Wish Express** (like amazon prime)\n2. **Warehouses** \\- they are building warehouses in China to collect orders and ship them out first class to international customers. They're focusing HEAVILY on the US, but they also have a huge amount of buyers from low income areas like Brazil, Chile, Lithuania etc.\n3. They're pushing merchants to meet a **15 day shipping time** (and they're doing it via fines if you don't meet that threshold). This addresses one of the biggest complaints about Wish for US customers - slow shipping b/c most merchants are selling / dropshipping from China. Although other countries (brazil, chile etc.) don't complain about longer shipping times because they haven't been exposed to Amazon Prime like the West, this improves experience for US customers.\n\nThey've also gone on an engineering spree, revamping everything about the merchant backend. \n\nEven though they've gone down since IPO, I still think this is a great bet (I mainly say this as a seller). I put in a bunch in there and I expect it to go up. Either through growth or if they get acquired by a larger company (e.g. Amazon).",

Long story short - we need a more efficient method.\n\nEnter lab meat/fish. Here they produce meat with the help of cells and media in bio reactors, the same ones used for the fermentation of yeast. Same product but less of the downsides of traditional meat and fish:\n- Shorter production time\n- More cost efficient in the future (rough estimate says 2030)\n- no animals are harmed (unless you count the minimal itch it takes to get some cells)\n- one cow = tons of meat (all they need is cells from it)\n- can be produced in a factory, does not need land \n- way smaller CO2 footprint\n- better food quality, no friggin hormones everywhere\n- potentially to be consumed by vegetarians and vegans too (vegans questionable I know)\n\nOne of the most promising companies currently is BlueNalu (https://www.bluenalu.com/) aiming for production later this year. Now almost none of the companies are publicly traded at the moment, but I found a good vehicle to get access: Agronomics\nhttps://agronomics.im/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Agronomics-Corporate-Presentation-.pdf\n\nIf you are interested, I recommend reading the book \"Moo's Law\" by one of the founders, Jim Mellon. Overall extremely interesting new sector and also one that hits the nerve of the current society I think (everyone is becoming more environmentally aware).",

This is a one of a kind DD where the whole DD is basically a TLDR. \n\nIf you want to do a deep dive on $ROOT, yesterday u/faisall1 posted a good DD on $ROOT. [Link to DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mhcq0v/root_the_next_moon_landing/)\n\n1- It has a rare Short interest of 47.36% Float as of 03/31/2021(Fintel). In addition, only 75,000 are available for shorting(2021-04-01 11:33:46.728 UTC). To put things into perspective, If there's a short interest of %10, that's considered high. If there's a short interest of %20 or greater, **that's considered extremely high**. We have 47.36%!!! so a **short squeeze** is inevitable? \n\n **In comparison, as of 03/31/2021, $GME has a short interest of 18.81%, $AMC 17.31%!!! %ROOT is sitting on 47.36%(FINTEL).**\n\n2-  Forget about the short squeeze... It also has a potential of **gamma squeezing**. The open interest of calls is high above 15$ relative to Float. Once it hits and stays above $15, the **gamma squeeze** could take it to a whole **new solar system**. \n\n3- $ROOT is massively undervalued, **without factoring in the Gamma and Short squeeze potential(especially with low float and low valuation 3.2B reminds me of early days of $GME)**, at $LMND multiple **$ROOT would trade at $65** and if ROOT is successful in capturing 2% of the $266 billion US auto insurance market then just the insurance side is worth **10x(120$).**\n\nBUT... instead of doing Voodoo math, **there is no reason this stock is worth less than its IPO price of $27.**  This is at the cross hairs of disruptive technology that is too strong to ignore.\n\n4- For 2021 Growth Potential, There is an acceleration in ROOT daily and weekly app downloads which started in February based on a leading 3rdparty app data(App Annie)(Illustrated in the chart in u/faisall1's post). The downloads of $Root surpass $LMND which is currently more valuated than $ROOT.\n\n**My Short term Price target is 50$+ if a Gamma and Short squeeze fully happen.**",

        "selftext": " This latest installment of why $DGX is **still** the safest double up+ opportunity in the market will likely be my last update before earnings this month (baring eventful news). A lot of this will be regurgitation from Parts 1 and 2 because, well, most of what was discussed has been coming to fruition:\n\n[$DGX DD Pt. 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lktkjr/dgx_quest_diagnostics_is_free_tendies/)\n\n[$DGX DD Pt. 2 - Electric Boogaloo](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m2dtqk/dgx_quest_diagnostics_pt_2_electric_boogaloo/)\n\n**TL;DR again** \\- $DGX is now over 8% higher since DD Pt. 2 earlier this month. The stock and associated calls are still trading at very reasonable amounts, continuing to make $DGX the safest double up+ play in the market. **During their Investor Day earlier in March, they doubled both LT Revenue and EPS CAGR guidance. They also confirmed they will be repurchasing $900 MILLION in shares in the FIRST HALF of this year. This will reduce their float by over 5%.** That is material. Now consider 90% of float is owned by institutions. Then add in all EPS guidance given for Q1 and Q2 does NOT factor in repurchases. Blah blah blah ROCKETS.\n\n**Positions** \\- I've given my positions every single time, yet some smucks demanded a screenshot. Why how much $ I have in these positions matters is beyond me. Either I tickled your balls enough during the DDs to invest or I didn't. Anyway, here's a **consolidated** view (100% options), which is drastically understated ($10k+ both gains and total value) because Ally's platform has become unreliable hot garbage:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/81zhulcnujq61.jpg?width=3480&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b73da97030189fb81852b2c62f04ccceb8376c4a\n\nOpen: May 21 $125, $130, $135. Aug 20 $120, $125, $130, $140, $145, $150, $160\n\nAs previously mentioned, I also have another $50k stock and a small amount of options in my other account with TD. I will be moving all of my holdings to TD eventually because Ally has become completely broken over the past year and their customer service is non existent. **Just a PSA to AVOID ALLY.**\n\n**The new stuff:**\n\n* Most important - March Investor Day LT Revenue and Earnings CAGR increase and MASSIVE share repurchase timing\n   * This improved LT outlook has yet to be reflected in any new \"analyst\" price targets\n* Acquired Mercy's outreach lab services. Like I said, they will be using their piles of $$$ to make acquisitions. Especially as smaller labs run out of runway as the pandemic slows down.\n* Struck deal with Zora Biosciences' to further efforts to enhance direct to consumer self testing offerings. A key growth focus for them is self testing of all kinds in the future. **Removed article links in an effort to actually get this damn thing posted.**\n* As previously noted in earlier DDs, analysts were drastically overestimating the Q1 drop off in COVID testing expected. Public data shows daily testing remains absurdly high. In fact, the lowest testing day so far in Q1 is still higher than the highest day from May-Oct 2020. The overall Q1 daily average remains over DOUBLE that period as well. Heck, even Quest's own press release indicates COVID testing remains absurdly high through March (Q1) for them specifically: [https://newsroom.questdiagnostics.com/COVIDTestingUpdates](https://newsroom.questdiagnostics.com/COVIDTestingUpdates)\n* On top of the $50billion in stimulus, $DGX will also be a primary provider of testing services upon school re-openings\n\n**Some important stuff from the previous DDs because God knows you still didn't click the links above:**\n\n* Based on management's own conservative EPS forecasts (**excl repurchases**), a PE of 10 at mid year results in a share price of $144. This is the absolute floor target. They also announced unprecedented $2b in share repurchases for 2021, meaning they can repurchase over 16m shares at current levels. Their float is 133m shares, **BUT roughly 90% of that is owned by INSTITUIONS, leaving LESS THAN 16m** ***available*** **to public.** Assuming institutions continue to hold the majority of their shares (they will. it's a safe dividend stock), this stock will rocket by end of year.\n   * I have always expected a Q1 diluted EPS &gt; 4. I am currently projecting 4.2, which results in a TTM EPS of 14. Further, I anticipate roughly $3 EPS as the Q2 floor, resulting in a TTM EPS post Q2 of 15.63.\n   * This results in an EPS 20% above the high amount given in guidance, which again, was conservative and didn't account for share repurchases\n\nThe reason this stock constantly runs up into earnings and then ticks lower despite large beats is solely due to their base testing lagging behind typical performance due to COVID. The market is acting as if the COVID faucet will just get shut off in the snap of a finger (soon) and then the base testing will take time to return. Does this sound right to you? **This line of thinking is laughably absurd and na\u00efve.** Reasons:\n\n* After a year of this shit, there is a massive backlog of people/procedures that will be completed after more of the pop is vaccinated. We haven't even seen a DGX Q performance with strong base testing AND COVID $$$ yet. Q1 of 2021 will be the first. Book it.\n* **Political climate / stimulus** \\- I'm sure you all saw the CDC is now \"recommending\" double masking. Hell, I've passed out four times writing this diatribe due to the 6 masks I'm wearing. Why does this matter? For every bit a person feels the previous admin downplayed COVID, the new admin is going 100% the opposite direction. Considering the US is going to continue to pump trillions into the economy, you can bet your ass all testing companies will benefit. There will definitely be huge grants/subsidies for enhanced serology procedures and research....and of course in analyzing COVID further. These testing companies have so much COVID data that will continue to be poured over as the pandemic lessens. You can also bet there will be an increased $ focus on scanning/checking for new viruses in the near future.\n* **$$$$$$$** \\- Do you think DGX is just going to light the enormous $$$ they've made over the past 9 months and will continue to make for 2021 on fire? Because that's what the current stock price/growth reflects. When in reality and in addition to the buybacks, they will be targeting acquisitions and investing heavily in serology capabilities/analysis and self testing expansion.\n\n**Price Expectations by EOY:**\n\n* Worst case - $150. Yea, I'm serious. Baring a market meltdown driven by tax policy changes, this baby is a lock.\n* Best case - $200\n\n**Important Dates:**\n\n* Ex-Dividend date this FRIDAY 4/2\n* Q1 Earnings 4/22\n\n**Disclaimer:** I'm a rando on a message board, yada yada yada, not investment advice. Ally SUCKS as a brokerage. Use someone else. Long live GME.",

Or how does that work, the profit is pretty insane if they do sell back to the market, so if it is relatively safe why not yolo?

        "selftext": "Hi y'all,\n\nSo I have been investing only since December of last year. When I came in it was a bull market and that's all I've known. I felt great cause I could invest in anything and it seemed to just go up. After eating shit a few times I began doing way more personal DD and have continued to yield fair results.\n\n\nWhat I am curious about is the bear market. Obviously no one can guarantee making money in any market, but I'd like to know from longer active investors how you handle a bear market? How do I know when I'm in a bear market? I would appreciate some heads up on what to expect and friendly recommendations on how to work through it without losing everything.\n\n\nI will continue to read in google as well but human feedback is always greatly appreciated. In return for people's help I will pull S&amp;P Market Intelligence articles for those that take the time to respond!\n\n\nThanks everyone and good luck.",

        "selftext": "This post will detail some speculation on why believe Bitcoin will soon break 60k and potentially move to 70k within the next month or two. I'm fairly confident the bull run for Bitcoin is not over yet and will continue into this year before we see a correction.\n\n\\-Current Price of BTC around time of this post is around 58k-\n\n**External Catalysts**\n\nThe past few weeks there have been an onslaught of positive news for BTC . To name a few major ones:\n\n\\- Paypal is now incorporating use and everyday people can exchange BTC and other cryptocurrency.\n\n\\- Square, Tesla, and several other companies have included it in their balance sheet. Microstrategy essentially embraced their whole mission around it. Overstock accepts BTC as payment.\n\n\\- Spending will be high with the stimulus package and other bills under Democrats. BTC can be seen as a hedge to the dollar\n\n\\- Visa and other credit cards have also started incorporating it.\n\n*More importantly, there are major catalysts that will be coming this April that will likely propel it forward more:*\n\n\\- BTC ETFs are already being submitted by major institutions like Fidelity. When the GOLD ETF was introduced, the value of gold went on bull run the year to follow.\n\n\\- Coinbase IPO will be happening in April if there are no more delays. This one is **major**! Just the event will get the talk of cryptocurrency spread and be the chatter of the month.\n\n\\- Literally today Chipotle is getting in on the fun too with their Burrito or Bitcoin event: [https://newsroom.chipotle.com/2021-03-30-Burritos-Or-Bitcoin-Chipotle-To-Give-Away-200k-In-Free-Burritos-And-Bitcoin-To-Celebrate-National-Burrito-Day](https://newsroom.chipotle.com/2021-03-30-Burritos-Or-Bitcoin-Chipotle-To-Give-Away-200k-In-Free-Burritos-And-Bitcoin-To-Celebrate-National-Burrito-Day)\n\n**Technical Analysis:**\n\nBTC this week reached almost 60k three times this week.\n\nKey levels of Resistance: 60k, 64.5k\n\nKey levels of Support: 53k, 51k\n\nSettling at 58k is very bullish at it means it is bouncing *above* the 9-day and 21-day moving averages. If it's able to hold this it should be able to get to around 62k. If it passes the mental wall there, it can easily surge to 70k before correcting. If it fails to support 55k then we could see a downside\n\n**Tickers that follow Bit Coin: $MARA, $RIOT, $CAN**\n\nI chose three tickers to focus on that will likely benefit from a rally. I know there are other ones like SOS, BTBT, FTFT but those are high risk from what I've seen having short reports written up on them. And when Bitcoin goes down, they go down hard. Let me know if there are any new tickers that follow Bitcoin too.\n\n**MARA**\n\n\\- Bitcoin mining company I've been following since it was 5$. Has strong support\n\n\\- Recent News: To Launch the First North American-Based Bitcoin Mining Pool.\n\n\\- Reached a 52week high over 50+ today\n\n**RIOT**\n\n\\- Same as MARA a crypto mining company I've followed since it was 10$. It's always been slightly ahead of MARA but it seems the gap is closing.\n\n\\- Recently reported GREAT earnings 300% surprise in EPS\n\n\\- Heavily shorted (20%) which may be why it has not been climbing as hard in following BTC, but will easily soar multiple levels if Bit rallies hard enough.\n\n\\- Reached over 70 last time BTC ran\n\n**CAN**\n\n\\- The only Chinese stock I singled out that could see a strong run correlated with Bitcoin if it were to run this month.\n\n\\- Canaan manufactures equipment used for mining Bitcoin. As the price rises, more and more companies are enticed to mine.\n\n\\- Reached around 40 last time BTC ran\n\n*Bearish Warning:*\n\n\\- In the past when Bitcoin has ran, there has always been a big correction afterwards. Invest at your own risk.\n\n\\- Offerings can happen if the price climbs too much",

        "selftext": "\n\nBlink Charging (BLNK) is a small cap American EV charging provider with a value of 1.45 billion. It has been rallying from a around $1 dollar to a yearly high of $64.00 but in the last couple months has dropped in value by almost half to $34.00 due to a rising short interest amongst hedge funds to around 41% making it one of the most heavily shorted stocks on the Nasdaq right now. Not sure what hedge funds are short but I feel there are a few reasons for this.\n\nThe main reason for this is that there are a number of other competitors that are making inroads in the market and that BLNK is relatively small amount of market share at 8% at current. Chargepoint is the largest in the market. Although I feel that that what the hedge funds have overlooked is that there should be room for loads of companys in the EV charging industry. The sheer rate of growth in the EV market has driven this company up 1200% and that has potential to keep going. BLNK has implemented a total of 15,760 charging stations and Apple has added all these stations to its Apple Maps which is massive for the company. We also should not underestimate the radical change to the global economy where clean energy is going to overtake traditional fossil fuels. America has a target I believe of 2035 for the phase out of fossil fuel transport while most of Europe has pledged to transform its economy to be carbon neutral by 2030 with EVs playing a major part in that shift. This indicates that there is huge upside for the company in the coming years.\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c\n\nBelow I have highlighted a few of the fundamentals that are interesting and may look familar here including the current short interest (42%) and the current float 32 million. Thats around 20 million LESS than GME currently. \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c\n\nAlso I checked on iborrowdesk where there is currently 45,000 shorts available very similar to GME at the moment although the borrow fee can be as high as 80%?? \n\nHere is where I got these numbers from if people want to expand on this.\n\nhttps://www.highshortinterest.com/ \n\nhttps://iborrowdesk.com/report/CCGID\n\nHowever I do think that there is reason to claim the stock is undervalued regardless of what the squeeze potential may be if that sanario was to play out. What do you guys think I'm not a stock wizard by any means I'm just an Ape like you \ud83e\udda7\ud83e\udda7 all so it would be interesting to get your opinions. \ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\udc8e",

        "selftext": "We're going up decently pre-market.  Here are my thoughts (if anyone cares):  \n\n\n1. They do those blocky pop toys that you see everywhere that i never understood but kids have always gone crazy for.  (Im kind of an old man)  Might be #1 toy\n2. Related to the above, their revenue was 650 million last year.  (numbers are times 1,000) [https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/FNKO/financials/](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/FNKO/financials/) .  Market cap is just around a billion, prob will open +13%, so we'll call market cap 1.13B.  Feels light, considering the revenues\n3. NFT hype play.  This company runs algorithms to track the popularity of each character and adds/drops continuously.  I like the agility/flexibility.  My thought was this feels like a company that could get into NFTs.  Seems like a natural fit.\n4. My favorite thing is that I think the underlying business (not NFTs) might be undervalued, even without any NFT gravy.  And there will be some NFT gravy.  Even though NFTs are not as hot as they were.  But the application works here, you can personalize every individual toy, by giving it a digital \"personality\".  Think tomogatchi/gigapet to go along w your physical toy. \n5. DOWNSIDE: I try to shoot straight.  Personally, my top concern is that there toys have been very popular for very long.  So I am a bit worried about getting into a company that Ive been confused about for years. IVe oft wondered what is so attractive about these toys.\n6. Go EEENF and HITIF too!",

        "selftext": "Thank you everybody for all the great advice yesterday. I am down to three questions now: Do they let you trade immediately with the funds from a sale like Robinhood does, or do you have to wait? Also, from what I read yesterday it sounds like TD does not do fractional trades. Is that correct? Finally, if Schwab is buying TD then wouldn't it make more sense to use Schwab instead if TD, or is TD better? Also open to other ideas, I really do not want to be switching around. I am hoping to settle on one broker and stick with them for the long term. I am leaning toward Fidelity at this point.

        "selftext": "\n*Disclaimer: I just want to say that I respect Cathie Wood a lot as an investor and she has done a phenomenal job during the last couple years or so. Whatever people think about the stocks she has invested in or her opinion on Tesla\u2019s price target, you got to give to her for doing extremely well.*\n\nNow, to the business.\n\nThe ARK space exploration ETF was launched on tuesday and many people (including me) saw it as a disappointment. ARK\u2019s earlier funds have consisted of innovative, disruptive and exciting stocks that offer plenty of potential in the long term, but this time, people felt that this time it wasn\u2019t the case.\n\nI think the holdings were a major player in the upset. Even though there were some decent space orientated companies like Virgin Galactic, there were many companies that didn\u2019t fit the space theme at all. Companies like Amazon, Alphabet, Netflix, JD.com, Alibaba and the 3.14% weighting on the heavy construction machinery giant Deere &amp; Co didn\u2019t please the investors. \n\nEven though these companies do fill the criteria for ARK to add them to the ETF, people expected the same usual bold and disruptive approach and not something that didn\u2019t fit the feeling. \n\nHere is the problem in my opinion: The ETF came too soon. The big space companies like Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX or Jeff Bezos\u2019 Blue Origin aren\u2019t public and I feel like space exploration will be more topical in 20-30 years. That\u2019s why the fund seems a little rushed at the moment. Until Blue Origin or SpaceX go public, the space scene will remain a little stagnant. \n\nThis brings us to another topic: Greed. I sensed a feeling that this fund was created in a little bit of a rush and a little bit too much of greed. ARK has become super popular during the last year or so and launching a new ETF would create more hype towards ARK. Through this more investors would invest in ARK\u2019s funds and give the firm more capital to invest with.\n\nBottom line: While this ETF might have disappointed some investors now, I feel like this fund will only get better overtime as the space exploration sector gains more companies. \n\nI hope all the best towards Cathie Wood and her team and I hope they will continue to perform well, even though the market might be a little unforgiving at the moment for companies that ARK invests in, since inflation, rise of the 10-year treasury yield and the rotation towards reopening plays certainly doesn\u2019t offer the best environment for ARK\u2019s current holdings.",

The company changed its names multiple times, and in March 2018, Bluestar Technologies ultimately became Wikisoft Corp.*\n\n**Management**\n\nMr. Paul Quintal joined the company on August 1, 2020 as Chief Commercial Officer with the main objective to get funding, as he shortly resigned after, in December 2020. He then tool the role as Chairman and Directors, being responsible for corporate governance and investor relations.

Currently, the website portal is operational in its launched form, however, the company is focused on relaunching the updated format of the website (planned to take place in the Spring 2021). Wikisoft has externalized some of its functions, with developers based in India and IT operations based in Denmark.\n\nWikiprofile.com is built on a modern microservice software stack and is developed in multiple Postgres databases, which represent a main pillar for the platform. The architecture is designed to make the web faster, more secure, easier to scale, and in addition, by using proprietary crawler technology, the databases automatically collect information on newly found entities, seeking to have a complete database. Once relaunched, wikiprofile.com will help users to stay connected and informed, allowing professionals to advance their careers while also allowing business to hire the best professionals and work smarter.\n\nWikisoft is just about to enter into the \u201cgrowth phase\u201d. After going through the restructuring stage (2017-2019 ), the company went on to build a solid foundation and gear for growth by changing the management team, leveraging their business model, implementing growth strategies. The next period could represent the growth stage, and could be characterized by accelerated growth, becoming a global brand, and capitalizing on the growth opportunities.\n\nIn the long run, Wikisoft plans to disturb the industry when it comes to validation of professional profiles and create new standards, changing the wat people trust digital information. The platform aims to provide trusted information about companies and people, allowing both of them to make the right decision. Wikisoft would engage in a global market worth 479 billion USD, with the United States being the leading country, at 152 billion USD, according to Statista. ( Revenue of global staffing industry 2008-2019 ).\n\nWikisoft believes that they could be a major disruption for the industry, as the company looks to leverage their strengths:\n\n\\- Large global business database that can be used for Marketing &amp; Sales\n\n\\- Highly scalable setup geared towards the future growth journey\n\n\\- Limited operational cost geared for growth\n\n\\- Data crawled, verified &amp; updated daily providing a job market directory for businesses and job seekers\n\n\\- Disruptive business model with low entrance barrier to gain market share\n\nAs Wikisoft is working to relaunch the website portal in its updated format, the company aims to create additional value for their users through four different planned product lines:\n\na) Wiki Business People Profile\n\n\\- Free basic profile, visible to recruiters looking for new employee\u2019s\n\n\\- Additional features such as data insights on profile visitors , financial company information and receiving job proposals are all planned to be available at a cost\n\nb) Wiki Business Profile\n\n\\- Free basic profile, allowing companies to highlight their culture, increase their brand awareness, and\n\n\\- Additional features such as review management and data insights available at a cost\n\nc) Wiki Recruit\n\n\\- Planned to include a free basic profile where recruiters can post jobs\n\n\\- Additional features such as premium ranking, ability to send job proposals directly to job candidates; ( planned to be $19.99 per month for the premium ranking, $29.99 per month for the premium ranking and ability to send direct job proposals )\n\nd) Wiki Company Research\n\n\\- Offer solidity, liquidity and credit reports to make research and ensure right decision making when choosing a new job or supplier\n\nWikisoft plans to generate revenues from premium profiles and recruiting on the website platform, but also by charging users for access to certain information and features on the platform.\n\nOperations plan \u2013 timeline, projections:\n\nQ1 2021:\n\n\\- Updated website platform to be launched, including new features and extended profiles of businesses and business professionals;\n\n\\- Mobile version planned to be launched as well, along new investor site on Wikisoft.com\n\n\\- Estimated costs: $40,000\n\nQ2 2021:\n\n\\- commence marketing activities, with the goal of generating users and sign ups; ( main drivers: email, SEM, SEO )\n\n\\- further development if website platform with new features such as reviews, in-mails\n\n\\- having the company\u2019s common stock on the OTC markets OTCQB tier\n\n\\- Estimated costs: $40,000\n\nQ3 2021:\n\n\\- Hiring of marketing managers that will be responsible for optimizing and ensuring KPI driven email, SEM &amp; SEO, and for executing Wikisoft\u2019s marketing strategy\n\n\\- IT development for crawling and fronted development of business logic and products\n\n\\- Estimated costs: $50,000\n\nQ4 2021:\n\n\\- Continue hiring additional developers, hire additional customer care and marketing managers\n\n\\- Develop platform with new features like Jobs and Job Postings\n\n\\- Hire CFO to streamline financial reporting, compliance, investor relations and improve corporate governance\n\n\\- Estimated costs: $70,000\n\nThe industry is evolving with rapid pace, and other companies with significantly bigger financial resources, such as LikedIn, Glassdoor, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, and Twitter could or are developing solutions that compete with Wikisoft. Larger companies could focus on professional networking and directly compete with Wikisoft.\n\nWikisoft is a potential buyout target, ultimately following the footsteps of other similar companies in the industry. LinkedIn was acquired by Microsoft for $26.2 billion; Hired raised $132 million since founding in 2012 +10,000 top companies using Hired employers can reduce time to hire by about 33%; Glassdoor was acquired by Recruit Holdings for $1.2 billion in May 2018. Recruit provides recruiting solutions to 7k+ employers, including about 40% of the Fortune 500.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/earz1h620kq61.png?width=1707&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ecbddb859bc3afa1430711612ee19d7540383168\n\nSource: Wikisoft, Management Information, via Information Memorandum\n\nWikisoft will also not have ads on website in order to build brand trust. The company could potentially capture market share through their strong brand recognition and amount of proprietary data. Wikiprofile is rated among the highest in terms of trusted and credible content, while also having a modern IT infrastructure, being e=well organized and integrated for business and consumer applications.\n\n**Risks Factors**\n\n\u201cThe Company has generated very little revenue, which was all from a related party, and has incurred losses of $2,888,765 for the year ended December 31, 2019 and $1,954,297 for the year ended December 31, 2020. The Company has incurred an accumulated deficit of $7,583,538 since inception and does not have a sufficient amount of cash required to pay all the costs associated with its operations. Additionally, as of December 31, 2020, the Company had working capital deficit of approximately $23,041. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern\u201d ( Wikisoft, Annual Report, 03/29/2021, SEC database)\n\n\u201cThe Company seeks to overcome the circumstances that impact its ability to remain a going concern through a combination of the growth of revenues, with interim cash flow deficiencies being addressed through additional equity and debt financing. The Company anticipates raising additional funds through public or private financing, strategic relationships or other arrangements in the near future to support its business operations.\u201d ( Wikisoft, Annual Report, 03/29/2021, SEC database)\n\nWikisoft Corp has little to no history of revenue generation and currently operates at a loss, thus the company is still dependent on financings for the continuation of operations. Also, evaluating and forecasting Wikisoft\u2019s financial performance cannot be done with great accuracy.\n\nMr. Rasmus Refer is the largest shareholder and has substantial control over the company and its policies. As of 03/29/2021, he owns 87.83% of Wikisoft\u2019s common stock. He is also able to exercise significant influence over all matters requiring approval by stockholders.\n\nThe company is extremely likely to conduct offerings of equity in the future, meaning that stockholders would be diluted, as their proportional interest would decrease.\n\nUltimately, the success of the company strictly depends on its ability to develop and commercialize their platform.\n\n**Financials**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5iw9gsb30kq61.png?width=699&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=60031b8d95e5bd77e95da6f4a87455fd8fe839f9\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/iwcbz0i40kq61.png?width=791&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e0fd15c9d2f143e58167e70f1263d49887b8f637\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wh1yqm850kq61.png?width=794&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3efc2c86bf7e92f4d38ea367fb117315c6dde264\n\nSource: ( Wikisoft, Annual Report, 03/29/2021, SEC database)\n\nEven though there is little to no financial data that could be analyzed, Wikisoft represents a huge opportunity for investors, as the company is poised for growth in the near future. Although it is too early to make accurate price target estimates and projections, if the Wikisoft\u2019s management team is successful in leveraging their growth strategies, Wikisoft could become a billion dollar capped company sometime In the next 3-6 years, possibly resulting in a 600% return on investment. As soon as the updated version of the online portal is launched and additional features are added, the company will initiate their marketing strategies, and around that time (expected to be in the fourth quarter of 2021), investors should start seeing revenues and cash flows from operations increasing. By that time, Wikisoft ( if nr. of shares outstanding remains the same), should be trading around $12-$15 per share. Overall, I am optimistic about Wikisoft\u2019s long term prospects, and assign the company a BUY rating.\n\nDisclaimer: I assume no responsibility or liability for any errors or omissions in the content of the report.

        "selftext": "Paysafe has finally just gone public with a new Board of Directors, much less debt, lots more cash, new M&amp;A plans and a new ticker: PSFE During yesterday's ticker change, there were several reports of people having no access to their accounts and/or suddenly being faced with an abrupt change in margin requirements from 25% to 100%. Many suggest this was intentional manipulation to give institutions cheaper shares. Regardless, this may have created a good buying opportunity for us too. For those interested, here's some comprehensive DD.\n\nPaysafe is a unique combination of fintech, iGaming, sports betting and banking all rolled into one stock. Whether you like him or not, this is essentially why NBC\u2019s Jim Cramer recently said, \u201cThere is something about Paysafe that may be the ultimate stock for this moment.\u201d (video link below) Market analyst Steve Grasso says, \u201cIt\u2019s the most excited I\u2019ve been about a stock in a long time.\u201d Grasso, by the way, has repeated called for it to triple ($45-50). So why is that?\n\nPaysafe offers a scalable electronic payment platform used by Draftkings, Roblox, Spotify, eToro, Fortnight, Coinbase, Amazon, Twitch, EA, 888, ApplePay, Youtube, Visa, Microsoft, Xbox, Amelco, William Hill, Ceasar's, Betfair, Pokerstars, PayLease, ESL Gaming, Luckbox, bet365, Lotto among many others.\n\nPaysafe is ranked No. 2 globally in the digital wallet space with presence in 120 countries and No. 4 globally in integrated merchant processing.\n\nImportantly, Paysafe is the No. 1 global leader in iGaming eCash network (currently 36% of revenue) with 10-15X growth projected. US iGaming continues to be legalized state by state, growing revenue by 234% in just the last year. \u201cAt Paysafe, the iGaming market volume was estimated to be $3.4 billion in 2019, and is now projected to reach $47 billion in 2025.\u201d\n\nPaysafe is enabled for digital currency (a type that shall not be mentioned in these parts) without having to go through fiat. It recently partnered with Coinbase to expand options in US and it just launched PaysafeCash in US. (Now in 40 currencies and 30 global markets enabling easier cross border payments.)\n\nPerhaps most central to this recent merger is Bill Foley, Fidelity\u2019s Chairman of the Board and now the Chairman of Paysafe, who has a proven track record for generating exponential synergistic inorganic growth. For example, in just the last five years, he grew Ceridian 3.3X ($4.2B to $14B), Dun &amp; Bradstreet 5.6X ($2B to $11.3B), and Black Knight 8.7X ($1.6B to $14B). He also grew FIS from $2.5 billion to over $91 billion (36.4X) and he says, \u201cThose characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.\u201d\n\nOf their expansion plans Foley says, \u201cWe\u2019ve got a wide landscape we can attack. It\u2019s pretty exciting.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a land grab. We want to be out there about 10 miles ahead of everybody else.\u201d \u201cI have a vision that we should be THE digital wallet and have tie-ins with every major casino company that\u2019s headquartered or located in Las Vegas. There will be money to be made for everybody. That\u2019s why I got so excited about Paysafe Group Holdings Limited as its position in iGaming is really second to none.\u201d \u201cWhether it\u2019s a lottery or slot machines or sportsbetting opening in a state, it\u2019s our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate. We\u2019re focusing on gaming, particularly sportsbetting, in the United States as it becomes legal and we\u2019ve got a wide landscape we can attack. It\u2019s pretty exciting.\u201d\n\nAlong with Bill Foley, Paysafe's newly announced Board of Directors includes a former Morgan Stanley CEO, a former Chairman of the American Gaming Association and CEO of MGM Resorts International, a legal and regulatory expert in the multi-jurisdictional online and retail gambling industries, the CEO of Dun &amp; Bradstreet and CEO of Black Knight, two senior Managing Directors from Blackstone and two senior Managing Directors from CVC,\n\nBetween the new Board of Directors, Bill Foley\u2019s proven expertise in rapid M&amp;A growth and Paysafe\u2019s massive market share and diverse assets, including the world\u2019s second largest digital wallet, $362 million in free cash flow, 30-35% margins (21% CAGR), a projected $100-110 billion in transactional volume and $1.5 billion revenue, it is inevitable that institutional investors will, by necessity, include PSFE in their portfolios.\n\nPaysafe\u2019s industry leading risk management and international regulatory expertise gives them an edge in spaces where competitors have hesitated like iGaming, sportsbetting, alternative currency trading as well as offering essential banking and ecommerce services to the \"unbanked\" (1.7 billion globally). Paysafe has a global platform with integrated cloud technology (Snowflake) allowing for easier migration of eCash, integration of payment methods and expansion into global banking as a service. Paysafe is so diversified that they've identified a $58 trillion TAM.\n\nFurther, major investment funds know that fintechs are the future. Fund manager Cathie Wood says, \u201cFintechs are going to, we believe, gut banks.\u201d Similarly, Jackie Reses, board member of the SF Federal Reserve and fmr Head of Square Capital, calls for fintech \u201ctaking over and revolutionizing banking\u201d representing \u201ca wholesale transition\u201d of a $16 trillion market cap.\n\nAnalyst Michael Del Grosso recently initiated coverage saying, \"We believe PSFE represents a relatively scarce asset within the payments industry given its unique business strategy, geographical footprint, and focus on the iGaming industry. Our forecasts imply revenue growth at the high-end of management's guidance and we believe there is upside to our forecasts in the event of state-level legalization of iGaming. PSFE operates in high-growth verticals, has a unique advantage in its consumer and merchant facing solutions, and offers exposure to a secular growth opportunity in the potential legalization of iGaming in the United States.\"\n\nInvestors should be aware that there is are post-merger lockup periods before insiders can sell their shares: PIPE: = 176 days. Private Equity = 86 days (roughly 6 and 3 months respectively accounting for trading days and weekends). Something to be aware of but there are several signals that these parties aren't in any rush to sell. Eli Nagler, a Senior Managing Director at Blackstone, recently said: \u201cToday is a significant milestone for Paysafe and a testament to the excellent work of their world-class management team over several years. We believe Paysafe has a long runway for further growth and look forward to remaining part of the team and seeing their continued success as a public company.\u201d Regarding Blackstone and CVC, who now have four senior managing directors on Paysafe\u2019s Board, Foley said, \u201cThey rolled a significant amount of their investment which is a confidence builder. They didn\u2019t take all their money off the table\u2026 All of these things put together really created the confidence among the investor base to invest in the PIPE and then support the stock.\u201d Also, the PIPE investors are primarily insurance companies known for long term hold strategies and they are closely associated with Bill Foley. As Foley recently said, \u201cHaving a large PIPE basically validates the transaction.\u2026 The companies that I\u2019m affiliated with actually invested roughly a billion dollars in the PIPE and forward purchase agreements so Paysafe was always a really protected asset, besides the fact that it\u2019s a great asset.\u201d\n\nBill Foley says Paysafe may be his \u201cbest investment ever.\u201d He says, \u201cIt\u2019s a fortress. It\u2019s got a moat.\u201d \u201cWe have a proven strategy of winning as new global markets open. And most importantly, we have unrivaled regulatory risk and technical expertise.\u201d\n\nAs an aside, even though, \u201cRoughly 75% of online gambling operators use Paysafe for processing payments\u201d many in the US haven\u2019t yet heard of it yet. Partially because much of its presence is in back-end processing. Through its several new partnerships (Coinbase, Microsoft Rentmoola), Paysafe is just now rolling out its offerings in the U.S. In Europe, where it is more commonly used, Trustpilot rates Paysafe as \u201cExcellent\u201d (4.7/5 stars) with over 20,000 reviews, and Skrill (owned by Paysafe) 4/5 stars \u201cgreat\u201d with over 16,000 reviews, while competitor PayPal is rated \"poor\" only 1/5 stars with over 16,000 reviews. Further, Paysafe was winner of the American Gambling Awards\u2019 \u201cPayment Processor of the Year,\u201d and owns Openbucks, Neteller and Skrill, 2019 winner \u201cBest Digital Wallet\u201d for best consumer take up and most innovative technology with \u201cgreatest potential to disrupt current ecosystems.\u201d Also, Paysafe won \u201cBest Omni-Channel Payment Solution\u201d 2021 MPE Award and the gaming industry SAGSE award for \u201cBest Payment Method.\u201d\n\nTo give a sense of their pace and progress, these are some of Paysafe\u2019s recent announcements that were made before going public and have not been factored into the current valuation:\n\nDec. 15 \u2014 Paysafe launches Paysafecash in the US\n\nDec. 21 \u2014 Paysafe partners with Amelco to plug US sports books into unified payments platform\n\nDec. 23 \u2014 Paysafe enables online cash payments for Microsoft\n\nJan 11 \u2014 Paysafe partners with Colorado\u2019s BetWildwood\n\nFeb 1 \u2014 Paysafe expands Virginia Lottery partnership\n\nFeb 17 \u2014 Paysafe partners with Luckbox to roll out Skrill and Neteller payment services\n\nFeb 18 \u2014 Paysafe expands partnership with ESL Gaming, the world\u2019s largest esports company\n\nFeb 23 \u2014 Paysafe\u2019s Skrill launches new fiat-to-digital currency\n\nFeb 25 \u2014 Paysafe partners with Austria\u2019s A1 esports League\n\nMar 1 \u2014 Paysafe partners with RentMoola to enable US renters to pay rent with Paysafecash eCash\n\nMar 12 \u2014 Leeds United announces partnership with Skrill\n\nMar 15 \u2014 Paysafe expands U.S. partnership with PointsBet\n\nMar 16 \u2014 Paysafe partners with Provema to enable online cash payments\n\nMar 25 -- Paysafe\u2019s Skrill expands digital currency offering to US with Coinbase\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFortunately for shareholders, even before Foley\u2019s value creation play book is put into action, Paysafe is currently undervalued compared to sector peers.\n\nSince market analyst Steve Grasso continues to his repeat his calls for a triple ($45-50), I've looked more closely at EV / EBITDA, EV / Revenue and EV / Free cash flow multiples of sector peers, including PayPal, Nuvei, Repay, Shift 4, Adyen, Square, Affirm, Stripe, Chime and a few others, using cross-referenced data from Nasdaq, WSJ, Morningstar, Macrotrends, Yahoo Finance. The conservative average of those three multiples puts Paysafe\u2019s post-merger pro forma share value at around $46.52:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPaysafe\u2019s share price using the average multiples from the full list of sector peers:\n\nEV/EBITDA ratio : $122.09\n\nEV/Rev ratio : $83.91\n\nEV/FCF ratio : $87.86\n\nAverage: $97.95\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMore realistic share prices, after eliminating all outliers with very high multiples:\n\nEV/EBITDA ratio :$50.75\n\nEV/Rev ratio : $44.64\n\nEV/FCF ratio : $44.18\n\nAverage :$46.52\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNote: Unlike Paysafe, nearly half of these publicly traded fintechs still do not report positive cash flow. Also, these multiples reflect a collective 27% pull back from recent highs so interest rate risks have been somewhat factored in.\n\nAlso, Paysafe's CFO noted that their conservative 11% growth projection is tied to the general fintech market at large. They have deliberately excluded both M&amp;A plans that are apparently already underway and US iGaming growth that may potentially grow 10x or more over the next 5 years. Further, the above comps include fintechs with slower or similar growth while still commanding much higher multiples. For example, Shift4 reported only 4% y-o-y growth and GPN's growth projection is on par with Paysafe's.",

        "selftext": "TLDR:\n\nWe built platform that allows you to share/discuss investment ideas and see the associated financial information (real-time prices, ratios, price charts, etc.) all in one place. We don\u2019t have finance backgrounds, so we wanted a place where we could have decent due diligence with transparency. When you share an idea it captures your entry price and it is added to your portfolio people can see your DD.\n\nI figured people might find it interesting (you might or might not) but thought it was worth sharing\n\nA bit more detail\n\nAbout a year ago my friend and I started getting into investing and we were tired of searching the internet for due diligence and finance data. We thought wouldn\u2019t it be great if we could share and discuss quality investment ideas and have the supporting financial data all in one place. We wanted to make investing easier - without the BS and pumping.\n\n[Portfolio to Track Ideas](https://preview.redd.it/hhnc83lmvjq61.png?width=1206&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=24d9081ffa66007bbcdb95664c256b8665099ba5)\n\n[The Main Feed](https://preview.redd.it/7ojpyeunvjq61.png?width=1259&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=acaa133bd1220eed075db76a303ffc78c1851d72)\n\nSome cool features\n\n* A dedicated DD upload process that helps structure investment ideas\n* Portfolio and watchlist to track ideas that you have shared and see entry and exit prices\n* Reddit Sentiment Analysis that currently tracks trending stocks on WSB\n* SPAC Data to keep track of recent mergers, acquisitions and all things SPAC related\n\nWe have been mostly sharing this with our friends and they really enjoy using the platform, so we figured we would start to share it with others. We see this as being a social platform for the regular / retail investor to learn about investing, discussing ideas with the community, and having the tools and information needed to become a better investor.\n\nWe are adding more features and enjoying the process of building a cool platform that we love to use.",

Especially for \"short term\" (how dare we even consider it) gains. I'm trying to find out if it makes sense to even try to get my feet off the ground with my measly 3k saved up. Lets say I get lucky in Robinhood and 10x my 3k (not going to happen I know). Then I take that 30k and move it to a new stock and lose it all (yes, much more likely).

        "selftext": "I\u2018m tired of people justifying a GME share price of $500+ based off of earnings going up and transitioning into the online business. It simply isn\u2018t value at that price because it\u2018s a brick and mortar store and still has to be treated as such(at least for the time being, but I have no doubt it will smash in online sales).\n\nFor clarification I am absulutely a financial advisor and you should blindly trust people on the internet with your money. I am also interested in the squeeze, but this post does not go into that possibility further, I\u2018m just talking about fundamental value.\n\nI am also in no way throwing shade at the company. I trust it to grow further.\n\nCurrently sold off all positions in the second squeeze, but will buy back once the price comes down again.\n\n\nLet\u2018s do some quick math to figure out current value without future predictions:\n\nQ1 2021 profit: 80M(2.1B revenue)\n\n2021 Profit would be: 4*80M=320M\n\nAssuming a P/E ratio of 27 (average for gaming sector) company value would be: 27*320M=8.64B\n\nShare price would be: 8.64B/70M(shares outstanding)= $123\n\nCurrent value per share would be $123 per share. I believe earnings will go up with new management, but don\u2018 see GameStop with the same P/E of techy gaming companies yet so I would buy in a bit lower (imho under $100 is definitely a buy, would still go for $110).\n\n\nAssuming growth will continue I fully agree with price predictions displayed in other posts but I would be weary. Ryan Cohen has only just started and we can\u2018t predict anything. He might grow GameStop like Chewy, he might grow it more or less. Fact is that GME isn\u2018t worth nearly $500 at the moment and we don\u2018t know where it\u2018s going. \n\nIt doesn\u2018t make sense to value GameStop like a tech company yet but it\u2018s getting there. The hype surrounding the company will also help boost sales and share price and Ryan Cohen will boost the company massively. \nOverall I see it growing to those $500 predictions (growing profits by about 4x again, after 3x-ing since Q4 2020) in a couple years but paying that price in advance is just absurd.\n\ntl/dr: based on current sales GameStop is worth about $123 per share. I believe it will go up further but you can\u2018t value it like a tech company yet (it still being highly dependent on in-store sales)",

        "selftext": "GlobeX Data Ltd. the leader in Swiss hosted secure communications and secure data management, is pleased to report that it has completed all internal testing of its SekurMessenger Swiss hosted messaging security and privacy solution, in preparation for its commercial launch in Latin America in April 2021.\n\nAs previously announced in a separate press release dated January 12 2021, GlobeX is launching SekurMessenger, its Swiss hosted encrypted instant messaging, secure voice recording transfer and secure file transfer application, with Am\u00e9rica M\u00f3vi's Telcel mobile operator in Mexico. The secure messaging service has been fully integrated with Telcel's billing and provisioning platform and the commercial launch is expected to start the week of April 12 2021. The launch will start in Mexico and expand to other countries where America Movil operates through its Claro brand, such as Colombia and other Latin American countries as the business grows over the coming years.\n\nGlobeX Data and Am\u00e9rica M\u00f3vil are looking at offering a secure and private alternative to other non-secure and non-private messaging applications. The market is geared primarily for business and government users, and privacy conscious consumers. According information published on Am\u00e9rica M\u00f3vi's website, Telcel is the largest mobile operator in Mexico, with over 75 million mobile subscribers. Am\u00e9rica M\u00f3vil (NYSE:AMX) is the 7th largest telecom operator in the world with over 277 million mobile subscribers in over 20 countries throughout Latin America and Europe.\n\nRecent data breaches in messaging applications and in particular in the WhatsApp application have created a certain urgency for businesses and data privacy advocates to protect their communications form cyber-attacks and identity theft via mobile and desktop devices.\n\nSekurMessenger eliminates many of the privacy and security risks by not only not requiring a phone number, which would divulge a user's phone device ID, but also by not social engineering a user's phone or computer contact list and infecting the contacts by default as well, eliminating a huge loophole in security and privacy. SekurMessenger issue each user a username and a SM number. The SM number is the contact ID a user would disclose in order for other SM users to be added. As the Introduction Video demonstrates, the service comes with a self-destruct timer and other features as well, including GlobeX's proprietary VirtualVaults and HeliX technologies with all data stored in Swiss hosted encrypted servers.\n\nAdditionally, SekurMessenger now comes with a proprietary feature and technology called Chat by Invites. This feature allows a SekurMessenger user (\"SM user\") invite a non-SM user, or a group of non-SM users, to chat in a fully private and secure way, without the recipient ever having to register to SekurMessenger or download the app. At the end of the chat, the initiator of the conversation can remotely terminate the conversation and all traces of the conversation are deleted from all users, including the recipient. This unique feature is now fully deployed and functional on all iOS and Android devices and web platforms. The target sectors are numerous, including but not limited to real estate, legal, financial, government, energy, mining, manufacturing, trade and medical sectors.\n\nAlain Ghiai, CEO of GlobeX Data said: \"We are very happy to have completed the testing phase of the launch with Telcel and are looking forward to the launch in the next couple of weeks. We have completed our Spanish language platform for SekurMessenger, and this means that we now can deploy other languages in the coming months as the ground work for localization coding has been done. We have received notice from Tecel, and other partners, that there is a growing demand to replace WhatsApp as a business messaging solution. SekurMessenger is here to satisfy that demand, and as we are not connected, and never have been connected, to AWS, Microsoft Azure or Google Cloud platforms, commonly referred to as \"Big Tech\", we can offer a truly independent, private and secure means of communications through secure messaging, secure voice record transfer and secure email through our proprietary technology and our secure servers based in Switzerland. We plan to expand to several countries in Central and Latin America in the coming years, as we plan to launch with other partners in the region as well. According to statista.com and other information sites, there are over 580 million people speaking Spanish in Latin America alone, and with security and privacy becoming a global concern, and the new WhatsApp rules to share all users' data with Facebook, we have seen a surge in demand and inquiries for our secure and private communications solutions.\"\n\nGlobeX's Data privacy solutions are all hosted in Switzerland, protecting users' data from any outside data intrusion requests. In Switzerland, the right to privacy is guaranteed in article 13 of the Swiss Federal Constitution. The Federal Act on Data Protection (\"FADP\") of 19 June 1992 (in force since 1993) has set up a strict protection of privacy by prohibiting virtually any processing of personal data which is not expressly authorized by the data subjects. The protection is subject to the authority of the Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner.\n\nUnder Swiss federal law, it is a crime to publish information based on leaked \"secret official discussions.\" In 2010 the Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland found that IP addresses are personal information and that under Swiss privacy laws they may not be used to track Internet usage without the knowledge of the individuals involved.\n\nDisclaimer: this is not investment advice, please do your own research.",

If you are cock sure about GME hitting $42069 then you don't need to read every goddamn comment on the daily GME thread or read every crayon laden TA post that tells you GME will moon on X date. Why is there such a need to have constant reassurance about GME mooning? Is it a possible FUD strategy? Think about it; you're conditioned to log on to WSB and get an instant dopamine hit because you saw a post about how GME is gonna moon any second now.

GME is shaping up to be a solid long term play regardless of the short squeeze potential.

        "selftext": "# Digihost Acquires 60 MW Power Plant Increasing Hashrate Capacity to 3 EH\n\nTORONTO, March 24, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Digihost Technology Inc. (\u201cDigihost\u201d or the \u201c**Company**\u201d) (TSXV: **DGHI**; OTCQB: **HSSHF**) is pleased to announce that the Company has signed a binding agreement (the \u201cAgreement\u201d) for the purchase of a 60 MW power plant (\u201c**Digifactory1\u201d**) located in the State of New York, bringing the Company\u2019s total power capacity to approximately 102 MW. The Company\u2019s ability to generate its own power will significantly reduce electricity costs, the Company\u2019s largest operating expense for its cryptocurrency mining operations. It is estimated that with the acquisition of Digifactory1, the all-in cost of electricity will be reduced to under US$0.03 per kw/h.  \n\n\nTo the extent possible, the Company intends to source and utilize renewable natural gas for the operations of Digifactory1 and also engage in the practice of acquiring renewable energy certificates, all in line with the Company\u2019s objective to mitigate its carbon footprint. Digifactory1 will have the capacity to operate an additional 18,000 top tier Bitcoin miners, which if added to the existing fleet of 11,500 miners already in operation, would combine for a total Bitcoin mining capacity of approximately 400 Bitcoins per month as of today\u2019s mining difficulty factor. Additionally, the expanded capacity would allow for a potential increase to the existing hashrate of 190 PH to up to 3 EH. This substantial increase in both Bitcoin mining output capacity and hashrate would be the direct result of potentially adding up to 18,000 latest generation Bitcoin miners, versus the current operating mix of 11,500 older and newer version Bitcoin miners.\n\nUnder the terms of the Agreement, the Company will pay to the vendor cash consideration of US$3,500,000 and issue to the vendor 437,318 common shares of the Company with a deemed value of US$750,000 (US$1.72 per share).\n\nAlec Amar, the Company\u2019s President stated: \u201cWe are extremely excited to have achieved this milestone in the evolution of our Company. Vertical integration is a fundamental aspect of our business model, which will enable us to maximize Bitcoin mining efficiency and continuing to create sustainable value for our shareholders. The addition of Digifactory1 will further reduce the electricity costs of our already efficient operations, and will also provide additional capacity to operate a new fleet of top tier Bitcoin miners.\u201d\n\n[Source](https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2021/03/24/2198342/0/en/Digihost-Acquires-60-MW-Power-Plant-Increasing-Hashrate-Capacity-to-3-EH.html)\n\n  \n\n# Digihost Acquires 700 S17+ 76TH Bitcoin Miners for Immediate Delivery\n\nTORONTO, March 29, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Digihost Technology Inc. (\u201cDigihost\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) (TSXV: **DGHI**; OTCQB: **HSSHF**) is pleased to announce the acquisition of 700 Bitmain S17+ 76TH miners for a total purchase price of US$4.025 million, that would increase the Company\u2019s hashrate by 50PH, or approximately 20% in the second quarter of 2021. The Bitmain S17+ miners are scheduled for delivery in early April and will be deployed immediately.  \n\n\nThe addition of the 700 Bitmain S17+ miners, based on the current price of Bitcoin (\u201c**BTC**\u201d) and level of mining difficulty, would increase the Company\u2019s monthly mined BTC by approximately 9 BTC, which would translate to an additional US$400,000 of operating profit per month. The new miners will be installed at the Company\u2019s existing mining facility in Upstate New York.\n\nMichel Amar, the Company\u2019s CEO, stated: \u201cWe continue to aggressively pursue every new opportunity that aligns with our goal to expand operations through the strategic acquisition of Bitcoin miners and low-cost sources of clean energy. The acquisition and immediate deployment of these new miners is the first in, what we expect to be, many new acquisitions going forward. We are excited to implement our plan to utilize the expanded 3EH hashing capacity from our recently announced acquisition of a 60MW power plant (*press release: March 24, 2021*), where it is expected that the Company\u2019s energy cost would be further reduced by up to 40%.\u201d\n\n[Source](https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2021/03/29/2200616/0/en/Digihost-Acquires-700-S17-76TH-Bitcoin-Miners-for-Immediate-Delivery.html)\n\n**About Digihost Technology Inc.**  \nDigihost Technology Inc. (TSXV: **DGHI**; OTCQB: **HSSHF**) is a growth-oriented blockchain technology company primarily focused on Bitcoin mining. The Company's mining facilities are located in Upstate New York, and are equipped with 78.7 MW of low-cost power with the option to expand to 102MW.

If anyone is interested, I am going to start the intro to investing class April 22. It will go on for four weeks and will take place each Thursday for a 1 hour class. The idea is that during the class, there will be some lecture time, mostly to be used as a guide for a mini-case study. Additionally, participants will each get a company to work on between classes in a group and individual setting. I have found the best way to learn this stuff is to get as many reps as possible, with feedback. I am still determining the timing for the intro to business analysis one and will work on others as well.

I'll respond to comments later.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit 1: Great analysis from u/weeknddev \n\n&gt;7x leverage on encumbered capital and more than 85% is rehypothecated. This is like taking 85% of the same banana until there is no banana left. I would suspect that 7x exposure is low. Why?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Those who do not exceed 700b in capital only have to report monthly as of this publication. That means at any given time they could be several factors more rehypothecated betting like fucking degenerates. And like in other posts because their money comes from derivatives, they are able to sell them and make out like bandits.

Being the software provider for 23 out of 25 top EV automakers, Blackberry will also experience the same explosive growth soon.\n\nUpgrading train and road infrastructure might imply the adoption of Internet of Things (IoT) and Vehicle to Infrastructure communication (V2X) to enhance logistical/traffic management for better efficiency, productivity and public safety. As major infrastructure becomes connected to the internet, security will be a major requirement because these infrastructure will become hackable surfaces that can cause serious damage. Blackberry is the leading software provider for mission critical applications, IoT cybersecurity and Unified Endpoints Management (UEM) that has a great track record working closely with governments across the world.

I know I know -- SEC investigation -- yes I know one of their trucks burned to the ground in January on a test drive.\n\nBut i like the way they are doing the trucks.  They actually look like a truck -- compare it to the Cyber truck, and just looks alone it wins hands down.  I also think the hub motors will be the way for EV to go in the future.  The space a motor like Tesla uses can be dedicated to storage area or more battery space for longer distances.\n\nI'm slowly coming to face reality that EV will be what we drive in the next 10 to 15 years.  So I've been watching and reading on different companies.  I do have a few shares of Lordstown (38 shares -- please stop laughing at the small amount.)\n\nHopefully the remaining test trucks come off the line without a hitch, the testing of them goes off without a hitch, and production starts this fall.\n\n[https://electrek.co/2021/03/31/lordstown-motors-reveals-its-first-two-endurance-betas/](https://electrek.co/2021/03/31/lordstown-motors-reveals-its-first-two-endurance-betas/)",

As you know, the spreads can be ridiculously large (sometimes more than 20%).\n\n\nI recently discovered that when doing a poor man's covered call (pmcc) and it gets assigned, rather than selling the call, my brokerage places  100 short sale stocks per contract into my portfolio and lets me keep the call.\n\nThe spread to buy to cover short stocks seems far less than the call option.\n\nIf I have a LEAP call that I no longer wish to hold, is it materially different to sell the call with a 20% spread loss or do a pmcc and have the call assigned and keep the long call with the shorted shorted shares? It seems like the latter is the same as liquidating but with no spread loss, plus I earn a premium from writing the call option in the pmcc.",

        "selftext": "Take it from someone who started investing this year and made mistakes and loss money. \n\nYou need to decide what your goals are and how high of a risk you wanna take. Do you want to follow stocks and ETFs that you have to actively manage and attempt to beat the market with or do you wanna put your money in weekly or monthly and watch it grow without having to do constant research? Note- while i consider VTI/ the boglehead method pretty low risk and care free one should still keep up with the market to know whats going on.\n\n1. Open webull \n\n2. Deposit any money you are ready to invest into VTI (US total market etf) until you know what your official investmsnt plan is and have adjusted that a few times. Mine has changed a lot. VTI is a relatively \"safe\" yet great returning etf. \n\n3. Go to the \"paper trading\" section of webull and start looking at stocks. Use these different sub reddits like stocks, stockmarket, etfs and boglehead to do research (note- other brokerages use paper trading but its what i used so its why i said webull). \n\n3a. Learn about what TRUE DD is. Not what W S B tells you. Yes some people here and other forums occasionally post solid DD but you need to know what EPS, PE, BVPS, ROE, Debt, etc. All mean and why they are important. Specifically PE is something ive learned to assess. Webull has some pretty great charts where you can look at the different EMAs. Until you know all of these things and know what the company actually does and how they make money/ will in the future the stock stays in your trading account. \n\n4. Find a stock you like. Add it to your paper trading account and watch it for 3-6 months. \n\n5. Assess it again. Did it drop? Why? Did it run up like crazy? Why? Find out why. Learn how to assess these movements.\n\n6. If and only if 3-6  months later you feel like this stock is a winner then move it to your actual trading account and buy in. (For those of you saying well thats 6 months of gains i just missed. No you are getting VTI gains plus if the stocks solid now itll be solid again in 6 months right? The goals a solid return not day trading 200% gains).\n\nPRO TIPS-\n\n-DO NOT FOMO SELL OR BUY STOCKS. I can not emphasize this enough. Ive bought in where things are gaining 5%/ hour and guess what? The stock within a week dropped back down to \"fill the gaps.\" I never believed that was a thing but ive watched it happen way too many times. About 99% of the time a stock i watchlisted shot up if i got it while going up within a  week it temporarily dropped back before rising again. \n\n-Do yourself a favor and avoid Wall s t r e e t b e t s \n\n-Never invest any money you arent willing to lose today. If you need the money soon (within a year in my opinion) and will need that full amount do not invest it. The market especially now is unpredictable. A lot of people lost a lot of money these last 2 months that they will either never get back or will be holding the bag they call it for years. \n\n- Contrary to popular belief... its okay to sell for a loss. This is a hard lesson and one many people will give you a hard time on saying \"BuY hIgH sElL lOw.\" Guess what? Sometimes we pick bad stocks/ etfs. Especially when you are new you will think you found the gold mind of a stock only for it to get bad news like the trial drug didnt get approved or they delayed production or loss a contract bid. Would you rather be down 20% and perhaps watch it keep going down more and hold that stock for years perhaps before it comes back up or would you rather accept the loss (which youll claim on taxes) and then reinvest in a solid company/ etf that will make that loss back faster. Of course this correction we were just in is an expection in someways because some companies will bounce back relatively quick but i forsee that there will be many people that bought in at all time highs who wont see a profit for a very long time. \n\n- In the same respect above you have to have discipline. Stocks dont only go up. You WILL have down days. Youll temporarily be in the red. This will be the pucker moment you decide if you regret buying that position or not. Be disciplined. \n\n-The same goes for being on top. There is absolutely nothing wrong with taking profits if your stock happens to have a huge run up (knowing youll pay capital gains tax though). \n\n- DO NOT USE MARGIN ACCOUNTS \n\n- Avoid option trading for at least a year till you understand what you are doing and can pick good stocks to buy options for. You can lose so much money so fast. \n\n- these subs can be amazing and they can be toxic. Some people give great advice and others dont. Whatever someone tells you dont take it as fact. They may tell you that AMD will double in 6 months buy buy buy. But its your money not theirs you could lose. \n\n- CNBC gets a lot of hate but Squak box, fast money and mad money on Spotify or watching it live has some really good insight to the market. But again they dont always give great advice. \n\n- you have to decide what your plan is and what stocks/ etfs/ risk fits your life style and plan. \n\n- people are scared of dividends for no reason. Unless you are investing millions upon millions of dollars ignoring solid stocks and ETFs which pay dividends to \"avoid unnecessary tax events\" is silly. If you dont believe me look at an ETF like SCHD. calculate the max amount youll ever get in that account. Divide by shares and multiply by dividend rate. Its not that much in end that you pay taxes on.\n\n- as much as we all wanna make 200% every month on every stock thats so unbelievably unrealistic. Look at some of the biggest ETFs like VT, VTI, SCHA, SCHB, VXUS, etc. And see their YOY returns. That your goal.\n\n\nMy advice/ quick tid bit/ plan\n\nI attempted to beat the market. I fomo'd into stocks and got burnt and loss money. I bought stocks at ATh cause every said stocks only go up. Thankfully my losses are minimal since i invested minimally my first year but i learned some hard lessons. I got humbled quick and ive realized i cant beat the market, i don't have the skill or time to do proper DD and watch the stocks 24/7 to assess whats happening and id rather park my money in a few ETFs and let it grow. Im not gonna gain 300% in a year but if i can gain 5-10% in a year it beats the heck outta what a savings account could ever give me.\n\nMy current 5 fund boglehead portfolio spin off... (which i plan to hold for a year before i rebalance... with the exception of increasing SCHD/ VXUS quicker than that and decreasing VTI to compensate). \n\nVTI- 70% \n\nVXUS- 10%\n\nSCHD- 10% \n\nQQQM- 7.5:\n\nQQQJ- 7.5%\n\nGood luck!",

It has been rallying from a around $1 dollar to a yearly high of $64.00 but in the last couple months has dropped in value by almost half to $34.00 due to a rising short interest amongst hedge funds to around 41% making it one of the most heavily shorted stocks on the Nasdaq right now.

        "selftext": "Take it from someone who started investing this year and made mistakes and loss money. \n\nYou need to decide what your goals are and how high of a risk you wanna take. Do you want to follow stocks and ETFs that you have to actively manage and attempt to beat the market with or do you wanna put your money in weekly or monthly and watch it grow without having to do constant research? Note- while i consider VTI/ the boglehead method pretty low risk and care free one should still keep up with the market to know whats going on.\n\n1. Open webull \n\n2. Deposit any money you are ready to invest into VTI (US total market etf) until you know what your official investmsnt plan is and have adjusted that a few times. Mine has changed a lot. VTI is a relatively \"safe\" yet great returning etf. \n\n3. Go to the \"paper trading\" section of webull and start looking at stocks. Use these different sub reddits like stocks, stockmarket, etfs and boglehead to do research (note- other brokerages use paper trading but its what i used so its why i said webull). \n\n3a. Learn about what TRUE DD is. Not what W S B tells you. Yes some people here and other forums occasionally post solid DD but you need to know what EPS, PE, BVPS, ROE, Debt, etc. All mean and why they are important. Specifically PE is something ive learned to assess. Webull has some pretty great charts where you can look at the different EMAs. Until you know all of these things and know what the company actually does and how they make money/ will in the future the stock stays in your trading account. \n\n4. Find a stock you like. Add it to your paper trading account and watch it for 3-6 months. \n\n5. Assess it again. Did it drop? Why? Did it run up like crazy? Why? Find out why. Learn how to assess these movements.\n\n6. If and only if 3-6  months later you feel like this stock is a winner then move it to your actual trading account and buy in. (For those of you saying well thats 6 months of gains i just missed.

Being the software provider for 23 out of 25 top EV automakers, Blackberry will also experience the same explosive growth soon.\n\nUpgrading train and road infrastructure might imply the adoption of Internet of Things (IoT) and Vehicle to Infrastructure communication (V2X) to enhance logistical/traffic management for better efficiency, productivity and public safety. As major infrastructure becomes connected to the internet, security will be a major requirement because these infrastructure will become hackable surfaces that can cause serious damage. Blackberry is the leading software provider for mission critical applications, IoT cybersecurity and Unified Endpoints Management (UEM) that has a great track record working closely with governments across the world.

I am down to three questions now: Do they let you trade immediately with the funds from a sale like Robinhood does, or do you have to wait? Also, from what I read yesterday it sounds like TD does not do fractional trades. Is that correct? Finally, if Schwab is buying TD then wouldn't it make more sense to use Schwab instead if TD, or is TD better? Also open to other ideas, I really do not want to be switching around. I am hoping to settle on one broker and stick with them for the long term. I am leaning toward Fidelity at this point.

        "selftext": "Paysafe has finally just gone public with a new Board of Directors, much less debt, lots more cash, new M&amp;A plans and a new ticker: PSFE During yesterday's ticker change, there were several reports of people having no access to their accounts and/or suddenly being faced with an abrupt change in margin requirements from 25% to 100%. Many suggest this was intentional manipulation to give institutions cheaper shares. Regardless, this may have created a good buying opportunity for us too. For those interested, here's some comprehensive DD.\n\nPaysafe is a unique combination of fintech, iGaming, sports betting and banking all rolled into one stock. Whether you like him or not, this is essentially why NBC\u2019s Jim Cramer recently said, \u201cThere is something about Paysafe that may be the ultimate stock for this moment.\u201d (video link below) Market analyst Steve Grasso says, \u201cIt\u2019s the most excited I\u2019ve been about a stock in a long time.\u201d Grasso, by the way, has repeated called for it to triple ($45-50). So why is that?\n\nPaysafe offers a scalable electronic payment platform used by Draftkings, Roblox, Spotify, eToro, Fortnight, Coinbase, Amazon, Twitch, EA, 888, ApplePay, Youtube, Visa, Microsoft, Xbox, Amelco, William Hill, Ceasar's, Betfair, Pokerstars, PayLease, ESL Gaming, Luckbox, bet365, Lotto among many others.\n\nPaysafe is ranked No. 2 globally in the digital wallet space with presence in 120 countries and No. 4 globally in integrated merchant processing.\n\nImportantly, Paysafe is the No. 1 global leader in iGaming eCash network (currently 36% of revenue) with 10-15X growth projected. US iGaming continues to be legalized state by state, growing revenue by 234% in just the last year. \u201cAt Paysafe, the iGaming market volume was estimated to be $3.4 billion in 2019, and is now projected to reach $47 billion in 2025.\u201d\n\nPaysafe is enabled for digital currency (a type that shall not be mentioned in these parts) without having to go through fiat. It recently partnered with Coinbase to expand options in US and it just launched PaysafeCash in US. (Now in 40 currencies and 30 global markets enabling easier cross border payments.)\n\nPerhaps most central to this recent merger is Bill Foley, Fidelity\u2019s Chairman of the Board and now the Chairman of Paysafe, who has a proven track record for generating exponential synergistic inorganic growth. For example, in just the last five years, he grew Ceridian 3.3X ($4.2B to $14B), Dun &amp; Bradstreet 5.6X ($2B to $11.3B), and Black Knight 8.7X ($1.6B to $14B). He also grew FIS from $2.5 billion to over $91 billion (36.4X) and he says, \u201cThose characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.\u201d\n\nOf their expansion plans Foley says, \u201cWe\u2019ve got a wide landscape we can attack. It\u2019s pretty exciting.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a land grab. We want to be out there about 10 miles ahead of everybody else.\u201d \u201cI have a vision that we should be THE digital wallet and have tie-ins with every major casino company that\u2019s headquartered or located in Las Vegas. There will be money to be made for everybody. That\u2019s why I got so excited about Paysafe Group Holdings Limited as its position in iGaming is really second to none.\u201d \u201cWhether it\u2019s a lottery or slot machines or sportsbetting opening in a state, it\u2019s our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate. We\u2019re focusing on gaming, particularly sportsbetting, in the United States as it becomes legal and we\u2019ve got a wide landscape we can attack. It\u2019s pretty exciting.\u201d\n\nAlong with Bill Foley, Paysafe's newly announced Board of Directors includes a former Morgan Stanley CEO, a former Chairman of the American Gaming Association and CEO of MGM Resorts International, a legal and regulatory expert in the multi-jurisdictional online and retail gambling industries, the CEO of Dun &amp; Bradstreet and CEO of Black Knight, two senior Managing Directors from Blackstone and two senior Managing Directors from CVC,\n\nBetween the new Board of Directors, Bill Foley\u2019s proven expertise in rapid M&amp;A growth and Paysafe\u2019s massive market share and diverse assets, including the world\u2019s second largest digital wallet, $362 million in free cash flow, 30-35% margins (21% CAGR), a projected $100-110 billion in transactional volume and $1.5 billion revenue, it is inevitable that institutional investors will, by necessity, include PSFE in their portfolios.\n\nPaysafe\u2019s industry leading risk management and international regulatory expertise gives them an edge in spaces where competitors have hesitated like iGaming, sportsbetting, alternative currency trading as well as offering essential banking and ecommerce services to the \"unbanked\" (1.7 billion globally). Paysafe has a global platform with integrated cloud technology (Snowflake) allowing for easier migration of eCash, integration of payment methods and expansion into global banking as a service. Paysafe is so diversified that they've identified a $58 trillion TAM.\n\nFurther, major investment funds know that fintechs are the future. Fund manager Cathie Wood says, \u201cFintechs are going to, we believe, gut banks.\u201d Similarly, Jackie Reses, board member of the SF Federal Reserve and fmr Head of Square Capital, calls for fintech \u201ctaking over and revolutionizing banking\u201d representing \u201ca wholesale transition\u201d of a $16 trillion market cap.\n\nAnalyst Michael Del Grosso recently initiated coverage saying, \"We believe PSFE represents a relatively scarce asset within the payments industry given its unique business strategy, geographical footprint, and focus on the iGaming industry. Our forecasts imply revenue growth at the high-end of management's guidance and we believe there is upside to our forecasts in the event of state-level legalization of iGaming. PSFE operates in high-growth verticals, has a unique advantage in its consumer and merchant facing solutions, and offers exposure to a secular growth opportunity in the potential legalization of iGaming in the United States.\"\n\nInvestors should be aware that there is are post-merger lockup periods before insiders can sell their shares: PIPE: = 176 days. Private Equity = 86 days (roughly 6 and 3 months respectively accounting for trading days and weekends). Something to be aware of but there are several signals that these parties aren't in any rush to sell. Eli Nagler, a Senior Managing Director at Blackstone, recently said: \u201cToday is a significant milestone for Paysafe and a testament to the excellent work of their world-class management team over several years. We believe Paysafe has a long runway for further growth and look forward to remaining part of the team and seeing their continued success as a public company.\u201d Regarding Blackstone and CVC, who now have four senior managing directors on Paysafe\u2019s Board, Foley said, \u201cThey rolled a significant amount of their investment which is a confidence builder. They didn\u2019t take all their money off the table\u2026 All of these things put together really created the confidence among the investor base to invest in the PIPE and then support the stock.\u201d Also, the PIPE investors are primarily insurance companies known for long term hold strategies and they are closely associated with Bill Foley. As Foley recently said, \u201cHaving a large PIPE basically validates the transaction.\u2026 The companies that I\u2019m affiliated with actually invested roughly a billion dollars in the PIPE and forward purchase agreements so Paysafe was always a really protected asset, besides the fact that it\u2019s a great asset.\u201d\n\nBill Foley says Paysafe may be his \u201cbest investment ever.\u201d He says, \u201cIt\u2019s a fortress. It\u2019s got a moat.\u201d \u201cWe have a proven strategy of winning as new global markets open. And most importantly, we have unrivaled regulatory risk and technical expertise.\u201d\n\nAs an aside, even though, \u201cRoughly 75% of online gambling operators use Paysafe for processing payments\u201d many in the US haven\u2019t yet heard of it yet. Partially because much of its presence is in back-end processing. Through its several new partnerships (Coinbase, Microsoft Rentmoola), Paysafe is just now rolling out its offerings in the U.S. In Europe, where it is more commonly used, Trustpilot rates Paysafe as \u201cExcellent\u201d (4.7/5 stars) with over 20,000 reviews, and Skrill (owned by Paysafe) 4/5 stars \u201cgreat\u201d with over 16,000 reviews, while competitor PayPal is rated \"poor\" only 1/5 stars with over 16,000 reviews. Further, Paysafe was winner of the American Gambling Awards\u2019 \u201cPayment Processor of the Year,\u201d and owns Openbucks, Neteller and Skrill, 2019 winner \u201cBest Digital Wallet\u201d for best consumer take up and most innovative technology with \u201cgreatest potential to disrupt current ecosystems.\u201d Also, Paysafe won \u201cBest Omni-Channel Payment Solution\u201d 2021 MPE Award and the gaming industry SAGSE award for \u201cBest Payment Method.\u201d\n\nTo give a sense of their pace and progress, these are some of Paysafe\u2019s recent announcements that were made before going public and have not been factored into the current valuation:\n\nDec. 15 \u2014 Paysafe launches Paysafecash in the US\n\nDec. 21 \u2014 Paysafe partners with Amelco to plug US sports books into unified payments platform\n\nDec. 23 \u2014 Paysafe enables online cash payments for Microsoft\n\nJan 11 \u2014 Paysafe partners with Colorado\u2019s BetWildwood\n\nFeb 1 \u2014 Paysafe expands Virginia Lottery partnership\n\nFeb 17 \u2014 Paysafe partners with Luckbox to roll out Skrill and Neteller payment services\n\nFeb 18 \u2014 Paysafe expands partnership with ESL Gaming, the world\u2019s largest esports company\n\nFeb 23 \u2014 Paysafe\u2019s Skrill launches new fiat-to-digital currency\n\nFeb 25 \u2014 Paysafe partners with Austria\u2019s A1 esports League\n\nMar 1 \u2014 Paysafe partners with RentMoola to enable US renters to pay rent with Paysafecash eCash\n\nMar 12 \u2014 Leeds United announces partnership with Skrill\n\nMar 15 \u2014 Paysafe expands U.S. partnership with PointsBet\n\nMar 16 \u2014 Paysafe partners with Provema to enable online cash payments\n\nMar 25 -- Paysafe\u2019s Skrill expands digital currency offering to US with Coinbase\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFortunately for shareholders, even before Foley\u2019s value creation play book is put into action, Paysafe is currently undervalued compared to sector peers.\n\nSince market analyst Steve Grasso continues to his repeat his calls for a triple ($45-50), I've looked more closely at EV / EBITDA, EV / Revenue and EV / Free cash flow multiples of sector peers, including PayPal, Nuvei, Repay, Shift 4, Adyen, Square, Affirm, Stripe, Chime and a few others, using cross-referenced data from Nasdaq, WSJ, Morningstar, Macrotrends, Yahoo Finance. The conservative average of those three multiples puts Paysafe\u2019s post-merger pro forma share value at around $46.52:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPaysafe\u2019s share price using the average multiples from the full list of sector peers:\n\nEV/EBITDA ratio : $122.09\n\nEV/Rev ratio : $83.91\n\nEV/FCF ratio : $87.86\n\nAverage: $97.95\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMore realistic share prices, after eliminating all outliers with very high multiples:\n\nEV/EBITDA ratio :$50.75\n\nEV/Rev ratio : $44.64\n\nEV/FCF ratio : $44.18\n\nAverage :$46.52\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNote: Unlike Paysafe, nearly half of these publicly traded fintechs still do not report positive cash flow. Also, these multiples reflect a collective 27% pull back from recent highs so interest rate risks have been somewhat factored in.\n\nAlso, Paysafe's CFO noted that their conservative 11% growth projection is tied to the general fintech market at large. They have deliberately excluded both M&amp;A plans that are apparently already underway and US iGaming growth that may potentially grow 10x or more over the next 5 years. Further, the above comps include fintechs with slower or similar growth while still commanding much higher multiples. For example, Shift4 reported only 4% y-o-y growth and GPN's growth projection is on par with Paysafe's.",

        "selftext": "# Digihost Acquires 60 MW Power Plant Increasing Hashrate Capacity to 3 EH\n\nTORONTO, March 24, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Digihost Technology Inc. (\u201cDigihost\u201d or the \u201c**Company**\u201d) (TSXV: **DGHI**; OTCQB: **HSSHF**) is pleased to announce that the Company has signed a binding agreement (the \u201cAgreement\u201d) for the purchase of a 60 MW power plant (\u201c**Digifactory1\u201d**) located in the State of New York, bringing the Company\u2019s total power capacity to approximately 102 MW. The Company\u2019s ability to generate its own power will significantly reduce electricity costs, the Company\u2019s largest operating expense for its cryptocurrency mining operations. It is estimated that with the acquisition of Digifactory1, the all-in cost of electricity will be reduced to under US$0.03 per kw/h.  \n\n\nTo the extent possible, the Company intends to source and utilize renewable natural gas for the operations of Digifactory1 and also engage in the practice of acquiring renewable energy certificates, all in line with the Company\u2019s objective to mitigate its carbon footprint. Digifactory1 will have the capacity to operate an additional 18,000 top tier Bitcoin miners, which if added to the existing fleet of 11,500 miners already in operation, would combine for a total Bitcoin mining capacity of approximately 400 Bitcoins per month as of today\u2019s mining difficulty factor. Additionally, the expanded capacity would allow for a potential increase to the existing hashrate of 190 PH to up to 3 EH. This substantial increase in both Bitcoin mining output capacity and hashrate would be the direct result of potentially adding up to 18,000 latest generation Bitcoin miners, versus the current operating mix of 11,500 older and newer version Bitcoin miners.\n\nUnder the terms of the Agreement, the Company will pay to the vendor cash consideration of US$3,500,000 and issue to the vendor 437,318 common shares of the Company with a deemed value of US$750,000 (US$1.72 per share).\n\nAlec Amar, the Company\u2019s President stated: \u201cWe are extremely excited to have achieved this milestone in the evolution of our Company. Vertical integration is a fundamental aspect of our business model, which will enable us to maximize Bitcoin mining efficiency and continuing to create sustainable value for our shareholders. The addition of Digifactory1 will further reduce the electricity costs of our already efficient operations, and will also provide additional capacity to operate a new fleet of top tier Bitcoin miners.\u201d\n\n[Source](https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2021/03/24/2198342/0/en/Digihost-Acquires-60-MW-Power-Plant-Increasing-Hashrate-Capacity-to-3-EH.html)\n\n  \n\n# Digihost Acquires 700 S17+ 76TH Bitcoin Miners for Immediate Delivery\n\nTORONTO, March 29, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Digihost Technology Inc. (\u201cDigihost\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) (TSXV: **DGHI**; OTCQB: **HSSHF**) is pleased to announce the acquisition of 700 Bitmain S17+ 76TH miners for a total purchase price of US$4.025 million, that would increase the Company\u2019s hashrate by 50PH, or approximately 20% in the second quarter of 2021. The Bitmain S17+ miners are scheduled for delivery in early April and will be deployed immediately.  \n\n\nThe addition of the 700 Bitmain S17+ miners, based on the current price of Bitcoin (\u201c**BTC**\u201d) and level of mining difficulty, would increase the Company\u2019s monthly mined BTC by approximately 9 BTC, which would translate to an additional US$400,000 of operating profit per month. The new miners will be installed at the Company\u2019s existing mining facility in Upstate New York.\n\nMichel Amar, the Company\u2019s CEO, stated: \u201cWe continue to aggressively pursue every new opportunity that aligns with our goal to expand operations through the strategic acquisition of Bitcoin miners and low-cost sources of clean energy. The acquisition and immediate deployment of these new miners is the first in, what we expect to be, many new acquisitions going forward. We are excited to implement our plan to utilize the expanded 3EH hashing capacity from our recently announced acquisition of a 60MW power plant (*press release: March 24, 2021*), where it is expected that the Company\u2019s energy cost would be further reduced by up to 40%.\u201d\n\n[Source](https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2021/03/29/2200616/0/en/Digihost-Acquires-700-S17-76TH-Bitcoin-Miners-for-Immediate-Delivery.html)\n\n**About Digihost Technology Inc.**  \nDigihost Technology Inc. (TSXV: **DGHI**; OTCQB: **HSSHF**) is a growth-oriented blockchain technology company primarily focused on Bitcoin mining.

        "selftext": "\n\n\n\nThis post is regarding the link on Michael Burry's Twitter. It is a long read, but I have found some parallels with [The EVERYTHING Short](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mgucv2/the_everything_short/). Really recommend reading the whole thing it if you have time.\n\nRead it here: [https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/ins-and-outs-of-collateral-re-use-20181221.htm](https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/ins-and-outs-of-collateral-re-use-20181221.htm)\n\nDisclaimer: I am not a financial advisor. This document was published in December 2018 and the author has a PhD in Finance, so a real wrinkly brain. (Although it is a bit outdated, the information is insightful and Michael Burry is leading us to it)\n\n**So what sticks out to me:**\n\n1. &amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/18s07nx4lhq61.jpg?width=294&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4f86ce49c15ff2eccf34d031e0129ee09c42aae8\n\n2.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0jrlxae7nhq61.jpg?width=319&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8b98e4ede6f06ef8562d6c039c5e138b88ace48b\n\nDid I read that right, 7 times as many treasury security backed assets as they own!?! and this is just 2018...\n\n3.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/522gn9j8nhq61.jpg?width=408&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f963eceba95828408aba0ce2391f43b738cdd3ed\n\nSo this part about the eSLR rule is interesting, but it didn't hold up. Next I will show some 2020 data from the same author which shows the collateral multiplier back up around 9 in April 2020.Source: [https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/files/2020103pap.pdf](https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/files/2020103pap.pdf)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/e8h5xnu1ohq61.png?width=697&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a334a1c4d758f5364a51f8f61362d7f6f271e74f\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m3vkyi49ohq61.png?width=648&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f5e2c2dab4e6145fcc80504ebf97585d100bfaaf\n\nNotice collateral multiplier is defined as the ratio between the black line (U.S. Treasury SFTs) and the red line (non-rehypothecated).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCould a much smarter ape like u/atobitt give some insight here? This looks huge, but I don't completely understand what I'm looking at here.\n\nSorry if it's a bit rushed, I wrote it during my lunch break. I'll respond to comments later.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit 1: Great analysis from u/weeknddev \n\n&gt;7x leverage on encumbered capital and more than 85% is rehypothecated. This is like taking 85% of the same banana until there is no banana left. I would suspect that 7x exposure is low. Why?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Those who do not exceed 700b in capital only have to report monthly as of this publication. That means at any given time they could be several factors more rehypothecated betting like fucking degenerates. And like in other posts because their money comes from derivatives, they are able to sell them and make out like bandits. Truly bandits.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Since we effectively blocked their get out of jail free card by holding so damn hard they cannot come up with those rehypothecated shares. They are beyond fucked .. but we might be too.\n\nAll I can say is, buy and HODL is the way.\n\n**Important: Let\u2019s Spread Awareness**\n\nMy dear Apes check this out.\nLet\u2019s spread awareness of what an massive fraud is happening currently on the stock markets. What better way is there than than educating ourselves and others?\n\n\n**Not financial advice**\n\nThis is not financial advice. I\u2019m just an idiat who has no clue what he\u2019a taklking about. I just like the stock.\n\n**Original source** by u/RichHodler",

        "selftext": "I got in at $13 after reading of it on wallstreetbets but ended up selling it at around $17 because I thought it\u2019s amazing that something I got from wallstreetbets actually went up, time to take profit. I was a pussy basically. Then I saw it went up to $30s then $100s then $300s and as many I started reading more on it but decided not to chase it. Then saw it come back down to $40 but just thought to myself I dodged a bullet, even though I could have stayed in at $13 purchase and not sell but it could be worse and I could have gotten it and $300. Then I saw it going back up and while all of this was happening I went balls deep reading the DDs on wsb/gme and really understood what was going on but again decided to stay away cause I didn\u2019t want anything close to betting. But clearly it didn\u2019t stay that way and my whole plan changed when I took my mothers to doctors, we were sitting in the waiting area and I had some heart to heart with my mother (she recently lost her brother and got sick right after) She went to use the restroom and I opened wsb and saw DFV post his account update. That happened to be exactly at the time when $GME had gone back up from $40s back to above $100s, but that day it was red. It dipped below $100 and I set the limit for $88 to go all in and guess what $GME low was that day.. around $86.5. I got my shares and right after it started going up.\nAnd it was the last time $GME dipped below $100. I consider myself extremely lucky I got a good buy point even though I was nowhere in the earliest of people who deserve all the returns in this more then anyone cause they believed in the stock from the start but I am so glad I got in this cause at that moment it felt so right. It still feels right. This was about 40 days back and i have deleted my stock account from my phone so I don\u2019t even think of selling it, I want..need this to change my life around, had pretty much the worst time of my life since I lost everything in 2018 and this seemed like the best way to do it. I put whatever I have now In gme and honestly it doesn\u2019t matter if I got in at $88 or $200 when it\u2019s at +$10000. It\u2019s good to be in this journey with you guys. Thanks to you guys I got in this and got this opportunity to see the worth. I believe in this company and I HOLD \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nSorry for any English mistakes, not my first language.

        "selftext": "As you probably already saw last night, DISCB had a huge pump.\n\nBut why didn't DISCA (and DISCK for that matter) follow?\n\nI get that the there are minor differences like A would have voting rights and B doesn't, plus theres a 30x difference in volume and a corresponding 3x inverse difference in market cap between A and B. The eps is around the same though. The beta for B is just under 1 at 0.97 whilst A and C are around 1.5\n\nSo why is there such dispersion between its class A and class B share price? I don't get it.\n\nSorry, if this is a dumb question.",
