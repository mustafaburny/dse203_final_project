        "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nThis is a follow-up on a series of posts about IV crushes around earnings. I was interested in stocks where options plays would be interesting around earnings thanks to IV. Some stocks see their IV grow significantly leading to earnings, before crashing, and that can make option prices interesting for selling and buying back just after the crash for example. This is of course not as simple because other factors can play in, and for this to work the stock price needs to stay within a certain range basically.\n\nSo to identify good stocks for this, I looked at historic IV and crunched some numbers with python. I calculated the IV percentage crush after every earnings, then I averaged that by stock for all historic releases. I combine this with the average of the stock movement around earnings for the last three releases to decide what range of prices to calibrate my options to. I also use an ML model that detects big upcoming movements and outputs a probability of the price beating market expectation of movement (priced in options)\n\nThis gives me a list of stocks that consistently see a crush in IV after most of their earnings and don't usually much. I will be posting the results here every week.\n\nThis week's selection is [$AMCR $JKHY and $NDSN](https://earnings-watcher.tech/#/company?symbol=AMCR). Here are some numbers\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qjxuitr2clh71.png?width=1172&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=66a21cda8c0f9790e71583dddfb5240ffd89fec2\n\n*model\\_exp* is the movement the model is expecting, calculating as the average of historic moves,.\n\n*mvt\\_std* is the standard variation of the historic moves, a measure of dispersion basically, you can think of it an average distance between the samples and the mean, which is here *model\\_exp*\n\nEnjoy and let me know what you think!",

        "selftext": "In summary, I expect another wave of lockdowns to go into effect, but they will go into effect too late, and do too little to have any effect on containing the next COVID19 Delta Variant outbreak. \n\nUnfortunately, I also don't think there's any market play beyond building up 12 months of cash for rent/daily expenses, and to stockpile on toilet paper now before the next shopping spree starts.\n\nIn general, when dealing with disease, the public health options are development of a cure, development of vaccine, or implementation of quarantine. Remdesivir is the only available treatment, and requires IV application, and thus is not effective for widespread use. Regarding quarantine, I point you to the news.\n\nRegarding the vaccine, it seems that the recent mRNA vaccines only have \\~50% efficacy in preventing infection. The CDC tracked an outbreak in Massachusetts due to a July 4th party in Provincetown, MA\n\n[https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7031e2.htm?s\\_cid=mm7031e2\\_w](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7031e2.htm?s_cid=mm7031e2_w)\n\nThe study shows a nearly 1:1 infection count of vaccinated to unvaccinated individuals. \n\nFor those of you not in the know, this is one of the biggest LGBTQ parties in the US, so is pretty left leaning. We can assume a pretty high vaccination rate. This is actually good for vaccine efficacy due to Simpson's paradox, but it does show that breakthrough infection is real, and not to be underestimated. The CDC did not estimate vaccine efficacy and warned not to do so due to small sample sizes.\n\nThe UK did.\n\n[http://hdl.handle.net/10044/1/90800](http://hdl.handle.net/10044/1/90800)\n\nBased on their REACT study, which randomly samples ALL UK residents, and not just sick people, they estimate a vaccine efficacy of 50%-60%. Do note that the error bars on these numbers are BIG, like 20%-95% big.\n\nThe vaccine seems to be on par to a flu shot in terms of efficacy. Unfortunately, flu has an r0 of 1-2. The original COVID19 had an r0 of 2-3, and delta looks to be 4-9.\n\nGiven delta is about 2x-3x more transmissible, and the vaccine is 1/2 has effective, lockdowns and masking are inconsistent, I'd estimate we're going to see COVID spread on par to the early pandemic. We're currently back to infection numbers similar to Nov/Dec 2020. Even if all vaccine hesitancy vanished overnight, given the mediocre efficacy coupled with high r0, vaccinations must be coupled with social distancing to control the spread. \n\nGiven human nature and politics, a lockdown NOW could theoretically control the spread. That is politically unviable. A lockdown later will be too late due to exponential growth, but will occur anyway once bodies start to hit the floor. \n\nThe doctor's haven't figured out why the vaccine isn't working, it could be waning immunity amongst the early vaccinations, or just a poor match. This would necessitate a booster, which the WHO just announced a moritorium on so poor countries can get vaccinated, or a delta specific booster, which Pfizer and Moderna are working on, but there's no data if it works or not. Of course, rich countries will likely give the WHO the finger, but this only helps if this is waning immunity and not vaccine mismatch.\n\nSo, what's this mean for the markets? Likely \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b \n\nBut in the mean time, everything's stupid expensive and I have no idea if/when this would occur. So, I'll give the personal finance advice to keep 6-12 months of cash to pay for rent/food if everything goes to shit. Even assuming that an uncontrolled pandemic occurs, I'd estimate a COVID-19 mortality of 1%-3% to not permanently cripple the economy. Unless your country is like Peru with a case mortality rate of \\~10%, in which case you're pretty f\\*cked. \n\n[https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/mortality](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/mortality)\n\nBoomers are probably going to get killed by this virus, so investing in Zacks Funeral Services industry may be a good call: SCI, HI, MATW, CSV. Unfortunately, the market looks like they already priced this in.\n\nSo, stay safe. Get vaccinated. Socially distance. But it probably won't be enough.",

        "selftext": "# Major US indices pulled back Friday, but not all that much. I believe we are almost at a tipping point for an after summer correction, which will pull down the market across the board, gearing up for a run into the holiday season.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1bcspupbkue71.png?width=864&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=02a41e032419f26faad300dd4bb7390095aacc6e\n\n Only one alert triggered Friday and that was an $**ABNB** put.  After starting on this project, I believe that $**ABNB** is overvalued and doesn't have the sustainability that the current market price implies. Therefore, I've put in two put alerts. Go small.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ejhnm9agkue71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=40397c1f5393200798dd4c6033b186b808f6d782\n\n A better positions that I would prefer is entering into a bigger put at the YTD VWAP.

If **Tesla** pulls back to the 50MA, I'll buy more calls. However, there is a chance that $**TSLA** keeps running next week therefore I am not interested in short term puts.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xusig0cqkue71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=22d5c663bbebc6b93cb2bf8f818047304dcf42da\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n $**MT** is looking a little bit overbought, and even though I and many other analysts are bullish long term, I believe that this can be a good time to lock in some quick profits. Once it consolidates toward the 50MA, or even the YTD VWAP, we can re-enter with calls.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ju2q5ggrkue71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bd9e8be9ff1955c146f200b161d86d67da242b7a\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n I'm really liking $**CRM** going into August. The 180MA is approaching a large volume shelf that indicates a lot of buying will happen there. More so, the YTD VWAP is lurking at those levels as well. Long term bullish on **Salesforce**, and August is historically one of the best months for the stock. October or November calls, look tempting around the $230 level.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/udz6h6jskue71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=07559317d5d5618e74012c3ab7e3ae858b4b86db\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n \n\n$**TSM**, **Taiwan Semiconductor**, is, I believe, an undervalued company that has a fair price of around $130+. This is a great opportunity to pick up calls for November or EOY. September and October are some of the best months for **TSM** according to Trend Spider's Seasonality Chart. At current levels, the 50, 180, and a huge volume shelf are converging. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/21u9xyiukue71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0c03a9034effbf1c0594ba5aa34a48a6db2978b4\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n $**AXP** has had an amazing run this year August is one of the better months over the past decade. I believe consumer spending has and will increase and monthly calls or vertical spreads are perfect here.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jpgpa2hvkue71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0c2b50116bebade25f92b68a5e8f9b4437295997\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n **$AAP, Advance Auto Parts**, is still an interesting play for me. Everyone has probably heard by now that used car prices have gone up a lot. If we can get a consolidation around the 50MA, I think it is worth it to buy calls. However, I won't be waiting much longer for this one. I'll give it another week.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g655tlewkue71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0966c88748b44fd8f3317333e8233339c43c3644\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n $**VRT** also had a good week, up from the 50MA. I'm waiting for a resistance bounce to enter some short term puts.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r3kkaddxkue71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=87d502222fa3701d87bf608c6284efa2dbc8fad2\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n I'm still waiting for **$X, US Steel**, to pull back to the 180ma. As you can see last it just came off a 180ma bounce, but not quite low enough to hit my trigger. I'm a patient man and I'll wait again. This is a good play going into October and November, so we have some time to enter.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/09oy8sgykue71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ea114b1ade318baa53487eac738ca13ff3002470\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n **$AI** is to overhyped, and puts at upper resistance will pay significantly in my opinion. I've reupped the time on this alert and will wait for a bounce to enter.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/snkwzjizkue71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=acdd5c9d6fa626471ff21cf572b84a84a18343c7\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n One of my favorite shorts is $**EBON**. Probably by now you know I have personal experience with this company. Sort them into the ground, please.

        "selftext": "**The Challenge:** *Double a $30K account in four months - 88 trading days, without using low float momentum trades. This is the update after two weeks, or ten trading days.*\n\n**The Reason:** *I set up this account specifically for this challenge.  Posting trades from my regular account was not instructive - mainly because, the trades were not relatable (e.g. most people are not buying 10 ITM TSLA calls that are 3 weeks out).  However, I wanted to show traders that it is possible to quickly grow your Day Trading account without having to do low float momentum trades (which is a fast way for traders, especially new traders, to lose a lot of money).  Instead, this challenge intends to utilize foundational Day Trading methods (i.e. Relative Strength to SPY) in a completely transparent way.  The amount I chose to start with was $30, as the federal guidelines requires $25K to Day Trade and I added $5K for some cushion.*\n\nIn order to reach this goal I would need to average $341 a day.  \n\nEvery trade since this challenge has started has been live posted in r/RealDayTrading as they happen.\n\nI am also providing the link to the accounts' TraderSync log.  Here is the updated log as of the end of day today:\n\n[https://shared.tradersync.com/hariseldon2021](https://shared.tradersync.com/hariseldon2021)\n\nI have not finished updating the \"setups\" and \"mistakes\" in Tradersync, I will do that this weekend.\n\n*Note: There are still some open positions that TraderSync does not report until they close, including calls for* ***DDOG*** *and puts for* ***CL.***  *As well as an open* ***/ES*** *short.  Thus, the total is overstated by about $1,700.  Only closed trades are included.*\n\nAlso being carried into next week are **IR** calls, **MA** puts, **SFIX** puts, **SNAP** calls and **SPCE** calls.\n\nThe total account value is at $35,321.48, almost $1,000 over goal.  \n\nCommissions and Fees paid so far: $669.82\n\nTotal number of trades: 223 - with 30 trades considered \"Breakeven\" (*within $25)* and 8 open trades.  Of the 185 remaining trades that were either winners or losers:\n\nWinners: 139 - 75.1%\n\nLosers: 46 - 24.9%\n\n**Notes:** Computer issues limited me to only a few trades today, and I took part of yesterday off.\n\nI made several mistakes (**PINS, MRNA**) that I outlined in other posts, and Ameritrade closed a lotto trade last Friday which cost me roughly $500 in profit. \n\nThis challenge is not for me to prove anything about my trading - to be honest, I do not need to - I have traded for a living for the past 3 years, make a good living out of it and have absolutely no need for validation.  However, after posting on the various trading forums here and speaking to hundreds of traders over the past two years, several things have become clear:\n\n1) Most people believe Day Trading is primarily *Gap n Go* strategies, which is what most so-called \"gurus\" market to people.  **This is not Day Trading**.  In fact, this method is *extremely difficult* and the last thing new traders should be trying.\n\n2) Everyone else believes that it is impossible to be a consistently profitable Day Trader.  Now I know this isn't true, because I am one.  Many of the professional Day Traders I know, also know this isn't true, since they do it as well.  Unfortunately, people here got it into their heads that 95% fail and technical analysis is bullshit.  Well most people *do fail* but that is because nobody tells them how difficult it is, and how much time (about two years of training) and effort it takes.\n\nSo I set up r/RealDayTrading to be a place where people can learn how to actually do this for a living.  I am not selling anything, have no desire to have any channel and do not have a product.   Once again, don't need it, don't want it.   However, I did want a place where other pros could come and teach people how to Day Trade without constantly being attacked by trolls (shocking I know, but Reddit has trolls).  I am very thankful that several of them agreed to come on board as mods and have been posting excellent content.   However, advice only goes so far - hence, this challenge.\n\nI hope some of you are finding it helpful.\n\nSee you next week!\n\nBest - H.S.",

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, August 2, 2021**\n\nStocks continued volatility from last week, with the three major indexes opening the day in the green before turning lower towards the end in the first trading session in August. As has been the case for at least a few weeks now, it seems the market will continue to perform a careful balancing act between record corporate profits and expectations for economic expansion and concerns surrounding the highly contagious coronavirus Delta variant and inflation. \n\nSo far, 59% of the companies in the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) have reported Q2 earnings, with 88% of these beating analyst expectations, according to FactSet. This quarter is shaping up to be another record-breaking one, with corporate earnings growth rate expected to accelerate 85%, which would be the biggest jump since the Q4 20009. \n\nHowever, it is important to note that, despite beating earnings expectations, a number of these companies have pulled back, with tepid outlooks moving forward overshadowing strong results. Moving forward, given that most companies have so far exceeded pre-pandemic levels and the current quarter has an easy comparison to last year, expectations for growth are inevitably going to moderate. This said, I think the pullback in some stocks following earnings is an overreaction. \n\nIn the last few weeks, concerns over the coronavirus Delta variant are increasing, which inevitably, has injected volatility in the markets. Last week, the CDC reversed their indoor mask policy. The agency now recommends that even fully vaccinated individuals begin once again wearing masks indoors in areas with high coronavirus transmission and in K-12 schools. Dr. Rochelle Walensky, Director of the CDC said, \u201cIn areas with substantial and high transmission, CDC recommends fully vaccinated people wear masks in public, indoor settings to help prevent the spread of the delta variant, and protect others. This includes schools\u201d. \n\nAs I have said before and will explain further below, while the surge in cases is unfortunate, it is important to note that the surge is largely concentrated in areas with high vaccine hesitancy. Moreover, while cases are surging, thankfully, hospitalizations and death rates are much lower when compared to previous surges, a sign that the vaccine is doing its job. While it doesn\u2019t prevent one from becoming infected, it greatly reduces the possibility for complications. \n\nIn the US, despite roughly 50% of the population being vaccinated, in the past two weeks, infections across the country have roughly doubled, with new cases jumping from 13,200 on July 4 to 78,433 as of July 31, according to data compiled by John Hopkins University. However, it is important to note, despite the surge the 7-day average of deaths is 360, once again according to John Hopkins University. \n\nAccording to data from the CDC, 97% of people who have died or been hospitalized with COVID-19 since the vaccine became widely available are unvaccinated. Dr Rochelle Walensky, Director of CDC said of the rising cases, \u201cThere is a clear message that is coming through. This is becoming a pandemic of the unvaccinated. Our biggest concern is we are going to continue to see preventable cases, hospitalizations, and sadly deaths among the unvaccinated.\u201d Sadly, despite the widespread availability of the vaccine in the US, hesitancy in certain places remains very high.\n\nMoreover, last week, the Fed released its July Monetary Policy Report largely reiterated what members of the Fed have been saying for months, but did include some new language hinting that the economic recovery is getting closer to the Fed\u2019s stated goals. The report also acknowledged potential risks and stated the Fed was ready to act if \u201cappropriate risks arise\u201d. The statement read, \u201cIn assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee's goals. The Committee's assessments will take into account a wide range of information, including readings on public health, labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments.\u201d\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* In a big industry move, Square (SQ) acquired Australian fin-tech company Afterpay, which allows customers to pay in installments, for $29 billion in an all-stock transaction. Square released a statement that read, \u201cSquare plans to integrate Afterpay into its existing Seller and Cash App business units, enable even the smallest of merchants to offer BNPL \\[buy now, pay later\\] at checkout, give Afterpay consumers the ability to manage their installment payments directly in Cash App, and give Cash App customers the ability to discover merchants and BNPL offers directly within the app.\u201d\n* Along with the Afterpay announcement, SQ unexpectedly announced Q2 earnings, which showed gross profit growing 91% thanks to strong Cash App and Seller ecosystem growth. The company reported revenue of $4.68 billion, 87% growth year-on-year but below the the $5.03 billion expected. Earnings per share skyrocketed to $0.66 compared to $0.30 expected.\n* Google announced it was moving away from Qualcomm (QCOM) and would begin manufacturing its own in-house processors for new Pixel phones launching later this year. This follows a similar move to what Apple (AAPL) did to Intel (INTC).\n* Ford Motors (F) Chief Financial Officer John Lawler said the company hopes to reinstate a dividend by the end of the year. He said, \u201cWe've had a really tough period of time here the last couple of years with Covid last year and now the chip shortage. We plan to bring the dividend back as soon as we can...depending on how the second half goes with \\[computer\\] chips, it could be as early as the end of this year.\u201d Ford suspended its dividend last year.\n* Electric vehicle sales in China more than tripled in July compared to a year ago. \n   * Nio delivered 7,931 vehicles in July, 124% increase YoY\n   * Xpeng (XPEV) delivered 8,040 vehicles, 228% increase YoY\n   * Li (LI) delivered 8,589 vehicles, 251% increase YoY\n* \\*\\***Please note that current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect closing prices\\*\\***\n* Abbvie (ABBV) with two target raises.

        "selftext": "In my last post, I went over how to value stocks based on the discounted cash flow of a company. If you haven't read it yet, [start here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/o8ygn4/how_stocks_are_valued_part_1_discounted_cash_flow/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) This post will go over ***relative valuation***, rather than the absolute value of a company.\n\n# Comparables\n\nWhen you're buying a house, how do you determine what the fair value of the house is? Appraisers often look at similar homes in the neighborhood to get an idea of how much the house should be worth.\n\nIf the house on 123 Potato Street were similar to all the other houses on Potato Street but was selling for 20% more than the average, odds are it's not going to sell. This concept of comparing assets to similar assets also applies in stock valuation.\n\n# How Do We Compare Stocks?\n\nRemember that stocks just represent a fraction of a company's future earnings. For similar companies with similar industries, earnings, and, $1 in earnings for company A should be worth the same as $1 of earnings for company B.\n\nA lemonade stand that makes $10 on Potato Street should be worth about the same to an investor as a lemonade stand that makes $10 somewhere else in the same neighborhood. If one is valued at $100 and the other at $120, the first lemonade stand might be undervalued.\n\nThere are several metrics we can use to compare stocks. Some ratios include:\n\n1. Price to Earnings (P/E). This ratio is calculated by dividing the stock price by its earnings per share. For example, WFC and BAC are (at a glance) similar companies since they're both in the same industry. It makes sense that they have similar P/E ratios, with WFC at 13.16 and BAC at 12.83. However, we see that BAC is relatively cheaper as we pay less for each dollar of earnings compared to WFC.\n2. Price to Sales (P/S). This is similar to P/E, except that we compare the stock price to the revenue of a company instead of its earnings. This is good for companies that aren't profitable yet, since comparing negative P/E ratios seems a bit silly. Uber, for example, has a P/S of 7.40. If we use only P/S to compare Uber to Lyft, which has a P/S of 8.71, UBER seems to be the better investment since we're paying less for each dollar of revenue.\n3. Price to Earnings Growth (PEG). This ratio measures the stock price as a ratio to the company's earnings growth (typically over the next 1-3 years). This ratio is calculated as the P/E divided by the earnings growth rate. For example, if AAPL has a P/E of 28.3x and a growth rate of 1.3%, AAPL has a PEG of 22.6x. MSFT has a higher P/E (35.09x), but because of its higher growth rate of 8.9%, has a much lower PEG of 3.92x.\n\nWe can use these ratios (and others) to identify whether stocks are relatively undervalued compared to other similar stocks, or we can compare stocks to the industry average. If we buy companies that are relatively cheaper compared to their peers, we should (in theory) perform better over time.\n\n# Short Term Relative Value Trading Strategies\n\nWe can also make relative value in the short term. \n\nA common retail trader\u2019s strategy is to buy a stock for a few days or a few weeks, hoping to scalp a few dollars and turn a profit. However, what if the market drops? Your stock could outperform the market by only falling 3% while the market falls by 10%. You were right but you still lost money due to your market exposure.\n\nHedge funds also bet on stocks, except instead of looking for a return on a single stock, they bet on stocks going up or down relative to another. They buy stock A and short-sell stock B, hoping A will outperform B. This is aptly named the Long-Short trading strategy or the pairs trade. If A falls 3% but B drops 5%, the hedge fund makes money overall.\n\n# Short Term Relative Value Trade Examples\n\nHow can we apply this to our trading? What if we think GME will outperform AMC? At $161 its may or may not be a good idea to be strictly long GME. However, we can hedge by shorting AMC. If all meme stocks crash, we still make money as long as GME doesn\u2019t fall as much as AMC does. If GameStop stays flat, we make money when AMC falls. (Of course, if you think AMC is the winner you can just inverse the above strategy)\n\nWe can apply this strategy to stocks in similar industries such as GM/F, V/MA, and KO/PEP.\n\nA second example would be a pairs trade I closed earlier last week.\n\nGoogle has two classes of (publicly traded) shares: GOOGL (Class A) which has voting rights, and GOOG (Class C) which has none.\n\nTheoretically, GOOGL should always be more expensive because they have voting rights, but because Alphabet is conducting share buybacks of GOOG exclusively, GOOGL was cheaper for a while - [We can see this in the trading view chart here.](https://imgur.com/a/Qng5vyG)\n\nBy buying GOOGL and shorting GOOG, I\u2019m betting the gap between the two stocks will close. I don\u2019t care if the market rises, falls, or goes sideways. I don\u2019t even care if google falls 50%. The only thing I\u2019m betting on is that GOOGL will be the same price as GOOG eventually, and after Alphabet announced it would start buybacks of both share classes, the gap closed.",

        "selftext": "[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-03/tencent-plummets-as-chinese-crackdown-fears-persist?utm\\_medium=social&amp;cmpid=socialflow-twitter-business&amp;utm\\_content=business&amp;utm\\_campaign=socialflow-organic&amp;utm\\_source=twitter](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-03/tencent-plummets-as-chinese-crackdown-fears-persist?utm_medium=social&amp;cmpid=socialflow-twitter-business&amp;utm_content=business&amp;utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&amp;utm_source=twitter)\n\nThere's been a lot of FUD talk recently about the extra risks of putting your money in Chinese stocks. These risks stem from the whipsaw regulatory caprices of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). Well, now, here's some more of that same talk.\n\nChinese gaming stocks were in free fall after CCP state-run media (like most large companies, media in China is subject to state control) suddenly referred to gaming as \"spiritual opium,\" and then deleted the remark, letting shares regain some of their losses. Deleted or not, this pronouncement harbinges future CCP crackdown and intervention in names like Tencent, Bilibili, and XD. The CCP sparked similar fears recently vis-a-vis Chinese tech and internet names, as well as education names, see, e.g. [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/23/us-listed-china-education-stocks-plunge-as-beijing-regulators-crack-down.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/23/us-listed-china-education-stocks-plunge-as-beijing-regulators-crack-down.html) . The CCP has particularly targeted foreign listed companies for crackdown, especially those listed in the US. Again, the message could not be clearer: China has placed foreign--and, especially, US--investors in its crosshairs. The CCP is purposefully swinging its weight around to remind everyone who is in control in China; this is their overriding concern, to maintain control. It would not do to have Jack Ma, for example, stand up to Secretary General Xi the way, say, Mark Zuckerberg recently stood up to a certain orange-hued Tariff Man by banning him from FB. The CCP is about maintaining power and face: it is not about to let such a thing happen, even if it has to inflict a lot of pain on a lot of people.\n\nNow, there is nothing wrong with government deciding on and implementing policy to shape its society in a given way, and there is nothing wrong with government incentivizing the public to go along with it; that is indeed the nature and essence of government, and every government has the right to do this, including the CCP. We have heard they wish to curb monopoly power among the tech sector; to make education more broadly available to meet public demand by nationalizing those services; and now, it appears, they wish to curb the influence of gaming among the Chinese populace. All well and good.\n\nThe problem here, however, is that the CCP does not do this in a measured, deliberate, transparent, and predictable way; it instead acts whimsically and capriciously, without warning and without any attempt to gradually telegraph its plans to the investing public so that the market has time to react in a more measured fashion. This stands in stark contradistinction to the deliberative, telegraphed, and gradual process that marks US and European lawmaking and regulation, where statutes like the US' Administrative Procedures Act (APA) mandate public comment and interactive dialogue in regulated industries. The CCP's willingness to act in such a way is deliberate: the party moves swiftly and without warning not only to implement its goals as expeditiously as possible, but also to remind people--and especially foreign and US investors--who is in charge. Lack of reciprocity thoroughly characterizes the Chinese/Rest-of-the-World relationship, and this business with the gaming stocks today is one more example of that lack of reciprocity; other governments do not treat Chinese investors like China treats its foreign investors. It would not surprise me if the CCP turned around and ordered app stores to remove gaming apps within a week, just as was done with Didi.\n\nMany other r-slurs and I have reminded our fellows that the CCP could nullify the VIE contracts that allow Chinese companies to trade on US exchanges; they could pocket all your hard-earned money in a heartbeat, just as quickly as they've struck out at gaming industries today. Far be it from me to tell you where to put your money. But today's action vis-a-vis Tencent and other gaming companies presents another opportunity to repeat: be aware of the outsized regulatory and governmental risks imposed by the CCP if you are going to go long on juicy-looking Chinese stocks.\n\nVarious obligatory INB4s:\n\n\"Gosh, Romulus Augustus, China wouldn't shoot itself in the foot and injure its standing in the world by bilking foreign investors and taking all their money, leaving them high and dry.\" Recall what was done with the National Security Law in Hong Kong, in violation of a treaty the CCP signed (see one such recent arrest pursuant to that law: [https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/hong-kong-investigates-china-anthem-booing-during-olympics-broadcast-mall-2021-07-30/](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/hong-kong-investigates-china-anthem-booing-during-olympics-broadcast-mall-2021-07-30/)) . Recall also that the CCP signed the Paris Accords, and before the ink on their signature was even dry, turned immediately around and built a metric ass-ton (yes, that's a technical unit of measurement) of new coal plants: [https://e360.yale.edu/features/despite-pledges-to-cut-emissions-china-goes-on-a-coal-spree](https://e360.yale.edu/features/despite-pledges-to-cut-emissions-china-goes-on-a-coal-spree) . The CCP does not care overmuch for niceties or proprieties: they will think nothing of lulling you, and then taking your money and rugpulling you without compunction or hesitation if they deem the time is right.\n\n\"Gosh, Romulus Augustus, China is just getting several monopolistic and socially toxic industries under control, you should want the increased competition and improved Chinese society that will come from these measures.\" As I said before, all well and good. But do it in a measured, telegraphed, transparent, and predictable way: don't make a point of purposefully rugpulling and whipsawing foreign investors in a way other governments don't do with Chinese investors.\n\n\"Gosh, Romulus Augustus, isn't this just racist and anti-Chinese? Why are you so bigoted against Chinese people? #StopAsianHate. \" It\u2019s racist to point out that the CCP is bilking investors here of *all* ethnicities and creeds? I think not. Moreover, lobbing this accusation is a common wumao ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/50\\_Cent\\_Party)/tankie/](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/50_Cent_Party)/tankie/) r/ sino tactic often used on social media. They\u2019ve learned they can deflect from the CCP\u2019s misdeeds by crying that any criticism of the government or enterprise is racist. But like Eric Carmen and the Raspberries, let's go all the way! Assume I am indeed a racist (I\u2019m not). How does that factually alter, rebut, or contend with the substance of anything I\u2019ve said here?\n\n\"Gosh, Romulus Augustus, don't you wish the US government had taken some action against its bad apples like Enron, Theranos, Your Hometown Deli, Lordstown, et al.?\" Someone will inevitably bring up Enron like they always do when this topic comes up, and, like always, it will drive me absolutely nuts. Besides the fact Enron was decades ago, it spawned disclosure and accounting laws that American companies now must comply with. Elizabeth Holmes (and that affected husky voice I'm sure some of you degens around here have busted one out to) is facing down a court for the shit she pulled with Theranos. NKLA somehow still has a 4 billion market cap despite Trevor Milton's crazy lies and fraudulent statements for which he's now facing criminal charges. Again, the US takes action against its bad apples in a measured, orderly, transparent way when compared with the CCP.\n\nI can already hear xupamos87, BVB\\_TallMorty, and the China Apologist/China Bull Crew now: \"Gosh, Romulus Augustus, the Chinese stocks present a great opportunity, boast great fundamentals, and I've already realized sick gains on DOYU and NIO and a whole host of others!\" More power to you! I'm glad you made money off these names! But that's besides the point of this post and other posts on this topic. The overarching point is, the CCP imposes regulatory risks and rugpulls foreign investors in a way that other governments don't do to Chinese investors: the point of this and other similar posts is to describe this risk if you're going to try to make money off these names, and also to point out the lack of reciprocity between China and the rest of the world. And as for the stellar fundamentals, well, they are cheap for a reason.\n\n\"Gosh, Romulus Augustus, the CCP has made clear it wants to work more closely with US regulators like the SEC to clean up its act and become more transparent.\" OK. Words are great, but actions are better. At this point in time, it sounds like a strategic attempt to lull US investors into a sense of security before yet another rug gets pulled or more foreign money gets siphoned off. Remember how I said above that the CCP signed the Paris Accords and then turned around and built more coal plants? (See, e.g., [https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-50474824](https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-50474824) ). It strikes me the same is going on here with promises of greater transparency and cooperation with the SEC. China lulled the rest of the world into hamstringing itself to meet agreed-upon emissions targets while going full-steam (or coal) ahead on its own plans. Lull into a sense of security, then go back on your word in bad faith, and then pull ahead while others are struggling behind in an attempt to conform in good faith to the agreement and mutual commitments made.\n\n\"Gosh, Romulus Augustus, the US is so awful compared to China, how can you trash China and not recognize the US is evil, racist, and has done terrible things in the past?\" I hear this one a lot from younger-sounding Gen Z folks and tankies whenever the topic of China treating foreign investors poorly is brought up. I don't dispute the US bears its share of sin. But we are talking about problems today that are directly affecting all of us and our money. And China behaves less transparently and fairly towards foreign investors in its companies than the US behaves towards Chinese investors in US companies. That is the problem, and it is a problem that deserves addressing, regardless of what the US has or has not done.\n\nBottom Line: Be very, very aware of the outsized regulatory risks posed by the CCP that you will not face from the US or EU governments. Factor those risks accordingly into your personal risk tolerance matrix when going long Chinese stocks.",

        "selftext": "Recently, Bright Health Group landed on the New York Stock Exchange and made $924 million in its initial public offering. The IPO pricing values Bright Health at $11.23 billion, according to\u00a0[a report](https://www.reuters.com/legal/transactional/tiger-global-backed-bright-health-raises-924-mln-us-ipo-2021-06-24/)\u00a0from Reuters. The startup insurer initially priced its IPO at $18 per share, and issued 51.3 million shares. At present, Bright Health's stock price is $16.7 and the market value is $10.277 billion.\n\nFounded in 2015, Bright Health is a medical health insurance and technology company. Through cooperation with top suppliers in the medical system, it establishes connections between medical consumers and suppliers, and is committed to providing users with reasonable medical insurance solutions\u00a0and high-quality medical services through advanced technology.\n\nThe company raised $500 million in a late-stage funding round in September last year from investors such as Tiger Global Management, T. Rowe Price Associates and Blackstone Group Inc\u00a0[(BX.N)](https://www.reuters.com/companies/BX.N), bringing total equity raised to over $1.5 billion.\n\nIn 2020, Bright Health generated more than 1.2 billion U.S. dollars in revenue, an increase of more than three times compared with the 280 million U.S. dollars in 2019. The total revenue for the first quarter of 2021 was US$874.6 million. While revenue has increased, the company's losses have been expanding. From 2018 to 2020, the company lost 62.6 million U.S. dollars, 125.3 million U.S. dollars and 248.4 million U.S. dollars, respectively, and its net loss almost doubled.\n\n**Business Model: 2C+2B**\n\nBright Health runs two businesses, NeueHealth(2B)\u00a0and Bright HealthCare(2C). In particular, Bright HealthCare sells Medicare and commercial health insurance to about 623,000 consumers in\u00a014 states of\u00a0the United States. NeueHealth offers virtual and in-person clinical care to patients through affiliated primary care clinics.\n\n**Bright HealthCare: diverse strategies serve different groups of people**\n\nBright HealthCare offers health plans for individuals and families, small businesses and employees, and Medicare Advantage plans for seniors.\u00a0Five years ago, Bright Healthcare only offered a single product in one state, and the number of users was only 10,765. As of now, this department operates in 14 states across the United States, and plans to expand to more states by 2022.\n\nCurrently, Bright HealthCare provides health care benefits to approximately 623,000 consumers. Customers include: 1) Commercial customers. Bright HealthCare provides commercial health plans in 11 states, including personal and family plans and employer plans, serving approximately 515,000 people; 2) Medicare Advantage users. Bright HealthCare provides Medicare Advantage products in 11 states, serving approximately 108,000 people, usually focusing on high-risk groups with special needs.\n\nIn addition, Bright Healthcare operates a small Managed Medicaid business in California. Regarding self-funded employer support, Bright Healthcare is currently establishing ASO business (ASO, administrative services only) for self-paying employers through multiple strategic partners. Administrative services only (ASO) refers to an agreement that companies use when they fund their\u00a0[employee benefit plan](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/employer_sponsored_plan.asp)\u00a0but hire an outside vendor to administrate it. Bright Healthcare\u00a0believes that to continue expanding self-insurance market is\u00a0an important part of its diversification strategy. Bright HealthCare also participates in a number of specialized plans and is the nation\u2019s third largest provider of Chronic Condition Special Needs Plans (C-SNPs).\n\nFrom 2018 to 2020, Bright Healthcare\u2019s total premiums were US$127 million, US$272 million, and US$1.18 billion, with growth rates of 114.17% and 333.82%, respectively. The growth rate was tripled.\u00a0Its commercial insurance premium income was 111 million U.S. dollars, 236 million U.S. dollars, and 692 million U.S. dollars, with growth rates of 112.61% and 193.22%, respectively. Commercial premiums accounted for 87.64%, 86.77%, and 58.66% of total premiums, respectively, and their proportions dropped to about half in 2020. Medicare Advantage\u00a0premium income was 15.71 million U.S. dollars, 36.03 million U.S. dollars and 480 million U.S. dollars, with growth rates of 129.34% and 1232.42%, respectively. The growth rate in 2020 is particularly astonishing. MA premiums accounted for 12.36%, 13.23% and 41.34% of total premiums, respectively, and their proportions increased to nearly half in 2020.\n\nIn terms of users, the number of commercial users in 2020 was 145,000, and this number soared to 482,000 in the first quarter of 2021, an increase of 232.41%. The number of MA users was\u00a062,000, and reached 67,000\u00a0in the first quarter of 2021. Although Bright Health has achieved amazing growth in both premiums and the number of users, combined with its acquisitions, both the surge in users and the increase in premiums were driven by Bright Healthcare's acquisition of Brand New Day.  \n\n**NeueHealth: Healthcare services empower 2C business**\n\nNeueHealth is a comprehensive medical institution that provides local and personalized care services in a variety of ways. Its services include: \n\nIntegrated Care Delivery \u2014 Operating clinics that provide comprehensive care to all populations.\n\nBright Health Network \u2014Ecosystem of Care Partners.\n\nValue Services Organization \u2014 Empowering high-performing primary care practices and care delivery organizations to succeed in their evolution towards risk-bearing care delivery.\n\nIts income consists of two parts, namely service fees and premium income. Service fees\u00a0mainly refer to NeueHealth affiliated medical group\u2019s pay-for-service\u00a0income and\u00a0the network service income generated by Bright Health Network under NeueHealth; the premium income refers to NeueHealth\u2019s value service organization and its affiliated medical group\u2019s income from taking charge of patients\u2019\u00a0medical care.\n\nIn 2020, NeueHealth's service fee income was 29.35 million U.S. dollars, and premium income was 7.79 million U.S. dollars.\u00a0In the first quarter of 2021, service fee income increased by US$8.1 million year-on-year, reaching US$15.6 million, mainly due to the increase in revenue from the inter-company network contract service of the Bright HealthCare division. Premium income increased by US$26.7 million year-on-year, an increase of 1,330.8% to US$28.7 million. Similarly, the increase in revenue was driven by the acquisition of PMA.\n\nAs of April 2021, NeueHealth works with over 200,000 care provider partners and operates 28 managed and affiliated risk-bearing clinics within its integrated care delivery system. Through those risk-bearing clinics, NeueHealth maintains nearly 75,000 unique patient relationships as of April 2021, approximately\u00a030,000 of which are served through value-based arrangements, across multiple payors. In addition to the\u00a0directly managed and affiliated clinics, NeueHealth manages care for an additional 33 clinics through its Value Services Organization.\n\n**Competitive advantages: technology empowerment + extensive customer base + full chain**\n\nAfter summarizing Bright Health's business model, we found that the company's competitive advantages include: extensive customer base coverage, technological empowerment, and full-chain services.\n\nOn the customer side, Bright Healthcare offers plans covering all groups\u00a0of people. In particular, the currently developing Managed Medicaid business covers children and low-income groups; the personal and family plans in the business plan section cover self-employed and part-time groups; Medicare Advantage covers groups over 65 years old; and Employer ASO covers self-financing employer groups. At the same time, many of Bright Healthcare's professional programs target the chronically ill population.\u00a0In other words, regardless of customers\u2019\u00a0income, age, work or the way to obtain insurance, Bright Health can provide products or services in a direct or indirect manner.\n\nHowever, at present, Bright Healthcare\u2019s two largest customer groups are business plans and MA groups. Both in premium income and customer groups, business plans make up the most part. Products and services for other groups are still in their infancy, and the development of these product lines in the future will still require a lot of effort.\n\nIn technology, Bright Health\u00a0has developed\u00a0\u201cBright Health Intelligent Operating System\u201d or \u201cBiOS\u201d. It \u00a0refers to Bright Health\u2019s end-to-end intelligent technology platform comprised of consumer, care delivery, and administrative solutions, all designed to enable an integrated, aligned, and consumer-focused healthcare ecosystem.  \n\nBiOS uses the powerful data generated by Care Partner model to achieve integration of the healthcare system, including smart data center Consumer360 and the solution DocSquad for consumers and suppliers. \u201cConsumer360\u201d refers to Bright Health\u2019s proprietary intelligent data hub, which aggregates clinical and administrative data, as well as information derived from the consumer experience (i.e., from call center and other consumer interactions) and data relating to Social Determinants of Health. It could create a personalized digital care plan to empower DocSquad.  \n\n\n\u201cDocSquad\u201d refers to Bright Health\u2019s consumer and care provider solution, comprised of a purpose-built set of tools and experiences connecting consumers with the organizations responsible for their care, while giving providers a 360-degree view of a consumer to better manage their healthcare needs. Its services include virtual care, personalized care team, smart warning, and other healthcare services.\n\nAnother advantage of Bright Health is that\u00a0it both provides 2C and 2B services. On the one hand, it provides customers with Bright Healthcare\u00a0products, as well as customized and market-specific nursing services through NeueHealth's network and other healthcare providers. On the other hand, for business clients, NeueHealth helps healthcare providers gather consumers and provide care partners with multiple value propositions, while providing innovative tools and solutions to support population health management and development of value-based care. For payers, NeueHealth allows Bright HealthCare and other third-party payers to participate in value-based payment arrangements, while managing risk-bearing care delivery. It\u00a0provides payers with predictability of medical expenses, allowing them to focus more on benefit design and management.\n\nIn sum, Bright Health integrates financing and delivery of healthcare through the division and collaboration of the two departments, covering both payers\u00a0and suppliers. The payer\u2019s funding not only focuses on preventing losses, but also on creating overall consumer value and increasing access to medical care through effective resource allocation. Suppliers construct value-based arrangements that aim to reward the quality of care provided, rather than the number of services. It could\u00a0reduce the total cost of care and\u00a0improve\u00a0clinical outcomes.\n\n**Future challenges: loss doubles, and medical cost ratio increases**\n\nApart from\u00a0advantages, Bright Health is also facing some challenges. To achieve future development and even profitability, these challenges need to be overcome.\n\nFirst, the problem of customer groups. At present, the company's main customer base is divided into commercial\u00a0users and MA users. Commercial users\u2019,or personal insurance\u2019s\u00a0market share is relatively small, and the number of users in this market has grown rapidly after the enactment of Affordable Care Act. But in the later stage, the user group who cannot receive premium subsidies will have adverse selection.\u00a0The data shows that the total number of monthly registrations in the personal market increased from 10.6 million in 2013 to 17.4 million in 2015, reaching a peak, and then fell to 13.8 million in 2018. One reason is that from 2017 to 2018, insurance premiums rose sharply, and many people were unable to receive premium subsidies, so adverse selection occurred. Consistent with the number of users, operators that provide individual insurance plans have also seen a general trend of growth first and then decline, which also means that this market is very difficult for insurance companies.\n\nIn addition, there are many other participants in the personal insurance market, including Oscar Health, which went public not long ago. Although Bright Health claims to be able to compete with the former in terms of healthcare\u00a0networks, Oscar has 400,000 individual insurance members, just slightly less than that of Bright Health in personal insurance market.\n\nOn the other hand, the MA market is full of giants, and leading insurance companies occupy a large part of the market share, leaving Bright Health only a small part. Whether it is in personal\u00a0insurance or MA, customer acquisition\u00a0is quite\u00a0difficult, which is why Bright Health has adopted mergers and acquisitions to grow its customer base.\n\nAlthough Bright Health said it would expand to other customer groups, including self-funding\u00a0employer market and small business market, the development of these strategies is still in the early stages and has not been reflected in the company's financial data. In the future, much\u00a0resources must be invested, and even mergers and acquisitions and other means\u00a0will be necessary\u00a0to seize market share and customer base.\n\nIn addition, although Bright Health has both an insurance supply department and a medical service department, its medical cost ratio(MCR)\u00a0has been growing. From 2018 to 2020, the company's MCR\u00a0were 75.8%, 82.4% and 88.7%, which did not have any advantages compared with other companies. In other words, the company's efforts to control medical expenses through NeueHealth do not seem to have worked.\n\nThe company's operating costs have also been increasing. From 2018 to 2020, operating costs were US$95.83 million, US$180 million and US$410 million, respectively, with growth rates of 88% and 127%. With high medical expenses, coupled with increasing operating costs, the company still has a long way to go to achieve profitability.\n\nNevertheless, Bright Health is committed to controlling the entire value chain including users, payers and suppliers. This model is still a core competitiveness, which distinguishes it from competitors such as Oscar, and also reminds people\u00a0of United Health.\n\nWhat we can learn from Bright Health is its practice of complementing business through acquisitions. Bright Health turned NeueHealth into an independent department and constantly emphasizes the possibility of its future development. This differentiated department is built through continuous acquisitions. At present, 3% of the revenue contributed by this department is contributed by the acquisition department. Furthermore, the success of UnitedHealth Group is also on the basis of continuous acquisitions.\n\nAnother lesson\u00a0is the construction and integration of technology platforms. The intelligent\u00a0platform built by Bright Health integrates users, payers, and suppliers, and its solutions for suppliers or patients, such as applications, are based on this\u00a0platform. It aggregates\u00a0all user data and claims data to achieve transparent exchange and empowerment of data.\n\nBright Health\u2019s future is worth looking forward to.",

Their GAAP MCR reported was 107.6% (but that\u2019s taking into account COVID-19 costs; without which was only 95.4%). Their expenses was $104.6 million, but that was \u201cprimarily due to an increase in non-cash stock-based compensation to certain executives in relation to the merger\u201d with SPAC. Which won\u2019t be on Q2 financials. Their GAAP net loss was $(48.4M) but that was primarily due to the fact the SEC made them change warrants to a liability in their balance sheet, which since have been redeemed and will affect their bottom line significantly (won\u2019t be a liability any longer). Their EBITDA (earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortization) was ($76.2M) with COVID-19; without it would\u2019ve been only ($52.1M).

A reconciliation of projected normalized MCR (medical cost ratio, low number is better) to GAAP MCR cannot by calculated because of COVID-19. Which we did see a decrease in COVID-19 so those numbers can\u2019t be anywhere close to Q1. Th numbers are going to be awesome. Revenue will be higher than estimated ($205.39 Q2) because of estimated $20-30M due to direct contacting. And costs will be lower because Q1 included compensation to executives by way of non-cash stock-basis. They will show that even with COVID-19 costs, with their membership growth already at their estimates for the whole year, operating expenses what they really will be moving forward without the stock compensation, and warrant liability accounted for.

        "selftext": "Disclaimer: Only my opinions, not a financial advisor, not a recommendation to buy, all information is accurate to the best of my limited knowledge.\n\n**Overview of business:**\n\nAt its core, Poshmark is a platform that connects sellers of clothing with buyers. The founder, Manish Chandra often touts the \"social commerce\" element and continues to talk about social commerce as this is where he believes the moat of the business is. I wish he would stop, Poshmark isn't about social commerce, the true moat is empowerment.\n\n**My experience with Poshmark:**\n\nDuring the Pandemic, I grew interested in vintage clothing and began buying stuff on resale platforms and reselling it to an audience I've built on Instagram. I sell on instagram because most of the things I sell are $200+ and I find my margins to be around 40% so if I were to make $100 gross profit on a $200 sale and net $80 after shipping and other expenses, selling on a platform like Poshmark wouldn't makes sense as the fee to do so would be 20% of sale price: $40 on a $200 sale, AKA half my net profit. My resale activity is extremely niche and not a scaleable business. What I have found in doing it is that I need to source my inventory and I have bought items on Poshmark, Depop, Mercari, Ebay, Etsy, Grailed, and Facebook Marketplace. Ebay takes the cake, I find the most stuff on there and whenever I have tried to sell I move stuff quickest on Ebay. Poshmark is a close second. Over the winter I found the supply of stuff I could buy cheap on Poshmark and flip on Instagram outstanding. For the longest time, I couldn't understand why all these people would sell things on Poshmark as the percentage of each sale they take is the highest compared to their online marketplace competitors. Poshmark takes 20% of every sale above $15 and a flat $2.95 for sales below $15. Ebay takes around 10-15% (they have recently cut PayPal out of the payment processing and are now charging more and I know a lot of sellers are not happy). Etsy also has a long and complicated breakdown of what they charge, but its less than 20%, Grailed &amp; Depop take 10%, and Facebook marketplace takes 5%.\n\nSo why would anyone in their right mind sell something on Poshmark and pay a 20% fee when they could sell it on Facebook Marketplace and pay a 5% fee?\n\nIsn't this whole industry about to compete in a race to the bottom where one platform with resources (like Facebook) can undercut the others and then another platform does the same until there is no profit left in the industry?\n\nWhen I heard Poshmark was going to IPO I was thinking about buying puts or avoiding the stock altogether as my answer to these questions was people will move from where the fees are highest to where they are lowest. Because of this straightforward incentive, platforms will undercut each other until there is no profit and eventually there will be consolidation. When conducting some light DD on this thesis I spoke to a number of Poshmark sellers and did some digging, I changed my mind and went long shares at $75, then again at $68, then again at $62, then again at $57, then again at $56, then again at $47. Now, I am holding a massive bag of shit. When the stock crashed after Q1 earnings I was feeling very discouraged and although I was not considering selling, the 40% loss on my position stung. But, after seeing the stock crater another 8% yesterday on news they are planning to expand into India, I felt that maybe I should take a look at call prices. Before we get into options plays, I want to try and articulate what caused me to feel bullish about the stock.\n\n**Poshmark's Competitive Advantage**\n\nPoshmark's CEO, Manish Chandra, touts social commerce and \"posh parties\" similar to Tupperware parties as one of their key differentiators. I get a notification on my phone everyday that one of these parties is going on but I haven't been able to figure out what its about.\n\nI see Poshmark's competitive advantages differently. Three come to mind.\n\nThe first is how easy it is to list an item on Poshmark. Take a photo, check a few boxes, name a price, and post. Compared to Ebay which is incredibly labor intensive and involves so many categories and sub-categories, Poshmark streamlines the process through having an efficient and easy to use UI.\n\nThe second competitive advantage is how easy it is for Poshmark sellers to ship items. Buyers pay for shipping and it is a flat rate of $7.45. When an item is sold on poshmark the buyer has to pay instantly (ebay does not have this feature and as a result sellers say 10%+ of items sold have buyers that do not pay and they have to go through the process of canceling and re-listing). When the item is sold Poshmark E-mails a shipping label to you, all you have to do is print it out and tape it on ANY box or packaging and either drop it at USPS or have them pick it up. It is incredibly easy.\n\nBoth of these attributes remove the barriers to entry that new sellers face. When you get started you want it to be easy and straightforward. Incredibly, Ebay and other platforms have fee structures that are difficult to understand, platforms that are difficult to use, and most require a PayPal to be set up as well.\n\nThe third competitive advantage is by far the most important and hardest to create and sustain. Poshmark has a fiercely loyal and passionate user base of sellers who swear by the platform. Some become \"[Poshmark ambassadors](https://support.poshmark.com/s/article/How-do-I-become-a-Posh-Ambassador?language=en_US)\" and receive next to nothing for being ambassadors. They do it because they love the platform. I have tried in vain to convince sellers to go around the platform. Consider a $200 item, if they sell it on Poshmark, they will net $160. If I am willing to pay $175 through PayPal and try and convince them it's a win win as I save $25 and they'll make $15 more, I should stand ready to take the wrath of the Poshmark ambassador who will report me to Poshmark and decline my offer.\n\nLet's take a closer look at this third competitive advantage and see if it can help answer my question about why sellers would choose to sell on a platform that charges them a higher percentage of each sale. Why would they also loyally defend and promote this platform for few tangible benefits?\n\nThe answer is has to do more with psychology than with financial logic. The reason Poshmark was able to grow and compete is due to the first two competitive advantages I listed: it's easy to list, it's easy to ship, (and easy to get paid). Because it's easy to use sellers tell other sellers and buyers become sellers. We live in a market economy and with the rise of social media, large internet companies, and superstar founder entrepreneurs, the lives of entrepreneurs and the value they bring to society has been glorified. I think most people want to participate in the market economy, they want to be an entrepreneur, be their own boss, or have a \"side hustle\". Unfortunately, it's not easy and the few that succeed stand on a pile of failed ventures and crushed dreams. Poshmark makes it easy. Poshmark enables people who have been excluded from the wealth generating aspects of the online internet economy into successful participants. Broadly, those who haven't benefited from this new globalized economy have been: Women, racial minorities, geographic minorities (south, midwest). The demographics of Poshmark sellers and users closely align with those who have been excluded. The vast majority of Poshmark sellers are women, I was unable to find an exact number but in Poshmark's [2020 social commerce report](https://www.report.poshmark.com/) a survey conducted by Zogby Analytics had a user response rate that was 97% female. In this same report, Poshmark states that \"the south dominates\" and that 35% of sellers live in the south and 37% of buyers live in the south. [Poshmark's real product is empowerment.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRVNdxz_thk) Their platform empowers women and minorities (racial and geographic) by making it easy for them to feel successful and have a side hustle. Empowerment is an incredible feeling for those who haven't felt it before and Poshmark makes it possible for millions to feel this way.\n\n**Why Wall Street Misunderstands Poshmark**\n\nIn order to find an investment that can provide outsized returns, it's important to have an information advantage over the consensus view. Wall Street does not understand this stock because broadly speaking Wall Street is an information laggard when it comes to valuing companies that provide products and services primarily to women. I've made similar investments in Lululemon and Revolve that have preformed extremely well as the consensus changed. As investors have seen this pattern play out over and over Wall Street investors have started to \"ask their wife\" or \"pay attention to their daughter\" in looking for innovative companies. The problem with Poshmark's stock is that the types of people who work on Wall Street analyzing stocks and their wives don't use poshmark, and neither do their daughters.\n\nWhen I was looking into the management at Poshmark I noticed Serena Williams is a board member. I am an avid tennis fan and as such I have a favorite player: Roger Federer. Everyone loves Federer, he is a class act and attracts sponsorships from the likes of Rolex, Mercedes, Netjets, Rimowa, Swiss coffee machine makers, and has an ownership stake in On Running. These are brands Wall Streeters love! Serena Williams has a different public perception. On court she in an incredible competitor with a lot of passion which sometimes translates into dramatic meltdowns and aggressive behavior towards [umpires](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx9iT1OQMl0) and [linesmen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNwc7o_0Sgg). She has sponsorships from Nike, Gatorade, PUMA, Wilson, Pepsi etc. The respective brand deals the players have represent their public image and who they will be most effective in marketing towards. Serena Williams\u2019s image is used to target a demographic of consumers that is antithetical to the types of people Roger Federer\u2019s image is used for. Think about who evaluates and writes research on stocks. Its Federer fans, it's Rolex wearing, Swiss latte sipping 25-50 year olds who love the class and sophistication of Federer. Now think about the users of Poshmark, its young women, women of color, and women living in geographic areas that have taken a lot of the brunt of globalization. Serena Williams is the perfect match for Poshmark as she represents their user demographics much better than Federer ever could. But, Wall Street loves Federer and therefore has overlooked this stock.\n\n**Financials and Valuation**\n\nEtsy recently bought Depop for 1.6B when Depop had 70M in revenue in the previous year. This equates to a Price to Sales ratio of 22.85. Poshmark's market cap at its current share price of $36.25 is 2.72 Billion. Last year they did 262M in revenue For a P/S ratio of 10.3. Remember, Depop is an inferior platform for sellers and barely has a useable website. Why did it sell for double to P/S ratio Poshmark is selling for now?\n\n**Potential Catalysts / The Set Up**\n\nPoshmark is expanding across the globe entering multiple new markets each year. Yesterday, 8/2, [Poshmark announced they will be expanding into India](https://investors.poshmark.com/news/news-details/2021/Poshmark-Inc.-Announces-India-Expansion-as-Part-of-a-Continued-Focus-on-New-Market-Opportunities/default.aspx) and the stock tanked 7.5%.\n\nA few months ago Poshmark announced a [partnership with Snapchat](https://investors.poshmark.com/news/news-details/2021/Poshmark-Inc.-and-Snap-Inc.-Partner-to-Bring-Social-Shopping-to-Snapchat/default.aspx). I am very excited about this partnership as I am bullish on Facebook and Snapchat and see commerce as an important new opportunity for both of these platforms.\n\nPoshmark is also expanding horizontally into different categories such as pets and home and because of their asset light model they can throw shit at the wall and see what sticks.\n\nSet up wise, this is more of a reopening play than a covid play but it is being looked at and valued as if it should've benefited from the lockdowns. Because Poshmark is an E-commerce company, Wall Street has been harsh on them for not growing as fast as some of their \"peers\". Except their \"peers\" aren't true peers as sites like Etsy are more diversified in the products sold on their platform with a heavier weight on arts and crafts and other activities that thrive when people have more time at home. Clothing is not something people look to buy when stuck at home. As the economy continues to reopen and people start working and going out again sales will pick up. This very well may be reflected in Q2 earnings.\n\nShort interest is 30% (4.75M/15M outstanding as of 7/15). I am not looking at this trade as a short squeeze but if shorts do decide to cover the stock could begin to run and run fast.\n\n**The Trade**\n\nShares are the safest play. There are limited options available on Poshmark with spreads I could drive a truck through. The furthest out are Feb 18, 2022. $65 is the highest strike available. Because of the spreads, uncertainty of when an upside move will occur, and lack of long dated options, I only own shares. Second Quarter earnings are coming up on 8/10 with guidance of $79.0 million - $81.0 million in Revenue and $1.5 million - $2.5 million in Adjusted EBITDA. I am fairly confidant they will beat the guidance they set for themselves but unsure if this will result in a massive move to the upside. I think it could take more time.\n\nI have a fairly high conviction in this trade and am posting to get feedback and thoughts from others, that said Poshmark is only 10%+ of my portfolio and I want to crowdsource my ideas a bit more before I buy options or decide to sell other investments to buy more.\n\n**TLDR**\n\nPoshmark empowers women. This is their competitive advantage. Wall Street doesn't get this.O",

But for now they don't lend any shares. That was a relief at least...\n\nThat being said, I just wanted to have opinions on that matter...since etoro is the only app i found that works for me. Since I am Canadian living abroad, it's pretty complicated, as Canada is blocking almost all transactions related to the Stock Market, so if you want to use a Canadian address in etoro, it doesn't work. I had to open a Skrill account, and use Skrill to put money in my etoro account, even paypal canada blocks everything related to stocks. \n\nSo yea, I took a look into Fidelity, but on the Google store there are like many Fidelity apps, it's hard to know which one is the actual Fidelity that everybody keeps talking about.",

I have little to no experience in economics/investing, though I am reading books about investing, several yt channels, and have been wondering what is the best way to start off.

        "selftext": "This is not investing advice. All thoughts are my own. Do your own due diligence before investing. \n\nThe e-commerce theme has been good to us ordinary retail investors who have been all over the usual suspects. AMZN and SHOP have been spectacular. Industrial warehouse REITs like PLD have been beasts.   PYPL is killing it. Even old school retailers like WMT owe their resurgence in part to its pivot towards e-commerce. \n\nShopping is moving online and that is not changing anytime soon. But the old e-commerce names have a lot of this good news baked in already. GXO is a brand new name and still seems like its flying under the radar - literally it just got spun out of XPO. \n\nNot sure why but the spin out has not been received as much airtime as I would have thought. Part of this is that spin-outs are not as flashy as IPOs but still. Given GXO is a unique pure play on e-commerce I would have anticipated more noise but its hardly been talked about. \n\nThe uniqueness of the business is worth talking about because it operates in a somewhat niche area of warehouse outsourcing where its hi-tech capabilities (automation expertise) differentiate it materially from the smaller players. \n\nBasically big companies with growing e-commerce businesses go to GXO to outsource their logistics to them. GXO works with their clients to identify warehouses, leases those warehouses and then brings in their expertise to manage the asset for the client through the introduction of appropriate automation. GXO are experts in tech-enabled logistics. They are not an industrial real estate play like PLD. They are the experts in squeezing the most efficiency out of each square foot of warehouse space on behalf of their customers. \n\nTAM is massive. Right now the company only represents approx. 5% of the outsourced logistics market which the company estimates is $130bn TAM. Through M&amp;A they will grow that slice of the pie (more on that in the catalysts section). \n\nThe bigger TAM opportunity is the $300bn of currently insourced logistics. Think big box retailers currently owning their own warehouses, managing their own shipping and returns, dealing with the associated HR burden and trying to figure out how to automate the whole thing (not their specialty). These big box retailers are realizing that in order to grow fast they can outsource all of this to experts like GXO, which frees up capital and time and effort to focus on their core businesses. \n\nThe stock has done well post the spin off last week but here are some catalysts to look forward to:\n\n1) Research coverage. Expect analysts to be writing about this stock soon as it can not be ignored. What will be interesting is how the analysts value this company vs other e-commerce facilitators because it is currently in a league of its own. \n\n2) M&amp;A. The company has said it needed its own balance sheet to pursue inorganic growth and now it has that. Lots of fragmentation means consolidation opportunities. \n\n3) New business wins. The company said its pipeline is the highest its ever been. Expect that pipeline to convert into new mandates.",

        "selftext": "Howdy SPAC-folk, \n\nI am curious if we have any other Payoneer investors in here anymore?  For those who don't remember, Payoneer went public through one of Betsy Cohen's SPACS (I believe ticker was FTAC or FTOC) a month or two ago.  I'm pretty pumped to see their Q2 results after market close this Wednesday as well as their forecasts moving forward.\n\nA few quick stats:\n\n* Based in Israel\n* Payment processing/fintech company, mostly on the commercial side (vs personal) with seller clients ranging from AirBnb to Amazon.  \n* Revenue was just short of $100M in 2020, 2021 projected revenue is $400M+ (we'll see tomorrow if they're on track)\n* Deal was valued around $3B so not the biggest bargain but not the most insane either\n* Clients all seem to say good things about working with them and I see the B2B space as a little more \"sticky\" when compared to the B2C with already has PayPal, Venmo, Zelle, Apple Pay, and so many others\n\nAnother one of Betsy Cohen's SPACs is in the process of taking eToro (Israeli online stock brokerage) public and I am hoping that Payoneer gets a little more attention after ER, and perhaps because she continues to run through SPAC deals from companies that show promise.\n\nNo recommendations here, just wondering if anybody has done any thorough research worth mentioning and/or has any interesting thoughts to consider.  I am long shares and don't plan to sell unless something terrible is reported this week, as in fraud terrible or something else that would materially change their growth prospects.",

        "selftext": " \n\nHello investors,\n\nI am posting a revised version for clarification purposes.\n\nIn every stock analysis, there should be three key components.\n\n1. Durable competitive advantage\n2. Financial Analysis\n3. Valuation\n\nIn this post, I will be going over the first of the three: Identifying durable competitive advantage, which I would argue is the most important one out of the three because a company's financials and valuations are simply reflections of a company's competitive advantage.\n\nI've been noticing that a lot of people are leaving out some very important components to a stock analysis or taking big leaps in assumptions.\n\nFor instance, many people nowadays seem to be making premature conclusions along the lines of\n\n\"the US government is pushing for clean energy initiatives and therefore, Tesla stock will be going up\" or\n\n\"Amazon reported sales growth of 40% so the stock is a buy\" or\n\n\"Apple makes great phones and therefore, Apple stock is a great investment\".\n\nIf you've noticed, these statements are taking big leaps in assumptions. There are many factors that go into an investment decision and we need to think from multiple angles, not just a one-dimensional level such as \"Apple is introducing a new line of products and thus, Apple stock is a buy.\" We need a more in-depth analysis.\n\nI think the best way to learn is to take a look at an example analysis. This is an example copy of a one-pager stock pitch that covers all three elements: competitive advantage, financials, and valuation. For those who'd like a copy of this sample pitch please sign up to the email distribution list below and you'll receive a copy.\n\nA competitive advantage is when a company has an edge over its competitors. Most people would subscribe to Neflix over renting DVDs because it's much easier and cheaper to stream on Neflix than renting $10 DVDs. This is called competitive advantage.\n\nFor instance, a lemonade stand may have a competitive advantage over an orange juice stand because it can make lemonades at a cheaper cost than the orange juice stand.\n\nA Google's search engine has a competitive advantage over Microsoft's Edge due to the superior search algorithm and network effect.\n\nA durable competitive advantage is a company's edge that is a lasting one.\n\nTo use the previous examples, can the lemonade stand continue to produce lemonades at cheaper cost than orange juice stand?\n\nIs Google able to maintain its superior search algorithm and the network effect over time?\n\nA company with a durable competitive advantage is the one whose stock price will grow over time.\n\nIf a company's business model does not have a durable competitive advantage, it won't survive for the long-term, no matter how cheap you can buy it.\n\nIt's sort of like buying a company that produces flip phones. Remember these? Sure you could be buying this company at a bargain P/E of 3x but is it really a bargain? It produces an outdated device with no real competitive advantage over other products and therefore, it won't see any type of growth and its stock price will cater.\n\nBlackberry also may had a competitive advantage at some point and that's why it became so widely used.\n\nBut the advantage didn't last for long and it turns out the competitive advantage was not a durable one.\n\nEvery company you look at should have a clear, durable competitive advantage.\n\nFor instance, what's to keep Thor Industries, the largest manufacturer of recreational vehicles, to operate competitively?\n\nBecause it has the largest and most efficient manufacturing plants and largest dealership network in the world. There is a high barrier-to-entry for any new entrants to compete. Management has been known to be great capital allocators, meaning they know when to issue debt to build a new manufacturing plant, acquire a business, or buy back its own stock.\n\nThese points back up the claim that Thor has a durable competitive advantage and will keep the business growing.\n\nMy favorite way of identifying this edge is to try the product or service because a customer is usually the best judge of a value. You could easily try Starbucks, Shake Shack, and many other products from consumer companies.\n\nFor those that are business-facing like Salesforce, you can find surveys or product usages.\n\nMost of the times, however, a great product/service will always show traction in the early stages.\n\nAmazon, Facebook, and PayPal were gaining 200% new users every year in its early days.\n\nAmerican Express had a crazy growth in its early years as well.\n\nTake Upstart for example. And this is one of my favorite companies at the moment because it's in the sweet spot of growth and valuation.\n\nIt's growing sales at +90% clip yoy, that compares to avg 15% growth for its peer companies.\n\nWithout even testing out their product, I know something is working right with the products it's offering, as evidenced by the sales growth.\n\nOne important thing to be mindful of is that sometimes these growth can be non-organic, meaning the growth can be a result of acquisitions or aggressive marketing spending.\n\nIf you are growing your sales at 70% yoy but your user growth is only 40% yoy, that is a bad sign.\n\nAlternatively, if you are giving excessive concessions that your economics doesn't make sense, that's also an issue.\n\nFor instance, remember Moviepass? They were charging $10/month to watch an unlimited number of movies. While the user growth was exceptional, this model was clearly unsustainable and we should be wary of these kinds of business models.\n\nThe bottom line is that whenever you are looking to buy a stock of a company, the company should always have a durable competitive advantage in order for its stock to 10x in the next 5-10 years.\n\nPlease check out this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ad89G90NUzQ) on YouTube for a better-explained version and check out [r/Midasinvestors](https://www.reddit.com/r/Midasinvestors/) for steps 2 and 3!\n\nThank you all for reading and happy investing!",

        "selftext": "Disclaimer: Only my opinions, not a financial advisor, not a recommendation to buy, all information is accurate to the best of my limited knowledge. \n\n**Overview of business:**\n\nAt its core, Poshmark is a platform that connects sellers of clothing with buyers. The founder, Manish Chandra often touts the \"social commerce\" element and continues to talk about social commerce as this is where he believes the moat of the business is. I wish he would stop, Poshmark isn't about social commerce, the true moat is empowerment. \n\n**My experience with Poshmark:**\n\nDuring the Pandemic, I grew interested in vintage clothing and began buying stuff on resale platforms and reselling it to an audience I've built on Instagram. I sell on instagram because most of the things I sell are $200+ and I find my margins to be around 40% so if I were to make $100 gross profit on a $200 sale and net $80 after shipping and other expenses, selling on a platform like Poshmark wouldn't makes sense as the fee to do so would be 20% of sale price: $40 on a $200 sale, AKA half my net profit. My resale activity is extremely niche and not a scaleable business. What I have found in doing it is that I need to source my inventory and I have bought items on Poshmark, Depop, Mercari, Ebay, Etsy, Grailed, and Facebook Marketplace. Ebay takes the cake, I find the most stuff on there and whenever I have tried to sell I move stuff quickest on Ebay. Poshmark is a close second. Over the winter I found the supply of stuff I could buy cheap on Poshmark and flip on Instagram outstanding. For the longest time, I couldn't understand why all these people would sell things on Poshmark as the percentage of each sale they take is the highest compared to their online marketplace competitors. Poshmark takes 20% of every sale above $15 and a flat $2.95 for sales below $15. Ebay takes around 10-15% (they have recently cut PayPal out of the payment processing and are now charging more and I know a lot of sellers are not happy). Etsy also has a long and complicated breakdown of what they charge, but its less than 20%, Grailed &amp; Depop take 10%, and Facebook marketplace takes 5%.\n\nSo why would anyone in their right mind sell something on Poshmark and pay a 20% fee when they could sell it on Facebook Marketplace and pay a 5% fee?\n\nIsn't this whole industry about to compete in a race to the bottom where one platform with resources (like Facebook) can undercut the others and then another platform does the same until there is no profit left in the industry?\n\nWhen I heard Poshmark was going to IPO I was thinking about buying puts or avoiding the stock altogether as my answer to these questions was people will move from where the fees are highest to where they are lowest. Because of this straightforward incentive, platforms will undercut each other until there is no profit and eventually there will be consolidation. When conducting some light DD on this thesis I spoke to a number of Poshmark sellers and did some digging, I changed my mind and went long shares at $75, then again at $68, then again at $62, then again at $57, then again at $56, then again at $47. Now, I am holding a massive bag of shit. When the stock crashed after Q1 earnings I was feeling very discouraged and although I was not considering selling, the 40% loss on my position stung. But, after seeing the stock crater another 8% yesterday on news they are planning to expand into India, I felt that maybe I should take a look at call prices. Before we get into options plays, I want to try and articulate what caused me to feel bullish about the stock.\n\n**Poshmark's Competitive Advantage**\n\nPoshmark's CEO, Manish Chandra, touts social commerce and \"posh parties\" similar to Tupperware parties as one of their key differentiators. I get a notification on my phone everyday that one of these parties is going on but I haven't been able to figure out what its about.\n\nI see Poshmark's competitive advantages differently. Three come to mind.\n\nThe first is how easy it is to list an item on Poshmark. Take a photo, check a few boxes, name a price, and post. Compared to Ebay which is incredibly labor intensive and involves so many categories and sub-categories, Poshmark streamlines the process through having an efficient and easy to use UI.\n\nThe second competitive advantage is how easy it is for Poshmark sellers to ship items. Buyers pay for shipping and it is a flat rate of $7.45. When an item is sold on poshmark the buyer has to pay instantly (ebay does not have this feature and as a result sellers say 10%+ of items sold have buyers that do not pay and they have to go through the process of canceling and re-listing). When the item is sold Poshmark E-mails a shipping label to you, all you have to do is print it out and tape it on ANY box or packaging and either drop it at USPS or have them pick it up. It is incredibly easy.\n\nBoth of these attributes remove the barriers to entry that new sellers face. When you get started you want it to be easy and straightforward. Incredibly, Ebay and other platforms have fee structures that are difficult to understand, platforms that are difficult to use, and most require a PayPal to be set up as well.\n\nThe third competitive advantage is by far the most important and hardest to create and sustain. Poshmark has a fiercely loyal and passionate user base of sellers who swear by the platform. Some become \"[Poshmark ambassadors](https://support.poshmark.com/s/article/How-do-I-become-a-Posh-Ambassador?language=en_US)\" and receive next to nothing for being ambassadors. They do it because they love the platform. I have tried in vain to convince sellers to go around the platform. Consider a $200 item, if they sell it on Poshmark, they will net $160. If I am willing to pay $175 through PayPal and try and convince them it's a win win as I save $25 and they'll make $15 more, I should stand ready to take the wrath of the Poshmark ambassador who will report me to Poshmark and decline my offer.\n\nLet's take a closer look at this third competitive advantage and see if it can help answer my question about why sellers would choose to sell on a platform that charges them a higher percentage of each sale. Why would they also loyally defend and promote this platform for few tangible benefits?\n\nThe answer is has to do more with psychology than with financial logic. The reason Poshmark was able to grow and compete is due to the first two competitive advantages I listed: it's easy to list, it's easy to ship, (and easy to get paid). Because it's easy to use sellers tell other sellers and buyers become sellers. We live in a market economy and with the rise of social media, large internet companies, and superstar founder entrepreneurs, the lives of entrepreneurs and the value they bring to society has been glorified. I think most people want to participate in the market economy, they want to be an entrepreneur, be their own boss, or have a \"side hustle\". Unfortunately, it's not easy and the few that succeed stand on a pile of failed ventures and crushed dreams. Poshmark makes it easy. Poshmark enables people who have been excluded from the wealth generating aspects of the online internet economy into successful participants. Broadly, those who haven't benefited from this new globalized economy have been: Women, racial minorities, geographic minorities (south, midwest). The demographics of Poshmark sellers and users closely align with those who have been excluded. The vast majority of Poshmark sellers are women, I was unable to find an exact number but in Poshmark's [2020 social commerce report](https://www.report.poshmark.com) a survey conducted by Zogby Analytics had a user response rate that was 97% female. In this same report, Poshmark states that \"the south dominates\" and that 35% of sellers live in the south and 37% of buyers live in the south. [Poshmark's real product is empowerment.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRVNdxz_thk) Their platform empowers women and minorities (racial and geographic) by making it easy for them to feel successful and have a side hustle. Empowerment is an incredible feeling for those who haven't felt it before and Poshmark makes it possible for millions to feel this way.\n\n**Why Wall Street Misunderstands Poshmark**\n\nIn order to find an investment that can provide outsized returns, it's important to have an information advantage over the consensus view. Wall Street does not understand this stock because broadly speaking Wall Street is an information laggard when it comes to valuing companies that provide products and services primarily to women. I've made similar investments in Lululemon and Revolve that have preformed extremely well as the consensus changed. As investors have seen this pattern play out over and over Wall Street investors have started to \"ask their wife\" or \"pay attention to their daughter\" in looking for innovative companies. The problem with Poshmark's stock is that the types of people who work on Wall Street analyzing stocks and their wives don't use poshmark, and neither do their daughters.\n\nWhen I was looking into the management at Poshmark I noticed Serena Williams is a board member. I am an avid tennis fan and as such I have a favorite player: Roger Federer. Everyone loves Federer, he is a class act and attracts sponsorships from the likes of Rolex, Mercedes, Netjets, Rimowa, Swiss coffee machine makers, and has an ownership stake in On Running. These are brands Wall Streeters love!  Serena Williams has a different public perception. On court she in an incredible competitor with a lot of passion which sometimes translates into dramatic meltdowns and aggressive behavior towards [umpires](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx9iT1OQMl0) and [linesmen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNwc7o_0Sgg). She has sponsorships from Nike, Gatorade, PUMA, Wilson, Pepsi etc. The respective brand deals the players have represent their public image and who they will be most effective in marketing towards. Serena Williams\u2019s image is used to target a demographic of consumers that is antithetical to the types of people Roger Federer\u2019s image is used for. Think about who evaluates and writes research on stocks. Its Federer fans, it's Rolex wearing, Swiss latte sipping 25-50 year olds who love the class and sophistication of Federer. Now think about the users of Poshmark, its young women, women of color, and women living in geographic areas that have taken a lot of the brunt of globalization. Serena Williams is the perfect match for Poshmark as she represents their user demographics much better than Federer ever could. But, Wall Street loves Federer and therefore has overlooked this stock.\n\n**Financials and Valuation**\n\n[Etsy recently bought Depop for 1.6B](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/etsy-buying-fashion-marketplace-depop-for-16-billion-2021-06-02) when Depop had 70M in revenue in the previous year. This equates to a Price to Sales ratio of 22.85. Poshmark's market cap at its current share price of $36.25 is 2.72 Billion. Last year they did 262M in revenue For a P/S ratio of 10.3. Remember, Depop is an inferior platform for sellers and barely has a useable website. Why did it sell for double to P/S ratio Poshmark is selling for now?\n\n**Potential Catalysts / The Set Up**\n\nPoshmark is expanding across the globe entering multiple new markets each year. Yesterday, 8/2, [Poshmark announced they will be expanding into India](https://investors.poshmark.com/news/news-details/2021/Poshmark-Inc.-Announces-India-Expansion-as-Part-of-a-Continued-Focus-on-New-Market-Opportunities/default.aspx) and the stock tanked 7.5%.\n\nA few months ago Poshmark announced a [partnership with Snapchat](https://investors.poshmark.com/news/news-details/2021/Poshmark-Inc.-and-Snap-Inc.-Partner-to-Bring-Social-Shopping-to-Snapchat/default.aspx). I am very excited about this partnership as I am bullish on Facebook and Snapchat and see commerce as an important new opportunity for both of these platforms.\n\nPoshmark is also expanding horizontally into different categories such as pets and home and because of their asset light model they can throw shit at the wall and see what sticks.\n\nSet up wise, this is more of a reopening play than a covid play but it is being looked at and valued as if it should've benefited from the lockdowns. Because Poshmark is an E-commerce company, Wall Street has been harsh on them for not growing as fast as some of their \"peers\". Except their \"peers\" aren't true peers as sites like Etsy are more diversified in the products sold on their platform with a heavier weight on arts and crafts and other activities that thrive when people have more time at home. Clothing is not something people look to buy when stuck at home. As the economy continues to reopen and people start working and going out again sales will pick up. This very well may be reflected in Q2 earnings.\n\nShort interest is 30% (4.75M/15M outstanding as of 7/15). I am not looking at this trade as a short squeeze but if shorts do decide to cover the stock could begin to run and run fast. \n\n**The Trade**\n\nShares are the safest play. There are limited options available on Poshmark with spreads I could drive a truck through. The furthest out are Feb 18, 2022. $65 is the highest strike available. Because of the spreads, uncertainty of when an upside move will occur, and lack of long dated options, I only own shares. Second Quarter earnings are coming up on 8/10 with guidance of $79.0 million - $81.0 million in Revenue and $1.5 million - $2.5 million in Adjusted EBITDA. I am fairly confidant they will beat the guidance they set for themselves but unsure if this will result in a massive move to the upside. I think it could take more time. \n\nI have a fairly high conviction in this trade and am posting to get feedback and thoughts from others, that said Poshmark is only 10%+ of my portfolio and I want to crowdsource my ideas a bit more before I buy options or decide to sell other investments to buy more. \n\n**TLDR**\n\nPoshmark empowers women. This is their competitive advantage. Wall Street doesn't get this.",

        "selftext": "This is not investing advice. All thoughts are my own. Do your own due diligence before investing. \n\nThe e-commerce theme has been good to us ordinary retail investors who have been all over the usual suspects. AMZN and SHOP have been spectacular. Industrial warehouse REITs like PLD have been beasts.   PYPL is killing it. Even old school retailers like WMT owe their resurgence in part to its pivot towards e-commerce. \n\nShopping is moving online and that is not changing anytime soon. But the old e-commerce names have a lot of this good news baked in already. GXO is a brand new name and still seems like its flying under the radar - literally it just got spun out of XPO. \n\nNot sure why but the spin out has not been received with as much buzz as I would have thought. Part of this is that spin-outs are not as flashy as IPOs but still. Given GXO is a unique pure play on e-commerce I would have anticipated more noise but its hardly been talked about. \n\nThe uniqueness of the business is worth talking about because it operates in a somewhat niche area of warehouse outsourcing where its hi-tech capabilities (automation expertise) differentiate it materially from the smaller players. \n\nBasically big companies with growing e-commerce businesses go to GXO to outsource their logistics to them. GXO works with their clients to identify warehouses, leases those warehouses and then brings in their expertise to manage the asset for the client through the introduction of appropriate automation. GXO are experts in tech-enabled logistics. They are not an industrial real estate play like PLD. They are the experts in squeezing the most efficiency out of each square foot of warehouse space on behalf of their customers. \n\nTAM is massive. Right now the company only represents approx. 5% of the outsourced logistics market which the company estimates is $130bn TAM. Through M&amp;A they will grow that slice of the pie (more on that in the catalysts section). \n\nThe bigger TAM opportunity is the $300bn of currently insourced logistics. Think big box retailers currently owning their own warehouses, managing their own shipping and returns, dealing with the associated HR burden and trying to figure out how to automate the whole thing (not their specialty). These big box retailers are realizing that in order to grow fast they can outsource all of this to experts like GXO, which frees up capital and time and effort to focus on their core businesses. \n\nThe stock has done well post the spin off last week but here are some catalysts to look forward to:\n\n1) Research coverage. Expect analysts to be writing about this stock soon as it can not be ignored. What will be interesting is how the analysts value this company vs other e-commerce facilitators because it is currently in a league of its own. \n\n2) M&amp;A. The company has said it needed its own balance sheet to pursue inorganic growth and now it has that. Lots of fragmentation means consolidation opportunities. \n\n3) New business wins. The company said its pipeline is the highest its ever been. Expect that pipeline to convert into new mandates. \n\nGood luck to all.",

        "selftext": "Hello investors,\n\nI am posting a revised version for clarification purposes. \n\nIn every stock analysis, there should be three key components.  \n\n\n1. Durable competitive advantage  \n2. Financial Analysis  \n3. Valuation  \n   \nIn this post, I will be going over the first of the three: Identifying durable competitive advantage, which I would argue is the most important one out of the three because a company's financials and valuations are simply reflections of a company's competitive advantage.  \n\n\nI've been noticing that a lot of people are leaving out some very important components to a stock analysis or taking big leaps in assumptions.  \n\n\nFor instance, many people nowadays seem to be making premature conclusions along the lines of  \n\n\n\"the US government is pushing for clean energy initiatives and therefore, Tesla stock will be going up\" or  \n\n\n\"Amazon reported sales growth of 40% so the stock is a buy\" or  \n\n\n\"Apple makes great phones and therefore, Apple stock is a great investment\".  \n\n\nIf you've noticed, these statements are taking big leaps in assumptions. There are many factors that go into an investment decision and we need to think from multiple angles, not just a one-dimensional level such as \"Apple is introducing a new line of products and thus, Apple stock is a buy.\" We need a more in-depth analysis.  \n\n\nI think the best way to learn is to take a look at an example analysis. This is an example copy of a one-pager stock pitch that covers all three elements: competitive advantage, financials, and valuation. For those who'd like a copy of this sample pitch please sign up to the email distribution list below and you'll receive a copy.  \n\n\nA competitive advantage is when a company has an edge over its competitors. Most people would subscribe to Neflix over renting DVDs because it's much easier and cheaper to stream on Neflix than renting $10 DVDs. This is called competitive advantage.  \n\n\nFor instance, a lemonade stand may have a competitive advantage over an orange juice stand because it can make lemonades at a cheaper cost than the orange juice stand.   \n   \nA Google's search engine has a competitive advantage over Microsoft's Edge due to the superior search algorithm and network effect.   \n   \nA durable competitive advantage is a company's edge that is a lasting one.   \n   \nTo use the previous examples, can the lemonade stand continue to produce lemonades at cheaper cost than orange juice stand?   \n   \nIs Google able to maintain its superior search algorithm and the network effect over time?  \n   \nA company with a durable competitive advantage is the one whose stock price will grow over time.  \n\n\nIf a company's business model does not have a durable competitive advantage, it won't survive for the long-term, no matter how cheap you can buy it.  \n   \nIt's sort of like buying a company that produces flip phones. Remember these? Sure you could be buying this company at a bargain P/E of 3x but is it really a bargain? It produces an outdated device with no real competitive advantage over other products and therefore, it won't see any type of growth and its stock price will cater.  \n   \nBlackberry also may had a competitive advantage at some point and that's why it became so widely used.  \n\n\nBut the advantage didn't last for long and it turns out the competitive advantage was not a durable one.  \n\n\nEvery company you look at should have a clear, durable competitive advantage.  \n\n\nFor instance, what's to keep Thor Industries, the largest manufacturer of recreational vehicles, to operate competitively?  \n\n\nBecause it has the largest and most efficient manufacturing plants and largest dealership network in the world. There is a high barrier-to-entry for any new entrants to compete. Management has been known to be great capital allocators, meaning they know when to issue debt to build a new manufacturing plant, acquire a business, or buy back its own stock.  \n\n\nThese points back up the claim that Thor has a durable competitive advantage and will keep the business growing.  \n\n\nMy favorite way of identifying this edge is to try the product or service because a customer is usually the best judge of a value. You could easily try Starbucks, Shake Shack, and many other products from consumer companies.  \n   \nFor those that are business-facing like Salesforce, you can find surveys or product usages.   \n   \nMost of the times, however, a great product/service will always show traction in the early stages.  \n   \nAmazon, Facebook, and PayPal were gaining 200% new users every year in its early days.  \n   \nAmerican Express had a crazy growth in its early years as well.  \n   \nTake Upstart for example. And this is one of my favorite companies at the moment because it's in the sweet spot of growth and valuation.  \n   \nIt's growing sales at +90% clip yoy, that compares to avg 15% growth for its peer companies.  \n   \nWithout even testing out their product, I know something is working right with the products it's offering, as evidenced by the sales growth.  \n   \nOne important thing to be mindful of is that sometimes these growth can be non-organic, meaning the growth can be a result of acquisitions or aggressive marketing spending.  \n   \nIf you are growing your sales  at 70% yoy but your user growth is only 40% yoy, that is a bad sign.  \n   \nAlternatively, if you are giving excessive concessions that your economics doesn't make sense, that's also an issue.   \n\n\nFor instance, remember Moviepass? They were charging $10/month to watch an unlimited number of movies. While the user growth was exceptional, this model was clearly unsustainable and we should be wary of these kinds of business models.  \n\n\nThe bottom line is that whenever you are looking to buy a stock of a company, the company should always have a durable competitive advantage in order for its stock to 10x in the next 5-10 years. \n\nPlease check out this [channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUDMvU3Ne27KA07rgopJnww) on YouTube for a better-explained version and check out r/Midasinvestors for steps 2 and 3!\n\nThank you all for reading and happy investing!",

Intel is securing its foothold in the semiconductor industry by building infrastructure, acquiring companies, and signing contracts. \n\n\tIntel wants to increase chip output and drive down its average costs to stay ahead of the competition. Intel is expanding into the automotive, consumer electronics, and foundries industry. Intel faces stiff competition from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) and Samsung. All three companies have announced plans to increase research development by 2023-24.\n\n\tMoore's Law is key to understanding how the chip shortage occurred and how to prevent it from happening again. Intel, TSM, and Samsung have all announced multibillion-dollar research and development plans in the U.S. The market for semiconductor chips is increasing exponentially.\n\n\tThe U.S has been falling behind countries like Asia in the global semiconductor market. The U.S aims to secure global chip supply through its U.S $50B subsidy plan. The subsidy plan will boost the research and development of semiconductors in the U.S. Companies like Intel, TSM, and Samsung are now chomping at the bits.\n\n\tThe global market for semiconductors is growing exponentially. The recent semiconductor chip shortage is proof of Moore's law. The U.S plans to expand into the global market through a $50B subsidy plan to attract research development to the U.S. Chips are as essential to our everyday lives as water. You control the chips, you control the future.\n\n*\\*\\*This is not investment advice. I am not an expert. Do your research.\\*\\**",

        "selftext": "I'd like to invest in VR and I'd like some input. I think VR is going to be quite successful in the future. It has a lot of room to grow and many possibilities. People always try it and like it, and FB is working on getting rid of any barriers that prevent people from buying it. For example, owning a PC, having to pay over 500, etc. \n\nFB recently announced that they would be releasing a new all-in-one headset soon, and I think it will sell quickly and lead to VR becoming quite popular.  \n\nQualcomm was involved in making the chips in the oculus headset, and will likely be the ones supplying them for the upcoming one.\n\nI'm split between which one to invest in. Sadly, even with a very successful VR launch, VR is a very minor aspect for them, and will probably not affect stock price much. \n\nI looked at companies like htc, but I think the oculus will keep heavily outperforming competitors. \n\nAny thoughts? \n\nI almost invested in qcom at 143$ and it jumped up by about 8$ just a few days later.

Intel is securing its foothold in the semiconductor industry by building infrastructure, acquiring companies, and signing contracts. \n\n\tIntel wants to increase chip output and drive down its average costs to stay ahead of the competition. Intel is expanding into the automotive, consumer electronics, and foundries industry. Intel faces stiff competition from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) and Samsung. All three companies have announced plans to increase research development by 2023-24.\n\n\tMoore's Law is key to understanding how the chip shortage occurred and how to prevent it from happening again. Intel, TSM, and Samsung have all announced multibillion-dollar research and development plans in the U.S. The market for semiconductor chips is increasing exponentially.\n\n\tThe U.S has been falling behind countries like Asia in the global semiconductor market. The U.S aims to secure global chip supply through its U.S $50B subsidy plan. The subsidy plan will boost the research and development of semiconductors in the U.S. Companies like Intel, TSM, and Samsung are now chomping at the bits.\n\n\tThe global market for semiconductors is growing exponentially. The recent semiconductor chip shortage is proof of Moore's law. The U.S plans to expand into the global market through a $50B subsidy plan to attract research development to the U.S. Chips are as essential to our everyday lives as water. You control the chips, you control the future.\n\n*\\*\\*This is not investment advice. I am not an expert. Do your research.\\*\\**",

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, August 2, 2021**\n\nStocks continued volatility from last week, with the three major indexes opening the day in the green before turning lower towards the end in the first trading session in August. As has been the case for at least a few weeks now, it seems the market will continue to perform a careful balancing act between record corporate profits and expectations for economic expansion and concerns surrounding the highly contagious coronavirus Delta variant and inflation. \n\nSo far, 59% of the companies in the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) have reported Q2 earnings, with 88% of these beating analyst expectations, according to FactSet. This quarter is shaping up to be another record-breaking one, with corporate earnings growth rate expected to accelerate 85%, which would be the biggest jump since the Q4 20009. \n\nHowever, it is important to note that, despite beating earnings expectations, a number of these companies have pulled back, with tepid outlooks moving forward overshadowing strong results. Moving forward, given that most companies have so far exceeded pre-pandemic levels and the current quarter has an easy comparison to last year, expectations for growth are inevitably going to moderate. This said, I think the pullback in some stocks following earnings is an overreaction. \n\nIn the last few weeks, concerns over the coronavirus Delta variant are increasing, which inevitably, has injected volatility in the markets. Last week, the CDC reversed their indoor mask policy. The agency now recommends that even fully vaccinated individuals begin once again wearing masks indoors in areas with high coronavirus transmission and in K-12 schools. Dr. Rochelle Walensky, Director of the CDC said, \u201cIn areas with substantial and high transmission, CDC recommends fully vaccinated people wear masks in public, indoor settings to help prevent the spread of the delta variant, and protect others. This includes schools\u201d. \n\nAs I have said before and will explain further below, while the surge in cases is unfortunate, it is important to note that the surge is largely concentrated in areas with high vaccine hesitancy. Moreover, while cases are surging, thankfully, hospitalizations and death rates are much lower when compared to previous surges, a sign that the vaccine is doing its job. While it doesn\u2019t prevent one from becoming infected, it greatly reduces the possibility for complications. \n\nIn the US, despite roughly 50% of the population being vaccinated, in the past two weeks, infections across the country have roughly doubled, with new cases jumping from 13,200 on July 4 to 78,433 as of July 31, according to data compiled by John Hopkins University. However, it is important to note, despite the surge the 7-day average of deaths is 360, once again according to John Hopkins University. \n\nAccording to data from the CDC, 97% of people who have died or been hospitalized with COVID-19 since the vaccine became widely available are unvaccinated. Dr Rochelle Walensky, Director of CDC said of the rising cases, \u201cThere is a clear message that is coming through. This is becoming a pandemic of the unvaccinated. Our biggest concern is we are going to continue to see preventable cases, hospitalizations, and sadly deaths among the unvaccinated.\u201d Sadly, despite the widespread availability of the vaccine in the US, hesitancy in certain places remains very high.\n\nMoreover, last week, the Fed released its July Monetary Policy Report largely reiterated what members of the Fed have been saying for months, but did include some new language hinting that the economic recovery is getting closer to the Fed\u2019s stated goals. The report also acknowledged potential risks and stated the Fed was ready to act if \u201cappropriate risks arise\u201d. The statement read, \u201cIn assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee's goals. The Committee's assessments will take into account a wide range of information, including readings on public health, labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments.\u201d\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* In a big industry move, Square (SQ) acquired Australian fin-tech company Afterpay, which allows customers to pay in installments, for $29 billion in an all-stock transaction. Square released a statement that read, \u201cSquare plans to integrate Afterpay into its existing Seller and Cash App business units, enable even the smallest of merchants to offer BNPL \\[buy now, pay later\\] at checkout, give Afterpay consumers the ability to manage their installment payments directly in Cash App, and give Cash App customers the ability to discover merchants and BNPL offers directly within the app.\u201d\n* Along with the Afterpay announcement, SQ unexpectedly announced Q2 earnings, which showed gross profit growing 91% thanks to strong Cash App and Seller ecosystem growth. The company reported revenue of $4.68 billion, 87% growth year-on-year but below the the $5.03 billion expected. Earnings per share skyrocketed to $0.66 compared to $0.30 expected.\n* Google announced it was moving away from Qualcomm (QCOM) and would begin manufacturing its own in-house processors for new Pixel phones launching later this year. This follows a similar move to what Apple (AAPL) did to Intel (INTC).\n* Ford Motors (F) Chief Financial Officer John Lawler said the company hopes to reinstate a dividend by the end of the year. He said, \u201cWe've had a really tough period of time here the last couple of years with Covid last year and now the chip shortage. We plan to bring the dividend back as soon as we can...depending on how the second half goes with \\[computer\\] chips, it could be as early as the end of this year.\u201d Ford suspended its dividend last year.\n* Electric vehicle sales in China more than tripled in July compared to a year ago. \n   * Nio delivered 7,931 vehicles in July, 124% increase YoY\n   * Xpeng (XPEV) delivered 8,040 vehicles, 228% increase YoY\n   * Li (LI) delivered 8,589 vehicles, 251% increase YoY\n* \\*\\***Please note that current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect closing prices\\*\\***\n* Abbvie (ABBV) with two target raises.

        "selftext": "Ok idiots listen up AMD is now headed to $269 before EOY.\n\nHere is why:\n1) Intel is getting pantsed by AMD\n2) NVDA is the benchmark stock for AMD to compare against\n3) XLNX merger closes in November (potentially earlier)\n\nFor you non nerds: Smart Intel engineers went to go to work for Facebook, Amazon, Google, Tesla. The idiots that remained screwed up massively over the last 2 years getting ready for the next generations of chips.\nSemiconductor manufacturing is complicated and takes 3 years to work out the kinks on the new technology. TSMC is good and Intel sucks. This will continue for 2-3 more years minimum.\n\n\n1.AMD revenue growth. Last week announced 99% yearly growth. Still room to grow after pulling down Intel\u2019s pants (10% market share for EPYC today, every cloud and enterprise customer is now validating EPYC).\n\n2. NVIDIA is run by the Elon Musk of the semiconductor industry. Jensen has been CEO longer than all the other semiconductor CEOs combined (Internet+Broadcom+Qualcomm+AMD+TSMC+AMD). NVDA earned their 94 p/e. Whose next? AMD\n\n3. Big players are arbitraging XLNX acquisition. Once this selling pressure disappears (presumably around merger closing) it\u2019s gonna rip.\n\nAt the end of this (rev growth, reduced selling pressure, P/E matching NVDA today) AMD will be at $269.",

        "selftext": "\n\nSHANGHAI, Aug 3 (Reuters) - China's regulatory agency is launching an investigation into chip distributors in the auto industry, citing suspicions of price gouging, it said on Tuesday.\n\nThe action by the State Administration For Market Regulation (SAMR) is the latest in a regulatory crackdown following a range of companies and industries targeted over the past year as the Chinese government clamps down on industry.\n\n\"In response to prominent problems such as speculation and high prices in the automotive chip market, the State Administration of Market Supervision has recently filed an investigation on car chip distributors,\" the agency said.\n\nThe firms were suspected of driving up prices, based on price monitoring and reporting clues, it added in its statement, and vowed to investigate and punish illegal acts such as hoarding, price-gouging and collusion.\n\nA global shortage of chips that began last December has disrupted supply chains and the hardware sector worldwide. Though initially concentrated in the automotive sector, it has since spread to affect a wide range of gadgets.\n\nPanic about supply uncertainty has occasionally led chip buyers and distributors to purchase more chips than they need, creating a vicious cycle that further drives up prices.\n\nIn June, the chief executive of chipmaker Intel said he expected the shortage to hit bottom by year-end, with the market retuning to normalcy only by 2023.\n\nIn April China's regulator imposed a record fine of $2.75 billion on e-commerce giant Alibaba for engaging in anti-competitive practices.\n\nhttps://www.reuters.com/technology/china-regulator-investigate-auto-chip-distributors-suspicion-price-gouging-2021-08-03/\n\n**Ok, this is getting a bit out of hand. A constant barrage of bearish news coming out of China after some stabilizing that happened at the end of last week. Not sure what the endgame here is for China or the CCP. On one hand, it makes no sense for them to lose the confidence of foreign investors with moves like this. Are they pushing the boundaries of patience of investors? Or is this a deliberate attempt to crackdown on each sector one by one?**\n\n*Stocks likely to be affected by this: AMD, INTC, QCOM, NVDA. If you know some others that are a part of the cars in China, please post them in the comments*",

Intel, TSM, and Samsung have all announced multibillion-dollar research and development plans in the U.S. The market for semiconductor chips is increasing exponentially.\n\n\tThe U.S has been falling behind countries like Asia in the global semiconductor market. The U.S aims to secure global chip supply through its U.S $50B subsidy plan. The subsidy plan will boost the research and development of semiconductors in the U.S. Companies like Intel, TSM, and Samsung are now chomping at the bits.\n\n\tThe global market for semiconductors is growing exponentially. The recent semiconductor chip shortage is proof of Moore's law. The U.S plans to expand into the global market through a $50B subsidy plan to attract research development to the U.S. Chips are as essential to our everyday lives as water. You control the chips, you control the future.\n\n*\\*\\*This is not investment advice. I am not an expert. Do your research.\\*\\**",

        "selftext": "Most investors have probably never heard of exosomes until Codiak\u2019s (NASDAQ: CDAK) chief exec, Doug Williams, made his pitch about this cool molecules at the JP Morgan conference two weeks ago. So for starters, let's define what is an exosome. Exosomes are extracellular vesicles (EVs) of endosomal origin that range in size between 30 and 150nm. Exosomes are secreted by a wide range of cells, since virtually all living cells utilize exosome-mediated communication. Exosomes carry cell-specific cargos of proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids that are selectively taken up by recipient cells.  In essence, these are a critical building block of organic life and have a myriad of unexplored biopharma applications.  \n\nThe cargo contained within exosomes can offer information for a wide range of diseases, therefore exosomes can also act as prognostic indicators and predictors of a patient\u2019s response to a specific course of treatment.  Exosome-based diagnostics are minimally invasive, offering both ease-of-use and speed of detection. Numerous approaches are being researched for creating drug-loaded exosomes and they can exert powerful effects. For example, if a patient has a disease caused by a missing or defective protein or microRNA, the patient\u2019s exosomes can be isolated, modified with the appropriate siRNA or protein, and injected back into the patient for treatment.\n\nFor these reasons, exosomes have gone from being overlooked to rapidly gaining momentum as a novel strategy for accessing the therapeutic effects of cells without the risks and difficulties of administering cells to patients.  Exosome-related technologies have been developing rapidly over the past few years. Substantial growth is expected for the market as they get highly integrated into the elite healthcare fields such as liquid biopsy, precision medicine and regenerative medicine.\n\nWithin the past 5 years, there have been at least 7 major partnership deals within the exosome industry, 8 large venture capital events, and 2 landmark acquisitions.  Today, the exosome industry is witnessing rising numbers of clinicals trials investigating exosome therapeutics and diagnostics. Here are some listed companies taking exosome science to the next level:\n\n**Innocan Pharma (CSE: INNO) (FSE: IP4) (OTCQB: INNPF) Combining Exosomes &amp; CBD**\n\nInnocan Pharma, in collaboration with a Tel Aviv university team, is developing a revolutionary cell therapy - based technology, loaded with CBD (Cannabidiol), designed to target coronavirus infected lung cells and central nervous system diseases. Innocan\u2019s CLX Therapy holds the potential to provide a highly synergistic effect of anti-inflammatory properties and help in the recovery of infected lung cells. This product is planned to act as a \"guided missile\" to the infected lungs, combining the cell healing properties of exosomes and the anti-inflammatory properties of CBD.\n\nInnocan's CBD Loaded Exosome (CLX) Therapy project demonstrates the capability of having reliable large-scale production of exosomes and is an important milestone in the CLX Therapy development process. Innocan managed to produce trillions of exosomes in a short period of time in a 3-dimensional bioreactor, and that may lead to economic large-scale exosome production for the CLX. This achievement is expected to pave the way for larger tests and studies.  Combine its CLX program R&amp; with their established credentials as a cannabis/CBD powerhouse, and in a final evaluation this company holds a lot of long-term promise for making strong and early inroads into the exosome market.\n\n**Sarepta Therapeutics (NASDAQ: SRPT) and Codiak BioSciences (NASDAQ: CDAK)**\n\nOn June 22, 2020, Sarepta Therapeutics and Codiak BioSciences signed a global research and option agreement to design and develop engineered exosome therapeutics to deliver gene therapy, gene editing and RNA technologies for neuromuscular diseases. The engineered exosome approach offers the potential to effectively deliver genetic therapeutics without triggering the adaptive immune response. The two-year agreement includes up to five neuromuscular targets. Codiak is eligible to receive up to $72.5 million in upfront and near-term license payments plus research funding.  That equates to a lot of capital that, if invested wisely, can go back into research for the next generation of exosome studies and clinical trials.\n\n**Jazz Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: JAZZ) and Codiak BioSciences (NASDAQ: CDAK)**\n\nOn January 03, 2019, Jazz Pharmaceuticals and Codiak BioSciences signed a strategic collaboration agreement focused on the research, development and commercialization of exosome therapeutics to treat cancer. Codiak granted Jazz an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing license to develop, manufacture and commercialize therapeutic candidates directed at five targets to be developed using Codiak\u2019s engEx precision engineering platform for exosome therapeutics. The targets focus on oncogenes that have been well validated in hematological malignancies and solid tumors but have been undruggable with current modalities. Codiak received a $56 million upfront payment.\n\nIn sum, the companies explored above are all approaching the budding exosome industry from different angles.  Innocan\u2019s point-of-departure is CBD and its range of applications in the biomed/pharma sectors. Likewise, Codiak, Sarepta, and Jazz are all making powermoves to determine the efficacy of exosome therapies in diverse areas such as immune disorders and hematological malignancies.",
