        "selftext": "\n \nFor Trading August 12th\n \nTSLA 5:1 SPLIT\n \nGOLD / SILVER COLLAPSE\n \nDJIA CLOSES 450 OFF HIGH\n \n \nToday\u2019s market got off to a slightly higher start on DJIA and S&amp;P-500 but general weakness in the NASDAQ, again.  By the end of the day the DJIA -104.53 (.38%) was well off its +363 high and the NASDAQ was the big loser -185.54 (1.69%).  The S&amp;P 500 was -26.78 (.80) after being withing a few dollars of a new high, the Russell -9.57 (.6%), and the only winner the DJ Transports +24.59 (.23%).  Market internals were 1:1 on the NYSE but 1.5:1 down on the NASDAQ.  Volume was slightly higher than average for an August day.  The major feature of the day was the massive selloff in the precious metals.  Gold was down $125/oz. at the low and finished $1946.30 -93.40 (6%) while the Silver was lower by $3.21 to $26.049 after hitting an intraday low of $24.48.  The change at the close was 12%.  I would assume that we would see some follow-thru tonight and tomorrow early, but I bought the NEM September $65 / 70 call spread for $1.45.  This is basically the same trade I made last month on the August expo $60/65 spread @ $1.30 that we sold @ $3.20.  We also had the TBT 9/18 15 calls @ $ .40 that we sold today half @ $ .68, and the second half @ $ .74 just before they fell back to $ .55.  Not bad, with YTD now back to +34%.\n \n\nTonight\u2019s closing comment video  https://youtu.be/EvsCZy_K1sw\n\n\nSECTORS: We didn\u2019t have much corporate news today but QCOM won an appeals court ruling on an anti-trust case and the stock ignored the selloff and finished the day $108.83 +2.47 (2.3%).  That made it a standout as the rest of technology was hit hard again today.  It was the 3rd day down for the NASDAQ since its new closing high at $11,108.07 last Thursday.\nThe biggest news of the late day was the announcement that TESLA (TSLA) declared a 5:1 stock split.  While this is really just straight arithmetic, it does create some demand for the shares now, since when the stock split becomes effective at the end of August you would have 5 times the shares at 1/5 of the price.  But it does promote the purchase of \u201cround lots\u201d as opposed to \u201codd lots.\u201d  Does it really increase demand?  Not really, but most stocks (like AAPL) do seem to rise on the news.  TSLA certainly did, closing $1374 -44, and then on the news rallied to its current $1467.20, over $90 higher.\nFOOD SUPPLY CHAIN was LOWER with TSN +.82, BGS -.46, FLO +.20, CPB -.63, CAG -.49, MDLZ -.49, KHC -.16, CALM +.19, JJSF -.35, SAFM +2.10, HRL -.31, SJM -.84, PPC +.27, KR -.58, and PBJ #33.32 -.37 (1.13%).\n \nBIOPHARMA was LOWER with BIIB -10.32, ABBV +.19, REGN -9.38, ISRG -8.00, GILD +.35, MYL +.39, TEVA -.07, VRTX -6.87, BHC +.16, INCY -1.32, ICPT -.25, LABU -6.96, and IBB $132.28-2.59 (1.92%).\nCANNABIS: was LOWER with TLRY -.95, CGC -.54, CRON -.06, GWPH -3.52, ACB -.14, NBEV -.02, CURLF -.38, KERN -.29, and MJ $12.95 +.01 (.08%).\n\nDEFENSE:  was HIGHER with LMT +3.03, GD +2.94, TXT -.18, NOC +6.27, BWXT +.22, TDY +1.75, RTX +.16, and ITA $172.14 +.91 (.53%).\n\n \nRETAIL: was HIGHER with M -.16, JWN +.07, KSS +.55, DDS +.66, WMT -1.33, TGT -1.22, TJX +1.08, RL +1.77, UAA +.27, LULU -8.95, TPR +.12, CPRI +.31, and XRT $50.60 -.39 (.76%).\n \nFAANG and Big Cap: were LOWER with GOOGL -12.81, AMZN -63.15, AAPL -10.52, FB -5.50, NFLX -14.89, NVDA -10.20, TSLA +50.43, BABA +.87, BIDU +.08, CMG -11.00, CAT +1.23, MSFT -3.,85, BA +.98, DIS +1.86, and XLK $112.00 -1.42 (1.25%).\nPLEASE BE AWARE THAT THESE PRICES ARE LATE MARKET QUOTES AND DO NOT REPRESENT THE 4:00 CLOSES.\n \n \nFINANCIALS were HIGHER with GS +2.42, JPM +3.58, BAC +.47, MS +1.22, C +1.17, PNC +3.32, AIG +.52, TRV +.80, AXP +1.70, V +1.46, and XLF $25.31 +.29 (1.16%).\n \nOIL, $41.61 -.33. Oil was higher in last night\u2019s trading before we rallied in the morning on news of production cutbacks from Iraq. The stocks were HIGHER with XLE $38.20 -.13 (.34%).\n \n \nGOLD $1,946.30 -93.40, was a continuation rally and a new recovery high of $2,089.20, but we collapsed and fell as far as $1,919 -124 before coming back slightly.  Tonight, we are currently trading lower again at $1,915.70 \u2013 30.00.  While I like the gold down here, I will have to wait and see how it acts overnight.\n \nBITCOIN: closed $11,435 -580. After breaking out over $10,000 we have had a \u201crunning correction\u201d pushing prices toward $12,000, reaching a recovery high of $12220 yesterday. We had added 350 shares of GBTC @ $10.02 to our position of 400 @ $8.06, bringing our average price to $8.97, but sold 250 shares today @ $13.93.

Market internals were positive with NYSE 9:5 and NASDAQ 2.5:1 higher with volume about average for this time of the summer.  ISM data was strong with the manufacturing number 54.2, up from 53.4 estimate and 52.6 in June.  All around, a pretty good day.  AAPL &amp; MSFT were the stars with AAPL +10.71 (2.5%) after its 10.5% rise on earnings last Friday and MSFT +11.53 (5.6%), but the Russell was the highlight and the biggest gainer.  The only negative was that there is still no agreement on the next Coronavirus relief bill.\n \n\n \nTonight\u2019s closing comment video https://youtu.be/mZvr4ijnVKw\n\nToday\u2019s video on the UNG Trade:  https://youtu.be/RBWaSke96O8\n \n \nSECTORS: There was plenty of news around in M &amp; A deals with Marathon Petroleum (MPC) selling its Speedway business (gas stations and convenience stores) to 7-11 for $21Billion in cash.  Clearly this was a premium well above what was expected as MPC rallied to just over $40 and settled at the end of the day $38.57, +.37.  Also in the news, Alphabet (GOOGL) took a 6.6% stake in ADT to develop home security and ADT traded as high as $17.21 and finished $13.48 +4.87 (56.56%).

The stock, already down from its high of $88.60 traded as low as $29.75 and is currently $30.10 -.42.

        "selftext": " \n \nFor Trading August 7th\n \nFB +6.5% on ???\n \nContinuing Claims Lower\n \nAnother New High for NASDAQ\n \n \nToday\u2019s market got off to a slightly lower start on futures and the influence of the European markets but quickly turned higher after the mega-caps came roaring back to add to gains of the last several weeks.  The big question of why remains unanswered.  They just ran up and while there was no new news, there are plenty excuses.  Mr. Z\u2019s market cap gained $46Billion.  Market internals were no better than 1:1 on the NYSE and NASDAQ was actually 6:5 down, with volume just average for the summer months.  DJIA was just barely positive at 16:14 up with only one standout, AAPL adding 105 DP\u2019s to the average. BA was the only double-digit loser and only barely -15 DP\u2019s.  There really wasn\u2019t much news from Washington unless you count Pelosi sniping at Republicans and McConnell trying to explain away his stubbornness.\n \n \nTonight\u2019s closing comment video  https://youtu.be/x3rHFMWfl80\n \nOur Discord link is in the video description..\n \nSECTORS: There was plenty of earnings news around with numbers for BKNG, DDOG, Z, UBER and DBX, but I want to take a moment away from that to make myself clear on the continuing Airline Bailout.  I am 100% AGAINST wasting yours and my money so that an industry that absolutely squandered the advantages gained in their expansion and record profitability during the past decade.  They made flying a brutally painful and expensive adventure with fees for just about everything other than the lavatories.  The Boards of Directors and CEO\u2019s repurchased shares, elevating prices, and self-enriching themselves all at the cost of rainy-day funding, right-sizing their companies and doing anything that made sense to increase their longevity.  Now they want to \u201csave 100,000 jobs\u201d that will have to be cut.   Here\u2019s a thought, NO WAY!  How about an industry that supports millions of people and families that has been beaten down, not of their own stupidity\u2026How about Retail?  How many of you know people who no longer have a job in a retail store?  What did they do to cause the problem?  I\u2019m guessing nothing but stand on their feet 40 hours a week to make sure you found whatever you came in looking for.  This is a bailout that should absolutely NOT HAPPEN!  They don\u2019t deserve it, and in fact it would make little difference in the scheduling and availability of flights.  If you\u2019re foolish enough to be an equity holder in this business that has so badly treated the customers, you deserve to lose your stake.

Bond markets were slightly lower with the long end actually gaining a bit and steepening the yield curve.
