        "selftext": "Alright, CRSR had a day. Full disclosure, I am balls deep in contracts and shares (46 Dec 17 40C and ~1300 shares to be specific).\n\nI am going to compare CRSR to ENPH, AMZN, and CRWD. I chose these stocks because I own AMZN and CRWD and am in the solar industry, so I have followed ENPH as well. They are all tech growth stocks. AMZN sells products on the internet and has software subsidiaries. ENPH sells relatively high margin products. CRWD is a growth stock in its infancy. I believe they make for reasonably good comparisons to CRSR because they all have similar revenue growth over the past few years (well, CRWD is slightly higher) and all are part of growing industries.\n\nWhat happened recently? Well, they crushed their Q4 and Q1 earnings. Shares were at about $46 before Q1 and the February sell off hit them hard. Then they bamboozled Q1 and went up for a day, then dropped down to $31-32. It popped a but and Eagle Tree sold 5 million shares at 32 bucks. It appears that ended last Friday. So basically, they had 2 blowout quarters and their share price tanked by just under 50%. Absurd. Volume was usually under 2 million. Today it was over 65 million. That likely means retail bought a huge chunk of shares formerly owned by insiders and institutions.\n\nHere are the numbers (they might be slightly off, I am rounding and sometimes make mistakes):\n\nCompound Annual Revenue Growth rate:\n\nCRWD \u2013 Last 2.25 years: 41%\n\nAMZN \u2013 Last 4.25 years: 30.5%\n\nENPH \u2013 Last 4.25 years: 26.3%\n\nCRSR \u2013 Last 4.25 Years: 31.8%\n\nCrowdStrike is a relatively new company. The others are established. CRWD has the best gross profit margin of the 4, and CRSR is the lowest. Here are the TTM gross profit numbers:\n\nCRWD \u2013 73.9%\n\nAMZN \u2013 40.5%\n\nENPH \u2013 44.6%\n\nCRSR \u2013 30.6%\n\nSo CRSR loses a bit here. This is more than made up by the following PE Ratios. I am going to use the average of the past 2 quarters of company reported earnings for this. \n\nCRWD \u2013 506.5\n\nAMZN \u2013 55.1\n\nENPH \u2013 69\n\nCRSR \u2013 16.2\n\nAlright, so this is a bit crazy. I understand that there is a premium on margins, but that should show up in the earnings. Solar industry growth is flattening, ecommerce is growing, but at a much slower pace than before, cybersecurity gets a bump for likely being the fastest growing. And then there is gaming, a continuously growing industry quickly being adopted by the younger generation and played by everyone who is not a boomer. Gamers are getting older, and richer. They are getting real jobs. They spend a good chunk of their disposable income on their girlfriends\u2026 NOT!\n\nThis is absolutely insane. CRSR had a higher growth rate than ENPH, albeit with worse margins, and their past 2 quarters beat ENPH on an EPS basis. ENPH\u2019s share price is 147. CRSR is 36. WHAT???\n\nCRWD had 999 Mil of revenue in the past 12 months. Their market cap is 52.7 billion. CRSR\u2019s is 3.32 billion on 1.9 billion of sales.\n\nWMT, just to throw a name out there, had 3.5% CARG over the past 4 years and their PE ratio is *explicit*23. What is going on here?\n\nThe answer is boomers think video gamers are going to stop playing because the pandemic is over. \n\nI don\u2019t know, man. Their Q1 was great, beat bigly on revenue, margin, and earnings. They said they were supply constrained, I believe it. I think that gamers are going to continue to buy their PCs and memory as fast as they can stock it for the rest of the year. They guided 18% revenue growth for the year and blew out their guidance in Q1. During their earnings call, they said something like it \u201ceven beat their internal projections\u201d which means they think they are going to beat their own guidance. \n\nOK, so what is my point here? Well basically it is that they are growing quickly and already profitable, which is a rare combination and generally earns a PE ratio well north of 35. If their PE ratio was 35 (based on annualizing their most recent quarter) their share price would be $81.2. \n\n\u201cWait Sirenor, isn\u2019t that PE ratio way lower than the other stonks you showed?\u201d\n\nYes, it is. To the moon gents. \n\n\nTLDR \u2013 Buy CRSR, it is very cheap.",

        "selftext": "ENPH rise. Insider trading much? After several days of research,  I decided to sell Enphase (ENPH) at 144 on June 15. Next day, it shot up 10 points for no reason. Its been up nearly 40 points since 6/15 for absolutely no reason publicly available. WTF. Semiconductors are in  shortage, infrastructure bill is stalled, solar sector (growth sector) has been in decline since beginning of February. Last week a Wall Street floor trader told me only to day trade or hold short term for gains here and forget long term investing because the hedge fund managers own the market. Thoughts?",

        "selftext": "Thing are looking up in SPAC land and there are still hundreds of SPACs' warrants under $1. It seems the appetite for risk is returning and prices have started appreciating rapidly. Fortunately there are still good warrants to be found at good prices.\n\n***DISCLAIMER:*** *I am not a financial advisor. I have 93 different warrants positions (80 still pre-DA) and have spent the past three months building out positions in as many good teams as I can as close to all-time lows, and I have positions in all the 12 of the warrants mentioned in this article. Warrant prices change rapidly, liquidity is still relatively low, and all are at risk of going to zero if the SPAC liquidates. Make sure a warrant-oriented approach matches your risk appetite and you understand the complexities of these instruments before buying.*\n\nThings I look for:\n\n* low splits in units = potential for better valuation/targets and an indicator of a better team\n* team quality\n* previous SPAC experience\n\n# ROCRW\n\n**Last Trade:** $0.9725\n\n**Warrants in Units:** 1/4 \n\n**Previous/Related:** PCT, which has warrants currently trading at $9.31. Another current SPAC, ROCC, DA'd with Reservoir Media and the last trade on the warrants was 1.63 with a high of 2.90. \n\n**Sector:** Business Services, Consumer, Healthcare, Tech, Wellness, Sustainability\n\n**Team:** Byron Roth (Founder, Roth). \n\n# NVSAW\n\n**Last Trade:** $0.91\n\n**Warrants in Units:** 1/3\n\n**Sector:** Aviation, Aerospace, Defense\n\n**Team:** This team is STACKED. If you are looking for a good aerospace SPAC it may well be the best:\n\n* Dennis A. Muilenburg, the former CEO of Boeing, \n* Marion Blakey, the former Administrator of the FAA, former CEO of the Aerospace Industries Association and former CEO of Rolls-Royce NA, \n* Howard Lance, the former CEO of Maxar and Harris, \n* Christopher Lofgren, Chairman of the US Chamber of Commerce and the CEO of Schneider National\n* Gen. Stephen Wilson, ret. 4 Star Air Force General and Vice Chief of Staff of the Air Force\n* Top advisors include Paul Eremenko, fmr CTO at Airbus, Gur Kimchi, Co-Founder of Amazon Prime Air, Dr. John Tracy, VP of Engineering at Boeing, and more...\n\n# LCAH-WT \n\n**Last Trade:** $0.865 \n\n**Warrants in Units:** 1/4\n\n**Sector:** Consumer, Dining, Hospitality, Entertainment, Gaming \n\n**Previous/Related:** GNOG. GNOG warrants were early redeemed and hit a high price of $10.56.\n\n**Team:** Tilman Fertitta (Houston Rockets owner, CEO of Landry's)\n\n**CLAA-WT** \\- Last Trade: $0.90 - 1/5 warrants in units, and one of the cheapest in that split. The team's previous SPAC was OUST, which successfully completed a merger and the warrants are currently at $3.35, with a high price of $4.57.\n\n# GLBLW\n\n**Last Trade:** $0.69\n\n**Warrants in Units:** 1/3\n\n**Sector:** Not specified, but suggest \"proven business models as we do not intend to assume risks of unproven technologies \"\n\n**Team:** Very solid team for this price: Peter Yu (Managing Partner at Cartesian, former CEO of AIG Capital Partners, Former Director National Economic Council), Elias Dias Sese (President of Northern Europe Kraft Heinz, Former CEO of Tim Hortons), Daniel Karp (Former VP of Worldwide Business Development at Pfizer) \n\n# AGGRW\n\n**Last Trade:** $0.78\n\n**Warrants in Units:** 1/3\n\n**Sector:** Tech - Software, HCIT, Fintech, robotics/automation, EdTech  \n\n**Team:** Jay Bhatt (Former CEO, Alfresco Software; Former CEO, Blackboard), John Newton (Founder/CTO, Alfresco Software), Steven Alesio (Former Chairman/CEO, Dun &amp; Bradstreet), Carol Bartz (Former CEO of Yahoo! and Autodesk), Carl Bass (Director and Fmr CEO of Autodesk; Fmr Director, Hewlett-Packard)   \n\n# DHBC-WT \n\n**Last Trade:** $0.73\n\n**Warrants in Units:** 1/3\n\n**Sector:** Financial Services\n\n**Team:** A very solid resumed team for warrants this cheap: Robert Hurst (Former Vice Chairman/ Head of Investment Banking Division, Goldman Sachs), Richard DeMartini (Former President of Asset Management, Bank of America, Former Chairman, Discover Card). \n\n# DTOC-WT \n\n**Last Trade:** $0.78\n\n**Warrants in Units**: 1/4. This is the cheapest 1/4 split warrant on the market as of last trade Friday.\n\n**Sector:** Healthcare Tech \n\n**The team:** Kevin Nazemi (Fmr Co-CEO, Oscar Health),Bradley Fluegel (Former Chief Strategy Officer, Walgreens &amp; Anthem), Jim Moffatt (Former Vice Chairman/Global CEO, Deloitte Consulting). \n\n# PCPC-WT\n\n**Last Trade:** $1.93\n\n**Warrants in Units:** 1/4. Remember when I said this post was about warrants under $1 and DTOC was the cheapest 1/4 split? Well, that was technically true, but PCPC-WT's $1.93 needs an asterisk: This SPAC is at 2.5x the scale of a normal SPAC, with a $25 per share baseline and a $28.75 strike. By that standard, these warrants at $1.93 would be worth .775 if it were a normal $10 base SPAC. \n\n**Team:** Led by Sahnjeev Mehra, founder and managing partner, Peripheras Capital. \n\n**Notable Feature:** It also has an investors-friendly CAPS incentive structure, where the founders get 6% on merger as opposed to the typical 20%, then provides payouts at certain price levels for sticking with the company long term.\n\n# BOAS-WT\n\n**Last Trade:** $0.67\n\n**Warrants in Units:** 1/3. One of the cheapest in that warrant split. \n\n**Focus:** PropTech\n\n**Team:** Scott Seligman, Chairman of The Seligman Group (a real estate development company), David Glazer (CFO, Palantir), Shane Battier (Former NBA player and VP of Analytics and Basketball Development, Miami Heat)\n\n# SGAMW (DA: REDBOX)\n\n**Last Trade:** 0.84\n\n**Valuation:** $693M, with 2021E revenues of $569M (EV 1.2x estimated revenues).\n\n**Why it's a buy:** According to conventional wisdom, Redbox is a dying company. People are moving away from conventional media like disc videogames and DVDs to all streaming. However, I think that conventional wisdom is from the perspective of those of us who have the privilege to afford internet, smart TVs and streaming services. 70% of Redbox's customers are \"late adopters\" - largely the elderly and low income. To these people, a $2 DVD rental for the latest release is a cheaper night of entertainment than most other forms, and Amazon digital movie rentals for the blockbuster new releases not on Prime are often over $6. Additionally, Redbox is pivoting to digital and supposedly more affordable for the same movies than Amazon. \n\n# LIVKW (DA: AGILETHOUGHT)\n\n**Last Trade:** 0.85\n\n**Valuation:** $482M for $184M in 2021E revenue (EV 2.6x estimated revenues)\n\n**Why it's a buy:** This is a boring IT services company that SPAC investors don't care about, heavily based around consultants in Mexico (even though the corporate HQ is in Dallas). This has led to it becoming underrated for a valuation this good, and for a company that has a good reputation in their field. They trade at very favorable multiples compared to other stocks in their field. One doesn't have to be a groundbreaking product for a company to be a good stock.\n\nGood luck!",

Graber became a father-figure to Israel, as the latter learnt the reality of insider trading, front running, and the secret array of scams to scalp points from every trade.\"\n\nFreddy Graber was one of the first individuals to operate a hedge fund and market maker at the same time.

At the time there were only a few hundred funds running perhaps a few billion dollars, compared with the trillion-dollar industry that would emerge in the coming decades.\"\n\nI'd like to point out that Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley &amp; Salomon Brothers have all been involved with shorting treasury bonds in the past.

(Nichols states that Carlucci served as the Deputy Director of the CIA at this time).\n\n[https://history.defense.gov/Multimedia/Biographies/Article-View/article/571285/frank-c-carlucci/](https://history.defense.gov/Multimedia/Biographies/Article-View/article/571285/frank-c-carlucci/)\n\n**Harry Fair:**\n\n[http://www.isitaustin.org/downloads/Fair\\_bio.html](http://www.isitaustin.org/downloads/Fair_bio.html)\n\nNichols describes that Harry fair told him he\n\n&gt;\"was involved with projects that were extremely sensitive...

John Prescott Ellis is a free man and now serves as a Partner at Venture Capital firm Sand Hills Partners.\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John\\_Prescott\\_Ellis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Prescott_Ellis)\n\nNichols describes the task that John Prescott Ellis directed him to do:\n\n&gt;\"To obtain a sealed box, that of origin Chinese... from the Chinese that he said he was quite familiar with and it could not be opened. I had no responsibility as to its content, but a sealed box and it must -- it had to be a hundred million dollars\"\n\nNichols also claims that:\n\n&gt;\"Sam Israel had heard of the safety deposit box from another source, and alleged that George Soros got his money by finding one of the boxes\".\n\n(the guy says this in his deposition, just so bizarre that he would mention this specifically). \n\nA 1982 FBI report details an anti-racketeering investigation that sheds further light on the affairs of Robert Booth Nichols.\n\nObtained by News Channel 3 (KESQ) the report discloses that during and after his time with the CIA, Nichols participated in money laundering associated with narcotics and organized crime; he was also involved heavily in international arms dealing.\n\nKESQ details that Robert Booth Nichols was listed as owner of Meridian Arms Corporation. This fact is confirmed through cross-referencing this LA Times article and [OpenCorporates.com](https://OpenCorporates.com):\n\n[https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1993-03-21-mn-13734-story.html](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1993-03-21-mn-13734-story.html)\n\n&gt;\"Nichols\u2019 suit charges that the loss of the permit led to a withdrawal of Swiss financing for his firm, Meridian Arms Corp., to manufacture a new machine gun in South Korea.\"\n\nThe following link lists Robert B.

It can be confirmed that he armed foreign governments (Philippines) as is stated in the 1987 FBI report. This suggests Federal Arms and Empire State Arms were used to book Meridian's sales and launder the proceeds from such sales. He refused to give a sworn statement to the house committee regarding specifics of Meridian's specific business dealings (outside of discussing the loss incurred to him as a result of his L.A.P.D apprehension).\n\nNichols also established an arms dealing company of the same name during his time in Queensland, Australia:\n\n [https://opencorporates.com/companies/au/168176592](https://opencorporates.com/companies/au/168176592)\n\nThe existing entity, Meridian Fire Arms was established in 2011 (3 years after the Israel case):\n\n[https://opencorporates.com/companies/us\\_mi/801614393](https://opencorporates.com/companies/us_mi/801614393)\n\nAs a vendor they're listed as Meridian Defense Corp. or \"MDC\":\n\n[https://meridiandefensecorp.com/](https://meridiandefensecorp.com/)\n\nYes, Meridian is still in business to this day and their logo is an OCTOPUS.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3binldn13r371.png?width=125&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ab4230428d5c6deff466bb5fdb9fae39df39d515\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uh6an79x2r371.png?width=870&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=81f12f2adf06fd2c4d855afe8c61476f7b442881\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f4gbp0x73r371.png?width=792&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e0e52e1dd7695f3152ee9f1481602da0aff4f12f\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/msd0an8a3r371.png?width=869&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1b0d3ddc3454bd3addc1bb0918e952017af7dd8e\n\n[https://www.company-histories.com/The-Wackenhut-Corporation-Company-History.html](https://www.company-histories.com/The-Wackenhut-Corporation-Company-History.html)  \n\nHave fun.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIjxqks9ugo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIjxqks9ugo)\n\nThe source that reported this (Wayne Madsen) lacks credibility and has disseminated propaganda in much of his \"journalism\". Madsen has previously promoted propaganda through unsubstantiated conspiracy claims. Think COINTEL.\n\nMadsen previously served in the U.S Navy and NSA. He has been featured on such programs as 60 Minutes.\n\nGiven his involvement with confidential government programs in the past, I would be cautious of the potential for deliberate misinformation being disseminated by Madsen.\n\nIt was speculated by Channel 3 News' Nathan Baca that this may be an attempt to \"fake\" Robert Booth Nichols' death; a similar strategy employed by his business partner Samuel Israel.\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayne\\_Madsen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayne_Madsen)\n\nI don't know if Robert Booth Nichols was a CIA asset. I'm here to present information and receive scrutiny. But yeah. Weird.\n\n# What about the Octopus? That's just a crazy tall tale created by Robert Booth Nichols right?\n\nBelieve it or not, Sam Israel and Robert Booth Nichols are not the only individuals to mention the Octopus.\n\n[Freelance Journalist; Danny Casolaro](https://preview.redd.it/cwycwo7zyu371.jpg?width=240&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=606ad5e8ec900ca3f59f7b9278753d851ea51690)\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danny\\_Casolaro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danny_Casolaro)\n\n&gt;\"Joseph Daniel Casolaro (June 16, 1947 \u2013 August 10, 1991) was an American freelance writer who came to public attention in 1991 when he was found dead in a bathtub in room 517 of the Sheraton Hotel in Martinsburg, West Virginia, the medical examiner ruled the death a suicide.\"  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\"His death became controversial because his notes suggested he was in Martinsburg to meet a source about a story he called \"the Octopus.\" This centered on a sprawling collaboration involving an international cabal, and primarily featuring a number of stories familiar to journalists who worked in and around Washington, D.C. in the 1980s\u2014the Inslaw case about a software manufacturer whose owner accused the Justice Department of stealing its work product, the October Surprise theory that during the Iran hostage crisis Iran deliberately held back American hostages to help Ronald Reagan win the 1980 presidential election, the collapse of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International, and Iran\u2013Contra.\"  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\"Casolaro's family argued that he had been murdered; that before he left for Martinsburg, he had apparently told his brother that he had been frequently receiving harassing phone calls late at night; that some of them were threatening; and that if something were to happen to him while in Martinsburg, it would not be an accident. They also cited his well-known squeamishness and fear of blood tests, and stated they found it incomprehensible that if he were going to commit suicide, he would do so by cutting his wrists a dozen times. A number of law-enforcement officials also argued that his death deserved further scrutiny, and his notes were passed by his family to ABC News and Time Magazine, both of which investigated the case, but no evidence of murder was ever found.\"\n\nFrom the earlier quoting LA Times article: [https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1993-03-21-mn-13734-story.html](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1993-03-21-mn-13734-story.html)\n\nNichols had frequent contact with Casolaro just before the journalist, who was probing a web of conspiracies ranging from the Iran-Contra affair to alleged Justice Department skullduggery, was found with his wrists slashed in a West Virginia motel room.\n\nThe report, titled \u201cThe INSLAW Affair,\u201d said the Justice Department had failed to adequately investigate charges that high-level officials had stolen and misused a private firm\u2019s sophisticated computer software designed to help track criminals.\n\nRegarding the Inslaw Report:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/Epstein/comments/hmfc6k/beyond\\_ghislaine\\_the\\_maxwell\\_octopus/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Epstein/comments/hmfc6k/beyond_ghislaine_the_maxwell_octopus/)\n\nNichols acknowledged to committee investigators that he had spoken to Casolaro often and served as a sounding board for him, but would not provide a sworn statement to the House committee.\n\nThe trial, which enters its second week of testimony Monday, stems from a 1986 incident in which Nichols, armed with a concealed pistol, was taken into custody by Los Angeles police at The Palomino.\n\nNichols said he was with his brother-in-law, James Hopko (when)\n\n&gt;Without warning, Nichols testified, he was flung to the ground and two revolvers were pointed at his head. Nichols, who was carrying a concealed weapons permit from the Santa Clara County Sheriff\u2019s Department, was disarmed, handcuffed and transported to the North Hollywood LAPD station.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Nichols\u2019 suit charges that the loss of the permit led to a withdrawal of a Swiss financing for his firm, Meridian Arms Corp., to manufacture a new machine gun in South Korea.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;To buttress his client\u2019s credibility as a businessman, Nichols\u2019 lawyer introduced in court a flood of paper indicating that he had worked on numerous ventures with prominent individuals. They included Robert A. Maheu, Howard Hughes\u2019 former right-hand man; Michael A. McManus, an aide to President Ronald Reagan; Clint W. Murchison, then the owner of the Dallas Cowboys, and George K. Pender, an executive with a worldwide engineering company.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Nichols testified about discussions he had with a White House aide on the rebuilding of Lebanon while he was affiliated with Meridian\u2019s predecessor firm, Santa Monica-based First Intercontinental Development Corp. That firm supposedly specialized in secret foreign construction projects for the U.S. government.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Appended to Gates\u2019 affidavit was an Oct. 8, 1987, document stating that the FBI was investigating whether Giaquinto, Nichols and others were \u201cbuying and/or selling stocks by the use of manipulative or deceptive practices.\n\nWithout a doubt, Robert Booth Nichols was involved in mob-related investment schemes leveraging relationships he had established through the CIA, Wall Street and arms dealing ventures. Concerning, to say the least.\n\nIn his 2008 deposition, Nichols explains he was a member of the Board of Directors for George K. Pender's FIDCO.\n\nGeorge K. Pender's only business registration with any U.S State Department is as Director of First International Development Corporation (FIDCO) in Santa Monica, California.\n\n[https://www.corporationwiki.com/California/Cambria/first-intercontinental-development-corporation/40237496.aspx](https://www.corporationwiki.com/California/Cambria/first-intercontinental-development-corporation/40237496.aspx)\n\nWell, well, well.... Nichols stated FIDCO: \"specialized in secret foreign construction projects for the U.S. government.\" I wonder how common these \"secret foreign construction\" companies are?\n\nEarlier in the L.A Times article, Nichols explains being with his brother in-law James Hopko before being arrested by L.A.P.D officers.\n\n[https://www.corporationwiki.com/Hawaii/Honolulu/robert-b-nichols-P5886865.aspx](https://www.corporationwiki.com/Hawaii/Honolulu/robert-b-nichols-P5886865.aspx)\n\nThis business registration with the U.S State Department of Honolulu, lists an Ellen M. Hopko as secretary. This is Robert B. Nichols wife.\n\nThis report serves to expose certain established practices within high stakes and confidential societies.\n\nRobert Booth Nichols was investigated in 1987 by the FBI for:\n\n&gt;\"buying and/or selling stocks by the use of manipulative or deceptive practices.\"\n\nThe practice described above is the Modus Operandi of Ken Griffin/Citadel, Steve Cohen/Point72 , D.E Shaw, The Blackstone Group, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, KKR, BITG and the list goes on through Wall Street.\n\nI believe the Bond scam employed by Sam Israel and Robert Booth Nichols is the same scheme that was run by Salomon Brothers and continues to be employed by Citadel, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley (among others). Co-ordinating to short 10 year treasury bonds to keep that money printer a going.\n\nThis is the Federal Reserve's \"Secret Market\".\n\nThank you for reading.\n\nTLDR:\n\nSam Israel III and Robert Booth Nichols were involved in an elaborate U.S Treasury bond trading scheme that continues to be employed by the largest banks and funds on Wall Street.\n\nFor Bayou Management (Israel's fund), this scheme involved shadow government organizations and extremely prominent individuals in government, finance, business + organized crime. Further research of the persons and events surrounding this bizarre crime uncovers evidence of CIA arms smuggling and money laundering operations tied to the Iran-Contra Scandal, Wackenhut Corp and private prison profiteering.\n\nIf I was you though, I would read the whole post.\n\nIf you made it this far, you might be interested in further research materials:\n\nBulk references for the wrinkle brains that like to look closer.

It seems the appetite for risk is returning and prices have started appreciating rapidly. Fortunately there are still good warrants to be found at good prices.\n\n***DISCLAIMER:*** *I am not a financial advisor. I have 93 different warrants positions (80 still pre-DA) and have spent the past three months building out positions in as many good teams as I can as close to all-time lows, and I have positions in all the 12 of the warrants mentioned in this article.

The team's previous SPAC was OUST, which successfully completed a merger and the warrants are currently at $3.35, with a high price of $4.57.\n\n# GLBLW\n\n**Last Trade:** $0.69\n\n**Warrants in Units:** 1/3\n\n**Sector:** Not specified, but suggest \"proven business models as we do not intend to assume risks of unproven technologies \"\n\n**Team:** Very solid team for this price: Peter Yu (Managing Partner at Cartesian, former CEO of AIG Capital Partners, Former Director National Economic Council), Elias Dias Sese (President of Northern Europe Kraft Heinz, Former CEO of Tim Hortons), Daniel Karp (Former VP of Worldwide Business Development at Pfizer) \n\n# AGGRW\n\n**Last Trade:** $0.78\n\n**Warrants in Units:** 1/3\n\n**Sector:** Tech - Software, HCIT, Fintech, robotics/automation, EdTech  \n\n**Team:** Jay Bhatt (Former CEO, Alfresco Software; Former CEO, Blackboard), John Newton (Founder/CTO, Alfresco Software), Steven Alesio (Former Chairman/CEO, Dun &amp; Bradstreet), Carol Bartz (Former CEO of Yahoo! and Autodesk), Carl Bass (Director and Fmr CEO of Autodesk; Fmr Director, Hewlett-Packard)   \n\n# DHBC-WT \n\n**Last Trade:** $0.73\n\n**Warrants in Units:** 1/3\n\n**Sector:** Financial Services\n\n**Team:** A very solid resumed team for warrants this cheap: Robert Hurst (Former Vice Chairman/ Head of Investment Banking Division, Goldman Sachs), Richard DeMartini (Former President of Asset Management, Bank of America, Former Chairman, Discover Card). \n\n# DTOC-WT \n\n**Last Trade:** $0.78\n\n**Warrants in Units**: 1/4.

Remember when I said this post was about warrants under $1 and DTOC was the cheapest 1/4 split? Well, that was technically true, but PCPC-WT's $1.93 needs an asterisk: This SPAC is at 2.5x the scale of a normal SPAC, with a $25 per share baseline and a $28.75 strike. By that standard, these warrants at $1.93 would be worth .775 if it were a normal $10 base SPAC. \n\n**Team:** Led by Sahnjeev Mehra, founder and managing partner, Peripheras Capital. \n\n**Notable Feature:** It also has an investors-friendly CAPS incentive structure, where the founders get 6% on merger as opposed to the typical 20%, then provides payouts at certain price levels for sticking with the company long term.\n\n# BOAS-WT\n\n**Last Trade:** $0.67\n\n**Warrants in Units:** 1/3. One of the cheapest in that warrant split. \n\n**Focus:** PropTech\n\n**Team:** Scott Seligman, Chairman of The Seligman Group (a real estate development company), David Glazer (CFO, Palantir), Shane Battier (Former NBA player and VP of Analytics and Basketball Development, Miami Heat)\n\n# SGAMW (DA: REDBOX)\n\n**Last Trade:** 0.84\n\n**Valuation:** $693M, with 2021E revenues of $569M (EV 1.2x estimated revenues).\n\n**Why it's a buy:** According to conventional wisdom, Redbox is a dying company. People are moving away from conventional media like disc videogames and DVDs to all streaming. However, I think that conventional wisdom is from the perspective of those of us who have the privilege to afford internet, smart TVs and streaming services. 70% of Redbox's customers are \"late adopters\" - largely the elderly and low income. To these people, a $2 DVD rental for the latest release is a cheaper night of entertainment than most other forms, and Amazon digital movie rentals for the blockbuster new releases not on Prime are often over $6. Additionally, Redbox is pivoting to digital and supposedly more affordable for the same movies than Amazon. \n\n# LIVKW (DA: AGILETHOUGHT)\n\n**Last Trade:** 0.85\n\n**Valuation:** $482M for $184M in 2021E revenue (EV 2.6x estimated revenues)\n\n**Why it's a buy:** This is a boring IT services company that SPAC investors don't care about, heavily based around consultants in Mexico (even though the corporate HQ is in Dallas). This has led to it becoming underrated for a valuation this good, and for a company that has a good reputation in their field.

HP is the founder of Silicon Valley, and its history is much longer and more brilliant than Apple. The following recommended reasons for purchase:\n\n1. HP\u2019s printer business still has a lot of room for development, especially 3d printing technology. Its personal computers, servers, and tablets are all developing well.\n2. HP is the true representative of Silicon Valley, which has influenced generations of Americans and even people all over the world\n3. HP\u2019s current price-to-earnings ratio is 10. Apple\u2019s is close to 30. Even if it\u2019s just comparing hardware, HP is cheaper.\n4. HP\u2019s option prices are now very cheap. If you want to get quick returns, HP\u2019s short-term and long-term options can be considered.\n5. HP\u2019s current market value is only more than 30 billion U.S. dollars, so it is not very difficult to reach 100 billion U.S. dollars.\n\nSo, let\u2019s make HP the center of Silicon Valley again!",

Graber became a father-figure to Israel, as the latter learnt the reality of insider trading, front running, and the secret array of scams to scalp points from every trade.\"\n\nFreddy Graber was one of the first individuals to operate a hedge fund and market maker at the same time.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood\\_Professional\\_School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood_Professional_School)\n\nNichols describes his first assignment as collecting information from individuals in Japan, Hawaii and Australia under the instruction of people who told him they were U.S Intelligence, CIA.\n\nNichols has also starred as an actor in two films.\n\n&gt;\"I have had a few checks, yes, for residuals or whatever.  I was an advisor (Nichols was also an actor in this film, which he does not mention) for a film in 1992.... Under Siege\"\n\nThis IMDB file also shows he also starred in Full Metal Jacket (1987): [https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0629715/](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0629715/)\n\nNichols mentions the name of the attorney that organized his affairs:\n\n&gt;\"I would say that Martin Simone recommended an accountant that handled certain things for me, yes.\"\n\nMartin Simone, Attorney; California bar:\n\n[http://members.calbar.ca.gov/fal/Licensee/Detail/51584](http://members.calbar.ca.gov/fal/Licensee/Detail/51584)\n\n&gt;\"(My employer) told me they would tell me when I was to pay taxes and what I was to pay taxes on. They said they did not want anything mentioned about my involvements.\"\n\nNichols evaded taxes regularly and never had charges brought against him for this matter, He stated he:\n\n&gt;\"was never bothered by the U.S government once.\"\n\nNichols also details individuals within his network:\n\n&gt;\"I have had discussions Frank Xavier Driscoll, CIA, and with Adrian Perry, U.S Admiral. I have had discussions with Al Rankin, Fleet Ballistic Missiles, discussions with Peter Zackowski, NATO and Sole Source Armament to Picatinny Arsenal and Rock Island Arsenal on 155 caseless rounds. I have had discussions with James Hacker, worldwide chief of security, Hewlett-Packard, discussions with David Packard of Hewlett-Packard.\"\n\nEvidence of existence of the individuals that Nichols mentions instructed him to evade taxes:\n\n**Frank Xavier \"Driscoll\"** (real last name: **Archibald**): National Director of CIA Clandestine Operations until 2015:\n\n[https://obits.postandcourier.com/us/obituaries/charleston/name/francis-archibald-obituary?pid=195711520](https://obits.postandcourier.com/us/obituaries/charleston/name/francis-archibald-obituary?pid=195711520)\n\n[https://www.newsweek.com/cia-has-new-spy-guy-and-well-tell-you-who-he-163](https://www.newsweek.com/cia-has-new-spy-guy-and-well-tell-you-who-he-163)\n\n[https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2322041/CIAs-new-clandestine-spy-outed-Twitter-hours-chosen-despite-undercover.html](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2322041/CIAs-new-clandestine-spy-outed-Twitter-hours-chosen-despite-undercover.html)\n\n**Frank Carlucci:**\n\nNichols states that former Secretary of Defense Frank C. Carlucci was present at every meeting he had with Frank Xavier Driscoll. (Nichols states that Carlucci served as the Deputy Director of the CIA at this time).\n\n[https://history.defense.gov/Multimedia/Biographies/Article-View/article/571285/frank-c-carlucci/](https://history.defense.gov/Multimedia/Biographies/Article-View/article/571285/frank-c-carlucci/)\n\n**Harry Fair:**\n\n[http://www.isitaustin.org/downloads/Fair\\_bio.html](http://www.isitaustin.org/downloads/Fair_bio.html)\n\nNichols describes that Harry fair told him he\n\n&gt;\"was involved with projects that were extremely sensitive... (Fair told me) You keep what you do private and you never let this reach the United States.\"\n\n**Al Rankin:**\n\n&gt;\"Mr. Rankin was previously employed as a Chairman by Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\"\n\n[https://www.marketscreener.com/business-leaders/Alfred-Rankin-001KKQ-E/biography/](https://www.marketscreener.com/business-leaders/Alfred-Rankin-001KKQ-E/biography/)\n\nDavid Packard is the co-founder of Hewlett-Packard.\n\nHewlett-Packard was involved in a spying scandal in 2006: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hewlett-Packard\\_spying\\_scandal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hewlett-Packard_spying_scandal)\n\nDuring his deposition, Nichols implicates John Prescott Ellis' (nephew of former CIA director George H.W Bush) involvement with the Sam Israel Ponzi scheme. John Prescott Ellis is a free man and now serves as a Partner at Venture Capital firm Sand Hills Partners.\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John\\_Prescott\\_Ellis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Prescott_Ellis)\n\nNichols describes the task that John Prescott Ellis directed him to do:\n\n&gt;\"To obtain a sealed box, that of origin Chinese... from the Chinese that he said he was quite familiar with and it could not be opened. I had no responsibility as to its content, but a sealed box and it must -- it had to be a hundred million dollars\"\n\nNichols also claims that:\n\n&gt;\"Sam Israel had heard of the safety deposit box from another source, and alleged that George Soros got his money by finding one of the boxes\".\n\n(the guy says this in his deposition, just so bizarre that he would mention this specifically). \n\nA 1982 FBI report details an anti-racketeering investigation that sheds further light on the affairs of Robert Booth Nichols.\n\nObtained by News Channel 3 (KESQ) the report discloses that during and after his time with the CIA, Nichols participated in money laundering associated with narcotics and organized crime; he was also involved heavily in international arms dealing.\n\nKESQ details that Robert Booth Nichols was listed as owner of Meridian Arms Corporation. This fact is confirmed through cross-referencing this LA Times article and [OpenCorporates.com](https://OpenCorporates.com):\n\n[https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1993-03-21-mn-13734-story.html](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1993-03-21-mn-13734-story.html)\n\n&gt;\"Nichols\u2019 suit charges that the loss of the permit led to a withdrawal of Swiss financing for his firm, Meridian Arms Corp., to manufacture a new machine gun in South Korea.\"\n\nThe following link lists Robert B. Nichols as CEO of Meridian Arms Corporation:\n\n[https://opencorporates.com/companies/us\\_ca/C0853005](https://opencorporates.com/companies/us_ca/C0853005)\n\nAccording to [gun-data.com](https://gun-data.com) Meridian Arms Corp also manufactured under the following names:\n\n[https://gun-data.com/miscellaneous\\_manufactuers.html](https://gun-data.com/miscellaneous_manufactuers.html)\n\n.

Empire State Arms: [https://www.empirestatefirearms.com/](https://www.empirestatefirearms.com/)\n\nThe above OpenCorporates link also states that the business license for Meridian Arms Corp was suspended in 2018.\n\nIn the Nichols' testimony, when asked why Meridian does not have a taxation history or transaction history for Meridian; he concedes that Meridian Arms Corp did not have a single recorded transaction. It can be confirmed that he armed foreign governments (Philippines) as is stated in the 1987 FBI report. This suggests Federal Arms and Empire State Arms were used to book Meridian's sales and launder the proceeds from such sales. He refused to give a sworn statement to the house committee regarding specifics of Meridian's specific business dealings (outside of discussing the loss incurred to him as a result of his L.A.P.D apprehension).\n\nNichols also established an arms dealing company of the same name during his time in Queensland, Australia:\n\n [https://opencorporates.com/companies/au/168176592](https://opencorporates.com/companies/au/168176592)\n\nThe existing entity, Meridian Fire Arms was established in 2011 (3 years after the Israel case):\n\n[https://opencorporates.com/companies/us\\_mi/801614393](https://opencorporates.com/companies/us_mi/801614393)\n\nAs a vendor they're listed as Meridian Defense Corp. or \"MDC\":\n\n[https://meridiandefensecorp.com/](https://meridiandefensecorp.com/)\n\nYes, Meridian is still in business to this day and their logo is an OCTOPUS.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3binldn13r371.png?width=125&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ab4230428d5c6deff466bb5fdb9fae39df39d515\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uh6an79x2r371.png?width=870&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=81f12f2adf06fd2c4d855afe8c61476f7b442881\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f4gbp0x73r371.png?width=792&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e0e52e1dd7695f3152ee9f1481602da0aff4f12f\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/msd0an8a3r371.png?width=869&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1b0d3ddc3454bd3addc1bb0918e952017af7dd8e\n\n[https://www.company-histories.com/The-Wackenhut-Corporation-Company-History.html](https://www.company-histories.com/The-Wackenhut-Corporation-Company-History.html)  \n\nHave fun.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIjxqks9ugo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIjxqks9ugo)\n\nThe source that reported this (Wayne Madsen) lacks credibility and has disseminated propaganda in much of his \"journalism\". Madsen has previously promoted propaganda through unsubstantiated conspiracy claims. Think COINTEL.\n\nMadsen previously served in the U.S Navy and NSA. He has been featured on such programs as 60 Minutes.\n\nGiven his involvement with confidential government programs in the past, I would be cautious of the potential for deliberate misinformation being disseminated by Madsen.\n\nIt was speculated by Channel 3 News' Nathan Baca that this may be an attempt to \"fake\" Robert Booth Nichols' death; a similar strategy employed by his business partner Samuel Israel.\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayne\\_Madsen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayne_Madsen)\n\nI don't know if Robert Booth Nichols was a CIA asset. I'm here to present information and receive scrutiny. But yeah. Weird.\n\n# What about the Octopus? That's just a crazy tall tale created by Robert Booth Nichols right?\n\nBelieve it or not, Sam Israel and Robert Booth Nichols are not the only individuals to mention the Octopus.\n\n[Freelance Journalist; Danny Casolaro](https://preview.redd.it/cwycwo7zyu371.jpg?width=240&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=606ad5e8ec900ca3f59f7b9278753d851ea51690)\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danny\\_Casolaro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danny_Casolaro)\n\n&gt;\"Joseph Daniel Casolaro (June 16, 1947 \u2013 August 10, 1991) was an American freelance writer who came to public attention in 1991 when he was found dead in a bathtub in room 517 of the Sheraton Hotel in Martinsburg, West Virginia, the medical examiner ruled the death a suicide.\"  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\"His death became controversial because his notes suggested he was in Martinsburg to meet a source about a story he called \"the Octopus.\" This centered on a sprawling collaboration involving an international cabal, and primarily featuring a number of stories familiar to journalists who worked in and around Washington, D.C. in the 1980s\u2014the Inslaw case about a software manufacturer whose owner accused the Justice Department of stealing its work product, the October Surprise theory that during the Iran hostage crisis Iran deliberately held back American hostages to help Ronald Reagan win the 1980 presidential election, the collapse of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International, and Iran\u2013Contra.\"  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\"Casolaro's family argued that he had been murdered; that before he left for Martinsburg, he had apparently told his brother that he had been frequently receiving harassing phone calls late at night; that some of them were threatening; and that if something were to happen to him while in Martinsburg, it would not be an accident. They also cited his well-known squeamishness and fear of blood tests, and stated they found it incomprehensible that if he were going to commit suicide, he would do so by cutting his wrists a dozen times. A number of law-enforcement officials also argued that his death deserved further scrutiny, and his notes were passed by his family to ABC News and Time Magazine, both of which investigated the case, but no evidence of murder was ever found.\"\n\nFrom the earlier quoting LA Times article: [https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1993-03-21-mn-13734-story.html](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1993-03-21-mn-13734-story.html)\n\nNichols had frequent contact with Casolaro just before the journalist, who was probing a web of conspiracies ranging from the Iran-Contra affair to alleged Justice Department skullduggery, was found with his wrists slashed in a West Virginia motel room.\n\nThe report, titled \u201cThe INSLAW Affair,\u201d said the Justice Department had failed to adequately investigate charges that high-level officials had stolen and misused a private firm\u2019s sophisticated computer software designed to help track criminals.\n\nRegarding the Inslaw Report:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/Epstein/comments/hmfc6k/beyond\\_ghislaine\\_the\\_maxwell\\_octopus/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Epstein/comments/hmfc6k/beyond_ghislaine_the_maxwell_octopus/)\n\nNichols acknowledged to committee investigators that he had spoken to Casolaro often and served as a sounding board for him, but would not provide a sworn statement to the House committee.\n\nThe trial, which enters its second week of testimony Monday, stems from a 1986 incident in which Nichols, armed with a concealed pistol, was taken into custody by Los Angeles police at The Palomino.\n\nNichols said he was with his brother-in-law, James Hopko (when)\n\n&gt;Without warning, Nichols testified, he was flung to the ground and two revolvers were pointed at his head. Nichols, who was carrying a concealed weapons permit from the Santa Clara County Sheriff\u2019s Department, was disarmed, handcuffed and transported to the North Hollywood LAPD station.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Nichols\u2019 suit charges that the loss of the permit led to a withdrawal of a Swiss financing for his firm, Meridian Arms Corp., to manufacture a new machine gun in South Korea.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;To buttress his client\u2019s credibility as a businessman, Nichols\u2019 lawyer introduced in court a flood of paper indicating that he had worked on numerous ventures with prominent individuals. They included Robert A. Maheu, Howard Hughes\u2019 former right-hand man; Michael A. McManus, an aide to President Ronald Reagan; Clint W. Murchison, then the owner of the Dallas Cowboys, and George K. Pender, an executive with a worldwide engineering company.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Nichols testified about discussions he had with a White House aide on the rebuilding of Lebanon while he was affiliated with Meridian\u2019s predecessor firm, Santa Monica-based First Intercontinental Development Corp. That firm supposedly specialized in secret foreign construction projects for the U.S. government.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Appended to Gates\u2019 affidavit was an Oct. 8, 1987, document stating that the FBI was investigating whether Giaquinto, Nichols and others were \u201cbuying and/or selling stocks by the use of manipulative or deceptive practices.\n\nWithout a doubt, Robert Booth Nichols was involved in mob-related investment schemes leveraging relationships he had established through the CIA, Wall Street and arms dealing ventures. Concerning, to say the least.\n\nIn his 2008 deposition, Nichols explains he was a member of the Board of Directors for George K. Pender's FIDCO.\n\nGeorge K. Pender's only business registration with any U.S State Department is as Director of First International Development Corporation (FIDCO) in Santa Monica, California.\n\n[https://www.corporationwiki.com/California/Cambria/first-intercontinental-development-corporation/40237496.aspx](https://www.corporationwiki.com/California/Cambria/first-intercontinental-development-corporation/40237496.aspx)\n\nWell, well, well.... Nichols stated FIDCO: \"specialized in secret foreign construction projects for the U.S. government.\" I wonder how common these \"secret foreign construction\" companies are?\n\nEarlier in the L.A Times article, Nichols explains being with his brother in-law James Hopko before being arrested by L.A.P.D officers.\n\n[https://www.corporationwiki.com/Hawaii/Honolulu/robert-b-nichols-P5886865.aspx](https://www.corporationwiki.com/Hawaii/Honolulu/robert-b-nichols-P5886865.aspx)\n\nThis business registration with the U.S State Department of Honolulu, lists an Ellen M. Hopko as secretary. This is Robert B. Nichols wife.\n\nThis report serves to expose certain established practices within high stakes and confidential societies.\n\nRobert Booth Nichols was investigated in 1987 by the FBI for:\n\n&gt;\"buying and/or selling stocks by the use of manipulative or deceptive practices.\"\n\nThe practice described above is the Modus Operandi of Ken Griffin/Citadel, Steve Cohen/Point72 , D.E Shaw, The Blackstone Group, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, KKR, BITG and the list goes on through Wall Street.\n\nI believe the Bond scam employed by Sam Israel and Robert Booth Nichols is the same scheme that was run by Salomon Brothers and continues to be employed by Citadel, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley (among others). Co-ordinating to short 10 year treasury bonds to keep that money printer a going.\n\nThis is the Federal Reserve's \"Secret Market\".\n\nThank you for reading.\n\nTLDR:\n\nSam Israel III and Robert Booth Nichols were involved in an elaborate U.S Treasury bond trading scheme that continues to be employed by the largest banks and funds on Wall Street.\n\nFor Bayou Management (Israel's fund), this scheme involved shadow government organizations and extremely prominent individuals in government, finance, business + organized crime. Further research of the persons and events surrounding this bizarre crime uncovers evidence of CIA arms smuggling and money laundering operations tied to the Iran-Contra Scandal, Wackenhut Corp and private prison profiteering.\n\nIf I was you though, I would read the whole post.\n\nIf you made it this far, you might be interested in further research materials:\n\nBulk references for the wrinkle brains that like to look closer.

The team's previous SPAC was OUST, which successfully completed a merger and the warrants are currently at $3.35, with a high price of $4.57.\n\n# GLBLW\n\n**Last Trade:** $0.69\n\n**Warrants in Units:** 1/3\n\n**Sector:** Not specified, but suggest \"proven business models as we do not intend to assume risks of unproven technologies \"\n\n**Team:** Very solid team for this price: Peter Yu (Managing Partner at Cartesian, former CEO of AIG Capital Partners, Former Director National Economic Council), Elias Dias Sese (President of Northern Europe Kraft Heinz, Former CEO of Tim Hortons), Daniel Karp (Former VP of Worldwide Business Development at Pfizer) \n\n# AGGRW\n\n**Last Trade:** $0.78\n\n**Warrants in Units:** 1/3\n\n**Sector:** Tech - Software, HCIT, Fintech, robotics/automation, EdTech  \n\n**Team:** Jay Bhatt (Former CEO, Alfresco Software; Former CEO, Blackboard), John Newton (Founder/CTO, Alfresco Software), Steven Alesio (Former Chairman/CEO, Dun &amp; Bradstreet), Carol Bartz (Former CEO of Yahoo! and Autodesk), Carl Bass (Director and Fmr CEO of Autodesk; Fmr Director, Hewlett-Packard)   \n\n# DHBC-WT \n\n**Last Trade:** $0.73\n\n**Warrants in Units:** 1/3\n\n**Sector:** Financial Services\n\n**Team:** A very solid resumed team for warrants this cheap: Robert Hurst (Former Vice Chairman/ Head of Investment Banking Division, Goldman Sachs), Richard DeMartini (Former President of Asset Management, Bank of America, Former Chairman, Discover Card). \n\n# DTOC-WT \n\n**Last Trade:** $0.78\n\n**Warrants in Units**: 1/4. This is the cheapest 1/4 split warrant on the market as of last trade Friday.\n\n**Sector:** Healthcare Tech \n\n**The team:** Kevin Nazemi (Fmr Co-CEO, Oscar Health),Bradley Fluegel (Former Chief Strategy Officer, Walgreens &amp; Anthem), Jim Moffatt (Former Vice Chairman/Global CEO, Deloitte Consulting). \n\n# PCPC-WT\n\n**Last Trade:** $1.93\n\n**Warrants in Units:** 1/4. Remember when I said this post was about warrants under $1 and DTOC was the cheapest 1/4 split? Well, that was technically true, but PCPC-WT's $1.93 needs an asterisk: This SPAC is at 2.5x the scale of a normal SPAC, with a $25 per share baseline and a $28.75 strike. By that standard, these warrants at $1.93 would be worth .775 if it were a normal $10 base SPAC. \n\n**Team:** Led by Sahnjeev Mehra, founder and managing partner, Peripheras Capital. \n\n**Notable Feature:** It also has an investors-friendly CAPS incentive structure, where the founders get 6% on merger as opposed to the typical 20%, then provides payouts at certain price levels for sticking with the company long term.\n\n# BOAS-WT\n\n**Last Trade:** $0.67\n\n**Warrants in Units:** 1/3. One of the cheapest in that warrant split. \n\n**Focus:** PropTech\n\n**Team:** Scott Seligman, Chairman of The Seligman Group (a real estate development company), David Glazer (CFO, Palantir), Shane Battier (Former NBA player and VP of Analytics and Basketball Development, Miami Heat)\n\n# SGAMW (DA: REDBOX)\n\n**Last Trade:** 0.84\n\n**Valuation:** $693M, with 2021E revenues of $569M (EV 1.2x estimated revenues).\n\n**Why it's a buy:** According to conventional wisdom, Redbox is a dying company. People are moving away from conventional media like disc videogames and DVDs to all streaming. However, I think that conventional wisdom is from the perspective of those of us who have the privilege to afford internet, smart TVs and streaming services. 70% of Redbox's customers are \"late adopters\" - largely the elderly and low income. To these people, a $2 DVD rental for the latest release is a cheaper night of entertainment than most other forms, and Amazon digital movie rentals for the blockbuster new releases not on Prime are often over $6. Additionally, Redbox is pivoting to digital and supposedly more affordable for the same movies than Amazon. \n\n# LIVKW (DA: AGILETHOUGHT)\n\n**Last Trade:** 0.85\n\n**Valuation:** $482M for $184M in 2021E revenue (EV 2.6x estimated revenues)\n\n**Why it's a buy:** This is a boring IT services company that SPAC investors don't care about, heavily based around consultants in Mexico (even though the corporate HQ is in Dallas). This has led to it becoming underrated for a valuation this good, and for a company that has a good reputation in their field. They trade at very favorable multiples compared to other stocks in their field. One doesn't have to be a groundbreaking product for a company to be a good stock.\n\nGood luck!",

HP is the founder of Silicon Valley, and its history is much longer and more brilliant than Apple. The following recommended reasons for purchase:\n\n1. HP\u2019s printer business still has a lot of room for development, especially 3d printing technology. Its personal computers, servers, and tablets are all developing well.\n2. HP is the true representative of Silicon Valley, which has influenced generations of Americans and even people all over the world\n3. HP\u2019s current price-to-earnings ratio is 10. Apple\u2019s is close to 30. Even if it\u2019s just comparing hardware, HP is cheaper.\n4. HP\u2019s option prices are now very cheap. If you want to get quick returns, HP\u2019s short-term and long-term options can be considered.\n5. HP\u2019s current market value is only more than 30 billion U.S. dollars, so it is not very difficult to reach 100 billion U.S. dollars.\n\nSo, let\u2019s make HP the center of Silicon Valley again!",

Lawson interviewed Israel for the book, commenting in an interview with CBS News that he was surprised at **\"how much truth there was to Israel's stories\"**.\n\n The book covers Israel's attempt to save his company Bayou as well as his attempt to fake his death.\n\nUnfortunately the CBS link in the above Wikipedia has been removed/scrubbed, so I found it on Wayback Machine:\n\n[https://web.archive.org/web/20120711063138/https://www.cbsnews.com/8301-504367\\_162-57469215-504367/octopus-sam-israel-the-secret-market-and-wall-streets-wildest-con-by-guy-lawson/](https://web.archive.org/web/20120711063138/https://www.cbsnews.com/8301-504367_162-57469215-504367/octopus-sam-israel-the-secret-market-and-wall-streets-wildest-con-by-guy-lawson/)\n\nLet's cross-reference:\n\nLawson (the author):\n\n&gt;\"(I was surprised by) how much truth there was to Israel's stories. The wilder and taller the tales got, the more there was a basis in historical reality. Like the existence of Federal Reserve bonds stolen from the Chinese government by the Japanese during the Invasion of Nanking in the Second World War.\"  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\"when I reported the story I discovered that there actually is a chance the bonds are real. Leading historians and special forces soldiers all said there was more than a little truth to the legend called Yamashita's Gold.\" :\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yamashita%27s\\_gold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yamashita%27s_gold)\n\nAfter the collapse of Israel's fund Bayou Management, Sam Israel faked his death. This is further detailed in the following Independent article linked below.\n\n# The Arrest of Sam Israel and the Fallout that Followed:\n\n[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/get-rich-or-pretend-die-trying-wall-street-trader-who-faked-his-own-suicide-8092737.html](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/get-rich-or-pretend-die-trying-wall-street-trader-who-faked-his-own-suicide-8092737.html)\n\n&gt;\"Apprenticed into a hedge fund run by a legendary trader, Freddy Graber, Israel was taught the black arts of making money on Wall Street. Graber became a father-figure to Israel, as the latter learnt the reality of insider trading, front running, and the secret array of scams to scalp points from every trade.\"\n\nFreddy Graber was one of the first individuals to operate a hedge fund and market maker at the same time. A strategy employed today by Citadel and countless market making funds/banks on Wall Street.\n\nFrederic J. Graber, Alumni of Princeton University and Harvard University passed away in 2007:\n\nLehman Brothers paid notice obituary to their former colleague displayed in New York Times:\n\n[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9800E0D8173AF933A05752C1A9619C8B63&amp;legacy=true&amp;status=nf](https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9800E0D8173AF933A05752C1A9619C8B63&amp;legacy=true&amp;status=nf)\n\n***Further Excepts from Octopus shed light on Frederic J. Graber's business:***\n\n&gt;\"Frederic J. Graber and Company operated on the thirteenth floor of 1 New York Plaza, a fifty-story skyscraper that housed Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley ( &amp; Salomon Brothers), and powerful law firms. Graber's trading room was in a suite of offices with a dozen or so other independent hedge funds.

They also cited his well-known squeamishness and fear of blood tests, and stated they found it incomprehensible that if he were going to commit suicide, he would do so by cutting his wrists a dozen times. A number of law-enforcement officials also argued that his death deserved further scrutiny, and his notes were passed by his family to ABC News and Time Magazine, both of which investigated the case, but no evidence of murder was ever found.\"\n\nFrom the earlier quoting LA Times article: [https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1993-03-21-mn-13734-story.html](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1993-03-21-mn-13734-story.html)\n\nNichols had frequent contact with Casolaro just before the journalist, who was probing a web of conspiracies ranging from the Iran-Contra affair to alleged Justice Department skullduggery, was found with his wrists slashed in a West Virginia motel room.\n\nThe report, titled \u201cThe INSLAW Affair,\u201d said the Justice Department had failed to adequately investigate charges that high-level officials had stolen and misused a private firm\u2019s sophisticated computer software designed to help track criminals.\n\nRegarding the Inslaw Report:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/Epstein/comments/hmfc6k/beyond\\_ghislaine\\_the\\_maxwell\\_octopus/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Epstein/comments/hmfc6k/beyond_ghislaine_the_maxwell_octopus/)\n\nNichols acknowledged to committee investigators that he had spoken to Casolaro often and served as a sounding board for him, but would not provide a sworn statement to the House committee.\n\nThe trial, which enters its second week of testimony Monday, stems from a 1986 incident in which Nichols, armed with a concealed pistol, was taken into custody by Los Angeles police at The Palomino.\n\nNichols said he was with his brother-in-law, James Hopko (when)\n\n&gt;Without warning, Nichols testified, he was flung to the ground and two revolvers were pointed at his head. Nichols, who was carrying a concealed weapons permit from the Santa Clara County Sheriff\u2019s Department, was disarmed, handcuffed and transported to the North Hollywood LAPD station.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Nichols\u2019 suit charges that the loss of the permit led to a withdrawal of a Swiss financing for his firm, Meridian Arms Corp., to manufacture a new machine gun in South Korea.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;To buttress his client\u2019s credibility as a businessman, Nichols\u2019 lawyer introduced in court a flood of paper indicating that he had worked on numerous ventures with prominent individuals. They included Robert A. Maheu, Howard Hughes\u2019 former right-hand man; Michael A. McManus, an aide to President Ronald Reagan; Clint W. Murchison, then the owner of the Dallas Cowboys, and George K. Pender, an executive with a worldwide engineering company.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Nichols testified about discussions he had with a White House aide on the rebuilding of Lebanon while he was affiliated with Meridian\u2019s predecessor firm, Santa Monica-based First Intercontinental Development Corp. That firm supposedly specialized in secret foreign construction projects for the U.S. government.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Appended to Gates\u2019 affidavit was an Oct. 8, 1987, document stating that the FBI was investigating whether Giaquinto, Nichols and others were \u201cbuying and/or selling stocks by the use of manipulative or deceptive practices.\n\nWithout a doubt, Robert Booth Nichols was involved in mob-related investment schemes leveraging relationships he had established through the CIA, Wall Street and arms dealing ventures. Concerning, to say the least.\n\nIn his 2008 deposition, Nichols explains he was a member of the Board of Directors for George K. Pender's FIDCO.\n\nGeorge K. Pender's only business registration with any U.S State Department is as Director of First International Development Corporation (FIDCO) in Santa Monica, California.\n\n[https://www.corporationwiki.com/California/Cambria/first-intercontinental-development-corporation/40237496.aspx](https://www.corporationwiki.com/California/Cambria/first-intercontinental-development-corporation/40237496.aspx)\n\nWell, well, well.... Nichols stated FIDCO: \"specialized in secret foreign construction projects for the U.S. government.\" I wonder how common these \"secret foreign construction\" companies are?\n\nEarlier in the L.A Times article, Nichols explains being with his brother in-law James Hopko before being arrested by L.A.P.D officers.\n\n[https://www.corporationwiki.com/Hawaii/Honolulu/robert-b-nichols-P5886865.aspx](https://www.corporationwiki.com/Hawaii/Honolulu/robert-b-nichols-P5886865.aspx)\n\nThis business registration with the U.S State Department of Honolulu, lists an Ellen M.

Co-ordinating to short 10 year treasury bonds to keep that money printer a going.\n\nThis is the Federal Reserve's \"Secret Market\".\n\nThank you for reading.\n\nTLDR:\n\nSam Israel III and Robert Booth Nichols were involved in an elaborate U.S Treasury bond trading scheme that continues to be employed by the largest banks and funds on Wall Street.\n\nFor Bayou Management (Israel's fund), this scheme involved shadow government organizations and extremely prominent individuals in government, finance, business + organized crime. Further research of the persons and events surrounding this bizarre crime uncovers evidence of CIA arms smuggling and money laundering operations tied to the Iran-Contra Scandal, Wackenhut Corp and private prison profiteering.\n\nIf I was you though, I would read the whole post.\n\nIf you made it this far, you might be interested in further research materials:\n\nBulk references for the wrinkle brains that like to look closer.

        "selftext": "Hello everyone, \n\nI believe that $AMD is on the verge of experiencing a catalyst that will push the stock to a new ATH. As many of us know $AMD has been trading sideways and down for the past year (with some noise) since last October. I feel fairly certain that that is about to change.\n\nLast October $AMD announced a merger with $XLNX. The two giant companies have been working it out since that time. Recently, both companies share holders overwhelmingly voted in favor of the merger. \n\nTo summarize what this merger means to $AMD we're talking about increased revenue, increased profit margin, better synergy and heading towards better products. The number 1 thing $AMD is going to get out of this? A better shot at taking down $INTC for the cloud market. A company with a market cap of roughly 225 billion compared to $AMD's 100 billion. So this is a David vs Goliath moment.\n\nThere's plenty of articles written out there on how this changes the financials and prospects for $AMD but I know you guys aren't going to read it if I re-write it here. To put it simply: This is a big deal. If you felt bad about missing $NVDA's stocksplit run, this is the potential chance of catching the 'next' big chip manf. movement.\n\nSo why am I writing this now instead of last October? Well, it's because things changed last week. We know who the customer is now: $GOOG.\n\nThat's right. A 1.67T company is taping $AMD over intel to help support their cloud.\n\nProof: [https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/06/17/why-amd-stock-rallied-on-thursday/?source=eptyholnk0000202&amp;utm\\_source=yahoo-host&amp;utm\\_medium=feed&amp;utm\\_campaign=article](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/06/17/why-amd-stock-rallied-on-thursday/?source=eptyholnk0000202&amp;utm_source=yahoo-host&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=article)\n\nSo we know they picked up $XLNX. Now we know they are teeing up for $GOOG. This is freaking huge. Not to mention they also acquired business from $TSLA, another 600B+ company. \n\nProof: [https://fortune.com/2021/05/31/amd-tesla-contract-chips-infotainment-system-lisa-su/](https://fortune.com/2021/05/31/amd-tesla-contract-chips-infotainment-system-lisa-su/)\n\nSo, let's list them out...\n\nCatalysts:\n\n1. $XLNX Merger\n2. $TSLA contract\n3. $GOOG partnership\n\nThis is clearly a big picture strategy on $AMD's part to push $INTC's weakening cloud business straight into the grave and take it's spot. I believe if $AMD is succcessful they will eventually reach a valuation closer to 200-300 billion dollars within the next 1-2 years. That's a 200-300$ share price. \n\nSo what am I suggesting?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. I believe that post merger the fair value of $AMD is closer to 120-160 a share\n2. Without the merger $AMD has a value of about 120 a share                                                             \n(due to new contracts and overall market conditions. Just look at $NVDA's recent 50% run. Staying neck to neck as a competitor puts them at 120. But they have new business to justify it instead of black magic stock splits)\n\nIs there TA to support this? You bet there is. I use 2D time frames to wash out noise. I made some small crayon circles to give the picture some scope. You can use a 1W time frame and the analysis is the same. The stock's slow moving averages have begun to move higher and are approaching a cross, moving the stock towards positive. In simple terms: Gaining share value on average, every 2 days. And that rate is growing. The OBV is increasing meaning that **someone** 'aka Wall Street' is secretly scooping up shares and holding onto them. They are doing all of this while keeping the stock suppressed well below it's ATH. I believe they are intentionally gathering as much as they can before the catalysts combine and create a giant bull run. This is a long term run that could make a lot of people rich. The moment when $AMD sprints after $INTC and $NVDA. We all know as gamers and redditors that $AMD has become much much stronger and better in recent years. It's been amazing to watch their progress.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[$AMD 2D time Frame](https://preview.redd.it/ueoex1s30q671.jpg?width=2448&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cae96daec77945f519f2c1a112456ec06399e2b3)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere on the 1 week you can see the faintest flicker of bullish life. This is due to the recent contract developments and the quickly approaching date of the merger. As I wrote above, **the catalyst is incoming**.\n\n[1 week time frame](https://preview.redd.it/9f80a7ur0q671.jpg?width=2440&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=31722579984b09e8fa30bcf913e22b2d41a96c5c)\n\nSo. When is the merger? I am sure you want some dates and some juicy possible plays. Here you go...\n\nWe've got 3 approvals that have to happen. \n\n1. EU - Believed to have no problems and will probably be approved end of June, end of July at the latest.\n2. UK - July 6th Deadline. Also rumored to have 0 problems\n3. CCP - This one there's no rumored date, but CCP supposedly has no issues as well.\n\nWhat is Wall Street doing? They are both shorting the stock while sweeping July calls as well as 2 year leaps. Take a look at July:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou've got 19498 calls purchased for July 16th at a 90$ strike. That sure sounds like Wall Street betting on it hitting 90$... after something happens. But we know what that is. It's the merger. \n\n[Unusual Option Chain July 16th](https://preview.redd.it/s3ez29jl2q671.jpg?width=942&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ae8892e1f6a9a53eef3d2dc7a56f57c5a60926be)\n\nHow is this unusual? Take a look at the week prior:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[You could sum this up and it's barely even the volume for the 90$ strike on July 16th](https://preview.redd.it/53uatc9r2q671.jpg?width=944&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=42bc7cd9650553fe2f3f34107f10c29c8a5e7ad6)\n\nSo how to interpret this? Well, I read this as Wall Street ***knowing*** what's about to happen. I believe they know the status of the merger, and approximately how far it's going to take the stock. I believe we're looking at $AMD pushing above 90$ by Mid July. This is a potential 10 bagger. Especially with them trying to push down $AMD's price today, now is a good opportunity to get in.\n\nSo what's the play? The easiest one is the 7/16/21 90$ strike. Go alongside wall Street and when you're happy with the profit--sell it. The merger could be announced any day so buying to at least that date is wise (IMO -- but I am just a degenerate not a financial expert). \n\nBuying longer could potentially let you capture more of the run if things play out the way I think it will. You could also take advantage of the current low to grab leaps and sit back and watch how this story unfolds over the next 2 years. Either way, there's real potential here in something most people are considering dead in the water.\n\nI am currently holding 119 contracts. A large portion are for the 7/16/21 90$. So yes, my money is on this play and continues to be what I pursue. This is my YOLO.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy recommendations: Buy shares, Buy calls for mid july. Buy leaps. If you buy shares wait for the catalyst to occur. When it reaches an apex, start selling $CCs because the IV is going to grow. \n\nAs a disclaimer, I am not a financial expert. I am just a retail stock trader. I love to do TA as a hobby. I truly believe that $AMD is being suppressed as Wall Street 'fattens' their positions. You know what I say? Fuck 'em. They think they are hiding what they are doing but I definitely see it. They are preparing and we can too. And, if we're right, we can make more than them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBest of luck out there. I hope you enjoyed my DD. I don't post DD often on WSB, but I hope y'all enjoyed the read. You guys are great and I love you all.",

        "selftext": "AMD's latest financial reports blew all estimates out of the water... and their latest guidance for 50% growth (up from 37%) is conservative. Here is why:\n\nFUNDAMENTALS: IT'S ALL ABOUT ENTERTAINMENT\n\nIn a post COVID-19 world, people will continue to flock towards entertainment.\n\nAs  confirmed by both TESLA and AMD recently, the latest Model X and S will  bring AMD silicon (GPU &amp; APU). This is HUGE, because this feature  will eventually trickle down as an optional to the Model 3 and rest of  the Tesla fleet. Why is this important? Just listen to Elon Musk drool  over PS5 performance on road trips with autonomous driving. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vl\\_-bFNRJaw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vl_-bFNRJaw)\n\nBut that IS NOT ALL, as Valve will be launching a new portable handheld. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFn6LzUFTTA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFn6LzUFTTA)\n\nIn essence PS4, PS5, XBOX X &amp; S and Valve are all going FULL AMD.\n\nWho do you think Ford, GM, Chrysler, Mercedes, BMW, Audi, Volkswagen, Renault/Nissan will go with?\n\nENTERTAINMENT IS KEY and AMD is all over it.\n\nThis  is also HUGE as entertainment software will be tailored to AMD's  processing pipeline. Unreal Engine 5 is the perfect example, which  ALREADY performs better on a 6800XT than it does on a RTX3080 (up to 12%  better, as per Digital Foundry's performance benchmark - see screenshot  and video link below).\n\n[AMD 6800XT on left with 61fps - Nvidia RTX3080 on right with 56fps](https://preview.redd.it/eruzko9mwy471.jpg?width=1289&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5fcbb478a1bcc940bd8c564b5d6b6ace551aa401)\n\n(digital foundry's benchmarks) [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C99VwDGyLg0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C99VwDGyLg0)\n\nUnreal  Engine 5 (with Lumen) will make Nvidia Ray Tracing a thing of the past.  This software solution is much more efficient at managing illumination,  making it available for non-RTX hardware.\n\nIn  addition, enthusiasts are really pumped with AMD's latest presentation  at Computex, where they presented Fidelity FX SuperResolution. It aims  to provide up to 2x performance while super sampling images up to 4K.  And the kicker is that this solution will be available to ALL.\n\nIntel's  Raja Koduri (Head of Intel GPU, formerly an AMD employee) has already  confirmed they are looking into AMD's Fidelity FX SR (as per his twitter  post days ago): [https://twitter.com/Rajaontheedge/status/1399964541291622407?ref\\_src=twsrc%5Etfw](https://twitter.com/Rajaontheedge/status/1399964541291622407?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\nSo yeah, AMD is the future of GAMING.\n\nBut on the stock analysis front, AMD has also begun its climb towards previous highs.\n\nIt has made a huge recovery since my latest post, when it was trading in the low $70's.\n\nJust imagine that AMD is trading at a Price/Earnings multiple of 34, with a market cap of $98.7B\n\nNvidia is trading at a P/E of 84 (over twice as much), with a market cap of $444B (over 4 times more).\n\nBut when you look at the financials, the differences shrink.\n\nOn Revenue, AMD has sales of $9.7B and net profits of $2.5B. Nvidia sold $16.6B for a net $4.3B.\n\nHow does that support Nvidia being over 4 times more expensive than AMD? It just doesn't.\n\nIf AMD were to trade at the same multiples: EPS of 2.38 \\* NVIDIA's P/E of 84.28 = $200 per share.\n\nAt $200 per share, AMD's market cap would be $243B... STLL HALF OF NVIDIA!!!! (WTF?!?!).\n\nThink about it, it is bound to close the distance towards $200 per share in the next 12 months.\n\nThe reasons are simple: Tesla, Valve, Unreal Engine 5, Ryzen 3D stacking and 50% growth for 2021.\n\nThe Xilinx deal WILL CLOSE in the next 6 months. THE BREAKOUT is IMMINENT!!!\n\nTo summarize, the product pipeline is AMAZING, not to mention the leaks on RDNA3 and Ryzen 4.\n\nThe new clientele is incredible: TESLA and Valve, added to Microsoft and Sony.\n\nJust imagine Xilinx FPGA accelerators integrated to AMD's Intellectual Property. Fuel the rockets!!!\n\nREMEMBER: In a matter of months you will be kicking yourself for ignoring this post!\n\nThe MOON is for amateurs.... WE'RE GOING TO MARS BABY!!!... with TESLA AND AMD!!!\n\nMARS - THE RED PLANET... WITH LISA AND ELON. PRIMATES AND APES TO COLONIZE IT IN 2022!!!\n\n..... ALL ABOARD!!!!",

        "selftext": "\n**Basics**\n\nAs long as you haven't been living under a fucking rock for the last decade, you know that AMD is a major player in electronic devices. While it has a minority hold in its markets, it still has a considerable market share AND has a hand in both GPUs and CPUs. It's versatile.\n\nWhile the silicon shortage is still big and doesn't show any signs of slowing, AMD is still most likely making a shitload of profit from the continuous buyouts of graphics cards for mining and the continuous selling of CPUs.\n\n**EPS/Financial history**\n\nAMD has been continuously crushing quarterly earnings targets for at least the past year, and shows no signs of slowing. It has consistently maintained a steady and rising profit.\n\n[Constantly winning](https://preview.redd.it/qz0qs58rh9571.png?width=332&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d615f35e833c3563f23d4de50afe3956f490d61b)\n\nOn top of this, the company has a total cash balance of 3.12 billion and a total debt of only 551 million, which is fucking great.\n\n[It's doing great with managing its debt and total cash to say the least](https://preview.redd.it/vh2sh5xai9571.png?width=422&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=61451edd2ef36120f80b83aefbfbce123fe2813e)\n\nNot made up your mind yet? If not, I have even more great news for you! The company has been constantly underestimated/undervalued despite all these great numbers. The past 6 months have been shit which isn't to say it's been terrible in the long run which it definitely has not, but for a company that holds so much market in two major component categories at both the business and consumer level it's ridiculous for the stock to be consistently falling.\n\n[Constantly going down](https://preview.redd.it/j2pavto0j9571.png?width=434&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=26816d6c905488484879bc98f527d8ac15accef9)\n\n**Shorts and shares**\n\nThe company is decently shorted with around 7% of the shares being shorted for a company with a solid background, which could be a disaster waiting to happen. Again, it's not heavily shorted by any means but I don't think 7% is something to scoff at.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zk34ou1sl9571.png?width=427&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6215e701d1970588345fb0c063ae217516419a0c\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Memeablility**\n\nNow that we've gone over all the boring numbers, let's talk about the memability of the company. It's a fucking computer parts company. Computers=gaming, gaming=memes. It's simple logic.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**More general points**\n\nAMD has a solid community reputation, and while the performance its components put out is not on par with that of nvidia and intel, the products are generally more user/consumer friendly and cheaper, plus not everyone is looking to buy an RTX 6090 with liquid shit cooling built in for the unaffordable price of a kidney. AMD is geared more towards the average consumer which makes up a large portion of the computer market. Not only this but AMD chips are appearing more and more in laptops and pre-built computers. Another small point is that Microsoft is using AMD chips in their new generation of Xbox.\n\nAgain, all of this is speculation and I'm not telling anyone what decision to make, this is just my take on it.",

Dr. Lisa Su is still thumbs up!\n\nRecent events provide a **HIGH degree of certainty** that AMD\u2019s **MISSION will be successful**.\n\nNamely:\n\n**1- AMD Genoa (Zen 4) to have 128 cores (256 threads) winning the DATACENTER (INTEL admits)**\n\nAMD was already taking market share from Intel in the datacenter, but the latest leak (from the reputable Jim of AdoredTV / **HE's BACK!!!**) has Intel\u2019s own internal presentations **admitting AMD will EXTEND the LEAD** in the Datacenter (screenshot below).\n\n[Leak from the reputable Jim of AdoredTV - The Scottish king is BACK!!!](https://preview.redd.it/aajw3pq5bw571.jpg?width=1299&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e3bcd4f06a39c9bdae4c233fe7fb2e2c1ee81d1a)\n\nWatch his latest video analysis here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNs432VgxmQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNs432VgxmQ)\n\nHis confirmation tweet here: [https://twitter.com/AdoredTV/status/1405161144843739148](https://twitter.com/AdoredTV/status/1405161144843739148)\n\nIn  essence, one should expect that if core count is going up for Zen 4  (from 64 to 128), at the VERY least, consumer chips will go from 16 to  24. Furthermore, Threadripper **Zen 4 will be a BEAST**.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**2- AMD 6900XTX LC (liquid cooled) spotted.**\n\nAMD already achieved the #1 World RECORD in FireStrike last month, breaking 3300MHz in a 6900XT.\n\n[https://www.techpowerup.com/282216/radeon-rx-6900-xt-overclocked-to-3321mhz-breaks-firestrike-world-record](https://www.techpowerup.com/282216/radeon-rx-6900-xt-overclocked-to-3321mhz-breaks-firestrike-world-record)\n\nHowever,  that is NOT their BEST chip.

        "selftext": "To start off I do have a position in NVIDIA but nonetheless the reason for this DD is strictly information not persuasive. I truly believe NVIDIA is *undervalued* currently. ***I believe NVDIA will reach 800 pre-split (200 post 4-1 split) with the current momentum going for the stock along with a shift to tech soon.***\n\n\u00a0If you didn't know already, NVIDIA designs graphics processing units for the gaming and professional markets, as well as system on a chip units for the mobile computing and automotive market.\u00a0\n\n*EARNINGS*\u00a0\n\n**NVIDIA recently had its earnings report in which they reported $3.66 earnings per share for the quarter, beating the consensus estimate of $3.28 by $0.38.** They recorded revenue of $5.66 billion, up 84 percent from a year earlier and up 13 percent from the previous quarter, with record revenue from the company\u2019s Gaming, Data Center and Professional Visualization platforms. Gaming revenue of $2.76 billion, up 106 percent from a year earlier. Record Data Center revenue of $2.05 billion, up 79 percent from a year earlier.\u00a0\n\n## Quarterly Earnings Surprise Amount\n\n**Fiscal Quarter End| Date Reported | Earnings Per Share\\*| Consensus EPS\\* Forecast | % Surprise**\n\n**Apr 2021.                    05/26/2021                  3.13                                     2.62**                                **19.47%**\n\n**Jan 2021                      02/24/2021                  2.58                                      2.2                                  17.27%**\n\n**Oct 2020                     11/18/2020                   2.41                                     1.92                                25.52%**\n\n**Jul 2020                       08/19/2020                  1.67                                     1.63                                 2.45%**\n\nAs you can see over the past four quarterly earnings NVDIA has beaten each of the projected forecasts easily for the most part. With a gross margin of 64.11% for this quarter, and an average quarterly gross margin of 60.96% over the past 5 years, NVDIA is primed to continue its dominance for the future. Also it is important to note that **NVDIA beats out its main competitors Intel and AMD in gross margins on average over the past 5 years and over the last quarter.**\u00a0\n\n## NVDIA Gross Profit Margin (Quarterly) Range, Past 5 Years\n\n**Minimum 54.74% Jan 2019**\n\n**Maximum 65.06% Apr 2020**\n\n**Average 60.96%**\n\n## AMD Gross Profit Margin (Quarterly) Range, Past 5 Years\n\n**Minimum 4.51% Sep 2016**\n\n**Maximum 46.07% Mar 2021**\n\n**Average 37.34%**\n\n## Intel Gross Profit Margin (Quarterly) Range, Past 5 Years\n\n**Minimum 53.13% Sep 2020**\n\n**Maximum 64.50% Sep 2018**\n\n**Average 59.65%**\n\nNow onto reasons why I think NVIDIA is a strong buy.\u00a0\n\n1. **Price targets**\n\nNVDIA is still undervalued with multiple price targets very much higher than the current price of what NVDIA is trading at currently along with multiple buy ratings. One example in specific, **Bank of America recently upgraded NVDIA price target to $900 from $800 and reiterated its Buy rating.** The bank said its takeaway is that \"rising AI adoption, expanding use-cases across cloud, enterprise, edge, telco can help NVDA double its content and triple its data center sales over the next few years.\" Bank of America said it expects NVIDIA's data center business to grow at a 35% compounded rate to become its largest segment by year-end 2025. Other notable price targets include 854- Jefferies, 800- Robert W Baird, 800- Rosenblatt Securities.\u00a0\n\n1. **Acquisition of ARM**\n\n\u00a0ARM can\u2019t stay independent for long, even the CEO thinks so. Arm CEO Simon Segars\u00a0made the case that if it stays independent, Arm wouldn\u2019t be able to keep up with the increasing demands of its customers for more complex chips that can perform a wider variety of functions. The simple solution? Getting acquired by another company. NVIDIA seems to be in the lead to acquire ARM and other rivals are terrified. They have a good reason to be, as NVDIA already a strong leader wants to spend $40 billion to acquire U.K. chip technology provider Arm Holdings. This acquisition will reshape the industry entirely. NVIDIA CEO, Jensen Huang said the acquisition of ARM is an opportunity to create a company that can generate even more new ideas, and bring more innovation to its customers in the form of intellectual property. A quote in specific, \u201cThe benefit to the market, and to the Arm customers will be more IP, better IP, more accelerated road maps and hopefully taking Arm to the far reaches of what is becoming \u2026the diversity of computing that is literally going in every single direction,\u201d Huang said. \u201cYou\u2019re covering everything from cloud, to edge, to \\[internet of things\\], to high performance computing, to microprocessors, to accelerated computing\u2014everything.\u201d\n\n2. **Internet currency ( Not allowed to say actual word so replaced it with internet)**\n\nGPU\u2019s can be used for internet currency and its mining purposes. It\u2019s possible to blame the graphic card shortage on these miners but nonetheless, the usage of them is highly prevalent today. NVIDIA's releases of processors specifically used for mining poses a huge boost to its revenue and to the internet currency world. **NVIDIA booked $155 million in revenue from CMP cards in its fiscal first quarter.** While internet money is gaining traction around the world, we can expect NVIDIA to continue its dominance and reliability in mining purposes.\u00a0\n\n3. **Stock split**\u00a0\n\nOn May 21st, NVIDIA announced a 4-1 stock split which would take place on July 19th. So for every one share you own, you will own four instead as the stock splits its price valuation by four. On the day of the news, NVIDIA\u2019s stock price closed at $599.67. **Since then, the price of NVIDIA\u2019s stock has gone up around 24% to $743.75**. Not even one month has passed and the stock is up 24%! With one full month until the split **I predict NVDIA to hit $800 or/and above by the time of the official split**. Call options and shares in my opinion are the way to go for the next month as this could be a great opportunity to invest in a fast growth company.\u00a0\n\n4. **Growth**\u00a0\n\nNVIDIA has been a great growth tech stock to own recently with the numbers backing this statement up.\u00a0\n\n**NVIDIA RETURNS**\u00a0\n\nYTD: +223.35 (+42.77%)\n\n1 Year: +376.83 (+102.20%)\n\n6 Months: +214.67 (+40.44%)\n\n1 Month: +184.92 (+32.98%)\n\nNow for the returns on NVIDIA compared to AMD and INTEL.\u00a0\n\n**NVIDIA RETURNS**\u00a0\n\nYTD: +223.35 (+42.77%)\n\n1 Year: +376.83 (+102.20%)\n\n6 Months: +214.67 (+40.44%)\n\n1 Month: +184.92 (+32.98%)\n\n**AMD RETURNS**\n\nYTD: -7.06 (-7.70%)\n\n1 Year: +30.61 (+56.64%)\n\n6 Months: -11.27 (-11.75%)\n\n1 Month: +10.21 (+13.72%)\n\n**INTEL RETURNS**\n\nYTD: +5.85\u00a0 (+11.74%)\n\n1 Year: -4.41 (-7.34%)\n\n6 Months: +8.21 (+17.30%)\u00a0\n\n1 Month: +0.83 (+1.51%)\n\n**NVIDIA beats Intel and AMD in every single category growth wise showing complete dominance with its stock price.**\u00a0\n\nConcluding I believe NVIDIA is a must buy presplit and the risk is minimum. The stock shows solid uptrend with extreme growth to come. NVIDIA is a strong buy in my personal opinion and an amazing company to be invested in.\u00a0",

        "selftext": "It was a generational changing of the guard this year for Ita\u00fa Unibanco. \n\nThe biggest financial services company in Brazil welcomed new CEO Milton Maluhy Filho. Just 44 years old, Maluhy took over from retiring Candido Bracher, and becomes the youngest bank boss in Brazil.\n\n\nDespite their tremendous market power, Brazil's giant banks did not move to take advantage of the rapid spread of broadband internet and smartphones across the continent in the early 2010s.\n\nThat is all about to change.  Ita\u00fa has now launched app adapted for the M1 chip.  Since the first Macs with an M1 chip hit the market, Ita\u00fa customers were basically unable to access their accounts from their computer using the app \u2014 having to use only the iOS app or, of course, the browser. **This week, the bank released a version of the App Ita\u00fa no Computer duly adapted for Apple.**  (For Macs, two independent versions of the app are available for download: one for Intel (compatible with macOS 10.12 Sierra or higher) and one for M1 (compatible only with macOS Big Sur 11).\n\nMOREOVER:  Ita\u00fa has partnered with fintech Rappi to provide greater access to financial services and products for retail and mass affluent clients in Chile. The agreement will allow customers to access the Brazilian bank and asset manager\u2019s investment strategies digitally through Rappi\u2019s phone app. \n\n\nMAINTAINING CONTROL OVER SMALL BUSINESS MARKET CAP: In Brazil, Ita\u00fa and Omie launch support platform for small and medium-sized businesses. The platform, called Ita\u00fa My Business, will feature several services for entrepreneurs, such as sales and service order management, financial management, automatic invoice issue, and integration with accountants.\n\nCHAD CEO:\n\nBrazil\u2019s Itau Unibanco Holding SA will be more active in making acquisitions and forming partnerships with smaller competitors this year, Chief Executive Milton Maluhy told journalists on Wednesday. The bank is eying deals with companies in sectors such as payments and investments, he added, which will complement the portfolio of Brazil\u2019s largest lender. Itau\u2019s chief financial officer, Alexsandro Broedel, said that despite fierce competition, the bank sees its net interest income growth accelerating by year-end, with trading gains reaching the upper part of the outlook range, close to 6.4 billion reais ($1.26 billion).\n\n\nWHO IS MILTON?  Milton Maluhy Filho became a director on January 1, 2019.  Previously, he was CEO of Rede S.A.

Losing Apple's 10% market share and seeing AMD staying firmly with another 10%, Intel's share in the notebook market is likely to slip below 80% in 2023, the sources noted.\n\nhttps://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/18/intel-market-share-falling-apple-silicon/",

        "selftext": " \n\n**Why Intel ($INTC) is undervalued**\n\nThis is my first ever stock analysis, any tips will be appreciated. \n\nDISCLOSURE: I do not own any shares of Intel at the time of writing. \n\nIntel is a chipmaker who has been beaten down by the ongoing global chip shortage. Intel is down from it\u2019s high and has a relatively low P/E value. I am currently bullish on Intel. AMD is currently expensive and overvalued at the moment. AMD has had no availability in the consumer market for quite some time. Intel is finally the more affordable option again (in terms of consumer parts) due to AMD having very limited availability. In terms of stock, Intel is currently down from it\u2019s high and has potential to go back up. \n\n**Finances**\n\nFirst things first, let\u2019s get into Intel\u2019s financials. Over the past few years, Intel has had steady revenue growth:\n\n2017: 62.76B\n\n2018: 70.85B\n\n2019: 71.97B\n\n2020: 77.87B\n\nIntel has also been steadily buying back outstanding shares, declining in numbers every year:\n\nIn 2018, Intel had 4.701B outstanding shares, a 2.77% decrease from 2017.\n\nIn 2019, Intel had 4.473B outstanding shares, a 4.85% decrease from 2018.\n\nIn 2020, Intel had 4.232B outstanding shares, a 5.39% decrease from 2019.\n\nIn March 2021, Intel had 4.096B outstanding shares, a 5.01% decrease from 2020.\n\n**Competition/Growth Potential**\n\nIntel has a P/E ratio of 12.80. This is low, compared to the average P/E ratio of 22.69 for the rest of the industry. Intel is also still down from it\u2019s stock price high of \\~$68 in April at \\~$57 right now. The global chip shortage has been the main cause of Intel being down, along with fierce competition from AMD. As chip production begins to pick back up, Intel\u2019s stock should begin to go up as well. AMD has been hurt greatly from this chip shortage as well, giving Intel a chance to possibly undercut AMD and lead to growth. \n\nIntel also plans to build more production plants so that they can keep up with the ever-increasing demand for chips. Intel is still ahead of AMD in market share as well. Intel\u2019s new 11th Gen processors are back on top in terms of speed, especially in laptops. A subsidiary of Intel has also landed a deal with Toyota ($TM) to produce radar technology for Toyota. \n\n**Final Thoughts**\n\nIntel seems to be using the chip shortage as a way to come back from their drought. They seem to have been benefiting from it greatly.\n\nIntel is not out yet. They still have the market share and resources to compete with AMD. Intel is undervalued and has the capability to bounce back strong from the chip shortage and also has a chance to finally come out on top as the primary choice in the chip market. \n\nWhat are everyone else\u2019s thoughts? I personally believe that Intel is due for a breakout in the next months, but what does everyone else think? I was also wondering about Qualcomm ($QCOM), what does everyone think about that?",

        "selftext": "Intel is currently trading in the mid 50's at a pe ratio of 12.5,  intel is a matured company and no one is looking for a multibagger here and recently it has lost ground to Amd in the consumer cpu market. Now semiconductor shortages has hit everyone hard and won't be reasonable to expect quick turnarounds.\n\nBut the thing is there are not many players in the market and there is no technological threat, the infrastructure and research requirements to even make a cpu, set the entry barrier pretty high but this has breed incompetence at intel  imo. \n\nNow Intel processors are still at least competitive unlike the past years when amd was beaten to the ground by intel. Now this could be the beginning of the downward road for intel if it can't compete with next few launches  but as of today it is simply lagging behind a bit.\n\nNow intel has had a shaddy / unethical reputation with regards to going to extreme ways to win market share, such as designing to perform on specific benchmarks, poaching competitive talent and anti competitive policies and perhaps is not the best place to work. Current management may also be dragging the stock's perceived value, when you look at Lisa su she has been a revelation at amd. \n\nTalking about the stock it also pays a decent dividend, but paying such amounts of dividend when the company has such a huge debt is questionable. Like why won't there be much better use of the money being paid? Also the interest will pile on like this makes no sense?\n\nI think a structural change at intel is the one thing which can revive the stock and the company else amd might do what intel once did to amd, kinda what goes around comes around. What's your take?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNote: Personally I would go no where close to an intel cpu to build a pc/ gaming laptop, perhaps this is the jist which the price reflects.",

        "selftext": "Quick DD.  A few days ago, rumors started popping up that Intel is looking into buying chipmaker SiFive.  SiFive is a designer of chips that are based on the RISC-V architecture, an attempt to bring open-source standards to semiconductor design making it cheaper and accessible to customers.  This would give Intel an opportunity to keep pace with Nvidia, which is in the process of acquiring Arm(could potentially be blocked by regulators).  SiFive is currently valued at 500 million, while Intel has 22.375 billion in cash on hand.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe reason this interests me is the options activity today, specifically the $62 strike expiring July 2.  As of last Friday, the open interest was sitting at 223.  Today, the volume at that strike and date was almost 59,694.  That's a huge increase in interest.  The 7/9 $62 strike had an open interest of 134 from Friday, and a volume of 1,750 today.  There is also a shitload volume and open interest(40,000 for 7/16 $62.50) for each strike from $50-75 strikes for July 16.  All in all, there are 263,557 call contracts open vs 26,969 puts.  IV is around 25% for most of these contracts as well. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1yskugpq0c571.png?width=1090&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3fa94df3038ee170e68929da7c361d4284f1c32c\n\nThe daily chart shows its been stuck in the $56-58 range since May 21, and just broke through that $58 resistance today.  There is also a big fucking gap from $59-62 that needs to be filled.  This looks extremely promising to me, and if it is confirmed that Intel is planning to acquire SiFive in the next few days or next week, I think we could see some significant upside very quickly, and if that happens, those calls expiring in 2-3 weeks will go in the money and this fucker will fly when market makers buy shares to hedge.   \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is not financial advice, do your own DD.",

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, June 3, 2021**\n\nStocks dipped today, with the three major indexes pulling back after a recent run of gains in the last two weeks. Seems like after the recent run of gains we are seeing some profit taking across the board. I see no real reason for the dip given that new economic data released today was overwhelmingly positive. Looking ahead, market participants are waiting for May\u2019s Job Report slated to be released tomorrow.\n\nAmid negotiations with Republican lawmakers regarding the proposed infrastructure bill, today, the Washington Post reported that President Biden was open to reconsidering his previous proposal to raise the corporate tax rate to from 21% to 28%. This proposed increase has been one of the main sticking points during negotiations. Now it is reported Biden would recommend a minimum corporate tax rate of 15%. \n\nWe got two pieces of good news in the labor market today. On one hand, according to a report by payroll processing firm ADP, the private sector added 978,000 jobs in May, well ahead of consensus estimates of 650,000. On the other hand, according to the Labor Department\u2019s Weekly Jobless claim report, showed 385,000 new jobless claims, roughly in-line with 387,000 estimate and a fresh pandemic low, a great sign that the labor market is improving as the economy continues to recover. \n\nThese reports set the stage for the official May Jobs Report set to be released tomorrow by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which will be critical in determining the pace of economic recovery and whether the Federal Reserve will consider tapering monetary support in the near future. The April Job Report was extremely disappointing, showing only 266,000 jobs added compared to the 1 million expected, and marking a sharp deceleration compared to March. \n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Extremely volatile trading continued in AMC, which saw it\u2019s stock price recover from roughly 30% down to more than 10% up and only to dip again towards the end of the day. Other \u201cmeme stocks\u201d traded in similar patterns after rocketing up in the last few days. \n* AMC issues and additional 11 million shares today, with the company taking advantage of its surging stock price. \n* Boeing Co Chief Executive Dave Calhoun on Thursday pointed to potential \"supply constraints\" beginning in the summer after a \"more robust\" recovery from the coronavirus-related downturn than he had imagined, another sign that demand is catching up in many industries faster than supply as the economy roars back from the coronavirus-induced recession.\n* Twitter (TWTR) on Thursday said it will roll out a new subscription product initially in Australia and Canada called Twitter Blue, which will let paying users edit their tweets before posting and change the color theme of their app. Twitter has recently been making big pushes trying to raise revenue\n* Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) is moving ahead with $12 billion plans to build a new semiconductor factory in Arizona. The US government has been aggressively pursuing semiconductor companies for investments, looking to secure its supply of semiconductors. Intel (INTC) also recently showed plans to also build new factories in Arizona. \n* Jack Ma's Ant Group has been approved to run a consumer finance company, the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission said Thursday. This is one of the first step of Ant's forced restructuring after China pulled the plug on its $35 billion IPO in October 2020. It also means the company will be regulated more like a traditional financial entity, giving authorities more oversight over company operations\n* **\\*\\*Please note that the current stock price was written premarket and does not reflect intraday changes.\\*\\***\n* Cigna[ ](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24CI&amp;src=cashtag_click)(CI)target raised by Morgan Stanley from $254 to $321 at Overweight.

        "selftext": "President Biden\u2019s $2.3 trillion infrastructure proposal includes $620 billion in transportation spending with $174 billion invested in the electric vehicle (EV) market. Biden\u2019s plan will enable automakers to spur domestic supply chains from raw materials to parts, retool factories and give consumers point-of-sale rebates and tax incentives to buy affordable American-made EVs. This will establish grant and incentive programs for state and local governments and the private sector to build a national network of 500,000 EV chargers by 2030.\n\nAutomakers such S Ford, General Motors and Nikola are competing with big tech companies like Amazon, Alphabet, Intel Corporation, and Nvidia Corporation to get in the EV game.\n\nAnd one company stands to gain from all of this... WKSP (Worksport Ltd). \n\nWorksport is a globally recognized designer and producer of truck bed covers. They are a disruptive innovator thanks to their mobile solar technology \u2014 the TerraVis.\n\nTheir technology provides solar power to over 50 million light trucks currently on the roads today and is a major source of clean energy to recharge upcoming EV trucks. The TerraVis can provide up to 30% or more of the power needed for the average daily commute.\u00a0\n\nThe TerraVis system is a first-of-its-kind mobile solar power generation system, generating up to 1kWh of mobile power off-grid. The TerraVis Cor battery system takes power from the cover and stores it in modular battery packs \u2014 storing 1.5 kWh of energy in up to 4 batteries that can be transported in the truck bed using the mounting system.\n\nThe TerraVis Cor can also act as a standalone consumer product \u2014 which makes it available for purchase even if you\u2019re not a truck owner. The system will allow the same level of freedom from a power grid, being chargeable via any wall outlet, solar panel or 12V power source.\n\nWorksport has the early mover advantage and is leveraging the TerraVis system and its position as a Tier 1 original equipment manufacturer to secure future partnerships and distribution of its conventional truck bed tonneau covers. They\u2019ve already secured a partnership with Nissan. \n\nThanks to their partnership with Ontario Tech University Worksport has access to the world-class ACE Testing facility, collaborating with the OTU research team. \n\nWorksport will complete validation and fine-tuning for TerraVis pre-launch in Q4 of this year, and accelerate toward full manufacturing in 2022 (if not sooner). \n\nTerraVis Cor has already entered the production prototype phase with the first pre-production prototype expected to be ready by early Q3 2021. The prototype system(s) will be fully operational and is expected to mirror the commercial model.\n\nFinally, in April the CEO announced that Worksport had filed for listing on the NASDAQ and will be issuing a common stock and warrant offering as part of that listing... which would make them available on the NASDAQ in 2021.\n\nWKSP is currently trading at $0.64/share over the counter; after a $0.20 increase in share price today.\n\nHappy investing!",

        "selftext": "Novice investor here, 22 years old, stable job with spare capital every month for investing. Been thinking about this strategy for about a year now and have tested it out with minor success, wanted feedback and the potential whys of how this could go wrong before I go heavily into it. This is also gonna be alot so I\u2019ll put a TLDR below.\n\nMain point of this strategy, a robinhood covered call wheel, is it is very low risk (focusing on mostly blue chips), with potentially very high returns, especially if you are willing to never sell at a loss. The only catch is that this strategy will work best in a slightly bullish market, not too bullish and not too bearish, or alternatively with only stocks that have a slightly bullish trend. \n\nIf you are not too familiar with how options and covered calls work you may have a hard time following and I apologize in advance but I will try my best.\n\nI will discuss the mathematics part momentarily and why the returns can be potentially very high (as high as 20-40% annually). \n\n*** Skim this next part if you are already familiar with selling covered calls ***\n\nThe basic premise is selling short term covered calls, for anyone who was in the same boat as I was and not too familiar with options, is I would buy 100 shares of a company I believe will have a slightly bullish trend for at least the next few weeks or months, and then the same day I buy those 100 shares, sell an option for someone to buy those shares at let\u2019s say 5% above what I paid for it, they receive the option to buy my shares if it hits that strike price at lets say 2 weeks from now, I immediately receive the premium. \n\nNot ideal case #1: So I just sold the covered call for 2 weeks from now, the only way I can lose money now is if the stock price drops in the next 2 weeks more then amount of money I made from getting the premium. Even so, I keep the 100 shares, and when that option expires I sell another covered call, always above what I paid for. In that case, I keep raking in premiums (though they will diminish if the stock continues to fall in price) and I keep the shares. I will never sell at a loss, and I just repeat the process.\n\nNot ideal case #2: I sell the covered call 2 weeks from now, the stock soars above the call\u2019s strike price I set. I have to sell those 100 shares, but I\u2019m still selling above what I paid for, and I still keep the premium. I lost out on potential gains by having to sell, but I secured gains and I can move onto a different stock now, or wait for that stock to drop to a price im comfortable buying back in at and repeat.\n\nIdeal case: I sell the covered call for 2 weeks from now, the stock stays the same price throughout those 2 weeks or jumps sightly up in value, but doesn\u2019t hit the strike price. Perfect, I now keep the premium, keep the 100 shares, and after researching the stock and making my prediction for what it will be at, sell another covered call 2 weeks from now. I repeat this for as long as possible until one of the two cases above happens.\n\nSo there is the main premise for my strategy. The variables are the following:\n- Finding the ideal slightly-bullish stock\n- Finding the right strike price to sell the covered call\n- Finding stocks that aren\u2019t too volatile but have high valued option prices\n- Acquiring the capital needed to make the biggest returns (I will explain this below)\n\nBefore I am judged for using Robinhood, consider the Robinhood Gold margin rate. 2.5% annually. That is the most competitive margin rate on the market, compared to Fidelity\u2019s 7%, Schwabs starting 8%, and most other financial institutions around the same rate. \n\nThis is why I pick Robinhood, despite it\u2019s controversies. I can effectively double my money for only 2.5% interest, and because this is such a low risk strategy because it is primarily using bluechips, there is very little risk of losing money and owning a debt to Robinhood. \n\nNow, time for the good part, the math, and why I like this strategy so much. I like to use excel to pick various blue chips and see how much I can potentially make and how much capital is required to do so.\n\nFor this example I will use the bluechip IT company Intel (INTC). \n\n*** EXAMPLE ***\nINTC is as of now currently trading at 55.67 a share, for simplicity I will round it up to 56. After doing my research, I feel like this stock fits my strategy well, so I want to buy 100 shares of it to start the wheel process. It will cost $5,600, but by using margin I only put in $2,800. I now analyze their options that expire a week from now. I pick the $58 strike price option which is going for about $.30 a share. I sell the option, collect the premium (100 x $.30 = $30.) And now I wait. 1 week later, Intel price remained about the same. I keep the $30 and I sell another call for next week, and rinse and repeat. I just made $120 safely in a month, from an initial investment of $2800. That is a 4% return in a month. Do that for a year and you can see why earlier I made those return predictions of 20-40%. \n\nAnyways, that pretty much wraps up my strategy. The past few months I have made a safe few hundred already on blue chips just from an initial investment of about $5000. \n\nI would love to hear any other investors thoughts, expertise, criticisms, or feedback on this.\n\nTLDR; using Robinhood\u2019s 2.5% margin to sell blue chip covered calls for relatively high profit and low risk returns in a slightly bullish market.",

It is considered a solid play due to its consistent and predictable geology and recoveries relative to drilling and completion costs. Long story short, it is not a risky play in terms of exploration coming up unsuccessful, which is a plague in the industry, and on a energy company's books.\n\n**Marcellus Shale**\n\n[Map from USGS.Gov ](https://preview.redd.it/3t7p5l7rvw471.jpg?width=400&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=33338104ed93cad1c534b25d3c246bef9b1eab0a)\n\n**As of year-end 2020, AR had the following assets in the Marcellus Shale:**\n\n\\-515,000 net acres located primarily in northern West Virginia, which is strategically located bordering near Ohio and PA.\n\n\\-Operation of 1000 producing horizontal wells\n\n\\-17.6 Tcfe (trillion cubic feet of natural gas equivalent) of net proved reserves.\n\n\\-1,877 undeveloped core drilling locations.\n\n**UTICA SHALE**\n\n[Map from USGS.gov](https://preview.redd.it/prvb7y0zvw471.jpg?width=497&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=db938aaa349215dcde90aada176653f08cec5724)\n\nNow on to the Utica Shale, which is located a few thousand feet below the Marcellus Shale. Think of the Utica Shale as that girl in High School that you knew was going to be a smoke show but she hung out with the Drama Club and was a lil too quick witted for you at the time. Yes, we all know that this was mostly due to the amount of bong hits you did in your buddy's Honda Accord when out for lunch. I digress. Back to the Utica Shale and the great state of Ohio, where Antero has 91,000 net acres, 200 horizontal wells currently producing, 2.0 tcfe (here I'll write it again but remember it this time, trillion cubic feet of natural gas equivalent), and 494 *undeveloped* drilling locations. I italicized undeveloped because AR knows how big of a play Utica will be down the road. Also, touching on the critical importance of location, location. location, AR's acreage is located bordering West Virginia and PA. To emphasize the importance of their foothold, here are links showing AR's locations in reference to a map of heat spots for natural resources.\n\n[Antero Resources Corp.

This executive order would require major suppliers to disclose their greenhouse gas emissions and related risks. With this being put into play and the goal of net-zero emissions goal by 2050, as well as cutting greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, Antero is in a very good position.\n\nIt is my belief that with AR planning on being net-zero by 2025, and being positioned geographically where they are in the U.S. they will somehow benefit from the Infrastructure Plan if/when it goes through. According to Forbes, prior to the pandemic, the economic boom that kicked off in SE Ohio at the Utica Shale around 2011 resulted in $86B in new capital investments and created over 200,000 new jobs for Ohio citizens by the end of 2019. Unemployment rates that had stood as high as 15.5% in 2009 dropped into the 5-6% range ten years later. It seems to me that the NG Industry, if done correctly in terms of the environment, could be a major benefactor from an administration looking to create a ton of jobs.\n\n**TLDR**\n\n[5 Year Chart](https://preview.redd.it/6zca80bixw471.png?width=1692&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=48b46d66afc5871acd596af68dbaa9be016a7c6b)\n\n\\-AR is reducing debt on the balance sheet\n\n\\-A current leader in the industry in terms of Environmental, Social &amp; Governance \n\n\\-Notorious for keeping expectations low and over-performing also known by another term, described by John Beckwith in  [Wedding Crashers](https://getyarn.io/yarn-clip/f45a8bb4-c30d-4a9b-97e7-223cab02bc4d)\n\n**Positions:**\n\nLong Shares &amp; January 21, 2022 $20c @ $1.20\n\n*Not Financial Advise as I am on beer number 5.*",

        "selftext": "Everyone loves money and the casino is shutting off some games.\n\n**Key words to understand:**\n\n**Inflation-** Things cost more, the purchasing power of the dollar is less. You probably already notice that  materials have cost more. Inflation as mentioned by the FEDs is temporary and here to stay, for now. Think materials like stock, people hoard, lack of supply, lumber hits $1000 per 1000 ft. The overestimated inflation is now coming back to to find a midpoint. Because inflation is here we need to take a look at the return on investments.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;!Inflation short term, it's already here! Commodities are dumping from being over inflated. !&lt;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Interest Hike** \\- Everyone is talking about whether or not JPOW is going to raise interest rates to counter inflation. By raising rates you would make people spend less because you get more of a return from savings than spending. If people spend less, then demand goes and deflation will occur.\n\n&gt;!Interest rate hikes adjust from 2024 to 2023. More inflation?! Possibly, but the 5 year yields are going up and the 30 year yields are going down. More return on investments for 5 year vs 30 year. What does this mean?! Borrowing short term money will cost you more than borrowing long term money. The 5 year and 30 year. Growth is slowing so you get punished for not growing.!&lt;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Reverse Repo-** June just provided the highest reverse repo of all time. Reverse repo is the buying of securities or equities and and promising to only sell them at a higher price. Think stocks now. Where will money go if you are guaranteeing you'll only sell at a higher price.\n\n&gt;!Repos and reverse repos are short term borrowed money. With such high reverse repos, better make sure you beat that increased short term rate.!&lt;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TOUR OF CASINO**\n\nYou walk into the casino, the thermostat is set at a mild temperature. Maybe a little too warm. The lights turn on. There is suddenly a halt and an announcement that there are table staff changes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLet's take a tour of the casino and look at the systems in the casino and see where we are positioned.\n\n**Slots** (&gt;!Dividend Stocks!&lt;): People tend to like dividend stocks because the companies pay you for holding the shares. Dividends generally pay 2-4%. The issue here is that in an economic slow down, companies may see a reduced revenue and the dividend payout might not beat the interest rates. If you get 2% in a savings account, why risk the biscuit for the dividend?\n\n**Roulette** (&gt;!Defense Pharma &amp; Research Heavy Stocks!&lt;): To save money during inflation, there are generally budget cuts to stop spending. This affects the defense sector in many ways. Future grants are generally pulled and R&amp;D is usually cut.\n\n**Craps** (&gt;!ETFs, recovery, inelastic holdings!&lt;): Now sure what to hold, want to be safe, let someone else do it for you. ETFs generally hold some form of dividend stock or businesses that stay flat for stable growth. At times like this where there are still better investments on the table like hiked treasuries, foreign investments, and growth stonks. Who likes watching money burn?\n\n**Blackjack (**&gt;!Meme stocks, trenders!&lt;**):** Memes don't last forever, but we will forever remember the meme. The come and go, that's just the way it is. Big money, small money, no money, doesn't ever want to bag hold. Just here to win it and make a killing. With money moving away from the stock market going out, volume will be a lot less. It's one on one with the dealer. How many hands do you want to play?\n\n**Poker (**&gt;!Growth Stocks!&lt;**):**  So you're telling me growth stocks don't need to spend much on R&amp;D?! YES! Let's narrow down the list that has shown exceptional growth. Got dealt two aces, might as well push everyone else out. Ace 1( Growing Revenue YoY), Ace 2 (Growing footprint YoY)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhich game do you want to play? Seems like the casino is shutting down some of it's services and the others don't have many players.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**I can't bluff well:**\n\nYou start playing **slots** and accumulate into year 2030. &gt;!You're finally at your breakeven point, the bullmarket starts. Oh the joy of saving and making null.!&lt;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Roulette** baby, here we go! Yolo is the only way of life, either get rich or die trying. &gt;!You died!&lt;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThrow ten darts and land three, win some lose some. It's only money. **Craps**, time to roll the dice. You start winning, then you start losing. Then you win some more. &gt;!Radioshack bled out by accident. Fuck my life.!&lt;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBlackjack. Man, I don't really want to play alone, let's find a crowd.&gt;! You find a good seat with a lot of players. The table suddenly goes out of service. You panic and rush to the nearest one and go all in. You died.!&lt;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAh.... you chose (**Poker)**\n\nNot a bad choice. Fun game.\n\nLet's look at what growth stocks there are that are generating great income and expanding the foot print.\n\nThere's large caps like: &gt;!SQ, FB, NFLX, AAPL, MSFT, AMZN!&lt;\n\nThere's small and mid caps like: &gt;!FVRR, ETSY, PINS!&lt;\n\nThere's proven foreign growth investments like: &gt;!BABA, JD, TSM!&lt;\n\nThere's semis who can't meet current demand: &gt;!AMD, NVDA!&lt;, &gt;!oops \\~\\~INTC drank one too many drinks \\~\\~!&lt;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n14 choices!? So many to choose from! Takes step back. (**over 9000 tickers**)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**I'll buy the dip, no worries**....  &gt;!who says there will have to be a dip for growth stocks?!&lt;",

        "selftext": "The global semi-conductor shortage, aka chip shortage, has been crippling many industries. Demand for chips is continuing to outstrip supply and the car industry is longer the only one feeling the pain. Many auto-makers are actually limiting the amount of cars produced in 2021, including Ford recently who announced they will be canceling weeks worth of production of the F-150.\n\n**Overview**\n\nThere are a few factors at play giving analysts the impression that this shortage may last until early 2022. There\u2019s a few KEY points that come to mind:\n\n* Most chips are produced overseas: Covid-related delays in shipping ports have effected supply coming into the United States.\n* China has been stock-piling chips: Chinese businesses have bought an absurd amount of chip-producing equipment (roughly $32 billion) in an effort to protect themselves from further US sanctions.\n* Demand for electronic products have soared.\n* Often over-looked, consumers don\u2019t realize the amount of chips it takes to build cars in 2021. The trend is continuing in the same direction as many analysts expect the automative industry to begin predominantly developing cars with network connectivity.\n\nThis leaves an opportunity for those willing to look past the hardship some of these companies are experiencing of being unable to meet demand. The semi-conductor industry is expected to grow at CAGR of roughly \\~9% over the next 7-8 years. I see this as a relatively conservative number and it is my opinion that we are heading into a super-cycle of chip upgrades, processing power, and memory devices. Here are a few reasons:\n\n1. We are already seeing noticeable shift in demand and the way consumers are interacting in a new digital world.\n2. These electronics are becoming faster and more powerful, which simply requires a larger quantity &amp; quality of chips.\n3. More and more devices rely on connectivity and the car industry is now making it\u2019s way onto a similar path.\n4. Following Nvidia\u2019s earnings call we are seeing a large rise in trends for AI and machine-learning which is leading to increased demand for the required components.\n5. The rise of crypto mining will also play a role in the increased demand.\n\n**The Players**\n\nMany of the chip-related plays have already seen convincing growth over the last 12 months. However, several names have recently followed the markets to the downside and currently pose a potential good entry point. This secular trend in semi-conductor demand over the next several years is here to stay.\n\nMy semis watchlist is holding some familiar names: Applied Materials (AMAT), ASML Holdings (ASML), Skyworks Solutions (SWKS), Nvidia (NVDA), Intel (INTC), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Qualcomm (QCOM), and Taiwan Semiconductors (TSM).\n\nThe ones that make my shortlist are the following: NVDA, AMD, TSM, and AMAT. Here\u2019s a look at the 2-year chart for the 4 tickers mentioned above.\u00a0\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xr0kge6rq2371.png?width=2380&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c4beece1276b8c383ed5a2c0cca07bf40f42da11\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt is clear the secular trend in computer chips and processors have contributed greatly to the growth of these companies. Let\u2019s take a look at a shorter time-frame. Here\u2019s the 3-month chart for the same list of tickers.\u00a0\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pip83wxqq2371.png?width=2388&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b353b714f1958233646a57ee5680bf2385ee2a3d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLooking at it from another angle we see AMD and TSM have been lagging behind the performance of AMAT and NVDA, who are on a nearly identical path. TSM is a leading manufacturer of chips and actually supplies most of AMD\u2019s chips. They are based in Taiwan and there have been some concerns over the potential invasion of China. Setting those concerns aside these companies may still experience strong growth. My plays right now are in AMD and TSM and I will feel comfortable adding to any of the names I mentioned in this article if the right entry point shows itself.\n\n**Final Thoughts**\n\nI would love to say here\u2019s why \u201cx\u201d company is in a better financial position than company \u201cy\u201d, but in this case I believe the high demand for semiconductors will benefit most names participating in this industry. Of course, not every company is made equal so please do your own research before investing in any stocks. In my opinion, this industry is in an upward secular trend and demand remains in-tact, providing tailwinds to the participants.\n\nKeep an eye on earnings reports and financial data of companies that BUY these products. Look at phone, tablet, computer manufacturers (Apple), cloud server providers, Google server expansion (also server chip REPLACEMENT rates, which is a thing), and AI/Machine learning projects (autonomous driving, video analysis, big-data processors). It may be years before the growth slows in this industry and these players will stand to largely benefit.",

This would be earlier than announced by the Federal Open Market Committee this week. The committee's consensus outlook was for up to two hikes in 2023.\n\n\"We're expecting a good year, a good reopening. But this is a bigger year than we were expecting, more inflation than we were expecting,\"\u00a0Bullard told CNBC. \"I think it's natural that we've tilted a little bit more hawkish here to contain inflationary pressures.\"\n\nNasdaq, S&amp;P 500 Fall\n\nThe Nasdaq was faring better than the other major indexes, but still fell around 0.6%.

        "selftext": " To understand the history\u00a0of MP Materials (Mountain Pass), you need to study its past history. Most casual observers never quite made the correlation, but if you live in Southern California and have driven to Las Vegas you\u2019ve driven over Mountain Pass. It's the last mountain range in the Mojave\u00a0Desert that you drive over on highway\u00a015 just before you reach the state line of Nevada. Mountain Pass is the current only rare earth mining and processing site in the western hemisphere.\u00a0\n\n**About rare earth metals** \n\nWhat are rare earth metals?\u00a0They are a group of 17 elements: lanthanum, cerium, praseodymium, neodymium, promethium, samarium, europium, gadolinium, terbium, dysprosium, holmium, erbium, thulium, ytterbium, lutetium, scandium, yttrium all found in rare deposits. The thing about these \u201crare\u201d metals is that they are actually quite common in the earth\u2019s crust. However, the difficulties in the extraction process of these metals is what gives them their name. These metals are used in just about anything electronic, rechargeable batteries, magnets, computers, lasers, fiber optics, superconductors and vehicles. Not only are they used in electric vehicles in batteries and motors, but they are also used in catalytic converters. Over the last 5-6 years prices of rare earth metals have risen because they are \u201crare\u201d, but they are also very costly to refine in environmentally\u00a0friendly ways. This has also spurred the growth of catalytic\u00a0converter theft which has become a growing nuisance.\u00a0Recyclers have been paying up to $250 per unit to almost anyone that's\u00a0willing to supply them. Nearly 60% of rare earths metals that were imported in 2018 were [used for catalytic converters](https://geology.com/articles/rare-earth-elements/).\u00a0\n\nThe majority of the global \u201crare metal\u201d supply is owned by China, thus they control most of the supply chain. Due to China\u2019s dominance in this sector the United States, along with the rest of the world, is very susceptible to China\u2019s pricing or supply disruption (tariffs/export ban/pricing pressure). According to this [Reuters article](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trade-china-rareearth-explainer/explainer-u-s-dependence-on-chinas-rare-earth-trade-war-vulnerability-idUSKCN1T42RP), \u201cThe United States imported $160 million of rare earth compounds and metals in 2018, up nearly 17% from 2017. Around 60% of it was used in catalysts for oil refining and in vehicle engines.\u201d\n\n**The SP@C merger**\n\nOn November 17, of 2020 Fortress\u00a0Value Acquisition\u00a0Corp (FVAC) closed a SP@C\u00a0merger deal with [$345 Million in cash in trust and a $200 Million](https://investorintel.com/markets/technology-metals/technology-metals-intel/us-rare-earths-industry-comeback-begun-mp-materials-announces-nyse-listing-via-merger-fvac/?print=print) PIPE led by the SP@C King himself Chamath Palihapitiya. The combined company was set at a valuation of $1.5 Billion with over $500 million in cash to fund the growth strategy and was labeled\u00a0MP Materials.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Government\u2019s acceptance of clean energy and strengthening supply chains**\n\nOver the term of the Trump presidency the trade war with China had intensified leaving companies with tariffs\u00a0and questionable supply chains. This economic\u00a0race had set the stage for MP Materials. With tariffs on imports and unfavorable pricing from China on rare earth materials it leaves a very volatile question mark for US manufacturers and other related companies. Flash forward to 2021 with the Biden administration, not only is the government trying to turn the table on [strengthening its own supply chains](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/02/24/fact-sheet-securing-americas-critical-supply-chains/), it's also trying to eliminate\u00a0its vulnerabilities. The pandemic has shown us the necessities of medicine, essential goods and things like semiconductors\u00a0should be made in the United States and this was reinforced by the executive order signed by President Biden in February. \n\nOn the list of critical goods to be evaluated within the first 100 days was specifically rare earth metals. This clearly demonstrates how MP Materials being the only miner and refiner of these materials in the United States could profit. The other larger mention on the executive\u00a0order was large capacity batteries such as those used in electric cars. I would highly recommend reviewing the order as there are so many industries that were mentioned that all use rare earth metals related to MP Materials.\n\nA long term investor may see the importance of rare earth metals in terms of being a critical factor to the US economy. After the 100 day review is completed somewhere around the beginning of June there is no doubt MP Materials will be listed as a critical\u00a0company and will have an overwhelming support of the US Government. Not only will this secure MP Materials as a local monopoly, but it will solidify local business supply chains for years to come. Also, with a critical infrastructure bill in the works the company could be on the list to receive subsidies to level the playing field with China. MP Materials\u2019 rare earth concentrate product represents [15% of the world\u2019s supply](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200715005276/en/MP-Materials-Leading-Producer-Rare-Earth-Materials).\u00a0\n\n**Expected increase in demand of rare metals**\n\nWith the rise of electric vehicles starting to enter the manufacturing plants of US automakers the demand of rare earth metals will be growing *exponentially*. If you take a moment to look at the slide deck of the investor presentation from MP Materials, the business is currently in early days of stage 2. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMP Materials is mining NdPr materials (mainly Neodymium and Praseodymium), which power the **strongest types of rare earth magnets**. These magnets are used to power EVs (electric vehicles) and many industrial processes. This is why the mining of these rare earth metals play a vital role in the EV market. After mining these materials, MP Materials then **ships them to China** (they rely on plants in China to actually process the mined materials) while incurring a VAT tax and tariffs to be refined and is still turning a profit. MP Materials is set to open the largest NdPr separation facility in the world in 2022 and are putting stage II into motion. NdPr is an essential piece used in magnets especially in EV motors. Stage III shows they are looking to actually produce NdPr magnets onsite sometime past 2025 which would make them even more vertically\u00a0integrated.\n\nDemand from electric vehicles, wind turbines, and other technologies is hitting an inflection point. The shift in clean energy and electrification of transport, globally, will be an important theme *over the next decade*. The demand for rare earths will rapidly outpace the current levels of production and supply. Take a look at the forecasted price of NdPr over the next several years.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFrom the MP Materials investor presentations, we\u2019ve pulled some of the charts where they forecast demand for electric vehicle magnets due to the high demand of EV sales compared to regular vehicle.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt is clear that this is not just a \u201crare earth metal\u201d play, but they will be particularly focused on NdPr which will be driven by clean energy industries, and more specifically electric vehicles.\n\n**Potential Risks**\n\nA company that entails rare earth mining, such as MP Materials, will be subject to typical risks that surround commodities. Right now we are in a \u201csuper-cycle\u201d, but how long will that last? Since China also supplies up to 80% of the world\u2019s rare earth materials there is also the potential of risks associated with the pricing pressure. Lastly, there are some advancements in synthetically creating materials that replace these rare metals, but not enough conclusions have been drawn in the validity of this topic.\n\n**Valuation**\n\nNow like any SP@C it's hard to give accurate projections more than 3 years out, but the rare earth metal market has had prices nearly double this year which has led to a pretty sharp increase in the stock price already. Not to mention, unlike some SP@Cs this is a company that is already generating products and profits. The most recent analyst coverage has near term price targets between $37 and $57. In the last 3 weeks there has been a rise in the 10 Year yield and that has made the technology sector and SP@Cs become unfavorable. Like several other stocks, it appears MP Materials is the baby being thrown out with the bathwater, the stock has retraced from its $51.77 52-week high significantly. Now the company did report an\u00a0excellent 4th quarter surpassing expectations on March\u00a018th. More recently the company announced it wanted to raise 600 million in a senior debt offering that would not come due until 2026. There was some concern that this could dilute the stock when it comes due, but this is over 5 years from now. This free cash will allow MP Materials to speed up its timeline and reduce costs by operating its own NdPr separation facility. With the speculation of a commodity\u00a0super cycle and rising inflation coming the\u00a0price of rare earth metals will continue to strengthen. This appears to be a potentially great value investment, and the upcoming 100 day review in June from the Biden administration will only further strengthen the importance of MP Materials in the US Economy.\n\nHaving said that, the company\u2019s original valuation in the merger was set to 1 billion dollars (1.5 billion minus 500 million to fund expansions). At the moment of writing, the company\u2019s market cap is sitting at roughly 6 billion. We want to determine if the current valuation is pricing the company at fair value, given the potential the company has. This is not an easy task given the complexities of the rare earth metal industry and also the lack of \u201ccompetitors\u201d. This is not a \u201cgrowth stock\u201d, nor is it strictly a commodity play. In my opinion we can look at it as a play on Neodymium and Praseodymium (NdPr) which is where the pricing outlook and largest growth expected over the next 10 years is very strong. It is my opinion that MP Material\u2019s growth will be somewhat reflected by the demand of the EV market as well as the progression of other clean energy industries where the use of these metals is critical. If the EV market were to increase tenfold, I think MP Materials would also benefit greatly by proxy.\n\n**Final Thoughts**\n\n1. China currently has somewhat of a monopoly on rare earth materials, currently providing about 80% of the world\u2019s supply. This allows them the capability to create pricing pressure (which they have done in the past) and control the supply to hurt their competitors.\n2. At this moment in time, MP Materials is currently mining the materials, then sending them off to China for processing all while still maintaining a profit. MP Materials will eventually be processing these rare earth materials in their own processing plants. The company is working on vertical integration for the entire process from start to finish.\n3. The most significant of these metals is NdPr, which power some of the strongest magnets used specifically in the electric vehicles and wind turbines (clean energy).\n4. MP Materials stock price is already trading at a hefty valuation relative to what the stock price was post-merger. However, this company\u2019s revenues will also be reflected by the strong demand (and trend) driven by the increase in EV sales.\n5. Considering these metals will play a vital role in many tech industries moving forward, they may receive substantial support from the government. The Biden administration has already put in motion a plan to strengthen it\u2019s own supply chains to remove vulnerabilities. Rare earth metals are specifically on this list.\n\nPositions: Long MP in common stock",

        "selftext": "What am I missing here about the semiconductor stocks?\nSo Intel had a recent earnings call where they said manufacturing will not be able to meet demand for at least another two years which dropped the prices instantly but you would think they would go up because of price increases. Also they announced they will be buying back a large number of stocks so they dropped the stock price in order to buy them back at a cheaper price and nobody is talking about it. These stocks are undervalued in my opinion (Intel, Nvidia, AMD) because the United States Taxpayers are also going to invest heavily in them in the next 5 years. The main points I find is the substrates they need to manufacture the chips are hard to get now but they should just be passing that price down so idk what's keeping the stocks down and I cannot find any discussion on this.",

        "selftext": "Everyone has probably heard about ENZC. \n\nIf you haven't it's a biotech company that just really started in its **current state** just over 6 months ago. It's essentially a merger between two companies Immunotech &amp; Bioclonetics which the details are beyond the scope of this post but you can read about in their filings on the OTCMarkets website.\n\nThere was a MASSIVE run to its ATH (All time high) earlier this year (along with most of the market) which also resulted in a correction and created a bunch of bag holders and brought out a lot of bears/shorts spewing a lot of nonsense (*in a lot of tickers and not just ENZC*).\n\nFairly recently **Intel** (*The company that make the processors and stuff*) **co-authored** a white paper with Enzolytics and you can easily find it on their website.\n\nThere is also a video available on YouTube hosted by James Hicks (Sr. Partner Solutions Engineer @ Dell) which is Part I of a series that features Gaurav Chandra (*COO/VP of AI &amp; R&amp;D for Enzolytics*) Clifton Roberts (*Global Director of Governments, Market &amp; Trade / Global Business Acceleration @ Intel*), &amp; Nikhil Deshpande PhD (*Director of Security / High Performance Computing &amp; Graph Analytics*). They talk about the white paper, the AI, and the science behind Enzolytics as well as hinting at the future potential.\n\nThe stock has been trading sideways for quite some time after hitting bottom a few weeks ago and has for the past week shown a trend reversal on the daily chart. In fact we have 6 days of steady upward trend with a ton of catalysts coming up and that can arrive literally any day. \n\nTwitter &amp; StockTwits have recently been going absolutely nuts the past several days and as far as I can tell, **there are a lot of new eyes on this thing**. \n\nAlso, there are several catalysts all the way through the end of the year including animal trials, and milestone related partnerships.\n\nI don't want to overwhelm anyone so I'll leave it at that, but there is far more going on if you care to research further.\n\nCheers!",

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, June 4, 2021**\n\nStocks rose today as investors digested the May Job Report, which showed non-farm payrolls rise by less than expected for the second straight month. Market participants seem to be interpreting the back-to-back miss in job gains for two consecutive months as meaning the Federal Reserve will keep the current accommodative monetary policy in place until the labor market shows robust signs of improvement.\n\nThe Labor Department\u2019s May Job Report showed the economy gained 559,000 non-farm payrolls, a substantial increase compared to April but still below estimates of 650,000. For months, the Federal Reserve has consistently reiterated it wants to see a \u201cstring\u201d of strong labor reports, like the one in March, before policy adjustments are seriously considered. This is why technology and growth stocks, which would be affected the most by potential adjustments in policy, outperformed today. Former Chase Chief Economist Anthony Chan said, \u201cWhat I see here is somewhat of a \u2018goldilocks\u2019 overall economy. I see that employment is increasing. With regard to the reason why the market is excited, it's because it's telling us that the economy is not blistering hot, that it's actually going to be opening up pretty gradually. I think that's important.\" \n\nRecent economic data has been good overall. A stronger-than-expected ADP private payrolls report and weekly jobless claims report released Thursday each underscored firming rehiring trends across the economy, with a smaller share of individuals becoming newly unemployed for pandemic-related reasons. Another wave of vaccinations has taken place, reopenings have picked up, and businesses have been scrambling to bring back workers to keep pace with surging demand. \n\nFederal Reserve Bank of New York President John Williams said that the economy was \"still quite a ways off from maintaining the substantial further progress we\u2019re really looking for in terms of adjustments to our asset purchase program.\"\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Marqeta Inc. (MQ), plans on IPOing soon at a valuation of $12 billion offers card-issuing technology that lets businesses build out these functions. The company\u2019s largest client is Square (SQ), which accounted for roughly 70% of revenue last year.\n* Square (SQ) is considering making a hardware wallet for bitcoin, CEO Jack Dorsey, said in a tweet. (Jack Dorsey is also the CEO and co-founder of Twitter)\n* GE CEO Larry Culp says the deal to combine its jet-leasing unit and GE Capital Aviation Services with rival AerCap (AER) remains on track to close later this year or early next year. \n* Twitter (TWTR) on Thursday said it will roll out a new subscription product initially in Australia and Canada called Twitter Blue, which will let paying users edit their tweets before posting and change the color theme of their app. Twitter has recently been making big pushes trying to raise revenue\n* Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) is moving ahead with $12 billion plans to build a new semiconductor factory in Arizona. The US government has been aggressively pursuing semiconductor companies for investments, looking to secure its supply of semiconductors. Intel (INTC) also recently showed plans to also build new factories in Arizona. \n* Sorry, no price target upgrades today",

        "selftext": "**tl;dr:** LRCX will benefit tremendously from the US push to produce semiconductors. Buy shares and LEAPS. \n\n**Position:** 103x LRCX shares with DRIP (dividend reinvestment) and 1x 1/2023 $500c.\n\n**The DD:** \n\n* The push within the US to produce semiconductors (microchips) inside American borders has encouraged companies like INTC, TSMC, and Samsung to commit to building multi-million dollar fab plants (semiconductor factories). \n* The semiconductor shortage in general indicates there is demand for more semis.\n* The 5G and IoT rollouts means semiconductor demand will remain high and manufactories are likely to expand further.\n\nLRCX is well-positioned to make money off this. LRCX builds the machines and does the research that these other companies need to make microchips. Without LRCX, there are no manufactories. And after the fab plants are built, the machines need maintenance. LRCX provides this maintenance at 30%+ margins.\n\n**Fundamentals:**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Beats Earnings](https://preview.redd.it/t67m821yap471.png?width=407&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=37ee8d9b94a3a0f5bfcb12d1fb6317bb5747c0fa)\n\nLRCX has beat earnings 4/4 of the last quarters. It has the growth potential to continue beating earnings.\n\nAt a 27 P/E ratio, its valuation is average in its industry and has room to climb.\n\n**Technicals:** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Up and to the right](https://preview.redd.it/xwr8epatap471.png?width=559&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cc38dae385b63dcd764d4509061508a2cf9206ed)\n\nLRCX goes up and to the right. It has the fundamental backing to continue. Demand for shares increases as the stock gets down to $600.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[RSI, MACD, Moving Averages](https://preview.redd.it/85xb9jk9bp471.png?width=898&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e471b714290c3175f09ac20a21b391f4e2ea7b88)\n\nMACD looks like shit, but RSI is positive and LRCX travels along its 50-DMA pretty well. Look to start DCAing into shares around this level and buy more shares or LEAPS as we approach $600.\n\n**Competition:**\n\nAMAT competes with LRCX in most industry segments. However LRCX stands out as the best wafer developer. If you cannot afford LRCX at $600, AMAT is $136. AMAT is also more diversified and is a good alternative choice.\n\nThere are some others including a Dutch company, but AMAT and LRCX are the main competitors in this industry, and they both have a wide moat.",

        "selftext": "Why I think BB is legit\n\nHonest View on BB\n\nApe Research Analyst Report on BB: To the Moon\n\nWhat's up apes, I know the last couple weeks have been life-changing for some of us. As a grad student who grew up on the lower end of the middle class, I recognize how pumped some fo you must feel and commend everyone's brass balls- it's never easy to make money in a casino as heavily manipulated as the free market that is the USA. But turning to BB: it was never meant to be just some squeeze (although its end result could technically be called that if you really wanted too)- it's a retooling company embedded in a crucial sector to the modern global economy.\n\nAnd so while some of us have become capable of retirement in recent weeks, I want to talk about a name that is on the cusp of a resurrection.\n\n# For BB Holders, it's been tough lately.\n\nMany people have harsh memories of Blackberry: it was on the cusp of bankruptcy as recently as 2015. Revenue growth sunk from $20B at its peak in 2011 (82% hardware sales) to under a $1B in the 2010s; $BB stock sunk from a peak of $146 in 2008 to single digits, thanks to negative cash flows and rapidly declining top line growth.\n\n[Not surprising BB ate shit for so long- this useless Etch-a-Sketch was 82&amp;#37; of their revenue in 2011!](https://preview.redd.it/w7dt7c4bwd371.png?width=1196&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=80e0a1b70f7bad3078d8bb3d3982d69b1d12f1bb)\n\n[It's been a long, tough run for Blackberry shareholders since they ended hardware production\\/sales. The stock has been largely irrelevant for years, falling from a peak of $146 in May 2008 to single digits \\&lt; $5B market cap. But its transition into a cybersecurity company is only beginning to pay fruit, which I believe the market will catch on to very soon. Times are a-changing!](https://preview.redd.it/f5zqz58dwd371.png?width=1202&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=763644f3ae3cc922a25d1e06d7d0a295ae5d5ed9)\n\n# A Rebranded Business for the Digital Economy\n\nLike we've seen with the Chads in Gamestoink, successful companies are the ones willing to renounce their fading legacy businesses and embrace initiatives and industries that sit on the cusp of the digital age. Enter Blackberry. Now we all remember Blackberry's legacy business- the handheld pagers that looked like shit, but only quirky people embraced (POTUS and CEOs used Blackberry pagers over iPhones for the longest of times, until Blackberry discontinued its hardware line).\n\nHowever, the primary focus for Blackberry has never changed. Blackberry was always security-centric, and with the installation of CEO John S. Chen in 2013, Blackberry pivoted towards software- a trend that was always going to happen given Apple's prowess in manufacturing superior smartphones.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[John S. Chen's my homie. If you're scared about holding BB bags, just reassure yourself that that chin can hold both yours and his. But seriously, he's an innovator, having been credited with \\\\\"Saving Blackberry\\\\\"- pay attention, his vision doesn't end with subsistence.](https://preview.redd.it/l39tl9rfwd371.png?width=716&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=91ee66024cfba9e04ea1566f5690aeb57ecd2497)\n\nBut like Ryan Cohen with Gamestop/Chewy, Blackberry recognized it needed to adapt to survive, and that's exactly what it has done under Chen's stewardship. A glimpse at Blackberry today is far different than the pioneer that once controlled 20%+ of the mobile hardware market.\n\n[Revenues have intuitively followed a similar trajectory as Blackberry's market cap. But the transformation under Chen's leadership so far is tangible: after hardware sales alone accounted for 82&amp;#37; of revenue in 2011, the company made a wide U-turn. After establishing \\(and meeting\\) a goal for fiscal 2020 revenue to top $1B again, hardware has fallen to just \\~3&amp;#37; of sales. Enterprise software \\(44&amp;#37;\\), Licensing &amp; IP \\(31&amp;#37;\\), and Technology Solutions \\(22&amp;#37;\\) now dominate BB's topline as of 2020, cementing its push and admittance to the cybersecurity market.](https://preview.redd.it/u9mg373iwd371.png?width=1194&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5c8790440834c2d2f933eb88018fa6971d95ce0e)\n\n# So what does Blackberry actually do now?\n\nTo be clear, the only people walking around with Blackberry \"phones\" nowadays are old junkies trying to revive some 2000s nostalgia. Blackberry doesn't make that archaic crap anymore. All you need to remember are three phrases when thinking about the new Blackberry: **enterprise software, licensing IP,** and **technology solutions**.\n\n* **Enterprise software** is one of the fastest growing components of BB's cybersecurity offering. It includes products like the Blackberry Enterprise Mobility Suite, which provides endpoint management and BlackBerry AtHoc, a secure communications platform.\n* **Licensing IP** is the segment responsible for the monetization of the Company\u2019s global patent portfolio as well as the mobility licensing operations, which license the BlackBerry brand and device software to handset vendors.\n* **Technology Solutions** is the business that includes BlackBerry QNX embedded software as well as several emerging businesses such as the BlackBerry Radar fleet management solutions.\n\nExciting Partnerships, Soaring Ambitions\n\n*\\*\\*You should really take a look at some of Blackberry's partnerships in the last 2 years- this is not a company that makes shitty pagers anymore, it's the company that embodies \"digital transformation.\"*\n\nTake a look at some of the companies Blackberry is sleeping with and tell me your smooth gorilla brain doesn't swell:\n\n* **Baidu** has an extensive partnership with BB in its autonomous vehicle unit, dating back to 2018. In January 2018, the two companies announced they would [partner](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2018/blackberry-and-baidu-partnering-to-accelerate-connected-and-autonomous-vehicle-technology) to utilize Blackberry QNX's OS as the backbone of Baidu's autonomous system. Blackberry also agreed to help Baidu integrate smartphone integration software for Chinese connected cars (CarLife), conversational AI (DuerOS), and HD maps. In January 2021, these two [expanded](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2021/blackberry-expands-partnership-with-baidu-to-power-next-generation-autonomous-driving-technology) their relationship: Blackberry's QNX Neutrino Real-Time OS is being utilized for all future EV models produced with the EV branch of GAC (Guangzhou Automotive Group, yes the C isn't a typo). Pretty exciting stuff to say the least..\n* **Motional**, which is a Hyundai backed AV startup, [announced](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2021/blackberrys-qnx-black-channel-communications-to-be-used-in-motionals-driverless-platform) in February 2021 its intentions to use BB's Black Channel communications technology for all of Motional's future AVs. A very integral input for Motional and impressive win for Blackberry, being able to ensure safe data communication exchanges within vehicle safety systems is essential for AVs' successful integration in society... otherwise where is the trust in accepting that ride? Not to mention that Apple (*the Tim Apple*) was chirping around with Hyundai and Kia, talking about making a \"smart car,\" *earlier this year!* I guess all the ape memes about Blackberry being a legitimate competitor to Apple shouldn't be sneezed at by Wall St equity research analysts and BB \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3bs...\n* **AWS**, yes Amazon Web Services (!), is another credible player lining up with Blackberry. Although not quite as exciting as building actual AVs, the work they do is still essential to ensure this dream can actually be realized. In December 2020, the two Chads [announced](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2020/aws-blackberry-join-forces-to-accelerate-innovation-with-new-intelligent-vehicle-data-platform) a multi-year partnership to develop BB's IVY platform (Intelligent Vehicle Data, yes the \"Y\" is weird, but makes sense for ape leadership), allowing automakers to read sensor data, normalize it, and create actionable insights from the data both in the vehicle and in the cloud.\n\nTake it from Amazon's new CEO, Andy Jassy himself: *\u201cAWS and BlackBerry are making it possible for any automaker to continuously reinvent the customer experience and transform vehicles from fixed pieces of technology into systems that can grow and adapt with a user\u2019s needs and preferences. Through this joint effort with BlackBerry, we will provide automakers with the insights, capabilities, agility, and speed they need to thrive in an increasingly connected world. As automakers seek to race ahead in their digital transformations, BlackBerry IVY empowers them to build their brands and set the standard for connected vehicle services across the automotive industry.\u201d*\n\n[These geniuses love Blackberry, starting with their most intelligent, scalable business: AWS! Shouldn't you apes like BB as well?](https://preview.redd.it/ktha1d7nwd371.png?width=1218&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=892b2415869531f1cf47f9c54b6d6e668c252877)\n\nBut why should I stop there? I'm tired of seeing fear-mongering Wall Street hedge funds, investment bankers, and research analysts attempting to push their positions (BB's primary competitors are IBM, Microsoft, VMware, and Mobile Iron, the former 3 of which are all significantly owned by \"institutions\" - &gt;75%) and allege Blackberry is a dying business that makes crappy hardware.\n\n* **Microsoft** (Yes its rival!) even realizes its budding competitor is crafting innovative solutions, announcing a partnership in [October 2020](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2020/blackberry-athoc-integrates-with-microsoft-teams-for-critical-event-management) for Microsoft Teams! Microsoft plans to integrate Blackberry AtHoc, which will allow organizations on Teams to contact, alert, and account for all members of their group directly through Teams should some calamity transpire. Especially as we witness more cyber attacks (the digital economy's biggest threat will stem from this), it will be an all hands-on-deck effort to safeguard the integrity of our software. BB's partnership with Microsoft (and [ServiceNow](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2020/blackberry-athoc-and-servicenow-partner-to-deliver-secure-and-re) for incident response management) not only grounds its strong advance to cybersecurity industry disruption, but its diverse agility to penetrate various sectors, ranging from AV/EV, CRM software, IoT, 5G, and so much more.\n* If the corporate pedigree isn't enough for you, I'll end with the **U.S. Air Force**. No, unlike what bulge bracket banks may lead you to believe, BB's revenue stream is well-diversified, as the USAF [announced](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2020/the-united-states-air-force-chooses-blackberry-spark-for-secure-productivity) a partnership in September 2020. Blackberry Spark, utilized for UEM and UES, will help the Air Force with their secure productivity needs, enabling virtual work environments whilst ensuring premium security. As we face more threats in the cyber space and continue pivoting towards a \"work-from-home environment\" regardless of the permanent trends form Covid, BB's wide-ranging partnerships, from Fortune 500 tech companies to the U.S. military prove it is an essential cog in the 21st century digital economy. Not to mention consistent ARR is exactly what investors (the suits) should be looking for, so what gives with the nasty financial press?\n\n# Blackberry's Financial Trajectory (Revs, Bottom Line, CF)\n\nWe have to take a look at Blackberry's financials, after all that is what this casino allegedly runs on. Luckily, if we ignore what the \"experts\" in Battery Park are shilling, we'll notice Blackberry is not the capsizing Titanic all the research analysts make it out to be. I'll take you into a deeper dive into the top &amp; bottom line with just the facts and my brilliant takes, and y'all can make your own decision on whether BB stock is seriously a pile of rat shit or an emerging growth stud.\n\n[As you might expect, Blackberry's overall top line consistently declined until roughly 2020+ \\(when every single one of these dope partnerships was announced\\). As BB wound down its legacy hardware, handset, and related service products, sales declined nearly $400M over the course of final two years, a marked decline from the near $20B struck in 2011. This trend seems to be on the reverse though: the new partnerships in 2020\\/21 have certainly underscored BB's transition into a software company, a trend even Wall St has had to acknowledge by lifting growth targets for fiscal year 2021. IMO, the $1.2B projected top line figure for '21 is conservative, and I think these figures could start to double, triple, and \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 in 2024+. Let me explain why with more charts:](https://preview.redd.it/3pq5gyspwd371.png?width=874&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e1a643492be05c1ec2f4830bd0b66b180276b6b3)\n\n[All those dope corporate and military partnerships I highlighted earlier? They mainly fit into BB's Enterprise software\\/services revenue stream, which is now 44&amp;#37; of overall revenue. This is the first component that I believe is going to drive revenue growth, profitability, cash flow, and tendies for us and BB in the years to come. We'll first notice that growth in this space really picked up in 2020 for BB, similarly to when their overall topline reversed trend- because this is the soul of 2021 Blackberry! And no, this doesn't even really include the innovative AV\\/EV partnerships, these are just institutional clients like Microsoft, ServiceNow, or Salesforce who want to buy one of Blackberry's SaaS established offerings. Think of the potential addressable market in the years to come: work from home, AI, 5G, IoT, we can keep going- all of these things need to be protected, without security, there is no system- every software, hardware, and appliance company under the sun is going to be lining up because they have no choice. You are adapt or go extinct. I expect BB to continue driving this aspect of its growth in a gargantuan way: think 25-50&amp;#37; growth YoY.](https://preview.redd.it/m106ixxswd371.png?width=846&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=59e12724037bc3b9f099ab2859bea4b6608f00ee)\n\n[If Enterprise Software is to be Blackberry's Patrick Mahomes, Technology Solutions will be Blackberry's Tom Brady. Since 2017, this aspect has doubled as a portion of overall BB revenue, from roughly 10&amp;#37; in '17 to over 22&amp;#37; projected in '21, reflecting BB's successful ongoing foray into innovative technologies. In this segment we see BB's partnerships with Motion\\/Baidu reflected, cutting-edge technology projects that will enable unfathomable innovations in the future. We could say autonomous vehicles, or drones or anything that will be automated- they will all need to be securitized, whether with each other or on the cloud. BB's deep partnerships with global leaders like Baidu indicate John Chen has been playing 4D Chess since 2013: intensive capital expenditures to transform a company's creative intelligence don't just happen with the snap of your fingers. Put simply, you don't just go from making pagers to making AVs overnight- it's a lengthy process that will affect your growth\\/profitability, as evidenced by Blackberry's fall from grace. But if my instincts are right, Enterprise Software and Technology Solutions will drive BB's revenue growth\\/profitability, propelling it back to $100B market cap in the not-so-distant future.](https://preview.redd.it/1h96psxuwd371.png?width=878&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=595d7f66d80d079394875a718984ee589b593bcc)\n\n[BB earns a decent amount of revenue from Licensing\\/IP, which is quite frankly a pleasant surprise to me. Essentially this component comprises BB's monetization of its global patent portfolio and licensing operations, which do things like license the Blackberry brand\\/device software to various vendors \\(a lot of handset\\). It is somewhat impressive that it's currently 31&amp;#37; of BB's top line, but then again not too surprising. Considering the Enterprise Software\\/Technology Solutions streams are at really nascent stages of growth, it makes sense that this more \\\\\"legacy\\\\\" revenue stream is so prominent. But then again, this component jumped over 20&amp;#37; in 2020 \\(what seems to be BB's turning point\\), so it's not like I'm going to argue with more revenue either. I'd say this the Matt Stafford component of BB: a reliable and solid contributor, but not something I would be betting the bank on either. But if it produces \\(which is certainly not out of the question\\), I won't complain either \\(unless I'm from Detroit\\).](https://preview.redd.it/fx1ebhmxwd371.png?width=858&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=06730b56ca47298cd1347a8c090542c1e90eae96)\n\n[I think we've established hardware\\/handsets are a legacy business for Blackberry. Why do I talk about it? B\\/c Wall Street does, and WSB often falls prey to their fear-mongering. DON'T PAY ATTENTION. It's like Mitch Trubisky- yeah that ish was dope in 2015-2016, but we all know it's washed now and the only reason we keep talking about is because shillers want to use it to keep diverting from the real gold.](https://preview.redd.it/j0fszgu0xd371.png?width=896&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e4b2250478ab2cb6ad49956d4b2f4f89560fc56c)\n\n[I'm not going to hammer earnings to crazy... to actually say with strong conviction that you can accurately forecast that out YoY is bullshit, and anyone from Wall St telling you they can is likely doing the same thing. Never the less, we see a clear trend: great profitability growth when Blackberry pagers led the mobile handset market, awful declines from 2012-2018 as BB closed hardware operations and invested in software\\/cybersecurity ambitions, culminating in the mixed bag we've been seeing in 2018 and beyond. Wouldn't be surprised to see this earnings churn to continue until \\~2023-2025, after all, you have to invest\\/incur losses if you want long-term profitability. I'm going to stay watching the 3 primary components of BB's revenue growth for now.](https://preview.redd.it/voaefw43xd371.png?width=1204&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=71f9cc1c63d585f57e3b88e20803c7f0f3ab4d79)\n\n[I care about Cash Flow far more than net income. Yeah, it's nice to look profitable, but how much money is actually coming in to your company? We see... a slow pick-up after 2020 \\(\\*pinch me\\*\\), when BB's resurrection appears to have started. Even in its legacy days, Blackberry was seeing hella cash leave the company, which just underscores software is a more profitable business than hardware. 2021 projections indicate Cash Flow could increase at the largest YoY rate in Blackberry's history \\(albeit from it's near-zero base\\). Nevertheless, if revenue growth booms like I think it will, FCF metrics are gunna look pretty green in 2022+.](https://preview.redd.it/ja112d95xd371.png?width=1234&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d56e1feaa214463cd5b3b518e9b1c6171368f65b)\n\n# My Strongest Convictions on BB\n\nWell apes, thanks for enduring my BB nut. Now time for you to swallow:\n\n* I don't believe BB is \"just a meme.\" To the tards that made fuckloads of money on BBBY, KOSS, SNDL, and even AMC (not GME, PM me if you want to debate what I would call GME) to an extent in these \"not-exactly-the-future\" businesses with high amounts of short interest- kudos to you, here's your \ud83d\udc51, King. But the tough truth is I'm skeptical that \"squeezing\" is always going to work. For starters, you think the hedgies are really that fucking stupid? I mean, come on, Chancellor/Emperor Ken Griffin had to extend Melvin $5B in credit, lather up Vlad, and testify in front of Congress. Don't exactly think continuous losses and Congressional subpoenas are exactly what the hedgies want either... I'm sure their risk management committee have been popping Addies daily since January to make sure they aren't overfuckingextended in one bet. \\*Cough\\* \\*Bill Hwang\\* Cough\\*\n* No, I truly believe Blackberry Ltd is the 2016 version of AMD in the 2021 cybersecurity market. Back then, AMD's legacy business was flailing, and the entire chip market was dominated by Intel. They went into the changing room, made themselves up, and reorganized. Capturing 1%, then 2%, then 3% of the market share seems so little nominally, but means so much for the top line, bottom line, and the share price when you go from 0 to 1. 1 to 10 may seem like a big jump, but it's launching from the ground (a baseline of 0) that is most lucrative- and that is *exactly where Blackberry (BB) sits right now*. Capturing 2% of the global cybersecurity market would send BB flying, and we'd be soaring back to $140. If BB is actually as innovative as I think, who knows?\n* Unfortunately, if you think this is a short squeeze, I'm sorry, get out. I actually kinda like seeing closes like today (plummeting down 15%), because we shake out the weak hands and I can buy more cheap shares. No one's forcing you to buy this stock, I just like it. Facts &amp; numbers don't lie either. Short interest is 9% on roughly 500M shares outstanding, so we would likely need Jay Powell, Cathie Wood, Elon, and Chamath to hop in if there was actually to be a \"squeeze\" overnight.\n* But to contradict myself somewhat, I also think June 2021 (right now) could be one of the most preferential entry points into BB ever. Data indicates 40% of the shares are owned by institutions (similar numbers to GME), indicating 60% is retail, many of them apes. The suits may scream \"overvalued reeeee,\" and they have a point, BB stock isn't exactly cheap. As it trades at roughly 8X forward sales, BB is valued as a fast growing company, but not beyond the likes of PLTR &amp; SNOW (yes different industries, but valuations that are multiple times higher) or competitors like Palo Alto Networks or Cisco. As a graduate student attempting to be not completely rarted with my limited capital, I love the risk-reward for BB, especially considering they report earnings on June 22. I suspect these numbers will come in far stronger than the St is saying, and at least they will start to lift future guidance in a significant way (both catalysts for a 50-100% move in BB IMHO). I guess we'll see how the financials reward BB's transition, but I am truly convinced this is the AMD of cybersecurity.\n* This last part is a mixed-bag (but suspicious if we dive deeper), and I'm sure a lot of apes will downvote me and possibly completely avoid BB with this knowledge, but I want to share facts since they are evidently so hard to find. We got the usual mutual funds (Vanguard, Fidelity, TD, etc) who own BB (roughly 25%) and two woke funds who invest in \"innovative trends\" own the other 15%. But data does indicate nasty little Ken (Citadel) reported buying 1.3M shares of BB in Q1. BB was heavily shorted pre-GME (like 30%+), and Citadel/gey bears almost definitely bought shares to cover. The question I'm wondering was did Citadel actually buy BB b/c they were so worried about a squeeze since it is a legitimate growth stock or b/c he shares my sentiments about its turnaround? Regardless, both seem like positive catalysts for the stock, and hopefully Ken answers my question.... oh wait...\n\n[Self-explanatory.](https://preview.redd.it/w33d8rdaxd371.png?width=1886&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ab406b459250bc6669c79e67c65c145f9b879709)\n\nObligatiory: BB to the moon.",

        "selftext": "Why you Need to Watch out for this new EV Player in 2021\nMentioned:\tAAPL AMZN F GM GOOGL INTC NKLA NSANY NVDA TSLA WKSP\nPresident Joe Biden's $2.3 trillion infrastructure proposal is packed with an ambitious green agenda for the U.S.\n\nIncluded in the plan is $620 billion in transportation spending with $174 billion invested in the electric vehicle (EV) market. The plan will enable automakers to spur domestic supply chains from raw materials to parts, retool factories and give consumers point-of-sale rebates and tax incentives to buy affordable American-made EVs.\n\nMoreover, it will establish grant and incentive programs for state and local governments and the private sector to build a national network of 500,000 EV chargers by 2030.\n\nTraditional automakers including Ford (NYSE: F), General Motors (NYSE: GM) and Nikola (NASDAQ: NKLA) are competing with tech companies such as Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), Google's parent Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL), Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC) and Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA) to get a piece of the EV pie.\n\nRecently, reports about Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) joining the EV bandwagon have surfaced. According to The Korea Times, Apple is close to signing an agreement with LG Magna e-Powertrain (KRX: 066570). If the agreement with LG Magna is reached, the two parties will then jointly establish the precise details for the production of the Apple car, and a prototype might be teased in early 2024.\n\nOne company that stands to benefit from this spectacularly is Worksport (OTC: WKSP).\n\nDisruptive Innovation\n\nFounded in 2011, Worksport is a globally recognized designer and producer of tonneau or truck bed covers. The Canadian-based company is a disruptive innovator with its mobile solar technology \u00e2?? the TerraVis\u00e2?\u00a2.\n\nThe technology provides solar power to over 50 million light trucks on the roads today and is a key source of clean energy to recharge upcoming EV trucks. The TerraVis\u00e2?\u00a2 can provide up to 30% or more of the power needed for the average daily commute.\n\nThe TerraVis\u00e2?\u00a2 system is a first-of-its-kind mobile solar power generation system. It can generate up to 1kWh of mobile power off-grid. The TerraVis\u00e2?\u00a2 Cor battery system takes power from the cover and stores it in modular battery packs \u00e2?? storing 1.5 kWh of energy in up to 4 batteries that can be transported in the truck bed using the mounting system.\n\nThe TerraVis Cor can also act as a standalone consumer product \u00e2?? making it available for purchase even if you're not a truck owner. The system will allow the same level of freedom from a power grid, being chargeable via any wall outlet, solar panel or 12V power source.\n\nEarly Mover Advantage\n\nWorksport will leverage the TerraVis\u00e2?\u00a2 system and its position as a Tier 1 original equipment manufacturer (OEM) to secure future partnerships and distribution of its conventional truck bed tonneau covers.\n\nThe company has already forged OEM supply partnerships with 2 EV truck nameplates \u00e2?? one of which is in partnership with Nissan (OTCMKTS: NSANY)\n\nApart from the tonneau cover market, Worksport finds itself in the pickup specialty equipment market \u00e2?? $12 billion as a whole \u00e2?? with the EV market ($162 billion) and the battery storage system market ($2.9 billion).\n\nWorksport is now in an enviable position as it stands to support a plethora of EV giants and traditional automotive makers that are committing to electrification.\n\nRecent Developments\n\nOn June 1, 2021, Worksport forged a working relationship with Ontario Tech University (OTU) that will start as a 2-year contract. With this partnership, the company will get access to the world-class ACE Testing facility, collaborating with the research team that is supervised by Professor Sheldon Williamson, Ph.D.\nWorksport plans to finish prototyping the TerraVis solar truck bed cover system by the end of Q3 2021. OTU and Worksport will complete validation and fine-tuning for TerraVis pre-launch in Q4 2021, and accelerate toward full manufacturing in 2022.\nTerraVis Cor\u00e2?\u00a2 has entered the production prototype phase with the first pre-production prototype expected to be ready by early Q3 2021. The prototype system(s) will be fully operational and is expected to mirror the commercial model available at the turn of 2022.\nOn May 27, 2021, Worksport decided to take advantage of its recent opportunities in raising capital to onboard several new hires: 2 full-time industrial engineers, 1 industrial designer with specialties in 3D modeling and interactive preparation, and 2 advisory engineers.\nWorksport currently has $10 million in cash and cash equivalents with no long-term debt.\nTo learn more about Worksport, you can visit its website here.\n\nWorksport is a partner of Benzinga.

Its consumer products are marketed under the brands Crucial and Ballistix. Micron and Intel together created IM Flash Technologies, which produces NAND flash memory.\u00a0Their current market cap is\u00a0$88.97 billion.\n\nMicron remains firmly positioned in a memory market as more products require chips that are experiencing a shortage right now. Many see the company's situation as a big reason why you should be buying their shares.\u00a0The shortage could particularly benefit Micron in the DRAM memory market, where South Korean chipmakers Samsung and SK Hynix are its only competitors. DRAM made up about 68% of Micron's revenue in 2020. Additionally, the company claimed about 23% of the global DRAM market.\u00a0The NAND sector is a bit more diversified thanks to the presence of Western Digital and its SanDisk subsidiary. However,\u00a0Micron is one of the largest suppliers in this segment as well.\n\nMicron's earnings for the first quarter of 2021 showed little difference from what the analysts were expecting.\u00a0They reported earnings per share of $0.98, which is 3 cents more than the consensus estimate. They reported a slight beat of revenue estimates as well. Their Q1 2021 revenue came in at $6.24 billion compared to the estimated $6.23 billion.\u00a0Their next earnings report is scheduled for **Jun 30, 2021**.\n\nAnalysts from **Deutsche Bank**\u00a0estimate Micron's stock to reach\u00a0$110 in the next 12 months. The analysts at\u00a0**Wells Fargo**\u00a0also have high expectations for this stock with a price target of\u00a0$115. Out of 24\u00a0analysts, 18\u00a0have\u00a0given Micron a BUY rating and 6 a HOLD rating.",

        "selftext": "Chances are that you have heard of a stock that goes by the ticker [$CCIV \u2013 Churchill Capital IV](https://utradea.com/stocks/CCIV), and if you haven\u2019t I would suggest reading this report to see what all the hype is about. In this report I will provide you (the reader) with all the information you need to know about the upcoming merger, as well as Lucid\u2019s plans to be a top EV competitor in the future. If you would like to keep updated on some more hype stocks in a report style similar to this one, follow my account [here.](https://utradea.com/member-portfolio/WallStreetWhale)\n\n**Company Overview:**\n\n*Churchill Capital IV:*\n\nChurchill Capital IV ($CCIV) is a blank check company that was formed for the purpose of completing a merger (or other business combination) with Lucid Motors (Ticker: $LCID, post-merger). Churchill Capital was founded by Michael Klein, who is expected to stay a part of the company (Lucid Motors) post-merger to create long-term value for the business.\n\n$CCIV completed their blank-check IPO on August 3rd, 2020, in which they sold 207M shares at $10/share, generating proceed of $2.07B, which will be used later to fund the merger. Furthermore, Churchill Capital raised another $42.85M by selling 42.85M warrants for $1/warrant, this money will also be used to fund the merger.\n\nThe acquisition is said to have a pro-forma acquisition value of $11.75B and is said to be completed (in their investor presentation) by early Q3, 2021.\n\nOn February 22nd, 2021, Churchill Capital entered into an [Agreement and Plan of Merger](https://sec.report/Document/0001104659-21-026358/) with Lucid Motors. This business combination will be consummated after a vote for the approval of the shareholders.\n\n*Lucid Motors:*\n\nLucid Motors was founded in 2007 in Newark, California, at this time their company was named \u201cAteiva\u201d rather than Lucid Motors. Ateiva was originally a company that developed and sold their electric batteries and powertrains to other electric vehicle manufacturers.\n\nBy 2013, Ateiva was a recognized and respected producer of battery packs, and electric powertrains, and started to entertain the idea of developing their own electric vehicle(s). It was at this time, that the now CEO/CTO Peter Rawlinson joined the company.\n\nIn 2014, Lucid secured their first round of funding to develop their own vehicle. At this point Lucid was not putting too much thought into the design but managed to make their own 900 Horsepower (HP) vehicle that went 0-60 (MPH) in 3 seconds, and with good range.\n\nIn October of 2016, Ateiva officially decided to rebrand and change their name to Lucid Motors and started to take their vision of becoming an all-electric luxury vehicle maker very seriously. They started out of the gate very quickly, as they announced their plans to break ground in Casa Grande, Arizona and started to construct their $700M, 590-acre factory (AMP-1) in November 2016 (just one month later).\n\nFast forward 4 years to November 2020, and we see Phase 1 of this factory being [completed](https://www.prnewswire.com/ae/news-releases/lucid-motors-completes-construction-on-first-greenfield-electric-vehicle-factory-in-north-america-commissioning-process-underway-for-spring-2021-production-start-of-lucid-air-301182337.html), which is enabling them to produce 34,000 of their Lucid Air vehicles (1st production vehicle) annually. Furthermore, Lucid is preparing to start the 2nd phase of their factory build, which will allow them to manufacture their upcoming Gravity SUV and increase production from 34,000 vehicles per year to 90,000 vehicles per year. This phase is expected to start as soon as late 2021 and be completed by the summer of 2023.\n\n**Investment Information:**\n\n*Termination information:*\n\nThis merger deal can be terminated under any of the following conditions:\n\n1. There is a mutual agreement between Churchill Capital IV and Lucid Motors that they want to both terminate the deal.\n2. The merger is not consummated by October 22nd, 2021\n3. Any government entity ordering/taking action to prohibit the merger.\n4. If there is a breach of contract by either of the companies (Churchill and Lucid), then the other company can choose to terminate the deal.\n5. If Churchill\u2019s shareholders vote against the consummation of the merger.\n\nIf the acquisition falls through for any of the conditions as listed above, then Churchill Capital will gather all of their capital into a trust account and redistribute it to their existing shareholders, if this were to happen shareholders will likely receive $10/share owned. However, if Churchill gets sued, and the lawsuit is successful, then Churchill Capital is required to pay out these claims before their shareholders, which will result in a shareholder payout of less than $10 per existing share.\n\n*PIPE (Private Investment into Public Equity) Information:*\n\nChurchill Capital agreed to sell $2.5B worth of Class A common stocks to their PIPE investors. These shares were sold to the PIPE investors at a price of $15/share, which means that PIPE investors bought 166.667M shares. This is important because the $15 level that PIPE investor bought in at can be seen as a potential bottom for the stock, implying a downside (pre-merger) of 41.18%.\n\nUnder Churchill\u2019s [subscription agreement](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1811210/000110465921026358/tm217491d2_8k.htm) (outlining the terms for the PIPE investors), it notes that the PIPE investors are not allowed to liquidate their shares until 90 after the completion of the merger (if the SEC decided to not review the registration statement) or 150 days (if the SEC reviews the registration statement). This is very important because the PIPE investors will sell at least some of their shares the second they are legally able to, because they need to reduce their risk and diversify into other investments. Knowing this, we can expect Lucid\u2019s share price to fall on this date due to large amounts of selling.\n\n*Experienced Management Team:*\n\n* 12 of Lucid\u2019s 20 management team member have worked at a variety of car companies (both electric and non-electric) including Tesla, Rivian, Ford, General Motors, Hyundai, Audi, Volkswagen, Mazda, Jaguar, Land Rover, Lotus, and Ferrari.\n* Peter Rawlinson (the CEO and CTO), previously worked as the Chief Vehicle Engineer of the Tesla Model S, which helps to speak on his knowledge and experience primarily in the electric vehicle space.\n* Furthermore, the non-vehicle centered management members have worked on the management teams of Apple, Siemens, Intel, PayPal, Magna, eBay, Cisco, and Pillsbury previously to working at Lucid.\n\n***Lucid\u2019s Battery Technology:***\n\nAs we know, Lucid (formerly Ateiva) used to solely manufacture battery packs and electric powertrains for electric car manufacturers. Furthermore, Ateriva (which is now Lucid\u2019s technology wing) has been producing battery packs for Formula-E racing cars for 6 seasons, which displays the history and high level of performance that Lucid\u2019s batteries can achieve.\n\nAdditionally, Lucid\u2019s battery has been ranked as the most efficient battery (in terms of miles/kWh), ranking at 4.5 miles/kWh, compared to Tesla\u2019s Model S, which ranked 2nd with 4.0 miles/kWh). This higher efficiency enables Lucid\u2019s customers to enjoy longer range, faster charging times, and lower cost battery packs.\n\nThe Lucid Air Grand Touring model has a 500-mile range, a top speed of 168 mph and a 0-60 speed of 3.0 seconds, making it very competitive with Tesla\u2019s Model S long range edition. Lucid\u2019s Air Grand Touring has a price tag of $139,000 compared to Tesla\u2019s Model S Long-Range Edition\u2019s price of $73,000. This is because Tesla has been able to achieve economies of scale to reduce their manufacturing price, whereas Lucid has just started to manufacture their vehicles. However, in 2020 Lucid plans to release their Air Pure model at a competitive price of $77,400, which will be more comparable to the prices offered by Tesla.\n\n***Lucid\u2019s Charging Infrastructure:***\n\n* **Electrify America:** Lucid has announced their partnership with Electrify America, which is the second mover in the charging space (behind Tesla). Electrify America also allows 900Vcharging, which is optimal for Lucid vehicles as it allows them to charge at their fastest speeds. Electrify America currently has 600 charging stations with over 2,600 individual chargers across America. Electrify America is also growing very quickly, and a map of their reach can be found [here](https://insideevs.com/news/504444/electrify-america-opens-600th-charging-station/).\n* **Other Partnerships:** Lucid has also stated that their cars will be able to receive charging from other aggregators and station owners such as ChargePoint and EVgo.\n\n***Forward Technology:***\n\n* Lucid ID Profiles  \n\n   * Facial Recognition automatically recognizes driver profiles and adjusts to their preferences.\n* Predictive Analytics  \n\n   * Improves the car-driver relationship by using AI to learn driver behaviours and automatically adjusts to fit these behaviours.\n* Sensor Suite  \n\n   * Lucid has integrated 32 onboard sensors, which is the most among production vehicles.\n* Autonomous Driving  \n\n   * Lucid is planned to launch their Level 2 Autonomous Driving functionality and is able to undergo software updates through the cloud.\n   * This is not yet close to Tesla\u2019s autopilot; however, it is only the start of Lucid Autonomy, and is already better than many of their other competitors.\n* Mass Production ready  \n\n   * Although Lucid has not yet started to mass produce their cars, they have designed their cars to be readily available for mass production when the time comes in order to have a smooth transition and leverage their economies of scale.  \n\n      * An example of this is their \u201cbrick\u201d injection mould which is designed to be manufactured in the millions and be integrated into any of their cars in a single operation.\n\n***Proprietary Technology:***\n\n* **Wunderbox Boost-Charge Technology:** Wunderbox is the first bi-directional system on the market that is capable of withstanding 900V, which enables their 300kW fast charging.  \n\n   * Their charging speed is approximately 6.67 minutes/100 miles of charge, compared to Tesla\u2019s speed of 7.5 minutes/100 miles.\n* **Lucid has applied or been issued 407 patents:** Approximately 338 of these patents have been issued to Lucid and the other 69 are still in the application process. This is good news for Lucid as they grant Lucid with a competitive edge, depending on the nature of their patents.\n* **Micro Lens Array (MLA) Lighting:** Lucid\u2019s MLA lighting allows their headlights to adapt to driving and weather situations to provide optimal visibility to ensure driver safety.  \n\n   * An example would be if it were foggy, the car would gradually adapt to the level of fogginess to ensure the best visibility at any given time.\n\n***Market Outlook:***\n\n* **Luxury Vehicle Market:** The global luxury car market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 5% over the next 5 years, growing into a $733.2B industry by 2026. This presents an opportunity for Lucid to potentially capitalize on, especially with increased government mandates and incentives, and the consumers increased demand for EV\u2019s.\n* **Total Addressable Market:** Currently, Lucid expects to capitalize on 2% of their TAM, through their Lucid Air Sales in 2021/2022. This is a very reasonable estimate and would represent 34,000 vehicles sold. In 2023, Lucid is looking to capitalize on 2-3% of their TAM, which would be 80-90k vehicles sold. Lastly, in 2030 Lucid is expecting to capitalize on 4% of their TAM, which would translate into 600,000 vehicles sold in 2030.\n* **Total Annual Deliveries:** Lucid is forecasting a total vehicle delivered CAGR of 88.22% between 2022-2026, which will result in 251,000 cars delivered by 2026.\n* **Total Revenue:** Lucid id forecasting a revenue CAGR of 78.95% between 2022-2026, which would translate into $22.76B in revenue for the year of 2026.\n\n***Market Strategy:***\n\n* **Pre-Orders:** Lucid opened their Air models to pre-orders, where customers can reserve the car for a fee of $300-1000. Lucid opened this up in Q1 of 2021 and judging by the existing reservations, Lucid is expecting $800M in anticipated sales. However, these reservations can be cancelled, so it would be illogical to assume all of these pre-orders will translate into sales.\n* **Showrooms:** Lucid has a direct sales strategy so that their customers can experience the car before making their decision to ensure interactions are on-brand, and pressure-free. Lucid currently has 6 showrooms in large cities across North America that are open for the public, and Lucid is planning to expand these showrooms into Europe in late 2021.\n* **Lucid Digital Journey:** Customers can engage with Lucid via their app, website, configurator and much more. There has not been a lot of information released about this yet, but this is what they have released.\n\n***Future Application Possibilities:***\n\n* Passenger Vehicles\n* Busses\n* Helicopters and other Aircrafts\n* Heavy Equipment and Agricultural Equipment\n* Energy Storage Systems\n\nInvestment Valuation:\n\n*Valuation:*\n\nSince, $CCIV is just a shell company, and Lucid (the company becoming public) has not had to make their financial reports available to the public, it is very hard to determine any sort of price estimate or use any valuation techniques that I have learned. Also, since they are pre-revenue, it is even harder to estimate the fair value off this stock.\n\nTh only way in which I can make any sort of valuation is to use the free cash flow forecast information that they provided in their investor presentation.\n\nIn this DCF model I arrived at a fair value per share of $29.86, which implies a share price increase of 17.02%. However, this DCF model is likely not all that accurate due to the lack of available information about Lucid\u2019s financial position.\n\n**Catalysts:**\n\n* **Merger Date Announcement:** Churchill Capital investors have been anxiously waiting on the news of the merger date to be dropped. Once this happens it could serve as a catalyst for the stock heading up to their merger date.\n* **Autonomous Driving:** If Lucid announces that their level 3 or level 4 autonomous driving has more autonomous features and mimics that of Tesla\u2019s autopilot, there will be excitement amongst investors, and people might buy more shares. This is especially true if you look at the EV space as a \u201ctechnology race\u201d like many others do.\n* **Future Improvements to their Battery Technology:** Lucid has already highlighted that their battery is the most efficient and compact, however if they continue to improve upon their battery technology, then more people might find their cars useful and be willing to purchase them. If this happens their revenues might outperform, and their stock price may jump.\n* **Partnerships:** As we know, Lucid has already partnered with many companies like Electrify America, EVgo, ChargePoint, LG etc. If the news breaks that Lucid is partnering with more companies that can help them increase their product and reach, then their stock price is likely to be affected.\n* **Updates on Factory Production:** If Lucid is able to finish the construction of their Phases on time, or even sooner than anticipated, they will be able to produce more vehicles quicker than before thought. This should signal to investors that they are ahead of schedule and that earnings are likely to be good, causing investors to buy in.\n\n**Risks:**\n\n* **No Operating History and Revenues:** The lack of public information on Lucid as a company may scare off some potential investors. Additionally, Lucid is a pre-revenue company, which bears a lot of uncertainty for the future. Furthermore, if future financial information comes out, and it is not near where Lucid projected it to be, then some investors will sell due to their valuations being off.\n* **Merger is Never Consummated:** If the merger is terminated, or if they merger does not happen by October 22nd,2021, then the potential losses will be at least 60.82% (based on the current price of $25.52), and losses might even be more than that.\n* **The exercising of Warrants:** As previously mentioned there are 42.85M warrants, these warrants can be converted into common stock upon expiry, which has the potential to dilute existing shares by up to 20%. This is not favourable for current shareholders.\n* **PIPE Investor Liquidation:** Once the PIPE investors are able to liquidate their shares, Lucid\u2019s stock is likely to have a massive sell off, which will hurt the share price in the short term. However, if you are bullish on this stock this may be less of a risk and more of a buying opportunity.\n* **Chip Shortage:** The ongoing chip shortage is likely to have adverse impacts on the Lucid\u2019s production estimates, and if Lucid is not able to meet their targets, investors may worry and potentially panic sell. Also, this will affect the DCF model that I built out and Lucid may not be undervalued due to their heightened estimates.",

It is considered a solid play due to its consistent and predictable geology and recoveries relative to drilling and completion costs. Long story short, it is not a risky play in terms of exploration coming up unsuccessful, which is a plague in the industry, and on a energy company's books.\n\n**Marcellus Shale**\n\n[Map from USGS.GOV](https://preview.redd.it/6frdji2alu471.jpg?width=400&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3788b15537904285ae3f4863d07673add644f45a)\n\n**As of year-end 2020, AR had the following assets in the Marcellus Shale:**\n\n\\-515,000 net acres located primarily in northern West Virginia, which is strategically located bordering near Ohio and PA.\n\n\\-Operation of 1000 producing horizontal wells\n\n\\-17.6 Tcfe (trillion cubic feet of natural gas equivalent) of net proved reserves. \n\n\\-1,877 undeveloped core drilling locations.\n\n**UTICA SHALE**\n\n[Map from USGS.gov](https://preview.redd.it/e26trv3vku471.jpg?width=497&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=916d7280721a2e645b777cc8669e494c73205bd6)\n\nNow on to the Utica Shale, which is located a few thousand feet below the Marcellus Shale. Think of the Utica Shale as that girl in High School that you knew was going to be a smoke show but she hung out with the Drama Club and was a lil too quick witted for you at the time. Yes, we all know that this was mostly due to the amount of bong hits you did in your buddy's Honda Accord when out for lunch. I digress. Back to the Utica Shale and the great state of Ohio, where Antero has 91,000 net acres, 200 horizontal wells currently producing, 2.0 tcfe (here I'll write it again but remember it this time, trillion cubic feet of natural gas equivalent), and 494 *undeveloped* drilling locations. I italicized undeveloped because AR knows how big of a play Utica will be down the road. Also, touching on the critical importance of location, location. location, AR's acreage is located bordering West Virginia and PA. To emphasize the importance of their foothold, here are links showing AR's locations in reference to a map of heat spots for natural resources.\n\n[Antero Resources Utica Shale Locations](https://preview.redd.it/3na88rd9ku471.png?width=379&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4df23d878fee9f6a0c010ca1db8ea6c83a5455d9)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[\\(Photo Above\\) Antero Resources Marcellus Shale Locations](https://preview.redd.it/4l8qbu9cmu471.png?width=619&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=166b32c42be108dded44eeb01857ed881fe1913a)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[\\(Photo Above\\) United States Geological Survey Results of where Total Organic Carbon \\(TOC\\) was high.](https://i.redd.it/zh0lnkifmu471.gif)\n\nThe United States Geological Survey's mean estimates of undiscovered, technically recoverable resources, indicate that the Utica Shale contains about 38 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, about 940 million barrels of oil and 208 million barrels of NGL. \n\n**Natural Gas Futures:**\n\n\\-Rallied to eight month highs as of Friday 6/11/21 at the Market close\n\n\\-July NG (NG1:COM) was up 4.7% to nearly $3.296/MMBtu (Metric Million British Thermal Unit), which was the highest front-month contract settlement since 10/30/20.

This EO would require major suppliers to disclose their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and related risks. With this being put into play and the goal of net-zero emissions goal by 2050, as well as cutting GHG emissions by 2030, Antero is in a very good position. \n\nIt is my belief that with AR planning on being net-zero by 2025, and being positioned geographically where they are in the U.S. they will somehow benefit from the Infrastructure Plan if/when it goes through. According to Forbes, prior to the pandemic, the economic boom that kicked off in SE Ohio at the Utica Shale around 2011 resulted in $86B in new capital investments and created over 200,000 new jobs for Ohio citizens by the end of 2019. Unemployment rates that had stood as high as 15.5% in 2009 dropped into the 5-6% range ten years later. It seems to me that the NG Industry, if done correctly in terms of the environment, could be a major benefactor from an administration looking to create a ton of jobs. \n\n**TLDR**\n\n\\-AR is reducing debt on the balance sheet \n\n\\-A current leader in the industry in terms of ESG \n\n\\-Notorious for keeping expectations low and over-performing also known by another term, described by John Beckwith in [Wedding Crashers](https://getyarn.io/yarn-clip/f45a8bb4-c30d-4a9b-97e7-223cab02bc4d)\n\n[5 Year Chart of AR](https://preview.redd.it/hszgx4zzbv471.png?width=1692&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d96591d2b36d198b12bb0565ef947c97533cdd14)\n\n**Positions:** \n\nShares &amp; January 21, 2022 $20c @ $1.20\n\n*Not Financial Advise as I am on beer number 2.*",

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, June 3, 2021**\n\nStocks dipped today, with the three major indexes pulling back after a recent run of gains in the last two weeks. Seems like after the recent run of gains we are seeing some profit taking across the board. I see no real reason for the dip given that new economic data released today was overwhelmingly positive. Looking ahead, market participants are waiting for May\u2019s Job Report slated to be released tomorrow.\n\nAmid negotiations with Republican lawmakers regarding the proposed infrastructure bill, today, the Washington Post reported that President Biden was open to reconsidering his previous proposal to raise the corporate tax rate to from 21% to 28%. This proposed increase has been one of the main sticking points during negotiations. Now it is reported Biden would recommend a minimum corporate tax rate of 15%. \n\nWe got two pieces of good news in the labor market today. On one hand, according to a report by payroll processing firm ADP, the private sector added 978,000 jobs in May, well ahead of consensus estimates of 650,000. On the other hand, according to the Labor Department\u2019s Weekly Jobless claim report, showed 385,000 new jobless claims, roughly in-line with 387,000 estimate and a fresh pandemic low, a great sign that the labor market is improving as the economy continues to recover. \n\nThese reports set the stage for the official May Jobs Report set to be released tomorrow by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which will be critical in determining the pace of economic recovery and whether the Federal Reserve will consider tapering monetary support in the near future. The April Job Report was extremely disappointing, showing only 266,000 jobs added compared to the 1 million expected, and marking a sharp deceleration compared to March. \n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Extremely volatile trading continued in AMC, which saw it\u2019s stock price recover from roughly 30% down to more than 10% up and only to dip again towards the end of the day. Other \u201cmeme stocks\u201d traded in similar patterns after rocketing up in the last few days. \n* AMC issues and additional 11 million shares today, with the company taking advantage of its surging stock price. \n* Boeing Co Chief Executive Dave Calhoun on Thursday pointed to potential \"supply constraints\" beginning in the summer after a \"more robust\" recovery from the coronavirus-related downturn than he had imagined, another sign that demand is catching up in many industries faster than supply as the economy roars back from the coronavirus-induced recession.\n* Twitter (TWTR) on Thursday said it will roll out a new subscription product initially in Australia and Canada called Twitter Blue, which will let paying users edit their tweets before posting and change the color theme of their app. Twitter has recently been making big pushes trying to raise revenue\n* Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) is moving ahead with $12 billion plans to build a new semiconductor factory in Arizona. The US government has been aggressively pursuing semiconductor companies for investments, looking to secure its supply of semiconductors. Intel (INTC) also recently showed plans to also build new factories in Arizona. \n* Jack Ma's Ant Group has been approved to run a consumer finance company, the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission [said Thursday.](https://www.cbirc.gov.cn/branch/chongqing/view/pages/common/ItemDetail.html?docId=987949&amp;itemId=2005&amp;generaltype=0) This is one of the first step of Ant's forced restructuring after China pulled the plug on its $35 billion IPO in October 2020. It also means the company will be regulated more like a traditional financial entity, giving authorities more oversight over company operations\n* **\\*\\*Please note that the current stock price was written premarket and does not reflect intraday changes.\\*\\***\n* Cigna[ ](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24CI&amp;src=cashtag_click)(CI)target raised by Morgan Stanley from $254 to $321 at Overweight.

        "selftext": "President Biden\u2019s $2.3 trillion infrastructure proposal includes $620 billion in transportation spending with $174 billion invested in the electric vehicle (EV) market. Biden\u2019s plan will enable automakers to spur domestic supply chains from raw materials to parts, retool factories and give consumers point-of-sale rebates and tax incentives to buy affordable American-made EVs. This will establish grant and incentive programs for state and local governments and the private sector to build a national network of 500,000 EV chargers by 2030.\n\nAutomakers such S Ford, General Motors and Nikola are competing with big tech companies like Amazon, Alphabet, Intel Corporation, and Nvidia Corporation to get in the EV game.\n\nAnd one company stands to gain from all of this... WKSP (Worksport Ltd). \n\nWorksport is a globally recognized designer and producer of truck bed covers. They are a disruptive innovator thanks to their mobile solar technology \u2014 the TerraVis.\n\nTheir technology provides solar power to over 50 million light trucks currently on the roads today and is a major source of clean energy to recharge upcoming EV trucks. The TerraVis can provide up to 30% or more of the power needed for the average daily commute.\u00a0\n\nThe TerraVis system is a first-of-its-kind mobile solar power generation system, generating up to 1kWh of mobile power off-grid. The TerraVis Cor battery system takes power from the cover and stores it in modular battery packs \u2014 storing 1.5 kWh of energy in up to 4 batteries that can be transported in the truck bed using the mounting system.\n\nThe TerraVis Cor can also act as a standalone consumer product \u2014 which makes it available for purchase even if you\u2019re not a truck owner. The system will allow the same level of freedom from a power grid, being chargeable via any wall outlet, solar panel or 12V power source.\n\nWorksport has the early mover advantage and is leveraging the TerraVis system and its position as a Tier 1 original equipment manufacturer to secure future partnerships and distribution of its conventional truck bed tonneau covers. They\u2019ve already secured a partnership with Nissan. \n\nThanks to their partnership with Ontario Tech University Worksport has access to the world-class ACE Testing facility, collaborating with the OTU research team. \n\nWorksport will complete validation and fine-tuning for TerraVis pre-launch in Q4 of this year, and accelerate toward full manufacturing in 2022 (if not sooner). \n\nTerraVis Cor has already entered the production prototype phase with the first pre-production prototype expected to be ready by early Q3 2021. The prototype system(s) will be fully operational and is expected to mirror the commercial model.\n\nFinally, in April the CEO announced that Worksport had filed for listing on the NASDAQ and will be issuing a common stock and warrant offering as part of that listing... which would make them available on the NASDAQ in 2021.\n\nWKSP is currently trading at $0.64/share over the counter; after a $0.20 increase in share price today.\n\nHappy investing!",

        "selftext": "Which semiconductor companies will be most likely to receive funds after the bill is signed into law? Here are my thoughts and assumptions. Please correct any mistakes. Disclaimer: I own positions in Intel, Micron, and Applied Materials.\n\nMy understanding is that the bill is largely meant to support and consolidate semiconductor manufacturing and semi cap manufacturing in the U.S. Thus, U.S.-based companies with facilities in the U.S. that want to develop their semiconductor manufacturing capabilities in the U.S. will be the most likely to receive funding from this law as well as future support from the U.S. government which is aligned with rare bipartisanship to address and neutralize the threat of China\u2019s growing global technological dominance. Those companies will have a competitive advantage in the marketplace after receiving these funds, regardless of other fundamental or technical factors.\n\nHowever, the funds will come in the form of grants and tax credits. My understanding, and here's where I'm making big assumptions, is that companies must apply to receive the funds and that this is an involved and competitive process. The law won\u2019t be signed until toward the end of this year at the earliest. Then companies will apply for grants to fund projects to build fabs, improve supply chains, etc.\n\nINTC and MU seem like clear favorites to receive funds because they\u2019re U.S.-based IDMs with facilities primarily in the U.S., and they\u2019re often included in news stories related to the bill. TSM and Samsung are outside the U.S., though that doesn\u2019t mean they couldn\u2019t hypothetically receive funds to build a fab in the U.S. But if grants are competitive, then how likely would TSM or Samsung be to receive funds to build a new fab if they were competing with Intel or MU for the same funding, based purely on the intent of the law being to support U.S.-based semiconductor business?\n\nAMAT also seems like a favorite to receive funds even though ASML has a monopoly on the most advanced semi cap equipment. ASML is based in the Netherlands and only has two facilities in the U.S. Also, I speculate that AMAT could use funds from the law to put toward R&amp;D to compete with ASML, but my knowledge in that area is lacking.\n\nIt won\u2019t be until next year before companies can even start applying for funds. There probably won\u2019t be any winners for projects until at least a year from now.\n\nCatalysts:\n\n* Bill gets signed by the end of this year.\n* Companies submit applications for projects and winners are announced.\n* Winners start receiving funds and investing them in projects.\n\nThis isn't advice. I'm not a financial advisor.",

        "selftext": "AMD's latest financial reports blew all estimates out of the water... and their latest guidance for 50% growth (up from 37%) is conservative. Here is why:\n\nFUNDAMENTALS: IT'S ALL ABOUT ENTERTAINMENT\n\nIn a post COVID-19 world, people will continue to flock towards entertainment.\n\nAs  confirmed by both TESLA and AMD recently, the latest Model X and S will  bring AMD silicon (GPU &amp; APU). This is HUGE, because this feature  will eventually trickle down as an optional to the Model 3 and rest of  the Tesla fleet. Why is this important? Just listen to Elon Musk drool  over PS5 performance on road trips with autonomous driving. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vl\\_-bFNRJaw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vl_-bFNRJaw)\n\nBut that IS NOT ALL, as Valve will be launching a new portable handheld. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFn6LzUFTTA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFn6LzUFTTA)\n\nIn essence PS4, PS5, XBOX X &amp; S and Valve are all going FULL AMD.\n\nWho do you think Ford, GM, Chrysler, Mercedes, BMW, Audi, Volkswagen, Renault/Nissan will go with?\n\nENTERTAINMENT IS KEY and AMD is all over it.\n\nThis  is also HUGE as entertainment software will be tailored to AMD's  processing pipeline. Unreal Engine 5 is the perfect example, which  ALREADY performs better on a 6800XT than it does on a RTX3080 (up to 12%  better, as per Digital Foundry's performance benchmark - see screenshot  and video link below).\n\n[AMD 6800XT on left with 61fps - NVIDIA RTX 3080 on right with 56fps](https://preview.redd.it/wgykwgfhty471.jpg?width=1289&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7f2c5a018dfb47c628f1ce1d2650a138e1be0267)\n\n(digital foundry's benchmarks) [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C99VwDGyLg0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C99VwDGyLg0)\n\nUnreal  Engine 5 (with Lumen) will make Nvidia Ray Tracing a thing of the past.  This software solution is much more efficient at managing illumination,  making it available for non-RTX hardware.\n\nIn  addition, enthusiasts are really pumped with AMD's latest presentation  at Computex, where they presented Fidelity FX SuperResolution. It aims  to provide up to 2x performance while super sampling images up to 4K.  And the kicker is that this solution will be available to ALL.\n\nIntel's  Raja Koduri (Head of Intel GPU, formerly an AMD employee) has already  confirmed they are looking into AMD's Fidelity FX SR (as per his twitter  post days ago): [https://twitter.com/Rajaontheedge/status/1399964541291622407?ref\\_src=twsrc%5Etfw](https://twitter.com/Rajaontheedge/status/1399964541291622407?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\nSo yeah, AMD is the future of GAMING.\n\nBut on the stock analysis front, AMD has also begun its climb towards previous highs.\n\nIt has made a huge recovery since my latest post, when it was trading in the low $70's.\n\nJust imagine that AMD is trading at a Price/Earnings multiple of 34, with a market cap of $98.7B\n\nNvidia is trading at a P/E of 84 (over twice as much), with a market cap of $444B (over 4 times more).\n\nBut when you look at the financials, the differences shrink.\n\nOn Revenue, AMD has sales of $9.7B and net profits of $2.5B. Nvidia sold $16.6B for a net $4.3B.\n\nHow does that support Nvidia being over 4 times more expensive than AMD? It just doesn't.\n\nIf AMD were to trade at the same multiples: EPS of 2.38 \\* NVIDIA's P/E of 84.28 = $200 per share.\n\nAt $200 per share, AMD's market cap would be $243B... STLL HALF OF NVIDIA!!!! (WTF?!?!).\n\nThink about it, it is bound to close the distance towards $200 per share in the next 12 months.\n\nThe reasons are simple: Tesla, Valve, Unreal Engine 5, Ryzen 3D stacking and 50% growth for 2021.\n\nThe Xilinx deal WILL CLOSE in the next 6 months. THE BREAKOUT is IMMINENT!!!\n\nTo summarize, the product pipeline is AMAZING, not to mention the leaks on RDNA3 and Ryzen 4.\n\nThe new clientele is incredible: TESLA and Valve, added to Microsoft and Sony.\n\nJust imagine Xilinx FPGA accelerators integrated to AMD's Intellectual Property. Fuel the rockets!!!\n\nREMEMBER: In a matter of months you will be kicking yourself for ignoring this post!\n\nThe MOON is for amateurs.... WE'RE GOING TO MARS BABY!!!... with TESLA AND AMD!!!\n\nMARS - THE RED PLANET... WITH LISA AND ELON. PRIMATES AND APES TO COLONIZE IT IN 2022!!!\n\n..... ALL ABOARD!!!!",

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, June 4, 2021**\n\nStocks rose today as investors digested the May Job Report, which showed non-farm payrolls rise by less than expected for the second straight month. Market participants seem to be interpreting the back-to-back miss in job gains for two consecutive months as meaning the Federal Reserve will keep the current accommodative monetary policy in place until the labor market shows robust signs of improvement.\n\nThe Labor Department\u2019s May Job Report showed the economy gained 559,000 non-farm payrolls, a substantial increase compared to April but still below estimates of 650,000. For months, the Federal Reserve has consistently reiterated it wants to see a \u201cstring\u201d of strong labor reports, like the one in March, before policy adjustments are seriously considered. This is why technology and growth stocks, which would be affected the most by potential adjustments in policy, outperformed today. Former Chase Chief Economist Anthony Chan said, \u201cWhat I see here is somewhat of a \u2018goldilocks\u2019 overall economy. I see that employment is increasing. With regard to the reason why the market is excited, it's because it's telling us that the economy is not blistering hot, that it's actually going to be opening up pretty gradually. I think that's important.\" \n\nRecent economic data has been good overall. A stronger-than-expected ADP private payrolls report and weekly jobless claims report released Thursday each underscored firming rehiring trends across the economy, with a smaller share of individuals becoming newly unemployed for pandemic-related reasons. Another wave of vaccinations has taken place, reopenings have picked up, and businesses have been scrambling to bring back workers to keep pace with surging demand. \n\nFederal Reserve Bank of New York President John Williams said that the economy was \"still quite a ways off from maintaining the substantial further progress we\u2019re really looking for in terms of adjustments to our asset purchase program.\"\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Marqeta Inc. (MQ), plans on IPOing soon at a valuation of $12 billion offers card-issuing technology that lets businesses build out these functions. The company\u2019s largest client is Square (SQ), which accounted for roughly 70% of revenue last year.\n* Square (SQ) is considering making a hardware wallet for bitcoin, CEO Jack Dorsey, said in a tweet. (Jack Dorsey is also the CEO and co-founder of Twitter)\n* GE CEO Larry Culp says the deal to combine its jet-leasing unit and GE Capital Aviation Services with rival AerCap (AER) remains on track to close later this year or early next year. \n* Twitter (TWTR) on Thursday said it will roll out a new subscription product initially in Australia and Canada called Twitter Blue, which will let paying users edit their tweets before posting and change the color theme of their app. Twitter has recently been making big pushes trying to raise revenue\n* Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) is moving ahead with $12 billion plans to build a new semiconductor factory in Arizona. The US government has been aggressively pursuing semiconductor companies for investments, looking to secure its supply of semiconductors. Intel (INTC) also recently showed plans to also build new factories in Arizona. \n* Sorry, no price target upgrades today",

        "selftext": "Alright apes so here is the deal. I wanted to play nice, I wanted everyone to win those big juicy tendies, no matter how they get them, but I heard something in the Jim Crammer interviews with UWMC CEO  that stuck with me and is preposterous. It was not even the $5,000 penalty ultimatum $UWMC imposed if any of their mortgage brokers does business with $RKT  (which was a dick move to begin with more on that later) but rather the CEO's answer when he was asked in the second interview \"how he is going to take on $RKT to become the top mortgage lender by 2024\" . Mat's answer was \"$RKT revenue is going to decrease on ours is going to increase because $RKT will lose money as interest rates go up because their business is 94% refinance\" here are my two reasons why this is not a winning strategy or accurate guidance from the CEO:\n\n1. Let's start with this dumb $5,000 penalty ultimatum. Mat Ishbia UWMC CEO is trying to \"protect the broker channel\" by encouraging consumers looking for a loan or refinance to always go through a broker as opposed to going on an app like \"Rocket Mortgage\" which cuts out the middle man broker (link to interview below). Mat's argument is if you are a mortgage broker and partner with $RKT is they are undermining the broker because they are taking business away from the broker by going direct to consumer on the Rocket Mortgage app. While on the surface this looks like a valent effort to protect the hard earned market of mortgage brokers it is ill advised and actually hurting brokers financially. UWMC fantasizing that this would change consumer behavior but it will not. Consumers who want to get their mortgage direct through an app are not the same consumers that are likely to get their mortgage through a broker. To relate this to a different industry lets use accounting (since I'm in this space). There are certain people who will want to file their own taxes and not deal with an accountant for reasons like: it's cheaper, they don't want people knowing their business, ect. Then their are consumers who will only use an accountant for reasons like: they like relying on a professional or they do not have time to their taxes themselves. You can think of Intuit turbo tax as the company in this example. For whatever the reason may be consumers have varying reasons for their behavior and I argue in the case of getting a mortgage or refinance it's almost two different groups of consumers. One that prefers a broker and the other that prefers to do it themselves through an app. This being said this only hurts mortgage brokers in the end because they cannot process any leads through $RKT hurting the people Mat Ishbia is claiming to protect. Lastly $RKT can win the battle on the mortgage broker end, they have the ability to drop their fees charged through a broker to entice more brokers to exclusively work with them. If UWMC continues to play this game in the race to the bottom RKT will beat them at their own game and eventually lead to UWMC removing the $5k penalty. $RKT already lowered their rates to crush them and they are still guiding in their Q1 estimates a higher gain on margin than $UWMC\n\n[Interview where the $5,000 penalty ultimatum is said](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/24/uwm-ceo-says-fight-with-quicken-loans-is-paying-off.html)\n\n2) Getting back to the statement that the CEO believes $RKT revenue is going to decrease and UWMC is going to increase for them to be the top mortgage lender by 2024 is more ill advised fantasy guidance (link to interview below). Personally I think AMC has a better chance of hitting $10,000 before $UWMC is beating $RKT.  The likelihood of UWMC doubling revenue and RKT revenue decreasing by 50% is very very unlikely as alluded too in the clip. The $UWMC CEO also fails to recognize $RKT has already won the industry and they are moving on to take over other sectors that are growing at triple % rates\n\n* Rocket Homes is going to take on Zillow eventually with a one stop shop of buying a home with your pre approved mortgage all built into one app\n* Rocket Autos is going to launch in an app and they are going to be competing against Carvana with the advantage of having your financing all built within the app so you have a one stop shop for searching for the car and setting up your monthly payment\n* Amrock title insurance services, property valuation and settlement service is growing at the highest level of closing history per their Q1 release\n* See the news article below. $RKT also hedges against the price of rates rising from their purchase of government backed mortgages and is now selling them for a profit [Mortgage companies are making money off your forbearance plan](https://www.wsj.com/articles/mortgage-companies-are-making-money-off-your-forbearance-plan-11623835802)\n* $RTK is still sitting on a share buy back program that they have yet to start where as UWMC has momentum and a buy back program occurring right now and it has still yet to pop off. \n\nWith all of these new and fast growing revenue streams, and one industry already dominated, $RKT is the way, short and long term. Not to mention they have a massive advertising campaign and they're trying to crush $UWMC out of their own price war so $RKT could be extremely profitable if they wanted to be, but they don't right now. Right now they want to dominate all these sectors first, like Amazon did early on, and then turn on the profit tendie machine at a later date and watch the earnings roll in.\n\n[Interview where UWMC saying it will be top mortgage lender by 2024 b/c $RKT revenue will decrease](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2021/06/11/united-wholesale-mortgage-ceo-on-goal-to-be-top-mortgage-lender-by-2024.html)\n\nI want to conclude with the fact that I love this sub and the ability of this group of apes on line at Wendy's to fundamentally change the way the boomers view stonks. I watch CNBC constantly and it's amazing how they just dismiss WSB as a bunch of retards. While this may be true, the truth is no-one knows wtf they are doing in the market, not even these hedge funds. The truth is you all do some great DD on different stocks with very intelligent points. I'm happy to be in a place where we can write about our deep understanding of technical and fundamental analysis while also getting shit on in the comments like it's an MW2 chat lobby",

        "selftext": "Hello degenerates!\r\nIf there is ever one stock which facilitates the gambling marketplace for mobile games and trading at reasonable valuation, it\u2019s none other than $SKLZ. This one stock can make your dream of becoming a millionaire come true with huge upside in the upcoming years \r\nSkillz ($SKLZ) is the publicly traded e-sports platform where millions of players compete for cash prizes. The games literally look like shit but people play for money with a fee to enter the tournament for the chance to win real money. \r\nAs the payouts are huge, most of the users are addicted to this platform and spend an average of whopping 60 mins on their platform. As a matter of fact, Skillz currently ranks above Facebook, TikTok and YouTube on the average length of time its users spend per day on their platform as per their investor presentation.\r\nKey considerations for investment \r\n1.\tTrading at valuation of $8.9B. Super cheap when compared to a total TAM of $175B across the geographies (Source: Investor presentation for TAM)\r\n2.\tFY2020 reported revenues of $230M (&gt;92% YoY growth). ~376M by 2021. $550M by 2022 (Source: Company filings &amp; consensus estimates)\r\n3.\tLead by Andrew Paradise (impeccable track record AisleBuyer acquired by Intuit; Double Picture acquired by MPA). \r\n4.\tThey just went public by the same guys that took Draftkings $DKNG public, Jeff Sagansky and Harry Sloan; Continuously  supported by Cathie Wood who only looks for investments with disruptive innovation &amp; higher return potential (&gt;10x)\r\n5.\t2.7M Monthly Active Users; 1.9 million paid entry daily tournaments; GMV of $1.6B (Latest 10Q quarterly report)\r\n6.\tDifferentiated Business Model: Although Skillz\u2019s end market is mobile gaming, its model differs vs. traditional mobile game publishers. To start, Skillz operates a competition-based, multiplayer platform that drives engagement through competition. Skillz players submit to tournament entry fees, while mobile game publishers generate the majority of their bookings through in-app purchases and typically monetize less than 5% of the playing population, in addition to advertising. (Source: Company filings &amp; Investor presentation)\r\n7.\tTake rate of ~15% and an impressive 95% Gross margin. Adj. EBITDA to be positive by 2022. Contribution is already positive &amp; expected to reach $245M by 2022E (Source: 10-K, Investor presentation &amp; consensus expectations)\r\n8.\tGrowth! Growth! Growth. Competition is now closed for submitting game by developer for NFL. NFL with its massive following of 100M people worldwide shall sponsor the game to the fans &amp; guess what people who download the game shall be on-boarded on to the Skillz experience &amp; some of which will become members on the platform. Huge cross-selling opportunity within the rapidly growing user base.\r\n\r\n9.\tAcquisition of Aarki to broaden SKLZ\u2019s footprint: $150M acquisition of Aarki, a technology driven marketing platform shall give access to advanced Machine Learning algorithms to be augmented by Skillz\u2019s deep first party data. Aarki\u2019s reach of ~465 Million monthly users will extend Skillz\u2019s player acquisition capabilities\r\n10.\tAnother lever for growth! Google\u2019s PlayStore news shall increase the growth in terms of user base growth across 15 countries which is a huge revenue booster (expands the TAM by at least $15B as mentioned in the investor presentation)\r\n11.\tBottom-line: With expected sales to be ~$550 million in 2022 (~60% CAGR), very high gross margins (~95%), zero debt, an enormously growing gaming industry, an extremely diverse user base, and higher user engagement on the platform makes it a no brainer buying option in 2021\r\n\n\nAlso remember that INDIA NFL and NEW GAMES are ALL DISCOUNTED from they projections! On the last earnings call the CEO Andrew clearly mentioned that SKILLZ only puts out projections for games already launched. \n\nSynchronous games are in final stage of testing - Synchronous means live PVP gaming which opens up an entire new stream of gamers !",

        "selftext": "Wassup shitheads,\n\nThis isn't financial advice or investing advice at all.\n\nIt's time to grab some freeze-dried bananas cause we are about to go to the fucking moon and you can't have conventional bananas up there.\n\nSoFi is an all-in-one digital banking app. What started as a student loan financer has developed quickly into a one-stop-shop for your financial needs. Want to invest in stocks? SoFi's app allows you to do that. Need a personal loan because you YOLO'd your life savings and just got margin called? Okay, you degenerate. SoFi's got you covered. Debit Cards? Credit Cards? Yep. Yep. \n\nOkay so now that we got through what the app is, let's get into the nitty-gritty of their performance.\n\n**The Good**\n\nNet Revenue saw 151% YoY growth\n\nMember growth is seeing it's 7th consecutive quarters of accelerating YoY Growth. \nCurrently, they are at 2.2 Million users **with a 110% YoY growth**\n\nTotal Products saw a **121% YoY growth, their financial service products saw a 273% YoY growth.**\n\nIf you're too smooth-brained to understand so far, they are gaining a shit ton of people and those people are using their products and printing their money. \n\nGalileo Accounts saw a **130% YoY growth**\nWhat are Galileo accounts? I'm so fucking happy you asked you beautiful smooth brain\n\nSoFi acquired Galileo, which is a really fucking nerdy SaaS that handles transactions. They handle direct deposits, transfers, bill paying, checking balances, etc. \nMeaning not only is SoFi acting as a fintech for consumers, but they are also a SaaS for businesses. Fuck Robinhood, but they are one of Galileo's customers. \n\nThey are EBITDA positive!?\n\n**The Leadership Team**\nI would be remiss to not mention the leadership team.\nCEO - Anthony \"motherfuckin\" Noto\nA quick breakdown of that guys life.\nGoldman Sachs associate turned partner because of his understanding of the internet industry.\nInterim CFO of the NFL.\nCOO of Twitter.\nCEO of SoFi.\nThink about it, the COO of twitter is now the CEO of a fintech that has the EXACT SAME DEMOGRAPHICS AS TWITTER.\nTHIS GUY FUCKS.\n\nChief Marketing Officer - Lauren Webb\nPreviously the Marketing VP at Intuit - Intuit owns TurboTax, Mint, and Quickbooks \nBefore that she was the Senior Brand Manager for COVERGIRL\n\nHead of Brand Strategy previously worked at a brand strategy firm, where he was the lead brand strategist for taco bell and PlayStation.\n\n**Previous Valuations**\n2015 - 1B Valuation from Softbank\n2019 - 4.6B Valuation from Qatar Investments\n2021 - 8.6B Valuation from Social Capital. Yes, I know about Chammath and we will talk about that.\n\n**The Bad**\nWith every bull there is as bear that wants to take your lunch money. In this case, there are actually a bunch of bears.\n\nThere are currently no short shares available because of how much this stock is shorted. It's fucking nuts so proceed with extreme caution. I'm not stupid though so I am not going to tell you a short squeeze, even though last Friday there was a 260% short interest rate. There won't be a short squeeze tho cause dilution and all that shit.\n\nChamath - Look I hate this guy as much as the next but think about it. CLOV was a company that needed to go public through a SPAC. I honestly think that SoFi didn't need to go through a SPAC. and honestly SPCE is cool but this is the only actual investment worth investing in with Chamath's portfolio. Again this is not investing advice.\n\nTL;DR\nThe short bus is leaving, get in while you can. SoFi is legit\nPositions \n34 Shares\n20c 6/4\n22.5 c 7/16\n20c 1/21/22",

        "selftext": "LISTEN UP  DEGENERATES!\n\r\nIf there is ever one stock which facilitates the gambling marketplace for mobile games and trading at reasonable valuation, it\u2019s none other than $SKLZ. This one stock can make your dream of becoming a millionaire come true with huge upside in the upcoming years \r\nSkillz ($SKLZ) is the publicly traded e-sports platform where millions of players compete for cash prizes. The games literally look like shit but people play for money with a fee to enter the tournament for the chance to win real money. \r\nAs the payouts are huge, most of the users are addicted to this platform and spend an average of whopping 62 mins on their platform. As a matter of fact, Skillz currently ranks above Facebook, TikTok and YouTube on the average length of time its users spend per day on their platform\r\nKey considerations for investment \r\n1.\tTrading at valuation of $9.8B. Super cheap when compared to a total TAM of $172B across the geographies\r\n2.\tFY2021expected revenues of $380 (+80% YoY growth). $555M by 2022\r\n3.\tLead by Andrew Paradise (impeccable track record Double Picture acquired by MPA; AisleBuyer acquired by Intuit). \r\n4.\tThey just went public by the same guys that took Draftkings $DKNG public, Jeff Sagansky and Harry Sloan; Continuously  supported by Cathie Wood who only looks for investments with disruptive innovation &amp; higher return potential (&gt;10x)\r\n5.\t2.6M Monthly Active Users; 2B tournaments per year with a GMV of $1.6B\r\n6.\tDifferentiated Business Model: Although Skillz\u2019s end market is mobile gaming, its model differs vs. traditional mobile game publishers. To start, Skillz operates a competition-based, multiplayer platform that drives engagement through competition. Skillz players submit to tournament entry fees, while mobile game publishers generate the majority of their bookings through in-app purchases and typically monetize less than 5% of the playing population, in addition to advertising.\r\n7.\tTake rate of 20% and an impressive 95% Gross margin. Adj. EBITDA to be positive by 2022. Contribution is already positive &amp; expected to reach $245M by 2022E\r\n8.\tGrowth! Growth! Growth! Google\u2019s PlayStore news yesterday will open floodgates in terms of user base growth across 15 countries which is a huge revenue booster (expands the TAM by at least $15B as mentioned in the investor presentation)\r\n9.\tBottom-line: With expected sales to be ~$555 million in 2022 (~60% CAGR), very high gross margins (~95%), zero debt, an enormously growing gaming industry, an extremely diverse user base, and higher user engagement on the platform makes it a no brainer buying option in 2021",

        "selftext": "bla bla apes bla bla stupid idiots bla bla not financial advice bla bla intro meme\n\nReal talk, I'd like to reintroduce you to the deep value gaming market stock the world seems to have forgot about.\n\nI've been bleeding out on FDs in sideways trading hell on this for too many months and its about time everybody opens their eyes to this play...and reap the inevitable rewards.\n\nIn the shadow of the $AMC mega-gains, you might overlook $CRSR's respectable 7% lift this week.  But this movement is actually the sign of a fuse thats just been lit.I shouldn't have to give most of you too much introduction on the company itself. Corsair was founded in 1994, and has since become one of the global leaders in PC gaming hardware and peripherals.  The company IPO'd last September at \\~$15 and made a heroic run up to almost $51 before retreating into a seemingly never-ending sideways cycle. The company has a proven track record in an exploding industry.\n\n# Rockstar Fundamentals\n\nWhether you care about the F-word or not, Corsair has been an incredible buy opportunity. Even before the pandemic their revenues and profits were growing.\n\nCRSR is on track to exceed $2bln revenue this year, more than doubling 2019 sales.  Profitability margins have been increasing every year since IPO\n\nThey have plenty of cash in the tank, and have been paying down debts. Its held 5% by Insiders, and a whopping 77% by institutional investors.  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r6tc7coxn3371.png?width=836&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=26e7364054a60f1b492cfcbd2b1fb672c1a77ab6\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8wfy4lwyn3371.png?width=821&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3b9bbdf6f4a9971648fa7799d8bcf1b2680e1828\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe company isn't a one-trick pony. Aside from dominating some hardware sectors like Memory, Corsair has been making strategic acquisitions in the streaming space (most notably scooping up Elgato.)\n\nBy all accounts, Corsair is making all the right moves and is currently firmly in undervalued territory.\n\n# Months of sideways strangulation by FUD-bears and Shorts.\n\n$CRSR investors have endured many months of maddening sideways trading. For the first few months it seemed like it was trading with the market...and that investors were just waiting to see what happened with some upcoming news.\n\nBut after releasing good news after good news, the stock has continued to stagnate, and bounce around in completely unnatural intraday boom/bust cycles. Almost on queue swinging -2% to +2% to -2%  every day.\n\nThe reason for this is due to a mix of a very **low float and ridiculously low volume.** These two factors have allowed swing traders and institutional short sellers to play this stock like a fiddle.\n\nCRSR has just **92 M** shares outstanding, and  **26.51M** shares in the float\\*\\*.\\*\\* Most of the shares are held by institutions.\n\nShort interest has been hovering around 20%. Which is high on its own...but doesn't tell the full story. Big pocket institutions have been selling tens of thousands of shares short in the AM, then covering intraday.\n\nWith the low volume, it doesn't take much to push the price down substantially without much ammo.\n\nThe big boys have been writing calls / buying puts, and then using shorts and their own holdings to push  the price down before exercise.\n\nMeanwhile, bears have been spreading FUD throughout the investment world about CRSR on 3 primary points. None of which have actually come to fruition.\n\n1. **CRSR is a \"Pandemic Play\", and gaming will magically disappear after things return to normal.**   This is the biggest boomer bs. The pc gaming and esports industries have been absolutely exploding over the last few years. Not to mention the streaming space which has been growing independently of it.  CRSR sales are cyclical like every retail company, but Q1 sales showed no signs of slowing.   Gaming is not going anywhere.\n2. **THE SPOOOOKY Lockup period will cause millions of shares to flood the market.** There was tons of FUD spreading about 14 million IPO shares that would become unrestricted for sale back in March. People were convinced that these shares would flood the market instantly and tank the price.  But the lockup period came and went, almost no shares were actually sold.\n3. **The global supply chain shortages means CRSR will not be able to grow.**  True, the microchip shortage is a threat to CRSR, but its also a threat to every other company in that space. What they've announced in their reports is that they had MORE DEMAND THAN THEY COULD FULFILL. That is not a bearish signal.  Despite the supply chain woes, CRSR sales dramatically beat expectations...showing they adapted and overcame this issue.\n\nYou may also be interested that the latest to join the short party is our good friends at Shita-del, making a short play at the end of May.\n\n# The 59% Earning Beat everybody ignored\n\nWhile some were expecting lackluster Q1 21 results as the pandemic wanes and supply chain issues rage on, in the May 2021 earnings release CRSR subverted all expectations. They beat estimates by an incredible 59%.  If anybody needed proof positive CRSR could weather the FUD, this was it.\n\nBut despite the stellar report, the stock actually DROPPED on the earnings report, and never recovered.\n\nYou might be saying \"of course the stock dropped, every tech stock drops on earnings\". Yes, this is true, IF there is a runup in the share price before the announcement. But in this case, there was no runup...the stock had been stagnant and even declining before the announcement.\n\nThis is when every retail CRSR holder knew this stock was not making natural movements, it was being intentionally held down.\n\nBy every logical account, the stock should have lifted in the weeks following the Q1 results. And because it didn't, the market has been ignoring CRSR due to the very effective FUD campaigns and short seller.\n\nBut this also means that the stock has entered deep into undervalued territory.\n\n# LOW FLOAT VOLUME ROCKET\n\nGiven all the drama, why should you be looking at this stock? Because the same factors that bears have been using to hold this stock down are exactly what will cause it to take off.\n\n**ALL $CRSR NEEDS TO BLOW IS A LITTLE MORE VOLUME**\n\nThe big bears have written calls and puts stacked around the $30-$35 strikes out through the EOY  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t0ujqgdnn3371.png?width=973&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1a506a07911ed26f5cbef6624b56a4717068089c\n\nAs soon as there is enough positive momentum on this thing from retail, the bearish trading strategies will become ineffective. They will lose a ton of money.\n\n# Breaking Out\n\nCRSR just hit $35/shr today for the first time since early March. This might not seem like much, but its the spark we needed.\n\nI will reiterate, all this stock needs to pop is slightly more positive volume. This stock is poised to blow up fast and hard.  The float is too small, the short-selling tactics will not work when this thing makes a run.\n\nAt the moment it can be moved with only about 50k shares volume... if the volume increases even by 10% or so, its going to run.\n\nAs CRSR continues its exceptional performance, it's only a matter of time before it breaks free from the cycle, and it looks like it will happen sooner than later. When it does happen....the shorts will crumble.\n\n\\*\\*TL;DR\\*\\* A few thousand more people buy $CRSR the rocket gonna go Pop  \n\n\nPositions:  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xse2n6qpn3371.png?width=1586&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=79d9b5cbecbaf98a53fec3d4c57b9b247275f77e\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0c9jf3qtn3371.png?width=724&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=696b50a0218adbddccd0b86aaf11aa2a79220236",

        "selftext": "Pembina  Pipeline Corp. has struck a  friendly deal to acquire Inter Pipeline  Ltd. for $8.3 billion in an  all-share deal after the midstream company  was put in play earlier this  year.\n\nUnder  the terms of the deal, shareholders of Inter Pipeline will  receive  half a share of Pembina for each share held, valuing the deal at  $19.45  per share based on the most recent closing price. That trumps  the  unsolicited $16.50 offer from Brookfield Infrastructure Partners LP   that Inter Pipeline rebuffed earlier this year. According to the release   issued Tuesday, Pembina\u2019s executive team will lead the combined  entity,  while Inter Pipeline will have representation on the board of   directors.\n\nInter Pipeline Chair  Margaret McKenzie said the deal with Pembina  represented the best value  for shareholders after the company launched a  strategic review in  February.\n\n\u201cIt was evident that a  combination with Pembina offered compelling  value for Inter Pipeline  shareholders in the short-term, as well as the  opportunity to  participate in the upside of \\[the Heartland Petrochemical  Complex\\] and  the combined business longer-term,\u201d she said in the  release.\n\n\u201cThe  creation of a more highly integrated business across the energy   infrastructure value chain results in a combined entity that is greater   than the sum of its parts.\u201d\n\nThat  Heartland Petrochemical Complex has been key to Inter Pipeline\u2019s  path  forward, with the project outside Edmonton slated to produce  525,000  tonnes of polypropylene per year upon completion.

        "selftext": "Hello degenerates. \n\nI've been looking into the EV market and everyone always says you late to the party or missed the train when buying EV shares (Missing the boat with TESLA etc). Its like the California gold rush in the old times! People rushed out to make money and find gold but the real entrepreneurs made money selling them their shovels, buckets, food and clothes. Electric Vehicles need charging bays, its a  no brainier?!? SO how on gods green earth can BLNK Shares be heavily shorted to 30% and \"Experts\" say this sector should see nothing but growth! \n\nI've done some very basic DD on BLNK. I've always been quite optimistic in this space for electric vehicles and for those that dont know BLNK provides charging solutions for Electric Vehicles. As of December 2020 they had 16, 617 charging stations around the USA but they are one of the most heavily shorted stocks on the NYSE. Over 30% short interest. I would hate to know what the outstanding naked short value is. \n\nNow when you look at expected Electric vehicle sales forecasts below:\n\n*\"The US electric vehicles market is expected to reach 6.9 million unit sales by 2025, up from 1.4 million unit sales forecast for 2020\"*\n\n[https://www.spglobal.com/platts/en/market-insights/latest-news/electric-power/111920-us-ev-market-sales-to-rise-to-69-million-units-by-2025-frost-amp-sullivan](https://www.spglobal.com/platts/en/market-insights/latest-news/electric-power/111920-us-ev-market-sales-to-rise-to-69-million-units-by-2025-frost-amp-sullivan)\n\nDeloitte even say this sector will continue to boom for the next 10 years.  \"Our global *EV forecast* is for a compound annual growth rate of 29 per cent achieved over the next ten years\"\n\n[https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/focus/future-of-mobility/electric-vehicle-trends-2030.html](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/focus/future-of-mobility/electric-vehicle-trends-2030.html)\n\nAND EVEN FORBES SAYS IT!!! I know Forbes hasn't always been on our apes side for the GME battle and AMC war but they seem to contradicting what is currently going on in EV charging! \n\n[https://www.forbes.com/sites/neilwinton/2021/03/09/electric-cars-are-coming-and-if-you-dont-like-it-tough/?sh=6f8be1c5698f](https://www.forbes.com/sites/neilwinton/2021/03/09/electric-cars-are-coming-and-if-you-dont-like-it-tough/?sh=6f8be1c5698f) \n\n*\u201cWith the prospect of sticker price parity even without subsidies by  2025, we take a strong positive view on EV penetration. We raise our  global EV sales forecasts again, this time mainly driven by higher  estimates for the U.S. market. We expect the Biden administration to  increase direct support for EV purchases,\u201d the UBS report said.*\n\n*The Biden plan for 500,000 charging stations would more than double  the current count, while it could impose tougher fuel economy standards  to curb ICE car sales. The ban on ICE sales by governments like  Britain\u2019s will also give a powerful signal to buyers to embrace  electric. .\"*\n\n They also out shot analyst expectations for revenue for the previous quarter see below.\n\n## Blink Charging (NASDAQ:BLNK) Earnings Information\n\nBlink  Charging last announced its quarterly earnings data on May 12th, 2021.  The reported ($0.18) EPS for the quarter, missing analysts' consensus  estimates of ($0.17) by $0.01. **The company had revenue of $2.23 million  for the quarter, compared to analysts' expectations of $1.71 million.**  Blink Charging has generated ($0.59) earnings per share over the last  year. Blink Charging has not formally confirmed its next earnings  publication date, but the company's estimated earnings date is Thursday,  August 12th, 2021 based off prior year's report dates.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8zncmbtdsm271.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ad2848ae0b193b360ddf5f727fe8b0e051c1b480\n\nI also cant explain how BLNK had a share price above 3600 in 2010. Maybe some wrinkled brains can help explain.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ucgewxa3um271.png?width=1610&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d8bf33e2f66e875cd6ec05d96c78450366962c42\n\nSo in ending for now I cant help but wonder what the hell is going on in the EV charging scene. With all this talk about the future Being EV, Biden backing the electric F150 and international markets across the scene being so bullish. How can one stock like BLNK be so heavily shorted. I would love to know how many Naked shorts have been placed against a company like this. \n\nI'm No financial advisor nor am I calling for people to load up on BLNK to squeeze the hell out of these hedge funds and their short positions. And just to clarify I am holding shares in BLNK and have been for some time.",

        "selftext": "Hear me out on this one as we are on the brink of theScore's BIGGEST catalyst.\n\nPosition: 1K shares at an avg of $CAD 12.18.\n\nThe stock is traded on the NASDAQ &amp; TSX under ticker: SCR\n\n**Some context on the company and it\u2019s industries (Sports Media/Sports Betting):**\n\nTheScore mobile is the number 1 most used sports app in Canada with 10 times more users than ESPN. It\u2019s one of the most used sports mobile apps in all of North America citing almost 4 BILLION user sessions over the last year. They have industry leading rates of user engagement at an average of 130 minutes per visitor with each user opening the app an average of 125 times a month.\n\nThis engagement is due to the many features in the app including: real-time sports news, live scores, in-game highlights, a social ecosystem where fans can chat and discuss live games, add friends, send private messages, etc. They have original media content, in-game odds, sports betting content and even personalized promos for bettors based on their in-app media interests. They\u2019ve reported close to 4 million unique users per month.\n\nTheScore achieved this success despite being a small company against industry titans. They\u2019re no stranger to being an underdog which now follows them in the mobile sports betting industry. PASPA was repealed in 2018 allowing individual states to offer legalized, regulated sports betting. The North American opportunity for this industry is estimated to represent a $US 22 billion opportunity by 2025.\n\ntheScore made the decision in 2019 to enter the market as an operator in [NJ through a partnership with Darby Development](https://mobile.thescore.com/2019/09/introducing-thescore-bet-thescores-mobile-sportsbook-launches-in-new-jersey/) with their Score Bet app. They have since expanded operations to a total of 4 betting states (NJ, CO, IN, IO) and have acquired market access agreements across 14 states via a [partnership with Penn National](https://mobile.thescore.com/2019/07/thescore-and-penn-national-gaming-enter-into-strategic-multi-state-market-access-partnership/) and other market access deals ([CZR deal](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210329005427/en/theScore-Secures-Market-Access-for-Mobile-Sports-Betting-in-Illinois-Through-Agreement-with-Caesars-Entertainment)) which represent more than 30% of the U.S. population and a $US 8.2 billion opportunity for them. The CEO and founder, John Levy, has stated that by next year they will be operating in at least double the amount of states and that they\u2019ll be active in 35 States within 3 to 5 years.\n\nTheScore recently rebuilt their media app completely in-house to increase its performance, stability, and scalability, likely related to continued user growth and future betting integrations. They\u2019ve built their \u201cFuse\u201d and \u201cBet Section\u201d as a fully integrated approach to link their gaming and media apps. Users of both apps can now build their bet slip while benefiting from all of theScore\u2019s features. When they\u2019re ready to finalize their bet, they\u2019ll be taken to the [Score Bet app](https://www.thescore.bet/) to place their bet or cash out. This is a defining feature that their highly engaged userbase will remember and one that will lead to higher rates of retention vs competitors that treat the bet as just a transaction. This approach not only increases retention rates but also greatly reduces their customer acquisition costs in an industry that is renowned for not having brand loyalty.\n\nThe New Jersey handle (Percentage of the total amount of bets taken in the State) rose 195% versus the prior year, validating that their unique combination of media and betting remains a powerful differentiating factor against competitors in their oldest operating State. Total gaming handle also grew 46% overall compared to the previous quarter. They are the only media company to be operating their own book and they\u2019ve been seeing these early signs of success. Other companies have started to take notice as they\u2019ve been buying or partnering with media companies via expensive deals (ex: [DKNG 1](https://www.sportico.com/business/sports-betting/2021/draftkings-buys-vsin-1234625970/), [DKNG 2](https://www.draftkings.com/about/news/2020/09/draftkings-and-espn-enter-into-co-exclusive-content-integration-agreement/?wpsrc=Organic%20Search&amp;wpaffn=Google&amp;wpkw=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.draftkings.com%2Fabout%2Fnews%2F2020%2F09%2Fdraftkings-and-espn-enter-into-co-exclusive-content-integration-agreement%2F&amp;wpcn=about&amp;wpscn=news%2F2020%2F09%2Fdraftkings-and-espn-enter-into-co-exclusive-content-integration-agreement%2F), [PENN](https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/1/29/21113130/barstool-sports-penn-national-deal-dave-portnoy-chernin), [FOX](https://www.starsgroup.com/press-center/the-stars-group-news/the-stars-group-and-fox-sports-announce-historic-u-s-media-and-sports-wagering-partnership)). However, they have not been able to develop the same seamless approach that theScore has attained internally.\n\ntheScore, like all other sports betting companies is currently sitting at a negative EBITDA. They reported a loss of (17.5 M) in the last quarter. This is because we are still in the early days of a high-growth industry. Companies have to get passed all of the free promotions and incentives that are offered, Market entry costs, etc and then they have to retain their users to start seeing profits. They reported a handle of 81,6 million, a 491% YoY increase, with Net gaming revenue being ($2.4M) and a media revenue of $8.0 M, a 17% increase.\n\ntheScore is not the loudest nor the flashiest betting operator. You won\u2019t see Score ads like you do with some other companies because they\u2019re targeting their existing userbase in a way that is financially responsible. They aren't aiming to do flashy deals. They won\u2019t win by trying to outspend the big guys, but they already know this, as it\u2019s a situation that they've already been through. Instead they're growing their numbers organically with their customer focus.\n\n**So, what\u2019s this huge catalyst that I spoke of?**\n\nThe Legalization of Mobile Sports Betting in Canada, where theScore Media app is a household name will [likely take place](https://nationalpost.com/news/politics/here-are-the-liberal-bills-likely-to-pass-this-spring-and-others-that-could-be-doomed-by-an-election) within the next 3 weeks or earlier.\n\nLast week, bill C-218 passed its 2nd reading in the Senate, this is often where the biggest risk lies.\n\nTomorrow, it will be studied by a Standing Committee. After passing that stage it will then move to 3rd reading before becoming law.\n\nThe bill is supported by provincial bodies, [by every major sports league](https://www.gamblingnews.com/news/cga-major-sports-leagues-support-the-push-for-single-event-wagering/), and even sports broadcast companies as their viewership numbers continue to decline. It just so happens that the [Deputy Chair of the reviewing committee](https://sencanada.ca/en/senators/smith-larry-w/) also served as [Commissioner of the Canadian Football League (CFL)](https://www.tsn.ca/cfl/video/cfl-hopes-for-the-pass-of-bill-c-218-in-order-to-boost-future-revenue~2205144).\n\nThe opportunity presented by this bill passing is forecasted to be US$4 to US$5+ billion at maturity. TheScore is actively preparing for this opportunity and extremely well-positioned to benefit long-term as Canada\u2019s leading mobile sports media brand.\n\n10% penetration of the Canadian Market = $US 400 Million15% penetration of the Canadian Market = $US 625 Million20% penetration of the Canadian Market = $US 850 Million\n\nThe current market cap is valued at $US 843.647M which indicates that this legalization is not currently priced in, as it wouldn't take into consideration everything else that theScore has built. The stock\u2019s technicals have bottomed out and we can finally see that the trend is reversing. All of this, combined with SCR\u2019s low float will mean an explosive next few weeks.\n\n**Bonus info about eSports:**\n\n\\- Gen Z is half as likely as millennials to watch live sports and 2x more likely to never watch\n\n\\- 35% of Gen Z identify as eSports fans, a higher percentage than NASCAR, MLB and NHL\n\n\\- There\u2019s a potential for \\~6 million new bettors with an outsized affinity for eSports over the next five years\n\n\\- 495 million people watched eSports online or on television in 2020, worldwide and viewers are projected to grow to 646 million by 2023.\n\neSports betting will be one of the biggest categories of sports betting over the long term, if not the biggest. theScore eSports has the #1 esports media following with 186.5 million reported video views in their most recent quarter, which represents a 139% YoY growth and an average social media reach of 88 million a month. Guess who\u2019s actively seeking and preparing opportunities to enter this space?\n\n**TLDR:** PEOPLE LIKE GAMBLING ON SPORTS AND ESPORTS. SCR, the #1 Canadian Sports Media app entered Sports Betting and is seeing encouraging results. They\u2019re also the leading eSports media brand and are actively seeking to enter esports betting which will eventually become one of the biggest betting categories.\n\nLegalization of Canadian Sports betting is expected in the next weeks + US Sports betting expansion means that this company is extremely undervalued for its future potential in a $US 22 Billion industry. \ud83d\ude80",

Right now they are recovering, growing and gaining marktet share. I don't want to do much of a TA, don't feel like i'm spot on with thise things.

(2019 was 6%, 2020 was 9%)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[32&amp;#37; free float, not bad.](https://preview.redd.it/6gtg4fqfdn271.png?width=887&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=efa328f9a384b5fb5f4c0c88d656e81d83d2e4cf)\n\nThe last 3 months $OPEN dropped big, from $35 to $15.

        "selftext": "***This does not constitute stock advice.*** *I have done my best to do my research, but I am not a professional investor and will not take responsibility for losses.*\n\nHi. This is my first DD, feedback welcomed, but I've tried to take what I've learned from other DDs. \n\nI've tried writing other DDs, but I can never finish because it always feels like I'm trying to sell a loser, and not really contributing to the sub. This time it felt different, and I don't feel like a greedy scrub expecting everyone to be schmucks. Ultimately, please do your own research. ***Do not take my word for it, you are responsible for your own gains and losses after all.*** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**What does Acelarin do?**\n\nIn a nutshell, it's a more effective cancer treatment. It\u2019s based off current chemotherapy treatments, but it has an easier time delivering the anti cancer metabolites. This leads to higher concentrations of it in Tumor cells. I'm not a scientist, so you will need to go to their website to better understand this. Nucana.com\n\n**Notes about Acelarin:**\n\nIt's in a Phase III trial. \n\nIn its Phase I trial it achieved a whopping 217x higher intracellular level of dFdCTP(the anti cancer metabolite) than gemcitabine(the current standard).\n\nIt also stayed in the cells significantly longer. They report 139x greater intracellular AUC of dFdCTP. \n\n**The CEO:**\n\nHugh Griffith (Founder, CEO &amp; Board Member): \n\n28 years in biopharmaceuticals. Chief operating officer of a company bought by Genzyme, now Sanofi. Graduated honours. Inventor of 80 patents, 135 patents pending. Plus held senior positions at AbbVie and Pfizer.\n\n**Other drugs in pipeline:**\n\nI wont go to far into these as these are just icing for longer term potential. You're realistically investing in Acelerin at the moment. \n\nNUC-3373: In Phase 1. Cancer treatment intended to replace 5-FU\n\nNUC-7738 In Phase 1. Another cancer treament in pipeline.\n\nBoth have had results worth looking deeper into. But as I said, I'm currently investing in the potential of Acelerin.\n\n**PRICE:**\n\nAt a 5 year low. $2.93 is it's low point, it is currently 3.06 as I type this.\n\n**Analysts:**\n\n57% Strong Buy\n\n43% Buy\n\nHigh: $22.05, Average: 16.03, Low, 8.02\n\n**Institutions:**\n\nOn the high side. 78.75% ownership, increased 4.60%\n\n**Why is it so low?**\n\nThere was a big share dilution in sept 2020 is my best guess. \n\nCash: 78.6m with a net income of around -35 mil last year.\n\n**Bull Argument:**\n\nIn Phase 3 of a potential game changer for chemotherapy. Had good results in Phase 2.\n\nExcellent, proven leadership.\n\nOther drugs in pipeline are in the same wheelhouse as their current flagship drug Acelerin, so if Acelerin becomes a winner, you may have 2 more winners on your hands.\n\nCost is way down. Perhaps a 5 year low.\n\nHigh institutional ownership.\n\nHigh analyist ratings.\n\nI think that further dilution(if it happens) will easily be offset by general gains, because of the significant improvement it promises over current treatments.\n\nHuge market. 150 billion spent on cancer a year.\n\nVery little short interest.\n\nNot a meme stock, yet.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Bear Argument:**\n\nDiluted shares by around 50% recently.\n\nNo revenue yet\n\nMax 2 years of cash. May need to do share dilutions again.\n\nCancer treatment is a common market for bio companies. Lot of competition.\n\nIf Acelerin fails, the company will be in a really bad spot, with low cash on hand and no solid prospects.",

        "selftext": " We all like tendies, so from one ape to another, hear me out on this one as we are on the brink of this company's BIGGEST catalyst.   \n\n\n**Some context on the company and it\u2019s industries (Sports Media/Sports Betting):**\n\nTheScore mobile is the number 1 most used sports app in Canada with 10 times more users than ESPN. It\u2019s one of the most used sports mobile apps in all of North America citing almost 4 BILLION user sessions over the last year. They have industry leading rates of user engagement at an average of 130 minutes per visitor with each user opening the app an average of 125 times a month.\n\nThis engagement is due to the many features in the app including: real-time sports news, live scores, in-game highlights, a social ecosystem where fans can chat and discuss live games, add friends, send private messages, etc. They have original media content, in-game odds, sports betting content and even personalized promos for bettors based on their in-app media interests. They\u2019ve reported close to 4 million unique users per month.\n\nTheScore achieved this success despite being a small company against industry titans. They\u2019re no stranger to being an underdog which now follows them in the mobile sports betting industry. PASPA was repealed in 2018 allowing individual states to offer legalized, regulated sports betting. The North American opportunity for this industry is estimated to represent a $US 22 billion opportunity by 2025.\n\ntheScore made the decision in 2019 to enter the market as an operator in [NJ through a partnership with Darby Development](https://mobile.thescore.com/2019/09/introducing-thescore-bet-thescores-mobile-sportsbook-launches-in-new-jersey/) with their Score Bet app. They have since expanded operations to a total of 4 betting states (NJ, CO, IN, IO) and have acquired market access agreements across 14 states via a [partnership with Penn National](https://mobile.thescore.com/2019/07/thescore-and-penn-national-gaming-enter-into-strategic-multi-state-market-access-partnership/) and other market access deals ([CZR deal](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210329005427/en/theScore-Secures-Market-Access-for-Mobile-Sports-Betting-in-Illinois-Through-Agreement-with-Caesars-Entertainment)) which represent more than 30% of the U.S. population and a $US 8.2 billion opportunity for them. The CEO and founder, John Levy, has stated that by next year they will be operating in at least double the amount of states and that they\u2019ll be active in 35 States within 3 to 5 years.\n\nTheScore recently rebuilt their media app completely in-house to increase its performance, stability, and scalability, likely related to continued user growth and future betting integrations. They\u2019ve built their \u201cFuse\u201d and \u201cBet Section\u201d as a fully integrated approach to link their gaming and media apps. Users of both apps can now build their bet slip while benefiting from all of theScore\u2019s features. When they\u2019re ready to finalize their bet, they\u2019ll be taken to the [Score Bet app](https://www.thescore.bet/) to place their bet or cash out. This is a defining feature that their highly engaged userbase will remember and one that will lead to higher rates of retention vs competitors that treat the bet as just a transaction. This approach not only increases retention rates but also greatly reduces their customer acquisition costs in an industry that is renowned for not having brand loyalty.\n\nThe New Jersey handle (Percentage of the total amount of bets taken in the State) rose 195% versus the prior year, validating that their unique combination of media and betting remains a powerful differentiating factor against competitors in their oldest operating State. Total gaming handle also grew 46% overall compared to the previous quarter. They are the only media company to be operating their own book and they\u2019ve been seeing these early signs of success. Other companies have started to take notice as they\u2019ve been buying or partnering with media companies via expensive deals (ex: [DKNG 1](https://www.sportico.com/business/sports-betting/2021/draftkings-buys-vsin-1234625970/), [DKNG 2](https://www.draftkings.com/about/news/2020/09/draftkings-and-espn-enter-into-co-exclusive-content-integration-agreement/?wpsrc=Organic%20Search&amp;wpaffn=Google&amp;wpkw=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.draftkings.com%2Fabout%2Fnews%2F2020%2F09%2Fdraftkings-and-espn-enter-into-co-exclusive-content-integration-agreement%2F&amp;wpcn=about&amp;wpscn=news%2F2020%2F09%2Fdraftkings-and-espn-enter-into-co-exclusive-content-integration-agreement%2F), [PENN](https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/1/29/21113130/barstool-sports-penn-national-deal-dave-portnoy-chernin), [FOX](https://www.starsgroup.com/press-center/the-stars-group-news/the-stars-group-and-fox-sports-announce-historic-u-s-media-and-sports-wagering-partnership)). However, they have not been able to develop the same seamless approach that theScore has attained internally.\n\ntheScore is not the loudest nor the flashiest betting operator. You won\u2019t see Score ads like you do with some other companies because they\u2019re targeting their existing userbase in a way that is financially responsible. They aren't aiming to do flashy deals. They won\u2019t win by trying to outspend the big guys, but they already know this, as it\u2019s a situation that they've already been through. Instead they're growing their numbers organically with their customer focus.\n\n**So, what\u2019s this huge catalyst that I spoke of?**\n\nThe Legalization of Mobile Sports Betting in Canada, where theScore Media app is a household name will [likely take place](https://nationalpost.com/news/politics/here-are-the-liberal-bills-likely-to-pass-this-spring-and-others-that-could-be-doomed-by-an-election) within the next 3 weeks or earlier.\n\nLast week, bill C-218 passed its 2nd reading in the Senate, this is often where the biggest risk lies.\n\nTomorrow, it will be studied by a Standing Committee. After passing that stage it will then move to 3rd reading before becoming law.\n\nThe bill is supported by provincial bodies, [by every major sports league](https://www.gamblingnews.com/news/cga-major-sports-leagues-support-the-push-for-single-event-wagering/), and even sports broadcast companies as their viewership numbers continue to decline. It just so happens that the [Deputy Chair of the reviewing committee](https://sencanada.ca/en/senators/smith-larry-w/) also served as [Commissioner of the Canadian Football League (CFL)](https://www.tsn.ca/cfl/video/cfl-hopes-for-the-pass-of-bill-c-218-in-order-to-boost-future-revenue~2205144).\n\nThe opportunity presented by this bill passing is forecasted to be US$4 to US$5+ billion at maturity. TheScore is actively preparing for this opportunity and extremely well-positioned to benefit long-term as Canada\u2019s leading mobile sports media brand.\n\n10% penetration of the Canadian Market = $US 400 Million15% penetration of the Canadian Market = $US 625 Million20% penetration of the Canadian Market = $US 850 Million\n\nThe current market cap is valued at $US 843.647M which indicates that this legalization is not currently priced in, as it wouldn't take into consideration everything else that theScore has built. The stock\u2019s technicals have bottomed out and we can finally see that the trend is reversing. All of this, combined with SCR\u2019s low float will mean an explosive next few weeks.\n\n**Bonus info about eSports:**\n\n\\- Gen Z is half as likely as millennials to watch live sports and 2x more likely to never watch\n\n\\- 35% of Gen Z identify as eSports fans, a higher percentage than NASCAR, MLB and NHL\n\n\\- There\u2019s a potential for \\~6 million new bettors with an outsized affinity for eSports over the next five years\n\n\\- 495 million people watched eSports online or on television in 2020, worldwide and viewers are projected to grow to 646 million by 2023.\n\neSports betting will be one of the biggest categories of sports betting over the long term, if not the biggest. theScore eSports has the #1 esports media following with 186.5 million reported video views in their most recent quarter, which represents a 139% YoY growth and an average social media reach of 88 million a month. Guess who\u2019s actively seeking and preparing opportunities to enter this space?\n\n**TLDR:** APES &amp; DEGENERATES LIKE GAMBLING ON SPORTS AND ESPORTS. SCR, the #1 Canadian Sports Media app entered Sports Betting and is seeing encouraging results. They\u2019re also the leading eSports media brand and are actively seeking to enter esports betting which will eventually become one of the biggest betting categories. Legalization of Canadian Sports betting in the next weeks + US Sports betting expansion means that this company is extremely undervalued for its future potential in a $US 22 Billion industry. \ud83d\ude80",

Share-price declines and a ticking clock to take companies public are ratcheting up the pressure.\n\nThe new challenges for creators of special-purpose acquisition companies, or SPACs, result in part from the abundance of the deals that raised money early in 2021. Looming over these firms is a two-year deadline to do a deal or hand back cash to investors. \n\nNow that shares of many SPAC-related companies have fallen, fewer startups are interested in going public through a SPAC. That mismatch is intensifying competition between some blank-check firms for the same private firms, known by some on Wall Street as a \u201cSPAC-off.\u201d\n\nSPACs are shell companies that raise money and list on an exchange with the sole intent of merging with a private firm to take it public. The private company, often a startup, then gets the SPAC\u2019s place in the stock market. Blank-check mergers let companies going public make future business projections\u2014which aren\u2019t allowed in regular IPOs\u2014one reason they took Wall Street by storm this winter and have raised a record $105 billion this year, according to SPAC Research. \n\nBut with SPAC shares in retreat, many blank-check firms now trade below their debut price. Many companies in recent months have said that several different SPACs have asked them about mergers, a trend that contributed to the frenzy in the sector.\n\nThe pressure to execute deals at realistic valuations could get even more intense in the months ahead because nearly 260 blank-check companies with about $87 billion on hand face merger deadlines in the first three months of 2023, according to a Methuselah Advisors analysis of SPAC Research figures. \n\nWhile such deadlines can be extended, they can pressure SPAC teams that often need several months to finish deals and now face turbulent market conditions.\u00a0\n\n\u201cThere is an awful lot of capital sitting there that has to find a home,\u201d said John Chachas, co-managing principal at Methuselah, a boutique investment bank. \u201cYou\u2019re going to see a fair number of less-than-desirable deals done just because they have to get done.\u201d\n\nPrivate companies open to SPAC mergers should focus on their business, then begin exploring blank-check options next year, Mr. Chachas said. By then, many SPAC teams could be desperate to finish deals before their deadlines and make generous offers.\u00a0\n\nWith investors retreating in recent weeks from early-stage investments, shares of many companies tied to SPACs\u2014including those taking genetic-testing firm 23andMe Inc., electric-vehicle battery maker Microvast Inc. and flying-taxi startup Joby Aviation public\u2014have fallen about 30% or more since mid-February.  \n\nSigns that regulators are taking a stricter stance on the once-hot sector also have pressured the stocks. Regulatory questions have slowed the timeline for finishing mergers and cut new issuance of blank-check companies to a fraction of the record levels from earlier this year. Just two of the 23 SPACs that announced deals in May are trading above their initial public offering price, figures from data provider SPAC Research show.  \n\nIf no deal is done by the final date\u2014after any extensions\u2014the SPAC creators have to return money to investors and lose what they put in up front to create the shell companies, typically several million dollars for underwriting fees and other expenses. In that scenario, they also don\u2019t get the deeply discounted shares that let them make several times their initial investment, on average.\n\nThose incentives explain why many blank-check mergers will still get done in the months ahead\u2014even if they are completed at lower valuations or the SPAC teams have to give away some of the discounted shares to complete the deals. \n\nBecause of the market reversal, some analysts now expect private companies and investors in SPAC mergers to have more leverage when negotiating deal terms with blank-check firms. The shift shows how many on Wall Street and in Silicon Valley are grappling with the unprecedented market environment created by SPACs, which were a rarely used alternative to traditional initial public offerings before late 2020 and are now evolving quickly. \n\n\u201cPeople are getting a lot more choosy,\u201d said Kristi Marvin, founder of data and research provider SPACInsider.\n\nMany investors say smaller SPACs will likely face the most pressure, while the most well known backers such as venture capitalist Chamath Palihapitiya continue to churn out deals.\n\nBecause investors can typically withdraw at that low IPO price per share, plus a tiny bit of interest, before SPAC mergers are completed, low share prices mean many are likely to do so to eliminate the possibility of taking a loss. That can leave the SPAC with much less money, potentially forcing executives to find other sources of cash or renegotiate some terms of the deal.\n\n\u201cThey are going to have to be more careful with what the valuation is and what they are agreeing to,\u201d said Patrick Galley, a SPAC investor and CEO of RiverNorth Capital Management.\n\nInvestors who put money into SPAC mergers through a fundraising round called a private investment in public equity, or PIPE, could particularly benefit. Large PIPE investors include funds managed by asset management giants BlackRock Inc. and Fidelity Investments Inc. Their money is critical to deals and is added to the cash held by the blank-check company to complete a merger several times as large as the SPAC itself. \n\nIn one sign that PIPE investors could now get better terms, mobile entertainment firm Jam City recently said PIPE investors bought into the company at $8.42 a share in its roughly $1.2 billion SPAC merger, including debt. That is a discounted price unavailable to other investors. \n\nStill, some analysts say momentum in the market could quickly change once again, particularly if some strong deals draw investors back into the space.  \n\n\u201cThree months from now, the market could look very different,\u201d Ms. Marvin said. \u201cIt could be game on again.\u201d",

No it would not be wiser to wait for everything to settle before buying more theaters. If they did that. Others wood then recognize the opportunity as well. Which would potentially result in others purchasing the theater chains. Or it would result in a bidding war over the purchase of that chain. Thus increasing the price to be paid.

        "selftext": " Recent IPO for Alfi (ALF) Providing AI Assisted Brand Building and a Marketing SaaS Platform for the Internet and Out of Home Applications  \n   \n**The technology to help brands grow will always be in-demand. This tiny float, newly NASDAQ listed stock could be our next runner.**  \n   \nGood day everyone,  \n   \nWe are initiating coverage of\u00a0**Alfi, Inc. (NASDAQ: ALF),**\u00a0a provider of interactive intelligent artificial intelligence and machine learning software solutions.  \n   \nCurrent price\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 $2.83/share  \nOutstanding (est.)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 12.36M shares  \n**Float (est.)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 3.83M shares**  \n   \nALF\u00a0[closed on its IPO](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/alfi-inc-announces-closing-initial-163500986.html)\u00a0and began trading on the NASDAQ May 4, 2021. The IPO consisted of 3,731,344 common shares and warrants. The common shares were sold at $4.15 each and the warrants are exercisable at $4.57 each for up to five years.  \n   \nALF shares are trading at a 49% discount from the IPO price. While it\u2019s not unusual for IPO shares to contract after the event, there usually comes an inflection point where the shares begin to gain. We believe ALF shares have reached that point and with a tiny float, these shares could move quickly.  \n   \n**The scope of the AI driven Alfi SaaS product is awe inspiring and may have you saying, \u201cwhat the heck? I didn\u2019t even know that was possible.\u201d**  \n   \nAlfi is developing an AI enterprise SaaS platform powering computer vision with machine learning models, and deep learning to deliver the right content, to the right person at the right time. When a consumer interacts with an ALFI Tablet, Kiosk, or internet content, the software begins a sophisticated AI assisted data capture. The digital device then displays content/advertising relevant to its analysis of the viewer.  \n   \nThe company has provided a\u00a0[brief overview video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7XTQqUEN2U)\u00a0of the firm's SaaS platform. This video may be a critical part of your due diligence.  \n   \nDigital advertising isn\u2019t new, but Digital out of Home (DOOH) advertising, utilizing AI to generate and report data from consumer interactions is still in its infancy. This niche in advertising is where ALF lives right now.  \n   \nThe market for tracking and reporting on DOOH advertising activity is expected to grow at a double-digit CAGR through 2023. Imagine getting into a taxi or a ride share vehicle and there\u2019s an interactive pad on the back of the headrest or going to a mall and interacting with kiosk. This kind of technology will become ubiquitous in the near term, and ALF is one of the leaders and innovators in the sector.  \n   \n**The overall market for digital advertising is $614 billion.**  \n   \nAlf is already reporting positive results in more than 12 separate pilot programs deploying over 1,000 devices and expects to start generating revenues in Q2 and be profitable by Q421. The company plans to have tablets installed in 100,000 ride share vehicles within 4-5 years.  \n   \nThese are the applications ALF wants to deploy both to brands and to businesses to generate revenues:  \n   \nAirports and Malls \u2013 Kiosks  \nTaxis and Rideshares \u2013 Tablets  \nEnterprise Software \u2013 SaaS  \nData Analytics \u2013 Subscriptions  \n   \nAlfi plans to woo ride share drivers and taxis and others with participation in the revenues generated by placing a tablet in their vehicles or locations.  \n   \nUnderstanding the sophistication of the Alfi software may best be understood by their disclaimer statements:  \n   \nALF is compliant with all GDPR, CCPA, and HIPAA standards. Alfi\u2019s proprietary Ai algorithm understands small facial cues and perceptual details. The automation works in a way that respects user privacy; without tracking, storing cookies, or using identifiable personal information. The company states it will not store facial images.  \n   \nWe look at ALF as a rare opportunity to get involved in a new IPO with the technology of the future, a future that is starting right now. There may be the potential for a triple digit increase in value here.  \n   \nStay tuned for our full report on ALF.  \n[Disclaimer](https://mailchi.mp/tradersnewssource/recent-ipo-providing-ai-assisted-brand-building?e=[UNIQID])\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Catch me if you can!](https://preview.redd.it/6agncoisqn271.jpg?width=203&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=40ecbc53ac8b28d3596f164085001d6c2fd877cd)",

        "selftext": " \n\n80% in own of retail investors Currently,\n\nall real stocks (not naked shorts) are counted, and on June 2nd you will know how many naked shorts are in roughly real terms.\n\nRumor has it in the US that it should be between 1 and 2 billion pieces, which would be an empty catastrophe for the hedge funds. If the retail traders keep buying and do not let themselves be unsettled by the massive \"negative\" interference from media such as CNBC, Motley Fool, Fox News as well as moderators such as Jim Cramer or hedge fund manager Rich Greenfield and hold their shares (HODL) , it is possible that the share, as in the VW Shortqueeze 2008 ($ 1,000 per share), will also skyrocket. This is because the hedgies have to cover their short positions.\n\n!!The longer the retail traders hold their shares instead of selling them during the squeeze, the higher the price can rise. At Reddit, where the \"Apes\" exchange ideas, the mood was such that a few months ago they spoke of a possible floor of $ 1,000.!! ((this floor is rly possibre? xD))\n\nDue to the many phenomenal reports from brilliant analysts in the forum, there is now talk of a floor of 10,000 or even 100,000 dollars per share.\n\nThis all sounds completely crazy, but it is not impossible if the investors do not sell too early during a short squeeze. This is exactly what the Hedgies in the USA are terrified of. For a few weeks now, bots have been flooding in, which are intended to unsettle investors and encourage them to sell - via Reddit, Twitter and Youtube.\n\nHardly ever seen on this scale. The trouble is that this doesn't work because the community sticks together so well that the numerous \"ladder attacks\" have no consequences. Now the SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) comes into play with its new chairman, Gary Gensler, who had closely observed the game stop process and is now introducing the first changes to the rules of the game for the hedgies, which are supposed to make shorting a lot more difficult . At the recent conference hearing, Gensler mentioned that he wanted to create more fairness and transparency for small investors.\n\nThis is roughly the opposite of what the hedge funds want.\n\nCopied from [https://insideparadeplatz.ch/](https://insideparadeplatz.ch/)",

I know Forbes hasn't always been on our apes side for the GME battle and AMC war but they seem to contradicting what is currently going on in EV charging! \n\n[https://www.forbes.com/sites/neilwinton/2021/03/09/electric-cars-are-coming-and-if-you-dont-like-it-tough/?sh=6f8be1c5698f](https://www.forbes.com/sites/neilwinton/2021/03/09/electric-cars-are-coming-and-if-you-dont-like-it-tough/?sh=6f8be1c5698f) \n\n*\u201cWith the prospect of sticker price parity even without subsidies by  2025, we take a strong positive view on EV penetration. We raise our  global EV sales forecasts again, this time mainly driven by higher  estimates for the U.S. market. We expect the Biden administration to  increase direct support for EV purchases,\u201d the UBS report said.*\n\n*The Biden plan for 500,000 charging stations would more than double  the current count, while it could impose tougher fuel economy standards  to curb ICE car sales. The ban on ICE sales by governments like  Britain\u2019s will also give a powerful signal to buyers to embrace  electric. .\"*\n\n They also out shot analyst expectations for revenue for the previous quarter see below.\n\n## Blink Charging (NASDAQ:BLNK) Earnings Information\n\nBlink  Charging last announced its quarterly earnings data on May 12th, 2021.  The reported ($0.18) EPS for the quarter, missing analysts' consensus  estimates of ($0.17) by $0.01. **The company had revenue of $2.23 million  for the quarter, compared to analysts' expectations of $1.71 million.**  Blink Charging has generated ($0.59) earnings per share over the last  year. Blink Charging has not formally confirmed its next earnings  publication date, but the company's estimated earnings date is Thursday,  August 12th, 2021 based off prior year's report dates.\n\nSo in ending for now I cant help but wonder what the hell is going on in the EV charging scene. With all this talk about the future Being EV, Biden backing the electric F150 and international markets across the scene being so bullish. How can one stock like BLNK be so heavily shorted. I would love to know how many Naked shorts have been placed against a company like this. \n\nI'm No financial advisor nor am I calling for people to load up on BLNK to squeeze the hell out of these hedge funds and their short positions. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJust want to see if anyone else can give better insight than me on why this stock is so heavily shorted.",

I am particularly excited that we can achieve this result even before we include the carbon offset potential from our waste rock and tailings which we expect to allow us to produce NetZero NickelTM, NetZero CobaltTM, and NetZero IronTM. These results reflect the mine's low strip ratio and our ability to utilize the low carbon hydroelectricity in the region and by using trolley trucks and electric shovels to reduce the consumption of diesel fuel.\"*\n\n**Short-term Catalysts**\n\n* Drilling on the Crawford extensions as assay backlogs finally begin to clear;\n* First results from exploration targets at MacDiarmid (geophysical target bigger than the original Crawford discovery);\n* The Company's wholly-owned subsidiary NetZero Metals Inc. will begin negotiations with potential partners immediately following the release of the PEA;\n* Discussions with various supply chain participants in the EV supply chain are expected to accelerate now with the completion of the PEA.\n\n**Long-term catalysts**\n\n* Feasibility Study by mid-year 2022\n\n*Disclaimer: I've been long Canada Nickel Company since March, 2019 with no intension of selling short-term.

        "selftext": "Hello community,  \n\n\nEnlivex Therapeutics (ENLV) is a Israeli pharmaceutical company that is targeting the Sepsis market (33B of untapped potential). They have been developing the drug since 2019 and it turned that the pandemic was the perfect storm for them. Because COVID-19, governments were willing to give emergency approval to drugs that were able to help COVID patients. Well, Enlivex's drug Allocetra, which delivers immune rebalancing therapy, turns out to also aid critical patients that have COVID-19. The company has received patients from three of the biggest Sepsis markets (US,Japan, and today Canada) while simultaneously (and silently) partnering with Brazil, India, and the UK for Enlivex clinical trials. Their past trials got amazing grades and I believe that this is the beginning of a long and amazing rollercoaster ride.  \n[https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/enlv](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/enlv)  \n\n\nYour Welcome Boys.  \nNOW FEAST!",

        "selftext": "Pembina Pipeline Corp. has struck a  friendly deal to acquire Inter Pipeline Ltd. for $8.3 billion in an  all-share deal after the midstream company was put in play earlier this  year.\n\nUnder the terms of the deal, shareholders of Inter Pipeline will  receive half a share of Pembina for each share held, valuing the deal at  $19.45 per share based on the most recent closing price. That trumps  the unsolicited $16.50 offer from Brookfield Infrastructure Partners LP  that Inter Pipeline rebuffed earlier this year. According to the release  issued Tuesday, Pembina\u2019s executive team will lead the combined entity,  while Inter Pipeline will have representation on the board of  directors.\n\nInter Pipeline Chair Margaret McKenzie said the deal with Pembina  represented the best value for shareholders after the company launched a  strategic review in February.\n\n\u201cIt was evident that a combination with Pembina offered compelling  value for Inter Pipeline shareholders in the short-term, as well as the  opportunity to participate in the upside of \\[the Heartland Petrochemical  Complex\\] and the combined business longer-term,\u201d she said in the  release.\n\n\u201cThe creation of a more highly integrated business across the energy  infrastructure value chain results in a combined entity that is greater  than the sum of its parts.\u201d\n\nThat Heartland Petrochemical Complex has been key to Inter Pipeline\u2019s  path forward, with the project outside Edmonton slated to produce  525,000 tonnes of polypropylene per year upon completion. However, it  has been dogged by contruction delays and cost overruns, and is now  expected to commence production in early 2022.\n\nThe two companies said their friendly transaction is expected to  close in the fourth quarter of this year, pending all necessary  approvals.\n\n[https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/pembina-strikes-8-3b-all-stock-deal-for-inter-pipeline-1.1611131](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/pembina-strikes-8-3b-all-stock-deal-for-inter-pipeline-1.1611131)",

        "selftext": "Analysis on AMC:\n\nI will probably get downvoted for this, however I still feel the need to write this as most people here dont understand what is really going on with AMC and most of the DD that I have seen are basically just hype train or regurgitated information they got from a youtube or a reddit post, who also got their information this way, creating a cycle of misleading analysis .  \n\n1.  AMC is not a short squeeze but a gamma squeeze.  You can tell easily who has option experience and who is brand new to the scene, just from this statement alone.  A gamma squeeze is triggered when there are so alot of call options being bought, which forces the market makers to hedge by buying shares of amc.  Which then moves the price of the stock up.  However once the stock price reaches a certain price, market makers do not have to hedge by buying the stock as they now have enough shares.  What they normally do at this point is to sell more call optoins using a covered call.  A covered call is when you sell option contracts using the shares you have.  This basically means that market makers are not losing money, but in fact making bank.  A covered call is basically a hack, where you short delta, but you come out ahead financially, unless the stock price moves below where you bought it from, minus the premiums you collected.  The other critical point regarding market makers and gamma squeezes, is that once the Iv spikes, they can sell very very far otm call options and DO NOT HAVE TO HEDGE.  As those OTM (out of the money) options becoming ITM (in the money) are basically mathmaticlaly so low, market makers will not hedge those $60 strike call options.  No matter how many you buy.\n2. Wall street is not losing money on AMC as many of you seem to think.  Some of the hedge funds who shorted early will temporarilly lose money on UNREALISED GAINS.  This is not the same thing as taking actual losses.  There is a huge difference between the two.\n3. Most of the shorts came in at much higher strike prices (most shorted from $18-$20 back in march).  The same as most of you probably came in at the higher stock price and not the $2 it was trading at.  The new shorts are also shorting from a higher level due to the run up and the old shorts can cost average thier short position. Cost average is when you buy a stock at either a higher or lower price to average down your cost.\n4. AMC is different then GME.  AMC has a much bigger float and the chance of a short squeeze is much lower compared to GME. GME you could logically make a case for it due to the smaller float size and also new leadership turning GME into a winner.\n5. The media reports what will get it clicks and views.  The same as youtube.  Which is why they are running with headlines such as \"AMC short sellers dealt massive 1.2 billion dollar losses\".  Most youtubers, including the stock market channels do not have much experience or knowledge.  There are some very legit ones, but most of the channels are trash.  The blind leading the blind.\n6. On a fundamentals perspective AMC is not worth more then $2-$5 dollars, even with the re-opening.  AMC was managed poorly and in bad financial shape PRE PANDEMIC.  Now those financial are even worse as they are still liable for the debt from leases.  Which also brings me to another point.  AMC does not own most of thier locations.  Which means they dont even have any assets of value besides the brand \"AMC\".\n7. The value of AMC will be tied to what another buyer is willing to pay for AMC.  As long as the hype train is there, you can find a buyer, but the last guys holding the bag will be looking at a long career behind wendy's giving blowjobs and not as a side hustle to invest more into amc. If you are new, this is known as a pump and dump.  This is not something new to the stock market.  It has been going on for decades.  Normally this is done on low float stocks such as penny stocks. \n\nThis is a long read, but I hope you got the hard truth about AMC.  Im not saying dont invest in amc, all im saying is know the truth before making any plays.  BTW for full disclosure.  I do make plays on AMC and other meme stocks on the call side. So I've definitley made money playing amc and other meme stocks but I also locked in my gains and only make plays when its breaking resistance or have big buy volume comming in for a momentum play.",

        "selftext": " We all like tendies, so from one ape to another, hear me out on this one. On the brink of this company\u2019s BIGGEST catalyst, you have a unique opportunity to invest in SCR while it\u2019s at a 38% discount from its IPO price and a 46% discount from it\u2019s 52-week high on the NASDAQ. All of which will be a small fraction of what this stock can be worth in the future.\n\n**But first, here\u2019s some context on the company and it\u2019s industries (Sports Media/Sports Betting):**\n\nTheScore mobile is the number 1 most used sports app in Canada with 10 times more users than ESPN. It\u2019s one of the most used sports mobile apps in all of North America citing almost 4 BILLION user sessions over the last year. They have industry leading rates of user engagement at an average of 130 minutes per visitor with each user opening the app an average of 125 times a month.   \n \n\nThis engagement is due to the many features in the app including: real-time sports news, live scores, in-game highlights, a social ecosystem where fans can chat and discuss live games, add friends, send private messages, etc. They have original media content, in-game odds, sports betting content and even personalized promos for bettors based on their in-app media interests. They\u2019ve reported close to 4 million unique users per month. \n\nTheScore achieved this success despite being a small company against industry titans. They\u2019re no stranger to being an underdog which now follows them in the mobile sports betting industry. PASPA was repealed in 2018 allowing individual states to offer legalized, regulated sports betting. The North American opportunity for this industry is estimated to represent a $US 22 billion opportunity by 2025.\n\ntheScore made the decision in 2019 to enter the market as an operator in [NJ through a partnership with Darby Development](https://mobile.thescore.com/2019/09/introducing-thescore-bet-thescores-mobile-sportsbook-launches-in-new-jersey/) with their Score Bet app. They have since expanded operations to a total of 4 betting states (NJ, CO, IN, IO) and have acquired market access agreements across 14 states via a [partnership with Penn National](https://mobile.thescore.com/2019/07/thescore-and-penn-national-gaming-enter-into-strategic-multi-state-market-access-partnership/) and other market access deals ([CZR deal](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210329005427/en/theScore-Secures-Market-Access-for-Mobile-Sports-Betting-in-Illinois-Through-Agreement-with-Caesars-Entertainment)) which represent more than 30% of the U.S. population and a $US 8.2 billion opportunity for them. The CEO and founder, John Levy, has stated that by next year they will be operating in at least double the amount of states and that they\u2019ll be active in 35 States within 3 to 5 years.\n\nTheScore recently rebuilt their media app completely in-house to increase its performance, stability, and scalability, likely related to continued user growth and future betting integrations. They\u2019ve built their \u201cFuse\u201d and \u201cBet Section\u201d as a fully integrated approach to link their gaming and media apps. Users of both apps can now build their bet slip while benefiting from all of theScore\u2019s features. When they\u2019re ready to finalize their bet, they\u2019ll be taken to the [Score Bet app](https://www.thescore.bet/) to place their bet or cash out. This is a defining feature that their highly engaged userbase will remember and one that will lead to higher rates of retention vs competitors that treat the bet as just a transaction. This approach greatly reduces their customer acquisition costs, while increasing bettor retention rates in an industry that is renowned for not having user loyalty. \n\nThe New Jersey handle (Percentage of the total amount of bets taken in the State) rose 195% versus the prior year, validating that their unique combination of media and betting remains a powerful differentiating factor against competitors in their oldest operating State. Total gaming handle also grew 46% overall compared to the previous quarter. They are the only media company to be operating their own book and they\u2019ve been seeing these early signs of success. Other companies have started to take notice as they\u2019ve been buying or partnering with media companies via expensive deals (ex: [DKNG 1](https://www.sportico.com/business/sports-betting/2021/draftkings-buys-vsin-1234625970/), [DKNG 2](https://www.draftkings.com/about/news/2020/09/draftkings-and-espn-enter-into-co-exclusive-content-integration-agreement/?wpsrc=Organic%20Search&amp;wpaffn=Google&amp;wpkw=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.draftkings.com%2Fabout%2Fnews%2F2020%2F09%2Fdraftkings-and-espn-enter-into-co-exclusive-content-integration-agreement%2F&amp;wpcn=about&amp;wpscn=news%2F2020%2F09%2Fdraftkings-and-espn-enter-into-co-exclusive-content-integration-agreement%2F), [PENN](https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/1/29/21113130/barstool-sports-penn-national-deal-dave-portnoy-chernin), [FOX](https://www.starsgroup.com/press-center/the-stars-group-news/the-stars-group-and-fox-sports-announce-historic-u-s-media-and-sports-wagering-partnership)). However, they have not been able to develop the same seamless approach that theScore has attained internally.\n\ntheScore is not the loudest nor the flashiest betting operator. You won\u2019t see Score ads like you do with some other companies because they\u2019re targeting their existing userbase in a way that is financially responsible. They aren't aiming to do flashy deals. They won\u2019t win by trying to outspend the big guys, but they already know this, as it\u2019s a situation that they've already been through. Instead they're growing their numbers organically with their customer focus.\n\n**So, what\u2019s this huge catalyst that I spoke of?** \n\nThe Legalization of Mobile Sports Betting in Canada, where theScore Media app is a household name will [likely take place](https://nationalpost.com/news/politics/here-are-the-liberal-bills-likely-to-pass-this-spring-and-others-that-could-be-doomed-by-an-election) within the next 3 weeks or earlier. \n\nLast week, bill C-218 passed its 2nd reading in the Senate, this is often where the biggest risk lies.   \n\n\nTomorrow, it will be studied by a Standing Committee. After passing that stage it will then move to 3rd reading before becoming law.  \n \n\nThe bill is supported by provincial bodies, [by every major sports league](https://www.gamblingnews.com/news/cga-major-sports-leagues-support-the-push-for-single-event-wagering/), and even sports broadcast companies as their viewership numbers continue to decline. It just so happens that the [Deputy Chair of the reviewing committee](https://sencanada.ca/en/senators/smith-larry-w/) also served as [Commissioner of the Canadian Football League (CFL)](https://www.tsn.ca/cfl/video/cfl-hopes-for-the-pass-of-bill-c-218-in-order-to-boost-future-revenue~2205144). \n\nThe opportunity presented by this bill passing is forecasted to be US$4 to US$5+ billion at maturity. TheScore is actively preparing for this opportunity and extremely well-positioned to benefit long-term as Canada\u2019s leading mobile sports media brand.   \n \n\n10% penetration of the Canadian Market = $US 400 Million  \n 15% penetration of the Canadian Market = $US 625 Million  \n 20% penetration of the Canadian Market = $US 850 Million\n\nThe current market cap is valued at $US 843.647M which indicates that this legalization is not currently priced in, as it wouldn't take into consideration everything else that theScore has built. The stock\u2019s technicals have bottomed out and we can finally see that the trend is reversing. All of this, combined with SCR\u2019s low float will mean an explosive next few weeks.\n\n**Bonus info about eSports:**\n\n\\- Gen Z is half as likely as millennials to watch live sports and 2x more likely to never watch\n\n\\- 35% of Gen Z identify as eSports fans, a higher percentage than NASCAR, MLB and NHL\n\n\\- There\u2019s a potential for \\~6 million new bettors with an outsized affinity for eSports over the next five years\n\n\\- 495 million people watched eSports online or on television in 2020, worldwide and viewers are projected to grow to 646 million by 2023.  \n \n\neSports betting will be one of the biggest categories of sports betting over the long term, if not the biggest. theScore eSports has the #1 esports media following with 186.5 million reported video views in their most recent quarter, which represents a 139% YoY growth and an average social media reach of 88 million a month. Guess who\u2019s actively seeking and preparing opportunities to enter this space?\n\n**TLDR:** APES LIKE GAMBLING ON SPORTS AND ESPORTS**.** SCR, the #1 Canadian Sports Media app entered Sports Betting and is seeing encouraging results. They\u2019re also the leading eSports media brand and are actively seeking to enter esports betting which will eventually become one of the biggest betting categories. Legalization of Canadian Sports betting in the next weeks + US Sports betting expansion means that this company is extremely undervalued for its future potential in a $US 22 Billion industry. \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80",

        "selftext": "Hey all, doing a bit more brainstorming on income ideas. I noticed some fairly large spreads on deep ITM verticals. This example isn't too deep in the money, but illustrates the point. This an $NVDA JUN 4 680/690p spread. Assuming it was bought at or about mid it would be about $8. Assuming that $NVDA is at or below $680 shortly before close (or when assigned) we should be able to execute the long leg and receive $10. This would give us a $2 profit on what we paid. \n\nThat sounds all well and good, but I did some backtesting with this idea. The curious part comes one expiration day when the spread is extremely further ITM or the short leg is slightly ITM. The pricing in the former you'd actually get much more than the cost-the difference in the spreads and the latter much less. Lack of sleep and these funny cigarettes is making me miss as to why.\n\nAnyone have info? Am I missing something big here? Experiences in cash flowing this way? Thanks again!",
