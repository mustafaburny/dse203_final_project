        "selftext": "**TL;DR**: Secureworks, $SCWX, a managed cloud and software cybersecurity provider is set to pop hard.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. **COVID has been hugely bullish for cybersecurity** with growth and earnings beats across the industry. But SCWX is lagging behind other cybersec firms in recovery--**down 20% pre-Rona where similar cybersec firms are up 20-50%.**\n2. **Announced a partnership program** last week to license their software to other companies to provide managed security. Tells me **a)** they\u2019re so **damn busy with new customers** transitioning to WFH networks they need to outsource the work, **b)** SCWX **should be priced for growth** whereas they were previously the \u201cvalue\u201d play within cybersecurity.\n3. Insiders insanely bullish in April. **CEO nearly doubled his shares**\n4. High short interest and low float will make them run hard once they start moving up. **Short squeeze likely.**\n\n**SCWX 17.50c 7/17**, then sell just before or after June 4th earnings report. Other plays in write up. Start off with a limit order at 20 cents and raise from there if no fill.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*I originally posted about SCWX a week ago and they've popped up \\~15% since then*. I\u2019m feeling even more bullish on them now after they announced their partnership news. I deleted the [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gkd9ax/missed_net_and_okta_heres_an_easy_2_to_10_bagger/fqqfimg/)\u00a0after some big retards must have thrown a market order at these options and more than doubled the price in 15 minutes. Please use limit orders to buy in cheaply.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Company basics\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n|Market cap|$1.06 billion|\n|:-|:-|\n|Price at close yesterday [(Marketwatch)](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/scwx)|$13.28|\n|ATH|$23.11, Jan 2019|\n|Core product|Managed cloud network security|\n|Customers|Include 23% of Fortune 500, 25% of total customers are international|\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t3631diai9151.png?width=3128&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cab3357ac96e38a5fbf5890787250e8c63e0e1ad\n\nLet's hear what they do straight from their [**latest 10-K filing**](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1468666/000146866620000019/scwx10-kfy2020x01312020.htm):\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;We are a leading global provider of technology-driven information security solutions singularly focused on protecting our customers from cyber attacks. We combine deep experience from service to thousands of customers, machine learning and automation from our proprietary technology, and actionable insights from our team of elite researchers, analysts, and consultants to create a powerful network effect that provides increasingly strong protection for our customers. By aggregating and analyzing data from various sources around the world, we prevent security breaches, detect malicious activity in real time, respond rapidly and predict emerging threats.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Our vision is to be the essential cybersecurity company for a digitally connected world. Through our vendor-neutral approach, **we create integrated and comprehensive solutions by proactively managing the collection of \u201cpoint\u201d products deployed by our customers to address specific security issues and provide supplemental solutions where gaps exist in our customers\u2019 defenses**. We seek to provide the right level of security for each customer's unique situation, which evolves as the customer's organization grows and changes.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;We have pioneered an integrated approach that delivers a broad portfolio of information security solutions to organizations of varying size and complexity. Our flexible and scalable solutions support the evolving needs of the largest, most sophisticated enterprises staffed with in-house security experts, as well as small and medium-sized businesses and government agencies with limited in-house capabilities and resources.\n\nThe two keys here are **managed** and **portfolio**.\n\nUnlike most of their competition, **SCWX manages the security software they sell**. As part of the subscription price of the software, you pay for a SCWX security professional to monitor your suspicious logs in real time and investigate/communicate when they see a pattern consistent with an attack. Customers can also pay retainers for responses to potential breaches, so that when an attack is detected a team of SCWX professionals on standby will try to quickly shut the attack down and determine the extent of the damage. Along with managed security, they sell training, consultation, and testing for a company's security network. Additionally, SCWX has recently launched a SaaS platform that allows customers to use their software without purchasing management solutions which will help them grow even more among more price-sensitive and tech-savvy segments.\n\n**Managed security should be even more bullish than unmanaged security during this pandemic**. Companies that could manage their own security (i.e. tech and very large) already do and only needed to secure more devices. Whereas companies/government agencies/educational institutions that aren't capable of fielding a team of cybersecurity experts have suddenly found themselves in need of network security for their work from home (WFH) staff and the websites that drive 100% of their present income. These groups now suddenly need to pay someone to set up and manage cybersecurity that they were unprepared to manage themselves. In the past few years analysts have been less bullish on managed security companies for two reasons: higher costs (i.e. staff) and less growth potential (can't just add more servers and run the same code base). I think the pandemic changes some of that however, because SCWX has the badly needed security professionals which are in short supply.\n\nSecurity should never be thought of as a collection of individual tasks/actions, but as a **system**, because any one vulnerability can fuck up everything. Unlike competitors that focus on apps for solving particular problems, SCWX offers a comprehensive security solution. They offer suspicious activity detection and response, network security, endpoint security, malware/spyware detection and response, log management, firewall management, and other security features. Having an ecosystem of products helps them to tailor solutions to protect their clients from any of the variety of threats that they may face. If you've read Black Swan/Antifragile, then you know that antifragility comes from systems thinking and managing your environment holistically.\n\n[SCWX provides holistic cybersecurity](https://preview.redd.it/v480m6fgh9151.png?width=3132&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=53e29093850fbecb4926db1dd5f3b42696a7ccc4)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Peers: software and cloud cybersecurity firms are hitting new all time highs\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lqvhjizuh9151.png?width=1414&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a200cb667129443736ddf37bb1af97edfd1886ff\n\n**SCWX should be trading at February prices at a minimum. Cybersecurity is hot right now**. Amid the international distrust of pandemic, there have been many hacking attempts targeting new work-from-home networks, hospitals, biotechs, educational institutions, and government systems.\n\n[At least 28 US hospitals have been hacked this year.](https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/cybersecurity/28-health-system-cyberattacks-data-breaches-so-far-in-2020.html)\n\n[Foreign nations have been attacking government and healthcare infrastructure.](https://www.cityam.com/rival-states-launch-cyber-attacks-on-uk-and-us-coronavirus-labs/)\n\n[Foreign countries have been trying to steal data from companies working on cures.](https://www.newsweek.com/report-accuses-iran-attack-drug-company-coronavirus-1502838)\n\nAdditionally, SCWX has partnerships with CRWD and QLYS for endpoint security and vulnerability management respectively and it should be participating more heavily in their upside.\n\nNET, AKAM, and QLYS have all reported earnings in the last month. Their share prices spiked 10% in the week before their respective reports. They beat earnings slightly and then dumped off most of the gains to recover them a week or two later. Given both the trend of cybersecurity earnings beats and SCWX's own steady growth, **I think a massive earnings beat is likely compared to the analysts' low expectations.**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qnjjgdxfk9151.png?width=658&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=09c1f4917d6a647c37ca4e1c99c8507cbece6648\n\nUnlike it's competitors, **SCWX is priced cheaply** compared to their assets, at 7.5x cheaper than the median of the sample below. Even if you only want to buy shares, SCWX is a fantastic deal for picking up cloud cybersecurity assets compared to it's peer group.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n|Ticker|Price to book value|\n|:-|:-|\n|**SCWX**|**1.63**|\n|NET|12.04|\n|OKTA|55.07|\n|CRWD|21.96|\n|QLYS|11.86|\n|AKAM|4.41|\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Partnership program announcement\n\n[Article.](https://www.marketwatch.com/press-release/secureworks-launches-new-global-partner-program-to-address-growing-demand-for-cybersecurity-solutions-2020-05-21?mod=mw_quote_news) Last week, SCWX announced a program so that other companies can license their software to build and sell managed security solutions. While their price jumped nearly 10% after the announcement, I don't think the implications have been fully realized.\n\n1. Against the common criticism of managed security as low growth, **SCWX is now poised for massive expansion**. Now other companies can target niche markets (region, sector, pricing, government, etc), while SCWX can focus on their core competencies. Letting specialized security companies handle clients with particular needs will cut some of their work bloat and stay efficient as a company. SCWX should start to approach the valuations of the cloud and SaaS security companies now that they can act like a managed security company without doing the managing.\n2. **THEY'RE GODDAMNED BUSY RIGHT NOW**. If their own security professionals were only half-busy right now, they wouldn't make this sort of announcement because it would undercut their own productivity/profitability. But if SCWX is swamped with new clients and with old clients who need more work done, then they would need to find ways to unload their work profitably. Partnership allows them to quickly add clients to their roster by pairing them with vetted security firms that don't have the same software base as SCWX.\n\n# Massive amounts of insider buying\n\nIn the last month, insiders, mainly the CEO, bought more stock than they did in the rest of last year.  I'm betting that they're doing brisk business and they think the stock is undervalued at current prices.\n\n[Source: NASDAQ](https://preview.redd.it/soizm2dzh9151.png?width=1210&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e73a75d162b9bfdee12067f60b63b147ce5924df)\n\n# Potential short squeeze\n\nNominally, the class A stock has a float (shares available to public, i.e. not insiders or index funds) of 63% and **15% short interest**. That level of short interest is on the low end of the right range where short squeezes are common.\n\nMost of the company's value, however, is locked up in class B stock held exclusively by Dell (12.12MM class A shares, 70MM class B shares). **The real float of the company is closer to 11.7%**. Low float is generally indicative of an extremely volatile share price. If SCWX picks up momentum, it will move up quickly as the short holders get squeezed and few market participants are able to sell.\n\nAdditionally, 25% of all class A shares are held by insiders and 62% are held by institutional investors; which is a bullish breakdown that implies knowledgeable folks are holding.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Technicals\n\nI don't believe in magic crayon bollocks, but I want to draw attention to yesterday's trading which was the fairly wild for SCWX. Below we see a gap up, followed by a momentum algo pile-on or short squeeze to a two month high, a retest of last week's close, and then consolidation at +5%. Due to the volatility of SCWX on up days like yesterday, this trade will be most rewarding to traders who either actively check the charts or set profit-taking limit sells (like I do).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vm7fvqn1i9151.png?width=858&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=898d4a72bdd1e5c04842df343b7ed2f8b4cc0c07\n\nI think there's a legit possibility that this trade could be a ten-bagger, but I have set half my contracts to sell with a stop-limit order when they are up 100% so that I can take make my remaining contracts \"free\" without having to follow the chart all day. If that order executes, I'll probably set my next stop-limit order for a more outrageous amount like +300-500%, or I will follow the timeline below.\n\n# Strategy\n\nQ1 **earnings for SCWX are going to be reported pre-market on June 4th**. I expect a big run-up before then as other cybersecurity firms report high earnings and continue to be bid up. I hope the stock is up high enough that I can **sell June 3rd at a big profit**. If the stock moves up, but dip right before earnings, then I'll hold through earnings and sell just after at either a profit or a loss. I have TP hands (it happens when you watch 4/17 SPY puts go from +300% to -90%) and will take some profit/cut some losses early depending on how the trade goes.\n\nI recommend the **7/17 17.50 call** option for a couple of reasons:\n\n1. **Most liquid** call option in the entire chain with OI &gt; 300. The **bid-ask is still as wide as your wife's pussy, so be careful** with your orders. You can also do the 15c and 20c contracts for more/less risk, but there is less OI. The June contracts are more \"on thesis,\" but OI is less than 30 and I never buy contracts with that low of volume.\n2. I want a lot of **gamma** because I think the share price is going to make big swings in the next few days. The 17.50c offers the right amount of leverage for my taste.\n3. I think there is a solid chance (\\~30%) they will become ATM or higher by earnings.\n4. **Protection from theta gang**. There will still be over a month of time value on these bad boys after earnings, while we're only holding for a week.\n\nAgain, there's some other interesting options in the chain, you can also do spreads to lower cost basis, or you can sell covered calls to profit off the same move and make money off autists YOLOing into these contracts.\n\nBelow is the payout table I calculated for the 17.50c option. *Note that 50 cents might not be the best available price*, if you pay too much you'll take an immediate loss. And if you get in cheaper, growth potential is even higher. I did not take into account the pre-earnings IV pump which should act in your favor.\n\n[Options payout table](https://preview.redd.it/9dkbnog4i9151.png?width=691&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=98a65739dee8b4c59dc7c7a57d1dafd597b78ba1)\n\n**Risks for this play:**\n\n1. The market is efficient and SCWX is correctly priced.\n2. Managed security does not attract more customers due to expense or inability to support additional customers.\n3. Existing customers too cash-strapped to buy more security infrastructure.\n4. During last earnings call, March 27th, SCWX gave guidance for lower earnings next quarter due to pandemic. (But that was when everyone was still freaking the fuck out and reported earnings were only to end of February.)\n5. Rug pull on entire market.\n6. Burned on bid-ask spread.\n7. CRWD and OKTA miss earnings (later this week).\n8. Fuckery by Dell related to the class B shares.\n9. Pretty much any risk listed in the SCWX 10-K.\n\n**Disclaimer:** I am not your financial advisor.

        "selftext": "So, if you\u2019ve been following recent events, you might have observed a shift in global opinion towards a more anti-China stance. In other words, nations like Japan, America, and India are growing more distrustful of China\u2019s economic expansionist policies, and trying to nurture local manufacturing, ultimately reducing their nation\u2019s reliance on Chinese goods. Here we\u2019ll observe how this could benefit other countries, particularly India, who\u2019s PM just addressed their nation and announced a stimulus package. Yes, you degenerates, you can place bets on which country is most likely to benefit from China\u2019s loss in tendies. This can be utilized as a long term and short-term play. \n\nTo begin with, China\u2019s public image is at an all time low, with President Tendies himself accusing them of developing the virus in a lab in Wuhan. Moreover, this sentiment is spilling over globally. Other nations are realizing their dependence on China may leave them vulnerable to economic exploitation at their hands, and deprived of certain goods during testing times, such as a war or pandemic. To counter this, nations are going to great lengths and incentivizing local manufacturing. For example, Japan just allocated 243.5bn Yen to shift production back to Japan. This bill also includes billions to shift production to other countries. Translation: anywhere but China. \n\n[Trump\u2019s Wuhan lab leak theory ](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.smh.com.au/national/it-would-be-unwise-to-dismiss-donald-trump-s-wuhan-lab-leak-theory-20200507-p54qyg.html)\n\n[Japan Production Shift ](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2020/04/09/business/japan-sets-aside-\u00a5243-5-billion-help-firms-shift-production-china/#.XrrKriXhXDs)\n\n\nThis raises a very interesting question: who will fill China\u2019s void; which East Asian pie hole will the western powers now use to satisfy their glutinous consumer-crazed urges? I\u2019m betting India\u2019s looking really cute atm in that short dress and unlimited labor, many of whom speak (some, or something similar to) English. I\u2019m betting this because most of the FAGMAN companies already have a strong presence there and have committed to increasing their presence there in the long term. For example, apple are planning on shifting most of their iPhone production from China to India. And big daddy Bezos just announced he\u2019ll enslave, sorry, I mean employ 1 million more Indians by 2025. Moreover, Facebook just invested and bought 9.99% of Jio, a part of Reliance Industries for 5.7bn to increase its presence in India as well. This resulted in an increase in stock price for both companies. Now, you smart guys with calls already know the power of the FAGMAN and I\u2019m pretty sure all these companies individually are all worth more than the GPD of Madagascar. This sets India up for a huge slam dunk in terms of their global presence and GDP, and companies like Reliance benefitting from foreign investment. \n\n[Apple production shift from China to India ](https://www.google.com/amp/s/9to5mac.com/2020/05/11/iphone-production/amp/)\n\n[Bezos pledges to create 1 million jobs in India ](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.financialexpress.com/industry/jeff-bezos-says-amazon-to-create-1-million-jobs-in-india-by-2025/1827095/lite/)\n\n[Facebook investment in Jio ](https://www.google.com/amp/s/techcrunch.com/2020/04/21/facebook-reliance-jio/amp/)\n\n\nNow moving on to the PM Narendra \u201c56 inch chest\u201d Modi\u2019s speech, the catalyst that could cause an immediate spike in INDA. ThePM made the speech announcing 2 main things. 1. Free naan for everyone to the tune of $60bn (nearly 10% of their GDP) 2. \u201cA self-reliant India\u201d. Translation: FU China, we\u2019re coming for your tendies. No wonder their troops are fist fighting at their border (link included). Keep in mind Modi made this speech after markets closed in India, and Indian markets haven\u2019t opened for tomorrow yet. Time as of posting this is 10:45pm IST; two hours after speech. Now, any economist can tell you a stimulus package hits the markets like a bump of pure yayo to the dome. The question is, how long will this high remain in the Indian markets. Considering the level of corruption in India, a huge amount, even backdoor payments, could go directly into the coffers of their corporations, causing an immediate spike and rally in the Indian markets starting tomorrow. Stock brokers in India are rejoicing as we speak (linked).\n\n[India China troops fist fight ](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/11/indian-and-chinese-soldiers-injured-in-cross-border-fistfight-says-delhi)\n\n[Stimulus Package + \u201cself reliant India\u201d](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.ndtv.com/india-news/prime-minister-narendra-modis-address-to-nation-on-coronavirus-covid-19-lockdown-top-quotes-2227682%3famp=1&amp;akamai-rum=off)\n\n[Indian stock brokers rejoice ](https://www.google.com/amp/s/m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/market-to-rally-on-thursday-as-modi-offers-big-bonanza-stimulus-package/amp_articleshow/75700846.cms)\n\n\n\u201cAlright, that\u2019s great, but how can I make money on this retard?\u201d Alright, I think there\u2019s 2 ways to play this.\n\nShort term: anticipate an increase in Sensex and NIFTY starting tomorrow and play short term weekly calls. An increase could turn into a rally in the Indian markets, but it\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess how long it could last, 1 day? 1 week? 1 month? It\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess during corona times. \n\nLong term: play long term options into Jan 2021 and 2022, anticipating a rise in the balance sheets of Indian companies and their economy. Remember INDA tracks only top firms in the Indian securities market. \n\nTLDR: End of Asian fettish. New world domination plan: gas stations everywhere. PM Modi gives coke IV to the Indian economy. Long term and short term calls on INDA viable. \n\nP.s. for anyone who\u2019s offended, I\u2019m of Indian descent. Lighten up.",

        "selftext": "How many people really understand what they\u2019re buying, especially when it comes to highly specialized hardware companies? Most NVidia investors seem to be relying on a vague idea of how the company should thrive \u201cin the future\u201d, as their GPUs are ostensibly used for Artificial Intelligence, Cloud, holograms, etc. Having been shocked by how this company is represented in the media, I decided to lay out how this business works, doing my part to fight for reality. With what\u2019s been going on in markets, I don\u2019t like my chances but here goes:\n\nLet\u2019s start with\u2026\n\n**How does NVDA make money?**\n\nNVDA is in the business of semiconductor design. As a simplified image in your head, you can imagine this as designing very detailed and elaborate posters. Their engineers create circuit patterns for printing onto semiconductor wafers. NVDA then pays a semiconductor foundry (the printer \u2013 generally TSMC) to create chips with those patterns on them. \n\nSimply put, NVDA\u2019s profits represent the difference between the price at which they can sell those chips, less the cost of printing, and less the cost of paying their engineers to design them.\n\nNotably, after the foundry prints the chips, NVDA also has to pay (I say pay, but really it is more like \u201csell at a discount to\u201d) their \u201cadd-in board\u201d (AIB) partners to stick the chips onto printed circuit boards (what you might imagine as green things with a bunch of capacitors on them). That leads to the final form in which buyers experience the GPU.  \n\n**What is a GPU?**\n\nNVDA designs chips called GPUs (Graphical Processing Units). Initially, GPUs were used for the rapid processing and creation of images, but their use cases have expanded over time. You may be familiar with the CPU (Central Processing Unit). CPUs sit at the core of a computer system, doing most of the calculation, taking orders from the operating system (e.g. Windows, Linux), etc. AMD and Intel make CPUs. GPUs assist the CPU with certain tasks. You can think of the CPU as having a few giant very powerful engines. The GPU has a lot of small much less powerful engines. Sometimes you have to do a lot of really simple tasks that don\u2019t require powerful engines to complete. Here, the act of engaging the powerful engines is a waste of time, as you end up spending most of your time revving them up and revving them down. In that scenario, it helps the CPU to hand that task over to the GPU in order to \u201caccelerate\u201d the completion of the task. The GPU only revs up a small engine for each task, and is able to rev up all the small engines simultaneously to knock out a large number of these simple tasks at the same time. Remember the GPU has lots of engines. The GPU also has an edge in interfacing a lot with memory but let\u2019s not get too technical.\n\n**Who uses NVDA\u2019s GPUs?**\n\nThere are two main broad end markets for NVDA\u2019s GPUs \u2013 Gaming and Professional. Let\u2019s dig into each one:  \n\n**The Gaming Market:**\n\nA Bit of Ancient History (**Skip if impatient**)\n\nGPUs were first heavily used for gaming in arcades. They then made their way to consoles, and finally PCs. NVDA started out in the PC phase of GPU gaming usage. They weren\u2019t the first company in the space, but they made several good moves that ultimately led to a very strong market position. Firstly, they focused on selling into OEMs \u2013 guys like the equivalent of today\u2019s DELL/HP/Lenovo \u2013 , which allowed a small company to get access to a big market without having to create a lot of relationships. Secondly, they focused on the design aspect of the GPU, and relied on their Asian supply chain to print the chip, to package the chip and to install in on a printed circuit board \u2013 the Asian supply chain ended up being the best in semis. But the insight that really let NVDA dominate was noticing that some GPU manufacturers were focusing on keeping hardware-accelerated Transform and Lighting as a Professional GPU feature. As a start-up, with no professional GPU business to disrupt, NVidia decided their best ticket into the big leagues was blowing up the market by including this professional grade feature into their gaming product. It worked \u2013 and this was a real masterstroke \u2013 the visual and performance improvements were extraordinary. 3DFX, the initial leader in PC gaming GPUs, was vanquished, and importantly it happened when funding markets shut down with the tech bubble bursting and after 3DFX made some large ill-advised acquisitions. Consequently 3DFX, went from hero to zero, and NVDA bought them for a pittance out of bankruptcy, acquiring the best IP portfolio in the industry.\n\n**Some more Modern History**\n\nThis is what NVDA\u2019s pure gaming card revenue looks like over time \u2013 NVDA only really broke these out in 2005 (note by pure, this means ex-Tegra revenues):\n\n\ud83d\udcf7 https://hyperinflation2020.tumblr.com/private/618394577731223552/tumblr\\_Ikb8g9Cu9sxh2ERno \n\nSo what is the history here? Well, back in the late 90s when GPUs were first invented, they were **required** to play any 3D game. As discussed in the early history above, NVDA landed a hit product to start with early and got a strong burst of growth: revenues of 160M in 1998 went to 1900M in 2002. But then NVDA ran into strong competition from ATI (later purchased and currently owned by AMD). While NVDA\u2019s sales struggled to stay flat from 2002 to 2004, ATI\u2019s doubled from 1Bn to 2Bn. NVDA\u2019s next major win came in 2006, with the 8000 series. ATI was late with a competing product, and NVDA\u2019s sales skyrocketed \u2013 as can be seen in the graph above. With ATI being acquired by AMD they were unfocused for some time, and NVDA was able to keep their lead for an extended period. Sales slowed in 2008/2009 but that was due to the GFC \u2013 people don\u2019t buy expensive GPU hardware in recessions. \n\nAnd then we got to 2010 and the tide changed. Growth in desktop PCs ended. Here is a chart from Statista:\n\n\ud83d\udcf7https://hyperinflation2020.tumblr.com/private/618394674172919808/tumblr\\_OgCnNwTyqhMhAE9r9 \n\nThis resulted in two negative secular trends for Nvidia. Firstly, with the decline in popularity of desktop PCs, growth in gaming GPUs faded as well (below is a chart from Jon Peddie). Note that NVDA sells discrete GPUs, aka DT (Desktop) Discrete. Integrated GPUs are mainly made by Intel (these sit on the motherboard or with the CPU).\n\n\ud83d\udcf7 https://hyperinflation2020.tumblr.com/private/618394688079200256/tumblr\\_rTtKwOlHPIVUj8e7h \n\nYou can see from the chart above that discrete desktop GPU sales are fading faster than integrated GPU sales. This is the other secular trend [\\[TM1\\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/submit#_msocom_1) hurting NVDA\u2019s gaming business. Integrated GPUs are getting better and better, taking over a wider range of tasks that were previously the domain of the discrete GPU. Surprisingly, the most popular eSports game of recent times \u2013 Fortnite \u2013 only requires Intel HD 4000 graphics \u2013 an Integrated GPU from 2012!\n\nSo at this point you might go back to NVDA\u2019s gaming sales, and ask the question: What happened in 2015? How is NVDA overcoming these secular trends?\n\nThe answer consists of a few parts.Firstly, AMD dropped the ball in 2015. As you can see in this chart, sourced from 3DCenter, AMD market share was halved in 2015, due to a particularly poor product line-up:\n\n\ud83d\udcf7 https://hyperinflation2020.tumblr.com/private/618394753459994624/tumblr\\_J7vRw9y0QxMlfm6Xd \n\nFollowing this, NVDA came out with Pascal in 2016 \u2013 a very powerful offering in the mid to high end part of the GPU market. At the same time, AMD was focusing on rebuilding and had no compelling mid or high end offerings. AMD mainly focused on maintaining scale in the very low end. Following that came 2017 and 2018: AMD\u2019s offering was still very poor at the time, but cryptomining drove demand for GPUs to new levels, and AMD\u2019s GPUs were more compelling from a price-performance standpoint for crypto mining initially, perversely leading to AMD gaining share. NVDA quickly remedied that by improving their drivers to better mine crypto, regaining their relative positioning, and profiting in a big way from the crypto boom. Supply that was calibrated to meet gaming demand collided with cryptomining demand and Average Selling Prices of GPUs shot through the roof. Cryptominers bought top of the line GPUs aggressively.  \n\nA good way to see changes in crypto demand for GPUs is the mining profitability of Ethereum:\n\n\ud83d\udcf7 https://hyperinflation2020.tumblr.com/private/618394769378443264/tumblr\\_cmBtR9gm8T2NI9jmQ \n\nThis leads us to where we are today. 2019 saw gaming revenues drop for NVDA. Where are they likely to head? \n\nThe secular trends of falling desktop sales along with falling discrete GPU sales have reasserted themselves[\\[TM2\\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/submit#_msocom_2) , as per the Jon Peddie research above. Cryptomining profitability has collapsed. \n\nAMD has come out with a new architecture, NAVI, and the 5700XT \u2013 the first Iteration, competes effectively with NVDA in the mid-high end space on a price/performance basis. This is the first real competition from AMD since 2014.\n\nNVDA can see all these trends, and they tried to respond. Firstly, with volumes clearly declining, and likely with a glut of second-hand GPUs that can make their way to gamers over time from the crypto space, NVDA decided to pursue a price over volume strategy. They released their most expensive set of GPUs by far in the latest Turing series. They added a new feature, Ray Tracing, by leveraging the Tensor Cores they had created for Professional uses, hoping to use that as justification for higher prices (more on this in the section on Professional GPUs). Unfortunately for NVDA, gamers have responded quite poorly to Ray Tracing \u2013 it caused performance issues, had poor support, poor adoption, and the visual improvements in most cases are not particularly noticeable or relevant. \n\nThe last recession led to gaming revenues falling 30%, despite NVDA being in a very strong position at the time vis-\u00e0-vis AMD \u2013 this time around their position is quickly slipping and it appears that the recession is going to be bigger. Additionally, the shift away from discrete GPUs in gaming continues.\n\nTo make matters worse for NVDA, AMD won the slots in both the New Xbox and the New PlayStation, coming out later this year. The performance of just the AMD GPU in those consoles looks to be competitive with NVidia products that currently retail for more than the entire console is likely to cost. Consider that usually you have to pair that NVidia GPU with a bunch of other expensive hardware. The pricing and margin impact of this console cycle on NVDA is likely to be very substantially negative. \n\nIt would be prudent to assume a greater than 30% fall in gaming revenues from the very elevated 2019 levels, with likely secular decline to follow.\n\n**The Professional Market:**\n\nA Bit of Ancient History (again, skip if impatient)\n\nAs it turns out, graphical accelerators were first used in the Professional market, long before they were employed for Gaming purposes. The big leader in the space was a company called Silicon Graphics, who sold workstations with custom silicon optimised for graphical processing. Their sales were only $25Mn in 1985, but by 1997 they were doing 3.6Bn in revenue \u2013 truly exponential growth. Unfortunately for them, from that point on, discrete GPUs took over, and their highly engineered, customised workstations looked exorbitantly expensive in comparison. Sales sank to 500mn by 2006 and, with no profits in sight, they ended up filing for bankruptcy in 2009. Competition is harsh in the semiconductor industry.\n\nInitially, the Professional market centred on visualisation and design, but it has changed over time. There were a lot of players and lot of nuance, but I am going to focus on more recent times, as they are more relevant to NVidia. \n\n**Some More Modern History**\n\nNVDA\u2019s Professional business started after its gaming business, but we don\u2019t have revenue disclosures that show exactly when it became relevant. This is what we do have \u2013 going back to 2005:\n\n\ud83d\udcf7 https://hyperinflation2020.tumblr.com/private/618394785029472256/tumblr\\_fEcYAzdstyh6tqIsI \n\nIn the beginning, Professional revenues were focused on the 3D visualisation end of the spectrum, with initial sales going into workstations that were edging out the customised builds made by Silicon Graphics. Fairly quickly, however, GPUs added more and more functionality and started to turn into general parallel data processors rather than being solely optimised towards graphical processing. \n\nAs this change took place, people in scientific computing noticed, and started using GPUs to accelerate scientific workloads that involve very parallel computation, such as matrix manipulation. This started at the workstation level, but by 2007 NVDA decided to make a new line-up of Tesla series cards specifically suited to scientific computing. The professional segment now have several points of focus:\n\n1. GPUs used in workstations for things such as CAD graphical processing (Quadro Line)\n\n2. GPUs used in workstations for computational workloads such as running engineering simulations (Quadro Line)\n\n3. GPUs used in workstations for machine learning applications (Quadro line.. but can use gaming cards as well for this)\n\n4. GPUs used by enterprise customers for high performance computing (such as modelling oil wells) (Tesla Line)\n\n5. GPUs used by enterprise customers for machine learning projects (Tesla Line)\n\n6. GPUs used by hyperscalers (mostly for machine learning projects) (Tesla Line)\n\nIn more recent times, given the expansion of the Tesla line, NVDA has broken up reporting into Professional Visualisation (Quadro Line) and Datacenter (Tesla Line). Here are the revenue splits since that reporting started:\n\n\ud83d\udcf7 https://hyperinflation2020.tumblr.com/private/618394798232158208/tumblr\\_3AdufrCWUFwLgyQw2 \n\n\ud83d\udcf7 https://hyperinflation2020.tumblr.com/private/618394810632601600/tumblr\\_2jmajktuc0T78Juw7 \n\nIt is worth stopping here and thinking about the huge increase in sales delivered by the Tesla line. The reason for this huge boom is the sudden increase in interest in numerical techniques for machine learning. Let\u2019s go on a brief detour here to understand what machine learning is, because a lot of people want to hype it but not many want to tell you what it actually is. I have the misfortune of being very familiar with the industry, which prevented me from buying into the hype. Oops \u2013 sometimes it really sucks being educated.\n\n**What is Machine Learning?**\n\nAt a very high level, machine learning is all about trying to get some sort of insight out of data. Most of the core techniques used in machine learning were developed a long time ago, in the 1950s and 1960s. The most common machine learning technique, which most people have heard of and may be vaguely familiar with, is called regression analysis. Regression analysis involves fitting a line through a bunch of datapoints. The most common type of regression analysis is called \u201cOrdinary Least Squares\u201d OLS regression, and that type of regression has a \u201cclosed form\u201d solution, which means that there is a very simple calculation you can do to fit an OLS regression line to data.\n\nAs it happens, fitting a line through points is not only easy to do, it also tends to be the main machine learning technique that people want to use, because it is very intuitive. You can make good sense of what the data is telling you and can understand the machine learning model you are using. Obviously, regression analysis doesn\u2019t require a GPU!\n\nHowever, there is another consideration in machine learning: if you want to use a regression model, you still need a human to select the data that you want to fit the line through. Also, sometimes the relationship doesn\u2019t look like a line, but rather it might look like a curve. In this case, you need a human to \u201ctransform\u201d the data before you fit a line through it in order to make the relationship linear.\n\nSo people had another idea here: what if instead of getting a person to select the right data to analyse, and the right model to apply, you could just get a computer to do that? Of course the problem with that is that computers are really stupid. They have no preconceived notion of what data to use or what relationship would make sense, so what they do is TRY EVERYTHING! And everything involves trying a hell of a lot of stuff. And trying a hell of a lot of stuff, most of which is useless garbage, involves a huge amount of computation. People tried this for a while through to the 1980s, decided it was useless, and dropped it\u2026 until recently. \n\nWhat changed? Well we have more data now, and we have a lot more computing power, so we figured lets have another go at it. As it happens, the premier technique for trying a hell of a lot of stuff (99.999% of which is garbage you throw away) is called \u201cDeep Learning\u201d. Deep learning is SUPER computationally intensive, and that computation happens to involve a lot of matrix multiplication. And guess what just happens to have been doing a lot of matrix multiplication? GPUs!\n\nHere is a chart that, for obvious reasons, lines up extremely well with the boom in Tesla GPU sales:\n\n\ud83d\udcf7 https://hyperinflation2020.tumblr.com/private/618394825774989312/tumblr\\_IZ3ayFDB0CsGdYVHW \n\nNow we need to realise a few things here. Deep Learning is not some magic silver bullet. There are specific applications where it has proven very useful \u2013 primarily areas that have a very large number of very weak relationships between bits of data that sum up into strong relationships. An example of ones of those is Google Translate. On the other hand, in most analytical tasks, it is most useful to have an intuitive understanding of the data and to fit a simple and sensible model to it that is explainable. Deep learning models are not explainable in an intuitive manner. This is not only because they are complicated, but also because their scattershot technique of trying everything leaves a huge amount of garbage inside the model that cancels itself out when calculating the answer, but it is hard to see how it cancels itself out when stepping through it.\n\nGiven the quantum of hype on Deep learning and the space in general, many companies are using \u201cDeep Learning\u201d, \u201cMachine Learning\u201d and \u201cAI\u201d as marketing. Not many companies are actually generating significant amounts of tangible value from Deep Learning. \n\n**Back to the Competitive Picture**\n\n**For the Tesla Segment**\n\nSo NVDA happened to be in the right place at the right time to benefit from the Deep Learning hype. They happened to have a product ready to go and were able to charge a pretty penny for their product. But what happens as we proceed from here?\n\nFirstly, it looks like the hype from Deep Learning has crested, which is not great from a future demand perspective. Not only that, but we really went from people having no GPUs, to people having GPUs. The next phase is people upgrading their old GPUs. It is much harder to sell an upgrade than to make the first sale.\n\nNot only that, but GPUs are not the ideal manifestation of silicon for Deep Learning. NVDA themselves effectively admitted that with their latest iteration in the Datacentre, called Ampere. High Performance Computing, which was the initial use case for Tesla GPUs, was historically all about double precision floating point calculations (FP64). High precision calculations are required for simulations in aerospace/oil &amp; gas/automotive. \n\nNVDA basically sacrificed HPC and shifted further towards Deep Learning with Ampere[\\[TM3\\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/submit#_msocom_3) , announced last Thursday. The FP64 performance of the A100 (the latest Ampere chip) increased a fairly pedestrian 24% from the V100, increasing from 7.8 to 9.7 TF. Not a surprise that NVDA lost El Capitan to AMD, given this shift away from a focus on HPC. Instead, NVDA jacked up their Tensor Cores (i.e. not the GPU cores) and focused very heavily on FP16 computation (a lot less precise than FP64). As it turns out, FP16 is precise enough for Deep Learning, and NVDA recognises that. The future industry standard is likely to be BFloat 16 \u2013 the format pioneered by Google, who lead in Deep Learning. Ampere now does 312 TF of BF16, which compares to the 420 TF of Google\u2019s TPU V3 \u2013 Google\u2019s Machine Learning specific processor. [\\[TM4\\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/submit#_msocom_4) Not quite up to the 2018 board from Google, but getting better \u2013 if they cut out all of the Cuda cores and GPU functionality maybe they could get up to Google\u2019s spec. \n\nAnd indeed this is the problem for NVDA: when you make a GPU it has a large number of different use cases, and you provide a single product that meets all of these different use cases. That is a very hard thing to do, and explains why it has been difficult for competitors to muscle into the GPU space. On the other hand, when you are making a device that does one thing, such as deep learning, it is a much simpler thing to do. Google managed to do it with no GPU experience and is still ahead of NVDA. It is likely that Intel will be able to enter this space successfully, as they have widely signalled with the Xe. \n\nThere is of course the other large negative driver for Deep Learning, and that is the recession we are now in. Demand for GPU instances on Amazon has collapsed across the board, as evidenced by the fall in pricing. The below graph shows one example: this data is for renting out a single Tesla V100 GPU on AWS, which isthe typical thing to do in an early exploratory phase for a Deep Learning model:\n\n\ud83d\udcf7 https://hyperinflation2020.tumblr.com/private/618396177958944768/tumblr\\_Q86inWdeCwgeakUvh \n\nWith Deep Learning not delivering near-term tangible results, it is the first thing being cut. On their most recent conference call, [\\[TM5\\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/submit#_msocom_5) IBM noted weakness in their cognitive division (AI), and noted weaker sales of their power servers, which is the line that houses Enterprise GPU servers at IBM. Facebook cancelled their AI residencies for this year, and Google pushed theirs out. Even if NVDA can put in a good quarter due to their new product rollout[\\[TM6\\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/submit#_msocom_6)  (Ampere), the future is rapidly becoming a very stormy place.\n\n**For the Quadro segment**\n\nThe Quadro segment has been a cash cow for a long time, generating dependable sales and solid margins. AMD just decided to rock the boat a bit. Sensing NVDA\u2019s focus on Deep Learning, AMD seems to be focusing on HPC \u2013 the Radeon VII announced recently with a price point of $1899 takes aim at NVDAs most expensive Quadro, the GV100, priced at $8999. It does 6.5 TFLOPS of FP64 Double precision, whereas the GV100 does 7.4 \u2013 talk about shaking up a quiet segment. \n\n**Pulling things together**\n\nLet\u2019s go back to what NVidia fundamentally does \u2013 paying their engineers to design chips, getting TSMC to print those chips, and getting board partners in Taiwan to turn them into the final product.\n\nWe have seen how a confluence of several pieces of extremely good fortune lined up to increase NVidia\u2019s sales and profits tremendously: first on the Gaming side, weak competition from AMD until 2014, coupled with a great product in form of Pascal in 2016, followed by a huge crypto driven boom in 2017 and 2018, and on the Professional side, a sudden and unexpected increase in interest in Deep Learning driving Tesla demand from 2017-2019 sky high.\n\nIt is worth noting what these transient factors have done to margins. When unexpected good things happen to a chip company, sales go up a lot, but there are no costs associated with those sales. Strong demand means that you can sell each chip for a higher price, but no additional design work is required, and you still pay the printer, TSMC, the same amount of money. Consequently NVDA\u2019s margins have gone up substantially: well above their 11.9% long term average to hit a peak of 33.2%, and more recently 26.5%:\n\n\ud83d\udcf7 https://hyperinflation2020.tumblr.com/private/618396192166100992/tumblr\\_RiWaD0RLscq4midoP \n\nThe question is, what would be a sensible margin going forward? Obviously 33% operating margin would attract a wall of competition and get competed away, which is why they can only be temporary. However, NVidia has shifted to having a greater proportion of its sales coming from non-OEM, and has a greater proportion of its sales coming from Professional rather than gaming. As such, maybe one can be generous and say NVDA can earn an 18% average operating margin over the next cycle. We can sense check these margins, using Intel. Intel has a long term average EBIT margin of about 25%. Intel happens to actually print the chips as well, so they collect a bigger fraction of the final product that they sell. NVDA, since it only does the design aspect, can\u2019t earn a higher EBIT margin than Intel on average over the long term.\n\nTesla sales have likely gone too far and will moderate from here \u2013 perhaps down to a still more than respectable $2bn per year. Gaming resumes the long-term slide in discrete GPUs, which will likely be replaced by integrated GPUs to a greater and greater extent over time. But let\u2019s be generous and say it maintains $3.5 Bn Per year for the add in board, and let\u2019s assume we keep getting $750mn odd of Nintendo Switch revenues(despite that product being past peak of cycle, with Nintendo themselves forecasting a sales decline). Let\u2019s assume AMD struggles to make progress in Quadro, despite undercutting NVDA on price by 75%, with continued revenues at $1200. Add on the other 1.2Bn of Automotive, OEM and IP (I am not even counting the fact that car sales have collapsed and Automotive is likely to be down big), and we would end up with revenues of $8.65 Bn, at an average operating margin of 20% through the cycle that would have $1.75Bn of operating earnings power, and if I say that the recent Mellanox acquisition manages to earn enough to pay for all the interest on NVDAs debt, and I assume a tax rate of 15% we would have around $1.5Bn in Net income. \n\nThis company currently has a market capitalisation of $209 Bn. It blows my mind that it trades on 139x what I consider to be fairly generous earnings \u2013 earnings that NVidia never even got close to seeing before the confluence of good luck hit them. But what really stuns me is the fact that investors are actually willing to extrapolate this chain of unlikely and positive events into the future.\n\nShockingly, Intel has a market cap of 245Bn, only 40Bn more than NVDA, but Intel\u2019s sales and profits are 7x higher. And while Intel is facing competition from AMD, it is much more likely to hold onto those sales and profits than NVDA is. These are absolutely stunning valuation disparities. \n\nIf I didn\u2019t see NVDA\u2019s price, and I started from first principles and tried to calculate a prudent price for the company I would have estimated a$1.5Bn normalised profit, maybe on a 20x multiple giving them the benefit of the doubt despite heading into a huge recession, and considering the fact that there is not much debt and the company is very well run. That would give you a market cap of $30Bn, and a share price of $49. And it is currently $339. Wow. Obviously I\u2019m short here!",

        "selftext": "\\## **My history investing in college and my first month investing in February:**\n\nLearned about miners and blockchain validation with a chemical engineering friend before the rally.\n\n\\- Bought **XRP** at $.15 and $.25, sold at $3.28 (I valued at $4 or $5 dollars MAX in 10 years if blockchain found adoption)\n\n\\- Bought **AMD** after the rally at $11 because it was ridiculous how much cost efficiency they had introduced to the market to poor people like me unlike **NVIDIA** products which always seemed far removed and discouraged me.\n\n\\- I started with **Panasonic** because I had missed out on the window to invest in **Tesla** at 200-300 range. I believed **Panasonic** to be similar to **AMD's** relationship to **bitcoin**; while all eyes looked at the shiny object, I looked at the boring parts that built it.\n\n\\- The market crashed, so I DCA'd aggressively and controlled my emotions through out. I was more concerned with my performance to commitment rather than my returns at the time. I did well.\n\n\\- My investments in March 19 was **SQ** and **Lyft**\n\n\\## **My Strategy now that I have income**\n\n\\- I bought up to 5,000 dollars in stocks ranging from **FANUC** (industrial robotics) to **DENNYS** (logistics/real estate)\n\n\\- I trimmed down to $2,300 but will rapidly rebuild with a different approach:\n\n\\- I'm buying 1 stock in the company before making any further developments with. Following this, I will purchase ETFs in sectors that I **want** to see develop in the next 5-15 years. I will buy 1 stake into these ETFs and combine it with my 1 stock purchase to create the necessary offset.\n\n\\- For example, I bought 1 stock of **Texas Instruments**  for $109 followed by a purchase in **SOXX ETF** for semiconductors, which has the largest ETF allocation to **Texas Instruments.** I will apply similar logic to companies like **Facebook, Paypal,** etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- I do this \"1 chip\" start in multiple industries because I want to pick some arbitrary point in time but I have a lot of industries &amp; ecosystems that I would like to reasonably participate in. This will still cost a lot of money to start off with and buys me time to study company numbers and outlooks.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\## **My current market sentiment**\n\n**-** I consider where you start on a graph as somewhat arbitrary and see the current market stability as somewhat of an exercise in game theory and rowing a boat throat a thick fog. I believe it's optimal to row cautiously forward and to not stay still. With cautious rowing, you'll be able to react appropriately if you are suddenly met by a waterfall or a path with clearer vision.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- I am **\\`*****BEARISH\\`*** on Amazon in the long term. I believe that slowly, but surely, the market will consume Amazon's hold on its markets. I don't believe Amazon will maintain the status quo on cloud computing due to the quality of its competitors. I absolutely LOVE **Google Cloud Platform** and utilize **Firebase real-time database** very often. **Microsoft** has made some extremely important acquisitions recently in **Github and NPM - that's enormous.**\n\n\\-  I have suspicions about **Amazon** will struggle internationally. I don't know if Amazon will penetrate China the way China does, or if it will succeed in locations south of Mexico against things like **Mercado Libre**\n\n\\- I have suspicions that tech platforms will soon integrate in a meaningful way with financials. As in, the virtualization of stores and forwarded payments in places like the **Facebook(Visa) Market Place, Twitter(Square) payment sending, Paypal(honey) &amp; Amazon purchasing, Gaming credits, etc.**\n\n**-** I am \\`**bullish**\\` on Facebook. Facebook is utterly invaluable and scales globally. The reason it's adopted in **Mexico**, for example, is because it's cheaper and faster than other services. They also service millions of developers with **React** and its growing development ecosystem. They provide a standardized marketting platform for small businesses on Instagram, Facebook, WhatsApp, and soon to be JIO. I would not be surprised if they soon enter the fintech sector.\n\n\\- I am \\`**bullish\\`** on **Paypal**. They are seemingly repeating their previous success by servicing large online commerce that are upgrading their systems. **Honey/Paypal** will scrape coupons for Amazon and force organizations like Visa to compete with  **real-time financial services**.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- I am **\\`bullish\\`** on cloud software and networking. I think **CDNs** and dedicated **services for Cybersecurity** will maintain. Sure Google provides these services but things like **Cloudflare** and **Fastly** have dedicated solutions to fast image processing, DDoS protection, and more that other platforms may not be able to **allocate their resources to**. **Cloudflare** has an enormous network, and **Fastly** provides a great system for you to enjoy content like **Reddit.** I think it's hard to miss the mark here - the highway of the internet is going to get faster and more assets will be maintained in the server's space - the ecosystem must grow with it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- I am ***\\`EXTREMELY BEARISH***\\*\\*\\`\\*\\* on Beyond Meat. I've been vegetarian for 10 years. IT'S BAD. WE HAVE NOTHING ELSE TO BE EXCITED ABOUT AND WE'RE NOT USED TO HAVING ATTENTION. VEGETARIANS ARE LYING IF THEY SAY IT'S AMAZING. ***IT'S LITERALLY DOG FOOD***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- I am \\`**BULLISH\\`** on the long term development of **Mexico**. I think companies like **Kansas City Southern** that services **Mexican-American** relationships will grow well in the long run.\n\n\\- I am **\\`BULLISH\\`**  on Apple and Adobe. Amazing products.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\## **CURRENT HOLDINGS (ordered by priority &amp; checkup time):**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**GOOG &amp; AMZN exposure through tech ETFs** ::: priority FB\n\n**NVIDIA, AMD, Intel EXPOSURE through semiconductor ETFS** ::: priority Texas Instruments\n\n**Environmental Services exposure through Sanitation ETFS** ::: priority Waste Management\n\n**Adobe and AutoDesk exposure through cloud software ETFs** :: priority Adobe\n\n**Nintendo exposure through gaming ETFS ::** priority Nintendo\n\n**Cisco exposure through cloud networking and edge computing ETFS** Cicsco, Fastly, Cloudflare, etc\n\n**TELECOM networking ETFS** :: priority TMobile\n\n**Manufacturing technology, industrial sectors, and robotics exposure to**  Fanuc, ABB, Siemens, Sherwin-Williams, VW, GM, Nissan, Toyota, Panasonic,\n\n**Healthcare services ETF** :: priority Cigna\n\n**FB -- LONG**\n\n**PAYPAL --  LONG**\n\n**TEXAS INSTRUMENTS - LONG**\n\n**MSFT     --  LONG**\n\n**APPLE   --  LONG**\n\n**ADOBE -- LONG**\n\n**DISNEY -  LONG**\n\n**BITCOIN - LONG**\n\n**TMOBILE - 2 YEARS**\n\n**VISA -- 2 YEARS**\n\n**JPM - 2 YEARS**\n\n**TWITTER - 2 YEARS**\n\n**SQUARE - 1 YEAR**\n\n**LYFT - 1 YEAR**\n\n**FASTLY - QUARTERLY**\n\n**CLOUDFLARE - QUARTERLY**\n\n**1LIFE MEDICAL - QUARTERLY**\n\n**FIVERR - QUARTERLY**\n\n**DRAFT KING - QUARTERLY YEAR + CHICAGO POLITICS**\n\n**GROUPON - SPARE CHANGE JAR**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**## EXCITED TO ACQUIRE**\n\n**- ADOBE**\n\n\\- **QQQ**\n\n\\- **SHERWIN WILLIAMS**\n\n\\- **TOYOTA**\n\n\\- **KANSAS CITY SOUTHERN**\n\n\\-",

        "selftext": "Stock breakouts create a ton of different trade opportunities for day traders, swing traders, and even investors using both long and short strategies. Still, they can also be pretty high-risk setups and many times cause inexperienced traders to buy at the very top of a move before it reverses back down. In this post I'll be explaining one of the proper ways to trade stock breakouts, which will help you avoid buying the top and will reduce risk when buying a breakout!\n\n*First... what exactly is a breakout?*\n\nA **breakout** is a move above a defined level of resistance. It's essentially the exact opposite of a breakdown, which is a move below a defined level of support. Unfortunately, many traders are taught to trade breakouts in a much less accurate way that creates a lot of unnecessary risk. This involves them buying immediately when a stock makes a new high over a past level of resistance. The problem with this breakout trading strategy is that it often leads to traders buying the top.\n\nThe reason for this is because of what are known as false breakouts. A **false breakout** is simply a short-term, temporary breakout over resistance that fails to continue upward. Any trader looking to immediately buy a breakout over resistance ends up buying the exact top of a move when it happens to be a false breakout. The breakout trading strategy that I'll be explaining in the rest of this post will help you avoid buying any false breakouts!\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/cWvdaim](https://imgur.com/a/cWvdaim) \n\nInstead of immediately buying a breakout to new highs, you can substantially reduce your risk by waiting for the past breakout level, *or resistance,* to turn into **support**. As explained in past posts, broken resistance can become support, and broken support can become resistance. When a stock breaks above resistance, by waiting for that past resistance to become a level of support you're ensuring that you're not chasing the stock at its high during a false breakout. By trading breakouts this way you also now have a level of support to use for risk management. You can enter the trade knowing that your risk is limited because you'll cut losses if the stock comes back below its new support level.\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/AmRFjt2](https://imgur.com/a/AmRFjt2) \n\nAs you can see in the real life example below with the stock symbol $AMD, there was a breakout over a past high/past resistance level, and a long consolidation period over that past resistance, which then became a key level of support. There was plenty of time in this example to use that support as an opportunity to buy before it started its run to new highs. This happens much more commonly than you may think and can offer some incredible trading opportunities!\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/VoK1nmZ](https://imgur.com/a/VoK1nmZ)\n\n*Again,* using this breakout trading strategy will reduce your risk and will definitely reduce the amount of time that you catch yourself buying into a false breakout. The example of stock symbol $IMBI below shows you how dangerous it can be to buy into these false breakouts. $IMBI had resistance at $5.40 from the market's open, briefly broke above that resistance by only $0.03, came straight back down, and ended the day more than 20% lower than its early morning breakout level! By waiting for support to form over that $5.40 resistance, you'd be able to avoid buying into this false breakout trap.\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/EtaUYFY](https://imgur.com/a/EtaUYFY) \n\nI hope this post was helpful for any new traders that find themselves buying the top of a move too frequently! This strategy should prevent that from happening and should greatly help you improve your accuracy when trading stock breakouts!",

        "selftext": "I'm an 18 year old college student, I started investing with $500 in March and made 10% by investing in stocks in a month. I then decided to get into options and doubled my portfolio to around a $1000 with BA calls and TWTR calls, but by dumb luck I'm guessing now. Then I just spiraled downwards. I bought and sold AMD, ATVI, GRUB calls for losses, only to have them bounce back significantly over the next few days. I bought a CSOD call and watched the value plummet, a SPY put and watched it skyrocket...I began to believe I was unlucky and decided to chase my losses. I'm currently sitting at a good $80, with my CSCO call probably bringing that down further tomorrow. I'm so exasperated, especially since I told myself I was going to quit multiple times while I was in the green. The worst part is that I feel like transferring another $500 from my bank account right now and chasing my losses. I don't know what to do, I'm really stressed and have developed a habit of checking my portfolio every five minutes. That $500 represented 20% of my net worth and I'm not sure I've learned much except that I suck at this.",

        "selftext": "Trading options during earnings season definitely adds to the intensity level, but makes it very interesting and rewarding. Yesterday I bought a 120 TWLO 5/22 p @5.30. I also bought a 135 TWLO c @ 6.10. Now, I have been buying calls in TWLO from 90 and up in the past month. I thought the recent run up provided for a difficult earnings season. However, I bought the call around 12:30pm because I didn\u2019t want to miss a potential pop. Got lucky. In retrospect I shouldn\u2019t have even bought the Put, but a little protection is fine if it fell hard. I sold the C this morning for a $2800 profit. The news was so good on TWLO, that I also bought an OTM, at the time, 165 C later on the day. Up another $1200 unrealized. \n\nI had 8 UBER calls. My strategy was to sell all if UBER traded above 30 in the AM which I did. After I had time to digest LYFTs report, I bought 4 ITM 28 UBER back. Still holding. \n\nROKU was another great holding of mine. However, I sold all three deep ITMs before the close because I was up over 6k from them. I did buy one OTM 145 C. Gone. \n\nI\u2019m a huge believer in SQ so I picked up 5 ITMs today. Granted, I sold all 10 ITM calls yesterday before earnings. I held 3 ITM PYPLs. I thought Square May have bad earnings based on the pre earnings trade and PYPL would be good. The markets could easily sell a stock no matter how good the earnings, INTC. AMZN, AMD for example but I held my PYPLs. \n\nAlso, during the day I kept buying and adding to my SBUX ITM C positions and bought more CRM options on the strength of TWLOs report. I\u2019m also holding several other positions. Very good day overall!! \n\nI\u2019m looking to create a good group discussion to bounce trade ideas and strategies. I welcome other successful trade stories! I\u2019m happy to help others also. As I said numerous times, I am a strong confident directional trader. Most of all, be patient, learn from your mistakes, take calculated risks and stay mentally strong. Good luck!!",

        "selftext": "Stock breakouts create a ton of different trade opportunities for day traders, swing traders, and even investors using both long and short strategies. Still, they can also be pretty high-risk setups and many times cause inexperienced traders to buy at the very top of a move before it reverses back down. In this post I'll be explaining one of the proper ways to trade stock breakouts, which will help you avoid buying the top and will reduce risk when buying a breakout!\n\n*First... what exactly is a breakout?*\n\nA **breakout** is a move above a defined level of resistance. It's essentially the exact opposite of a breakdown, which is a move below a defined level of support. Unfortunately, many traders are taught to trade breakouts in a much less accurate way that creates a lot of unnecessary risk. This involves them buying immediately when a stock makes a new high over a past level of resistance. The problem with this breakout trading strategy is that it often leads to traders buying the top.\n\nThe reason for this is because of what are known as false breakouts. A **false breakout** is simply a short-term, temporary breakout over resistance that fails to continue upward. Any trader looking to immediately buy a breakout over resistance ends up buying the exact top of a move when it happens to be a false breakout. The breakout trading strategy that I'll be explaining in the rest of this post will help you avoid buying any false breakouts!\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/cWvdaim](https://imgur.com/a/cWvdaim) \n\nInstead of immediately buying a breakout to new highs, you can substantially reduce your risk by waiting for the past breakout level, *or resistance,* to turn into **support**. As explained in past posts, broken resistance can become support, and broken support can become resistance. When a stock breaks above resistance, by waiting for that past resistance to become a level of support you're ensuring that you're not chasing the stock at its high during a false breakout. By trading breakouts this way you also now have a level of support to use for risk management. You can enter the trade knowing that your risk is limited because you'll cut losses if the stock comes back below its new support level.\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/AmRFjt2](https://imgur.com/a/AmRFjt2) \n\nAs you can see in the real life example below with the stock symbol $AMD, there was a breakout over a past high/past resistance level, and a long consolidation period over that past resistance, which then became a key level of support. There was plenty of time in this example to use that support as an opportunity to buy before it started its run to new highs. This happens much more commonly than you may think and can offer some incredible trading opportunities!\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/VoK1nmZ](https://imgur.com/a/VoK1nmZ)\n\n*Again,* using this breakout trading strategy will reduce your risk and will definitely reduce the amount of time that you catch yourself buying into a false breakout. The example of stock symbol $IMBI below shows you how dangerous it can be to buy into these false breakouts. $IMBI had resistance at $5.40 from the market's open, briefly broke above that resistance by only $0.03, came straight back down, and ended the day more than 20% lower than its early morning breakout level! By waiting for support to form over that $5.40 resistance, you'd be able to avoid buying into this false breakout trap.\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/EtaUYFY](https://imgur.com/a/EtaUYFY) \n\nI hope this post was helpful for any new traders that find themselves buying the top of a move too frequently! This strategy should prevent that from happening and should greatly help you improve your accuracy when trading stock breakouts! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFull blog: [https://masterthemarket.teachable.com/blog/208628/trading-stock-breakouts-avoiding-false-breakouts](https://masterthemarket.teachable.com/blog/208628/trading-stock-breakouts-avoiding-false-breakouts)",

        "selftext": "\nI wanted to see if WSB DD has any value, so I went through DD over the last quarter.\n\nTLDR: Small sample size. 12/19 posts were wrong, 7 were right or rightish.\n\nI searched for posts flaired DD over the last year sorted by upvotes, but due to the growth of the subreddit most examined posts are 2-3 months old. At first I searched only last 30 days, but there were not enough posts. I stopped looking at around 500 upvotes, below that is usually just news and shitposts.\n\nI tried to include only posts with clear positions, but I made some exceptions for posts with clear sentiment. I excluded positions still in play, low-effort posts and shitposts. I focused mainly on price at the expiration date, so some DD rated wrong could have been profitable if you sold early, although I tried to mention those posts. Posts are roughly sorted by upvotes.\n\nHere's breakdown of the posts I examined:\n\n**1)** https://ns.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fkpv5a/dd_5k_to_330k_in_3_weeks_ulta_is_my_next_move/\n\nDate posted: 3/18\n\nPositions: ULTA 4/17 $125 Put\n\nPrice the day of posting: $124 - $148\n\nResult: 4/17 $208 - $223\n\nVerdict: Wrong\n\n\n**2)** https://ns.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g4yxwg/the_people_that_made_the_most_money_during_the/\n\nDate posted: 4/21\n\nPositions: Already had VEEV 5/15 $190 calls \"and I plan to buy a few higher OTM calls with strikes later this year\" and TMO 6/16 $350 calls\n\nPrice the day of posting: VEEV $176; TMO $320\n\nResult: VEEV closed 5/15 at $200, TMO is at $375\n\nVerdict: VEEV call was correct, TMO call looks good although it is a month before expiry.\n\n\n**3)** https://ns.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gd01t7/serious_on_the_oil_demand_crisis_and_why_you/\n\nDate posted: 5/4\nPositions:\n\nLow Risk Position Examples\n\nEuroNav ($EURN) $12.50C 6/15\nScorpio Tankers ($STNG) $23C 6/15\n\nModerate Risk Positions\n\n$EURN $12.50C 5/15\n$STNG $25C 5/15\nHigher Risk Positions\n\n$EURN $15C 5/15\n$STNG $30C 5/15\n\nLegendary Autistic Risk Positions\n\n$EURN $17.50C 5/15\n$STNG $35C 5/15\n$NAT, any calls\n\nPrice the day of posting:\n\nNAT $5.92\nEURN $11.36 \nSTNG $23.25\n\nResults: \n\nNAT $5.03\nEURN $9.81\nSTNG $16.79\n\nVerdict: Wrong\n\n**4)** https://ns.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fh6u5p/dd_turned_5k_to_165k_in_3_weeks_heres_my_grand/\n   https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fi03cg/dd_yes_you_can_buy_puts_on_zillow_z_right_now/?amp%253Butm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp%253Butm_name=iossmf\n\nDate posted: 3/12; 3/13\n\nPositions: Z 3/20 $35 Puts, 3/20 $45 Puts and 4/17 $40 Puts\n\nPrice the day of posting: $33 - $40\n\nResults: 3/20 $26 - $31; 4/17 $36\n\nVerdict: Correct\n\n**5)** https://ns.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fiieap/heres_what_a_bunch_of_you_bulls_and_america_as_a/\n\nDate posted: 3/14\n\nPositions: Late April/Early May puts\n\nPrice the day of posting: 3/13 SPY $250 - $272\n\nResults: SPY moving between $272 and $293 during the specified time.\n\nVerdict: Wrong\n\n**6)** https://ns.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g9h9np/an_indepth_look_into_the_next_few_weeks/\n\nDate posted: 4/28\n\nPrice the day of posting: SPY $285 - $290\n\nPositions: If we end this week &lt; 272, SPY 270p 5/15.

        "selftext": "Intel is to release GPU this year. They are to officially enter the discrete GPU business. This will compress margins on amd and nvda. \n\nAmd is getting competitve against intel in CPU, esepcially with Zen 3 coming out. So intel's getting killed there as well. But in return AMD's gpu business, which despite the quality being much weaker than nvidia, still comprise 50% of the revenue, is about to be challenged by intel.\n\nAll 3 are threatend by cloud gaming as well, and perhaps cloud computing in the future. Cloud gaming will reduce PC/latop upgrade cycle even further. A 10 year old PC can run games flawlessly on Stadia and Geforce Now. Many people who otherwise would upgrade their PC now just purcahse cloud gaming subscription. cloud gaming seem to be growing extremely fast. \n\nNvidia do have the foresight so they set up GFN on their own. But it cannabilises its own GPU business. Better than let a competitor do it to Nvidia, but still not ideal. \n\nand then ARM is to threaten both intel and amd cpus. it soon will be good enough for general computing and it has lower power and cheaper to make. And combined with the trend of cloud computing it's esepcially deadly. With cloud gaming, you can easily play AAA games with demanding graphics settings in a browser, with a PC or mobile device powered only by ARM CPUs.  \n\nI just dont see good growth oppotunity for these 3 stocks in the near future. both amd and nvda have fat growth premium, how long will that last? intc is also going nowhere due to cpu market getting challenged.",

        "selftext": "I do write ups through out the week of current new and events affecting the market and trends. I summarize from multiple sources, if there's any glaring errors blame CNBC and Bloomberg.   \n\n\n**04/26 Bank Of Japan Stimulus -** The bank of Japan (BOJ) will be having a meeting 04/26 to discuss further stimulus for the Japanese economy and is expected to remove buying limits of government bonds, and increase purchases of commercial and corporate debt. Though it should be noted that Japanese corporations are considered to be better positioned to weather the shut down, compared to corporations in other countries. This is due in large part to the high amount of cash reserves Japanese corporations keep on hand. It is currently estimated that Japanese corporations have $4.8 trillion of cash in their reserves. This places them in an excellent position to not only maintain operations, but also make future financial investments during this downturn. In addition, a record amount of publicly traded companies have chosen to suspend dividend payments until the economy reopens. A loan program is said to be on the table as well for companies who are struggling with cash flow.\n\n**04/26 Deficit and Spending**\\- The US budget deficit is expected to increase to 3.7trillion for this period as US spending rises fighting the coronavirus while the economy contracts. The previously projected budget deficit for 2020 was 1.083 trillion. Since the start of the lockdowns in the US, GDP is believed to have contracted 3.9% for the first quarter and possibly as much as 40% for the second quarter.\n\nSteve Mnuchin on Sunday stated that we were \u201cIn a War\u201d and that \u201cEverything that needs to be done to support the economy will be done\u201d. He was encouraged by the fact that interest rates remain low between 0-.25% in the US, and believes that the US economy will \u201c...really bounce back in July, August, and September.\u201d\n\nMany economists remain concerned about the rising level of US debt, as treasury bond rates remain at record lows, worried that investor interest may wane on Treasury bonds. The current rate on the 10 year yield is .6%, 4X lower than it was a year ago when the yield was at 2.5%. Although, there has been an uptick in foreign interest for US Treasury bonds throughout Europe and Japan as they have seen their interest rates drop to negative levels. China is currently the largest buyer of US treasury bonds, and owns the largest amount of US debt measured at approximately 5%(1.07 Trillion). Under negative interest rates, people and businesses would actually have to pay the banks to store their money rather than make any passive income from interest payments.\n\nEven before Covid19 shut down the US economy, massive spending has been a concern for many economists, as our spending has far outpaced economic growth since the last recession. Post 2009 Federal spending was kept between 2-3% as to not outpace the growth of the economy. During the Great Recession, spending on economic stimulus and overseas wars caused US spending to balloon to 24% of GDP, greatly adding to our debt at a much faster rate than previously. After the Great Recession spending was never reduced back to previous levels, instead the government began withdrawing funding from government funded organizations such as the military and medicare. A practice known as sequestering.\n\nIt\u2019s impossible to know the full range of consequences that the US will face due to its additional massive spending combating Covid19 but it is generally agreed upon that eventually taxes will have to increase, and the US may face the possibility of another credit downgrade if our debt remains unchecked.  The US saw its first credit downgrade two years after the end of the Great Recession in 2011.\n\n\\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n04/27  **Oil Markets -** Oil had a rough Monday to start off the week. At the time of this writing June contracts for WTI are down 23% and trading at $13 a barrel. The popular oil index USO is also down 15% trading at $2.17. The two seem to be correlated as USO announces that they have begun offloading their June contracts out of fear those contracts would turn negative. The CME futures exchange has begun regulating the amount of contracts USO will be allowed to hold, warning them not to exceed their limits. This was done in an effort to prevent large unnecessary swings in the price of oil that do not reflect market conditions. Despite regulations supply still outpaces demand, and storage is also becoming an increasing worry for the oil producers. It is estimated about 85% of the world oils reserves are full at the moment. Producers are trying to come up with storage solutions by storing oil on tankers and possibly in pipelines as storage space disappears.\n\n\\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n04/28 **Food Chain and Earnings** \\- Trump intends to use the defense production act to keep food processing plants open to prevent disruptions in the food supply chain. Many processing plants have shut down, threatening to reduce the US meat processing capacity by 80%.\n\nA flood of loan applications continues to crash the SBA website as bankers attempt to submit many applications on behalf of their clients. After the initial $342 billion was loaned out in less than 2 weeks, an additional $310 billion was approved by congress to loan out to small businesses who were unable to receive aid during the first round of loans. It is predicted that the SBA will quickly loan out the additional $310 billion as well.\n\n$GOOG beat on revenue causing their share price to jump around 8% during AH to above despite seeing a decrease in their ad revenue. $F reported a loss of 2 Billion for the previous quarter and predicted rough times ahead for the auto-industry. Shares fell greater than 5% during AH. AMD, SBUX also reported earnings during after market close and were trading lower during the after hours session.\n\n$UBER announced after the market closed that they were planning on laying off 20% of their workforce. This is a little bit of speculation here, but I\u2019d imagine California, New York, and Las Vegas all contribute greatly to Uber's revenue. Seeing how New York and California have extended lock downs throughout May, and Las Vegas workers do not feel safe returning to work despite the mayor pushing them to do so, Ubers main markets have been hit the hardest and will be closed the longest giving Uber a very bleak outlook.\n\n\\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n04/29 **Gilead &amp; The Fed -** Gilead was halted during pre-market trading hours while they made an announcement that their target goal had been achieved during their patient study for the drug remedesivir. This was a study including over a 1000 patients in multiple countries that showed patients on the drug recovered faster than those in the placebo group. Trump is now looking to the FDA to fast track the approval of the drug. $GILD ended the trading day 5% higher at $83.\n\nJerome Powell announced that the Fed will be keeping interest rates unchanged at 0-.25% and stated that interest rates will remain unchanged until he is confident the economy is nursed back to health. He stated that \u201cQ2 economic numbers will be the worst we\u2019ve seen in history\u201d and it will be a long recovery back to pre-covid 19 levels.\n\nMSFT, TSLA, FB all reported positive earnings after the bell causing their stock price to rise during after hours trading.\n\n\\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n04/30 **Unemployment &amp; PMI** \\- Unemployment numbers were reported to be at 3.83M which is a decline from the previous reported number last week, bringing the total number of unemployed to above 30 million. The highest unemployment number reported thus far was 6.87 for the last week of March 28th, and has been in decline every week since. Chicago announced a PMI of 35.4 which was their lowest PMI number since 2009. The 10 year treasury note is trending downward back towards its all time low of .54%\n\n\\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n04/30 **Trump &amp; China -** Trump has stepped up his blame against China for the Corona Virus saying that they will face consequences for the damage it has caused. It is reported that possible sanctions, cancelling of US debt obligations, and new trade agreements were all being considered. This could potentially shake up investor confidence in a market that had previously rallied off of a trade agreement between the US and China earlier in the year.\n\nUS intelligence agencies are currently trying to determine if the virus had actually originated from the Wuhan Virology Center, and not the wet markets as China claims. Epidemiologist have thus far been unable to trace the virus back to a wet market adding to the suspicion that it was spread by an infected employee at the lab. Although it is important to note that scientists had determined Covid 19 was not man made, nor was it altered in a lab, often viruses are merely studied in Virology centers. Australia has also called out China and is asking for transparency and cooperation from the nation to determine the origins of the virus. China has responded by telling Australia they will \u201creduce economic cooperation with Australia\u201d if they continue to mount pressure against China.\n\nIn regards to repercussions against China, Mike Pompeo said \u201cTiming is important.\u201d Due to the fragile state of both economies, China could harm the US economy just as easily as we could harm theirs. In addition, the US &amp; China have been sharing resources such as ventilators, testing equipment, and personal protective gear in an effort to regain control and fight Covid 19.\n\nAdding another layer of uncertainty to the world, Kim Jong-Un has yet to be seen since April 11th and many unconfirmed reports have come out about his health and possible location. There is some belief that Kim suffered a heart attack and is currently in a vegitative state and reports that Chinese medical team was dispatched to North Korea at some point during April. Other theories point to the leader simply being at one of his resorts likely hiding away from the public until the Covid 19 crisis is over. Although there has yet to be a single reported case of Covid 19 in North Korea.\n\n \\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n05/01 **Elon, Fannie Mae, PMI Oh My -** \u201cSell in May and Go Away\u201d proved true for the first of the month, as stocks sold off particularly hard due to reignited fears of Trump imposing tariffs on trade with China. Heading into the last hours of trading, all indexes are lower by greater than 2% with the Nasdaq down greater than 3%. PMI data for the month of April was also released this morning, ISM PMI was reported to be at 41.5 which is a decrease from March (49.1) indicating a further contraction of the economy. \n\nIn the mortgage market, there are about 3.8million mortgages in forbearance which accounts for nearly 8% of all US mortgages. This is equivalent to about 841 billion in unpaid principal. Fannie May believes this number could double in the coming months if the economy does not reopen and unemployment continues to rise. Out of all the Mortgage lenders, the Federal housing and Veterans administration had the highest level of homes in forbearance (10%) which doesn\u2019t come as too much of a shock as they offer loans to individuals with low credit scores and allow them to place a smaller down payment.\n\nAfter the market closed, the FDA granted emergency use authorization for the use of Remdesivir to treat Covid19 patients. Gilead has had a wild ride over the past two weeks due to conflicting information in their patient test trials, yet the general consensus at the moment is that Remdesivir has an obvious beneficial effects in treating Covid patients. \n\nJCrew joins the list of the companies expected to file for bankruptcy, and analysts believe many more bankruptcies will be on the way once liquidity starts drying up for more companies. TSLA which reported better than expected earnings this week, is obviously not going bankrupt, yet Elon oddly seemed to think their stock was over performing. After making comments today that the price of TSLA stock was too high, TSLA dropped from roughly $760 to a low of $686 before closing the day at $701 per share. For once, Elon seems to be on the side of the short sellers.",

        "selftext": "Aloha fellow autists, for those already looking for positions, TL;DR will be at the end of the ~~post~~ wall of text; but before getting to positions I would like to lay forth my Med-LT projections for the course of the S&amp;P 500/NASDAQ &amp; approximations of what I believe to be as a 'healthy bottom' in the markets following the global deleveraging which is currently underway. \n\n\\*Note- I won't be diving very deep into the fundamentals in this post for the sake of trimming fat off of the data &amp; analysis; but for those interested in my PoV of the fundamentals which I build my projections on, reference this post/give it a quick read - [Economic Stagflation, Financial Corruption, Dying Industries, and a Need to Revolutionize](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/fvjlin/economic_stagnation_financial_corruption_dying/).\\*\n\n**Scope of Long-Term Projections (S&amp;P/NASDAQ)**\n\nFirst, to present the scope of my S&amp;P projection. First [the monthly chart](https://gyazo.com/f3e617e61dfa22c6761d0d679339fb52), then a [Daily Chart](https://gyazo.com/c268b3d7c1f7d80d436b7e5a6a1cdfdc) of a 1-0 fib-retracement back down to the highs of the 2000 dotcom bubble &amp; 2007 GFC. The 1 level (peak price) was put in place under the notion that major investor confidence had peaked in US markets the week of Jan 17th's opening price of \\~3335 at the start of this 'corona-virus black-swan event'/as the first case had been reported in the US via mainstream media, and with the belief we will be finding a true bottom around the highs of the 2000 'dotcom bubble' (\\~1555 on the S&amp;P.)\n\n\\*Note, these projections coincide with the parameters of 'Economic Stagnation' which I talk about in my 'fundamentals' post. To briefly outline a major point in the post, acknowledging that we find the genuine basis of a secular bull markets around the peak of our last run when forced into genuine innovation to produce economic productivity (While also respecting the reality that fiscal policies can/will send us into over-reactionary runs in either direction - IE: 2029 High following the roaring 20's, the following Great Depression's Low.... the 2020 High....)\\*\n\nI also mentioned the [NASDAQ](https://gyazo.com/27bfaa75f69057117f18ea0539301349) early on -Which  I've charted with the same exact 'scope,' being the time-line/High&amp;Low points. Imo this index even more than the S&amp;P truly showcases the over-reactive nature of the markets, investor greed/FOMO, and the impact of modern active fiscal policies on natural market movement/the 'precision' of Elliott wave theory. In my eyes, confirming the 5K low-projection as a significant price point in the past; which can be seen [on the daily chart](https://gyazo.com/4fe4b44e3da32cf0883cae330f63e557) as confirmed resistance/'the highs' in 2000, and also note the interaction with the 5k price point [on the monthly chart](https://gyazo.com/2ed7218fcc75e3cec9aa7f7b8296352d) from 2015-17 (seen as resistance for the most of 2015 with an 'island top' pattern which then collapsed below before breaking out and back-testing as support in late 2016.)\n\nTo briefly discuss the timeline of these retracements,  (starting on January 1st 2020 and ending on July 1st 2021) I believe this crash/harship will somehow give the groundwork for our gov't to feed some kind of \"America 2.0\" recovery program \\~July 2021. Seriously, what better time to push such a propaganda piece other than the month we celebrate our country's independence? As for the starting date of this retracement; January 1st was the first public release from the WHO discussing 'A cluster of cases have emerged of a mysterious pneumonia,\" and thus \n\n**The Path of These Projections/Calculation of Targets**\n\nNext, to present the projected path(s) of this deleveraging I'm using E.W.T. to draw rough price targets on the S\\&amp;P; this is analysis under the belief that Elliott Wave Theory still holds a level of accuracy despite modern active fiscal policy intervention in the markets/economically. I'm viewing this price action as a '[Down-trending impulse wave](https://gyazo.com/f77bc5e3d987095ca54addb9f2f1f213).' For Those that don't care about the explanation of the technical's and just want a cut and dry projection minus all the gibberish below - [Here](https://gyazo.com/05998bb307c8277d633419f9c973a704).\n\nThe first Fib is the same retracement from above, just labeled as 'LT Corrective Wave' since that's ultimately what I'm viewing this move as, (A LT Correction in the debt cycle.) The Second Fib is actually the length of Wave 1 from tip to tail to show's that our relief rally (Wave 2) has behaved to E.W.T. within reason thus far and would be confirmed as wave 2 considering we've rejected breaking above the .382 retracement level (or in other words have maxed out at bull momentum \\~0.618 the length of Wave 1). Next (and note that following last week I believe we have just entered) is Fib/Wave 3 - Wave 3 is the longest wave in the series and is ultimately to be at least 1.618 the length of Wave 1 (doesn't mean it has to be in a crash lol, it could be very very drawn out.) Wave 4 will then be another relief rally .5 the length of Wave 1. Followed by Wave 5 which I have drawn as .618 the length of Wave 1 (It very well could be shorter, that will be a discussion for a later time once we can better understand any news/media catalysts at play.) Then we have corrective waves A,B,C which ultimately in my eyes will lay forth the groundwork for the genuine beginnings of our next secular bull market. \\*Note, if you've made it this far and understand what I'm saying then you also understand that this outcome is one derivative of 72 potential outcomes given that we are still so early in the move.\n\n\\*I would also like to note that given the circumstances of the global economy in the Med-LT this creates an extremely bullish case for gold &amp; silver, gold should've been a no brainer to pick up following it's pull-back caused by the liquidity crisis in early March. I believe if we see the economic contraction which I had set-forth then spot gold could easily be pushing $3k around the time our markets are finding bottom. Silver traditionally will also act similarly to gold given circumstances around fiat currencies, however silver tends to act on a slight delay relative to gold in this regard. \n\n**Short Term Movement / What to Watch This Week**\n\n[S&amp;P](https://gyazo.com/344ea72b3f8edf40894c9b198e55c33c)/General Markets - Similarly to last week, I'm writing this as the futures open with a gap up and proceed for to push upwards of about 1% green. The DXY has created huge support and appears ready for a breakout, gold is trading higher than friday's close, in my opinion, all of which are signals similar to what we had seen in late February warning us to start to consider exiting the markets. I'm expecting early upwards movement in the markets to push up enough for one more test this downtrend line seen on the Fib-entrancement before once again rolling over to significant downside &amp; finally breaking down below this H&amp;S neckline for good (Targeting \\~270 EoW/mid-late week.) To give an even tighter projection on when I believe the markets will experience significant downside again,  I would like to show this 1 hour chart of the [H&amp;S formation](https://gyazo.com/deee92a5b8070f9bb4cfa7fb2ed37f63). So. Much. Selling. Pressure... Seriously, this thing is riddled with red dildos.  At best I believe the MM's will be able to push the markets upwards of a 2895 back-test at most before rolling over going into the second half of the trading day on Monday (\\~ 2-4PM trading time-frame.)\n\n[$XLF](https://gyazo.com/5f1e7a69a2edbaa85b48906d3d0d76be) Called out the broken H&amp;S pattern in my post last week &amp; claimed it to be a leading indicator for the general markets direction, I believe the same will continue to prove true moving forward. That said, looking for an entry on June 19th $18p during AM-lunch trading session (whenever the S&amp;P pushing near the 289-290 range, which could push to as close to \\~21.50 as on XLF I would say.) \n\n[$AMD](https://gyazo.com/461a4f07a758e37064a338d080929dc2) \\- I've been catching a fair amount of flack for calling out AMD as a short for the three weeks now, but had anyone taken the chance on taking positions near the resistance levels I was calling out then they would've been able to play these massive movements while consistently rolling profits into later dated contracts. Executives have been dumping their shares of stock left and right since leading up to and following their ER release, I wouldn't be surprised if the company knows their growth is going to be stunted for at least 4 quarters if not longer (Let's not forget the 190 PE ratio the damn stock is trading at based on current share price and Q1 EPS.....) AMD $40p June 19th &amp; $20p Oct 16th\n\n[$GDX](https://gyazo.com/f398759a085855ffc19ceabbef128336) \\- I'm pissed I didn't have the funds to act on this play before the markets ran up end of week giving the gold miners a heaftyyy run. That said, I believe this will prevail as a parabolic play through the rest of the year as gold miners are just only now returning to their 'fair value' and look ready for an over-reactionary  pop like in the early 2010's. I'm also bullish asf on spot gold price given the current economic circumstances and considering we're actually in a very interesting position with gold. Bears kept claiming \"gold miners will be shut down due to CV blah blah,\" but that was bullish for spot gold price. Anyone that wants to buy physical gold right now is paying between $100-150/oz more than spot in the futures due to this fact. I honestly believe spot gold price could push to kiss 3k come summer 2021. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR - Magic Crayon Lines &amp; witchcraft elude to markets bottom \\~July 2021... XLF - $18p June 19th Exp, AMD - $40p June19th &amp; $20p Oct 16th, GDX $50c July 17th",

        "selftext": " \n\nHi\n\nI recently decided to get into investing and trading. I was looking at a few services to help understand and grow quickly in both fields. I tried the IBD newsletter for the last few weeks. I also decided to try Marketsmith and this is where I saw something odd. I was using IBD for chart pattern identification and help me develop and understand technical analysis&gt; I planeed to use it as a crutch to make some money and understand CANSlim faster. They weekly release stocks near buy zone wherein they tell you a list of stocks that are about to breakout of the cup and handle pattern and at what price should you get in.\n\nNow market smith is another product that is far more expensive at $150 a month and also gives you a set of stocks that are near their buypoint. A list of stocks that have broken out and are fast approcahing their sell price. It also gives you a lot of rating and fundamental data with a click of a button.\n\n1. The first glaring difference is in terms of the stock lists which are very different. The ones posted on the IBD newsletter seem to go nowhere or move very slowly. Currently AMD has been on the list forever. And AMD is not the only stock as most if not all stock on the Stocks to By list havent broken out or breakout over weeks. Market smith on the other hand actually gave recommendations every day and has had multiple stocks breakout per day basis. In short you will get realy slow moving or low priority information on the newletter compared to marketsmith.\n2. Now last night there was an article to get into Paypal on the IBD newletter as it had the potential of going further for those who missed out and add for those who followed the original recommendation, but on MarketSmith you have reached the sell zone. So in short the newsletter subscribers will buy into the stock while the Marketsmith users will sell and rake in the profits. Now this remind me of the pump and dump schemes that flow around penny stocks. Ofcourse since its a company like Paypal your downside is heavily protected but just looking at the quality of information provided feels like a scam\n3. The really infuriating portion is that they actually charge a decent amount of money for their newsletter/ site access. It feels like you pay for gettind second hand and second quality information.\n\nAs for the fundamental analysis Mornigstar offers amazing indepth reports on the stocks they follow for a fraction of the price.\n\nFor IBD list of growth stocks I believe there is an ETF from where you can get the list.\n\nAll in all I believe if you want to use IBD, Marketsmith is the way. Although I have not tried their other products like Swingtrader or Leaderboard.",

I have been looking at AMD and Intel and they look good since AMD will be backing the GPU and CPU for the next generation of consoles. But I also heard about how Livongo will make me a huge profit in 10-20 years, but I'm not too sure about anything yet. Please give me any recommendations and advice, thanks!",
