        "selftext": "$DXC is an IT provider like Accenture, Cognizant, Infosys that fell by the way side. Previous management sucked. Too many managers and service quality was poor - both fixable issues. \n\nNew CEO of DXC Mike Salvino was second in command at Accenture. He is rightsizing, divesting non-core parts and fixing the service quality. \n\nACN has 44B of revenue and 125B market cap. \n\nDXC has 18B of revenue and 12B market cap. \n\nThis is his second conference call, the previous one(first one) he outlined changes but he had just started and there were no results yet as he had just started.

This gives them diversity and allows them to have clientele even in a pandemic, most notably with their healthcare, public sector and banking solutions. As I'm writing this I believe that their assets make them somewhat undervalued at $14, and as they have earnings 05/28 there may be room for a run up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**VALUE**\n\nAccording to their website they maintain 100 million health records, provide services for 15,000 healthcare and life sciences professionals and have over 1 million users of their software and systems products. Primarily they appear to provide administration products to healthcare providers and use Microsoft cloud to implement some of their products. More importantly they aim to reduce time-to-market and accelerate drug development, one of the main challenges facing COViD-19 drug manufacturers.\n\nIn their public sector business, they provide a management service to companies for AWS, Azure, VMware, Oracle and Google cloud platforms to  \"enable companies to focus on their strategic priorities while shifting the burden and expense of building and managing an hybrid cloud infrastructure\". Their website also shows:\n\n* 800+ managed cloud customers\n* Experts in complex, enterprise-scale transformation\n* 20,000+ Microsoft professionals/Microsoft Certified Solution Provider\n* 1,000+ AWS professionals/AWS Premier Consulting Partner\n* Managed services for Azure, AWS, VMware, Oracle, Google &amp; more\n* Full-stack Platform as a Service for SAP\n\nIn terms of their banking subset, they operate in over 70 countries, have processed in excess of 80 million payment accounts and service 250 million mortgages. They also provide security and analytics using AI and automation, for example helping NatWest, a major RBS group UK bank, move to image-based cheque-clearing.\n\nThese are a few examples of some of their operating industries but if you want to see more visit the website, I'm not doing all the work for you.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Partners**\n\nThis is just a short section but they have over 200+ partners, showing potential for a wide customer base, a few are:\n\n* AT&amp;T (cloud services)\n* AWS\n* Google Cloud\n* Microsoft\n* HP\n* Dell\n* IBM\n\n**Financial Performance**\n\nNow this is where it gets a bit tricky. All credit to u/fuzzyblankeet and Co. but no matter how many times I've smashed my head into their financials I still struggle to understand them. I'm gonna need some help with this bit from you guys in the comments.\n\n|Fiscal Quarter|Date reported|EPS forecast|EPS actual|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Q4 2019|02/06/2020|1.08|1.25|\n|Q3 2019|11/11/2019|1.44|1.38|\n|Q2 2019|08/08/2019|1.71|1.74|\n|Q1 2019|05/23/2019|2.07|2.19|\n\n\\*^(According to Nasdaq.com)\n\nI don't know why EPS seems to decrease every quarter despite them having what I consider to be a strong business model, however I will link their financials [here](https://www.dxc.technology/investor_relations/ds/140309-dxc_financial_reports) if the more experienced among you want to give feedback.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nI just wanted your opinion on whether this is a good trade for earnings next week as I'm looking for something to replace VTIQ as a money maker, I want them to go up more but need something less volatile.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TLDR: If you're coming to me for financial advice there's no hope.**\n\nAlso was looking at [Marvell Technology](https://www.marvell.com/) as they seem to be making moves in 5G and cloud computing, so feel free to feedback on that if you want to have a look.
