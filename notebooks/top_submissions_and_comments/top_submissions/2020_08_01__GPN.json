        "selftext": "Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading month ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning August 3rd, 2020.\n\n# **Earnings and fiscal debate could be catalysts for stocks in the week ahead  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/31/the-jobs-report-and-congressional-politics-may-matter-more-for-markets-than-earnings-in-the-week-ahead.html)**\n*****\n&gt; The market could lose some of its exuberance in the week ahead as the calendar turns to August, and investors await Friday\u2019s July employment report and keep their eyes on Washington.\n*****\n&gt; The focus will also be squarely on politicians, as Congress struggles to find a middle ground on a new fiscal spending package and decide the fate of the $600 a week unemployment supplement that was set to expire July 31. Former vice president Joe Biden is also expected to name his running mate in the coming week.\n*****\n&gt; The jobs data will be crucial, particularly since the number of people filing for unemployment benefits has been edging higher, instead of falling back, as expected. According to Refinitiv, about 1.36 million new jobs are expected, well below the 4.8 million added in June, and the unemployment rate is expected to fall to 10.7% from 11.1%.\n*****\n&gt; Trading around the report could be volatile, since some economists expect more than 2 million jobs were added, and some even see flat or negative payrolls.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks have done well for the month of July, with the S&amp;P 500 finishing at 3,271, a gain of 5.5%. The Nasdaq has performed the best, rising 6.8% for the month to 10,745, after a 3.7% gain for the past week.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cAugust has traditionally been a challenging month for investors,\u201d said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA. The market is entering what historically has been the worst two months for stocks.\n*****\n&gt; According to Stovall, the S&amp;P 500 has been higher in August 53% of the time, and its average move is a gain of just 0.01%, going back to World War II. September is worse, down 0.51% on average, and up just 48% of the time.\n*****\n&gt; In presidential election years, however the odds for August gains are better, as it rose 63% of the time and 73%, when the incumbent is up for re-election.\n*****\n&gt; There are also about 120 S&amp;P 500 companies reporting earnings, but the big earnings show for markets was this past week when four of the five biggest tech giants all reported Thursday afternoon. Three of those stocks \u2014 Apple, Amazon and Facebook \u2014 surged, helping Nasdaq outperform Friday with a more than 1.5% gain.\n*****\n&gt; # Earnings scorecard\n&gt; \u201cWe\u2019re only a month into the reporting period, and things are going to become less and less important from an earnings perspective,\u201d said Stovall. \u201cI think investors are sort of disappointed in that the bar was set so low for second quarter earnings that expectations were that we were going to see a lot of companies beat, which we have. But we were also going to see a gradual uplift of earnings expectations for forward quarters. We\u2019re not seeing that.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Eighty-two percent of the companies reporting so far have beaten estimates, well above the average 65%, according to Refinitiv. The earnings decline is now looking closer to 33% from an initial 40%, and tech, which has been leading the market is one of the best performers. Profits for the sector now look to be up 1.4%, according to I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv.\n*****\n&gt; Because the tech names have contributed so much to market gains, their earnings were an important test for the market, and they didn\u2019t disappoint. But they didn\u2019t manage to pull up the whole market very far on Friday.\n*****\n&gt; Among the names reporting in the coming week are a diverse group, including Disney, ViacomCBS, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Berkshire Hathaway, AIG, Clorox, and Wayfair, to name a few.\n*****\n&gt; # Politics now in play\n&gt; \u201cThe earnings story is over. My call had been once we had gotten through the earnings season, we would be more vulnerable to a sustainable pullback,\u201d said Barry Knapp, Ironside Macroeconomics managing partner and director of research. \u201cObviously, it\u2019s volatility season, but it\u2019s also an election year. ... We\u2019re more vulnerable to that next week and earnings won\u2019t hold us up.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Knapp said if President Donald Trump and Republicans do not begin to perform better in the polls by Labor Day, the market is likely to focus on what a Democratic win would mean for taxes and regulation. That could be a negative for stocks.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIf he hasn\u2019t made headway by then, it\u2019s likely he\u2019s done.That\u2019s about the point when things become pretty set in stone. The market will presume that\u2019s the case,\u201d Knapp said.\n*****\n&gt; The politics of the stimulus package could also reverberate through markets, until it looks like the Senate Republicans and House Democrats can find common ground.\n*****\n&gt; The two sides look to be at a standoff, but an agreement is still expected in early August. The market is particularly watching to see what happens with the enhanced unemployment benefits. Republicans have proposed cutting it to $200, but Democrats support keeping it.\n*****\n&gt; # The economy\n&gt; Cutting the size of the payments back might be good for the labor market and persuade more workers to return to work, some strategists say. However, there is also concern that the funding has helped stimulate the economy and keep the unemployed from defaulting on loans and payments. Consumer spending on goods in June was even higher than last year, and that was also seen as getting a lift from stimulus.\n*****\n&gt; Besides the jobs report, there are other important data like ISM manufacturing on Monday. There are also monthly vehicle sales Monday, and ISM nonmanufacturing data Wednesday.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think the macro data is going to be fine next week,\u201d said Knapp. \u201cI\u2019m not in the camp that thinks the payroll number is going to be negative.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; NatWest Markets economist Kevin Cummins is one of the economists who expects the jobs gains to be much smaller than the past two months. He expects the payrolls to come in at just 200,000. \u201cYou look at jobless claims, and you see a stalling out,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Fed is right. There is significant downside risk to the economy.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # A trade to watch\n&gt; Treasury yields, in the 2-year to 7-year range, fell to new lows in the past week. The 10-year yield, not yet at a record low, was also falling and was at 0.53% Friday. At the same time, the dollar was down more than 1% on the week and 4% for the month.\n*****\n&gt; Gold was a beneficiary of the lower interest rates, weaker dollar trade, rising about 5% for the week and 10% for the month.\n*****\n&gt; Strategist say investors are reacting to super-low interest rates, concerns about the economy, and the possibility that huge government spending will send inflation higher.\n*****\n&gt; Investors are also jumping into inflation-protected bonds. According to Refinitiv\u2019s Lipper, inflation-protected bond funds took in $271 million of net new money for the fund-flows week ended July 29, the sixth week of gains. About $1 billion went into the SPDR Gold Shares ETF, (GLD) in the last week, Lipper said.\n*****\n&gt; During this time period, the Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities funds recorded their two best weekly net inflows ever with increases of $1.9 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively, for the fund-flows weeks of June 24 and July 1.\n*****\n&gt; Lipper said investors started to put money into TIPS funds in the middle of the second quarter, and the flows have been . net positive in 11 out of 13 weeks since the beginning of May. This its second-worst quarterly net outflows ever as oil prices slumped in the first quarter.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think this is going to be a much more inflationary decade. It will start out slowly. [Fed Chairman Jerome] Powell is right that more forces are putting downward pressure on inflation at present. But the market looks past that,\u201d said Knapp. \u201cThe big story in 2021 will be the recovery of inflation. You\u2019re already seeing it in import prices.\u201d\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/Vu3udbe.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/h0BBbe1.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/LKORgeK.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.postimg.cc/MZnSQFC8/econcal1.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/LhH7odo.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/p9QIWyG.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/HmN0IBf.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/ZlnNJZU.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/wvkv3FfP/er83720.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/vu4Bq8q.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/kKZeaRL.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/O6zeqaG.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/SkGddqX.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/5XLqRrO.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #5!](https://i.imgur.com/zl5gQpo.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # August: Top NASDAQ &amp; Russell 2000 Month of Election Years\n\n&gt; August is amongst the worst months of the year. It is the worst DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ, Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 month over the last 32 years, 1988-2019 with average declines ranging from 0.1% by NASDAQ to 1.1% by DJIA.\n\n&gt; Contributing to this poor performance since 1987; the second shortest bear market in history (45 days) caused by turmoil in Russia, the Asian currency crisis and the Long-Term Capital Management hedge fund debacle ending August 31, 1998 with the DJIA shedding 6.4% that day. DJIA dropped a record 1344.22 points for the month, off 15.1%\u2014which is the second worst monthly percentage DJIA loss since 1950. Saddam Hussein triggered a 10.0% slide in August 1990. The best DJIA gains occurred in 1982 (11.5%) and 1984 (9.8%) as bear markets ended. Sizeable losses in 2010, 2011, 2013 and 2015 of over 4% on DJIA have widened Augusts\u2019 average decline.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/e8afe7e1e8656f8b9beeaf3291cf8f62/02ca1964ef3531ea-f0/s400x600/77f035157f33a261b7608dc9cc36fc09a768f385.jpg))**\n\n&gt; However, in election years since 1950, Augusts\u2019 rankings improve: #6 DJIA, #5 S&amp;P 500, #1 NASDAQ (since 1971), #1 Russell 1000 and #1 Russell 2000 (since 1979). This year, the market\u2019s performance in August will likely depend heavily on how July closes and whether or not the rate of covid-19 infection continues to accelerate which could force some areas to roll back reopenings.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # August\u2019s First Trading Day Bearish Last 23 Years\n\n&gt; From the Stock Trader\u2019s Almanac 2020 (page 88), it is known that the first trading days of each month combined gain nearly as much as all other days combined. However, the first trading day of August does not contribute to this phenomenon ranking worst among other First Trading Days in the 2020 Almanac. In the past 23 years DJIA has risen just 30.4% (up 7, down 16) of the time on the first trading day of August. Average and median losses are on the mild side due to a few sizable advances. Over the past nine years, DJIA and S&amp;P 500 have both declined nine times.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/8f6234b8e365d9e861563b4d5b2efa5d/42d5f6b50757b324-8c/s500x750/6269fe4480533724c565c9852bf543a4c59ea172.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # S&amp;P 500 Stronger Underneath the Surface\n\n&gt; Earlier today we posted a chart showing S&amp;P 500 sector performance since the Nasdaq's recent peak on 7/20 when Technology stocks began what has now been a 10-day period of consolidation. Below we have updated these performance numbers to include today's moves. While not as many sectors remain in positive territory, the majority of sectors continue to outperform the S&amp;P 500, while Technology drags the market lower. Along with Technology, Communication Services, and Consumer Discretionary are the only other sectors that have lagged the S&amp;P 500, and their performance has been dragged down by the mega-cap tech-like stocks of Alphabet (GOOGL), Facebook (FB), and Amazon (AMZN).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/07/073020-Sector-Performance.png))**\n\n&gt; Expanding on this theme of underlying strength in the index, the chart below shows the average performance of stocks in the S&amp;P 500 grouped by sector. On an equal-weighted basis, the S&amp;P 500 is actually up 1.3% since 7/20, and only two sectors (Technology and Materials) have seen negative average returns. On the upside, Real Estate (4.1%) has been the big winner followed by Consumer Discretionary (3.3%), and Consumer Staples (2.2%). The fact that Consumer Discretionary at the cap-weighted sector level is down over 1.4% while the average performance of stocks in the sector has been a gain of 3.3% illustrates what a mammoth impact AMZN has on that sector.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/07/073020-Sector-Performance-Avg.png))**\n\n&gt; Breadth among S&amp;P 500 stocks has also been overwhelmingly positive. For the S&amp;P 500 as a whole, 59% of stocks in the index have had positive returns since the close on 7/20. Only two sectors (Technology and Materials) have seen fewer than half of their components post positive returns over that time, while Real Estate, Consumer Staples, and Utilities have seen roughly three-quarters of their components rally since 7/20.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/07/073020-Sector-Performance-Percent-Up1.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Bullish Earnings Season So Far\n\n&gt; At our Earnings Explorer tool available to clients on our website, we provide a real-time look at beat rates for both EPS and sales. Below is a snapshot from the website showing both the EPS and sales beat rates for US companies reporting earnings on a rolling 3-month basis. Currently, 64.61% of companies have exceeded consensus analyst EPS estimates over the last three months, while 63.75% of companies have beaten consensus sales estimates over the same time frame.\n\n&gt; In looking at the chart, you can see a big spike in the EPS beat rate over the last few weeks. Since earnings season began on July 13th, nearly 80% of companies have posted stronger than expected EPS numbers. That's a huge beat rate and suggests that analysts were too bearish on Q2 numbers heading into July. The revenue beat rate held up much better than EPS beats throughout the first half of 2020, but it too is on the upswing this season.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/07/epssales.png))**\n\n&gt; We also monitor how share prices are reacting to earnings reports. So far this earnings season, the average stock that has reported Q2 numbers has gained 1.31% on its earnings reaction day. That compares to a historical average one-day change of just 0.06% on earnings reaction days. As shown below, stocks that have beaten EPS estimates this season have gained 2.2% on earnings reaction days, while companies that have missed EPS estimates have fallen 1.89%. It's rare to see beats gaining more than misses decline, but that's what is happening this season.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/07/eps.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # China Running Away YTD\n\n&gt; Every Wednesday, we publish our Global Macro Dashboard which provides a high-level summary of market and economic data of some of the world's largest economies. Of the 23 stock markets tracked, just six including the US are positive year to date at the moment (in local currency). In the chart below we show the YTD performance of these six countries as well as the global median in 2020. As shown, even though it was actually the first to tip into the green YTD following the global sell-off in February and March very briefly back in early June, the US is up the least of this group with a YTD gain of 0.4%. China's stock market is up the most at +14%. Taiwan, South Korea, South Africa, and Malaysia are also outperforming the US but are up more modestly than China with the best of these, Taiwan, gaining 4.53% this year. Meanwhile, the median country in our Global Macro Dashboard remains down 6.2% YTD.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/07/072920-GMD-ytd.png))**\n\n&gt; Given it is up the most on a year to date basis, China has also gained the largest share of global equity market cap in 2020. As shown in the table below, China has gained 1.7 percentage points of global market cap in 2020 and now takes up 10.14%. China now joins the US as the only other country with a double-digit share of total world market cap. Despite this, China has actually lost share since the bear market lows on 3/23. Meanwhile, the US, Germany, Canada, India, South Korea, and Australia have all gained a significant share since 3/23.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/07/072920-Mkt-Cap-World.png))**\n\n&gt; # Do the Top 5 Stocks Pose a Risk to the Market?\n\n&gt; Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Google, and Facebook. These five stocks have helped spawn a number of acronyms as they try to capture the rise of mega-cap tech stocks that have led the market higher for much of the past decade. The average return for those five stocks so far this year has been a gain of more than 30%, while the broad S&amp;P 500 Index is just marginally positive, at 0.4% through July 30.\n\n&gt; While many other areas of the market have remained largely static, the total market value of these stocks has dramatically increased, making them an increasingly large piece of market cap-weighted indexes such as the S&amp;P 500. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the combined weight of the top five stocks in the S&amp;P 500 has increased to its highest level ever, at nearly 22%. Only one of those five stocks (Microsoft) was a top five name in the index during the previous peak of March 2000.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/7.31.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; But does this pose a risk to the index? From a diversification standpoint, one could certainly argue it does. For instance, if any shared risks should come up, from regulation, for example, it could do outsized damage to cap-weighted indexes. However, we believe that the recent gains have been justified by the fundamentals, and we continue to favor both large caps over small caps, and growth-style stocks over value stocks. According to analysis from Credit Suisse, over the past 12 months, the top five stocks in the index have grown revenues at 11.2% vs. just 0.8% for the rest of the S&amp;P 500. Further, the remainder of the S&amp;P 500 has subtracted roughly $17 from S&amp;P 500 earnings per share (EPS), while the top five stocks have added more than $12.\n\n&gt; Finally, while these stocks have been the face of the recent \u201cstay-at-home trend\u201d and may be more insulated from broader economic weakness, they are far from the only stocks making money this year. On July 30, the Philadelphia Stock Exchange Semiconductor Index hit a new all-time high and is now up more than 15% year-to-date.\n\n&gt; \u201cAfter a huge run, many of these top stocks may be due for a pause,\u201d said LPL Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cHowever, looking out over the next 6 to 12 months, we believe that investors will continue to place a premium on companies that are able to organically grow sales, especially in a low-growth environment.\u201d\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt;

        "selftext": "Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/StockMarket. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading month ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning August 3rd, 2020.\n\n# **Earnings and fiscal debate could be catalysts for stocks in the week ahead  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/31/the-jobs-report-and-congressional-politics-may-matter-more-for-markets-than-earnings-in-the-week-ahead.html)**\n*****\n&gt; The market could lose some of its exuberance in the week ahead as the calendar turns to August, and investors await Friday\u2019s July employment report and keep their eyes on Washington.\n*****\n&gt; The focus will also be squarely on politicians, as Congress struggles to find a middle ground on a new fiscal spending package and decide the fate of the $600 a week unemployment supplement that was set to expire July 31. Former vice president Joe Biden is also expected to name his running mate in the coming week.\n*****\n&gt; The jobs data will be crucial, particularly since the number of people filing for unemployment benefits has been edging higher, instead of falling back, as expected. According to Refinitiv, about 1.36 million new jobs are expected, well below the 4.8 million added in June, and the unemployment rate is expected to fall to 10.7% from 11.1%.\n*****\n&gt; Trading around the report could be volatile, since some economists expect more than 2 million jobs were added, and some even see flat or negative payrolls.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks have done well for the month of July, with the S&amp;P 500 finishing at 3,271, a gain of 5.5%. The Nasdaq has performed the best, rising 6.8% for the month to 10,745, after a 3.7% gain for the past week.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cAugust has traditionally been a challenging month for investors,\u201d said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA. The market is entering what historically has been the worst two months for stocks.\n*****\n&gt; According to Stovall, the S&amp;P 500 has been higher in August 53% of the time, and its average move is a gain of just 0.01%, going back to World War II. September is worse, down 0.51% on average, and up just 48% of the time.\n*****\n&gt; In presidential election years, however the odds for August gains are better, as it rose 63% of the time and 73%, when the incumbent is up for re-election.\n*****\n&gt; There are also about 120 S&amp;P 500 companies reporting earnings, but the big earnings show for markets was this past week when four of the five biggest tech giants all reported Thursday afternoon. Three of those stocks \u2014 Apple, Amazon and Facebook \u2014 surged, helping Nasdaq outperform Friday with a more than 1.5% gain.\n*****\n&gt; # Earnings scorecard\n&gt; \u201cWe\u2019re only a month into the reporting period, and things are going to become less and less important from an earnings perspective,\u201d said Stovall. \u201cI think investors are sort of disappointed in that the bar was set so low for second quarter earnings that expectations were that we were going to see a lot of companies beat, which we have. But we were also going to see a gradual uplift of earnings expectations for forward quarters. We\u2019re not seeing that.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Eighty-two percent of the companies reporting so far have beaten estimates, well above the average 65%, according to Refinitiv. The earnings decline is now looking closer to 33% from an initial 40%, and tech, which has been leading the market is one of the best performers. Profits for the sector now look to be up 1.4%, according to I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv.\n*****\n&gt; Because the tech names have contributed so much to market gains, their earnings were an important test for the market, and they didn\u2019t disappoint. But they didn\u2019t manage to pull up the whole market very far on Friday.\n*****\n&gt; Among the names reporting in the coming week are a diverse group, including Disney, ViacomCBS, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Berkshire Hathaway, AIG, Clorox, and Wayfair, to name a few.\n*****\n&gt; # Politics now in play\n&gt; \u201cThe earnings story is over. My call had been once we had gotten through the earnings season, we would be more vulnerable to a sustainable pullback,\u201d said Barry Knapp, Ironside Macroeconomics managing partner and director of research. \u201cObviously, it\u2019s volatility season, but it\u2019s also an election year. ... We\u2019re more vulnerable to that next week and earnings won\u2019t hold us up.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Knapp said if President Donald Trump and Republicans do not begin to perform better in the polls by Labor Day, the market is likely to focus on what a Democratic win would mean for taxes and regulation. That could be a negative for stocks.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIf he hasn\u2019t made headway by then, it\u2019s likely he\u2019s done.That\u2019s about the point when things become pretty set in stone. The market will presume that\u2019s the case,\u201d Knapp said.\n*****\n&gt; The politics of the stimulus package could also reverberate through markets, until it looks like the Senate Republicans and House Democrats can find common ground.\n*****\n&gt; The two sides look to be at a standoff, but an agreement is still expected in early August. The market is particularly watching to see what happens with the enhanced unemployment benefits. Republicans have proposed cutting it to $200, but Democrats support keeping it.\n*****\n&gt; # The economy\n&gt; Cutting the size of the payments back might be good for the labor market and persuade more workers to return to work, some strategists say. However, there is also concern that the funding has helped stimulate the economy and keep the unemployed from defaulting on loans and payments. Consumer spending on goods in June was even higher than last year, and that was also seen as getting a lift from stimulus.\n*****\n&gt; Besides the jobs report, there are other important data like ISM manufacturing on Monday. There are also monthly vehicle sales Monday, and ISM nonmanufacturing data Wednesday.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think the macro data is going to be fine next week,\u201d said Knapp. \u201cI\u2019m not in the camp that thinks the payroll number is going to be negative.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; NatWest Markets economist Kevin Cummins is one of the economists who expects the jobs gains to be much smaller than the past two months. He expects the payrolls to come in at just 200,000. \u201cYou look at jobless claims, and you see a stalling out,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Fed is right. There is significant downside risk to the economy.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # A trade to watch\n&gt; Treasury yields, in the 2-year to 7-year range, fell to new lows in the past week. The 10-year yield, not yet at a record low, was also falling and was at 0.53% Friday. At the same time, the dollar was down more than 1% on the week and 4% for the month.\n*****\n&gt; Gold was a beneficiary of the lower interest rates, weaker dollar trade, rising about 5% for the week and 10% for the month.\n*****\n&gt; Strategist say investors are reacting to super-low interest rates, concerns about the economy, and the possibility that huge government spending will send inflation higher.\n*****\n&gt; Investors are also jumping into inflation-protected bonds. According to Refinitiv\u2019s Lipper, inflation-protected bond funds took in $271 million of net new money for the fund-flows week ended July 29, the sixth week of gains. About $1 billion went into the SPDR Gold Shares ETF, (GLD) in the last week, Lipper said.\n*****\n&gt; During this time period, the Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities funds recorded their two best weekly net inflows ever with increases of $1.9 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively, for the fund-flows weeks of June 24 and July 1.\n*****\n&gt; Lipper said investors started to put money into TIPS funds in the middle of the second quarter, and the flows have been . net positive in 11 out of 13 weeks since the beginning of May. This its second-worst quarterly net outflows ever as oil prices slumped in the first quarter.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think this is going to be a much more inflationary decade. It will start out slowly. [Fed Chairman Jerome] Powell is right that more forces are putting downward pressure on inflation at present. But the market looks past that,\u201d said Knapp. \u201cThe big story in 2021 will be the recovery of inflation. You\u2019re already seeing it in import prices.\u201d\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/Vu3udbe.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/h0BBbe1.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/LKORgeK.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.postimg.cc/MZnSQFC8/econcal1.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/LhH7odo.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/p9QIWyG.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/HmN0IBf.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/ZlnNJZU.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/wvkv3FfP/er83720.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/vu4Bq8q.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/kKZeaRL.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/O6zeqaG.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/SkGddqX.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/5XLqRrO.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #5!](https://i.imgur.com/zl5gQpo.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# August: Top NASDAQ &amp; Russell 2000 Month of Election Years\n\n&gt; August is amongst the worst months of the year. It is the worst DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ, Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 month over the last 32 years, 1988-2019 with average declines ranging from 0.1% by NASDAQ to 1.1% by DJIA.\n\n&gt; Contributing to this poor performance since 1987; the second shortest bear market in history (45 days) caused by turmoil in Russia, the Asian currency crisis and the Long-Term Capital Management hedge fund debacle ending August 31, 1998 with the DJIA shedding 6.4% that day. DJIA dropped a record 1344.22 points for the month, off 15.1%\u2014which is the second worst monthly percentage DJIA loss since 1950. Saddam Hussein triggered a 10.0% slide in August 1990. The best DJIA gains occurred in 1982 (11.5%) and 1984 (9.8%) as bear markets ended. Sizeable losses in 2010, 2011, 2013 and 2015 of over 4% on DJIA have widened Augusts\u2019 average decline.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/e8afe7e1e8656f8b9beeaf3291cf8f62/02ca1964ef3531ea-f0/s400x600/77f035157f33a261b7608dc9cc36fc09a768f385.jpg))**\n\n&gt; However, in election years since 1950, Augusts\u2019 rankings improve: #6 DJIA, #5 S&amp;P 500, #1 NASDAQ (since 1971), #1 Russell 1000 and #1 Russell 2000 (since 1979). This year, the market\u2019s performance in August will likely depend heavily on how July closes and whether or not the rate of covid-19 infection continues to accelerate which could force some areas to roll back reopenings.\n\n*****\n\n# August\u2019s First Trading Day Bearish Last 23 Years\n\n&gt; From the Stock Trader\u2019s Almanac 2020 (page 88), it is known that the first trading days of each month combined gain nearly as much as all other days combined. However, the first trading day of August does not contribute to this phenomenon ranking worst among other First Trading Days in the 2020 Almanac. In the past 23 years DJIA has risen just 30.4% (up 7, down 16) of the time on the first trading day of August. Average and median losses are on the mild side due to a few sizable advances. Over the past nine years, DJIA and S&amp;P 500 have both declined nine times.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/8f6234b8e365d9e861563b4d5b2efa5d/42d5f6b50757b324-8c/s500x750/6269fe4480533724c565c9852bf543a4c59ea172.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# S&amp;P 500 Stronger Underneath the Surface\n\n&gt; Earlier today we posted a chart showing S&amp;P 500 sector performance since the Nasdaq's recent peak on 7/20 when Technology stocks began what has now been a 10-day period of consolidation. Below we have updated these performance numbers to include today's moves. While not as many sectors remain in positive territory, the majority of sectors continue to outperform the S&amp;P 500, while Technology drags the market lower. Along with Technology, Communication Services, and Consumer Discretionary are the only other sectors that have lagged the S&amp;P 500, and their performance has been dragged down by the mega-cap tech-like stocks of Alphabet (GOOGL), Facebook (FB), and Amazon (AMZN).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/07/073020-Sector-Performance.png))**\n\n&gt; Expanding on this theme of underlying strength in the index, the chart below shows the average performance of stocks in the S&amp;P 500 grouped by sector. On an equal-weighted basis, the S&amp;P 500 is actually up 1.3% since 7/20, and only two sectors (Technology and Materials) have seen negative average returns. On the upside, Real Estate (4.1%) has been the big winner followed by Consumer Discretionary (3.3%), and Consumer Staples (2.2%). The fact that Consumer Discretionary at the cap-weighted sector level is down over 1.4% while the average performance of stocks in the sector has been a gain of 3.3% illustrates what a mammoth impact AMZN has on that sector.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/07/073020-Sector-Performance-Avg.png))**\n\n&gt; Breadth among S&amp;P 500 stocks has also been overwhelmingly positive. For the S&amp;P 500 as a whole, 59% of stocks in the index have had positive returns since the close on 7/20. Only two sectors (Technology and Materials) have seen fewer than half of their components post positive returns over that time, while Real Estate, Consumer Staples, and Utilities have seen roughly three-quarters of their components rally since 7/20.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/07/073020-Sector-Performance-Percent-Up1.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Bullish Earnings Season So Far\n\n&gt; At our Earnings Explorer tool available to clients on our website, we provide a real-time look at beat rates for both EPS and sales. Below is a snapshot from the website showing both the EPS and sales beat rates for US companies reporting earnings on a rolling 3-month basis. Currently, 64.61% of companies have exceeded consensus analyst EPS estimates over the last three months, while 63.75% of companies have beaten consensus sales estimates over the same time frame.\n\n&gt; In looking at the chart, you can see a big spike in the EPS beat rate over the last few weeks. Since earnings season began on July 13th, nearly 80% of companies have posted stronger than expected EPS numbers. That's a huge beat rate and suggests that analysts were too bearish on Q2 numbers heading into July. The revenue beat rate held up much better than EPS beats throughout the first half of 2020, but it too is on the upswing this season.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/07/epssales.png))**\n\n&gt; We also monitor how share prices are reacting to earnings reports. So far this earnings season, the average stock that has reported Q2 numbers has gained 1.31% on its earnings reaction day. That compares to a historical average one-day change of just 0.06% on earnings reaction days. As shown below, stocks that have beaten EPS estimates this season have gained 2.2% on earnings reaction days, while companies that have missed EPS estimates have fallen 1.89%. It's rare to see beats gaining more than misses decline, but that's what is happening this season.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/07/eps.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# China Running Away YTD\n\n&gt; Every Wednesday, we publish our Global Macro Dashboard which provides a high-level summary of market and economic data of some of the world's largest economies. Of the 23 stock markets tracked, just six including the US are positive year to date at the moment (in local currency). In the chart below we show the YTD performance of these six countries as well as the global median in 2020. As shown, even though it was actually the first to tip into the green YTD following the global sell-off in February and March very briefly back in early June, the US is up the least of this group with a YTD gain of 0.4%. China's stock market is up the most at +14%. Taiwan, South Korea, South Africa, and Malaysia are also outperforming the US but are up more modestly than China with the best of these, Taiwan, gaining 4.53% this year. Meanwhile, the median country in our Global Macro Dashboard remains down 6.2% YTD.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/07/072920-GMD-ytd.png))**\n\n&gt; Given it is up the most on a year to date basis, China has also gained the largest share of global equity market cap in 2020. As shown in the table below, China has gained 1.7 percentage points of global market cap in 2020 and now takes up 10.14%. China now joins the US as the only other country with a double-digit share of total world market cap. Despite this, China has actually lost share since the bear market lows on 3/23. Meanwhile, the US, Germany, Canada, India, South Korea, and Australia have all gained a significant share since 3/23.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/07/072920-Mkt-Cap-World.png))**\n\n# Do the Top 5 Stocks Pose a Risk to the Market?\n\n&gt; Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Google, and Facebook. These five stocks have helped spawn a number of acronyms as they try to capture the rise of mega-cap tech stocks that have led the market higher for much of the past decade. The average return for those five stocks so far this year has been a gain of more than 30%, while the broad S&amp;P 500 Index is just marginally positive, at 0.4% through July 30.\n\n&gt; While many other areas of the market have remained largely static, the total market value of these stocks has dramatically increased, making them an increasingly large piece of market cap-weighted indexes such as the S&amp;P 500. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the combined weight of the top five stocks in the S&amp;P 500 has increased to its highest level ever, at nearly 22%. Only one of those five stocks (Microsoft) was a top five name in the index during the previous peak of March 2000.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/7.31.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; But does this pose a risk to the index? From a diversification standpoint, one could certainly argue it does. For instance, if any shared risks should come up, from regulation, for example, it could do outsized damage to cap-weighted indexes. However, we believe that the recent gains have been justified by the fundamentals, and we continue to favor both large caps over small caps, and growth-style stocks over value stocks. According to analysis from Credit Suisse, over the past 12 months, the top five stocks in the index have grown revenues at 11.2% vs. just 0.8% for the rest of the S&amp;P 500. Further, the remainder of the S&amp;P 500 has subtracted roughly $17 from S&amp;P 500 earnings per share (EPS), while the top five stocks have added more than $12.\n\n&gt; Finally, while these stocks have been the face of the recent \u201cstay-at-home trend\u201d and may be more insulated from broader economic weakness, they are far from the only stocks making money this year. On July 30, the Philadelphia Stock Exchange Semiconductor Index hit a new all-time high and is now up more than 15% year-to-date.\n\n&gt; \u201cAfter a huge run, many of these top stocks may be due for a pause,\u201d said LPL Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cHowever, looking out over the next 6 to 12 months, we believe that investors will continue to place a premium on companies that are able to organically grow sales, especially in a low-growth environment.\u201d\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending July 31st, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dHjwVbB9Js))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 8.2.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HxwctgldoQ))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt;

        "selftext": "\nI've posted bits and pieces of this in some comments since some form of the question has come up on this subreddit. I want to list out a list of reasons why today is like the dot com times and ALSO what is different about today. I am not a financial professional, but I have been working in the tech industry for over 20 years. It is mostly tech stock focused.\n\nI'm going to also add (fact) or (anecdotal) or (opinion) to my bullet points, so take those bullet points with the appropriate grain of salt.\n\nReasons we are NOT like the dot-com boom (roughly in order of importance):\n\n* (fact) Interest rates are much lower now and long term expectations on yield is also low. In 1999, the 10 year treasury was at around 5% and rose to over 6.5% in 2000. The P/E of the S&amp;P 500 in 2000 was around 30. Which means that the 10 year treasury yielded MORE than the S&amp;P 500 earnings. This is absolutely not true today with the 10 year treasury yield being around 0.6% and P/Es being around 25-30. This single point is extremely important to understand.\n* (fact) Late stage VCs are more of a thing now than they were in dot com. Thus you have fewer IPOs and the companies that do are more mature and less speculative (of course there are outliers, see below).\n* (fact) The NASDAQ P/E in 2000 was really quite ridiculous (I can't find a chart for some reason, i think it was around 80). S&amp;P 500 was more comparable between 2000 and now.\n* (anecdotes) You can no longer get a job at a startup / real tech firm just because you know HTML or can write \"hello world\" in Perl. A lot of firms back in the late 90's were trying to fatten up the employee count and race to IPO to cash out. This doesn't happen today.\n* (fact) There was no pandemic in 2000 and it makes comparisons hard.\n\nReasons we are like the dot-com boom (roughly in order of importance)\n\n* (anecdotes) Sentiment on the ground is very similar to what you hear during the dot com boom. We make fun of the people who invest in stupid shit like NKLA, HTZ, etc. But a lot of people are creaming their pants still on the big tech (FAMANG) saying they are forever-holds / they can't go down, etc. You also now are starting to see intelligent, rational people putting money in things **precisely** because other people will and assume they can get out before it all falls apart.\n* (fact) In the late 90s, internet brokers were a new thing and made trading easier for people who didn't know anything -- and we see that today with COVID stay-at-homers and an influx of users into robinhood (I wish I could get hard numbers on the comparison). (opinion) Because of this, I'm fairly certain pricing is out of whack for a large number of companies.\n* (fact) The P/E ratios of the big techs today are higher than a lot of the big techs during 2000. Nasdaq P/E in 2000 was off the chart, but if you just look at the big profitable companies like INTC, ORCL, AAPL, HPQ, IBM, which were the equivalent of FAMANG today, they had P/Es mostly under 30s. FAMANG are around 35 except for Netflix and Amazon which are much higher (see huge caveat on interest rates above). CSCO and MSFT in 2000 were the outliers having P/Es of well over 60.\n* (anecdotes) In tech companies, a common business plan for new firms in the last ~8 years is to get market share at any cost and figure out profitability later. This is really no different from dot com when firms were valued by number of \"eyeballs\".\n* (opinion) \"this time is different\". At least in terms of technology, it's not. The internet itself was a bigger \"paradigm shift\" than what we are seeing today. I used \"paradigm shift\", because was a common buzzword that turned into a joke back in the late 90s and used to justify crazy valuations. Machine Learning is amazing, but not on par with connecting everyone on the globe. And the cloud is just a fancy name for running something on someone else's computer (even though its quite nice how easy and seamless it is today vs. 20 years ago).\n* (anecdotes) While it is harder to IPO today without profitability or clear path to profitability, it clearly still happens (UBER, LYFT, SNAP). And others are using backdoor IPOs (NKLA, SPCE).\n* (fact) In 2000, the IT sector along with Media stocks and the Telecommunications Services sector approached 40% of the S&amp;P market cap. The categories have changed but if you combine IT and Communication Services sectors, you get a 38% of S&amp;P market cap today. If you add Amazon which is not included in IT/Communication, you get over 40%. Does this mean anything, especially since we are in a pandemic and more stuff runs on IT? Not sure.\n\nYou can definitely pick apart some of the individual points, I just wanted to lay them all out and see what people thought and if anyone has other valid comparisons. I personally think we ARE in some kind of tech bubble, but I'm not going to make a fool of myself in predictions on when and how it will burst. And fuck it, while I do have more in cash than typical, I'm still in VTI/VXUS and a bunch of individual tech names since I have the background to do some analysis on the business.\n\nI'll end with a few random thoughts:\n\n* In August 1999, a lot of people were looking at the craziness of the dot com boom and how people were throwing money at stupid shit. I don't care what people say, it was pretty obvious something was wrong. If you shorted the NASDAQ then, you will watch the NASDAQ more than double in 7 months time and have your face ripped off.\n* Taking what I've posted as a whole, the one thing to be terrified about is if long term interest rates rise and the fed is either powerless or does not step in for whatever reason. This will completely destroy the stock and bond market. I don't see the catalyst for it, but I'm no economic genius. You might be able to make an argument that gold is a hedge for this unlikely scenario. There is also the worry of a slump in earnings due to general economic malaise, but that is a garden variety concern that everyone is watching for and usually pretty temporary. Rise in interest rates would be real bad.",

        "selftext": "**TLDR at the bottom**\n\nAs the title states, it is my opinion that SOAC warrants (SOAC.WT) are a great target for investors trying to get into the ESG sector. This is not financial advice. Do your own DD and make your own decisions.\n\n**Objective:**\n\nSOAC is Sustainable Opportunities Acquisition Corporation. It is a $300 million blank check company with a dedicated ESG focus. ESG stands for Environmental, Social, and Governance. As their [website](https://www.greenspac.com/) states, SOAC is \"focused on evaluating suitable targets that have existing environmental sustainability practices.\"\n\n**Opinion:**\n\nI believe that ESG has a strong impact on the market today. Just think bout some of the examples below and how it can affect the public's perception of a company and also how it can affect a company's stock.\n\n**E** for Environmental: climate change, carbon emissions, air and water pollution, energy efficiency\n\n**S** for Social: gender and diversity, community relations, human rights, labor standards\n\n**G** for Governance: company leadership, shareholder rights, company standards\n\nSOAC is one of the first (if not the first) blank check company to have an ESG focus ([source](https://www.greenspac.com/wp-content/uploads/news/first-of-its-kind-sustainable-spac-raises-$300m-environmental-finance.pdf))\n\n**Opinion:**\n\nWhether you want to believe it or not, ESG will continue to have an impact on investing for years and years to come. This could be due to a number of reasons including the Coronavirus pandemic, the growing threat of climate change, the increasing trend toward investing in socially responsible companies, and the continued fight for social justice, among others. Here are some links for further reading about ESG:\n\n[https://www.morningstar.com/features/esg-investing-history](https://www.morningstar.com/features/esg-investing-history)\n\n[https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/01/coronavirus-major-turning-point-for-responsible-esg-investing-says-jpmorgan.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/01/coronavirus-major-turning-point-for-responsible-esg-investing-says-jpmorgan.html)\n\n[https://www.forbes.com/sites/zachconway/2020/08/05/as-social-issues-own-the-national-conversation-investors-can-use-money-to-talk/#55c751656ca5](https://www.forbes.com/sites/zachconway/2020/08/05/as-social-issues-own-the-national-conversation-investors-can-use-money-to-talk/#55c751656ca5)\n\n[https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/14/millennials-look-to-make-a-social-impact-with-their-investing-dollar.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/14/millennials-look-to-make-a-social-impact-with-their-investing-dollar.html)\n\n**Objective:**\n\nWhat type of companies/targets would SOAC look for? It turns out from their website, it can mean a target in a variety of industries such as \"manufacturing (including auto, building materials), chemicals, services (including waste, environmental, construction), logistics (including transportation, distribution), technology (hardware, software, devices), agriculture (including biofuels) and energy (with focus on renewable generation, utility services, energy efficiency/management), among others.\" They also state they could target companies that historically have not been focused on environmental sustainability but are now looking to enhance their environmental sustainability profiles.\n\n**Opinion:**\n\nThink about some of the \"hot\" investments sectors right now. I'm talking about auto/EV, transportation, technology, energy.....these could be where SOAC's target comes from.\n\nMany people will say that for blank check companies, the management team or the amount in the trust fund is the most important thing to look at when evaluating them. To me, both are very important but my number one most important thing to consider is the sector the blank check company plans to target.\n\nBased on my past experiences, I judge a blank check company's chance of success based on the public's excitement of the sector - the more people that are excited about the target and its sector, the more they are likely to invest in them, the more likely they are to spread awareness to other areas of the internet (social media, etc), and the more likely it will snowball into success for the blank check company (what some call its \"hype\" or its \"meme/moon potential\"). I can see that happening with SOAC.\n\nSpeaking of the management team...\n\n**Objective:**\n\nCEO - Scott Leonard, previously CEO of GenOn Mid-Atlantic and CFO/CRO of GenOn (an energy company), SVP at Hewlett Packard\n\nCFO - David Quiram, MS + Ph.D in Chemical Engineering from MIT\n\nChairman - Scott Honour, Managing Partner of Northern Pacific Group, previously Senior Managing Director of The Gores Group (which has completed four blank check company mergers in the past), and former candidate for Governor of Minnesota\n\n**Opinion:**\n\nGood mix of personnel in the management team with a wide range of backgrounds. Nothing that jumps out at me but no red flags which is exactly what I want.\n\nBased on these short interviews of the CEO Scott Leonard, he seems like a competent, knowledgeable guy on the outside. Again, no red flags.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wx8U1byaark](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wx8U1byaark)\n\n[https://twitter.com/nyse/status/1261374888406745088](https://twitter.com/nyse/status/1261374888406745088)\n\n[https://cheddar.com/media/sustainable-opportunities-acquisition-corp-makes-nyse-debut](https://cheddar.com/media/sustainable-opportunities-acquisition-corp-makes-nyse-debut)\n\n**Objective:**\n\nSOAC.WT closed at $0.83 today, 8/24/20\n\n**Opinion:**\n\nSOAC.WT is such good value right now. I believe SOAC.WT has the potential to do well when you compare its price to other current blank check company warrants that are &gt; $1.50 and don't even have a letter of intent yet. You are getting a sub- $1 warrant at basically its ground floor that has the ability to run to much higher numbers.\n\n**Objective:**\n\nSOAC is targeting a business combination in late 2020 or early 2021 ([source](https://www.greenspac.com/))\n\n**Opinion:**\n\nThe timeline target of late 2020 or early 2021 will be here before you know it. That being said, SOAC.WT is not a short term play for me. SOAC.WT is not something I plan to buy now and sell in a week. It is a medium to long term play as SOAC based on its business target combination of late 2020 or early 2021. SOAC.WT only began trading on 6/26/20 so we are honestly still only in the early stages.\n\nWhat that said, getting in SOAC.WT now at these prices can lead to even more rewards than if I waited until Q4 2020 or Q1 2021 before buying. My hopes is that by the time Q4 2020 is here, the price of SOAC.WT will be nowhere near where they are now.\n\n**Final thoughts:**\n\nSOAC.WT is everything that I am looking for in a blank check company warrant. Warrants are obviously more risky than commons however I believe in this case, SOAC.WT provides the risk/reward profile that I am happy with.\n\n**Disclaimer:**\n\nI have been steadily accumulating SOAC warrants for the past two weeks. Further, my plan is to take some of my (hopeful) profits from SHLL/GRAF/FMCI/SPAQ to SOAC.WT after their respective runs.\n\n**TLDR:** SOAC.WT is a blank check company with an ESG (**E**nvironmental, **S**ocial, **G**overnance) focus. ESG will only have a bigger and bigger impact on the stock market (and stock success) as time goes on whether it is due to the Coronavirus pandemic, the growing threat of climate change, the increasing trend toward investing in socially responsible companies, and the continued fight for social justice (among others). Based on a number of factors including SOAC.WT's current price (sub-$1 warrants), timeline (business combination target in late 2020 or early 2021), and possible target sector (auto/EV, transportation, technology, energy), I believe SOAC.WT is great value for its risk/reward profile.",

You are getting zero exposure to the companies I listed if you do not add Solar. Also note $ARKK sold $TSLA so buy the stonk when it dips down to $1350 again.

        "selftext": "Good Friday evening to all of you here on r/smallstreetbets. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning August 24th, 2020.\n\n# **Markets look to the Fed again to build on S&amp;P 500 record as Congress continues to disappoint  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/21/markets-look-to-the-fed-again-to-build-on-sp-500-record-as-congress-continues-to-disappoint.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Market pros hold out little hope that Congress will agree to a stimulus package before September, but they will look to Jerome Powell in the coming week to provide a roadmap for what else the Fed might do to help the economy.\n*****\n&gt; The Fed holds its annual Jackson Hole symposium starting Thursday, and it will conduct the Kansas City Fed-sponsored meeting virtually rather than against the backdrop of the Grand Tetons as it normally does at this time of year. The Fed chairman speaks Thursday morning on the implications for monetary policy and the Fed\u2019s anticipated policy framework review.\n*****\n&gt; The past week was a big week for markets, with the S&amp;P 500 finally recovering its losses from the pandemic selloff and setting new all-time highs. Stocks have been big beneficiaries of the Fed\u2019s easy policies and low interest rates, and Fed officials are widely expected to sound dovish when they meet in the coming week.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think we know the Fed\u2019s all in. If anything they want the mechanicals to work right,\u201d said Ed Keon, chief investment strategist at QMA. \u201cThe basic Fed policy is crystal clear. You\u2019re going to have low rates for the foreseeable future. They will do whatever it takes.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; But Fed watchers expect Powell to go further than the Fed\u2019s already extraordinary support for the economy and financial conditions, and offer guidance on new language and policies that will help the markets understand how long it might hold those low rates and extraordinary policies in place.\n*****\n&gt; For instance, the Fed was expected to provide a more explicit forward guidance policy, and it could also introduce inflation averaging, meaning the Fed could specify that it could both undershoot and overshoot its 2% inflation target. Inflation has only occasionally surpassed its target over the past dozen years, since the financial crisis.\n*****\n&gt; Michael Gapen, chief U.S. economist at Barclays, said he expects the Fed will introduce forward guidance and average inflation targeting at its September meeting. He expects the Fed\u2019s policy review to examine all of its policies to determine which work best in different circumstances.\n*****\n&gt; Since the markets collapsed in February and March, the Fed has cut rates to zero and helped increase liquidity with different facilities for different areas of the capital markets like commercial paper, municipal bonds and corporate bonds. It also created lending programs and continues to buy a large amount of Treasury securities and mortgages. Its balance sheet has now ballooned to $7 trillion.\n*****\n&gt; With average inflation targeting, the Fed would allow the economy and inflation to run hotter than target, without immediately taking steps to tighten policy, according to Jim Caron, fixed income portfolio manger with Morgan Stanley Investment Management.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWhat they\u2019re saying is if the economy starts to recover, let\u2019s say we get a vaccine, or the rate of infection goes down, and the equity market is on a tear, they\u2019re not going to stop it,\u201d said Caron. \u201cThey\u2019re going to stay there for awhile. That\u2019s what they\u2019re trying to communicate.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # Where\u2019s the stimulus?\n&gt; As markets await clarity from the Fed, market pros are expecting less from Congress after first initially anticipating a stimulus package by early August.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cAt this point, the thing I\u2019m most thinking about is are we going to get a stimulus deal or not,\u201d said Keon. \u201cI think the politics are shifting beneath that.\u201d He said some Republicans in Congress may be less inclined to spend on a big package ahead of the election.\n*****\n&gt; Democrats and Republicans have been far apart in terms of the contents of the package. One hot button issue is the $600 supplemental weekly aid for the unemployed. It expired on July 31, and Republicans want to cut it to $200 a week while Democrats want to keep current levels. The White House meanwhile has moved to provide $300 a week in aid from FEMA funds but the states have to process those payments.\n*****\n&gt; The two parties are also still far apart on the size of the package, after initially starting out with Democrats at $3 trillion and Republicans with $1 trillion.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cSome folks are discovering their inner budget hawks. It looks like the positions of the two sides are moving further away rather than closer together,\u201d said Keon. \u201cAs the election moves up on us, the possibilities of a deal are going down...the markets are slowly moving toward the idea we don\u2019t get stimulus deal and we might get a Biden presidency. It\u2019s not panicking about it.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; The Democratic party held its convention this past week, formally nominating former vice president Joseph Biden to head the Democratic ticket. The Republican convention begins Monday. Biden leads President Donald Trump by an average 7.4 percentage points in the major polls, according to RealClearPolitics.com.\n*****\n&gt; Michael Schumacher, director rate strategy at Wells Fargo, said he too is becoming more skeptical a stimulus deal will get done. \u201cAs the election season gets going, it appears to be getting harder and harder, not from a timing standpoint but from a lack of goodwill standpoint,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; Strategists said if the economic data weakens, that could hurt stocks and get Congress back to negotiating a new package. There had been expectations a package would include a one-time payment for individuals and families, enhanced unemployment payments and aid for state and local governments.\n*****\n&gt; Raymond James Washington policy analyst Ed Mills said the two sides are likely to come together, but without a catalyst forcing them it may wait until they need to pass a continuing resolution on the budget Sept. 30. \u201cDemocrats are not going to allow for an appropriations bill to pass that does not include additional support for the economy,\u201d said Mills.\n*****\n&gt; # It\u2019s the economy\n&gt; There is some key data in the week ahead that should show how manufacturing and the consumer are faring.\n*****\n&gt; Durable good is reported Wednesday, while personal income and spending data is reported Friday. Consumer confidence is Tuesday and consumer sentiment is released Friday.\n*****\n&gt; Energy markets will be keeping a close eye on two tropical storms that are heading into the Gulf of Mexico and could make landfall early Wednesday. One storm, Laura is tracking close to Florida, and a second storm, possibly to be named Marco looks to be heading across the Yucatan Peninsula before entering the Gulf.\n*****\n&gt; It would be unprecedented in the era of satellites and modern hurricane tracking technology for two storms to arrive within 24 hours. The Weather Channel reports there was such an occurrence in September, 1933.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/0FgKliy.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/yHvkn2w.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/L2S9kUV.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/kgk42Nv.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/cMOmbjC.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/kCvYfYX.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/jwR8nq6.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/nSC6K2N.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/YSNdrT9T/er1.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/bwcCQMYv/ipos1.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.postimg.cc/yxfJ72fy/upgradesdowngrades1.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.postimg.cc/3Nr453Zw/upgradesdowngrades2.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # September Almanac: Only Modest Improvement in Election Years\n\n&gt; Start of business year, end of summer vacations, and back to school made September a leading barometer month in first 60 years of 20th century, now portfolio managers back after Labor Day tend to clean house Since 1950, September is the worst performing month of the year for DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ (since 1971) and Russell 1000 (since 1979). Sizable gains in September 2009, 2010, 2012, 2013 and 2017 have lifted Russell 2000 to second worst (since 1979). September was creamed four years straight from 1999-2002 after four solid years from 1995-1998 during the dot.com bubble buildup.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/e4e433c87c6e4c76cefda4ccffbf5ab0/cfdd6d36ba180c35-7f/s400x600/836cc65ffaba5c46d56ea4566614d200638be344.jpg))**\n\n&gt; Bullish election-year forces do little to improve on September\u2019s poor overall performance over the same time frame. September\u2019s performance does improve slightly in election years, but it is still negative nearly across the board. Only the Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 have been able to escape negative territory and post modest 0.2% and 0.8% average gains respectively in the last ten election year Septembers.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 5 Charts To See With Stocks At New Highs\n\n&gt; \u201cBetter late than never.\u201d\n\n&gt; It took a while, but the S&amp;P 500 Index finally made a new all-time high, coming all the way back from the vicious 34% bear market in less than six months.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/pic-8.19.20-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; It might bring back some scary memories, but back in March it took the S&amp;P 500 only 16 days to go from new highs to a bear market (down 20%), the fastest ever.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/picture-8.19.20-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; \u201cThis will go down as the fastest bear market ever, but also one of the fastest recoveries ever,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cThen again, we\u2019ve never quite seen a recession and recovery like this, so maybe it isn\u2019t a shock to see new highs this quickly.\u201d\n\n&gt; The bear officially lasted one month and took five months to recover the losses. Usually when there\u2019s a bear market during a recession, it takes 30 months to recover those loses. This was the third-fastest ever, with only 3 months to recover from a bear market recession in the early \u201880s and 4 months to recover from a bear market in the early \u201890s.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/picture-8.19.20-3.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; It seems like earlier this year and new highs were a lifetime ago, but the S&amp;P 500 finally moved off unlucky 13, notching the 14th new high of 2020.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/picture-8.19.20-4.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, returns after a long time without new highs actually get better. One, three, six, and 12 months after the first new high in more than five months show stronger performance than average or after any new highs. Yet another reason to think that this bull market from a long-term point of view could have some more tricks up its sleeve.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/picture-8.19.20-5.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Last, we found there were four other times the S&amp;P 500 made a new high during a recession: In February \u201961, July \u201980, November \u201982, and March \u201991. Incredibly, a new expansion started the following month every single time. Could stocks at new highs be signaling an end to this recession? We think that very well could be the case again this time.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Largest S&amp;P 500 Stocks + Tesla (TSLA)\n\n&gt; Tesla (TSLA) is now up 50% over the last 10 calendar days dating back to August 11th. This has propelled the company way up the list of the largest US companies.\n\n&gt; Below is a table of the largest stocks in the S&amp;P 500 with Tesla (TSLA) included. As shown, Tesla's $382.7 billion market cap would rank it as the 9th largest stock in the S&amp;P 500 were it in the index.\n\n&gt; On August 11th, Tesla's market cap was just $256 billion, so over the last ten days it has leapfrogged companies like Walmart (WMT), Home Depot (HD), JP Morgan (JPM), Procter &amp; Gamble (PG), Mastercard (MA), and NVIDIA (NVDA). Next up would be Visa (V) and Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ), which have market caps just under $400 billion.

Tips - Earnings Season and Top Triple Plays\n\n&gt; Walmart (WMT) wrapped up the Q2 2020 earnings reporting period on Tuesday with a huge beat on both the top and bottom line. It was a fitting end to what turned out to be a record-setting earnings season.\n\n&gt; As we highlighted in our Q2 Earnings Season preview in early July, analysts were rapidly increasing earnings estimates leading up to earnings season. Normally when that happens, stocks have trouble performing well during earnings season because the expectations bar has been set higher. This season, even with analyst estimates on the rise in the four weeks leading up to the start of the reporting period, companies managed to beat bottom-line EPS estimates at the highest rate in the history of our database going back to 1999.\n\n&gt; As shown below, 76% of companies reported stronger-than-expected EPS numbers this season, which eclipsed the prior record high of 73% seen during the Q3 2006 reporting period.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/08/beatratesbyquarter.png))**\n\n&gt; Long-term Bespoke subscribers know how much we like earnings triple plays, but for those that haven\u2019t heard of the term, we came up with it back in the mid-2000s. An earnings triple play is a company that beats EPS estimates, beats revenue estimates, and raises forward guidance all in the same quarterly earnings report. Investopedia.com is one of the best online resources for financial markets education, and they\u2019ve actually given us credit for coining the \u201ctriple play\u201d term on their website. We consider triple play stocks to be the cream of the crop of earnings season, and we are constantly finding new long-term buy opportunities from this basket of names each quarter.\n\n&gt; This earnings season there were a massive number of earnings triple plays. We went through the list of this season's triple plays to find the ones that have the most attractive set-ups heading into the earnings off-season.\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending August 21st, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGhxT3rxKxc))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 8.23.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCwfvNh2iXU))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$BBY** \n&gt; * **$DG** \n&gt; * **$CRM** \n&gt; * **$DLTR** \n&gt; * **$INTU** \n&gt; * **$DKS** \n&gt; * **$MDT** \n&gt; * **$PANW** \n&gt; * **$SJM** \n&gt; * **$ICLK** \n&gt; * **$OKTA** \n&gt; * **$MRVL** \n&gt; * **$ADSK** \n&gt; * **$HRL** \n&gt; * **$WDAY** \n&gt; * **$BIG** \n&gt; * **$COTY** \n&gt; * **$ULTA** \n&gt; * **$BOX** \n&gt; * **$SPLK**\n&gt; * **$BNS** \n&gt; * **$TOL** \n&gt; * **$VMW** \n&gt; * **$BMO** \n&gt; * **$TD** \n&gt; * **$VEEV** \n&gt; * **$HPE** \n&gt; * **$DELL** \n&gt; * **$BILI** \n&gt; * **$BURL** \n&gt; * **$PLCE** \n&gt; * **$ANF** \n&gt; * **$OLLI** \n&gt; * **$PLAN** \n&gt; * **$FLWS** \n&gt; * **$VIOT** \n&gt; * **$RY** \n&gt; * **$HPQ** \n&gt; * **$SOL** \n&gt; * **$BITA** \n&gt; * **$ATHM** \n&gt; * **$NTAP**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.postimg.cc/YSNdrT9T/er1.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.postimg.cc/FKXPQh9j/ervol1.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST INCREASE IN EARNINGS EXPECTATIONS RELEASES!](https://i.postimg.cc/G3q2ZwT4/erincrease1.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 8.24.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/RwgQ9SD.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 8.24.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/mvBOGth.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 8.25.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/aY6k2e0.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 8.25.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/rx2gJbQ.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 8.26.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/zKSTcN5.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 8.26.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/B3hFxJN.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 8.27.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/wqQ6cS6.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 8.27.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Tln4z5V.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 8.28.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/7xetbo6.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 8.28.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Best Buy Co., Inc. $114.00\n&gt; **Best Buy Co., Inc.

        "selftext": "**Context -**\n\nThe S&amp;P 500 gained 0.7% on Friday for its sixth straight record-setting advance. The Nasdaq Composite gained 0.6% to close at a record high, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.6%, and the Russell 2000 gained 0.9%.\n\nAll 11 S&amp;P 500 sectors closed in positive territory, with energy (+1.9%) and materials (+1.1%) rising more than 1.0%. The information technology sector (+1.0%) was next in line, but it was perhaps the most influential gainer today given its top-weighted position in the S&amp;P 500. The health care sector (+0.2%) lagged. \n\nIn the tech space, Workday (WDAY 243.88, +27.25, +12.6%), HP Inc. (HPQ 19.85, +1.15, +6.2%), Dell (DELL 66.21, +3.78, +6.1%), and VMware (VMW 146.09, +3.19, +2.2%) stood out as earnings winners. Semiconductor stocks also chipped in a solid outing, evident by the 2.0% increase in the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index. \n\nThere was no one specific catalyst today, but investors did receive another batch of better-than-expected economic data that helped broaden out the gains. \n\nFor July, personal income increased 0.4% m/m (consensus -0.2%) and personal spending rose 1.9% m/m (consensus +1.5%). The final University of Michigan Index of Consumer Sentiment for August ticked up to 74.1 (consensus 72.8) from the preliminary reading of 72.8. \n\nThe data provided some fuel for the reopening stocks like casinos, airlines, cruise lines, and hotels. Shares of MGM Resorts (MGM 23.86, +1.05, +4.6%) rose nearly 5%, even as the company announced plans to lay off 18,000 furloughed employees as a result of the pandemic. \n\nU.S. Treasuries finished mixed. The 2-yr yield was flat at 0.15%, and the 10-yr yield declined two basis points to 0.73%. The U.S. Dollar Index fell 0.7% to 92.32. WTI crude futures declined 0.1% to $42.97/bbl.

        "selftext": "**TLDR at the bottom**\n\nAs the title states, it is my opinion that SOAC warrants (SOAC.WT) are a great target for investors trying to get into the ESG sector. This is not financial advice. Do your own DD and make your own decisions.\n\n**Objective:**\n\nSOAC is Sustainable Opportunities Acquisition Corporation. It is a $300 million blank check company with a dedicated ESG focus. ESG stands for Environmental, Social, and Governance. As their [website](https://www.greenspac.com/) states, SOAC is \"focused on evaluating suitable targets that have existing environmental sustainability practices.\" \n\nFYI - a blank check company acquires and merges with another company thus allowing the latter company to become publicly traded.\n\n**Opinion:**\n\nI believe that ESG has a strong impact on the market today. Just think bout some of the examples below and how it can affect the public's perception of a company and also how it can affect a company's stock.\n\n**E** for Environmental: climate change, carbon emissions, air and water pollution, energy efficiency\n\n**S** for Social: gender and diversity, community relations, human rights, labor standards\n\n**G** for Governance: company leadership, shareholder rights, company standards\n\nSOAC is one of the first (if not the first) blank check company to have an ESG focus ([source](https://www.greenspac.com/wp-content/uploads/news/first-of-its-kind-sustainable-spac-raises-$300m-environmental-finance.pdf))\n\n**Opinion:**\n\nWhether you want to believe it or not, ESG will continue to have an impact on investing for years and years to come. This could be due to a number of reasons including the Coronavirus pandemic, the growing threat of climate change, the increasing trend toward investing in socially responsible companies, and the continued fight for social justice, among others. Here are some links for further reading about ESG:\n\n[https://www.morningstar.com/features/esg-investing-history](https://www.morningstar.com/features/esg-investing-history)\n\n[https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/01/coronavirus-major-turning-point-for-responsible-esg-investing-says-jpmorgan.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/01/coronavirus-major-turning-point-for-responsible-esg-investing-says-jpmorgan.html)\n\n[https://www.forbes.com/sites/zachconway/2020/08/05/as-social-issues-own-the-national-conversation-investors-can-use-money-to-talk/#55c751656ca5](https://www.forbes.com/sites/zachconway/2020/08/05/as-social-issues-own-the-national-conversation-investors-can-use-money-to-talk/#55c751656ca5)\n\n[https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/14/millennials-look-to-make-a-social-impact-with-their-investing-dollar.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/14/millennials-look-to-make-a-social-impact-with-their-investing-dollar.html)\n\n**Objective:**\n\nWhat type of companies/targets would SOAC look for? It turns out from their website, it can mean a target in a variety of industries such as \"manufacturing (including auto, building materials), chemicals, services (including waste, environmental, construction), logistics (including transportation, distribution), technology (hardware, software, devices), agriculture (including biofuels) and energy (with focus on renewable generation, utility services, energy efficiency/management), among others.\" They also state they could target companies that historically have not been focused on environmental sustainability but are now looking to enhance their environmental sustainability profiles.\n\n**Opinion:**\n\nThink about some of the \"hot\" investments sectors right now. I'm talking about auto/EV, transportation, technology, energy.....these could be where SOAC's target comes from.\n\nMany people will say that for blank check companies, the management team or the amount in the trust fund is the most important thing to look at when evaluating them. To me, both are very important but my number one most important thing to consider is the sector the blank check company plans to target.\n\nBased on my past experiences, I judge a blank check company's chance of success based on the public's excitement of the sector - the more people that are excited about the target and its sector, the more they are likely to invest in them, the more likely they are to spread awareness to other areas of the internet (social media, etc), and the more likely it will snowball into success for the blank check company (what some call its \"hype\" or its \"meme potential\"). I can see that happening with SOAC.\n\nSpeaking of the management team...\n\n**Objective:**\n\nCEO - Scott Leonard, previously CEO of GenOn Mid-Atlantic and CFO/CRO of GenOn (an energy company), SVP at Hewlett Packard\n\nCFO - David Quiram, MS + Ph.D in Chemical Engineering from MIT\n\nChairman - Scott Honour, Managing Partner of Northern Pacific Group, previously Senior Managing Director of The Gores Group (which has completed four blank check company mergers in the past), and former candidate for Governor of Minnesota\n\n**Opinion:**\n\nGood mix of personnel in the management team with a wide range of backgrounds. Nothing that jumps out at me but no red flags which is exactly what I want.\n\nBased on these short interviews of the CEO Scott Leonard, he seems like a competent, knowledgeable guy on the outside. Again, no red flags.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wx8U1byaark](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wx8U1byaark)\n\n[https://twitter.com/nyse/status/1261374888406745088](https://twitter.com/nyse/status/1261374888406745088)\n\n[https://cheddar.com/media/sustainable-opportunities-acquisition-corp-makes-nyse-debut](https://cheddar.com/media/sustainable-opportunities-acquisition-corp-makes-nyse-debut)\n\n**Objective:**\n\nSOAC.WT closed at $0.83 today, 8/24/20\n\n**Opinion:**\n\nSOAC.WT is such good value right now. I believe SOAC.WT has the potential to do well when you compare its price to other current blank check company warrants that are &gt; $1.50 and don't even have a letter of intent yet. You are getting a sub- $1 warrant at basically its ground floor that has the ability to run to much higher numbers.\n\n**Objective:**\n\nSOAC is targeting a business combination in late 2020 or early 2021 ([source](https://www.greenspac.com/))\n\n**Opinion:**\n\nThe timeline target of late 2020 or early 2021 will be here before you know it. That being said, SOAC.WT is not a short term play for me. SOAC.WT is not something I plan to buy now and sell in a week. It is a medium to long term play as SOAC based on its business target combination of late 2020 or early 2021. SOAC.WT only began trading on 6/26/20 so we are honestly still only in the early stages.\n\nWhat that said, getting in SOAC.WT now at these prices can lead to even more rewards than if I waited until Q4 2020 or Q1 2021 before buying. My hopes is that by the time Q4 2020 is here, the price of SOAC.WT will be nowhere near where they are now.\n\n**Final thoughts:**\n\nSOAC.WT is everything that I am looking for in a blank check company warrant. Warrants are obviously more risky than commons however I believe in this case, SOAC.WT provides the risk/reward profile that I am happy with.\n\n**Disclaimer:**\n\nI have been steadily accumulating SOAC warrants for the past two weeks. Further, my plan is to take some of my (hopeful) profits from SHLL/GRAF/FMCI/SPAQ to SOAC.WT after their respective runs.\n\n**TLDR:** SOAC.WT is a blank check company with an ESG (**E**nvironmental, **S**ocial, **G**overnance) focus. ESG will only have a bigger and bigger impact on the stock market (and stock success) as time goes on whether it is due to the Coronavirus pandemic, the growing threat of climate change, the increasing trend toward investing in socially responsible companies, and the continued fight for social justice (among others). Based on a number of factors including SOAC.WT's current price (sub-$1 warrants), timeline (business combination target in late 2020 or early 2021), and possible target sector (auto/EV, transportation, technology, energy), I believe SOAC.WT is great value for its risk/reward profile.",

        "selftext": "People ask, why should my \"checking account\" just be FAANMG, $TQQQ (fun to own 100 shares to wheel) and $SPY and forget about \"actively managed funds?\"  \n\nThis is the year of the active investor ETF and I have no time to rebalance all these positions PLUS my FANG (not included at all in all but one has GOOG in these ETFs.)   I suggest buying $TSLA and realize it is down to 5% in the $ARKK (these numbers below change because active management!  And that is why they are better than the $QQQ vs. $SPY or $VOO vs. $VOOG!\n\nARKK Top 10 Holdings Tesla Inc 8.75% Invitae Corp. 6.97% Square, Inc. Class A 6.75% CRISPR Therapeutics AG5.88% Roku, Inc. Class A4.99% Proto Labs, Inc. 3.87% 2U, Inc. 3.76% Illumina, Inc. 3.55%\n\nARKQ Top 10 Holdings Tesla Inc 9.83% 2U, Inc. Xilinx, Inc. Materialise NV Sponsored ADR 5.40% Stratasys Ltd. Proto Labs, Inc. Alphabet Inc. Class C 3.77% Kratos Defense &amp; Security Solutions, Inc.\n\n**ARKW Top** **10** **Holdings** Tesla Inc 8.92% Square, Inc. Class A 7.47% Roku, Inc. Class A 6.11% 2U, Inc. Zillow Group, Inc. Class C 3.14 Xilinx, Inc. LendingTree, Inc. Facebook, Inc. Class A 3.01%\n\nAgain, ARK has sold $TSLA to rebalance their actively managed fund because it is not just indexed equal weight ($QQQE and $QQEW equal weighted) vs large weighted heavy on FANG ($QQQ.)    \n\nARK is to be held in ADDITION to FAANMG.  \\[FB, Microsoft, Amazon, Netflix, Google\\] or just holding the $XLK (think $APPL about the same dividend) and $XLC (Netflix and Google exposure.)\n\nARKF Top 10 Holdings Square, Inc.

MGI Digital Graphic Technology 5.02% Straumann **Holding** AG 5.00% HP Inc. Stratasys Ltd. Materialise NV Sponsored ADR 4.58%\n\n**ARKG Top 10 Holdings Invitae Corp**. CRISPR Therapeutics AG 11.25% Arcturus Therapeutics Holdings, Inc. Illumina, Inc. Compugen Ltd. Twist Bioscience Corp. Iovance Biotherapeutics Inc 3.57% CareDx, Inc.\n\nNOTE:  $ARKG shares NOTHING but Illumina with the $IBB, and the $XBI has no Moderna, so buy all three!  Also, I would be buying shares of $DHR at $200, $TMO at $400, and Regeneron at $595 as they seem to not be loved by these ETFs.\n\n**IBB Top** **10** **Holdings** Gilead Sciences, Inc. 6.92% Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 6.51% Illumina, Inc. 6.10% Biogen Inc. 3.54% Moderna, Inc. 3.05% Seattle Genetics, Inc. 2.98% Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 2.44% BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. 2.30%\n\n**XBI Top** **10** **Holdings** Novavax, Inc. 3.63% OPKO Health, Inc. 2.20% Emergent BioSolutions Inc. 1.84% Sorrento Therapeutics, Inc. 1.77% Invitae Corp. 1.71% Inovio Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 1.51% Amicus Therapeutics, Inc. 1.37% SAGE Therapeutics, Inc. 1.36%\n\nI prefer to have 100 shares of $ARKG and I cannot tell if the $IBB is breaking out or breaking down.\n\nSolar:  the myth is that $ARKK has solar in it.  I suggest both $ICLN at $12.50 and $TAN at $45.\n\nICLN Top 10 Holdings Sunrun Inc. 6.90% SolarEdge Technologies, Inc. 6.80% Plug Power Inc. 6.04% Xinyi Solar Holdings Ltd. 5.98% Enphase Energy, Inc. 5.96% First Solar, Inc. 5.05% Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy, S.A.4.76% Vestas Wind Systems A/S4.51% Search Results\n\nTAN Top 10 Holdings SolarEdge Technologies, Inc. Sunrun Inc. First Solar, Inc. Enphase Energy, Inc. Xinyi Solar Holdings Ltd. Vivint Solar Inc 5.48% Daqo New Energy Corp. Sponsored ADR 5.02% Solaria Energia y Medio Ambiente, S.A. 4.22%\n\nTL;DR ONLY $TAN and $ICLN overlap because both are SOLAR. ARK are the best actively managed funds ever. You are getting zero exposure to the companies I listed if you do not add Solar. Also note $ARKK sold $TSLA so buy the stonk when it dips down to $1350 again. Please buy $PRNT and $ARKG as well, put them in a drawer, and hold them for 3-5 years.",
