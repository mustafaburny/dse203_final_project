        "selftext": "What's up fellas at Options. I made a tool called [FD Ranker](https://www.swaggystocks.com/dashboard/stocklabs/fd-ranker) that logs the average IV of popular tickers. The tool is inclusive of almost 1,000 tickers now.\n\n**What is this tool good for**\n\nI posted in ThetaGang the list with HIGH IV options which is great for running the wheel or selling options. This list is an inverse of that list and displays tickers where IV is pretty low, thus, purchasing calls will likely be cheaper. For example, AAPL implied volatility right now is almost back to the pre-March lows. Remember a low IV can go lower and a high IV can go higher. Do your DD before entering any positions!\n\n# Low IV Tickers List\n\n\\*Some of the market cap data is off, so always double check before entering any plays!\n\nPlease note this list is only inclusive of the more popular tickers mentioned around Reddit. If you want to see the full list and filter by ticker, check out the tool in the link at the top.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n|Ticker|Market Cap|Stock Price|IV (%)|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|SPY - SPDR S&amp;P 500|325B|$369.00|16%|\n|PEP - Pepsico Inc.|200B|$145.04|18%|\n|VZ - Verizon Communications|243B|$58.84|18%|\n|COST - Costco Wholesale Corp|161B|$364.69|20%|\n|PG - Procter &amp;

        "selftext": "**Yes, its true**.  The liquidity programs we've come to know and love--the true \"pumps\"\u2014are stagnating or contracting, and it's clear SPY doesn't like this.  We are our own out there people. Let me break down for you how and why that is; and what we can do to save our tendies.\n\n*First, let\u2019s take a quick look at the vehicles that the FED has used to keep us propped up that I\u2019m referencing:*\n\n**Overnight short-term loans (Repo, Reverse Repo operations)**\n*What It Is*\n[More detailed description I did back in the day here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hcdpox/dd_playing_vxx_and_spy_against_the_fed_repo/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf), but this is the process by which the FED has been giving banks overnight loans so they could make asset purchases.  They used to give these loans to each other, but the process became fucked up and expensive and the FED stepped in to fix this by offering the loans themselves at a low rate.  Once the pandemic hit, they took the unprecedented step of offering the loans with zero additional interest for themselves, basically offering free money.\n[\u20180 basis points over IOER\u2019 is nerd speak for \u2018fucking free money\u2019](https://i.imgur.com/tD780yn.jpg)\n**-Did it work?  Yes.**  \nFed Policy typically takes a couple of months to affect the market.  With that in mind, you can see that the performance of SPY correlates with the interest rate and bid volume on overnight repo operations.  Free money policy was instituted in March, and the impact gained full strength in the spring.\n[look at this insane Repo activity in early June when the loans were free money. SPY was +7% month to date!](https://i.imgur.com/3bwjqd5.jpg)\n\n**Treasuries** \nI won't go too deep into treasury purchases and its effect on market activity, but the simplified version is this; **if the FED needs to flood the market with money by pushing people to invest in vehicles aside from safe, boomer treasuries, they will buy up the treasuries themselves.**  This raises the price of treasuries by starving the market, thus giving them less yield--in other words, making them less valuable.  With less yield, people turn to stocks.  That's an oversimplified version of how it works, but you get the gist; the FED buys treasuries so people buy stonks.\n**-Did it work? Yes**.\nTake a look at the yield rate on treasuries here.  [At this time in 2019, the 20 year yield was up as high as 2.2%](https://i.imgur.com/1fLBbE3.jpg).  But, take a look at what happens after March.  The Fed begins buying up the treasuries, and the yield goes down to .98 in April.  All you need to know is that means the yield on treasuries was dogshit so people were pressured to buy stonks.\n\"How do you know this was the Fed's doing?\"\nThey said it.  [Here is one of many statements from the FED](https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/opolicy/operating_policy_200312a) saying \"we are going to by the fuck out of treasuries at an increased rate because of COVID\".  How increased?  Take a look at this photo, we are talking about an average of 10 or 20 billion dollars, to 80 million dollars a clip.\n[treasury spending increased 3 fold](https://i.imgur.com/J08Av7D.jpg)\n\n**Bond Repurchases**\nIn March the FED announced they would be buying corporate bonds in another major boost to available liquidity.  Just as SPY got shaky, it was an added boost immeditely after the June  crash (a crash, btw, caused by a change in the repo loan interest rates).  Basically, when large companies need money they issue bonds to shore up cash that are available to the public (same shit as treasuries, basically)--the FED is now buying those bonds.  This direct infusion of cash from the FED is about as close to outright buying stock in companies as you can get.\n**Did it work? Yes**. \nSee: June rebound.  Also google some of the types of companies they're buying bonds from.  There's a reason why the fact that nobody is paying rent hasn't caused a mortgage-backed credit crisis for major banks...yet.\n\n*So, weve established the main tools the FED uses to prop up the market and that they work.  What\u2019s the problem, and why am I saying JPOW has forsaken us?*\n\n**Because the Fed\u2019s balance sheet has been contracting, and with that these programs are no longer offering nearly as favorable terms as they once were, but the market isn\u2019t strong enough to handle those unfavorable terms.**\n\n[here\u2019s a graph from the FED showing their flatlining balance sheet](https://i.imgur.com/CoRcfBb.jpg)\nThe FED is spending less overall than it was earlier this year (remember, it takes a couple months for spending policy to catch up in the market).  *This was bound to happen, but the problem is the key programs I mentioned are all at obviously ineffective levels and haven\u2019t been increased.*\n**a) Repo operations haven\u2019t been at a lower cost interest level since July**, from +0 basis points over the standard interest rate, to +5--and on longer term loan operations +10.  The market has not responded kindly to losing their free money, looking at the monthly SPY charts.\n**b) While generous, the treasuries purchases have stalled out at 80 million**.  More importantly, the FED hasn't facilitated any key changes to which terms they purchase (long v short, etc). The market has responded to this stagnation with stagnation, looking at the monthly SPY charts.\n**c) Bond purchases not set to increase**: The FED is still purchasing bonds, but have also stagnated the rates of that along with the other two facilities.  Kaplan, the Dallas Fed Chair who's always running his mouth, has [indicated a lack of support for increased corporate bond purchases. ](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/02/kaplan-says-hes-not-in-favor-of-fed-increasing-bond-purchases.html)\n\n**What the contracting FED balance sheet, the stagnation of these increased liquidity programs, and the lackluster performance of SPY over the past three months combine to signal is that the market/SPY is NOT healthy enough on their own to continue its rise.  If you take the 5 day election bump out the picture, SPY has performed over 50% less than its aggregrate performance April-August.**\n\nWhy did I say don't buy the dip YET? Is help coming?  Yes.  Two options:\n**1) The stimulus**: if enhanced UI benefits are improved, the spending in the consumer goods and credit market would provide a huge boost that could offset the economic effects of an increasingly bleek jobs situation.\n\n**2) The FOMC meeting on the 16th**: this is where the FED would make any decisive changes on the lending programs mentioned here.  My guy /u/curiousmaniac pointed out to me that these changes, if they even happened, likely wouldn't come to fruition in the new year (even if the policy is changed on the 16th).\n\n**So yeah, you might wanna chill on SPY. I hear you saying \u201cwhere was this BEFORE TODAY?! REVISIONIST HISTORY\u201d**\n-[here's my DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k9zcbo/why_the_market_is_becoming_the_economy_a_tale_of/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) from Tuesday saying not to go near SPY without a stimulus\n-[heres my tweet](https://twitter.com/yourboymilt/status/1336366986545098752?s=21) from last week calling the top of SPY at 370\nTo be fair, I'm wrong a fucking ton, as we all are lol. but gotta flx those few sweet moments you get it right.\n\n**Positions:**\nTLT is my new hedge against SPY because VIX and its derivatives are ass rn. I dont buy puts cuz im not sweet like that.  (here's my[ DD on VIX 101 if you're curious](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jfhdta/volatility_for_dummies_vxx_uvxy_vxx_and_spy/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf))\nOther than that, monthly stimulus plays that favor consumer spending (on places that are at an advantage from hybrid online/retail models due to lockdown), TOL (housing numbers explode when stimmy passes), and TDOC because TDOC is dope. \n\n**WMT: 1/8 155c**\n**TGT: 1/8 180c**\n**TDOC 11/24 200c**\n**TDOC 1/15 205c**\n**AAPL: 1/8 126c**\n**HPQ: 1/15 25c**\n**TOL 1/15 46c**\n\n\n**TLDR**: FED tools are drying up, SPY is toodangerous for now--market isn't strong enough on its own yet.  Count on monthlies that are a hybrid of pandemic retail/online winnersin preparation for the stimulus, and pay attention the results of FOMC meeting on the 16th.  VXX sucks and I'm using TLT as a hedge.\n\n**TLDR of the TLDR**: PLTR 1/15 500c, GME 12/24 35c\n\nill try to update contextual news and moves here at the end of the day if alot of people read this, and moves on my twitter yourboymilt since theres no notification thing here (not my fault mods)",

        "selftext": "**For months now, each meeting of the FED and Jerome Powell speech has stated the same things in varied terms:** 1) We are not raising interest rates 2) We really, really need a congressional stimulus and 3) Yes we are deep in our fucking bag, but we still got Qauntitiative Easing tools, so don't sleep\n\nGiven this repetitiveness of guidance, you'd assume the FOMC meetings to come are just boring ass affairs.  But, if you dig a little deeper into the nerdom, there are specific, subtle reasons this meeting in particular could have a huge affect on quantitative easing measures and the broader market, including SPY.\n\n**I\u2019m particularly viewing this through the lens of Federal Reserve pushback to Treasury and Congress**. His rhetoric has been clear; \u2018we have done what we are going to do, for now, and the onus for a healthy economy is on the fiscal stimulus.  Our measures designed to be a temporary stopgap, not polic\u2019 Yet the treasury and congress haven\u2019t done their part. But his response choices do exist; and are more subtly complex than it may seem.  Let's take a journey through QE, and what the options are at the FOMC.\n\nThe first thing to understand is what the 2 popularized big guns of QE are, and that it is very, very unlikely we're going to see change to them.\n\n**1) The lowering of the Federals funds rate**\n*Current: ~0 (.25%, goal between 0 and .25%)*\n*Last year this time: 1.75%*\n**Any likely changes?** Hell no\nGood news is that the Fed rate is obviously not increasing, as Powell has made it clear this isn't even on the table until 2023.  The other option--a negative federal interest rate--is also unlikely.  Not solely because of the fact that it's a tool to be saved for a much more distressed market, but because it would signal a level of panic that the Fed would see as a detrement to the markets, particularly heading into the new year.\n**MM quote:**\n&gt;... the Fed will leave the Fed funds target rate at 0-0.25% next Wednesday, promising to keep it there until the goal of maximum employment and inflation being \u201con track to moderately exceed 2% for some time\u201d is met \u2013 their \u201cdot\u201d diagram will continue to suggest this won\u2019t happen before 2023.\n\n[MORE HERE](https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/fundamental/forecast/weekly/usd/2020/12/13/US-Dollar-Outlook-Hinges-on-Federal-Reserve-Interest-Rate-Decision.html)\n\n**2) Expansion of Fed asset purchases**\n*Current: $120B (80B of treasuries purchases, 40B of Mortgage-backed securities)*\nThis has been the Fed's most powerful tool in stimulating the markets, particularly the treasuries.  More on this type of activity here [DD link], but the long and short of it is that the more treasuries the Fed purchases, the more market participants are pressured to buy stonks instead of bonds.\n**Any likely changes?** Probably not.\nGiven that the stimulus talks are stalling for like the 70th time while COVID cases are rising and important economic factors like weekly jobs numbers are tanking,  there *has* been reserved optimism that the Fed could decide to expand it's balance sheet on asset purchases.  The overall sentiment, however, is that its unlikely to see an expansion for the same reason we won't see a change to the Federal interest rate: the desire not to create panic at such a sensitive time for the markets.\n**MM quote:**\n&gt;\tThey have to get incrementally more dovish next week...Increasing the size of QE might send a little more alarming signal than they would like to take at this moment.\u201d\n\n[MORE HERE](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/11/heres-everything-the-federal-reserve-could-do-at-its-policy-meeting-next-week.html)\n\n**So, if these changes are unlikely, what are the options left, then?**  They are subtle, but important; two FOMC factors that may not make a huge splash in the news, but could make a huge splash in the markets.\n\n**1) Tweaking which treasuries they purchase, shuffling around the 80B to longer dated maturities:**\nThe Fed could decide to fuck around with the steepening yield curve.  By moving their purchases to more longer dated bond maturities (for example, shifting more of the 80B QE fund to purchasing 20/30 year maturity bonds instead of 10) they could end up providing a fairly large boost to stonk buying without actually spending more money overall on the balance sheet.  There is chatter that the Fed wants to do whatever is possible to keep yields on the 20 at 1% or lower, and this move could do it.\n**Is this likely to happen?** 50/50\nSome market watchers think it will happen because the factors mentioned earlier necessitate it (stimulus deadlock, virus uptick, struggling jobs numbers).  Yes, there is a vaccine coming, but the market has to *survive* in the meantime, and a lot of factors are stacked against it.\n**Do I think it will happen?**Probably not.  \nI don\u2019t think the Fed wants to roil the treasuries market around the holidays, AND would want to stay hands off with stimulus talks ongoing while this meeting is taking place\u2014the Fed wants, and needs, to put pressure on congress for fiscal stimulus and leaving the yield curve untouched will do that.  Any further yield curve tinkering will signal to congress that help is there for their precious stonks wiht or without the stimulus passing.  If stimmy talks fail again, though, I definitely think this could come to fruition at the January meeting.\nMM quote:\n&gt;A number of economists believe that the Fed should tamp down on any further steepening of the U.S. Treasury yield curve by shifting the focus of its purchases to longer-dated bonds from shorter-dated instruments.\n\n**2) Outcome-based guidance**\nThis term sounds like bullshit but it is not.  This essentially means \u201cthe Fed will peg QE measures 2021 to how the economy is performing, on this predetermined scale\u201d  The reason it\u2019s not bullshit is because, without discussing the Federal funds rate, it gives both the public and (probably more importantly) Congress an idea of what kind of footing the economy needs to be on, by when, and how the Fed will respond.\n**Is this lilkely to happen?** Yes.  \nMost market watchers are expecting some sort of firm guidance to show us where we could go in 2021.\n**Do I think it will happen? ** Yes.  \nI think, [especially after the Treasury started beef with the Fed by putting an end to critical crises-era programs ](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/19/treasury-seeks-to-extend-some-emergency-fed-programs-but-end-others-including-main-street-facility.html), the Fed is going to pushback by tying the Fed\u2019\u2019 programming to economic indicators which can be largely effected by fiscal stimulus.  There is more the Fed can do, as they\u2019\u2019e stated many times, but at this point our growing economic woes are self-inflicted, and I expect guidance to reflect that.\nMM quote:\n&gt;We could see a change in guidance relating to the asset purchases, which currently stand at $80bn of Treasuries and $40bn of Mortgage Backed Securities each month. At present they merely comment that \u201cover coming months\u201d the purchases will continue \u201cat least at the current pace\u201d. Officials have hinted they could make the pace of purchases more conditional on economic conditions. \n\n[MORE HERE](https://think.ing.com/articles/us-what-to-expect-from-the-december-fomc-meeting/)\n\n**Conclusions I\u2019m drawing:**\nI don\u2019t think the Fed is offering shit in terms of solid market help through, really, the only potential way it would\u2014\u2014a shift into purchasing a larger amount of longer-dated maturities within the current 80B treasury purchase budget.  It seems like the market, from a lot of articles I\u2019ve read, is holding out hope on that (especially in light of worsening conditions), so if it doesn\u2019t happen we definitely got a dip coming.\n\n**I\u2019m viewing the importance of this meeting in the context of several problematic outside factors\u2014stimulus talks stalling, Brexit and the Europoors on they full Oliver Twist rn, and terrible job numbers likely coming this week.**  I know PFE was given the go-ahead this weekend, but I don\u2019t have much confidence in that carrying us much past the likely green Monday with such a turbulent week ahead (my 367c 12/14 im bagholding certainly fucking hope so on the Monday part).\n\nSPY is already unperforming by typical December standards, and certainly by the year\u2019s insane standard. **So then, by my logic, market momentum truly becomes an issue of two factors: FOMC meeting results, and the stimulus talks going well.  I will be the first to admit that my optimism on the stimulus is seeming increasingly incorrect**, and I\u2019m growing doubtful it will be finished next week\u2014though there will be lots of little meaningless \u201ctalk\u201c going well\u201d pum\u201ds.\n*The questions is\u2014will\u2014Pow and the FED use their big, swinging QE tools to save EOY market optimism during this FOMC meeting? For me, the signs point to no.*\n\n**Positions**\nI know I know, I literally just said I hate VIX and have broken up with it, but I took another look, and rethought about it\u2019s pur\u2019ose.  I do believe by Tuesday, especially assuming we are green-ish or flat Monday, there will be a spike in options premiums in preparation for the FOMC and Stimulus shenanigans.  That said, I will be keeping\u2014but trimming\u2014 my precious calls positions \n\n(**AAPL, TDOC, TOL, HPQ, TGT, WMT**) and adding quite a bit of these on Monday EOD\n**VXX 12/24 18c**\n**VXX 1/8 18.50c**\n**VXX 1/15 20c**\n\nThese are not permanent positions, this is me riding the wave of the turbulence likely in the next week or two, and forward looking volatility hedges for inauguration.\nIn case Jerome does decide to cap longer-term maturity yields strapping a hedge of \n**TLT 12/24 158p**\n\nTLDR: Not much help is likely to come from the FOMC meeting this week, but there is potential for a big subtle change in bond purchases.  My thesis is that this meeting will be the opportunity for the Fed to push pressure back to congressional fiscal stimulus, so Powell can provide guidance on when and how it will direct it\u2019s balance sheet in 2021.  FOMC is a way bigger deal this time around than usual, please pay attention.\n\n**TLDR of TLDR:** Theta gang probably wins, but maybe grab some VXX bro\n\n*NOTE: I\u2019ll put updates I see here at the top each day as I have done elsewhere, and quick news and moves aggregated here and in spurts on my twitter @yourboymilt since there\u2019s no notification format for Reddit (sorry mods, not my fault). *",

        "selftext": "This is super long, so if you don't wanna read it skip to the TLDR.  This also isn't a revolutionary thesis, \"we need stimmy!\" but I wanted to breakdown why it's important, at least in my view.\n\n**Long story short:** the importance of this year's booming rally has largely hinged on: a)increased liquidity through FED repo lending mechanisms and b) dramatically increased consumer opportunities created by enhanced UI benefits, and where people chose to spend it.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n**1) The rise and fall of FED liquidity via short term loans**\n\nFor those who were around in the halcyon days of the late spring and early summer, we witnessed SPY do some amazing things together.\u00a0 For review, I noted two specific mechanisms that were largely behind the barrage of green dildos raining down daily:\n\n1a.) *Free money repo operations:* to simplify it, this is the process by which financial entities borrow money from each other for overnight asset purchases; it's a closed, short term loan ecosystem.\u00a0 This became a bloated and expensive process in 2019, leading to somewhat of a mini-crisis, and the FED stepped in to offer their own low interest short-term loans. When the March crash came, the FED sent this lending vehicle into hyperdrive, throwing hundreds of billions of dollars a week into low interest short-term loan operations for banks.\u00a0 How low?\n\n**Free. They were offering overnight swaps with banks, using treasury as collateral, and charging ZERO additional interest on them.**\n\n(photo of Repo operation details)--you see, IOER plus ZERO BASIS POINTS.\u00a0 *Literally, free money.*\n\nSince the Spring, SPY has petered out.  Up and down, boomer-esque gains have replaced the BTD logic of summer.  Below is the difference in price and percent for the first trading day in each month compared to the last.\u00a0 Things got shaky in the fall. (note that it is typically assumed that FED balance sheet adjustments take about one-two months to show results, good or bad)\n\nMay to June: 280.43/303 = **8%**\nJune to july: 303/ 309.28= 2% (note below)\nJuly to August (3) = 309.28/ 328.74= **6.2%**\nAugust to September= 328.74/ 351.19= **6.8%**\nSeptember to October = 351.19/ 337.04= **-4.19%**\nOctober to November = 337.04/ 330.20= **2%**\nNovember to December= 330.20/ 366.02= 10.84% (note below)\n**The 3 days preceding and following the election were responsible for 7.3% of the November rise, so Nov is something of an outlier. The 2% in June came due to the crash, which was caused by the very thing I'm solidifying--a change in the Fed overnight loan terms)\n\nAlso since the Spring, the amount of people participating in overnight Repo operations has petered out.\u00a0 Why? Because it's not longer free money.\u00a0 **The FED's bread and butter liquidity operation for short term loans changed their interest terms.\u00a0 This is so important that it was the largest catalyst for the June crash.\u00a0 Stories broke on the 10th and 11th that the Fed would be\u00a0 \"tweaking\" the overnight lending rates, from the \"free money\" 0 points over IOER to 5 points over on the overnight, and 10 points on the term.** Do the math; if the story breaks on the 11th stating the FED would be increasing the rate on their overnight loan operations, and the Street catches wind likely a day or two before that...what do you think causes the crash on the 11th?\u00a0 The FED program has been steadily increasing to a standard +10 interest charge.\n\nSo, the FED has dried up it's free money overnight lending, an it would seem to coincide with SPY slowing down.\n\n1b.) The end of double pump Tuesdays\nOnce upon a time I wrote about the \"Double Pump\"--typically on Tuesday--when the FED would offer both term AND overnight repo operations on the same day, at the IOER +0 (free money) rate.\u00a0 However, once the interest rate climbed to +5 points it became obsolete; it's more common to see zero takers on repo/reverse repo operations than it is to see more than one taker, nowadays.\u00a0 Tuesdays were guaranteed green at a 90% rate--and then FED lending practices changed, and poof.\n\nThe details of all this shit is boring, but the point is this: once the COVID crash hit, in order to grease the wheels to getting the market back on track the FED was employing multiple avenues to give financial entities money to play with mostly via its absurdly low-cost loan swap programs.\n\n\nThese repo lending programs becoming more expensive are apart of a larger general trend; the shrinking FED balance sheet.\u00a0 Although in recent months they have lightly picked spending back up, we have flatlined from the huge jump we saw in March and April in response to the pandemic.\u00a0\n\n[photo] look at that level-off, this shit matter\n\n**2) Stimulus play money go bye-bye**\nStimmy pumps aren't much, unless you're betting 0DTE, but the underlying importance of an economic stimulus that benefits consumers is. There are three simple measures signifying it's importance as a liquidity pump:\n\n2a.) Consumer spending: when the stimulus began to hit in April/May, we saw a huge jump in consumer spending.\u00a0 You remember the lines at WMT and TGT and shit.\u00a0 In June, for example, consumer spending was expected to increase a little less than 2%--it went higher than 6%.\n\n2b.) Credit Card Debt begone: people had so much extra money from the stimulus they paid off their credit cards https://www.wsj.com/articles/consumers-flush-with-stimulus-money-shun-credit-card-debt-11596373201 .\u00a0 This is a clear indication that the stimulus funds were having a positive spending affect.\n\n2c.) Consumer choices: Used auto sales and home sales skyrocketed (link), indicating people were flush with excess cash for down payments, in addition to the ability to pay off debt.\nhttps://www.wsj.com/articles/during-covid-19-pandemic-the-used-car-lot-is-hot-11593774001\n\n**Conclusion**\nSo what the fuck am I saying?\u00a0 I'm saying that in order for the market to not reflect and react to current (horrid) employment and opportunity metrics--common measures of economic health being decimated by the COVID/lockdown return-- one of these two external liquidity injections must continue; FED balance sheet ultra expansion, or stimulus injection.\u00a0 While FED spending on QE is increasing slightly over the past few months, it's paltry in comparison March, April, and May, and is very unlikely to return to those levels.\u00a0 This is why in every speaking engagement Powell makes it clear: we need a stimulus.\n\nSo, the answer to which liquidity injection can continue is the stimulus. Specifically, the enhanced unemployment benefits that, coupled with eviction moratoriums and rent/mortgage deferment, allow consumer spending and credit debt relief on a mass scale.\u00a0 Regardless of the bickering, it is going to happen.\u00a0 The enhanced UI will happen, in particular, because more widespread lockdowns are going to hurt jobs numbers, thus lending the Dems the leverage they need.\u00a0 UI benefits are tied to employment, and even McConnell is acknowledging there is no way around that.\n\n**I see a lot of people talking about the stimulus in the daily thread, so here are some basics:**\n1) Direct payments are likely not happening this time, or at a depressed level (talk of $600)\n2) UI enhancements will be reinstated at at least $300 extra weekly, backdated to June 1st\n3) There will be another eviction moratorium extension, probably for 3, 4 months\n4) It doesn't matter what the white house wants--the chain of approval goes House vote (Nancy), then Senate vote (McConnell).\u00a0 Any vote in either house that hasn't been supported by the other chamber is DOA and pure political stunt.\n5) The big hangup is corporate liability protection for Democrats (businesses, schools, hospitals want lawsuit immunity from COVID cases) and State and Local Government Aid for the Democrats (money to be used at the discretion of localities, including social programming, policing, education).\n6) Its going to pass this negotiation cycle because it's tied to a government shutdown.\n\n\nPositions: Arming for the next round of stimulus\n\n\nSPY: stay away, honestly.\u00a0 Even after the initial pump, there will still be several rounds of voting needed, between committees and chambers, each with it's own bad news cycle days and good news cycle days.\n\n\nI'm also staying away from small cap trash and looking at companies who most benefit from restriction rules, integrated online systems well, or both.\u00a0 I had a good sense this dip was coming yesterday, so I'm loading up on these at EOD:\n\n\nStrong retail:\nWMT: 1/8 155c\nTGT: 1/8 180c\n\n\nConsumer electronics that boomed in lockdown 1:\nAAPL: 1/8 126c\nHPQ: 1/15 25c\nOnce people realize that telehealth is here to stay, TDOC merger is actually dope as fuck, and vaccine logistics are going to take forever:\nTDOC 11/24 200c\nTDOC 1/15 205c\nI just fucking like TOL, so \nTOL 1/15 46c\n\nTLDR: To stave off a bear market reflecting wider economic conditions, we need a continuation of either 0 interest FED short-term loan programs or an economic stimulus--stimulus is more likely. SPY, without these two things, has shown waning strength over the past few months.\u00a0 Buy calls like the stimulus is coming in the next few weeks, but stay away from SPY generally and pick consumer-spending winners with dual in-person/online presence.\n\n*If I find interesting stimulus news I'll put it in updates here. If I ditch a position I'll update why here, if it's quick news\u00a0 or moves I try to update on twitter--YourBoyMilt-- people got super mad one time about updates not notifying on here, so yeah.  Not my fault, mods*",

        "selftext": "What's up fellas at Options. I made a tool called [FD Ranker](https://www.swaggystocks.com/dashboard/stocklabs/fd-ranker) that logs the average IV of popular tickers. The tool is inclusive of almost 1,000 tickers now.\n\n**What is this tool good for**\n\nI posted in ThetaGang the list with HIGH IV options which is great for running the wheel or selling options. This list is an inverse of that list and displays tickers where IV is pretty low, thus, purchasing calls will likely be cheaper. For example, AAPL implied volatility right now is near the lows and almost back to the pre-March lows. Remember a low IV can go lower and a high IV can go higher. Do your DD before entering any positions!\n\nIf you guys find this list useful (it's my first time posting this here), I can make this a weekly/weekend thing. I like doing it on Sundays so I can prepare for the trading week ahead.\n\n# High IV Tickers List\n\n\\*Some of the market cap data is off, so always double check before entering any plays! Also, the \"next earnings date\" data will resume starting in January, 2021 (very soon).\n\nPlease note this list is only inclusive of the more popular tickers mentioned around Reddit.

        "selftext": "Some noob DD from me. I think these stocks are a great long term hold. Don't use this as advice, do your own DD. Informative purposes only\n\nI've been looking at *PyroGenesis (PYR.TO)* ever since they announced they were looking to uplist on NASDAQ. PyroGenesis Canada Inc. designs, develops, manufactures, and commercializes advanced plasma processes and systems in Canada and internationally. \nThey are involved in Metals, Waste management, Innovation &amp; Custom Process development (HPQ-Silicon), Plasma Torches (see previous DD by [/u/Greasyfork](https://old.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/ki68nc/get_in_brotendos_were_going_green_pyrogenesis_pyr/)\n\nTwo of their main products piqued my interest- \n\n**1)- Plasma torches**\n\nThese plasma torches are an environmentally friendly alternative to using fossil fuels in the Iron Pelletization industry. Currently PyroGenesis is the only company that has a patent for such a process in the industry. \n\nJust recently, they announced they had a contract with a major iron ore supplier equaling $3.6M\n\nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/pyrogenesis-signs-initial-plasma-torch-213000493.html\nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/pyrogenesis-signs-additional-1-1mm-133500724.html\n\nIt also mentions there that \"The Client, which has committed to reduce its greenhouse gas (\u201cGHG\u201d) emissions, has over ten (10) plants, each possibly requiring up to 50 plasma torches.\" - That's approx $50-60M future revenue that the client has committed to purchase exclusively from PyroGenesis. PyroGenesis will also be providing after sale services to this client for additional revenue\n\nThat is just ONE contract with one company. Expect many more contracts over the years as more companies decide to ditch fossil fuels and go with a more green solution\n\n**2- Innovation &amp; Custom Process development (HPQ-Silicon)**\n\nThat brings to the second company on my radar, *HPQ Silicon Resources (HPQ.V, OTC:URAGF)*\nThey are involved in the exploration, mining, and production of silicon metals, solar grade silicon metals, and porous silicon wafers.\n\nA few months ago, PyroGenesis &amp; HPQ Silicon signed an agreement to develop The PUREVAPTM NSiR process. Once up and runing, HPQ NANO can deliver to advanced materials companies and battery manufacturers a cost competitive, tailor-made product, that can replace graphite in batteries and thereby allow the deployment of truly powerful next generation Li-ion batteries\n\nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/hpq-silicon-pyrogenesis-sign-nano-170500452.html\n\nPyroGenesis then sold the IP rights of the PUREVAP\u2122 NSiR process which included a 10% royalty for any sales which PyroGenesis can convert into a 50% ownership of HPQ\n\nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/pyrogenesis-signs-3m-contract-hpq-174600535.html\n\nBefore they even started any production, they already have an order for the material from a major Car manufacturer \n\nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/hpq-nano-receives-first-order-190300952.html\n\nAnd earlier today, they announced that their first reactor has been commissioned and is ready to start production. \n\nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/hpq-nano-reaches-major-milestones-141000141.html\n\nI am just a small time investor, PYRO @3.2 &amp; HPQ @ 0.88c (CAD)\nAgain, do your own DD and only invest what you're prepared to lose. \nThank you for listening! \n\n**TL;DR- Buy PyroGenesis (TSX: PYR) (OTCQB: PYRNF) (FRA: 8PY) &amp; HPQ Silicone Resources (TSX: HPQ) (FWB: UGE) (Other OTC : URAGF) and you will visit moon in a few months.

        "selftext": "HPQ.V / URAGF / **HPQ-Silicon Resources Inc**\n\nHere's why I think we can get beyond 1.29 CAD / $1 USD on 12/2/2020. I've thought a lot about this, and have chosen this stock as what I foresee to be the next NIO stock in terms of gains and growth forward propulsion upwards.\u00a0\n\nIf BioSolar (EV stock) can go from $0.010 to $0.020 on No News other than SunHydrogen (FCEV stock) investors pointing it out on yahoo finance/reddit/stocktwits, because SunHydrogen going from $0.02 to $0.12 on no news and dipping to $0.06\u00a0\n\nSo we have 2 EV-centric stocks that focus on upcoming battery tech and hydrogen generation for fueling: one about battery technology that doesn't have a strong product out and is doing pilot testing. That doubled in price only because it was hyped on the other. The other being an FCEV stock which uses Hydrogen not Electric Battery as fuel. So the FCEV stocks goes 5-6x in price and dips to 3x in price, based on pure speculation. Both these stock upticks are recent and major compared to HPQ.V's for the same timeline.\n\nMeanwhile we have HPQ.V which is a pioneer in its own niche category, a niche category highly coveted and desired by both the Electric AND the Hydrogen markets in addition to other niche submarkets. We've gone up, but we are undervalued momentum wise. There is more momentum going for us than these other companies. There's more rational and fundamental logic to this stock skyrocketing. The only difference between HPQ.V and BSRC &amp; also HYSR is visibility.\n\nBSRC and HYSR get talked about on reddit often. They get talked up on Stocktwits. The RobinHood-esque trader that gets hyped up on technology and momentum sees those conversations on those boards and pumps up the value, because they see value and know the stocks are undervalued.\n\nWe as HPQ.V investors don't have a Stocktwits page. No one has mentioned the stock on that stock forum except 2 people on the help page over a week asking for a page about the stock. There are some posts on reddit about the stock, but we don't have the hype on social media boards like Stocktwits and reddit because of a few reasons\n\n1. **Not really a Penny stock:** We aren't a small penny stock, so the pennystocks subreddit overlooks us. Yes I'm posting this in the Penny stock subreddit. We are a pennystock, but we aren't a yolo 100 dollars at 0.0002 stock.\n2. **Visbility:** We don't have visibility on Stocktwits. Yes the people there seem to get super hyped on buying into stocks based on perceived value and growth, but they don't seem to know about this stock at all.\n3. **Computer Stock Confusion:** American traders who do see us on reddit or other boards may confuse HPQ.V with Hewlett Packard.\n4. **Middle Ground:** While we aren't a small penny stock, we aren't at a value high enough for the \"Retail Normies\" to give us a deeper look on the due diligence, they pass us by.\n5. **Options:** I don't know if Canadians can trade options, or sell short on this stock, but as an American, We/I cannot buy options through brokers like Ameritrade. Even If I wanted to short this stock, I wouldn't be able to do it through my broker. So the pumpers on wall street bets won't give us a solid look because we don't fit their niche.\n\nSo all of these reasons sum up to impediments in getting tech-hypers on board. There are a lot of quiet buyers, but there aren't a lot of RobinHood-like fanboys who goes bonkers about the value of the stock, because they don't know about us. If they knew about us, and could trade us, you would see many posts on reddit and stocktwits promoting the stock.\u00a0\n\nWe have a lot going for us. Even with all the impediments to what would make the stock explode upwards in value, we've gone up quite a bit already. I expect that trend to continue.\n\nI'm not looking at this stock as an opportunity to make a quick short term ordinary income gain of a couple thousands, because I don't think I could catch the knife back down and buy back in at a lower price.\u00a0\n\nWe are relatively unnoticed by the vocal social media tech posters, and we're doing really fine. I expect that to change in the coming days, weeks, months, quarters. I'm looking at this stock as a once in a life-time opportunity to make an incredible gain. To get in on a ground breaking company at the ground level where everything is starting to come together.\u00a0\n\nGood Luck to All.\n\nFurther DD Reading:  \n[https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/ivuddt/quite\\_possibly\\_the\\_biggest\\_battery\\_gamechanger/](https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/ivuddt/quite_possibly_the_biggest_battery_gamechanger/)  \n\n\n&gt;The solar and battery industries are continually growing, and HPQ, like Timminco \\[similar company went from a penny stock to \\~$30 USD\\], are saying that they are able to produce solar-grade silicon at a much cheaper cost than current methods.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;On a small scale, HPQ has shown that they are able to produce 2N to 4N silicon from low quality quartz metal which is incredible and will change the game forever... IF they are able to do it on an industrial scale.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;There were many delays but the pilot plant is built. We have yet to hear their latest findings.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;In the mean time, they have 2 NDA's signed with other companies in regards to their product. Many are hoping its Tesla. Could be, but it's not necessary for HPQ's success. Being able to convert low quality quartz into 4N silicon on a large scale will change the solar industry forever, making it much more affordable.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;To finish things off, they have a partnership with a French solar company Apollon. Their latest NR suggests they will also be working on another industry:  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;HPQ and Apollon Solar Extend Agreement to Work on Porous Silicon for Batteries and Expand Collaboration to Include Hydrogen Production  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The addition of manufacturing hydrogen by hydrolysis to our collaboration opens up a new and unique business opportunity that could represent a second multibillion-dollar addressable marketfor the PUREVAPTM Nano Silicon (Si) Reactor (\u201cNSiR\u201d) nanopowders.\u201d\n\n**Disclaimer:** I have small position in the stock under 10k USD. This is my own DD based on value and momentum factors that I have noticed. Do your own DD before making investments and don't take my post to be financial advice to increase or decrease your position, or financial advice to make any kind of trade based on what I've said.

        "selftext": "  HPQ FILES PROVISIONAL PATENT APPLICATION FOR SILICON BY- PRODUCT CREATED BY PUREVAPTM QRR AS ANODE MATERIAL FOR LITHIUM-ION BATTERIES\nPRELIMINARY BUT PROMISING RESULTS DEMONSTRATE A CAPACITY 3-4 TIMES GREATER THAN GRAPHITE FOR LITHIUM-ION BATTERIES\nMontreal, QC, Dec 29, 2020 \u2013 Innovative silicon solutions provider HPQ Silicon Resources Inc. (\u201cHPQ\u201d or \u201cthe Company\u201d) (TSX-V: HPQ; FWB: UGE; Other OTC : URAGF), is pleased to inform shareholders that promising results from electrochemical performance tests made with silicon- based by-products manufactured by the GEN2 PUREVAPTM Quartz Reduction Reactor (\u201cQRR\u201d) motivated the company to file a provisional patent application regarding their manufacturing, assembly and usage as anode materials for Lithium-ion batteries.\nThe patent application follows the completion of a series of tests made on the material produced by the GEN2 PUREVAPTM QRR at the Centre \u00c9nergie Mat\u00e9riaux T\u00e9l\u00e9communications (EMT) of the INRS by Professor Lionel ROU\u00c9 under an NSERC Engage Grant and a NSERC Engage plus Grant.\nPUREVAPTM QRR SILICON BY-PRODUCTS: A SUPERIOR ANODE MATERIAL THAN GRAPHITE\nAlthough preliminary, the results obtained are more than promising since the silicon-based by- product made with the Gen2 PUREVAPTM QRR maintained a gravimetric capacity \u2265 1,200 mAh/g for more than 100 charge/discharge cycles, a capacity 3-4 times greater than that of graphite currently used in commercial Li-ion batteries. This material is also promising in terms of high- speed performance. (See Figure 1 below)\nFigure 1. (a) Comparing electrode performance of HPQ Gen2 PUREVAPTM by-product versus graphite electrodes during cycling tests and (b) power response versus electrodes made with comparable silicon (Si).\n\u201cThis is another demonstration of our multi-prong approach to becoming a key silicon based material provider for the battery industry and beyond. The unique capabilities of the PUREVAPTM Nano Silicium Reactor (Si) (\"NSiR\") will enable us to fully exploit the potential of the Silicon and its by-products manufactured by the PUREVAPTM Quartz Reduction Reactor (\"RRQ\")\u201d said Bernard Tourillon, President and CEO HPQ Silicon. \u201cSilicon\u2019s potential to meet energy storage demand is\n      1 | Page\n\n  undeniable, generating massive investments, and serious industry interest. We are very confident that demand for the Silicon materials we will produce, with our low-cost scalable processes, will be high demand by batteries and EV manufacturers in this renewable energy revolution.\u201d\nAbout HPQ Silicon\nHPQ Silicon Resources Inc. (TSX-V: HPQ) is a Canadian Innovative Silicon Solutions Provider. Silicon (Si), also known as silicon metal, is one of today\u2019s key strategic materials needed for the\ndecarbonization of the economy and the Renewable Energy Revolution (\u201cRER\u201d).\nSilicon is the most abundant element in earth\u2019s crust but does not exist in its pure state and must be extracted from quartz (SiO2) in what has historically been a capital and energy intensive process. HPQ is building a portfolio of silicon\u2013based products using innovative scalable processes. The target objective is to produce high value speciality Silicon products using technologies that will reduce energy consumption, GHG\u2019s, and carbon footprint.\nWorking with PyroGenesis Canada Inc. (TSX: PYR), a high-tech company that designs, develops, manufactures and commercializes plasma - based processes, HPQ is developing:\n\u25cf The PUREVAPTM \u201cQuartz Reduction Reactors\u201d (QRR), an innovative process (patent pending), which will permit the one step transformation of quartz (SiO2) into high purity silicon (Si) at reduced costs, energy input, and carbon footprint that will propagate its considerable renewable energy potential.\n&gt; HPQ believes it will become the lowest cost (Capex and Opex) producer of silicon (Si) and high purity silicon metal (3N \u2013 4N Si).\n\u25cf Through its 100% owned subsidiary HPQ NANO Silicon Powders Inc, the PUREVAPTM Nano Silicon Reactor (NSiR), a new proprietary process that can use different purities of silicon (Si) as feedstock, to make a wide range of nano/micro spherical powders of difference sizes and nanowires.\n&gt; HPQ believes it can also become the lowest cost manufacturer of spherical Si nanopowders and silicon-based composites needed by manufacturers of next-generation lithium-ion batteries.\n&gt; During the coming months, spherical Si nanopowders and nanowires silicon-based composite samples requested by industry participants and research institutions\u2019 will be produced using PUREVAPTM SiNR.\nHPQ is also working with industry leader Apollon Solar of France to:\n\u25cf Use their patented process and develop a capability to produce commercially porous silicon (Si) wafers and porous silicon (Si) powders.\n&gt; The collaboration will allow HPQ to become the lowest cost producer of porous silicon wafers for all-solid -state batteries and porous silicon powders for Li-ion batteries.\n&gt; Develop the hydrogen generation potential of Silicon nanopowders for use with the GennaoTM system.\n      2 | Page\n[HPQ NANO PATENT PENDING](https://hpqsilicon.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/HPQ_INRS_PATENT-DEC_29_2002_Ver_CL3.pdf)\n  &gt; Commercialize, exclusively in Canada, and non-exclusive in the U.S.A., the GennaoTM H2 system and the chemical powders required for the hydrolysis production of Hydrogen (\"H2\").\nThis News Release is available on the company's CEO Verified Discussion Forum, a moderated social media platform that enables civilized discussion and Q&amp;A between Management and Shareholders.\nDisclaimers:\nThe Corporation\u2019s interest in developing the PUREVAPTM QRR and any projected capital or operating cost savings associated with its development should not be construed as being related to the establishing the economic viability or technical feasibility of any of the Company\u2019s Quartz Projects.\nThis press release contains certain forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, statements containing the words \"may\", \"plan\", \"will\", \"estimate\", \"continue\", \"anticipate\", \"intend\", \"expect\", \"in the process\" and other similar expressions which constitute \"forward- looking information\" within the meaning of applicable securities laws.

        "selftext": "#I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT ANYTHING PROCEED WITH CAUTION \n\nAccording to this sub there are three things going for $BB that cause it to be undervalued:\n- Cylance Acquisition \n- Blackberry IVY partnership with AWS\n- QNX \n\n## Cylance: I'll start with the one I don't know shit about \n\nThis is a crowded space (anti virus). That's all I have to say about that.\n\n## Blackberry IVY partnership with AWS:\n\nAWS is fighting hard to get market share in the edge computing space. Perfect example of this is AWS Greengrass and IoT core.\n\nWhat is [AWS Greengrass](https://aws.amazon.com/greengrass/)? It's IoT device management. AWS is going to do the device lifecycle management for QNX deployments on vehicles. (speculation) Essentially, this looks to be AWS Greengrass integrated with BB QNX.  \n\nWhy does AWS want to partner with BB QNX? Well to me, this looks to be a classic extend embrace extinguish play by Amazon. AWS has products such as IoT core that can manage telematics flow between OEMs and vehicles, what they don't have is products for in vehicle development. Once they understand the market, they will introduce AWS products along side IoT core to replace QNX piece by piece in the vehicles. \n\n## QNX\n\nOk WSB. Y'all keep saying that QNX will take $BB to the moon because all these upstart EV nobodies are using QNX to bootstrap their infotainment systems. \n\nEnter automotive linux: https://www.automotivelinux.org/\n\nAutomotive linux is a partnership with a TON of traditional OEMS to build an open source software (linux) stack for vehicles such as infotainment, edge compute and telematics. \n\nThis is effectively the nail in the coffin (IMO) for QNX. If these EV upstarts gain marketshare, they have no reason to continue paying $BB for a closed source, price-y QNX. They'll migrate to automotive linux for F R E E. No more niche QNX developers, get a generic dev with some linux info and they'll be up to speed in no time. \n\nIf QNX dies, so does the IVY partnership. In fact, since AGL linux based and open source, no doubt Amazon will make amazing AWS client libraries to integrate with Greengrass, IoT Core, etc. Once Amazon gets its fingers into AGL, IVY is dead in the water.\n\n\nSo where does this leave us? Cylance. In my know nothing option $BB's only asset is Cylance in a highly competitive space. Once virus protection entities get big enough, hackers start developing FUD (fully undetectable) solutions to the most popular virus protection software. Back in their day you think McAfee or Norton was shit? No. They became popular and had hackers develop against their software.\n\n----\n\nGL WSB on $BB. I hope you succeed. I have no position on $BB.

        "selftext": "TL;DR: CRSR looks like a bargain at $36/share and low market cap at 3 bil. PC gaming bout to explode. Check the market for this shit. GME PC build stations? Which products they gonna stock? Best in class of course (from a dedicated gaming company). Oh, and Corsair is developing affordable and accessible streaming hardware to a generation of kids who live in front of their screens and meet their friends in games? Hello, moon.\n\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83e\udd5c\ud83d\ude80\ud83e\udd5c\ud83d\ude80\ud83e\udd5c\ud83d\ude80\ud83e\udd5c\ud83d\ude80\ud83e\udd5c\n\nSo, over the past couple weeks, our beloved savior GME has truly nutted the fuck up under the astounding tutelage of Ryan \ud83e\udd5c Cohen. We\u2019ve learned that Cohen and friends are likely (or definitely, depending on which store you call) pushing for PC build stations in brick and mortar GameStop stores. Just a matter of time before this happens (suck my dick, COVID). If you\u2019re like me, this news made your 2-inch, Cohen-ready pen0r stand at ultimate attention. \n\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83e\udd5c\ud83d\ude80\ud83e\udd5c\ud83d\ude80\ud83e\udd5c\ud83d\ude80\ud83e\udd5c\ud83d\ude80\n\nAs of now, PC builds are fucking confusing for consumers attempting to enter the space. While PCs provide a much better gaming experience, as well as greater modification opportunities, for consumers, it\u2019s intimidating as fuck for people eager to enter the space. I, for one, tried to dig into this during the summer, and I was stonewalled by: A. An overwhelming amount of options; B. Conflicting information; C. Lack of knowledge in building my own PC. \n\nIf only I had someone who could just fucking tell me what to buy and what to do to create and build a PC that fits my budget while providing an in-person experience with physical products on display... Because what the fuck am I even looking at on MicroCenter.com? And why, when I go to MicroCenter, do every single one of those tie-wearing FUCKS try to sell me Norton anti-virus??? As a gamer, I\u2019d much rather be sold a Gamepass subscription, honestly... (GME + MSFT DD).\n\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83e\udd5c\ud83d\ude80\ud83e\udd5c\ud83d\ude80\ud83e\udd5c\ud83d\ude80\ud83e\udd5c\ud83d\ude80\n\nNow, when I walk into GameStop and head to the PC build station, which products are going to be stocked???? \n\nWell, after combing through Reddit, as well as tapping the knowledge of my PC-gaming friends who\u2019ve been doing this shit since I was jerking it to fuzzy, late-night, X-rated cable stations (you mini autists don\u2019t know a thing about the struggle pre-PornHub), the consensus was very clear:\n\nCorsair makes the best shit. They\u2019re the best at what they do. Albeit a bit overpriced... but the best in class. And PC people don\u2019t mind spending top-dollar for long lasting gear (PC Master Race or whatever, okay, cool, ya fuckin neckbeard Nazi). \n\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83e\udd5c\ud83d\ude80\ud83e\udd5c\ud83d\ude80\ud83e\udd5c\ud83d\ude80\ud83e\udd5c\ud83d\ude80\n\nSo what does Corsair make that\u2019s so great? Some of the most important shit you need for a build, as well as peripherals:\n\n- CPU/GPU coolers\n- SSDs\n- Cases \n- Keyboards \n- Mice \n- Speakers \nEtc etc \n\nWhat is most exciting about Corsair in the near future is their push for selling affordable streaming hardware. Check this shit out: [Corsair &amp; Elgato ](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.tomshardware.com/amp/news/corsair-acquires-epoccam-app-to-boost-elgato-game-streaming-business)\n\nThese young kids aren\u2019t even getting their fucking LICENSE TO DRIVE A CAR because all their stupid fucking friends are online circlejerking to Fortnite streams. These kids don\u2019t even play the game. They watch someone else stream a fucking game. Okay, whatever. But now these kids are gonna wanna stream for themselves. Why? Because: A. They can\u2019t leave their house because they didn\u2019t get a fucking license; B. They idolize a Twitch streamer and think the epitome of life\u2019s success lies in the ability to tap some buttons faster than someone else and if you can show your friends how fast you tap buttons you\u2019re God.\n\nSo... When I walk into GameStop to build my PC, and I wanna be the next cool streamer, what the fuck am I gonna buy?\n\n- CORSAIR CPU COOLING UNIT\n- CORSAIR GPU COOLING UNIT\n- CORSAIR KEYBOARD\n- CORSAIR MOUSE\n- CORSAIR SPEAKERS \n- CORSAIR STREAMING CHIP \n- CORSAIR HEADPHONES \n- CORSAIR FUCKIN CONDOMS WITH RYAN COHEN\u2019S SMUG LITTLE FACE ON THE GODDAMN TIP!!!!\n\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83e\udd5c\ud83d\ude80\ud83e\udd5c\ud83d\ude80\ud83e\udd5c\ud83d\ude80\ud83e\udd5c\ud83d\ude80\n\nSo why am I loading up on CRSR now? It\u2019s a bargain-bin price, from my perspective. It looks absolutely delicious around $36. 3 bil market cap? Best in class? Dedicated to ensuring quality hardware for customers, and dedicated to the space? \n\nWhen GME opens their PC build stations, I have a strong erection in my pants telling me that Corsair will be there, and PC gaming is about to get a whole lot more popular. \n\nTO THE MOON!\n\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83e\udd5c\ud83d\ude80\ud83e\udd5c\ud83d\ude80\ud83e\udd5c\ud83d\ude80\ud83e\udd5c\ud83d\ude80",

        "selftext": "# The Metric\n\nI recently had an idea for a metric to be used to find hot stocks. I call the metric \"Price Elasticity\" and it is comprised of two numbers: upturn elasticity and downturn elasticity.\n\n* Upturn elasticity: the average % change in a stock on market up days\n* Downturn elasticity: the average % change in a stock on market down days\n\nUsing these numbers and a few additional basic requirements (like positive EPS and at least 31 days of trading history), my screener found 99 stocks out of about 5700 searched that have good to exceptional price elasticities. (the list of these stocks is linked below and also [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NsbQ42oo6i3kYUWf96Tw5yK3LD04L1CR/view?usp=sharing))\n\n# What makes for good price elasticity numbers?\n\nI made two classifications for stocks with good price elasticity data.\n\n1. **Irrational** \\- Upturn elasticity &gt; 1, Downturn elasticity &lt; 0\n2. **Responsible** \\- Upturn elasticity &gt; 1, 0 &lt; Downturn elasticity &lt; 1\n\nWith any stock I want an upturn elasticity &gt; 1, meaning that the stock tends to move higher than the market when the market goes up. The \"Irrational\" classification gets its name because if a stock's downturn elasticity is negative this means the stock, on average, moves up when the market goes down. So a stock that moves higher than the market when the market goes up and also moves up when the market goes down is classified as \"Irrational\". These stocks tend to have less trading history and are very volatile.\n\nThen there are \"Responsible\" stocks which like Irrational stocks move higher than the market when the market goes up. Unlike Irrational stocks though, Responsible stocks move lower when the market moves lower. The reason I still consider them good is because their downturn elasticity is &lt;1 and &gt;0, meaning that, while they do move down with the market, they move down to a lesser degree.\n\nSome popular stocks picked up by the screener include: AMD, ADSK, ETSY, NFLX, NVDA, SHOP and TSLA. Many of the other stocks have lower market caps and could be interesting value / growth plays given they too made the cut.\n\n# Link to the 99 stocks found:\n\n[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NsbQ42oo6i3kYUWf96Tw5yK3LD04L1CR/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NsbQ42oo6i3kYUWf96Tw5yK3LD04L1CR/view?usp=sharing)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have no idea if there is merit to my Price Elasticity metric (or if it has already been \"invented\") but it was a fun project and the screener found some interesting stocks I would have never discovered otherwise. The validity of the metric is entirely based on the assumption that past trends indicate future performance, and for those looking to beat the market the trends of these 99 stocks should be very appealing. I made the screener using Python3 and TD Ameritrade's API. Of the stocks in that list I am currently holding AMD, CAMT, EPAM, and NLOK.",
