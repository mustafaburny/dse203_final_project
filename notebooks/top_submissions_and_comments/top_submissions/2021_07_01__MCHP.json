        "selftext": "I hear a lot of people saying \"*OH GAMING PC's are banned now!\"* (most gamers build PCs, they cant even stop people from building guns, they cant stop them from making gaming pcs. If anything this is going to make supply smaller, increasing price, which isn't a horrible thing from an investor perspective)\n\n*\"Once you have a PC there is no reoccurring revenue for companies like CRSR!\"*\n\nI wanted to make an in depth explanation as to why this line of thought is wrong. And why CRSR (and gaming) is a market that is very misunderstood, and highly profitable.\n\nMYTH: \"You don't need to upgrade your PC for many years.\"\n\nGaming PCs might be great. But:\n\n**Moore's Law** refers to Moore's perception that the number of transistors on a microchip doubles every two years, though the cost of computers is halved. \n\nA few years ago 1080p gaming was good, high end in fact. Today the standard is 1440p. I game in 4k and before you know it, 4k will be a standard. This all requires upgrading of hardware. You might need to future proof some parts of your build, but any real gamer knows you will always be upgrading something. I have been upgrading my PC little by little for 10 years. There's almost never a year I don't buy some sort of PC component.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img cqz9031nx1e71...*\n\nLook at how the efficiency of RAM has improved. Games continue to require more complex tasks and renderings. Not only does the efficiency of computer components increase exponentially, but the style and look does too.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere are some examples:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img pta0yxmxx1e71...*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img 1tmggr2zx1e71...*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img bhxjv0b2y1e71...*\n\nQuite a difference...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img s1h10sk4y1e71...*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[WATER COOLING \\(Looks a lot better...and your PC runs silent\\)](https://preview.redd.it/qzianfv5y1e71.jpg?width=2291&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d13042c77f075e607bd950b9540d84e1ef0c0ec6)\n\nSSD made regular HDs look like a joke. I used to wait a few mins to boot up, now its less than 30 seconds. BUT WAIT...now SSDs plug into PCI-E and are WAYYY faster?!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img kz82f5iey1e71...*\n\n*Processing img one7xb19y1e71...*\n\nCases, Cooling Systems, RAM, Storage...the list goes on. It is all constantly getting more efficient and cooler looking. Games become more and more demanding. Upgrading is going to start happening more and more often.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCRSR is well priced products, they aren't looking for broke people to buy, but you don't have to be rich. Most people who build PCs spend a lot of money on it. That's the customer they are trying to capture. Technology is always growing and these markets need to be served. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEL GATO!\n\nNot only does CRSR have great businesses in PC hardware, but they are getting into streaming and content creators through Youtube and Twitch. Two platforms a lot of people are overlooking. Remember...Amazon owns Twitch. Google owns Youtube. 2 of the biggest companies in the US wouldn't be owning these platforms if content creation wasn't a good market to serve.\n\nI'm long CRSR and believe it is super undervalued. I hope this helps!",

        "selftext": "Neurometrix is a medical technology company focusing on the development and global commercialisation of medical devices for the treatment of chronic pain and neurological disorders. \n\nIt\u2019s key product is Quell 2.0, a Transcutaneous Eletrical Nerve Stimulation device (TENS). Compared to other TENS devices in the market, Quell 2.0 is the most advanced by far, due to being fully automated with motion sensing capabilities, smaller size due to it\u2019a proprietary microchip and is covered by 18+ patents.\n\nThe Quell 2.0 has recently received FDA breakthrough designation thanks to this [study](https://www.dovepress.com/effects-of-wearable-transcutaneous-electrical-nerve-stimulation-on-fib-peer-reviewed-fulltext-article-JPR#), causing the price to shoot up by more than 400%. Rightly so, as this study essentially validates the efficacy and safety of the device and lays the path wide open for FDA authorisation for other uses like fibromyalgia and eventually all forms of neuropathic pain. \n\n- NURO is expecting Quell 2.0 to be commercialized for fibromyalgia in H2 2022. The current fibromyalgia treatment market is estimated to be around US$3 billion and fibromyalgia remains incurable. A 1-2% market by 2023 could generate US$50 million in revenue for NURO.\n\n- NURO is already well known amongst fibromyalgia patients and used OTC. NURO offers 60 day unconditional free return for Quell which shows how confident they are with the product.\n\n- Float is merely 4m shares. Ortex shows cost to borrow at 300% plus, short interest is likely to be astronomical.\n\n- At its current price, TEV is only around US$100 million. For comparison, Senseonics, another medical technology company that\u2019s beginning to commercialize their key product sometime in 2022 is at US$1.3 billion. \n\nFinal thoughts: NURO is a highly innovative company backed by peer-reviewed studies, FDA, patents and street cred. It is an emerging market leader in neuropathic pain treatment, a market growing at 6% CAGR and worth more than US$6 billion at present. Practically debt-free, strong operating margins and a solid monetisation model makes this company a dark horse. More in-depth DD to follow soon.",

        "selftext": " \n\n* **The pace of U.S. vaccinations is ticking upward as the delta variant drives up demand for shots.**\n* **Many of the largest increases in the pace of daily shots are in states with low vaccination rates and worsening outbreaks.**\n* **The number of first vaccine doses, or new people getting their first shots, is up 31% compared to a week ago and rising in\u00a0nearly\u00a0every state.**\n\nThe pace of U.S. vaccinations is rising again as the delta variant drives a new surge in cases across the U.S., especially in states with the lowest vaccination rates and the worst outbreaks.\n\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention data shows nearly 800,000 shots were recorded nationwide on Sunday, the highest single-day total in weeks. The seven-day average of reported vaccinations, including first and second shots, has risen by 16% over the past week to 615,000 shots per day as of Thursday.\n\nThe stark contrast in hospitalizations and deaths between the vaccinated and unvaccinated has become clear in recent weeks and may be convincing people on the fence about getting the shots, according to Jen Kates, a senior vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation. The overwhelming majority of serious Covid cases \u2014 97% of hospital admissions, and 99.5% of Covid deaths \u2014 are occurring among those who are not vaccinated, U.S. health officials say.\n\n\u201cCases are rising, and almost all of those who are hospitalized and dying are unvaccinated,\u201d she said. \u201cThe data are right there, and I think people are realizing that vaccines are our best bet at controlling this.\u201d\n\n## CNBC Health &amp; Science\n\nRead CNBC\u2019s latest global coverage of the Covid pandemic:\n\n[CDC study shows 74% of people infected in Massachusetts Covid outbreak were fully vaccinated](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/30/cdc-study-shows-74percent-of-people-infected-in-massachusetts-covid-outbreak-were-fully-vaccinated.html)\n\n[CDC warns that delta variant is as contagious as chickenpox and may make people sicker than original Covid](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/30/delta-cdc-warns-variant-is-as-contagious-as-chickenpox-may-make-people-sicker.html)\n\n[U.S. Covid vaccination rates rise as Americans in hard-hit states rush to get shots amid delta fears](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/30/us-covid-vaccine-rates-delta-variant.html)\n\n[WHO officials try to figure out why delta is so much dangerous than earlier Covid strains](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/30/who-officials-try-to-figure-out-why-delta-is-so-much-dangerous-than-earlier-covid-strains.html)\n\nThe number of first vaccine doses has climbed more sharply than the overall rate in recent days, representing new people getting their very first shots**.** An average of about 390,000 first doses were administered every day over the past seven days as of Thursday, according to the CDC, up 31% from a week ago.\n\n\u201cThat is the marker you want to see \u2014 the first doses trending up,\u201d said Kates, because it represents new people getting their first shots. That includes people receiving a first shot of either the two-dose Pfizer or Moderna vaccine or one shot of the single-dose Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine.\u00a0\n\nThe pace of daily shots remains far from peak levels, when more than 3 million daily vaccinations, counting both doses, were being reported in mid-April. But the upward trend in first doses is encouraging, public officials say.\n\nForty-eight states and the District of Columbia have reported an increase in average daily first doses compared to the prior week, up from 37 states with increasing rates of first doses a week ago.\n\nStates with the worst outbreaks are seeing the biggest jumps in vaccination rates, a CNBC analysis of CDC and Johns Hopkins University data shows. Across the ten states with the highest levels of average daily new cases per capita, first doses are up 46% week over week, significantly higher than the nationwide increase of 31%. That group includes Louisiana, Arkansas, Florida, Mississippi, Missouri, Alabama, Nevada, Oklahoma, Alaska, and Georgia.\n\n\u201cY\u2019all, we\u2019re going to have a rough few weeks,\u201d\u00a0Mississippi State Health Officer [Dr. Thomas Dobbs told reporters last week](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/27/mississippi-and-louisiana-have-some-of-the-worst-vaccine-rates-and-highest-hospitalizations-in-us.html). The state has fully vaccinated just 34.4% of its population compared with 49.4% of the total U.S. population.\n\n\u201cDelta is hitting us very strongly. We anticipate that we\u2019re going to continue to put additional pressure on the healthcare system,\u201d he said, noting that there were 13 hospitals across the state that had \u201czero ICU beds.\u201d The outbreak there makes a strong case to get the shots. Some 93% of the state\u2019s Covid cases and 89% of the deaths in the past month are among unvaccinated individuals, he said.\n\nThe delta variant is sweeping across the country and leading to a new surge in cases, hospitalizations and deaths, especially in states with poor vaccination records. [It is significantly more contagious](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/30/delta-cdc-warns-variant-is-as-contagious-as-chickenpox-may-make-people-sicker.html) than the original strain. And, unlike the ancestral Covid strain, it\u2019s transmitted as easily by both unvaccinated and fully vaccinated people who have contracted the virus, federal health officials have warned.\n\nMany of the states seeing a dramatic rise in vaccine rates have high levels of community infection and low levels of vaccinations. Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Georgia rank among the ten least-vaccinated states in the country.\n\nState health officials attribute the rising rates to a combination of factors including fears of the more contagious delta variant.\n\n\u201cLast week, we doubled the number of people who initiated the vaccine,\u201d Dr. Joseph Kanter, medical director\u00a0of the Louisiana Department of Health, told reporters in a call hosted by the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials on Thursday. \u201cAnd this week we\u2019re on pace to double that number again. So we\u2019re on pace to quadruple our rate of vaccinations over two weeks.\u201d\n\nIn Alabama, first doses have jumped 62% over the past week to about 7,400 per day. It has the fifth-lowest vaccination rates in the nation among people 12 and older, while its outbreak, which is averaging 35 new cases per day per 100,000 residents, is the sixth worst in the U.S.\n\nAlabama health officer Dr. Karen Landers said concerns over the delta variant, along with education efforts and partnerships with local leaders, were the likely reasons behind heightened interest in the jab.\n\n\u201cWe continue to message the importance of being vaccinated and we know that the increase in variants and certainly the delta variant is more contagious,\u201d she said. \u201cWe feel like we\u2019re seeing an increase in persons understanding that need.\u201d\n\nStill, Landers said, vaccine misinformation makes the progress slow going. Many people don\u2019t understand the regulatory drug approval process and are waiting for the FDA to grant full approval of the vaccines before getting the shots. Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson &amp; Johnson\u2019s vaccines have all been temporarily authorized on an emergency basis and are awaiting final approval.\n\n\u201cWe know that many of our persons in Alabama are still not listening to the info we\u2019re providing in terms of scientific evidence,\u201d she said. \u201cWe must continue to combat misinformation in our state.\u201d\n\nConspiracy theories have also run amok, interfering with vaccine efforts in neighboring Mississippi, local health officials say.\n\n\u201cWe hear it all, from the microchip insertion to the depopulation plan using the vaccine to magnetize people. I mean you name it, we\u2019ve heard it,\u201d Mississippi health department Chief Medical Officer Dr. Dan Edney told reporters last week.\n\nA[ Kaiser Family Foundation analysis](https://www.kff.org/policy-watch/the-red-blue-divide-in-covid-19-vaccination-rates-is-growing/) published in early July shows that the gap in vaccination rates between counties that voted for President Joe Biden and former president Donald Trump has widened throughout the course of the vaccine rollout, with Democrats much more likely to report having been vaccinated than Republicans.\n\nAlabama Gov. Kay Ivey recently joined[ Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis](https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/564249-desantis-urges-public-to-get-vaccinated-these-shots-are-saving-lives) and former White House press secretary and Arkansas gubernatorial candidate[ Sarah Huckabee Sanders](https://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2021/jul/25/the-reasoning-behind-getting-vaccinated/) in a growing chorus of Republican figures encouraging voters to get vaccinated in recent days.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time to start blaming the unvaccinated folks, not the regular folks. It\u2019s the unvaccinated folks that are letting us down,\u201d [she said last week.](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/alabama-governor-says-unvaccinated-are-choosing-horrible-lifestyle-self-inflicted-n1274832)\n\nState health officials in Texas, where the share of the eligible population with a shot is about five percentage points below the U.S. level of 66.9%, say the danger of the delta variant is pushing people to get vaccinated. Average daily case counts in the state are up 72% over the past week, according to Hopkins data.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen an increase in vaccine doses administered over the last couple of weeks,\u201d Texas Department of State Health Services director of media relations Chris van Deusen wrote in an email. \u201cWe\u2019ve been talking a lot about how serious the situation is with the Delta variant as cases and hospitalizations increase, and people seem to be getting the message.\u201d\n\nCalifornia saw a 16% weekly increase in the number of people getting their first vaccine dose, Gov. Gavin Newsom told reporters Monday, including a rise in vulnerable zip codes that have been \u201cmost impacted by this pandemic.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn part because of delta and upticks in numbers of cases and hospitalizations, we\u2019re now seeing increased interest in Covid vaccination in selective areas and states,\u201d said Dr. Arthur Reingold, the division head of epidemiology at the University of California, Berkeley.\n\nPublic officials hope the trend continues to rise governments and businesses up the pressure on employees and customers to get the shots.\n\nThe U.S. [Department of Veteran Affairs](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/26/va-will-require-its-health-care-workers-to-get-covid-vaccine.html) is requiring Covid vaccinations for all health-care personnel who work in Veterans Health Administration facilities to be fully immunized. [Governors in California and New York](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/26/california-is-requiring-proof-of-covid-vaccination-for-state-employees-.html) announced plans in the last week to mandate vaccines for state workers or face stringent health protocols. President Joe Biden l[aid out a similar federal policy Thursday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/29/biden-requiring-federal-workers-to-prove-covid-vaccine-status-or-submit-to-strict-safety-rules-white-house-says.html) and urged governors to offer [$100 payment](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/29/covid-biden-calls-on-states-to-offer-100-cash-payments-for-vaccination.html)s to people who get their first vaccine doses. [Google was one of the first major employers to say it\u2019s mandating](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/28/google-postpones-return-to-work-until-october-will-require-vaccinations.html) vaccines for anyone returning to the office this fall.",

This stabilizes the portfolio through a period that I may want to retain my growth stocks amidst them being a little underwater or lagging i.e. this is the enabler. Portion 2 (11%): \n\nPRU 21%, ALLY 21%, BMO 21%, PNC 21%, AXP 16% \n\n\nA smaller portion of the portfolio is dedicated to low-volatility and drawdown components - save for a few days/events here and there. This allows me to invest as much cash as possible and withdraw it either from that or something else in the portfolio if I suddenly need the money - also if it dips the growth may have dipped more, enabling me to add money to growth stocks. The underperformance of this component is addressed by the growth portion. Portion 3 (9%): \n\nSPY 40%, VYM 17.5%, WMT 12.5%, QYLD 10%, XLRE 10%, NEE 8%\n\nI'm in my low to mid-20s, but I have it so bad with medical issues that there's no way my time horizon is until the age of 50, for I'm not sure how long I can or should live past then when my symptoms will worsen.

To combat this problem, the Senate has approved a $52B subsidy plan to help semiconductor manufacturers in the U.S to help boost fabrication. However, it will take time to build the infrastructure.

Amon has helped spearhead Qualcomm's 5G strategy and global markets. Before working at Qualcomm, Amon was the CTO of V\u00e9sper (wireless operator in Brazil). He also worked for NEC and Velocom. Amon has a good track record. He's been in the industry for a long time while holding multiple leadership roles. Qualcomm might be his biggest leadership role yet. I have no doubt that Cristiano Amon will use his prior knowledge to help guide QCOM into a bright future. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n\tWe've seen tremendous growth across the semiconductor industry over the past two years. The recent chip shortage caused by COVID-19 has been driving QCOM's stock price up. Semiconductor manufactures are having trouble keeping up with consumer demand. It is uncertain when the chip shortage will sort itself out. Some experts have said that it could take several years before supply catches up to demand. A few key takeaways from QCOM's financials are Gross Margin and Price/Book ratio. Gross Margin has remained consistent over the past five years. The average gross margin in the semiconductor industry is 33.76%. QCOM is leading the pack at 60% gross margin. The PB ratio seems a little high to me. QCOM currently has a PB ratio of 21.51. To put that into perspective, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSMC) has a PB ratio of 9.05. While Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) has a PB of 17.05. This tells me that QCOM might be overvalued at its current price. Overall, I'd say the company's financials are pretty average in the industry. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Disclaimer:*\n\n*\\*\\*This is not investment advice\\*\\**\n\n*\\*\\*Do your own research\\*\\**",
