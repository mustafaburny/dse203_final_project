        "selftext": " \n\n \n\n**GFS - The Sisyphean AMD child**\n\n**Who is GFS:**\n\nGlobalFoundries Inc. (GF or GloFo) is a multinational semiconductor contract manufacturing and design company incorporated in the Cayman Islands and headquartered in Malta, New York. Created by the divestiture of the manufacturing arm of Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), the company is privately owned by Mubadala Investment Company, the sovereign wealth fund of the United Arab Emirates.\n\nThe company manufactures chips designed for markets such as mobility, automotive, computing and wired connectivity, consumer internet of things (IoT) and industrial.\n\nAs of 2021, GlobalFoundries is the fourth-largest semiconductor manufacturer; it produces chips for more than 7% of the $86 billion semiconductor manufacturing services industry. It is the only one with operations in Singapore, the European Union, and the United States: one 200 mm and one 300 mm fabrication plant in Singapore; one 300 mm plant in Dresden, Germany; one 200 mm plant in Burlington, Vermont (where it is the largest private employer) and two 300 mm plants in the State of New York: one in East Fishkill and one in Malta.\n\nIn 2019, Thomas Caulfield, the chief executive officer (CEO), said GlobalFoundries plans to become a publicly traded company in 2022. In 2021, the company submitted an initial public offering (IPO) filing to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. \n\n**AMD Spin Off:**\n\n* In 2008, AMD decided to spin off its fabrication division in a move to leverage its competitive advantage in the microprocessing side of the Chip industry. This would give AMD a much needed cash infusion and freedom to solely focus on the side of the business that was actually working, a situation that was necessary for the struggling stock at the time. \n* After the spin off, AMD would own 34% of the manufacturing company with 66% belonging to Advanced Technology Investment Company (ATIC), a subsidiary of the Mubadala Investment Company. \n* AMD would hold the right and plan to taper off the ownership of the company over time.\n* AMD would also be transferring 1.2Billion in debt to the newly formed company. \n* By 2012, AMD was fully divested from Global Foundries.\n\n**Global Foundries:**\n\n* On March 4, 2009 Global Foundries(GFS) was officially announced. \n* GFS primary business is its Foundry business. Understanding the Foundry side of the semiconductor industry is important as it will give an important insight to its position in the market. If we think of chip manufacturing like photography, AMD/Intel/NVidia would be the photographers and GFS would be the print shop. These companies design the chips and GFS manufactures them.\n* GFS has tried to compete in the designing of chips on many occasions and has failed every time. \n* As of 2015, the firm owned ten fabrication plants. fabrication 1 is in Dresden, Germany. Fabs 2 through 7 are in Singapore. Fabs 8 through 10 are in the northeast United States. These sites are supported by a global network of R&amp;D, design enablement, and customer support in Singapore, China, Taiwan, Japan, India, the United States, Germany, and the United Kingdom. In February 2017, the company announced a new 300 fabrication \\[fabrication 11\\] in China for growing semiconductor market in China.\n* In 2016, GlobalFoundries licensed the 14 nm 14LPP FinFET process from Samsung Electronics. In 2018, GlobalFoundries developed the 12 nm 12LP node based on Samsung's 14 nm 14LPP process.\n* On August 27, 2018, GlobalFoundries announced it had cancelled their 7nm process due to a strategy shift to focus on specialized processes instead of leading edge performance.\n* On January 29, 2019, AMD announced an amended wafer supply agreement with GlobalFoundries. AMD now has full flexibility for wafer purchases from any foundry at 7 nm or beyond. AMD and GlobalFoundries agreed to commitments and pricing at 12 nm for 2019 through 2021.\n* On May 20, 2019, Marvell Technology Group announced it would acquire Avera Semi from GlobalFoundries for $650 million and potentially an additional $90 million. Avera Semi was GlobalFoundries' ASIC Solutions division, which had been a part of IBM's semiconductor manufacturing business. On February 1, 2019, GlobalFoundries announced the $236 million sale of its fabrication 3E in Tampines, Singapore, to Vanguard International Semiconductor (VIS) as part of their plan to exit the MEMS business by December 31, 2019. on April 22, 2019, GlobalFoundries announced the $430 million sale of their fabrication 10 in East Fishkill, New York, to ON Semiconductor. \n* In May 2020, GlobalFoundries stated it was fully abandoning its plans of opening fabrication 11 in Chengdu, China due to reported rivalry between the latter and the US.\\[30\\] This was three years after the manufacturer announced it would invest $10 billion to open the new fab; the fabrication was never brought online.\\[31\\]\n\n**Bear Case:**\n\n* GFS IPO is an exit strategy for the majority shareholder ATIC, which has proved to be a Sysphean for the fund. (https://semianalysis.com/globalfoundries-gfs-ipo-mubadala-lost-over-22-4b-now-they-are-hoping-public-markets-bail-them-out/)\n* GFS has wasted billions on failed ventures(fabrication 11, 7nm) while its competitors have had no issues in their ventures in the same field. \n* AMD is and was their largest customer, but they have been rapidly declining.\n* TSM, MU and NXP all are taking a large stake in the fabrication industry.\n* The timing of the IPO is to capitalize on inflated market, inflated semi conductor reliance, and looming self-confidence in GFS.   \n* Gross profit of the last three years have been a net loss, and has increased negatively by 58% (https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001709048/000119312521290644/d192411df1.htm)\n\n**Subjective Bear Case:**\n\n* A bit of context, I worked as an intern at GFS at their HQ. \n* They had 3 MULTI million $ accidents while I was there. One caused by a hardware technician accidentally pressing an emergency stop button during an etching process. When these processes are stopped for ANY reason, the wafers being processed are as good as garbage. Semiconductor manufacturing is incredibly expensive, time consuming, and if a wafer is not PERFECT on a nano scale, the wafer is rendered useless. \n* The building was beautiful, this might sound like a pro but let me explain why it is a con. GFS has never been in a financial situation where they are able to spend the amount of money that they spent on their office. There were at least 60-80 meeting rooms JUST for engineers and in every single room there were 82inch flat screen HD monitors. There were \u201cto go\u201d chrome books on every corner where if you needed an extra laptop for any reason, you could just grab it. Everyone, even the janitors, were given company laptops, phones, backpacks, etc that were updated every year. \n* Because of the international importance of semiconductors and limited pool of talent, diversity among engineers is an understatement. The amount of engineers I would be in contact with on a daily basis that didn\u2019t speak english/spoke really broken english was quite literally counterproductive. There were times I had to have people from my team come with me to someone else\u2019s desk so they could translate for me.\n* They had a soccer field in the back of the site where they would PAY the employees to partake in - again, definitely a pro but a con in regards to finances. \n* All of this spending while being in a financially rough spot screams to me money hemorrhaging at the management level. \n\n**Bull Case:**\n\n* The IPO will give GFS a needed cash infusion to leverage itself as a top contender in the fabrication industry.\n* Deepening relationships(straight from SEC prospectus) could mean long term contracts with their clients which would mean more stable revenue for the following years. \n* Inflated market, semiconductor prices, and needs of chips means higher revenue and profits for GFS. Due to an increase in need also means customers will be much more willing to work with GFS if they can compete with TSM, MU etc or their competitors don\u2019t have the bandwidth to meet customer demand. \n* Loss from operations has decreased over the last three years(delta of 34%) and compared to last year is a fraction of what it was. \n* Loss per share is almost 14% of what it was compared to 2018(-4.7 vs -.6) \n\n**Conclusion and Summary:**\n\nI wish I could\u2019ve had a more quantitative approach to this post but almost all of the data can be seen at the SEC filing so I will let you guys do the calculations you want to know. I also believe that the qualitative information surrounding GFS is far more interesting than the numbers currently. These are incredibly dynamic times for the semiconductor industry, so the numbers used in the SEC filing are not fully representative of the future of the company. I am interested to see what happens AFTER IPO. Overall, I am net bearish on GFS but I do hold a part of me that believes they could leverage this cash infusion in their benefit. The semiconductor industry will/has seen a massive explosion that will keep exploding for some time.",

This would give AMD a much needed cash infusion and freedom to solely focus on the side of the business that was actually working, a situation that was necessary for the struggling stock at the time. \n* After the spin off, AMD would own 34% of the manufacturing company with 66% belonging to Advanced Technology Investment Company (ATIC), a subsidiary of the Mubadala Investment Company. \n* AMD would hold the right and plan to taper off the ownership of the company over time.\n* AMD would also be transferring 1.2Billion in debt to the newly formed company. \n* By 2012, AMD was fully divested from Global Foundries.\n\n**Global Foundries:**\n\n* On March 4, 2009 Global Foundries(GFS) was officially announced. \n* GFS primary business is its Foundry business. Understanding the Foundry side of the semiconductor industry is important as it will give an important insight to its position in the market. If we think of chip manufacturing like photography, AMD/Intel/NVidia would be the photographers and GFS would be the print shop. These companies design the chips and GFS manufactures them.\n* GFS has tried to compete in the designing of chips on many occasions and has failed every time. \n* As of 2015, the firm owned ten fabrication plants. Fab 1 is in Dresden, Germany. Fabs 2 through 7 are in Singapore. Fabs 8 through 10 are in the northeast United States. These sites are supported by a global network of R&amp;D, design enablement, and customer support in Singapore, China, Taiwan, Japan, India, the United States, Germany, and the United Kingdom. In February 2017, the company announced a new 300 Fab \\[Fab 11\\] in China for growing semiconductor market in China.\n* In 2016, GlobalFoundries licensed the 14 nm 14LPP FinFET process from Samsung Electronics. In 2018, GlobalFoundries developed the 12 nm 12LP node based on Samsung's 14 nm 14LPP process.\n* On August 27, 2018, GlobalFoundries announced it had cancelled their 7nm process due to a strategy shift to focus on specialized processes instead of leading edge performance.\n* On January 29, 2019, AMD announced an amended wafer supply agreement with GlobalFoundries. AMD now has full flexibility for wafer purchases from any foundry at 7 nm or beyond. AMD and GlobalFoundries agreed to commitments and pricing at 12 nm for 2019 through 2021.\n* On May 20, 2019, Marvell Technology Group announced it would acquire Avera Semi from GlobalFoundries for $650 million and potentially an additional $90 million. Avera Semi was GlobalFoundries' ASIC Solutions division, which had been a part of IBM's semiconductor manufacturing business. On February 1, 2019, GlobalFoundries announced the $236 million sale of its Fab 3E in Tampines, Singapore, to Vanguard International Semiconductor (VIS) as part of their plan to exit the MEMS business by December 31, 2019. on April 22, 2019, GlobalFoundries announced the $430 million sale of their Fab 10 in East Fishkill, New York, to ON Semiconductor. \n* In May 2020, GlobalFoundries stated it was fully abandoning its plans of opening Fab 11 in Chengdu, China due to reported rivalry between the latter and the US.\\[30\\] This was three years after the manufacturer announced it would invest $10 billion to open the new fab; the fab was never brought online.\\[31\\]\n\n**Bear Case:**\n\n* GFS IPO is an exit strategy for the majority shareholder ATIC, which has proved to be a Sisyphean for the fund. ([analysis](https://semianalysis.com/globalfoundries-gfs-ipo-mubadala-lost-over-22-4b-now-they-are-hoping-public-markets-bail-them-out/))\n* GFS has wasted billions on failed ventures(Fab 11, 7nm) while its competitors have had no issues in their ventures in the same field. \n* AMD is and was their largest customer, but they have been rapidly declining.\n* TSM, MU and NXP all are taking a large stake in the fab industry.\n* The timing of the IPO is to capitalize on inflated market, inflated semi conductor reliance, and looming self-confidence in GFS.   \n* Gross profit of the last three years have been a net loss, and has increased negatively by 58% ([sec filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001709048/000119312521290644/d192411df1.htm)) \n\n**Subjective Bear Case:**\n\n* A bit of context, I worked as an intern at GFS at their HQ. \n* They had 3 MULTI million $ accidents while I was there. One caused by a hardware technician accidentally pressing an emergency stop button during an etching process. When these processes are stopped for ANY reason, the wafers being processed are as good as garbage. Semiconductor manufacturing is incredibly expensive, time consuming, and if a wafer is not PERFECT on a nano scale, the wafer is rendered useless. \n* The building was beautiful, this might sound like a pro but let me explain why it is a con. GFS has never been in a financial situation where they are able to spend the amount of money that they spent on their office. There were at least 60-80 meeting rooms JUST for engineers and in every single room there were 82inch flat screen HD monitors. There were \u201cto go\u201d chrome books on every corner where if you needed an extra laptop for any reason, you could just grab it. Everyone, even the janitors, were given company laptops, phones, backpacks, etc that were updated every year. \n* Because of the international importance of semiconductors and limited pool of talent, diversity among engineers is an understatement. The amount of engineers I would be in contact with on a daily basis that didn\u2019t speak english/spoke really broken english was quite literally counterproductive. There were times I had to have people from my team come with me to someone else\u2019s desk so they could translate for me.\n* They had a soccer field in the back of the site where they would PAY the employees to partake in - again, definitely a pro but a con in regards to finances. \n* All of this spending while being in a financially rough spot screams to me money hemorrhaging at the management level. \n\n**Bull Case:**\n\n* The IPO will give GFS a needed cash infusion to leverage itself as a top contender in the fab industry.\n* Deepening relationships(straight from SEC prospectus) could mean long term contracts with their clients which would mean more stable revenue for the following years. \n* Inflated market, semiconductor prices, and needs of chips means higher revenue and profits for GFS. Due to an increase in need also means customers will be much more willing to work with GFS if they can compete with TSM, MU etc or their competitors don\u2019t have the bandwidth to meet customer demand. \n* Loss from operations has decreased over the last three years(delta of 34%) and compared to last year is a fraction of what it was. \n* Loss per share is almost 14% of what it was compared to 2018(-4.7 vs -.6) \n\n**Conclusion and Summary:**\n\nI wish I could\u2019ve had a more quantitative approach to this post but almost all of the data can be seen at the SEC filing so I will let you guys do the calculations you want to know. I also believe that the qualitative information surrounding GFS is far more interesting than the numbers currently. These are incredibly dynamic times for the semiconductor industry, so the numbers used in the SEC filing are not fully representative of the future of the company. I am interested to see what happens AFTER IPO. Overall, I am net bearish on GFS but I do hold a part of me that believes they could leverage this cash infusion in their benefit. The semiconductor industry will/has seen a massive explosion that will keep exploding for some time.",

        "selftext": "So many ppl lost money in all the tickers, cause we retails are divided by the hedgies, look what happen with GME and AMC.  We won because we are focus. I have cashed out all my earnings to all in on PSFE because the exact same scenario is happening. I all in in GME at 30 and it rose to 300. I've put my capital in AMC at 3 and it rose to 70. PSFE is the next GME, igaming revenue up 70%, transactional volume up 41%, no pipe is selling but stocks tank to 7 from 19.\n\nRecently I bought in affirm at 60, when it got shorted down from 100, good news happened and it rose 100%. We all want the next AMC and I am quite certain PSFE is the next. It monopolize Canada's igaming market by having a 100% share and 75% share in the US. All of the big betting players are a client of PSFE.\n\nNone of the pipe has sold here, bill foley with 30m shares, dan loeb with 41m shares. Blackrock just bought in at 8.3m shares at $12. This will explode soon.

        "selftext": "Paysafe (PSFE)\n\nHave you Apes been missing the news lately on a stock that is one of us?  Why? Paysafe is a leading supporter of online gaming and the deals recently announced are not priced into the stock.  If anyone should be supporting gambling it is us?\n\nIt\u2019s has a high potential of being bought\u2026\n\n\u201cThe Bottom Line\n\nSomeone is going to buy this company.\n\nProcessors are looking for growth and innovation. They\u2019re all focused on Square (NASDAQ:SQ), which has only grown more popular as it has gone into various banking and investment niches.\n\nGambling doesn\u2019t scare the payments industry. Casino contracts are highly prized. Processors don\u2019t hand gamblers money they don\u2019t have. When the gambler is out of money, they reject the transaction. Many casinos have special rules for gambler transactions aimed at keeping them, and the gamblers, out of trouble.\n\nThis means the downside risk of PaySafe stock is limited. There remain potential suitors for the company. The most likely is Fidelity National, which has a market cap of nearly $75 billion. But if Foley sees a better bid, he will certainly take it.\n\nThe debt means PaySafe\u2019s enterprise value is fair, not low. But you can buy it here.\u201d\n\nIt now has deals with Fubo, Montana Lottery Sportsbook, and many more on the way\u2026\n6 days ago:\n\n\u201cFuboTV Inc (NYSE: FUBO) is trading higher Thursday after the company's subsidiary, Fubo Gaming, announced a partnership with Paysafe (NYSE: PSFE).\nFubo Sportsbook will plug into Paysafe for credit and debit card payments. It is expected to launch in the fourth quarter.\u201d\n\n2 Days Ago:\n\n\u201cHOUSTON, October 04, 2021--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Paysafe (NYSE: PSFE), a leading specialized payments platform, today announced a new partnership with INTRALOT, a leading global gaming solutions supplier. INTRALOT\u2019s sports-betting platform has integrated with Paysafe to enable the Montana government-operated lottery to provide its online sportsbook patrons with a comprehensive suite of traditional and alternative payment methods via a single API.\u201d\n\nThe third and fourth quarter earnings are going to beat.  There are no supply chain issues with this company and gambling is through the roof.  I don\u2019t YOLO but I\u2019m considering it with this stock.  At only $7 and $5 Billion Market Cap this is one of the best deals.  \n\nMore institutional ownership then ever:\n\n\n\u201cThe number of bullish hedge fund positions improved by 9 lately. Paysafe Limited (NYSE:PSFE) was in 50 hedge funds' portfolios at the end of June. The all time high for this statistic was previously 41. This means the bullish number of hedge fund positions in this stock currently sits at its all time high. Our calculations also showed that PSFE isn't among the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds (click for Q2 rankings).\u201d\n\nGet on the rocket at this price\u2026its not going to zero so very limited risk at this level.  Revenue increasing every quarter\u2026.just look at the charts.  I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if they announce getting into BNPL as well since that is the hot industry.\n\nPositions:\n\n3000 Shares\n11/19/21 8C",

        "selftext": "Gentlemen, I hope you have been making the most of the opportunity my dear friend, Moscow Mitch has provided you. ie I **HOPE YOU BOUGHT THE DIP F%\\*%\\*#\\*@**\n\nWhile I still have your attention, I would like to introduce you to a company that me and some fellows have been bag holding (in the red) for a while.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3jmjge40a5s71.png?width=1379&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cc941bbcf643c78cefe803ee9ce4174b8f8e5889\n\n**Payoneer, the Paypal for** **~~Shithole~~** **Developing Countries**\n\n**Payoneer** is Paypal for B2B global commerce, particularly outside North American and Europe. The company provides B2B services for millions of SMB and enterprises around the world\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qn847nz0a5s71.png?width=1759&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d05be8973c4bfefe00396c250fb92fe123c5f0ae\n\nThe ideal customer is a small but growing SMB doing business all over the world which needs currency, compliance and business services. Payoneer is an obvious candidate to handles these needs given its global network.\n\n\u00b7 Payoneer offers vendors the ability to move money with a U.S. bank account and pay suppliers, without having to deal with too many banking hurdles or red tape.\n\n\u00b7 A lot of freelancers on Upwork.com use Payoneer because many of them live in countries that Upwork.com can't wire money to.\n\n\u00b7 Once vendors receive funds into their Payoneer account they can either withdraw the cash using their Payoneer provided Master Card or do a direct bank transfer from Payoneer to their local bank. Usually funds arrive within 1-2 business days.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cjzym5w1a5s71.png?width=1764&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e77f88b654fe44aca54902b8a4f1d18bb7c519b9\n\nSo, it is basically a bank that includes an accountant to help meet a business\u2019 needs. The one product or feature that is missing is digital coins.\n\nSay a consumer wants to rent an airbnb. They use a credit card (or other payment method) to pay airbnb, a payment gateway facilitates payment acceptance. The payment is then processed and Airbnb ends up with the money from the transaction. Airbnb has now gathered cash through its acquirers (e.g., Adyen, ACI). Airbnb now needs to distribute funds to its SMB sellers. Airbnb uses payoneer to disburse funds to sellers. From this example, you can see Payoneer isn't competing with companies like Adyen or other acquirers/ processors, even though they are processing payments.\n\nPayoneer signs up individual sellers, which allows the sellers to use payoneer across platforms (e.g., facebook marketplace and amazon). Hyperwallet (owned by PayPal) is one of their competitors, but Hyperwallet operates completely differently, they sign up users via the platform, but this means you can't use hyperwallet for your business on both amazon and fb marketplace without going through the onboarding process again. Given the trend towards SMB sellers operating across multiple marketplaces, this is a huge benefit for payoneer, and makes PayPal's offering a lot less competitive. It also means Payoneer owns the seller relationship in a way that PayPal doesn't do as effectively, and makes it easier for them to package other offerings (e.g., working capital). These other offerings provide a two-fold benefit - their customer relationships become stronger, so revenue is seen as more recurring and investors will pay a higher multiple; and they'll make more money per customer.\n\nMy view is that Payoneer should see an S-type growth curve, where they'll hit a critical mass of users and see exponential growth, like cashapp, or venmo. Their investor presentation projects 25% revenue growth over the next couple years, I think this is super conservative, especially considering that 25% growth rate doesn't account for the two travel related marketplaces that got screwed by covid. Once they hit that critical mass of users, they'll pop off, sales &amp; marketing expenses will drop, and they'll become profitable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5xuonwi2a5s71.png?width=1556&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b57e5a829bbcb5d58f51cbdc2e426ceca0ccd2a3\n\nThe company\u2019s focus on investing for future services is actually what gets me most excited as it may ward off near-term investor interest and improves its competitive position. It\u2019s also a sign of a mature management team. The opportunity to provide additional services such as working capital, compliance and tax services seems like an obvious strategic move to drive growth. Specifically, working capital is far and away the most important service and something SMBs are desperate for.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zi2sl613a5s71.png?width=1664&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e959a0115d4cbb201b531f77ae5276a31026a7d1\n\nWho are their customers and where are they know? 5 million businesses in 190 countries. Customers include Amazon, Wish, Lazada (owned by Alibaba) Shopee, and Ebay. Weird right, they work with Ebay given Paypal does too. This is because they work with countries and specific clients that Paypal not accept into their platform. Investors need to understand that sometimes people have to use other platforms because they the Paypal\u2019s or banks are NOT willing to take the risk. Sure the risk is probably higher but the amount of people that need access to capital or payment process is high when many banks in many countries do not approve people for such type of access.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r1kinxk3a5s71.png?width=1631&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=74cd5a7bdb3d3934ce730e1dd9aa9204ff72b259\n\n# Payoneer vs PayPal\n\nThe growth of Payoneer\u2019s global network included a move into India in April 2016, following a partnership with Pune-based IndusInd Bank and expressions of interest in its services from more than 10,000 freelancers and small businesses across the country. \n\n2018 PayPal study suggest that India\u2019s freelancers represent around one quarter of the world\u2019s gig workforce.\n\n**In August 2019, Payoneer announced a year-on-year increase of 400% in its customer base and a threefold increase in payment volumes processed in India.**\n\n*\u201cPayPal says to shut domestic payments business in India\u201d \\~ Reuters*\n\nNEW DELHI (Reuters) - PayPal Holdings Inc will wind down its domestic payments business in India from April 1,2021 the company said in a statement on Friday.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gcipi9b4a5s71.png?width=1743&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c3b20d766db9f0b8302c16582755758489bc479e\n\nB2B global marketplace. The attractiveness of FinTech can be summarized in a few words, namely, \u201cscale\u201d and \u201cnetwork effects\u201d. From the metrics Payoneer shared, it looks like they\u2019re benefitting from these dynamics. Analysts estimate the global B2B market at tens of trillions $ and cross-border payments at $300bn. Obviously the pandemic only accelerated these trends. (From the presentation, it looks like company B2B AR/AP volume more than doubled at 140% in 2020 although the CFO later cited a 53% increase in volumes so not sure exactly how to interpret that.)\n\nVolume and customer growth drives revenues. Volumes grew over 53% in 2020 (67% adjusted for the pandemic) and are expected to grow at 44% and 33% in 2021 and 2022, respectively, which translates into 25% annual revenue growth per year for the next two years.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ghmjbjt4a5s71.png?width=1721&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4c9dcfa310f5e6a4bc90b66fbf9fc8b018377aa7\n\nThe benefits of network effects cannot be overstated as Paypal has proven. As a company acquires more customers, the value of its network increases. Payoneer\u2019s business model leverages this same dynamic. Moreover, its network would be very difficult to replicate. The company\u2019s global platform includes over 80 banks and clearing partners in over 100 countries. The company also provides customers data about its transactions, which I believe will be increasingly useful and sticky.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/z9x3x8b5a5s71.png?width=1797&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=caa49b84156468b94a9f50b9a23ffb208340eba3\n\nWhat do I think the future holds for Payoneer? I actually think there are several exits for this company.\n\n**Growth:**\n\nNote that Payoneer currently doesn\u2019t do B2C, hence it may be quite common for retail to never even have heard of it, unless they are a business or in the gig economy. That is one of the problems for the stock, no one has heard of it (yet) because it works quietly behind the scenes. Given enough funding, who knows, Payoneer may well expand to B2C. Alibaba initially started as B2B as well but has since expanded to B2C (Taobao).\n\nWe just need Payoneer to be 5% of PayPal (ie. $15B market cap) in order for stock price to be in the $30-$40 range. ($6B market cap corresponds to around $13-$15 stock price.) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/95silwp5a5s71.png?width=1748&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f10a138995c52367baa00ed4a10e9287c5da04ee\n\n**Acquisition:**  \n Large international payments processer buys them. Could be Paypal, Square, Stripe, First Data, etc. consolidation WILL happen in this space and I think short-term Payoneer will acquire some companies and then be sold to a bigger company. Think of this as how banks in the USA were allowed to merge in 1995 given the law that passed. Before you had 100,000 banks then it was 50,000 banks, then 10,000 banks and now like 5,000 banks but the top 10 banks make up a large % of the business/volume.\n\nWildcard: CRM business buys them. What many people do not realize is that CRM\u2019s have been changing the game. First it was to help you sell with marketing tools, then it is to improve communication within the team, then it will be storage, and legal transactions then it will be financial transaction. They are literally going to control the beginning to the end of the customer relationship and all of that data they possess is very valuable to help their customers grow.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is not financial advice, i am not a financial advisor. I have a long position with the warrants that i purchased in February and are therefore in the red.",

The BNPL market as a whole is very expensive (coming from a small investor's POV). Square\u2019s P/B ratio is currently at 40, which indicates that the company might be overvalued. On top of that, Squares Total liabilities, D/E ratio, and Long Term Debt have all seen a sharp increase. Square is aggressively trying to expand by financing its debt. This alone makes me hesitant to invest. I am concerned with Square\u2019s ties to bitcoin. I labeled this as both a bullish and bearish case. Square invested a good chunk of money in bitcoin. That means their reliant on bitcoins performance. If bitcoin goes up, they go up. If bitcoin goes down, they do down. There is a lot of news and government intervention surrounding bitcoin which can either be positive or negative. I do believe the BNPL industry is a growing market, but with more competition entering the market, it will be hard for Square to capture market share. \n\n*\\*\\*This is not investment advice.

The BNPL market as a whole is very expensive (coming from a small investor's POV). Square\u2019s P/B ratio is currently at 40, which indicates that the company might be overvalued. On top of that, Squares Total liabilities, D/E ratio, and Long Term Debt have all seen a sharp increase. Square is aggressively trying to expand by financing its debt. This alone makes me hesitant to invest. I am concerned with Square\u2019s ties to bitcoin. I labeled this as both a bullish and bearish case. Square invested a good chunk of money in bitcoin. That means their reliant on bitcoins performance. If bitcoin goes up, they go up. If bitcoin goes down, they do down. There is a lot of news and government intervention surrounding bitcoin which can either be positive or negative. I do believe the BNPL industry is a growing market, but with more competition entering the market, it will be hard for Square to capture market share. \n\n*\\*\\*This is not investment advice.

The 1.5YO SPY/SPYG picks were because we forgot to let her roll the dice lol.\n\nMy girlfriend has a 7 year old boy and we have a 1.5YO daughter. I put together a list of stocks to pick from (like 200-300 to pick from, ETFs and 10+ of each major market sector). We let them pick or play games to pick. The 1.5YO rolls dice most the time lol. We put in $10 every week to whatever they pick. 25% must be in ETFs for some stability. \n\nThey'll have access to the money once they're 18, accounts are still in our names just in case, and we don't expect to cash out enough to increase the capital gains taxes. We'll still likely be the gatekeepers for the money so they don't just blow it on hookers; more for a car, college, travel, etc.",

With the major indices hovering near relevant SMA's, the next few days will be important for the market. Will we see a bounce off these support levels once again, or will we break down? Things are looking bearish to me from a TA standpoint, but we'll see how things look closer to market open. I'll also be watching the mega caps closely, as if they show weakness, the whole market could follow. Growth slowdown remains a concern, as we saw Goldman Sachs cut their U.S. GDP growth forecast for both 2021 and next year. With growth slowdown concerns and supply chain issues, we could be in for quite a ride this (and next) earnings season.\u00a0\n\nSPY is trading a bit over 436, and could test the SMA(100) at \\~434.81 as support in today's trading. SMA(9) is also relevant at 433.86. If we easily break down through those levels, we could see more red. Regardless, we should see more volatility today. If SPY sees strength, I'll be watching the resistance level around 438. DIA is trading a bit over 347 and could test the SMA(100) as resistance around that level. I'll also be watching price action around the 346 support level. QQQ\u00a0is trading a bit under 359 and looking bearish this morning. Currently gapping down below the SMA(100) and the SMA(9), it will likely test that 359 level as resistance. If it can't get back up, we could see red over the next few days. Gold and silver are each slightly down this morning, while crude oil is up over 3% and looks to continue its recent strength. Bitcoin is currently trading around 56,400, and we could see more consolidation up at this resistance level. Crypto-related stocks are up in premarket trading, trading in sympathy with Bitcoin. Airlines and cruise stocks are down a bit in premarket. It will be interesting if they hold up over support levels and maintain the new uptrend, or if we see more selling off. Meme stocks have been quiet recently, but it's always worth keeping an eye on them.\u00a0\n\nRemember to use proper risk management, by making sure you size appropriately for your account and have a plan for every trade you enter (both for taking profits and cutting losses).

NKLA being a good example.\nPersonally I feel like it should be upward movement considering they are producing vehicles, deliveries taking place and there are good amount of preorders. \nIt's the loss percentage that concerns me. \nReal company, real vehicles, going throw growing pains. \nCompared that to TSLA, which went through the same and it took years for them to be profitable. \nWhat does everyone think?

        "selftext": "**Dear Smart and Thoughtful Apes,**\n\nViacomCBS is a Entertainment Media Giant that owns CBS, Nickelodeon (Avatar The Last Airbender &amp; Paw Patrol), MTV (South Park), Comedy Central (Key&amp;Peele, Beavis and Butt-Head), BET, Smithsonian Channel and Paramount Pictures film studios. $VIAC has a flagship streaming services named Paramount+ and Showtime that are experiencing skyrocket subscriber growth: started the year 2021 with 30 million subs globally and by end of Q2 2021 has 42M total subs, representing 40% subscriber growth!!!!\n\n**$VIAC trades at P/E multiple of 7 with revenue of $28 billion**, while $NFLX has 62 P/E multiple and revenue of 27$ billion. Paramount+ subscription is 4.99$ and 9.99$, and is now bundled with Showtime content for just $9.99 or 12.99$, which is significantly cheaper than $NFLX $8.99, $13.99 and $17.99. Paramount+ is currently available in 25 countries including Australia and New Zealand which launched in August 2021, and will be in 45 countries including Europe by beginning of 2022, so expect at least 100 million more subs subscribing by next year as soon as it becomes available. My projection being 150-180 million subs by end of 2022. Also, in July 2021, Paramount+ and Showtime combined accounted for 22% of all sign-ups in the US, while NFLX only 5%.

        "selftext": "# Intro\n\nGiven all the recent PLTR FUD and corresponding whipsawing with the stock price, I thought I would write an inaugural DD to reaffirm my long-term conviction and share my bull-case perspective and meandering thoughts on $PLTR.\n\n**Disclaimer:** This is my first attempt at writing a DD, so constructive feedback and stimulating debate is most welcome! This does not constitute financial advice and simply reflects my opinions as a retail investor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/gpytbs8qegs71.gif\n\n# Positions\n\n* 3,000 shares, $23.94 cost basis\n* First bought in November 2020 (tragically missed the DPO price)\n* Consistent and multiple DCA (\u201cdollar cost averaging\u201d) \u2013 I had several buys in the $30 range (ouch) but continually averaged down\n\n# The Bull Case\n\n**\"Digital Gold\" in the 21st century**\n\nAnalogous to how oil was hailed as \"black gold\", data will become the \"digital gold\" that permeates every industry in the future; the COVID-19 catastrophe has only reinforced this epochal transformation. The ability to strategically leverage and emancipate siloed and large datasets for competitive insights has, in my opinion, nearly limitless potential and use-cases:\n\n* Consider the industries already deploying Foundry in an array of use cases: from optimizing supply chains, informing military operations in high-stakes environments where minimizing risk/error is paramount, or achieving medical breakthroughs by unlocking data insights from previously opaque datasets, and more. Companies that refuse to adapt will be left behind.\n\n[Here](https://www.statista.com/statistics/871513/worldwide-data-created/) are some figures to demonstrate the rapid, exponential increase with data trends from 2010 to 2025, representing a macro tailwind for data analytics providers like Palantir. 2025 projections for global data generation are estimated to reach **180 zettabytes** (64.2 zettabytes were generated in 2020, representing a nearly 3x increase). Simply put, the world will only become more complex with data generation and Palantir is uniquely positioned to handle challenges of the digital era.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**PLTR's Moat**\n\nTo this day, I still haven't encountered a coherent articulation of a direct competitor with software that matches Palantir's Gotham and Foundry capabilities (please correct me if I am wrong!). It seems one would need to combine multiple software platforms from different companies to be remotely comparable, as seen in the C3 AI and Snowflake [partnership](https://c3.ai/c3-ai-and-snowflake-partner-to-deliver-next-generation-enterprise-ai-applications-at-scale/). To that end, I argue that Palantir\u2019s software assumes the position of technological supremacy (more on this will be covered in the \u201cCathie Wood\u201d effect section).\n\nMoreover, the argument that enterprise customers could simply build \"in-house\" solutions falls flat \u2013 these endeavors are typically blackholes for cost and time, with sub-optimal results ([source](https://blog.palantir.com/how-palantir-foundry-helps-customers-build-and-deploy-ai-powered-decision-making-applications-dbfb5161279b)):\n\n&gt;*\u201cIn fact, Gartner still predicts that* ***85% of traditional AI and ML projects developed within organizations will deliver erroneous outcomes***\\*. Even after a model is successfully developed, it often remains an experiment rather than an operational tool that generates consistent, long-term business value\u201d (emphasis added).\\*\n\nContemplate the case of Airbus and the creation of Skywise:\n\n1. In this [interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgTkOKEUyKU) with Alex Karp, Pierre Smolinksy (Former Airbus Executive) and former Digital Transformation Officer of Airbus, Marc Fontaine, Marc revisits how Airbus was initially skeptical of Palantir's software, sharing how most SMEs (\"subject matter experts\") thought integration of such vastly siloed data was impossible. In fact, they spent *decades* attempting to solve that problem with hundreds of data centers.\n\nWhen prompted by Karp about the partnership [results](https://youtu.be/qgTkOKEUyKU?t=503), Marc recounts improvements of double digits in industrial processes, stating that once conditions were ready, TATs (\"turnaround times\") were shaved down to a single week from 16 months (**6852.39%** efficiency gains as there are 69.5239 weeks in 16 months). I literally rewatched that segment multiple times because Marc mentions that ridiculous paradigm shift so casually before moving on.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Q2 2021 Earnings**\n\nThe ER (\u201cearnings report\u201d) numbers were resoundingly fantastic and I have included a few highlights below.\n\n1. Total revenue grew **+49% YoY to $376M**\n2. Government revenue grew **+66% YoY to $232M**\n3. Commercial revenue accelerated **+90% YoY to $144M**\n4. Remaining deal value grew **+63% YoY to $3.4B**\n5. Adjusted FCF guidance FY21 widened to **+$300M**, up from in excess of **$150M**.\n6. PLTR is debt-free!\n\nAnnual revenue growth is guided at 30% *or greater* for '21 through '25, which I believe is intentionally sandbagged by Leadership to under-promise and over-deliver. When accounting for the newly announced Army [contract](https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2021/10/07/palantir-stock-gains-10-on-us-army-contract-but-theres-still-more-upside/?sh=6399826e3876) (**$823M**) and Veteran Affairs [contract](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-07/palantir-wins-90-million-contract-with-u-s-veterans-affairs) (**$90M**), those two deals alone are worth nearly **$900M over a couple of years**.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Growth Investments and Capital Deployment**\n\nPLTR is actively deploying its capital and strategically seeking out early-stage companies to invest in (very helpful [breakdown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r3fEl6_e_c), courtesy of Ticket Symbol: YOU). I consider this advantageous for several reasons:\n\n1. This is a strategic and public demonstration of PLTR's software in multiple industries and verticals, effectively making the argument that the software is industry-agnostic: if your industry needs to analyze vast amounts of siloed data, then PLTR offers a ready-made solution.\n2. By embedding PLTR's technology early on and showing its value and compatibility, these companies will be inclined to continually use its software (as we know, PLTR partnerships are very sticky). This is also relevant with the **Foundry for Builders** initiative, almost a direct counterargument to bears who contend that PLTR is unscalable and only attractive to large enterprise clients.\n3. As Palantir scales its offerings and as other enterprises understand the profound capabilities of Palantir's software, I believe that commercial adoption will continue to grow at an increasing pace.\n4. **UPDATE:** Palantir recently announced its second [cohort](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20211006005995/en/Palantir-Introduces-Second-Cohort-of-Foundry-for-Builders-Start-Ups) of Foundry for Builders on October 6, 2021, again reinforcing how versatile the deployment of its SaaS platform can be.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Privacy as a Foundational Pillar**\n\nI think most investors under-appreciate or overlook Palantir's ironclad approach to privacy with its software.\n\nPLTR was \"... was founded on the conviction that it's essential to preserve fundamental principles of privacy and civil liberties while using data\" ([source](https://www.palantir.com/pcl/)). They delineate the privacy [principles](https://www.palantir.com/pcl/principles/) and privacy-by-design [tech](https://www.palantir.com/pcl/technologies/) that underpins their software, which concretely affirms their focus on the protection of civil liberties (I highly encourage you all to spend time reading their approach to privacy, which I believe is under-appreciated at times).\n\nIt is within that lens where I believe the recent privacy concerns are either demonstrably false or misunderstood (e.g., the U.K. [campaign](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/04/campaign-launched-to-get-palantir-out-of-nhs.html) against usage of Palantir products by the U.K. government), particularly in mainstream media:\n\nThe NYPost [article](https://nypost.com/2021/08/25/fbi-palantir-glitch-allowed-unauthorized-access-to-private-data/) about a \"glitch\" that allowed unauthorized FBI access to private data was immediately and emphatically shut down by PLTR:\n\n&gt;*\u201cThere was no glitch in the software. Our platform has robust access and security controls. The customer also has rigorous protocols established to protect search warrant returns, which, in this case, the end user did not follow,\u201d the spokesperson said.*\n\nAdditionally, Ted Mabrey, Head of Global Commercial for Palantir, recently affirmed Palantir\u2019s privacy stance with Bloomberg ([source](https://youtu.be/3vQlPMznGdc?t=140), courtesy of Palantir Vision):\n\n&gt;***Bloomberg:*** *\u201cPalantir has been a fairly controversial company because of privacy concerns. Set the record straight for us \u2013\u00a0are you taking the data and analyzing \\[it\\] from governments and companies yourselves? Or, are you giving \\[them\\] the software for them to analyze their own data?\u201d (edited for conciseness)*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;***Ted:*** *\u201c\\[Palantir\\] 100% only \\[provides\\] the software to our partners, for them to be able to utilize the software, to analyze the data that they have legal access to and control over \u2026* ***We, as Palantir, as an institution control no data, we have no access to that data, we cannot utilize any data across institutions.*** *We are only providing software to our customers.\u201d (emphasis added, edited for conciseness)*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Innovative Company Culture and Hiring**\n\nIn the Q2 21 ER call, Shyam Sankar (COO of Palantir) [praised](https://youtu.be/kyZTiF5mkV8?t=1005) their open culture of innovation, characterizing it as:\n\n&gt;\"... *one that puts the very best people next to the problems that matter, the problems that define our time, and empowers each and every one of them to tell the man who, yes, is often me ... to F off.*\"  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Takeaway:** This, to me, signifies the company's endorsement of employees speaking truth to power, as well as PLTR's relentless focus on hiring the best of the best (as Alex Karp underscores in the ongoing Interview Series; [source](https://youtu.be/hjjHdys2Ph4?t=703)). While is more of an intangible variable, I still view it worthy of notating in this DD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The \"Cathie Wood\" Effect**\n\nWe are all well-aware of how popular PLTR is with ARK Invest and Cathie Wood \u2013 you can view the combined PLTR holdings across ARK funds [here](https://cathiesark.com/ark-combined-holdings-of-pltr), and notably, PLTR is represented in *all* ARK funds with Cathie consistently buying up shares. Concerns with ARK selling PLTR must be analyzed in the context of how ETF portfolio re-balancing  \u2013 additionally, while contextualizing fractional sales relative to the **overall** holdings maintained by ARK Invest.\n\nCathie recently voiced her convictions on a Bloomberg Businessweek segment ([source](https://youtu.be/f8jTbxsrx4U?t=80), courtesy of Palantir Vision):\n\n&gt;*\u201c... Palantir has the opportunity to usurp a lot of AWS, Azure, Google Compute over time. It is pushing artificial intelligence out to the edge... Palantir is using technologies that we will find about 5 years from now... They are so far ahead because of their expertise in intelligence, that it is going to accrue to the company's benefit in the commercial space... I don't think people understand how advanced Palantir is technologically, and how its platform technologies are pushing AI out to the edge \u2013 \\[they\\] are going to take share over time from the more centralized services... in the Cloud\u201d (heavily edited for emphasis), Cathie Wood*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Takeaway:** This hearkens back to my argument earlier about Palantir's moat \u2013 namely, the company's technology is so forward-thinking and advanced that, by extrapolating a little from Cathie's words, Palantir is addressing problems that most individuals and by extension, enterprise customers, haven't even contemplated with its unparalleled software functionality. That sounds like **technological supremacy** to me.\n\n[Harmonizing data + technology + human expertise](https://i.redd.it/nnji1b2yggs71.gif)\n\n**New Palantir Products (?)**\n\nIn a recent [interview](https://youtu.be/1zpL55VQnZ0?t=1950) (courtesy of Felix &amp; Friends), Alex Karp let slip (or perhaps it was a mistranslation) that there are three un-launched products! Until we receive more information and updates, it is hard to assess the implications but again, it speaks to Palantir's constant drive to innovate and disrupt. In any case, I will be following these updates closely as they are announced...\n\n# TL;DR\n\n&gt;PLTR represents one of the most compelling long-term holdings of our generation and is my highest conviction stock \u2013 their technology is leaps ahead of competitors and the moat is growing. Below are the numerous catalysts covered in this DD:\n\n1. PLTR is uniquely and competitively situated for the \"digital gold\" epoch;\n2. PLTR's moat is incredibly compelling with technological supremacy;\n3. PLTR crushed Q2 ER and is very likely sand-bagging guidance;\n4. PLTR is actively deploying its capital and investing for long-term growth (i.e., not compulsively obsessing over short-term profitability \u2013 something endemic to Wall Street neuroticism);\n5. PLTR treats privacy with paramount importance, both in principle and by design;\n6. PLTR leads with its innovative company culture and only hires the best;\n7. The \"Cathie Wood\" effect and conviction on PLTR's ability to disrupt;\n8. New (!) PLTR products on the horizon;\n\n# Callouts/Risks\n\nI have not taken the time to comprehensively address the numerous bear counterarguments against PLTR, such as its current valuation, insider selling (Alex Karp), SBC (\"stock-based compensation\") and shareholder dilution, the opportunity cost, and more. Perhaps I will do so in a future DD post, but here are some preliminary thoughts:\n\n1. **Valuation:** I am by no means a financial analyst or technical trader, nor am I currently capable of building my own valuation models (maybe one day...). A number of individuals are far better equipped and financially-savvy who created their own DCF models (e.g., [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gjp-aaoa3c), courtesy of Felix &amp; Friends). The bear argument that PLTR remains unprofitable despite being founded in 2004 ignores the context of the company pivoting to the commercial space post-DPO, and Foundry is a relatively new product compared to Gotham. I think commercial growth is just beginning to heat up and will skyrocket once more enterprise clients understand how powerful the software is.\n2. **Insider Selling:** The insider selling question has already been addressed at length in this subreddit and elsewhere. Karp must exercise his options to avoid massive tax bills and these sales have been pre-scheduled; furthermore, they constitute a very minor portion of his overall PLTR holdings \u2013 there is no reason to believe Karp has lost faith in the company's future. The fervor with which he praises PLTR and its transformational software is, well, telling about his values and focus. Relatedly, this recent FUD [article](https://www.benzinga.com/news/21/09/23092145/notable-palantir-technologies-insider-trades-7-92-million-in-company-stock) on Andrew Stephen Cohen selling his Palantir shares omitted key context about the differentiation between Class A and Class B shares  ([source](https://youtu.be/pVHmt3kG778?t=256), courtesy of Tom Nash), as well as the tax implications from options.\n3. **SBC and Shareholder Dilution:** With respect to SBC (\"stock-based compensation\") and shareholder dilution, I agree that being diluted as a shareholder seems undesirable at first glance, but growth companies (and mature companies) utilize SBC as an effective tool to attract *and* retain top talent. Employees are financially driven to ensure PLTR products remain top-class and state-of-the-art because their compensation is directly linked to the long-term success of the company itself. I expect SBC to taper down incrementally as PLTR matures, but to be sure, there are near- to mid-term risks if SBC explodes.\n4. **Opportunity Cost:** I believe the counterargument to wishing that PLTR will moon is basically: \"You are losing out on potential returns if you had allocated your assets elsewhere; therefore, HODL\u2019ing PLTR is a losing strategy.\" While this is a valid point, I think it goes back to your strategy for the stock \u2013 for me, PLTR is a long-term hold and I recognize that the stock price may trade sideways, be volatile and mercilessly toy with our emotions (seeing us breach $29 just to fly down to $23 was, well, stressful). However, when we expand our time perspective to the matter of not days or months, but years (5-10), and recognize the potential of the company, then my conviction remains steadfast \u2013 firm enough to accept the potential near-term opportunity cost for the long-term profit and ROI. Back in March 2021, Alex Karp declared that investors myopically focused on the short-term should avoid the stock, that Palantir is \u201cin \\[this\\] for the long-haul\u201d ([source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-B6Pbf1XrI)).\n\nIf you've made it this far, then I am very impressed \u2013 thanks for taking the time to read through the long-winded DD and GL to all! \n\nhttps://i.redd.it/c3dfckdsegs71.gif",

        "selftext": "Apes, here is the opportunity. $VIAC trades at P/E multiple of 7 with revenue of $28 billion, while $NFLX has 62 P/E multiple and revenue of 27$ billion. Paramount+ subscription is 4.99$ and 9.99$, and is now bundled with Showtime content for just $9.99 or 12.99$, which is significantly cheaper than $NFLX $8.99, $13.99 and $17.99. Paramount+ is currently available in 25 countries including Australia and New Zealand which launched in August 2021, and will be in 45 countries including Europe by beginning of 2022, so expect at least 100 million more subs subscribing by next year as soon as it becomes available. My projection being 150-180 million subs by end of 2022. Also, in July 2021, Paramount+ and Showtime combined accounted for 22% of all sign-ups in the US, while NFLX only 5%. As you can see $VIAC is the growth stock and $NFLX is the stagnating piece of crap with no growth left, as why they are moving into fucking games...\n\n**Hence, $VIAC should trade at price of at least $90 per share or 120% upside from current $39.35**.

        "selftext": "#**Introduction**\nEveryone talks about what to invest in, but they often skip a step when talking to beginners. What to invest in starts with knowing what is available. Here are the fundamental investment types I will be covering today:\n\n\n* Stocks \u2013 fractional ownership of a company sold in the form of shares\n* Bonds \u2013 a loan to a company or government that will pay interest in the future\n* Commodities \u2013 a raw material or agricultural product that can be bought or sold\n* Mutual Funds and ETFs  \u2013 containers holding many stocks, bonds, or commodities\n\n\nEach of these have their own unique set of attributes and uses. They\u2019re differentiated based on risk, specialization, and ease of use. I might go into these details in the future, but for now I want to start at the very beginning. \n\n#**Stocks**\nLet\u2019s say you own a business. You currently only have one location but would like to open another. You know your business is worth about $1 million dollars and that it costs $100,000 to open a new store. You decide to create 10,000 shares and attempt to sell them for $100 each. Each share represents a 0.01% ownership stake in the company. Let\u2019s say you sell 2,000 of the shares. Now you own 8,000 shares and the person or people you sold the shares to own 2,000. This means you own 80% of the company and the others own 20%. They paid you $200,000 for those shares which you can now use to open two new stores. \n\nSo why did the people in the example buy $200,000 worth of your business\u2019s stock? People buy stocks for two primary reasons. The first is that they expect the business to do well. A business that does well will grow and increase the value of its shares. This is called capital appreciation. If you go ahead and builds two more stores that generate the same income as the first, the value of the business will have roughly tripled. The $200,000 that was invested could now easily be worth $600,000. On the other hand, what if you tried to open two new stores and they both failed? Everyone would see that you\u2019re bad at running this business and those shares might only be worth $100,000 now. The second reason is to collect dividend payments from the business. A dividend is when a company takes a portion of its earnings and pays them out to its shareholders. These are more common among older well established businesses that have consistent income.\n\nStocks are most commonly traded on stock exchanges. The United States is home to the two largest exchanges in the world, the New York Stock Exchange, and the Nasdaq Stock Market. To buy or sell stocks yourself on the exchanges you need to go through a brokerage. This might sound like a daunting process but can usually be set up in less than 15 minutes. Once you have an account set up and money deposited buying and selling shares is nearly instantaneous. \n\n#**Bonds**\nWhen you need to make a large purchase like a new car you don\u2019t typically pay it all up front. You might not have enough money at the moment or want a way to spread the purchase out over time. To do this you get a loan. Let\u2019s say you want to buy a $20,000 car. You spend $4,000 on the down payment and agree to pay the rest over the next three years. You get to take the car home today because the loan pays the dealership the remaining amount owed. In return for lending you this money the bank is going to charge interest as you pay the loan back. Let\u2019s assume the interest rate is 3% per year. At this rate you\u2019ll end up paying the bank back about $16,751. The additional $751 is their payment for taking on the risk of loaning you that money.\n\nBonds and loans have a lot in common. They\u2019re both used to finance expensive purchases, have interest rates, and cover a set period of time. There are some differences though. The car loan was paid off in monthly payments over the course of three years. Each monthly payment paid some of the interest as well as some of the initial $16,000 principal. Let\u2019s say you\u2019re the bank. Instead of writing a car loan you use the money to buy a bond worth $16,000 at the same 3% interest rate over the same three year period. As the holder of the bond you would be entitled to interest rate payments, twice per year, for three years. Each semiannual payment would be 1.5% of $16,000 or $240. After three years the bond would mature, you would receive your last interest payment, and you would receive your entire $16,000 back.\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at how stocks and bonds compare. Both of them can be used to raise money, but they do so in significantly different ways. When you buy stock you are buying a fractional ownership in the business. You do not get your initial investment back unless the company pays dividends, or you sell your shares and give up ownership. Bonds can also be used to raise money, but they do not offer any ownership. When a company sells bonds it knows that it will have to pay them back in the future which can be costly. When it sells stock its current shareholders lose some of their ownership and therefore value. Let\u2019s say there are 100 shares of company XYZ and they decided to issue 20 more. Previously every share was worth 1% of the company, now every share is only worth 0.83% of the company. This is only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to understanding what stocks and bonds are and how they compare to each other. \n\n#**Commodities**\nStocks and bonds are each considered to be an asset class. An asset class is a group of investments that have similar characteristics and have to follow the same regulations. Stock in Apple is not the exact same as stock in Visa, but they serve the same purpose, can be traded the same way, and follow the same rules. The same can be said about bonds. A bond that takes seven years to mature is not the exact same as one that takes ten years, but they are both going to be structured the same. The third asset class we will be covering are commodities.\n\nA commodity is a raw material or primary agricultural product. These products are essentially the same regardless of where they come from. Copper, gold, oil, iron, and lumber are all examples of raw material commodities. Corn, soybeans, meat, and milk are all agricultural commodities. There may be minor fluctuations in quality, but in order to be traded on exchanges they need to meet a minimum requirement. These materials form the foundation of almost everything our economy produces. \n\nUnlike with stocks or bonds, commodities are not used as a way to raise money. They\u2019re traded as a way to protect the producer from risk. Let\u2019s say you can grow 10,000 bushels of wheat in a good year. You would like to get at least $8 per bushel once it\u2019s harvested. What happens if there is a perfect year for crops and everyone else has produced more than expected. This increase in supply pushes the price lower because buyers have more to choose from. The price per bushel is now only $5. In this situation you would only earn 63% as much as you were forecasting which can be hard to handle as a business. In order to protect yourself from this situation you might want to create a contract with a wheat buyer on an exchange. This contract could include you agreeing to sell your wheat for $7 per bushel at the end of the summer. This is less than the $8 you are hoping for, but it will be guaranteed. Assuming the person buying the contract was also expecting wheat to be worth $8 per bushel, they will see this as a good deal. When prices for materials are known in advance it\u2019s easier to budget and plan which is a benefit for both parties. \n\nOdds are you aren\u2019t looking to buy or sell massive quantities of wheat, or any other raw materials. If you\u2019re looking at investing in commodities it\u2019s probably going to be in oil, gold, or common metals like copper. Thankfully you don\u2019t need to be directly trading contracts with the producers to do this. There are shares that can be bought and sold like stocks on a stock exchange. Each share represents a fixed amount of the commodity, such as an ounce of gold or a barrel of oil. The primary reason people buy commodities is to protect themselves from inflation. This works because as the price of things increase, the price of the raw materials must also increase. \n\n#**Mutual Funds and Exchange Traded Funds**\nNow that you have an idea of what the three most popular asset classes are, let\u2019s take a look at a couple of the tools associated with them. Mutual funds and ETFs are both collections of stocks, bonds, or commodities that can be traded. Instead of hand selecting companies, bonds, or commodities these collections allow you to purchase a fraction of many of them all at once. \n\nThe S&amp;P 500 is an index that tracks 500 of the largest companies in the United States. It\u2019s often used as a general gauge for the US economy. If the economy is doing well and growing, this index will also be growing. Instead of having to purchase shares in all 500 businesses by hand there are numerous ETFs that will do that for you. The most popular one has a ticker name of SPY. When you buy a share of SPY, 5.9% of your money is being put in Apple stock, 2.29% is put into Facebook stock, and so on. The larger the company the larger the fraction of your money they get. This is called a market cap weighed fund. \n\nSPY is an ETF which means you can buy or sell it at any time with ease. FXAIX also covers the companies of the S&amp;P 500, but it is a mutual fund. What is the difference between the two? Well there\u2019s not much. The most noticeable one is that mutual funds cannot be traded throughout the day. They can only be purchased at the end of the day. Although not a rule, mutual funds are much more likely to be actively managed than an ETF. Active management means there is a professional portfolio manager in charge of selecting when to buy or sell the things the mutual fund holds. ETFs are much more likely to be passively managed. This means they track a set list of stocks automatically.\n\n#**Conclusion**\nThese four categories make up a vast majority of investments. Being able to understand how each of them work is crucial in making your own investment choices. Hopefully this post was able to bring up even more questions than it answered if you're new. Now that you know what the major fundamental asset classes are you might ask yourself why you would choose one over the other. This was touched on, but I never went into detail on the risk, return, history, or combination of them. All of these ideas warrant their own posts which may come in the future. Thank you for reading.\n\n~~Or just keep buying 0 DTE SPY calls \ud83d\udc12~~\n\n#**Mild subreddit self-promotion:**\nIf you enjoy these kinds of posts I created my own subreddit r/FinancialAnalysis where I post detailed write ups on various investing topics.",

So far, it's nothing but a bucket to collect money from U.S. investors and pour it into the black hole of debt created by its founder, China's best-known securities fraudster, Jia Yueting.  \n\n\nAfter eight years in business, FFIE has failed to deliver a car and is yet again saying \u201cnext year.\u201d The company has reneged on promises to build factories in five localities in the U.S. and China and repeatedly delayed the sixth. FFIE is being sued by dozens of unpaid suppliers and has failed to disclose that assets in China have been frozen by courts. And Jia appears to be running the company behind the scenes.  \n\n\nGiven the current bubble environment, FFIE nevertheless managed to raise about $1 bln from U.S. investors via PIPEs and SPAC merger in July. Now it promises to restart its abandoned factory in Hanford, California and mass-produce cars in just seven months. We doubt that timeline will hold: three recent visits to the factory showed little activity, and company formers told us there are still engineering problems to work out.  \n\n\nFFIE is the malformed lovechild of the imperiled Chinese real estate developer Evergrande (3333 HK) and Jia, China\u2019s fugitive default king. We expect Evergrande, which owns 20.5% of this company and stands to gain more equity, to sell off its shares as soon as the lockup period ends, in January 2022 if not, quietly, before that.  \n\n\nIn January 2021, the company claimed it had 14,000 reservations for the car\u2014until one week after Hindenburg published its findings that Lordstown\u2019s orders were faked. Without explanation, after March 19, FFIE no longer made reference to the number of reservations. In fact, these reservations--78% of which were from a single company\u2014had been converted in 2020 to a note payable earning 8% interest. The company strongly implies that the mystery booker, who was apparently ready to spend well over $1 bln on FFIE cars, may be an \u201caffiliate.\u201d They fail to say who it was. In H1 2021, despite the upcoming SPAC merger, FFIE took in just $144,000 in new customer deposits.  \n\n\nMassive dilution is coming down the pike. Legacy FF shareholders will receive up to 25 mln FFIE shares based on a limited upward movement in FFIE\u2019s share price alone. Over half of those shares are earmarked for Evergrande. SPAC sponsor PSAC had 23.7 mln warrants as of June.\u00a0  \n\n\nJust last August, despite having very recently raised a significant amount of cash, FFIE continued to issue promissory notes convertible to 4.4 mln new shares with a conversion value equivalent to 130% of the outstanding principal. In an S-1/A just issued on October 4, FFIE showed that it is still raising money, with some of the new debt costing 14%.  \n\n\nAdding insult to injury, FFIE\u2019s own filings state deep in the small print that it expects to need an additional $1.4 bln in funding by 2024 to achieve its financial targets. That is likely to dilute equity holders.  \n\n\nMeanwhile, FFIE may soon move U.S. investor money into private hands. The pro forma combined balance sheet shows $127.8 mln in notes payable remaining on the accounts after the SPAC merger and PIPE. Jia and other related parties already cashed out $68.7 mln \u201cin conjunction with the closing\u201d of the SPAC merger on July 21, 2021.5 We don\u2019t doubt he needs it\u2014Jia at one time claimed $6.6 bln in personal debt.  \n\n\nOn September 20, 2021, the company issued a new presentation claiming progress toward manufacturing. But former engineering executives we interviewed did not believe that the car was ready for production. FFIE\u2019s contention that it needed just $90 mln to start mass production in seven months is \u201cnot even in the ballpark of true,\u201d said one formerly highly placed executive. Another former executive said, \u201cThe story with the SPAC is that they just needed money to manufacture, but I think there are still some critical engineering issues.\u201d  \n\n\nChinese government reports show that in 2016, FFIE\u2019s subsidiary LeSee put $154 mln into the company\u2019s largest planned manufacturing site, in China\u2019s Zhejiang Province, but we visited the location and found nothing but an overgrown field. The area is so deserted that even the police station in what was intended to be the Faraday factory park has closed.  \n\n\nJia Yueting, FFIE founder, has been banned for life from being associated with publicly listed companies in China. FFIE admits in its \u201crisks\u201d section that he has \u201cillegally\u201d provided funding and guarantees to affiliated companies, improperly diverted proceeds from the public offering of a company he controlled, and lied to Chinese regulators and investors. In Hong Kong, where he was chairman of the long-halted Coolpad Group Limited (2369 HK), he failed to disclose key transactions.  \n\n\nHolding the title \u201cPartner, Chief Product &amp; User 5 October 7, 2021 Ecosystem Officer,\u201d Jia still controls key spending decisions at FFIE through the FF Global Executive Committee. Because of him, FFIE\u2019s USD accounts in China have been frozen by regulators. In a lawsuit against FFIE, the company\u2019s former General Counsel Hong Liu claimed that a Jia \u201cclique\u201d controlled the company regardless of legal commitments.\n\nEmbarrassed by Jia, FFIE hired a \u201cprofessional\u201d CEO in September 2019, but his track record in Chinese EVs is not much better. Carsten Breitfeld was co-founder of Nanjing-based Byton, which owed suppliers and employees millions of dollars when it stopped operating in 2020. He conveniently omits from his bio in the prospectus his ill-fated tenure as CEO of another Chinese EV hopeful called Iconiq, which raised over \u00a51.2 bln before going silent.12 He gets tepid reviews from formers.  \n\n\nIn the current overheated EV environment, the company appears to be having difficulty finding talent. In September, FFIE announced new executives: one from Lordstown\u2014the company an FFIE former said \u201cis setting new standards for fraud\u201d--and two from Karma, a moribund company that the auto news site Jalopnik claims may have faked prototypes. One of the Karma graduates is an ex-vice president of A123 Systems, a formerly U.S.-listed Chinese company that has been sued multiple times for patent infringement and securities fraud.  \n\n\nThere is a long list of investors looking to dump shares, from 20.5% holder China Evergrande, to the legacy company FF Global Partners, with 37.4%, to equitized suppliers, who are 6.1% of the float. Some of those holders\u2014two-thirds of the shares in the Vendor Trust and an unspecified number of the shares owned by FF Global Partners\u2014are already eligible for sale.  \n\n\nThe August registration statement indicated that $495.7 mln in liabilities were converted to fully vested shares at the SPAC closing, including $109.6 mln from vendor payables in trust subject to between 30-90 days\u2019 lockup. We expect these holders, most of whom have been unpaid for at least two years, to sell down fast. The entire lock-up for the vendors ends October 20, 2021.  \n\n\nFFIE has burned pretty much everyone who has worked with or invested in the company, save insiders like Jia. FFIE has defaulted on debts to suppliers even when it didn\u2019t have to\u2014some of the lawsuits seeking unpaid fees are for a few hundred thousand dollars. The company has repeatedly reneged on promises to build factories in both the U.S. and China. Its own former general counsel has sued FFIE for unpaid compensation and claims that management broke U.S. laws and acted as a \u201cvisa farm\u201d for Chinese nationals.  \n\u200b  \nA former executive of the company told us: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t trust Faraday with a dime. If a year ago, someone had contacted all the employee/shareholders and told us we could sell at 2 cents a share, we would have jumped at the opportunity.\u201d  \nFFIE is just a stream of grandiose announcements that are soon replaced by new hype. We think FFIE is a zero.",

        "selftext": "Yesterday I was having a look at the spactrack list of [active SPACs](https://spactrack.net/activespacs/) and, after sorting the list by IPO size with the optionable tag on, I noticed on a particular one with a set of interesting properties. The spac became substantially more interesting after I went through some of its [SEC filings](https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar?CIK=1785592).\n\nThis is a post-DA spac that has options and its merger deadline is approaching. More importantly, of the entire list, it's the optionable spac with a DA that has the lowest IPO size (13M float) and it has been trading below nav for ages.\n\nThere's barely any mention of this spac [on this sub](https://www.reddit.com/r/SPACs/search/?q=Merida&amp;restrict_sr=1) or anywhere else, so here is some due diligence based on its SEC filings that I decided to share with you even though it might still be too early to open a position and start playing this game.\n\n# 1. The Business Combination\n\nThe spac is named Merida Merger Corp I, ticker $MCMJ. The IPO took place in November 2019 and the spac target focus is the cannabis sector. The target company is Leafly, the DA was announced two months ago, on August 8th 2021, and the new ticker will eventually be $LFLY. The cannabis sector is not particularly my thing, but unfortunately for the case at hand, it is a somewhat retail-popular sector overall, so this might be seen as a downside. The stock had two recent short-lived spikes to \\~10.5 after hours in the first half of August, but it has been trading under nav for most of the time since the ipo, so it's not particularly popular.\n\nThe merger deadline, the deadline date by which the merge has to be consummated or go bust, is November 7 2021 (spactrack has the day wrong). However, according to the [Pre 14A](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1785592/000121390021049304/ea147723-pre14a_meridamer1.htm) SEC form, in October Merida will be having a special stockholders meeting where they'll attempt to extend the deadline to February 5 to \"allow the Company more time to complete the Business Combination\".\n\nThe [S-4](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1785592/000121390021046970/fs42021_meridamerger1.htm) form, filed this September 8, contains most of the information I'll now be discussing.\n\n# 2. The Float\n\nFirstly, the spac has no PIPE, the Sponsor or Founder is Merida Capital Holdings LLC, and the Underwriter Representative is EarlyBirdCapital (EBC). As always, starting by assuming a no-redemption scenario, the structure of the ownership interests in Leafly (New Leafly) after the merger is as follows (units = shares):\n\n|Leafly stockholders (insiders):|38,500,000|\n|:-|:-|\n|Merida public stockholders (IPO):|13,001,552 = 4x Sponsor|\n|Sponsor:|3,250,388|\n|Underwriter:|120,000|\n\nSo we have:\n\n|Total:|54,871,940|\n|:-|:-|\n|Shares Outstanding (IPO + Sponsor + Underwriter):|16,371,940|\n|Public Free Float:|13,001,552|\n\nThe number of Sponsor shares apparently went through some forfeiture and re-issuance over time, you can find a description of the events on p. 233 (in summary: 2,875,000 shares in August 2019 + 0.2 x 2,875,000 in November 2019 = aggregate 3,450,000; then, 450,000 were forfeited and 250,388 were issued).\n\nThe 120K shares assigned to the underwriter are not easy to find, you can find the statement on p. 262, but more clearly on page F-16 under Representative Shares. The underwriter shares are sometimes added to the Sponsor's and referred to as being part of it.\n\nThe figure of 44.5M shares of common stock at the top of the S-4 consists of the estimated maximum number of shares to be issued to the Leafly stockholders (insiders), and it corresponds to the stated 38.5M shares + a potential 6M in Earnout Shares, the assignment of which is subject to company/stock performance as usual. You can find the description of the conditions the Earnout Shares are under on page 96.\n\nOn page 19, and again on p. 97, under Pro Forma Ownership of (New) Leafly Upon Closing, they state that, immediately after the closing of the Business Combination, the current securityholders of Leafly will own approximately 70% of the equity of the combined company, Merida\u2019s public stockholders will own approximately 26% and Merida\u2019s Sponsor (+ Underwriter) will own approximately 4%. However, there is a mistake in the calculation: the 26% should rather be 24% and the 4% should be 6% (you can confirm that yourself).\n\n# 3. The Redemptions\n\nThe maximum redemption scenario they consider in this form consists of a number of 7,658,804 shares being redeemed, see page 36. This value varies each 6 months, you can verify that in the previous filings. The maximum redemption amount is derived \"on the basis that Merida is required to have $85M in Closing Cash immediately prior or upon the Closing, after giving effect to payments to redeeming stockholders\".\n\nAs stated in the form, compliance with this Minimum Cash Condition (search for this term in the S-4) can be waived by Merida and Leafly in case the number of redeemed shares is above the stated maximum redemption limit.\n\nIn a scenario where a moderately high number of shares are redeemed, say 75%, the public float after the merger will consist of 3.25M shares. In a high redemption rate scenario, say 90%, the float will be 1.3M. For comparison, IRNT and SPIR achieved 92% and 91% (post-redemption float of 1.4M and 2.1M) respectively, whereas OPAD and ML achieved 79.1% and 74% (post-redemption float of 3.4M and 9.1M) respectively. Their maximum redemption scenario corresponds to a rate of 40%, so if the previous values are attained, they'll have to waive the minimum cash condition.\n\n# 4. Warrants\n\nAccording to page 263, there are 10,451,087 Warrants of Merida outstanding, consisting of 6,500,776 Warrants originally sold as part of the units issued in the IPO, and 3,950,311 private warrants that were sold in a private placement to the Sponsor and the Underwriter (on page 5: 3,750,000 sold privately on Nov 7 2019 + 200,311 sold privately on Nov 13 2019 = aggregate 3,950,311 private). The Sponsor itself holds 3,318,262 Warrants (page 9 or 22). Therefore:\n\n|Private Warrants (dilutive):|3,950,311|\n|:-|:-|\n|Public Warrants (dilutive):|6,500,776|\n\nNote that there is (yet) another mistake on page \"v\" in their definition of \"private warrants\": they state that it means 9,950,311 ( = 3,950,311 + 6,000,000) private Warrants of Merida sold to the Sponsor and the Underwriter, but that 9.9M number doesn't appear anywhere else on the S-4 and the number of private warrants is always said to be that 3.9M number everywhere else across the form.\n\n# 5. The Lock-ups\n\nEverything except the public float is subject to a lock-up.\n\n**A) Shares**\n\nThe shares of the Leafly stockholders (insiders) are locked for a period of 180 days after the Closing:\n\n1. See the definition of \"Merger Consideration\" and then of \"Merger Shares\" on page v;\n2. Then, on page 2 we have: \"All of the Merger Shares and Earnout Shares, if issued, will be subject to transfer restrictions for a period of 180 days following completion of the Business Combination\".\n\nThe Sponsor shares are also locked. On page 108, we have, under Sponsor Agreement: \"the sponsor shares will be subject to transfer restrictions for a period of 180 days following completion of the Business Combination\".\n\nThe 120,000 representative shares are also locked for a period of 180 days, see page F-16.\n\nA summary of the lock-up can be found on page 101: \"All of the Merida Common Stock issuable to Leafly\u2019s stockholders and all of the Merida Common Stock held by the Sponsor would be subject to a 180-day lockup\".\n\nThis info is further scattered across the form (see mainly: Sales Restrictions - page 97/98). A further summary of the 180 day lock-up can be found on page 262.\n\n**B) Warrants**\n\nOn page 231 regarding private Warrants, we find: \"The amount of beneficial ownership for each individual or entity post-Business Combination includes shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of Merida\u2019s Warrants, as such warrants will become exercisable 30 days after the consummation of the Business Combination.\"\n\nOn page 236 we also find some information about this 30 day period, but the main Warrants lock-up statements are on page F-14: \"Public Warrants will become exercisable on the later of (a) 30 days after the completion of a Business Combination or (b) 12 months from the closing of the IPO.\" The same applies to the Private Warrants according to the above and to page F-15 (they are identical).\n\n# 6. Further Notes\n\nTherefore, for at least 30 days following the Closing, the free public float will consist exclusively of the shares that have not been redeemed (13M minus the redeemed shares). However, it's important to emphasize that many sources derive their data from bloomberg. Bloomberg, as it appears on bloomberg terminals, defines Free Float or Equity Float (see page 6 or 22 of their [Methodology PDF](https://data.bloomberglp.com/professional/sites/10/Bloomberg-US-Equity-Index-Methodology.pdf)) as: \"Number of shares that are available to the public. This figure is calculated by subtracting the shares held by insiders and those deemed to be stagnant shareholders from the shares outstanding. Stagnant holders include ESOP's, ESOT's, QUEST's, employee benefit trusts, corporations\u2019 not actively managing money, venture capital companies and shares held by governments\".\n\nWe do not have access to that information, we don't know the stagnant shareholders, so our free float value rather represents an upper bound (the bloomberg float will always be less than ours).\n\n# 7. The Target Company\n\nAs someone else put it, Leafly is surprisingly unprofitable, with a net negative revenue until 2024 on strong projected growth. According to page 41:\n\n\"We began operating in 2011 and have yet to generate a profit. We incurred a net loss of $10 million and $32 million for the calendar years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We intend to continue to expend significant funds to support platform feature development, expanding our service offerings, expand our marketing and sales operations, improve and expand our technology infrastructure, hire additional employees, pursue strategic opportunities, meet the increased compliance requirements associated with our transition to and operation as a public company and otherwise support our operations and growth. As we continue to grow, we expect the aggregate amount of these expenses will also continue to grow.\"\n\n\"We have a history of net losses, and we may not achieve or maintain profitability in the future, especially as our costs increase.\"\n\nYou can also find the Investors Presentation [here](https://s28.q4cdn.com/937840835/files/doc_presentations/Leafly-Investor-Deck-(8.8.21).pdf).\n\n# 8. Final Remarks\n\nThe target company is not great in terms of revenue, but deSPAC squeeze plays are not based on fundamentals, quite the opposite. The setup is all there, the spac has options, a low IPO float to begin with, lock-ups on everything, it has been trading under nav for a long time and has a proper chance of a reasonably high redemption rate.\n\nWhat is missing yet is a high options OI, but it doesn't really make sense to speak about that yet, or of gamma ramps yet, since we don't have further dates for the redemptions vote (which will be 2 days before the vote meeting, called the Special Meeting on the S-4; if they are trying to extend the deadline beyond Nov 7, then it should not be sooner than that date), merger vote, ticker change, etc.\n\nNo one is chasing this spac for a deSPAC play at the moment, and the average 3-month stock volume is 80K and lately it has been around 11K daily. Touching the stock right now is a bad idea, we want it to trade at or below nav as it has been until the redemption deadline. Before that, the stock would have to be bought \"adiabatically\" and with the sole purpose of redeeming the shares later on. Starting to trade options is also not a good idea, we don't want a massive OI right now that attracts all sorts of attention, we only want to set the OI up closer to the redemptions and merger vote. \n\nSo, for now, this is a stock that those interested in deSPAC squeezes should be watching closely and without interfering much (yet). I would also ask you to keep this DD here for the time being and not crosspost it to other subs as not to increase attention to this play yet.",

In comparison, $NFLX +19.4% streaming revenue yoy (Revenue growth stagnating and is flattening out), $VIAC added +6.5M streaming subscribers (42M total between P+ and Showtime) and +2.8M PlutoTV MAUs (52.3M total), while $NFLX added 1.5m global subs (Very shitty performance by NFLX). $VIAC currently is present in USA, Latin America and Nordics. Now they have expanded into Australia and New Zealand (Aggregate Population of 38 million people) and in launching in beginning of 2022 into Europe (Population 750 million people), so if Paramount Plus captures say 10% of Europe and Australia, that's addition of at least 80 million subscribers to the service. \n\nResult: $VIAC should trade at least with P/E multiple of 15-20 = 90-105$ per share, in comparison to $NFLX that has P/E multiple of 60, and $DIS P/E multiple of 80. \n\n**Below is my position:** \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fv7zgl3digr71.png?width=1284&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=455c85ed59e4c5f692b01c80360dd6792c1e5c70\n\nMy investment thesis is based on these: **Upcoming slate of Content** and **Subscriber Growth + Financials**\n\n**Content currently on and upcoming to Paramount Plus+ (ViacomCBS streaming platform) in Q4 2021:**\n\n* [2 new South Park Movies](https://www.kerrang.com/the-news/two-new-south-park-movies-to-be-released-in-2021/) exclusively on P+, one expected on 29th October (Halloween special) and the other one in November/December.\n* Paramount+ is forever exclusive home of the **\"Avatar: The Last Airbender\"** and **\"The Legend Of Korra\"** series. Yeah, Netflix no longer has them, so subscribe to P+ to watch them!!! Also, $VIAC has created [Avatar Studios](https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Avatar_Studios#:~:text=Avatar%20Studios%20is%20a%20production,as%20co%2Dchief%20creative%20officers.&amp;text=The%20studio%20will%20produce%20brand,%2Doffs%2C%20and%20theatrical%20films) with original creators of ATLA and TLOK, and P+ will be [exclusive home for new ATLA shows and movies coming in 2022](https://avatarnews.co/post/661879092665253888/as-a-follow-up-to-the-recent-news-revealing-avatar).\n* All Star Trek movies (including original Motion picture from I to X films, also including new season of Star Trek: Lower Decks animated series) are currently on P+ and new Paramount Plus originals premiering \"Star Trek: Prodigy\" series and new season of \"Star Trek: Discovery\" series.\n* Btw, \"Paw Patrol: the Movie\" and new episodes of P+ original \"Rugrats\" is streaming exclusively on Paramount+, for all the Parents out there. Btw, all Nickelodeon content is now exclusive to P+.\n* Yellowstone Spinoff \"Y:1883\" and \"Mayor of Kingstown\" with Jeremy Renner (HawkEye) is upcoming on November and December, respectively, this year.\n* Top Exclusive films are on P+ already: Infinite (with Mark Wahlberg), A Quiet Place II and I,  The J Team, [\"Paranormal Activity: Next of Kin\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsZrPDa3mFg) on October 28th, \"Madame X\" film of Madonna tour on October 8th.\n* Also, New seasons of Survivor, NCIS, FBI (all three series), Young Sheldon (new Season 5), Evil, Guilty Party (Kate Beckinsale), SEAL Team, The Neighborhood, etc\n* Lastly, all the Sports and Specials (The Emmys, MTV VMA, Tony's awards, etc) you can think of is streaming exclusively on P+. NFL, College Football, Big 3, Champions League, Europa League, Serie A,  Concacaf Qualifiers, March Madness, Golf, etc.\n* Btw, Paramount Plus is currently bundles with Showtime content for limited time. Also P+ is only launched in 25 countries currently including Australia and New Zealand launched recently, and will be in 45 countries including Europe by 2022, so expect at least 100 million more subs subscribing by next year as soon as it becomes available.\n\n[2 New ATLA movies &amp; shows](https://preview.redd.it/9obaroskagr71.jpg?width=1280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c01f503a0c54bed8b9ceedc8b6c208d2b079181f)\n\n**Now, Financials and Subscriber Growth:**\n\n**Paramount+ added +6.5 million new sVoD subscribers (42M total)** during Q2 while Netflix reported only +1.5 millions subs globally.

I only selected companies I would want to add to my portfolio (or existing positions), and compared them to the Nasdaq composite.\n\n* Advanced Micro Devices ($AMD)\t35.47%\n* **Nasdaq\t 26.79%**\n* Google ($GOOGL)\t24.05%\n* Microsoft($MSFT) \t15.22%\n* Apple ($AAPL)\t9.18%\n* Visa ($V)      4.10%\n* Amazon ($AMZN) \t-2.28%\n* Disney ($DIS)\t-4.71%\n* Mastercard ($MA)\t-6.83%\n\nUnderstanding that share price fluctuations are all relative, as a company could have a great run before the 6 months analysis, I'm curious if there's a way to interpret this data and view any of these as good opportunities to buy a supposed dip. For example, could you look at this data and think that now is a good time to purchase shares of Amazon and Mastercard, given their underperformance relative to the Nasdaq, or would you use this as an opportunity to buy more of AMD and Google to capitalize on their recent momentum?\n\nSource: I pulled the data from Google Finance and compared the share prices to that of April 12th, 2021 (180 days before October 8th, 2021).",

        "selftext": "I'm about to turn 18 in a few days, and I have a few ideas of what I am going to do.\n\nCurrently banking with TD, solid and reliable bank, have previous history with my debit card there, so I think it'll be a good place to start with my credit card and TFSA. Any objections to this? \n\nWith a credit card, I was looking at the TD Cash Back Visa Card; zero annual fee, and some small cashback percentages. I am in university, so I won't be making any crazy purchases, so I thought a zero annual fee card would be a good place to start so I can start building my credit with small purchases. Going to research how to efficiently build credit, but from what I've learned so far, the major thing is to make sure I never incur a balance to the next month. Any other advice for credit building?\n\nI will be opening a TFSA with TD, and max it out for the year. Currently, I've been looking at a couple ETFS and high-dividend stocks. The main ones being [VFV.TO](https://VFV.TO) (Vanguard SP 500 index), [VDY.TO](https://VDY.TO) or [XEI.TO](https://XEI.TO) (both high-divdend stocks with Vangaurd and Black Rock), [VRE.TO](https://VRE.TO) (Vanguard FTSE REIT), and I'll probably throw a few shares at [TD.TO](https://TD.TO), [RY.TO](https://RY.TO), and [ENB.TO](https://ENB.TO) (all stable dividend Canadian companies). I also plan on doing DRIP with the dividends, is this possible in a TFSA? I know that timing the market is practically impossible, and with companies like these where I don't expect any large gains immediately, should I just purchase the shares all on the same day? Or should I do it over a few months and gradually increase my holdings? I guess the only downside to that will be the transaction fees :/\n\nFor my normal investing cash account (I don't want to touch margin yet), I will be sticking with the big tech companies (mostly American) and a few penny stocks or smaller companies if I find some good ones. I know since I am young I can play more on the riskier side, but also being a student, my capital is not large, so I have to be strategic with how much I allocate with each. Is a 60% risk, 40% conservative ratio good?\n\nAlso, should I be worried about my RRSP yet? I don't have a job so my income isn't stable, and I feel like it'll be more effective if I put my cash into other investments. Maybe once I get a full time job I will consider it again.\n\nAny other advice? Thanks to anyone who read it all, all the best :)",

        "selftext": "Universal Ibogaine (TSXV: IBO) is going public today so I thought I would summarize a bit about what I know in the ibogaine space and potential benefits to addiction and mental healing. Ibogaine has the power to save lives and fight the global opioid crisis and as UI is the only pureplay ibogaine player in the market I figured it was worth a quick analysis as they move forward to clinical trials in Canada w/ data from 3,700 successful trials so far from Dr. Sola in Mexico who's administered more Ibogaine trials than anyone in the world. \n\nQuick video from IBO today - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eP1dEanJNgI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eP1dEanJNgI)\n\n For those who don't know, Ibogaine is a naturally occurring psychoactive substance found in Tabernanthe iboga (iboga), a perennial rainforest shrub native to Central Africa. In African traditional medicine and rituals, the yellowish root or bark is used to produce hallucinations. Ibogaine, a derivative from the iboga roots and bark, is broad spectrum agonizer that targets multiple receptor sites in the brain to cure addiction. \n\n**HOW does it work?** \n\nThe so-called \u201cmechanism of action\u201d of ibogaine (how it works) is still not fully understood. However, we do know that it targets multiple receptor sites in the brain, including the opioid receptors, the NMDA glutamate receptor, the nicotinic receptors and so on. In addition, ibogaine stimulates the production of growth factor (GDNF specifically) which supports neuro-generative processes and the production of new dopamine cells. In addition, ibogaine metabolizes into noribogaine, which is a long-acting compound which effectively functions as an internal microdosing system for up to 3-4 months after being consumed. \n\n Ibogaine has been shown to rebuild opioid receptor sites and return the brain to an opioid na\u00efve state with as little as one dose. Basically - it rebuilds your brain to a state before you were addicted to various substances. Crazy!\n\nAs a result, this is no casual day drug and different to other psychedelics. Patients must be in a healthy enough state to take Ibogaine as deaths have occurred when used with opioids or prescription drugs. \n\n**Is this Legal?**\n\n Universal Ibogaine will soon be conducting clinical trials in Canada and as of right now - Ibogaine must be implemented in a medically supervised scenario in Canada and Mexico. it is not Legal yet in the US.\n\n**UI\u2019s World Class Team**\n\nUI Co-Founder Dr Alberto Sola has administered over 3700 ibogaine treatments, more than any other doctor in the world. UI CEO Dr Rami Batal has a 20-year successful track record in developing experimental medicines.\n\n**UI\u2019s Funding**\n\nClosed $6 million concurrent financing, acquired the Kelburn Clinic in Canada. UI is revenue positive with its first clinic acquisition.\n\n**Quote from CEO**\n\n \u201cWe are excited to now focus on our growth plan related to rolling out our addiction treatment offering starting with the Kelburn Clinic, as well as clinically developing and ultimately medicalizing ibogaine to become a central treatment for opioid and other addictions. The plan forward calls on engagement and close coordination with Health Canada through a clinical trial application (\u201cCTA\u201d) submission process and a subsequent undertaking, with the approval of Health Canada, of a phase 2 \u201chuman proof of concept\u201d clinical trial to establish the safety and efficacy of ibogaine. We aim to conduct the trial in the coming year and to establish a firm path to medicalizing ibogaine in Canada. Concomitantly, our work in treating addiction at the Kelburn clinic and future facilities will result in the creation and application of innovative addiction treatment approaches and methods. Essentially, we will still offer and advance addiction care while we work on authorizing ibogaine as a central treatment for addiction\u201d.",

Obviously, the company has a good moat especially now that the rave in the market is infrastructure and energy, with the SMR exposure a huge bonus if this comes to fruition.

For those of us who have MMAT dividend placeholders, $MMTLP showed up in our accounts with a dollar figure - that's going up! These are dividends that can be now traded - I know, that's odd, but it's happening. You can sell them on any exchange but only BUY and sell them with brokers that allow pennies (Schwab TDA, etc.) However, you probably don't want to sell them now, because you're selling away your right to collect the ACTUAL dividend when the old $TRCH assets are sold off. Hedgies want you to sell now, cheaply. I might actually buy more, but I'm not selling now.  \\*Caveat: not financial advice.

        "selftext": "*Here is a comparison video to news that is coming out today from several sources that compares it to the documentary film \"The Inside Job\" from 2008. This documentary covers the events leading up to and during the financial collapse in quite some detail and is free to watch on Youtube. The comparison video is only a 11 minute watch. Here is the link:*\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TM4UDby1CxU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TM4UDby1CxU)\n\n\\- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n*Here is a post written by* [*u/highquaIity*](https://www.reddit.com/user/highquaIity/) *- which covers even more similarities in detail and didn't get much exposure. I think he is spot on.*\n\nLet\u2019s take a trip back in time to 2008, just before one of the biggest financial crises the US has ever experienced. 4 of 7 Fed seats resigned shortly before the crisis reared its ugly head. [If you've watched Inside Job, you probably remember Fed Governor Frederic Mishkin's announcement of resignation, and the hilarious reasoning behind it.](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/other20080528a.htm) It\u2019s important to note that the vast majority of Americans were oblivious to the meltdown that was happening right in front of them.\n\nFast forward to 2021, where the Federal Reserve\u2019s monetary policy, QE infinity, has elevated financial markets to unstable levels. They are undoubtedly responsible for many of our financial problems we will soon face. In early September, 2 Fed Presidents announced that they will be selling their stocks per \u201cconflict of interests\u201d issues. [Perfect timing?](https://www.barrons.com/articles/fed-presidents-sell-stocks-perception-conflict-of-interest-51631283770) [Shortly after this announcement, the Evergrande contagion fiasco arrives, sending fear and uncertainty surging through our financial markets.](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-evergrande-shares-plummet-default-risks-2021-09-20/) What a coincidence that those Fed Presidents got out in time \ud83d\ude05.\n\nThese same Fed Presidents and one Vice Chair for Supervision, will have all departed from the Fed by October 13th. The 2 Fed Presidents recently got exposed for insider trading and announced that they were resigning. They didn\u2019t receive any punishment, they resigned \ud83e\udd29. Not only did they resign, but they resigned during a fairly turbulent period in financial markets. Sound familiar? [Perfect timing....again?](https://www.forbes.com/sites/teakvetenadze/2021/09/27/dallas-fed-president-robert-kaplan-resigns-amid-scrutiny-over-trading---hours-after-boston-colleague-steps-down/?sh=7490ecf9796a) Straight from the article: \"Rosengren made the [announcement](https://www.bostonfed.org/news-and-events/news/2021/09/rosengren-retirement.aspx) in the morning, citing health issues, while Kaplan released a [statement](https://www.dallasfed.org/news/releases/2021/nr210927kaplan.aspx) several hours later saying the \u201crecent focus\u201d on his financial disclosure risked **\u201cbecoming a distraction\u201d** for the institution.\" Kaplans statement lets me know that he genuinely believes the public is completely delusional. I unfortunately have to agree with that sentiment.\n\nAccording to the Treasury secretary, the US government is projected to run out of money by October 18th if the debt ceiling is not raised. If the debt ceiling isn\u2019t raised, the US will default for the first time in history. With an issue as big as this, one would think that it would be taken very seriously, [especially considering the fact that Congress goes on recess next week and comes back on \\*October 18th\\*](https://bgrdc.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/2021-Combined-Congressional-Calendar-BGR.pdf).\n\nInstead of behaving like responsible adults, Congress engages in blame/responsibility shifting. For whatever reason, the GOP and Democrats have to put on a show before making a decision regarding the debt ceiling. We still haven\u2019t fully recovered from the pandemic. Failure to raise the debt ceiling will cause a financial crisis that will make 2008\u2019s look minuscule. With this in mind, Fed members are heading out of the door, seemingly just moments before an enormous economic downturn.\n\nI can\u2019t help but feel like the vast majority of the US is sleepwalking into potentially the biggest financial crisis we've seen. Although we are prepared for it, I wish that other people would focus on these matters that are actually important, rather than focusing on trivial matters, such as celebrities lives. **You don't need to be a rocket scientist to see that something is brewing, the writing is on the wall.**",

These include the following:\n\n**Petroleum Exploration Society of Great Britain Conference on September 14-15, 2021**\n\nVirtual Program: [https://africa.pesgb.org.uk/virtual-programme/](https://africa.pesgb.org.uk/virtual-programme/)\n\n**Africa E&amp;P Summit and Exhibition on September 22-23, 2021 (Leading Independent African E&amp;P)**\n\nHome Page: [https://www.frontierenergy.network/events/africa-e-p-summit-2021](https://www.frontierenergy.network/events/africa-e-p-summit-2021)\n\nSummit Speakers: [https://www.frontierenergy.network/events/africa-e-p-summit-2021/speakers](https://www.frontierenergy.network/events/africa-e-p-summit-2021/speakers)\n\n**The second conference, which was held in London, was sponsored by several O&amp;G majors including ExxonMobil, BP, Royal Dutch Shell, CNOCC, TotalEnergies, and Schlumberger.** Many of these companies are currently active in the area, including offshore Namibia, and this provides the opportunity for synergies and infrastructure cost savings in what could be the world\u2019s next oil hotspot.\n\n**This post includes four sections of resources:**\n\n\u00b7 Transcribed versions of the presentations of CEO Scot Evans and Structural Geologist Dr. James Granath along with slides presented by Namibia MME Petroleum Commissioner Maggy Shino.\n\n\u00b7 Current exploration in offshore Namibia by Exxon, Shell, and TotalEnergies.\n\n\u00b7 Upcoming events featuring presentations by Recon Africa and Namibian officials.\n\n\u00b7 Selections from the Encore Recon Africa Discord Library.\n\n**PRESENTATION TRANSCRIPTS &amp; SLIDES**\n\nThe Scot Evans presentation included many of the items found in the investor presentation on Recon Africa\u2019s web site along with some recent updates about 2D seismic, which he said is now 2/3 complete (probably over 75% if you add a week of work). If you would like to review the latest investor presentation, which was last updated in August 2021, you can find it here:\n\n[https://reconafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/ReconAfrica-Investor-Presentation.pdf](https://reconafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/ReconAfrica-Investor-Presentation.pdf)\n\nThe day after CEO Scot Evans and Maggy Shino presented at the Africa E&amp;P Summit, Recon Africa announced a one-year extension to the first renewal period of their exploration license on PEL 73 covering 6.3 million acres onshore Namibia, meaning the first and second exploration periods should now extend out to at least 2026. This will help facilitate potential JV partners with sufficient time to properly evaluate and plan detailed exploration programs to further evaluate the Kavango Basin, including any potential sub-basins.\n\n**Transcript from Scot Evans Presentation (9/22/2021)**\n\n[Scot Evans Presentation Link](https://img1.wsimg.com/blobby/go/d53afaf0-187c-44a8-8c07-0d41fde346bb/downloads/20210922_Presentation_Scot_Evans_Africa_EP_Sum.pdf?ver=1632953101923)\n\nDr. James Granath presented a week earlier. One of the notable comments he made was that Namibia has requested that Recon Africa create firebreaks in the area to facilitate the acquisition of additional 2D seismic data to be acquired with tighter grid spacing. This should significantly enhance the detail from the 2D seismic acquisition which is currently taking place on existing roads. It is expected that the acquisition and processing of the first 450 km of 2D seismic will be completed by the end of October or early November as Recon Africa targets to start exploration drilling again in December with the help of much more subsurface data.\n\n**Transcript from Dr. James Granath Presentation (9/15/2021)**\n\n[Dr. James Granath Presentation Link](https://img1.wsimg.com/blobby/go/d53afaf0-187c-44a8-8c07-0d41fde346bb/downloads/20210915_James_Granath_Presentation_unoffical_.pdf?ver=1632953101922)\n\nMaggy Shino, Petroleum Commissioner of Namibia\u2019s Ministry of Mines &amp;

        "selftext": "Good Friday evening to all of you here on r/StockMarket. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning October 4th, 2021.\n\n# **October may have a bad reputation, but stocks are entering a normally positive period - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/01/october-may-have-a-bad-reputation-but-stocks-are-entering-a-normally-positive-period.html)**\n*****\n&gt; October may have a bad reputation, but the fourth quarter has mostly been a positive time for stocks.\n*****\n&gt; Despite worries about central bank tightening, the debt ceiling, Chinese developer Evergrande and Covid-19, many strategists expect stocks to eclipse recent highs after a rocky period in October.\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 has averaged outsized gains of 3.9% in the fourth quarter and was up four out of every five years since World War II, according to CFRA. The next best quarter is the first, with an average gain of 2.3%. The worst is the third, up just 0.6%.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cQ4 2021 will likely record a higher-than-average return. However, investors will need to hang on tight during the typically tumultuous ride in October, which saw 36% higher volatility when compared with the average for the other 11 months,\u201d notes CFRA chief investment strategist Sam Stovall.\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 eked out a small gain for the third quarter, but was down nearly 5% for the month of September, with a bad ending as the S&amp;P 500 dropped 1.2% on Thursday.\n*****\n&gt; The indexes kicked off the first trading session in October on a positive note, however. With the S&amp;P 500 adding 1.1% and the Nasdaq closing 0.8% higher on Friday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 482.54 points.\n*****\n&gt; https://i.imgur.com/FEg9jmU.png\n*****\n&gt; Bespoke Investment Group analyzed the behavior of the S&amp;P 500 in years when it was up solidly year-to-date heading into the fourth quarter. In those years, the market typically gained in the quarter, but there were weaker than normal returns in October and the quarter itself, when September was a negative month.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe S&amp;P 500 has been down in September 50 times since 1928, and in those years, it has actually averaged a decline of 0.41% in October and a gain of just 0.75% in Q4,\u201d Bespoke noted. When September\u2019s performance was positive, the S&amp;P gained a much stronger 1.6% average in October and an average 5% in the fourth quarter, according to the firm.\n*****\n&gt; Bespoke found that while October is remembered for stock market crashes, like those in 1929 and 1987, the market is usually positive. The Dow, for instance, gained 60% of the time in October over the past 50 years, averaging an increase of 0.5%. It was negative most of the time in September, with an average loss of 0.9%.\n*****\n&gt; # Jobs, jobs, jobs\n&gt; One of the first hurdles markets face in the new quarter is Friday\u2019s employment report, potentially one of the final triggers for the Federal Reserve\u2019s decision on when to taper its $120 billion-a-month bond buying program.\n*****\n&gt; Economists expect about 475,000 jobs were added in September, according to an early consensus figure from FactSet. Just 235,000 payrolls were added in August, about 500,000 less than expected.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe only way I could see them delaying the tapering is if we get a very weak number, something closer to zero,\u201d said Ethan Harris, head of global economic research at Bank of America. \u201cAnything that looks like 100,000, 200,000, they just go ahead\u201d with the taper.\n*****\n&gt; Harris said the biggest concern for the economy remains Covid, though new cases are slowing.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe big question is when does the Covid story start to fade a bit, allowing activity to come back,\u201d he said. He expects the pandemic will continue to be a big factor in the labor market in September.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe think fear of getting Covid on the job was a big factor in August and will be a factor in September as well,\u201d he said. \u201cBy October, the early hints are people are starting to feel more comfortable and you should get some beginnings of a reacceleration of job growth.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; The market got some positive news on that front on Friday with Merck\u2019s promising data for its Covid antiviral pill.\n*****\n&gt; # Central banks tightening\n&gt; A big event in the fourth quarter could be the beginning of the unwind of the Federal Reserve\u2019s easy policies.\n*****\n&gt; The central bank last week signaled it is nearly ready to take that first step away from the policies used during the pandemic to maintain financial market liquidity and help the economy.\n*****\n&gt; The Fed is widely expected to announce in November that it will start to slow its bond purchases, and Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said he expects it to finish by the middle of next year.\n*****\n&gt; Other central banks around the world are also making the same noises or actually moving to raise interest rates. Bond market pros now expect a trend toward higher interest rates.\n*****\n&gt; Just in the past week, rates shot higher, with the 10-year Treasury yield rising from about 1.31% while the Fed was meeting Sept. 22 to as high as 1.56% just a week later. On Friday, the yield eased back a bit to just under 1.50%.\n*****\n&gt; https://i.imgur.com/9dO7jZc.png\n*****\n&gt; The move toward tapering so far has not had much impact on markets, though strategists say it could if yields shoot higher. The bond buying program, or quantitative easing, was also credited with providing market liquidity, which has been fuel for stock market gains.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe Fed is trying very hard to telegraph what they are doing well in advance and take the shock out of what they\u2019re doing. Bond yields have gone up a bit but not in a way that\u2019s troubling for the economy,\u201d said Harris. \u201cThe real risk from the Fed comes when they start talking about hiking interest rates. ... That\u2019s a story for next year.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Rising yields would become more risky for stocks if they were to continue to move up rapidly. Tony Crescenzi, PIMCO executive vice president, said he expects the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield to trade in a range of 1.50% to 2% this year.\n*****\n&gt; Crescenzi said the move higher in yields has to do with more persistent inflation expectations and the Fed\u2019s persistent move toward less easy policy. \u201cIt\u2019s still marching forward with its plan to taper and eventually tighten,\u201d he said. \u201cThe taper doesn\u2019t set a date for tightening, but the clock starts ticking once the taper begins.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; The jump in rates rattled stocks in the past week, particularly tech stocks. The S&amp;P 500 was lower by 2.2% for the week and the Nasdaq shed 3.2%.\n*****\n&gt; # Surprising earnings\nEarnings have been a big catalyst for the stock market, with huge upside surprises boosting sentiment this year. But some strategists warn that if companies sound too cautious when they report third-quarter profits in the next couple of weeks, that could be a forewarning for the market.\n*****\n&gt; Julian Emanuel, head of equity and derivative strategy at BTIG, said rising earnings estimates for this year and next year have been a tailwind. \u201cThose in our view have now plateaued and potentially peaked,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the market perceived they peaked rather than plateaued on a near to medium-term basis, then we have a problem for the stock market.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Investors are also watching the supply chain issues that are disrupting many companies\u2019 ability to get parts and even products. They are already impacting earnings and pressuring margins. Some have already warned about the problem, and more are expected to detail the issues during earnings calls.\n*****\n&gt; Congress averted a government shutdown, but political feuding is likely to hang over the markets in the fourth quarter. The bigger task facing lawmakers will be to raise the debt ceiling, which could become worrisome for markets if the government reaches the limit before action is taken.\n*****\n&gt; As the fourth quarter moves ahead, the fate of the proposed $3.5 trillion infrastructure plan, which is opposed by Republicans and some Democrats, remains up in the air. Bank of America\u2019s Harris said he expects it to be cut back to about $1.5 trillion.\n*****\n&gt; # Other issues\nChinese property developer Evergrande\u2019s failure to make its debt payments temporarily spooked the market in September. Its problems are not solved even as investors expect that a financial meltdown will be averted.\n*****\n&gt; Evergrande\u2019s progress will remain an important story for the markets in the fourth quarter, as the company struggles under its $300 billion debt burden.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/DxoNJCE.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE S&amp;P SECTORS FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/nz0naN5.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/uWt4LHK.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/JSLq6e1.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/RtabSpV.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/tJmePd2.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/6HSoEdC.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/ScqSlq1.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/e0S19DA.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!]())**\n(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/JWcdTjl.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/JeByjl1.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/4dO1a3g.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/vOWwHAb.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Mega Caps Underperforming as Energy Explodes\n\n&gt; In November of last year, we took a look at the performance spread between the equal and market cap weighted versions of the S&amp;P 500. The chart below provides an update through the end of September where positive readings indicate outperformance of the equal-weight S&amp;P 500 and negative readings indicate outperformance of the market cap weighted index. In March 2020, as the market was plunging from the February peak and bottoming towards the end of the month, mega-caps such as Apple (APPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), and Facebook (FB) significantly outperformed the broader market, resulting in a 5.68 percentage point spread between the return of the equally weighted and market cap weighted S&amp;P 500. Whereas the equal-weighted index declined 18.19% in March 2020, the market cap weighted index dropped 'just' 12.51%. In a reversal of these trends, the equal-weighted index outperformed between the months of September 2020 and March 2021, rallying 30.84% while its market cap weighted counterpart gained 18.14%. Over these months, there was a maximum monthly spread of 3.37 percentage points in favor of the equal-weighted index, which occurred last December. In recent months, mega-caps briefly took back the reins before the trend reversed in September when the equal-weighted index outperformed by 0.82 percentage points.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/10121-Spread.png))**\n\n&gt; With the month of September behind us, the table below lists the 18 stocks in the S&amp;P 500 that finished the month up over 10%, and less than a quarter of the stocks in the index (22%) finished the month higher. Overall, the average performance of stocks in the index was a decline of 3.7 percentage points. While short-term performance has been weak, on a YTD basis, 81.42% of S&amp;P 500 stocks are up on the year, and the overall average gain is 18.90%. Of the stocks that have rallied 10%+ in September, more than half are from the Energy sector and another three come from the Financials sector.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/over-ten-percent-updates.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Q3 Asset Class Performance\n\n&gt; Q3 and the month of September are now in the books, and it was not a great period for US equities. As shown in our asset class performance matrix below, the sole portion of the US equity market that was higher in September was Energy stocks. Every other sector, theme, and major index was lower on the month. As for global equities, performance was more mixed with declines ranging from 11.73% for Brazil (EWZ) to a 3.55% gain for Russia, though, most country ETFs were lower on the month.\n\n&gt; Commodities had a good month particularly in the energy space with crude oil (USO) gaining 9.41% and Natural Gas (UNG) rising an astounding 31.59%. That lifted the total gain in Q3 to 54.13% while it has returned almost 120% year to date; the best performer for both time periods. Precious metals, namely silver (SLV), on the other hand, was hit particularly hard. As for cryptos, Ethereum (ETHE) was another top performer YTD and in Q3, but September pared those gains. ETHE fell 13.62% in September while Bitcoin (GBTC) also fell by double-digit percentages.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/acpm093021.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Could There Be An October Crash?\n\n&gt; \u201cOctober: This is one of the peculiarly dangerous months to speculate in stocks. The others are July, January, September, April, November, May, March, June, December, August and February.\u201d Mark Twain\n\n&gt; Well, it was bound to end eventually, but the S&amp;P 500 Index will finish September in the red, ending an incredible seven month win streak. As we noted last month, these long win streaks actually tend to be quite bullish for future returns, with the S&amp;P 500 higher six months later 13 out of 14 times. Yes, stocks were down some in September, but this still bodes well for the near-term.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/9.30.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Speaking of the near term, here comes October. As Marc Twain explained many years ago, October has long been a source of anxiety for stock investors. \u201cOctober is known for some spectacular crashes and many expect bad things to happen again this year. 1929, 1987, and 2008 all come to mind when we think about this month,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cBut the truth is this month is simply misunderstood, as historically it is about an average month.\u201d\n\n&gt; As the LPL Chart of the Day shows, since 1950, October ranks as the 7th best month, while the past 10 and 20 years it ranks as the 4th best month. In a post-election year it comes in 5th. So October clearly isn\u2019t one of the best months of the year, but by no means is it the worst either.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/9.30.21-Blog-Chart-1-v2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Now, let\u2019s be very clear though, October is known for volatility. No month has seen more 1% moves (up or down) than October, with some of the largest 1-day moves (both up and down) taking place this month. Heck, the S&amp;P 500 hasn\u2019t had a 5% pullback all year (the average year sees about three) and the last one was nearly a full year ago, one of the longest such streaks ever. Not to mention the S&amp;P 500 has now gone an incredible 317 trading days in a row above its 200-day moving average, one of the longest streaks ever. What we are getting at is a 5-7% pullback could potentially come at any time given we haven\u2019t had one in so long.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/9.30.21-Blog-Chart-3.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Here are some other interesting statistics to think about regarding the S&amp;P 500 in October.\n&gt; * It has been 21 years (2000) since October didn\u2019t close at least up or down 1%. Several percent moves up or down are quite common for this month in other words.\n&gt; * For six years in a row October has alternated between higher and lower. Given 2020 it was in the red, it could be time for a bounce in 2021. (More on this below)\n&gt; * The last two times the S&amp;P 500 was up more than 15% year-to-date heading into October, stocks gained each time (2013 and 2019).\n&gt; * The author\u2019s birthday is on October 28, one of the historically most bullish days of the year. Coincidence?\n&gt; It turns out stocks don\u2019t like politics much. The S&amp;P 500 performs much better in odd numbered years than even years. Remember, even numbered years have elections and midterms in November. Some pre-election jitters makes sense to us, which could bode well for 2021.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/9.30.21-Blog-Chart-4.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Don\u2019t forget the fourth quarter is historically the best for stocks, with the third quarter the worst. Stocks rise 3.8% on average during the fourth quarter, but the past seven times the S&amp;P 500 was up 15% year-to-date heading into the home stretch of the year, the fourth quarter was higher every single time, up a very impressive 5.8%. In other words, should there be any October scares, investors may want to use the weakness as an opportunity to add to core positions.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/9.30.21-Blog-Chart-5.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Four Charts That Signal the Reopening Trade May Be Back\n\n&gt; Stocks have come a long way since the S&amp;P 500 bear market low way back on March 23, 2020, but despite the general strength of the bull market we\u2019ve seen two very different types of trades leading markets at different times. They include a \u201cwork-from-home\u201d trade characterized by strength among large caps and growth-style oriented stocks, strong performance by U.S. stocks in particular, and well contained interest rates. At other times, we\u2019ve seen a \u201creopening trade,\u201d where mid- and small-cap stocks have performed well, cyclically-oriented value-style stocks have led, interest rates have pressed higher, and performance across geographical regions has been more even. For most of the last six months the work-from-home trade has dominated, but we\u2019re seeing some signs of potential rotation toward a reopening theme once again.\n\n&gt; \u201cIt\u2019s increasingly looking like the Delta-related surge in COVID-19 cases, while still dangerous, has passed its peak, and there are signals that markets may be anticipating the next stage of economic reopening,\u201d said LPL Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cAfter a mid-summer head fake, we\u2019re seeing signs that this time the rotation might stick.\u201d\n\n&gt; It all starts with interest rates. The 10-year Treasury yield started to stabilize in early August, and since then we\u2019ve seen steady movement higher as elevated inflation looks increasingly sticky in the near term, and markets start to anticipate global central bankers slowly winding down extraordinarily supportive monetary policy. The full transition to neutral policy will likely take years, and central banks will remain supportive for some time, but the change in direction does matter. Seeing the 10-year yield move higher despite stock losses on Tuesday may be a telling sign.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/9.29.21-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; A higher 10-year Treasury yield has supported financial sector stocks, which are the largest sector in the Russell 1000 Value Index. The breakout in relative strength compared to the August peak may signal a more sustainable change in direction this time.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/9.29.21-Blog-Chart-3.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; It\u2019s still too early to call a reversal by value-style stocks overall, but financial sector strength helps. Rising interest rates also tend to increase the value of near-term earnings over less visible long-term earnings growth, which may also give value stocks an edge. While there are some signs of a reversal higher in the value trade, what we\u2019ve seen so far isn\u2019t persuasive in isolation. But added to the broader market signals, we see potential for further relative strength, particularly for cyclical value sectors.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/9.29.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; The relative strength of small caps looks more robust, breaking out to the upside after treading water for several months. Small caps went through a stretch of extraordinarily strong performance between September 2020 and March 2021, and it\u2019s not completely surprising that they gave back a good share of those gains after coming so far so fast, but we still think the economic environment is likely to be supportive for small- and mid-caps compared to large.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/9.29.21-Blog-Chart-4.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; We\u2019ve been anticipating a rotation back to the reopening trade for some time. If you look at the charts there\u2019s really been relative stability between the two themes since mid-July, but the last few weeks have provided solid signals of a potential reversal. With the latest surge in COVID-19 cases likely past peak, vaccination rates slowly rising, and economic surprises starting to come back into balance after a series of disappointments, it\u2019s no surprise to see the shift toward the reopening theme.\n\n&gt; But there are some potential economic negatives that support this trade as well, such as high commodity prices, higher interest rates, and growing risk of stickier inflation. Nevertheless, we think the fundamental backdrop for equities remains positive on the whole, and we continue to recommend modest overweights to equities while leaning into cyclically-oriented value sectors and tilting away from large caps.\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending October 1st, 2021** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjeZAwI8RDU))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 10.3.21**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED.)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * (**T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.**)\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!]())**\n(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!]())**\n(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 10.4.21 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 10.4.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/cF0CbQE.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday  10.5.21 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/D4dB9sd.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 10.5.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/jDBI2Dv.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 10.6.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/qVRtzZv.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 10.6.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/V7gDj4f.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 10.7.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/hZ42eSL.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 10.7.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/HNdhjgf.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 10.8.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/I2ihrfy.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 10.8.21 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # (T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n**T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)** T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.).\n\n&gt; #([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://charts.finviz.com/chart.ashx?t=SPY&amp;ty=c&amp;ta=st_c,sch_200p,sma_50,sma_200,sma_20,sma_100,bb_20_2,rsi_b_14,macd_b_12_26_9,stofu_b_14_3_3&amp;p=d&amp;s=l))\n\n*****\n\n# DISCUSS!\n\nWhat are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?\n\n*****\n\nI hope you all have a wonderful weekend and a great trading week ahead r/StockMarket. :)",

        "selftext": "We are officially in October and it is proving to be rather turbulent. Coming off of one of the worst days all year, the major indices did rebound and take back some of the losses. Today is a write up where I go through all the old alerts, push a reset, and create many new ones. \n\nIt was no surprise that we the S&amp;P had its first red month all year last month. The question is will our portfolios keep being drug down by inflation and debt ceiling woes. If you are not already, now is the time to dollar cost average on your long term positions, and pick yourself out some new mid term positions that you think will perform well in the winter months. \n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n#  First let's take a look at some of my favorites.\n\n**TQQQ** has given up a lot of ground since it's all time high on September 7th. It is now approaching the 180MA, and the RSI is really low. It could be a great time to average into this position. If you prefer options, a bounce of the 180 alerts has been set. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6ceb8y1sjqr71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3611585e424b757718c9dba3f0afefadb634c9a8\n\n **UPRO** is not as bad as **TQQQ**, and that is quite normal according to Trend Spider's seasonality. Usually this time of year, the Nasdaq does worse out of all the indices. Now we see that tech is getting hammered. I'd also DCA into this one.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vh23d1szjqr71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0a31491eb4a487f24f2f872db5e11f32ca41e89e\n\n **UDOW** is probably a great pick up right now for your buy and hold portfolio. It is riding along the 180MA, and if you can get an entry there, start to DCA.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/o66oyzrzjqr71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3dc213a55397d60bda38aba21253948b96b66579\n\n **SOXL** is notorious in our community for money printing swings. I'd say it might have bottomed out of now. There seems to be a 50/50 chance over the past decade that SOXL is up/down in October. Since it is already down, I'd say grab some, and continue to as long as it is going down. Red day buy; green day hold. Let it run until mid November. Hope you are paying attention :D \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j6vay1szjqr71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=514b94aa0482e335d9bb7f44031b54edef361497\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n#  Crypto \n\n **CRO**, the native Crypto.com token and one of my favorites right now has made a wonderful recovery bounce off of the 180MA. It is now back at 18 cents. Don't sleep on this one. They are now the sponsors of the UFC and the Philadelphia 76ers. I think this is a 10x play. I think the right play here is buy what you can afford: $400, $4000 or $40000. Stake those in their app (for up to 14%apy), since it is a long term play anyways we don't need to use this money. After, you will unlock their metal Visa card. My recommendation is run all your monthly expenses through it and you'll be getting 2-5% back in **CRO** which you continue holding.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wowtpr22kqr71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6294fca8217fde87067615877a990b4f57565db3\n\n \n\n**BTC** has made a huge recovery this week, and if you are already diversified with BTC exposure congratulate yourself. If not, maybe its time to start considering it. If traditional equity markets are not doing well, money sometimes flows to crypto - and vice versa. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4g8tbdb3kqr71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c1fcc81b846310ed2c490c7dd4498fc90d0cda68\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n#  Alerts \n\n A **WMT** opportunity found by my VIP Discord members. First of all, the seasonality improves a lot in November and the RSI looks way to over sold. I like a bounce off of the the lower support of a paralell channel that it seems to be trading in. This could be a good chance for some EOY calls either now, or wait for bounce.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qztvc4h8kqr71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=012816a5a8ba2a561beaadecb7a9fee4cc4d3b7a\n\n **XHB**, a homebuilders ETF, LEAPS look ripe for the picking. This would be a long term position with exposure to the US new homes sector, which I don't think will slow down any time soon.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d3sallk9kqr71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=09d918825aedf4ff92ceb2917309b12ba69ccba8\n\n Here is an interesting opportunity for some puts on **CRM** I believe to have found. We are close to all time high, and the seasonality starts to suck going into December. I can't really say the exact point where we buy the puts, but I think maybe around $280. We can even buy vertical spreads for $270/$260 with a December expiration. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kctpebkakqr71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e3d15a26bfe10680a774553e53c78204b3a97a3e\n\n **NKE** has also taken a beating and will probably have decent holiday sales as always. Actually, this alert was already set and expired before it triggered. It is basically riding along the 180MA and the YTD VWAP. Could be a good pick up now, or wait for a confirmation bounce.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nu6sb4jbkqr71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d8f911359729ed6031498e5aae401a786bf2ff98\n\n Same with my **HD** alert. It triggered last week but I was on vacation and missed it. If you bought, you'd be making money. I'll be resetting the alerts for a VWAP bounce and trying again.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tb2uejeckqr71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=985ad4ea1a62d29579da96945a756cc0da8a614c\n\n I'm still liking these **SPOT** puts as I don't believe in the long term growth of this company. It seems like the resistance drawn out is true and is holding. If continues, there is an opportunity to arb calls and puts between the resistance and glass bottom (yellow). \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hcie2cgdkqr71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=10f8bd58cebd73066512ce8e675a98095ac1cdae\n\n Still continue to play **DIS** on its yoyo like bounce on the glass bottom. Usually **DIS's** seasonality improves in the winter months, especially in November. I still like EOY calls, probably taking profit in November.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2lclpzaekqr71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=329098a02d6d7b241e153cb149a12cb84693ba8a\n\n It is interesting that this time, when BTC ran, **EBON** didn't. One of my highest conviction plays, I'll wait for the bounce down from the 50MA as usual. **EBON** is a crap company, with crap products, that industry insiders joke about.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ozpj252fkqr71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3bb701f35e2d14a8945e771a8787425fc8698885\n\n **MCB** is a tricky play, but, like I thought, it is holding resistance. I think its a matter of time before it pulls back. If we see it break the resistance, then I'll cut. Go small here.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vf7usk4gkqr71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d18e08d1ea0c8c33cbfbf1fc788e3566e3ec7ffb\n\n **SBUX** is around major supports and has somewhat of a nice volume shelf propping it up. Seasonality is good for October and November as cold caffeine addicted shoppers go out and need warm pick-me-uppers. I like calls off of the volume shelf expiring EOY and taking profits possibly in November.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n2lkvt0hkqr71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bfe6ac15beda08ad064d92c429436c65b943e2f0\n\n Lastly for today, I still like **T** puts off of the 50MA. Another company that I don't believe in long term growth; this is a good opportunity to continue the ride down. I would keep positions small and take profits quick, although it seems that there is more than a 50% chance that month over month is negative.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rpqh90yhkqr71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0dca69da6cd687c47ad06854a75b9fa5779f1ccd\n\n \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n    Disclaimer: The comments opinions and analysis expressed herein are for informational and educational purpose only and should not be considered as individual advice or recommendations.",

        "selftext": "Be warned **THIS IS A LONG POST** but I\u2019ll include a TLDR.\n\nI\u2019m about to present to you, what I think will be a new major player in the Indian entertainment business; QYou Media.\n\nFirst let me present the company. QYou Media is an odd mix of influencer marketing, on-demand entertainment via streaming and ad-revenue, which combined does what no other company in India is doing; trying to go full circle on ads. Yes you heard me - ads.\n\nTo do that, QYou Media is split into three divisions; one division in the US whose focus is mainly on promoting movies, games and series via influencers on TikTok. And actually, they\u2019re doing quite an impressive job at that. They've made marketing for several movies and games like \"The Croods: A New Age\", \"Resident Evil Village\" and \"Trolls World Tour\", bringing in more than 300 million views to the respective TikTok channels. This goes to show that the new generation of kids, teens and adults are spending a lot of time on their devices, which obviously helps drive advertisements as more hours spent watching equals more attention to your product and more ad-revenue.\n\nThe other two divisions are based in India, QYou India and Chtrbox. QYou India is an entertainment based division that hosts a tv-channel with a target demographic of young Indians, of which there currently are around 650 million btw. The channel, The Q, is currently free and is supported by ads - also known as a FAST-channel (free ad-supported tv).\n\nCurrently, the channel is rated at an average of 42 GRP for Q2 and Q3 of 2021, with their other nearest competitors ranked at below 12.5. That\u2019s right, The Q is vastly more popular amongst the young demographic than the other nearest youth-oriented channels. Also, 95 million households are watching The Q.\n\nFor those of you who don\u2019t know what GRP is it\u2019s a rating system kinda like the Nielsen ratings, but made by an Indian company called BARC.\n\nThe Q is currently hosting brand advertisers like Facebook, Coca Cola, Pepsi, Unilever and Amazon, but has more than 30 brands signing up with them for the past 6 months. Actually, ad-space is in such high demand for The Q, that they\u2019re having a hard time finding any available ad-space and are currently looking to expand with more channels and a more varied programme catalogue.\n\nThe last is Chtrbox which was acquired by QYou Media. Chtrbox has a catalogue of more than 300.000 influencers which will be able to help promote both The Q, but also mainly as a platform for big brands to help promote their products. And that\u2019s important as brands increasingly are looking towards influencers to help them promote their products to an ever increasing population globally. There will be no \u201cSilence, brand\u201d memes here. In fact, influencer marketing expenditure has increased year over year and is currently sitting at 13.8 billion USD globally [https://www.statista.com/statistics/1092819/global-influencer-market-size/](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1092819/global-influencer-market-size/). That trend is likely to increase by a lot. This whole phenomenon is called Social Commerce.\n\nWhy is QYou Media a good buy in my humble opinion?\n\nIndia is a huge market in many ways. Its retail market is at 792 billion USD. Yup, that\u2019s a lot. It is so large in fact, that retailers like Meesho are increasing their market cap by more than 100% on a 6 month period [https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/e-tailer-meesho-raises-570mn/articleshow/86669544.cms](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/e-tailer-meesho-raises-570mn/articleshow/86669544.cms)\n\nAnd that market is exactly what QYou Media will help promote.\n\nIn fact, money spent on ads is insane and according to Statista.com; \u201ca study of global advertising expenditures found that the ad spending in 2020 reached **586.5 billion U.S. dollars**. Forecast data indicates that the ad spending worldwide will reach 691 billion U.S. dollars by the end of 2023.\u201d [https://www.statista.com/statistics/1174981/advertising-expenditure-worldwide/](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1174981/advertising-expenditure-worldwide/)\n\nOther than that, the Indian population is consuming social media services like no other place. 10% of all youtube videos are viewed in India, Whatsapp and Facebook have their largest user base in India. Instagram has their second largest user base in India, soon to overtake their largest, the US.\n\nStill not convinced how big of a deal social media is in India? After TikTok was banned in India, new services like Chingari (which QYou partners with) is trying to fill that gap. The Q launched a 2 week contest on their Chingari channel where hopeful Indians could send in their audition tapes for a show called Jurm Ka Chehra. In that 2 week time, their channel on Chingari got 1 billion interactions and almost 50.000 audition tapes. Let that sink in. 1 billion interactions in 2 weeks.\n\nThat\u2019s what makes this so powerful.\n\nNow, let\u2019s look at the financials. QYou Media, in its current form, is 3 years old and has actively reinvested every single bit of revenue back into their company, which is a thing that won\u2019t change for the foreseeable future. That IMO is a very, very good thing. They are expecting to be cash-flow positive on their operating expenses late november this year, but will still keep investing back into the company. That means that the numbers will be red for quite a bit yet. Am I worried? No.\n\nIn Q1 2021 their revenue was around 300.000 CAD. In Q3 it was 4.700.000 CAD. This trend is predicted to continue for the next few years and their CEO and co-founder Curt Marvis is expecting around 50% growth quarter over quarter.\n\nThe fiscal report for 2021 will unfortunately not reflect the massive growth that well as the fiscal year for the company is June 30th and March 31st for India and Chtrbox. The company is considering changing the fiscal year to make it easier for investors. The report for fiscal year 2021 will hit in late October and will be from June 2020 to June 2021 \u2013 ergo, the report will not reflect on the state QYou is in right now and will not include the current revenue increase to 4.7 million USD.\n\nAlright, so who runs this thing? Well, we've got quite the cast here;\n\nCurt Marvis, CEO and co-founder - previously President Digital at Lionsgate\n\nG. Scott Paterson, co-founder and chairman - previously Director and early investor at Lionsgate\n\nLes Garland, co-founder - previously co-founder at MTV and VH1\n\nGlenn Ginsburg, President Influencer Marketing - previously VP of sales at Disney and VP at MTV\n\nAndy Kaplan, executive chairman - President at Sony Pictures\n\nThese are all seasoned people with experience from big companies. That is why I\u2019m not worried.\n\nAlso, the fact that big brands are signing deals with these guys should be a very good sign, since they\u2019d have made their DD on the company before throwing their dollaridoos at them.\n\nThere are waaaay more things about this company than what I have written up here, but I can\u2019t be bothered to write any more. This post is already long enough as it is.\n\nI\u2019d strongly recommend you watch videos on their Youtube channel and especially this one: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW84FWxjBDE&amp;t=1688s&amp;ab\\_channel=QYOUMedia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW84FWxjBDE&amp;t=1688s&amp;ab_channel=QYOUMedia)\n\nEspecially the part with a possible crypto integration into their transactional content sounds very interesting.\n\nTLDR:\n\nQYou Media is in a very good place to help expand big brands in India. They\u2019re continuously increasing their revenue, reinvesting as much back into the company as they can and are led by very experienced people from Lionsgate, Sony, MTV and Disney.\n\nTheir entertainment channel is currently being watched in 95 million households and with 300.000 influencers on their side, they will most likely be a major player in the coming years.\n\nGo watch this video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW84FWxjBDE&amp;t=1688s&amp;ab\\_channel=QYOUMedia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW84FWxjBDE&amp;t=1688s&amp;ab_channel=QYOUMedia)\n\nA disclaimer: I am invested in this company, but I couldn\u2019t care less if you choose to invest in it. This is not a recommendation to buy, I\u2019m simply sharing a company that I find very interesting. Your money, your decision.",

        "selftext": "Good Friday evening to all of you here on r/smallstreetbets. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning October 11th, 2021.\n\n# **Stock market on comeback trail heads into what\u2019s supposed to be another stellar earnings season - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/08/stock-market-on-comeback-trail-heads-into-whats-supposed-to-be-another-stellar-earnings-season-.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Stocks proved hard to keep down this week, and the start of the earnings season next week could further bolster the comeback if profits roll in as expected or better.\n*****\n&gt; The major averages notched a winning week after overcoming a debt ceiling debacle in Washington. Lawmakers passed a short-term deal that will extend the debt ceiling until December, kicking that overhang for the market down the road.\n*****\n&gt; This week\u2019s price action also overcame surging oil prices and a disappointing jobs report, with investors buying bank and energy shares.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIn the face of Washington drama, delta worries, multiyear highs in crude oil, and a much weaker than expected jobs number, you have to be impressed by how stocks were able to bounce back this week,\u201d LPL Financial chief market strategist Ryan Detrick said.\n*****\n&gt; https://i.imgur.com/Zh7JRt2.png\n*****\n&gt; A market pullback that began in September brought the S&amp;P 500 down more than 5% from its record at one point Monday, before stocks mounted a comeback. For the week, the S&amp;P 500 added back 0.8% and sits just 3.4% away from its record.\n*****\n&gt; Goldman Sachs stuck by its bullish year-end forecast earlier this week, predicting stocks would start to climb the wall of worries. And they did.\n*****\n&gt; Goldman chief U.S. equity strategist David Kostin said in a note to clients that his year-end S&amp;P 500 price target for 2021 is still 4,700, which is nearly 7% above its current level.\n*****\n&gt; The firm said earnings growth, not valuation expansion, was the primary driver of the S&amp;P 500\u2032s 17% return year to date, adding that should still be the case.\n*****\n&gt; # Earnings season begins\n&gt; The third-quarter earnings season \u2014 which kicks off next week with big bank earnings \u2014 is expected to be another strong series of reports, despite some worries about supply chain issues and higher costs. Third-quarter earnings are expected to have risen 27.6% year over year, according to FactSet. That would be the third-highest growth rate since 2010.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe\u2019ve seen some record earnings seasons the past few quarters, so all eyes will be on if earnings can help justify stocks near all-time high levels,\u201d Detrick said. \u201cWe do expect another solid earnings season, but we\u2019ve seen some high profile warnings already, so corporate America could have a rather high bar to clear this quarter. Buckle up.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Bank earnings are the main focus next week with JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Morgan Stanley, Citigroup and Goldman Sachs set to report.\n*****\n&gt; After a range-bound few months for bank stocks, analysts are looking ahead to catalysts that could fuel the next phase in their recovery. Wall Street expects loan growth, interest rates and reserve releases to play into the major banks\u2019 reports.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cEarnings for the third quarter quarter should again be strong and mostly outpace expectations,\u201d Leuthold Group chief investment strategist Jim Paulsen said. \u201cHours worked in the third quarter rose by about 5% suggesting real GDP for the quarter may be close to 7%. With most companies reporting strong pricing power, solid real GDP growth should result in another surprisingly strong corporate earnings season.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Paulsen sees earnings season rewarding cyclicals, like banks, and small caps more than technology stocks.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think the stock market is already showing signs of a leadership shift away from slow economic growth favorites including growth, tech, and defensive toward more the economically sensitive areas of small caps and cyclical sectors,\u201d he added.\n*****\n&gt; # Supply chain, higher cost warnings?\nWhile the earnings season should be strong, there are likely to be some warning signs about inflation and supply constraints that could scare the market about the year-end set-up.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe risks of higher inflation, Fed tapering and what will likely be a choppy earnings season are still with us,\u201d Bleakley Advisory Group chief investment officer Peter Boockvar said.\n*****\n&gt; There was some foreshadowing of this last week, when Bed Bath and Beyond shares cratered 25% after the company said it saw a steep drop-off in traffic in August. Bed Bath &amp; Beyond saw inflation costs escalating over the summer months, especially toward the end of its second quarter in August, which corroded profits.\n*****\n&gt; What investors know going into the third quarter \u2014 from company guidance \u2014 is that there could be haves and have nots this earnings season.\n*****\n&gt; FactSet data shows that 47 S&amp;P 500 companies have issued negative earnings guidance for the third quarter, and 56 companies have issued positive outlooks.\n*****\n&gt; # Fed headwind ahead?\n&gt; The headline jobs number Friday was a major disappointment, as the economy added just 194,000 jobs in September, well below the the Dow Jones estimate of 500,000. On the positive side, the unemployment rate fell to a much lower point than economists forecast. At 4.8%, that\u2019s the same level seen in late 2016.\n*****\n&gt; It\u2019s unclear if the number changes the calculus for when and how fast the Federal Reserve will slow its $120 billion-per-month bond-buying program.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIn our view these figures are good enough, and when combined with the debt-ceiling can being kicked down the road, likely solidifies November as \u2018go time\u2019 for tapering,\u201d Wells Fargo Securities senior equity analyst Christopher Harvey said.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe continue to expect a choppy equity market rally and a two-to-four-week tech bounce, but the bounce probably peters out next month when the Fed says those magical words: We will begin to taper,\u201d he added.\n\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/WuOc7cb.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE S&amp;P SECTORS FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/HnJ6ZF2.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/CojntqX.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/mxZnyBJ.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/eZbwxOb.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/JPCsx2m.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/kyfY7Xn.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/zEMv32q.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/uaj9G7t.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!]())**\n(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/VAaeJ4E.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/fgsZNEH.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/W5HmLSK.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/DDVPGco.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Best and Worst Performing S&amp;P 500 Stocks in 2021\n\n&gt; The fourth quarter is now off to the races and we thought it worthwhile to check in on the best and worst-performing S&amp;P 500 stocks on a year-to-date basis. As shown below, there are currently six members of the index that have rallied over 100% this year. Apt for the year that its vaccine has rolled out, the biggest gainer of these has been Moderna (MRNA) with a 196.12% rally. It now has a market cap of $124.87 billion versus a market cap of only $41 billion at the start of the year. Of the 20 best performers, MRNA is also the only one with a market cap above $100 billion. The next largest is ConocoPhillips (COP) with a $95.76 billion market cap. COP is one of multiple Energy stocks on this list as well. Of the top 20 performers, Energy sector names dominate the list with 8 members.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/100821-SPX-1.png))**\n\n&gt; Pivoting to the other end of the spectrum, Las Vegas Sands (LVS) is down the most this year having been cut by 36.18%. IPG Photonics (IPGP), Lamb Weston Holdings (LW), Viatris (VTRS), MarketAxess (MKTX), and Global Payments (GPN) also have fallen by at least 25%. Once again, there is only one member of this list with a market cap above $100 billion: Qualcomm (QCOM). One other interesting factor to note of the worst performers is there are several stocks that were at some point plays on pandemic trends, whether those be reopening or stay at home. For example, in addition to LVS, another gaming/reopening name, Wynn Resorts (WYNN), ranks as the eighth-worst performer YTD. Additionally, strong performers during the onset of the pandemic like Clorox (CLX), Activision Blizzard (ATVI), and Take-Two Interactive (TTWO) are all down double digits this year.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/100821-SPX-2.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Intraday Commodity Spikes\n\n&gt; Since the late spring, both silver and gold have been in steady downtrends spending much of that time below their 50-DMAs. Those downtrends remain in place, but both metals did find a short-term bottom on September 29th. While they have been rallying in the past week and a half, today each one has stalled out. From the early morning leading up to the Nonfarm Payrolls report, precious metals ramped higher with a surge immediately following the weaker than expected report. Only a couple hours after the release, gold and silver had erased a large portion of their earlier gains. In fact, silver is now 2.15% below its intraday high and gold is 1.36% below its high. For gold, in particular, that intraday reversal also marked a rejection of its 50-DMA which it\u2014as well as silver\u2014has struggled to stay above for most of the past several months.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/100821-GC-SI.png))**\n\n&gt; Crude oil is yet another commodity that is currently down off of its intraday highs, and like gold, the reversal came at a pretty interesting level. At its high Friday morning, front-month WTI futures rose above $80 for the first time since November 2014.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/100821-CL.png))**\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/100821-CL2.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # The Job Market Continues To Frustrate In September\n\n&gt; The September payroll report likely created more questions than it answered.\n\n&gt; The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics released its September employment report this morning, revealing that the domestic economy added a disappointing 194,000 jobs during the month, falling well short of Bloomberg-surveyed economists\u2019 median forecast for a gain of 500,000. This comes on the heels of a lukewarm August report, which did receive an upward revision of 131,000. Somewhat contradictory, the unemployment rate fell more than forecast to 4.8% in September, beating expectations, though that was paired with a reduced labor force participation rate of 61.6% when expectations called for an increase.\n\n&gt; \u201cThe observation window for this report likely came too soon for positive catalysts to really gain traction,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cLeisure and hospitality jobs, a proxy for economic reopening, were only marginally higher. We take this to mean Delta\u2019s waning impact will likely be more evident in October\u2019s report where we expect to see reopening momentum reassert itself.\u201d\n\n&gt; As seen in the LPL Chart of the Day, in-person segments of the labor market such as leisure and hospitality jobs grew steadily during the first half of the year when COVID-19 remained under relative control. However, the latest flare-up has dampened that trend. We expect to see renewed growth in this sector as the delta variant continues to abate.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/10.8.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; As mentioned, definitive takeaways from this report are difficult to come by due to the offsetting nature of the report. On the one hand, headline numbers came in very weak, but private payrolls, as well as manufacturing payrolls, fared better. The unemployment rate experienced a significant drop, but interpreting that number becomes muddied when considering the fact that we are already experiencing a significant worker shortage and the participation rate is declining, not increasing, as we would hope to see in a true recovery.\n\n&gt; What is more, because the observation window for the report cuts off mid-month, we cannot yet draw conclusions about the impact of school reopening and the lapsing of enhanced unemployment benefits\u2014hotly debated crosscurrents\u2014plus the aforementioned waning delta impact. Regarding the inflation debate\u2014average hourly earnings rose 0.6% month over month and 4.6% year over year. And while wages are undeniably growing and helping to fuel inflation, the data are not mix-adjusted and therefore are inflated due to the suppressed growth in the in-person, lower-wage segment of the labor market.\n\n&gt; The biggest question, though, is what this means for the Federal Reserve\u2019s (Fed) asset tapering plans. The market had all but expected the Fed to announce a tapering timeline at its next meeting coming into this report, with the caveat that Fed Chair Jerome Powell needed only to see a \u201creasonably good\u201d job report first. Whether September\u2019s surprise report has cleared that low bar or not now becomes an open question, one which the market had all but dismissed as a formality previously.\n\n&gt; Indeed, in the aftermath of the report\u2019s release Treasury markets immediately began pricing in a possible delay to any taper, and equity markets gyrated between positive and negative territory as they struggled to process whether bad news should actually be considered good news in this context. We will have to see in the coming weeks whether this report will be substantial enough to bring on the much-anticipated taper announcement, but one thing is for sure\u2014there are no gimmies in this labor market recovery.\n*****\n\n&gt; # Columbus Day Performance\n\n&gt; Columbus Day is an interesting trading day for financial markets as it is one of the few trading days of the year when the equity market is open, but the bond market is closed. This may lead investors to think that equity markets should perform positively, as investors do not have credit markets to allocate capital to on that specific day. However, looking at the S&amp;P 500's historical performance on Columbus Day over the last 25 years doesn't necessarily show a real positive bias. Columbus Day tends to act just like any other trading day. Over the last 25 years, median performance on Columbus Day has been a gain of 10 basis points (bps) with positive returns 55.6% of the time. While that's slightly higher than the median one-day gain of 7 bps for all trading days over the last 25 years, the difference isn't significant. That's not to say that Columbus Day hasn't seen some outliers, though. Who can forget in 2008, during the middle of the Financial Crisis, when the S&amp;P 500 rallied more than 11% on Columbus Day!\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/Day-of.png))**\n\n&gt; For the week of Columbus Day, the S&amp;P 500's median gain has been 0.31% with positive returns 63% of the time which also isn't extraordinary relative to average weekly returns for the S&amp;P 500 over the last 25 years. The worst Columbus Day weeks were in 1999 (-6.63%) and 2018 (-4.10%) while the best were in 1998 (+7.32%), 2002 (5.87%), and 2011 (+5.98%). Interestingly enough, in 2008, even after rallying over 11% on Columbus Day, the S&amp;P 500 finished the week up just 4.60% as it erased more than half of its gains from the holiday session.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/Week-of.png))**\n\n&gt; The table below lists the S&amp;P 500's performance leading up to and after Columbus Day for each of the last 25 years. With a decline of over 2.5% since the start of September, this year ranks as the weakest performance for the equity market since 2014.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/Columbus-Day-Table-100821.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # The Most Important Chart In The World\n\n&gt; And just like that, the calendar turned to October and volatility picked up in a big way, with three consecutive 1% moves for the S&amp;P 500 Index to start the month. As we noted in our October preview, this month gets a bad rap for being a bearish month (it isn\u2019t), but it absolutely owns the title as the most volatile month.\n\n&gt; t took nearly a full year, but the S&amp;P 500 finally had its first 5% pullback of 2021, thus ending hopes of 2021 joining 1954, 1958, 1964, 1993, 1995, and 2017 as the only years to go a full calendar year without a 5% move lower.\n\n&gt; \u201cVolatility is the price of admission,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cSure, we\u2019d all prefer stocks go straight up forever, but that isn\u2019t reality. Investors must learn to embrace and accept the eventual scares and bouts of volatility that are common even in the strongest bull markets.\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, since 1980, stocks experience a 14.2% peak-to-trough pullback on average during the year, putting the recent 5% pullback in perspective. In fact, 21 out of the past 41 years saw at least a 10% correction. Incredibly, 12 of those years finished in the green and those 12 years gained an average of 17.0%. Who could forget last year\u2019s 34% bear market and move back to up 16% by the end of the year? In other words, big pullbacks can happen even in years that see outsized gains, which is why this chart is so important for investors.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/10.6.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; The last new all-time high for the S&amp;P 500 was on September 2, but as of the end of September there were still 54 new all-time highs in 2021, the second most ever with one quarter to go. The good news? Previous years that saw a lot new highs the first three quarters usually had strong performance the final quarter.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/10.6.21-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Taking things a step further, this year the S&amp;P 500 produced one of its best ever year-to-date gains through September, up 14.7% with a quarter to go. It turns out that good starts to a year tend to resolve higher. In fact, 9 of the past 10 years the S&amp;P 500 was up at least 12.5% with a quarter to go there were further gains in the fourth quarter. As you can see below, the returns are greatly skewed due to 1987, but the median return in the final quarter of the year is an impressive 5.2% (versus the average fourth quarter return of 4.0%).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/10.6.21-Blog-Chart-3.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Performance Through Q3 And its Impact on Q4 Performance\n\n&gt; Every year, the makeup and number of sectors that outperform the S&amp;P 500 changes. This year, four sectors (Energy, Financials, Real Estate, and Communication Services) outperformed the S&amp;P 500 through the end of Q3, while last year it was only three sectors that outperformed in the first three quarters of the year (Technology, Consumer Discretionary, and Communication Services).\n\n&gt; As we all know, past performance does not indicate future performance, and in looking at sectors that have outperformed the S&amp;P 500 in the first three quarters of prior years compared to how they performed in Q4, the same holds true. The table below lists the number of sectors that outperformed and underperformed the S&amp;P 500 in the first three quarters of each year since 2000 and then shows their median performance during Q4 of the same year. Looking at a summary of the annual results, it's almost a coinflip as to whether or not the leading sectors in the first three quarters of a given year will continue to outperform in Q4. On average, the sectors that outperform YTD through 9/30 have averaged a Q4 gain of 3.58% (median: +6.40%) with positive returns 76% of the time. Sectors that lag the S&amp;P 500 in the first three quarters of the year average a rest of year gain of 3.67% (median: 5.95%) with gains 71% of the time. While the term 'strength begets strength' has historically been applicable to the broader market, at the sector level, buying the YTD winners (or losers) ahead of Q4 in expectation of continued momentum to close out the year (or a mean reversion bounce) hasn't offered any material outperformance.\n\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/Snap227.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Typical October Trading: Volatile Start Sets Up Rally through Month\u2019s End\n\n&gt; Over the last twenty-one years, the full month of October has been a solid month for the market. DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ, Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 have all recorded gains ranging from 0.6% by Russell 2000 to 1.9% by NASDAQ. But these gains have come with volatile trading, most notably during the early days of the month. October has opened softly with mild gains on its first trading day by DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and Russell 1000. On the second day, all five indexes have been weak followed by a rebound on the third trading day before additional weakness pulls the market lower through the seventh trading day. At which point, the market has historically found support and began to rally through mid-month and beyond.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/070f50fc0225a24692163a37694f0425/da1ccfd284e5df51-2c/s500x750/009fdcd32ca89da61f3a47401e5e5eaf71f34f50.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending October 8th, 2021** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwLj9O1yEmE))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 10.10.21**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED.)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * (**T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.**)\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!]())**\n(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!]())**\n(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES FOR THE MONTH OF OCTOBER 2021!](https://i.imgur.com/xrMCop9.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 10.11.21 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 10.11.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/cF0CbQE.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday  10.12.21 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/D4dB9sd.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 10.12.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/jDBI2Dv.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 10.13.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/qVRtzZv.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 10.13.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/V7gDj4f.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 10.14.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/hZ42eSL.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 10.14.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/HNdhjgf.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 10.15.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/I2ihrfy.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 10.15.21 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # (T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n**(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)** (T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.).\n\n&gt; #([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://charts.finviz.com/chart.ashx?t=SPY&amp;ty=c&amp;ta=st_c,sch_200p,sma_50,sma_200,sma_20,sma_100,bb_20_2,rsi_b_14,macd_b_12_26_9,stofu_b_14_3_3&amp;p=d&amp;s=l))\n\n*****\n\n# DISCUSS!\n\nWhat are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?\n\n*****\n\nI hope you all have a wonderful weekend and a great trading week ahead r/smallstreetbets. :)",

        "selftext": "Here is a comparison video to news that is coming out today from several sources that compares it to the documentary film \"The Inside Job\" from 2008. This documentary covers the events leading up to and during the financial collapse in quite some detail and is free to watch on Youtube. The comparison video is only a 11 minute watch. Here is the link:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TM4UDby1CxU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TM4UDby1CxU)\n\n\\- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nhere is a post written by [u/highquaIity](https://www.reddit.com/user/highquaIity/) \\- which covers even more similarities in detail.\n\nLet\u2019s take a trip back in time to 2008, just before one of the biggest financial crises the US has ever experienced. 4 of 7 Fed seats resigned shortly before the crisis reared its ugly head. [If you've watched Inside Job, you probably remember Fed Governor Frederic Mishkin's announcement of resignation, and the hilarious reasoning behind it.](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/other20080528a.htm) It\u2019s important to note that the vast majority of Americans were oblivious to the meltdown that was happening right in front of them.\n\nFast forward to 2021, where the Federal Reserve\u2019s monetary policy, QE infinity, has elevated financial markets to unstable levels. They are undoubtedly responsible for many of our financial problems we will soon face. In early September, 2 Fed Presidents announced that they will be selling their stocks per \u201cconflict of interests\u201d issues. [Perfect timing?](https://www.barrons.com/articles/fed-presidents-sell-stocks-perception-conflict-of-interest-51631283770) [Shortly after this announcement, the Evergrande contagion fiasco arrives, sending fear and uncertainty surging through our financial markets.](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-evergrande-shares-plummet-default-risks-2021-09-20/) What a coincidence that those Fed Presidents got out in time \ud83d\ude05.\n\nThese same Fed Presidents and one Vice Chair for Supervision, will have all departed from the Fed by October 13th. The 2 Fed Presidents recently got exposed for insider trading and announced that they were resigning. They didn\u2019t receive any punishment, they resigned \ud83e\udd29. Not only did they resign, but they resigned during a fairly turbulent period in financial markets. Sound familiar? [Perfect timing....again?](https://www.forbes.com/sites/teakvetenadze/2021/09/27/dallas-fed-president-robert-kaplan-resigns-amid-scrutiny-over-trading---hours-after-boston-colleague-steps-down/?sh=7490ecf9796a) Straight from the article: \"Rosengren made the [announcement](https://www.bostonfed.org/news-and-events/news/2021/09/rosengren-retirement.aspx) in the morning, citing health issues, while Kaplan released a [statement](https://www.dallasfed.org/news/releases/2021/nr210927kaplan.aspx) several hours later saying the \u201crecent focus\u201d on his financial disclosure risked **\u201cbecoming a distraction\u201d** for the institution.\" Kaplans statement lets me know that he genuinely believes the public is completely delusional. I unfortunately have to agree with that sentiment.\n\nAccording to the Treasury secretary, the US government is projected to run out of money by October 18th if the debt ceiling is not raised. If the debt ceiling isn\u2019t raised, the US will default for the first time in history. With an issue as big as this, one would think that it would be taken very seriously, [especially considering the fact that Congress goes on recess next week and comes back on \\*October 18th\\*](https://bgrdc.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/2021-Combined-Congressional-Calendar-BGR.pdf).\n\nInstead of behaving like responsible adults, Congress engages in blame/responsibility shifting. For whatever reason, the GOP and Democrats have to put on a show before making a decision regarding the debt ceiling. We still haven\u2019t fully recovered from the pandemic. Failure to raise the debt ceiling will cause a financial crisis that will make 2008\u2019s look minuscule. With this in mind, Fed members are heading out of the door, seemingly just moments before an enormous economic downturn.\n\nI can\u2019t help but feel like the vast majority of the US is sleepwalking into potentially the biggest financial crisis we've seen. Although we are prepared for it, I wish that other people would focus on these matters that are actually important, rather than focusing on trivial matters, such as celebrities lives. **You don't need to be a rocket scientist to see that something is brewing, the writing is on the wall.**",

Some of the value of failing passes through to option prices: when failing is cheaper than borrowing, the relation between borrowing costs and option prices is significantly weaker. The remaining value is profit to the market maker, and its ability to profit despite the usual competition between market makers appears to result from a cost advantage of larger market makers at failing.\\*\\*\\*\\***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is important-  Read this:\n\n**(hUh WuT mEaN? :   It's basically saying shorts often chose not to deliver based off the Cost to Borrow price but still short.

They are saying at times, that they will just chose to Fail to Deliver on top of borrowing shorts. Sometimes both. Basically shorts and Maker Makers have built naked shorting and choosing to Fail to Deliver into their business models.   Sometimes, its more cost effective to just wait so they eat the FTD fine and then just cover when the stock is lower.   It's another layer they have of power. Then on top of that Market Makers have the ability to drop the price through Short Exempt status where they don't have to follow any of the rules that shorts do. )**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://www.sec.gov/comments/4-520/4520-6.pdf](https://www.sec.gov/comments/4-520/4520-6.pdf)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# ****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************\n\n# \n\n# \n\n# Max Pain\n\n# \n\nLet me explain. Aterian's option chain for Oct 15th has a huge amount of options from $10 on up for the Call side and a bunch $10 and below on the Put side. Max Pain Theory is the theory that Market Makers want to pin the price to wherever the maximum amount of people will lose money.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# ***Guess where Max Pain is??? $10 or now slightly below\n\n# ==========================================================================================================\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**IMPORTANT\\*\\*\\*So if a Market Maker wants to try to fuck as many people over, they will attempt to pin the price right around $10 for ATER (Granted this target is always moving but at this point, that is where it is). What they will do is run the price up high so bullish options traders thinking its going to moon so they start buying 12.5, 15, 20, 30 strikes. Then they will run the stock super low to draw in the bears getting them to buy 7.5 puts, 5 puts, etc.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen they pin the price to where it fucks over the max amount of options players.

ATER should have had a ton more buying pressure when we were pushing pushing up but it was easily pushed down with a small amount of short interest. That shows me a lot.

So it's cheaper for them to pin the price to max pain than allow the stock to run because they most likely don't have or might not have the ability to provide those shares. Which would cause more buying pressure because they would have to go to the market and buy more shares.....which puts more shares ITM which is what a Gamma Squeeze is.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou want to see the amount of FTD's spike hard??

Before reading, **please note that I am not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice. These plays are extremely risky and you should consult a financial advisor or do your own research before making financial decisions.** \n\nQuick note: my track record is that I called out IRNT (I didn't discover it but I called it out before it happened) and RKLY. I have also been a part of and profited from many other squeezes, so I understand how squeezes work and am knowledgeable about them.\n\n# 1. The anatomy of a gamma squeeze\n\nI'll put it plain and simple, reddit absolutely sucks at finding and playing gamma squeezes. For every gain porn post you see, there are hundreds of bag holders (more on why that is later). In this section, I will explain the anatomy of a gamma squeeze and how to actually spot one. There are two components of a gamma squeeze: 1. unusually high call open interest for ATM and near the money call options on the closest expiry and 2. a technical setup that would allow for a breakout move in the near future. \n\nWhy are those the two keys? The first one should be obvious, as you need high call OI for a gamma squeeze to happen. The reason for this is because of market maker delta hedging. Market makers are constantly buying and selling shares based on the delta of the calls they sell. The reason for this is because they need to remain market neutral for conflict of interest purposes and portfolio strategy purposes (they are delta neutral, long theta, and short vega, which is why they make their money when IV decreases and theta eats away at option premium values). Gamma is the rate of change of delta. Gamma is the highest in the strike immediately above and the strike immediately below the current price. This means that when a stock makes a strong move upward, market makers have to buy the most shares to hedge due to these near the money options because their gamma increases delta at the highest rate. The point of a gamma squeeze is that when a stock with unusually high ATM and near the money call open interest makes an aggressively move upward, the option gamma rapidly increases delta for the huge amount of options, so market makers must buy tons of shares to remain delta neutral, which further pushes up the stock. Most of you probably already understand this concept as it has been widely talked about.\n\nWhat most people don't seem to understand is how to identify the second part of a gamma squeeze setup. Most people are good at identifying when a stock has unusually high call OI, but the second crucial aspect is a technical setup that would allow for a breakout move in the near future. This is important because a gamma squeeze can only happen if a stock's price increases thus increasing delta and forcing delta hedging. A stock could have a perfect gamma squeeze setup on the option chain but if it doesn't move upward, there will be no gamma squeeze because gamma won't increase delta. That's why the technical setup is so important. Just a note, but many gamma squeezes have happened due to good option OI stats and random good news pushing up the stock and causing a gamma squeeze. Since that is random and unpredictable, a technical setup is the next best thing because we can predict it with more certainty. \n\nThe technical setup part is pretty easy once you understand why it's necessary. You are usually looking for something like a bounce off an upcoming support, a wedge, triangle, or bull flag being formed, or some other consolidation setup where a bullish breakout is possible in the near future. Additionally, an upcoming catalyst or event could suffice. \n\n# 2. Why Reddit holds the bag and sucks at squeezes\n\nI am going to put it plain and simple again: Reddit/retail absolutely sucks at playing squeezes. First, most don't understand the second part of the gamma squeeze (the technical setup) and simply look for high call OI plays, which can be successful, but is far less probable than one with a technical setup. Second, for some reason that I still don't understand, reddit/retail refuses to enter squeeze plays until after they have already happened. In both my IRNT and RKLY posts, so many people said I was completely wrong and retarded (which is fair). However, when those plays squeezed the next day, some of those same people messaged me days later asking if the squeeze was still happening. This is why people hold the bag - they refuse to buy before the squeeze starts and then FOMO into plays that are already dead. Retail traders have it hard enough with all of the disadvantages facing us in financial markets, but FOMO retardation is an unacceptable cardinal sin.\n\nNext, everyone on reddit has ADHD. Someone made a post a few days ago about why reddit sucks at squeezing and noted that it takes weeks for short squeezes to happen and reddit keeps falling for pump and dumps because they can't stay in one play for more than a few days. I completely agree with this. With that being said, I'm going to assert that 99% of plays on reddit have been gamma squeezes or pump and dumps. The only plays that were short squeezes were AMC and GME and that's because they have cult followings who were willing to hold for months (these stocks also had gamma squeeze elements so it wasn't a pure short squeeze). With that being said, gamma squeezes are perfect for reddit because they don't take a long time to happen. If the call OI is there, it only takes a strong move upward for the squeeze to happen. With short squeezes, large institutions won't be margin called until they are down 100's of percent for weeks at a time.\n\n# 3. ATER's coming gamma squeeze and why it could be violent\n\nSo far I have explained to you the two necessities for gamma squeeze plays. I have also explained to you why gamma squeezes are good plays for ADHD redditors. Finally, I have explained to you why redditors often hold the bag even though they shouldn't be. With that being said, I am here to tell you of an opportunity that checks off both of the gamma squeeze boxes, hasn't taken off yet, and has strong name recognition among retail: ATER. \n\n**Option Chain and Gamma Analysis**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3htbafht4pr71.png?width=2294&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=36f4038281f0a8f09e861a49add518f9fa4e68e4\n\nFirst, we have the option chain. As you can see, $10 is an absolutely crucial strike as the OI is over 10,000. Additionally, there is a gamma ramp all the way up to the $20 strike (as evident by the insanely high OI in those strikes). The total OI for the $10 - $20 chain is over 75,000 total contracts (this would be equal to 7,500,000 if all contracts were exercised. Notice the gamma for the 10, 12,5, and 15 strikes are all above .065. This means that a $1 increase in the price of the stock would create a .10 increase in delta (for the $10 strike). A .10 increase would mean that 10 shares would need to be bought for the market maker to remain delta neutral, which means that a $1 move upward in the stock would force market makers to buy over 100,000 shares to remain delta neutral only for the $10 strike. You can imagine what happens as price keeps going up and gamma keeps increasing delta exponentially. The fact that call volume for those strikes starkly outweighs put volume is further bullish AND because market makers constantly (and often automatically through algorithms) delta hedge, a stark move upwards would cause market makers who were short puts to cover their short shares (used to delta hedge puts) thus causing further upward pressure. \n\nBelow I have used Thinkorswim's OnDemand feature to look back at the option chain for the closest strike before each of the previous moves up. \n\nFirst, this is the option chain on September 30 when the stock was about $9. This is just to compare it to now. As you can see, option OI has steadily been going up.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u26g0tjo6pr71.png?width=2314&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1ec258c128c0e9fd6230f2cc213b1af0ad97c099\n\nNext, the option chain for September 20, which is right after the first price jump and before the second one. The stock was trading at around $20. You can see that option OI was still pretty strong (though 25 days to expiry is kinda far out) but not nearly as strong as it is now. Despite this, the stock still made yet another move up to almost $20.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n92fo9407pr71.png?width=2306&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=533ea72b558e02548e99eb0d2abeb6e7335d3f41\n\nFinally, we have the option chain from Sept 8 when the stock was trading at $8. This was before the giant squeeze up to $19 (the very first one). Notice a similar setup to now? High ATM and near the money call OI. The biggest difference? There's no gamma ramp here unlike what we have now. Overall option OI is also lower than what we currently have.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m1fto2s97pr71.png?width=2304&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=974976a930440ef4841d8c683a139afc200e4ad6\n\nWhat these images should show you is that ATER's option chain has pretty definitive characteristics before each gamma squeeze and that the current setup is by far the strongest. \n\nFinally, I have the put/call ratio for today and overall. As you can see, calls are dominating puts.\n\n[Total](https://preview.redd.it/f93eshgi8pr71.png?width=1202&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4c0808a187954a3c5e8269b727a7c82567869802)\n\n[today](https://preview.redd.it/gyznkggi8pr71.png?width=2258&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=41694177fe317565c701ef229e1fbdbf2b26f094)\n\n**Technical Setup**\n\nNow that you've seen the options chain setup, it's time for the technical setup. Remember the technical setup is crucial because it is what allows gamma to start to affect delta. Think of the technical setup as the push to get up on the gamma ramp. We are currently not on the gamma ramp, but the technical setup is what would push us up to it. \n\nBelow are the 5m, 90m, and 1D charts for ATER:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hjt2urbb9pr71.png?width=786&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=028fad76867a98502732fd5243beb007fde82296\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fs19cc8c9pr71.png?width=2162&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d00b085e993ab135f2f650d0b1f1d1b09321d177\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gvermqwjbpr71.png?width=2156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=83f054ca3c1ba6f0e0aaee7d52dc213bc97f8a9f\n\nYou'll notice that the technical setup here is absolutely clear. The \\~$9.50 level is a very strong support. On the day chart and 90 min chart, you'll notice that the stock bounced off of it twice. The support even survived the recent market turmoil, which is a strong statement. Each time that the stock reaches the support level, volume dries up, which shows that it is again a very strong support. Finally, you can clearly see the triangle pattern emerging on both the 90m and 5m charts. Both of these charts show that the triangle is going to end in the next few days. Here is what a triangle pattern like this typically does.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/inju9k1x9pr71.png?width=914&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=915f8f96758b45bddf9bfca9c99c61b2a6483f68\n\nIf the triangle breaks out in a bullish way, then it means that the stock will go to AT LEAST $12 (without considering gamma). Once the stock reaches above $11, IMO, gamma will take over and send the stock up further to at least the $18 level and possibly above the previous two highs. Like I said, the technical setup is what pushes us up to allow gamma to take over, and this is a very strong technical setup. Since we keep respecting the 9.5 level, I would say it's very likely that we break out. I have been playing this stock for the past few weeks and IMO it is blatantly clear that this is a continuation of the previous jumps: bounce off of support, low volume on support, and strong call OI - I've seen it before and I'm currently seeing it now. That's why I'm saying this is an opportunity to get in on a squeeze play before it squeezes so you aren't holding the bag for the 5349239120 time. \n\n**Other stuff**\n\nI could go over the fact that the borrow fee on the stock is high, available shares are drying up, something about float, something about short interest, something with ortex signals, but I'm not going to do that because it's all just noise. This is not a short squeeze play. Most reddit plays are not short squeeze plays, so those stats do not matter even close to as much as the gamma setup and the technical setup. \n\nPlease see the note at the beginning about the risks involved with plays like this, doing your own research, etc.\n\n**This is not financial advice trade at your own risk.**",

That\u2019s about two-thirds of the total number of AI startups worldwide, as estimated by Pitchbook. With total cumulative funding of over $60 billion and members in 90 countries, NVIDIA Inception is one of the largest AI startup ecosystems in the world. \n\n In terms of industries, healthcare, IT services, intelligent video analytics (IVA), media and entertainment (M&amp;E) and robotics are the top five in NVIDIA Inception. \n\n The dominant segment within IT services is computer vision at 27 percent, with predictive analytics in second place at 9 percent. The top two segments in healthcare are medical analytics at 38 percent and medical imaging at 36 percent.\n\nCollaboration has been underway for over a year to leverage the powerful edge AI advantages\u00a0 of the [NVIDIA\u00ae Jetson\u2122 platform](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded-computing) with NexOptic\u2019s next-generation ALIIS*\u2122.* \n\n[https://nexoptic.com/news/nexoptic-joins-nvidia-partner-program/](https://nexoptic.com/news/nexoptic-joins-nvidia-partner-program/)\n\nAnd, earlier this year NexOptic announced that they have entered into an exclusive partnership to deploy NexOptic\u2019s artificial intelligence (AI) powered imaging technology in Pristine\u2019s single-use endoscopic visualization platform. \n\n[https://nexoptic.com/news/pristine-surgical-adopts-aliis/](https://nexoptic.com/news/pristine-surgical-adopts-aliis/)\n\nThese new devices from Pristine Surgical should be hitting the market any day now. Rich Geruson indicated in the Arm webinar that Pristine Surgical will probable explode with this new device, and that this is just the tip of the iceberg for ALIIS.\n\nNexOptic\u2019s AI team recently demonstrated to NVidia\u2019s partners and customers NexOptic\u2019s Aliis intelligent imaging solution on the newly released NVIDIA Jetson Xavier NX, and showed how the next generation of IP cameras are going to need to seriously consider compute if they want to compete. They outlined, to NVIDIA\u2019s customers, how the humble task of noise reduction has significant implications for data transmission and storage, and perhaps more importantly for any downstream AI applications that depend on computer vision.\n\n[https://nexoptic.com/events/](https://nexoptic.com/events/)\n\nALIIS\u2122 is the modern solution for today\u2019s imaging challenges. It\u2019s ready to support global clients that demand the best in, \u201cat the edge,\u201d optical AI.\n\nNexOptic\u2019s ALIIS solution powered by NVIDIA Jetson Edge AI platform can unlock new application paths in robotics, smart cities, industrial automation, and healthcare.\n\nUsing the high compute, memory, and floating-point capabilities of the Jetson platform, NexOptic\u2019s state-of-the-art image enhancing algorithms can run very fast inferencing to handle complex image to image tasks and optimize storage and streaming performance.\n\nALIIS expands the NVIDIA Jetson\u2019s offerings for autonomous machines by providing a suite of intelligent imaging solutions geared for the edge. NexOptic has partnered with NVIDIA to officially support ALIIS on the NVIDIA Jetson platform.\n\n* Accelerated compute capabilities\n* Official access to the latest ALIIS SDK on Jetson\n* Turnkey SoC platform for industry integration\n* Reduced power consumption\n* Compact and focused form factor\n\nALIIS on Jetson unlocks NexOptic\u2019s AI-based imaging enhancements for a wide variety of markets and applications. With ALIIS on board, Jetson provides the ideal platform for high-performance embedded systems.\n\n[https://nexoptic.com/jetson/](https://nexoptic.com/jetson/)\n\n The U.S. Department of Defense revealed plans to develop a portfolio of medical imaging AI solutions, combining its massive / diverse imaging datasets with \u201cthe best of commercially available artificial intelligence technology.\u201d This story hasn\u2019t received much coverage, but this is technically one of the world\u2019s largest and most technologically advanced healthcare systems making a push into imaging AI. \n\n Given the military\u2019s unique resources (huge &amp; diverse datasets, advanced tech, tons of funding), this initiative could bring major advancements in imaging AI science and adoption. \n\n Rich Geruson has been saying that there are multiple market segments where ALIIS will shine from ***military***, drones, IoT, AR and VR, security, mobile phones, medical, robotics, industrial automation, etc.\n\nSlideshow overview of ALIIS...\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6s\\_Msl\\_vsNI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6s_Msl_vsNI)\n\nLots of news and updates have been coming out on NexOptic's progress over the past few weeks and we can expect that to continue as we get closer and closer to commercialization.\n\n[https://nexoptic.com/news/](https://nexoptic.com/news/)\n\nWill be interesting to see what is revealed at the Nvidia AI conference coming up in November...\n\n[https://www.nvidia.com/gtc/?nvid=nv-int-bnr-416104](https://www.nvidia.com/gtc/?nvid=nv-int-bnr-416104)",

Reed*  Submitted to the SEC  (May 25th, 2006)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*Regulations allow market makers to short sell without borrowing stock, and the transactions of a major options market maker show that in most hard-to-borrow situations, it chooses not to borrow and instead fails to deliver stock to its buyers. Some of the value of failing passes through to option prices: when failing is cheaper than borrowing, the relation between borrowing costs and option prices is significantly weaker. The remaining value is profit to the market maker, and its ability to profit despite the usual competition between market makers appears to result from a cost advantage of larger market makers at failing.\\*\\*\\*\\***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is important-  Read this:\n\n**(hUh WuT mEaN? :   It's basically saying shorts often chose not to deliver based off the Cost to Borrow price but still short. Everyone in retail thinks that when shorts are out of shares on Ortex or fintel, they can't drop the price. This is saying the opposite. They are saying at times, that they will just chose to Fail to Deliver on top of borrowing shorts. Sometimes both. Basically shorts and Maker Makers have built naked shorting and choosing to Fail to Deliver into their business models.   Sometimes, its more cost effective to just wait so they eat the FTD fine and then just cover when the stock is lower.   It's another layer they have of power. Then on top of that Market Makers have the ability to drop the price through Short Exempt status where they don't have to follow any of the rules that shorts do. )**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://www.sec.gov/comments/4-520/4520-6.pdf](https://www.sec.gov/comments/4-520/4520-6.pdf)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# ****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************\n\n# \n\n# \n\n# Max Pain\n\n# \n\nLet me explain.

ATER should have had a ton more buying pressure when we were pushing pushing up but it was easily pushed down with a small amount of short interest. That shows me a lot.

So it's cheaper for them to pin the price to max pain than allow the stock to run because they most likely don't have or might not have the ability to provide those shares.

Before reading, **please note that I am not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice. These plays are extremely risky and you should consult a financial advisor or do your own research before making financial decisions.** \n\nQuick note: my track record is that I called out IRNT (I didn't discover it but I called it out before it happened) and RKLY. I have also been a part of and profited from many other squeezes, so I understand how squeezes work and am knowledgeable about them.\n\n# 1. The anatomy of a gamma squeeze\n\nI'll put it plain and simple, reddit absolutely sucks at finding and playing gamma squeezes. For every gain porn post you see, there are hundreds of bag holders (more on why that is later). In this section, I will explain the anatomy of a gamma squeeze and how to actually spot one. There are two components of a gamma squeeze: 1. unusually high call open interest for ATM and near the money call options on the closest expiry and 2. a technical setup that would allow for a breakout move in the near future. \n\nWhy are those the two keys? The first one should be obvious, as you need high call OI for a gamma squeeze to happen. The reason for this is because of market maker delta hedging. Market makers are constantly buying and selling shares based on the delta of the calls they sell. The reason for this is because they need to remain market neutral for conflict of interest purposes and portfolio strategy purposes (they are delta neutral, long theta, and short vega, which is why they make their money when IV decreases and theta eats away at option premium values). Gamma is the rate of change of delta. Gamma is the highest in the strike immediately above and the strike immediately below the current price. This means that when a stock makes a strong move upward, market makers have to buy the most shares to hedge due to these near the money options because their gamma increases delta at the highest rate. The point of a gamma squeeze is that when a stock with unusually high ATM and near the money call open interest makes an aggressively move upward, the option gamma rapidly increases delta for the huge amount of options, so market makers must buy tons of shares to remain delta neutral, which further pushes up the stock. Most of you probably already understand this concept as it has been widely talked about.\n\nWhat most people don't seem to understand is how to identify the second part of a gamma squeeze setup. Most people are good at identifying when a stock has unusually high call OI, but the second crucial aspect is a technical setup that would allow for a breakout move in the near future. This is important because a gamma squeeze can only happen if a stock's price increases thus increasing delta and forcing delta hedging. A stock could have a perfect gamma squeeze setup on the option chain but if it doesn't move upward, there will be no gamma squeeze because gamma won't increase delta. That's why the technical setup is so important. Just a note, but many gamma squeezes have happened due to good option OI stats and random good news pushing up the stock and causing a gamma squeeze. Since that is random and unpredictable, a technical setup is the next best thing because we can predict it with more certainty. \n\nThe technical setup part is pretty easy once you understand why it's necessary. You are usually looking for something like a bounce off an upcoming support, a wedge, triangle, or bull flag being formed, or some other consolidation setup where a bullish breakout is possible in the near future. Additionally, an upcoming catalyst or event could suffice. \n\n# 2. Why Reddit holds the bag and sucks at squeezes\n\nI am going to put it plain and simple again: Reddit/retail absolutely sucks at playing squeezes. First, most don't understand the second part of the gamma squeeze (the technical setup) and simply look for high call OI plays, which can be successful, but is far less probable than one with a technical setup. Second, for some reason that I still don't understand, reddit/retail refuses to enter squeeze plays until after they have already happened. In both my IRNT and RKLY posts, so many people said I was completely wrong and retarded (which is fair). However, when those plays squeezed the next day, some of those same people messaged me days later asking if the squeeze was still happening. This is why people hold the bag - they refuse to buy before the squeeze starts and then FOMO into plays that are already dead. Retail traders have it hard enough with all of the disadvantages facing us in financial markets, but FOMO retardation is an unacceptable cardinal sin.\n\nNext, everyone on reddit has ADHD. Someone made a post a few days ago about why reddit sucks at squeezing and noted that it takes weeks for short squeezes to happen and reddit keeps falling for pump and dumps because they can't stay in one play for more than a few days. I completely agree with this. With that being said, I'm going to assert that 99% of plays on reddit have been gamma squeezes or pump and dumps. The only plays that were short squeezes were AMC and GME and that's because they have cult followings who were willing to hold for months (these stocks also had gamma squeeze elements so it wasn't a pure short squeeze). With that being said, gamma squeezes are perfect for reddit because they don't take a long time to happen. If the call OI is there, it only takes a strong move upward for the squeeze to happen. With short squeezes, large institutions won't be margin called until they are down 100's of percent for weeks at a time.\n\n# 3. ATER's coming gamma squeeze and why it could be violent\n\nSo far I have explained to you the two necessities for gamma squeeze plays. I have also explained to you why gamma squeezes are good plays for ADHD redditors. Finally, I have explained to you why redditors often hold the bag even though they shouldn't be. With that being said, I am here to tell you of an opportunity that checks off both of the gamma squeeze boxes, hasn't taken off yet, and has strong name recognition among retail: ATER. \n\n**Option Chain and Gamma Analysis**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3htbafht4pr71.png?width=2294&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=36f4038281f0a8f09e861a49add518f9fa4e68e4\n\nFirst, we have the option chain. As you can see, $10 is an absolutely crucial strike as the OI is over 10,000. Additionally, there is a gamma ramp all the way up to the $20 strike (as evident by the insanely high OI in those strikes). The total OI for the $10 - $20 chain is over 75,000 total contracts (this would be equal to 7,500,000 if all contracts were exercised. Notice the gamma for the 10, 12,5, and 15 strikes are all above .065. This means that a $1 increase in the price of the stock would create a .10 increase in delta (for the $10 strike). A .10 increase would mean that 10 shares would need to be bought for the market maker to remain delta neutral, which means that a $1 move upward in the stock would force market makers to buy over 100,000 shares to remain delta neutral only for the $10 strike. You can imagine what happens as price keeps going up and gamma keeps increasing delta exponentially. The fact that call volume for those strikes starkly outweighs put volume is further bullish AND because market makers constantly (and often automatically through algorithms) delta hedge, a stark move upwards would cause market makers who were short puts to cover their short shares (used to delta hedge puts) thus causing further upward pressure. \n\nBelow I have used Thinkorswim's OnDemand feature to look back at the option chain for the closest strike before each of the previous moves up. \n\nFirst, this is the option chain on September 30 when the stock was about $9. This is just to compare it to now. As you can see, option OI has steadily been going up.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u26g0tjo6pr71.png?width=2314&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1ec258c128c0e9fd6230f2cc213b1af0ad97c099\n\nNext, the option chain for September 20, which is right after the first price jump and before the second one. The stock was trading at around $20. You can see that option OI was still pretty strong (though 25 days to expiry is kinda far out) but not nearly as strong as it is now. Despite this, the stock still made yet another move up to almost $20.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n92fo9407pr71.png?width=2306&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=533ea72b558e02548e99eb0d2abeb6e7335d3f41\n\nFinally, we have the option chain from Sept 8 when the stock was trading at $8. This was before the giant squeeze up to $19 (the very first one). Notice a similar setup to now? High ATM and near the money call OI. The biggest difference? There's no gamma ramp here unlike what we have now. Overall option OI is also lower than what we currently have.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m1fto2s97pr71.png?width=2304&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=974976a930440ef4841d8c683a139afc200e4ad6\n\nWhat these images should show you is that ATER's option chain has pretty definitive characteristics before each gamma squeeze and that the current setup is by far the strongest. \n\nFinally, I have the put/call ratio for today and overall. As you can see, calls are dominating puts.\n\n[Total](https://preview.redd.it/f93eshgi8pr71.png?width=1202&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4c0808a187954a3c5e8269b727a7c82567869802)\n\n[today](https://preview.redd.it/gyznkggi8pr71.png?width=2258&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=41694177fe317565c701ef229e1fbdbf2b26f094)\n\n**Technical Setup**\n\nNow that you've seen the options chain setup, it's time for the technical setup. Remember the technical setup is crucial because it is what allows gamma to start to affect delta. Think of the technical setup as the push to get up on the gamma ramp. We are currently not on the gamma ramp, but the technical setup is what would push us up to it. \n\nBelow are the 5m, 90m, and 1D charts for ATER:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hjt2urbb9pr71.png?width=786&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=028fad76867a98502732fd5243beb007fde82296\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fs19cc8c9pr71.png?width=2162&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d00b085e993ab135f2f650d0b1f1d1b09321d177\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gvermqwjbpr71.png?width=2156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=83f054ca3c1ba6f0e0aaee7d52dc213bc97f8a9f\n\nYou'll notice that the technical setup here is absolutely clear. The \\~$9.50 level is a very strong support. On the day chart and 90 min chart, you'll notice that the stock bounced off of it twice. The support even survived the recent market turmoil, which is a strong statement. Each time that the stock reaches the support level, volume dries up, which shows that it is again a very strong support. Finally, you can clearly see the triangle pattern emerging on both the 90m and 5m charts. Both of these charts show that the triangle is going to end in the next few days. Here is what a triangle pattern like this typically does.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/inju9k1x9pr71.png?width=914&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=915f8f96758b45bddf9bfca9c99c61b2a6483f68\n\nIf the triangle breaks out in a bullish way, then it means that the stock will go to AT LEAST $12 (without considering gamma). Once the stock reaches above $11, IMO, gamma will take over and send the stock up further to at least the $18 level and possibly above the previous two highs. Like I said, the technical setup is what pushes us up to allow gamma to take over, and this is a very strong technical setup. Since we keep respecting the 9.5 level, I would say it's very likely that we break out. I have been playing this stock for the past few weeks and IMO it is blatantly clear that this is a continuation of the previous jumps: bounce off of support, low volume on support, and strong call OI - I've seen it before and I'm currently seeing it now. That's why I'm saying this is an opportunity to get in on a squeeze play before it squeezes so you aren't holding the bag for the 5349239120 time. \n\n**Other stuff**\n\nI could go over the fact that the borrow fee on the stock is high, available shares are drying up, something about float, something about short interest, something with ortex signals, but I'm not going to do that because it's all just noise. This is not a short squeeze play. Most reddit plays are not short squeeze plays, so those stats do not matter even close to as much as the gamma setup and the technical setup. \n\nPlease see the note at the beginning about the risks involved with plays like this, doing your own research, etc.\n\n**This is not financial advice trade at your own risk.**",

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning October 4th, 2021.\n\n# **October may have a bad reputation, but stocks are entering a normally positive period - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/01/october-may-have-a-bad-reputation-but-stocks-are-entering-a-normally-positive-period.html)**\n*****\n&gt; October may have a bad reputation, but the fourth quarter has mostly been a positive time for stocks.\n*****\n&gt; Despite worries about central bank tightening, the debt ceiling, Chinese developer Evergrande and Covid-19, many strategists expect stocks to eclipse recent highs after a rocky period in October.\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 has averaged outsized gains of 3.9% in the fourth quarter and was up four out of every five years since World War II, according to CFRA. The next best quarter is the first, with an average gain of 2.3%. The worst is the third, up just 0.6%.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cQ4 2021 will likely record a higher-than-average return. However, investors will need to hang on tight during the typically tumultuous ride in October, which saw 36% higher volatility when compared with the average for the other 11 months,\u201d notes CFRA chief investment strategist Sam Stovall.\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 eked out a small gain for the third quarter, but was down nearly 5% for the month of September, with a bad ending as the S&amp;P 500 dropped 1.2% on Thursday.\n*****\n&gt; The indexes kicked off the first trading session in October on a positive note, however. With the S&amp;P 500 adding 1.1% and the Nasdaq closing 0.8% higher on Friday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 482.54 points.\n*****\n&gt; https://i.imgur.com/FEg9jmU.png\n*****\n&gt; Bespoke Investment Group analyzed the behavior of the S&amp;P 500 in years when it was up solidly year-to-date heading into the fourth quarter. In those years, the market typically gained in the quarter, but there were weaker than normal returns in October and the quarter itself, when September was a negative month.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe S&amp;P 500 has been down in September 50 times since 1928, and in those years, it has actually averaged a decline of 0.41% in October and a gain of just 0.75% in Q4,\u201d Bespoke noted. When September\u2019s performance was positive, the S&amp;P gained a much stronger 1.6% average in October and an average 5% in the fourth quarter, according to the firm.\n*****\n&gt; Bespoke found that while October is remembered for stock market crashes, like those in 1929 and 1987, the market is usually positive. The Dow, for instance, gained 60% of the time in October over the past 50 years, averaging an increase of 0.5%. It was negative most of the time in September, with an average loss of 0.9%.\n*****\n&gt; # Jobs, jobs, jobs\n&gt; One of the first hurdles markets face in the new quarter is Friday\u2019s employment report, potentially one of the final triggers for the Federal Reserve\u2019s decision on when to taper its $120 billion-a-month bond buying program.\n*****\n&gt; Economists expect about 475,000 jobs were added in September, according to an early consensus figure from FactSet. Just 235,000 payrolls were added in August, about 500,000 less than expected.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe only way I could see them delaying the tapering is if we get a very weak number, something closer to zero,\u201d said Ethan Harris, head of global economic research at Bank of America. \u201cAnything that looks like 100,000, 200,000, they just go ahead\u201d with the taper.\n*****\n&gt; Harris said the biggest concern for the economy remains Covid, though new cases are slowing.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe big question is when does the Covid story start to fade a bit, allowing activity to come back,\u201d he said. He expects the pandemic will continue to be a big factor in the labor market in September.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe think fear of getting Covid on the job was a big factor in August and will be a factor in September as well,\u201d he said. \u201cBy October, the early hints are people are starting to feel more comfortable and you should get some beginnings of a reacceleration of job growth.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; The market got some positive news on that front on Friday with Merck\u2019s promising data for its Covid antiviral pill.\n*****\n&gt; # Central banks tightening\n&gt; A big event in the fourth quarter could be the beginning of the unwind of the Federal Reserve\u2019s easy policies.\n*****\n&gt; The central bank last week signaled it is nearly ready to take that first step away from the policies used during the pandemic to maintain financial market liquidity and help the economy.\n*****\n&gt; The Fed is widely expected to announce in November that it will start to slow its bond purchases, and Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said he expects it to finish by the middle of next year.\n*****\n&gt; Other central banks around the world are also making the same noises or actually moving to raise interest rates. Bond market pros now expect a trend toward higher interest rates.\n*****\n&gt; Just in the past week, rates shot higher, with the 10-year Treasury yield rising from about 1.31% while the Fed was meeting Sept. 22 to as high as 1.56% just a week later. On Friday, the yield eased back a bit to just under 1.50%.\n*****\n&gt; https://i.imgur.com/9dO7jZc.png\n*****\n&gt; The move toward tapering so far has not had much impact on markets, though strategists say it could if yields shoot higher. The bond buying program, or quantitative easing, was also credited with providing market liquidity, which has been fuel for stock market gains.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe Fed is trying very hard to telegraph what they are doing well in advance and take the shock out of what they\u2019re doing. Bond yields have gone up a bit but not in a way that\u2019s troubling for the economy,\u201d said Harris. \u201cThe real risk from the Fed comes when they start talking about hiking interest rates. ... That\u2019s a story for next year.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Rising yields would become more risky for stocks if they were to continue to move up rapidly. Tony Crescenzi, PIMCO executive vice president, said he expects the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield to trade in a range of 1.50% to 2% this year.\n*****\n&gt; Crescenzi said the move higher in yields has to do with more persistent inflation expectations and the Fed\u2019s persistent move toward less easy policy. \u201cIt\u2019s still marching forward with its plan to taper and eventually tighten,\u201d he said. \u201cThe taper doesn\u2019t set a date for tightening, but the clock starts ticking once the taper begins.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; The jump in rates rattled stocks in the past week, particularly tech stocks. The S&amp;P 500 was lower by 2.2% for the week and the Nasdaq shed 3.2%.\n*****\n&gt; # Surprising earnings\nEarnings have been a big catalyst for the stock market, with huge upside surprises boosting sentiment this year. But some strategists warn that if companies sound too cautious when they report third-quarter profits in the next couple of weeks, that could be a forewarning for the market.\n*****\n&gt; Julian Emanuel, head of equity and derivative strategy at BTIG, said rising earnings estimates for this year and next year have been a tailwind. \u201cThose in our view have now plateaued and potentially peaked,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the market perceived they peaked rather than plateaued on a near to medium-term basis, then we have a problem for the stock market.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Investors are also watching the supply chain issues that are disrupting many companies\u2019 ability to get parts and even products. They are already impacting earnings and pressuring margins.

The chart below provides an update through the end of September where positive readings indicate outperformance of the equal-weight S&amp;P 500 and negative readings indicate outperformance of the market cap weighted index. In March 2020, as the market was plunging from the February peak and bottoming towards the end of the month, mega-caps such as Apple (APPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), and Facebook (FB) significantly outperformed the broader market, resulting in a 5.68 percentage point spread between the return of the equally weighted and market cap weighted S&amp;P 500. Whereas the equal-weighted index declined 18.19% in March 2020, the market cap weighted index dropped 'just' 12.51%. In a reversal of these trends, the equal-weighted index outperformed between the months of September 2020 and March 2021, rallying 30.84% while its market cap weighted counterpart gained 18.14%. Over these months, there was a maximum monthly spread of 3.37 percentage points in favor of the equal-weighted index, which occurred last December. In recent months, mega-caps briefly took back the reins before the trend reversed in September when the equal-weighted index outperformed by 0.82 percentage points.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/10121-Spread.png))**\n\n&gt; With the month of September behind us, the table below lists the 18 stocks in the S&amp;P 500 that finished the month up over 10%, and less than a quarter of the stocks in the index (22%) finished the month higher. Overall, the average performance of stocks in the index was a decline of 3.7 percentage points. While short-term performance has been weak, on a YTD basis, 81.42% of S&amp;P 500 stocks are up on the year, and the overall average gain is 18.90%. Of the stocks that have rallied 10%+ in September, more than half are from the Energy sector and another three come from the Financials sector.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/over-ten-percent-updates.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Q3 Asset Class Performance\n\n&gt; Q3 and the month of September are now in the books, and it was not a great period for US equities. As shown in our asset class performance matrix below, the sole portion of the US equity market that was higher in September was Energy stocks. Every other sector, theme, and major index was lower on the month. As for global equities, performance was more mixed with declines ranging from 11.73% for Brazil (EWZ) to a 3.55% gain for Russia, though, most country ETFs were lower on the month.\n\n&gt; Commodities had a good month particularly in the energy space with crude oil (USO) gaining 9.41% and Natural Gas (UNG) rising an astounding 31.59%. That lifted the total gain in Q3 to 54.13% while it has returned almost 120% year to date; the best performer for both time periods. Precious metals, namely silver (SLV), on the other hand, was hit particularly hard. As for cryptos, Ethereum (ETHE) was another top performer YTD and in Q3, but September pared those gains. ETHE fell 13.62% in September while Bitcoin (GBTC) also fell by double-digit percentages.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/acpm093021.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Could There Be An October Crash?\n\n&gt; \u201cOctober: This is one of the peculiarly dangerous months to speculate in stocks. The others are July, January, September, April, November, May, March, June, December, August and February.\u201d Mark Twain\n\n&gt; Well, it was bound to end eventually, but the S&amp;P 500 Index will finish September in the red, ending an incredible seven month win streak. As we noted last month, these long win streaks actually tend to be quite bullish for future returns, with the S&amp;P 500 higher six months later 13 out of 14 times. Yes, stocks were down some in September, but this still bodes well for the near-term.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/9.30.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Speaking of the near term, here comes October. As Marc Twain explained many years ago, October has long been a source of anxiety for stock investors. \u201cOctober is known for some spectacular crashes and many expect bad things to happen again this year. 1929, 1987, and 2008 all come to mind when we think about this month,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cBut the truth is this month is simply misunderstood, as historically it is about an average month.\u201d\n\n&gt; As the LPL Chart of the Day shows, since 1950, October ranks as the 7th best month, while the past 10 and 20 years it ranks as the 4th best month. In a post-election year it comes in 5th. So October clearly isn\u2019t one of the best months of the year, but by no means is it the worst either.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/9.30.21-Blog-Chart-1-v2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Now, let\u2019s be very clear though, October is known for volatility. No month has seen more 1% moves (up or down) than October, with some of the largest 1-day moves (both up and down) taking place this month. Heck, the S&amp;P 500 hasn\u2019t had a 5% pullback all year (the average year sees about three) and the last one was nearly a full year ago, one of the longest such streaks ever. Not to mention the S&amp;P 500 has now gone an incredible 317 trading days in a row above its 200-day moving average, one of the longest streaks ever. What we are getting at is a 5-7% pullback could potentially come at any time given we haven\u2019t had one in so long.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/9.30.21-Blog-Chart-3.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Here are some other interesting statistics to think about regarding the S&amp;P 500 in October.\n&gt; * It has been 21 years (2000) since October didn\u2019t close at least up or down 1%. Several percent moves up or down are quite common for this month in other words.\n&gt; * For six years in a row October has alternated between higher and lower. Given 2020 it was in the red, it could be time for a bounce in 2021. (More on this below)\n&gt; * The last two times the S&amp;P 500 was up more than 15% year-to-date heading into October, stocks gained each time (2013 and 2019).\n&gt; * The author\u2019s birthday is on October 28, one of the historically most bullish days of the year. Coincidence?\n&gt; It turns out stocks don\u2019t like politics much. The S&amp;P 500 performs much better in odd numbered years than even years. Remember, even numbered years have elections and midterms in November. Some pre-election jitters makes sense to us, which could bode well for 2021.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/9.30.21-Blog-Chart-4.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Don\u2019t forget the fourth quarter is historically the best for stocks, with the third quarter the worst. Stocks rise 3.8% on average during the fourth quarter, but the past seven times the S&amp;P 500 was up 15% year-to-date heading into the home stretch of the year, the fourth quarter was higher every single time, up a very impressive 5.8%. In other words, should there be any October scares, investors may want to use the weakness as an opportunity to add to core positions.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/9.30.21-Blog-Chart-5.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Four Charts That Signal the Reopening Trade May Be Back\n\n&gt; Stocks have come a long way since the S&amp;P 500 bear market low way back on March 23, 2020, but despite the general strength of the bull market we\u2019ve seen two very different types of trades leading markets at different times. They include a \u201cwork-from-home\u201d trade characterized by strength among large caps and growth-style oriented stocks, strong performance by U.S. stocks in particular, and well contained interest rates. At other times, we\u2019ve seen a \u201creopening trade,\u201d where mid- and small-cap stocks have performed well, cyclically-oriented value-style stocks have led, interest rates have pressed higher, and performance across geographical regions has been more even. For most of the last six months the work-from-home trade has dominated, but we\u2019re seeing some signs of potential rotation toward a reopening theme once again.\n\n&gt; \u201cIt\u2019s increasingly looking like the Delta-related surge in COVID-19 cases, while still dangerous, has passed its peak, and there are signals that markets may be anticipating the next stage of economic reopening,\u201d said LPL Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cAfter a mid-summer head fake, we\u2019re seeing signs that this time the rotation might stick.\u201d\n\n&gt; It all starts with interest rates. The 10-year Treasury yield started to stabilize in early August, and since then we\u2019ve seen steady movement higher as elevated inflation looks increasingly sticky in the near term, and markets start to anticipate global central bankers slowly winding down extraordinarily supportive monetary policy. The full transition to neutral policy will likely take years, and central banks will remain supportive for some time, but the change in direction does matter. Seeing the 10-year yield move higher despite stock losses on Tuesday may be a telling sign.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/9.29.21-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; A higher 10-year Treasury yield has supported financial sector stocks, which are the largest sector in the Russell 1000 Value Index. The breakout in relative strength compared to the August peak may signal a more sustainable change in direction this time.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/9.29.21-Blog-Chart-3.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; It\u2019s still too early to call a reversal by value-style stocks overall, but financial sector strength helps. Rising interest rates also tend to increase the value of near-term earnings over less visible long-term earnings growth, which may also give value stocks an edge. While there are some signs of a reversal higher in the value trade, what we\u2019ve seen so far isn\u2019t persuasive in isolation. But added to the broader market signals, we see potential for further relative strength, particularly for cyclical value sectors.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/9.29.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; The relative strength of small caps looks more robust, breaking out to the upside after treading water for several months. Small caps went through a stretch of extraordinarily strong performance between September 2020 and March 2021, and it\u2019s not completely surprising that they gave back a good share of those gains after coming so far so fast, but we still think the economic environment is likely to be supportive for small- and mid-caps compared to large.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/9.29.21-Blog-Chart-4.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; We\u2019ve been anticipating a rotation back to the reopening trade for some time. If you look at the charts there\u2019s really been relative stability between the two themes since mid-July, but the last few weeks have provided solid signals of a potential reversal. With the latest surge in COVID-19 cases likely past peak, vaccination rates slowly rising, and economic surprises starting to come back into balance after a series of disappointments, it\u2019s no surprise to see the shift toward the reopening theme.\n\n&gt; But there are some potential economic negatives that support this trade as well, such as high commodity prices, higher interest rates, and growing risk of stickier inflation. Nevertheless, we think the fundamental backdrop for equities remains positive on the whole, and we continue to recommend modest overweights to equities while leaning into cyclically-oriented value sectors and tilting away from large caps.\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending October 1st, 2021** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjeZAwI8RDU))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 10.3.21**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED.)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * (**T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.**)\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!]())**\n(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!]())**\n(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 10.4.21 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 10.4.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/cF0CbQE.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday  10.5.21 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/D4dB9sd.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 10.5.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/jDBI2Dv.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 10.6.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/qVRtzZv.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 10.6.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/V7gDj4f.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 10.7.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/hZ42eSL.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 10.7.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/HNdhjgf.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 10.8.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/I2ihrfy.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 10.8.21 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # (T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n**T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)** T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.).\n\n&gt; #([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://charts.finviz.com/chart.ashx?t=SPY&amp;ty=c&amp;ta=st_c,sch_200p,sma_50,sma_200,sma_20,sma_100,bb_20_2,rsi_b_14,macd_b_12_26_9,stofu_b_14_3_3&amp;p=d&amp;s=l))\n\n*****\n\n# DISCUSS!\n\nWhat are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?\n\n*****\n\nI hope you all have a wonderful weekend and a great trading week ahead r/smallstreetbets. :)",

The company has seen a significant improvement in its margins over the last year and management expects continued margin improvement in 2021.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Going into 2021, Aterian was showing strength and positive momentum in the fundamentals.

After its Q4 earnings report, ATER raised 2021 revenue guidance 12% above consensus. The company has not guided for 2022 yet, but we believe the current consensus estimate from analysts is very conservative. We believe there is great potential for ATER to guide significantly above the consensus 2022 estimate as we get into the second half of 2021.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou should really go over the numbers yourself.

Evans Christopher C. Geczy David K. Musto Adam V. Reed*  Submitted to the SEC  (May 25th, 2006)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*Regulations allow market makers to short sell without borrowing stock, and the transactions of a major options market maker show that in most hard-to-borrow situations, it chooses not to borrow and instead fails to deliver stock to its buyers. Some of the value of failing passes through to option prices: when failing is cheaper than borrowing, the relation between borrowing costs and option prices is significantly weaker. The remaining value is profit to the market maker, and its ability to profit despite the usual competition between market makers appears to result from a cost advantage of larger market makers at failing.\\*\\*\\*\\***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is important-  Read this:\n\n**(hUh WuT mEaN? :   It's basically saying shorts often chose not to deliver based off the Cost to Borrow price but still short. Everyone in retail thinks that when shorts are out of shares on Ortex or fintel, they can't drop the price. This is saying the opposite. They are saying at times, that they will just chose to Fail to Deliver on top of borrowing shorts. Sometimes both. Basically shorts and Maker Makers have built naked shorting and choosing to Fail to Deliver into their business models.   Sometimes, its more cost effective to just wait so they eat the FTD fine and then just cover when the stock is lower.   It's another layer they have of power. Then on top of that Market Makers have the ability to drop the price through Short Exempt status where they don't have to follow any of the rules that shorts do. )**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://www.sec.gov/comments/4-520/4520-6.pdf](https://www.sec.gov/comments/4-520/4520-6.pdf)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# ****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************\n\n# \n\n# \n\n# Max Pain\n\n# \n\nLet me explain.

What they will do is run the price up high so bullish options traders thinking its going to moon so they start buying 12.5, 15, 20, 30 strikes.

ATER should have had a ton more buying pressure when we were pushing pushing up but it was easily pushed down with a small amount of short interest. That shows me a lot.

So it's cheaper for them to pin the price to max pain than allow the stock to run because they most likely don't have or might not have the ability to provide those shares. Which would cause more buying pressure because they would have to go to the market and buy more shares.....which puts more shares ITM which is what a Gamma Squeeze is.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou want to see the amount of FTD's spike hard??

And they did.\n*****\n&gt; Goldman chief U.S. equity strategist David Kostin said in a note to clients that his year-end S&amp;P 500 price target for 2021 is still 4,700, which is nearly 7% above its current level.\n*****\n&gt; The firm said earnings growth, not valuation expansion, was the primary driver of the S&amp;P 500\u2032s 17% return year to date, adding that should still be the case.\n*****\n&gt; # Earnings season begins\n&gt; The third-quarter earnings season \u2014 which kicks off next week with big bank earnings \u2014 is expected to be another strong series of reports, despite some worries about supply chain issues and higher costs. Third-quarter earnings are expected to have risen 27.6% year over year, according to FactSet. That would be the third-highest growth rate since 2010.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe\u2019ve seen some record earnings seasons the past few quarters, so all eyes will be on if earnings can help justify stocks near all-time high levels,\u201d Detrick said. \u201cWe do expect another solid earnings season, but we\u2019ve seen some high profile warnings already, so corporate America could have a rather high bar to clear this quarter. Buckle up.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Bank earnings are the main focus next week with JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Morgan Stanley, Citigroup and Goldman Sachs set to report.\n*****\n&gt; After a range-bound few months for bank stocks, analysts are looking ahead to catalysts that could fuel the next phase in their recovery. Wall Street expects loan growth, interest rates and reserve releases to play into the major banks\u2019 reports.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cEarnings for the third quarter quarter should again be strong and mostly outpace expectations,\u201d Leuthold Group chief investment strategist Jim Paulsen said. \u201cHours worked in the third quarter rose by about 5% suggesting real GDP for the quarter may be close to 7%. With most companies reporting strong pricing power, solid real GDP growth should result in another surprisingly strong corporate earnings season.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Paulsen sees earnings season rewarding cyclicals, like banks, and small caps more than technology stocks.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think the stock market is already showing signs of a leadership shift away from slow economic growth favorites including growth, tech, and defensive toward more the economically sensitive areas of small caps and cyclical sectors,\u201d he added.\n*****\n&gt; # Supply chain, higher cost warnings?\nWhile the earnings season should be strong, there are likely to be some warning signs about inflation and supply constraints that could scare the market about the year-end set-up.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe risks of higher inflation, Fed tapering and what will likely be a choppy earnings season are still with us,\u201d Bleakley Advisory Group chief investment officer Peter Boockvar said.\n*****\n&gt; There was some foreshadowing of this last week, when Bed Bath and Beyond shares cratered 25% after the company said it saw a steep drop-off in traffic in August. Bed Bath &amp; Beyond saw inflation costs escalating over the summer months, especially toward the end of its second quarter in August, which corroded profits.\n*****\n&gt; What investors know going into the third quarter \u2014 from company guidance \u2014 is that there could be haves and have nots this earnings season.\n*****\n&gt; FactSet data shows that 47 S&amp;P 500 companies have issued negative earnings guidance for the third quarter, and 56 companies have issued positive outlooks.\n*****\n&gt; # Fed headwind ahead?\n&gt; The headline jobs number Friday was a major disappointment, as the economy added just 194,000 jobs in September, well below the the Dow Jones estimate of 500,000. On the positive side, the unemployment rate fell to a much lower point than economists forecast. At 4.8%, that\u2019s the same level seen in late 2016.\n*****\n&gt; It\u2019s unclear if the number changes the calculus for when and how fast the Federal Reserve will slow its $120 billion-per-month bond-buying program.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIn our view these figures are good enough, and when combined with the debt-ceiling can being kicked down the road, likely solidifies November as \u2018go time\u2019 for tapering,\u201d Wells Fargo Securities senior equity analyst Christopher Harvey said.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe continue to expect a choppy equity market rally and a two-to-four-week tech bounce, but the bounce probably peters out next month when the Fed says those magical words: We will begin to taper,\u201d he added.\n\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/WuOc7cb.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE S&amp;P SECTORS FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/HnJ6ZF2.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/CojntqX.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/mxZnyBJ.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/eZbwxOb.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/JPCsx2m.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/kyfY7Xn.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/zEMv32q.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/uaj9G7t.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!]())**\n(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/VAaeJ4E.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/fgsZNEH.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/W5HmLSK.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/DDVPGco.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Best and Worst Performing S&amp;P 500 Stocks in 2021\n\n&gt; The fourth quarter is now off to the races and we thought it worthwhile to check in on the best and worst-performing S&amp;P 500 stocks on a year-to-date basis. As shown below, there are currently six members of the index that have rallied over 100% this year. Apt for the year that its vaccine has rolled out, the biggest gainer of these has been Moderna (MRNA) with a 196.12% rally. It now has a market cap of $124.87 billion versus a market cap of only $41 billion at the start of the year. Of the 20 best performers, MRNA is also the only one with a market cap above $100 billion. The next largest is ConocoPhillips (COP) with a $95.76 billion market cap. COP is one of multiple Energy stocks on this list as well. Of the top 20 performers, Energy sector names dominate the list with 8 members.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/100821-SPX-1.png))**\n\n&gt; Pivoting to the other end of the spectrum, Las Vegas Sands (LVS) is down the most this year having been cut by 36.18%. IPG Photonics (IPGP), Lamb Weston Holdings (LW), Viatris (VTRS), MarketAxess (MKTX), and Global Payments (GPN) also have fallen by at least 25%. Once again, there is only one member of this list with a market cap above $100 billion: Qualcomm (QCOM). One other interesting factor to note of the worst performers is there are several stocks that were at some point plays on pandemic trends, whether those be reopening or stay at home. For example, in addition to LVS, another gaming/reopening name, Wynn Resorts (WYNN), ranks as the eighth-worst performer YTD. Additionally, strong performers during the onset of the pandemic like Clorox (CLX), Activision Blizzard (ATVI), and Take-Two Interactive (TTWO) are all down double digits this year.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/100821-SPX-2.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Intraday Commodity Spikes\n\n&gt; Since the late spring, both silver and gold have been in steady downtrends spending much of that time below their 50-DMAs. Those downtrends remain in place, but both metals did find a short-term bottom on September 29th. While they have been rallying in the past week and a half, today each one has stalled out. From the early morning leading up to the Nonfarm Payrolls report, precious metals ramped higher with a surge immediately following the weaker than expected report. Only a couple hours after the release, gold and silver had erased a large portion of their earlier gains. In fact, silver is now 2.15% below its intraday high and gold is 1.36% below its high. For gold, in particular, that intraday reversal also marked a rejection of its 50-DMA which it\u2014as well as silver\u2014has struggled to stay above for most of the past several months.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/100821-GC-SI.png))**\n\n&gt; Crude oil is yet another commodity that is currently down off of its intraday highs, and like gold, the reversal came at a pretty interesting level. At its high Friday morning, front-month WTI futures rose above $80 for the first time since November 2014.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/100821-CL.png))**\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/100821-CL2.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # The Job Market Continues To Frustrate In September\n\n&gt; The September payroll report likely created more questions than it answered.\n\n&gt; The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics released its September employment report this morning, revealing that the domestic economy added a disappointing 194,000 jobs during the month, falling well short of Bloomberg-surveyed economists\u2019 median forecast for a gain of 500,000. This comes on the heels of a lukewarm August report, which did receive an upward revision of 131,000. Somewhat contradictory, the unemployment rate fell more than forecast to 4.8% in September, beating expectations, though that was paired with a reduced labor force participation rate of 61.6% when expectations called for an increase.\n\n&gt; \u201cThe observation window for this report likely came too soon for positive catalysts to really gain traction,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cLeisure and hospitality jobs, a proxy for economic reopening, were only marginally higher. We take this to mean Delta\u2019s waning impact will likely be more evident in October\u2019s report where we expect to see reopening momentum reassert itself.\u201d\n\n&gt; As seen in the LPL Chart of the Day, in-person segments of the labor market such as leisure and hospitality jobs grew steadily during the first half of the year when COVID-19 remained under relative control. However, the latest flare-up has dampened that trend. We expect to see renewed growth in this sector as the delta variant continues to abate.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/10.8.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; As mentioned, definitive takeaways from this report are difficult to come by due to the offsetting nature of the report. On the one hand, headline numbers came in very weak, but private payrolls, as well as manufacturing payrolls, fared better. The unemployment rate experienced a significant drop, but interpreting that number becomes muddied when considering the fact that we are already experiencing a significant worker shortage and the participation rate is declining, not increasing, as we would hope to see in a true recovery.\n\n&gt; What is more, because the observation window for the report cuts off mid-month, we cannot yet draw conclusions about the impact of school reopening and the lapsing of enhanced unemployment benefits\u2014hotly debated crosscurrents\u2014plus the aforementioned waning delta impact. Regarding the inflation debate\u2014average hourly earnings rose 0.6% month over month and 4.6% year over year. And while wages are undeniably growing and helping to fuel inflation, the data are not mix-adjusted and therefore are inflated due to the suppressed growth in the in-person, lower-wage segment of the labor market.\n\n&gt; The biggest question, though, is what this means for the Federal Reserve\u2019s (Fed) asset tapering plans. The market had all but expected the Fed to announce a tapering timeline at its next meeting coming into this report, with the caveat that Fed Chair Jerome Powell needed only to see a \u201creasonably good\u201d job report first. Whether September\u2019s surprise report has cleared that low bar or not now becomes an open question, one which the market had all but dismissed as a formality previously.\n\n&gt; Indeed, in the aftermath of the report\u2019s release Treasury markets immediately began pricing in a possible delay to any taper, and equity markets gyrated between positive and negative territory as they struggled to process whether bad news should actually be considered good news in this context. We will have to see in the coming weeks whether this report will be substantial enough to bring on the much-anticipated taper announcement, but one thing is for sure\u2014there are no gimmies in this labor market recovery.\n*****\n\n&gt; # Columbus Day Performance\n\n&gt; Columbus Day is an interesting trading day for financial markets as it is one of the few trading days of the year when the equity market is open, but the bond market is closed. This may lead investors to think that equity markets should perform positively, as investors do not have credit markets to allocate capital to on that specific day. However, looking at the S&amp;P 500's historical performance on Columbus Day over the last 25 years doesn't necessarily show a real positive bias. Columbus Day tends to act just like any other trading day. Over the last 25 years, median performance on Columbus Day has been a gain of 10 basis points (bps) with positive returns 55.6% of the time. While that's slightly higher than the median one-day gain of 7 bps for all trading days over the last 25 years, the difference isn't significant. That's not to say that Columbus Day hasn't seen some outliers, though. Who can forget in 2008, during the middle of the Financial Crisis, when the S&amp;P 500 rallied more than 11% on Columbus Day!\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/Day-of.png))**\n\n&gt; For the week of Columbus Day, the S&amp;P 500's median gain has been 0.31% with positive returns 63% of the time which also isn't extraordinary relative to average weekly returns for the S&amp;P 500 over the last 25 years. The worst Columbus Day weeks were in 1999 (-6.63%) and 2018 (-4.10%) while the best were in 1998 (+7.32%), 2002 (5.87%), and 2011 (+5.98%). Interestingly enough, in 2008, even after rallying over 11% on Columbus Day, the S&amp;P 500 finished the week up just 4.60% as it erased more than half of its gains from the holiday session.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/Week-of.png))**\n\n&gt; The table below lists the S&amp;P 500's performance leading up to and after Columbus Day for each of the last 25 years. With a decline of over 2.5% since the start of September, this year ranks as the weakest performance for the equity market since 2014.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/Columbus-Day-Table-100821.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # The Most Important Chart In The World\n\n&gt; And just like that, the calendar turned to October and volatility picked up in a big way, with three consecutive 1% moves for the S&amp;P 500 Index to start the month. As we noted in our October preview, this month gets a bad rap for being a bearish month (it isn\u2019t), but it absolutely owns the title as the most volatile month.\n\n&gt; t took nearly a full year, but the S&amp;P 500 finally had its first 5% pullback of 2021, thus ending hopes of 2021 joining 1954, 1958, 1964, 1993, 1995, and 2017 as the only years to go a full calendar year without a 5% move lower.\n\n&gt; \u201cVolatility is the price of admission,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cSure, we\u2019d all prefer stocks go straight up forever, but that isn\u2019t reality. Investors must learn to embrace and accept the eventual scares and bouts of volatility that are common even in the strongest bull markets.\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, since 1980, stocks experience a 14.2% peak-to-trough pullback on average during the year, putting the recent 5% pullback in perspective. In fact, 21 out of the past 41 years saw at least a 10% correction. Incredibly, 12 of those years finished in the green and those 12 years gained an average of 17.0%. Who could forget last year\u2019s 34% bear market and move back to up 16% by the end of the year? In other words, big pullbacks can happen even in years that see outsized gains, which is why this chart is so important for investors.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/10.6.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; The last new all-time high for the S&amp;P 500 was on September 2, but as of the end of September there were still 54 new all-time highs in 2021, the second most ever with one quarter to go. The good news? Previous years that saw a lot new highs the first three quarters usually had strong performance the final quarter.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/10.6.21-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Taking things a step further, this year the S&amp;P 500 produced one of its best ever year-to-date gains through September, up 14.7% with a quarter to go. It turns out that good starts to a year tend to resolve higher. In fact, 9 of the past 10 years the S&amp;P 500 was up at least 12.5% with a quarter to go there were further gains in the fourth quarter. As you can see below, the returns are greatly skewed due to 1987, but the median return in the final quarter of the year is an impressive 5.2% (versus the average fourth quarter return of 4.0%).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/10.6.21-Blog-Chart-3.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Performance Through Q3 And its Impact on Q4 Performance\n\n&gt; Every year, the makeup and number of sectors that outperform the S&amp;P 500 changes. This year, four sectors (Energy, Financials, Real Estate, and Communication Services) outperformed the S&amp;P 500 through the end of Q3, while last year it was only three sectors that outperformed in the first three quarters of the year (Technology, Consumer Discretionary, and Communication Services).\n\n&gt; As we all know, past performance does not indicate future performance, and in looking at sectors that have outperformed the S&amp;P 500 in the first three quarters of prior years compared to how they performed in Q4, the same holds true. The table below lists the number of sectors that outperformed and underperformed the S&amp;P 500 in the first three quarters of each year since 2000 and then shows their median performance during Q4 of the same year. Looking at a summary of the annual results, it's almost a coinflip as to whether or not the leading sectors in the first three quarters of a given year will continue to outperform in Q4. On average, the sectors that outperform YTD through 9/30 have averaged a Q4 gain of 3.58% (median: +6.40%) with positive returns 76% of the time. Sectors that lag the S&amp;P 500 in the first three quarters of the year average a rest of year gain of 3.67% (median: 5.95%) with gains 71% of the time. While the term 'strength begets strength' has historically been applicable to the broader market, at the sector level, buying the YTD winners (or losers) ahead of Q4 in expectation of continued momentum to close out the year (or a mean reversion bounce) hasn't offered any material outperformance.\n\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/Snap227.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Typical October Trading: Volatile Start Sets Up Rally through Month\u2019s End\n\n&gt; Over the last twenty-one years, the full month of October has been a solid month for the market. DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ, Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 have all recorded gains ranging from 0.6% by Russell 2000 to 1.9% by NASDAQ. But these gains have come with volatile trading, most notably during the early days of the month. October has opened softly with mild gains on its first trading day by DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and Russell 1000. On the second day, all five indexes have been weak followed by a rebound on the third trading day before additional weakness pulls the market lower through the seventh trading day. At which point, the market has historically found support and began to rally through mid-month and beyond.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/070f50fc0225a24692163a37694f0425/da1ccfd284e5df51-2c/s500x750/009fdcd32ca89da61f3a47401e5e5eaf71f34f50.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending October 8th, 2021** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwLj9O1yEmE))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 10.10.21**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED.)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * (**T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.**)\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!]())**\n(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!]())**\n(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES FOR THE MONTH OF OCTOBER 2021!](https://i.imgur.com/xrMCop9.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 10.11.21 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 10.11.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/cF0CbQE.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday  10.12.21 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/D4dB9sd.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 10.12.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/jDBI2Dv.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 10.13.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/qVRtzZv.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 10.13.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/V7gDj4f.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 10.14.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/hZ42eSL.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 10.14.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/HNdhjgf.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 10.15.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/I2ihrfy.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 10.15.21 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # (T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n**(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)** (T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.).\n\n&gt; #([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://charts.finviz.com/chart.ashx?t=SPY&amp;ty=c&amp;ta=st_c,sch_200p,sma_50,sma_200,sma_20,sma_100,bb_20_2,rsi_b_14,macd_b_12_26_9,stofu_b_14_3_3&amp;p=d&amp;s=l))\n\n*****\n\n# DISCUSS!\n\nWhat are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?\n\n*****\n\nI hope you all have a wonderful weekend and a great trading week ahead r/StockMarket. :)",

While they are the current market leader they currently only have 15% of the market\n\n-if their solar as a service model proves out to be beneficial it will be copied by other players, many other businesses are now offering the solar as a service option\n\n- They have very poor reviews. Including a 2.89 out of 5 on the better business bureau in comparison to SunPower which had a 4.3.\n\n- They use mid-tier solar panels produced in China that are less efficient than SunPower and Tesla. \n\n- They don\u2019t benefit from scale since their growth strategy revolves around deferred income. \n\n- They pay for the installation and the customer pays it off over a 25 year contract.\n\n- This deferred income strategy has caused them to take out 6 billion in debt.\n\n- Lost out to SunPower on several large exclusive contracts from homebuilders. \n\n- Significantly worse battery performance of their brightbox vs the Tesla Powerwall and Sunvault\n\nDisclosure: I do not own shares, nor do I have any position in SunRun\n\nDisclaimer: I am not a financial advisor and this is not intended as advice",

        "selftext": "#**Introduction**\nEveryone talks about what to invest in, but they often skip a step when talking to beginners. What to invest in starts with knowing what is available. Here are the fundamental investment types I will be covering today:\n\n\n* Stocks \u2013 fractional ownership of a company sold in the form of shares\n* Bonds \u2013 a loan to a company or government that will pay interest in the future\n* Commodities \u2013 a raw material or agricultural product that can be bought or sold\n* Mutual Funds and ETFs  \u2013 containers holding many stocks, bonds, or commodities\n\n\nEach of these have their own unique set of attributes and uses. They\u2019re differentiated based on risk, specialization, and ease of use. I might go into these details in the future, but for now I want to start at the very beginning. \n\n#**Stocks**\nLet\u2019s say you own a business. You currently only have one location but would like to open another. You know your business is worth about $1 million dollars and that it costs $100,000 to open a new store. You decide to create 10,000 shares and attempt to sell them for $100 each. Each share represents a 0.01% ownership stake in the company. Let\u2019s say you sell 2,000 of the shares. Now you own 8,000 shares and the person or people you sold the shares to own 2,000. This means you own 80% of the company and the others own 20%. They paid you $200,000 for those shares which you can now use to open two new stores. \n\nSo why did the people in the example buy $200,000 worth of your business\u2019s stock? People buy stocks for two primary reasons. The first is that they expect the business to do well. A business that does well will grow and increase the value of its shares. This is called capital appreciation. If you go ahead and builds two more stores that generate the same income as the first, the value of the business will have roughly tripled. The $200,000 that was invested could now easily be worth $600,000. On the other hand, what if you tried to open two new stores and they both failed? Everyone would see that you\u2019re bad at running this business and those shares might only be worth $100,000 now. The second reason is to collect dividend payments from the business. A dividend is when a company takes a portion of its earnings and pays them out to its shareholders. These are more common among older well established businesses that have consistent income.\n\nStocks are most commonly traded on stock exchanges. The United States is home to the two largest exchanges in the world, the New York Stock Exchange, and the Nasdaq Stock Market. To buy or sell stocks yourself on the exchanges you need to go through a brokerage. This might sound like a daunting process but can usually be set up in less than 15 minutes. Once you have an account set up and money deposited buying and selling shares is nearly instantaneous. \n\n#**Bonds**\nWhen you need to make a large purchase like a new car you don\u2019t typically pay it all up front. You might not have enough money at the moment or want a way to spread the purchase out over time. To do this you get a loan. Let\u2019s say you want to buy a $20,000 car. You spend $4,000 on the down payment and agree to pay the rest over the next three years. You get to take the car home today because the loan pays the dealership the remaining amount owed. In return for lending you this money the bank is going to charge interest as you pay the loan back. Let\u2019s assume the interest rate is 3% per year. At this rate you\u2019ll end up paying the bank back about $16,751. The additional $751 is their payment for taking on the risk of loaning you that money.\n\nBonds and loans have a lot in common. They\u2019re both used to finance expensive purchases, have interest rates, and cover a set period of time. There are some differences though. The car loan was paid off in monthly payments over the course of three years. Each monthly payment paid some of the interest as well as some of the initial $16,000 principal. Let\u2019s say you\u2019re the bank. Instead of writing a car loan you use the money to buy a bond worth $16,000 at the same 3% interest rate over the same three year period. As the holder of the bond you would be entitled to interest rate payments, twice per year, for three years. Each semiannual payment would be 1.5% of $16,000 or $240. After three years the bond would mature, you would receive your last interest payment, and you would receive your entire $16,000 back.\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at how stocks and bonds compare. Both of them can be used to raise money, but they do so in significantly different ways. When you buy stock you are buying a fractional ownership in the business. You do not get your initial investment back unless the company pays dividends, or you sell your shares and give up ownership. Bonds can also be used to raise money, but they do not offer any ownership. When a company sells bonds it knows that it will have to pay them back in the future which can be costly. When it sells stock its current shareholders lose some of their ownership and therefore value. Let\u2019s say there are 100 shares of company XYZ and they decided to issue 20 more. Previously every share was worth 1% of the company, now every share is only worth 0.83% of the company. This is only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to understanding what stocks and bonds are and how they compare to each other. \n\n#**Commodities**\nStocks and bonds are each considered to be an asset class. An asset class is a group of investments that have similar characteristics and have to follow the same regulations. Stock in Apple is not the exact same as stock in Visa, but they serve the same purpose, can be traded the same way, and follow the same rules. The same can be said about bonds. A bond that takes seven years to mature is not the exact same as one that takes ten years, but they are both going to be structured the same. The third asset class we will be covering are commodities.\n\nA commodity is a raw material or primary agricultural product. These products are essentially the same regardless of where they come from. Copper, gold, oil, iron, and lumber are all examples of raw material commodities. Corn, soybeans, meat, and milk are all agricultural commodities. There may be minor fluctuations in quality, but in order to be traded on exchanges they need to meet a minimum requirement. These materials form the foundation of almost everything our economy produces. \n\nUnlike with stocks or bonds, commodities are not used as a way to raise money. They\u2019re traded as a way to protect the producer from risk. Let\u2019s say you can grow 10,000 bushels of wheat in a good year. You would like to get at least $8 per bushel once it\u2019s harvested. What happens if there is a perfect year for crops and everyone else has produced more than expected. This increase in supply pushes the price lower because buyers have more to choose from. The price per bushel is now only $5. In this situation you would only earn 63% as much as you were forecasting which can be hard to handle as a business. In order to protect yourself from this situation you might want to create a contract with a wheat buyer on an exchange. This contract could include you agreeing to sell your wheat for $7 per bushel at the end of the summer. This is less than the $8 you are hoping for, but it will be guaranteed. Assuming the person buying the contract was also expecting wheat to be worth $8 per bushel, they will see this as a good deal. When prices for materials are known in advance it\u2019s easier to budget and plan which is a benefit for both parties. \n\nOdds are you aren\u2019t looking to buy or sell massive quantities of wheat, or any other raw materials. If you\u2019re looking at investing in commodities it\u2019s probably going to be in oil, gold, or common metals like copper. Thankfully you don\u2019t need to be directly trading contracts with the producers to do this. There are shares that can be bought and sold like stocks on a stock exchange. Each share represents a fixed amount of the commodity, such as an ounce of gold or a barrel of oil. The primary reason people buy commodities is to protect themselves from inflation. This works because as the price of things increase, the price of the raw materials must also increase. \n\n#**Mutual Funds and Exchange Traded Funds**\nNow that you have an idea of what the three most popular asset classes are, let\u2019s take a look at a couple of the tools associated with them. Mutual funds and ETFs are both collections of stocks, bonds, or commodities that can be traded. Instead of hand selecting companies, bonds, or commodities these collections allow you to purchase a fraction of many of them all at once. \n\nThe S&amp;P 500 is an index that tracks 500 of the largest companies in the United States. It\u2019s often used as a general gauge for the US economy. If the economy is doing well and growing, this index will also be growing. Instead of having to purchase shares in all 500 businesses by hand there are numerous ETFs that will do that for you. The most popular one has a ticker name of SPY. When you buy a share of SPY, 5.9% of your money is being put in Apple stock, 2.29% is put into Facebook stock, and so on. The larger the company the larger the fraction of your money they get. This is called a market cap weighed fund. \n\nSPY is an ETF which means you can buy or sell it at any time with ease. FXAIX also covers the companies of the S&amp;P 500, but it is a mutual fund. What is the difference between the two? Well there\u2019s not much. The most noticeable one is that mutual funds cannot be traded throughout the day. They can only be purchased at the end of the day. Although not a rule, mutual funds are much more likely to be actively managed than an ETF. Active management means there is a professional portfolio manager in charge of selecting when to buy or sell the things the mutual fund holds. ETFs are much more likely to be passively managed. This means they track a set list of stocks automatically.\n\n#**Conclusion**\nThese four categories make up a vast majority of investments. Being able to understand how each of them work is crucial in making your own investment choices. Hopefully this post was able to bring up even more questions than it answered if you're new. Now that you know what the major fundamental asset classes are you might ask yourself why you would choose one over the other. This was touched on, but I never went into detail on the risk, return, history, or combination of them. All of these ideas warrant their own posts which may come in the future. Thank you for reading.\n\nIf you enjoy these kinds of posts I created my own subreddit r/FinancialAnalysis where I post detailed write ups on various investing topics.",

        "selftext": "Apes, here is the opportunity. $VIAC trades at P/E multiple of 7 with revenue of $28 billion, while $NFLX has 62 P/E multiple and revenue of 27$ billion. Paramount+ subscription is 4.99$ and 9.99$, and is now bundled with Showtime content for just $9.99 or 12.99$, which is significantly cheaper than $NFLX $8.99, $13.99 and $17.99. Paramount+ is currently available in 25 countries including Australia and New Zealand which launched in August 2021, and will be in 45 countries including Europe by beginning of 2022, so expect at least 100 million more subs subscribing by next year as soon as it becomes available. My projection being 150-180 million subs by end of 2022. Also, in July 2021, Paramount+ and Showtime combined accounted for 22% of all sign-ups in the US, while NFLX only 5%. As you can see $VIAC is the growth stock and $NFLX is the stagnating piece of crap with no growth left, as why they are moving into fucking games...\n\n**Hence, $VIAC should trade at price of at least $90 per share or 120% upside from current $39.35**.

Evans Christopher C. Geczy David K. Musto Adam V. Reed*  Submitted to the SEC  (May 25th, 2006)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*Regulations allow market makers to short sell without borrowing stock, and the transactions of a major options market maker show that in most hard-to-borrow situations, it chooses not to borrow and instead fails to deliver stock to its buyers. Some of the value of failing passes through to option prices: when failing is cheaper than borrowing, the relation between borrowing costs and option prices is significantly weaker. The remaining value is profit to the market maker, and its ability to profit despite the usual competition between market makers appears to result from a cost advantage of larger market makers at failing.\\*\\*\\*\\***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is important-  Read this:\n\n**(hUh WuT mEaN? :   It's basically saying shorts often chose not to deliver based off the Cost to Borrow price but still short. Everyone in retail thinks that when shorts are out of shares on Ortex or fintel, they can't drop the price. This is saying the opposite. They are saying at times, that they will just chose to Fail to Deliver on top of borrowing shorts. Sometimes both. Basically shorts and Maker Makers have built naked shorting and choosing to Fail to Deliver into their business models.   Sometimes, its more cost effective to just wait so they eat the FTD fine and then just cover when the stock is lower.   It's another layer they have of power. Then on top of that Market Makers have the ability to drop the price through Short Exempt status where they don't have to follow any of the rules that shorts do. )**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://www.sec.gov/comments/4-520/4520-6.pdf](https://www.sec.gov/comments/4-520/4520-6.pdf)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# ****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************\n\n# \n\n# \n\n# Max Pain\n\n# \n\nLet me explain.

ATER should have had a ton more buying pressure when we were pushing pushing up but it was easily pushed down with a small amount of short interest. That shows me a lot.

There are two components of a gamma squeeze: 1. unusually high call open interest for ATM and near the money call options on the closest expiry and 2. a technical setup that would allow for a breakout move in the near future. \n\nWhy are those the two keys? The first one should be obvious, as you need high call OI for a gamma squeeze to happen. The reason for this is because of market maker delta hedging. Market makers are constantly buying and selling shares based on the delta of the calls they sell. The reason for this is because they need to remain market neutral for conflict of interest purposes and portfolio strategy purposes (they are delta neutral, long theta, and short vega, which is why they make their money when IV decreases and theta eats away at option premium values). Gamma is the rate of change of delta. Gamma is the highest in the strike immediately above and the strike immediately below the current price. This means that when a stock makes a strong move upward, market makers have to buy the most shares to hedge due to these near the money options because their gamma increases delta at the highest rate. The point of a gamma squeeze is that when a stock with unusually high ATM and near the money call open interest makes an aggressively move upward, the option gamma rapidly increases delta for the huge amount of options, so market makers must buy tons of shares to remain delta neutral, which further pushes up the stock. Most of you probably already understand this concept as it has been widely talked about.\n\nWhat most people don't seem to understand is how to identify the second part of a gamma squeeze setup. Most people are good at identifying when a stock has unusually high call OI, but the second crucial aspect is a technical setup that would allow for a breakout move in the near future. This is important because a gamma squeeze can only happen if a stock's price increases thus increasing delta and forcing delta hedging. A stock could have a perfect gamma squeeze setup on the option chain but if it doesn't move upward, there will be no gamma squeeze because gamma won't increase delta. That's why the technical setup is so important. Just a note, but many gamma squeezes have happened due to good option OI stats and random good news pushing up the stock and causing a gamma squeeze. Since that is random and unpredictable, a technical setup is the next best thing because we can predict it with more certainty. \n\nThe technical setup part is pretty easy once you understand why it's necessary. You are usually looking for something like a bounce off an upcoming support, a wedge, triangle, or bull flag being formed, or some other consolidation setup where a bullish breakout is possible in the near future. Additionally, an upcoming catalyst or event could suffice. \n\n# 2. Why Reddit holds the bag and sucks at squeezes\n\nI am going to put it plain and simple again: Reddit/retail absolutely sucks at playing squeezes. First, most don't understand the second part of the gamma squeeze (the technical setup) and simply look for high call OI plays, which can be successful, but is far less probable than one with a technical setup. Second, for some reason that I still don't understand, reddit/retail refuses to enter squeeze plays until after they have already happened. In both my IRNT and RKLY posts, so many people said I was completely wrong and retarded (which is fair). However, when those plays squeezed the next day, some of those same people messaged me days later asking if the squeeze was still happening. This is why people hold the bag - they refuse to buy before the squeeze starts and then FOMO into plays that are already dead. Retail traders have it hard enough with all of the disadvantages facing us in financial markets, but FOMO retardation is an unacceptable cardinal sin.\n\nNext, everyone on reddit has ADHD. Someone made a post a few days ago about why reddit sucks at squeezing and noted that it takes weeks for short squeezes to happen and reddit keeps falling for pump and dumps because they can't stay in one play for more than a few days. I completely agree with this. With that being said, I'm going to assert that 99% of plays on reddit have been gamma squeezes or pump and dumps. The only plays that were short squeezes were AMC and GME and that's because they have cult followings who were willing to hold for months (these stocks also had gamma squeeze elements so it wasn't a pure short squeeze). With that being said, gamma squeezes are perfect for reddit because they don't take a long time to happen. If the call OI is there, it only takes a strong move upward for the squeeze to happen. With short squeezes, large institutions won't be margin called until they are down 100's of percent for weeks at a time.\n\n# 3. ATER's coming gamma squeeze and why it could be violent\n\nSo far I have explained to you the two necessities for gamma squeeze plays. I have also explained to you why gamma squeezes are good plays for ADHD redditors. Finally, I have explained to you why redditors often hold the bag even though they shouldn't be. With that being said, I am here to tell you of an opportunity that checks off both of the gamma squeeze boxes, hasn't taken off yet, and has strong name recognition among retail: ATER. \n\n**Option Chain and Gamma Analysis**\n\n*Processing img 3htbafht4pr71...*\n\nFirst, we have the option chain. As you can see, $10 is an absolutely crucial strike as the OI is over 10,000. Additionally, there is a gamma ramp all the way up to the $20 strike (as evident by the insanely high OI in those strikes). The total OI for the $10 - $20 chain is over 75,000 total contracts (this would be equal to 7,500,000 if all contracts were exercised. Notice the gamma for the 10, 12,5, and 15 strikes are all above .065. This means that a $1 increase in the price of the stock would create a .10 increase in delta (for the $10 strike). A .10 increase would mean that 10 shares would need to be bought for the market maker to remain delta neutral, which means that a $1 move upward in the stock would force market makers to buy over 100,000 shares to remain delta neutral only for the $10 strike. You can imagine what happens as price keeps going up and gamma keeps increasing delta exponentially. The fact that call volume for those strikes starkly outweighs put volume is further bullish AND because market makers constantly (and often automatically through algorithms) delta hedge, a stark move upwards would cause market makers who were short puts to cover their short shares (used to delta hedge puts) thus causing further upward pressure. \n\nBelow I have used Thinkorswim's OnDemand feature to look back at the option chain for the closest strike before each of the previous moves up. \n\nFirst, this is the option chain on September 30 when the stock was about $9. This is just to compare it to now. As you can see, option OI has steadily been going up.\n\n*Processing img u26g0tjo6pr71...*\n\nNext, the option chain for September 20, which is right after the first price jump and before the second one. The stock was trading at around $20. You can see that option OI was still pretty strong (though 25 days to expiry is kinda far out) but not nearly as strong as it is now. Despite this, the stock still made yet another move up to almost $20.\n\n*Processing img n92fo9407pr71...*\n\nFinally, we have the option chain from Sept 8 when the stock was trading at $8. This was before the giant squeeze up to $19 (the very first one). Notice a similar setup to now? High ATM and near the money call OI. The biggest difference? There's no gamma ramp here unlike what we have now. Overall option OI is also lower than what we currently have.\n\n*Processing img m1fto2s97pr71...*\n\nWhat these images should show you is that ATER's option chain has pretty definitive characteristics before each gamma squeeze and that the current setup is by far the strongest. \n\nFinally, I have the put/call ratio for today and overall. As you can see, calls are dominating puts.\n\n*Processing img f93eshgi8pr71...*\n\n*Processing img gyznkggi8pr71...*\n\n**Technical Setup**\n\nNow that you've seen the options chain setup, it's time for the technical setup. Remember the technical setup is crucial because it is what allows gamma to start to affect delta. Think of the technical setup as the push to get up on the gamma ramp. We are currently not on the gamma ramp, but the technical setup is what would push us up to it. \n\nBelow are the 5m, 90m, and 1D charts for ATER:\n\n*Processing img hjt2urbb9pr71...*\n\n*Processing img fs19cc8c9pr71...*\n\n*Processing img gvermqwjbpr71...*\n\nYou'll notice that the technical setup here is absolutely clear. The \\~$9.50 level is a very strong support. On the day chart and 90 min chart, you'll notice that the stock bounced off of it twice. The support even survived the recent market turmoil, which is a strong statement. Each time that the stock reaches the support level, volume dries up, which shows that it is again a very strong support. Finally, you can clearly see the triangle pattern emerging on both the 90m and 5m charts. Both of these charts show that the triangle is going to end in the next few days. Here is what a triangle pattern like this typically does.\n\n*Processing img inju9k1x9pr71...*\n\nIf the triangle breaks out in a bullish way, then it means that the stock will go to AT LEAST $12 (without considering gamma). Once the stock reaches above $11, IMO, gamma will take over and send the stock up further to at least the $18 level and possibly above the previous two highs. Like I said, the technical setup is what pushes us up to allow gamma to take over, and this is a very strong technical setup. Since we keep respecting the 9.5 level, I would say it's very likely that we break out. I have been playing this stock for the past few weeks and IMO it is blatantly clear that this is a continuation of the previous jumps: bounce off of support, low volume on support, and strong call OI - I've seen it before and I'm currently seeing it now. That's why I'm saying this is an opportunity to get in on a squeeze play before it squeezes so you aren't holding the bag for the 5349239120 time. \n\n**Other stuff**\n\nI could go over the fact that the borrow fee on the stock is high, available shares are drying up, something about float, something about short interest, something with ortex signals, but I'm not going to do that because it's all just noise. This is not a short squeeze play. Most reddit plays are not short squeeze plays, so those stats do not matter even close to as much as the gamma setup and the technical setup. \n\nPlease see the note at the beginning about the risks involved with plays like this, doing your own research, etc.",

Orea Mining and NordGold has the rights to exploit the project in a joint venture where Orea has 45% of the deposit.\n\n* As per 2017 BFS the mine should produce an average of 237000 oz each year (for 10 years)\n* Low [AISC ](https://kalkinemedia.com/definition/a/all-in-sustaining-cost)at 779 compared to international rates \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jl4emfcxevq71.png?width=817&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e51452952a48786af9e48adf32e6df55c1c195b4\n\n* [IRR ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fw5-wccViOM): 23% at gold price [1200 usd per ounce ](https://oreamining.com/properties/french-guiana/montagne-dor/)\n* Orea owns 45% which equals (45%\\*237000) 106,650 oz\n* At XAU 1700 usd, Orea share equals (1700\\*106650) = 181,305,000 usd, and minus cost of production (AISC \\* XAU ) = 779\\*106650=83,080,350 USD \n* Hence Orea should generate roughly 181,305,000-83,080,350 = 98,224,650 USD / year\n* \\---------------------------------------------------------------------\n* Compare with top 6 companies out of top 10 gold producers : [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oPoxsNjNJQ2b-7w8PF2JNbVONNxVzZmMJgIJNAxFl5g/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oPoxsNjNJQ2b-7w8PF2JNbVONNxVzZmMJgIJNAxFl5g/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ebsgcx01fvq71.png?width=1513&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f20f5bbf657eb007746baa60ac0d57b59b7d432d\n\n***Conclusion*** : from the above I compared $OREAF with 6 out of the top ten gold producer companies in terms of : market cap, number of outstanding shares, Gold production per year in ounces and share price. I can see that $OREAF is going to produce a lot cheaper gold as soon as they start their production process. And they will be operating their micro cap effectively to produce much more amounts of Gold compared to this cap estimated at 38 Million and in comparison to Big players in the market. This will leave $OREAF with alot of space to grow and consequently their share price to go higher. From present day 1/10/2021 price at almost 20 cent $OREAF can grow on an optimistic basis to 14x to a total market cap of 532 Million USD and 2.8 $ per share. Or on conservative basis to 266 million USD and 1.4 $ per share. The gap between to valuation because on first case I compared $OREAF to the averages of the six mentioned tickers mentioned on the above table. In the second case I compared it to the best performing one which is Kinross Gold which is too undervalued and projected to almost 70% increase in share price from current price at 5.2 $. \n\nRisk factors :\n\n* Drop of gold prices.\n* Production delay\n* Problems due environmental and social activits.\n* Dilution of shares from the current value at 204,704,925.\n\nWrote by : [https://twitter.com/Aboul\\_Nasr\\_](https://twitter.com/Aboul_Nasr_)",

        "selftext": " Be warned you ~~retards,~~ ~~nut guzzlers,~~ ~~dear friends of mine~~, autists.\n\n**THIS IS A LONG PLAY** and not for boomers or someone with an attention span of an unmedicated ADD kid. Also, this is a long line of letters that sometimes combine to form coherent words and text, but I\u2019ll include a TLDR. \n\nI\u2019m about to present to you, what I think will be a new major player in the Indian entertainment business; QYou Media.   \nHol up, retard, did you say India? Why yes indeed I did. We\u2019ll get back to that part in a bit. \n\nFirst let me present the company. QYou Media is an odd mix of influencer marketing, on-demand entertainment via streaming and ad-revenue, which combined does what no other company in India is doing; trying to go full circle on ads. Yes you heard me - ads. \n\nTo do that, QYou Media is split into three divisions; one division in the US whose focus is mainly on promoting movies, games and series via influencers on TikTok. And actually, they\u2019re doing quite an impressive job at that. They've made marketing for several movies and games like \"The Croods: A New Age\", \"Resident Evil Village\" and \"Trolls World Tour\", bringing in more than 300 million views to the respective TikTok channels. This goes to show that the new generation of ~~fucktards~~ kids, teens and \u201cadults\u201d are spending a lot of time on their devices, which obviously helps drive advertisements as more hours spent watching equals more attention to your product and more ad-revenue.  \n\nThe other two divisions are based in India, QYou India and Chtrbox. QYou India is an entertainment based division that hosts a tv-channel with a target demographic of young Indians, of which there currently are around 650 million btw. The channel, The Q, is currently free and is supported by ads - also known as a FAST-channel (free ad-supported tv). \n\nCurrently, the channel is rated at an average of 42 GRP for Q2 and Q3 of 2021, with their other nearest competitors ranked at below 12.5. That\u2019s right, The Q is vastly more popular amongst the young demographic than the other nearest youth-oriented channels. Also, 95 million households are watching The Q. \n\nFor those of you who don\u2019t know what GRP is, it\u2019s simply an abbreviation of Go Rfucking Pgoogle. It\u2019s a rating system kinda like the Nielsen ratings, but made by an Indian company called BARC - or BARF. Either one. \n\nThe Q is currently hosting brand advertisers like Facebook, Coca Cola, Pepsi, Unilever and Amazon, but has more than 30 brands signing up with them for the past 6 months. Actually, ad-space is in such high demand for The Q, that they\u2019re having a hard time finding any available ad-space and are currently looking to expand with more channels and a more varied programme catalogue.  \n\nThe last is Chtrbox which was acquired by QYou Media. Chtrbox has a catalogue of more than 300.000 influencers which will be able to help promote both The Q, but also mainly as a platform for big brands to help promote their products. And that\u2019s important as brands increasingly are looking towards influencers to help them promote their products to an ever increasing population globally. There will be no \u201cSilence, brand\u201d memes here. In fact, influencer marketing expenditure has increased year over year and is currently sitting at 13.8 billion USD globally https://www.statista.com/statistics/1092819/global-influencer-market-size/. That trend is likely to increase by a lot. This whole phenomenon is called Social Commerce.   \n\n\nWhy is QYou Media a good buy in my humble opinion? \n\nIndia is a huge market in many ways. Its retail market is at 792 billion USD. Yup, that\u2019s a pretty fucking lot. It is so large in fact, that retailers like Meesho are increasing their market cap by more than 100% on a 6 month period [https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/e-tailer-meesho-raises-570mn/articleshow/86669544.cms](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/e-tailer-meesho-raises-570mn/articleshow/86669544.cms)\n\nAnd that market is exactly what QYou Media will help promote. \n\nIn fact, money spent on ads is insane and according to Statista.com; \u201ca study of global advertising expenditures found that the ad spending in 2020 reached **586.5 billion U.S. dollars**. Forecast data indicates that the ad spending worldwide will reach 691 billion U.S. dollars by the end of 2023.\u201d [https://www.statista.com/statistics/1174981/advertising-expenditure-worldwide/](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1174981/advertising-expenditure-worldwide/)\n\nOther than that, the Indian population is consuming social media services like no other place. 10% of all youtube videos are viewed in India, Whatsapp and Facebook have their largest user base in India. Instagram has their second largest user base in India, soon to overtake their largest, the US. \n\nStill not convinced how big of a deal social media is in India? After TikTok was banned in India, new services like Chingari (which QYou partners with) is trying to fill that gap. The Q launched a 2 week contest on their Chingari channel where hopeful Indians could send in their audition tapes for a show called Jurm Ka Chehra. In that 2 week time, their channel on Chingari got 1 billion interactions and almost 50.000 audition tapes. Let that sink in. 1 billion interactions in 2 weeks. \n\nThat\u2019s what makes this so powerful. \n\nNow, let\u2019s look at the financials. QYou Media, in its current form, is 3 years old and has actively reinvested every single bit of revenue back into their company, which is a thing that won\u2019t change for the foreseeable future. That IMO is a very, very good thing. They are expecting to be cash-flow positive on their operating expenses late november this year, but will still keep investing back into the company. That means that the numbers will be red for quite a bit yet. Am I worried? No.\n\nIn Q1 2021 their revenue was around 300.000 CAD. In Q3 it was 4.700.000 CAD. This trend is predicted to continue for the next few years and their CEO and co-founder Curt Marvis is expecting around 50% growth quarter over quarter. \n\nThe fiscal report for 2021 will unfortunately not reflect the massive growth that well as the fiscal year for the company is June 30th and March 31st for India and Chtrbox. The company is considering changing the fiscal year to make it easier for investors. The report for fiscal year 2021 will hit in late October and will be from June 2020 to June 2021 \u2013 ergo, the report will not reflect on the state QYou is in right now and will not include the current revenue increase to 4.7 million USD.\n\nAlright, so who runs this freaking thing? Well, we've got quite the cast here;\n\nCurt Marvis, CEO and co-founder - previously President Digital at Lionsgate\n\nG. Scott Paterson, co-founder and chairman - previously Director and early investor at Lionsgate\n\nLes Garland, co-founder - previously co-founder at MTV and VH1\n\nGlenn Ginsburg, President Influencer Marketing - previously VP of sales at Disney and VP at MTV\n\nAndy Kaplan, executive chairman - President at Sony Pictures\n\nThese are all seasoned people with experience from big companies - people, these guys now their shit. That is why I\u2019m not worried. \n\nAlso, the fact that big brands are signing deals with these guys should be a very good sign, since they\u2019d have made their DD on the company before throwing their dollaridoos at them.  \n\nThere are waaaay more things about this company than what I have written up here, but I can\u2019t be fucked to write any more. My girlfriend\u2019s boyfriend is asking for his turn on the pc and I have got crippling carpal tunnel syndrome writing this. \n\nI\u2019d strongly recommend you watch videos on their Youtube channel and especially this one: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW84FWxjBDE&amp;t=1688s&amp;ab\\_channel=QYOUMedia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW84FWxjBDE&amp;t=1688s&amp;ab_channel=QYOUMedia)\n\nEspecially the part with a possible currency integration into their transactional content sounds very interesting. \n\nTLDR:\n\nQYou Media is in a very good place to help expand big brands in India. They\u2019re continuously increasing their revenue, reinvesting as much back into the company as they can and are led by very experienced people from Lionsgate, Sony, MTV and Disney.  \n\nTheir entertainment channel is currently being watched in 95 million households and with 300.000 influencers on their side, they will most likely be a major player in the coming years. \n\nGo watch this video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW84FWxjBDE&amp;t=1688s&amp;ab\\_channel=QYOUMedia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW84FWxjBDE&amp;t=1688s&amp;ab_channel=QYOUMedia)\n\nA disclaimer: I am invested in this company, but I couldn\u2019t give two shits if you choose to invest in it. This is not a recommendation to buy, I\u2019m simply sharing a company that I find very interesting. Your money, your decision.",

        "selftext": "(TSX-V: ALY; OTCQB: ATIXF)\n\n**About AnalytixInsight:**\n\nAnalytixInsight is a super cool young company with the support of some major players that I will discuss. CapitalCube is their main product and it offers machine-created research content on approximately 50,000 worldwide stocks and North American ETFs. CapitalCube provides content to some of the most reputable sources in finance, including Reuters and the Wall Street Journal. They also have a 49% stake in MarketWall, a developer of FinTech solutions for financial institutions.\u00a0MarketWall has over 2.5 million monthly visitors to its multi-device platform and social media. As a Samsung Electronics partner, MarketWall\u2019s financial apps are preloaded oncertain Samsung devices in Europe.\n\n**The company has also recently released Q2 earnings. Here are some highlights:**\n\n\u2022 Over the quarter, the company Completed an overnight marketed public offering that raised proceeds of $9.3 million\n\n\u2022 AnalytixInsight revenue for the 3 and 6 month periods ended June 30 increased by 3% and 24% respectively\n\n\u2022 MarketWall returned to profitability, reporting net income for the quarter of $90,984 compared to a net loss of $259,243 in the first quarter ended March 31, 2021\n\n\u2022 As at June 30, 2021, AnalytixInsight has a cash balance of $10,107,988\n\nRecently, AnalytixInisght announced plans to build a full-service trading platform that integrates CapitalCube and InvestoPro to provide stock trading, robo-advisory, financial analysis and many other features. With this, they have started to incorporate ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) scores, which are becoming increasingly important to investors, into their algorithms.\n\n**Catalyst:**\n\nMarketWall, who AnalytixInisght has a 49% stake in, has developed an online broker service called InvestoPro that will be targeted to European investors. The company's connection with CapitalCube through AnalytixInsight has given it access to AI and machine-created content. Heres the kicker, one of the largest banking groups in Europe, Intesa Sanpaolo, will be launching InvestoPro to their 7.1 million clients as their official online digital trading platform at some point in 2021 Q3. Intesa Sanpaolo will also incorporate MarketWall\u2019s mobile capabilities with their existing product and service portfolios for their retail banking customers. \n\nThis company has great products and whats even better is they are backed by some huge players in the finance/tech sector (Reuters/Refinitiv, WSJ, Intesa, Samsung). With the full launch of InvestoPro coming up (we're talking very soon), and the growing popularity of these types of self-directed online brokers, I think these guys are pretty well-positioned to experience exponential growth.\n\nNext week the company will discuss InvestoPro at the LD Micro Main Event MicroCap Investor Conference in Los Angeles on Tuesday, October 12, 2021 at 1:30PM PT (4:30PM ET).

        "selftext": "**Preface:** I wrote this yesterday but post was removed by mods so some of it might read weirdly.\n\n**Intro**\n\nOkay everyone put on your reading glasses cause this might be a bit of a long one. I will do my best to make sure it's worth your time and mine. I am sitting here in front of my wall of screens watching $GOGO squeeze in real time as I type this. I will try and get it out asap so yall can squeeze this bish with me.\n\n**Backstory**\n\nI am a full-time independent trader who is very aware of just how rigged the market is. I have been using a stocks-in-play approach using market scanners/screeners (ibkr tws and scanz) almost every single day for well over a year which means I have watched every major squeeze on US markets happen in real time.\n\nI watch charts all the way down to the 1sec time frame which tells me a lot about price action that I think is often missed by traditional day traders who claim 1min candles/bars is the lowest timeframe necessary. See comparison between 1min and 1sec candles for today\u2019s top on SPCE.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[SPCE 1min candles](https://preview.redd.it/uwy26i3qxuq71.png?width=1301&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fb2b73547ab425780dfea93aa75294988b0d6273)\n\n[SPCE 1sec candles](https://preview.redd.it/ll7wvfhrxuq71.png?width=1292&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=54835d3d71815c690e6299fcfa38dcecdf82308b)\n\nThere are smaller trends happening within the trends on larger time-frames that are simply missed when only watching 1min candles.\n\nThis has allowed me to identify unique forms of price action which signify what is going on behind the scenes (i.e. squeeze, pump, catalyst based move, etc.). The algos cant hide it as well on 1sec.\n\nThe real squeezes (usually short + gamma), like the ones that really exploded in the past year (i.e. GME, NEGG, RKT, AMC, support . com (banned ticker) , IRNT etc.), there is a very unique way the price moves on these lower timeframes. To explain this in too much detail is a tad woo woo but basically it is identified by a lot of sharp drops followed by v-bounces and pushing higher. I witnessed this on NEGG near the close on the day before the 188% climax day which allowed me to swing calls overnight which ended up being one of my best plays this year.\n\n**$GOGO**\n\nI witnessed this type of price action on the $GOGO move on Tuesday for the second leg of the move after it bounced just under vwap, basically all day until the top, at which point the price action changed until the close with profit taking. Now I believe this was a short squeeze and I made a nice profit on it, but I do not think it is over yet. I think if the price remains elevated this week it could very easily cascade into a short + gamma squeeze leading up to the oct 15 options expiry. I was not convinced yet by yesterday's price action. But today it appears as if the squeeze has not yet squoze.\n\n**The Numbers**\n\nOrtex shows that ESTIMATED short interest has increased since tuesday to roughly 15M shares which is \\~30% of the 45M share float. Now if you include all the way up to $18 calls the total oi (open interest) that hypothetically should be delta hedged by mm (market makers) from itm (in the money) calls for OCTOBER (17M shares) and NOVEMBER (14M shares) expiries adds up to \\~31M shares. So when we add ortex estimated si with the delta hedging short interest, we come to the theoretical short interest of 15M+16.8M+13.8M=45.6M shares. The total tradeable float is currently 45.3M. That puts us a hair over 100% theoretical short interest if the price stays above $18 leading into oct 15 expiry.\n\nNow these are estimates and if the market is as corrupt as I think it is, there is potential these numbers are way off but I would lean towards them being an underestimate rather than overestimate. For example, NEGG short interest was &lt;1% on ORTEX leading up to that squeeze but there is no other way to look at that move without it being a squeeze so clearly the numbers were not accurate. I know many believe this to be the case for GME. I won't pick a side for that one but at the very least, what I am fairly certain of is that we were not told the whole story for the GME squeeze and the data was not accurate.\n\n**Chart**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/prhf72otxuq71.png?width=878&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=20db44a2c8cbc030e73866fb3f1970a28851d2ef\n\nThe chart explains itself, the move happened after a pr from the company stating increased guidance and I think someone with deep pockets (lets call them moby \"giant\" dick) saw the options chain and short interest and high days to cover as an opportunity to induce a squeeze. I think they succeeded but to me the $volume suggests this is not over yet. Yesterday, Moby defended $16 shortly after open and it never returned to this price since.\n\nTypically with these squeezes the $volume climaxes on the final topping day but as you can see it is 2 days after the initial move and the volume has dropped substantially while the price is still moving up. Yesterday we say what I could describe as a stalemate between bulls and bears where the price just moved sideways for hours with almost no trades. Believe me, it was boring af to watch in real time.\n\n**Today**\n\nNow today we have pushed higher on an uptick in $ volume but still nowhere near the amount traded on Tuesday which was around 42M, so less than the float. The final climax of a squeeze typically trades several multiples of the float. Go back and fact check me with other squeezes, I dare you. The volume speaks for itself imo. Until we see at least 100-150M shares (2-3x float) traded in a day I think its safe to say that the squeeze hasnt squoze. And if ITM call option OI keeps increasing each day it is only going to add fuel to the rocketship. Ideal situation we see &gt;$4B in dollar volume on a big green day in the coming weeks which marks the climax. Now if hft pump firms get on this it could get real interesting.\n\nI will leave fundamentals DD to the other retards but all I can say is that the company is the dominant player in the airplane wifi space. I have personally used them to daytrade while on a flight last month and it worked pretty damn well for the fact I was flying through the sky. I like the stock and they have allowed me in the past to get my fix while literally on the fly.\n\nIt truly pained me to type this with my inability to handle boredom these days, so I hope someone makes money off this. I am hodlin OCT 15$ and 16$ calls. I will update this post when I sell. Good luck retards. This is not financial advice obviously and this is degenerate gambling through and through. May the squoze be with you.\n\n**Friday Update:** today so far is further confirmation for my thesis, afterhours there was a small pump from a price target with a gap up that did not fill, the floor held and the price moved up aand broke to a new high and is currently consolidating just under $19. I am more bullish than I was yesterday.",

It provides a great overview about how ibogaine (sourced from plants across Africa) can be used to help fight the opioid crisis that is plaguing North America. Natural healing is so important.

Addiction costs the government $46.5B a year alone (excluding costs to families and communities.

Ibogaine provides a gentle, painless, and very rapid detox from opioids such a heroin, methadone, OxyContin, Suboxone &amp; Subutex; stimulants like cocaine, crack and methamphetamine, as well as alcohol and many other addictive drugs\n\nThis is a really interesting testimonial from Travis Hayes as well. Very eye opening to the power of Ibogaine.\n\nIbogaine Testimonial \u2013 Travis Hayes\n\n[https://youtu.be/U5KvF\\_Hcipk](https://youtu.be/U5KvF_Hcipk)\n\nFinally for those looking for a deeper dive, Dr. Sola who's completed over 3000 treatments - has the distinction of having treated more patients with ibogaine than any other person in the world.\n\nDr Alberto Sola \u2013 Ibogaine Masterclass Keynote\n\n[https://youtu.be/eV7yd-h4xQg](https://youtu.be/eV7yd-h4xQg)",

        "selftext": "Be warned you autists.\n\n**THIS IS A LONG PLAY** and not for boomers or someone with an attention span of an unmedicated ADD kid. Also, this is a long line of letters that sometimes combine to form coherent words and text, but I\u2019ll include a TLDR.\n\nI\u2019m about to present to you, what I think will be a new major player in the Indian entertainment business; QYou Media.  \nHol up, retard, did you say India? Why yes indeed I did. We\u2019ll get back to that part in a bit.\n\nFirst let me present the company. QYou Media is an odd mix of influencer marketing, on-demand entertainment via streaming and ad-revenue, which combined does what no other company in India is doing; trying to go full circle on ads. Yes you heard me - ads.\n\nTo do that, QYou Media is split into three divisions; one division in the US whose focus is mainly on promoting movies, games and series via influencers on TikTok. And actually, they\u2019re doing quite an impressive job at that. They've made marketing for several movies and games like \"The Croods: A New Age\", \"Resident Evil Village\" and \"Trolls World Tour\", bringing in more than 300 million views to the respective TikTok channels. This goes to show that the new generation of ~~fucktards~~ kids, teens and \u201cadults\u201d are spending a lot of time on their devices, which obviously helps drive advertisements as more hours spent watching equals more attention to your product and more ad-revenue.\n\nThe other two divisions are based in India, QYou India and Chtrbox. QYou India is an entertainment based division that hosts a tv-channel with a target demographic of young Indians, of which there currently are around 650 million btw. The channel, The Q, is currently free and is supported by ads - also known as a FAST-channel (free ad-supported tv).\n\nCurrently, the channel is rated at an average of 42 GRP for Q2 and Q3 of 2021, with their other nearest competitors ranked at below 12.5. That\u2019s right, The Q is vastly more popular amongst the young demographic than the other nearest youth-oriented channels. Also, 95 million households are watching The Q.\n\nFor those of you who don\u2019t know what GRP is, it\u2019s simply an abbreviation of Go Rfreaking Pgoogle. It\u2019s a rating system kinda like the Nielsen ratings, but made by an Indian company called BARC - or BARF. Either one.\n\nThe Q is currently hosting brand advertisers like Facebook, Coca Cola, Pepsi, Unilever and Amazon, but has more than 30 brands signing up with them for the past 6 months. Actually, ad-space is in such high demand for The Q, that they\u2019re having a hard time finding any available ad-space and are currently looking to expand with more channels and a more varied programme catalogue.\n\nThe last is Chtrbox which was acquired by QYou Media. Chtrbox has a catalogue of more than 300.000 influencers which will be able to help promote both The Q, but also mainly as a platform for big brands to help promote their products. And that\u2019s important as brands increasingly are looking towards influencers to help them promote their products to an ever increasing population globally. There will be no \u201cSilence, brand\u201d memes here. In fact, influencer marketing expenditure has increased year over year and is currently sitting at 13.8 billion USD globally [https://www.statista.com/statistics/1092819/global-influencer-market-size/](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1092819/global-influencer-market-size/). That trend is likely to increase by a lot. This whole phenomenon is called Social Commerce.\n\nWhy is QYou Media a good buy in my humble opinion?\n\nIndia is a huge market in many ways. Its retail market is at 792 billion USD. Yup, that\u2019s a pretty fucking lot. It is so large in fact, that retailers like Meesho are increasing their market cap by more than 100% on a 6 month period [https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/e-tailer-meesho-raises-570mn/articleshow/86669544.cms](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/e-tailer-meesho-raises-570mn/articleshow/86669544.cms)\n\nAnd that market is exactly what QYou Media will help promote.\n\nIn fact, money spent on ads is insane and according to Statista.com; \u201ca study of global advertising expenditures found that the ad spending in 2020 reached **586.5 billion U.S. dollars**. Forecast data indicates that the ad spending worldwide will reach 691 billion U.S. dollars by the end of 2023.\u201d [https://www.statista.com/statistics/1174981/advertising-expenditure-worldwide/](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1174981/advertising-expenditure-worldwide/)\n\nOther than that, the Indian population is consuming social media services like no other place. 10% of all youtube videos are viewed in India, Whatsapp and Facebook have their largest user base in India. Instagram has their second largest user base in India, soon to overtake their largest, the US.\n\nStill not convinced how big of a deal social media is in India? After TikTok was banned in India, new services like Chingari (which QYou partners with) is trying to fill that gap. The Q launched a 2 week contest on their Chingari channel where hopeful Indians could send in their audition tapes for a show called Jurm Ka Chehra. In that 2 week time, their channel on Chingari got 1 billion interactions and almost 50.000 audition tapes. Let that sink in. 1 billion interactions in 2 weeks.\n\nThat\u2019s what makes this so powerful.\n\nNow, let\u2019s look at the financials. QYou Media, in its current form, is 3 years old and has actively reinvested every single bit of revenue back into their company, which is a thing that won\u2019t change for the foreseeable future. That IMO is a very, very good thing. They are expecting to be cash-flow positive on their operating expenses late november this year, but will still keep investing back into the company. That means that the numbers will be red for quite a bit yet. Am I worried? No.\n\nIn Q1 2021 their revenue was around 300.000 CAD. In Q3 it was 4.700.000 CAD. This trend is predicted to continue for the next few years and their CEO and co-founder Curt Marvis is expecting around 50% growth quarter over quarter.\n\nThe fiscal report for 2021 will unfortunately not reflect the massive growth that well as the fiscal year for the company is June 30th and March 31st for India and Chtrbox. The company is considering changing the fiscal year to make it easier for investors. The report for fiscal year 2021 will hit in late October and will be from June 2020 to June 2021 \u2013 ergo, the report will not reflect on the state QYou is in right now and will not include the current revenue increase to 4.7 million USD.\n\nAlright, so who runs this freaking thing? Well, we've got quite the cast here;\n\nCurt Marvis, CEO and co-founder - previously President Digital at Lionsgate\n\nG. Scott Paterson, co-founder and chairman - previously Director and early investor at Lionsgate\n\nLes Garland, co-founder - previously co-founder at MTV and VH1\n\nGlenn Ginsburg, President Influencer Marketing - previously VP of sales at Disney and VP at MTV\n\nAndy Kaplan, executive chairman - President at Sony Pictures\n\nThese are all seasoned people with experience from big companies - people, these guys now their stuff. That is why I\u2019m not worried.\n\nAlso, the fact that big brands are signing deals with these guys should be a very good sign, since they\u2019d have made their DD on the company before throwing their dollaridoos at them.\n\nThere are waaaay more things about this company than what I have written up here, but I can\u2019t be bothered to write any more. My girlfriend\u2019s boyfriend is asking for his turn on the pc and I have got crippling carpal tunnel syndrome writing this.\n\nI\u2019d strongly recommend you watch videos on their Youtube channel and especially this one: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW84FWxjBDE&amp;t=1688s&amp;ab\\_channel=QYOUMedia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW84FWxjBDE&amp;t=1688s&amp;ab_channel=QYOUMedia)\n\nEspecially the part with a possible currency integration into their transactional content sounds very interesting.\n\nTLDR:\n\nQYou Media is in a very good place to help expand big brands in India. They\u2019re continuously increasing their revenue, reinvesting as much back into the company as they can and are led by very experienced people from Lionsgate, Sony, MTV and Disney.\n\nTheir entertainment channel is currently being watched in 95 million households and with 300.000 influencers on their side, they will most likely be a major player in the coming years.\n\nGo watch this video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW84FWxjBDE&amp;t=1688s&amp;ab\\_channel=QYOUMedia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW84FWxjBDE&amp;t=1688s&amp;ab_channel=QYOUMedia)\n\nA disclaimer: I am invested in this company, but I couldn\u2019t give two piles of poo if you choose to invest in it. This is not a recommendation to buy, I\u2019m simply sharing a company that I find very interesting. Your money, your decision.",

In March 2021, Max's announced the CONEJO discovery, now spanning 3.2-km by 1.6-km and open in all directions.\u00a0CONEJO returned values greater than 5% copper from 23 rock panels varying from 5m by 5m to 1m by 1m, 66 rock panel samples returned values over 1% copper. In April 2021, URU was discovered, located 30 km south of Conejo. Sampling widths ranged from 10 to 25m, 12 returned values over 2.0% copper highlight of 5.7 % copper and 37 g/t silver.\n\nMost recently, Max announced initial assay results for SP, a new target located midway along the CESAR North 80-kilometre-long belt, in line with the four previous discoveries the URU, CONEJO, AMN and AMS zones. The reconnaissance composite grab sampling over 25-metres averaging 4.8% copper and 51 g/t silver indicates the presence of a higher copper and silver grades within each 25-metre interval, which is great news for Max. This marks the company\u2019s third discovery of 2021 along the CESAR North belt.\n\nCopper prices are on the rise due to it being the key metal for the green revolution and declining reserves. Analysts from Goldman Sachs, Bank of America and Citigroup have been firm on their bullish stance on copper over the short term. New discoveries are crucial and Max\u2019s CESAR discoveries put them in a great position to benefit from the increased demand. The company is actively mapping the rock bearing mineralization and identifying drilling targets. They have initiated the process of mineral claim approvals and drill permitting.\n\nMax is well funded with $4m cash but an underpriced market cap at only $20m. The company is managed and advised by established and proven team with in-country geologists. I think this stock is a steal at its current price with a team that has proven their ability to continuously make new high-grade discoveries.\n\nThis is not financial advice, if you\u2019re interested do your DD!",

        "selftext": "#**Introduction**\nEveryone talks about what to invest in, but they often skip a step when talking to beginners. What to invest in starts with knowing what is available. Here are the fundamental investment types I will be covering today:\n\n\n* Stocks \u2013 fractional ownership of a company sold in the form of shares\n* Bonds \u2013 a loan to a company or government that will pay interest in the future\n* Commodities \u2013 a raw material or agricultural product that can be bought or sold\n* Mutual Funds and ETFs  \u2013 containers holding many stocks, bonds, or commodities\n\n\nEach of these have their own unique set of attributes and uses. They\u2019re differentiated based on risk, specialization, and ease of use. I might go into these details in the future, but for now I want to start at the very beginning. \n\n#**Stocks**\nLet\u2019s say you own a business. You currently only have one location but would like to open another. You know your business is worth about $1 million dollars and that it costs $100,000 to open a new store. You decide to create 10,000 shares and attempt to sell them for $100 each. Each share represents a 0.01% ownership stake in the company. Let\u2019s say you sell 2,000 of the shares. Now you own 8,000 shares and the person or people you sold the shares to own 2,000. This means you own 80% of the company and the others own 20%. They paid you $200,000 for those shares which you can now use to open two new stores. \n\nSo why did the people in the example buy $200,000 worth of your business\u2019s stock? People buy stocks for two primary reasons. The first is that they expect the business to do well. A business that does well will grow and increase the value of its shares. This is called capital appreciation. If you go ahead and builds two more stores that generate the same income as the first, the value of the business will have roughly tripled. The $200,000 that was invested could now easily be worth $600,000. On the other hand, what if you tried to open two new stores and they both failed? Everyone would see that you\u2019re bad at running this business and those shares might only be worth $100,000 now. The second reason is to collect dividend payments from the business. A dividend is when a company takes a portion of its earnings and pays them out to its shareholders. These are more common among older well established businesses that have consistent income.\n\nStocks are most commonly traded on stock exchanges. The United States is home to the two largest exchanges in the world, the New York Stock Exchange, and the Nasdaq Stock Market. To buy or sell stocks yourself on the exchanges you need to go through a brokerage. This might sound like a daunting process but can usually be set up in less than 15 minutes. Once you have an account set up and money deposited buying and selling shares is nearly instantaneous. \n\n#**Bonds**\nWhen you need to make a large purchase like a new car you don\u2019t typically pay it all up front. You might not have enough money at the moment or want a way to spread the purchase out over time. To do this you get a loan. Let\u2019s say you want to buy a $20,000 car. You spend $4,000 on the down payment and agree to pay the rest over the next three years. You get to take the car home today because the loan pays the dealership the remaining amount owed. In return for lending you this money the bank is going to charge interest as you pay the loan back. Let\u2019s assume the interest rate is 3% per year. At this rate you\u2019ll end up paying the bank back about $16,751. The additional $751 is their payment for taking on the risk of loaning you that money.\n\nBonds and loans have a lot in common. They\u2019re both used to finance expensive purchases, have interest rates, and cover a set period of time. There are some differences though. The car loan was paid off in monthly payments over the course of three years. Each monthly payment paid some of the interest as well as some of the initial $16,000 principal. Let\u2019s say you\u2019re the bank. Instead of writing a car loan you use the money to buy a bond worth $16,000 at the same 3% interest rate over the same three year period. As the holder of the bond you would be entitled to interest rate payments, twice per year, for three years. Each semiannual payment would be 1.5% of $16,000 or $240. After three years the bond would mature, you would receive your last interest payment, and you would receive your entire $16,000 back.\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at how stocks and bonds compare. Both of them can be used to raise money, but they do so in significantly different ways. When you buy stock you are buying a fractional ownership in the business. You do not get your initial investment back unless the company pays dividends, or you sell your shares and give up ownership. Bonds can also be used to raise money, but they do not offer any ownership. When a company sells bonds it knows that it will have to pay them back in the future which can be costly. When it sells stock its current shareholders lose some of their ownership and therefore value. Let\u2019s say there are 100 shares of company XYZ and they decided to issue 20 more. Previously every share was worth 1% of the company, now every share is only worth 0.83% of the company. This is only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to understanding what stocks and bonds are and how they compare to each other. \n\n#**Commodities**\nStocks and bonds are each considered to be an asset class. An asset class is a group of investments that have similar characteristics and have to follow the same regulations. Stock in Apple is not the exact same as stock in Visa, but they serve the same purpose, can be traded the same way, and follow the same rules. The same can be said about bonds. A bond that takes seven years to mature is not the exact same as one that takes ten years, but they are both going to be structured the same. The third asset class we will be covering are commodities.\n\nA commodity is a raw material or primary agricultural product. These products are essentially the same regardless of where they come from. Copper, gold, oil, iron, and lumber are all examples of raw material commodities. Corn, soybeans, meat, and milk are all agricultural commodities. There may be minor fluctuations in quality, but in order to be traded on exchanges they need to meet a minimum requirement. These materials form the foundation of almost everything our economy produces. \n\nUnlike with stocks or bonds, commodities are not used as a way to raise money. They\u2019re traded as a way to protect the producer from risk. Let\u2019s say you can grow 10,000 bushels of wheat in a good year. You would like to get at least $8 per bushel once it\u2019s harvested. What happens if there is a perfect year for crops and everyone else has produced more than expected. This increase in supply pushes the price lower because buyers have more to choose from. The price per bushel is now only $5. In this situation you would only earn 63% as much as you were forecasting which can be hard to handle as a business. In order to protect yourself from this situation you might want to create a contract with a wheat buyer on an exchange. This contract could include you agreeing to sell your wheat for $7 per bushel at the end of the summer. This is less than the $8 you are hoping for, but it will be guaranteed. Assuming the person buying the contract was also expecting wheat to be worth $8 per bushel, they will see this as a good deal. When prices for materials are known in advance it\u2019s easier to budget and plan which is a benefit for both parties. \n\nOdds are you aren\u2019t looking to buy or sell massive quantities of wheat, or any other raw materials. If you\u2019re looking at investing in commodities it\u2019s probably going to be in oil, gold, or common metals like copper. Thankfully you don\u2019t need to be directly trading contracts with the producers to do this. There are shares that can be bought and sold like stocks on a stock exchange. Each share represents a fixed amount of the commodity, such as an ounce of gold or a barrel of oil. The primary reason people buy commodities is to protect themselves from inflation. This works because as the price of things increase, the price of the raw materials must also increase. \n\n#**Mutual Funds and Exchange Traded Funds**\nNow that you have an idea of what the three most popular asset classes are, let\u2019s take a look at a couple of the tools associated with them. Mutual funds and ETFs are both collections of stocks, bonds, or commodities that can be traded. Instead of hand selecting companies, bonds, or commodities these collections allow you to purchase a fraction of many of them all at once. \n\nThe S&amp;P 500 is an index that tracks 500 of the largest companies in the United States. It\u2019s often used as a general gauge for the US economy. If the economy is doing well and growing, this index will also be growing. Instead of having to purchase shares in all 500 businesses by hand there are numerous ETFs that will do that for you. The most popular one has a ticker name of SPY. When you buy a share of SPY, 5.9% of your money is being put in Apple stock, 2.29% is put into Facebook stock, and so on. The larger the company the larger the fraction of your money they get. This is called a market cap weighed fund. \n\nSPY is an ETF which means you can buy or sell it at any time with ease. FXAIX also covers the companies of the S&amp;P 500, but it is a mutual fund. What is the difference between the two? Well there\u2019s not much. The most noticeable one is that mutual funds cannot be traded throughout the day. They can only be purchased at the end of the day. Although not a rule, mutual funds are much more likely to be actively managed than an ETF. Active management means there is a professional portfolio manager in charge of selecting when to buy or sell the things the mutual fund holds. ETFs are much more likely to be passively managed. This means they track a set list of stocks automatically.\n\n#**Conclusion**\nThese four categories make up a vast majority of investments. Being able to understand how each of them work is crucial in making your own investment choices. Hopefully this post was able to bring up even more questions than it answered if you're new. Now that you know what the major fundamental asset classes are you might ask yourself why you would choose one over the other. This was touched on, but I never went into detail on the risk, return, history, or combination of them. All of these ideas warrant their own posts which may come in the future. Thank you for reading.\n\n#**Mild subreddit self-promotion:**\nIf you enjoy these kinds of posts I created my own subreddit r/FinancialAnalysis where I post detailed write ups on various investing topics.",
