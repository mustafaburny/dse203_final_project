TheStreet score**\n\nThe first filtering step is to get stocks with Buy recommendation at TheStreet stock screener. I\u2019m only keeping stocks with A+, A or A- rating (top ones), although A-, B+, B and B- are Buys as well.\n\nFrom thestreet.com:\n\n***A (Excellent)*** *\u2013  The stock has an excellent track record for maximizing performance  while minimizing risk, thus delivering the best possible combination of  total return on investment and reduced volatility. It has made the most  of the recent economic environment to maximize risk-adjusted returns  compared to other stocks. While past performance is just an indication \u2014  not a guarantee \u2014 we believe this fund is among the most likely to  deliver superior performance relative to risk in the future as well.*\n\nAnd about the methodology:\n\n*TheStreet  Ratings\u2019 stock model projects a stock\u2019s total return potential over a  12-month period including both price appreciation and* ***dividends***\\*.  Our Buy, Hold or Sell ratings designate how we expect these stocks to  perform against a general benchmark of the equities market and interest  rates. While our model is quantitative, it utilizes both\\* ***subjective*** *and* ***objective*** *elements.  For instance, subjective elements include expected equities market  returns, future interest rates, implied industry outlook and forecasted  company earnings. Objective elements include volatility of past  operating revenues, financial strength, and company cash flows.*\n\n**2. Zacks Rank**\n\nIt  is required that the Zacks Rank is Hold, Buy or Strong Buy (so we\u2019re  avoiding stocks with Sell and Strong Sell recommendations). The Zacks  Rating utilizes a completely different system, based on company  earnings-related data, in particular earnings estimate revisions and  earnings surprises, to predict profitability of holding the company\u2019s  shares.\n\n**3. Weiss Ratings recommendation**\n\nWe\u2019re only keeping stocks with Buy (B) or Strong Buy (A) recommendation.\n\nWjat are these scores? This is what I found at their website:\n\n*\u201cA\u201d Rating:* ***Excellent.*** *The  company\u2019s stock has an excellent track record for providing strong  performance with lower-than-average risk, and it is trading at a price  that represents good value relative to the company\u2019s earnings prospects.  While past performance is no guarantee of future results, our opinion  is that this stock is among the most likely to deliver superior  performance relative to risk in the future. Of course, even the best  stocks can decline in a down market. But our \u201cA\u201d rating can generally be  considered the equivalent of a \u201c****Strong Buy****\u201c.*\n\n*\u201cB\u201d rating:* ***Good.*** *The  company\u2019s stock has a good track record for delivering a balance of  performance and risk. While the risk-adjusted performance of any stock  is subject to change, our opinion is that this stock is a good value,  with good prospects for outperforming the market. Although even good  investments can decline in a down market, our \u201cB\u201d rating is considered  the equivalent of a \u201c****Buy****\u201c.*\n\n**4.  Yahoo Finance  recommendation and target price**\n\nIt is required that the Yahoo Finance  stock recommendation is at least mixed Buy/Hold from experts.  Additionally, the predicted target price (average, from experts) should  be at least 5% higher than the current one.\n\n**5. MarketBeat recommendation and taget price**\n\nSimilar to Yahoo Finance, it is required that the MarketBeat stock recommendation is at least mixed Buy/Hold. Additionally, the  predicted target price (average, from experts) should be at least 5%  higher than the current valuation.\n\n**6. Piotroski F-Score**\n\nThe  Piotroski score is a number between 0-9 that reflects nine criteria  used to determine the strength of a company\u2019s financial situation,  including profitability, leverage or operating efficiency. Zero is the  worst value and nine is the best. As we can read in Piotroski's paper from 2000:\n\n*In addition, an investment strategy that buys expected winners and shorts expected losers generates a* ***23% annual return*** *between 1976 and 1996, and the strategy appears to be robust across time and to controls for alternative investment strategies.*\n\nIt is required that the score is 4 or higher. The values were retrieved from gurufocus website.\n\n**7. Moody\u2019s Daily Credit Risk**\n\nMoody\u2019s  Daily Credit Risk Score is a 1-10 score, which provides a  forward-looking, one-year measure of credit risk. It is updated daily  and takes into account day-to-day market movements compared to a  company\u2019s liabilities.\n\nThe value is retrieved from Business Insider's website and is expected to be in the range of 1-6.\n\n**8. InvestorsObserver Overall Score**\n\nThe rank has a value in between 0 and 100. It takes into account both **technical** analysis and **fundamental**  stock data. An Overall Rank of N means that a given company is rated  above N% of stocks, therefore the higher the number, the better. My  requirement is that the company has InvestorsObserver Overall score of  at least 50. From their website:\n\n*The  Overall Score combines our two technical scores (Short Term and Long  Term) with our Fundamental Score into one metric. This makes our overall  score a great place to start when evaluating stocks, regardless of your  investing style.*\n\n*A  low score doesn\u2019t necessarily mean a stock is likely to go down, just  that our system doesn\u2019t think there\u2019s much of a bullish case for it.*\n\nPlease note that the company profile data (short description) was taken from  tradingview website (sometimes I shortened it) and dividend data was retrieved from MarketBeat.\n\nI  hope you enjoyed the reading. What do you think about this stock  selection and the strategy? Feel free to leave a comment below.\n\n*Michael*\n\nDisclosures:\n\n* What you see here is my      personal opinion, my own investments and should not be treated as      investing advice\n* I\u2019m an amateur investor",

TheStreet score**\n\nThe first filtering step is to get stocks with Buy recommendation at TheStreet stock screener ([https://www.thestreet.com/r/ratings/reports/ir-screener.html)](https://www.thestreet.com/r/ratings/reports/ir-screener.html). I\u2019m only keeping stocks with A+, A or A- rating (top ones), although A-, B+, B and B- are Buys as well.\n\nFrom thestreet.com:\n\n***A (Excellent)*** *\u2013 The stock has an excellent track  record for maximizing performance while minimizing risk, thus delivering  the best possible combination of total return on investment and reduced  volatility. It has made the most of the recent economic environment to  maximize risk-adjusted returns compared to other stocks. While past  performance is just an indication \u2014 not a guarantee \u2014 we believe this  fund is among the most likely to deliver superior performance relative  to risk in the future as well.*\n\nAnd about the methodology (source: https://www.thestreet.com/r/ratings/reports/detail/T.html):\n\n*TheStreet Ratings\u2019 stock model projects a stock\u2019s total  return potential over a 12-month period including both price  appreciation and* ***dividends****. Our Buy, Hold or Sell  ratings designate how we expect these stocks to perform against a  general benchmark of the equities market and interest rates. While our  model is quantitative, it utilizes both* ***subjective*** *and* ***objective***  *elements. For instance, subjective elements include expected equities  market returns, future interest rates, implied industry outlook and  forecasted company earnings. Objective elements include volatility of  past operating revenues, financial strength, and company cash flows.*\n\n**2. Zacks Rank**\n\nIt is required that the Zacks Rank is Hold, Buy or Strong Buy (so  we\u2019re avoiding stocks with Sell and Strong Sell recommendations). The  Zacks Rating utilizes a completely different system, based on company  earnings-related data, in particular earnings estimate revisions and  earnings surprises, to predict profitability of holding the company\u2019s  shares. More from https://www.zacks.com/education/stock-education/zacks-rank-guide-6:\n\n*A portfolio of Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks has beaten the  market in 26 of the last 31 years with an average annual return of* ***+24.3%*** *a year; more than double that of the S&amp;P 500\u2019s +10.6% .*\n\n**3. Weiss Ratings recommendation**\n\nWe\u2019re only keeping stocks with Buy (B) or Strong Buy (A) recommendation.\n\nWjat are these scores? This is what I found at their website ([https://weissratings.com/help/rating-definitions](https://weissratings.com/help/rating-definitions)):\n\n*\u201cA\u201d Rating:* ***Excellent.*** *The company\u2019s stock has  an excellent track record for providing strong performance with  lower-than-average risk, and it is trading at a price that represents  good value relative to the company\u2019s earnings prospects. While past  performance is no guarantee of future results, our opinion is that this  stock is among the most likely to deliver superior performance relative  to risk in the future. Of course, even the best stocks can decline in a  down market. But our \u201cA\u201d rating can generally be considered the  equivalent of a \u201c****Strong Buy****\u201c.*\n\n*\u201cB\u201d rating:* ***Good.*** *The company\u2019s stock has a good  track record for delivering a balance of performance and risk. While  the risk-adjusted performance of any stock is subject to change, our  opinion is that this stock is a good value, with good prospects for  outperforming the market. Although even good investments can decline in a  down market, our \u201cB\u201d rating is considered the equivalent of a \u201c****Buy****\u201c.*\n\n**4. \u00a0Yahoo Finance\u00a0 recommendation and target price**\n\nIt is required that the [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/)  stock recommendation is at least mixed Buy/Hold from experts.  Additionally, the predicted target price (average, from experts) should  be at least 5% higher than the current one.\n\n**5. MarketBeat recommendation and taget price**\n\nSimilar to Yahoo Finance, it is required that the [MarketBeat](https://www.marketbeat.com/)  stock recommendation is at least mixed Buy/Hold. Additionally, the  predicted target price (average, from experts) should be at least 5%  higher than the current valuation.\n\n**6. Piotroski F-Score**\n\nThe Piotroski score is a number between 0-9 that reflects  nine criteria used to determine the strength of a company\u2019s financial  situation, including profitability, leverage or operating efficiency.  Zero is the worst value and nine is the best. As we can read in[ Piotroski\u2019s paper](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/9dc9/b030da18ab28d1e1a1bbf7e33fb5911f189e.pdf) from 2000:\n\n*In addition, an investment strategy that buys expected winners and shorts expected losers generates a* ***23% annual return*** *between 1976 and 1996, and the strategy appears to be robust across time and to controls for alternative investment strategies.*\n\nIt is required that the score is 4 or higher. The values were retrieved from [https://www.gurufocus.com](https://www.gurufocus.com/).\n\n**7. Moody\u2019s Daily Credit Risk**\n\nMoody\u2019s Daily Credit Risk Score is a 1-10 score, which  provides a forward-looking, one-year measure of credit risk. It is  updated daily and takes into account day-to-day market movements  compared to a company\u2019s liabilities.\n\nThe value is retrieved from[ https://markets.businessinsider.com and is expected to be in the range of 1-6. ](https://markets.businessinsider.com/)\n\n**8. InvestorsObserver Overall Score**\n\nThe rank has a value in between 0 and 100. It takes into account both **technical** analysis and **fundamental**  stock data. An Overall Rank of N means that a given company is rated  above N% of stocks, therefore the higher the number, the better. My  requirement is that the company has InvestorsObserver Overall score of  at least 50.\n\nMore detailed explanation from [https://www.investorsobserver.com/learning-center/what-the-scores-mean/what-does-the-overall-score-mean](https://www.investorsobserver.com/learning-center/what-the-scores-mean/what-does-the-overall-score-mean):\n\n*The Overall Score combines our two technical scores  (Short Term and Long Term) with our Fundamental Score into one metric.  This makes our overall score a great place to start when evaluating  stocks, regardless of your investing style.*\n\n*A low score doesn\u2019t necessarily mean a stock is likely  to go down, just that our system doesn\u2019t think there\u2019s much of a bullish  case for it.*\n\nPlease note that the company profile data (short description) was taken from\u00a0 [https://www.tradingview.com](https://www.tradingview.com/) (sometimes I shortened it) and dividend data was retrieved from MarketBeat.\n\nI hope you enjoyed the reading.

Over the next 2 weeks the 200 DSMA rises from 562.36 to 572.41 assuming the stock is unchanged at 578. That price action, if maintained, places the probability outcome at 0.000022%. In other words - It won't happen. What looks likely is a reversion back to 1.09-1.16 times over the next 2 weeks which would price the stock anywhere from 623.93-663.99.

It operates through the following reportable segments:  Mobile Products and Infrastructure &amp; Defense Products. The firm\u2019s  products include amplifiers, control products, discrete transistors,  filters \\&amp;amp; duplexers, frequency converters \\&amp;amp; sources,  integrated products, optical components, passives, power management  products, switches, and wireless connectivity products. The company was  founded on December 13, 2013 and is headquartered in Greensboro, NC.  \n**Dividend**: NA  \n**Current valuation**: $188.32\n\n**Valuation of entry parameters:**\n\nTheStreet score: A-  \nZacks Rank: Buy  \nWeiss Ratings recommendation: Buy  \nYahoo Finance recommendation: Buy  \nMarketBeat recommendation: Buy  \nYahoo Finance target price: $208.26  \nMarketBeat target price: $205.14  \nPiotroski F-Score: 8  \nMoody\u2019s Daily Credit Risk: 6  \nInvestorsObserver Overall Score: 74  \nYahoo Finance 1 year change: 10.59%\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Now, a few words on the criteria I\u2019m using and sources of data.**\n\n**1. TheStreet score**\n\nThe first filtering step is to get stocks with Buy recommendation at TheStreet stock screener. I\u2019m only keeping stocks with A+, A or A- rating (top ones), although A-, B+, B and B- are Buys as well.\n\nFrom thestreet.com:\n\n***A (Excellent)*** *\u2013  The stock has an excellent track record for maximizing performance  while minimizing risk, thus delivering the best possible combination of  total return on investment and reduced volatility. It has made the most  of the recent economic environment to maximize risk-adjusted returns  compared to other stocks. While past performance is just an indication \u2014  not a guarantee \u2014 we believe this fund is among the most likely to  deliver superior performance relative to risk in the future as well.*\n\nAnd about the methodology:\n\n*TheStreet  Ratings\u2019 stock model projects a stock\u2019s total return potential over a  12-month period including both price appreciation and* ***dividends***\\*.  Our Buy, Hold or Sell ratings designate how we expect these stocks to  perform against a general benchmark of the equities market and interest  rates. While our model is quantitative, it utilizes both\\* ***subjective*** *and* ***objective*** *elements.  For instance, subjective elements include expected equities market  returns, future interest rates, implied industry outlook and forecasted  company earnings. Objective elements include volatility of past  operating revenues, financial strength, and company cash flows.*\n\n**2. Zacks Rank**\n\nIt  is required that the Zacks Rank is Hold, Buy or Strong Buy (so we\u2019re  avoiding stocks with Sell and Strong Sell recommendations). The Zacks  Rating utilizes a completely different system, based on company  earnings-related data, in particular earnings estimate revisions and  earnings surprises, to predict profitability of holding the company\u2019s  shares.\n\n**3. Weiss Ratings recommendation**\n\nWe\u2019re only keeping stocks with Buy (B) or Strong Buy (A) recommendation.\n\nWjat are these scores? This is what I found at their website:\n\n*\u201cA\u201d Rating:* ***Excellent.*** *The  company\u2019s stock has an excellent track record for providing strong  performance with lower-than-average risk, and it is trading at a price  that represents good value relative to the company\u2019s earnings prospects.  While past performance is no guarantee of future results, our opinion  is that this stock is among the most likely to deliver superior  performance relative to risk in the future. Of course, even the best  stocks can decline in a down market. But our \u201cA\u201d rating can generally be  considered the equivalent of a \u201c****Strong Buy****\u201c.*\n\n*\u201cB\u201d rating:* ***Good.*** *The  company\u2019s stock has a good track record for delivering a balance of  performance and risk. While the risk-adjusted performance of any stock  is subject to change, our opinion is that this stock is a good value,  with good prospects for outperforming the market. Although even good  investments can decline in a down market, our \u201cB\u201d rating is considered  the equivalent of a \u201c****Buy****\u201c.*\n\n**4.  Yahoo Finance  recommendation and target price**\n\nIt is required that the Yahoo Finance  stock recommendation is at least mixed Buy/Hold from experts.  Additionally, the predicted target price (average, from experts) should  be at least 5% higher than the current one.\n\n**5. MarketBeat recommendation and taget price**\n\nSimilar to Yahoo Finance, it is required that the MarketBeat stock recommendation is at least mixed Buy/Hold. Additionally, the  predicted target price (average, from experts) should be at least 5%  higher than the current valuation.\n\n**6. Piotroski F-Score**\n\nThe  Piotroski score is a number between 0-9 that reflects nine criteria  used to determine the strength of a company\u2019s financial situation,  including profitability, leverage or operating efficiency. Zero is the  worst value and nine is the best. As we can read in Piotroski's paper from 2000:\n\n*In addition, an investment strategy that buys expected winners and shorts expected losers generates a* ***23% annual return*** *between 1976 and 1996, and the strategy appears to be robust across time and to controls for alternative investment strategies.*\n\nIt is required that the score is 4 or higher. The values were retrieved from gurufocus website.\n\n**7. Moody\u2019s Daily Credit Risk**\n\nMoody\u2019s  Daily Credit Risk Score is a 1-10 score, which provides a  forward-looking, one-year measure of credit risk. It is updated daily  and takes into account day-to-day market movements compared to a  company\u2019s liabilities.\n\nThe value is retrieved from Business Insider's website and is expected to be in the range of 1-6.\n\n**8. InvestorsObserver Overall Score**\n\nThe rank has a value in between 0 and 100. It takes into account both **technical** analysis and **fundamental**  stock data. An Overall Rank of N means that a given company is rated  above N% of stocks, therefore the higher the number, the better. My  requirement is that the company has InvestorsObserver Overall score of  at least 50. From their website:\n\n*The  Overall Score combines our two technical scores (Short Term and Long  Term) with our Fundamental Score into one metric. This makes our overall  score a great place to start when evaluating stocks, regardless of your  investing style.*\n\n*A  low score doesn\u2019t necessarily mean a stock is likely to go down, just  that our system doesn\u2019t think there\u2019s much of a bullish case for it.*\n\nPlease note that the company profile data (short description) was taken from  tradingview website (sometimes I shortened it) and dividend data was retrieved from MarketBeat.\n\nI  hope you enjoyed the reading.

TheStreet score**\n\nThe first filtering step is to get stocks with Buy recommendation at TheStreet stock screener ([https://www.thestreet.com/r/ratings/reports/ir-screener.html)](https://www.thestreet.com/r/ratings/reports/ir-screener.html). I\u2019m only keeping stocks with A+, A or A- rating (top ones), although A-, B+, B and B- are Buys as well.\n\nFrom thestreet.com:\n\n***A (Excellent)*** *\u2013 The stock has an excellent track  record for maximizing performance while minimizing risk, thus delivering  the best possible combination of total return on investment and reduced  volatility. It has made the most of the recent economic environment to  maximize risk-adjusted returns compared to other stocks. While past  performance is just an indication \u2014 not a guarantee \u2014 we believe this  fund is among the most likely to deliver superior performance relative  to risk in the future as well.*\n\nAnd about the methodology (source: https://www.thestreet.com/r/ratings/reports/detail/T.html):\n\n*TheStreet Ratings\u2019 stock model projects a stock\u2019s total  return potential over a 12-month period including both price  appreciation and* ***dividends****. Our Buy, Hold or Sell  ratings designate how we expect these stocks to perform against a  general benchmark of the equities market and interest rates. While our  model is quantitative, it utilizes both* ***subjective*** *and* ***objective***  *elements. For instance, subjective elements include expected equities  market returns, future interest rates, implied industry outlook and  forecasted company earnings. Objective elements include volatility of  past operating revenues, financial strength, and company cash flows.*\n\n**2. Zacks Rank**\n\nIt is required that the Zacks Rank is Hold, Buy or Strong Buy (so  we\u2019re avoiding stocks with Sell and Strong Sell recommendations). The  Zacks Rating utilizes a completely different system, based on company  earnings-related data, in particular earnings estimate revisions and  earnings surprises, to predict profitability of holding the company\u2019s  shares. More from https://www.zacks.com/education/stock-education/zacks-rank-guide-6:\n\n*A portfolio of Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks has beaten the  market in 26 of the last 31 years with an average annual return of* ***+24.3%*** *a year; more than double that of the S&amp;P 500\u2019s +10.6% .*\n\n**3. Weiss Ratings recommendation**\n\nWe\u2019re only keeping stocks with Buy (B) or Strong Buy (A) recommendation.\n\nWjat are these scores? This is what I found at their website ([https://weissratings.com/help/rating-definitions](https://weissratings.com/help/rating-definitions)):\n\n*\u201cA\u201d Rating:* ***Excellent.*** *The company\u2019s stock has  an excellent track record for providing strong performance with  lower-than-average risk, and it is trading at a price that represents  good value relative to the company\u2019s earnings prospects. While past  performance is no guarantee of future results, our opinion is that this  stock is among the most likely to deliver superior performance relative  to risk in the future. Of course, even the best stocks can decline in a  down market. But our \u201cA\u201d rating can generally be considered the  equivalent of a \u201c****Strong Buy****\u201c.*\n\n*\u201cB\u201d rating:* ***Good.*** *The company\u2019s stock has a good  track record for delivering a balance of performance and risk. While  the risk-adjusted performance of any stock is subject to change, our  opinion is that this stock is a good value, with good prospects for  outperforming the market. Although even good investments can decline in a  down market, our \u201cB\u201d rating is considered the equivalent of a \u201c****Buy****\u201c.*\n\n**4. \u00a0Yahoo Finance\u00a0 recommendation and target price**\n\nIt is required that the [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/)  stock recommendation is at least mixed Buy/Hold from experts.  Additionally, the predicted target price (average, from experts) should  be at least 5% higher than the current one.\n\n**5. MarketBeat recommendation and taget price**\n\nSimilar to Yahoo Finance, it is required that the [MarketBeat](https://www.marketbeat.com/)  stock recommendation is at least mixed Buy/Hold. Additionally, the  predicted target price (average, from experts) should be at least 5%  higher than the current valuation.\n\n**6. Piotroski F-Score**\n\nThe Piotroski score is a number between 0-9 that reflects  nine criteria used to determine the strength of a company\u2019s financial  situation, including profitability, leverage or operating efficiency.  Zero is the worst value and nine is the best. As we can read in[ Piotroski\u2019s paper](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/9dc9/b030da18ab28d1e1a1bbf7e33fb5911f189e.pdf) from 2000:\n\n*In addition, an investment strategy that buys expected winners and shorts expected losers generates a* ***23% annual return*** *between 1976 and 1996, and the strategy appears to be robust across time and to controls for alternative investment strategies.*\n\nIt is required that the score is 4 or higher. The values were retrieved from [https://www.gurufocus.com](https://www.gurufocus.com/).\n\n**7. Moody\u2019s Daily Credit Risk**\n\nMoody\u2019s Daily Credit Risk Score is a 1-10 score, which  provides a forward-looking, one-year measure of credit risk. It is  updated daily and takes into account day-to-day market movements  compared to a company\u2019s liabilities.\n\nThe value is retrieved from[ https://markets.businessinsider.com and is expected to be in the range of 1-6. ](https://markets.businessinsider.com/)\n\n**8. InvestorsObserver Overall Score**\n\nThe rank has a value in between 0 and 100. It takes into account both **technical** analysis and **fundamental**  stock data. An Overall Rank of N means that a given company is rated  above N% of stocks, therefore the higher the number, the better. My  requirement is that the company has InvestorsObserver Overall score of  at least 50.\n\nMore detailed explanation from [https://www.investorsobserver.com/learning-center/what-the-scores-mean/what-does-the-overall-score-mean](https://www.investorsobserver.com/learning-center/what-the-scores-mean/what-does-the-overall-score-mean):\n\n*The Overall Score combines our two technical scores  (Short Term and Long Term) with our Fundamental Score into one metric.  This makes our overall score a great place to start when evaluating  stocks, regardless of your investing style.*\n\n*A low score doesn\u2019t necessarily mean a stock is likely  to go down, just that our system doesn\u2019t think there\u2019s much of a bullish  case for it.*\n\nPlease note that the company profile data (short description) was taken from\u00a0 [https://www.tradingview.com](https://www.tradingview.com/) (sometimes I shortened it) and dividend data was retrieved from MarketBeat.\n\nI hope you enjoyed the reading.

        "selftext": " LRCX - Based on the most recent 5 years of trading data this stock traded between .71 and 1.67 times the 200 SDMA.

Over the next 2 weeks the 200 DSMA rises from 562.36 to 572.41 assuming the stock is unchanged at 578. That price action, if maintained, places the probability outcome at 0.000022%. In other words - It won't happen. What looks likely is a reversion back to 1.09-1.16 times over the next 2 weeks which would price the stock anywhere from 623.93-663.99. As such, I would encourage many to ignore the recent price action and go out and buy the stock at a great entry price.",
