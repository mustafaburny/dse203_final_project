        "selftext": " Calls got burned\n\nWhat do yall think we will see tomorrow ? Recovery ? More red? Rally?\n\nFor me these are the 3 scenarios I see-\n\n1. So the markets were spoked about bidens capital gains tax increase, thus a heavy sell off that happened today , I think that tomorrow the markets will rally in the morning followed by a steep sell off and spend the rest of the day climbing back up and recovering the value they lost tdy.\n2. The market will continue to bleed through tomorrow which would be good as it would help correct a lot of stocks that have been rallying hard these past few weeks.( SPY , homedepot and nvidia are the main ones im looking at ) . Not expecting huge correction maybe another 1-2% drop overall, this is under the assumption that the market will bleed from the tax news from today plus well tomorrow is a friday and they tend be nice sell offs.\n\n3)Super bullish , the price drop from today is the market already adding in the news for the tax hike . Tomorrow will be a strong rally to end the week off on a well note . Tech stocks such as tesla will have tested the 710 support and bounced , apple will test 131 support and bounce ending under 135 , and rest of tech will follow suit as their earnings reports come out next week. This scenario is assuming that the correction from earlier this week was all that was need and this tax hike rumor just scared some people , other than that tomo will have some good rallies.\n\nIm thinking either scenarios 1 or 3 play out but then again I am still very bullish especially with earnings plays happening next week .\n\nNow really quickly on some issues -\n\nLook we arent dumb we know damn well the tax increase wont be passed , I can bet one of your balls that joe manchin would vote no to this increase . But joe biden will discuss this next week on thursday or someday next week(ik he has a speech i just forgot which day ) in that speech he is goin to talk about this tax proposal . This will inevitably lead to a whole market shit storm so get ya cash ready folks , its about to be march all over again.\n\nDamn can we ever get a break? March was hell, april is turning into hell and May will probably be volatile as the last too as well. BUt anyway back to it\n\nSo this whats going to happen\n\nJoe mama( yes let me be childish) err i mean biden will talk about this tax increase , his voters are going to support him\n\nJoe biden supporter -\" yeah daddy joe fuck the rich\"\n\nThe house creates the bill and passes it , then in the senate it gets rejected. No republican will support this bill, but that doesnt matter in the house buttttt when we get into the senate we have papa manchin who is going to vote no on the bill unless its edited or something of that nature. This would be a win for everyone in the stock market and congress. Democrats can say look we tried but the republicans dont want to help yall and then they can use manchin as scapegoat.\n\nLook i clown on anyone idc what or who you are , also this has happened many times throughout politics , in obamas time, trumps, bushes, etc .",
