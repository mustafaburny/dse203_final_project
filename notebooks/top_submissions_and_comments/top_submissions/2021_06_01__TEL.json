The rest originated from housewares.\n\n- it\u2019s very pandemic/crisis proof because of being able to draw down on waitlists, according to the FT: \u201cSoho House has been able to continue its aggressive expansion through a mixture of cost cuts, fundraising and incoming membership fees.\n\n\u201cOur membership model is pretty robust through a serious crisis,\u201d said Mr Jones, who reckoned that the lengthy wait to become a member \u2014 up to 18 months in some cases \u2014 put people off cancelling.\u201d\n\nHe also told CITY A.M.; \u2018if the business needed more money post-pandemic, it would let in its \u201chuge\u201d waiting list of 50,000 people.\u2019\n\n- because of this current members are also reluctant to give up their membership because it\u2019s so difficult to get in to start with \n\nNow if you don\u2019t mind I\u2019m going to go back to drinking my $9 matcha latte at the New York one.",

        "selftext": "Howdy y'all. Are you a farmer hoping to make more profit on growing tobacco plants? Or maybe you\u2019re just someone who likes boobs? In either case, you might be curious about what this cowboy bet the farm on when he visited the town\u2019s saloon earlier this year - Collplant ($CLGN). *(disclaimer: When a cowboy starts yelling about a stock while stumbling out of a saloon, it\u2019s probably smart to only use it for entertainment purposes and do your own research.)*\n\n**What is Collplant?**\n\nThey are a small biotech company based in Israel that has developed a way of producing rhCollagen from genetically-engineered tobacco plants. Collagen is used in both regenerative and aesthetic medicine. Compared to animal-based collagen, the company claims theirs is both better at cell-binding and has lower risk of pathogens or adverse immune responses. That\u2019s a relief since the local sheriff told me some of the other cowboys have had half their cattle snatched up by the collagen thieves recently.\n\nTheir original usage of collagen has been for products involving advanced wound care and tissue repair. These are commercially available in a few eastern European countries. However, they haven\u2019t generated more than $1-2M/year in revenue from them and I\u2019m not sure if/when it might get FDA approval in the US. That brings me to the juicer product field: medical aesthetics!\n\nOn 2/8/2021, Collplant announced a development and commercialization agreement with Abbvie ($ABBV) for dermal and soft tissue fillers with the following benefits:\n\n* $14M upfront payment (already received)\n* Up to $89M additional milestone payments\n* Royalty payments on future product sales\n* Payment for manufacture and supply of the rhCollagen\n\nCollplant is also working on breast implants: both injectable and 3D bioprinted ones that use their rhCollagen. They have been working on research and prototypes for a few years and recently announced a joint development agreement with 3D-systems ($DDD) for this. So we might not just get DD-sized boobs, but also $DDD-sized ones! Their [page](https://collplant.com/products/breast-implants/) explains how the implants are basically temporary scaffolds that would gradually be replaced by newly grown natural breast tissue. So, the augmented boobs would actually be as good as the real thing! This also has potential to help breast cancer survivors via reconstructive procedures.\n\n**Key Statistics**\n\n* Market cap: \\~$200M\n* P/E (ttm): 34\n* Cash on hand as of 3/31: $50M\n* Long-term debt as of 3/31: 0\n\nThe $50M of cash reserves is enough to fund over 3 years worth of operating expenses without any revenue or share dilution, based on the $3.6M spent in 2021 Q1 ([earnings release](https://ir.collplant.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/108/collplant-biotechnologies-reports-first-quarter-2021)). The cash reserves mostly came from the initial $14M ABBV payment and a $35M secondary share offering earlier this year. This puts the company in a strong financial position, considering that they also stand to gain significant revenue from the ABBV deal and still get a bit of money from the wound care products. There could also be new deals/products announced in the future that would bring in more money.\n\n**Risks**\n\n* This is a small biotech company, which is inherently risky.\n* The company had a licensing and development agreement with United Therapeutics ($UTHR) for organ printing (lungs, kidneys, etc.) R&amp;D, but this was unexpectedly cancelled by UTHR earlier this year. This used to be Collplant\u2019s one source of revenue besides the wound care product sales, which highlights the risks of relying on a handful of other companies for revenue via special deals instead of direct product sales.\n* Competitors in the space of medical aesthetics and organ printing might develop superior solutions that don\u2019t use any collagen.\n* The company R&amp;D center is located in Rehovot, Israel - about 30 miles north of the Gaza border. I think rockets sometimes fly over that area on their way to Tel Aviv.\n\n**A few possible outcomes:**\n\n1. Deals with ABBV and DDD go reasonably well, wound care sales increase slowly, and CLGN stock has a peaceful decade, maybe going up 3-4x in the next 10 years.\n2. 3D printing or biotech business (maybe one currently working with Collplant) buys out the company for 2x current value (buyouts for small tech companies usually involve huge premiums).\n3. Collplant becomes a meme stock. The apes like boobs, especially $DDD-sized boobs. Maybe they also think it\u2019s funny that it comes from tobacco. Collplant to the moon! They take advantage of a 10x stock price increase to fund moon-based collagen research that fails and then crash back to the current price.\n4. ABBV suddenly cancels the development agreement. DDD follows suit. Wound care product sales wither away to 0. Cash reserve dwindles over several years, shareholders are diluted into oblivion, and I am ruined.\n\n**So did you actually bet the farm on it? Or was it more like a large garden patch?**\n\nI bought 30k shares at an average cost basis of $16. $480k can probably buy a few acres of farmland somewhere in the Midwest. Or it might be able to buy a small garden patch in the SF bay area if patch inspection is waived. This is risky, but I\u2019m a Collplant Cowboy!",

The neighborhood convenience store also offers an extensive collection of organic beer and wine in addition to a counter deli where customers can order freshly prepared vegan sandwiches, eccentric toast, carrot lox bagels, or containers of deli items such as marinated tofu, chickpea tuna salad, or eggless quiche. \n\n\nAfter appointing Kenney as its chief culinary officer and signing a five-year partnership agreement with Kenny\u2019s lifestyle company Matthew Kenney Cuisine (MKC), Canadian plant-based e-commerce platform PlantX acquired the New Deli brand along with its brick-and-mortar store. The company will work in collaboration with Kenney to expand the New Deli concept across North America. Over the next three months, the team will open corporate stores in San Diego, CA, Tel Aviv, Israel, and Squamish, BC, with plans to be in every major city across Canada\u2014including Vancouver, Toronto, Montreal, Calgary, Edmonton, Ottawa, and Victoria\u2014by the end of the year. PlantX also expects more than 100 franchise locations to be sold over the next 12 months. All New Deli stores will be rebranded as New Deli by PlantX. \n\n\u201cIt was always our intent to build New Deli into the ultimate plant-based convenience store brand and ultimately align with a growth partner to expand it through various global markets, rather than grow it on our own,\u201d Kenney told VegNews. \u201cPlantX\u2019s expertise in the e-commerce segment strengthens New Deli beyond a brick-and-mortar concept and into a much more versatile and efficient operating model. We are excited about this new partnership and all the other work we plan to do together to bring more plant-based options to the world.\u201d\n\n\nPlantX\u2019s rapid expansion\nDescribed by some as the \u201cAmazon for vegan food,\u201d the PlantX e-commerce platform was created as a one-stop-shop for everything plant-based, offering consumers across North America more than 10,000 vegan products, including meal and indoor plant deliveries, with plans underway to expand its product lines to include cosmetics, clothing, and its own water brand. Last fall, PlantX launched its website for US consumers and expanded its retail presence with the announcement of a vegan retail and cafe in San Diego.\n\n\n\nEarlier this year, the company applied to list its common shares on the NASDAQ as part of its strategy to expand into the United States and enhance the Canadian company\u2019s investor profile and visibility while accelerating growth. The company is also currently listed on the Canadian Securities Exchange under the symbol \u201cVEGA.\u201d\n\nIn April, professional tennis player and four-time Olympic Gold Medalist Venus Williams invested in PlantX and joined the team as an ambassador to help the company advocate for plant-based living. Williams transitioned to a plant-based diet to alleviate symptoms of an autoimmune disorder. PlantX now carries Williams\u2019 Happy Viking vegan protein brand on its platform and the tennis star curates a \u201cVenus\u2019 Favorites\u201d section of PlantX products on the company\u2019s website.\n\n\nI believe in the potential of this company. I'm pretty new to investing in stocks but wanted to hear what you all have to say about it.",

I used trading 212\u2019s PIE features which allows me to make my own say mini ETF. I made one using space stocks I knew as well as researching online and ARK\u2019s space ETF.\n\nI\u2019ve listed below the stocks I\u2019m in and what % and so far I\u2019ve been given 15% returns on my investment which i can\u2019t complain about. I was wondering if anyone has feedback on Space stocks to add/remove or adjusting my % per stock. I personally really believe this collection will be very valuable in 10+ years \n\nVirgin Galactic - 10%\nLockheed Martin - 10%\nIridium communications - 10%\nTrimble - 10%\nAerojet Rocketdybe 10%\nMaxar Technologies - 9%\nNorthrop Grumman - 9%\nL3 harris - 8%\nThales - 6%\nBoeing - 5%\nAirbus - 4%\nTeradyne - 3.5%\nDassault systems 3.3%\nRaven industries 2.2%",
