        "selftext": "Hey all,\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nStart of the year,  we had a lot of hype around the clean sector. ICLN,TAN were common ETFS that were mentioned alot.\n\nA big portion of my portfolio contains solar companies based on there valuations and upside.\n\nI think $ENPH is the only stock on holdings, that I would consider over valued, but things like $SPWR, $MAXN, $SEDG, $TAN have alot of potential.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm hoping $MAXN/$SPWR get acquired soon- so I can cash up a 3-4x gain.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyways, anyone here bullish? or NOT bullish on these solar stocks?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nthanks,",

        "selftext": "Hello,\n\nBeen on this sub for awhile just soaking in information. I bought some individual stock (AMAT @ $50.85 and ENPH @ 18.35)when I didn't have a lot to play with in the market (just one share of each company). I wish at that time I had more money to actually invest haha. Would it be beneficial to sell those shares and just invest in a similar ETF or mutual fund? Or just buy more? I do own shares of SOXQ which owns shares in AMAT for an example. I could use advice for green energy funds for an alternative to ENPH. Thanks!",

Just following the flow, I think the bill is set to get passed within this year, which could see some several hundy mill pumped into clean solar stocks.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nObviously, that's very high level bull case.
