Presently, they are at $119 and Monday AMC (expected) results, the stock may be volatile.\n\nIf BYND goes above after results, I am fine or even stays between $100 and $119, I am fine to hold.\n\nNow, I see short term put strike $100 expiry Jan 31, 2020 for $0.30. **If I buy 5 puts against the potential drop in value, will be hedge properly?**\n\nWorst case, my loss is limited to $150 (0.30 \\* 100 x 5 )\n\nSince this very critical results to make or break BYND stock, even though I am bullish, market may react any directions, I want to secure my holdings.",

Did all the Brads stop taking all the Beckys to the movies or has NFLX and chill caught on among boomers? Really though, I see there debt and EBITDA are shit, but are they really that bad?",
