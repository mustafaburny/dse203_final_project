        "selftext": "\nThis is a list of the top 20 companies that experienced the largest change in insider shares in the last seven (7) days.\nThe SEC defines an insider as any officer, director or 10% shareholder. It is not illegal for these people to buy or sell their own shares.\nIn fact, since most of them get paid in stock options, it is expected. However, it is illegal for them to trade on inside information\nthat has not been made public. So for example if there are drug trial results that are bad and not public,\ninsiders cannot dump shares. That said, many people have observed that insiders - in general - seem to have a good\ntrack record at timing their purchases.  All trades that are marked as part of a 10b5 plan are excluded from this report.\n\n## Largest Insider Buying (Last 7 Days)\nCompany|Count|Shares Changed|Avg.

        "selftext": "Story time dear readers of r/stocks. I'm 26 and I didn't start investing until the beginning of 2018, my parents are Asian immigrants and have never invested in stocks and think they're akin to gambling especially after the recession. I say this to emphasize how little I knew of stocks and the fact that it was frowned upon. I made IRA contributions in 2016 and 2017 but just let it sit in money markets collecting less than 2% interest, stupid I know. In the beginning of 2018 I decided I wanted give investing a chance with approximately $12k. I read a handful of Warren Buffet quotes and thought I was ready. \n\nFast forward to December 2018 and my portfolio was **down 25%**. My $20k of contributions was only worth $14k, I literally lost an entire year of contributions. I felt like my parents were right and I was an absolute idiot for wasting not only my time but my hard earned money playing with the stock market. On the news and even reddit people were talking about how the market was going into another recession. I was super depressed and just stopped looking at my account all together. I even came here and posted on 12/21/18 how defeated I felt. *Be greedy when others are fearful,* perhaps the Oracle of Omaha's most famous and cliche quote. I couldn't stop hearing it in my head so in January 2019 I decided to double down on my picks and invested my entire $6k contribution. \n\nI'm really happy to say that a year later today my portfolio is **up 41%** and worth $44k on $26k invested. A lot of this is definitely due to luck but if I did not push myself to buy this time last year my portfolio would be barely break-even today. This is my portfolio today: [https://imgur.com/a/Da06frF](https://imgur.com/a/Da06frF)\n\nThis subreddit has been a great community for me, a place for ideas, to vent, and to gauge sentiment. I'm hope to continue reading and contributing and wish you all the best of luck in 2020.",
