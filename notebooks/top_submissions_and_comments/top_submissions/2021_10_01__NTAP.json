        "selftext": "#Good Monday morning traders and investors of the r/wallstreetbets sub! Welcome to the new trading week and a fresh start! Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp; news on this Monday, October 18th, 2021-\n\n*****\n\n# [4 things to know before the stock market opens Monday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/18/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-monday-oct-18.html)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 1. Wall Street set to start the week lower after Friday\u2019s rally\n\n&gt; * Dow futures dropped nearly 150 points Monday ahead of a busy week for corporate earnings against the backdrop of increasing U.S. oil prices and a tick-up in bond yields. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq rallied Friday and for all of last week.\n&gt; * The Dow was less than 1% from its Aug. 16 record close. The S&amp;P 500 was nearly 1.5% away from its Sept. 2 record close. The Nasdaq was 3.1% from its Sept. 7 record close.\n&gt; * The flood of earnings takes a pause Monday but picks back up Tuesday with Netflix, Johnson &amp; Johnson, United Airlines and Procter &amp; Gamble reporting.\n&gt; * So far, 41 S&amp;P 500 companies have delivered third-quarter results, with 80% of them topping EPS expectations, according to data from FactSet.\n&gt; * Taking into account those already out and estimates for the rest, third-quarter profit growth would total 30%, the third-highest quarterly profit growth rate for S&amp;P 500 firms since 2010, according to FactSet.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 2. WTI tops $83 per barrel; bond yields move higher\n\n&gt; * U.S. oil prices, as measured by West Texas Intermediate crude, jumped another 1%, topping $83 per barrel, their highest level since October 2014. Behind the march higher are continued recovering demand as Covid-depressed business activity picks up, and as high natural gas and coal prices encourage a switch to fuel oil and diesel for power generation. WTI was already up three straight sessions and surged 3.7% last week for its eighth positive week in a row, the best weekly winning streak May 2015.\n\n&gt; * The 10-year Treasury yield started the week moving back up toward 1.62%. Before topping those levels earlier this month, the last time it was that high was in June. The 10-year yield, which moves inversely to price, was boosted Friday after data showed that U.S. retail sales rose by 0.7% in September, versus an expected decline of 0.2%. Industrial production figures for September are out at 9:15 a.m. ET, with estimates calling for a 0.2% increase following a 0.4% jump in August.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 3. China GDP disappoints, third-quarter growth slows to 4.9%\n\n&gt; * China\u2019s third-quarter gross domestic product grew a disappointing 4.9% from a year ago as industrial activity in the world\u2019s second-largest economy rose less than expected in September.\n\n&gt; * Many factories had to stop production in late September as a surge in the price of coal and a shortage of electricity prompted local authorities to abruptly cut off power. The struggles of giant developer China Evergrande came to the forefront in August. Real estate and related industries account for about a quarter of China\u2019s GDP, according to Moody\u2019s estimates.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 5. Apple likely to finish transforming its MacBook lineup\n\n&gt; * Apple is holding a launch event Monday to announce new products, likely including a redesigned MacBook Pro. The company has a chance to drive continued momentum to its Macs ahead of the holiday shopping season, especially since it\u2019s expected to announce more computers that run on its own chips instead of Intel\u2019s processors. Last month, Apple announced and subsequently released new iPhones, iPads and Apple Watches, leaving Macs as the remaining major product line that hasn\u2019t been updated this fall. Apple is also likely to provide a release date for macOS Monterey, the latest version of Mac software, which was announced in June but has not yet been officially released.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#LAST WEEK'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR LAST WEEK'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/2NHxxJO.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#LAST WEEK'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR LAST WEEK'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/vz2HTEU.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/ftUCkk2.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/RtabSpV.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/L6FBQkr.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/wuN1x1X.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/u2hqg3v.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/kI0ey7W.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/0Z2SvjX.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#FRIDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/ONkiZ3l.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/EiE3mK7.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/GV1uG7K.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/G54qGje.png)**)\n\n\n*****\n\n#FRIDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/49iSKag.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/GOI4raU.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/18/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-in-the-premarket-zillow-revance-therapeutics-albertsons-and-more.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; **Zillow (Z)** \u2013 Zillow slid 6.4% in premarket trading, following a Bloomberg report that the company has temporarily stopped its home-buying service due to overwhelming demand.\n\n&gt; #**STOCK SYMBOL:** Z\n\n&gt; * [CLICK HERE FOR CHART!](http://charts.finviz.com/chart.ashx?t=Z&amp;ty=c&amp;ta=st_c,sch_200p,sma_50,sma_200,sma_20,sma_100,bb_20_2,rsi_b_14,macd_b_12_26_9,stofu_b_14_3_3&amp;p=d&amp;s=l)\n\n&gt; ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR LIVE STOCK QUOTE!](http://data.cnbc.com/quotes/Z)**)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; **Revance Therapeutics (RVNC)** \u2013 Revance shares plunged 33.2% in the premarket after the Food and Drug Administration declined to approve an injectable treatment for facial lines, noting deficiencies following the FDA\u2019s inspection of manufacturing facilities.

Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp; news on this Monday, October 18th, 2021-\n\n*****\n\n# [5 things to know before the stock market opens Monday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/18/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-monday-oct-18.html)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 1. Wall Street set to start the week lower after Friday\u2019s rally\n\n&gt; * Dow futures dropped nearly 150 points Monday ahead of a busy week for corporate earnings against the backdrop of increasing U.S. oil prices and a tick-up in bond yields. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq rallied Friday and for all of last week.\n&gt; * The Dow was less than 1% from its Aug. 16 record close. The S&amp;P 500 was nearly 1.5% away from its Sept. 2 record close. The Nasdaq was 3.1% from its Sept. 7 record close.\n&gt; * The flood of earnings takes a pause Monday but picks back up Tuesday with Netflix, Johnson &amp; Johnson, United Airlines and Procter &amp; Gamble reporting.\n&gt; * So far, 41 S&amp;P 500 companies have delivered third-quarter results, with 80% of them topping EPS expectations, according to data from FactSet.\n&gt; * Taking into account those already out and estimates for the rest, third-quarter profit growth would total 30%, the third-highest quarterly profit growth rate for S&amp;P 500 firms since 2010, according to FactSet.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 2. WTI tops $83 per barrel; bond yields move higher\n\n&gt; * U.S. oil prices, as measured by West Texas Intermediate crude, jumped another 1%, topping $83 per barrel, their highest level since October 2014. Behind the march higher are continued recovering demand as Covid-depressed business activity picks up, and as high natural gas and coal prices encourage a switch to fuel oil and diesel for power generation. WTI was already up three straight sessions and surged 3.7% last week for its eighth positive week in a row, the best weekly winning streak May 2015.\n\n&gt; * The 10-year Treasury yield started the week moving back up toward 1.62%. Before topping those levels earlier this month, the last time it was that high was in June. The 10-year yield, which moves inversely to price, was boosted Friday after data showed that U.S. retail sales rose by 0.7% in September, versus an expected decline of 0.2%. Industrial production figures for September are out at 9:15 a.m. ET, with estimates calling for a 0.2% increase following a 0.4% jump in August.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 3. China GDP disappoints, third-quarter growth slows to 4.9%\n\n&gt; * China\u2019s third-quarter gross domestic product grew a disappointing 4.9% from a year ago as industrial activity in the world\u2019s second-largest economy rose less than expected in September.\n\n&gt; * Many factories had to stop production in late September as a surge in the price of coal and a shortage of electricity prompted local authorities to abruptly cut off power. The struggles of giant developer China Evergrande came to the forefront in August. Real estate and related industries account for about a quarter of China\u2019s GDP, according to Moody\u2019s estimates.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 5. Apple likely to finish transforming its MacBook lineup\n\n&gt; * Apple is holding a launch event Monday to announce new products, likely including a redesigned MacBook Pro. The company has a chance to drive continued momentum to its Macs ahead of the holiday shopping season, especially since it\u2019s expected to announce more computers that run on its own chips instead of Intel\u2019s processors. Last month, Apple announced and subsequently released new iPhones, iPads and Apple Watches, leaving Macs as the remaining major product line that hasn\u2019t been updated this fall. Apple is also likely to provide a release date for macOS Monterey, the latest version of Mac software, which was announced in June but has not yet been officially released.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#LAST WEEK'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR LAST WEEK'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/2NHxxJO.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#LAST WEEK'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR LAST WEEK'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/vz2HTEU.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/ftUCkk2.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/RtabSpV.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/L6FBQkr.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/wuN1x1X.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/u2hqg3v.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/kI0ey7W.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/0Z2SvjX.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#FRIDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/ONkiZ3l.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/EiE3mK7.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/GV1uG7K.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/G54qGje.png)**)\n\n\n*****\n\n#FRIDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/49iSKag.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/GOI4raU.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/18/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-in-the-premarket-zillow-revance-therapeutics-albertsons-and-more.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; **Zillow (Z)** \u2013 Zillow slid 6.4% in premarket trading, following a Bloomberg report that the company has temporarily stopped its home-buying service due to overwhelming demand.\n\n&gt; #**STOCK SYMBOL:** Z\n\n&gt; * [CLICK HERE FOR CHART!](http://charts.finviz.com/chart.ashx?t=Z&amp;ty=c&amp;ta=st_c,sch_200p,sma_50,sma_200,sma_20,sma_100,bb_20_2,rsi_b_14,macd_b_12_26_9,stofu_b_14_3_3&amp;p=d&amp;s=l)\n\n&gt; ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR LIVE STOCK QUOTE!](http://data.cnbc.com/quotes/Z)**)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; **Revance Therapeutics (RVNC)** \u2013 Revance shares plunged 33.2% in the premarket after the Food and Drug Administration declined to approve an injectable treatment for facial lines, noting deficiencies following the FDA\u2019s inspection of manufacturing facilities.

        "selftext": "#Good Monday morning traders and investors of the r/StockMarket sub! Welcome to the new trading week and a fresh start! Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp; news on this Monday, October 18th, 2021-\n\n*****\n\n# [5 things to know before the stock market opens Monday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/18/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-monday-oct-18.html)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 1. Wall Street set to start the week lower after Friday\u2019s rally\n\n&gt; * Dow futures dropped nearly 150 points Monday ahead of a busy week for corporate earnings against the backdrop of increasing U.S. oil prices and a tick-up in bond yields. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq rallied Friday and for all of last week.\n&gt; * The Dow was less than 1% from its Aug. 16 record close. The S&amp;P 500 was nearly 1.5% away from its Sept. 2 record close. The Nasdaq was 3.1% from its Sept. 7 record close.\n&gt; * The flood of earnings takes a pause Monday but picks back up Tuesday with Netflix, Johnson &amp; Johnson, United Airlines and Procter &amp; Gamble reporting.\n&gt; * So far, 41 S&amp;P 500 companies have delivered third-quarter results, with 80% of them topping EPS expectations, according to data from FactSet.\n&gt; * Taking into account those already out and estimates for the rest, third-quarter profit growth would total 30%, the third-highest quarterly profit growth rate for S&amp;P 500 firms since 2010, according to FactSet.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 2. WTI tops $83 per barrel; bond yields move higher\n\n&gt; * U.S. oil prices, as measured by West Texas Intermediate crude, jumped another 1%, topping $83 per barrel, their highest level since October 2014. Behind the march higher are continued recovering demand as Covid-depressed business activity picks up, and as high natural gas and coal prices encourage a switch to fuel oil and diesel for power generation. WTI was already up three straight sessions and surged 3.7% last week for its eighth positive week in a row, the best weekly winning streak May 2015.\n\n&gt; * The 10-year Treasury yield started the week moving back up toward 1.62%. Before topping those levels earlier this month, the last time it was that high was in June. The 10-year yield, which moves inversely to price, was boosted Friday after data showed that U.S. retail sales rose by 0.7% in September, versus an expected decline of 0.2%. Industrial production figures for September are out at 9:15 a.m. ET, with estimates calling for a 0.2% increase following a 0.4% jump in August.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 3. China GDP disappoints, third-quarter growth slows to 4.9%\n\n&gt; * China\u2019s third-quarter gross domestic product grew a disappointing 4.9% from a year ago as industrial activity in the world\u2019s second-largest economy rose less than expected in September.\n\n&gt; * Many factories had to stop production in late September as a surge in the price of coal and a shortage of electricity prompted local authorities to abruptly cut off power. The struggles of giant developer China Evergrande came to the forefront in August. Real estate and related industries account for about a quarter of China\u2019s GDP, according to Moody\u2019s estimates.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 4. Bitcoin inches toward all-time highs on bitcoin ETF optimism\n\n&gt; * Bitcoin crept close to its April all-time highs near $65,000, rising about 1.5% on Monday to more than $61,000. The world\u2019s biggest digital currency hit a six-month high above $60,000 on Friday. Traders are optimistic the SEC won\u2019t stand in the way of the first bitcoin futures exchange-traded fund, which would begin trading Tuesday unless regulators stepped in. Approval of an ETF that gives mainstream investors exposure to bitcoin would be a landmark for the crypto industry. After April\u2019s record, bitcoin, known for its volatility, slumped and even traded below $29,000 in June before recovering.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 5. Apple likely to finish transforming its MacBook lineup\n\n&gt; * Apple is holding a launch event Monday to announce new products, likely including a redesigned MacBook Pro. The company has a chance to drive continued momentum to its Macs ahead of the holiday shopping season, especially since it\u2019s expected to announce more computers that run on its own chips instead of Intel\u2019s processors. Last month, Apple announced and subsequently released new iPhones, iPads and Apple Watches, leaving Macs as the remaining major product line that hasn\u2019t been updated this fall. Apple is also likely to provide a release date for macOS Monterey, the latest version of Mac software, which was announced in June but has not yet been officially released.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#LAST WEEK'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR LAST WEEK'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/2NHxxJO.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#LAST WEEK'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR LAST WEEK'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/vz2HTEU.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/ftUCkk2.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/RtabSpV.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/L6FBQkr.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/wuN1x1X.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/u2hqg3v.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/kI0ey7W.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/0Z2SvjX.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#FRIDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/ONkiZ3l.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/EiE3mK7.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/GV1uG7K.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/G54qGje.png)**)\n\n\n*****\n\n#FRIDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/49iSKag.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/GOI4raU.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S MOST ACTIVE TRENDING TICKERS ON STOCKTWITS:\n\n* MNKD\n* FCEL\n* OCGN\n* DOGE.X\n* HITI\n* OYST\n* UPST\n* Z\n* CKB.X\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/18/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-in-the-premarket-zillow-revance-therapeutics-albertsons-and-more.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; **Zillow (Z)** \u2013 Zillow slid 6.4% in premarket trading, following a Bloomberg report that the company has temporarily stopped its home-buying service due to overwhelming demand.\n\n&gt; #**STOCK SYMBOL:** Z\n\n&gt; * [CLICK HERE FOR CHART!](http://charts.finviz.com/chart.ashx?t=Z&amp;ty=c&amp;ta=st_c,sch_200p,sma_50,sma_200,sma_20,sma_100,bb_20_2,rsi_b_14,macd_b_12_26_9,stofu_b_14_3_3&amp;p=d&amp;s=l)\n\n&gt; ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR LIVE STOCK QUOTE!](http://data.cnbc.com/quotes/Z)**)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; **Revance Therapeutics (RVNC)** \u2013 Revance shares plunged 33.2% in the premarket after the Food and Drug Administration declined to approve an injectable treatment for facial lines, noting deficiencies following the FDA\u2019s inspection of manufacturing facilities.
