        "selftext": "Think this one has been flying under the radar.  If you look at the 1 year chart it is an absolute disaster, CEO was fired in Nov '19, they projected soft growth in Q1 and withdrew guidance completely in Q2.

Instead, she planned to pay for \u201cMedicare For All\u201d by taxing Wall Street.\n\n&gt; Her plan called for a 0.2% tax on stock trades, a 0.1% tax on bond trades and a 0.002% tax on derivative transactions. She claimed these taxes would raise more than $2 trillion over the course of a decade. Critics of the plan argued that taxing financial transactions in this way could make it harder for Americans to build retirement savings.\n\n- https://www.marketwatch.com/story/kamala-harris-on-student-loan-forgiveness-medicare-universal-basic-income-credit-scores-and-a-tax-on-trading-stocks-2020-08-12",

        "selftext": "Well, I've officially made my first, second, and third million from PRPL (I called it [right here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gs7mjl/prpl_more_dd_for_you_autists/) two months ago).   My net liquidity in PRPL as of Friday close is $2,622,131,72.   That, along with the $380k I've taken out, I'm at just over $3M.   At this point, when you take into account all the stupid moves I made when I first found this sub, I'm now playing with house money.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Has PRPL Memed Yet?\n\nNo.   It hasn't.   Not yet.   \n\nI'm kind of getting tired of answering this in PMs, so please don't ask me if it is too late to invest.   This hasn't memed and I believe we will be in the $25-27 range easily after earnings just by fundamentals alone (assuming the previous low visibility on the stock).   As visibility increases, I think the valuation multiple increases, and not past fundamentals.   We will see higher if this becomes a no longer under-the-radar stock.\n\nThis isn't a meme yet, and it is no where close.\n\nHow do we know?   Let's look at the ultimate source of truth on the subject:  [Robintrack](https://robintrack.net/symbol/PRPL).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lzr2qdg4kne51.png?width=1889&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=46997d3050986a77c318c7c9e17ceb39cf8b7f91\n\nAs you can see, we've seen a significant influx of Robinhood tards in the last few days, but this isn't memeing, yet.\n\nIf you check the [Robintrack popularity changes](https://robintrack.net/popularity_changes?hoursAgo=168) over the last week, PRPL comes in at #113 most popular in terms of user growth.    That isn't very high at all.   It's surrounded by other stocks you've never heard of.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j2376iielne51.png?width=576&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1ea7b7afb1b7de17dd2f36d4bde3f5f17c0ebf5d\n\nThis is hardly meme worthy yet.   Compare this to KODK:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u62x1fgdmne51.png?width=585&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=83b16c21e2b56c23818b6a48c97ee0410c12047a\n\nWe should also compare PRPL to two recents meme stocks:  SPCE and DKNG.   As a side note, all three of these stocks came from SPACs BTW, hence the warrants.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ne6lwwnvpne51.png?width=1892&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e97dba747dc51ec779ef8a8a5640f72257313798\n\nSPCE shot up to about 92,000 Robintards very quickly, which drove the price up.   When the rate of Robintard increases declined and flattened out, the stock dropped.   There are now 150k Robintards holding.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0xndxysxpne51.png?width=1890&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c4db5e52718775e5b30ffe74d59784f34395600c\n\nDKNG shot up to about 100,000 Robintards investing on the meme run up, and still has about 120k still in.  The meme drop off is less pronounced on DKNG because, unlike SPCE, they have this thing called \"Revenue\".\n\nKODK, SPCE, and DKNG all had run ups to about 100k Robintards driving the meme up in price way over fundamentals.   PRPL only has 6,600 Robintards, and the current price is fully supported by fundamentals (see some of my previous posts and u/dhsmatt2's previous posts if you want support on that statement).\n\nSo, no, it isn't a meme.   Keep tabs on this though as Robintard entry could definitely cause this to meme up (and we may very well be in the early stages of this right now).   Buy calls now and sell when we start getting close to 100k Robintards.\n\n# Financial Analysis\n\nI think u/dhsmatt2 did a pretty good job [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/i0zaqh/prpl_nurples_why_purple_valuation_just_might_make/?sort=new).   My only two comments are:  1)  I think his revenue estimate is low (mine:  $244m, his $225M), and 2)  the warrant liability accrual won't be recurring at the same level (we will see one big bang this quarter and then a wimper going forward until the warrants are gone--so his forward EPS estimate should be higher on his math).\n\nMy revenue estimates:\n\n||Q2 Total|June|May|April|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Direct-to-Consumer (DTC)|*205.0*|*80.0*|**71.0**|**54.0**|\n|Wholesale Partner|*39.0*|*19.0*|**17.3**|*2.7*|\n||||||\n|Total|*244.0 M*|*99.0*|**88.3**|*56.7*|\n\nThe bold numbers are known for sure as they were disclosed.   The italicized are my estimates.\n\nI'm putting June DTC as an acceleration over May because of the following:\n\n1. The website still showed significant delays in delivery, which means they were still selling every mattress they make.\n2. Extra manufacturing capacity came online at the beginning of June.\n3. Purple discontinued its lower end models, which would cause a mix shift up in revenue per unit when selling at capacity.\n\nI may be underestimating this as well.\n\nI placed wholesale where it was at because it is still recovering and Joe Megibow [said in this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uP8ggnn9nK8&amp;feature=youtu.be) that they were almost flat of wholesale year over year at this point.\n\n# Valuations\n\nI'm copying this [from a previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hig038/i_bought_six_prpl_mattresses_today_you_should_buy/), even though the data is slightly dated now after TPX and SNBR had their releases.\n\n**Enterprice Value / Revenue**\n\n|Ticker|As of 6/28/20|2020 Q1|2019 Q4|2019 Q3|2019 Q2|2019 Q1|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|PRPL|2.01|2.52|3.94|3.61|3.73|3.09|\n|TPX|1.71|4.84|7.39|7.34|8.07|6.88|\n|SNBR|0.98|2.36|4.40|3.79|4.97|3.78|\n|CSPR|0.53|0.91|||||\n\nBased upon the chart, I don't see a 2x multiple on revenue as unreasonable at all for PRPL, and arguably, it should be higher due to the acceleration in growth rate.\n\nThe Q2 revenue pattern will continue into Q3 and beyond (they are still backed up on delivery on several products).   Additionally, they will be bringing substantial capacity online in the next year to support sales.   I see PRPL producing $800M-$1,200M in revenue over the next year as we see continued capacity growth, shift into higher end mattresses, and continued expansion on both DTC and wholesale doors.\n\nClearly, it is easy to justify the $1.32B valuation as of close Friday, and arguably, much higher.\n\n# Positions\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kza0j31utne51.png?width=1242&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dcb053f5300205be309cdf19b4fbc23a7a6df276\n\nA bunch of warrants and call debit spreads.  \n\n# Recommendations\n\nI don't have any recommendations.   Go talk to your investment advisor as this isn't investment advice.   What am I looking at right now?   Debit spreads.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6hv4gez1une51.png?width=1242&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b8bdb7c9ecd0ae6730e95732434687b2ecc56a11\n\nIf you took the ask, you can pick up a 20/22.5c debit spread for only $1.70.   It pays out $2.50 as long as the stock stays above $22.50 after earnings (likelihood is extremely high as the stock is currently at $24.37).\n\nFor those of you who are asking what to do or wondering if it is too late to make money:   that is an example conservative position to take even if you think the stock will be flat from here on out till earnings (it won't be).\n\nMy bet is that it continues to grow each day on a run up.   I'll be watching Robintrack very closely on the run up.    My plan is to hold through earnings, unless we meme up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# PRPL GANG FTW!!!",

The loan news caused Kodak's shares to climb to as high as $60, before falling back to $15 on Monday, in massive trading volume. The stock had already moved 25% the day before the news was officially disclosed. Executives with stock options, including some awarded the day before the loan became public, were sitting on big paper gains. Kodak shares were down 1.3% Tuesday, but are up 215% in the year to date, while the S&amp;P 500 has gained 2%.\n\n\nhttps://research.tdameritrade.com/grid/public/markets/news/story.asp?docKey=1-DN20200804010106&amp;cid=1-DN20200804010106-MIP",

        "selftext": "That's right, your monthly update on the sector that the majority of people seem to hate and has a total market cap almost equal to that of Pinterest. Yes, even I was suprised about this. A sector that provides fuel for powering 20% of the entire US and around 10% of all power generation globally has a combined market cap equivalent to a website where you can look for pictures of furniture (extremely simplified but you get the point).\n\nBut I digress, for those of you who have not read my previous updates and DD, [here](https://amp.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/hp9966/the_case_for_a_big_uranium_bull_market_and_what/) is a general market analysis and five stock suggestions, [here](https://amp.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/huo47l/uranium_miners_are_showing_big_growth_with_many/) is a market update and lastly [here](https://amp.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/i2bf4d/the_sector_that_returned_20x_50x_100x_and_even/) another update explaining the bullish views and recent drop. I would highly suggest you read these first before asking questions, since they will probably answer most questions you may have in the post itself or between the hundreds of comments. If you do have more questions, I will be more than happy to answer them for you.\n\nNow, let's move on to the big one, what is happening in the sector? Well it looks like 2021 is going to be the year all catalysts come together to form one incredible bull market for uranium. \n\nKazatomprom has publicly announced that their supply in 2021 will be severely impacted. Why is that? Because ISR mining in Kazakhstan is a lot like planting crops. A mining solution has to be put into the ground, which will go into the ore bodies and after between 4 and 7 months the solution can be pumped back out together with the uranium ore. The only problem is that the main 'seeding' months where between April and September, right before Kazakhstan winter. They have now missed their main mining time of the year, which means little to no new uranium will be pulled out of the ground next year for the first time in a long long time. With Kazakhstan responsible for just around 40% of the entire global supply of uranium, this impact will translate into a major supply deficit on top of the already existing supply deficit. This year it is estimated that there will be around 120 million pounds of uranium produced, where 180 million pounds was demanded. This means that inventory and mobile supply had to be used to fill this gap, further tightening the global supply of uranium. Let's talk about the wildest situation, which would be every single uranium producer, including at Olympic Dam, just ramps up to full capacity and sell everything into the market at whatever the current price is. Will that drop the price a bit? Sure it will. Will it take care of the deficit and prevent this bull market from happening? Absolutely not.\n\nIf this structural deficit happened to any other commodity, the price would absolutely skyrocket. So why hasn't uranium? Because there has been almost no talk of nuclear utilities, the main consumer of uranium, coming into the market to buy new fuel. This will change in 2021 and especially 2022 when 40% and 80% of all utilities in the US respectively will be out of contract and thus not getting their all important fuel for the nuclear power plants.\n\nThis contracting cycle comes at the same time as the biggest supply deficit we have yet seen, the closing of several high profile uranium mines, like Orano's Cominak mine, the lack of new uranium mines for at least the next 2/3 years and above all the increasing demand for uranium all across the globe make this entire sector a coiled spring. We do not know when it will go off, but the longer it stays this way the higher the jump and this jump will come. My guess is that there are several small bumps this year and that there will be a huge jump next year which will trigger a bull market that may even eclipse the likes of 2002-2007 and will last between 2-4 years depending on how long it takes for all utilities to sign new contracts and the market to be supplied well again, after which the market will come back down to 'normal levels'.\n\nLastly, there have been index funds who are restructuring their holdings to have more pure play exposure to uranium. $URA will move from 50% to 70%, adding 32 million dollars to the sector. With a sector that had such a small market cap, inflow of capital like this can move the needle substantially. Just imagine what will happen when the general investment community and all those people who made millions in the previous bull market decide to invest into the sector. That will do more than just moving the needle or spring the coil, that would put the needle and the coil into a cannon.\n\nAll signs point to this being the most asymmetrical risk/reward investment you can find in the market. I will not deny the risk it brings, but the potential rewards are so large that they easily write off any risk that might be involved investing in this sector. When all is set and done, those that invested early and held on through all the volatility will be greatly rewarded for their troubles.\n\nExtras:\nI highly suggest checking out people like Brandon Munro, the uranium insider, John Quackes, Crux Investor, Rob Chang and especially Mike Alkin who all have extensive information on the sector and the investment thesis.\n\nDisclaimer:\nUranium holds a 25% spot in my total portfolio, with significant positions in Cameco (CCO), Denison Mines (DNN) and Energy Fuels (UUUU).",

        "selftext": "# tl;dr - Earnings is gonna be lit!\n\n[PRPL earnings is tomorrow, 8/13, after hours](https://investors.purple.com/press-releases/news-details/2020/Purple-to-Report-Second-Quarter-2020-Results-on-August-13-2020/default.aspx).   Any other date is wrong.  Robinhood is wrong (why are you using Robinhood still!?!).\n\nI'm going to take you through my earnings projections and reasoning as well the things to look for in the earnings release and the call that could make this moon even further.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Earnings Estimates\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/w3qad4gb9ng51.png?width=854&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7a88656a9867d0e40710736f61974a22b5f4a631\n\nI'm calling $244M Net Revenue with $39.75M in Net Income, which would be $0.75 Diluted EPS.  I'll walk you through how I got here\n\n# Total Net Revenue\n\nI make the assumption that Purple is still selling every mattress it can make (since that is what they said for April and May) and that this continued into June because the website was still delayed 7-14 days across all mattresses at the end of June.\n\n**May Revenue and April DTC:**  The numbers in purple were provided by Purple [here](https://investors.purple.com/press-releases/news-details/2020/Purple-Innovation-Reports-Record-First-Quarter-2020-Results/default.aspx) and [here](https://investors.purple.com/press-releases/news-details/2020/Purple-Innovation-Provides-Business-Update-Ahead-of-Participation-in-Oppenheimer-20th-Annual-Consumer-Growth-Conference/default.aspx).  \n\n**April Wholesale:**  My estimate of $2.7M for Wholesale sales in April comes from this statement from the Q1 earnings release:  \" *While wholesale sales were down 42.7% in April year-over-year, weekly wholesale orders have started to increase on a sequential basis.* \"  I divided Q2 2019's wholesale sales evenly between months and then went down 42.7%.\n\n**June DTC:**  This is my estimate based upon the fact that another Mattress Max machine went online June 1, thus increasing capacity, and the low end model was discontinued (raising revenue per unit).\n\n**June Wholesale:**  [Joe Megibow stated at Commerce Next](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uP8ggnn9nK8&amp;feature=emb_logo) on 7/30 that wholesale had returned to almost flat growth.  I'm going to assume he meant for the quarter, so I plugged the number here to finish out the quarter at $39.0M, just under $39.3M from a year ago.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Revenue Expectations from Analysts** ([via Yahoo](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/PRPL/analysis?p=PRPL))\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/notxd6hhbng51.png?width=384&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aa0453414f467aa6c5bf72ce8a8046c0ae6e62a5\n\nMy estimate of $244M comes in way over the high, let alone the consensus.   PRPL has effectively already disclosed \\~$145M for April/May, so these expectations are way off.  I'm more right than they are.\n\n# Gross Margins\n\nI used my estimates for Q3/Q4 2019 to guide margins in April/May as there were some one time events that occurred in Q1 depressing margins.   June has higher margin because of the shift away from the low end model (which is priced substantially lower than the high end model).   Higher priced models were given manufacturing priority.\n\n# Operating Expenses\n\n**Marketing and Sales**\n\nJoe mentioned in the [Commerce Next](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uP8ggnn9nK8&amp;feature=emb_logo) video that they were able to scale sales at a constant CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost).   There's three ways of interpreting this:\n\n1. Overall customer acquisition cost was constant with previous quarters (assume $36M total, not $93.2M), which means you need to add another $57M to bottom line profit and $1.08 to EPS, or\n2. Customer Acquisition Costs on a unit basis were constant, which means I'm still overstating total marketing expense and understating EPS massively, or\n3. Customer Acquisition Costs on a revenue basis were constant, which is the most conservative approach and the one I took for my estimate.\n\nI straightlined the 2.2 ratio of DTC sales to Marketing costs from Q1.   I am undoubtably too high in my expense estimate here as PRPL saw marketing efficiencies and favorable revenue shifts during the quarter.  So, $93.2M\n\n**General and Administrative**\n\nA Purple HR rep [posted on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6691037138018017280/) about hiring 330 people in the quarter.   I'm going to assume that was relative to the pre-COVID furloughs, so I had June at that proportional amount to previous employees and adjusted April and May for furloughs and returns from furlough.\n\n**Research and Development**\n\nI added just a little here and straight lined it.\n\n# Other Expenses\n\n**Interest Expense**\n\nStraightlined from previous quarters, although they may have tapped ABL lines and so forth, so this could be under.\n\n**One Time and Other**\n\nUnpredictable by nature.\n\n**Warrant Liability Accrual**\n\nI'm making some assumptions here.   \n\n1. We know that the secondary offering event during Q2 from the Pearce brothers triggered the clause for the loan warrants (NOT the PRPLW warrants) to lower the strike price to $0.\n2. I can't think of a logical reason why the warrant holders wouldn't exercise at this point.\n3. Therefore there is no longer a warrant liability where the company may need to repurchase warrants back.\n4. The liability accrual of $7.989M needs to be reversed out for a gain.\n\nThis sucker is worth about $0.15 EPS on its own.\n\n# Earnings (EPS)\n\nI project $39.75M or $0.75 Diluted EPS (53M shares).  How does this hold up to the analysts?\n\n**EPS Expectations from Analysts** ([via Yahoo](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/PRPL/analysis?p=PRPL))\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/o2i1dvk6hng51.png?width=373&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=27e63f7934d85393e1f7b87bf2e2066c28047202\n\n**EPS Expectations from Analysts** ([via MarketBeat](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/PRPL/earnings/))\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/psu5rajfhng51.png?width=1359&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0612d43777c644789b14f8c5decbe36f41925f5e\n\nThese losers are way under.   Now you know why I am so optimistic about earnings.\n\nKeep in mind, these analysts are still giving $28-$30 price targets.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# What to Watch For During Earnings (aka Reasons Why This Moons More)\n\nAnalysts, Institutionals, and everyone else who uses math for investing is going to be listening for the following:\n\n* Margin Growth\n* Warrant Liability Accrual\n* Capacity Expansion Rate\n* CACs (Customer Acquisition Costs)\n* New Product Categories\n* Cashless Exercise of PRPLW warrants\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Margin Growth**\n\nThis factor is HUGE.  If PRPL guides to higher margins due to better sales mix and continued DTC shift, then every analyst and investor is going to tweak their models up in a big way.   Thus far, management has been relatively cautious about this fortuitous shift to DTC continuing.   [If web traffic is any indicator](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/i7gjsn/prpl_q2_revenue_forecast_using_web_traffic/), it will, but we need management to tell us that.\n\n**Warrant Liability Accrual**\n\nI could be dead wrong on my assumptions above on this one.   If it stays, there will be questions about it due to the drop in exercise price.   It does impact GAAP earnings (although it shouldn't--stupid accountants).\n\n**Capacity Expansion Rate**\n\nThis is a BIG one as well.   As PRPL has been famously capacity constrained: their rate of manufacturing capacity expansion is their growth rate over the next year.  PRPL discontinued expansion at the beginning of COVID and then re-accelerated it to a faster pace than pre-COVID by hurrying the machines in-process out to the floor.   They also signed their [manufacturing space deal](https://investors.purple.com/press-releases/news-details/2020/Purple-Expands-U.S.-Manufacturing-with-a-New-Facility-in-Georgia/default.aspx) which has nearly doubled manufacturing space a quarter early.   The REAL question is when the machines will start rolling out.   Previous guidance was end of the year at best.   If we get anything sooner than that, we are going to ratchet up.\n\n**CACs (Customer Acquisition Costs)**\n\nSince DTC is the new game in town, we are all going to want to understand exactly where marketing expenses were this quarter and, more importantly, where management thinks they are going.   The magic words to listen for are \"marketing efficiencies\".   Those words means the stock goes up.  This is the next biggest line item on the P&amp;L besides revenue and cost of goods sold.\n\n**New Product Categories**\n\nWe [heard the VP of Brand](https://www.iheart.com/podcast/256-authentic-influence-31157510/episode/purple-vp-of-brand-burke-morley-67762598/) from Purple give us some touchy-feely vision of where the company is headed and that mattresses was just the revenue generating base to empower this.   I'm hoping we hear more about this.    This is what differentiated Amazon from Barnes and Noble:  Amazon's vision was more than just books.   Purple sees itself as more than just mattresses.   Hopefully we get some announced action behind that vision.   This multiplies the stock.\n\n**Cashless Exercise of PRPLW Warrants**\n\nI doubt this will be answered, even if the question is asked.   I bet they wait until the 20 out of 30 days is up and they deliver notice.   We could be pleasantly surprised.   If management informs us that they will opt for cashless exercise of the warrants, this is anti-dilutive to EPS.   It will reduce the number of outstanding shares and automatically cause an adjustment up in the stock price (remember kids, some people use math when investing).   I'm hopeful, but not expecting it.   The amount of the adjustment depends on the current price of the stock.    Also, I fully expect PRPL management to use their cashless exercise option at the end of the 20 out of 30 days as they are already spitting cash.\n\n# Positions\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tho65crvkng51.png?width=1242&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6241ff5e8b26744f9d7119ddef7da86f163c741d\n\nI'm not just holding, I added.\n\nPRPLW Warrants:  391,280\n\nPRPL Call Debit Spreads:   17.5c/25c 8/21 x90, 20c/25c 8/21 x247\n\nAlso, I bought some CSPR 7.5p 8/21 x200 for fun because I think that sucker is going to get shamed back down to $6 after a real mattress company shows what it can do.",

Also, he enacted a payroll tax cut that will be come a grant IF he becomes re-elected. So inflation will continue to rise, oh and the Fed is capping interest rates on bonds. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2) Metals compete DIRECTLY with REAL (inflation adjusted) interest rates. As a foundational bedrock investment of  Pensions, Mutual Funds, and general portfolios - people have traditionally held long term bonds.  Metals are a 0% thing, you can't eat them and they are basically a pet rock - but they are stable at 0% forever, as metals were the ORIGINAL money.  If you take the current bond rate, and subtract the inflation rate, you get -1.1%.  This is causing MASSIVE moves in the market as people leave bonds and crowd into metals, as 0% beats the hell out of negative REAL rates.  Currently Gold is at 2100, if we go to -2% REAL rates, Gold will be 2500. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n3) Learn about Rehypothecation here ([https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rehypothecation.asp#:\\~:text=Rehypothecation%20is%20a%20practice%20whereby,or%20a%20rebate%20on%20fees.](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rehypothecation.asp#:~:text=Rehypothecation%20is%20a%20practice%20whereby,or%20a%20rebate%20on%20fees.)).  For obvious reasons, this is why housing blew up in 2008.  The exact same thing is happening in Silver, but inversely.  Silver has been abused for so long, but it REALLY started in 2011. The \"classic\" (meaning the mined ratio, or the ratio at which they pull this shit out of the ground) is around 16:1.  In 2005, the ratio was 60:1.  On Friday's close, the Silver/Gold ratio was 79:1.  Silver has a LONG way to catch-up.  At CURRENT levels, Silver SHOULD be (assuming a 60:1 ratio) \\~ 35ish.  So when you look at the fact that Silver has been abused for so long that its undervalued, coupled with the Massive run on metals due to negative REAL rates, Silver has massive upside. The amount of fund inflows into Silver ETF's is another leg up on silver as well - they eventually are going to have to officially re-value silver to reflect fund inflows and sentiment.  Who knows what the new Silver/Gold ratio could end up as...but I'm betting its a LOT lower than 60:1. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n4a) Banks will continue to fight us on silver, but they are losing as they were massively short, and the world blew up in their face.  HSBC lost $200M in a single day, and closed their industrial metals business around 6 weeks ago ( [https://www.kitco.com/news/2020-07-03/HSBC-closes-its-industrial-metals-business.html](https://www.kitco.com/news/2020-07-03/HSBC-closes-its-industrial-metals-business.html) ).  Soctiabank also closed down its metals trading desk around 4 months ago ( [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-metals-bank-of-nova-scotia-exclusive/exclusive-scotiabank-to-close-its-metals-business-sources-idUSKCN22A2ZC#:\\~:text=%E2%80%9CScotia%20had%20a%20global%20call,said%20one%20of%20the%20sources.&amp;text=A%20spokeswoman%20for%20Scotiabank%20declined,around%20the%20beginning%20of%202021.](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-metals-bank-of-nova-scotia-exclusive/exclusive-scotiabank-to-close-its-metals-business-sources-idUSKCN22A2ZC#:~:text=%E2%80%9CScotia%20had%20a%20global%20call,said%20one%20of%20the%20sources.&amp;text=A%20spokeswoman%20for%20Scotiabank%20declined,around%20the%20beginning%20of%202021.) )  This means the ONLY one left is JPM, and they are still trying to fight us, but are losing and continuing to wind down shorts. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n4b) The $1.5 drop we saw Thursday night was exactly this - banks reloading shorts to try and fight us, but there is a big difference. An ALL TIME RECORD amount of shorts were opened on the Comex on Thursday, around 350k contracts....a RECORD amount...and all it did was $1.50 in damage....so that should tell you where sentiment and price action is.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLHLEAbZUA8&amp;t=1s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLHLEAbZUA8&amp;t=1s) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n5) Silver is about to go hyperbolic and nothing is in it's way.  The fed is printing money (driving inflation), people are already crowding metals, banks are unwinding their short positions (or closing their metals trading desk all together), and there are HISTORIC inflows into Silver - which will eventually cause a revaluation to the upside.  I'm an EE and I love Technical Analysis, but this is 100% fundamental driven. \n\nA retired energy trader once told me \"Fundamentals will tell you why something is happening, TA will tell you when\".  TA is broken on metals right now and all its doing is making algos and morons try to load shorts.  Multinational global banks are literally leaving the idea of shorting metals, so maybe follow suit?  These are some of the smartest people on earth and I hate bankers, but they aren't dumb.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHave a great week.",

        "selftext": "**Disclaimer:** I did not invent this indicator or find this correlation. All credit goes to a very intelligent trader on Twitter named Kerberos007 who might be borderline obsessed with finding data-based crash indicators.\n\n**The Indicator:** Let me be clear. I am by no means a great trader. But I found this guy\u2019s crash thesis and checked it against every SPY crash in recent history that I could. It's deadly accurate. I feel like a chimpanzee trying to explain the concept of why fire burns but if it saves some of you guys from not being able to afford the bubble wrap and capri-suns you love, maybe it\u2019s worth it. If you graph the correlation between the daily value of the SPX and GLD, you will see an interesting pattern emerge. In the period before a market crash, they will begin to have a higher correlation. At some point that correlation will become so positive that it crosses the threshold of 0.6. From what I can see, how long it stays above 0.6 doesn\u2019t really matter. The most important part is that when the correlation starts to break down and returns to 0.6 on the way down, all hell breaks loose within 1-3 days. When it triggers, it doesn\u2019t always mean Armageddon type SPY damage but it will be a significant pullback. For example, you can see that it was triggered on 6/5 which was just a couple days before our last significant pullback.\n\n**Where is it Now:** As of today 8/11/20 the correlation is at .64 and dropping like a rock. I\u2019m not telling you guys to go all in on puts because putting all your faith in one indicator doesn\u2019t make sense. I\u2019m just saying that when that .60 threshold is crossed just make sure you are hedged effectively for at least the next 3 trading days. Maybe just a little more bearish than usual just in case things get froggy.\n\n**TLDR:** Be prepared for a big red day once the correlation between GLD and SPX decreases to 0.60. Good luck my brothers. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/icji9e4gkeg51.png?width=854&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b07cca589a5dd117dbd15a3f8b99c3b4ca286866\n\nP.S.

The order will take effect after 10 days, as the companies requested a brief stay during the appeals process.\n&gt; \n&gt; If upheld, the ruling could have serious implications for Uber and Lyft, both of which are not yet profitable and have seen their ride-hailing businesses suffer during the pandemic. By classifying their drivers as independent workers, rather than employees, the companies have not had to pay for costly benefits that come with a full-time staff. \n&gt; \n&gt; California Attorney General Xavier Becerra requested the injunction as part of a lawsuit he brought in May along with city attorneys from San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego. The suit, filed in San Francisco Superior Court, alleged Uber and Lyft violated the state\u2019s new law known as Assembly Bill 5 (AB5), which was created as a way to classify gig workers as full employees and ensure benefits from their employers. Uber and Lyft were among a group of tech companies that have previously opposed the bill, arguing their workers enjoy the flexibility of creating their own schedules as contractors. \n&gt; \n&gt; California officials sought an injunction on the alleged misclassification and restitution for workers and civil penalties worth up to hundreds of millions of dollars.\n&gt; \n&gt; Shares of Uber were down 0.8% during extended trading Monday and Lyft shares were down 1.7%.\n&gt; \n&gt; Both companies said they would appeal the ruling immediately.\n&gt; \n&gt; \u201cThe vast majority of drivers want to work independently, and we\u2019ve already made significant changes to our app to ensure that remains the case under California law,\u201d an Uber spokesperson said. \u201cWhen over 3 million Californians are without a job, our elected leaders should be focused on creating work, not trying to shut down an entire industry during an economic depression.\u201d\n&gt; \n&gt; \u201cDrivers do not want to be employees, full stop,\u201d Lyft said in a statement. \u201cWe\u2019ll immediately appeal this ruling and continue to fight for their independence. Ultimately, we believe this issue will be decided by California voters and that they will side with drivers.\u201d \n&gt; \n&gt; \u201cThe court has weighed in and agreed: Uber and Lyft need to put a stop to unlawful misclassification of their drivers while our litigation continues,\u201d Becerra said in a statement. \u201cWhile this fight still has a long way to go, we\u2019re pushing ahead to make sure the people of California get the workplace protections they deserve. Our state and workers shouldn\u2019t have to foot the bill when big businesses try to skip out on their responsibilities. We\u2019re going to keep working to make sure Uber and Lyft play by the rules.\u201d\n&gt; \n&gt; Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi advocated for a \u201cthird way\u201d to classify workers in a letter to President Donald Trump in March as the first round of coronavirus relief measures were being negotiated. He argued there should be a way for workers to gain protections without sacrificing the flexibility of contract work.\n&gt; \n&gt; In the ruling, Judge Ethan Schulman recognized the value of flexibility offered by Uber and Lyft, writing, \u201cThe Court does not take lightly Defendants\u2019 showing that a preliminary injunction may also have an adverse effect on some of their drivers, many of whom desire the flexibility to continue working as they have in the past, and may have commitments that make it difficult if not impossible for them to become full-time employees.\u201d\n&gt; \n&gt; But Schulman wrote that Uber and Lyft\u2019s concerns that the injunction would have \u201cfar-reaching effects\u201d had \u201conly been exacerbated by Defendants\u2019 prolonged and brazen refusal to comply with California law. Defendants may not evade legislative mandates merely because their businesses are so large that they affect the lives of many thousands of people.\u201d\n&gt; \n&gt; Schulman wrote that any impact of the injunction on Uber and Lyft\u2019s businesses would likely be mitigated by the fact that both have said the \u201cvast majority of their drivers work on a casual or sporadic basis\u201d and the reality that the coronavirus pandemic has \u201cdrastically reduced the demand for Defendants\u2019 services.\u201d\n&gt; \n&gt; \u201cNow, when Defendants\u2019 ridership is at an all-time low, may be the best time (or the least worst time) for Defendants to change their business practices to conform to California law without causing widespread adverse effects on their drivers,\u201d Schulman wrote.\n&gt; \n&gt; Uber and Lyft sought to delay the ruling until there was a ruling on Uber\u2019s constitutional challenge of AB5 or until voters weighed in on a ballot measure they sponsored to exempt them from the law. The Court dismissed those requests.\n&gt; \n&gt; Schulman said Uber\u2019s arguments that drivers\u2019 work was outside the ordinary course of its business, as the standard requires, was \u201ca classic example of circular reasoning.\u201d He summarized the argument as saying that since Uber views itself as a tech company, only its tech workers are its employees.\n&gt; \n&gt; \u201cWere this reasoning to be accepted, the rapidly expanding majority of industries that rely heavily on technology could with impunity deprive legions of workers of the basic protections afforded to employees by state labor and employment laws,\u201d the judge wrote.\n&gt; \n&gt; The ruling does not end the legal battles for Uber and Lyft, however. Last week, California\u2019s Labor Commissioner announced lawsuits against the companies alleging wage theft due to misclassification. The commission seeks to recover wages it believes were owed to drivers currently classified as contractors. The suits were filed in Alameda County Superior Court.",

Let's take a look:\n\n* RKT's Q1 2020 EBITDA Margin was a **blistering 44%!** Compare that other FinTechs latest EBITDA margins \n   * SHOP at negative 1.9%\n   * GWRE at 6%\n   * LMND at negative 73%!\n   * PYPL at 19%\n* RKT has an **Revenue per Employee (as of 3/31/20) figure of $300k**! Again, compare to other Fintechs, RKT is nearly the exact Median\n   * SHOP at $416k / employee\n   * GWRE at $276k / employee\n   * LMND at $251k / employee\n   * PYPL at $828k / employee\n* Now, let's look at the valuation for the other Fintechs. **RKT is very obviously undervalued compared to the segment**\n   * Enterprise Value / Revenue\n      * SHOP - 54.3x LTM Revenue\n      * GWRE - 11.7x LTM Revenue\n      * LMND - 44.3x LTM Revenue\n      * PYPL - 11.4x LTM Revenue\n      * **RKT - 2.2x LTM Revenue**\n   * P/E\n      * SHOP - N/A, negative EPS\n      * GWRE - 333x P/E\n      * LMND - N/A,negative EPS\n      * PYPL - 87x P/E\n      * **RKT - 7.7x P/E**\n\n**But, but, what about the mortgage volume? Isn't RKT exposed to interest rates and mortgage volume?**\n\nPlain and simple, there is no force that is going to stop volume right now. We can all say that fundamentals don't matter and for stock market pricing they may not. But in terms of interest rate action by the Fed, they very much do matter, and it is clear the Fed does not intend to raise rate until fundamentals truly stabilize. And if rates do come up, it will mean even J.Pow &amp; Co think inflation is getting too hot. Fuck SLV gang, **Real Estate is the ultimate anti-inflation safe-haven.** So volume should remain largely unaffected as investors seek inflation protection.\n\n**RKT continues to gain market share in an expanding market**\n\nLet's face it, eventually boomers will not be applying for new mortgages and millennials are not going to walk into Chase with a $100 fountain pen to apply for a mortgage. One of the biggest themes of the housing market today is increasing rate of home ownership among millenials. RKT's completely digitized offering positions them to capitalize on market trends. The numbers prove this as RKT's share of the total mortgage market has increased from 1.3% in 2009 to &gt;9% in the first quarter of 2020, making RKT the **largest mortgage originator in the US.**\n\n**RKT's technology drives faster, better outcomes for end consumer**\n\nRKT's application process can be understood as \"parallel\" vs. the traditional mortgage industry's \"linear\" process. This results in faster approvals and faster closing times. RKT closes loans 25% faster than the industry average - 29 days on average vs. the industry average of 40 days. Not only is this good for the end consumer (instant-gratification millennials), it means RKT's workforce is significantly more efficient than the industry average, closing average of **8.3 loans per month per team member** in YTD 2020 vs. the **industry average of 2.3 per moth per team member**\n\n**In summary, the retail mortgage industry is in desperate need of digitization. RKT is perfectly positioned to capitalize on this need.** After all, who else is going to do this? Penny-fucking-Mac?\n\nTLDR: Go long RKT, I am long shares and will continue to add on dips.",

        "selftext": "Just got to thinking about all the money robinhood is skimming off the top, and the audacity of their name in light of this.\n\nOther firms report payment for order flow, at least on shares. TDA or Charles Schwab, for example are getting an average of about 1/10 of a cent per share... Robinhood doesn\u2019t post their data. \n\nThis is why Citadel and other huge trading firms pay more for robinhood orders, as there are no parameters publicly listed anywhere and they \u201cget away\u201d with taking more off the top. For shares, it can be a few cents.\n\n\u201cIf a customer buys 100 shares of Apple for $200 each\u2014a $20,000 purchase\u2014Robinhood could get up to $5.20 for routing that order to electronic-trading giant Citadel Securities LLC, according to calculations based on a recent Securities and Exchange Commission filing.\n\nSchwab would be paid around 9 cents for sending the same order to Citadel, while TD Ameritrade would get 16 cents on average, according to these companies\u2019 SEC filings.\n\nThat\u2019s a nearly 60-to-1 difference between what Robinhood and Schwab are paid. The gap isn\u2019t always so wide, because of differences in the formulas used to determine the size of the payments.

I placed the order for 20 contracts and it would not take the limit of 0.18 on RH, it kept saying that the trade has to be in 5cent increments so I had to place a limit buy with .20 limit. The order executed for 20cents a contract (total $400) and I was already down $40 as soon as the buy executed. So now I waited for the Corn report and knew it was bad. In a bid to minimize my losses I wanted to sell my contracts and they were still trading at 18cents for the 12c 08/21, but then again I was unable to place the sell order with a limit of 0.18 as RH said it had to be in 5cent multiples. So I placed a Limit sell at 0.20\n\nSo I decided to wait it out and see if by any chance the contract would go up in value to 0.20 so I can break even and sell at 0.20. Well the 8/21 calls started dropping in value and suddenly started trading at 0.13 not even 0.15. Now I just decided to sell no matter what and was forced to set limit of .10 since if I set it at 0.15 it would not sell, just like it had not sold at 0.20. So I end up placing sell limit order at 0.10 which executed immediately so my total loss within a span of couple of hours was 50% ($200) of my initial $400 investment.\n\nAm I making some rookie mistake here??",

        "selftext": "Hi, just a quick update on my macro sentiment trading journey. I\u2019ve posted my result here two weeks ago - I had 7 winning trades in a row and my account jumped from $10k to $30k. For those who missed my previous post - in my trades I\u2019m following the narrative that fundamentals now mean nothing since Fed started printing in March. Instead of using FA or TA I\u2019m now using macroeconomic sentiment analysis, which is basically a weekly survey of 150k analysts from 130 countries conducted by some company. They\u2019re asking simple questions like \u201cWhat\u2019s the employment situation in your inner circle: are people losing their jobs and have salary cuts or vice versa\u201d; and post several indicators based on it every week. It\u2019s not an ad so I\u2019m not sharing the company\u2019s name here (unless you ask in DM).\n\nSo, last week was no trade according to sentiments, but this week had a very surprising (for me) guidance - buy calls. I was a bit afraid to follow the call (pun intented) because I think there will be a correction pretty soon. \n\nAnyway, I\u2019ve bought SPY calls (327 strike) for $3.7-ish on Monday and sold today at $5.5-ish with 50% (about $5k) profit. I also was thinking about selling some 332 strike or so to make a spread, but decided just to take profit (don\u2019t want to reinvent the wheel). So this is my 8 profitable trade in a row (I know other sentiment traders had 12 wins in a row).\n\nI think I\u2019ll continue for a few weeks with the same risk-per-trade and then I\u2019ll increase my risk by two times. What\u2019s your thoughts re sentiment analysis?",

        "selftext": "[Gains](https://imgur.com/gallery/afMJcB4)\n\nI\u2019m very surprised about the lack of attention NVAX gets on this sub considering it has rallied much more than something like TSLA and is a pharmaceutical stock in the middle of a pandemic. Read this and maybe some of you autists can make up the money you lost on MSFT calls and buying KODK at $50.\n\nBackstory:\n\nI have held this stock since 2016 with nothing but diamond hands. In September 2016, they failed their stage 3 clinical trial and fell 84%. In 2019, they issued a 1:20 reverse split. I continued to be optimistic hoping their NanoFlu vaccine could bring some revival to the stock and even doubled down on my initial investment to get my average price down to ~$26. I was rewarded for this once COVID hit.\n\nWhy NVAX?\n\nNVAX was one of the first of the operation warp speed companies to receive significant funding, and they will be a key player in the development of a vaccine. It has, by far had the biggest % gain of all the warp speed companies. \n\nThey will be releasing their phase 1 clinical trial results after hours today.\n\nThe reason NVAX will be more successful than any of the other pharmaceuticals/biotechs is because they already have technology and experience from previous attempts in the type of vaccine that will be used. They use their owned recombinant nanoparticle technology to generate antigen derived from the coronavirus spike (S) protein and contains Novavax\u2019 patented saponin-based Matrix-M.\n\nNVAX, without any COVID vaccine is already incredibly undervalued as is. Their NanoFlu vaccine has shown to be very effective in phase 3 clinical studies and has already been shown to be much more effective than the version Sanofi has developed.\n\nAs a plus, unlike other CEOs of this sector dumping all their stocks, the CEO has increased his number of shares since the beginning of COVID.\n\nImportant events:\n\nMay 11 2020: Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) awards NVAX $384 million to advance clinical development of their COVID vaccine NVX-CoV2373.\n\nJuly 7 2020: Trump awards NVAX $1.6 Billion\n\n7/27: Trump visits FujiFilm factory that will be manufacturing batches used in NVAX Phase 3 trial and awards FujiFilm a $265 million contract.\n\nPhase 1 clinical trials are expected after hours today, so this may be your last opportunity before this stock truly goes to Pluto.\n\nThings ik you autists will say:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s already ballooned why would I buy in now\u201d\n\nPeople were saying this when it hit 40. People were saying this when it hit 70. Then 90. Then 110. Then 140. Somehow people are still bearish on this after it hit $160 yesterday. Today will be the biggest news NVAX will have regarding COVID, buy in today while you can.\n\n\u201cIt hasn\u2019t produced a single thing available on the market\u201d\n\nVery true, but this time is different. Right now, not only does it have the support of Donnie, it also has international support from CEPI as well as the direct funding from the likes of Bill Gates. The technology they have been working on for the past decade will directly be used in their vaccine.\n\n\nMy personal success:\n\nMost of my gains as you\u2019ll see are simply from holding the stock long term. I have also taken up theta gang strategies to sell very OTM options to degenerates as I have no need to take the risk of buy options at this level. At this point if I am forced to sell my shares, I will be happy to take my $4 million and run. \n\nI will admit, buying call options are incredibly profitable and decently easy to predict. For example, this was known to be a very big week for NVAX (even with earnings being pushed back) and it had been facing a resistance at $150 for the past three weeks. Even WSB autists can see that it would likely break $150 sometime this week, and in a pleasant surprise, it managed to do that today and hit a 52wk high in the process. \n\n\nTLDR; NVAX goes brrr. Stage 1 clinical trial data released after hours today will make NVAX go more brrrrr. Earnings coming out next week will make NVAX go even more brrrrrrrrr.",

        "selftext": "Yes I know what you're thinking Autist, as you sit on your gaming chair sipping your choccy milk. \"I've seen all these \ud83d\udc3b posts before and stonks kept going up, printer goes BRRRRRR\"\n\nFundamentals haven't mattered for months, and except for some sharp pullbacks, NQ and SPY have all been on an absolute tear being instabid on every dip.\n\nThat's all about the change.\n\nTldr - bond market/ PM pricing in no deal on stimulus.\n- Bifurcation of NQ and SPY reached major tipping points.\n- DXY likely to bounce back strongly on risk off sentiment and foreign central bank action.\n- macro long term positioning for Inflation playing out across asset class correlations ( RUSSELL and value stocks starting to gain traction )\n\n1.\nPriced In has become a retarded meme at this point but what does it actually mean? It means basically that the market, chiefly big \ud83d\udcb0 / institutions are expecting a future outcome ( or probability of one) and have allocated money appropriately. Historically Fixed Income due to its relative size has been a fairly reliable indicator. Previous crashes this year such as Feb/March crash and the mini NQ/SPY crash in June and July were both foreshadowed by major/ high Vol shifts downwards in 10 year bond prices .\n\nCurrently 10 year are plumbing new lows at the bottom end of 0.50 percent ( discounting the March flash crash ). This coupled with the meteoric rise in GLD and SLV last night IS NOT A GOOD SIGN. The sharp changes occured directly after stimulus news. \n\nWhat this means is that Institutions are signalling a chance the package will not be passed on time or in its entirety . \n\nBUT BUT VIX IS DOWN AND EQUITIES ARE UPPIES!\nyes little autismo, they are but that doesn't mean what you think it does. it's a poorly kept secret that this market is being kept afloat by hedge funds , institutional buying and retail fomo. I don't have the crayons or time to explain it to you but just look at news releases, support level buying and virus/ trade talks pumps. institutional players left the market in February , now it's just algos and retail. Vix being low doesn't necessarily mean what you think it does either. To oversimplify VIX goes up when more people buy puts. This is typically done hedge against market drops. \nBig players don't need to hedge if they SOLD all/ most of their equity holdings and moved it into Bonds/ Gold / Foreign equity. Hedge funds are also notorious for shorting VIX as part of the 'Fed Put \" trade . The fact that FI/PM are up while VIX is down makes me more certain of a drop not less as it means Big boys are trying to pass as many bags as they can to retail without spooking them.\n\n2. There's been a lot of articles on this already so I'll keep it short, you all know how to use Google. SPY since March lows has been split in two like a sociopathic Solomon. There is the big 5 tech and everything else. Currently Big 5 is sitting at 25 percent of all market cap with huge returns over the last few months. This coupled with the performance differential of the other 495 has surpassed levels not seen since the dot com boom. THIS IS NOT SIGN OF A HEALTHY BULL MARKET. Major Bifurcation is the second best signifier of a \ud83d\udc3b after the technical 20 percent drop level ( which doesn't really mean much) . \ud83c\udf4f Has now become the largest company in the world surpassing Saudi Aramco. THIS TECH BOOM IS NOT SUSTAINABLE. Most of the apple gains have been from a one of WFH structural shift and Fiscal stimulus ( that now accounts for 25 percent of all disposable income ). If the stimulus bill doesn't pass, Apple is fucked. Just look at the AAPL gains from the last week, do you think this is sustainable?\n\nThe common retort on this sub is, \" we all know it's a bubble but it will pop in few months, I'm getting my TENDIES while they're hot! \"\n\nThis sentiment has been thrown around for months all through April to July. Well what if months later is now? What better catalyst for a bubble pop than a Stimulus not going through as planned? \n\n3. There's been a lot of posts about DXY dying and a lot of it is half true. Currencies are a hard thing to predict but I do want to point out two very key factors that are bullish for DXY. \n3a- The entire world, especially emerging markets rely on Dollar inflows from exports to fund imports for key goods, especially commodities (oil etc). Global trade fell off a cliff in March and has barely recovered so where are countries getting dollars? By buying bonds . This was the reason behind the DXY spike to over 100 in March and the reason why the FX central bank swap program was instituted by JPOW. So unless you see global trade rebounding strongly in the very near term ( pigs will fly ) bonds will continue to be bid extremely strongly at auction, supporting DXY. \n\n3b) DXY as has been pointed out is primarily dropping due to Euro strength ( which makes up about 65 percent of the Index). When DXY is compared to the Bloomberg trade weighted dollar index you'll see it hasn't dropped far at all and this makes sense (see 3a above). The Euro bullish trend, along with AUD/USD,GBP/USD and JPY/USD is unlikely to continue much further. Foreign central banks and governments for that matter will not allow the dollar to crater. We've already seen rumblings from the EU and JPY on this front as exports are already in a tenuous position. The last thing foreign companies need is a strong currency to hamper export sales. So I wouldn't bet against the FED, but I sure as shit wouldn't be getting against the ECB.\n\nSummary: I don't see this stimulus playing out on time or in full. Big money is pricing in either a delay or being scaled back substantially to meet Republican demands. I won't go into the specifics of the political theatre because quite frankly it doesn't matter. PM/ BONDS are are all the signalling device you need.\n\nHow I see this playing out: The stimulus bill will pass on few weeks after a substantial Rug pull, similar to the 2008 TARP fiasco. I would strongly recommend either holding cash or going long DXY while this plays out. Either buy the dip on GLD/SLV with leaps or go long TLT at like 180c.\n\nPositions : short MNQ 3 units at 10530 and 1 ES at 3220. Yeah got in a little early, wasn't expecting the tech earnings blowout but have the margin to hold. \n\nLooking at GLD leaps for 06/21 300c when we get a pullback ( due to margin calls ).",

        "selftext": "A post was made [earlier this week](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/i38k65/fed_tlt_buys_tuesthurs_guarantee_a_50125_return/) recommending people buy the August 7th 170 Call options on TLT.  TLT is a long-term Treasury ETF by iShares.\n\nAs you can see, the post has been removed, but the comments remain.  I think this is a good learning experience.\n\nThe poster and several others advocated the purchase of these options at $1.25.  That means $125 per contract which would give effective control of 100 shares of TLT.  The claim was that it was \"guaranteed money\" because the Fed announced it was buying bonds.  The strategy was to buy at the beginning of the week and hold until expiration date or shortly before.  Let's see how this played out:\n\nAs you can see in the comments, people were showing price charts and drawing lines on them claiming they had made money etc.  It's easy to pull up a chart and draw patterns after-the-fact.  But what happened with the price?\n\nWell yesterday the price of these options was around $1.25-$1.29 per contract.  That is around the same as it had been earlier in the week, which is a break-even or a loss in terms of opportunity.  But that's not the scary part.  As of right now, the price is 5 cents.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/U85P3VS\n\nThe strategy in this was to buy 25 Call options.  That would run around $3,200 at the price the time the post was made.  Right now selling these contracts would get you $125, which means the trade is a -$3,075 loss or so.  Wiped out completely.\n\nI kept asking for people to post up screenshots of their order fills (the buy and sell tickets) to show us that they made profitable trades and weren't just drawing lines on a chart.  They refused.  Guys, be careful.  Lots of people recommend shoddy advice or they oversimplify how options trades work.\n\nDo your due diligence, ask for some screenshots to see if they have any skin in the game.  A lot of times these guys aren't even making the trades, they are just doing a look-back and claiming they were in on the position.  Things aren't so simple as \"The Fed is buying bonds, I'm going in heavy on call options!\"  It's more complicated.\n\nLet this be a cautionary tale.  I feel sorry for the guys who actually followed this position in and who are now looking at some large red numbers.  I get downvoted a lot for being \"condescending\" and a lot of other descriptors.  But I actually do care about investors losing money to half-baked ideas and my commentary hopefully steers people away from stuff like this.  Because innocent guys with a lower account value will take advice and run with it and take food off their own family's table unknowingly.  That's who I'm trying to help.",

        "selftext": "Feeling really dumb and depressed this morning as I was margin called for 380k. Hoping for some advice. Here\u2019s the story:\n\n1) Sold 10x AAPL 375c 21Aug20 \n2) Bought 10x AAPL 380c 21Aug20\nThe credit spread was about $3,000 at the time (mid-July), and max loss therefore should have been $2,000. \n\nI believe the short position was ITM, and long was ATM at the time, although this is irrelevant. \n\nThis morning I received an email saying my short position was exercised (fuck me, I didn\u2019t realize ex-div for AAPL was today). I\u2019m assuming they exercised it yesterday to qualify for the upcoming dividend. My broker (Questrade in Canada) did nothing with my long position, so I\u2019ve gone from a max loss of $2,000 to a much steeper one. I don\u2019t know what to do.. \n\nQuestrade rep convinced me to exercise my long position and sell the shares upon receipt. However, the share price has dropped $10 already today, so my loss has likely gone from $2,000 to $12,000 and could get worse if this drop continues. I submitted the request to exercise the calls and I\u2019m waiting for the shares. \n\nI entered this trade assuming my max loss would be $2,000. I thought questrade would require direction for the long position, cause I don\u2019t have 380k to cover in my account. \n\nTLDR; entered what I thought was a covered credit position, to later be naked and forced into to a $380,000 long position.",

        "selftext": "  \n\nI was introduced to options in 2005. \n\nA co-worker of mine, who happened to be a 9/11 Truther before that was a term, was all hyped up on the upcoming ER for Amgen. He went around the office on a manic high, telling everyone to buy short term OTM call options - or as we refer to them around these parts, FDs. \n\nAs part of our retirement plans, we each had Fidelity brokerage accounts. To enable options trading, however, you had to call Fidelity and answer questions about your level of financial smarts and how much money you had. The correct answers were, of course \"genius level\" and \"shitloads.\" I answered truthfully. My other coworkers did not. They got to options trading enabled. I did not.\n\nAmgen beat and some of these guys landed 8 baggers. My own officemate made $50k and promptly took his family to Disneyland. As you can imagine, I was dismayed that I missed out.\n\nFor the next few months, chasing the next big trade was all the rage, and our team could hardly get anything done. I got my account upgraded by answering the questions correctly, but every play the group made after Amgen was a loser. Because I never had that thrill of victory, I quickly lost interest, but the temptation to recapture those initial gains captivated some of the other guys. As the losses racked up, the trading group got smaller and smaller, eventually distilling down to the most degenerate off talking in the corner, the crazy Truther mumbling his false prophesies to his last few disciples. I lost about $1000 \u2013 which was no small change at that time in my life \u2013 but I know that some of the guys lost a lot more chasing that high.\n\nThat\u2019s still better than the snake oil the retail investment crowd is selling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor any market at any given time, Boggleheads and r/investing will tell you to just keep putting money in, no matter how badly you are getting fucked.\n\n*\u201c7% YoY in the market!\u201d* \n\n*\u201cThe greatest force in the universe is compound interest!\u201d*\n\n*\u201cIf you hold for the long term, you don\u2019t have to worry about volatility!\u201d*\n\nHere\u2019s the cold truth: the life advice Boomers give out is fucking outdated, designed for an analog world created by a Greatest Generation that coddled them, and that includes their financial advice as well.\n\nI am from the \u201c[Oregon Trail Generation](https://socialmediaweek.org/blog/2015/04/oregon-trail-generation/)\u201d, the last slice of GenX that actually grew up with computers. We are the cohort that witnessed the death of the American Middle Class that the Internet Age and Globalization, entering the workforce just as the dot-com bubble finally put it out of its misery.\n\nWhen I was 3, my grandfather retired from Boeing after 35 years. They gave him a platinum plated set of draftsman\u2019s tools, a brass desk clock and a lifelong pension.\n\nWhen I was 19, my girlfriend\u2019s dad was a consultant for Boeing. His job was to dig up dirt on upcoming retirees so they could be fired to deprive them of that pension.\n\nI did the *thing,* that good old American Dream \u2013 marriage, house, car, kids. I did what the \u201cexperts\u201d tell you to do: save a slice of each paycheck for retirement, invest in a college plan, buy a house as a solid investment. \n\nHere I am barely middle-aged, and I have worked through three major financial crises since I entered the workforce.\n\nI\u2019ve chased a runaway housing market, lowering my parameters every month because the prices kept rising faster than I could make for a down payment.\n\nTwice, I have had my retirement account fleeced, then had to draw down what was left to keep a roof over my head - paying a penalty to do so. \n\nI have been so upside down on a mortgage I\u2019ve considered burning the house down.\n\nSo I am here to tell you firsthand that *Save, Buy, Hold and Diversify* will not help you when the whole market collapses and you find yourself in need of that money, that a house is just an investment that you can live in while it drops in value, and that *Dollar Cost Averaging* is another way of saying *Getting Cucked.*\n\nI say, if you are going to make or lose 50% in the next 10 years, you may as well make or lose that 50% in the next 10 *hours.* \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn some ways, younger Millennials and Zoomers are better equipped to face these facts than us older folks. If you came of age during the GFC or later, you understand that the game is rigged. All that bailout money is moving around the market while you are struggling to make minimum wage in the Uber Eats gig economy. Unlike those of us who grew up in more stable times, you know in your bones the halcyon days - the ones you've only ever heard about - about are never coming back. \n\nNot for everybody, at any rate.\n\nSo enters RobinHood, and it drives the financial pundits absolutely berserk. Who are these fucking kids YOLOing on HTZ? Don\u2019t they know they are supposed to be investing that money into a passive index fund, or even better, one of those retirement-date funds with the massive expense ratios? It\u2019s fucking up the game for the rest of us! \n\nI have traded options on and off for years in the hopes of making a little pocket money. Fact is, when commissions were $8-$20 per trade (plus a fee per contract), there was no way a small-time retail investor could participate meaningfully. With free or no commissions, the calculus has changed, lowering the bar of entry for smaller investors who can enter and exit a position at any time with only the bid-ask spread the main concern.\n\nBoomers created a monster, and they have only themselves to blame.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLike many of you, when March hit, I jumped in to puts and lost a bunch of money. This is because I was using an old way of thinking about options, the only one available to small-time retail traders just a few years ago: \u201cI hope that this security makes a huge break in a particular direction.\u201d \n\nAfter this loss and subsequent reflection, I determined that the money was there to be had, just that I was taking the wrong approach. I developed a new strategy, one that takes advantage of the simple fact that I can enter and exit a position without significant commission costs. I began to diversify my targets, and enter smaller positions on those targets, so that I didn\u2019t have everything riding on one or two plays. I developed exit strategies - and followed them! \u2013 so that I could take my wins or cut my losses quickly and move on to the next trade. \n\nAnd most importantly, I made it a point to withdraw my gains, if any, at the end of every week.\n\nSince April, I have executed no less than 20 trades per week if you count option expiry. In 15 weeks, I have doubled my account value. Not because of some one-off spectacular play or because I\u2019ve been a bull a bull market. In fact, I\u2019m a bear, but using a pretty neutral strategy. I doubled my money because I adapted to this new trading climate, found what works for me, and simply stuck to it.\n\nDo I think that makes me some some sort of fucking genius? Absolutely not. I\u2019ve made some smart, conservative plays that turned really goddamned sour. I\u2019ve made some truly retarded plays that turned out great. I\u2019ve had good weeks, bad weeks, and weeks that amounted to an incredibly stressful waste of time. I still make a bunch of mistakes - weekly, if not daily. \n\nI am still prepared \u2013 waiting, even \u2013 for my whole account to get wiped out due to a cacophony of bad plays. In the end, these are all gut decisions. Do I feel good about this? For each of them, only time reveals if I am right.\n\nBut if I have taken one thing away from what I have learned so far this year, it is this: *anybody can make rent money in the equities market now*. You do not have to have a massive account to overcome the burden of commissions, or have a huge investment in dividend stocks to realize a gains-based income. And thank God for that, because the job market is not going to save you.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know the gain porn here is enough to make a man drool, and the loss porn is enough to make his balls retract into his stomach. Just understand those are always one-sided directional plays. It\u2019s all-in on a single ticker, a true YOLO, not unlike putting it on black at the roulette table. It\u2019s easy to get caught up looking at the massive gains and get stars in your eyes.\n\nBut forget the lambo and the gold-plated yacht for a moment and consider something more immediate, such as: \u201ccould I pay this month\u2019s phone bill with my gains?\u201d With the money you can pare off into a brokerage account, is it possible to avoid spending the the money you make doing whatever it is you do for someone else and make your phone service \u201cfree\u201d?\n\nFor example, if you have $1000 and you make a reasonably conservative play with an exit strategy of $100 gain and $100 loss (such as a deep OTM 45DTE bull credit spread on a decent stock that\u2019s been beaten up recently, with a hard exit 21DTE), the likelihood is very high. It is not guaranteed \u2013 you may end up down $100 from where you started. But what *is* guaranteed is that you will have to spend 8 hours flipping burgers or whatever at $12.50 an hour to make that $100 if you don't. (Yes, I know, *taxes \u2013* the point still stands).\n\nWhen you finally get to take that $100 out and pay the phone bill with it, it becomes very, very real. \n\nImagine getting to a point where your trading gains pay for the things you *need*, so you can spend the money you earn with your blood sweat and tears on the things you *want.*\n\nThis is what it means to have a \u201cS.M.A.R.T.\u201d goal \u2013 small, measurable, achievable, realistic and time-sensitive. When you conform your efforts to translate into something small yet meaningful to your life, it changes the perspective.\n\nBut even if you decide to take your bi-weekly retirement contribution and YOLO it on MU FDs, you\u2019ve got just as much of a chance of coming ahead with that as you do giving it to Mr. Market to hold for the next 20 years.\n\nBoomers will tell you \u201cmost day traders lose money!\u201d First, \u201cday trader\u201d is a specific term. But that aside, it is also true most businesses fail in the first year. In both cases, people get burned, give up and go back to what they know. They fail to plan, they fail to learn from experience, and they fail to persevere. \n\nThis is not an appeal to \u201cnot be average\u201d nor to keep \u201cchasing bad money with good\u201d - just to keep trying. Set your goals, manage your risk, hone your successes, and learn from your failures.\n\nAt no other time in history has it been possible for the average Joe to participate in the equities market with so little friction as commission-free mobile trading, and with so much leverage as weekly options. I know, because I\u2019m old enough to remember when stock quotes were in the weekly paper, and they were registered in one-eighths of a dollar.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TL,DR; T**o Hell with the haters like Cramer and his ilk. Keep learning and growing and trying to rake in tendies. The lambo isn\u2019t the goal - *financial freedom* is. An Ally savings account and a shit job the boss is trying his damnedest to offshore ain\u2019t gonna get you there. We live in a Merchant Republic awash in wealth, and you have the right \u2013 the obligation, even - to participate. Go get your fucking slice.\n\nI love you retards.",

        "selftext": "You\u2019ve probably seen a rising trend of bullish posts about Nvidia recently, whether it\u2019s about recent acquisitions being included in revenue, its management, or the semiconductor industry in general.\n\nYesterday, Evening Standard reported that $NVDA has locked in a takeover of Arm Ltd. from SoftBank for a reported 40 billion.\n\nThe reason this is important is that Arm owns instructions-set architectures (ISAs) for the chips within nearly every smartphone, along with a handful of other products. Usually, this isn\u2019t an issue, since SoftBank would sell the rights to produce these chips to Apple, Qualcomm, and others for a fee. \n\n$NVDA, unlike SoftBank, is an actual semiconductor company. They could potentially limit access to their ISAs so that $NVDA can become the sole producer of those chips. Or, due to SoftBank being in the sinosphere and $NVDA being American, potential tensions could arise from the recent economic sanctions.\n\nEither way, considering that the deal is essentially locked in, $NVDA is flying straight to tendie town. Arm is a powerful player in the semiconductor industry, and its acquisition by $NVDA demonstrates that the company is making big moves to become more prevalent. $NVDA could theoretically lockdown a subsector of the semiconductor market by restricting access to chips under Arm\u2019s ISA. And if the Don requests $NVDA restrict Chinese access to the ISAs, you can bet that it will get a fucking BOATLOAD of government subsidies.\n\nTL;DR $NVDA 520c 9/18",

        "selftext": "Silver (SLV) and Gold (GLD) have both had incredible rallies over the last three months. This has been driven mainly by uncertainty hedges and currency hedges (people worried about the world and people worried about the dollar). While the state of the world is definitely reason enough to jump into safe haven materials, Gold and Silver are both inexorably linked to the strength of the dollar. **AS LONG AS THE DOLLAR KEEPS CRASHING GOLD AND SILVER WILL RALLY.** \n\nFirst we need to talk about why the dollar will continue to crash and to what levels it will fall. The Dollar's strength is linked to (basically) two things: (1) Supply and (2) Demand. While other factors can move the dollar in the short-term, over long-term trends these two basic economic principles are responsible for the dollar's value. \n\n1. Supply: The Fed is printing shit ton of money. Like a shit ton of money. The Fed balance sheet has expanded to over $7 Trillion, and it's likely to go higher over the next year. This is because our economy is fueled by debt, and in order to pay back that debt, the Fed is forced to print more and purchase assets, so people/companies don't default on their obligations. This creates a sort of Zombie economy (kinda like what we had from 2008-2020) where the stock market soars, but the income gap gets larger. I don't want to get into any of that, but the point is the Fed is going to keep printing, because it's the only way to keep people from defaulting. If people are allowed to default on their obligations, we'll have a major financial crisis (like 2008). \n2. Consequences: The consequences of all this printing is that eventually it will devalue our currency. That being said, we're in no danger of inflation in the short-term. Because the economy is so in the shitter, we have massive deflationary forces, so printing money outright (increasing money supply) isn't going to devalue the dollar. Instead, the dollar will become devalued for reason number 2...\n3. Demand: The Fed is buying bonds and keeping interests rates at zero. This essentially guarantees the stock market wont crash and encourages people to borrow. It also means that fixed-income investments will basically yield nothing. So, where can people put their money?\n4. Consequences: The only real place is the stock market or futures market. With incredibly low marginal costs (borrowing money is cheap), the Fed has given the green light for people to speculate and buy equities. **This forces people out of Cash and into Stocks; therefore, demand for the dollar falls.**\n5. Putting this all together: With the long-term fear that money printing will devalue the currency, and the short-term pressure to get out of cash and into the market (not to mention economic uncertainty, credit worthiness, pandemic fears, and election nonsense) we get a perfect storm of dollar weakness. So how does this all look:\n\nThis is a graph of the Dollar Index (DXY) over the last 3-months:\n\n[DXY Index](https://preview.redd.it/zm8v2a7b22f51.png?width=961&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=730be8b6938dc27ef6408d94f512785e1ed55e9e)\n\nThe dollar has depreciated nearly 7%. This has led to the meteoric rise in Gold and Silver over the same time frame.\n\nGLD:\n\n[GLD Index](https://preview.redd.it/um7rmu9r22f51.png?width=965&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=86c9876ab4439bd8b5ae8c8bdfdae0f914d85338)\n\nGLD has increased nearly 20%, breaking through its all time high of $185 (2011).\n\nSLV:\n\n[SLV Index](https://preview.redd.it/clxdj4vs22f51.png?width=959&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ae01448381860e30c993b482714493e472b66d68)\n\n SLV has increased over 33% from its local high of $18 (2019).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhile these movements might look crazy and might make you think you've missed the train, you're wrong. Gold and Silver (especially Silver) have a lot more room to run. This is because the dollar still has a long way to go down. \n\n[DXY Long-Term Look](https://preview.redd.it/rensqvn842f51.png?width=1314&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=caad130adc90bf7d0f7e78ea259b2a76df8b610d)\n\nIn 2018 the DXY hit \\~$89 and currently it's sitting at $93.35, so in just the short-term it's likely to retest that low. That represents another \\~4.6% decline in the dollar. The 7% decline in the DXY so far has created a 20% rally in GLD and a 30%+ rally in SLV, so just off the likely movement of the Dollar, GLD and SLV should rally an additional \\~14% and \\~20% respectively (if they follow the same ratio of movement). However, in the medium-term, the Dollar will likely trend even lower. The next levels of support are $80 and $73 which get us into 2008/2011 territory. The amount of stimulus and printing being put into the market today is a lot bigger than it was back then, so I wouldn't be surprised if we went back down to those levels.  \n\nFinally, how will Gold and Silver rally given this trend in the Dollar. Well, GLD already took out its ATH of $185 (2011). The Dollar still has a long way to go down, and people are just starting to pay attention to GLD again, so we might easily see GLD reaching $295 by end of 2021. In the last GLD rally the metal moved up 2.69 times in 3-years. Currently, we've only seen the metal rally 69% (heh) over the last \\~2-years. Based on the historical comparison, GLD should easily hit $220 by EOY. I have no doubt there could be a pullback, but given the fact that we're entering a pivotal election, I think GLD will rally at least until the election. \n\n[GLD 2008-2011](https://preview.redd.it/gsbe3vmj82f51.png?width=1461&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bd79832f785bf0406b169e75267be256ba3d0f1b)\n\n[GLD 2018-Today](https://preview.redd.it/efv3x2wl82f51.png?width=1462&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e3bc94e48eadd64159dd71435e2930d32a3202ea)\n\nSilver is even more exciting. Looking at historical charts of SLV we see that the metal hit a high of $48 in 2011. In the 1980's it went even higher, hitting a record $118. The current price is $24, which means if it retests it's 2008 high's, you can still get a 100% gain from the current price. **I am willing to bet my mother's kidney's on the fact that SLV will hit $30 by EOY.** I'm also pretty confident that it will retest it's local high of $48 sometime in 2021. The best part is, the options on SLV are so fucking cheap it'll make you cream a river of tendies. \n\n[SLV 2008-Today](https://preview.redd.it/ufntjwg2a2f51.png?width=1445&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e9c70b130c17d7bbd4076e4e0c42d97361e93ec9)\n\nBoy's I cant stress this enough. Silver and Gold are only just beginning to rally, and there's a really really really good chance SLV goes parabolic. GLD is a much safer bet if you're trying to buy options (just cause of liquidity and size) but the upside potential of SLV is crazy good. Don't miss this shit. It's the easiest money you'll ever make outside of AMZN calls. \n\nKeep buying GLD until it hits around $295 (after that the historical move doesn't hold) and keep buying SLV until $50. For both SLV and GLD that could take between 6-months to 1-year. \n\nTL:DR\n\nGLD Vertical Spread 191/193 September 30th  Expiration.\n\nSLV Vertical Spread 27.5/29 October 16th Expiration.",

        "selftext": "A data scientist here. Recently developed a tool that analyzes options flow from the entire day to make short term predictions of 1-5 days. Wanted to share some of the alerts for the next week with you folks. Please let me know if this is something that everyone likes here and if I should continue it.\n\nThe tool is still new so please be careful with all the alerts. **I would recommend paper trading these for a few days and doing your own DD as well**.  The overall accuracy is around 60-70% which means it can make mistakes. Happy to talk more about how the tool works.\n\nBullish means the stock is expected to move up more than 1% from the  current  close at least 1 day in the next 1-5 days. Bearish means  the stock is expected to stay the same or go low in the next few  days. The definitions are a bit loose but the stock usually makes a decent amount in reality.\n\n# Bullish Alerts\n\n**$BABA**   \\- Bullish probability of 84.3%. This fell right at the 50 moving   average which usually acts as a support for a stock in uptrend ([https://i.imgur.com/zHVQEAV.png](https://i.imgur.com/zHVQEAV.png)).\n\n**$CHWY**   \\- Bullish probability of 75.1%. Again, a beautiful setup especially if   it falls on the support at $52 and starts to bounce back ([https://i.imgur.com/87PRrBI.png](https://i.imgur.com/87PRrBI.png))\n\n**$MSFT** \\- Bullish probability of 71.0%. As long as this stays above the support of $210, this is a good setup ([https://i.imgur.com/ap3wpn1.png](https://i.imgur.com/ap3wpn1.png)). Otherwise, it might fall down hard because of the gap.\n\n**$TWLO**   \\- Bullish probability of 67.2%. This is only a decent setup if it  stays  above the support of $245. Bad setup otherwise. However, the tool  is  bullish, so I have got to go with that. ([https://i.imgur.com/mBjDqeT.png](https://i.imgur.com/mBjDqeT.png))\n\n# Bearish Alerts\n\n**$SPCE**   \\- Bearish probability of 88%. This was predicted to be bearish about a   week ago and it has gone down a lot. Continue downward trend if it can   break the support at $17 ([https://i.imgur.com/jwH4yyu.png](https://i.imgur.com/jwH4yyu.png)) ([https://i.imgur.com/78hHgpw.png](https://i.imgur.com/78hHgpw.png))\n\n**$AAL** \\- Bearish probability of 87.5%. I **would be careful**   with this setup since the price  is forming a bullish triangle. If it   breaks the 13$ level, get out immediately as that is a good resistance   level ([https://i.imgur.com/vCnsdc9.png](https://i.imgur.com/vCnsdc9.png))\n\n**$SRNE**   \\- Bearish probability of 86.9%.

Love Ryanair and Wizz (though I haven't actually invested in any of those two, but in a US low-cost airline instead).

        "selftext": "Hello fellow degenerates. \n\n I know there has been 6 billion posts about silver, but none of them so far have addressed the unusually large number of open contracts for September. Most of them have just been money printer go BRRRR = inflation = silver go moon. So here's a fun little argument of why silver might enter the stratosphere faster than a hooker in light up sketchers during September. \n\nLike I said, the current open interest for silver September contracts is NUTTY\n\n[COMEX Silver Futures](https://preview.redd.it/772mapunqug51.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0e0b944dbbc70766eb70b90692f105d7c1edc7dd)\n\nEach contract represents 5,000 ounces of silver. Now, most of the time only a small portion of these contracts stand for delivery, say 1 or 2% amounting to \\~4 to 9 million ounces of silver. Back in July, an astonishing 17,294 contacts stood for delivery amounting to 86,470,000 ounces of the devils metal. For those of you that can't count, just understand that is a lot. \n\n[Silver Contacts standing for Delivery](https://preview.redd.it/901urvyarug51.png?width=648&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a83e739ffcc3996b381f67177a89c91a3c012f45)\n\nIf something similar happens in September, we might be looking at a similar number or more of silver ounces being delivered. So the question is, how much do the banks have? Glad you asked young autist.\n\n[COMEX - Registered and Eligible Silver in ounces.](https://preview.redd.it/bsdee47rrug51.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bb1cc36d27e3da9a3834549ba95b23a202050b07)\n\n As of today, there sits a total of roughly 335 million ounces of silver at the Comex across all the big boy banks. \\~128 million of that is registered for delivery, meaning can be used to cover short position and stand for delivery. The other \\~208 million sits eligible, meaning it meets the exchange requirements and COULD be moved over to registered if desired. Funny thing is, a lot of the banks have been moving their silver from eligible to registered in the past couple months, wonder why. For fun, here are the current standings for JPMorgan and The Bank of Nova Scotia.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/k5f3ovl1sug51.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=be44c4e4bf3c6f1359ce828efab40ef162c413e2\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xu98xvv4sug51.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1b624a4a89126f4f5ebb1019347b3969be10feea\n\nJPMorgan has \\~33.8 million ounces eligible, and \\~131 million registered, while the bank of nova scotia has \\~15 million registered, and 6.5 million eligible. Now what happens when a bank holds a net short position and the longs stand for delivery? Well, good things for the price of silver, bad things for the bank depending on how much they actually have in the comex. \n\nSo what does all this mean? This is probably going to play out either one of two ways: \n\n1. A large amount of contracts will stand for delivery such as in July. If its enough, maybe some of the big banks who have short positions might find themselves in hot water with their silver delivery amounts.  Basically, if enough longs stand for delivery, the amount of silver available to the market goes down = price goes up. \n\n2. Few of the contacts stand for delivery. This is the bear case, if this happens, you better hope your bet on silver being a hedge for inflation is right boys. \n\nTLDR; Huuuge open interest on September silver contracts. If enough stand for delivery you might be able to move out of your wifes boyfriends basement and afford health care. \n\nSLV 9/30 27C &amp; SLV 12/31 30C",

It has not yet triggered much inflation as velocity of money is down- savings rates are at record highs, so that money hasn't yet reached the economy. Inflation only rose at a 7.2% annualized rate in June and July.\n\nAccording to Milton Friedman inflation is (always) a monetary phenomenon, and it can take several months or more before inflation can become apparent following money printing.\n\nWhat are you doing with your spare capital? \n\n- Real estate, which is inherently risky due to a very weak commercial market due to the pandemic, and residential, in which evictions are banned and many tenants are defaulting, all while you're legally obligated to maintain properties.\n\n- Bonds, which currently yield very little but expose you to long term inflation risk. 10 year treasury yield is just 0.7%.\n\n-Precious metals were my answer in March, but they've since risen a ton.

        "selftext": "We've seen lots of posts recently from \"new\" investors freaking out over recent dips in the market and deciding whether they should get in or out. This is just a quick little post (and reminder) that anyone buying stocks should remind themselves about the impact of taxes on the trades their making.\n\nLets take the most recent meme stocks example: FSLY and NET\n\nLets assume you bought FSLY and NET on July 1 because you felt bullish going into the July 4th weekend. You would have bought Net at $37 and FSLY at $86.50.\n\nNow lets assume that you were smart enough to get out at the peak, which was August 4 for both stocks. FSLY would have sold for $116 and Net for $42.50. That means a 34% gain on FSLY and 15% gain on NET.\n\nBut here's something you should ALWAYS think about: if you sell you need to subtract 34% for the tax man since that holding was less than 1 year and it is taxed as income. So your 34% gain on FSLY is actually a 22% gain, and your 15% gain on NET is actually a 10% gain.\n\nNow lets do the numbers:\n\nIf you held FSLY for 1 year (until July 1, 2021), you only needed to get it to a price of $105 (not $116) to make the same money. For NET you had to hit a price of $40.70 (not $42.50).\n\nKeep all this in perspective when you look to \"take profits\" or \"should I keep holding my stock\".\n\nAlso, this DOES NOT take into effect the reallocation of capital. If you only have $100 to play with, and you bought FSLY at $86.50, holding for 1 year could be opportunity cost on other potential plays. In that case, you probably fucked up in timing your entry and exist. If you only have $100 to play, then what were your objectives on a stock that is already up 400% in 3 months? Did you expect another 100% movement after earnings because you prayed to JPow for more stimulus?\n\nBe realistic and critical about each move. These \"the stock is down, what should I do?\" posts are getting old. Here's a better question that should be posted to this sub: \"The stock is down to X, which is Y times the revenue to market cap ratio. I've done this research to indicate that the company can grow at this rate, which doesn't align to analysts. What are other people's opinion of my research so that I can more accurately assess my own personal price target for this stock I own, or am planning to own\" &lt;/rant&gt;",

It is an experimental approach that has also been adopted by some of its peers, including Moderna Inc and BioNTech SE.\n\nBank of America, Jefferies, and Credit Suisse are lead underwriters on the IPO.

        "selftext": "Earlier today my mom burst into my room demanding to know why there were bottles full of piss all over the floor. I told her it was just expired water, but she didnt believe me. She went on a rant about how its \"disgusting\", and that I shouldnt be so lazy and just use the toilet. After grilling me for half an hour, she then made me dump them all out.\n\n\nI'm not really mad that she found them, so much as she seems so upset about it this time. I think she knew about my habit before, as my used bottles would mysteriously vanish every once in a while.\nThen she took me to the garage and showed me a\u00a0WHOLE FUCKING CABINET\u00a0of piss bottles from my room. Apparently she stopped dumping them out because of the smell. She gave me \"until dad gets home\" to dump them all out. Took around 30 minutes to finish the job.\n\n\nThat's not the worst of it. I come back to my room and what do I find? My computer gone, and in its place\u00a0my dad holding a fucking mcdonalds job application!\u00a0He then proceeds to spend an hour grilling me on how I \"screwed up my education\" and how I'm being an \"ungrateful leech\". I tell him to fuck off with his wagie bullshit, and he threatens to make me start paying rent.\n\n\nidk what to do.\n\n\nThen I had a moment of clarity.\n\n\nI calmly explained that this is all the fault of Monster energy because they now make an energy drink with in a plastic extra wide-mouth bottle. That bottle is basically designed for this. I can't be blamed because I am being exploited by capitalism. Once your addicted to caffeine, you will have a hard time quitting. Also, once you experience the convenience of slipping your tip into that Monster wide-mouth bottle, you will make it a habit.\n\n\nI told my dad that this new plastic bottle design is absolutely revolutionary, nothing else like it in the energy drink industry. Rockstar and Redbull dont have anything like it.\n\n\n Surely I'm not the only person doing this. Monster has tapped into a huge underground market. I calculated all the money I've spent on these and it was shocking. \n\n\n\"Dad, I won't need a job at McDonalds, I'm going to make bank in the stock market.\"\n\n\nThey were so shocked by my brilliance that they were speachless!\n\ntldr; MNST 10/16 $90 calls are going to print like JPow after drinking 2 White Claws.",

        "selftext": "# Happy Saturday r/wallstreetbets\n\n**Introduction**: This is my first options trade. I know that none of you know who I am here yet, but you can check my post history if you need to see credentials. I started trading with my friend from gifted class back in the day and we found PPL due to my pennystocks screener that i expanded the price parameters on. My friend is very talented at fundamental analysis, so we'll start with him first. I also want to say thank you to this sub, I have learned how to trade options in about a month, and I appreciate all of you autistic traders who have helped me out. Some of you have recognized me in the webull comments of the S&amp;P500 as I've started trading those weeklies. I use an algorithmic prediction based on 140,000+ analysts filtered through machine learning. But I might start making posts on Sunday Evenings for that soon, after i have proof of its efficacy. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*I assume no responsibility if this becomes a losing trade, and you agree to hold harmless if you decide to take any trades based off of any info contained within this post. These are not recommendations to buy or sell anything.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# PPL DD from the bro \n\nIm still looking at PPL, but so far: Gas and Electric utility company (like \\[ \\] for us) with 10 million customers and 7B+ in revenue. Quick reference, \\[ \\] is at \\~$32/share with 300mil in income. PPL is $26 with 500mil in income.  \nThey have **9 seperate filings of insider buys** on *July 2nd*. Also on *April 3rd*, *Feb 18th*, *Jan 18th* and *Jan 2nd*. I havent yet verified if they were all the same people every time. Again, still looking.  \nThey promoted a new President in the last couple months, amd the outgoing President ALSO placed an insider buy on his way out.  \nFinancials look good. They have plenty of capital, were barely affected by coronavirus from what it looks like, but that will be confirmed on Aug 10th, when they report 2nd Q earnings.  \nOverall it looks strong. Looks weird to most the fundamental research ive done because of the amount of insider buys. It looks like they had some small share dilution since 2q 2019 but I havent found it yet. Suffice to say it wasnt much, as it only dropped earnings/share a couple pennies Q over Q. Im not sure what to make of it other than the company's executives are buying more and more at every opportunity, their share price is less than \\[ \\]'s, while all financial indicators say it should be higher. Even pre-covid levels are lower than \\[ \\]'s pre-covid levels.  \nIt is a utility company, so they arent known for volatility in share price. It did jump up to $30 briefly in June. It was on a nice rise before the covid collapse\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBack to me, trevandezz. They also have earnings August 10. Someone told me one time that when analysts raise their price targets before earnings, its a good sign. Idk how valid it is lol, but I saw this on the News tab of Webull. If you can explain the other stuff in here please do:  [https://www.marketbeat.com/instant-alerts/nyse-ppl-a-buy-or-sell-right-now/](https://www.marketbeat.com/instant-alerts/nyse-ppl-a-buy-or-sell-right-now/) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# How to Trade These Options\n\nPlease understand that I started learning how to trade options about a month ago, if I have screwed up any info, let me know. This is the part, where if you can't read charts you're gonna have a bad time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Firstly, here is a key for my charts*\n\n[Also, red candles are bearish, white are bullish](https://preview.redd.it/lw1cfbgbobe51.png?width=795&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bcea744bf8a5a2406ad598629beacf2734201e36)\n\nHere is the monthly chart for PPL. The end of the month is always a great time to check the monthly chart.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1dq992a1qbe51.png?width=1828&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9236cec3dd70cb980c29a4f79ed37c45dba6eb78\n\nFrom the Monthly chart, it looks like the bearish trend has reversed, as the June candle didn't engulf the previous candle, and July just completed a bullish hammer reversal candle. When we use the fibonacci tool to measure this current bullish trend, we can see that this retracement dipped into the 50% fib area (pink box), which is cool for me. The 127 fibonacci extension gives us a monthly (long term) target of $33.58, which is also confluence with weekly resistance in that area. And honestly that seems like a better valuation of this company. The price was actually at $36 in January before the beer flu hit. Do with that info what you will \n\n# As we zoom into the weekly\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u04dmef1sbe51.png?width=1828&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d7ed380244876e84428f6f1302bda78e4a99989c\n\nThe weekly chart has broken out of this range that it's been trading in. Great sign. The daily chart is basically the same info, if it can break through this next resistance, our short term target is $27.20\n\nNow, on to the options.\n\nI don't know how you bros do it, but I always just assume the contract will expire worthless and use that as my risk for the trade. You only want to lose $5,000 on this trade if we're wrong? Buy qty 75: 27c 8/21 [Options Profit Calculator](https://www.optionsprofitcalculator.com/calculator/long-call.html)\n\nThe price has to drop $3.67 for these contracts to be worthless next week before earnings. If the price moves in the upwards direction $3.67, your contracts are worth $18,000. If the price hits our final target of $33.58, you'll have $43,875. To me, I think we could hit $30.79 this upcoming week. Previous weeks have spiked in that same percentage, putting those contracts value at $25,200.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe IV charts look dope too, it's below the 252MA which is a buy sign to me. You never want to buy options when IV is over extended, pretty sure that's how people get IV crushed.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/w1c3dg2zwbe51.png?width=1451&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ebc1111b5a5c7906101478718aaa2285714bb46f\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTheta is literally $1.50 per day on each contract. Delta is $33, which is good right? Heres the option chart. Notice how these contracts hold their value quite perfectly til expiration. Hitting our target at $33.58 is a $43,000 profit. YUH\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rwgsthg9xbe51.png?width=703&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b220ce8a9a8c641e6d8f58a46735cc4130f4990c\n\nCheers bois",

        "selftext": "And not the fun kind, like Team Bulls vs Team Bears squaring off for the reward of profit. I mean the bad kind where our enemy is after our livelihood and freedom from a life of employee-servitude.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFrom a series of observations, what I can only now label as a bonafide \"revelation\" was born and I believe it to be in my best interest to plant this seed of consideration in the minds of my brothers-in-arms each day that we opt to expose ourselves to the mighty Market.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOf course you've heard of the \"Robinhood Flood\" (actually, I just came up with that but, that you know what it is anyways speaks to my term-generation skillz--more of those on display later), but I believe those that actually use Robinhood are but a (signfigantly-sized) sect in a much larger group that, together, has formed an entirely new race of traders/investors that were wise, willing, and able to heed the call from the Market that offers the opportunity to begin the shift to a new generation of particpants that will lead in the rebuilding of our world (by ever-squabbling over a price so that we may extract personal gain). This crew, I will call \"New Money\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis new race, comprised of anyone and everyone that, for whatever reasons, was previously not-involved with the Market, but has stepped up to the plate and put their life savings at risk just to play the hardest-game-ever-played, going up against the currently-inhabitant race of \"smart money\" whom were previously known to not be fucked with, but whose hubris has lead to the destruction of our future and the exposure of a window to change that, clearly, many could not pass on the opportunity to have a peak through. This crew, responsible for everything from Oil Wars to perpetual Debt Servitude, I will \"Old Power\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt the time of the signalling event, the inflows of New Money to the sacred ground was the talk of the town. In a moment of fear, the Old Power let slip just one message: \"This is...changing things.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs New Money educated itself and dove on every opportunity Old Power cut weight on to help navigate these uncertain waters, our YOLO-balls quickly proved to have been a valuable asset and led to some considerable funding to give this uprising the staying power it needed to suddenly become an actual concern of Old Power. After the public disgrace of a few of Old Power's most beloved heroes, the audience cheered; but, the response from Old Power was a stern \"Game on, then.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSoon after, and seemingly overnight, I woke up one day to find a new power at play in the Market. What yesterday was easy was suddenly not. Our enemy had stopped running and turned around to unleash some hard-ball on their new threat. Anyone believing this was going to stay easy was, surely, mistaken and it was time to start earning our keep and flexing our intellect if further ground was to be gained. The Fun Flood-in phase had officially progressed to what I will call phase 2, \"War kinda sucks...\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSince then, New Money appears to be holding it's own and doing well to sharpen their wit by preparing for the on-going battle with discussions and sharing of tactics, strategies, and tools in the reddit/facebook/message board communities. We've even got a nice handfull of our own would-be Youtube heroes that act as both on-boarding stations and news channels. Everyone is doing their part, and I just want to take this opportunity to say, \"fucking bravo!\". And with that, you're all up to speed, and I shall deliver warning which lead me here.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOld Power seems to have uncovered a weakness we've exposed, and it seems to be an effective strategy being used to thin out our numbers and send our zealous comrades fighting on the front lines back to the unemployment line. If we're not careful and work to overcome this, Old Power may claim control of the power positions and leave what's left of us holding nothing but bags full of \"COVID Plays\" and \"Pennies-until-yesterday\", at which point they can go back to safely ignoring us as we finish ourselves off with a race to the bottom by trading each other the worthless positions we paid an arm for right before getting run over by a landslide that leaves us with less capital and pile of \"Precious\"es to waste our time self-soothing over (\"\\[$15\\] next week!\"). No, my dude; it's \\[$7\\] forever. If you're lucky.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, what's this weakness we've exposed and has recently been used to give a hard slap of frustration and doubt in the longevity of this lifestyle? That, I will call \"Overconfidence in the Obvious\". The obvious could be anything that typically indicates price heading in a particular direction. Maybe it's worked for you countless times before or comes from a source you trust. Maybe it's a good/bad earnings report, announcement of offering/close to one, a candlestick pattern, MACD divergence, bla, bla, bla. I'm telling you, we have entered into a time when anything and everything you trust as a reason to take position in anticipation of the resulting direction needs to be considered suspect and proceeded with more cautiously than you've ever needed to before, because your trust in \\[whatever thing\\] has started to be exploited by Old Power (I assume, because they're the only ones with the bankroll to pull it off). Anytime that anything happens that seems obvious \"tomorrow is going \\[up or down\\]\", I think you will begin to see more and more often, it will defy all logic and make a major move against most people's plays and ginormous transfers of New Money wealth will find it's way back to Old Power as they proceed to squeeze you harder than you have the solvency to endure for \\[the morning/afternoon/two days/the week/etc\\] until they snuff out the Gulla-bulls and then profit from letting go and holding all the cards while you think \"I fucking knew it!\" and pile back in, after which they just bounce leaving you with the salty taste of their patented Double-Fucking secret recipe and smaller account size that will eventually lead to the PDT bouncers showing you back outside.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere it is then; proceed accordingly. My suggestions: remove the word \"sure\" from your trading vocabularly, wait to see what happens before taking a position, cut your losses early and not to just wait until \"ok, there it goes!\". Maybe we can throw them off a little by hyping the opposite of what we really intend to do on social media? And keep buying up those metals. Whoever wins this contest is going to them to survive the transition, and the later you get in, the lower your old:new wealth ratio is going to be. Hopefully I'll catch you on the flip side and not breaking in to rob my pantry next year.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nViva la revoluci\u00f3n.",

I bought shares in AMD PLC (Not because my PC is full of AMD stuff, but because more people would buy components during the lockdown period as they would have little to do, and would maybe take up PC gaming. Also, people would need new workstations for working at home.) At first, I thought it was a faliure, as AMD shares went on a small downwards trend. But, over the last month, AMD shares increased by 25%. I have now made a profit of 25%, with \u00a325 in stow (\u00a320 original amount + \u00a35 earned) (My dad is acting as a buyer on my behalf, he is investing larger amounts of his own money for long-term investments).

        "selftext": " Biorestorative Therapies (BRTXQ) is a biotech company that is developing treatments for lower back pain and obesity/Diabetes/weight loss. The FDA has approved them to continue with phase two of their lumbar disc regeneration trial using stem cells. But, the company filed for bankruptcy 20 March 2020.  \n\\*\\*I know, \"this guy is an idiot.\" Let me see if I can change your mind in the next 2-3 minutes.\\*\\*  \nWHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW:  \n1.) 20 March 2020 - Filed for bankruptcy  \n2.) April 2020 - John Desmarais (one of the best intellectual property lawyers in the U.S.) entered into a stalking horse agreement to buy the company. He would pay $500,000 to acquire the company, along with their assets (including their intellectual property). Once this came to fruition, the stock value hit bottom. It is currently **trading** at .0001-.0002.  \n3.) Bankruptcy proceedings continued, the final hearing is in August. It was seeming as though the company would be purchased by Desmarais. THEN LAST MONTH, a large investment firm, AUCTUS Capital, threw a golden wrench into the bankruptcy process.  \n4.) AUCTUS has supplied money to Biorestorative to continue their business as usual. They have agreed to supply funding as well and hired their own lawyers to cancel the deal with Desmarais.  \n5.) Together, AUCTUS and BRTXQ have scrubbed their financials, cut the fat out of the budget and plan to begin their phase 2 trials and get BRTXQ back on the NASDAQ immediately after the bankruptcy proceedings. NOW, ON TO THE GOOD STUFF!  \n6.) BRTXQ's plan states that all equity holders will retain their equity (aka shares of common stock). No reverse splits, no issuing new stock that has to be traded for old stock. This is in part due to the fact that AUCTUS holds nearly $3 million in notes for BRTXQ, issuing new stock would wipe that money out. No one would want to see that happen, so this company has a HUGE investor fighting for it and the shareholders. This is in their plan, which is posted to their website under their Investors tab.  \n\n\nWhy am I posting this? Because it has happened before..  \nAmerican Axle &amp; Manufacturing - 2009 low was .29, 2015 rose to $26  \nConcur - Low of .11 then rose to $129 for a 41,000% increase  \nGeneral Growth Properties - Low of .31 to $25 to a 8,100% increase  \n\n\nI don't care if you buy, and this is no attempt to convince people to buy. I just wanted to throw it out there for others to see. These things do happen.  \nBRTXQ is currently trading at .0001-.0002, last year the company was NASDAQ listed (delisted in March 2020 due to bankruptcy declaration) and had a yearly stock price range of .40-.80.  \n\n\nI have read the bankruptcy documents as they have been made public, and this company has had life brought back to it. If it works out, I hope it works out for all of us!  \nDISCLAIMER:  \nI currently hold positions in BRTXQ. This should not be taken as investment advice in any way.

I've been studying technical and fundamental analysis of stocks/cryptocurrencies for the past 2 years in anticipation of this.  My strategy is to rent a cheap place for a few years instead of buying real estate and wait for the right opportunity to invest my money into stocks instead. Currently most of the stocks are overvalued and it is highly probable if not inevitable that there will be a correction coming in the next few months which would create opportunities to get into some of the stocks. What are some of your tips in the case that another major correction in the markets happen? I am interested in high growth industries like cannabis and tech which have potential to 2x within months after a crash as was the case during March of this year.",

        "selftext": "Earnings is in a 4 days.\n\nI decided to short it because I am a perma gay bear and shorting hot growth stocks that result in me losing money makes me hard.\n\nFrom what I can gather, opinions on SQ is split as there is a lot of bullishness on their cashapp and also bearishness in their small business exposure.\n\nEarnings concensus are already negative -0.05 eps compared to their previous quarter of -0.02 (Actual) and 0.13 (Expected)\n\nBut even if they were to fall short on earnings, the price might still go up due to perceived bullishness regarding the growth of cashapp\n\nHowever, i am net short on SQ because\n\n1. Around 55 percent of their revenue from Q1 was from transaction fees which comprises of at least 50 percent small business and many of which have closed/have decreased revenue or have went bankrupt.\n2. The faster growing side of their business is the subscribtion service it offers to businesses and cashapp users. For the sellers side (businesses). They have mostly waived the fees as mentioned in their Q1 earnings call. For cashapp, I am not entirely sure about this but I would think that most customers use the services without paying a single cent which really does not add much to the overall revenue. (influx of users due to the stimulus money probably use it for free, but they are technically still a new potential customer which is the aim of SQ)\n3. Every p2p transfer actually costs SQ money and i definitely see their profit margin dropping for cashapp.\n4. Their stock platform is subpar and not comparable to most brokers and their bitchc0in platform has a minimal margin and its treated more as a gimmick.\n\nHaving said that i cannot deny the meteoric rise in users of the cashapp and this does easily create a network effect and switching cost (of time/convenience) and even if these free users do not result in revenue now, they might in the future.\n\nDo tell me if i missed anything. (most of these info are gathered from their Q1 earnings from their investors relations webpage under Q1 2020 [Investor relations](http://squareup.com/us/en/about/investors)\n\nBut so what if they fall short of earnings, so what if their margins drops, just like in Q1 when their earnings fell short and their revenue growth stunted, it still went up as stocks always do and I think i might just be a gay bear that deserves to lose?",

        "selftext": "For those of you that have not seen my previous posts about the case for a big uranium bull market, check out [this one](https://amp.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/hp9966/the_case_for_a_big_uranium_bull_market_and_what/) for an explanation of the sector with recommendations and [this one](https://amp.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/huo47l/uranium_miners_are_showing_big_growth_with_many/) for a recent market update.\n\nSince these posts we have a had a big run up, but also a big drop this past week. I got several messages from people that wanted to know what happened to make these stocks drop so much after it looked like the bull market finally got started. Well don't worry because the bull marker has already begun and we are still very early into it, with many uranium stocks still severely underpriced to what they can offer.\n\nSo what happend? Well Cameco had a conference call and the market did not like what they had to show in terms of their earnings report, but why have they taken down most of the other uranium companies as well then? Because they announced they were bringing Cigar Lake, seen as the single best uranium mine in the world, back into production starting September. The market was clearly afraid that this would disrupt the supply deficit so many people are counting on to propel this bull market foreward, but what happened was a severe overreaction.\n\nThe fact Cameco put their mine back online means one thing in the eyes of the industry insiders, which is that they cannot fulfill their contracts by buying from the spot market like they have done so many times in the past few years. This tells me the spot marker is tighter than ever and with Kazatomprom also looking to buy supply from the spot market and sell from their own reserves, the total amount of mobile global supply is dwindling. It is projected that this year alone, 40 million pounds of uranium will not be able to reach the market, a gap that is only going to get bigger as years go by and demand increases.\n\nWell it seems like more and more people, even some very cautious and conservative ones, are predicting the market to reach highs even beyond those seen in 2007. This is because 2007 was caused by the flooding of Cigar Lake and a percieved supply deficit for nuclear power plants. Now we have: \n1. a real supply deficit that literally won't even be solved if all mines in the world start producing at full capacity right now, because by 2030 we will need several more Cigar Lake grade mines \n\n2. way fewer viable companies in the sector that can claim a part of the capital flowing in (from 500 to 40 roughly) \n\n3. a lot more power plants under construction and being proposed around the world \n\n4. generally a better sentiment and more support for nuclear power than in 2007, even the Democrats and Republicans agree for once that we need nuclear power and for that we need constant uranium supply \n\n5. the possibility of way more capital flowing in by: the people that made tons of money off of the previous bull market and will undoubtably do so again if given half a chance, retail investors who jumped on the rocket with bitcoin, cannabis and other similar investments on online platforms like Robinhood and hedge funds that now see the possible profits that can be had and are adding uranium to their portfolios\n\nPersonally I am more bullish than I have ever been about any other possible investment idea and I have made uranium stocks take up a very significant part of my total portfolio for that reason. Coming monday will be an announcement from Kazatomprom where they will likely state that, in accordance with Kazakhstan's 2 week extension of their lockdown, the uranium production will not be resumed for at least the coming weeks. If the market reacts how everyone thinks it is going to react, next week will be the last chance to get into these companies before the market rises another big chunk and I have thus added to Cameco, Energy Fuels and Denison Mines.\n\nTLDR: This is more than likely the last sell-off to end the first part of this bull run and there are another 9 parts to this. After Kazakhstan announced another 2 weeks added to their lockdown, the bullish sentiment got even greater and to add to it Cameco and Kazatomprom are buying reserves from the spot marker, further depleting mobile supply. The bull case has only gotten better and these prices are just about as on sale as they will get until the bull goes parabolic",

        "selftext": "I am posting this here as, many of you are new traders, with little capital in your brokerage account, exactly the type of person who would fall victim to this scam.\n\nWill Karaman(Other aliases: William Karaman, William Michael Karaman) is a person who opened multiple options trading \"strategies\" that do not give the trader an edge(*hint: none do, there is no edge, sorry*). Recently, in April, after the Mid-March-Meltdown, he opened two groups(options society and investors society) costing about $500 each.\n\nIf you were unfortunate enough to pay for one of these programs, you would receive an invite to a Discord chat to the corresponding group. According to Karaman, he earned, about 70-75k from this scheme(140-150 users from both programs combined). Karaman had amassed a portfolio value of about 400-500k before the revenue from the webinar. After launching this webinar, he had hired a few different people - one of them 'infamously' named \"Yanni\". After hiring a 'team' of people to run this business. Karaman spent no time, spending his newfound cash on risky FD's(using margin &amp; credit), lavish AirBnBs, renting exotic cars, and doing drugs(K2 &amp; Xanax - He thought he was smoking marijuana and popping adderall?). This, of course, blew up in his face.\n\nOn June 20th, everything went dark, Youtube channel was taken down, and all that remained, was a Snapchat story showing a loss of 106,000.00 or 101.5% of his portfolio value on the Robinhood app. He took out a 30K LOC from Chase, and essentially YOLO'd it on SQQQ calls and TSLA puts to achieve this accomplishment. He also lost 40k of his father's retirement money on similar risky options plays(*citation needed*). Yanni, evidently treated an employee of Modera Central(The apartment Karaman was living in at the time) with disrespect, and caused commotion well after \"Night hours\" set by the apartment, and the City of Orlando on multiple occasions. This ofcourse led to Karaman being evicted from the apartment. He flew his roommate he was living with at the time to California(*citation needed*), and he was going to live with him. The roommate, in an act of good judgement, decided not to rent with Karaman, rendering him homeless.\n\nThe spice(K2) that was given to Karaman, apparently had some very bad health effects, that led to disastrous use of these two drugs(Xanax a CNS depressant and K2 a stimulant). At this point, he went to the only people who he knew would actually care about him, his parents. His parents very quickly sent him to a drug rehab center for a total of 8 days(*Citation needed*). While he was there he was prescribed Zyprexa, an antipsychotic used to treat schizophrenia and bipolar disorder; likely indicating his issues are not a direct result of an acute drug addiction.\n\nOn July 15th, he announced he was no longer taking the Zyprexa, this led to his last few videos to showcase very unusual and manic, and unstable behavior. He announced personal details, that probably would be taboo or disrespectful to release, such as - Yanni's Parents own the Greek Corner in Downtown Orlando. He held a public meetup at the Robinson in Downtown Orlando, which only 1 of his personal friends showed up, while he claimed adamantly, he had a \"whole team\", which was discovered to be a lie. He later said, that he was approved for a penthouse apartment at 55 West, this in my logical belief, has to be a lie as well. The apartment in question is a 3 bedroom, 3 bathroom apartment that has a value of \\~3,000 monthly rent, and since 55W requires 3x rent in monthly income; that means that Karaman would have to make 9,000/month to live there(notwithstanding his prior eviction, which would disqualify him for renting for 2 years regardless(*citation needed*).\n\nAs of July 19th, his second new Instagram account has been removed, likely for harassing people who DM him for money. Nothing has been heard from Karaman since July 15th. It is likely he is staying in hotels/motels in the Downtown Orlando area, or he lives back with his parents(There is no evidence to support either claim).\n\nOn or around July 21st, he allegedly passed out while in public, he was taken to a hospital where he pulled a fire alarm. He was subsequently placed under Florida Baker Act. Once released from the hospital, he made 2 Instagram posts totaling over an hour, trying to get his 'followers' to buy items that were purchased during his manic episode, such as computer parts, MacBooks, books and random electronic items he had accumulated. He claimed the funds would be used to trade option contracts, when he has -$30,000 balance with his Chase LOC, it is assumed he was living with his parents at the time. It is confirmed he was still trading with a $300 TD Ameritrade account, where he verified his losses, totalling over $100,000.  \n\nOn Tuesday July 28th, he was evicted/kicked out of his parents house by the police, rendering Will homeless. He spent the remainder of that day, wandering around, and later harassing the store manager at the Oviedo Publix, causing another police presence. It is assumed he moved back with his parents by that evening.\n\nEither later that evening, or the evening of the 29th, his parents(or Will himself) called the police. This led to the police placing Will under Florida Baker Act once again, where he was taken to a psychiatric treatment center. I did not pay for this program, but a few over at wsb did, and provided information to exactly what happened.\n\nThis is my Wikipedia timeline of this particular scammer.

        "selftext": "TL;DR: if you own or are watching MARA, follow BTC extremely closely before the market opens Monday.\n\nSome of you probably noticed MARA\u2019s precipitous AH climb yesterday, a good jump during the day followed by a sudden 40% ride after hours. \n\nA quick explanation of what they do: it\u2019s a couple of guys with a system to mine Bitcoin (BTC). While bitcoin has been extremely out of the realm of penny stocks for years now, it\u2019s because of this that MARA has become very sympathetic to the price of BTC\n\nThe company recently added a large amount of mining capability, so that\u2019s one reason for the sudden jump.\n\nThe second, and more important one to follow, is the price of Bitcoin.\n\nThis morning, Bitcoin hit its 10-month high around $11,500, which a LOT of people have been waiting on. It\u2019s currently soared past that to $11,665 (as of this post).\n\nTHE POINT IS that if you own MARA, keep an eye on Bitcoin this weekend. If it continues to hover or rise, watch your MARA stocks even more closely for market open. It has the potential to absolutely skyrocket as it\u2019s sympathetic to BTC.\n\nA few warnings/disclaimers: I\u2019m in NO way calling this DD since, if I\u2019m being honest, I have no idea how cryptocurrency works. It\u2019s highly volatile and from what I can tell is based on speculation. Also, today is the anniversary of Bitcoin Freedom day, where they won some landmark case towards being considered an actual currency, meaning this could be a celebration pump.\n\nEvery other major cryptocurrency seems to be skyrocketing at the moment as well, in what I assume to be a crypto sympathy to BTC.\n\nMy Positions: MARA $5 calls 12/18, and 400,000 DOGE. I plan to add MARA $10 calls 12/18 depending on what happens Monday.\n\nGood luck, and I hope you all make a bunch of money this week!",

        "selftext": "And not the fun kind, like Team Bulls vs Team Bears squaring off for the reward of profit. I mean the bad kind where our enemy is after our livelihood and freedom from a life of employee-servitude.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFrom a series of observations, what I can only now label as a bonafide \"revelation\" was born and I believe it to be in my best interest to plant this seed of consideration in the minds of my brothers-in-arms each day that we opt to expose ourselves to the mighty Market.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOf course you've heard of the \"Robinhood Flood\" (actually, I just came up with that but, that you know what it is anyways speaks to my term-generation skillz--more of those on display later), but I believe those that actually use Robinhood are but a (signfigantly-sized) sect in a much larger group that, together, has formed an entirely new race of traders/investors that were wise, willing, and able to heed the call from the Market that offers the opportunity to begin the shift to a new generation of particpants that will lead in the rebuilding of our world (by ever-squabbling over a price so that we may extract personal gain). This crew, I will call \"New Money\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis new race, comprised of anyone and everyone that, for whatever reasons, was previously not-involved with the Market, but has stepped up to the plate and put their life savings at risk just to play the hardest-game-ever-played, going up against the currently-inhabitant race of \"smart money\" whom were previously known to not be fucked with, but whose hubris has lead to the destruction of our future and the exposure of a window to change that, clearly, many could not pass on the opportunity to have a peak through. This crew, responsible for everything from Oil Wars to perpetual Debt Servitude, I will \"Old Power\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt the time of the signalling event, the inflows of New Money to the sacred ground was the talk of the town. In a moment of fear, the Old Power let slip just one message: \"This is...changing things.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs New Money educated itself and dove on every opportunity Old Power cut weight on to help navigate these uncertain waters, our YOLO-balls quickly proved to have been a valuable asset and led to some considerable funding to give this uprising the staying power it needed to suddenly become an actual concern of Old Power. After the public disgrace of a few of Old Power's most beloved heroes, the audience cheered; but, the response from Old Power was a stern \"Game on, then.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSoon after, and seemingly overnight, I woke up one day to find a new power at play in the Market. What yesterday was easy was suddenly not. Our enemy had stopped running and turned around to unleash some hard-ball on their new threat. Anyone believing this was going to stay easy was, surely, mistaken and it was time to start earning our keep and flexing our intellect if further ground was to be gained. The Fun Flood-in phase had officially progressed to what I will call phase 2, \"War kinda sucks...\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSince then, New Money appears to be holding it's own and doing well to sharpen their wit by preparing for the on-going battle with discussions and sharing of tactics, strategies, and tools in the reddit/facebook/message board communities. We've even got a nice handfull of our own would-be Youtube heroes that act as both on-boarding stations and news channels. Everyone is doing their part, and I just want to take this opportunity to say, \"fucking bravo!\". And with that, you're all up to speed, and I shall deliver warning which lead me here.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOld Power seems to have uncovered a weakness we've exposed, and it seems to be an effective strategy being used to thin out our numbers and send our zealous comrades fighting on the front lines back to the unemployment line. If we're not careful and work to overcome this, Old Power may claim control of the power positions and leave what's left of us holding nothing but bags full of \"COVID Plays\" and \"Pennies-until-yesterday\", at which point they can go back to safely ignoring us as we finish ourselves off with a race to the bottom by trading each other the worthless positions we paid an arm for right before getting run over by a landslide that leaves us with less capital and pile of \"Precious\"es to waste our time self-soothing over (\"\\[$15\\] next week!\"). No, my dude; it's \\[$7\\] forever. If you're lucky.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, what's this weakness we've exposed and has recently been used to give a hard slap of frustration and doubt in the longevity of this lifestyle? That, I will call \"Overconfidence in the Obvious\". The obvious could be anything that typically indicates price heading in a particular direction. Maybe it's worked for you countless times before or comes from a source you trust. Maybe it's a good/bad earnings report, announcement of offering/close to one, a candlestick pattern, MACD divergence, bla, bla, bla. I'm telling you, we have entered into a time when anything and everything you trust as a reason to take position in anticipation of the resulting direction needs to be considered suspect and proceeded with more cautiously than you've ever needed to before, because your trust in \\[whatever thing\\] has started to be exploited by Old Power (I assume, because they're the only ones with the bankroll to pull it off). Anytime that anything happens that seems obvious \"tomorrow is going \\[up or down\\]\", I think you will begin to see more and more often, it will defy all logic and make a major move against most people's plays and ginormous transfers of New Money wealth will find it's way back to Old Power as they proceed to squeeze you harder than you have the solvency to endure for \\[the morning/afternoon/two days/the week/etc\\] until they snuff out the Gulla-bulls and then profit from letting go and holding all the cards while you think \"I fucking knew it!\" and pile back in, after which they just bounce leaving you with the salty taste of their patented Double-Fucking secret recipe and smaller account size that will eventually lead to the PDT bouncers showing you back outside.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere it is then; proceed accordingly. My suggestions: remove the word \"sure\" from your trading vocabularly, wait to see what happens before taking a position, cut your losses early and not to just wait until \"ok, there it goes!\". Maybe we can throw them off a little by hyping the opposite of what we really intend to do on social media? And keep buying up those metals. Whoever wins this contest is going to them to survive the transition, and the later you get in, the lower your old:new wealth ratio is going to be. Hopefully I'll catch you on the flip side and not breaking in to rob my pantry next year.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nViva la revoluci\u00f3n.",

Annualized 5 year return of QQQ is 19.96% while that of EQQU is 19.41%, and a dividend yield of 0.64%, QQQ would only incur a withholding tax of 0.64\\*0.3 = 0.192%, making it still more attractive than EQQU (19.96 - 0.192 = 19.768%).  \n\n\nEven if we compare a higher dividend yield ETF like IVV/SPXS, the savings in witholding tax is still eliminated by the worse returns (11.42% -&gt; 10.96%).\n\nIs there any point in buying Irish-domiciled ETFs at all? Especially since brokers tend to charge lower commission for US ETFs, along with greater liquidity and tighter spread.\n\n  \n[https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/QQQ:US](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/QQQ:US)  \n[https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/EQQU:LN](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/EQQU:LN)\n\n[https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/IVV:US](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/IVV:US)  \n[https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/SPXS:LN](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/SPXS:LN)",

        "selftext": "Some background: I\u2019m 24, and I only learnt about the concept of trading in 2018. And when I did, it took a long time to digest. In fact, it\u2019s still hard to wrap my head around. People make money by speculating money? That\u2019s the dumbest shit I\u2019ve ever heard. Put money in. Number go up? You make money. Number go down? You lose money. How to know when money go up or down? Use math lines. Read some news. But you can use math lines and news to prove possible movement in either direction at almost all times. The fuck? Price moves, some dude says \u201cSee my lines were right! Follow me!\u201d And people do. Then he gets it wrong the next time. Some other guy is like \u201cSee guys that guy is wrong, I\u2019m right, look at MY lines!\u201d It\u2019s madness. God abandoned the trading industry a long time ago and it\u2019s now riddled with STDs.\n\nAnyway, people are making the big bux doing this, so I\u2019m clearly too stupid because I can\u2019t understand any of it. Whatevs, I\u2019ve got like 0.5 shitcoins with me, and it\u2019s not an insignificant sum to me. But I don\u2019t count it as part of my savings. I\u2019m like, fuck it, it\u2019s internet money that\u2019s so volatile that some angry Chinese mom can pull the plug off her son\u2019s mining rig and the price tanks. I don\u2019t know. Leave it in there, see what happens every few months.\n\nSo I check every few months and I see it go up and down. Every time I see it go up, I think to myself \u201cI should probably cash it out into fiat\u201d and I never do because I genuinely don\u2019t trust myself with handling my own hardware. One wrong character and I can send my money into oblivion? No thanks. But I sorta regret it when I see it go back down again. So this time when I saw the news about banks getting their hands all over shitcoins, and that the price moved up to 11k at the end of July (Usually around 9k), I\u2019m like, fuck it. This is my CHANCE. Sell it before it goes back down as it usually does.\n\nI whip out the hardware, send it to my exchange, and sell that shit. Boom. I got 7.6k SGD (unit price was around 11.3K USD) Amazing. Bravo. I lie down on my bed and feel like a fucking champion. A hour ago, I basically had glorified reddit karma. Now I have actual cash money. I\u2019m ballin. My mom would be proud.\n\nSo I say to myself, alright. That\u2019s enough. Price is probably going to settle back down to 9ish or 10ish sometime soon, and I\u2019ll buy back in then.\n\nOk so I wake up halfway through my sleep cycle and I see a notification that another shitcoin just broke 400. I\u2019m like wtf. Half awake, I check the price. 11.9K USD SERIOUSLY???? So I stare at the 5 minute candles for half an hour, while half awake. It\u2019s mostly green, just climbing and climbing. I\u2019m like, what the fuck, is this just gonna keep going up? Let\u2019s see. It hits 12 and KEEPS going out without pullback. I\u2019m like, holy fuck this thing is gonna keep going for a while. Maybe... I should buy it right now, and then sell it in a few hours. I mean, sure, I\u2019m buying it at a higher rate, but it\u2019s CLIMBING. And has been climbing for the past 30 minutes without fail. So I think, put money in, number go up, take money out. There\u2019s no way I can lose here. I just watched this thing climb for 30 minutes straight.\n\nSo I\u2019m half awake, and I buy back in with all the cash I\u2019ve got. Simple, pushing buttons. Oh, I\u2019m doing this all on my phone by the way. Yes, I\u2019m a retard. We\u2019re all thinking this. I go back to my exchange and I swear to fucking god, the thing starts moving down to 11.9K again. I\u2019m in disbelief. Is this a game? Am I being watched? I literally just saw this thing go up for 30 minutes straight.\n\nI think to myself that I\u2019m probably just imagining all of it because I\u2019m now invested. It\u2019s probably fine and I should check back in a few hours and it would have gone to 12.5K or whatever. I shouldn\u2019t be looking at 5 minute candles, it\u2019ll drive anyone insane. But it\u2019s tempting. I\u2019m assuming this is what men struggle with when deciding if they should stick their dick in crazy. It\u2019s a tough decision. Should I? Maybe just for a while. Then I\u2019ll stop. Maybe a little bit more. Who knows where it will go?!? It\u2019s so exciting.\n\nOUT OF NOWHERE, and I mean, OUT OF FUCKING NOWHERE, the price TANKS from 12.1K to 10.5K (13%) IN TWO 5 MINUTE CANDLES. I wake the fuck up and I\u2019m like OH MY GOD SOME CHINESE MOM JUST UNPLUGGED SOME SHIT. I can\u2019t believe it. What the absolute FUCK???? [PLEASE see the image attached](https://imgur.com/a/WPgDfBM). It was absolutely batshit insane. It came out of nowhere. I got the air knocked out of me.\n\nI stare at it like, there must be some mistake. But nope, it\u2019s right there. And so here I think, is this\u2026.going to climb back up? Why would it? All the bots would be triggered to sell. Any sane individual would see this and be like, fuck this bullshit fake internet money BS. Can\u2019t trust no one. All hail fiat. All hail the banks.\n\nI\u2019m thinking that it\u2019s just going to keep tanking because everyone is going to have trust issues with it now. The crazy bitch you fucked just had a manic bipolar episode and burned all your clothes because she had a bad dream. Why would you stay? So out of what I thought was common sense in the moment, I cut my loses and sold, essentially burning myself of a little over 1K SGD. My mom would opt in for postnatal abortion.\n\nThen, as I see my pathetic fiat remains, I see price actually climb back up slowly. People actually witnessed what I witnessed and kept buying in. I don\u2019t understand the world. I spent the next couple hours trying to think of how to get myself out of bed. Eventually, I called a very close friend who\u2019s a trader and decided that the only way I can carry on in life without wanting to kill myself is via confessing my sins and giving him all my fiat to trade with for me. It\u2019s better than in my hands. I am a literal psycho. I can\u2019t be trusted. I will see a fucking app notification and press some buttons like they\u2019re nothing and suddenly I\u2019ll lose all my savings.\n\nEnd of story. To all those that made money during that time. You\u2019re welcome.\n\n**TL;DR Lost 1k because some chinese mom unplugged some shit and I panicked and pressed some buttons on my phone.**",

        "selftext": "Earnings is in a 4 days.\n\nThere is alot of bullishness on their cashapp and also bearishness in their small business exposure.\n\nPersonally feel that they might not beat earnings\nEarnings concensus are already negative -0.05 eps compared to their previous quarter of -0.02 (Actual) and 0.13 (Expected)\n\nBut even if they were to fall short on earnings, the price might still go up due to percieved bullishness regarding the growth of cashapp\n\nHowever, i am net short on SQ because\n\n1. Around 55 percent of their revenue from Q1 was from transaction fees which comprises of at least 50  percent small business and many of which have closed/have decreased revenue or have went bankrupt.\n\n2. The faster growing side of their business is the subscribtion service it offers to businesses and cashapp users. For the sellers side (businesses). They have mostly waived the fees as mentioned in their Q1 earnings call. For cashapp, I am not entirely sure about this but I would think that most customers use the services without paying a single cent which really does not add much to the overall revenue. (influx of users due to the stimulus money probably use it for free, but they are technically still a new potential customer which is the aim of SQ)\n\n3. Every p2p transfer actually costs SQ money and i definitely see their profit margin dropping for cashapp.\n\n4. Their stock platform is subpar and not comparable to most brokers and their BTC platform has a minimal margin and its treated more as a gimmick.\n\nHaving said that i cannot deny the meteoric rise in users of the cashapp and this does easily create a network effect and switching cost (of time/convenience) and even if these free users do not result in revenue now, they might in the future.\n\nDo tell me if i missed anything. (most of these info are gathered from their Q1 earnings from their investors relations webpage under Q1 2020 \n[Investor relations](http://squareup.com/us/en/about/investors)squareup.com/us/en/about/investors\n\nI m net short but am not putting a large amount at risk due to a major bullish sentiment on cashapp and as seen in q1, even though they were short on earnings by a large amount, the price just shot up.",

(The options are just to expensive for me)  I give not one fuck about my losses this is a dip of a lifetime and I cannot understand why people are not talking about it. Morgan Stanley apparently feels the same way, saying that it's, \"just too \"compelling\" (they mean good) to pass up.\"  It's now listed as a 100% buy on RH and the volume is starting to pick up I think it bottomed out between $150 and $148.\n\n    Just a little info: it's  not JUST the building of MSGS it is a holding company that owns teams in multiple leagues across the NBA NHL WNBA CGL (gaming) and more.  I'm not a DD god but I cannot sit idle and let my boys and girls miss out on these sweet tendies. If you don't mind having some of your tendies tied up for for a while until this is all over this is the easiest 100%  in your life. \n\n    Can't. Go. Tits. Up.",

I purchased it at ,34 as I saw that lot of people were expecting ,60 and that it reached ,45 the previous day. But it dropped at ,3. So I decided to purchase more to Reduce my cost per action. My new average cost is now ,32 however the stock kept dropping and closed at 0,253.\nWhen I look at the average between the lowest value and highest value of the book of order for the opening on Monday I see that it is at 0,27, and that there is more buyer and seller (2:1). Given that it also dropped by 18%... I am also expecting that in the first hours of Monday it will bounce back to 0,27. Would you recommend me to cut cost at 0,27 (send an order now), wait Monday, see if it increase above 0,27 and try to get more out of it, or just sell half around 0,27 and still expect that it may increase higher and that my loss will be lower. :(\nFor info, The results of the company were not that bad (16 of July) but the stock increased only a few days after the announcement... so indeed if I did my due diligence I wouldn\u2019t have invested in it :(\nExpensive mistake :( hope you guys can guide me a bit with your experience.",

        "selftext": "If you're like me and were around for the first big $IDEX push in June, you'll know this mistress left a lot of bagholders in her wake. I'm determined not to let that happen to me.\n\nThat said, I do think there's money to be made, so how to do so? I've been trying to think of how $IDEX will play out in the coming days and here's what I've reasoned out. Interested in hearing what others think.\n\n## Observations from the Past\n$IDEX had a similar run-up before a 6/30 event in New York (https://ideanomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Ideanomics-June-Newsletter.pdf) and crashed from PM highs right as markets opened. It didn't stop from its $2.20-ish high until it reached $1.20s.\n\nWe've seen this kind of behavior before with other penny stocks, too. $NOVN's investor conference call that was hyped for last week didn't even begin that morning before the stock started plunging. Granted, the prospectus showed they were planning on voting on a R/S, but still, it was already tumbling in PM: https://imgur.com/a/BeiYSsd \n\n## [SNN Network Virtual Conference](https://conference.snn.network/)\n[PR for $IDEX's participation](https://www.yahoo.com/news/ideanomics-present-snn-network-virtual-150000244.html)\nNow, I know, one a pattern does not make, but my personal takeaway is that this is another one of those \"sell the news\" scenarios. Perhaps what $IDEX says/presents at the SNN conference Aug. 4 will be positive and the stock will rally based on that, but I'm not convinced $IDEX is even playing all that big of a role. [Nobody from the company is a keynote speaker](https://conference.snn.network/page-3741), so I'm guessing any presence will just be a side conference room where someone will speak to a half-empty room.\n\nI think that before we even get there, we'll see a heavy pullback that'll scare off many (perhaps, rightfully so). I'm guessing the pullback will be to a previous resistance line we've already encountered ($1.50 or even $1.45 from Friday) as investors pull out profits fearing the \"pump\" is done with and not wanting to hold bags (lots of emotional scars on this stock that are still fresh from June). If the conference is good, we might bump up to the next resistance line, but I just don't see us having the highs we encounter on Monday.\n\nThat said, so long as the conference isn't some sort of bomb, I'm thinking $IDEX won't fall all the way back down to its starting area of $1.25-1.30 because there's still anticipation for the earnings report on Aug. 11.\n\nNow, in the past, there's not much evidence that ER moves the stock. https://imgur.com/a/fdNQiEF\nBut, at least it doesn't flatline. So if anything, whatever price it's at after the conference fallout, I'm thinking it'll stay around that level at least up until earnings. After that, I expect it to start moving down during the day before the market closes and the ER is released that afternoon. If earnings are amazing, maybe it\u2019ll go back up. But otherwise, the \"pump\" (not really a pump, just our collective anticipation of price action) is over and the stock will start to bleed out again to whatever its ending support level ends up at.\n\nTLDR;\nHow will $IDEX move in the coming 2 weeks? I think:\n\n* 8/3: Up to highest point. Sell off late 8/3, maybe in AH or even as late as 8/4 PM. My plan is to exit 8/3.\n* 8/4: Unless conference is amazing news, will level off at a previous support seen on 8/3 or 8/2 (8/2 saw $1.45 as stable)\n* 8/5-8/10: Stable, maybe some slow rising in anticipation of ER. My plan is to get back on board with a much smaller stake early in this period.\n* 8/11: highest it'll get before ER after markets close. Likely sell off 8/11 midday. If ER is amazing, stock will rally after dropping. If so-so, drop will finish and now slow bleed to a previous resistance (but above that initial $1.25-$1.30 resistance) \u2013 maybe $1.40 or $1.50? If ER is horrible, quicker bleed back to below even the $1.30 resistance. My plan is to exit early or mid 8/11, depending on how things are going. Stop loss if I need to.\n\nJust my opinions based on past performance/my experience with penny stocks thus far. Don't use this as investment advice. Wanting to get all of your feedback on this and where I might be getting it wrong. See if those of us who are interested in playing $IDEX can group-think our way into a successful plan.\n\nThanks for reading!",

Former vice president Joe Biden is also expected to name his running mate in the coming week.\n*****\n&gt; The jobs data will be crucial, particularly since the number of people filing for unemployment benefits has been edging higher, instead of falling back, as expected. According to Refinitiv, about 1.36 million new jobs are expected, well below the 4.8 million added in June, and the unemployment rate is expected to fall to 10.7% from 11.1%.\n*****\n&gt; Trading around the report could be volatile, since some economists expect more than 2 million jobs were added, and some even see flat or negative payrolls.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks have done well for the month of July, with the S&amp;P 500 finishing at 3,271, a gain of 5.5%. The Nasdaq has performed the best, rising 6.8% for the month to 10,745, after a 3.7% gain for the past week.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cAugust has traditionally been a challenging month for investors,\u201d said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA. The market is entering what historically has been the worst two months for stocks.\n*****\n&gt; According to Stovall, the S&amp;P 500 has been higher in August 53% of the time, and its average move is a gain of just 0.01%, going back to World War II. September is worse, down 0.51% on average, and up just 48% of the time.\n*****\n&gt; In presidential election years, however the odds for August gains are better, as it rose 63% of the time and 73%, when the incumbent is up for re-election.\n*****\n&gt; There are also about 120 S&amp;P 500 companies reporting earnings, but the big earnings show for markets was this past week when four of the five biggest tech giants all reported Thursday afternoon. Three of those stocks \u2014 Apple, Amazon and Facebook \u2014 surged, helping Nasdaq outperform Friday with a more than 1.5% gain.\n*****\n&gt; # Earnings scorecard\n&gt; \u201cWe\u2019re only a month into the reporting period, and things are going to become less and less important from an earnings perspective,\u201d said Stovall. \u201cI think investors are sort of disappointed in that the bar was set so low for second quarter earnings that expectations were that we were going to see a lot of companies beat, which we have. But we were also going to see a gradual uplift of earnings expectations for forward quarters. We\u2019re not seeing that.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Eighty-two percent of the companies reporting so far have beaten estimates, well above the average 65%, according to Refinitiv. The earnings decline is now looking closer to 33% from an initial 40%, and tech, which has been leading the market is one of the best performers. Profits for the sector now look to be up 1.4%, according to I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv.\n*****\n&gt; Because the tech names have contributed so much to market gains, their earnings were an important test for the market, and they didn\u2019t disappoint. But they didn\u2019t manage to pull up the whole market very far on Friday.\n*****\n&gt; Among the names reporting in the coming week are a diverse group, including Disney, ViacomCBS, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Berkshire Hathaway, AIG, Clorox, and Wayfair, to name a few.\n*****\n&gt; # Politics now in play\n&gt; \u201cThe earnings story is over. My call had been once we had gotten through the earnings season, we would be more vulnerable to a sustainable pullback,\u201d said Barry Knapp, Ironside Macroeconomics managing partner and director of research. \u201cObviously, it\u2019s volatility season, but it\u2019s also an election year. ... We\u2019re more vulnerable to that next week and earnings won\u2019t hold us up.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Knapp said if President Donald Trump and Republicans do not begin to perform better in the polls by Labor Day, the market is likely to focus on what a Democratic win would mean for taxes and regulation. That could be a negative for stocks.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIf he hasn\u2019t made headway by then, it\u2019s likely he\u2019s done.That\u2019s about the point when things become pretty set in stone. The market will presume that\u2019s the case,\u201d Knapp said.\n*****\n&gt; The politics of the stimulus package could also reverberate through markets, until it looks like the Senate Republicans and House Democrats can find common ground.\n*****\n&gt; The two sides look to be at a standoff, but an agreement is still expected in early August. The market is particularly watching to see what happens with the enhanced unemployment benefits. Republicans have proposed cutting it to $200, but Democrats support keeping it.\n*****\n&gt; # The economy\n&gt; Cutting the size of the payments back might be good for the labor market and persuade more workers to return to work, some strategists say. However, there is also concern that the funding has helped stimulate the economy and keep the unemployed from defaulting on loans and payments. Consumer spending on goods in June was even higher than last year, and that was also seen as getting a lift from stimulus.\n*****\n&gt; Besides the jobs report, there are other important data like ISM manufacturing on Monday. There are also monthly vehicle sales Monday, and ISM nonmanufacturing data Wednesday.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think the macro data is going to be fine next week,\u201d said Knapp. \u201cI\u2019m not in the camp that thinks the payroll number is going to be negative.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; NatWest Markets economist Kevin Cummins is one of the economists who expects the jobs gains to be much smaller than the past two months. He expects the payrolls to come in at just 200,000. \u201cYou look at jobless claims, and you see a stalling out,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Fed is right. There is significant downside risk to the economy.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # A trade to watch\n&gt; Treasury yields, in the 2-year to 7-year range, fell to new lows in the past week. The 10-year yield, not yet at a record low, was also falling and was at 0.53% Friday. At the same time, the dollar was down more than 1% on the week and 4% for the month.\n*****\n&gt; Gold was a beneficiary of the lower interest rates, weaker dollar trade, rising about 5% for the week and 10% for the month.\n*****\n&gt; Strategist say investors are reacting to super-low interest rates, concerns about the economy, and the possibility that huge government spending will send inflation higher.\n*****\n&gt; Investors are also jumping into inflation-protected bonds. According to Refinitiv\u2019s Lipper, inflation-protected bond funds took in $271 million of net new money for the fund-flows week ended July 29, the sixth week of gains. About $1 billion went into the SPDR Gold Shares ETF, (GLD) in the last week, Lipper said.\n*****\n&gt; During this time period, the Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities funds recorded their two best weekly net inflows ever with increases of $1.9 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively, for the fund-flows weeks of June 24 and July 1.\n*****\n&gt; Lipper said investors started to put money into TIPS funds in the middle of the second quarter, and the flows have been . net positive in 11 out of 13 weeks since the beginning of May. This its second-worst quarterly net outflows ever as oil prices slumped in the first quarter.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think this is going to be a much more inflationary decade. It will start out slowly. [Fed Chairman Jerome] Powell is right that more forces are putting downward pressure on inflation at present. But the market looks past that,\u201d said Knapp. \u201cThe big story in 2021 will be the recovery of inflation. You\u2019re already seeing it in import prices.\u201d\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/Vu3udbe.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/h0BBbe1.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/LKORgeK.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.postimg.cc/MZnSQFC8/econcal1.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/LhH7odo.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/p9QIWyG.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/HmN0IBf.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/ZlnNJZU.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/wvkv3FfP/er83720.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/vu4Bq8q.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/kKZeaRL.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/O6zeqaG.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/SkGddqX.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/5XLqRrO.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #5!](https://i.imgur.com/zl5gQpo.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # August: Top NASDAQ &amp; Russell 2000 Month of Election Years\n\n&gt; August is amongst the worst months of the year. It is the worst DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ, Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 month over the last 32 years, 1988-2019 with average declines ranging from 0.1% by NASDAQ to 1.1% by DJIA.\n\n&gt; Contributing to this poor performance since 1987; the second shortest bear market in history (45 days) caused by turmoil in Russia, the Asian currency crisis and the Long-Term Capital Management hedge fund debacle ending August 31, 1998 with the DJIA shedding 6.4% that day. DJIA dropped a record 1344.22 points for the month, off 15.1%\u2014which is the second worst monthly percentage DJIA loss since 1950. Saddam Hussein triggered a 10.0% slide in August 1990. The best DJIA gains occurred in 1982 (11.5%) and 1984 (9.8%) as bear markets ended. Sizeable losses in 2010, 2011, 2013 and 2015 of over 4% on DJIA have widened Augusts\u2019 average decline.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/e8afe7e1e8656f8b9beeaf3291cf8f62/02ca1964ef3531ea-f0/s400x600/77f035157f33a261b7608dc9cc36fc09a768f385.jpg))**\n\n&gt; However, in election years since 1950, Augusts\u2019 rankings improve: #6 DJIA, #5 S&amp;P 500, #1 NASDAQ (since 1971), #1 Russell 1000 and #1 Russell 2000 (since 1979). This year, the market\u2019s performance in August will likely depend heavily on how July closes and whether or not the rate of covid-19 infection continues to accelerate which could force some areas to roll back reopenings.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # August\u2019s First Trading Day Bearish Last 23 Years\n\n&gt; From the Stock Trader\u2019s Almanac 2020 (page 88), it is known that the first trading days of each month combined gain nearly as much as all other days combined. However, the first trading day of August does not contribute to this phenomenon ranking worst among other First Trading Days in the 2020 Almanac. In the past 23 years DJIA has risen just 30.4% (up 7, down 16) of the time on the first trading day of August. Average and median losses are on the mild side due to a few sizable advances. Over the past nine years, DJIA and S&amp;P 500 have both declined nine times.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/8f6234b8e365d9e861563b4d5b2efa5d/42d5f6b50757b324-8c/s500x750/6269fe4480533724c565c9852bf543a4c59ea172.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # S&amp;P 500 Stronger Underneath the Surface\n\n&gt; Earlier today we posted a chart showing S&amp;P 500 sector performance since the Nasdaq's recent peak on 7/20 when Technology stocks began what has now been a 10-day period of consolidation. Below we have updated these performance numbers to include today's moves. While not as many sectors remain in positive territory, the majority of sectors continue to outperform the S&amp;P 500, while Technology drags the market lower. Along with Technology, Communication Services, and Consumer Discretionary are the only other sectors that have lagged the S&amp;P 500, and their performance has been dragged down by the mega-cap tech-like stocks of Alphabet (GOOGL), Facebook (FB), and Amazon (AMZN).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/07/073020-Sector-Performance.png))**\n\n&gt; Expanding on this theme of underlying strength in the index, the chart below shows the average performance of stocks in the S&amp;P 500 grouped by sector. On an equal-weighted basis, the S&amp;P 500 is actually up 1.3% since 7/20, and only two sectors (Technology and Materials) have seen negative average returns. On the upside, Real Estate (4.1%) has been the big winner followed by Consumer Discretionary (3.3%), and Consumer Staples (2.2%). The fact that Consumer Discretionary at the cap-weighted sector level is down over 1.4% while the average performance of stocks in the sector has been a gain of 3.3% illustrates what a mammoth impact AMZN has on that sector.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/07/073020-Sector-Performance-Avg.png))**\n\n&gt; Breadth among S&amp;P 500 stocks has also been overwhelmingly positive. For the S&amp;P 500 as a whole, 59% of stocks in the index have had positive returns since the close on 7/20. Only two sectors (Technology and Materials) have seen fewer than half of their components post positive returns over that time, while Real Estate, Consumer Staples, and Utilities have seen roughly three-quarters of their components rally since 7/20.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/07/073020-Sector-Performance-Percent-Up1.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Bullish Earnings Season So Far\n\n&gt; At our Earnings Explorer tool available to clients on our website, we provide a real-time look at beat rates for both EPS and sales. Below is a snapshot from the website showing both the EPS and sales beat rates for US companies reporting earnings on a rolling 3-month basis. Currently, 64.61% of companies have exceeded consensus analyst EPS estimates over the last three months, while 63.75% of companies have beaten consensus sales estimates over the same time frame.\n\n&gt; In looking at the chart, you can see a big spike in the EPS beat rate over the last few weeks. Since earnings season began on July 13th, nearly 80% of companies have posted stronger than expected EPS numbers. That's a huge beat rate and suggests that analysts were too bearish on Q2 numbers heading into July. The revenue beat rate held up much better than EPS beats throughout the first half of 2020, but it too is on the upswing this season.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/07/epssales.png))**\n\n&gt; We also monitor how share prices are reacting to earnings reports. So far this earnings season, the average stock that has reported Q2 numbers has gained 1.31% on its earnings reaction day. That compares to a historical average one-day change of just 0.06% on earnings reaction days. As shown below, stocks that have beaten EPS estimates this season have gained 2.2% on earnings reaction days, while companies that have missed EPS estimates have fallen 1.89%. It's rare to see beats gaining more than misses decline, but that's what is happening this season.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/07/eps.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # China Running Away YTD\n\n&gt; Every Wednesday, we publish our Global Macro Dashboard which provides a high-level summary of market and economic data of some of the world's largest economies. Of the 23 stock markets tracked, just six including the US are positive year to date at the moment (in local currency). In the chart below we show the YTD performance of these six countries as well as the global median in 2020. As shown, even though it was actually the first to tip into the green YTD following the global sell-off in February and March very briefly back in early June, the US is up the least of this group with a YTD gain of 0.4%. China's stock market is up the most at +14%. Taiwan, South Korea, South Africa, and Malaysia are also outperforming the US but are up more modestly than China with the best of these, Taiwan, gaining 4.53% this year. Meanwhile, the median country in our Global Macro Dashboard remains down 6.2% YTD.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/07/072920-GMD-ytd.png))**\n\n&gt; Given it is up the most on a year to date basis, China has also gained the largest share of global equity market cap in 2020. As shown in the table below, China has gained 1.7 percentage points of global market cap in 2020 and now takes up 10.14%. China now joins the US as the only other country with a double-digit share of total world market cap. Despite this, China has actually lost share since the bear market lows on 3/23. Meanwhile, the US, Germany, Canada, India, South Korea, and Australia have all gained a significant share since 3/23.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/07/072920-Mkt-Cap-World.png))**\n\n&gt; # Do the Top 5 Stocks Pose a Risk to the Market?\n\n&gt; Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Google, and Facebook. These five stocks have helped spawn a number of acronyms as they try to capture the rise of mega-cap tech stocks that have led the market higher for much of the past decade. The average return for those five stocks so far this year has been a gain of more than 30%, while the broad S&amp;P 500 Index is just marginally positive, at 0.4% through July 30.\n\n&gt; While many other areas of the market have remained largely static, the total market value of these stocks has dramatically increased, making them an increasingly large piece of market cap-weighted indexes such as the S&amp;P 500. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the combined weight of the top five stocks in the S&amp;P 500 has increased to its highest level ever, at nearly 22%. Only one of those five stocks (Microsoft) was a top five name in the index during the previous peak of March 2000.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/7.31.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; But does this pose a risk to the index? From a diversification standpoint, one could certainly argue it does. For instance, if any shared risks should come up, from regulation, for example, it could do outsized damage to cap-weighted indexes. However, we believe that the recent gains have been justified by the fundamentals, and we continue to favor both large caps over small caps, and growth-style stocks over value stocks. According to analysis from Credit Suisse, over the past 12 months, the top five stocks in the index have grown revenues at 11.2% vs. just 0.8% for the rest of the S&amp;P 500. Further, the remainder of the S&amp;P 500 has subtracted roughly $17 from S&amp;P 500 earnings per share (EPS), while the top five stocks have added more than $12.\n\n&gt; Finally, while these stocks have been the face of the recent \u201cstay-at-home trend\u201d and may be more insulated from broader economic weakness, they are far from the only stocks making money this year. On July 30, the Philadelphia Stock Exchange Semiconductor Index hit a new all-time high and is now up more than 15% year-to-date.\n\n&gt; \u201cAfter a huge run, many of these top stocks may be due for a pause,\u201d said LPL Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cHowever, looking out over the next 6 to 12 months, we believe that investors will continue to place a premium on companies that are able to organically grow sales, especially in a low-growth environment.\u201d\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt;

The stock rose a bit over $114 that day, so i decided (stupidly) to double down and buy 8/14 $114 put also. \n\nThe next day, the stock closed at over $121 and has been rising ever since.

I currently have that many shares on a sell order for when it hits $10 but sometimes I feel like just dumping it altogether and moving the money on to something more useful to invest in.\n\n\n**AAL (4.3%)**\n\nI got this near one of its lows close to $13. This was more or less of a gamble since I saw that there was some room for medium term gains as long as they don\u2019t bk. I work in the industry and have a strong sense of its direction so I\u2019ll keep this for now until I sense things going a different direction (I don\u2019t work for AAL in any capacity)\n\n**BOXL (3.2%)**\n\nThis is just a Covid gamble. I feel dumb for getting sucked into it but it\u2019s only a little bit of money lost if it never goes anywhere.\n\n**NET (14.7%)**\n\nJust a company I\u2019ve know for a long time. There\u2019s a lot of emotion behind this one, but its objective metrics are strong anyway so I plan on continuing to find my position on this one if things continue going well.\n\n**KO (29.7%)**\n\nI first bought into Coke in 2018 as a long-term value sink and its ability to retain value while growing at a rate better than a HYSA has been just fine with me. I plan to continue adding to this.\n\n\n**TXN (32.9%)**\n\nA company with a strong history and strong fundamentals. One of my recent additions as a long-term value sink. I plan to continue adding to this.\n\n**VNQ (4.2%)**\n\nVery recently bought into this. I want to be exposed to the real estate market as well med-long term without buying an actual building so I figured a respected real estate etf made sense. I\u2019m wondering if going for a muni bond based etf would make more sense though. This is my \u201cnon-stock\u201d holdings that should take priority as I get older. \n\n\nRecent Specs:\n\nI've only specced on a couple of things so far, but so far so good. I've made roughly 20% in YTD gain yield off of some small working buying and selling SPCE and WFC.",

        "selftext": "I started investing in March. For some reason I looked at stocks and saw everything plummeting and I remember saying: Man, I cant wait for another crash (referring to 2008). It will be my time to make some money. So I bought a bunch of stocks at relatively low prices. Here's where the lessons begins...\n\nUnfortunately, I didnt have enough money to invest - especially for the kinds of returns I was looking for.\n\n Lesson #1: You will never have enough money.\n\nOnce the market started to recover, and actually getting higher than Pre Covid (in a lot of stocks I was investing), instead of selling and taking profits, I told myself: It'll continue rising! Shortly after that, market stabilized a bit and now those profits shrank to about 1/3 of what they were.\n\nLesson #2: Don't get greedy. Take your profits. Some profit is better than no profit!\n\nSince I was dumb and thought my strategy worked (which in reality there was no strategy, I just bought really low on some stocks that were bound to go up), I decided to try Penny stocks! I now hold bags due to hype. GNUS, XSPA, etc. The best part? I was actively looking at the market when these stocks hit their peak. I decided to hold because they would go higher. This reminds me back in 2017 when Bitcoin skyrocketed to 20k. I had about 18k in profit. But I said with confidence....itll go even higher and I'll have enough to pay off my student loans! That didn't happen. Within a few days I went from +18k to -$500. (I hadn't invested that much so It didnt hurt to lose  $500).\n\nLesson #3: Have a strategy! Once it hits a certain price, sell! Or sell some, and once it continues going up, sell some more. Trailing Stop Loss (I think thats the name of it, Im still learning all of this!) - In other words, dont get married to a Pennystock lol - ALSO! know when to stop your losses\n\nThe moral of the story is that you gotta have a plan. You cant just do without thinking and expect great returns. And its okay to make these dumbass mistakes I've made. I know for a fact I am not the only one. As a human being with a brain, it is your responsibility to understand that you dont know what you dont know and educate your damn self so that you learn from those mistakes and start taking some profit. \n\nWhy do I say I haven't fully learned it yet? Because I am a damn idiot and fuck up a lot. But thats how I learn. I know a lot more now than I did before. Everywhere I look I see people saying that new traders lose money. My self fulfilling prophecy says: \"Thats because they are not me\" the reality is, its because I just dont know any better, and until I can consistently and strategically invest and profit from it, I cant say that I have learned my lesson.",

I'm really excited to invest on APPL:US, because of the split share from 4 to 1 at the end of August. I'm thinking to buy 10 shares.\n\nI see a few posts here on reddit that it would be taxed by 15% on the dividends if you put in a TFSA accounts. \n\nAs in 2020, August, 01: Before split-share\n\nhttps://web.tmxmoney.com/quote.php?qm_symbol=AAPL:US\n\nThe dividends right now for the APPL:US is 0.82 USD and I brought 10 shares. I earned 8.20 USD per quarterly on the dividends. It is taxed by 15% in a TFSA account and I made about 6.97 USD. With the conversion rate, I made 9.35 CAD. &lt;-- Am I correct?\n\n(Post-split) \n\nIf I buy one share of APPL:US $100 on September 1st. It got magically increased to $500 after 3 months. I made $400 USD and I decide to sell. The $400 USD I earned, after selling, is also being taxed by 15%?\n\nI was clear about the dividends being taxed, but I don't know if I being taxed if I decide to sell one share after the increase price.\n\nYes, I know....

I think interest in the thread dried up so the question went unanswered - reposting here to get your thoughts/criticism of my line of reasoning.\n\n\nI\u2019m going to put myself out there and ask a stupid question about human behavior during this upcoming Apple split. Be kind.\n\nI get that nothing effectively changes when this stock splits on Aug 24. Someone who owns 100 shares will then own 400 and $40k is $40k regardless if they own 100 shares at $400 or 400 shares at $100.\n\nThat aside - isn\u2019t the (likely upward) volatility going to be incredibly higher for Apple at $100 than if the stock didn\u2019t split and floated around $400? Isn\u2019t Apple such a rock star stock that retail investors are going to flood into it when they can buy at $100? And thus wouldn\u2019t larger investors be interested in buying at pre-split valuations on the assumption that there will be an increase in volatility after the split?\n\nOf course I understand that fractional shares are already popular right now. However seems like retail investors will react differently to the option to own full shares rather than fractional, and that my speculative \u201crush\u201d will be a benefit for larger institutional investors. I know this is just an assumption that the market will respond this way - but in I can\u2019t see how current shareholders won\u2019t drastically benefit from the volatility around this news. None of which would happen if the stock didn\u2019t split.\n\nAm I totally off base here?",

It could be a single fingerprint, all 10 fingerprints, a facial scan, or a combination of them all.In Electronic Identification (eID) instances, where fingerprint enrollment is a requirement, significant opportunity exists for biometric sensor cards to merge public and private sector services, offering a platform from which a government can distribute social welfare, using the biometric sensor as proof of life to help mitigate against any associated fraud.\nThis is particularly relevant in emerging regions where social warfare fraud puts a significant strain on welfare fund\n\n#The overall access control market is expected to grow from USD 7.5 billion in 2018 to USD 12.1 billion by 2024, at a CAGR of 8.24% from 2018 to 2024\nAccess control is another significant opportunity, notably in physical access control scenarios.

I take Mondays and Tuesdays slow to build green day momentum then go harder Wed-Fri. As of now my average position size is around $1,500 \n\n![video](3bmpkuovbee51)",

Got a job as a Phlebotomist and made around $12-$14 an hour from say age 28-33 and continued to contribute around 5%\n3. After about 7 years of this at age 33 my balance was maybe around $20,000 or so (kind of disappointing)\n4. Age 34 graduated college and got first real job as a medical technologist making $24.50 an hour and bumped 403b up to 10%\n5. Age 37 making about $27 an hour as Medical Technologist and bumped it up to 15% contribution limit.\n6. final around age 39 making $29 an hour and 15% contribution I finally hit the $100,000 mark in my 403b account. It took me a good 12-13 years of saving.\n7. I am now age 41 and first year I moved to San Diego and am going to earn low six figures this year. I have bumped 403b up to max $19,000 per year. \n8. My liquid assets are now at $267,000.\n\nI am shocked at how fast the ball gets rolling once you hit that first $100,000 balance in your 401k/403b. I took forever to reach that milestone but once i got there I probably made most of the second 100K in about 2 years compounding interest and the fact that I think it sets something off inside of you where you see that on a good market day your money can make you more in one great stock market day then you earn at your 9-5 job in a 2 week pay period. I could only imagine how fast wealth starts to snowball once you reach $1,000,000 and a good 2019 stock market year could add $250,000 to your portfolio. (more then most middle class workers earn in 5 years of work) \n\nMy 2 questions for this post are did anyone else notice that once you hit $100K liquid assets it seems like its kind of the sweet spot where your wealth snowball really starts rolling.\n\nSecondly, why do so many people who focus so hard on earning money at their job, totally ignore saving and investing where undeniably once you reach a certain point your money will begin to go to work everyday, earning as much as a Physician, and start earning you a second six figure income passively.\n\nIts almost as if the number one secret to financial life is to get to 100K then 1,000,000 as quick as humanly possible and then coast the rest of your life one easy mode.",

        "selftext": "Well, I've officially made my first, second, and third million from PRPL (I called it [right here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gs7mjl/prpl_more_dd_for_you_autists/) two months ago).   My net liquidity in PRPL as of Friday close is $2,622,131,72.   That, along with the $380k I've taken out, I'm at just over $3M.   At this point, when you take into account all the stupid moves I made when I first found this sub, I'm now playing with house money.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Has PRPL Memed Yet?\n\nNo.   It hasn't.   Not yet.   \n\nI'm kind of getting tired of answering this in PMs, so please don't ask me if it is too late to invest.   This hasn't memed and I believe we will be in the $25-27 range easily after earnings just by fundamentals alone (assuming the previous low visibility on the stock).   As visibility increases, I think the valuation multiple increases, and not past fundamentals.   We will see higher if this becomes a no longer under-the-radar stock.\n\nThis isn't a meme yet, and it is no where close.\n\nHow do we know?   Let's look at the ultimate source of truth on the subject:  [Robintrack](https://robintrack.net/symbol/PRPL).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lzr2qdg4kne51.png?width=1889&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=46997d3050986a77c318c7c9e17ceb39cf8b7f91\n\nAs you can see, we've seen a significant influx of Robinhood tards in the last few days, but this isn't memeing, yet.\n\nIf you check the [Robintrack popularity changes](https://robintrack.net/popularity_changes?hoursAgo=168) over the last week, PRPL comes in at #113 most popular in terms of user growth.    That isn't very high at all.   It's surrounded by other stocks you've never heard of.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j2376iielne51.png?width=576&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1ea7b7afb1b7de17dd2f36d4bde3f5f17c0ebf5d\n\nThis is hardly meme worthy yet.   Compare this to KODK:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u62x1fgdmne51.png?width=585&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=83b16c21e2b56c23818b6a48c97ee0410c12047a\n\nWe should also compare PRPL to two recents meme stocks:  SPCE and DKNG.   As a side note, all three of these stocks came from SPACs BTW, hence the warrants.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ne6lwwnvpne51.png?width=1892&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e97dba747dc51ec779ef8a8a5640f72257313798\n\nSPCE shot up to about 92,000 Robintards very quickly, which drove the price up.   When the rate of Robintard increases declined and flattened out, the stock dropped.   There are now 150k Robintards holding.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0xndxysxpne51.png?width=1890&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c4db5e52718775e5b30ffe74d59784f34395600c\n\nDKNG shot up to about 100,000 Robintards investing on the meme run up, and still has about 120k still in.  The meme drop off is less pronounced on DKNG because, unlike SPCE, they have this thing called \"Revenue\".\n\nKODK, SPCE, and DKNG all had run ups to about 100k Robintards driving the meme up in price way over fundamentals.   PRPL only has 6,600 Robintards, and the current price is fully supported by fundamentals (see some of my previous posts and u/dhsmatt2's previous posts if you want support on that statement).\n\nSo, no, it isn't a meme.   Keep tabs on this though as Robintard entry could definitely cause this to meme up (and we may very well be in the early stages of this right now).   Buy calls now and sell when we start getting close to 100k Robintards.\n\n# Financial Analysis\n\nI think u/dhsmatt2 did a pretty good job [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/i0zaqh/prpl_nurples_why_purple_valuation_just_might_make/?sort=new).   My only two comments are:  1)  I think his revenue estimate is low (mine:  $244m, his $225M), and 2)  the warrant liability accrual won't be recurring at the same level (we will see one big bang this quarter and then a wimper going forward until the warrants are gone--so his forward EPS estimate should be higher on his math).\n\nMy revenue estimates:\n\n||Q2 Total|June|May|April|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Direct-to-Consumer (DTC)|*205.0*|*80.0*|**71.0**|**54.0**|\n|Wholesale Partner|*39.0*|*19.0*|**17.3**|*2.7*|\n||||||\n|Total|*244.0 M*|*99.0*|**88.3**|*56.7*|\n\nThe bold numbers are known for sure as they were disclosed.   The italicized are my estimates.\n\nI'm putting June DTC as an acceleration over May because of the following:\n\n1. The website still showed significant delays in delivery, which means they were still selling every mattress they make.\n2. Extra manufacturing capacity came online at the beginning of June.\n3. Purple discontinued its lower end models, which would cause a mix shift up in revenue per unit when selling at capacity.\n\nI may be underestimating this as well.\n\nI placed wholesale where it was at because it is still recovering and Joe Megibow [said in this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uP8ggnn9nK8&amp;feature=youtu.be) that they were almost flat of wholesale year over year at this point.\n\n# Valuations\n\nI'm copying this [from a previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hig038/i_bought_six_prpl_mattresses_today_you_should_buy/), even though the data is slightly dated now after TPX and SNBR had their releases.\n\n**Enterprice Value / Revenue**\n\n|Ticker|As of 6/28/20|2020 Q1|2019 Q4|2019 Q3|2019 Q2|2019 Q1|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|PRPL|2.01|2.52|3.94|3.61|3.73|3.09|\n|TPX|1.71|4.84|7.39|7.34|8.07|6.88|\n|SNBR|0.98|2.36|4.40|3.79|4.97|3.78|\n|CSPR|0.53|0.91|||||\n\nBased upon the chart, I don't see a 2x multiple on revenue as unreasonable at all for PRPL, and arguably, it should be higher due to the acceleration in growth rate.\n\nThe Q2 revenue pattern will continue into Q3 and beyond (they are still backed up on delivery on several products).   Additionally, they will be bringing substantial capacity online in the next year to support sales.   I see PRPL producing $800M-$1,200M in revenue over the next year as we see continued capacity growth, shift into higher end mattresses, and continued expansion on both DTC and wholesale doors.\n\nClearly, it is easy to justify the $1.32B valuation as of close Friday, and arguably, much higher.\n\n# Positions\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kza0j31utne51.png?width=1242&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dcb053f5300205be309cdf19b4fbc23a7a6df276\n\nA bunch of warrants and call debit spreads.  \n\n# Recommendations\n\nI don't have any recommendations.   Go talk to your investment advisor as this isn't investment advice.   What am I looking at right now?   Debit spreads.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6hv4gez1une51.png?width=1242&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b8bdb7c9ecd0ae6730e95732434687b2ecc56a11\n\nIf you took the ask, you can pick up a 20/22.5c debit spread for only $1.70.   It pays out $2.50 as long as the stock stays above $22.50 after earnings (likelihood is extremely high as the stock is currently at $24.37).\n\nFor those of you who are asking what to do or wondering if it is too late to make money:   that is an example conservative position to take even if you think the stock will be flat from here on out till earnings (it won't be).\n\nMy bet is that it continues to grow each day on a run up.   I'll be watching Robintrack very closely on the run up.    My plan is to hold through earnings, unless we meme up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# PRPL GANG FTW!!!",

It may need to do another one pretty soon if its shares keep surging.Tesla\u00a0([TSLA](https://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=TSLA&amp;source=story_quote_link))\u00a0has skyrocketed 50% since announcing the stock split on August 11.

That will\u00a0[cut the price](http://www.cnn.com/2020/08/11/cars/tesla-stock-split/index.html)\u00a0by a fifth, to almost $420 a share. The market value of Tesla, now hovering around $390 billion, will remain the same.But does Tesla deserve to trade at such a high valuation?

Of the 33 that officially track the stock, only eight have a buy rating on Tesla while 15 have it rated a hold and 10 are recommending a sell on it.Only three of the Tesla analysts currently have a price target for it above $2,000.

        "selftext": "That's right, your monthly update on the sector that the majority of people seem to hate and has a total market cap almost equal to that of Pinterest. Yes, even I was suprised about this. A sector that provides fuel for powering 20% of the entire US and around 10% of all power generation globally has a combined market cap equivalent to a website where you can look for pictures of furniture (extremely simplified but you get the point).\n\nBut I digress, for those of you who have not read my previous updates and DD, [here](https://amp.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/hp9966/the_case_for_a_big_uranium_bull_market_and_what/) is a general market analysis and five stock suggestions, [here](https://amp.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/huo47l/uranium_miners_are_showing_big_growth_with_many/) is a market update and lastly [here](https://amp.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/i2bf4d/the_sector_that_returned_20x_50x_100x_and_even/) another update explaining the bullish views and recent drop. I would highly suggest you read these first before asking questions, since they will probably answer most questions you may have in the post itself or between the hundreds of comments. If you do have more questions, I will be more than happy to answer them for you.\n\nNow, let's move on to the big one, what is happening in the sector? Well it looks like 2021 is going to be the year all catalysts come together to form one incredible bull market for uranium. \n\nKazatomprom has publicly announced that their supply in 2021 will be severely impacted. Why is that? Because ISR mining in Kazakhstan is a lot like planting crops. A mining solution has to be put into the ground, which will go into the ore bodies and after between 4 and 7 months the solution can be pumped back out together with the uranium ore. The only problem is that the main 'seeding' months where between April and September, right before Kazakhstan winter. They have now missed their main mining time of the year, which means little to no new uranium will be pulled out of the ground next year for the first time in a long long time. With Kazakhstan responsible for just around 40% of the entire global supply of uranium, this impact will translate into a major supply deficit on top of the already existing supply deficit. This year it is estimated that there will be around 120 million pounds of uranium produced, where 180 million pounds was demanded. This means that inventory and mobile supply had to be used to fill this gap, further tightening the global supply of uranium. Let's talk about the wildest situation, which would be every single uranium producer, including at Olympic Dam, just ramps up to full capacity and sell everything into the market at whatever the current price is. Will that drop the price a bit? Sure it will. Will it take care of the deficit and prevent this bull market from happening? Absolutely not.\n\nIf this structural deficit happened to any other commodity, the price would absolutely skyrocket. So why hasn't uranium? Because there has been almost no talk of nuclear utilities, the main consumer of uranium, coming into the market to buy new fuel. This will change in 2021 and especially 2022 when 40% and 80% of all utilities in the US respectively will be out of contract and thus not getting their all important fuel for the nuclear power plants.\n\nThis contracting cycle comes at the same time as the biggest supply deficit we have yet seen, the closing of several high profile uranium mines, like Orano's Cominak mine, the lack of new uranium mines for at least the next 2/3 years and above all the increasing demand for uranium all across the globe make this entire sector a coiled spring. We do not know when it will go off, but the longer it stays this way the higher the jump and this jump will come. My guess is that there are several small bumps this year and that there will be a huge jump next year which will trigger a bull market that may even eclipse the likes of 2002-2007 and will last between 2-4 years depending on how long it takes for all utilities to sign new contracts and the market to be supplied well again, after which the market will come back down to 'normal levels'.\n\nLastly, there have been index funds who are restructuring their holdings to have more pure play exposure to uranium. $URA will move from 50% to 70%, adding 32 million dollars to the sector. With a sector that had such a small market cap, inflow of capital like this can move the needle substantially. Just imagine what will happen when the general investment community and all those people who made millions in the previous bull market decide to invest into the sector. That will do more than just moving the needle or spring the coil, that would put the needle and the coil into a cannon.\n\nAll signs point to this being the most asymmetrical risk/reward investment you can find in the market. I will not deny the risk it brings, but the potential rewards are so large that they easily write off any risk that might be involved investing in this sector. When all is set and done, those that invested early and held on through all the volatility will be greatly rewarded for their troubles.\n\nExtras:\nI highly suggest checking out people like Brandon Munro, the uranium insider, John Quackes, Crux Investor, Rob Chang and especially Mike Alkin who all have extensive information on the sector and the investment thesis.\n\nDisclaimer:\nUranium holds a 25% spot in my total portfolio, with significant positions in Cameco (CCO), Denison Mines (DNN) and Energy Fuels (UUUU).",

Any other date is wrong.  Robinhood is wrong (why are you using Robinhood still!?!).\n\nI'm going to take you through my earnings projections and reasoning as well the things to look for in the earnings release and the call that could make this moon even further.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Earnings Estimates\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/w3qad4gb9ng51.png?width=854&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7a88656a9867d0e40710736f61974a22b5f4a631\n\nI'm calling $244M Net Revenue with $39.75M in Net Income, which would be $0.75 Diluted EPS.  I'll walk you through how I got here\n\n# Total Net Revenue\n\nI make the assumption that Purple is still selling every mattress it can make (since that is what they said for April and May) and that this continued into June because the website was still delayed 7-14 days across all mattresses at the end of June.\n\n**May Revenue and April DTC:**  The numbers in purple were provided by Purple [here](https://investors.purple.com/press-releases/news-details/2020/Purple-Innovation-Reports-Record-First-Quarter-2020-Results/default.aspx) and [here](https://investors.purple.com/press-releases/news-details/2020/Purple-Innovation-Provides-Business-Update-Ahead-of-Participation-in-Oppenheimer-20th-Annual-Consumer-Growth-Conference/default.aspx).  \n\n**April Wholesale:**  My estimate of $2.7M for Wholesale sales in April comes from this statement from the Q1 earnings release:  \" *While wholesale sales were down 42.7% in April year-over-year, weekly wholesale orders have started to increase on a sequential basis.* \"  I divided Q2 2019's wholesale sales evenly between months and then went down 42.7%.\n\n**June DTC:**  This is my estimate based upon the fact that another Mattress Max machine went online June 1, thus increasing capacity, and the low end model was discontinued (raising revenue per unit).\n\n**June Wholesale:**  [Joe Megibow stated at Commerce Next](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uP8ggnn9nK8&amp;feature=emb_logo) on 7/30 that wholesale had returned to almost flat growth.  I'm going to assume he meant for the quarter, so I plugged the number here to finish out the quarter at $39.0M, just under $39.3M from a year ago.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Revenue Expectations from Analysts** ([via Yahoo](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/PRPL/analysis?p=PRPL))\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/notxd6hhbng51.png?width=384&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aa0453414f467aa6c5bf72ce8a8046c0ae6e62a5\n\nMy estimate of $244M comes in way over the high, let alone the consensus.   PRPL has effectively already disclosed \\~$145M for April/May, so these expectations are way off.  I'm more right than they are.\n\n# Gross Margins\n\nI used my estimates for Q3/Q4 2019 to guide margins in April/May as there were some one time events that occurred in Q1 depressing margins.   June has higher margin because of the shift away from the low end model (which is priced substantially lower than the high end model).   Higher priced models were given manufacturing priority.\n\n# Operating Expenses\n\n**Marketing and Sales**\n\nJoe mentioned in the [Commerce Next](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uP8ggnn9nK8&amp;feature=emb_logo) video that they were able to scale sales at a constant CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost).   There's three ways of interpreting this:\n\n1. Overall customer acquisition cost was constant with previous quarters (assume $36M total, not $93.2M), which means you need to add another $57M to bottom line profit and $1.08 to EPS, or\n2. Customer Acquisition Costs on a unit basis were constant, which means I'm still overstating total marketing expense and understating EPS massively, or\n3. Customer Acquisition Costs on a revenue basis were constant, which is the most conservative approach and the one I took for my estimate.\n\nI straightlined the 2.2 ratio of DTC sales to Marketing costs from Q1.   I am undoubtably too high in my expense estimate here as PRPL saw marketing efficiencies and favorable revenue shifts during the quarter.  So, $93.2M\n\n**General and Administrative**\n\nA Purple HR rep [posted on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6691037138018017280/) about hiring 330 people in the quarter.   I'm going to assume that was relative to the pre-COVID furloughs, so I had June at that proportional amount to previous employees and adjusted April and May for furloughs and returns from furlough.\n\n**Research and Development**\n\nI added just a little here and straight lined it.\n\n# Other Expenses\n\n**Interest Expense**\n\nStraightlined from previous quarters, although they may have tapped ABL lines and so forth, so this could be under.\n\n**One Time and Other**\n\nUnpredictable by nature.\n\n**Warrant Liability Accrual**\n\nI'm making some assumptions here.   \n\n1. We know that the secondary offering event during Q2 from the Pearce brothers triggered the clause for the loan warrants (NOT the PRPLW warrants) to lower the strike price to $0.\n2. I can't think of a logical reason why the warrant holders wouldn't exercise at this point.\n3. Therefore there is no longer a warrant liability where the company may need to repurchase warrants back.\n4. The liability accrual of $7.989M needs to be reversed out for a gain.\n\nThis sucker is worth about $0.15 EPS on its own.\n\n# Earnings (EPS)\n\nI project $39.75M or $0.75 Diluted EPS (53M shares).  How does this hold up to the analysts?\n\n**EPS Expectations from Analysts** ([via Yahoo](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/PRPL/analysis?p=PRPL))\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/o2i1dvk6hng51.png?width=373&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=27e63f7934d85393e1f7b87bf2e2066c28047202\n\n**EPS Expectations from Analysts** ([via MarketBeat](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/PRPL/earnings/))\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/psu5rajfhng51.png?width=1359&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0612d43777c644789b14f8c5decbe36f41925f5e\n\nThese losers are way under.   Now you know why I am so optimistic about earnings.\n\nKeep in mind, these analysts are still giving $28-$30 price targets.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# What to Watch For During Earnings (aka Reasons Why This Moons More)\n\nAnalysts, Institutionals, and everyone else who uses math for investing is going to be listening for the following:\n\n* Margin Growth\n* Warrant Liability Accrual\n* Capacity Expansion Rate\n* CACs (Customer Acquisition Costs)\n* New Product Categories\n* Cashless Exercise of PRPLW warrants\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Margin Growth**\n\nThis factor is HUGE.  If PRPL guides to higher margins due to better sales mix and continued DTC shift, then every analyst and investor is going to tweak their models up in a big way.   Thus far, management has been relatively cautious about this fortuitous shift to DTC continuing.   [If web traffic is any indicator](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/i7gjsn/prpl_q2_revenue_forecast_using_web_traffic/), it will, but we need management to tell us that.\n\n**Warrant Liability Accrual**\n\nI could be dead wrong on my assumptions above on this one.   If it stays, there will be questions about it due to the drop in exercise price.   It does impact GAAP earnings (although it shouldn't--stupid accountants).\n\n**Capacity Expansion Rate**\n\nThis is a BIG one as well.   As PRPL has been famously capacity constrained: their rate of manufacturing capacity expansion is their growth rate over the next year.  PRPL discontinued expansion at the beginning of COVID and then re-accelerated it to a faster pace than pre-COVID by hurrying the machines in-process out to the floor.   They also signed their [manufacturing space deal](https://investors.purple.com/press-releases/news-details/2020/Purple-Expands-U.S.-Manufacturing-with-a-New-Facility-in-Georgia/default.aspx) which has nearly doubled manufacturing space a quarter early.   The REAL question is when the machines will start rolling out.   Previous guidance was end of the year at best.   If we get anything sooner than that, we are going to ratchet up.\n\n**CACs (Customer Acquisition Costs)**\n\nSince DTC is the new game in town, we are all going to want to understand exactly where marketing expenses were this quarter and, more importantly, where management thinks they are going.   The magic words to listen for are \"marketing efficiencies\".   Those words means the stock goes up.  This is the next biggest line item on the P&amp;L besides revenue and cost of goods sold.\n\n**New Product Categories**\n\nWe [heard the VP of Brand](https://www.iheart.com/podcast/256-authentic-influence-31157510/episode/purple-vp-of-brand-burke-morley-67762598/) from Purple give us some touchy-feely vision of where the company is headed and that mattresses was just the revenue generating base to empower this.   I'm hoping we hear more about this.    This is what differentiated Amazon from Barnes and Noble:  Amazon's vision was more than just books.   Purple sees itself as more than just mattresses.   Hopefully we get some announced action behind that vision.   This multiplies the stock.\n\n**Cashless Exercise of PRPLW Warrants**\n\nI doubt this will be answered, even if the question is asked.   I bet they wait until the 20 out of 30 days is up and they deliver notice.   We could be pleasantly surprised.   If management informs us that they will opt for cashless exercise of the warrants, this is anti-dilutive to EPS.   It will reduce the number of outstanding shares and automatically cause an adjustment up in the stock price (remember kids, some people use math when investing).   I'm hopeful, but not expecting it.   The amount of the adjustment depends on the current price of the stock.    Also, I fully expect PRPL management to use their cashless exercise option at the end of the 20 out of 30 days as they are already spitting cash.\n\n# Positions\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tho65crvkng51.png?width=1242&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6241ff5e8b26744f9d7119ddef7da86f163c741d\n\nI'm not just holding, I added.\n\nPRPLW Warrants:  391,280\n\nPRPL Call Debit Spreads:   17.5c/25c 8/21 x90, 20c/25c 8/21 x247\n\nAlso, I bought some CSPR 7.5p 8/21 x200 for fun because I think that sucker is going to get shamed back down to $6 after a real mattress company shows what it can do.",

        "selftext": "To start, you are going to look at this and think... why in the HELL would i buy a $CORN futures ETF? \n\nHERE IS EXACTLY WHY AND I'LL EXPLAIN  \nCorn Yield has been at historic lows for the last 3 years, hence the massive decline in value for this ETF. This ETF tracks the 2nd and 3rd highest Future Contracts, followed by an end of year December Contract. \n\n**Why the hell would you care about this?** \n\nBecause Tomorrow is the $CORN Yield Crop Report... This report is about to absolutely KICK ASS showing that the corn yield from this year is beyond incredible. Now you're probably wondering why the hell this CORNBALL is rambling about corn. Lets dive into some interesting things that are happening with Corn... in real time. First looking at the open interest.\n\n**Corn for August**   \n15k volume, 99% of it on Corn. This is coming with 10k of that volume RIPPING into the market today. This is more times than not a HUGE indication that someone, somewhere knows something that us PEASANTS do not know. So we are going to trust the Mayans and follow this belief.   \n\n\nHELL TAKE A LOOK AT THIS OPEN INTEREST BOARD FOR FRIGGIN CORN! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[LOOK AT THIS CORN REPORT ](https://preview.redd.it/fqxehq0v1eg51.jpg?width=540&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b47079245c8fd026d613e1f1bb043c9c661ba2e3)\n\nWhat is the wildest piece about this, it how much Volume is on the short term in comparison to any other expire date. Now if you don't think this isn't someone, somewhere whose about to get PAID you are smoking better corn than me! \n\nBut lets also look at some strikes here within our lovely friend RobinHood.   \n\n\n  \n\n\n[now this is REALLY wild. So, you're only gonna lose about 1.5 cents for the theta decay, but per dollar we're looking at a LOVELY $35 dollar move. ](https://preview.redd.it/cra4cph52eg51.png?width=653&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=73d41e80bbef622eaf6f8e2530a949e84ae38959)\n\nLOOK AT THE VOLUME ON THIS CALL! That is ludicrous. Couple it with the IV and you got a match made in heaven. Now, I am about to bring your eyes to some TA and I know TA is dumb and fake thats exactly why I saved it for the end, cause if you're still reading, you're already sold on $CORN. \n\nAs you should be.   \nCorn. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[This Chart May Look Scary ](https://preview.redd.it/4mtn1rx93eg51.png?width=671&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=13d82b54e614ba103141008ffb854c42fd6e3728)\n\nBUT, all indicators are showing some BEAUTIFUL things. Look at that RSI, oversold. and its PRIMEDDD for a retrace back up to that 12c look what happened last time there was a 2 standard deviation from the 50ma!? it ripped back to it and through it. \n\nI believe tomorrows report will be phenomenal for $CORN, and if you miss the boat, that's on you. \n\nThank you for coming to my corn talk.",

        "selftext": "Hello there\n\nI posted about [6 weeks ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/hn9ydm/defense_stocks_what_the_heck_is_going_on/) about defense being undervalued and they\u2019ve climbed 15-20% since then (besides HII which completely whiffed earnings) and I am now starting to see value in the oil sector(s). The June high and subsequent re-crash for oil industry coincided directly with the new covid case rate picking up. With covid cases declining and oil stocks generally trading in ranges for over a month now, I present my case for a break in those ranges\n\nThere are a couple of tailwinds that are happening right now for WTI:\n\n* New covid cases in the US have dropped substantially from their peak and are on a downtrend [according to JHU\u2019s data](https://i.imgur.com/EShb2sU.jpg). Globally, it seems to be seesawing in a confined range\n* [China is buying a large amount of US crude by September])https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trade-china-oil-exclusive/exclusive-china-ramps-up-u-s-oil-purchases-ahead-of-trade-deal-review-sources-idUSKCN25A2F4), potentially 37 million barrels [according to this](https://oilprice.com/Latest-Energy-News/World-News/China-Charters-Tankers-For-37-Million-Barrels-Of-US-Oil.html)\n* After flooding the US market with [Saudi oil](https://www.npr.org/2020/05/04/850026351/saudi-arabias-oil-tanker-flotilla-is-reaching-the-u-s-despite-some-objections#:~:text=Live%20Sessions-,Saudi%20Arabia's%20Oil%20Tanker%20Flotilla%20Is%20Reaching%20The%20U.S.%2C%20Despite,are%20headed%20to%20the%20U.S.), they have now cut exports to a [record low ](https://oilprice.com/Latest-Energy-News/World-News/Saudi-Arabias-Crude-Oil-Exports-Dip-To-Record-Low-In-June.html)\n* The dual storms in the Gulf have caused a lot of [shut-ins](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-storms-energy/oil-firms-evacuate-staff-curb-offshore-production-ahead-of-twin-storms-idUSKBN25I0J3)\n* After stalling in July, air traffic is starting to [pick back up](https://www.tsa.gov/coronavirus/passenger-throughput) and routes are being added again, although still way way down\nWhich all support WTI prices in the coming weeks. Should be noted that rig counts have continued to lows, however last week was the first week in a long time that a few rigs came back online, which will add to the inventory. How much, I am not sure. You can see from [Baker Hughes\u2019 rig count]( https://rigcount.bakerhughes.com/rig-count-overview) that we added 10 rigs, but are still down a net of 662 rigs from last year. Next we can take a look at the [EIA data](https://www.eia.gov/petroleum/supply/weekly/) for some more insight into what current inventories are like:\n\n* 512M barrels of crude, 15% above average. Peak was 540M barrels on June 19th\n* 244M barrels of gasoline, 7% above average. Peak was before covid due to build over the winter\n* 178M barrels of distillates, 24% above average. Peak was 180M barrels on July 31st\n* Refinery inputs at 14.5M barrels, low was 12.4M barrels on May 13th \n* Refinery rates at 81%. At the low on April 22nd it was at 67%, normally around 95%.\n* WTI is trading in the $42-43 range, with the low being negative due to the contract rollover situation back in the Spring\n\nThe last several EIA reports have been good in general \u2013 drawing down of products, with two weeks in a row of fantastic gasoline draw down. \n\nWhat\u2019s my point here? The takeaway should be this: the worst is over. Now is the best chance for a while to get beaten up value stocks at a discount, as the industry recovers and conditions for the crash are resolving\n\nRight now cyclicals have been beaten down to Earth\u2019s core as tech goes up and up. Cyclicals and value generally outperform in a market recovery and I expect a rotation at some point, strengthened by a combination of inventory drops making headlines, covid cases going down, and a general resumption of normal. Any stimulus would be big news for these beaten down stocks as well\n\nWorried about a Democratic administration? Unlike the defense stocks I had previously looked at, I think it\u2019s a real issue for this industry. The Democratic platform calls out removing tax breaks for oil and gas companies while adding environmental regulations. It\u2019s weird that big tech has been climbing \u2013 companies like Amazon, Apple, Facebook etc. that are known tax avoiders and privacy usurpers seem like prime candidates to have a \u2018tax bill fear\u2019 from the Dem\u2019s closing of tax avoidance legislation and future lawsuits. I haven\u2019t seen any hints of this in the market, so I am going to assume this is not considered a big deal by investors\n\nHowever, I still believe these low valuations are still too low, even with headwinds. Some of the majors have already been adjusting (Shell in particular) and refineries like Valero already have strong renewable fuels segments; Phillips 66 recently announced plans to build the [biggest renewable diesel refinery in the world](https://investor.phillips66.com/financial-information/news-releases/news-release-details/2020/Phillips-66-Plans-to-Transform-San-Francisco-Refinery-into-Worlds-Largest-Renewable-Fuels-Plant/default.aspx)\n\nWhat am I looking at in particular?\n\nRight now, refineries have the best value to me. PSX is **criminally** undervalued with a safe dividend. VLO is another that is set for strong performance. MPC has a strong position after its Speedway asset sale, but I would rank PSX&gt;VLO&gt;MPC at this point for value.\n\n* PSX target price: ~$82, sitting currently at ~$61\n* VLO target price: ~71-72, sitting currently at ~$52.50\n\nFrom a producer standpoint, CVX and COP are both fundamentally solid (I prefer COP at this point). RDS is the closest its been to it\u2019s covid low and is one of the leading majors in transitioning off oil. It\u2019s been beaten down since losing its dividend but I can only assume it will be back. I\u2019m not a fan of XOM going forward, but right now it\u2019s at the low of the range it\u2019s been confined in and wouldn\u2019t be a bad temporary pickup. FANG / EOG / PXD aren\u2019t bad pickups either\n\nPS \u2013 stay away from OXY. It\u2019s very clear they\u2019re going to continue to issue shares until they\u2019re through their debt and the pummeling is well deserved. It was popular for a while, not sure how it\u2019s still viewed, just stay away\n\nTLDR; buy refineries and the producers worth buying that aren't drowning in debt or have terrible assets\n\nDisclosure: I have a large position in PSX calls",

Also, he enacted a payroll tax cut that will be come a grant IF he becomes re-elected. So inflation will continue to rise, oh and the Fed is capping interest rates on bonds. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2) Metals compete DIRECTLY with REAL (inflation adjusted) interest rates. As a foundational bedrock investment of  Pensions, Mutual Funds, and general portfolios - people have traditionally held long term bonds.  Metals are a 0% thing, you can't eat them and they are basically a pet rock - but they are stable at 0% forever, as metals were the ORIGINAL money.  If you take the current bond rate, and subtract the inflation rate, you get -1.1%.  This is causing MASSIVE moves in the market as people leave bonds and crowd into metals, as 0% beats the hell out of negative REAL rates.  Currently Gold is at 2100, if we go to -2% REAL rates, Gold will be 2500. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n3) Learn about Rehypothecation here ([https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rehypothecation.asp#:\\~:text=Rehypothecation%20is%20a%20practice%20whereby,or%20a%20rebate%20on%20fees.](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rehypothecation.asp#:~:text=Rehypothecation%20is%20a%20practice%20whereby,or%20a%20rebate%20on%20fees.)).  For obvious reasons, this is why housing blew up in 2008.  The exact same thing is happening in Silver, but inversely.  Silver has been abused for so long, but it REALLY started in 2011. The \"classic\" (meaning the mined ratio, or the ratio at which they pull this shit out of the ground) is around 16:1.  In 2005, the ratio was 60:1.  On Friday's close, the Silver/Gold ratio was 79:1.  Silver has a LONG way to catch-up.  At CURRENT levels, Silver SHOULD be (assuming a 60:1 ratio) \\~ 35ish.  So when you look at the fact that Silver has been abused for so long that its undervalued, coupled with the Massive run on metals due to negative REAL rates, Silver has massive upside. The amount of fund inflows into Silver ETF's is another leg up on silver as well - they eventually are going to have to officially re-value silver to reflect fund inflows and sentiment.  Who knows what the new Silver/Gold ratio could end up as...but I'm betting its a LOT lower than 60:1. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n4a) Banks will continue to fight us on silver, but they are losing as they were massively short, and the world blew up in their face.  HSBC lost $200M in a single day, and closed their industrial metals business around 6 weeks ago ( [https://www.kitco.com/news/2020-07-03/HSBC-closes-its-industrial-metals-business.html](https://www.kitco.com/news/2020-07-03/HSBC-closes-its-industrial-metals-business.html) ).  Soctiabank also closed down its metals trading desk around 4 months ago ( [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-metals-bank-of-nova-scotia-exclusive/exclusive-scotiabank-to-close-its-metals-business-sources-idUSKCN22A2ZC#:\\~:text=%E2%80%9CScotia%20had%20a%20global%20call,said%20one%20of%20the%20sources.&amp;text=A%20spokeswoman%20for%20Scotiabank%20declined,around%20the%20beginning%20of%202021.](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-metals-bank-of-nova-scotia-exclusive/exclusive-scotiabank-to-close-its-metals-business-sources-idUSKCN22A2ZC#:~:text=%E2%80%9CScotia%20had%20a%20global%20call,said%20one%20of%20the%20sources.&amp;text=A%20spokeswoman%20for%20Scotiabank%20declined,around%20the%20beginning%20of%202021.) )  This means the ONLY one left is JPM, and they are still trying to fight us, but are losing and continuing to wind down shorts. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n4b) The $1.5 drop we saw Thursday night was exactly this - banks reloading shorts to try and fight us, but there is a big difference. An ALL TIME RECORD amount of shorts were opened on the Comex on Thursday, around 350k contracts....a RECORD amount...and all it did was $1.50 in damage....so that should tell you where sentiment and price action is.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLHLEAbZUA8&amp;t=1s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLHLEAbZUA8&amp;t=1s) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n5) Silver is about to go hyperbolic and nothing is in it's way.  The fed is printing money (driving inflation), people are already crowding metals, banks are unwinding their short positions (or closing their metals trading desk all together), and there are HISTORIC inflows into Silver - which will eventually cause a revaluation to the upside.  I'm an EE and I love Technical Analysis, but this is 100% fundamental driven. \n\nA retired energy trader once told me \"Fundamentals will tell you why something is happening, TA will tell you when\".  TA is broken on metals right now and all its doing is making algos and morons try to load shorts.  Multinational global banks are literally leaving the idea of shorting metals, so maybe follow suit?  These are some of the smartest people on earth and I hate bankers, but they aren't dumb.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHave a great week.",

        "selftext": "**Disclaimer:** I did not invent this indicator or find this correlation. All credit goes to a very intelligent trader on Twitter named Kerberos007 who might be borderline obsessed with finding data-based crash indicators.\n\n**The Indicator:** Let me be clear. I am by no means a great trader. But I found this guy\u2019s crash thesis and checked it against every SPY crash in recent history that I could. It's deadly accurate. I feel like a chimpanzee trying to explain the concept of why fire burns but if it saves some of you guys from not being able to afford the bubble wrap and capri-suns you love, maybe it\u2019s worth it. If you graph the correlation between the daily value of the SPX and GLD, you will see an interesting pattern emerge. In the period before a market crash, they will begin to have a higher correlation. At some point that correlation will become so positive that it crosses the threshold of 0.6. From what I can see, how long it stays above 0.6 doesn\u2019t really matter. The most important part is that when the correlation starts to break down and returns to 0.6 on the way down, all hell breaks loose within 1-3 days. When it triggers, it doesn\u2019t always mean Armageddon type SPY damage but it will be a significant pullback. For example, you can see that it was triggered on 6/5 which was just a couple days before our last significant pullback.\n\n**Where is it Now:** As of today 8/11/20 the correlation is at .64 and dropping like a rock. I\u2019m not telling you guys to go all in on puts because putting all your faith in one indicator doesn\u2019t make sense. I\u2019m just saying that when that .60 threshold is crossed just make sure you are hedged effectively for at least the next 3 trading days. Maybe just a little more bearish than usual just in case things get froggy.\n\n**TLDR:** Be prepared for a big red day once the correlation between GLD and SPX decreases to 0.60. Good luck my brothers. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/icji9e4gkeg51.png?width=854&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b07cca589a5dd117dbd15a3f8b99c3b4ca286866\n\nP.S.

The order will take effect after 10 days, as the companies requested a brief stay during the appeals process.\n&gt; \n&gt; If upheld, the ruling could have serious implications for Uber and Lyft, both of which are not yet profitable and have seen their ride-hailing businesses suffer during the pandemic. By classifying their drivers as independent workers, rather than employees, the companies have not had to pay for costly benefits that come with a full-time staff. \n&gt; \n&gt; California Attorney General Xavier Becerra requested the injunction as part of a lawsuit he brought in May along with city attorneys from San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego. The suit, filed in San Francisco Superior Court, alleged Uber and Lyft violated the state\u2019s new law known as Assembly Bill 5 (AB5), which was created as a way to classify gig workers as full employees and ensure benefits from their employers. Uber and Lyft were among a group of tech companies that have previously opposed the bill, arguing their workers enjoy the flexibility of creating their own schedules as contractors. \n&gt; \n&gt; California officials sought an injunction on the alleged misclassification and restitution for workers and civil penalties worth up to hundreds of millions of dollars.\n&gt; \n&gt; Shares of Uber were down 0.8% during extended trading Monday and Lyft shares were down 1.7%.\n&gt; \n&gt; Both companies said they would appeal the ruling immediately.\n&gt; \n&gt; \u201cThe vast majority of drivers want to work independently, and we\u2019ve already made significant changes to our app to ensure that remains the case under California law,\u201d an Uber spokesperson said. \u201cWhen over 3 million Californians are without a job, our elected leaders should be focused on creating work, not trying to shut down an entire industry during an economic depression.\u201d\n&gt; \n&gt; \u201cDrivers do not want to be employees, full stop,\u201d Lyft said in a statement. \u201cWe\u2019ll immediately appeal this ruling and continue to fight for their independence. Ultimately, we believe this issue will be decided by California voters and that they will side with drivers.\u201d \n&gt; \n&gt; \u201cThe court has weighed in and agreed: Uber and Lyft need to put a stop to unlawful misclassification of their drivers while our litigation continues,\u201d Becerra said in a statement. \u201cWhile this fight still has a long way to go, we\u2019re pushing ahead to make sure the people of California get the workplace protections they deserve. Our state and workers shouldn\u2019t have to foot the bill when big businesses try to skip out on their responsibilities. We\u2019re going to keep working to make sure Uber and Lyft play by the rules.\u201d\n&gt; \n&gt; Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi advocated for a \u201cthird way\u201d to classify workers in a letter to President Donald Trump in March as the first round of coronavirus relief measures were being negotiated. He argued there should be a way for workers to gain protections without sacrificing the flexibility of contract work.\n&gt; \n&gt; In the ruling, Judge Ethan Schulman recognized the value of flexibility offered by Uber and Lyft, writing, \u201cThe Court does not take lightly Defendants\u2019 showing that a preliminary injunction may also have an adverse effect on some of their drivers, many of whom desire the flexibility to continue working as they have in the past, and may have commitments that make it difficult if not impossible for them to become full-time employees.\u201d\n&gt; \n&gt; But Schulman wrote that Uber and Lyft\u2019s concerns that the injunction would have \u201cfar-reaching effects\u201d had \u201conly been exacerbated by Defendants\u2019 prolonged and brazen refusal to comply with California law. Defendants may not evade legislative mandates merely because their businesses are so large that they affect the lives of many thousands of people.\u201d\n&gt; \n&gt; Schulman wrote that any impact of the injunction on Uber and Lyft\u2019s businesses would likely be mitigated by the fact that both have said the \u201cvast majority of their drivers work on a casual or sporadic basis\u201d and the reality that the coronavirus pandemic has \u201cdrastically reduced the demand for Defendants\u2019 services.\u201d\n&gt; \n&gt; \u201cNow, when Defendants\u2019 ridership is at an all-time low, may be the best time (or the least worst time) for Defendants to change their business practices to conform to California law without causing widespread adverse effects on their drivers,\u201d Schulman wrote.\n&gt; \n&gt; Uber and Lyft sought to delay the ruling until there was a ruling on Uber\u2019s constitutional challenge of AB5 or until voters weighed in on a ballot measure they sponsored to exempt them from the law. The Court dismissed those requests.\n&gt; \n&gt; Schulman said Uber\u2019s arguments that drivers\u2019 work was outside the ordinary course of its business, as the standard requires, was \u201ca classic example of circular reasoning.\u201d He summarized the argument as saying that since Uber views itself as a tech company, only its tech workers are its employees.\n&gt; \n&gt; \u201cWere this reasoning to be accepted, the rapidly expanding majority of industries that rely heavily on technology could with impunity deprive legions of workers of the basic protections afforded to employees by state labor and employment laws,\u201d the judge wrote.\n&gt; \n&gt; The ruling does not end the legal battles for Uber and Lyft, however. Last week, California\u2019s Labor Commissioner announced lawsuits against the companies alleging wage theft due to misclassification. The commission seeks to recover wages it believes were owed to drivers currently classified as contractors. The suits were filed in Alameda County Superior Court.",

        "selftext": "All you autists worried about RKT and will end up paper handing any dips need to wake up. RKT is one of the best deals on the market right now. Here's why:\n\n**RKT will undoubtedly eventually be valued as a Fintech Company.**\n\nWhy? Because it has all the core components of a fintech company. RKT at it's core is a consumer-facing, tech-based mortgage origination platform and it's productivity, Revenue per Employee, and margins are **in line if not better than fintech players**. Let's take a look:\n\n* RKT's Q1 2020 EBITDA Margin was a **blistering 44%!** Compare that other FinTechs latest EBITDA margins \n   * SHOP at negative 1.9%\n   * GWRE at 6%\n   * LMND at negative 73%!\n   * PYPL at 19%\n* RKT has an **Revenue per Employee (as of 3/31/20) figure of $300k**! Again, compare to other Fintechs, RKT is nearly the exact Median\n   * SHOP at $416k / employee\n   * GWRE at $276k / employee\n   * LMND at $251k / employee\n   * PYPL at $828k / employee\n* Now, let's look at the valuation for the other Fintechs. **RKT is very obviously undervalued compared to the segment**\n   * Enterprise Value / Revenue\n      * SHOP - 54.3x LTM Revenue\n      * GWRE - 11.7x LTM Revenue\n      * LMND - 44.3x LTM Revenue\n      * PYPL - 11.4x LTM Revenue\n      * **RKT - 2.2x LTM Revenue**\n   * P/E\n      * SHOP - N/A, negative EPS\n      * GWRE - 333x P/E\n      * LMND - N/A,negative EPS\n      * PYPL - 87x P/E\n      * **RKT - 7.7x P/E**\n\n**But, but, what about the mortgage volume? Isn't RKT exposed to interest rates and mortgage volume?**\n\nPlain and simple, there is no force that is going to stop volume right now. We can all say that fundamentals don't matter and for stock market pricing they may not. But in terms of interest rate action by the Fed, they very much do matter, and it is clear the Fed does not intend to raise rate until fundamentals truly stabilize. And if rates do come up, it will mean even J.Pow &amp; Co think inflation is getting too hot. Fuck SLV gang, **Real Estate is the ultimate anti-inflation safe-haven.** So volume should remain largely unaffected as investors seek inflation protection.\n\n**RKT continues to gain market share in an expanding market**\n\nLet's face it, eventually boomers will not be applying for new mortgages and millennials are not going to walk into Chase with a $100 fountain pen to apply for a mortgage. One of the biggest themes of the housing market today is increasing rate of home ownership among millenials. RKT's completely digitized offering positions them to capitalize on market trends. The numbers prove this as RKT's share of the total mortgage market has increased from 1.3% in 2009 to &gt;9% in the first quarter of 2020, making RKT the **largest mortgage originator in the US.**\n\n**RKT's technology drives faster, better outcomes for end consumer**\n\nRKT's application process can be understood as \"parallel\" vs. the traditional mortgage industry's \"linear\" process. This results in faster approvals and faster closing times. RKT closes loans 25% faster than the industry average - 29 days on average vs. the industry average of 40 days. Not only is this good for the end consumer (instant-gratification millennials), it means RKT's workforce is significantly more efficient than the industry average, closing average of **8.3 loans per month per team member** in YTD 2020 vs. the **industry average of 2.3 per moth per team member**\n\n**In summary, the retail mortgage industry is in desperate need of digitization. RKT is perfectly positioned to capitalize on this need.** After all, who else is going to do this? Penny-fucking-Mac?\n\nTLDR: Go long RKT, I am long shares and will continue to add on dips.",

So I decided to make one.\n\nIt's called Waffles \ud83e\uddc7. Waffles is a free tool that gives anyone the ability to intuitively build and graphically analyze option strategies on any U.S. ticker. I'm excited to get this out into the world. It should be up and running by this weekend.\n\nManually building trades will be a thing of the past. With Waffles, select the strategy you would like to build and let Waffles do the work for you. That's it. What used to take know-how, time and tedious work and now takes a click.\n\n[Toggling through pre-built strategies](https://i.redd.it/r3ret7ksvyh51.gif)\n\nRepositioning and customizing trades is as easy as building them. Even reposition the trade using keyboard shortcuts \ud83d\udd25. I hope that quickly building and repositioning strategies will lead to some interesting discoveries from you \ud83d\ude0a --- or bigger and better YOLOs.\n\nReal-time feedback on factors such as implied volatility and time to expiration.

        "selftext": "Just got to thinking about all the money robinhood is skimming off the top, and the audacity of their name in light of this.\n\nOther firms report payment for order flow, at least on shares. TDA or Charles Schwab, for example are getting an average of about 1/10 of a cent per share... Robinhood doesn\u2019t post their data. \n\nThis is why Citadel and other huge trading firms pay more for robinhood orders, as there are no parameters publicly listed anywhere and they \u201cget away\u201d with taking more off the top. For shares, it can be a few cents.\n\n\u201cIf a customer buys 100 shares of Apple for $200 each\u2014a $20,000 purchase\u2014Robinhood could get up to $5.20 for routing that order to electronic-trading giant Citadel Securities LLC, according to calculations based on a recent Securities and Exchange Commission filing.\n\nSchwab would be paid around 9 cents for sending the same order to Citadel, while TD Ameritrade would get 16 cents on average, according to these companies\u2019 SEC filings.\n\nThat\u2019s a nearly 60-to-1 difference between what Robinhood and Schwab are paid. The gap isn\u2019t always so wide, because of differences in the formulas used to determine the size of the payments. Still, Robinhood often makes much more for the same orders, the filings suggest.\u201d\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/articles/why-free-trading-on-robinhood-isnt-really-free-1541772001\n\nOptions data isn\u2019t available for TDA, Schwab, etc., but given the difference in share payment for order flow from Robinhood to electronic trading giant Citadel, would it surprise anyone they were also paying more for options? \n\nRobinhood likes to set quite a large bid-ask spread as the default for options with an easy button and number for a retail investor to click that is in the middle, further gouging inexperienced traders.\n\nBut besides that little trick, what about the prices that they show on the screen as the bid/ask.\n\nHow do the option prices compare in real time, bid / ask vs. other brokerages.\n\nI want to do more research.",

I placed the order for 20 contracts and it would not take the limit of 0.18 on RH, it kept saying that the trade has to be in 5cent increments so I had to place a limit buy with .20 limit. The order executed for 20cents a contract (total $400) and I was already down $40 as soon as the buy executed. So now I waited for the Corn report and knew it was bad. In a bid to minimize my losses I wanted to sell my contracts and they were still trading at 18cents for the 12c 08/21, but then again I was unable to place the sell order with a limit of 0.18 as RH said it had to be in 5cent multiples. So I placed a Limit sell at 0.20\n\nSo I decided to wait it out and see if by any chance the contract would go up in value to 0.20 so I can break even and sell at 0.20. Well the 8/21 calls started dropping in value and suddenly started trading at 0.13 not even 0.15. Now I just decided to sell no matter what and was forced to set limit of .10 since if I set it at 0.15 it would not sell, just like it had not sold at 0.20. So I end up placing sell limit order at 0.10 which executed immediately so my total loss within a span of couple of hours was 50% ($200) of my initial $400 investment.\n\nAm I making some rookie mistake here??",

Also, FB is valued at $760B with much lower revenue and decelerating growth, so its gap vs GOOG seems small. \n\nIs GOOG a good buy? Are these other companies just overvalued? Curious what you all think.  \nHere's my thinking:\n\n* GOOG has rock-solid fundamentals - excellent gross margins, has maintained \\~15%+ YoY revenue growth even at their scale, and search is a steady business with many entrypoints across the Google ecosystem\n* GOOG has bets across so many forward-looking industries that I think they will be able to diversify over time and don't have real risk of not continuing to innovate. There's of course the risk of anti-trust and privacy regulations, but that's been true for years now (although things do appear to be ratcheting up).\n* It seems their stock hasn't mooned during covid because a meaningful share of search volume (and subsequently search revenue) comes from brick-and-mortar businesses (as opposed to someone like FB, whose ads biz is more of an ecommerce/direct-to-consumer play), which puts a drag on their revenue. This was the main reason for their relatively weak Q2 earnings a couple weeks back.  \n\nDisclaimer: I own shares of every company mentioned here.

I\u2019ve posted my result here two weeks ago - I had 7 winning trades in a row and my account jumped from $10k to $30k. For those who missed my previous post - in my trades I\u2019m following the narrative that fundamentals now mean nothing since Fed started printing in March. Instead of using FA or TA I\u2019m now using macroeconomic sentiment analysis, which is basically a weekly survey of 150k analysts from 130 countries conducted by some company. They\u2019re asking simple questions like \u201cWhat\u2019s the employment situation in your inner circle: are people losing their jobs and have salary cuts or vice versa\u201d; and post several indicators based on it every week. It\u2019s not an ad so I\u2019m not sharing the company\u2019s name here (unless you ask in DM).\n\nSo, last week was no trade according to sentiments, but this week had a very surprising (for me) guidance - buy calls. I was a bit afraid to follow the call (pun intented) because I think there will be a correction pretty soon. \n\nAnyway, I\u2019ve bought SPY calls (327 strike) for $3.7-ish on Monday and sold today at $5.5-ish with 50% (about $5k) profit. I also was thinking about selling some 332 strike or so to make a spread, but decided just to take profit (don\u2019t want to reinvent the wheel). So this is my 8 profitable trade in a row (I know other sentiment traders had 12 wins in a row).\n\nI think I\u2019ll continue for a few weeks with the same risk-per-trade and then I\u2019ll increase my risk by two times. What\u2019s your thoughts re sentiment analysis?",

        "selftext": "[Gains](https://imgur.com/gallery/afMJcB4)\n\nI\u2019m very surprised about the lack of attention NVAX gets on this sub considering it has rallied much more than something like TSLA and is a pharmaceutical stock in the middle of a pandemic. Read this and maybe some of you autists can make up the money you lost on MSFT calls and buying KODK at $50.\n\nBackstory:\n\nI have held this stock since 2016 with nothing but diamond hands. In September 2016, they failed their stage 3 clinical trial and fell 84%. In 2019, they issued a 1:20 reverse split. I continued to be optimistic hoping their NanoFlu vaccine could bring some revival to the stock and even doubled down on my initial investment to get my average price down to ~$26. I was rewarded for this once COVID hit.\n\nWhy NVAX?\n\nNVAX was one of the first of the operation warp speed companies to receive significant funding, and they will be a key player in the development of a vaccine. It has, by far had the biggest % gain of all the warp speed companies. \n\nThey will be releasing their phase 1 clinical trial results after hours today.\n\nThe reason NVAX will be more successful than any of the other pharmaceuticals/biotechs is because they already have technology and experience from previous attempts in the type of vaccine that will be used. They use their owned recombinant nanoparticle technology to generate antigen derived from the coronavirus spike (S) protein and contains Novavax\u2019 patented saponin-based Matrix-M.\n\nNVAX, without any COVID vaccine is already incredibly undervalued as is. Their NanoFlu vaccine has shown to be very effective in phase 3 clinical studies and has already been shown to be much more effective than the version Sanofi has developed.\n\nAs a plus, unlike other CEOs of this sector dumping all their stocks, the CEO has increased his number of shares since the beginning of COVID.\n\nImportant events:\n\nMay 11 2020: Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) awards NVAX $384 million to advance clinical development of their COVID vaccine NVX-CoV2373.\n\nJuly 7 2020: Trump awards NVAX $1.6 Billion\n\n7/27: Trump visits FujiFilm factory that will be manufacturing batches used in NVAX Phase 3 trial and awards FujiFilm a $265 million contract.\n\nPhase 1 clinical trials are expected after hours today, so this may be your last opportunity before this stock truly goes to Pluto.\n\nThings ik you autists will say:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s already ballooned why would I buy in now\u201d\n\nPeople were saying this when it hit 40. People were saying this when it hit 70. Then 90. Then 110. Then 140. Somehow people are still bearish on this after it hit $160 yesterday. Today will be the biggest news NVAX will have regarding COVID, buy in today while you can.\n\n\u201cIt hasn\u2019t produced a single thing available on the market\u201d\n\nVery true, but this time is different. Right now, not only does it have the support of Donnie, it also has international support from CEPI as well as the direct funding from the likes of Bill Gates. The technology they have been working on for the past decade will directly be used in their vaccine.\n\n\nMy personal success:\n\nMost of my gains as you\u2019ll see are simply from holding the stock long term. I have also taken up theta gang strategies to sell very OTM options to degenerates as I have no need to take the risk of buy options at this level. At this point if I am forced to sell my shares, I will be happy to take my $4 million and run. \n\nI will admit, buying call options are incredibly profitable and decently easy to predict. For example, this was known to be a very big week for NVAX (even with earnings being pushed back) and it had been facing a resistance at $150 for the past three weeks. Even WSB autists can see that it would likely break $150 sometime this week, and in a pleasant surprise, it managed to do that today and hit a 52wk high in the process. \n\n\nTLDR; NVAX goes brrr. Stage 1 clinical trial data released after hours today will make NVAX go more brrrrr. Earnings coming out next week will make NVAX go even more brrrrrrrrr.",

        "selftext": "Yes I know what you're thinking Autist, as you sit on your gaming chair sipping your choccy milk. \"I've seen all these \ud83d\udc3b posts before and stonks kept going up, printer goes BRRRRRR\"\n\nFundamentals haven't mattered for months, and except for some sharp pullbacks, NQ and SPY have all been on an absolute tear being instabid on every dip.\n\nThat's all about the change.\n\nTldr - bond market/ PM pricing in no deal on stimulus.\n- Bifurcation of NQ and SPY reached major tipping points.\n- DXY likely to bounce back strongly on risk off sentiment and foreign central bank action.\n- macro long term positioning for Inflation playing out across asset class correlations ( RUSSELL and value stocks starting to gain traction )\n\n1.\nPriced In has become a retarded meme at this point but what does it actually mean? It means basically that the market, chiefly big \ud83d\udcb0 / institutions are expecting a future outcome ( or probability of one) and have allocated money appropriately. Historically Fixed Income due to its relative size has been a fairly reliable indicator. Previous crashes this year such as Feb/March crash and the mini NQ/SPY crash in June and July were both foreshadowed by major/ high Vol shifts downwards in 10 year bond prices .\n\nCurrently 10 year are plumbing new lows at the bottom end of 0.50 percent ( discounting the March flash crash ). This coupled with the meteoric rise in GLD and SLV last night IS NOT A GOOD SIGN. The sharp changes occured directly after stimulus news. \n\nWhat this means is that Institutions are signalling a chance the package will not be passed on time or in its entirety . \n\nBUT BUT VIX IS DOWN AND EQUITIES ARE UPPIES!\nyes little autismo, they are but that doesn't mean what you think it does. it's a poorly kept secret that this market is being kept afloat by hedge funds , institutional buying and retail fomo. I don't have the crayons or time to explain it to you but just look at news releases, support level buying and virus/ trade talks pumps. institutional players left the market in February , now it's just algos and retail. Vix being low doesn't necessarily mean what you think it does either. To oversimplify VIX goes up when more people buy puts. This is typically done hedge against market drops. \nBig players don't need to hedge if they SOLD all/ most of their equity holdings and moved it into Bonds/ Gold / Foreign equity. Hedge funds are also notorious for shorting VIX as part of the 'Fed Put \" trade . The fact that FI/PM are up while VIX is down makes me more certain of a drop not less as it means Big boys are trying to pass as many bags as they can to retail without spooking them.\n\n2. There's been a lot of articles on this already so I'll keep it short, you all know how to use Google. SPY since March lows has been split in two like a sociopathic Solomon. There is the big 5 tech and everything else. Currently Big 5 is sitting at 25 percent of all market cap with huge returns over the last few months. This coupled with the performance differential of the other 495 has surpassed levels not seen since the dot com boom. THIS IS NOT SIGN OF A HEALTHY BULL MARKET. Major Bifurcation is the second best signifier of a \ud83d\udc3b after the technical 20 percent drop level ( which doesn't really mean much) . \ud83c\udf4f Has now become the largest company in the world surpassing Saudi Aramco. THIS TECH BOOM IS NOT SUSTAINABLE. Most of the apple gains have been from a one of WFH structural shift and Fiscal stimulus ( that now accounts for 25 percent of all disposable income ). If the stimulus bill doesn't pass, Apple is fucked. Just look at the AAPL gains from the last week, do you think this is sustainable?\n\nThe common retort on this sub is, \" we all know it's a bubble but it will pop in few months, I'm getting my TENDIES while they're hot! \"\n\nThis sentiment has been thrown around for months all through April to July. Well what if months later is now? What better catalyst for a bubble pop than a Stimulus not going through as planned? \n\n3. There's been a lot of posts about DXY dying and a lot of it is half true. Currencies are a hard thing to predict but I do want to point out two very key factors that are bullish for DXY. \n3a- The entire world, especially emerging markets rely on Dollar inflows from exports to fund imports for key goods, especially commodities (oil etc). Global trade fell off a cliff in March and has barely recovered so where are countries getting dollars? By buying bonds . This was the reason behind the DXY spike to over 100 in March and the reason why the FX central bank swap program was instituted by JPOW. So unless you see global trade rebounding strongly in the very near term ( pigs will fly ) bonds will continue to be bid extremely strongly at auction, supporting DXY. \n\n3b) DXY as has been pointed out is primarily dropping due to Euro strength ( which makes up about 65 percent of the Index). When DXY is compared to the Bloomberg trade weighted dollar index you'll see it hasn't dropped far at all and this makes sense (see 3a above). The Euro bullish trend, along with AUD/USD,GBP/USD and JPY/USD is unlikely to continue much further. Foreign central banks and governments for that matter will not allow the dollar to crater. We've already seen rumblings from the EU and JPY on this front as exports are already in a tenuous position. The last thing foreign companies need is a strong currency to hamper export sales. So I wouldn't bet against the FED, but I sure as shit wouldn't be getting against the ECB.\n\nSummary: I don't see this stimulus playing out on time or in full. Big money is pricing in either a delay or being scaled back substantially to meet Republican demands. I won't go into the specifics of the political theatre because quite frankly it doesn't matter. PM/ BONDS are are all the signalling device you need.\n\nHow I see this playing out: The stimulus bill will pass on few weeks after a substantial Rug pull, similar to the 2008 TARP fiasco. I would strongly recommend either holding cash or going long DXY while this plays out. Either buy the dip on GLD/SLV with leaps or go long TLT at like 180c.\n\nPositions : short MNQ 3 units at 10530 and 1 ES at 3220. Yeah got in a little early, wasn't expecting the tech earnings blowout but have the margin to hold. \n\nLooking at GLD leaps for 06/21 300c when we get a pullback ( due to margin calls ).",

        "selftext": "A post was made [earlier this week](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/i38k65/fed_tlt_buys_tuesthurs_guarantee_a_50125_return/) recommending people buy the August 7th 170 Call options on TLT.  TLT is a long-term Treasury ETF by iShares.\n\nAs you can see, the post has been removed, but the comments remain.  I think this is a good learning experience.\n\nThe poster and several others advocated the purchase of these options at $1.25.  That means $125 per contract which would give effective control of 100 shares of TLT.  The claim was that it was \"guaranteed money\" because the Fed announced it was buying bonds.  The strategy was to buy at the beginning of the week and hold until expiration date or shortly before.  Let's see how this played out:\n\nAs you can see in the comments, people were showing price charts and drawing lines on them claiming they had made money etc.  It's easy to pull up a chart and draw patterns after-the-fact.  But what happened with the price?\n\nWell yesterday the price of these options was around $1.25-$1.29 per contract.  That is around the same as it had been earlier in the week, which is a break-even or a loss in terms of opportunity.  But that's not the scary part.  As of right now, the price is 5 cents.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/U85P3VS\n\nThe strategy in this was to buy 25 Call options.  That would run around $3,200 at the price the time the post was made.  Right now selling these contracts would get you $125, which means the trade is a -$3,075 loss or so.  Wiped out completely.\n\nI kept asking for people to post up screenshots of their order fills (the buy and sell tickets) to show us that they made profitable trades and weren't just drawing lines on a chart.  They refused.  Guys, be careful.  Lots of people recommend shoddy advice or they oversimplify how options trades work.\n\nDo your due diligence, ask for some screenshots to see if they have any skin in the game.  A lot of times these guys aren't even making the trades, they are just doing a look-back and claiming they were in on the position.  Things aren't so simple as \"The Fed is buying bonds, I'm going in heavy on call options!\"  It's more complicated.\n\nLet this be a cautionary tale.  I feel sorry for the guys who actually followed this position in and who are now looking at some large red numbers.  I get downvoted a lot for being \"condescending\" and a lot of other descriptors.  But I actually do care about investors losing money to half-baked ideas and my commentary hopefully steers people away from stuff like this.  Because innocent guys with a lower account value will take advice and run with it and take food off their own family's table unknowingly.  That's who I'm trying to help.",

        "selftext": "Feeling really dumb and depressed this morning as I was margin called for 380k. Hoping for some advice. Here\u2019s the story:\n\n1) Sold 10x AAPL 375c 21Aug20 \n2) Bought 10x AAPL 380c 21Aug20\nThe credit spread was about $3,000 at the time (mid-July), and max loss therefore should have been $2,000. \n\nI believe the short position was ITM, and long was ATM at the time, although this is irrelevant. \n\nThis morning I received an email saying my short position was exercised (fuck me, I didn\u2019t realize ex-div for AAPL was today). I\u2019m assuming they exercised it yesterday to qualify for the upcoming dividend. My broker (Questrade in Canada) did nothing with my long position, so I\u2019ve gone from a max loss of $2,000 to a much steeper one. I don\u2019t know what to do.. \n\nQuestrade rep convinced me to exercise my long position and sell the shares upon receipt. However, the share price has dropped $10 already today, so my loss has likely gone from $2,000 to $12,000 and could get worse if this drop continues. I submitted the request to exercise the calls and I\u2019m waiting for the shares. \n\nI entered this trade assuming my max loss would be $2,000. I thought questrade would require direction for the long position, cause I don\u2019t have 380k to cover in my account. \n\nTLDR; entered what I thought was a covered credit position, to later be naked and forced into to a $380,000 long position.",

        "selftext": "\"I went through the same process that most people do. I subscribed to a few investment letters and most of them didn't do too well.\"\n\nThat's what William O'Neil, the legendary trader and author of \"How to Make Money in Stocks,\" told Jack Schwager in a 1989 interview for his classic \"Market Wizards\" series.\n\nOut of frustration, O'Neil took the matter into his own hands. He knew a better way to trade was out there \u2014 all he had to do was uncover it. After all, he was seeing an array of fund managers crush the competition.\n\n\"Back in 1959, I did a study of the people that were doing very well in the market,\" he said. \"At that time, the Dreyfus fund was a very small fund, managing only about $15 million. Jack Dreyfus, who managed the fund, was doubling the results of all his competitors.\"\n\nO'Neil scoured Dreyfus' quarterly reports, searching tirelessly for any commonalities he could apply to his own methodology. After mapping out more than 100 of Dreyfus' stock purchase points, O'Neil hit pay dirt.\n\n\"There were over 100 of these securities and when I laid them out on a table, I made my first real discovery: Not some, not most, but every single stock had been bought when it went to a new high price,\" he said.\n\nThat unearthing opened the flood gates. O'Neil knew there were more secrets waiting to be uncovered. \n\nThe search continued. \n\nO'Neil shifted his focus to the market's biggest winners, trying to connect the dots between the characteristics of certain stocks and their superior performance. Eventually, his research culminated in a simple seven-part model: CANSLIM.\n\nAllow O'Neil to explain:\n\n\"Each letter of this name represents one of the seven chief characteristics of the all-time great winning stocks during their early developing stages, just before they made huge advances,\" he said.\n\nO'Neil's discovery translated to massive profits.\n\n\"During 1962-63, by pyramiding the profits in three exceptional back-to-back trades \u2014 short Korvette, long Chrysler, and long Syntex \u2014 he managed to parlay an initial $5,000 investment into $200,000,\" Schwager said.\n\nLet's take a closer look at O'Neil's famed CANSLIM principles. All quotes below are from O'Neil.\n\nC: 'Current earnings per share'\n\n\"The 'C' stands for current earnings per share,\" he said. \"So, our first basic rule in stock selection is that quarterly earnings per share should be up by at least 20 to 50 percent year to year.\"\n\nA: 'Annual earnings per share'\n\n\"In our studies, the prior five-year average annual compounded earnings growth rate of outstanding performing stocks at their early emerging stage was 24%,\" he said. \"Ideally, each year's earnings per share should show an increase over the prior year's earnings.\"\n\nN - 'Something New'\n\n\"The 'new' can be a new product or service, a change in the industry, or new management,\" he said. \"In our research we found that 95 percent of the greatest winners had something new that fell within these categories.\"\n\nS - 'Shares outstanding'\n\n\"Ninety-five percent of the stocks that performed best in our studies had less than twenty-five million shares of capitalization during the period when they had their best performance,\" he said. \"Many institutional investors handicap themselves by restricting their purchases to only large-capitalization companies.\"\n\nL - 'Leader or laggard'\n\n\"So, another basic rule in stock selection is to pick the leading stocks \u2014 the ones with the high relative strength values \u2014 and avoid the laggard stocks,\" he said. \"I tend to restrict purchases to companies with relative strength ranks above 80.\"\n\nI - 'Institutional sponsorship'\n\n\"Leading stocks usually have institutional backing,\" he said. \"However, although some institutional sponsorship is desired, excessive sponsorship is not, because it would be a source of large selling if anything went wrong with the company or the market in general.\"\n\nM - 'Market'\n\n\"Three out of four stocks will go in the same direction as a significant move in the market averages,\" he said. \"That is why you need to learn how to interpret price and volume on a daily basis for signs that the market has topped.\"",

        "selftext": "  \n\nI was introduced to options in 2005. \n\nA co-worker of mine, who happened to be a 9/11 Truther before that was a term, was all hyped up on the upcoming ER for Amgen. He went around the office on a manic high, telling everyone to buy short term OTM call options - or as we refer to them around these parts, FDs. \n\nAs part of our retirement plans, we each had Fidelity brokerage accounts. To enable options trading, however, you had to call Fidelity and answer questions about your level of financial smarts and how much money you had. The correct answers were, of course \"genius level\" and \"shitloads.\" I answered truthfully. My other coworkers did not. They got to options trading enabled. I did not.\n\nAmgen beat and some of these guys landed 8 baggers. My own officemate made $50k and promptly took his family to Disneyland. As you can imagine, I was dismayed that I missed out.\n\nFor the next few months, chasing the next big trade was all the rage, and our team could hardly get anything done. I got my account upgraded by answering the questions correctly, but every play the group made after Amgen was a loser. Because I never had that thrill of victory, I quickly lost interest, but the temptation to recapture those initial gains captivated some of the other guys. As the losses racked up, the trading group got smaller and smaller, eventually distilling down to the most degenerate off talking in the corner, the crazy Truther mumbling his false prophesies to his last few disciples. I lost about $1000 \u2013 which was no small change at that time in my life \u2013 but I know that some of the guys lost a lot more chasing that high.\n\nThat\u2019s still better than the snake oil the retail investment crowd is selling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor any market at any given time, Boggleheads and r/investing will tell you to just keep putting money in, no matter how badly you are getting fucked.\n\n*\u201c7% YoY in the market!\u201d* \n\n*\u201cThe greatest force in the universe is compound interest!\u201d*\n\n*\u201cIf you hold for the long term, you don\u2019t have to worry about volatility!\u201d*\n\nHere\u2019s the cold truth: the life advice Boomers give out is fucking outdated, designed for an analog world created by a Greatest Generation that coddled them, and that includes their financial advice as well.\n\nI am from the \u201c[Oregon Trail Generation](https://socialmediaweek.org/blog/2015/04/oregon-trail-generation/)\u201d, the last slice of GenX that actually grew up with computers. We are the cohort that witnessed the death of the American Middle Class that the Internet Age and Globalization, entering the workforce just as the dot-com bubble finally put it out of its misery.\n\nWhen I was 3, my grandfather retired from Boeing after 35 years. They gave him a platinum plated set of draftsman\u2019s tools, a brass desk clock and a lifelong pension.\n\nWhen I was 19, my girlfriend\u2019s dad was a consultant for Boeing. His job was to dig up dirt on upcoming retirees so they could be fired to deprive them of that pension.\n\nI did the *thing,* that good old American Dream \u2013 marriage, house, car, kids. I did what the \u201cexperts\u201d tell you to do: save a slice of each paycheck for retirement, invest in a college plan, buy a house as a solid investment. \n\nHere I am barely middle-aged, and I have worked through three major financial crises since I entered the workforce.\n\nI\u2019ve chased a runaway housing market, lowering my parameters every month because the prices kept rising faster than I could make for a down payment.\n\nTwice, I have had my retirement account fleeced, then had to draw down what was left to keep a roof over my head - paying a penalty to do so. \n\nI have been so upside down on a mortgage I\u2019ve considered burning the house down.\n\nSo I am here to tell you firsthand that *Save, Buy, Hold and Diversify* will not help you when the whole market collapses and you find yourself in need of that money, that a house is just an investment that you can live in while it drops in value, and that *Dollar Cost Averaging* is another way of saying *Getting Cucked.*\n\nI say, if you are going to make or lose 50% in the next 10 years, you may as well make or lose that 50% in the next 10 *hours.* \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn some ways, younger Millennials and Zoomers are better equipped to face these facts than us older folks. If you came of age during the GFC or later, you understand that the game is rigged. All that bailout money is moving around the market while you are struggling to make minimum wage in the Uber Eats gig economy. Unlike those of us who grew up in more stable times, you know in your bones the halcyon days - the ones you've only ever heard about - about are never coming back. \n\nNot for everybody, at any rate.\n\nSo enters RobinHood, and it drives the financial pundits absolutely berserk. Who are these fucking kids YOLOing on HTZ? Don\u2019t they know they are supposed to be investing that money into a passive index fund, or even better, one of those retirement-date funds with the massive expense ratios? It\u2019s fucking up the game for the rest of us! \n\nI have traded options on and off for years in the hopes of making a little pocket money. Fact is, when commissions were $8-$20 per trade (plus a fee per contract), there was no way a small-time retail investor could participate meaningfully. With free or no commissions, the calculus has changed, lowering the bar of entry for smaller investors who can enter and exit a position at any time with only the bid-ask spread the main concern.\n\nBoomers created a monster, and they have only themselves to blame.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLike many of you, when March hit, I jumped in to puts and lost a bunch of money. This is because I was using an old way of thinking about options, the only one available to small-time retail traders just a few years ago: \u201cI hope that this security makes a huge break in a particular direction.\u201d \n\nAfter this loss and subsequent reflection, I determined that the money was there to be had, just that I was taking the wrong approach. I developed a new strategy, one that takes advantage of the simple fact that I can enter and exit a position without significant commission costs. I began to diversify my targets, and enter smaller positions on those targets, so that I didn\u2019t have everything riding on one or two plays. I developed exit strategies - and followed them! \u2013 so that I could take my wins or cut my losses quickly and move on to the next trade. \n\nAnd most importantly, I made it a point to withdraw my gains, if any, at the end of every week.\n\nSince April, I have executed no less than 20 trades per week if you count option expiry. In 15 weeks, I have doubled my account value. Not because of some one-off spectacular play or because I\u2019ve been a bull a bull market. In fact, I\u2019m a bear, but using a pretty neutral strategy. I doubled my money because I adapted to this new trading climate, found what works for me, and simply stuck to it.\n\nDo I think that makes me some some sort of fucking genius? Absolutely not. I\u2019ve made some smart, conservative plays that turned really goddamned sour. I\u2019ve made some truly retarded plays that turned out great. I\u2019ve had good weeks, bad weeks, and weeks that amounted to an incredibly stressful waste of time. I still make a bunch of mistakes - weekly, if not daily. \n\nI am still prepared \u2013 waiting, even \u2013 for my whole account to get wiped out due to a cacophony of bad plays. In the end, these are all gut decisions. Do I feel good about this? For each of them, only time reveals if I am right.\n\nBut if I have taken one thing away from what I have learned so far this year, it is this: *anybody can make rent money in the equities market now*. You do not have to have a massive account to overcome the burden of commissions, or have a huge investment in dividend stocks to realize a gains-based income. And thank God for that, because the job market is not going to save you.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know the gain porn here is enough to make a man drool, and the loss porn is enough to make his balls retract into his stomach. Just understand those are always one-sided directional plays. It\u2019s all-in on a single ticker, a true YOLO, not unlike putting it on black at the roulette table. It\u2019s easy to get caught up looking at the massive gains and get stars in your eyes.\n\nBut forget the lambo and the gold-plated yacht for a moment and consider something more immediate, such as: \u201ccould I pay this month\u2019s phone bill with my gains?\u201d With the money you can pare off into a brokerage account, is it possible to avoid spending the the money you make doing whatever it is you do for someone else and make your phone service \u201cfree\u201d?\n\nFor example, if you have $1000 and you make a reasonably conservative play with an exit strategy of $100 gain and $100 loss (such as a deep OTM 45DTE bull credit spread on a decent stock that\u2019s been beaten up recently, with a hard exit 21DTE), the likelihood is very high. It is not guaranteed \u2013 you may end up down $100 from where you started. But what *is* guaranteed is that you will have to spend 8 hours flipping burgers or whatever at $12.50 an hour to make that $100 if you don't. (Yes, I know, *taxes \u2013* the point still stands).\n\nWhen you finally get to take that $100 out and pay the phone bill with it, it becomes very, very real. \n\nImagine getting to a point where your trading gains pay for the things you *need*, so you can spend the money you earn with your blood sweat and tears on the things you *want.*\n\nThis is what it means to have a \u201cS.M.A.R.T.\u201d goal \u2013 small, measurable, achievable, realistic and time-sensitive. When you conform your efforts to translate into something small yet meaningful to your life, it changes the perspective.\n\nBut even if you decide to take your bi-weekly retirement contribution and YOLO it on MU FDs, you\u2019ve got just as much of a chance of coming ahead with that as you do giving it to Mr. Market to hold for the next 20 years.\n\nBoomers will tell you \u201cmost day traders lose money!\u201d First, \u201cday trader\u201d is a specific term. But that aside, it is also true most businesses fail in the first year. In both cases, people get burned, give up and go back to what they know. They fail to plan, they fail to learn from experience, and they fail to persevere. \n\nThis is not an appeal to \u201cnot be average\u201d nor to keep \u201cchasing bad money with good\u201d - just to keep trying. Set your goals, manage your risk, hone your successes, and learn from your failures.\n\nAt no other time in history has it been possible for the average Joe to participate in the equities market with so little friction as commission-free mobile trading, and with so much leverage as weekly options. I know, because I\u2019m old enough to remember when stock quotes were in the weekly paper, and they were registered in one-eighths of a dollar.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TL,DR; T**o Hell with the haters like Cramer and his ilk. Keep learning and growing and trying to rake in tendies. The lambo isn\u2019t the goal - *financial freedom* is. An Ally savings account and a shit job the boss is trying his damnedest to offshore ain\u2019t gonna get you there. We live in a Merchant Republic awash in wealth, and you have the right \u2013 the obligation, even - to participate. Go get your fucking slice.\n\nI love you retards.",

        "selftext": "You\u2019ve probably seen a rising trend of bullish posts about Nvidia recently, whether it\u2019s about recent acquisitions being included in revenue, its management, or the semiconductor industry in general.\n\nYesterday, Evening Standard reported that $NVDA has locked in a takeover of Arm Ltd. from SoftBank for a reported 40 billion.\n\nThe reason this is important is that Arm owns instructions-set architectures (ISAs) for the chips within nearly every smartphone, along with a handful of other products. Usually, this isn\u2019t an issue, since SoftBank would sell the rights to produce these chips to Apple, Qualcomm, and others for a fee. \n\n$NVDA, unlike SoftBank, is an actual semiconductor company. They could potentially limit access to their ISAs so that $NVDA can become the sole producer of those chips. Or, due to SoftBank being in the sinosphere and $NVDA being American, potential tensions could arise from the recent economic sanctions.\n\nEither way, considering that the deal is essentially locked in, $NVDA is flying straight to tendie town. Arm is a powerful player in the semiconductor industry, and its acquisition by $NVDA demonstrates that the company is making big moves to become more prevalent. $NVDA could theoretically lockdown a subsector of the semiconductor market by restricting access to chips under Arm\u2019s ISA. And if the Don requests $NVDA restrict Chinese access to the ISAs, you can bet that it will get a fucking BOATLOAD of government subsidies.\n\nTL;DR $NVDA 520c 9/18",

        "selftext": "Silver (SLV) and Gold (GLD) have both had incredible rallies over the last three months. This has been driven mainly by uncertainty hedges and currency hedges (people worried about the world and people worried about the dollar). While the state of the world is definitely reason enough to jump into safe haven materials, Gold and Silver are both inexorably linked to the strength of the dollar. **AS LONG AS THE DOLLAR KEEPS CRASHING GOLD AND SILVER WILL RALLY.** \n\nFirst we need to talk about why the dollar will continue to crash and to what levels it will fall. The Dollar's strength is linked to (basically) two things: (1) Supply and (2) Demand. While other factors can move the dollar in the short-term, over long-term trends these two basic economic principles are responsible for the dollar's value. \n\n1. Supply: The Fed is printing shit ton of money. Like a shit ton of money. The Fed balance sheet has expanded to over $7 Trillion, and it's likely to go higher over the next year. This is because our economy is fueled by debt, and in order to pay back that debt, the Fed is forced to print more and purchase assets, so people/companies don't default on their obligations. This creates a sort of Zombie economy (kinda like what we had from 2008-2020) where the stock market soars, but the income gap gets larger. I don't want to get into any of that, but the point is the Fed is going to keep printing, because it's the only way to keep people from defaulting. If people are allowed to default on their obligations, we'll have a major financial crisis (like 2008). \n2. Consequences: The consequences of all this printing is that eventually it will devalue our currency. That being said, we're in no danger of inflation in the short-term. Because the economy is so in the shitter, we have massive deflationary forces, so printing money outright (increasing money supply) isn't going to devalue the dollar. Instead, the dollar will become devalued for reason number 2...\n3. Demand: The Fed is buying bonds and keeping interests rates at zero. This essentially guarantees the stock market wont crash and encourages people to borrow. It also means that fixed-income investments will basically yield nothing. So, where can people put their money?\n4. Consequences: The only real place is the stock market or futures market. With incredibly low marginal costs (borrowing money is cheap), the Fed has given the green light for people to speculate and buy equities. **This forces people out of Cash and into Stocks; therefore, demand for the dollar falls.**\n5. Putting this all together: With the long-term fear that money printing will devalue the currency, and the short-term pressure to get out of cash and into the market (not to mention economic uncertainty, credit worthiness, pandemic fears, and election nonsense) we get a perfect storm of dollar weakness. So how does this all look:\n\nThis is a graph of the Dollar Index (DXY) over the last 3-months:\n\n[DXY Index](https://preview.redd.it/zm8v2a7b22f51.png?width=961&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=730be8b6938dc27ef6408d94f512785e1ed55e9e)\n\nThe dollar has depreciated nearly 7%. This has led to the meteoric rise in Gold and Silver over the same time frame.\n\nGLD:\n\n[GLD Index](https://preview.redd.it/um7rmu9r22f51.png?width=965&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=86c9876ab4439bd8b5ae8c8bdfdae0f914d85338)\n\nGLD has increased nearly 20%, breaking through its all time high of $185 (2011).\n\nSLV:\n\n[SLV Index](https://preview.redd.it/clxdj4vs22f51.png?width=959&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ae01448381860e30c993b482714493e472b66d68)\n\n SLV has increased over 33% from its local high of $18 (2019).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhile these movements might look crazy and might make you think you've missed the train, you're wrong. Gold and Silver (especially Silver) have a lot more room to run. This is because the dollar still has a long way to go down. \n\n[DXY Long-Term Look](https://preview.redd.it/rensqvn842f51.png?width=1314&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=caad130adc90bf7d0f7e78ea259b2a76df8b610d)\n\nIn 2018 the DXY hit \\~$89 and currently it's sitting at $93.35, so in just the short-term it's likely to retest that low. That represents another \\~4.6% decline in the dollar. The 7% decline in the DXY so far has created a 20% rally in GLD and a 30%+ rally in SLV, so just off the likely movement of the Dollar, GLD and SLV should rally an additional \\~14% and \\~20% respectively (if they follow the same ratio of movement). However, in the medium-term, the Dollar will likely trend even lower. The next levels of support are $80 and $73 which get us into 2008/2011 territory. The amount of stimulus and printing being put into the market today is a lot bigger than it was back then, so I wouldn't be surprised if we went back down to those levels.  \n\nFinally, how will Gold and Silver rally given this trend in the Dollar. Well, GLD already took out its ATH of $185 (2011). The Dollar still has a long way to go down, and people are just starting to pay attention to GLD again, so we might easily see GLD reaching $295 by end of 2021. In the last GLD rally the metal moved up 2.69 times in 3-years. Currently, we've only seen the metal rally 69% (heh) over the last \\~2-years. Based on the historical comparison, GLD should easily hit $220 by EOY. I have no doubt there could be a pullback, but given the fact that we're entering a pivotal election, I think GLD will rally at least until the election. \n\n[GLD 2008-2011](https://preview.redd.it/gsbe3vmj82f51.png?width=1461&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bd79832f785bf0406b169e75267be256ba3d0f1b)\n\n[GLD 2018-Today](https://preview.redd.it/efv3x2wl82f51.png?width=1462&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e3bc94e48eadd64159dd71435e2930d32a3202ea)\n\nSilver is even more exciting. Looking at historical charts of SLV we see that the metal hit a high of $48 in 2011. In the 1980's it went even higher, hitting a record $118. The current price is $24, which means if it retests it's 2008 high's, you can still get a 100% gain from the current price. **I am willing to bet my mother's kidney's on the fact that SLV will hit $30 by EOY.** I'm also pretty confident that it will retest it's local high of $48 sometime in 2021. The best part is, the options on SLV are so fucking cheap it'll make you cream a river of tendies. \n\n[SLV 2008-Today](https://preview.redd.it/ufntjwg2a2f51.png?width=1445&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e9c70b130c17d7bbd4076e4e0c42d97361e93ec9)\n\nBoy's I cant stress this enough. Silver and Gold are only just beginning to rally, and there's a really really really good chance SLV goes parabolic. GLD is a much safer bet if you're trying to buy options (just cause of liquidity and size) but the upside potential of SLV is crazy good. Don't miss this shit. It's the easiest money you'll ever make outside of AMZN calls. \n\nKeep buying GLD until it hits around $295 (after that the historical move doesn't hold) and keep buying SLV until $50. For both SLV and GLD that could take between 6-months to 1-year. \n\nTL:DR\n\nGLD Vertical Spread 191/193 September 30th  Expiration.\n\nSLV Vertical Spread 27.5/29 October 16th Expiration.",

        "selftext": "\\#Introduction\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHi all, it's your friendly neighborhood Tatar Sauce here with the first episode of my Options series. My hope is to help some of you autistic fucks to not blow up your accounts and learn to manage risk better. Each week I will be touching on a new topic that will hopefully help some of you understand the intricacies of options trading, with each lesson building upon previous lessons. Some topics will include different options strategies, risk/reward balance, and the psychology of trading. If you want me to touch on a particular topic, leave a comment below. If you want to call me a retard, leave a comment below.\n\nI do not sell a program or anything like that, I'm just a dude that loves trading and managing an account.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo lets get into it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nImagine you just read some retarded DD on WSB. You're convinced that OP has shown you the way to Tendie Town, and all thats left for you to do is hop on your PRPL mattress, punch in a few coordinates, go to bed and wake up swimming in a sea of hunny mussy. Like most retards on this sub, you probably have a loose understanding of the Greeks and don't know the difference between a horizontal spread and that gesture your wife does when you invite your buddy C-Note over for poker. So what are your options? Naked calls baby!\n\nWell, I'm here to tell you that while naked calls do have a time and a place, it shouldn't be your go to. If you were one of the autistic fucks posting loss porn because you bought a bunch of naked calls on PRPL, you need this more than anyone. So buckle up, grab a whisky, and let ME lead you to Tendie Town (no mattress required).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\#**So what do I do now?**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nVertical spreads baby. Next week we will dive deep into why vertical spreads offer a better risk/reward profile, but first we need to understand the Greeks and what they mean for your option contract. So lets dig in.  \n\n\n\\#**Delta**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Contrary to popular belief, delta does NOT mean the percent chance your option will expire ITM.** Delta is simply the amount of money your contract will move in accordance to every dollar the underling moves. In other words, if you bought your call for $2.00 with a .3 delta. and the price moves up $1, it is now worth $2.30. Conversely, if it moves down $1, it is worth $1.70. This is a simplistic way of looking at it, as other things can affect delta such as fundamentals and volatility, but that is what it means.  \n\n\nDelta is affected most by how close the strike price is to the current price of the underling. Farther OTM options have less delta, farther ITM options have more, and ATM is typically around .5. Delta is not heavily affected by DTE. Knowing delta is important in measuring risk/reward because it will tell you how much the value the option will move for or against you as the underling moves.  \n\n\n**#Gamma**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**If delta is the speed in which the price moves, gamma is the acceleration.** What gamma measures is how much delta changes after each subsequent dollar change. Here is an example to illustrate:  \n\n\n\\&gt; Buy option XYZ 50c with .3 delta and .01 gamma for $2.00\n\n\\&gt; Price moves up $1\n\n\\&gt; Call is worth $2.30, new delta value is now .31\n\n(Now lets say gamma was .15)\n\n\\&gt; Buy option XYZ 50c with .3 delta and .15 gamma for $2.00\n\n\\&gt; Price moves up another $1\n\n\\&gt; Call is worth $2.30, new delta is .45\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy example is again a simplistic way of looking at it, but don't miss the point- gamma will accelerate the price change in your option as the underling changes and is a important factor in determining risk/reward.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUnlike delta, gamma is heavily affected by DTE, and gamma increases by a lot as you get closer to expiry, and is much smaller the farther out you buy. It is not affected heavily by how ITM or OTM the option is (although there is a slight increase the closer you get to ATM).  \n\n\nThink of FD's as purchasing gamma, where a large move in your favor will yield exponential returns.  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**#Theta**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Think of theta as the amount of money you have to spend per day to hold the contract, or the amount you get paid per day to sell one.** I like to think of theta as \"how much money I will lose per day if the underling trades sideways.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTheta is increased as you get closer to your expiry date. At about 30 DTE, theta begins to accelerate  faster. ATM strikes tend to have the most theta, where ITM strikes have enough intrinsic value that they arent affected as much and OTM strikes go for less premium so there is less value to eat.  \n\n\nI don't think you autistic fucks are dumb enough to need an example for this one. Most of you hold your contracts too long and know what theta burn is. NEXT!  \n\n\n**#Vega**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Vega is the amount the underling moves in response to a 1% change in IV.** This is the reason behind the term \"IV crush.\" Vega is greater the farther out you purchase your option, and greater the closer it is to being ATM (while OTM options have a slightly higher vega than ITM, it's not by much).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI cannot stress this enough, **look at the vega and IV rank of the options you are buying if you want to play earnings!**  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIV rank takes the past 52 weeks of IV for the ticker and tells you what percentile its current IV is at.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHigh IV rank and vega is inherently more risky REGARDLESS of what the underling does! I'm tired of seeing you retards weeble wobble your way through posts asking why the fuck your option went down when the price moved in your favor. It's because you're retarded and don't know what you're doing.  \n\n\nHowever, vega can play in your favor if volatility increases. This can be a shrewd play if you catch a ticker a couple weeks before earning.  \n\n\n**#What about Rho?**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRho stands for red-headed orphan. Nobody cares about rho.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**#The different type of plays you can make using the Greeks**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Believe it or not, there are more ways to play with options then \"hurr durr stonks go up.\"** Here are a few things you can do to leverage yourself and use each Greek to your advantage:  \n\n\nDelta: Purchasing delta is similar exposure to purchasing 100 shares of the underling, but for far less money and risk. It can be a great way to leverage yourself if you are looking to purchase the shares anyway and are okay paying the extra premium for the increased gains. IMO, this is a boomer play that someone makes if they don't want to tie up the capital short term but want the option to exercise long term. For example, AAPL 400c 1/15/21 goes for \\~$111. That is about 1/5 less money then purchasing 100 shares today and AAPL only has to go up like 13 bucks to break even. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGamma: Purchasing gamma is the thought behind an FD. Low risk, high reward, low chance of profit. The WSB special. I will try to get a day trade in every now and then if I see an opportunity, where I put a tight stop loss on and let it ride. **If you do this, look at the theta and set your stop loss at least that distance away from your purchase price so you don't get stopped out due to theta burn.**  \n\n\nTheta: You don't buy theta. You sell theta. Join r/thetagang for more info.  \n\n\nVega:  If you want to play the volatility of a stock, consider buying or selling vega. Some people use straddles a few weeks before earnings and capitalize on the increased volatility to increase their odds of success when they might not be sure how the market will respond to the earnings. Keep in mind that you will have to put up more premium for farther out DTE options, but if volatility goes up you would be surprised how much it will make your options move.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo thats that. Learning the Greeks and learning what you're buying will help keep you from making a lot of rookie mistakes. Next week, I'm going to talk about spreads and why they offer a better risk/reward profile then naked options.  \n\n\n**TLDR:** Stop gambling and start trading.  \n\n\n**Positions:** DKNG 33/34/38/39 Iron Condor 8/28 - PENN 54p 8/28 - VXX 25/26c 8/28 Debit - AAPL 500/520c 9/4 Debit - RKT 27c 9/18 - RKT 26/30c 9/18 Debit - XRX 22c 9/18 - MU 42.5/47.5c 9/18 Debit - AAPL 560/580c 9/18 Debit - SPY 330/320p 9/25 Debit",

        "selftext": "A data scientist here. Recently developed a tool that analyzes options flow from the entire day to make short term predictions of 1-5 days. Wanted to share some of the alerts for the next week with you folks. Please let me know if this is something that everyone likes here and if I should continue it.\n\nThe tool is still new so please be careful with all the alerts. **I would recommend paper trading these for a few days and doing your own DD as well**.  The overall accuracy is around 60-70% which means it can make mistakes. Happy to talk more about how the tool works.\n\nBullish means the stock is expected to move up more than 1% from the  current  close at least 1 day in the next 1-5 days. Bearish means  the stock is expected to stay the same or go low in the next few  days. The definitions are a bit loose but the stock usually makes a decent amount in reality.\n\n# Bullish Alerts\n\n**$BABA**   \\- Bullish probability of 84.3%. This fell right at the 50 moving   average which usually acts as a support for a stock in uptrend ([https://i.imgur.com/zHVQEAV.png](https://i.imgur.com/zHVQEAV.png)).\n\n**$CHWY**   \\- Bullish probability of 75.1%. Again, a beautiful setup especially if   it falls on the support at $52 and starts to bounce back ([https://i.imgur.com/87PRrBI.png](https://i.imgur.com/87PRrBI.png))\n\n**$MSFT** \\- Bullish probability of 71.0%. As long as this stays above the support of $210, this is a good setup ([https://i.imgur.com/ap3wpn1.png](https://i.imgur.com/ap3wpn1.png)). Otherwise, it might fall down hard because of the gap.\n\n**$TWLO**   \\- Bullish probability of 67.2%. This is only a decent setup if it  stays  above the support of $245. Bad setup otherwise. However, the tool  is  bullish, so I have got to go with that. ([https://i.imgur.com/mBjDqeT.png](https://i.imgur.com/mBjDqeT.png))\n\n# Bearish Alerts\n\n**$SPCE**   \\- Bearish probability of 88%. This was predicted to be bearish about a   week ago and it has gone down a lot. Continue downward trend if it can   break the support at $17 ([https://i.imgur.com/jwH4yyu.png](https://i.imgur.com/jwH4yyu.png)) ([https://i.imgur.com/78hHgpw.png](https://i.imgur.com/78hHgpw.png))\n\n**$AAL** \\- Bearish probability of 87.5%. I **would be careful**   with this setup since the price  is forming a bullish triangle. If it   breaks the 13$ level, get out immediately as that is a good resistance   level ([https://i.imgur.com/vCnsdc9.png](https://i.imgur.com/vCnsdc9.png))\n\n**$SRNE**   \\- Bearish probability of 86.9%. This is the third alert from the tool   and I've failed twice with this alert. So I would encourage you not to   follow this. But I trust the tool and I think this is going to get down   at some time.\n\n**$JPM** \\- Bearish probability of 85.3%. This is a good setup if it touches the resistance and comes back from $99.7 level ([https://i.imgur.com/RCEvRes.png](https://i.imgur.com/RCEvRes.png))\n\n**If you don't like these alerts, please don't be a hater, just ignore them. They are not perfect and I know that.** \n\nHappy to chat more about how everything works. Please do let me know if this is something folks here would want on daily basis.

        "selftext": "Hello fellow degenerates. \n\n I know there has been 6 billion posts about silver, but none of them so far have addressed the unusually large number of open contracts for September. Most of them have just been money printer go BRRRR = inflation = silver go moon. So here's a fun little argument of why silver might enter the stratosphere faster than a hooker in light up sketchers during September. \n\nLike I said, the current open interest for silver September contracts is NUTTY\n\n[COMEX Silver Futures](https://preview.redd.it/772mapunqug51.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0e0b944dbbc70766eb70b90692f105d7c1edc7dd)\n\nEach contract represents 5,000 ounces of silver. Now, most of the time only a small portion of these contracts stand for delivery, say 1 or 2% amounting to \\~4 to 9 million ounces of silver. Back in July, an astonishing 17,294 contacts stood for delivery amounting to 86,470,000 ounces of the devils metal. For those of you that can't count, just understand that is a lot. \n\n[Silver Contacts standing for Delivery](https://preview.redd.it/901urvyarug51.png?width=648&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a83e739ffcc3996b381f67177a89c91a3c012f45)\n\nIf something similar happens in September, we might be looking at a similar number or more of silver ounces being delivered. So the question is, how much do the banks have? Glad you asked young autist.\n\n[COMEX - Registered and Eligible Silver in ounces.](https://preview.redd.it/bsdee47rrug51.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bb1cc36d27e3da9a3834549ba95b23a202050b07)\n\n As of today, there sits a total of roughly 335 million ounces of silver at the Comex across all the big boy banks. \\~128 million of that is registered for delivery, meaning can be used to cover short position and stand for delivery. The other \\~208 million sits eligible, meaning it meets the exchange requirements and COULD be moved over to registered if desired. Funny thing is, a lot of the banks have been moving their silver from eligible to registered in the past couple months, wonder why. For fun, here are the current standings for JPMorgan and The Bank of Nova Scotia.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/k5f3ovl1sug51.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=be44c4e4bf3c6f1359ce828efab40ef162c413e2\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xu98xvv4sug51.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1b624a4a89126f4f5ebb1019347b3969be10feea\n\nJPMorgan has \\~33.8 million ounces eligible, and \\~131 million registered, while the bank of nova scotia has \\~15 million registered, and 6.5 million eligible. Now what happens when a bank holds a net short position and the longs stand for delivery? Well, good things for the price of silver, bad things for the bank depending on how much they actually have in the comex. \n\nSo what does all this mean? This is probably going to play out either one of two ways: \n\n1. A large amount of contracts will stand for delivery such as in July. If its enough, maybe some of the big banks who have short positions might find themselves in hot water with their silver delivery amounts.  Basically, if enough longs stand for delivery, the amount of silver available to the market goes down = price goes up. \n\n2. Few of the contacts stand for delivery. This is the bear case, if this happens, you better hope your bet on silver being a hedge for inflation is right boys. \n\nTLDR; Huuuge open interest on September silver contracts. If enough stand for delivery you might be able to move out of your wifes boyfriends basement and afford health care. \n\nSLV 9/30 27C &amp; SLV 12/31 30C",

        "selftext": "You might want to say: \"Retard, there have been at least a dozen posts about RKT already.\" Well, there is some itsy bitsy tiny bit of new information...\n\n# Hold on to your butts \ud83d\ude80\n\nYes, you might have seen the stock price climb to \\~$26 after IPO and fall back to $19 and not listened to [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/i8g3bq/buying_the_rkt_dip_is_an_absolute_nobrainer/) brilliant retard telling you not to sell GODDAM stock. Maybe because you have read the \"sEeKinG alPhA aNaLysT\" giving it a \"meh\" rating.\n\nWell, in an effort to give you another chance on those sweet tendies, Rocket announced pre-earnings numbers, before the actual earnings date of September 2. This is what it looks like:\n\n* Quarterly earnings are up by 125% from the previous year with quarterly revenue of $5.31 billion. On an adjusted basis revenue is up by 300% over last year. The full report is [here](https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/rocket-comapanies-nyse-rkt-tries-to-lift-off-after-earnings-update/).\n* Adjusted net income is  $2.8 billion, which is an increase of $2.2 billion compared to the first quarter of 2020 and $2.6 billion compared to the second quarter of 2019. For the accountants among you, the full set of numbers are [here](https://www.streetinsider.com/Corporate+News/Rocket+Companies+%28RKT%29+Reports+Prelim.+Q2+Revenue+of+%245+Billion/17243861.html).\n* To put numbers into perspective this is a company with $2.4 billion float according to Google.\n* The stock was up 11.22% today and trading at around $23.8 at market close.\n\n# What does this all mean?\n\n* This is the parent company of Quicken Loans, it is essentially a FinTec company for mortgage refinancing, etc. Some argue that it is actually a tech company. They handle pretty much everything electronically via their website and app. This is important because of COVID-19. According to online [reviews](https://www.nerdwallet.com/reviews/mortgages/rocket-mortgage), they have one of the best-streamlined and user-friendly interfaces.  You can do pretty much everything regarding financing your home without having to sit a crowded office in your facemask.\n* Because of how user-friendly their apps are, they have sweet sweet margins: \"Who is going to do DD on home mortgages when you can do everything on an app. Am I right?\"\n* Interest rates are extremely low due to Fed intervention and it is to remain low for a very long while. Remember the famous [quote](https://www.fxstreet.com/analysis/fed-chairman-were-not-even-thinking-about-thinking-about-raising-rates-202006151341) from our lord and savior JPow: \"We're not thinking about raising rates, we're not even thinking about thinking about raising rates.\" For this reason, everyone and their mum are doing refinancing, buying homes, etc.\n* With a float of $2.4 billion, the company can have VERY significant price changes in a short time.\n* RKT is the ultimate meme ticker. \"RKT to the moon \ud83d\ude80\" and \"REKT \ud83d\udd25\" memes will keep us entertained for years to come while providing free advertisement for the company.\n* This is basically TurboTax of mortgages which is a [multi-trillion dollar market](https://www.lendingtree.com/home/mortgage/u-s-mortgage-market-statistics-2019/).\n\n# FAQ for \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b\n\nQ: But what if the interest rates go back up tomorrow?\n\nA: It won't, as that would collapse the S&amp;P 500 overnight. They have to keep interest rates low so that the money stays in the stock market.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nQ: This sounds like the next subprime mortgage crisis. What if people start defaulting on their mortgages?\n\nA: They are not the ones lending the money, so they don't care. They package the mortgages and hand it to someone else. They keep mortgages for only 3 weeks on average during the process, then they are off the hook.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nQ: Aren't there other mortgage companies with online services?\n\nA: Yes, but nothing this streamlined and easy to use. And they have very good brand recognition with the Rocket brand and Quicken Loans. Again, it is like TurboTax: yes there is other tax software out there, but who cares?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nQ: But the stock price does not reflect the fundamentals. Didn't it crash last week and then stall?\n\nA: Yes there was some price discovery after IPO and you would have been right up until Monday of this week. But since the pre-earnings announcement, the stock price is picking up some serious steam. Once the mainstream media catches on and price exceeds the ATH (probably tomorrow), this will go to the moon. If this does not look like a RKT platform I do not know what does:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lyevy8wx6bi51.png?width=1260&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=10da2d7c8be7d4a83c0b798c16aafaa94bacfc20\n\n# The Play\n\nJust stop reading and load up the cart already.",
