        "selftext": "&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Introduction**\n\nOf the many forces of society, the advancement of technology is one that is truly unstoppable. From how we obtain information to how people communicate from a distance, technology has changed the way people live their lives. The service providers of our everyday lives are consistently looking for ways to automate &amp; improve their offerings/operations. This created a market and demand for Amdocs Limited (Nasdaq: DOX), a technology and software product/service (such as consulting) provider that serves companies in communications, media, finance, entertainment, digital, etc.\n\n**Company Overview**\n\nEstablished in 1982 In Israel, Amdocs Limited is a multinational software company headquartered in Missouri, US. For 40 years, Amdocs has been offering advanced software products and related technology services to optimize their clients\u2019 operations. With 26,000 employees, Amdocs is currently in business with 350 service providers in more than 80 countries. Their clientele comprised of leaders in a wide range of industries: telecom giants AT&amp;T &amp; Bell, financial institutions like HSBC, and general crowd favorites such as Amazon, 7Eleven, and Microsoft.\n\nMost of Amdocs\u2019 offerings are provided within \u201camdocsONE\u201d, a comprehensive collection of products/services consisting of: Digital Experience &amp; Monetization; Media &amp; Digital Services; Enterprise &amp; Connected Society; Open Cloud Networks &amp; NGOSS; Services &amp; Hybrid Operations; Technology &amp; Practices-Driven Innovation. With its \u201ccloud-native, modular and open offerings\u201d, Amdocs helps clients smoothly and fully transition into tech-automated, digital operations.\n\nIn such a demanded market with high-ticket clients, Amdocs recorded $4.16B in revenue during FY2020 (ended September 30th, 2020), at a 33.9% Gross Margin, 19% EBITDA Margin, and 11.9% Net Profit Margin. DOX also has consistently growing Operating Cash Flow, recording $910.7M in the Last-Twelve-Months ending in December of 2020.\n\nYes, everything seems to be working out well for DOX, but that brings up the question: is there still room to grow, or has DOX plateaued, making it a safe bet, but not a high-return investment?\n\n**Capital Structure &amp; Shareholders Breakdown**\n\nA quick look at Amdocs\u2019 capital structure: **22% Debt, 77.1% Common Equity, 0.9% Minority Interest.** What is important to point out here is that DOX has **recorded $0 in debt** for 3 straight years from FY2017-19. This is a very uncommon occurrence for a company to be 0% leveraged. In contrast, most of its competitors are operating around the 15%-25% debt/total capital ratio, comparable companies like Akamai Technologies recording \\~40% leverage in its capital structure.\u00a0\n\nWhen it comes the shareholders of DOX, most of its outstanding shares are owned by institutional holders. Traditional portfolio managers such as asset manager firms are the biggest investors, with FMR LLC. as the largest holder. The large scale and consistent (holds &amp; buys) asset management investment shows street professionals see DOX as a profitable, stable investment.\n\n**Looking Long**\n\nOverall, I believe DOX shows potential at a hold/buy for long positions if you are looking to invest in an undervalued, but experienced &amp; matured company.\u00a0 The following are three main theses behind a long investment in DOX:\n\n* **Strong &amp; Consistent Financial Performance:**\n\nAs an established company, we are seeing highly predictable topline growth rate with consistent profit margins. Although these no longer large-scale increases we would see on a growing tech company, DOX\u2019s consistency and strong performance is definitely a supporting factor when it comes to investment. In more detail, DOX has a 2.9% top-line 5-year CAGR as of December 31st, 2020, with corresponding 3%, 3.6%, and 10.4% 5-year CAGR with EBITDA, EBIT, and Net Income, respectively. Although top-line growth was contracting a few years prior, it has rebounded between 2015-20, which could be contributed to the increasing number of companies transitioning into digital operations/cloud systems. Nevertheless, the higher (and increasing) bottom-line CAGRs means the company is still consistently increasing its profit margins (it is important to point out in that 5Y Net Income CAGR as of Dec.31st 2020 is significantly higher than previous years, which were around 2.2%-5.3%). DOX also has a strong cash flow, largely due to steady increases in operating cash flow. The OP cash flow is the best indicator here as unlevered free cash flow has seen some small-scale turbulence in recent years due to M&amp;As such as the acquisition of Openet Telecom, Juganu Ltd., and Veego during CY2020. Overall, DOX is a strong investment from the financial perspective due to its margin growth and consistency.\n\n* **Deep Product Portfolio with Wide Coverage**\n\nThrough \u201camdocsONE\u201d, Amdocs is able to provide a full-suite of comprehensive products/services that covers every stage of digital transformation. From cutting 80% of time-to-market when utilizing Amdocs bundle offers, to continuous operational support and open tools/cloud platforms, clients receive a thorough service when working with Amdocs. Within the six main categories of offerings mention above (Digital Experience &amp; Monetization; Media &amp; Digital Services; Enterprise &amp; Connected Society; Open Cloud Networks &amp; NGOSS; Services &amp; Hybrid Operations; Technology &amp; Practices-Driven Innovation), there are numerous individual products that allows users to customize their usage of the Amdocs\u2019 platform and offerings. For example, CES20 is Amdocs\u2019 cloud-based customer experience suite. Within CES20, there are 4 products that helps automate and digitize the users\u2019 operations: DigitalONE, CatalogONE, RevenueONE, and Service &amp; Network Automation. DigitalONE is a cloud-based system that allows users to work on their branding and customer experience. CatalogONE is an open-cloud platform catalog solution that allows users to launch new products easily with a detailed user interface. RevenueONE is a platform that allows users to scale or acquire new revenue stream while limiting the cost of acquisition. Last, Service &amp; network Automation is a branch covered by amdocsNEO. AmdocsNEO is a service &amp; network automation platform that offers a wide range of tracking and management capabilities. It is used to drive and control the fast automation process of the company. The CES20 is just an example of how Amdocs products are often interconnected and deeply comprehensive. They also offer certain platforms or products/services that are industry specific.\n\nThe wide coverage of the Amdocs offerings means they can gain market penetration across numerous industries. At the same time, the stage-specific offerings allow Amdocs to stay in demand and relevant as clients transition and grow. This plays a huge part into client retainment.\n\nLast, the continuous innovation initiatives at Amdocs supports an investment as it shows the company is consistently trying to grow and improve itself. As a tech company, it is extremely dangerous to slack-off on innovation, which is often seen with tech firms that reaches a consistent profit margin. Being in the tech industry means you live and die by the creativity and uniqueness of the offerings. Amdocs is consistently investing \\~20% of their gross profit into R&amp;D. This shows the company\u2019s dedication to innovation, which ensures that it will remain in demand in the future.\n\n* **Extremely Low Leverage**\n\nThe last thesis is quite a short and simple one: the low leverage of the company means reduced risks and limits debt-related expenses such as interest/principal payments, which in turn increases their profitability. As mentioned above, there has be several years where the company literally at $0 in debt. During FY2020, the company took on \\~$1B worth of debt, which could mean they are preparing for large scale development as from a financial standpoint, they are not in a situation where taking the extra cash is worth the liability. With that being said, the new debt is only 22% of the company\u2019s overall capital structure, and they will have no problem paying off the related fees as they have a strong track-record of positive cash flow.\n\n**Macro Market Trends**\n\nThe overall demand for digital/automation transformation/operations creates numerous trends that can positively impact the future of DOX. With the COVID-19 pandemic, company were pushed by the circumstances to digitize their operations, which will expand the market as well as create higher demand for the future. Here are some top trends that will impact DOX\u2019s performance:\n\n* **Overall Growth of the SaaS Market:**  \n\n   * has been consistent growth in the past decade in the SaaS market. This is driven by multiple factors including the automation of internal control, enterprise centre processing system, as well as the boom of 5G and cloud-based services. Looking into the future, for the period of 2019-23, the worldwide SaaS market is expected to reach a $60.36B valuation, recording a 9% CAGR over that period.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/re0rwefjhhy61.png?width=581&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3e03058110bfbf707b168afd09bdda586914a7db\n\n* **Lasting Impacts of COVID-19:**  \n\n   * The pandemic has already significantly accelerated the digitization rate due to the lockdowns and remote working environments. This is not a one-time catalyst, but rather a preview of what was going to happen in the future regardless; the pandemic situation has simply brought the future quicker. Going cloud or digitizing is not a temporary decision, this means the market has permanently expanded, and will continue to grow as demand increases.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/78jymbukhhy61.png?width=601&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d0362d3fb6c918222d0ffb49fff1132dadea2686\n\n* **5G Penetration &amp; Advancements**  \n\n   * Continuous developments in 5G technology will impact the SaaS industry in two ways:\n\n1. It will increase the accessibility of cloud-platforms and related services, thus increasing demand.\n2. It will improve the quality and range of capabilities for the products/services of software companies.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zcswsxwlhhy61.png?width=580&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f3c6560ebdcf519a5bbed1bdc42acc3c298571bc\n\nIn the modern society, it seems like life is limited if you have bad Wi-Fi connection. That is emphasized in the world of SaaS. Broader bandwidth and connection qualities will incentivize potential customers to digitalise and help service providers create higher quality products.\n\n**Financials and Valuations**\n\nWhen it comes to the fair valuation of Amdocs Limited (DOX), I used both comparable companies and intrinsic valuations, then weighted the price outcomes for the final target price. Instead, I evaluated the company using a basic comparable analysis. The companies included in the comparable universe are Akamai Technologies Inc. (AKAM), Ciena Corporation (CIEN), Citrix Systems (CTXS), Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp. (CTSH), and Perspecta Inc. (PRSP). The DCF valuation is relative crude with simple margin and top-line forecasts, but the results seem very reasonable and in-line with street estimates.\n\n**Risks**\n\nTo finish off this analysis on DOX, there are a few key risks to keep in mind:\n\n* **Cyber Security**\n\nAlthough moving operations towards cloud or digital platforms will increase efficiency and limit costs, it does come with security risks. By nature of public, integrated, and/or connected cloud platforms or enterprise central systems, a large quantity of information can be easily accessed in one spot. Although that makes operations easier, it also increases the impact of hacks or other cyber security concerns. In these interconnected platforms, large amounts of information are at risks once the \u201cfirst door\u201d is opened. Hackers no longer need to crack multiple systems to acquire different information such as customer information and financials. If Amdocs gets hacked, it will likely be very detrimental to the company as large quantity of information will be exposed.\n\n* **Limited Innovation or Growth due to Lack of 5G or Internet Penetration**\n\nFor Amdocs and the entire SaaS industry, poor internet infrastructure will limit growth potential and market penetration. If 5G usage and general internet coverage does not match the rate of innovation of Amdocs, revenue growth will stall, which might impact the pricing of the stock. It will also limit the room for innovation and enhancement, which allows more time for competitors to grow within the current infrastructure and increase the competition.\n\n**In the End: Buy, Hold, or Sell?**\n\nOverall, I think Amdocs Limited (DOX) is currently undervalued. In general, the street has a buy or hold/buy valuation on the current price, which I do agree with. Therefore, my final thoughts on DOX are:\n\n* **Buy** for long-term value investment. The stock might be somewhat volatile in the short-term, but its long-term value will be consistent.\n* **Hold/Sell** if an investment return is already realized. The economy and overall market is kind of inflated as we recover from the pandemic, therefore a potential cash-out is definitely tangible as rumours of stock market crash spreads.\n\n**TLDR**\n\nAn undervalued technology solution and service provider in a growing market with $0 debt and an upside of at least 25%\n\nOriginal analysis can be found [here](https://info.utradea.com/idea/60997b509f45b0081495db90)",

(\u201c**Digihost**\u201d or the \u201c**Company**\u201d) (TSXV: DGHI; OTCQB: HSSHF) is pleased to report that over 90% of the energy consumed by the Company in its Bitcoin (\u201c**BTC**\u201d) mining operations is from sources that create zero carbon emissions and more than 50% of the energy consumed by the Company is generated from renewable resources.  \n\n\nThe following table provides a breakdown of the sources of energy consumed by Digihost in its BTC mining operations in 2020:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yvz85nzvnyz61.png?width=860&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a9701f3f572d23940e3271369fa5a995d4b2f0ac\n\nA cornerstone of Digihost\u2019s business strategy is to continue to mine BTC in an efficient and environmentally conscious manner, thereby minimizing the Company\u2019s carbon footprint. Digihost will assess a number of alternatives including the purchase of carbon credits to reduce its already low carbon footprint. The Company\u2019s long-term plans for growth include vertical integration of power production from low-cost, clean and renewable sources of energy. On March 24, 2021, the Company announced the acquisition of a 60MW power plant for which it intends, to the extent possible, to source and utilize renewable natural gas and also engage in the practice of acquiring renewable energy certificates, all in line with the Company\u2019s objective to reduce and mitigate its carbon footprint.\n\nMichel Amar, the Company\u2019s CEO, stated: \u201cWe are extremely proud to report that over 90% of the energy consumed by Digihost is from sources producing zero carbon emissions, and that over 50% is from renewable sources of energy, making Digihost one of the cleanest green Bitcoin mining operations in the United States. As a Company, we have always been cognizant of the potential impact Bitcoin mining could have on the environment and therefore have planned our growth and expansion to be environmentally conscious, in our pursuit of opportunities that maximize value for our shareholders.\u201d\n\n[Source](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/digihost-reports-green-energy-consumption-114700287.html)",

The OP cash flow is the best indicator here as unlevered free cash flow has seen some small-scale turbulence in recent years due to M&amp;As such as the acquisition of Openet Telecom, Juganu Ltd., and Veego during CY2020. Overall, DOX is a strong investment from the financial perspective due to its margin growth and consistency.\n\n* **Deep Product Portfolio with Wide Coverage**\n\nThrough \u201camdocsONE\u201d, Amdocs is able to provide a full-suite of comprehensive products/services that covers every stage of digital transformation. From cutting 80% of time-to-market when utilizing Amdocs bundle offers, to continuous operational support and open tools/cloud platforms, clients receive a thorough service when working with Amdocs. Within the six main categories of offerings mention above (Digital Experience &amp; Monetization; Media &amp; Digital Services; Enterprise &amp; Connected Society; Open Cloud Networks &amp; NGOSS; Services &amp; Hybrid Operations; Technology &amp; Practices-Driven Innovation), there are numerous individual products that allows users to customize their usage of the Amdocs\u2019 platform and offerings. For example, CES20 is Amdocs\u2019 cloud-based customer experience suite. Within CES20, there are 4 products that helps automate and digitize the users\u2019 operations: DigitalONE, CatalogONE, RevenueONE, and Service &amp; Network Automation. DigitalONE is a cloud-based system that allows users to work on their branding and customer experience. CatalogONE is an open-cloud platform catalog solution that allows users to launch new products easily with a detailed user interface. RevenueONE is a platform that allows users to scale or acquire new revenue stream while limiting the cost of acquisition. Last, Service &amp; network Automation is a branch covered by amdocsNEO. AmdocsNEO is a service &amp; network automation platform that offers a wide range of tracking and management capabilities. It is used to drive and control the fast automation process of the company. The CES20 is just an example of how Amdocs products are often interconnected and deeply comprehensive. They also offer certain platforms or products/services that are industry specific.\n\nThe wide coverage of the Amdocs offerings means they can gain market penetration across numerous industries. At the same time, the stage-specific offerings allow Amdocs to stay in demand and relevant as clients transition and grow. This plays a huge part into client retainment.\n\nLast, the continuous innovation initiatives at Amdocs supports an investment as it shows the company is consistently trying to grow and improve itself. As a tech company, it is extremely dangerous to slack-off on innovation, which is often seen with tech firms that reaches a consistent profit margin. Being in the tech industry means you live and die by the creativity and uniqueness of the offerings. Amdocs is consistently investing \\~20% of their gross profit into R&amp;D. This shows the company\u2019s dedication to innovation, which ensures that it will remain in demand in the future.\n\n* **Extremely Low Leverage**\n\nThe last thesis is quite a short and simple one: the low leverage of the company means reduced risks and limits debt-related expenses such as interest/principal payments, which in turn increases their profitability. As mentioned above, there has be several years where the company literally at $0 in debt. During FY2020, the company took on \\~$1B worth of debt, which could mean they are preparing for large scale development as from a financial standpoint, they are not in a situation where taking the extra cash is worth the liability. With that being said, the new debt is only 22% of the company\u2019s overall capital structure, and they will have no problem paying off the related fees as they have a strong track-record of positive cash flow.\n\n**Macro Market Trends**\n\nThe overall demand for digital/automation transformation/operations creates numerous trends that can positively impact the future of DOX. With the COVID-19 pandemic, company were pushed by the circumstances to digitize their operations, which will expand the market as well as create higher demand for the future. Here are some top trends that will impact DOX\u2019s performance:\n\n* **Overall Growth of the SaaS Market:**  \n\n   * has been consistent growth in the past decade in the SaaS market. This is driven by multiple factors including the automation of internal control, enterprise centre processing system, as well as the boom of 5G and cloud-based services. Looking into the future, for the period of 2019-23, the worldwide SaaS market is expected to reach a $60.36B valuation, recording a 9% CAGR over that period.\n* **Lasting Impacts of COVID-19:**\n   * The pandemic has already significantly accelerated the digitization rate due to the lockdowns and remote working environments. This is not a one-time catalyst, but rather a preview of what was going to happen in the future regardless; the pandemic situation has simply brought the future quicker. Going cloud or digitizing is not a temporary decision, this means the market has permanently expanded, and will continue to grow as demand increases.\n* **5G Penetration &amp; Advancements**\n   * Continuous developments in 5G technology will impact the SaaS industry in two ways:\n\n1. It will increase the accessibility of cloud-platforms and related services, thus increasing demand.\n2. It will improve the quality and range of capabilities for the products/services of software companies.\n\nIn the modern society, it seems like life is limited if you have bad Wi-Fi connection. That is emphasized in the world of SaaS. Broader bandwidth and connection qualities will incentivize potential customers to digitalise and help service providers create higher quality products.\n\n**Financials and Valuations**\n\nWhen it comes to the fair valuation of Amdocs Limited (DOX), I used both comparable companies and intrinsic valuations, then weighted the price outcomes for the final target price. Instead, I evaluated the company using a basic comparable analysis. The companies included in the comparable universe are Akamai Technologies Inc. (AKAM), Ciena Corporation (CIEN), Citrix Systems (CTXS), Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp. (CTSH), and Perspecta Inc. (PRSP). The DCF valuation is relative crude with simple margin and top-line forecasts, but the results seem very reasonable and in-line with street estimates.\n\n**Risks**\n\nTo finish off this analysis on DOX, there are a few key risks to keep in mind:\n\n* **Cyber Security**\n\nAlthough moving operations towards cloud or digital platforms will increase efficiency and limit costs, it does come with security risks. By nature of public, integrated, and/or connected cloud platforms or enterprise central systems, a large quantity of information can be easily accessed in one spot. Although that makes operations easier, it also increases the impact of hacks or other cyber security concerns. In these interconnected platforms, large amounts of information are at risks once the \u201cfirst door\u201d is opened. Hackers no longer need to crack multiple systems to acquire different information such as customer information and financials. If Amdocs gets hacked, it will likely be very detrimental to the company as large quantity of information will be exposed.\n\n* **Limited Innovation or Growth due to Lack of 5G or Internet Penetration**\n\nFor Amdocs and the entire SaaS industry, poor internet infrastructure will limit growth potential and market penetration. If 5G usage and general internet coverage does not match the rate of innovation of Amdocs, revenue growth will stall, which might impact the pricing of the stock. It will also limit the room for innovation and enhancement, which allows more time for competitors to grow within the current infrastructure and increase the competition.\n\n**In the End: Buy, Hold, or Sell?**\n\nOverall, I think Amdocs Limited (DOX) is currently undervalued. In general, the street has a buy or hold/buy valuation on the current price, which I do agree with. Therefore, my final thoughts on DOX are:\n\n* **Buy** for long-term value investment. The stock might be somewhat volatile in the short-term, but its long-term value will be consistent.\n* **Hold/Sell** if an investment return is already realized. The economy and overall market is kind of inflated as we recover from the pandemic, therefore a potential cash-out is definitely tangible as rumours of stock market crash spreads.\n\n**TLDR**\n\nAn undervalued technology solution and service provider in a growing market with $0 debt and an upside of at least 25%\n\nOriginal analysis can be found [here](https://info.utradea.com/idea/60997b509f45b0081495db90)",

        "selftext": "**Introduction**\n\nOf the many forces of society, the advancement of technology is one that is truly unstoppable. From how we obtain information to how people communicate from a distance, technology has changed the way people live their lives. The service providers of our everyday lives are consistently looking for ways to automate &amp; improve their offerings/operations. This created a market and demand for Amdocs Limited (Nasdaq: DOX), a technology and software product/service (such as consulting) provider that serves companies in communications, media, finance, entertainment, digital, etc.\n\n**Company Overview**\n\nEstablished in 1982 In Israel, Amdocs Limited is a multinational software company headquartered in Missouri, US. For 40 years, Amdocs has been offering advanced software products and related technology services to optimize their clients\u2019 operations. With 26,000 employees, Amdocs is currently in business with 350 service providers in more than 80 countries. Their clientele comprised of leaders in a wide range of industries: telecom giants AT&amp;T &amp; Bell, financial institutions like HSBC, and general crowd favorites such as Amazon, 7Eleven, and Microsoft.\n\nMost of Amdocs\u2019 offerings are provided within \u201camdocsONE\u201d, a comprehensive collection of products/services consisting of: Digital Experience &amp; Monetization; Media &amp; Digital Services; Enterprise &amp; Connected Society; Open Cloud Networks &amp; NGOSS; Services &amp; Hybrid Operations; Technology &amp; Practices-Driven Innovation. With its \u201ccloud-native, modular and open offerings\u201d, Amdocs helps clients smoothly and fully transition into tech-automated, digital operations.\n\nIn such a demanded market with high-ticket clients, Amdocs recorded $4.16B in revenue during FY2020 (ended September 30th, 2020), at a 33.9% Gross Margin, 19% EBITDA Margin, and 11.9% Net Profit Margin. DOX also has consistently growing Operating Cash Flow, recording $910.7M in the Last-Twelve-Months ending in December of 2020.\n\nYes, everything seems to be working out well for DOX, but that brings up the question: is there still room to grow, or has DOX plateaued, making it a safe bet, but not a high-return investment?\n\n**Capital Structure &amp; Shareholders Breakdown**\n\nA quick look at Amdocs\u2019 capital structure: **22% Debt, 77.1% Common Equity, 0.9% Minority Interest.** What is important to point out here is that DOX has **recorded $0 in debt** for 3 straight years from FY2017-19. This is a very uncommon occurrence for a company to be 0% leveraged. In contrast, most of its competitors are operating around the 15%-25% debt/total capital ratio, comparable companies like Akamai Technologies recording \\~40% leverage in its capital structure.\u00a0\n\nWhen it comes the shareholders of DOX, most of its outstanding shares are owned by institutional holders. Traditional portfolio managers such as asset manager firms are the biggest investors, with FMR LLC. as the largest holder. The large scale and consistent (holds &amp; buys) asset management investment shows street professionals see DOX as a profitable, stable investment.\n\n**Looking Long**\n\nOverall, I believe DOX shows potential at a hold/buy for long positions if you are looking to invest in an undervalued, but experienced &amp; matured company.\u00a0 The following are three main theses behind a long investment in DOX:\n\n* **Strong &amp; Consistent Financial Performance:**\n\nAs an established company, we are seeing highly predictable topline growth rate with consistent profit margins. Although these no longer large-scale increases we would see on a growing tech company, DOX\u2019s consistency and strong performance is definitely a supporting factor when it comes to investment. In more detail, DOX has a 2.9% top-line 5-year CAGR as of December 31st, 2020, with corresponding 3%, 3.6%, and 10.4% 5-year CAGR with EBITDA, EBIT, and Net Income, respectively. Although top-line growth was contracting a few years prior, it has rebounded between 2015-20, which could be contributed to the increasing number of companies transitioning into digital operations/cloud systems. Nevertheless, the higher (and increasing) bottom-line CAGRs means the company is still consistently increasing its profit margins (it is important to point out in that 5Y Net Income CAGR as of Dec.31st 2020 is significantly higher than previous years, which were around 2.2%-5.3%). DOX also has a strong cash flow, largely due to steady increases in operating cash flow. The OP cash flow is the best indicator here as unlevered free cash flow has seen some small-scale turbulence in recent years due to M&amp;As such as the acquisition of Openet Telecom, Juganu Ltd., and Veego during CY2020. Overall, DOX is a strong investment from the financial perspective due to its margin growth and consistency.\n\n* **Deep Product Portfolio with Wide Coverage**\n\nThrough \u201camdocsONE\u201d, Amdocs is able to provide a full-suite of comprehensive products/services that covers every stage of digital transformation.

I am a novice investor who happens to be very interested in the sector.**\n\n**Brokerages to Boycott**\n\n1. Robinhood  \u2013 Robinhood has proven to have unscrupulous business practices. They prevented buy orders on Gamestop during the short squeeze. They prevented sell orders on Dogecoin recently. Their users have reported multiple bugs and outages. Their customer service is nonexistent. They sell user data to market makers (hence \u201cno fees\u201d). There are a myriad of  better options below.\n\n**Recommended Brokerages (US)**\n\n1. Fidelity\n2. TD Ameritrade\n3. Schwab\n4. Please suggest other quality brokerages who allow trading of OTC stocks and I will add them.\n\n**Complete list of all psychedelic stocks and their US tickers:** [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eDRCBJp1KcIKusFkxdDHNJMaH7lRqyl\\_asTYcuc68AA/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eDRCBJp1KcIKusFkxdDHNJMaH7lRqyl_asTYcuc68AA/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n**What is an Over The Counter (OTC) stock?**\n\n*From Investopedia:* [*https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/buy-over-the-counter-stock/*](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/buy-over-the-counter-stock/)\n\nOver-the-counter stocks are known as penny stocks because most trade for under $1 per share.\n\nThey can be traded through a full-service broker or through some discount online brokerages.\n\nPrices can be tracked through the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board.\n\nMost  psychedelic stocks are currently traded on OTC markets. There are many  stocks traded on Canadian exchanges (Due to the progressive laws in  Canada, many psychedelic companies are currently based there.) but can  only be purchased in the US via OTC markets.\n\n**What is a bid-ask spread?**\n\n*From Investopedia:*[*https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bid-askspread.asp*](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bid-askspread.asp)\n\nThe  bid-ask spread is essentially the difference between the highest price  that a buyer is willing to pay for an asset and the lowest price that a  seller is willing to accept.\n\nThe  spread is the transaction cost. Price takers buy at the ask price and  sell at the bid price, but the market maker buys at the bid price and  sells at the ask price.\n\nThe bid represents demand and the ask represents supply for an asset.\n\nThe bid-ask spread is the de facto measure of market liquidity.\n\nMany  OTC stocks have a very wide bid-ask spread. The larger the spread, the  more the market maker (middle man) is profiting from executing the  trades. To get the best price for OTC stocks, always use limit orders  (See below).\n\n**What is a limit order?**\n\n*From Investopedia:*[*https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/limitorder.asp*](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/limitorder.asp)\n\nA limit order guarantees that an order is filled at or better than a specific price level.\n\nA limit order is not guaranteed to be filled, however.\n\nLimit orders control execution price but can result in missed opportunities in fast-moving market conditions.\n\nLimit orders can be used in conjunction with stop orders to prevent large downside losses.\n\nIt\u2019s best practice to always use limit orders for OTC stocks, both when buying and selling.\n\n**What is a Foreign Transaction Fee?**\n\n*From Investopedia:* [*https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/foreign-transaction-fee.asp*](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/foreign-transaction-fee.asp)\n\nA  foreign transaction fee is imposed by a credit card issuer on a  transaction that takes place overseas or with a foreign merchant.\n\nThese fees are typically 1%\u20133% of the value of transaction and are paid in dollars.\n\nSeveral banks now offer certain customers waivers on these fees, or fee-free cards.\n\nSome  brokerages charge a Foreign Transaction Fee on OTC stocks since many  are Canadian based companies. Pay attention to these, they can make  small transactions quite expensive. Fidelity waives these fees.\n\n**What is a Wash-Sale Rule?**\n\n*From Investopedia:* [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/washsalerule.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/washsalerule.asp)\n\nA  wash sale occurs when an investor sells or trades a security at a loss,  and within 30 days before or after, buys another one that is  substantially similar.\n\nIt also  happens if the individual sells the security at a loss, and their spouse  or a company they control buys a substantially similar security within  30 days.\n\nThe wash-sale rule prevents taxpayers from deducting a capital loss on the sale against the capital gain.\n\nThis  is relevant as I constantly see people taking about buying and selling  the same stocks repeatedly in a small time frame. Just be cognizant that  if you sell any stock at a loss, then buy back in within 30 days, the  losses cannot be claimed towards the annual $3000 which can be deducted  from your taxes. Even if you have net capital gains for the year, the  $3000 capital gains losses can be used as \u201ctax-loss harvesting\u201d ([https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/taxgainlossharvesting.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/taxgainlossharvesting.asp)) to offset these gains.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf anyone has any suggestions for me to add to this, please let me know.

DOX also has consistently growing Operating Cash Flow, recording $910.7M in the Last-Twelve-Months ending in December of 2020.\n\nYes, everything seems to be working out well for DOX, but that brings up the question: is there still room to grow, or has DOX plateaued, making it a safe bet, but not a high-return investment?\n\n**Capital Structure &amp; Shareholders Breakdown**\n\nA quick look at Amdocs\u2019 capital structure: **22% Debt, 77.1% Common Equity, 0.9% Minority Interest.** What is important to point out here is that DOX has **recorded $0 in debt** for 3 straight years from FY2017-19. This is a very uncommon occurrence for a company to be 0% leveraged. In contrast, most of its competitors are operating around the 15%-25% debt/total capital ratio, comparable companies like Akamai Technologies recording \\~40% leverage in its capital structure.\u00a0\n\nWhen it comes the shareholders of DOX, most of its outstanding shares are owned by institutional holders. Traditional portfolio managers such as asset manager firms are the biggest investors, with FMR LLC. as the largest holder. The large scale and consistent (holds &amp; buys) asset management investment shows street professionals see DOX as a profitable, stable investment.\n\n**Looking Long**\n\nOverall, I believe DOX shows potential at a hold/buy for long positions if you are looking to invest in an undervalued, but experienced &amp; matured company.\u00a0 The following are three main theses behind a long investment in DOX:\n\n* **Strong &amp; Consistent Financial Performance:**\n\nAs an established company, we are seeing highly predictable topline growth rate with consistent profit margins. Although these no longer large-scale increases we would see on a growing tech company, DOX\u2019s consistency and strong performance is definitely a supporting factor when it comes to investment. In more detail, DOX has a 2.9% top-line 5-year CAGR as of December 31st, 2020, with corresponding 3%, 3.6%, and 10.4% 5-year CAGR with EBITDA, EBIT, and Net Income, respectively. Although top-line growth was contracting a few years prior, it has rebounded between 2015-20, which could be contributed to the increasing number of companies transitioning into digital operations/cloud systems. Nevertheless, the higher (and increasing) bottom-line CAGRs means the company is still consistently increasing its profit margins (it is important to point out in that 5Y Net Income CAGR as of Dec.31st 2020 is significantly higher than previous years, which were around 2.2%-5.3%). DOX also has a strong cash flow, largely due to steady increases in operating cash flow. The OP cash flow is the best indicator here as unlevered free cash flow has seen some small-scale turbulence in recent years due to M&amp;As such as the acquisition of Openet Telecom, Juganu Ltd., and Veego during CY2020. Overall, DOX is a strong investment from the financial perspective due to its margin growth and consistency.\n\n* **Deep Product Portfolio with Wide Coverage**\n\nThrough \u201camdocsONE\u201d, Amdocs is able to provide a full-suite of comprehensive products/services that covers every stage of digital transformation. From cutting 80% of time-to-market when utilizing Amdocs bundle offers, to continuous operational support and open tools/cloud platforms, clients receive a thorough service when working with Amdocs. Within the six main categories of offerings mention above (Digital Experience &amp; Monetization; Media &amp; Digital Services; Enterprise &amp; Connected Society; Open Cloud Networks &amp; NGOSS; Services &amp; Hybrid Operations; Technology &amp; Practices-Driven Innovation), there are numerous individual products that allows users to customize their usage of the Amdocs\u2019 platform and offerings. For example, CES20 is Amdocs\u2019 cloud-based customer experience suite. Within CES20, there are 4 products that helps automate and digitize the users\u2019 operations: DigitalONE, CatalogONE, RevenueONE, and Service &amp; Network Automation. DigitalONE is a cloud-based system that allows users to work on their branding and customer experience. CatalogONE is an open-cloud platform catalog solution that allows users to launch new products easily with a detailed user interface. RevenueONE is a platform that allows users to scale or acquire new revenue stream while limiting the cost of acquisition. Last, Service &amp; network Automation is a branch covered by amdocsNEO. AmdocsNEO is a service &amp; network automation platform that offers a wide range of tracking and management capabilities. It is used to drive and control the fast automation process of the company. The CES20 is just an example of how Amdocs products are often interconnected and deeply comprehensive. They also offer certain platforms or products/services that are industry specific.\n\nThe wide coverage of the Amdocs offerings means they can gain market penetration across numerous industries. At the same time, the stage-specific offerings allow Amdocs to stay in demand and relevant as clients transition and grow. This plays a huge part into client retainment.\n\nLast, the continuous innovation initiatives at Amdocs supports an investment as it shows the company is consistently trying to grow and improve itself. As a tech company, it is extremely dangerous to slack-off on innovation, which is often seen with tech firms that reaches a consistent profit margin. Being in the tech industry means you live and die by the creativity and uniqueness of the offerings. Amdocs is consistently investing \\~20% of their gross profit into R&amp;D. This shows the company\u2019s dedication to innovation, which ensures that it will remain in demand in the future.\n\n* **Extremely Low Leverage**\n\nThe last thesis is quite a short and simple one: the low leverage of the company means reduced risks and limits debt-related expenses such as interest/principal payments, which in turn increases their profitability. As mentioned above, there has be several years where the company literally at $0 in debt. During FY2020, the company took on \\~$1B worth of debt, which could mean they are preparing for large scale development as from a financial standpoint, they are not in a situation where taking the extra cash is worth the liability. With that being said, the new debt is only 22% of the company\u2019s overall capital structure, and they will have no problem paying off the related fees as they have a strong track-record of positive cash flow.\n\n**Macro Market Trends**\n\nThe overall demand for digital/automation transformation/operations creates numerous trends that can positively impact the future of DOX. With the COVID-19 pandemic, company were pushed by the circumstances to digitize their operations, which will expand the market as well as create higher demand for the future. Here are some top trends that will impact DOX\u2019s performance:\n\n* **Overall Growth of the SaaS Market:**  \n\n   * has been consistent growth in the past decade in the SaaS market. This is driven by multiple factors including the automation of internal control, enterprise centre processing system, as well as the boom of 5G and cloud-based services. Looking into the future, for the period of 2019-23, the worldwide SaaS market is expected to reach a $60.36B valuation, recording a 9% CAGR over that period.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/re0rwefjhhy61.png?width=581&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3e03058110bfbf707b168afd09bdda586914a7db\n\n* **Lasting Impacts of COVID-19:**  \n\n   * The pandemic has already significantly accelerated the digitization rate due to the lockdowns and remote working environments. This is not a one-time catalyst, but rather a preview of what was going to happen in the future regardless; the pandemic situation has simply brought the future quicker. Going cloud or digitizing is not a temporary decision, this means the market has permanently expanded, and will continue to grow as demand increases.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/78jymbukhhy61.png?width=601&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d0362d3fb6c918222d0ffb49fff1132dadea2686\n\n* **5G Penetration &amp; Advancements**  \n\n   * Continuous developments in 5G technology will impact the SaaS industry in two ways:\n\n1. It will increase the accessibility of cloud-platforms and related services, thus increasing demand.\n2. It will improve the quality and range of capabilities for the products/services of software companies.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zcswsxwlhhy61.png?width=580&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f3c6560ebdcf519a5bbed1bdc42acc3c298571bc\n\nIn the modern society, it seems like life is limited if you have bad Wi-Fi connection. That is emphasized in the world of SaaS. Broader bandwidth and connection qualities will incentivize potential customers to digitalise and help service providers create higher quality products.\n\n**Financials and Valuations**\n\nWhen it comes to the fair valuation of Amdocs Limited (DOX), I used both comparable companies and intrinsic valuations, then weighted the price outcomes for the final target price. Instead, I evaluated the company using a basic comparable analysis. The companies included in the comparable universe are Akamai Technologies Inc. (AKAM), Ciena Corporation (CIEN), Citrix Systems (CTXS), Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp. (CTSH), and Perspecta Inc. (PRSP). The DCF valuation is relative crude with simple margin and top-line forecasts, but the results seem very reasonable and in-line with street estimates.\n\n**Risks**\n\nTo finish off this analysis on DOX, there are a few key risks to keep in mind:\n\n* **Cyber Security**\n\nAlthough moving operations towards cloud or digital platforms will increase efficiency and limit costs, it does come with security risks. By nature of public, integrated, and/or connected cloud platforms or enterprise central systems, a large quantity of information can be easily accessed in one spot. Although that makes operations easier, it also increases the impact of hacks or other cyber security concerns. In these interconnected platforms, large amounts of information are at risks once the \u201cfirst door\u201d is opened. Hackers no longer need to crack multiple systems to acquire different information such as customer information and financials. If Amdocs gets hacked, it will likely be very detrimental to the company as large quantity of information will be exposed.\n\n* **Limited Innovation or Growth due to Lack of 5G or Internet Penetration**\n\nFor Amdocs and the entire SaaS industry, poor internet infrastructure will limit growth potential and market penetration. If 5G usage and general internet coverage does not match the rate of innovation of Amdocs, revenue growth will stall, which might impact the pricing of the stock. It will also limit the room for innovation and enhancement, which allows more time for competitors to grow within the current infrastructure and increase the competition.\n\n**In the End: Buy, Hold, or Sell?**\n\nOverall, I think Amdocs Limited (DOX) is currently undervalued. In general, the street has a buy or hold/buy valuation on the current price, which I do agree with. Therefore, my final thoughts on DOX are:\n\n* **Buy** for long-term value investment. The stock might be somewhat volatile in the short-term, but its long-term value will be consistent.\n* **Hold/Sell** if an investment return is already realized. The economy and overall market is kind of inflated as we recover from the pandemic, therefore a potential cash-out is definitely tangible as rumours of stock market crash spreads.\n\n**TLDR**\n\nAn undervalued technology solution and service provider in a growing market with $0 debt and an upside of at least 25%\n\nOriginal analysis can be found [here](https://info.utradea.com/idea/60997b509f45b0081495db90)",

From how we obtain information to how people communicate from a distance, technology has changed the way people live their lives. The service providers of our everyday lives are consistently looking for ways to automate &amp; improve their offerings/operations. This created a market and demand for Amdocs Limited (Nasdaq: DOX), a technology and software product/service (such as consulting) provider that serves companies in communications, media, finance, entertainment, digital, etc.\n\n**Company Overview**\n\nEstablished in 1982 In Israel, Amdocs Limited is a multinational software company headquartered in Missouri, US. For 40 years, Amdocs has been offering advanced software products and related technology services to optimize their clients\u2019 operations. With 26,000 employees, Amdocs is currently in business with 350 service providers in more than 80 countries.

Within the six main categories of offerings mention above (Digital Experience &amp; Monetization; Media &amp; Digital Services; Enterprise &amp; Connected Society; Open Cloud Networks &amp; NGOSS; Services &amp; Hybrid Operations; Technology &amp; Practices-Driven Innovation), there are numerous individual products that allows users to customize their usage of the Amdocs\u2019 platform and offerings. For example, CES20 is Amdocs\u2019 cloud-based customer experience suite. Within CES20, there are 4 products that helps automate and digitize the users\u2019 operations: DigitalONE, CatalogONE, RevenueONE, and Service &amp; Network Automation. DigitalONE is a cloud-based system that allows users to work on their branding and customer experience. CatalogONE is an open-cloud platform catalog solution that allows users to launch new products easily with a detailed user interface. RevenueONE is a platform that allows users to scale or acquire new revenue stream while limiting the cost of acquisition. Last, Service &amp; network Automation is a branch covered by amdocsNEO. AmdocsNEO is a service &amp; network automation platform that offers a wide range of tracking and management capabilities. It is used to drive and control the fast automation process of the company. The CES20 is just an example of how Amdocs products are often interconnected and deeply comprehensive. They also offer certain platforms or products/services that are industry specific.\n\nThe wide coverage of the Amdocs offerings means they can gain market penetration across numerous industries. At the same time, the stage-specific offerings allow Amdocs to stay in demand and relevant as clients transition and grow. This plays a huge part into client retainment.\n\nLast, the continuous innovation initiatives at Amdocs supports an investment as it shows the company is consistently trying to grow and improve itself. As a tech company, it is extremely dangerous to slack-off on innovation, which is often seen with tech firms that reaches a consistent profit margin. Being in the tech industry means you live and die by the creativity and uniqueness of the offerings. Amdocs is consistently investing \\~20% of their gross profit into R&amp;D. This shows the company\u2019s dedication to innovation, which ensures that it will remain in demand in the future.\n\n* **Extremely Low Leverage**\n\nThe last thesis is quite a short and simple one: the low leverage of the company means reduced risks and limits debt-related expenses such as interest/principal payments, which in turn increases their profitability. As mentioned above, there has be several years where the company literally at $0 in debt. During FY2020, the company took on \\~$1B worth of debt, which could mean they are preparing for large scale development as from a financial standpoint, they are not in a situation where taking the extra cash is worth the liability. With that being said, the new debt is only 22% of the company\u2019s overall capital structure, and they will have no problem paying off the related fees as they have a strong track-record of positive cash flow.\n\n**Macro Market Trends**\n\nThe overall demand for digital/automation transformation/operations creates numerous trends that can positively impact the future of DOX. With the COVID-19 pandemic, company were pushed by the circumstances to digitize their operations, which will expand the market as well as create higher demand for the future. Here are some top trends that will impact DOX\u2019s performance:\n\n* **Overall Growth of the SaaS Market:**  \n\n   * has been consistent growth in the past decade in the SaaS market. This is driven by multiple factors including the automation of internal control, enterprise centre processing system, as well as the boom of 5G and cloud-based services. Looking into the future, for the period of 2019-23, the worldwide SaaS market is expected to reach a $60.36B valuation, recording a 9% CAGR over that period.\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\n* **Lasting Impacts of COVID-19:**  \n\n   * The pandemic has already significantly accelerated the digitization rate due to the lockdowns and remote working environments. This is not a one-time catalyst, but rather a preview of what was going to happen in the future regardless; the pandemic situation has simply brought the future quicker. Going cloud or digitizing is not a temporary decision, this means the market has permanently expanded, and will continue to grow as demand increases.\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\n* **5G Penetration &amp; Advancements**  \n\n   * Continuous developments in 5G technology will impact the SaaS industry in two ways:\n\n1. It will increase the accessibility of cloud-platforms and related services, thus increasing demand.\n2. It will improve the quality and range of capabilities for the products/services of software companies.\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\nIn the modern society, it seems like life is limited if you have bad Wi-Fi connection. That is emphasized in the world of SaaS. Broader bandwidth and connection qualities will incentivize potential customers to digitalise and help service providers create higher quality products.\n\n**Financials and Valuations**\n\nWhen it comes to the fair valuation of Amdocs Limited (DOX), I used both comparable companies and intrinsic valuations, then weighted the price outcomes for the final target price. Instead, I evaluated the company using a basic comparable analysis. The companies included in the comparable universe are Akamai Technologies Inc. (AKAM), Ciena Corporation (CIEN), Citrix Systems (CTXS), Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp. (CTSH), and Perspecta Inc. (PRSP). The DCF valuation is relative crude with simple margin and top-line forecasts, but the results seem very reasonable and in-line with street estimates.\n\n**Risks**\n\nTo finish off this analysis on DOX, there are a few key risks to keep in mind:\n\n* **Cyber Security**\n\nAlthough moving operations towards cloud or digital platforms will increase efficiency and limit costs, it does come with security risks. By nature of public, integrated, and/or connected cloud platforms or enterprise central systems, a large quantity of information can be easily accessed in one spot. Although that makes operations easier, it also increases the impact of hacks or other cyber security concerns. In these interconnected platforms, large amounts of information are at risks once the \u201cfirst door\u201d is opened. Hackers no longer need to crack multiple systems to acquire different information such as customer information and financials. If Amdocs gets hacked, it will likely be very detrimental to the company as large quantity of information will be exposed.\n\n* **Limited Innovation or Growth due to Lack of 5G or Internet Penetration**\n\nFor Amdocs and the entire SaaS industry, poor internet infrastructure will limit growth potential and market penetration. If 5G usage and general internet coverage does not match the rate of innovation of Amdocs, revenue growth will stall, which might impact the pricing of the stock. It will also limit the room for innovation and enhancement, which allows more time for competitors to grow within the current infrastructure and increase the competition.\n\n**In the End: Buy, Hold, or Sell?**\n\nOverall, I think Amdocs Limited (DOX) is currently undervalued. In general, the street has a buy or hold/buy valuation on the current price, which I do agree with. Therefore, my final thoughts on DOX are:\n\n* **Buy** for long-term value investment. The stock might be somewhat volatile in the short-term, but its long-term value will be consistent.\n* **Hold/Sell** if an investment return is already realized. The economy and overall market is kind of inflated as we recover from the pandemic, therefore a potential cash-out is definitely tangible as rumours of stock market crash spreads.\n\n**TLDR**\n\nAn undervalued technology solution and service provider in a growing market with $0 debt and an upside of at least 25%\n\nOriginal analysis can be found [here](https://info.utradea.com/idea/60997b509f45b0081495db90)",

May is typically a month of low volume, so  you have to be agile.  Puts are generally 2 steps out of the money at  open.  Do your own DD.  This is also not a complete list, just a daily  watch list of companies that I feel are going to fare roughly or whom  have typically underperformed this time of year.  This is also not a  short and hold list.

Real ugly.  Volume completely dried up, which gave the shorts free rein to walk it down into oblivion all week.  They had an earnings call on Thursday, which was actually quite good (missed on top line EPS, but beat on revenue, upgraded forward guidance, and opened up more about the 1.5bln $AMZN contract, which sounds better and better the more I hear about it.  It actually traded up for a while this morning, but then just got absolutely assaulted the rest of the day because everybody was sitting it out.  I've averaged down - hard - on this one at this stage to make sure that I'm always within a day or two's striking distance of at least breaking even on the June calls.  I have started buying September calls at the same 13 strike.  I also started buying up more shares at $8.85 this afternoon.  I love a sale.   I'm going to re-evaluate how I feel about the June calls in the coming week.  Given that this stock has had 6 red days out of 7, any moves I make right now would be reactionary.  Further, one interesting thing I noticed was that, in the last 5 or 10 minutes or so, other whale buyers showed up HARD at the $8.79 price.  For a stock who's order book all day was just a series of 3-digit and low 4-digit offers, to see 50,000 share bids show up tells me that the shorts who had been fucking this thing all week were covering AND the buyers were coming back in (probably the same assholes who shorted it).**\n2. *$MA:  I'm still yet to open a position here.  I just haven't liked the price action, and the charts have been very choppy.  If you've played it, let me know how it worked out for you.  Looking back at the weekly, I see some openings NOW, but they weren't real clear in the moment.*\n3. $BABA:  I took the opportunity at 226 to finish filling out my call position as referenced in the last solo stock DD.  I know I said in that DD it was impossible to screw up, but apparently I underestimated the internet some, because I've had people messaging me saying they bought in at 234 and are down and \"feeling pain\", when I explicitly said not to buy at those levels.  It's interesting to me that the Chinese stocks, which are universally accepted to be underpriced, are moving in sympathy with domestic growth stocks.  That's broken.  \n4. **$BE:  Bought more August 31's on Thursday when it was at the bottom.  Sub-$20 was too good of an equity price to pass up.  I really liked the price movement on it yesterday and today.  Their earnings call was SPECTACULAR, and their leadership said all the right things.  I feel really good about this one to finally start moving independently of the rest of the green energy sector. Loser for right now, but I'm not getting shaken out**\n5. $CAT:  Those July 230's were made of latinum.  Closed out today for fat profits.  I consider this trade over until $CAT comes back down into the 220's.\n6. $EXPE:  Bought in yesterday morning.  Closed my position at about 2 pm EST today.  I sat on this trade a little too long and left about $3 a share on the table, but profit is profit.  It was a very nice trade.  This trade is closed\n7. *$AAPL:  I never actually got into my long position.  I closed my pre-existing short on Tuesday and have been eyeing an entry, but haven't found one I like yet.*\n8. $ALGN:  In Tuesday @ 575-ish, out today at 600.  Trade is closed\n9. $PSFE:  As discussed in last week's post, I ended up removing this because the apes started trying to meme stock it, and I replaced it with $CVS, which has made me enough tendies to spring for the top shelf lube for when I fuck.  The $CVS trade is still ongoing and a good one to eye an entry, IMO\n10. $CVX:  Jumped in Monday, and I'm still in the trade.  I like the movement on this one.  Still a good trade to enter, IMO\n11. **$ENPH:  I'm upside down on this one, largely because I've been unwilling to average down on it.  My bags aren't super heavy, but I do have some Samsonites right now.  Going to just store it away and let it marinate.  The price action is still downwards here, so if you're eyeing this one, let it come in further**\n12. $TSCO:  The price action on this has been amazing.  I've actually been holding this for quite some time, so my entry is way in the rear view mirror.  But I love how smoothly it's run and feel it's still got a lot more room to till.\n13. **$CAR:  This is another one I've been holding forever, and just don't want to create a taxable event on.  The price action has generally been flat, if you remove the fact they had earnings this week, and we all know what earnings means in this market.  I still like this one for a buy and hold**\n14. $KMI:  We don't talk about $KMI.  But if you're interested, maybe go look at a chart, because it'll make you wet\n15. **$BB:  I haven't done anything with this, and honestly, couldn't even tell you how it's performed.  Probably poorly.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# The shorts:\n\n1. $TSLA:  I jumped in at $712.11.  Everybody in the daily told me I hated money.  I got out at 666, even though I was swearing up and down it was going to 650.  The price action just looked like it was turning, so I took tendies.  Then it went to 650 like I thought it would.  Could have done it better, but profit is profit.  I'm eyeing a re-entry to the short side on this one.  I'm thinking 685-690 I'll likely re-establish\n2. $UPST:  My most reliable short  I'm twenty-some dollars a share in the green already and still holding.\n3. $TWTR:  It's been SUUUUUPER choppy this week.  I got out at 52.80 for a nice gain, but I've hated the price action.  Staying away from here on out\n4. *$CLOV:  Never had a good opportunity to play it.  Still watching*\n5. $SPCE:  Death, taxes, and $SPCE tanking.  Still holding for a modest gain with stop losses in place.  Been pretty flat.  Probably still a good short if you can time it.\n6. $PTON:  God bless that Shortbus All-Star kid who got eaten by the treadmill.  Lambo squad trade.  Closed out, and consider the trade done unless I see it in the mid 90's again\n7. *$TSM:  Never entered.  I thought I had a price target in mind, but I wussed out at the last moment.  Doesn't matter, Theta Semi living up to its name*\n8. $BLNK:  30% gain.  I'll look for re-entry at 35.\n9. **$GS:  Defying the odds.  Trimmed my position to hedge losses, but this one isn't working out so far. Will look for weakness to re-establish in full**\n10. $PINS:  Closed half my position at 60 for a nice gain.  Holding the other half with tight stop losses, but I'm optimistic it's got further to fall\n11. *$BMBL:  I missed it.  Kicking myself for it, too.  I knew it was gonna fall.  Not sure how much downside is left*\n12. $EGHT:  Oh the sweet sound of an equity dying.  This one is printing for me hard, and I think it's still got another 3-4 dollars to the downside in it\n13. $MDB:  See $EGHT.  Exact same story\n14. $PCG:  Riding it down like a submissive whore.  I'll probably run this one the entire month.  Printing nicely, still plenty of room to drop\n15. $DASH:  LAMBO SQUAD!  Oh man, this one has been magnificent.  And it's still got downside.  Fair value IMO is 80.  It'll never hit it, but I think 110 is entirely doable.\n16. $GRUB:  Reliable gainer to the downside, but not as nice as $DASH.  Still holding. \n17. $WORK:  Quietly dropped on no news.  Just shows how broken the market is, because the buyout price is baked in.  I was following this so I could see news to potentially short $CRM, but none came.  $CRM, however, fell nicely on the week, but I wasn't there to catch it.  Trade is likely running out of breath\n18. *$CAN  Never entered it, which is sad because it could have been a good gainer.  I'll rectify that mistake on some upwards momentum*\n19. $BYND:  Yacht squad.  What an amazing loser.  Still holding.  I want to see 95\n20. $AFRM:  I love the concept, but I hate the business model.  This one has been a great gainer for me, but I want to see 44.  Still room to drop\n21. $COUR:  Inadvertent earnings play.  Didn't realize t hey were reporting this week.  Happy accidents.  2 bagger, excellent play.  I covered this afternoon.  I think there's probably still another 10% to the downside possible, but I actually like the model and don't want to tempt fate.  This trade is closed to me.\n22. *$HEP:  Got in and got out at dead even.  Thought I had a good entry but then things got choppy and weird.  Removed it from my watch list.  This trade is dead to me with a draw.*\n23. *$CSCO:  never entered.  Which is good, because it's run up.  I'm eyeing an entry*\n24. $PLNT:  Another great winner.  I wanna see another 4 dollars to the downside  Trade still live\n25. $QS:  Patently obvious this was gonna drop like a rock.  Ask me when it's at $10 and I'll probably still be shorting it\n26. *$WMT:  I got cute and walked into a flat trade.  Will exit next week, win lose or draw.*\n27. **$ADT:  Took the L here.  Entered at $9.27, got scared off this afternoon with a small loss.  Took it off my watch list, trade is dead to me**\n28. *$TW, $RTX, $COF, $NOC, $ADM, $AAL, $WHR, $LUMN, didn't enter any of these.  $COF, $AAL and $WHR are the only ones I'm even still tracking.  The others are dead to me*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRecord after 1 week:  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLongs:  8-5-2 (given the week that just happened, I'll take it)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShorts:  18-2-15:  Most of the draws are simply because I never entered the trades.  Take out the trades where I never expended powder and it's 18-2-2.  \n\n# \n\n# Overall (played trades):  26-2-2\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo....how'd you do?  Let's hear it.",

I didn't like their valuations, and  150% gains in just a few months was unreasonable though welcomed. So I secured the bag. \n\nUnfortunately, I didn't follow my own advice for SPCE, BEPC, and ENPH\n\nI'm not saying try to time the market.

        "selftext": "So I have some understanding of wash sales but would love some confirmation.  So I got caught bag holding ENPH with a cost basis of $145.  So my idea was to sell the shares and by a LEAPS to take advantage of the loss but still profit from the upside (if there is any).  However after looking it up it seems like this would still count as a wash.\n\nNew idea buy the LEAPS first, wait 31 days and then sell the shares.  This way I\u2019m not missing out and any potential rebound and if I\u2019m still down and can harvest some losses.  Would this work to avoid a wash?  I understand that I am taking on more risk for those 31 days because I will be overweighted in ENPH.",

I don't know nobody who build house in winter and install solars etc...\n\n2. Big correlation with TSLA - car sellings are also lower in winter time ( Christmas etc.) for all car makers.\n\n3. Big correlation with whole tech. market.\n\n4. Pump&amp;Dump with PLUG for sure tanks this ETF\n\n5. Petro time is over (not in 100%, I know we still need this petro)\n\n6. Agenda 2030 and whole climate changes\n\n7. Reversal correlation with petro companys\n\n8. Uncle Joe and green energy promotions\n\n9. In Europe we have big donations from government to promote green energy (solars, cars)\n\n10. Car makers are hitting EV like crazy, all companys are working now on EV.\n\n11. Volkswagen stopped working on new engines, they will only upgrade this what they have now and till 2040 they want to stop using combustion engines.\n\nlink: [https://www.motor1.com/news/495958/vw-stopping-gas-engine-development/](https://www.motor1.com/news/495958/vw-stopping-gas-engine-development/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs long as tech market is growing Clean Energy will grow in the same way.",

I don't know nobody who build house in winter and install solars etc...  \n2. Big correlation with TSLA - car sellings are also lower in winter time ( Christmas etc.) for all car makers.  \n3. Big correlation with whole tech. market.  \n4. Pump&amp;Dump with PLUG for sure tanks this ETF  \n5. Petro time is over (not in 100%, I know we still need this petro)  \n6. Agenda 2030 and whole climate changes  \n7. Reversal correlation with petro companys  \n8. Uncle Joe and green energy promotions  \n9. In Europe we have big donations from government to promote green energy (solars, cars)  \n10. Car makers are hitting EV like crazy, all companys are working now on EV.  \n11. Volkswagen stopped working on new engines, they will only upgrade this what they have now and till 2040 they want to stop using combustion engines.  \nlink: [https://www.motor1.com/news/495958/vw-stopping-gas-engine-development/](https://www.motor1.com/news/495958/vw-stopping-gas-engine-development/)  \n\n\nAs long as tech market is growing Clean Energy will grow in the same way.",

May is typically a month of low volume, so  you have to be agile.  Puts are generally 2 steps out of the money at  open.  Do your own DD.  This is also not a complete list, just a daily  watch list of companies that I feel are going to fare roughly or whom  have typically underperformed this time of year.

Real ugly.  Volume completely dried up, which gave the shorts free rein to walk it down into oblivion all week.  They had an earnings call on Thursday, which was actually quite good (missed on top line EPS, but beat on revenue, upgraded forward guidance, and opened up more about the 1.5bln $AMZN contract, which sounds better and better the more I hear about it.  It actually traded up for a while this morning, but then just got absolutely assaulted the rest of the day because everybody was sitting it out.  I've averaged down - hard - on this one at this stage to make sure that I'm always within a day or two's striking distance of at least breaking even on the June calls.  I have started buying September calls at the same 13 strike.  I also started buying up more shares at $8.85 this afternoon.  I love a sale.   I'm going to re-evaluate how I feel about the June calls in the coming week.  Given that this stock has had 6 red days out of 7, any moves I make right now would be reactionary.  Further, one interesting thing I noticed was that, in the last 5 or 10 minutes or so, other whale buyers showed up HARD at the $8.79 price.  For a stock who's order book all day was just a series of 3-digit and low 4-digit offers, to see 50,000 share bids show up tells me that the shorts who had been fucking this thing all week were covering AND the buyers were coming back in (probably the same assholes who shorted it).**\n2. *$MA:  I'm still yet to open a position here.  I just haven't liked the price action, and the charts have been very choppy.  If you've played it, let me know how it worked out for you.  Looking back at the weekly, I see some openings NOW, but they weren't real clear in the moment.*\n3. $BABA:  I took the opportunity at 226 to finish filling out my call position as referenced in the last solo stock DD.  I know I said in that DD it was impossible to screw up, but apparently I underestimated the internet some, because I've had people messaging me saying they bought in at 234 and are down and \"feeling pain\", when I explicitly said not to buy at those levels.  It's interesting to me that the Chinese stocks, which are universally accepted to be underpriced, are moving in sympathy with domestic growth stocks.  That's broken.  \n4. **$BE:  Bought more August 31's on Thursday when it was at the bottom.  Sub-$20 was too good of an equity price to pass up.  I really liked the price movement on it yesterday and today.  Their earnings call was SPECTACULAR, and their leadership said all the right things.  I feel really good about this one to finally start moving independently of the rest of the green energy sector. Loser for right now, but I'm not getting shaken out**\n5. $CAT:  Those July 230's were made of latinum.  Closed out today for fat profits.  I consider this trade over until $CAT comes back down into the 220's.\n6. $EXPE:  Bought in yesterday morning.  Closed my position at about 2 pm EST today.  I sat on this trade a little too long and left about $3 a share on the table, but profit is profit.  It was a very nice trade.  This trade is closed\n7. *$AAPL:  I never actually got into my long position.  I closed my pre-existing short on Tuesday and have been eyeing an entry, but haven't found one I like yet.*\n8. $ALGN:  In Tuesday @ 575-ish, out today at 600.  Trade is closed\n9. $PSFE:  As discussed in last week's post, I ended up removing this because the apes started trying to meme stock it, and I replaced it with $CVS, which has made me enough tendies to spring for the top shelf lube for when I fuck.  The $CVS trade is still ongoing and a good one to eye an entry, IMO\n10. $CVX:  Jumped in Monday, and I'm still in the trade.  I like the movement on this one.  Still a good trade to enter, IMO\n11. **$ENPH:  I'm upside down on this one, largely because I've been unwilling to average down on it.  My bags aren't super heavy, but I do have some Samsonites right now.  Going to just store it away and let it marinate.  The price action is still downwards here, so if you're eyeing this one, let it come in further**\n12. $TSCO:  The price action on this has been amazing.  I've actually been holding this for quite some time, so my entry is way in the rear view mirror.  But I love how smoothly it's run and feel it's still got a lot more room to till.\n13. **$CAR:  This is another one I've been holding forever, and just don't want to create a taxable event on.  The price action has generally been flat, if you remove the fact they had earnings this week, and we all know what earnings means in this market.  I still like this one for a buy and hold**\n14. $KMI:  We don't talk about $KMI.  But if you're interested, maybe go look at a chart, because it'll make you wet\n15. **$BB:  I haven't done anything with this, and honestly, couldn't even tell you how it's performed.  Probably poorly.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# The shorts:\n\n1. $TSLA:  I jumped in at $712.11.  Everybody in the daily told me I hated money.  I got out at 666, even though I was swearing up and down it was going to 650.  The price action just looked like it was turning, so I took tendies.  Then it went to 650 like I thought it would.  Could have done it better, but profit is profit.  I'm eyeing a re-entry to the short side on this one.  I'm thinking 685-690 I'll likely re-establish\n2. $UPST:  My most reliable short  I'm twenty-some dollars a share in the green already and still holding.\n3. $TWTR:  It's been SUUUUUPER choppy this week.  I got out at 52.80 for a nice gain, but I've hated the price action.  Staying away from here on out\n4. *$CLOV:  Never had a good opportunity to play it.  Still watching*\n5. $SPCE:  Death, taxes, and $SPCE tanking.  Still holding for a modest gain with stop losses in place.  Been pretty flat.  Probably still a good short if you can time it.\n6. $PTON:  God bless that Shortbus All-Star kid who got eaten by the treadmill.  Lambo squad trade.  Closed out, and consider the trade done unless I see it in the mid 90's again\n7. *$TSM:  Never entered.  I thought I had a price target in mind, but I wussed out at the last moment.  Doesn't matter, Theta Semi living up to its name*\n8. $BLNK:  30% gain.  I'll look for re-entry at 35.\n9. **$GS:  Defying the odds.  Trimmed my position to hedge losses, but this one isn't working out so far. Will look for weakness to re-establish in full**\n10. $PINS:  Closed half my position at 60 for a nice gain.  Holding the other half with tight stop losses, but I'm optimistic it's got further to fall\n11. *$BMBL:  I missed it.  Kicking myself for it, too.  I knew it was gonna fall.  Not sure how much downside is left*\n12. $EGHT:  Oh the sweet sound of an equity dying.  This one is printing for me hard, and I think it's still got another 3-4 dollars to the downside in it\n13. $MDB:  See $EGHT.  Exact same story\n14. $PCG:  Riding it down like a submissive whore.  I'll probably run this one the entire month.  Printing nicely, still plenty of room to drop\n15. $DASH:  LAMBO SQUAD!  Oh man, this one has been magnificent.  And it's still got downside.  Fair value IMO is 80.  It'll never hit it, but I think 110 is entirely doable.\n16. $GRUB:  Reliable gainer to the downside, but not as nice as $DASH.  Still holding. \n17. $WORK:  Quietly dropped on no news.  Just shows how broken the market is, because the buyout price is baked in.  I was following this so I could see news to potentially short $CRM, but none came.  $CRM, however, fell nicely on the week, but I wasn't there to catch it.  Trade is likely running out of breath\n18. *$CAN  Never entered it, which is sad because it could have been a good gainer.  I'll rectify that mistake on some upwards momentum*\n19. $BYND:  Yacht squad.  What an amazing loser.  Still holding.  I want to see 95\n20. $AFRM:  I love the concept, but I hate the business model.  This one has been a great gainer for me, but I want to see 44.  Still room to drop\n21. $COUR:  Inadvertent earnings play.  Didn't realize t hey were reporting this week.  Happy accidents.  2 bagger, excellent play.  I covered this afternoon.  I think there's probably still another 10% to the downside possible, but I actually like the model and don't want to tempt fate.  This trade is closed to me.\n22. *$HEP:  Got in and got out at dead even.  Thought I had a good entry but then things got choppy and weird.  Removed it from my watch list.  This trade is dead to me with a draw.*\n23. *$CSCO:  never entered.  Which is good, because it's run up.  I'm eyeing an entry*\n24. $PLNT:  Another great winner.  I wanna see another 4 dollars to the downside  Trade still live\n25. $QS:  Patently obvious this was gonna drop like a rock.  Ask me when it's at $10 and I'll probably still be shorting it\n26. *$WMT:  I got cute and walked into a flat trade.  Will exit next week, win lose or draw.*\n27. **$ADT:  Took the L here.  Entered at $9.27, got scared off this afternoon with a small loss.  Took it off my watch list, trade is dead to me**\n28. *$TW, $RTX, $COF, $NOC, $ADM, $AAL, $WHR, $LUMN, didn't enter any of these.  $COF, $AAL and $WHR are the only ones I'm even still tracking.  The others are dead to me*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRecord after 1 week:  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLongs:  8-5-2 (given the week that just happened, I'll take it)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShorts:  18-2-15:  Most of the draws are simply because I never entered the trades.

I originally bought my 3 leaps on Jan 4th, I now have 9 leaps at an avg of 39.85 and they are going for 19.45, my new plan is to the following: \n\nBuild on stocks that I like, invest 70% of all of my checks and keep 30% for savings/debt. I also plan on keeping my 2023 leaps as I have a lot now and I do think this stock could be 300 by Jan 2023 or Dec 2022(if so ill make 6 figures, I just think the upside is here and not selling the bottom). The company has a killer last Q report, but of course, chip shortage, or I can Plan to roll them to 2024s when they become available later this year. still up from last May.

I hope you enjoy.\n\n# Overview \n\nThe era of clean energy is upon us and the timing couldn\u2019t be better to get behind Joe Biden\u2019s newly proposed [2.3 trillion dollar](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/14/us/politics/biden-climate-plan.html) clean energy infrastructure plan. Clean energy generation is about to ride some huge tailwinds as described by this article on Financial Times.\n\n\u201cBiden\u2019s plan would see an infusion of more than $350bn directly into clean energy driving electric-vehicle infrastructure, reinvigorating the grid and boosting research and development plus an estimated $400bn extending and expanding tax credits for clean energy generation and storage. It would also set a clean energy standard mandating utilities to produce power that is carbon-free by 2035.\u201d\n\n**Transition to Clean Energy, the Solar Industry, and Enphase**\n\nOne industry already seeing increased demand as the world shifts to clean energy is solar. In the last decade alone, solar has experienced an average annual growth rate of **42%** ([source](https://www.seia.org/solar-industry-research-data#:~:text=Solar%2520as%2520an%2520Economic%2520Engine,investment%2520in%2520the%2520American%2520economy.)). Solar is currently regarded as the cheapest source of energy in the history of the world, far surpassing coal and gas, as well as beat out wind and other renewables.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4vjgoa4ch3071.png?width=758&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f94e4243370525359d8b781d773996be18ef94c0\n\nLet\u2019s talk about one of the biggest players currently dominating this industry, Enphase (ENPH). Enphase is the largest designer and manufacturer in the solar energy market selling micro-inverters for homes, installing solar panels onto their roofs, and currently capturing over 50% of the U.S market. Enphase\u2019s strategy revolves around four core pillars: new product development (innovating the micro-inverter), residential energy storage, commercial solar projects, and services platform.\n\nBy executing the strategies mentioned above they are expecting to increase their Serviceable Addressable Market (SAM) from $4.1 billion in 2020 to roughly \\~$14 billion in 2023. All of this is powered by organic growth and the new clean energy movement providing margins of roughly 40% which are worthy enough to write home about.\n\n**Setbacks**\n\nLike any industry or company, there will be some challenging obstacles to overcome. For Enphase, one of their biggest hurdles is the global semiconductor chip-shortage, which should give some headwinds until at least the end of 2021. The chip-shortage is not a new headline and has been plaguing many industries. On Enphase\u2019s recent earnings call management noted that although demand remains strong they can\u2019t fill orders because there isn\u2019t enough material for them to keep up with demand. However, these are short term headwinds and the global semiconductor chip shortage is not expected to continue forever. Thus, this represents an excellent buying opportunity for ENPH. In a RARE occurrence even Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, AND Barclays [all agreeing on one thing](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/28/enphase-posts-record-quarter-stock-slides-on-chip-shortage-pains.html) that was recommending buying the recent Enphase dip.\n\n\u201cThe silver lining is obvious to us: those looking to take the long-view on ENPH will correctly view this eventually transient headwind, as a buying opportunity on any weakness,\u201d noted Barclays, while Goldman said that \u201cdemand and margins remain robust.\u201d\n\n**Final Thoughts**\n\nEnphase\u2019s dominance in this industry has allowed them to capture a large piece of this ever-growing pie. Their flagship product is still innovating with each iteration while they expand commercial and residential offerings. Their SAM is expecting to grow exponentially over the next 5-10 years and ENPH is aggressively (and succeeding) trying to capture ever dollar of it. The stock has tumbled from all-time-highs, which leaves some breathing room for a good entry since their valuation has contracted.",

So my idea was to sell the shares and by a LEAPS to take advantage of the loss but still profit from the upside (if there is any).  However after looking it up it seems like this would still count as a wash.\n\nNew idea buy the LEAPS first, wait 31 days and then sell the shares.  This way I\u2019m not missing out and any potential rebound and if I\u2019m still down and can harvest some losses.  Would this work to avoid a wash?

I hope you enjoy.\n\n# Overview \n\nThe era of clean energy is upon us and the timing couldn\u2019t be better to get behind Joe Biden\u2019s newly proposed [2.3 trillion dollar](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/14/us/politics/biden-climate-plan.html) clean energy infrastructure plan. Clean energy generation is about to ride some huge tailwinds as described by this article on Financial Times.\n\n\u201cBiden\u2019s plan would see an infusion of more than $350bn directly into clean energy driving electric-vehicle infrastructure, reinvigorating the grid and boosting research and development plus an estimated $400bn extending and expanding tax credits for clean energy generation and storage. It would also set a clean energy standard mandating utilities to produce power that is carbon-free by 2035.\u201d\n\n**Transition to Clean Energy, the Solar Industry, and Enphase**\n\nOne industry already seeing increased demand as the world shifts to clean energy is solar. In the last decade alone, solar has experienced an average annual growth rate of **42%** ([source](https://www.seia.org/solar-industry-research-data#:~:text=Solar%2520as%2520an%2520Economic%2520Engine,investment%2520in%2520the%2520American%2520economy.)). Solar is currently regarded as the cheapest source of energy in the history of the world, far surpassing coal and gas, as well as beat out wind and other renewables.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yl17uc2qh3071.png?width=758&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=61e0e8c9f530a906ee92b66003cfde1132ad86d2\n\nLet\u2019s talk about one of the biggest players currently dominating this industry, Enphase (ENPH). Enphase is the largest designer and manufacturer in the solar energy market selling micro-inverters for homes, installing solar panels onto their roofs, and currently capturing over 50% of the U.S market. Enphase\u2019s strategy revolves around four core pillars: new product development (innovating the micro-inverter), residential energy storage, commercial solar projects, and services platform.\n\nBy executing the strategies mentioned above they are expecting to increase their Serviceable Addressable Market (SAM) from $4.1 billion in 2020 to roughly \\~$14 billion in 2023. All of this is powered by organic growth and the new clean energy movement providing margins of roughly 40% which are worthy enough to write home about.\n\n**Setbacks**\n\nLike any industry or company, there will be some challenging obstacles to overcome. For Enphase, one of their biggest hurdles is the global semiconductor chip-shortage, which should give some headwinds until at least the end of 2021. The chip-shortage is not a new headline and has been plaguing many industries. On Enphase\u2019s recent earnings call management noted that although demand remains strong they can\u2019t fill orders because there isn\u2019t enough material for them to keep up with demand. However, these are short term headwinds and the global semiconductor chip shortage is not expected to continue forever. Thus, this represents an excellent buying opportunity for ENPH. In a RARE occurrence even Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, AND Barclays [all agreeing on one thing](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/28/enphase-posts-record-quarter-stock-slides-on-chip-shortage-pains.html) that was recommending buying the recent Enphase dip.\n\n\u201cThe silver lining is obvious to us: those looking to take the long-view on ENPH will correctly view this eventually transient headwind, as a buying opportunity on any weakness,\u201d noted Barclays, while Goldman said that \u201cdemand and margins remain robust.\u201d\n\n**Final Thoughts**\n\nEnphase\u2019s dominance in this industry has allowed them to capture a large piece of this ever-growing pie. Their flagship product is still innovating with each iteration while they expand commercial and residential offerings. Their SAM is expecting to grow exponentially over the next 5-10 years and ENPH is aggressively (and succeeding) trying to capture ever dollar of it. The stock has tumbled from all-time-highs, which leaves some breathing room for a good entry since their valuation has contracted.",

        "selftext": " Ok kids, listen up. A couple helpful posters keyed me into the fact that a certain hedge was shorting two stocks, so I went on a bit of a dig.\n\nI present to you Public Enemy #1 and #2.\n\nBlackstone Alternative Investment Funds\n\nand\n\nCutler Group LP (has a history of violations for naked shorts)\n\nBelow you will find the list of stocks I found them to be short on, and their last reported positions - which in most cases are 5/10 - yeah that's right, YESTERDAY. We know exactly what they've shorted, and we know exactly what to do, right?\n\n**We buy. We Hold. We win.**\n\nThese two hedgies are shorting almost every stock we hodl dear. They are trying to take our hard earned stimmies just because they can. These are some of the people who have driven us red the last month. These are the kind of people who think they can have my wife without her boyfriend present. Oh HELL no. Over my cold, dead tendies. \n\nBelow are Blackstone's positions. You will see Cutler on many of those, as well as on some others that Blackstone was not in.\n\nPLTR (5/10)\n\nLatest Disclosed Ownership-157,100 sharesLatest Disclosed Value$ -3,658,859\n\nRKT (5/10)\n\nLatest Disclosed Ownership-2,500 sharesLatest Disclosed Value$ -57,725\n\nAV LIDAR developer (5/10)\n\nLatest Disclosed Ownership-9,600 sharesLatest Disclosed Value$ -178,080\n\nvideo game store (3/1)\n\nLatest Disclosed Ownership-21,600 sharesLatest Disclosed Value$ -406,944\n\nBABA (5/10)\n\nLatest Disclosed Ownership-2,600 sharesLatest Disclosed Value$ -589,498\n\nASO (5/10)\n\nLatest Disclosed Ownership-3,700 sharesLatest Disclosed Value$ -99,863\n\nBAK (5/10)\n\nLatest Disclosed Ownership-100 sharesLatest Disclosed Value$ -1,422\n\nVIAC (5/10) (Melvin's shorting this too)\n\nLatest Disclosed Ownership-35,329 sharesLatest Disclosed Value$ -1,593,337\n\nENPH (5/10)\n\nLatest Disclosed Ownership-1,400 sharesLatest Disclosed Value$ -227,024\n\nCLNE (5/10)\n\nLatest Disclosed Ownership-39,000 sharesLatest Disclosed Value$ -535,860\n\nBE (5/10)\n\nLatest Disclosed Ownership-1,400 sharesLatest Disclosed Value$ -37,870\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAdditionally, there's a bonus in this list! \n\nAmong those precious stocks above is one that is primed for a gamma squeeze. \n\nThis stock is a small cap, so WSB can move the price.\n\nThis stock has significant short interest, which will assist in a gamma squeeze (it will not short squeeze, this is just an added little boost if it does gamma squeeze)\n\nThis stock has low average volume, meaning short positions will have higher DTC. This also means quicker and stronger price volatility.\n\nThis stock has been bent over hard and is currently at a bargain price well under any valuation you can find.\n\nThere are 4 million shares worth of options that will be ITM if the stock spikes. Average volume is 3.5m.\n\nI give you CLNE.\n\nIf you want DD on it, do your own. The play is simple. \n\n**Buy shares, Hold shares, Win tendies.**",
