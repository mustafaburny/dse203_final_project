        "selftext": "I am 22 and just started working in one of the top technology companies in the world.\n\nI have never bought any Indian or Foreign stocks before. But I am given stocks of the company that I am working for (which is listed on NASDAQ) through ESOP and ESPP in a fidelity account opened by the company. However, I cant see the option of buying any other stock from the Fidelity account that is given to me (maybe I need to sign up for it somewhere else?). \n\nPlease help! Also, I want to know what are the gotchas, as in deductions or something associated with trading with the forex.\n\nMany people have suggested to me in the past that I should focus on investing in the Indian market instead of the foreign market. My argument is that the stocks that I am mostly interested in (and know more about) are technology companies out of India.\n\nThank you.",
