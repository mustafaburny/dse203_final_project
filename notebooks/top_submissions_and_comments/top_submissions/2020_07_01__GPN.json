        "selftext": "Just had a great time holding UPS through earnings and looking for another low IV play to hold through earnings as well. GPN catches my eye.\n\nGPN reports premarket on 8/3. 8/21 180C and 185C are cheap and have IVs hovering around 38%.\n\nThis stock hasn't recovered nearly as much as Paypal or SQ despite operating in the same space. The only thing that give me pause is that much of their business comes from selling solutions to merchants in addition to online payment solutions.\n\nIs this a logical play or am I retard?",

        "selftext": "$FIS $FISV $RPAY $GPN $IIIV $PAYS $\n\nI get how payment processors like $V Visaand $MA M*sterCard make money and the hardware providers like Square, Adyen and Wirecard make money through hardware transactions but how do the software providers make money and what differentiates them from one another? Companies that provide the hardware like $SQ won't use 3rd party provider solutions for their software if they already provide the hardware so why wouldn't people use the integrated solution instead?\n\nIf a company already provides the hardware like Square, Adyen or Wirecard, how do software only payments companies like Global Payments, Repay and i3 Verticals compete if the hardware providers are owned by companies that also provide software like FISV owning Clover?",
