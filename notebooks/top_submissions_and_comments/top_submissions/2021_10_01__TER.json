They are also excellent companies worth looking into.\n\nMostly I just use the MACD lines layed over a TTM Squeeze histogram (shows buy / sell signals and dip buying opportunities with more clarity IMO) and below that the RSI (cause overbought and oversold conditions matter to algo's) - then just using a few moving averages (21 day, 50 day, and 200 day) cause people stare at charts too much and psychology and shit.   \\*\\*\\*and remember proper TA needs to agree on Multiple Timeframes and agree with the indicators - the more factors in agreement there are the more accurate the outlook is.\n\nTickers mentioned in order:\n\n* 23&amp;Me\n* SoFi\n* Ford\n* BlackBerry\n* Indie Semiconductor\n\n\\---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1. **23&amp;Me - $ME** (fyi they have a MASSIVE DNA database, and arent just giving you your 1% native american ancestry information - they are using massive Genomes to aid in developing new drugs and therapeutics to help with rare genetic diseases and such plus could also get bought out or some shit idk - but the Charts look good long term.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[The Weekly \\/ Long Term chart- ](https://preview.redd.it/74qiye28cwu71.png?width=3246&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e349e9a3bd3b8ed8604a3ab6c5f58d5c01bc6c92)\n\n* we appear to be breaking out here towards the upper standard deviation\n* MACD cross with Buy Signal (this is a great setup to buy LEAPS right here)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[The Daily chart \\(Medium \\/ Long Term\\)](https://preview.redd.it/e7f4wa28cwu71.png?width=3270&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f3cf5c55d36e670f6e8d59f3b2080dc4c11f2785)\n\n* MACD Cross / Buy Signal\n* TTM histogram bars are rising aggressively from red-&gt;yellow-&gt;light blue\n* RSI is not overbought yet even long ter\n\n# TLDR:   10 or 12$ Leaps for 2022\n\n# ------------------------------------\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2.  **SOFI** \\- cause its SoFly..  and they got upgrades and shit from morgan stanley - not to mention Galileo is pretty legit FinTech Shittt - and the charts are looking great to make long term positions here!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[The Weekly Chart \\(long term\\)](https://preview.redd.it/9mqgw45edwu71.png?width=3252&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bf6b5f8d90ac36560e99c31270001ce61a490f8d)\n\n* Strong MACD cross / Buy Signal\n* TTM Bars are Yellow and pushing up \n* RSI is not yet over-bought long term\n* no 200 day MA yet / but Breaking Out above center deviation channel towards upper channel\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[The Daily Chart \\(long - medium term\\)](https://preview.redd.it/a7dfc55edwu71.png?width=3248&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=29975356ae2b282501e86b1168e3b85d9e8ca758)\n\n* Definitely breaking above generalized 200-day MA (golden cross)\n* Pretty much exact same notes as above - but TA needs to agree on Multiple Timeframes and agree with the indicators - so with multiple time frames and multiple indicators agreeing - this is BULLISH.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[4-Hour Chart \\(short-medium term\\)](https://preview.redd.it/vehgt05edwu71.png?width=3270&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=57f2a65f89ae825e2653a1e3c624342e4bef01d1)\n\n1.

        "selftext": "Stocks continued their remarkable rally, with all three major indexes rising and the tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) reaching a fresh intraday high amid continued strength by mega-cap tech stocks during earnings. This is despite new economic data that showed US GDP slowdown to its slowest expansion rate in over a year and new weekly unemployment claims. The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, outperformed the major indexes on the day. Looking ahead, market participants continue to digest the ongoing corporate earning season.\n\nThe GDP report showed the economy decelerated to expand at the slowest rate in over one year for the July through September quarter, with the Delta variant and supply-side constraints capping economic activity. GDP rose at a 2.0% annualized rate, missing estimates for the 2.6% pace consensus economists anticipated. However, despite this report and other recent tepid economic data, market participants have remained remarkably resilient and kept buying up any dips.\n\nEarlier in the week, the Conference Board, a non-profit business research organization, released their October monthly consumer confidence index, which showed confidence rising as coronavirus cases in the US continued to retreat from the latest spike. Cases in the US retreated from a high in the previous spike of 285,058 to 105,561 in between September 13 and October 25. The Conference Board's consumer confidence index rose to 113.8 in October from 109.8 in September. This came in higher than the 108.0 consensus economists were looking for, according to Bloomberg data. It also marked the first monthly increase in confidence since June.  \n\nThe latest batch of earnings results helped affirm to Wall Street that many companies will be able to work through rising price pressures to continue delivering estimates-topping sales and profits. Though the expectation is that  inflationary pressures and supply chain disruptions could last for longer than previously anticipated, the impacts will be surmountable to most companies. \n\nLori Calvasina, Chief Equity Strategist at RBC Capital Markets, said \u201cWhat we\u2019ve got from these supply chain issues is a near-term earnings problem. I think it's something we do have to monitor in the first half of the year. Earnings growth is only tracking at 4% or 6% in the first two quarters of next year. So companies do have to keep managing through for the market to continue to move up. But the reality is that the underlying economic backdrop simply is not stagnant.
