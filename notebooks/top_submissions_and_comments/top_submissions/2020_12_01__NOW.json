Bullish\n\n\ud83d\ude80 It's safer to buy in the second half of the trading day; personally, I usually buy in the last 3 hours and again in the last 5 minutes before market close\n\n If today's red, the closest trendline support + fib extension is at $15.92. Keeping pocket money in the unlikely case it drops that low wouldn't hurt\n\nWeekly highs resistance since the last cycle is at $20.67, after that the sky is the limit.\n\n\u25b6 Q3 earnings expectations?\n\n\ud83d\ude80 If their guidance shows a stronger focus on e-commerce rather than brick-and-mortar stores, we'll surely see a pump, as that would kill every GME = Blockbuster shorter's theory. Bullish.\n\n\ud83d\ude80 If they don't mention that and the price dumps, Cohen might step in and increase his stake, finally guiding GME into the 21st century. That would be a major squeeze catalyst. Bullish.\n\nThe earnings that matter the most though, are in Q4 (March 2021). They will show what a e-commerce powerhouse GME has become.\n\nThat said, I'm personally holding through earnings, hoping for a dump and a takeover by Cohen.\u00a0 \"Worst\" case scenario the price pumps and I can't load up at cheaper prices. \nThat's why I'd rather have an amount of shares I'm happy with before earnings.\n\n\u25b6 When do I cash out?\n\nRealistically, whenever you're happy with the profits you've made.\n\n\ud83d\ude80 The price peaked around $60s and the mid $50s in the last two console cycles, respectively. Now that GME has a modern business model it can be safely guessed that it can reach at least previous highs\n\n\ud83d\ude80 No one can tell how high the price will be with the squeeze. I can tell you it's gonna be $200 if that makes you wet your pants, but that'd be wishful thinking cause, again, I can't guess how high it will be. $50 is already a good enough PT for me\n\nThat said, I'm happy I feel safe holding shares through ER, for once. \n\nI wish you all the greasiest tendies.

        "selftext": "Sup retards, I am writing this to share what I learned in my small time of investing and trading till now. Of course there are a lot of retards here who are less retarded than I am, and so know more about investing than I do. This is partly to keep a note to myself (and make it public), so I don't repeat the same mistakes again. And partly to give some pointers to those here who are more retarded than me.\n\n1. This is something you would already know. There are a lot of people here posting 1000+% gains in a few weeks/months. But there are a lot lot more than that who are not making that, and in fact losing. I know you know that as well. So don't fucking get jealous and play stupid gambles (like buying fucking nikola at fucking 79$). You are already a retard, you already have a disadvantage compared to those outside. Don't let your emotions get the better of you as well.\n2. Pre-market is fucked up. Never buy a gamble stock just by seeing high pre-market rise. You will almost always lose. \n3. You're new to WSB, you are seeing people posting a lot of tickers that are going to be the next NIO or the next PLUG. Don't go buying all those ticker. When someone posts a DD, don't just scroll down and comment 'All I read was buy' and buy the stock. Do your own DD.\n4. (This may not apply to all) Try to limit the number of stocks you're holding to a minimum. Diversification is good but make sure you're not going overboard (like having only 2000$ to invest/trade and buying 40 tickers with that). Even if all those 40 stocks are hot growth stocks, you're not gonna make a lot of money because a lot of them WILL go down. Buy the stocks in which you feel confident that they will go up in some time. Don't buy something just because it has been going up a lot and everyone is saying it'll go up.\n5.  Hold what you've bought for some time if you believe in the stocks short term/ long term capability. Don't sell it as soon as you're down some 5-10%. If you do that you'll just be buying high selling low all the stocks. As a personal example: I really believe in Unity's business and capability. I bought unity at 95, but got scared when it fell down to 86, then, as soon as it hit 95 again I sold. I was stupid, Now unity is 150. Believe in yourself more than some random retards on WSB.\n6. I have made more money when hyped stock fall, compared to when hyped stocks rise. Invest in what seems safer (and can give good returns as well). For ex. when pfizer vaccine news came out, Shopify and Zoom fell like crazy. Even though I feel Zoom stock valuation is sooooo fucking stupid, I bought the dip and sold both the stocks just yesterday for about 20-30% gains on both. - This is really subjective, but I like this more compared to investing in PLTR at 30 or NIO at 50 (By the way I have positions in both of them and am about 100% up on both, so PLTR, NIO to moon). Remember that losses are also big in high growth stocks just like gains.\n7. Keep a fucking target of how much return youre looking for. Dont get distracted by posts every day on WSB posting their 1000+% returns. You need 25-30% return a year to get rich eventually (this is just my personal target). Have a separate account for trading where you've trying to get crazy gains (and actually getting crazy losses), and keep the amount in that account minimum.\n\nI know all this is just a repeat and my post may just get removed. Who cares.\n\nFinally, even though everyone in WSB is a retarded autist and they just jack off to their gains and other's losses. I've learned a lot from posts in this sub. And this is also a really good sub for discovering stocks to do DD on. Many other positives of WSB, just not mentioning them here.\n\nHappy trading/investing.",

        "selftext": "Reading through some of the posts I can see how a lot of newbies have FOMO (fear of missing out). Post after post of losers making huge returns. Everyone is getting rich but you. Boofuckinghoo. The smart investor realizes it\u2019s all hype. Some of it works, most of it doesn\u2019t. To be successful you need to be able to recognize the difference and to do that, you need time, knowledge and practice.\n\nHere are ten tips that can help you along the way.\n\nTip 1 - You don\u2019t know shit\n\nYou\u2019re going to lose your money. Don\u2019t get suckered by reading posts about guys who made 1000% return in 5 minutes. For every one guy that posts his massive gains, 100+ suckers have lost their money. The first lesson to realize is that it\u2019s way easier to lose money in the market than to make money.\n\nTip 2 - Understand how money flows in the market\n\nMoney moves from the idiots to the knowledgable, from the impatient to the patient. Any dummy can make money short term. But to make money long-term and truly grow a portfolio, you have to be armed with knowledge and a shit ton of patience.\n\nTip 3 - Play for the long term\n\nThe most important rule you need to follow religiously is NEVER FUCKING LOSE MONEY. Print it big, tape it to your wall. Your top responsibility is protecting your capital. YOLO is a stupid play. 99% of you are going to bet at the wrong time with the wrong stock. Calm the fuck down and work on a long term strategy. You have decades dummy.\n\nTip 4 - Time is on your side, but not much else\n\nThe market never stops. The machine just churns and churns. Rich to poor, poor to rich, it just keeps on turning and turning. There are ALWAYS opportunities. Another IPO. Another MEME turd. FOMO is for fools. Miss a run? Big fucking deal. There\u2019s another one around the corner. You have plenty of time to learn, test, and grow your capital.\n\nTip 5 - Paper Trading\n\nPaper trading is a simulation. It behaves exactly like a real account with real active data but it\u2019s all practice. No real money exchanges. It\u2019s a great way to learn, to see how shitty you\u2019re going to do without losing a penny. DO THIS FOR TWO YEARS. Take whatever capital you have right now and buy some long term ETFs or solid ass stocks with minimal risk. Keep adding to it EVERY paycheck. Build up some capital for when you\u2019re ready to trade for real. Take two years to learn how to trade, watch your paper portfolio go to zero a couple dozen times, read and follow the news, WSB, Stocktwits, etc. Ask questions, test out your strategies. You\u2019ll thank me two years from now.\n\nTip 6 - Understand taxes\n\nBig difference between short term and long term capital gains. Uncle Sam loves you short timers. Paying taxes is for suckers.\n\nTip 7 - No one knows shit\n\nThere is no crystal ball, no one has the \u201cinside track\u201d, and only believe 10% of what you read. Be very fucking skeptical. About everything. Social media, analysts, CEOs, news, all if it, be fucking skeptical. It\u2019s all manipulation. Don\u2019t even trust Buffett. You are the guardian of your capital. Everyone wants to take it it away from you. Understand that and you won\u2019t get suckered so easily.\n\nTip 8 - Learn to read fundamentals and understand valuations\n\nAs much as the market today feels like a casino, the underlying foundation of the market is investing, not gambling. With every stock you buy you\u2019re buying a piece of a business. Learn to read fundamentals. Do they make money? Are they growing? Do they have debt? How are their competitors valued? Do they make more money today than they did 5 years ago? How will they make more? How do they return capital to shareholders? And on and on and on. Learn motherfuckers. Earnings per share. P/E rations. Intrinsic value. Net income. Figure out formulas for valuing stocks. Is TSLA worth over 250x earnings? Is WFC undervalued at 13x earnings? Investing blindly because big_dick_loser said so in a post is beyond idiotic. Just burn your money, you\u2019ll have more fun.\n\nTip 9 - Get rich schemes are for suckers\n\nRemove the bookmark for Ferrari. You ain\u2019t getting one anytime soon. Play fucking smart. Go long. Think in decades, not days. You\u2019re not smart enough to day trade and beat the system. Not long-term anyways. Most of you won\u2019t beat the market over 10 years. So be fucking smart. Paper trade until you can consistently prove gains month after month. When you\u2019re ready to trade for real, dip in slowly. Fuck FOMO. Fuck YOLO. Remember, time is on your side. Compound that shit.\n\nTip 10 - Discipline and dedication\n\nLike anything in life, to be successful you have to fucking work at it. Easy money never lasts. Dig in, learn, practice, rinse and repeat. Be motivated to learn how to invest, take the time to study, read, test and constantly improve. Be disciplined with your money. It\u2019s fucking hard to make, easy to lose. Protect that shit.\n\n--\n\nFor those of you this resonates with, you\u2019ll be fine long term. Do the fucking work. For those of you who love chasing the fantasy, good luck, I mean it. It\u2019s a tough fucking pill to swallow watching your account get dwindled down to zero. Nothing tastes worse that losing all your money.\n\nPeace.",

        "selftext": "I have been doubting this for a while but I'm getting a little concerned. Stimulus packages will end at the end of March 2021 here in Australia. In the US, a second 'deeply needed' stimulus is yet to be approved. Whether they approve a second stimulus or not, by the end of this year, what happens after all this stimulus? \u00cc read an article that suggests black Friday sales were up like 22% from last year and shopify claims the average spend of the average consumer was $90. Here in Australia, shops seem to be eerily quite than usual (pre covid) and I'm not seeing people walking around with shopping bags. I wonder, once this stimulus package is over, its not going to change the fact that people have lost their jobs and all the businesses that have shut down. I've heard shopping in America is almost reminiscent of the great depression. If people are holding on to their money rather than spending it, the velocity of money slows down in circulation and this has effect on the stock market. Banks will be shorter on cash if people are literally hoarding. Will this be? What do you think? My portfolio is doing ok at the moment but I'm getting the feeling that as of April next year, there might just be a mass sell off as we will truly start to see the effect of these lockdowns. I'm looking to rearrange my holdings and wondered if anyone had any thoughts about spending behaviors etc.",

        "selftext": "ok Autists\n\nNot really a public markets guy, but I spend a ton of time in private enterprise tech.  Lately I've been deep in log management/SIEM (exciting fucking stuff) and have unearthed a big upside opportunity.  I've already placed my bets so now I'm sharing with you retards so you can pump my numbers.\n\ntl;dr, $SUMO is about to drastically beat expectations on late released q3 earnings because the market appears to have conflated their go forward (rev growth) performance with their deepest doldrum q2 performance.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. Sumo's earnings timing has depressed value.  While almost all other enterprise sales tech have benefited from the release of their Q3 results, Sumo closes quarters a month off. We still haven't seen Sumo's Q3 and their Q3 earnings call is Dec 7\n2. The market was unimpressed by Sumo at IPO because they had really slow growth in Q2, 30%.  However, lots of enterprise sales cycles were delayed in that period.  In that slow quarter, nearly 100% of that growth came from existing customers with almost no net new customers ([Meritech breaks this down](https://www.meritechcapital.com/blog/sumo-logic-ipo-s-1-breakdown)).  Their growth rate in Q1 and the year before was about 50%  I expect they will return to this growth rate in Q3\n3. This all amounts to equity pricing that is wrong two ways: Revenue estimates are off and price multiples are off, all  due to an incorrect expected growth rate in Q3 and forward.  I could probably try to guess how far off they are and set a price target since YoY growth is close to 50% and rev multiple should be closer to 15x+, but nobody's paying me for this, and I just need my tendies to print.\n\nPosition:\n\n$SUMO stonks\n\n$SUMO Dec 18' $35 Call\n\n\"\" $30 Call\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*I don't have any insider information.

        "selftext": "This is a company that I am interested in, here is my research but please do your own DD. Let\u2019s start with the risk factors and then move on to the exciting bits.\n\nLike all companies in this field, components are made in Taiwan and China. However the company is Singaporean company so this may actually be a good thing for their business as the relationship between China and the west becomes more fraught. Razer also heavily relies on the success of the gaming industry, although they are diversifying.\n\nRazer is a founder-led company who are developing a strong ecosystem that combines gaming and fintech with impressively fast growth. They also provide banking services specifically tailored for the youth and millennials worldwide.\n\nAlthough people are saying that Corsair is going to boom in price, Razer shows more growth potential than Corsair. They have a slightly lower market cap ($3.2B compared to $3.4B) and revenue ($911M and $1.47B) but their revenue is growing significantly faster (32% compared to 14% predicted for 2021). Most importantly, they are quickly becoming a significant player in the fintech arena.\n\nRazer Fintech was founded in 2018, is headquartered in Singapore and Malaysia, and is primely situated to supply many emerging markets. It is a leader in offline to online digital payments, where they pay users directly for geographical information that they subsequently use for advertising. \n\nRazer Fintech has submitted its application for the Digital Full Bank License to be issued by the Monetary Authority of Singapore and are considering similar moves in Europe and the US. Razer Fintech will be focusing on the underserved youth and millennials segment for the bid.\n\nRazer Fintech is planning to extend its current fintech offerings to digital banking services by building the world\u2019s first global youth bank, Razer Youth Bank leveraging on the strength of Razer as a lifestyle brand synonymous with the youth and millennials.\n\nOther key numbers and facts: \n\n\u00b7 Founder holds 35% ownership and there is no evidence of any insider selling in the last 12 months.\n\n\u00b7 Cash balance of $586M with zero debt.\n\n\u00b7 The market leader in gaming peripherals and premium (&gt;$1800) gaming laptops.\n\n\u00b7 Monthly active users of their software up over 45% YoY driven by esports and streaming.\n\n\u00b7 Their Razer Gold gaming subscription service has seen an increase of 125% YoY in total payment volume.\n\n\u00b7 114% YoY increase in total payment volume of business-to-business and business-to-consumer digital payments in Southeast Asia.\n\n\u00b7 Their operating expenses have fallen consistently over the last 3 years, not just as a percentage of their revenue (which they have, 40% to 24%), but also in absolute numbers ($133M to $115M).\n\nCorsair is up over 150% since it\u2019s IPO in September but it looks like people still haven\u2019t noticed Razers potential in gaming, esports, and fintech. Now could be the time to jump in on this stock. \n\nPlease be sure to do your own DD and feel free to ask questions.",

This is something the Gaming PC space has not seen at this level before and it shows just how high the demand is for gaming PC\u2019s right now. Stocks like AMD and Nvidia might seem like the best stocks to buy because it\u2019s their parts that are selling out selling out. However they are such big companies and we wont see their prices go to the moon. While I do recommend buying AMD because of their recent leaps in CPU dominance over intel, their new  gaming GPU (6900XT) that is faster than Nvidia for the first time in years (and for 2/3 the price no less) and the fact that they make the Silicon for both the PS5 and new Xbox. I would not expect AMD to moon just became of Christmas Sales, it\u2019s more of a long term play. However With this new spotlight on the PC gaming market, Corsair should see a massive increase in revenue. If you know anything about PC gaming you know the name Corsair. I for one own multiple Corsair products and am very happy with them, which is why I bought Corsair at IPO a few months ago. All kids want this year is Consoles and Gaming PC\u2019s and even professionals have started investing more money into the PC space because they are on their computers all day due to the pandemic. All this crazy demand around the PC space 100% helps Corsair. They are a huge player in the PC market and they make everything from custom water cooling parts for PC enthusiasts to headsets for console gamers. Corsair also owns El Gato. El Gato makes products such as screen capture cards and webcams, things that have seen a huge increase in sales during the pandemic due to their usefulness in online meetings.

They've been filing patents and running tests with mustard-based bio-pesticides\n\n**1.** Proof-of-concept tests with Canada\u2019s National Research Council were successful with their natural non-selective bio-herbicide, something that could be further developed and used to replace Round-Up one day in Europe.\n\n**2.** Lab tests confirmed 100% control of Clubroot spores with their patented mustard. Could be brilliant for Canada's rape/canola industry.\n\n**3.** And their banana test data came back **just right now today**.\n\nIn 2019, Colombia [declared a national emergency](https://www.foodnavigator-latam.com/Article/2019/08/09/Colombia-declares-national-emergency-as-TR4-banana-disease-confirmed#) as the TR4 Panama banana disease his plantations. TR4 is ravaging the industry and threatening the world's banana supply.\n\nMustGro sent off their mustard spray to Colombian government lab for testing with the results expected back in Q4 2020. They press released today:\n\n*Using ICA official protocols, all plate samples treated with MustGrow\u2019s natural organic biopesticide showed 100% control of Fusarium wilt TR4.\u00a0 Five different rates were tested, each showing 100% disease control.\u00a0 In comparison, control samples (without MustGrow\u2019s technology) showed Fusarium wilt TR4 was still vibrant and growing.\u00a0 All data was assessed after a 5-day period.*\n\n*Further testing will determine whether MustGrow\u2019s patented biopesticide technology will control Fusarium wilt TR4 in greenhouse and field settings.\u00a0 Fusarium wilt TR4 is the most destructive banana disease, affecting particularly Cavendish bananas, which are half of all bananas produced globally.\u00a0 Currently, there are no effective treatments for infected banana plantations, with the disease remaining viable in soil for decades and can cause* *100% yield loss**.*\n\n[https://ceo.ca/@newsfile/mustgrow-banana-disease-results-in-colombia-100-control](https://ceo.ca/@newsfile/mustgrow-banana-disease-results-in-colombia-100-control)\n\nThe company was a complete speculative bet for me. I like it because despite being in the research phase, the financials still look good. They started up with their own money and low/no interest government agricultural loans and grants. They have more cash than debt.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/chijr7rwsk261.png?width=678&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bf3d9122c64e3df2ffd7367d77653ebdce165c1b\n\nLarge insider ownership and directors who continue to buy in to a company is my favourite sign with pennystocks, and these guys keep putting money in:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/k87g1s77tk261.png?width=1186&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9ba96b5720711ce2ccc8450c18f9b52f79a29e17\n\nI'm sure it's a long way away to develop the product and bring it to market, or maybe their plan is to secure the patents and then get acquired. Either way, I'm in.\n\nI bought 887 shares at C$0.65 before this banana data came back. I'll be buying in more today.  I feel like putting mustard on bananas is the future.",

This was roughly 55% shares at a $26 price average, and 45% calls split between ITM and OTM.\n\nMicron held an earnings report later that day and the results were much better than expected. Micron delivered, skyrocketing afterhours over 10%. Marty woke up the next morning up over $600,000.\n\nWhat made this even more impressive is that Marty was not some ultra-rich billionaire with a highly diversified portfolio of assets. No. Micron was the only company he owned, and this was his entire portfolio.\n\n\u201cAh, well, I've only owned $MU or its derivatives for almost two years. I swing traded $AMD a little fall of 2016 but essentially that's all $MU\u201d\n\nMarty continued to hold positions in Micron over the next year, and his account reached a peak value of $2,500,000 from his original $200,000 in September 2015. A 1200% gain.\n\nMarty wasn\u2019t finished though, the money, the shitposting, the endless call outs of Jim Cramer on twitter (@MartyMoho) wasn\u2019t enough for him and in true wallstreetbets fashion, he needed more.\n\nOn March 22nd, 2018 Marty bet all $2,300,000 on $MU calls set to expire over the course of the next several months, a majority being OTM. $MU was trading at $54 that day, and his strikes were all between $50-$80.\n\nMarty remained optimistic as $MU hovered around the same price over the next several months. But on August 30th, 2018 Marty started losing hope. On this day he made his final ever comment on reddit:\n\n\u201cI don't know, I expected at least a partial run-up but it's not materializing at all. If it doesn't pop after ER like it did this time last year, I'm pretty f'd\u201d\n\n$MU was trading at $53 when he made that comment, theta was killing him. But it didn\u2019t get any better for Marty. $MU fell 40% over the next few months, all the way to $30 as his calls were expiring. $2.3 million lost, as the strikes were so far out of the money that even if he had sold, it would have been too late. They were worthless.\n\nThat was the last comment Marty ever made online, his Reddit, Twitter, and Stocktwits all stopped being active between August 30th and 31st, 2018. No one knows for sure what happened to him, but the speculation remains. One thing is for certain though. As quickly as he rose, he fell, and the legend of Marty is now just that \u2013 a legend.",

        "selftext": "So I posted up my DD on this little company back \\~ 6 months ago, and believe a short squeeze would happen if tutes decided this was a company worth a shit once again.  Looks like my posts worked they did their DD and piled the F into this company....  The shorts are now fuk'd and here's what it looks like now (bottom vs when I first posted.)   The bad news for the shorts here is the company will be PRing \\~ 3 times this week, wed thurs and friday.  \n\nThey already made this info available to the public in weeks prior, shorts are betting it's bad news but the company has pre announced them to all occur 1 day before their new drug launch... during FDA approval and 1 day after FDA approval. (does this sound familiar?  This is what happened with VW 3 PR's set the stock price into infinity at shorts cost.) \n\nNow why this matters: Shorts are out of their league, period.  The price stayed too low and made it too easy to accumulate a severely undervalued company.\n\nThe stage: Of the trading shares on the market (57 million) 37 million are on loan from shorts which surpass the 100% float mark and badly.  If all of the open market decided to trade their shares to the shorts (\\~ 17 million) the shorts would still have 20 million shares to make up the difference.  This means hedge funds and big institutions can name their own price, this is the literally the same stage setup that caused VW's massive infinity squeeze to become the most valuable company in the world for a few days.\n\n[TL;RD?

        "selftext": " **$GMHI $LAZR** Things could get very interesting here. I have a feeling the young scholar CEO Russel has a major trick up his sleeve. Here is a list of upcoming conferences:  \n\n\n**Goldman Sachs Global Automotive Conference**  \nDate: December 4, 2020  \nPresentation Time: TBC  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ei79oqvd2k261.jpg?width=1439&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=17ec60d0d1349658d83710fbbccc102a39470b78\n\nMacquarie Next Generation Automotive Technologies Corporate Day (Japan)  \nDate: December 7, 2020 (December 8, 2020 in Japan)  \nPresentation Time: 5:30 p.m. PT / 8:30 p.m. ET  \n\n\nBarclays Global Technology Conference  \nDate: December 9, 2020  \nPresentation Time: 8:30 a.m. PT / 11:30 p.m. ET  \n\n\nThe Goldman Sachs conference couldn't be a better place to drop some massive news. CEO already admitted the next big partner will be announced soon. With the merger going through in the next few days and a cluster of large conferences simultaneously, I think it's safe to say Russell is going to drop the bombshell this week, to maximize on the PR. (That's what I would do).  \n\n\nHere is where it gets very intriguing. There is chatter that it could be NIO. And IMHO, that is a very real possibility. Not sure about the accuracy, but this article states they are Luminar and Nio are \"partners\". \"Bear in mind that Luminar has partnered with around 50 automakers, including NIO.\"  \n\n\n[https://wccftech.com/nio-may-be-able-to-outpace-teslas-autopilot-feature-if-it-integrates-the-lidar-offered-by-luminar-technologies/](https://wccftech.com/nio-may-be-able-to-outpace-teslas-autopilot-feature-if-it-integrates-the-lidar-offered-by-luminar-technologies/)  \n\n\nNow we also know that Mobileye, who Luminar just signed a massive deal with, also is partnered with NIO.  \n\n\n[https://newsroom.intel.com/news/mobileye-nio-partner-bring-level-4-autonomous-vehicles-consumers-china-beyond/#gs.m9r01p](https://newsroom.intel.com/news/mobileye-nio-partner-bring-level-4-autonomous-vehicles-consumers-china-beyond/#gs.m9r01p)  \n\n\nAnd look at this hidden gem I found. One of the main software engineers at Luminar, formerly worked at NIO as well.  \n\n\n[https://www.linkedin.com/in/sripathivenky/?fbclid=IwAR2zP2sz4YCdYsZFN\\_HsAB4kwkl8greWkLVmxbFNnbK4xqwCuBv83YhIV8w](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sripathivenky/?fbclid=IwAR2zP2sz4YCdYsZFN_HsAB4kwkl8greWkLVmxbFNnbK4xqwCuBv83YhIV8w)  \n\n\nIMHO I don't think it's out of the realm of possibility that Luminar might be announcing a partnership with NIO. If so, I will adjust my price target to $55. (Not saying it will maintain that price, but on hype I could see it).  \n\n\nAll IMHO and best of luck. I am long $GMHI / $LAZR",

        "selftext": "\nRecent posts have been right last week on GME and Dollar General now onto the next play. Global Carrier is a HVAC/Refrigerator company. Best in the business. IPO was back in April. Gradual incline over the past few months with no little downward movement. Company has been meeting and exceeding earnings every time. Small divined of payment not a lot but still something. But the real sauce...When Moderna and Pfizer get approval next week from FDA which is going to happen the distribution is going to be complicated. The one company that can handle a majority of this is right here. Guarantee the government will back distribution in America and will pay a huge amount for this to happen safety and effectively. Won\u2019t be a bidding war they will choose the best company and that CARR. Other countries will do the same especially in Europe and this company is world wide. Price target is 45$ or more by December 18th. Why is this important. Options are cheap due to low IV. That is all. Also volume picked up yesterday so good sign?\nhttps://www.carrier.com/carrier/en/worldwide/news/news-article/new_carrier_pods_monitored_by_sensitech_provide_mobile_cold_storage_solutions_for_covid_19_vaccine_distribution.html",

Now 1 percent fee doesn't cost anything compared to 120\u20ac. Are spreads truly such a big deal as I see it? \nAre there brokers that don't have spreads, or at least very tight ones?
