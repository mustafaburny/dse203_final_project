With dollar signs in my eyes I tried my hardest to unlock the green RH theme buying $ROPE and $CSV like the memes said, but I was #redgang until all my savings were gone. So I studied all the DD posts for months, made new savings, and set out to lose that too. I found a JavaScript machine learning tutorial on YouTube and got to work, mostly watching tendie porn on wsb every few minutes to refresh my false sense of hope.\n\nNow my script is finished, using machine learning on every DD thread I could find, analyzing the resistance, taking into account I, II, III, IV crush groups like they said, and cross referencing the greeks against fibonacci sequencing models. Everything I could possibly learn from WSB, I fed into the machine learning script so it generates a list of the top 69,420 positions on the market every time I open Internet Explorer. Then I inversed the list order, flipped the strike projections, watched The Big Short for the 3rd time that morning, and started trading. This shitter bot then somehow pulled off three consecutive weeks of 100% returns paper trading, so I decided to share the automated autism with you broke fucks so we can all lose our money together. For you retards, $5K +25% weekly compounded is a million in 24 weeks.\n\nHere are the positions for this week, selected by Retard Bot on Monday:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[I should flair this shit as DD.](https://preview.redd.it/ypt8ubl0xay41.png?width=1000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bd3980d41aff851b55848a1fa57e0c8c981e3c67)\n\nCRM 187.5c 6/26 | projections:\n\n* $198 @ exp\n* \\+69% tendies\n\nCRM 200c 7/17 | projections:\n\n* $212 @ exp\n* \\+214% tendies\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Here's to drinking away our losses.](https://preview.redd.it/2f4d4bd2xay41.png?width=1000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=af96b8d99da6e13f06b9a2a47619eb05d984b0ef)\n\nCLX 200c 7/17 | projections:\n\n* $228 @ exp\n* \\+124% tendies\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Recession who?](https://preview.redd.it/bh4af0s3xay41.png?width=1000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1a5f2896d7ac21f04d0953953cd54e5ef80bd861)\n\nRNG 320c 7/17\n\n* ???\n* idk\u2026 the script stopped giving projections around this point\n\nTECH 280c 7/17\n\n* stonks only go up\n* what does DD actually stand for?\n\nTECH 330c 7/17\n\n* cool name\n* saw a vaguely positive blog post on it\n\nHD 260c 7/17\n\n* if this works my dad might finally understand RH is not a gambling addiction\n* GUH\n\nWhy do I trust these positions? What do I know about them? Absolutely fucking nothing. The bot could literally pick positions at random and make more tendies than me. Who fucking cares.\n\nSo yeah, thank you autists for all the meme positions. At least you gay fucks make the losses worth it. I\u2019ll be posting every friday with POV RH porn of returns for the positions here and mondays with new positions. According to my script\u2019s projections of upcoming high efficiency SPY IV crush waves I\u2019ll be at 1Mil tendies in 6 months, so enjoy calling me a retard, send gay emojis, and feel free to share the loot.\n\nAiming for 3% weekly with the bot, which, for you  \ud83c\udf08 \ud83d\udc3b s that failed 4th grade math, would turn $25K into 30 million dollars in 5 years. Since we're in a stupid synthetic JPOW bull-market rn, I think this thing's gonna keep printing 100% weekly for a while.",

Feel free to ask below if you have any questions.\n\n\\#1 They blew Q4 2019 earnings out of the water.  151% YoY growth in their enterprise business.  Spiked 20% and the covid-19 market crash happened literally the next day.\n\n\\#2 they've followed $SPY pretty closely since then and has been on a tear since the beginning of this week but are still well below the $21 high they hit in February.\n\n\\#3  I was doing the math on their user numbers last night. They have such a a larger active user base that the up sell on just 2% would nearly double their enterprise revenue and their enterprise revenue was already 21% of overall revenue.\n\n\\#4 Covid-19 has had little (arguably no) impact on Survey Monkeys current pipelines, if anything, it has increased it.  That\u2019s why the flat growth QoQ being projected is a little boggling.  How can you increase sales and marketing and get 2 acquisitions last year and still be flat on revenue QoQ... All while having 770K paid users to tap into and cross-sell and up sell across 335K different organizations\n\n\\#5  Look at their integrations, their 10k reflects  that\u2019s 100% what they are focused on.Those integrations lead to enterprise sales and stickiness - and they can command price.  They had 6500 enterprise customers in q4 2019 - the remaining addressable market is massive and not in any way decreased by COVID-19,\n\n\\#6  When I look at the compeitors for survey monkey, I think yeah I\u2019ve used it, it sucks it\u2019s not scalable doesn\u2019t map over seemlessly to my CRM or I have to spend $100k on consultants and research firms. Survery monkey fills a very solid niche and they appear to do it really well.  Anectdotally, I am working in COVID-19 relief and have had to do more surveys / analysis / community feedback tpye shit than ever before and a majority of them have been on Survey Monkey.\n\nvolume is low right now so I would suggest not buying OTM calls if you don't have the capital to actually execute.  If you do, $20/$25 June/July calls are dirt cheap.  ITM calls are priced appropriately and will be much easier to offload once it spikes AH.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntldr; $SVMK 7/17 $20c // 7/17 $15c",

        "selftext": "Trading options during earnings season definitely adds to the intensity level, but makes it very interesting and rewarding. Yesterday I bought a 120 TWLO 5/22 p @5.30. I also bought a 135 TWLO c @ 6.10. Now, I have been buying calls in TWLO from 90 and up in the past month. I thought the recent run up provided for a difficult earnings season. However, I bought the call around 12:30pm because I didn\u2019t want to miss a potential pop. Got lucky. In retrospect I shouldn\u2019t have even bought the Put, but a little protection is fine if it fell hard. I sold the C this morning for a $2800 profit. The news was so good on TWLO, that I also bought an OTM, at the time, 165 C later on the day. Up another $1200 unrealized. \n\nI had 8 UBER calls. My strategy was to sell all if UBER traded above 30 in the AM which I did. After I had time to digest LYFTs report, I bought 4 ITM 28 UBER back. Still holding. \n\nROKU was another great holding of mine. However, I sold all three deep ITMs before the close because I was up over 6k from them. I did buy one OTM 145 C. Gone. \n\nI\u2019m a huge believer in SQ so I picked up 5 ITMs today. Granted, I sold all 10 ITM calls yesterday before earnings. I held 3 ITM PYPLs. I thought Square May have bad earnings based on the pre earnings trade and PYPL would be good. The markets could easily sell a stock no matter how good the earnings, INTC. AMZN, AMD for example but I held my PYPLs. \n\nAlso, during the day I kept buying and adding to my SBUX ITM C positions and bought more CRM options on the strength of TWLOs report. I\u2019m also holding several other positions. Very good day overall!! \n\nI\u2019m looking to create a good group discussion to bounce trade ideas and strategies. I welcome other successful trade stories! I\u2019m happy to help others also. As I said numerous times, I am a strong confident directional trader. Most of all, be patient, learn from your mistakes, take calculated risks and stay mentally strong. Good luck!!",

        "selftext": "First off, I authentically want to say that I am trying to help people better their trading skills and think of option trading in a different light. I am happy to help, answer questions and even after many years of trading, I\u2019m still excited and always learning. \n\nI was holding roughly a 80/20% call / put portfolio. As the S&amp;P was pushing up to resistance, barring some bad virus news, I felt the bias was to the upside. Advancers vs decliners, overall participation and sentiment led me to believe we were / are heading higher. Even with the dreaded jobs report coming out Friday morning, it seems people were expecting the worst, so I felt it was baked in for now. \n\nAfter Musks outburst, I had traded OTM TSLA calls well, and my gut told me it wanted to break over 800. At around 795, I bought 1 OTM TSLA 830 5/29. Still holding up $3000. I also added to my TWLO c as I think its hitting 190-200 on a push. I noticed the strength in DIS and BA and felt early on Friday morning that an overall positive market tone was in place for the day. So I bought more ITM SBUX and NKE. I had been accumulating PENN, around 20 ITM c that I unloaded for a 80% profit, but if the MMA fight night proves to be what I think is a winner, sports, DIS. Gaming and indirectly casinos could benefit from pent up demand for live action so I may rebuy Monday. I also added to my stock in CRM, DKNG and calls. Very Good Friday! \n\nI firmly believe that as more and more companies announce reopening, albeit with minimum capacity and utilizing safety measures,  it will be perceived positively. DIS opened Shanghai theme park with a max of 30% occupancy and it sold out in 3 minutes. Towards the end of the trading day, Apple announced they were going to open many of their stores next week in select areas. I bought 3 more AAPL ITMs \n\nWhen trading options, you have to go with your gut and you have to be quick. Don\u2019t overthink the trade. I cannot stress enough how important the timing is for entry and exit. If you are just trying to scalp or hedge then it\u2019s a different story, but If you truly want to make or have the potential to make substantial money off your trades, you have to always be listening to the news, time your trades well, and watch them throughout the trading day. Very important! Good luck! I hope all your trades are well Thought out and timed well.",

        "selftext": "When I saw everyone shitting on Zoom as an undifferentiated hype stock at WSB, figured there may be a contrarian play, so started doing some digging. Just my view - disclosure, obviously long shares and calls, a few FDs included. Earnings coming up in early June and think there's 2-3x price appreciation potential in the next 6-12 mos. \n\nTLDR: Zoom undervalued at anything less than $200 a share as market discounting new subscribers. Sorry for the bullet formatting, I tried. \n\nHigh level thesis: \n*\tMarket underestimating the impact of daily participants growth from 10MM/day at end of 2019 to 300MM/day as of early April\n*        \tWhile education and other venues have received free access, this does not explain the broader growth. There are 60-70MM people in US at school age. Assuming 25% using Zoom at 5x instances a day, that yields 80-100MM of the 290MM growth from education\n*      \tBoth new and existing enterprise Zoom users have likely rapidly increased adoption in the last 90 days, adding more paying users per company than previously assumed (e.g., a firm with 50 employees that may have shared 4-5 licenses or used a free version is now ramping usage)\n*\tHigh free cash flow, subscription revenue business provides visibility into earnings potential on an annualized, runrate basis\n*      \tSubscription based model that is a small cost per employee, especially compared to traveling for in person meetings (e.g., annual subscription a fraction of the cost of one business trip per year)\n*      \tMarket will price ZM on a quarterly runrate basis derived from paying users, which will be reported in early June along with MD&amp;A on new users through that date\n*\tContinued COVID issues will drive subscription and paying user growth\n*      \tEarly state reopenings will drive companies to delay return to work and travel due to risks of virus continuing to circulate (e.g., many financial firms banning travel until 2021); consensus for a 2nd wave in the 2H of 2021\n*      \tDespite reopenings, dual income households unable to go to work due to childcare constraints as schools, daycares, and camps closed until the fall or beyond\n*      \tCOVID accelerating long term shift toward remote working; commercial air travel to remain challenged for next 6-12 months (Evercore surveys point to investors\u2019 belief that business travel does not recover until 2H2021) further entrenching people being comfortable working from home or doing remote meetings\n*\tCompetitive moat built through brand, GUI, and early mover advantage\n*      \tZoom is a name brand in the business community; technology not just an app but becomes entrenched in conference room set-ups, internal company procedures and IT stack\n*      \tCost of service is de minimis for recent competitive activity from Google or Facebook to matter ($120/user/year not worth behavioral change/shift requirements)\n*      \tZM preferred due to GUI, user friendliness (prior to it being banned, Google\u2019s own employees overwhelmingly preferred Zoom and company considered buying Zoom)\n*      \tOther larger tech companies have challenges in switching Zoom users (FB: personal privacy and bridge to enterprise applications; GOOG: niche user base and need to be in GOOG ecosystem; MSFT: clunky user interface embedded in complex Teams universe, slow to roll out upgrades)\n\nIn terms of the risks / bear case for the story, common questions and concerns are the following:\n\n*\tValuation too high: \u201c1000 PE,\u201d \u201cridiculous revenue multiple\u201d to be addressed shortly. Net net there is visibility into near term runrate $2B in annualized EBITDA, which at a 50x multiple (appropriate given growth), implies substantial price upside\n*\t\u201cMuh competition\u201d: addressed above. Solutions provided by FB are geared toward social users (who are not paying and ZM doesn\u2019t want anyway); MSFT is too clunky and ZM viewed as a complementary application; GOOG: not everyone wants a gmail account and even Google\u2019s own employees prefer Zoom. Thankfully for the bull case, all these threats are now out in the open and \u201cpriced in\u201d\n*\tAll the growth will go away post COVID: 1) COVID not going away anytime soon (see: second wave, mutations, too early openings, residual fears; 2) post conversion, video conferencing will still be used, particularly to save on corporate travel and will replace conference calls that were done prior to COVID. Additionally, companies will want this capability in place for risk mitigation/business continuity. Given this, the subscription users will stay in place and continue to convert from free users 3) the education (K-12/college) users who will go away weren\u2019t paying and will plant seeds for future growth as they join the workforce 4) the growth in users was 30x in the course of 30-60 days\n*\t\u201cMuh security concerns and Zoom bombing\u201d: acquisition of KeyBase + Eric\u2019s 90 day plan appears to be allaying concerns. Separately, the security concerns appear to be hyped up by competitors vs. actual threats \u2013 a number of reputable firms continue to onboard Zoom and NYC schools has reversed its decision. Just note that FB channeled Russian hackers on its platform that changed the outcome of US elections and appears to not effect its valuation. \n\nValuation: the gutcheck \u2013 stock has appreciated ~2x pre-COVID though daily participants have grown 30x. All else being equal, market is discounting a substantial portion of upside growth. However, it is important to note that FYQ2 (the next quarter being reported for period ending 4/30) will not nearly reflect the runrate performance given most of the recent surge happened late in the quarter. \n\n*\tContext of where we are and what we know about the numbers\n**\tIn the most recent quarter ending January, Zoom generated $188MM in revenue and $10MM of EBITDA. It is important to note that Zoom operates at 82-83% gross margin (that means each incremental dollar generates 80 cents of profit or EBITDA assuming no scale up of backoffice and overhead). Said differently, it is very cheap for Zoom to support incremental user growth as is with most software/subscription businesses\n**\tOn an annualized basis pre-COVID, Zoom was generating roughly $800MM in revenue and $40MM of EBITDA. The low EBITDA margins are due to the SG&amp;A/overhead that has yet to be (but soon will be) leveraged\n**\tExiting the most recent quarter, Zoom had 10MM daily participants, which translates into ~$75 of annualized revenue per daily participant (includes both paying and non-paying participants). Note that this 10MM includes those who used the platform for free prior to COVID, so if the same mix of paying and non-paying participants continued, you\u2019d see an unbelievably large ramp in revenue and earnings\n**\tZoom grew to 200MM daily participants in early April, then 300MM toward the end of April\n**\tObviously, you can\u2019t just take the 300MM x $75 a year factor, which would translate into $24B in annualized revenue \u2013 it is likely a larger percentage of free users joined, including college and K-12 students. The question is what %? That\u2019s what I will lay out below. \n\n*\t Valuing the growth potential \u2013 anything less than $200/share is drastically undervaluing Zoom\n**\tThe question is then of the 290MM new daily participants, how closely does that match to the profile of the preexisting 10MM daily participants. That is what we will then apply the $80/annualized revenue figure\n**\tBeing conservative, let\u2019s just assume 20%. That implies 58MM out of the 290MM new daily participants that match the mix of paying/non-paying as pre-COVID users and that the rest of the 230MM will not pay at all\n**\tThat yields to an INCREMENTAL annualized revenue figure of $4.4B ($75/year x 58MM)\n**\tBack to our gross margin point, Zoom generates 82-83% gross margins\n**\tInstead of doing a straight calculation on that as flow through, let\u2019s assume another 20-25% cost on the incremental revenue in additional SG&amp;A as well as costs to serve the incremental free users\n**\t$4.4B x 60% = $2.2B in annualized operating profit (EBITDA)\n**\tSo how do we value ZM on that basis? Question is comparable TEV / EBITDA multiples for fast growing software/SAAS businesses:\n***\tCRM: 55x LTM EBITDA (35% revenue growth), 8x revenue (more mature, lower margin biz)\n***   TDOC: not profitable; 20x LTM Revenue\n***\tDOCU: not profitable, 20x LTM Revenue\n***\tTWLO: not profitable, 17x LTM Revenue\n**\tAssuming a 15x revenue multiple for ZM on runrate revenue ($5B total runrate) = $75B TEV, or $250 share price on 300M shares\n***\tAssuming a 50x EBITDA multiple like CRM: $108B TEV, or $360 share price\n***\tAssuming a 30x EBITDA multiple: $65B TEV, $215 share price\n**\tNow, assume 50x EBITDA and what the value would be if greater than 20% of the new users looked like the profile of Zoom\u2019s existing users, should it be 30 or 50%: \n***\t30%: $580/share at 50x EBITDA, $350/share at 30x\n***\t50%: $1,015/share at 50x, $600/share at 30x, $400/share at 20x (at larger TEV, multiple will be lower as more growth has been realized\n\nSo there you have it. Maybe informative, maybe one of the most retarded things you've read in a while. Take your pick.",

        "selftext": "**BBSI Description:**\n\nBarrett Business Services, Inc. provides HR consulting, staffing, and payroll functions for small and medium sized businesses in 29 states across the US. There are two ways they generate revenue: Professional Employer Services (PEO) and Staffing and Recruiting. Most of their revenue (87%) comes from PEO where they provide a suite of corporate functions for small businesses. They establish a co-employment relationship with each client company and assume responsibility for payroll functions, payroll taxes, and workers\u2019 compensation claims. They have over 7,200 PEO clients in 2019 across 29 states utilizing 64 different branch locations.\n\n [US map with Barrett Branch locations](https://www.reddit.com/user/jamnormal/comments/gdzoc3/barrett_branches_2019/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=link)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Business Model:**\n\nBBSI helps small businesses grow by allowing them to outsource a task with high administrative burden. For many small businesses, payroll and administrative tasks are a fixed costs through HR employee salaries. PEO clients are billed for a percentage of client payroll, with the gross amount invoiced including direct payroll costs, employer payroll-related taxes, workers\u2019 compensation coverage, and a service fee. By charging a percent of wages at the client firm, they help their clients by turning their former fixed cost administrative services into variable costs based on wages. PEO revenue is reported net of direct payroll costs, such as salaries, wages, and health insurance because BBSI is not the primary obligor for these payments, their clients are. \u201cIndirect\u201d payroll costs, such as payroll taxes and benefits and Workers\u2019 Compensation expenses make up the bulk of operating costs.\n\n\nThe key to understanding BBSI\u2019s financial statements comes down to establishing the co-employment relationship with their clients. BBSI\u2019s primary operating expenses are Direct Payroll costs (10% of 2019 revenue), Payroll taxes and Benefits (46%), and Workers\u2019 Compensation (22%). These three costs are passed entirely onto clients. Direct Payroll costs are related to their staffing business, while the latter two expenses are related to PEO clients. In addition to billing these above expenses, BBSI includes a service fee that is based on the total wages of employees. Their operating income can be simplified down to the service fee less their own corporate SG&amp;A expenses. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Competition:**\n\nImplementing HR and admin solutions has become a big business for big businesses, but the small business market has had less focus from large players. Paychex &amp; Salesforce both provide tech suites aimed at larger companies and white collar firms. Barrett\u2019s average client size is roughly 30 employees, and the focus is on blue and gray collar firms.\nFocusing on small business PEO, the main competition is TriNet Group Inc (TNET) and Insperity Inc(NSP). Focusing on geographical growth is the major differentiating strategy factor that Barrett uses to succeed in the PEO market. Focusing on conversions from internal HR departments, a substitute good for PEO, they achieve more aggressive pricing while still having net client ads quarter over quarter. Since 2016, their client base has grown at roughly 13.7% per year. The strength of growing geographically using branches allows them to fully flex their network of new clients from referral partners and clients.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Why is it a good buy now?**\n\n\n\u2022\t**Barrett is trading at a significant discount to their historical trading valuations, as well as at discounts relative to their PEO peers.** After Q4\u201919, they reduced 2020 guidance on the eve of the full COVID pandemic, leading to a cool reception from the street. Alone, this would not be enough to feel it as a discount considering the significant impact COVID will have on their business. However, they also trade at a significant discount to their PEO peers while simultaneously leading their PEO peer group in FCF yield.\n\n\nFirm | EV/FCF | P/E| FCF Yield | Net Debt/EBITDA\n---|---|----|----|----\nBarrett Business Services Inc (BBSI) | 3.73 | 7.18 | 19.3% | N/A\nTriNet Group Inc (TNET)* | 7.44 | 14.08 | 14.5% | 0.77\nInsperity Inc (NSP)* | 11.65 | 13.34 | 8.5% | N/A\n\n^*Comparisons ^are ^made ^for ^same ^periods. ^While ^TNET ^and ^NSP ^have ^reported ^Q1\u201920 ^earnings, ^it ^makes ^more ^sense ^to ^compare ^the ^same ^period ^for ^all ^three ^firms\n\n\n\u2022\t**Barrett has a strong balance sheet consisting of a negative net debt position, giving them significant leeway in weathering the COVID pandemic storm.** Less than 10% of their TEV being made up of interest-bearing debt, they are sitting pretty when it comes to weathering this storm. At some points during the business cycle it feels silly to start financial analysis at the balance sheet, but during a recession is not one of those times. With so few financial obligations, they are expected to trim corporate SG&amp;A and investment in their new technology platform to keep more cash within the firm. Barrett stands a high chance of making it out the other side with a low chance of bankruptcy.\n\n\u2022\t**Focusing on growth from a geographical perspective, Barrett\u2019s management has carved out a small business niche that has seen success in their ability to open new branches.** Focusing on small businesses (average client firm size is ~30 employees) gives them an edge over some of the larger payroll companies in the market. Clients typically find BBSI through a strong referral network of both existing clients and external referral partners. Most of BBSI\u2019s new clients are converting from internal HR/admin staff, which allows BBSI to provide a powerful value proposition. They turn small businesses\u2019 fixed cost employee salaries into a variable cost based on total employee wages.\n\n\u2022\t**Quality branch economics shows a model with strong operating leverage and marginal ROIC.** New branches take roughly a 500k investment and take about 5 years to become a mature branch. To be expected, more mature branches have more billing generation and more profit margin contribution. Barrett grows new branches geographically, allowing it to maintain high concentrations in local markets, ramp up the speeds of growth, and reduce fixed costs associated with new regions. Their strategies in opening new branches culminate in an ROIC in 2019 of 30.6%. The IRR on new branches that take 7 years to reach maturity is still more than 150%. \n\n\nBranch Stratification:\n\nNumber of Branches | Size | Run Rate| Average Profit Margin\n---|---|----|----\n18 | Mature | &gt;$100 Mil | ~60%\n20 | Emerging | $30-$100 | ~40%\n26 | Developing | &lt;$30 | ~10%\n64 | Total |  | \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n\nBased on the underlying business model and execution of the management, BBSI seems undervalued. Based solely on their strong balance sheet and large multiple discrepancy between both themselves historically and their fellow PEO peers, they seem like a buy and hold until well after the COVID-19 Crisis has ended. Their business will have the ability to ramp up naturally as their clients begin to hire again and small businesses are looking for a way to outsource admin they may have laid off. In conjunction with their strong branch economics, BBSI is currently undervalued for investors who can take a 3+ year time horizon allowing for the business to recover and their multiple to converge with peers.\nA model has not been completed as Q1\u201920 results have not been released, which will likely contain big indications into how BBSI will perform for the coming quarter and year. A model will be completed, and an update posted once Q1\u201920 data has been released. \nQ1\u201920 is expected to be released 5/5 after market close. In the absence of a model, I have already thoroughly investigated their past few 10-k\u2019s and read through most of their earnings calls over the past few years. I have spent a considerable amount of time insuring I understand how their business and financials tie to one another. To feel comfortable going long this business, I felt the need to dig in and understand it from their branch economics to how their workers\u2019 compensation claims policy works with Chubb.\n\n I am more than happy to discuss the company and delve deeper into the financials of the company if anyone has any questions/comments. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Disclaimer:**\n\nThis is not investment or financial advice and the above thesis is predicated on my opinion &amp; interpretation of the facts mentioned. I am currently long BBSI in my personal portfolio.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Sources:**\n\nSEC Edgar 10-k\u2019s and 10-Q\u2019s\n\nTIKR.com\u2019s Earnings Call Transcripts\n\nPrice and share data from TIKR and Excel add-in feed\n\n\u201cCompetition Demystified\u201d by Bruce Greenald &amp; Judd Kahn for ROIC formula/concepts\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nEdit: added disclaimer",

I did well in the first hour, but my losses halved my gains from that time - and then ran out of free cash.\n\nToday was another hold my breath at open and see where we go - I managed to stay patient and find good entry points. I was tracking OKTA, TWLO, WIX, CODX, and DDOG this morning - and managed to get into good entry points on CODX, TWLO, and DDOG. Unfortunately CODX went the wrong direction and got stopped out quickly in the morning - If I had the cash I was looking at reentering at around 1PM when the MACD crossed - but missed out on those +200% tendies - would've been around $350 additional.\n\nAfter TWLO and DDOG worked out, I got impatient looking for some new plays, and dropped into NVDA, ZM, and got pretty quickly stopped out of those as well, with those losses halving my gains for the day. Glad that I got stopped out of them - but wish I had respected the MACD for NVDA and not gotten in when I did- it was overbought and crossing in the wrong direction.
