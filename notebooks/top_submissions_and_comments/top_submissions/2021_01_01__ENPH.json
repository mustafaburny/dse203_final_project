        "selftext": "Good evening you pieces of shit,\n\nWhy do you keep doubling down on your short positions? Why are new hedge funds are coming in and scooping up new short positions? What the fuck are you shitstains on society doing? Do you understand who we are?\n\nWe don\u2019t fucking play here. We lose money for fucking breakfast. Every day. And then we come back and lose even more fucking money. We buy out of the money weeklies on fucking THURSDAYS. We don\u2019t give a fuck. This is what we do. We do this. We don\u2019t fucking play around. We come here to risk it all. We come here to YOLO our children\u2019s college funds away just to post memes about it.\n\nYour plan was really just to put us in a position where all we have to do is hold SHARES? Say less fam. I haven\u2019t owned a share in four years. I sold AAPL AMD and ENPH calls last week just to buy shares of GameStop and fuck you up as much as possible so we can make memes about it.\n\nDouble down, triple down, quadruple down, take every penny of your rich boomer clients money and put it on the table. Sink the entire already artificially propped up economy over it. We know you will. And because we know you will, we are going to make you do it. Just like the coyote blindly chasing the roadrunner off of a fucking cliff. Chop off your whole head to spite your face. \n\nTake all your boomer ass money and put it on the table. We are here for it. My shares are available for $10,000 before 6 pm today. For every hour after that, Im asking another $250. Go fuck yourself.",

        "selftext": "**TLDR: If you are pretty sure about what the trajectory of the Georgia Senate Runoffs will be, you can make money. Scroll to the bottom for the plays (for each outcome)**\n\n**Introduction:**  \nAlmost everyone on this sub knows QQQ. Now, recall the price action around Nov. 3 (or if you can't because you're that guy from the movie Memento, pull out your Robinhood app and follow along with me kid).  \n\nOn the eve of the general election, when the so-called pollsters said it would be a Democratic sweep, QQQ sat at $269. The next day, with the election contested, QQQ rocketed to $294. It remained steady on Friday, before declining the next week.  \n\nWhy did the election affect the price the way that it did? Well, it's because Biden's legislative agenda depends on Democratic control of Congress. In particular, he can raise corporate taxes with just a simple majority in the Senate.  \n\nThe institutional whales (the folks who actually move markets) believe that:\n- Companies that benefitted bigly from Trump's tax cuts (tech companies especially) will be hurt by Biden raising taxes.\n- Companies that would benefit from fiscal stimulus (green new deal, infrastructure) will be helped by by Biden's plans, and even more if Biden controls Congress.  \n- Regardless of who controls the Senate, the divided nature means some companies are guaranteed to benefit.\n\nDon't take my word for it. Read this report from Goldman Sachs (p.15-16): https://www.goldmansachs.com/insights/pages/beyond-2020-post-election-policies-f/report.pdf   \n\nOriginally, tech companies (facing more regulation and tax increases under the Democratic Trifecta) was trending down. But then, when it became clear the Republicans would hold the Senate and taxes weren't going up, tech stocks soared. Yet, suddenly, there was a small blip downward the next week. Why? Because David Perdue (R) was headed to a runoff, injecting the possibility that Democrats still had a chance to control Congress.  \n\n**Which stocks are impacted, and why**\n\nIf Democrats gain control of the U.S. Senate, that means Biden can pass his legislation.\n- Some companies will be helped bigly (e.g. Renewables)\n- Some companies may be hurt (more taxes) but also helped (more fiscal spending)\n- Some companies may be hurt bigly (more taxes, regs, and less gov't subsidies)\n\n\nTo make this a pure election-related play, we want to trade:\n- companies that benefit bigly from Democratic legislation (and don't have short-term non-political risk)\n- companies that are hurt bigly from Democratic legislation (and don't have short-term non-political risk)\n\nSo what companies benefitted the most from Trump's tax cuts? (Source: Goldman Sachs Client note)  \n- Tech companies like Netflix, which saw its effective tax rate go from 23% to 7%.\n- Railroad companies like CSX, which saw its effective tax rate go from 37% to 23%.\n- Healthcare companies like HCA, which saw its effective tax rate go from 32% to 20%.\n- Pure financial companies like CME, saw its effective tax rate go from 36% to 23%.\n\nObviously, pandemic-related questions muddle price-action on healthcare. At the same time, there is still some policy uncertainty to what will happen to railroads regardless of the outcome of the runoffs (they will have higher taxes, but that may be offset by stimulus/infrastructure spending). That leaves two sectors as our pure election plays:\n- Tech companies will get more regulation and higher taxes if Biden takes Senate\n- Financials will get more regulation and higher taxes if Biden takes Senate\n\nOut of those sectors, specific companies may be overvalued or undervalued, and other concerns may matter more than legislative impact by the U.S Congress. For example, BABA is a tech company in QQQ, but as a Chinese company it sure isn't going to impacted much by U.S. tax legislation. We can just ignore it.\n\nHowever, a U.S. company like NFLX which is a bit overpriced and very exposed to a tax-cut rollback, is an excellent bear trade for a Democratic Senate scenario (especially if corporate tax increases start being mentioned). While MSFT, which is slightly under-valued and also exposed to tax increases, may be a good trade against a Democratic Senate.  \n\n\nInformation about the races to consider:\n- In the November General election:\n\t- Perdue (R) won 49.7 percent of the vote, while Ossoff (D) won 47.9 percent. In other words, Ossoff substantially underperformed Biden.\n\t- The Republican candidates (Loeffer + Collins) won a combined 49.4 percent, while the Democratic candidates (Warnock et al) won a combined 48.4 percent.\n\t- These are both substantial leads for the Republicans.\n- The \"reputable\" polls:\n\t- Republican-leaning Trafalgar Group (\"most accurate pollster of 2016\"), which had Trump up 3-4% in its November poll (i.e. 3-4% wrong), has now pegged both the Democratic candidates leading slightly in its late December poll.\n\t- Democratic-leaning Survey-USA (which has pretty accurate polling) had Biden up 1-2% in its last general election poll, is now predicting a Democratic sweep in its late December poll\n\t- Poll to Watch: AJC/UGA, with polling by UGA Professor Trey Hood (the most accurate major poll this year for Georgia). This will be released soon.\n- The Rev. Raphael Warnock is currently in divorce proceedings, and was recently accused by his wife of running over her foot with his car. Watch for whether this gains any traction (or at least enough to sway swing voters)\n\n\nThe plays:\n- If you expect both Democratic Senate candidates to sweep (both 2%+), then AGGRESSIVELY short QQQ, NFLX, CME, and long green energy + industrials (e.g. etfs like TAN and Solar stocks like ENPH). I would buy weekly Jan. 8 FD puts.\n- If you expect both Democratic Senate candidates to win with a significant margin (both 0.5%+), short QQQ, NFLX, CME. I would buy puts for Jan. 15/22, since the counting might drag on a few days.\n- If you expect Republicans to comfortably hold at least one seat, long QQQ (specifically NFLX, FB, and MSFT) for Jan. 15\n- If you expect Republicans to sweep, long QQQ and short green energy for Jan. 15.\n- If you expect it to be unclear whether Republicans can hold at least one seat (think month-long recount), long vega on QQQ &amp; NFLX with a bearish tilt. This would be a short vertical call spread, or buying a medium-term strangle. \n- If you expect Trump to still be President on Jan 22 following the events of Jan. 6, aggressively short SPY and long MAGA because a civil war is probably coming.",

        "selftext": "Firstly, read this article:\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/14/business/biden-economy.html\n\nSpecifically this part:\n&gt;The proposals in the second tranche are likely to be larger than the first, and Democrats plan to pay for all or some of them by raising taxes on corporations and the rich. The second package is expected to be centered on job creation and infrastructure, **including hundreds of billions of dollars of spending on clean energy projects like electric vehicle charging stations**, along with health care and education spending, Mr. Biden\u2019s team and leading congressional Democrats have indicated.\n\nTL;DR - Biden is going to talk about stimulus TONIGHT. In this speech he may talk up clean energy. When he gets inaugurated on the 20th, his first order of business is going to be a spending bill that will be **certain** to include clean energy spending.\n\nMy pick for this is ICLN. Why ICLN specifically? Because it contains a multitude of clean energy plays, from PLUG to ENPH to FSLR. TAN is a good choice as well but its much more lopsided, with 10% of its holdings in ENPH. ICLN is also a good choice because its still got a lot of room to run. Over the last month it has gone up 32%, from 24 to its current price of 32. A similar increases would place it at 42 or so.\n\nA good example of how powerfully ICLN can move is when Democrats took Georgia. It moved up 14% in two days. I suspect when Biden is finally put into office we may see similar movements, especially when he voices intent to spend big money on clean energy.\n\nThis means clean energy plays like ICLN, TAN, and other specific companies not in these ETFs will moon. My suggestion to those not in these is to purchase longer dated calls. I think ICLN April 35c is a great call for this, but if you're a huge autist playing off only Biden's speech and inauguration, then ICLN February 30c might be the play for you. I actually don't suggest the ICLN February 35c (Despite me being in it) because its delta seems poor compared to other the options listed and it moves strangely right now.\n\nRockets for good measure \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80",

        "selftext": "Albeit a week late, I want to share my 2021 portfolio for documentation purposes and for whoever is interested. I aimed to balance risk in this portfolio with some growth names and legacy plays. Down to brass tacks, I am putting my money in the highest quality companies (in my view) across a diverse set of industries I find attractive. Some of these names are overvalued in the short term. However, I have realized I am not in the business of beating Wall Street\u2019s pricing, but would rather hold high-quality companies that I believe will grow faster that the market in the long term. In other words, I am totally fine paying a short-term premium for growth and quality. Below is a summary of the portfolio and big picture reasoning behind each investment. I'm definitely open to any feedback. \n\n|Company|Ticker|Entry Price|Exposure|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|ARK Genomic Revolution ETF|ARKG|$93.26|6.60%|\n|CrowdStrike|CRWD|$211.82|11.78%|\n|Disney|DIS|$181.18|10.53%|\n|Enphase Energy|ENPH|$175.47|7.98%|\n|Evolution Gaming Group|EVVTY|$101.02|12.77%|\n|Facebook|FB|$273.16|11.05%|\n|Redfin|RDFN|$68.63|10.41%|\n|Teladoc|TDOC|$199.96|9.60%|\n|Sea Ltd|SE|$199.05|14.09%|\n|Waste Connections|WCN|$102.57|5.19%|\n\n**ARK Genomic Revolution ETF (BATS: ARKG) -** Invests in companies advancing genomics. The companies held in ARKG may develop, produce or enable: CRISPR, Targeted Therapeutics, Bioinformatics, Molecular Diagnostics, Stem Cells, Agricultural Biology.\n\n* Innovative industry. Since 2003 the cost to sequence a human genome has dropped from nearly $3bn to less than $1,000. ARK believes that as costs continue to drop, genomic sequencing will become a standard of care in oncology. It will introduce more science into  healthcare decision making, enable personalized medicine, and accelerate drug discovery. ARK estimates that genomic sequencing revenues will grow 43% at an annual rate, from $3.5bn last year to $21bn in 2024.\n* Cathie Wood. She\u2019s a beast stock picker. Out of all the  ETFs she runs, her closest competitor trailed by 60%. Her worst ETF still  doubled investors' money. Her strategy is to make investments into companies that she considers incredibly transformational and she has seen success doing it.\n\n**CrowdStrike (NASDAQ: CRWD) -** Cybersecurity technology company that provides endpoint security, threat intelligence, and cyber attack response services. \n\n* Best in class technology. Remember about a week ago a bunch of Russian hackers breached SolarWinds? The same hackers also tried to hack CrowdSrike at the same time but were unsuccessful. I\u2019ve wandered on to a bunch of cybersecurity forums, and the general consensus is CrowdStrike has developed the best cybersecurity solution by miles. CRWD is the undisputed leader in cybersecurity. \n* \u201cPick-and-shovel\u201d investment into the world\u2019s increasing digitization. Even in the absence of COVID, cybersecurity remains a key component of the world\u2019s increasing digitization as cyberthreats have been an ongoing issue from the onset of the internet. In the last decade we have seen a bunch of hacks where companies have exposed sensitive customer information. It seems companies are just starting to realize the importance of cybersecurity.\n\n**Disney (NYSE: DIS) -** Worldwide entertainment company that you all are probably familiar with.\n\n* Reopening trade. In 2019, parks generated 45% of total operating income for DIS. Full reopening and attendance in parks will be slow, but certainly benefit DIS when it happens. The company has been executing on several other segments in the meantime (i.e. streaming). It has proved competitive, increasing the margin of safety if parks take longer to reopen.\n* Fast-growing streaming division. DIS has proved agile as it successfully launched a streaming service, Disney+, that has already gained 86mn+ subscribers which was the company\u2019s original 5 year target. This is promising as it shows management can adapt to rapidly changing technology trends.\n\n**Enphase Energy (NASDAQ: ENPH) -** Designs and manufactures software-driven home energy solutions that span solar generation, home energy storage and web-based monitoring and control.\n\n* Shift to clean energy; ENPH emerging as market leader. Going into 2021, sentiments towards solar have been at an all time high. This trend is expected to continue, especially after the Georgia run-off results. Solar firms are expected to benefit from extended tax incentives on both the consumer and producer ends.\n* Technological advantage. ENPH has developed the industry leading solution and is rapidly taking market share from its primary competitor, SolarEdge. Pricing reflects this, but it's expected to continue. Among key competitors, Enphase has been one of the lowest cost producers. Its low-cost structure is a major contributing factor to its improving margins.\n\n**Evolution Gaming Group (OTC: EVVTY) -** Swedish company that develops, produces, markets and licenses integrated B2B live casino solutions for gaming operators. \n\n* Early mover advantage. Evolution\u2019s lack of competition enables it to rapidly grow in new markets and create a loyal customer base, with high switching costs. The company has effectively grown EBITA margins from 41.6% in 1Q18 to 64.8% in 3Q20. Margin expansion is expected to continue.\n* Massive untapped markets. Europe is estimated to be around $2.5bn (EVVTY has 50% market share), Asian market is \\~15x the size of Europe (150% YoY growth for EVVTY in Asia). North America\u2019s market is \\~$210mn, a 42% increase YoY, with NJ and PA the only states currently operating (NY looks promising). Management thinks the US will be the largest in the long-term. \n* Undetected from Wall Street. Evolution has almost no analyst coverage in the US and very minimal coverage in Europe, presenting opportunity for additional growth as institutional money managers recognize this opportunity and draw attention to the stock. Additionally, Evolution has a founder-led management team that is highly aligned with shareholders (mgmt owns over 30% of the stock).\n\n**Facebook (NASDAQ: FB) -** Enables people to connect through devices. It\u2019s products include Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, WhatsApp and Oculus. \n\n* Zuck. It\u2019s not a question of who is the next Jobs/Bezos/Gates/Zuck, because Zuck is super young. He has a history of being able to execute: IG acquisition / transition from desktop to mobile /  denying multiple acquisition opportunities in his twenties. \n* Undervalued. FB is the cheapest among the FAANG stocks, yet has some of the highest growth rates. This is mainly because of its continuous political scandals. With Trump out of office, I think FB has a chance to stay out of trouble and start to realize higher multiples.  The antitrust lawsuit is not a threat imo, it is actually an opportunity. If the govt forces FB to break up, we would get shares in the spin-offs, which would be valued at a higher multiple than FB. For example, if Instagram spun off from FB and traded at the same multiple as SNAP, Instagram\u2019s market cap would be larger than FB\u2019s.\n\n**Redfin Corporation (NASDAQ: RDFN) -** Provides residential real estate brokerage services. \n\n* Digitization of Real Estate (i.e. \u201ciBuying\u201d). Technology in RE is moving from being informational to transactional. Redfin\u2019s iBuying service is dubbed \u201cRedfinNow.\u201d The service basically buys homes from sellers looking for a quick and convenient sale (close deals within 10-30 days). This segment isn\u2019t profitable yet as it is just getting started, but promising as the management adapts to technology trends.\n* Inter-US Migration and housing outlook. People are moving out of the cities because of COVID / trying to avoid taxes / etc. which increases demand for Redfin\u2019s services. With interest rates extremely low (and no expectation for them to increase), homebuying demand should continue to grow.\n* RDFN most attractively valued compared to Z and OPEN, with the most upside potential given its market cap \\~$7bn. Some are predicting RDFN might start offering rental services as well. RDFN has the best LT margin potential. \n\n**Teladoc Health (NYSE: TDOC) -** Provides virtual healthcare services on a B2B basis to its clients and provides services to consumers directly and through channel partners.\n\n* Competitive positioning in industry ripe for disruption. Healthcare is a huge market yet to be significantly disrupted. COVID has accelerated this disruption. Providers who were once opposed to telemedicine now realize its benefits and several regulatory changes are promising for telemedicines growth potential. Medicare and other government-sponsored coverage is expected to include telemedicine benefits, increasing TDOC\u2019s TAM.\n* Livongo acquisition. From the consumer POV, this will increase access to healthcare at a lower cost. Teladoc will have access to a larger amount of data it can interpret to refine its services and monetization strategies. \n\n**Sea Ltd (NYSE: SE) -** Digital entertainment, electronic commerce, and digital financial services. The Company operates three business segments: Garena, Shopee, and SeaMonkey. The Company\u2019s digital entertainment business, Garena, is a global game developer and publisher with a presence in Southeast Asia, Taiwan, and Latin America. Garena provides access to mobile and personal computer online games. Shopee provides users with a shopping environment that is supported by integrated payment, logistics, fulfillment, and other value-added services. SeaMonkey business is a digital financial services provider. SeaMonkey offers e-wallet services, payment processing, credit related digital financial offerings, and other financial products. \n\n* Diversified consumer internet company with market-leading position. Sea caters to Southeast Asia and Taiwan, providing its online gaming, e-commerce, and payment platforms. Shopee has overtaken competitors, it is widening its market share lead. ESports is a rapidly growing market (15.7% YoY to $1.1bn in 2020) and Sea is outpacing market growth.\n* Pay for quality. The best companies keep going up for years in a row, and I think Sea is in the early stages of being classified as such a company. It\u2019s worth $100bn but has effectively proved its ability to identify opportunities and expand business lines. \n* Still early stages of developing its consumer banking business, so we get the security of a bigger, established company with upside for an additional, lucrative business line such as fintech.\n\n**Waste Connections Inc. (NYSE: WCN) -** Waste services company that provides non-hazardous waste collection, transfer, disposal and recycling services. \n\n* Recession resilient; re-opening trade. The waste management industry is recession resilient, it will always be around. \n* Non-hazardous waste collection. With a progressive government likely to push climate initiatives, recycling and non-hazardous waste collection are likely to benefit on the back end.\n* WCN has a large moat; there isn\u2019t much of a competitive threat the way the industry operates. Management\u2019s strategy is to generally only spend what FCF is available. This enables the company to make acquisitions while handling its debt load. Great for stable growth.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nP.S. I have two other accounts - one with about 40 growth stocks and another with about 10 big names / ETFs. However, this portfolio has the largest allocation for 2021. My first time trying a more concentrated approach.",

        "selftext": "**EARLY   TLDR: Today Tesla quietly launched its very own solar power inverter.   This wasn't announced until today. This is the first real threat to  ENPH  and SEDG's duopoly (and their subsequent absurd x30-x200 rise in  the  last 2 years). BUY ENPH or SEDG PUTS/SHORTS asap.**\n\nSources:\n\n\\-Tesla Website link: [https://www.tesla.com/support/energy/solar-inverter/tesla-solar-inverter](https://www.tesla.com/support/energy/solar-inverter/tesla-solar-inverter)\n\n\\-Electrek post: [https://electrek.co/2021/01/14/tesla-tsla-solar-power-inverter-launch/](https://electrek.co/2021/01/14/tesla-tsla-solar-power-inverter-launch/)\n\nOk retards, I've been following the solar space for some time and I just had to write something before others do.\n\n**Background - The reason behind SolarEdge and Enphase's meteoric rise.**\n\nAs   you can see in the charts below, ENPH and SEDG have rallied like crazy   the last couple of years. ENPH especially... it went from under $1 to   $208 as of today. Although ENPH was sort of a turnaround story, the  real  reason behind their rise was due to regulation (NEC 2017) that  required  rapid shutdown devices on solar systems in the US. This  basically  killed chinese and other inverter manufacturers in the US  that didn't  have module level hardware. Long story short, it created a  beautiful  duopoly in the residential solar market in the US during a  rapid growth  in the industry.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ffzk2s2e2fb61.png?width=637&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=83e5cb301490f3687d48a763164b03c711ca3958\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mgfhttub2fb61.png?width=638&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=803242ed86d6a9892d0fefc594e2a2778942d3a6\n\n**Current Valuations of SEDG &amp; ENPH**\n\nI'm   not going to get into the financials etc, but SEDGs P/E is 99 and   ENPH's is 163. Enough said. Of course the whole sector has rallied with   DEM win and recently with the senate upset. Fine. But this rise, like   EV's, is frothy as hell.\n\nHaving   said that, I wouldn't recommend anyone short or buy puts on any of the   solar names (RUN, JKS, CSIQ, DQ, SEDG, ENPH, TAN, ICLN, etc etc).   They were overvalued 3 months ago. They can keep going up up and up. As  a  lot of people have been posting here recently, the clean energy ETFs   have done incredibly well. HOWEVER.....\n\n**Besides like Apple or Amazon, what's the WORST company to suddenly become your competitor...?**\n\nTESLA obviously. Elon Musk is the only guy that keeps bald nerd-turned-into Vin diesel looking mfer Bezos awake at night.\n\nWith   big dog Tesla entering the space, and becoming a DIRECT COMPETITOR out   of nowhere to ENPH and SEDG, this changes things. For those invested  in  any of the solar names, it's time to hedge by buying some ENPH/SEDG   puts. For any degenerates looking for a quick buck, ENPH and SEDG will   most certainly start coming down to reasonable valuations. You heard it   here first, this is the END OF THE DUOPOLY. Once chinese manufacturers   get back into this space, then it'll get commodified like the solar   panel guys (hello &lt;10 P/Es).\n\n**PS: TAN and ICLN's biggest holdings are SEDG &amp; ENPH...**\n\nHappy   Hunting Retards. For ENPH Longs... Please don't give me shit about  \"but enphase has micro-inverters, they are better than central inverter  blah  blah blah\". Don't be like the sleazy solar sales guys that knock  doors  in Long Island every week. Customers don't care if its micro vs.   string inverters. They care about price and brand recognition. From   Electrek *\"Finally, the greatest   advantage (although it\u2019s uncertain) is potentially the cost. Tesla could   potentially be able to achieve a better cost than the competition by   leveraging its already large power electronic production capacity for   its electric vehicles and charging stations.\"* Price will certainly  be lower than ENPH or SEDG. You think anyone knows wtf enphase or  solaredge is? They all know what Tesla is, they have one parked in your  mom's house.",

        "selftext": "**Stocks go bonkers while the Dems take Georgia. The Capitol is breached. Is this the time to buy Solar, Pot &amp; Industrial stocks? Let\u2019s talk about this and other stock market news** \n\nHello everyone and Good Morning! So, let\u2019s start with the recap of yesterday as we saw a mixed day with the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/nsJ4qqL) leading the way up over 400points and closing at a new record high, with the broad stock market [SP500](https://ibb.co/kKxbFdQ) also finishing 0.57% up for the while the tech heavy [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/C7CdfX8) finished the day down 0.6%. All 3 of the big indexes were trading higher earlier in the day before the [VIX](https://ibb.co/4PR24Fc) saw a spike of more than 10% as rioters [STORMED](https://ibb.co/KjbQPkD) the US Capitol, before eventually getting back to certifying the electoral votes, which brought back some stability. This was a very bad incident but shouldn\u2019t have long-lasting effects on the stock market.\n\nYesterday we saw almost 70% of [COMPANIES](https://ibb.co/Br0Y0hB) advancing with over 300 new highs as the volume also spiked up, as 8 of the 11 [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/FmhD70s) finished in the green with Financials, Energy and Materials gaining more than 3%, while the biggest loser was by far the tech sectors, dropping 1.7%, as we saw Large-Cap Growth companies underperforming the [MARKET](https://ibb.co/XpbdM7p), while small &amp; mid-caps, especially the value plays, outperformed the market.\n\nHere is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/WKhNSZh) from yesterday which show how Big tech companies suffered yesterday, as the perceived threat of increased [TAXES](https://ibb.co/D79SMMP) spooked the market, while the Industrials, Financials, Green Energy &amp; [POT](https://ibb.co/XZFHGvj) stocks flourished on the hope of a big stimulus with new &amp; improved regulations, as it is expected that there will be an improved legislation that will help the cannabis stocks soar and the possible big stimulus would be a huge boost to most of the [RETAIL](https://ibb.co/GfwgQ3Z) sector which saw names like Nordstrom, GameStop, Target and many others posting big moves to the upside. Joining them should be [COSTCO](https://ibb.co/pQdXm2H), which did lag yesterday, but posted terrific December numbers after hours, with comparable sales increasing more than 10% while e-commerce rose by more than 60% for the month.\n\nYesterday we also saw the [FED](https://ibb.co/mFgqXN4) deciding to continue the current QE pace, as they still see plenty of uncertainty around, especially in the first quarter of 2021. They will continue to buy $120B worth of securities every month, as well as possibly moving on to some lengthier term maturities, while being opened to even more monetary easing if necessary.\n\nIn some more good news, we saw the [Factory Orders](https://ibb.co/jRqfPf7) for November coming it at +1%, better than expected as shipments increased by 0.7%.\n\nWhile in some other not so good numbers we saw the December [PMI](https://ibb.co/7XjyFjB) slowing to 55.3, less than the 55.7 expected and 58.6 in the previous month, but this is still an indicator of expanding business activity, while ADP [numbers](https://ibb.co/kJ6jjRx) came in worse than expected, as the US lost 123K nonfarm jobs, worse than the 130K addition of jobs expected and 304K jobs gained in the previous month, as we saw a big loss of jobs in large business especially in the leisure/hospitality [SECTOR](https://ibb.co/9sCLVqY). This was the first [month](https://ibb.co/3F8Q9j0) since April when we saw a lose of jobs in the nonfarm private business. \n\n[TODAY](https://ibb.co/vsB6NM2) we have a loaded economic data calendar starting with jobless numbers early in the morning and finishing with the Fed Balance Sheet at the market close.\n\nIn some other stock market news, we saw a report that [ROBLOX](https://ibb.co/3yqfGFZ) is looking to go public via direct listing, rather the traditional IPO. The latest funding round at $45/share saw the company valued at almost $30B, which is very high but we have to see the latest books of the company before making a prediction if it will go higher or not. This may be a better opportunity for retail investors to get in at lower prices, rather than buying at 2-3 times the IPO price.\n\nSo, guys, due to the latest political developments we have seen a huge shift in the markets, as we saw yesterday the [SOLAR](https://ibb.co/KWH2wHh) stocks having spectacular gains with Sunrun, &amp; SunPower gaining more than 16% with many other companies like [ENPHASE](https://ibb.co/72jTgdq) also soring, while the hydrogen play Plug Power also [soared](https://ibb.co/xDxrq80) more than 20% in after-hours after agreeing to a collaboration with SK Group.\n\nWe also saw gambling names move up after with the Senate changing leadership and states like New York pushing for the legalization of [gambling](https://ibb.co/CPFdVpv) in most of the US.\n\nWe also saw other companies posting great numbers, with [T-Mobile](https://ibb.co/qC2rXQC) adding 5.5M customers, its best ever number as they lead the industry, while [ROKU](https://ibb.co/qxWCNg4) continued to be one of the best plays in the streaming business alongside Disney &amp; Netflix as they have surpassed 50M accounts.\n\nAnd on the industrial side we saw companies like Caterpillar and US Steel posting big gains in anticipation of an infrastructure bill that would benefit them. \n\n[Ford](https://ibb.co/yNz7PjD) also beat expectations with a decline in sales of just under 10%, better than the 14% expected as the company continues to move towards more trucks, SUVs &amp; EVs.\n\nOn the other-hand we also saw [Chinese](https://ibb.co/rbRQwyq) tech and EV stocks fall, after more bad headlines like the US looking to ban even more big companies in the US like Alibaba &amp; Tencent. This is a continuing story which has peaked up steam in the recent year after the political tensions between the US and China have increased. This companies were also joined by the big tech which continuing to face selloff pressure after the blue sweep in Georgia.\n\nMy opinion is that you should start buying some green energy, pot and industrial stocks but you shouldn\u2019t go to heavy on the first day. You should wait for things to cool-off a little and not buy everything at the top. I think a bi-weekly split strategy or monthly strategy would be nice. Which would mean you should divide your investment money and buy especially on red days every couple of weeks or on a monthly basis, but I would avoid Chinese stocks for now at least.\n\nSo, let\u2019s hope for a good day in the market as the [WORLD](https://ibb.co/LCv8Dp1) markets are mixed while the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/wghkCJ1) seem to be pointing at a good open with the Nasdaq leading the way, though in the last few days every single time the futures were up the stocks finished higher and vice-verse, when the futures were red the stocks finished higher, so you shouldn\u2019t base your investment on this.\n\nThank you everyone for reading! Hope you enjoyed the content! Be sure to leave a comment down below with your opinion on the stock market! \n\nHave a great day and see you next time!",

        "selftext": "This is my second post for Infrastructure and Energy Alternative. Hope you fuckers listened last time  \n   \n\\*I have to actually spell out the company name because this dumb subreddit thinks its still a spac (its not and hasn\u2019t been since 2018). The ticker is just the first letter of each word\n\nHopefully you listened to me last time:  \n \n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kaskh2/infrastructure\\_and\\_energy\\_alternative\\_is\\_the\\_next/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kaskh2/infrastructure_and_energy_alternative_is_the_next/)\n\nYou probably didn\u2019t and chased some shitty call option that failed.\n\nAt the time of that post Infrastructure and Energy Alternative commons were at $11.30 and warrants at $1.50. Commons now are tickling $20 (almost double) and warrants around 4 (2.5x gain). Not bad.\n\nYou\u2019re probably wondering why I would still recommend Infrastructure and Energy Alternative after the nice run it has had recently. Well, with 2bn in revenue and now with the dems taking Georgia, we are going to see TRILLIONS of dollars pour into green energy this year and onwards. The best part is Infrastructure and Energy Alternative still sits at a paltry 420mm market cap (less than 0.25x revenue). \n\nYesterday you saw all 3 othet green energy stocks: Cleanspark, FCEL and PLUG run 30% even though all 3 are already madly overvalued. Infrastructure and Energy Alternative is the best deal of the 3 and still has a ton of room to run. It is clear that green energy is going to boom this year.\n\nMotley fool had an interesting mention of Infrastructure and Energy Alternative today too:  \n [https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/01/06/why-blink-charging-vulcan-materials-and-infrastruc/](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/01/06/why-blink-charging-vulcan-materials-and-infrastruc/)\n\nI know you won\u2019t click the link to read it but here is the important part  \n \n\n*Indeed, Infrastructure &amp; Energy Alternatives just might turn out to be the most promising of these three stock opportunities. Although the company reported only $13.2 million in net profit over the past 12 months according to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), that number is more than twice what Infrastructure and Energy Alternative earned last year. Moreover, free cash flow generation at Infrastructure and Energy Alternative was a very robust $68.6 million over the past year. At a market capitalization of just $410 million, that works out to an ultra-cheap price-to-free cash flow ratio of less than six.*\n\n*Almost entirely uncovered on Wall Street, Infrastructure and Energy Alternatives could be\u00a0the\u00a0small-cap stock to watch in 2021.*\n\nBest part, like they just mentioned, is Infrastructure and Energy Alternative is STILL NOT DISCOVERED BY WALL STREET. This is still ground floor. Potential ENPH type move in 2021 for Infrastructure and Energy Alternative. \ud83d\ude80\n\nIf you look at the Infrastructure and Energy Alternative chart, there is a very obvious pattern that has been happening since summer. It moons roughly 80-100% then dips 30% and consolidates\u2026 rinse and repeat. It looks like it just finished its recent consolidation in the 16-17 area and is ready for its next leg up to $30.\n\nFunds have been adding mad in the most recent consolidation period between $15-$17. The volume is regularly over 1million now when just a month ago it was a struggle to hit 500-700k. It is clear that funds are starting to find Infrastructure and Energy Alternative. It was also recently added to a few ETF\u2019s and index\u2019s. \n\nIMO Infrastructure and Energy Alternative will see $30 relatively soon. $30 on the commons gives us $10 warrants. When you hit the $10 warrants (or whatever price youre happy with) you can then flip then into the commons and let them ride throughout 2021.\n\nYou can obviously buy calls but I think warrants are the better deal here for the potential 100% move + in the short and midterm.\n\nP.s. read through my previous wsb post (link at the top) if youre interested in the deeper numbers regarding Infrastructure and Energy Alternative. This is ENPH for 2021 baby.\n\nCheers boys",

If that happens, I wouldn't be surprised to see a 5-20 percent drop in some popular stocks like ENPH, SPWR, FCEL, etc. \n\nThe market has already started to price this in, but of course, if Democrats clinch out a victory, there will be massive rallies to the upside.

        "selftext": "I bought 100 shares of ENPH a while back at an average cost of $44 a share. 2 months ago, while the price of the stock was at around $130, I sold a covered call for May, 2021 at a $200 strike. Currently, ENPH is floating around $205 and will probably be way over $200 at the time of expiry in May. I would really love to hold on to my ENPH shares (I know, I\u2019m dumb for selling the call, but I didn\u2019t think it would skyrocket as quickly as it did). It would cost me about $4000 to buy back the call and I just don\u2019t think I can justify that. What\u2019s your general opinion on ENPH? Does it have more room to run past $200, or should I just accept that I\u2019ll lose the shares and dedicate my capital towards something else?\n\n\n\n\nENPH is my only position in green energy, but I would like to retain some sort of footing in the sector.

I suspect that by Friday we are looking at maybe as high as $1300 which will result in a second stock split most likely and we will then see Tesla rise from $300 to just under $500 before the run actually ends. Although don't expect Tesla to reach $1000 again for at least another year after that.\n\nWhile the gloves are hot, Diamond gloves makes it so you don't feel that you have to drop the burning TESLA cash.

        "selftext": "#1) Invesco NASDAQ Next Gen 100 ETF (QQQJ)\n\nThe Invesco NASDAQ Next Gen 100 ETF (QQQJ) follows the immensely well known Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ) by investing in the 101st to the 200th largest NASDAQ listed companies. These companies are less mature than those in the NASDAQ 100 but with high growth potential.\n\nThe top holdings of QQQJ include Roku Inc (ROKU), Crowdstrike Holdings Inc (CRWD), The Trade Desk Inc (TTD), Zscaler Inc (ZS), Enphase Energy Inc (ENPH), AstraZeneca PLC (AZN), Take-Two Interactive Software Inc (TTWO), Old Dominion Freight Line Inc (ODFL), Fortinet Inc (FTNT), and Coupa Software Inc (COUP). Many of the most popular growth companies are included in this new ETF.\n\n#2) VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH)\n\nThe VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF tracks the semiconductor industry--one of the hottest industries of 2020. It isn\u2019t hard to be bullish on semiconductors when they are required by virtually all companies. Electric vehicles have put the spotlight on many semiconductor companies in the race for autonomous driving.\n\nThe VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH) has top holdings including: Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM), Nvidia Corp (NVDA), ASML Holding (ASML), Broadcom Inc (AVGO), Advanced Micro Devices Inc (AMD), Texas Instruments Inc (TXN), Intel Corp (INTC), Qualcomm Inc (QCOM), Micron Technology Inc (MU), and Analog Devices Inc (ADI). Semiconductors have had a killer year and the outperformance will likely continue in the future as demand for semiconductors increases.\n\n#3) Salesforce.com, Inc (CRM)\n\nSalesforce.com, Inc (CRM) develops cloud computing solutions for customer relationship management (hence the ticker \u201cCRM\u201d). Salesforce recently announced it was acquiring Slack Technologies (WORK) for over $27 billion. This deal was one of the largest acquisitions announced in 2020. Salesforce has fallen almost 15% since the acquisition announcement on fears it is overpaying in the Slack acquisition.\n\nHowever, Salesforce has continued to crush earnings estimates in the last quarters of 2020 with analyst consensus that this growth can continue. Salesforce operates in a growing market and continues to be the number one choice for customer relationship management.\n\n#4) Array Technologies, Inc. (ARRY)\n\nArray Technologies, Inc. (ARRY) is in the business of solar tracking solutions and services. The Company currently provides the DuraTrack solar tracking system and SmarTrack which is software that automatically adjusts module angles to compensate for environment changes.\n\nArray is quickly growing revenues with earnings and free cash flow remaining positive since 2019. The Company has stated its plans for continued growth and its willingness to make acquisitions. Array Technologies is a direct bet on the future of solar energy which will likely benefit under a democratic Whitehouse. This Company allows investors to invest in the future of solar without investing directly into solar panels.\n\n#5) Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (VRTX)\n\nVertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (VRTX) focuses on the treatment of cystic fibrosis through several drugs and has several ongoing clinical trials for the treatment of other diseases. Vertex collaborates with an impressive list of companies, including CRISPR Therapeutics (CRSP), Moderna (MRNA), and Merck &amp; Co. (MRK).\n\nVertex Pharmaceuticals has proven itself to be competent in developing market-leading drugs and securing lengthy patents on its treatments. The Company will continue to dominate the cystic fibrosis space in the future due to limited competition.\n\n**Honorable mentions:** CSIQ, AMZN, MSFT, PENN, ABBV, AZN, FUSE\n\n----\n\n**Note:** I hold positions in all of the mentioned companies and exchange traded funds. Many of these companies are valued at high multiples due to their growth potential. This is not financial advice; invest at your own risk.",

        "selftext": "**Stocks go bonkers while the Dems take Georgia. The Capitol is breached. Is this the time to buy Solar, Pot &amp; Industrial stocks? Let\u2019s talk about this and other stock market news**\n\nHello everyone and Good Morning! So, let\u2019s start with the recap of yesterday as we saw a mixed day with the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/nsJ4qqL) leading the way up over 400points and closing at a new record high, with the broad stock market [SP500](https://ibb.co/kKxbFdQ) also finishing 0.57% up for the while the tech heavy [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/C7CdfX8) finished the day down 0.6%. All 3 of the big indexes were trading higher earlier in the day before the [VIX](https://ibb.co/4PR24Fc) saw a spike of more than 10% as rioters [STORMED](https://ibb.co/KjbQPkD) the US Capitol, before eventually getting back to certifying the electoral votes, which brought back some stability. This was a very bad incident but shouldn\u2019t have long-lasting effects on the stock market.\n\nYesterday we saw almost 70% of [COMPANIES](https://ibb.co/Br0Y0hB) advancing with over 300 new highs as the volume also spiked up, as 8 of the 11 [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/FmhD70s) finished in the green with Banks , Energy and Materials gaining more than 3%, while the biggest loser was by far the tech sectors, dropping 1.7%, as we saw Large-Cap Growth companies underperforming the [MARKET](https://ibb.co/XpbdM7p), while small &amp; mid-caps, especially the value plays, outperformed the market.\n\nHere is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/WKhNSZh) from yesterday which show how Big tech companies suffered yesterday, as the perceived threat of increased [TAXES](https://ibb.co/D79SMMP) spooked the market, while the Industrials, Banks, Green Energy &amp; [POT](https://ibb.co/XZFHGvj) stocks flourished on the hope of a big stimulus with new &amp; improved regulations, as it is expected that there will be an improved legislation that will help the cannabis stocks soar and the possible big stimulus would be a huge boost to most of the [RETAIL](https://ibb.co/GfwgQ3Z) sector which saw names like Nordstrom, GameStop, Target and many others posting big moves to the upside. Joining them should be [COSTCO](https://ibb.co/pQdXm2H), which did lag yesterday, but posted terrific December numbers after hours, with comparable sales increasing more than 10% while e-commerce rose by more than 60% for the month.\n\nYesterday we also saw the [FED](https://ibb.co/mFgqXN4) deciding to continue the current QE pace, as they still see plenty of uncertainty around, especially in the first quarter of 2021. They will continue to buy $120B worth of securities every month, as well as possibly moving on to some lengthier term maturities, while being opened to even more monetary easing if necessary.\n\nIn some more good news, we saw the [Factory Orders](https://ibb.co/jRqfPf7) for November coming it at +1%, better than expected as shipments increased by 0.7%.\n\nWhile in some other not so good numbers we saw the December [PMI](https://ibb.co/7XjyFjB) slowing to 55.3, less than the 55.7 expected and 58.6 in the previous month, but this is still an indicator of expanding business activity, while ADP [numbers](https://ibb.co/kJ6jjRx) came in worse than expected, as the US lost 123K nonfarm jobs, worse than the 130K addition of jobs expected and 304K jobs gained in the previous month, as we saw a big loss of jobs in large business especially in the leisure/hospitality [SECTOR](https://ibb.co/9sCLVqY). This was the first [month](https://ibb.co/3F8Q9j0) since April when we saw a lose of jobs in the nonfarm private business.\n\n[TODAY](https://ibb.co/vsB6NM2) we have a loaded economic data calendar starting with jobless numbers early in the morning and finishing with the Fed Balance Sheet at the market close.\n\nIn some other stock market news, we saw a report that [ROBLOX](https://ibb.co/3yqfGFZ) is looking to go public via direct listing, rather the traditional IPO. The latest funding round at $45/share saw the company valued at almost $30B, which is very high but we have to see the latest books of the company before making a prediction if it will go higher or not. This may be a better opportunity for retail investors to get in at lower prices, rather than buying at 2-3 times the IPO price.\n\nSo, guys, due to the latest political developments we have seen a huge shift in the markets, as we saw yesterday the [SOLAR](https://ibb.co/KWH2wHh) stocks having spectacular gains with Sunrun, &amp; SunPower gaining more than 16% with many other companies like [ENPHASE](https://ibb.co/72jTgdq) also soring, while the hydrogen play Plug Power also [soared](https://ibb.co/xDxrq80) more than 20% in after-hours after agreeing to a collaboration with SK Group.\n\nWe also saw gambling names move up after with the Senate changing leadership and states like New York pushing for the legalization of [gambling](https://ibb.co/CPFdVpv) in most of the US.\n\nWe also saw other companies posting great numbers, with [T-Mobile](https://ibb.co/qC2rXQC) adding 5.5M customers, its best ever number as they lead the industry, while [ROKU](https://ibb.co/qxWCNg4) continued to be one of the best plays in the streaming business alongside Disney &amp; Netflix as they have surpassed 50M accounts.\n\nAnd on the industrial side we saw companies like Caterpillar and US Steel posting big gains in anticipation of an infrastructure bill that would benefit them.\n\n[Ford](https://ibb.co/yNz7PjD) also beat expectations with a decline in sales of just under 10%, better than the 14% expected as the company continues to move towards more trucks, SUVs &amp; EVs.\n\nOn the other-hand we also saw [Chinese](https://ibb.co/rbRQwyq) tech and EV stocks fall, after more bad headlines like the US looking to ban even more big companies in the US like Alibaba &amp; Tencent. This is a continuing story which has peaked up steam in the recent year after the political tensions between the US and China have increased. This companies were also joined by the big tech which continuing to face selloff pressure after the blue sweep in Georgia.\n\nMy opinion is that you should start buying some green energy, pot and industrial stocks but you shouldn\u2019t go to heavy on the first day. You should wait for things to cool-off a little and not buy everything at the top. I think a bi-weekly split strategy or monthly strategy would be nice. Which would mean you should divide your investment money and buy especially on red days every couple of weeks or on a monthly basis, but I would avoid Chinese stocks for now at least.\n\nSo, let\u2019s hope for a good day in the market as the [WORLD](https://ibb.co/LCv8Dp1) markets are mixed while the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/wghkCJ1) seem to be pointing at a good open with the Nasdaq leading the way, though in the last few days every single time the futures were up the stocks finished higher and vice-verse, when the futures were red the stocks finished higher, so you shouldn\u2019t base your investment on this.\n\nThank you everyone for reading! Hope you enjoyed the content! Be sure to leave a comment down below with your opinion on the stock market!\n\nHave a great day and see you next time!",

        "selftext": "Hey guys, I'm fairly new here.\n\nI currently own PBW and ICLN. I am looking for individual stocks or even ETFs that are likely to give 50%+ in 2021. I know it's a silly question, no one can predict the future, but we can theorize. \n\nI'm looking at AAPL, PYPL, SQ, ENPH, and NIO.\n\nThe P/E ratio for ENPH is 150+ so I'm a little worried about that. NIO has yet to have any positive earnings. However, the hype is real around these EV and clean energy stocks. AAPL, PYPL, and SQ are probably the safest bets with AAPL supposedly planning an EV. \n\nWhat do you guys think? Also, what are your picks for 2021?",

        "selftext": "So first time selling covered calls and I'm just looking for advice.  I sold an enph 210c for jan 15th for 2.45 the day before the S&amp;P news and i forgot about the senate runoff.  Anyways this lottery ticket might hit and I may get exercised on Friday.  Should I wait till Thursday or Friday and roll it to a Feb 19 240c call for 9.80sh I think it was last time I checked.  My current option is worth 4.00 so I'd lose 1.55 on my covered call if the numbers stay the same.  Is this the right play?  I'm very bullish on enph and this way I get to keep my shares, raise the strike and make more premium.\n\nNext question.  Sold 2x GOEV 17.5 feb 19th at 1.6 last week when it was trading at 13.5. Cost basis is 11.60 a share. Big news hit in the aftermarket today and its now trading at 21.  In a situation like this is it best to let it expire since its way above the strike?  Or is their ways to roll it like I want to do with enph where I can increase the strike and collect premiums.  Very new to this and appreciate any advice.",

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, January 20, 2021**\n\nStocks rose Wednesday, extending yesterday\u2019s rally as market participants look ahead to the first actions of the incoming Biden administration. Each of the three major indexes closed at record levels. The Nasdaq (QQQ) finished 2.33% up, the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) finished 1.38% up, and the Dow Jones (DIA) finished 0.79% up.\n\nToday, people from across the world turned to Washington D.C. to see the inauguration of President Joe Biden. In his first few hours in Office, Biden is set to sign about a dozen Executive Orders to address the pandemic, the economy, climate change, and reverse many of the orders Trump signed during his term, according to a memo from incoming White House Chief of Staff Ron Klain. Biden reportedly plans to extend a pause on student loan payments and interest on federal loans, rejoin the Paris Agreement, and issue a mask mandate on federal property and interstate travel. Biden also plans to sign additional executive orders in his initial 10 days in office, Klain noted.\n\nBiden is also set to move quickly to begin pushing for additional fiscal stimulus. He recently outlined his $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief proposal, which includes a host of new relief measures to be added to the provisions in the $900 billion package Congress passed last month. Biden\u2019s proposal, called the American Rescue Plan, includes $1,400 in stimulus payment to be added on top of the $600 already being distributed, the extension and enhancement of unemployment programs, aid to small businesses, $350 billion to state and local governments, increase in tax credits for low- and middle-income families, and $160 billion for a national program on vaccination and testing. Biden said, \u201cWhile Congress\u2019s bipartisan action in December was a step in the right direction, it was only a down payment. It fell far short of the resources needed to tackle the immediate crisis. We are in a race against time, and absent additional government assistance, the economic and public health crises could worsen in the months ahead.\u201d Incoming Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen also advocated for significant additional relief spending during her Senate confirmation hearing earlier in the week.\n\nToday, the US passed the grim milestone of 400,000 coronavirus-related deaths, a stark indicator of the human toll of the pandemic. Infections and hospitalizations continue to surge as well.  According to Johns Hopkins University, over the past week, the US has averaged more than 3,300 daily deaths, a jump of around 217% compared to mid-November.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* In one of his last acts as President, Donald Trump issued about a dozen pardons. Names included prominent figures in the world of business, former political allies, and bizarrely, two rappers (Lil Wayne and Kodak Black).\n* EU antitrust regulators have sought information from advertisers regarding Google's advertising technology practices, a European Commission document seen by Reuters shows.\n* After reporting more than 200 million subscribers for the first time, Netflix (NFLX) stock was up 16% at the time of writing.\n* Arcus Biosciences (RCUS) target raised by Benchmark from $31 to $51. Stock currently around $38\n* Invitae (NVTA) target raised by SVB Leerik from $48 to $64 at Outperform. Stock currently around $59.\n* NuStar Energy (NS) target raised by Mizuho from $16 to $20. Stock currently around $16.\n* After reporting better-than-expected earnings and surging double-digits after-hours, Netflix (NFLX) received a host of price target raises from analysts.\n* Bank of America (BAC) with two target raises. Stock currently around $32.50\n   * Morgan Stanley (MS) from $34 to $36\n   * Credit Suisse from $36 to $38\n* Boyd Gaming (BYD) target raised by Morgan Stanley from $45 to $58 at Overweight. Stock currently around $48\n* Enphase Energy (ENPH) target raised by JP Morgan (JPM) from $199 to $230. Stock currently around $204\n* Guardant Health (GH) target raised by SVB Leerik from $150 to $190 at Outperform. Stock currently around $166.\n* General Motors (GM) target raised by Deutsche Bank from $48 to $60 at Buy. Stock currently around $55.\n* Logitech (LOGI) with two target increases. Stock currently around $100\n   * Morgan Stanley from $113 to $116 \n   * Loop Capital from $112 to $120 \n* Palo Alto Networks (PANW) target raised by Keycorp from $391 to $420 at Overweight.

Stock currently around $84.\n* SolarEdge (SEDG) target raise by JP Morgan (JPM) from $371 to $3807 at Overweight.\n* Tesla (TSLA) target raised by Deutsche Bank from $705 to $895  at Buy.

        "selftext": "BLUF: My first and boldest prediction: ACTC/PTRA will be trading at $47/share (double its price as of the end of after-hours trading on 12 January) no later than 12 April 2021, three months from now. Second prediction: STPK has reached its top justifiable value ($37.71/share) for the next 12 months, as any further run-up represents either bubble/speculation or unprecedented long-term market valuation. \n\nLong-winded DD below. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\--------------------------------\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSTPK is going to become STEM, and ACTC just announced a merger to become PTRA. Using to-the-minute market caps for both, as well as 2021 projected sales totals for the new companies, and then running them against some clean energy/EV comps, STPK's runup over the last week has gotten it to the higher end of what the current market says its 2021 sales should be valued at, and ACTC has got some serious room to run. \n\n# STPK\n\nWith 2021 sales projected at $147 million, and STPK's current shares outstanding accounting for a 28.3% ownership stake in the new company, STPK's market cap stands at $1.45bn, based on 12 January after-hours trading price per share of $37.71. With STEM's projected 2021 topline revenue of $147 million, that puts STPK's P/S ratio at 34.4. \n\n# ACTC\n\nProterra's projected 2021 revenue is $246 million. Its actual 2019 revenue was $181 million, and it's projecting $193 million for 2020. Using the current ACTC market cap of only $657.68 million, that gives us a P/S ratio of 3.4 using 2020 sales, or 2.7 using 2021 sales. \n\n# MARKET COMPS\n\nSince ACTC is selling actual commercial electric vehicles, its high-end market comps are NIO and TSLA, so I'm not going to both pointing out that those are slightly higher than 3.4 P/S ratio. On its low end, comps are FSR and HYLN, whose P/S ratios are infinite because they don't actually sell anything yet. \n\nBest middle ground I can figure, which even accounts for the uncertainty of being contingent on the completion of a pending merger (this forum auto-deletes the descriptive 4-letter S-acronym, as I learned the hard way the first time I wrote this post) is CCIV/Lucid. Unfortunately, information on its revenue projections is hard to find, as it doesn't appear they've yet filed a prospectus with the SEC. According to this link which seems sort of sketchy, its \"estimated\" annual revenue is $378.5 million, which puts it at a current P/S ratio of 9.7. \n\nI can't find the link/source now, but while researching this post I saw a 2019 revenue of $40 million, which puts Lucid at a P/S ratio closer to 100 using 2019 revenue.) Compare this to ACTC's P/S ratios of 3.6 (using 2019 revenue), 3.4 (2020) and 2.7 (2021), and you see why I'm so confident this will double. Also, the fact that Proterra has actually already been generating real revenue for more than a year gives its projections more credibility than the sketchy numbers we have to dig up on Lucid. \n\nSTPK is a unique company that does something no one else in the market does. In addition, its TAM is estimated at $1.3 trillion. Therefore, comparing it to any competitor needs to be taken with a grain of salt. With that said, here are the P/S ratios for trending clean energy names, with STPK placed into context. (Remember that this is only using projected 2021 earnings for STPK, but current MRQ or MRY earnings for its competitors, meaning STPK is likely well above its already high level.) \n\nPLUG: 52.9  \nENPH: 37.7  \nSTPK/STEM: 34.4  \nRUN: 14.04  \nSEDG: 12.02  \nMany many others: below 10\n\nConsidering that this is using 2021 for STPK and the past for the others, it's safe to assume that STPK is actually in PLUG's ballpark right now, which is why I'm saying it's risky for you short-term, paper-handed big gains chasers. Given its technology and capacity to be a complete game changer for electricity infrastructure over the next ten years, anyone who currently or plans to hold for at least a year or 4 would be well served to buy in now.",

        "selftext": "**Stocks go bonkers while the Dems take Georgia. The Capitol is breached. Is this the time to buy Solar, Pot &amp; Industrial stocks? Let\u2019s talk about this and other stock market news** \n\nHello everyone and Good Morning! So, let\u2019s start with the recap of yesterday as we saw a mixed day with the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/nsJ4qqL) leading the way up over 400points and closing at a new record high, with the broad stock market [SP500](https://ibb.co/kKxbFdQ) also finishing 0.57% up for the while the tech heavy [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/C7CdfX8) finished the day down 0.6%. All 3 of the big indexes were trading higher earlier in the day before the [VIX](https://ibb.co/4PR24Fc) saw a spike of more than 10% as rioters [STORMED](https://ibb.co/KjbQPkD) the US Capitol, before eventually getting back to certifying the electoral votes, which brought back some stability. This was a very bad incident but shouldn\u2019t have long-lasting effects on the stock market.\n\nYesterday we saw almost 70% of [COMPANIES](https://ibb.co/Br0Y0hB) advancing with over 300 new highs as the volume also spiked up, as 8 of the 11 [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/FmhD70s) finished in the green with Financials, Energy and Materials gaining more than 3%, while the biggest loser was by far the tech sectors, dropping 1.7%, as we saw Large-Cap Growth companies underperforming the [MARKET](https://ibb.co/XpbdM7p), while small &amp; mid-caps, especially the value plays, outperformed the market.\n\nHere is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/WKhNSZh) from yesterday which show how Big tech companies suffered yesterday, as the perceived threat of increased [TAXES](https://ibb.co/D79SMMP) spooked the market, while the Industrials, Financials, Green Energy &amp; [POT](https://ibb.co/XZFHGvj) stocks flourished on the hope of a big stimulus with new &amp; improved regulations, as it is expected that there will be an improved legislation that will help the cannabis stocks soar and the possible big stimulus would be a huge boost to most of the [RETAIL](https://ibb.co/GfwgQ3Z) sector which saw names like Nordstrom, GameStop, Target and many others posting big moves to the upside. Joining them should be [COSTCO](https://ibb.co/pQdXm2H), which did lag yesterday, but posted terrific December numbers after hours, with comparable sales increasing more than 10% while e-commerce rose by more than 60% for the month.\n\nYesterday we also saw the [FED](https://ibb.co/mFgqXN4) deciding to continue the current QE pace, as they still see plenty of uncertainty around, especially in the first quarter of 2021. They will continue to buy $120B worth of securities every month, as well as possibly moving on to some lengthier term maturities, while being opened to even more monetary easing if necessary.\n\nIn some more good news, we saw the [Factory Orders](https://ibb.co/jRqfPf7) for November coming it at +1%, better than expected as shipments increased by 0.7%.\n\nWhile in some other not so good numbers we saw the December [PMI](https://ibb.co/7XjyFjB) slowing to 55.3, less than the 55.7 expected and 58.6 in the previous month, but this is still an indicator of expanding business activity, while ADP [numbers](https://ibb.co/kJ6jjRx) came in worse than expected, as the US lost 123K nonfarm jobs, worse than the 130K addition of jobs expected and 304K jobs gained in the previous month, as we saw a big loss of jobs in large business especially in the leisure/hospitality [SECTOR](https://ibb.co/9sCLVqY). This was the first [month](https://ibb.co/3F8Q9j0) since April when we saw a lose of jobs in the nonfarm private business. \n\n[TODAY](https://ibb.co/vsB6NM2) we have a loaded economic data calendar starting with jobless numbers early in the morning and finishing with the Fed Balance Sheet at the market close.\n\nIn some other stock market news, we saw a report that [ROBLOX](https://ibb.co/3yqfGFZ) is looking to go public via direct listing, rather the traditional IPO. The latest funding round at $45/share saw the company valued at almost $30B, which is very high but we have to see the latest books of the company before making a prediction if it will go higher or not. This may be a better opportunity for retail investors to get in at lower prices, rather than buying at 2-3 times the IPO price.\n\nSo, guys, due to the latest political developments we have seen a huge shift in the markets, as we saw yesterday the [SOLAR](https://ibb.co/KWH2wHh) stocks having spectacular gains with Sunrun, &amp; SunPower gaining more than 16% with many other companies like [ENPHASE](https://ibb.co/72jTgdq) also soring, while the hydrogen play Plug Power also [soared](https://ibb.co/xDxrq80) more than 20% in after-hours after agreeing to a collaboration with SK Group.\n\nWe also saw gambling names move up after with the Senate changing leadership and states like New York pushing for the legalization of [gambling](https://ibb.co/CPFdVpv) in most of the US.\n\nWe also saw other companies posting great numbers, with [T-Mobile](https://ibb.co/qC2rXQC) adding 5.5M customers, its best ever number as they lead the industry, while [ROKU](https://ibb.co/qxWCNg4) continued to be one of the best plays in the streaming business alongside Disney &amp; Netflix as they have surpassed 50M accounts.\n\nAnd on the industrial side we saw companies like Caterpillar and US Steel posting big gains in anticipation of an infrastructure bill that would benefit them. \n\n[Ford](https://ibb.co/yNz7PjD) also beat expectations with a decline in sales of just under 10%, better than the 14% expected as the company continues to move towards more trucks, SUVs &amp; EVs.\n\nOn the other-hand we also saw [Chinese](https://ibb.co/rbRQwyq) tech and EV stocks fall, after more bad headlines like the US looking to ban even more big companies in the US like Alibaba &amp; Tencent. This is a continuing story which has peaked up steam in the recent year after the political tensions between the US and China have increased. This companies were also joined by the big tech which continuing to face selloff pressure after the blue sweep in Georgia.\n\nMy opinion is that you should start buying some green energy, pot and industrial stocks but you shouldn\u2019t go to heavy on the first day. You should wait for things to cool-off a little and not buy everything at the top. I think a bi-weekly split strategy or monthly strategy would be nice. Which would mean you should divide your investment money and buy especially on red days every couple of weeks or on a monthly basis, but I would avoid Chinese stocks for now at least.\n\nSo, let\u2019s hope for a good day in the market as the [WORLD](https://ibb.co/LCv8Dp1) markets are mixed while the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/wghkCJ1) seem to be pointing at a good open with the Nasdaq leading the way, though in the last few days every single time the futures were up the stocks finished higher and vice-verse, when the futures were red the stocks finished higher, so you shouldn\u2019t base your investment on this.\n\nThank you everyone for reading! Hope you enjoyed the content! Be sure to leave a comment down below with your opinion on the stock market! \n\nHave a great day and see you next time!",

        "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nSo I am in my early twenties and I\u2019m trying to get started in actually setting myself up for the future rather than just struggling to pay for the now (thank god). \n\nI was wondering if people had publications, websites, or other informational materials they use to identify and analyze potential markets to break into/companies to invest in. Obviously there\u2019s this page and my own independent research but I just want to expand.\n\nI\u2019m very interested in \u201crenewable\u201d energy and that market. ENPH is a company I really like and think will grow well over the next few years. \n\nAdditionally, I\u2019m also very interested in the legal marijuana market here in the US. With the dems having control of every branch in the federal government and the growing decriminalization/legalization of recreational use, I think the leading companies with the most dispensaries are in a great position to continue expanding and if and when pot becomes legalized they can really take off. Still doing research on that front.\n\nI don\u2019t have a ton of money to use only for investing but putting in a lump sum and adding incrementally seems better than doing nothing at all. I\u2019d only buy a few stocks of ENPH at first and fill the rest of my initial lump sum into the other market.

        "selftext": "Let\u2019s begin with the most obvious and talked about SPAC talked about. \n\nPSTH - Bill Ackman, Q1 announcement, long term hold. Good long term choice for capital here. I trust Ackman won\u2019t fail his investors considering they raised just a few billion for this man\u2019s unicorn acquisition. \n\nGIK - underrated EV merger. ELightning. CFO said: We have more than $800M of potential business in the pipeline as of the end of Sep.Also, as of Sep 2nd, the second strength comes from a backlog of contracted purchase orders of 150M. That effectively means all of 2021 is contracted &amp; close to a third of 2022 is as well. Solid imo. \n\nBB - You have a possible wave forming in the likes of hundreds of thousands of collective confirmation biased traders &amp; their urge to beat the market &amp; any short sellers that come after them. You can add GME &amp; AMC to this meme stock-ish list. This is not the most ideal path for someone who searches for value but like... squeeze + collective Reddit hedge fund + money making machine = fun time \n\nF, GM - Electric upside is big. Definitely a great 2021-2022 coming for these guys\n\nEXPC - this one is a coin flip. If you think helicopter travel to skip traffic as a public transport opportunity will become a market, this is for you. We\u2019re talking direct flights over the city to save you an hour in downtown Los Angeles when things calm down in like a year... two years... whenever. ARK is buying too. \n\nEXPR - Will Meade likes them. Sets PT at $10. Maybe just keep this on your radar for run potential. \n\nCRM - it\u2019s time for a come back. Chart signals this + Goldman put a new $315 PT. \n\nAAPL - I know, Apple is already on everyone\u2019s radar blah blah. I\u2019m saying this is finally the breakout from the range it was trading at for 4 months :] earnings next Wednesday. It\u2019ll be a fun time. It\u2019s going to fly high. Post holiday. \n\nBFT - don\u2019t ask me why, I just know it\u2019s going to be at least double it\u2019s current value very soon. Mergingggg. Steve Grasso about it too. Dude is a Wall Street Vet and he's putting his cred on the line. \n\n*RENEWABLES* - ICLN, SPWR, NEE, ENPH, REGI, FSLR. (My personal favorite and the one I have traded recently has been SPWR along with shares since March, path still clear, up from 07 highs). \n\nSolid airlines: (DAL, LUV) - LEAPS... that\u2019s all I gotta say. \n\nARKX - whenever that is public it\u2019s going to explode but you knew that. \n\nI know this wasn\u2019t some incredible revelation but I hope you enjoy this list of tickers with some upside.",

        "selftext": "BLUF: My first and boldest prediction: ACTC/PTRA will be trading at $47/share (double its price as of the end of after-hours trading on 12 January) no later than 12 April 2021, three months from now. Second prediction: STPK has reached its top justifiable value ($37.71/share) for the next 12 months, as any further run-up represents either bubble/speculation or unprecedented long-term market valuation. \n\nLong-winded DD below. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\--------------------------------\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSTPK is going to become STEM, and ACTC just announced a merger to become PTRA. Using to-the-minute market caps for both, as well as 2021 projected sales totals for the new companies, and then running them against some clean energy/EV comps, STPK's runup over the last week has gotten it to the higher end of what the current market says its 2021 sales should be valued at, and ACTC has got some serious room to run. \n\n# STPK\n\nWith 2021 sales projected at $147 million, and STPK's current shares outstanding accounting for a 28.3% ownership stake in the new company, STPK's market cap stands at $1.45bn, based on 12 January after-hours trading price per share of $37.71. With STEM's projected 2021 topline revenue of $147 million, that puts STPK's P/S ratio at 34.4. \n\n# ACTC\n\nProterra's projected 2021 revenue is $246 million. Its actual 2019 revenue was $181 million, and it's projecting $193 million for 2020. Using the current ACTC market cap of only $657.68 million, that gives us a P/S ratio of 3.4 using 2020 sales, or 2.7 using 2021 sales. \n\n# MARKET COMPS\n\nSince ACTC is selling actual commercial electric vehicles, its high-end market comps are NIO and TSLA, so I'm not going to both pointing out that those are slightly higher than 3.4 P/S ratio. On its low end, comps are FSR and HYLN, whose P/S ratios are infinite because they don't actually sell anything yet. \n\nBest middle ground I can figure, which even accounts for the uncertainty of being contingent on the completion of a pending merger (this forum auto-deletes the descriptive 4-letter S-acronym, as I learned the hard way the first time I wrote this post) is CCIV/Lucid. Unfortunately, information on its revenue projections is hard to find, as it doesn't appear they've yet filed a prospectus with the SEC. According to this link which seems sort of sketchy, its \"estimated\" annual revenue is $378.5 million, which puts it at a current P/S ratio of 9.7. \n\nI can't find the link/source now, but while researching this post I saw a 2019 revenue of $40 million, which puts Lucid at a P/S ratio closer to 100 using 2019 revenue.) Compare this to ACTC's P/S ratios of 3.6 (using 2019 revenue), 3.4 (2020) and 2.7 (2021), and you see why I'm so confident this will double. Also, the fact that Proterra has actually already been generating real revenue for more than a year gives its projections more credibility than the sketchy numbers we have to dig up on Lucid. \n\nSTPK is a unique company that does something no one else in the market does. In addition, its TAM is estimated at $1.3 trillion. Therefore, comparing it to any competitor needs to be taken with a grain of salt. With that said, here are the P/S ratios for trending clean energy names, with STPK placed into context. (Remember that this is only using projected 2021 earnings for STPK, but current MRQ or MRY earnings for its competitors, meaning STPK is likely well above its already high level.) \n\nPLUG: 52.9  \nENPH: 37.7  \nSTPK/STEM: 34.4  \nRUN: 14.04  \nSEDG: 12.02  \nMany many others: below 10\n\nConsidering that this is using 2021 for STPK and the past for the others, it's safe to assume that STPK is actually in PLUG's ballpark right now, which is why I'm saying it's risky for you short-term, paper-handed big gains chasers. Given its technology and capacity to be a complete game changer for electricity infrastructure over the next ten years, anyone who currently or plans to hold for at least a year or 4 would be well served to buy in now.",

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, January 19, 2021**\n\nStocks rose Tuesday as market participants returned from an extended weekend in the US and looked ahead towards the policy implication of the Biden administration and the Democratic Senate.  Prospects for additional fiscal stimulus in the near-term have buoyed stocks in recent weeks despite the continuing surge in coronavirus infections. \n\nToday, the Senate Finance Committee held a hearing for President-elect Joe Biden\u2019s nomination for Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen. During the hearing, Yellen advocated for additional fiscal action to help support the economy and told Congress to \u201cact big\u201d. She also criticized China\u2019s trade policies saying \u201cWe need to take on China\u2019s abusive, unfair and illegal practices. China is undercutting American companies by dumping products, erecting trade barriers, and giving illegal subsidies to corporations. It\u2019s been stealing intellectual property and engaging in practices that give it an unfair technological advantage, including forced technology transfers. These practices, including China\u2019s low labor and environmental standards, are practices that we\u2019re prepared to use the full array of tools to address.\u201d\n\nTomorrow is Inauguration Day, with Joe Biden and Kamala Harris set to officially begin their term. Market participants will closely monitor the first actions by the new administration. Biden has already signaled he plans to sign about a dozen Executive Orders to address the pandemic, the economy, climate change, and reverse many of the orders Trump signed during his term, according to a memo from incoming White House Chief of Staff Ron Klain. Biden reportedly plans to extend a pause on student loan payments and interest on federal loans, rejoin the Paris Agreement, and issue a mask mandate on federal property and interstate travel. Biden also plans to sign additional executive orders in his initial 10 days in office, Klain noted.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Netflix (NFLX) rose more than 10% after reporting more than 200 million subscribers for the first time. The company recently promised to release one new movie every week of 2021.\n* Michigan's highly anticipated launch of online sports betting is set to happen on Friday, Jan. 22. Nine companies have been approved to launch online sports betting offerings, according to Roundhill Investments.\n* The U.S. auto safety regulator said on Tuesday it would require Ford Motor Co to recall 3 million vehicles with potentially defective Takata air bags\n* SRAC was up 20% again today!

        "selftext": "#1) Invesco NASDAQ Next Gen 100 ETF (QQQJ)\n\nThe Invesco NASDAQ Next Gen 100 ETF (QQQJ) follows the immensely well known Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ) by investing in the 101st to the 200th largest NASDAQ listed companies. These companies are less mature than those in the NASDAQ 100 but with high growth potential.\n\nThe top holdings of QQQJ include Roku Inc (ROKU), Crowdstrike Holdings Inc (CRWD), The Trade Desk Inc (TTD), Zscaler Inc (ZS), Enphase Energy Inc (ENPH), AstraZeneca PLC (AZN), Take-Two Interactive Software Inc (TTWO), Old Dominion Freight Line Inc (ODFL), Fortinet Inc (FTNT), and Coupa Software Inc (COUP). Many of the most popular growth companies are included in this new ETF.\n\n#2) VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH)\n\nThe VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF tracks the semiconductor industry--one of the hottest industries of 2020. It isn\u2019t hard to be bullish on semiconductors when they are required by virtually all companies. Electric vehicles have put the spotlight on many semiconductor companies in the race for autonomous driving.\n\nThe VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH) has top holdings including: Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM), Nvidia Corp (NVDA), ASML Holding (ASML), Broadcom Inc (AVGO), Advanced Micro Devices Inc (AMD), Texas Instruments Inc (TXN), Intel Corp (INTC), Qualcomm Inc (QCOM), Micron Technology Inc (MU), and Analog Devices Inc (ADI). Semiconductors have had a killer year and the outperformance will likely continue in the future as demand for semiconductors increases.\n\n#3) Salesforce.com, Inc (CRM)\n\nSalesforce.com, Inc (CRM) develops cloud computing solutions for customer relationship management (hence the ticker \u201cCRM\u201d). Salesforce recently announced it was acquiring Slack Technologies (WORK) for over $27 billion. This deal was one of the largest acquisitions announced in 2020. Salesforce has fallen almost 15% since the acquisition announcement on fears it is overpaying in the Slack acquisition.\n\nHowever, Salesforce has continued to crush earnings estimates in the last quarters of 2020 with analyst consensus that this growth can continue. Salesforce operates in a growing market and continues to be the number one choice for customer relationship management.\n\n#4) Array Technologies, Inc. (ARRY)\n\nArray Technologies, Inc. (ARRY) is in the business of solar tracking solutions and services. The Company currently provides the DuraTrack solar tracking system and SmarTrack which is software that automatically adjusts module angles to compensate for environment changes.\n\nArray is quickly growing revenues with earnings and free cash flow remaining positive since 2019. The Company has stated its plans for continued growth and its willingness to make acquisitions. Array Technologies is a direct bet on the future of solar energy which will likely benefit under a democratic Whitehouse. This Company allows investors to invest in the future of solar without investing directly into solar panels.\n\n#5) Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (VRTX)\n\nVertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (VRTX) focuses on the treatment of cystic fibrosis through several drugs and has several ongoing clinical trials for the treatment of other diseases. Vertex collaborates with an impressive list of companies, including CRISPR Therapeutics (CRSP), Moderna (MRNA), and Merck &amp; Co. (MRK).\n\nVertex Pharmaceuticals has proven itself to be competent in developing market-leading drugs and securing lengthy patents on its treatments. The Company will continue to dominate the cystic fibrosis space in the future due to limited competition.\n\n**Honorable mentions:** CSIQ, AMZN, MSFT, PENN, ABBV, AZN, FUSE\n\n----\n\n**Note:** I hold positions in all of the mentioned companies and exchange traded funds. Many of these companies are valued at high multiples due to their growth potential. This is not financial advice; invest at your own risk.",

        "selftext": "*(For your tl;dr takeaways, read the TOTAL FUND and FOOTNOTES sections.)*\n\nThere has been lots of chatter lately about a clean energy speculative bubble. I wanted to do this assessment for both PBW and ICLN, but it took way more time than I expected, so I stopped after PBW. This only looks at the market caps, revenues, and net incomes of PBW\u2019s holdings.\n\nPBW has 58 total positions. The two smallest (cash and a mutual fund) account for 0.05% of its total weight, and were omitted from this study. I only considered the other 56 holdings.\n\n# TOTAL FUND\n\n* Raw total market cap of the 56 holdings: $1.316 trillion. Raw avg market cap: $23.5 billion. Weighted average market cap: $25.324 billion.\n* Combining all market caps and net income numbers: raw net margin: -1.07%. Weighted average net margin: -2.17%. As a whole, not only is this ETF *not profitable,* it is heavily weighted in some highly speculative companies.\n* IMO this is an effective fund for exposure to the meme EV stocks and to the ridiculous ride of the speculative gains. But the adage that \"ETFs reduce risk\" is only relative, and PBW is centered on some very high risk holdings.\n\n# UNCLEAN ENERGY\n\nThe numbers for clean energy are actually worse than this, because there are 11 companies ^(1) that are not at all clean energy focused and have no business in a clean energy fund imo. They mostly have an industrial focus that only tangentially touches on clean energy. Their price ratios are distinctly lower, they're less volatile, and as a group they're way more profitable.\n\n* These 11 companies comprise 16.9% of the total weight of the fund. Despite only accounting for 9.4% of the total raw market cap of the companies in the fund, they generate 21.8% of the total revenue.\n* Their combined net income is $3.7 billion, with a net margin of 10.2%. This is compared to the other 45 clean companies, with a combined net *loss* of $5.4 billion and a loss margin of 4.2%.\n\n# THE BRIGHT SIDE\n\n* There are 15 actual clean energy companies in PBW which are also profitable ^(2)\n* These companies, however, only account for 27.7% of the fund\u2019s total weight, despite their combined raw market caps accounting for a whopping 70% of the fund, and generating 50% of the total revenue. For reduced risk exposure to clean energy, stock in these companies is a good way to reduce some risk.\n* These companies operate at a combined net margin of 5.24%.\n\n# THE DARK SIDE\n\nThere are 30 clean energy companies in PBW which operate at a negative net margin. Despite comprising only 20% of the total market cap and generating only 27% of the revenue, these companies account for nearly 56% of the total weight of the fund. Their combined net margin loss is -21.45%.\n\n# THE DANGEROUS\n\n* Included in those 30 not-profitable companies are 11 with net margins that are either worse than 100% in the red ^(3), or they don\u2019t even generate a dime of revenue yet ^(4)\n* They are weighted at 19% of the total fund, but they account for less than 4% of total market cap and less than 0.2% of total revenue.\n* Their combined net margin is 286% in the red.\n\nFOOTNOTES\n\n(1) The eleven PBW holdings that don\u2019t qualify as green energy imo are IEA, SQM, WLDN, ALB, AEIS, PWR, MYRG, ESE, WWD, APD, BWEN. Of these, only ESE and BWEN have a negative net income.\n\n(2) The profitable clean energy companies in PBW are DQ, SPWR, TPIC, ORA, TSLA, CSIQ, AMRC, RUN, FSLR, REGI, ENPH, OLED, JKS, THRM, SEDG. Valuations on these companies generally appear reasonable-ish.\n\n(3) FUV, (-640%), Omitted Pennystock 1 (-111%), Omitted Pennystock 2 (-3,962%), NOVA (-128%), WKHS (-14,914%), BLNK (-432%), and AYRO (-690%) are the six which generate revenue but have a net margin worse than 100%.\n\n(4) LAC, EOSE, RIDE, FSR, and QS all generate 0$ in revenue. They have an average market cap of nearly $6 billion (!!!), and they comprise 8.5% of the total weight of PBW.\n\n*(Disclosure: I hold long positions in PBW (87 shares), AMRC (58), Omitted Pennystock 1 (72), MAXN (62), TPIC (27), LTHM (352), NIO (16), XPEV (16), LAC (38). I plan to continue holding many, including PBW, but I will be using this post as a guide to adjust my risk exposure.*",

        "selftext": "Original post: [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/c1v24n/success/)\n\nHi r/Stocks!\n\nA year and a half ago I posted here to celebrate hitting $16,000 USD from a $10,000 USD investment my mom gave me. I was 16 at the time and I am now 17, turning 18 in about a month. My stock picks included CRSP, ZIOP, FLEX, CELG (bought by BMY), TGT, IBM, and SGEN. You can see the amounts in my previous post. I entered the market on October 29, 2018.\n\nThe last time I posted there were concerns of underaged trading, but all trading was done through a custodial account by my mom. \n\nAnyways, when I posted the majority of responses told me to sell at least some of my position, but I decided not to. My account precede to grow to $19,500 before cashing down to $10,500 during the coronavirus crash. Now my account is at $33,000 and I am glad I never sold.\n\n Although I didn't mention it at the time , my mom also invest $10,000 in the stock market at the same time picking some of the same stocks as me, but also some of her own including QCOM, INTC, and TSLA (yup). I didn't mention it at the time because her account was not performing as well as mine. Now it is at $44,000. \n\nLast night I was able to convince my mom to sell her position in TSLA ($20,000) on the market open today. We both also sold other stock we didn't see much more potential in like TGT, FLEX and some USO we picked up when it was down. We made a nice profit on each of those picks. I now have $7,500 in cash and my mom has $24,000 in cash.\n\nI thought you all might like the update, so here it is. Also, last time I posted someone recommended picking up ENPH, which I didn't and is now up 500%. Oh well.",

        "selftext": "**Stocks go bonkers while the Dems take Georgia. The Capitol is breached. Is this the time to buy Solar, Pot &amp; Industrial stocks? Let\u2019s talk about this and other stock market news** \n\nHello everyone and Good Morning! So, let\u2019s start with the recap of yesterday as we saw a mixed day with the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/nsJ4qqL) leading the way up over 400points and closing at a new record high, with the broad stock market [SP500](https://ibb.co/kKxbFdQ) also finishing 0.57% up for the while the tech heavy [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/C7CdfX8) finished the day down 0.6%. All 3 of the big indexes were trading higher earlier in the day before the [VIX](https://ibb.co/4PR24Fc) saw a spike of more than 10% as rioters [STORMED](https://ibb.co/KjbQPkD) the US Capitol, before eventually getting back to certifying the electoral votes, which brought back some stability. This was a very bad incident but shouldn\u2019t have long-lasting effects on the stock market.\n\nYesterday we saw almost 70% of [COMPANIES](https://ibb.co/Br0Y0hB) advancing with over 300 new highs as the volume also spiked up, as 8 of the 11 [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/FmhD70s) finished in the green with Financials, Energy and Materials gaining more than 3%, while the biggest loser was by far the tech sectors, dropping 1.7%, as we saw Large-Cap Growth companies underperforming the [MARKET](https://ibb.co/XpbdM7p), while small &amp; mid-caps, especially the value plays, outperformed the market.\n\nHere is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/WKhNSZh) from yesterday which show how Big tech companies suffered yesterday, as the perceived threat of increased [TAXES](https://ibb.co/D79SMMP) spooked the market, while the Industrials, Financials, Green Energy &amp; [POT](https://ibb.co/XZFHGvj) stocks flourished on the hope of a big stimulus with new &amp; improved regulations, as it is expected that there will be an improved legislation that will help the cannabis stocks soar and the possible big stimulus would be a huge boost to most of the [RETAIL](https://ibb.co/GfwgQ3Z) sector which saw names like Nordstrom, GameStop, Target and many others posting big moves to the upside. Joining them should be [COSTCO](https://ibb.co/pQdXm2H), which did lag yesterday, but posted terrific December numbers after hours, with comparable sales increasing more than 10% while e-commerce rose by more than 60% for the month.\n\nYesterday we also saw the [FED](https://ibb.co/mFgqXN4) deciding to continue the current QE pace, as they still see plenty of uncertainty around, especially in the first quarter of 2021. They will continue to buy $120B worth of securities every month, as well as possibly moving on to some lengthier term maturities, while being opened to even more monetary easing if necessary.\n\nIn some more good news, we saw the [Factory Orders](https://ibb.co/jRqfPf7) for November coming it at +1%, better than expected as shipments increased by 0.7%.\n\nWhile in some other not so good numbers we saw the December [PMI](https://ibb.co/7XjyFjB) slowing to 55.3, less than the 55.7 expected and 58.6 in the previous month, but this is still an indicator of expanding business activity, while ADP [numbers](https://ibb.co/kJ6jjRx) came in worse than expected, as the US lost 123K nonfarm jobs, worse than the 130K addition of jobs expected and 304K jobs gained in the previous month, as we saw a big loss of jobs in large business especially in the leisure/hospitality [SECTOR](https://ibb.co/9sCLVqY). This was the first [month](https://ibb.co/3F8Q9j0) since April when we saw a lose of jobs in the nonfarm private business. \n\n[TODAY](https://ibb.co/vsB6NM2) we have a loaded economic data calendar starting with jobless numbers early in the morning and finishing with the Fed Balance Sheet at the market close.\n\nIn some other stock market news, we saw a report that [ROBLOX](https://ibb.co/3yqfGFZ) is looking to go public via direct listing, rather the traditional IPO. The latest funding round at $45/share saw the company valued at almost $30B, which is very high but we have to see the latest books of the company before making a prediction if it will go higher or not. This may be a better opportunity for retail investors to get in at lower prices, rather than buying at 2-3 times the IPO price.\n\nSo, guys, due to the latest political developments we have seen a huge shift in the markets, as we saw yesterday the [SOLAR](https://ibb.co/KWH2wHh) stocks having spectacular gains with Sunrun, &amp; SunPower gaining more than 16% with many other companies like [ENPHASE](https://ibb.co/72jTgdq) also soring, while the hydrogen play Plug Power also [soared](https://ibb.co/xDxrq80) more than 20% in after-hours after agreeing to a collaboration with SK Group.\n\nWe also saw gambling names move up after with the Senate changing leadership and states like New York pushing for the legalization of [gambling](https://ibb.co/CPFdVpv) in most of the US.\n\nWe also saw other companies posting great numbers, with [T-Mobile](https://ibb.co/qC2rXQC) adding 5.5M customers, its best ever number as they lead the industry, while [ROKU](https://ibb.co/qxWCNg4) continued to be one of the best plays in the streaming business alongside Disney &amp; Netflix as they have surpassed 50M accounts.\n\nAnd on the industrial side we saw companies like Caterpillar and US Steel posting big gains in anticipation of an infrastructure bill that would benefit them. \n\n[Ford](https://ibb.co/yNz7PjD) also beat expectations with a decline in sales of just under 10%, better than the 14% expected as the company continues to move towards more trucks, SUVs &amp; EVs.\n\nOn the other-hand we also saw [Chinese](https://ibb.co/rbRQwyq) tech and EV stocks fall, after more bad headlines like the US looking to ban even more big companies in the US like Alibaba &amp; Tencent. This is a continuing story which has peaked up steam in the recent year after the political tensions between the US and China have increased. This companies were also joined by the big tech which continuing to face selloff pressure after the blue sweep in Georgia.\n\nMy opinion is that you should start buying some green energy, pot and industrial stocks but you shouldn\u2019t go to heavy on the first day. You should wait for things to cool-off a little and not buy everything at the top. I think a bi-weekly split strategy or monthly strategy would be nice. Which would mean you should divide your investment money and buy especially on red days every couple of weeks or on a monthly basis, but I would avoid Chinese stocks for now at least.\n\nSo, let\u2019s hope for a good day in the market as the [WORLD](https://ibb.co/LCv8Dp1) markets are mixed while the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/wghkCJ1) seem to be pointing at a good open with the Nasdaq leading the way, though in the last few days every single time the futures were up the stocks finished higher and vice-verse, when the futures were red the stocks finished higher, so you shouldn\u2019t base your investment on this.\n\nThank you everyone for reading! Hope you enjoyed the content! Be sure to leave a comment down below with your opinion on the stock market! \n\nHave a great day and see you next time!",

        "selftext": "There is an ETF that makes trades based on artificial intelligence (ticker: AIEQ). The AI combs through mountains of data (expressly including social media and regular news reporting). When I heard about it, I was originally dubious about its ability to beat a relatively efficient market based on searching through this dataset, but I was curious. So I bought a little bit when it debuted, and it didn't do much of anything, and indeed kinda underperformed so I lost patience and sold it. But I remember an AI podcast I heard that talked about machine learning and how early on (with Chess, or Go, or other tests), humans would beat the AI easily. But then over time, AI progressively learned and then became unbeatable. So I took a flyer and bought back into AIEQ in early November and continued to leg into the position, and it continues to do well.\u00a0I ran a three month chart vs. SPY and Vanguard's Total Stock Index. It is beating both handily. (This is true on longer time periods also, but I didn't own it before November). Moreover, the outperformance seems to be accelerating, which could mean the AI is learning and improving as it goes.\n\nThat outperformance raised my eyebrows, and I was surprised that this dataset had in fact yielded actionable alpha. Then I heard about wallstreetbets. And then I made the connection - AIEQ may be outperforming because it is reading all the Reddit trade discussion, and is following or perhaps even front-running those trades. If you look at AIEQ's top portfolio positions, they are full of Reddit faves like TSLA, ENPH, SPWR, AMD, ROKU, ETSY, SQ, MRNA, ZS, CRWD, PLUG, etc. I don't know if my theory is correct (the AI trading methodology is a black box), but it's certainly food for thought.\n\nNOTE: I originally posted this in wallstreetbets but the moderator removed it for unknown reasons.(I've reviewed all of their content guidelines and am unable to find any that I violated, unless they just don't want people to know my theory). That said, it's applicable here too. In fact, maybe more so because this subreddit is more sober and analytical about topics.",

        "selftext": "Want to bring you guys some DD that will print. Look into Renesola or $SOL they just did a offering to a bank of a quarter billion dollars today which put the stock on sale. This is on top of recently paying off all of their debt and starting a venture into Europe of 1GW of energy this year. (1GW is worth 1 billion dollars alone) it\u2019s a steal at this price. It dropped from $35 to $25 today and will soon be in the $40-$50 range as it makes it way to $100. That would give it a 5 billion dollar market cap or for comparisons sake 1/5th of Enphase market cap (ENPH) when they make about 1/2 the revenue yearly. It\u2019s a HEAVILY underpriced stock and will PRINT. Congrats if you get in.\n\nIf you\u2019re wondering why it went down, They did a $250 million shelf offering to a bank. That tanked the price. It will be over after the 27th. Same thing happened at the $40 million offering 2 weeks ago it went from $21 to $16 then back up once the offering was done. Big boys are getting in. I think this will be a $100 stock at a minimum here soon. That $40 million wiped out the last of their debt they\u2019d been paying off the past decade or so ($1 billion) and they\u2019re now a clean green well running machine.\n\nPositions: 200 shares and 12 July $20 LEAPS\n\nI would buy shares or leaps with this and just watch it grow.",

Shoals makes electrical balance of systems (EBOS) solutions for the solar industry.  EBOS solutions (racking, wiring, etc) are needed to mount each solar panel (CSIQ, MAXN, JKS, FSLR, RUN, SPWR) and connect it to its inverter (ENPH, SEDG, [TSLA](https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/01/18/tesla-introduces-solar-inverter/). In June of 2017 [Oaktree Capital Management ](https://www.nashvillepost.com/business/technology/article/20865449/local-solar-manufacturer-announces-outside-investment) invested in the company.   Oaktree had a majority stake in Array Technologies that they acquiredin 2016.  In October 2020 Array Technologies [IPO\u2019d](https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/array-technology-shares-surge-after-first-big-us-solar-ipo-of-2020)at $22.

Shoal Technologies [begins trading](https://investmentu.com/shoals-technologies-ipo-stock/) on Jan 27th as SHLS. This should pump hard after it begins trading.  \n\n\nTL;DR - A company involved in the solar industry is IPO\u2019ing on the 27th and Oaktree Capital already holds a decent amount of the company and they also owned a decent chunk of Array (ARRY) before that IPO\u2019d.  We\u2019ve seen what happened with Array......this one has lots of potential as well",

AMSC 7/6 $30 C**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPreviously I wrote about Enphase Energy 1 year ago and people doubted the investment opportunity\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ct16c1/whos\\_with\\_me/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ct16c1/whos_with_me/)\n\nBack then, Enphase energy was trading at $32 and many people naysayers flooded my inbox. People looked at the P/E ratio and I had responses saying that it wouldn't hold. Well, look at where we are now; ENPH became an industry leader in microinverters for solar panel systems and is now trading at a 566% gain from when I posted that. Though I believe that there is still a long runway for ENPH and I do still have a position within it, I do believe that there is a potentially better investment moving forward.\n\nAs we all know, the Biden administration will push and promote renewables and renewable infrastructure within the next 4 years.\n\n\" He will launch\u00a0**a national effort aimed at creating the jobs we need to build a modern, sustainable infrastructure now and deliver an equitable clean energy future**. \"\n\n[https://joebiden.com/clean-energy/](https://joebiden.com/clean-energy/)\n\nThough most of the market is now aware of solar companies and wind energy companies, there is a huge gap in focus of infrastructure.\n\nThe next 4 years we will see a huge push and incentives for companies taking out age old infrastructure and replacing them with modern, ecofriendly, and more efficient systems to meet the rising demands of power.\n\nThat's where American Superconductor AMSC comes in.\n\nThis company specializes in MEGA-Watt scale power solutions that improve the performance of power grids., and electric utilities.\n\nAs we know, there is increasing demand for Electric vehicles thanks to companies like Tesla as well as ramping up production of EVs from other car manufacturers. There will also be new wind as well as solar farms propping up in the very near future to meet the goals of switching to renewable energy and away from fossil fuels.  In the near future, we're going to see a lot more charging stations, as well as more demand in infrastructure to deliver renewables energy into cities.\n\nTheir main product,  a high temperature superconductor (HTS) wire that will take up less space and transmit up to **10 times more power**, **allowing bulk transfer of transmission-level power at distribution voltages.**\n\nWe're going to need new infrastructure to scale up the demand for renewable energy. AMSC will be one of those companies that will rise in the coming months and years.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCurrently, it's trading at $28 and is set to have earnings reports after hours on 2/3/21.\n\nLooking at their EPS reports, the company has increased revenue over every single quarter over the past year. (Similar to ENPH a year ago.) ***And is still unknown to the masses.***\n\nQ1 2020 -0.24\n\nQ2 2020 -0.15\n\nQ3 2020 -.13\n\nQ4 - 2/3/21\n\nLooking at their past earnings, it's clear that this company is on track to have positive revenue within this year.\n\nGet in now before word breaks out!\n\n**Current Position: AMSC 7/6 $30 C 20**",

        "selftext": "There is an ETF that makes trades based on artificial intelligence (ticker: AIEQ). The AI combs through mountains of data (expressly including social media and regular news reporting). When I heard about it, I was originally dubious about its ability to beat a relatively efficient market based on searching through this dataset, but I was curious. So I bought a little bit when it debuted, and it didn't do much of anything, and indeed kinda underperformed so I lost patience and sold it. But I remember an AI podcast I heard that talked about machine learning and how early on (with Chess, or Go, or other tests), humans would beat the AI easily. But then over time, AI progressively learned and then became unbeatable. So I took a flyer and bought back into AIEQ in early November and continued to leg into the position, and it continues to do well.\u00a0Below is a screen shot of the three month chart vs. SPY and Vanguard's Total Stock Index. It is beating both handily. (This is true on longer time periods also, but I didn't own it before November).\n\nThat outperformance raised my eyebrows, and I was surprised that this dataset had in fact yielded actionable alpha. Then I heard about r/wallstreetbets (this is my first post here). And then I made the connection - AIEQ may be outperforming because it is reading all the Reddit trade discussion, and is following or perhaps even front-running those trades. If you look at AIEQ's top portfolio positions, they are full of Reddit faves like TSLA, ENPH, SPWR, AMD, ROKU, ETSY, SQ, MRNA, ZS, CRWD, PLUG, etc. I don't know if my theory is correct (the AI trading methodology is a black box), but I can tell you that I'm buying a lot more of this name. \n\n*Processing img l9c1t868ldd61...*",

Instrument ExchangeCADFUNDS: Instrument [SymbolFID5973.CF](https://SymbolFID5973.CF)\n2. Instrument ExchangeCADFUNDS: Instrument SymbolCIG1703.CF\n\nMy market value for these stocks are now $80,000 since investing of mark in last year (which i realize was a incredibly quick bounce back from a dip. Curently investing $1,200/month into the above two funds for the remainder of 2021.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI recently pulled $15,000 USD from my TFSA that i want to use to 'play' with in the market. i've been sturggling with how i want to break my portfilio up but after doing quite a bit of reading this past weekend I am starting to second guess my strategy of investing in all stocks.\n\nShould i may consider doing a 50/50 or 60/40 split with ETFS to stocks in this new wealth simple portfolio..\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nETFS im interested in are ARKK and ARKF which are already fairly similar to the funds i have above. Both hold SQ, Zoom ECT. Currently, Im leaning towards 25% in ARKK 25% in ARKF and then holding the other %50 in 4 stocks that im interested in which are MMED (canadian based phyclibin company), NIO, ENPH, PLTR.\n\nThis would be high risk portfolio that I ideally use for a down payment at some point.\n\nNot sure if im too highly leveraged on tech stocks in my protfolio and if i should consider something more steady like the VOO or VTF.. mixed with some stocks. \n\nI guess my main qustion is how should i be investing for my high risk wealth simple account. Do i want to try these very popular ARK funds or should i try to anchor what i have with the tride and true VOO/VTF.\n\nSecondly, should i start investing in my RRSPS to buy my first potential home?\n\nThansk in advance!",

        "selftext": "ASX: FLT\n\nBullish case: \n\nFlight centres biggest markets are (in order) Australia - America - UK. InAustralia we see no to little community transmissions and a planned rollout of vaccines early March. Without a vaccine there\u2019s been an increase of 200% in bookings in Australia through Flight centre online (and that\u2019s with borders starting to partially open up again) for December and throughout early 2021 with hotel and flights being fully booked out. Australia\u2019s market for flight centre is largely made up of corporate travel, however, that could change momentarily due to lockdown fatigued and people wanting to travel for leisure and go on a holiday (which mind you we already see a huge increase in demand for holidays) and corporate travel likely to come back even in small increments we could see a huge increase in revenue and profits in 2021\u2019s earnings (most likely beating expectations). An increase in profits is and a possible increase in profit margins due to operating cost decreasing and most likely staying at the same level until full operation. This is where it gets tricky though, they are well know for their walk in deals when customers come into the store, but since the recent closing of more than 100+ stores in Australia alone, Flight centre would have to heavily push for online consumption of their products. Which is why some people say Webjet is better placed, but flight centre has a lot of money due to their capital raising, and if they can use the money well and offer online deals, marketing campaigns and still keep open their remaining stores with in store deals. They will have multiple income streams from different infrastructures (unlike webjet). For example, boomers mostly don\u2019t know how to use the internet and would rather face to face because it feels more authentic while the younger generation don\u2019t care which one they use as long as they get discounted cheap prices for fully planned holidays that they themselves after lock down probably can\u2019t be stuffed planning themselves. Also there are quite a few vouchers by state governments incentivesing people to travel (not to sure how many or how much). \n\nThis also comes with Flight centre recently upgrading and improving their online ability to more efficiently help customers by upgrading to a K2 cloud operating system. \n\nhttps://www.google.com.au/amp/s/itbrief.com.au/amp/story/flight-centre-travel-group-updates-cx-and-operations-with-k2-cloud\n\n\nSo my price target in the next 6-12 months is $40, but this would mean People are willing to take the vaccine and corporate and leisure travel actually hit pre COVID level and even all time highs (which is doable but highly speculative)\n\n\n\nNOT FINACIAL ADVICE",

        "selftext": "Just wanted to get some thoughts on my current TFSA approach. \n\nI have split up of my TFSA account into \"dividend\" and \"risk\" stocks both contributing about 50% to the balance. The \"dividend\" stocks are: NPI, CM, BEP, BLX, HR, HMMJ. You can probably tell that this is already a fairly aggressive approach, but I think the 4 companies and the ETF and REIT are fairly solid picks. Also fairly heavy on renewable energy. I actively keep theses stocks balanced using dividends and contributions. Essentially, I keep buying CM and HR as their growth trails the other ones.\n\nMy \"risk\" stocks are PHO, FLT, CUB, PNG, GPV and GDNP. I got lucky with GPV as I got in at $1.97. I am not planning to take profits on these stocks unless this pool starts to dwarf my dividends stock, i.e. once the original 1:1 ratio between risk and dividend hits 2:1 I will re-balance and move profits from risk -&gt; dividend.\n\nThis approach has been working very well over the last 2 years and I saw some tremendous overall returns, but I am realistic and old enough to appreciate that this will these high returns cannot be sustained. Having said that, I do think an annual 25% increase should be possible (without contributions). I am already up %12+ this year. Out of principle I do not invest in any O&amp;G, mining or medical companies, mostly because I understand high tech companies much better, but also in parts out of conviction.\n\nI am expecting a correction on the renewable energy stocks at some point, but I believe that long term they alone should help me achieve my goals. \n\nSo, I guess the only questions I have is whether this approach is sane? Also, I am leaning towards weathering though any potential pull backs or even averaging down, especially on the renewables. Or does it make more sense to try and diversify now?",

It took me almost a year to develop it to my standard.\n* My private codes was used to develop it, and it's very unlikely I will sell it off to anyone or publish the code freely as it took me way too long to develop it. I rather post updates freely, at no cost to anyone than give out the code.\n* I will not be posting this hourly. It just too long to load everything up maybe in the future. I will post during open though.\n* Discord and telegram admins, don't try to monetize my bot suggestions to vulnerable people, when you don't even own the codes behind it.\n* There are a lot of SPY500/\"boomer\" companies within the bot, I thought about removing it but many people preferred that I kept it in there.\n* There won't be any sell signals, as stocks only go up, so I rather just do a discount algorithm.\n* Batch 1 = Algorithm/Bot + Human Judgement\n* Batch 2 = Algorithm/Bot Judgement Only\n* This is a one man bot.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Bot Overview**:\n\nIt's showing an opportunity that you may have missed otherwise, so you can decide for yourself if you want to pursue the discount of a stock for potential profits. Backtesting has not been done, do not YOLO your life savings into whatever stated risking it all.  Rather use this as a side tool.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Key:**\n\n* Pharma companies are very risky.\n* Meme/Hype stocks are very risky.\n* Companies that you don't know how they work are very risky.\n* Follower companies are very risky because they join the hype train (what NKLA is to TSLA).\n* I have a very low amount in options (less than $500), and I have 100k+ in shares and cash.\n* When doing options have a lot of collateral, so you don't hit margin call.\n* Take the \"Calls\" as very discounted, and \"Potentially A Call\" as somewhat discounted.\n* Old money companies are slow. While tech companies are fast-paced.\n* Only invest in companies that you do know and see potential in.\n* You don't have to invest every day, only when you see the potential.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;***At Close of Thursday***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Batch 1:**\n\n* Data Processing &amp; Outsourced Services\tMA\tMastercard Inc\n* Financial Exchanges &amp; Data\tMKTX\tMarketAxess Holdings Inc.\n* Financial Exchanges &amp; Data\tMSCI\tMsci Inc\n* BMS\tBraemar Shipping Services plc\n* CSRA\tCisadane Sawit Raya PT\n\n*Maybe*:\n\n* CRSR\tCorsair Gaming Inc\n* TWTR\tTwitter Inc\n* Data Processing &amp; Outsourced Services\tFLT\tFleetCor Technologies, Inc.\n* Data Processing &amp; Outsourced Services\tGPN\tGlobal Payments Inc\n* Data Processing &amp; Outsourced Services\tJKHY\tJack Henry &amp; Associates, Inc.\n* Environmental &amp; Facilities Services\tROL\tRollins, Inc.\n* Financial Exchanges &amp; Data\tCME\tCME Group Inc\n* Health Care Equipment\tBDX\tBecton Dickinson and Co\n* Health Care Equipment\tDXCM\tDexCom, Inc.\n* Industrial Conglomerates\tROP\tRoper Technologies Inc\n* Interactive Media &amp; Services\tTWTR\tTwitter Inc\n* Internet Services &amp; Infrastructure\tVRSN\tVerisign, Inc.\n* Managed Health Care\tHUM\tHumana Inc\n* Pharmaceuticals\tPRGO\tPerrigo Company PLC\n* Restaurants\tDPZ\tDomino's Pizza, Inc.\n* Restaurants\tMCD\tMcdonald's Corp\n* Research &amp; Consulting Services\tINFO\tIHS Markit Ltd\n* TYL\tTyler Technologies, Inc.\n* DPZ\tDomino's Pizza, Inc.\n* DXCM\tDexCom, Inc.\n* JKHY\tJack Henry &amp; Associates, Inc.\n* GPN\tGlobal Payments Inc\n* FB\tFacebook, Inc.
