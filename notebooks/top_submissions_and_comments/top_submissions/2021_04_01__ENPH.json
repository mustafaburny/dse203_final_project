        "selftext": "As I've talked about rotating my fun portfolio in honor of \"Sell in May and go away\" month and how I typically transition my holdings from a fuck ton of longs and only a couple of shorts to 15 longs and 35 companies I look to short until liquidity returns back to the market, a lot of people have been asking me what those are - particularly the 15.

This is also not a complete list, just a daily watch list of companies that I feel are going to fare roughly or whom have typically underperformed this time of year.

        "selftext": "Hello all,\n\nBefore I begin, I would like to thank each and every member of this sub for their contributions. I began my investing journey in February 2020 as a 39 yr old, newly divorced man. I guess the timing couldn\u2019t have been better, as I\u2019ve watched my net worth grow from 120k-600k in 14 months. My son was just born 6 weeks ago and I\u2019ve noticed my portfolio shrink by 15% even as the market has reached ATH. Highly speculative stocks brought me incredible returns, but now that I have a son, I think I should tone down the risk a bit. Since r/stocks and other investing subs have been so instrumental in my early stock market education, I thought I would solicit ideas to help diversify my portfolio. \n\nHere is what I own, after selling a bunch of spacs and a few other speculative assets. \n\n\u2022Pins -13% \n\u2022Net- 12%\n\u2022Sq- 10%\n\u2022Nike-7%\n\u2022SCHD-7%\n\u2022ENPh-5%\n\u2022Etsy-5%\n\u2022Se-5%\n\u2022Stmp-5%\n\u2022Jmia-4%\n\u2022Nvda-4%\n\u2022Crsr-3%\n\u2022Gan-3%\n\u2022Paysafe-3%\n\u2022Boeing -3%\n\u2022CNI- 3%\n\nCash- $25k \n\nI was thinking of adding Disney and JPM, but I would very much appreciate any other suggestions.

        "selftext": "Hi guys, like many of you, I started investing in the beginning of Feb. It's been a real struggle ever since, and seeing every day how other people make lots of money while I'm sitting on my (mostly) losses makes me feel like an incredible failure. \n\n*Just for the record: I don't own PLUG, ENPH etc., I'm being dragged down by stuff like DOCU and SPOT, and some European stocks which go down for seemingly no reason at all. Re-balancing didn't seem like a good option because I didn't want to sell e.g. SPOT at a loss to chase a gain which may never come.* \n\nI tried to just stay away from the news, but then I don't learn anything. And then everybody suddenly starts asking me why I didn't just buy dog$shit coin. Or even worse, people tell me about their 2020 gains and how loosing 20% is, like, nothing because they're still up 150%. \n\nHow do you deal with all of this? It's not even loosing money as such that bothers me, it's the feeling of being a complete failure. Is this something that goes away over time? Did you find methods to retain some inner peace and confidence, or did you have that kind of personality to begin with? \n\nI'm really looking for some advice.",

        "selftext": "Good Friday evening to all of you here on r/smallstreetbets. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning April 26th, 2021.\n\n# **Taxes and inflation will be key themes for markets in the week ahead - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/23/taxes-and-inflation-will-be-key-themes-for-markets-in-the-week-ahead.html)**\n*****\n&gt; The final week of April is going to be a busy one for markets with a Federal Reserve meeting and a deluge of earnings news.\n*****\n&gt; Hot topics in markets will continue to be inflation and taxes.\n*****\n&gt; President Joe Biden is expected to detail his \u201cAmerican Families Plan\u201d and the tax increases to pay for it, including a much higher capital gains tax for the wealthy. The plan is the second part of his Build Back Better agenda and will include new spending proposals aimed at helping families. The president addresses a joint session of Congress Wednesday evening.\n*****\n&gt; It\u2019s a huge week for earnings with about a third of the S&amp;P 500 reporting, including Big Tech names, such as Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon.\n*****\n&gt; As many have already done, firms like Boeing, Ford, Caterpillar and McDonald\u2019s, are likely to detail cost pressures they are facing from rising materials and transportation costs and supply chain disruptions.\n*****\n&gt; At the same time, the Fed is expected to defend its policy of letting inflation run hot, while assuring markets it sees the pick-up in prices as only temporary. The central bank meets on Tuesday and Wednesday.\n*****\n&gt; # The central bank takes the main stage\n&gt; \u201cI think the Fed would like not to be a feature next week, but the Fed will be forced from the background because of concerns about inflation,\u201d said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton.\n*****\n&gt; The central bank is not expected to make any policy moves, but Fed Chairman Jerome Powell\u2019s press briefing following the meeting Wednesday will be closely watched.\n*****\n&gt; So far, the barrage of earnings news has been positive, with 86% of companies reporting earnings beats. Corporate profits are expected to be up about 33.9% for the first quarter, based on estimates and actual reports, according to Refinitiv. Revenues are about 9.9% higher.\n*****\n&gt; There is important inflation data Friday when the Fed\u2019s preferred inflation gauge is reported.\n*****\n&gt; The personal consumption expenditure report is expected to show a 1.8% rise in core inflation, still below the Fed\u2019s target of 2%. Other data releases include the first-quarter gross domestic product on Thursday, which is expected to have grown by 6.5%, according to Dow Jones.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think the Fed has no urgency to shift monetary policy at this point,\u201d said Ian Lyngen, head of U.S. rates strategy at BMO. \u201cThe Fed needs to acknowledge that the data is improving. We had a strong first quarter.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe Fed needs to acknowledge that but at the same time they\u2019re keeping extremely accommodative policy in place, so they\u2019ll have to make a note to the fact that the easy policy is warranted,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; Lyngen said the Fed will likely point to continued concerns about the pandemic globally as a potential risk to the economic recovery.\n*****\n&gt; Powell is also expected to once more explain that the Fed will let inflation rise above its 2% target for a period of time before it raises rates so that the economy can have more time to heal. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a challenge for the Fed,\u201d said Swonk.\n*****\n&gt; The base effects for the next several months will make inflation appear to have jumped sharply because of the comparison to a weak period last year. The consumer price index for April could be above 3%, compared to 2.6% last month, Swonk added.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe Fed is trying to let a lot more people get out onto the dance floor before it calls \u2018last call,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cReally what Powell has been saying since day one is if we take care of people on the margins and bring them back into the labor force, the rest will take care of itself.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Stocks were slightly lower in the past week, and Treasury yields held at lower levels. The 10-year yield, which moves opposite price, was at 1.55% Friday.\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 was down 0.1%, ending the week at 4,180, while Nasdaq Composite was down nearly 0.3% at 14,016. The Dow was off just shy of 0.5% at 34,043.\n*****\n&gt; # Tax hike prospects\n&gt; Stocks were hit hard on Thursday when after a news report said that Biden is expected to propose a capital gains tax rate of 39.6% for people earning more than $1 million a year.\n*****\n&gt; Combined with the 3.8% net investment income tax, the new levy would more than double the long term capital gains rate of 20% or the richest Americans.\n*****\n&gt; Strategists said Biden is expected to propose raising the income tax rate for those earning more than $400,000.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think a lot of people are starting to price in the risk there going to be a significant increase in both corporate and capital gains taxes,\u201d said Lyngen.\n*****\n&gt; So far, companies have not provided much in the way of commentary on the proposed hike in corporate taxes to 28% from 21% but they have been talking about other costs.\n*****\n&gt; David Bianco, chief investment strategist for the Americas at DWS, said he expects larger companies will do better dealing with supply chain constraints than smaller ones. Big Tech is also likely to fare better during the semiconductor shortage than auto makers, which have already announced production shutdowns, he said.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cNext week is tech week. I think we\u2019re going to get down on our knees and just be in awe of their business models and their ability to grow at a behemoth scale,\u201d Bianco said.\n*****\n&gt; He said he\u2019s not in favor of Wall Street\u2019s popular trade into cyclicals and out of growth. He still favors growth.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe\u2019re overweight equities really because we\u2019re concerned about rising interest rates,\u201d Bianco said. \u201cI\u2019m not bullish in that I expect the market to rise that much from here.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe stuck with growth and dug deeper into bond substitutes, utilities, staples, real estate,\u201d he said, adding he is underweight industrials, energy and materials. \u201cEnergy is doomed. It\u2019s being nationalized via regulation. I do like industrials, they are well-run companies, but I do think infrastructure spending expectations for classic infrastructure are too high.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; He also said industrials are good businesses, but the stocks have become overvalued.\n*****\n&gt; Bianco said he likes big box stores, but smaller retailers are facing big challenges that were already impacting them prior to Covid. He also finds small biotech firms attractive.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI like healthcare stocks. Those valuations are reasonable. People have been paranoid about politicians beating on them since 1992. They manage through it and lately they\u2019ve been delivering,\u201d he said.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/03KqldG.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE S&amp;P SECTORS FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/FctG7IL.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/Iq1PKMJ.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/eegfti6.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/cdNcBaJ.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/yhkNZLm.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/9js7oZJ.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/g84GywG.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/64LgRnj.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/dD0vkLd.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/LaQNKey.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/rOIVB71.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/hKlmSsP.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/Fntbm0R.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Next Bump in Post-Election Year Rally Could Be in May\n\n&gt; As of yesterday\u2019s close, DJIA was up 10.5% year-to-date. S&amp;P 500 was up 10.1% and NASDAQ was at 7.0%. Compared to average post-election year historical performance since 1950 graphed in the charts above and below, DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ are all still comfortably above past post-election year average performance for this point of the year.\n\n&gt; Due to Covid-19, 2021 so far has been more volatile than the average post-election year. Aside from larger magnitude swings in performance, we have observed the return of seasonality with choppiness in February and weakness in March following monthly options expiration. Strength this April is also aligning with historical in post-election year April strength.\n\n&gt; Historically, the next area of potential concern for the current rally is just after mid-May. This is also right around the time Q1 earnings season is beginning to wrap and focus shifts to Q2 estimates, graduations, and other early summer activities.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/6d832ea3cc4bbc31e8cfe94f03d98ac6/8e21ed4124083bdb-70/s500x750/83b3d05531a38363e7eae827dfdc65cea7df6790.jpg))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/8d8b97ef2c731be8f580e16dbe25d431/8e21ed4124083bdb-5f/s500x750/1e8a68dfbdeea8147d89c8ac91122b1b05419ecb.jpg))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/cd741bab290266df3e64e5ed52a0d7a7/8e21ed4124083bdb-b0/s500x750/6384a25868caf6c5fcfad8e452b0ae508758114a.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Leading Indicators Suggest an Accelerating U.S. Economy\n\n&gt; The economic reacceleration is underway in the U.S., as the expanding vaccination campaign, lifting of mobility restrictions, and infusion of fiscal stimulus combined to lift the Conference Board\u2019s Leading Economic Index (LEI) in March. The LEI grew 1.3% month over month, ahead of Bloomberg consensus forecasts of 1%, raising the Conference Board\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) expectations to 6% on a year-over-year basis.\n\n&gt; After a weaker-than-expected February release that was primarily disrupted by the winter storm, data in March snapped back in a strong fashion. All ten components of the LEI rose in March, while jobless claims were the largest contributor to the growth of the index. Labor market data has continued to improve since the measurement period, as weekly jobless claims have posted back-to-back pandemic lows. The ISM New Orders Index was the second largest contributor to the LEI, which climbed to its highest levels since 2004.\n\n&gt; The Conference Board revised the February data lower, however, snapping what was a 10-month streak of growth for the index. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the LEI is back on the rise, suggesting further economic momentum in the coming months:\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/4.23.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; \u201cMomentum breeds momentum, and we expect the U.S. economy will continue to improve in the coming months as we move forward with reopening plans,\u201d noted LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cAs the rest of the world continues to improve as well, we expect some spill-over effects to also benefit the US economy.\u201d\n\n&gt; The U.S. is currently vaccinating around 3 million people per day, according to the Center for Disease Control (CDC), and over half of the adult population has received at least one dose of the vaccine. Meanwhile, over 80% of the population above the age of 65\u2014the most at-risk age segment of the population\u2014has received at least one dose of the vaccine. The improving vaccination data has helped embolden policymakers to lift restrictions, and prompted us to upgrade our GDP forecast for the U.S. to 6.25-6.75% in our recent Weekly Market Commentary.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # What Happens After The First Rate Hike?\n\n&gt; \u201cDon\u2019t fight the Fed.\u201d Old investment saying\n\n&gt; One of the popular questions we\u2019ve received lately is what do stocks do after the first rate hike? Let\u2019s be clear, we think the Federal Reserve Bank (Fed) will leave rates low until at least 2023, but what if we get a sudden dose of inflation? This isn\u2019t our base case, but a rate hike could potentially happen sooner in that situation.\n\n&gt; After all, the first rate hike in 2015 set off a huge sell-off into early February 2016, as the market was quite upset and let it be known that it felt the Fed acted too soon. In fact, the first hikes of 2004 and 1999 also saw losses the first three months after the first hike, but eventually stocks were in the green a year later.\n\n&gt; \u201cThe first hike in recent cycles has indeed brought with it some selling pressure, but hikes usually take place in strong economies, so it isn\u2019t surprising to see returns turn green once you go further out,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cBut let\u2019s not sound any alarms yet, we don\u2019t see a rate hike for a couple of years. Still, it\u2019s good to know what the playbook could be once it happens.\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, that initial rate hike can cause some hiccups the first three months, but returns turn much better 6- and 12-months later.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/4.21.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1)**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Twin Deficits and the US Dollar\n\n&gt; It was a particularly challenging year for the greenback in 2020, where the world\u2019s reserve currency acted as a \u201csafe haven\u201d asset at the height of the March 2020 market volatility, only to fall over the remainder of the year. With the U.S. outpacing much of the developed world in economic growth in 2021, Treasury yields have been rising and the dollar has strengthened, bucking the consensus view for dollar weakness.\n\n&gt; We view the \u201ctwin deficits\u201d of the U.S. economy\u2014the combination of the budget deficit and the current account deficit\u2014as a long-term structural driver of a weaker U.S. dollar. As a historical net importer, the U.S. has usually carried a trade deficit (leading to a broader current account deficit in the process), while the flood of pandemic aid has stretched the budget deficit and ballooned the sum of the twin deficits to all-time lows as a percent of gross domestic product (GDP). As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, changes in the twin deficits have been a relatively accurate predictor in the long-term trend of the value of the US dollar:\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/4.22.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; With the twin deficits reaching all-time lows, it\u2019s hard to be bullish the US dollar over the long-term relative to its major counterparts. \u201cThe short-dollar trade has certainly been a frustrating one for investors this year, but the long-term trend continues to point lower,\u201d added LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cHowever, a counter-trend rally like we saw in the first quarter might have been enough to flush out some of the crowded consensus for a lower dollar.\u201d\n\n&gt; U.S. economic growth has outpaced our developed nation counterparts to begin 2021, but expectations for growth in the rest of the world may be playing catch up. In particular, the 30-year German bund yield broke out to its highest level since the onset of the pandemic, suggesting growth expectations for one of our major trade partners may be on the rise.\n\n&gt; A soft dollar has a variety of investment implications. While we continue to favor U.S. stock market exposure over developed international markets, investments overseas may benefit from the tailwind of the softer dollar. Meanwhile, commodities have historically benefitted from a weaker dollar, and may be positioned for further upside as economic activity in the rest of the world heats up. For more on our tactical market views, check out our April Global Portfolio Strategy.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Dips in Short Supply\n\n&gt; While many areas of the market have seen sizable pullbacks this year, the broader market has been stingier. Just this morning, a client was lamenting the fact that they had a decent amount of cash, but the market just wasn't providing opportunities to get in. So far this year, the S&amp;P 500's largest decline from a peak (on a closing basis) has been 4.23%, and given that we're not even four full months into the year, we initially thought that 4% seemed normal enough especially when the earlier months of the year tend to be positive.\n\n&gt; In order to see how this year stacks up to prior years, the chart below shows the duration into each year (on a percentage basis) that the S&amp;P 500 first closed down 5% or more from its YTD peak. Years in green indicate that there wasn't a single point in the entire year that the S&amp;P 500 experienced a 5% decline. The last occurrence was in 2017, and there have been a total of seven years since 1928. As we near the end of April, we're nearly a third of the way into 2021, and compared to the 'average' year, we've already gone longer without a 5% pullback. Since 1928, the S&amp;P 500 usually experiences its first 5%+ pullback 28% of the way into the year, which coincidentally enough works out to April 15th - the day before Federal taxes are typically due! In fact, at this point in prior years, the S&amp;P 500 has already experienced its first 5%+ pullback more than 65% of the time. Believe it or not, in 30% of all years since 1928 the first 5% drop occurred in the month of January.\n\n&gt; Based on prior years, the market to this point has in fact been stingy in terms of providing opportunities for investors to add exposure, although based on today's reports of new capital gains tax increases from the Biden Administration, that window may soon open.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/04/042221-5-Pullbacks.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # What is a 200-Day Moving Average Again?\n\n&gt; If we've learned anything over the last two trading days after what seemed like a one-way move higher for the S&amp;P 500, it is that equities can also go down. Even after the declines of the last couple of days, though, the S&amp;P 500 still remains close to 4% above its 50-day moving average (DMA) and more than 10% above its 200-DMA. While there have been a handful of days since the COVID lows where the S&amp;P 500 has dipped below its 50-DMA, there hasn't been a single day since last June where the S&amp;P 500 came even close to testing its 200-DMA. We're only in late April now, but as long as the S&amp;P 500 doesn't see a significant fall in the next two months, it has the potential to go a full year without closing below its 200-DMA. When the 200-DMA does finally come into play again, many investors may not recognize what it is.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/04/042021-SP-500.png))**\n\n&gt; The chart below shows the percentage of time over a rolling one-year period that the S&amp;P 500 traded above its 200-DMA. At 89% now, the current level is hardly remarkable by historical standards. Right before the COVID crash last year, the percentage reached as high as 97.6%, and three years ago in March 2018, it was up at 100%. What is remarkable about the chart, though, is how elevated this moving average has been for so long. The last time it was below 50% was back in December 2009!\n\n&gt; It's easy to tell by looking at the chart, but thanks to short and swift pullbacks in the post-financial crisis period, this current streak without a sub-50% reading is the longest on record. To put a little more meat on the example, after the current streak of nearly 11.5 years, the next longest streak stretched over a period of just under ten years spanning from April 1991 through March 2001 while the one behind that was less than five years (ending in May 2008). And you only thought the market had been defying gravity recently!\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/04/042021-Above-200-DMA.png))**\n\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending April 23rd, 2021** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVSgvKq0pQw))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 4.25.21**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNEOWj2EubI))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt;

        "selftext": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/maxeon-announces-pricing-public-offering-095500335.html\n\nMAXN just priced their offering at $18 a share. That's 6.9M new shares, on a float of 13M and total of 30M. Thats a 23% dilution.\n\nAlso, that price point is some real management bullshittery, when MAXN was trading at $33 on April1 after the Biden infrastructure speech, and hit a peak of $52. Its as if the management always knew that MAXN was over valued, and priced the offering in line with their original split from SPWR price.\n\nThe revenue of MAXN in 2020 was 844M with a net loss of 144M.\n\nhttps://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=MAXN\n\nTheir revenue was down from 2019, but their net loss was lower too, mainly due to lower operating loss.\n\nTheir cash position is higher than in 2019, but with declining revenues this isn't really a compelling point.\n\nI think there is also an intangible here. Even though the underlying numbers may look okay, the behaviour of the leadership sets a tone for the future of the company.\n\nLets start first with the slide. MAXN is an offshoot of SPWR. SPWR announced their earnings in February and they were not great. This caused SPWR, MAXN and ENPH to all slide because all three companies are tied together at the hip.\n\nSince that slide, MAXN has done absolutely nothing to set investor expectations for the upcoming earnings. The stock slid from $52 at its peak down to $19 today when the offering was officially priced.\n\nIn that 6 week span, I'm certain that the leadership had known the underlying challenges to the company and its fair market value. Of course all is fair in business, but this behaviour does not give me confidence holding MAXN going forward as the leadership cannot be trusted to take care of their shareholders.\n\nThere was also a great post about this yesterday:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/mrog5u/opinion_on_maxn/guno907/\n\n\nAt this point, I don't believe MAXN will recover from its price point. I actually see MAXN sliding back to $12 before coming back up. It may get back up to $22, but I don't see it return to its $30+ glory days without some major turn around. Their primary installation partner (SPWR) is seeing reduced outlook and revenue on installations. Analysts are downgrading their models for SPWR, and MAXN has just put up numbers to reinforce their bad position.\n\nIf you're looking for a solar infrastructure and manufacturing play, I think SEDG is a better bet at this point that is more predictable, reliable and seems to have better management at the helm.\n\nWhat does everyone think about my reasoning?\n\nFull disclosure: I am a MAXN bag holder with cost average of $32. I should have sold on April 1 after the Biden speech, but I got too exuberant and didn't set good stop losses.",

        "selftext": "**Disclaimer:**  \nI understand that solar isn't something most people care about. But you know what? I see something, and I feel like I have a responsibility to share it.\n\nI am not a financial advisor, or even a professional trader. I don't want anyone to make any financial moves based off of my observations, especially since many of these observations are off the cuff, and the figures can be off. However, I would like to point some things out so that people much smarter than me could perhaps do the research.\n\nAlso, if I'm wrong on this and Sunworks is as good as the recent run up would imply, please, I urge you, let me know. I'm very much open to being wrong.\n\n**Moving on, Sunworks:**\n\n* Sunworks currently has a market cap of $450m, and was a penny stock until end of 2020.\n* As of 2020, they had 16 sales reps and fewer than 100 employees, according to their SEC filing.\n* They completed only roughly 500 installs for the year of 2020, a decline from 2019, despite 2020 being a great year for solar sales in California, which is one of, if not their primary, States for sales.\n* They had an accumulated debt of -$88m at the end of 2020, compared to something like -$75m 2019, meaning their debt is increasing.\n* They do not manufacture solar panels. They are simply a solar retailer, similar to SunRun and Sunnova, just on a much, much smaller scale, and similarly unprofitable.\n* They are facing serious headwinds on possible net metering changes in California, as well as interest rates (which fund their projects) increasing.\n* They're also facing headwinds of increasing shipping costs, as well as limited unit availability within the U.S.\n* It goes without saying, but their biggest headwind is steep competition from much bigger companies with much greater firepower (meaning ability to offer lower prices and greater volume), such as SunRun, Sunnova, and Tesla.\n* SUNW may be benefitting from solar hype in general, but with how far they're outpacing solar as a whole, and with what appears to be literally no justification, it looks unusual at best.\n\nJust for context, SunRun was established in **2007**, and has about **500,000 customers**.  \nSunworks was established in **2002**, and has somewhere between an estimated **10,000 and 20,000** customers (data unclear).\n\n**General Opinions:**\n\nIt's my belief that Sunwork's run up is either a market inefficiency, uneducated solar fomo, or simply just a pump &amp; dump. Please tread carefully. Buy it if you like it, don't if you don't.\n\nMy opinions on solar stocks, aside from Sunworks: I believe the solar industry is great, especially with the average price per kwh being in a position to beat the U.S. average cost of power, and I believe there are many good solar stocks worth considering, especially with the federal tax credit having been extended last year. ENPH/SEDG are my top picks (American + Inverter suppliers). I think both SPWR and NOVA have some potential as retailers. FSLR, CSIQ, and JKS are each solid panel manufacturers, and SPRQ is a good solar financing company.\n\nMy prioritization for the value of solar companies would be the following: Inverter Companies &gt; Panel manufacturers &gt; Financing Companies &gt; Large retailers &gt; Small retailers.\n\n**Wrap up:**\n\nCredibility: I'm pretty sure I've had more solar customers than Sunworks.\n\nDisclosure: I own a few Sunworks puts that I just bought today (less than half a percent of my portfolio), and will likely be buying more if it continues to climb without justification.\n\nTLDR: It looks bad.\n\nSunworks SEC source: [http://filings.irdirect.net/data/1172631/000149315221006917/form10k.pdf](http://filings.irdirect.net/data/1172631/000149315221006917/form10k.pdf)",

Since this drop, the stock has been able to regain some of its value, but it has not been able to completely regain its original value. This has been an overreaction on the part of the market due to increasing distrust in energy sources. The rising yield rates coupled with the power outages in Texas created a scenario in which the stock prices for enphase were being unrealistically decreased.\n\n**Thesis 2: Unprecedented, Favorable Political Environment**\n\nFavorable Policy Desires from President Biden as well as Political Consensus for Renewable Energy foreshadow an incredibly advantageous environment for ENPH\u2019s growth and wider integration in our near future post-Covid.\n\n* President Biden has included a 10-year extension for the ITC as well as the PTC for both clean power generation and energy storage within his recent $2 trillion infrastructure plan\u00a0\n   * Which ultimately implies\u00a0 ENPH will see an assured growth in investment as well as production\u00a0\n* Furthermore, this plan cuts electricity bills and carbon emissions related to power generation  \n\n   * Which should in effect lower ENPH costs\u00a0\n* Public Signaling via Biden\u2019s view for Federal gov\u2019t buildings\n   * Biden mandating federal gov\u2019t building to procure clean power for all of their supply needs 24/7\n   * This necessitates energy storage and sets the best example for how the process is feasible and better for households/buildings and energy consumption\u00a0 across the nation\u00a0\n* Politically there is consensus that renewable energy is necessary and desired despite different reasons\n   * Democrats prioritize curbing climate change, while Republicans are more motivated by reducing energy costs. Nevertheless, both are achieved via Biden\u2019s vision and with ENPH integration\n   * Increased consideration as a way to rebuild and stimulate the economy as well as increased necessity to strengthen infrastructure due to Covid collapse\n\n**Thesis 3: Enphase\u2019s Superior Technology**\n\nMicroinverters, release of the IQ 8, new battery storage technology\n\nEnphase is overwhelmingly dominant in the space of microinverters and this approach easily beats out competitors in terms of technological superiority\n\n* Three approaches: string inverters, string inverters with power optimizers, and Micro inverters\u00a0\n* Micro inverters are technologically superior and current trends have already proven them to be the best solution:\n   * Durability - only one to have a 25 year warranty\n   * The technology is very scalable and upgrading is easy - this allows consumers to gain exposure to solar energy while not having to worry about being able to accurately assess their energy needs both now and in the future\n      * Mass adoption of electric vehicles will precipitate a spike in consumers needing to install new solar panels\n      * Pandemic proves energy consumption can be unpredictable\n   * Safety concerns raised over home fires have pushed regulators in Australia and the US to favor micro inverters\n\nThe IQ 8 micro inverter is a game changer for off-grid solar systems\n\n* Allows for homes to maintain some power in the event of a grid-wide shutdown\n* Traditional off-grid solar systems that have batteries are expensive and reduce margin of profit substantially\n\nRelease of the Encharge battery storage systems\n\n* Expansion of product offering brings greater diversification\n* At full charge both battery and full PV capabilities are at your disposal\n* Expansion of partnerships with different solar installers (Sunnova - one of the largest solar providers, Momentum Solar - an Inc. 500 fastest growing private company, Solar Optimum - targeting Southern California, etc.)\n\nExpansion of digital offerings and tools via Sofdesk acquisition and acquisition of DIN\u2019s Design Services Business will accelerate expansion of the Enphase Installer Network (EIN)\n\n* In 2020, the EIN was expanded to Australia and, this month, it was expanded into Europe\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nEnphase Energy is a strong growth investment opportunity within the solar PV space and is poised to offer substantial returns in the long run:\u00a0\n\n1. Recent events in Texas and the continuation of natural disasters in other parts of the world open up a unique opportunity for battery storage to surge in popularity due to its independence from the grid and durability to continue providing electricity to homes in the case of disasters and grid failures\n2. The current administration\u2019s push for historic renewable energy investment bodes well for Enphase\u2019s long term prospects - especially as Congress finally reaches consensus on the extension of the investment tax credit to battery storage technology\n3. In addition, Enphase is poised to take an increasing piece of the pie as the pie continues to grow due to its superior technology and consistent evolution of its business\n\nCredit to **David\\_fan**, original post can be found [here](https://info.utradea.com/feed)",

The table is sorted by weight before the most recent change\n\nQuick TLDR for those of you that can't read tables:\n\n\\- 454,000 shares of PLUG were bought\n\n\\- 19,000,000 shares of Canadian Solar Inc were bought ($CSIQ)\n\n\\- ICLN now holds \u20ac27,000,000, up \u20ac7,000,000, and $8,600,000 , up $4,800,000 . \n\n\\- 55 million shares of COMPANHIA ENERGETICA MINAS GERAIS ($CIG) were sold, bringing their total holding down to 3 million shares\n\n\\- 2.5 million shares of SUNNOVA ENERGY INTERNATIONAL INC ($NOVA) were sold, bringing total shares held down to 3.3 million\n\n\\- $CIG and $NOVA were the only 2 stocks which had their positions decreased\n\nI think the fact that Blackrock have been continuously loading up on PLUG at the dip gives me a good reason to believe that their accounting error really is nothing. They bought another 130,000 shares in late March as well.\n\n|Ticker|Market Value (March 31)|Market Value (April 05)|Weight (March 31)(%)|Weight (April 05)(%)|Shares (March 31)|Shares (April 05)|Change in Shares|\n\n:--|:--|--:|:--|--:|--:|--:|--:|\n\n|PLUG|355,208,987.34|401,096,748.80|6.92|7.12|11,540,253.00|11,994,520.00|454,267.00|\n\n|ENPH|277,627,279.44|303,000,898.74|5.41|5.38|1,953,196.00|2,027,847.00|74,651.00|\n\n|VER|268,842,040.87|286,394,642.62|5.24|5.08|3,734,300.00|3,840,794.00|106,494.00|\n\n|SGRE|249,780,050.30|284,995,806.26|4.87|5.06|7,180,751.00|7,443,839.00|263,088.00|\n\n|VWS|233,779,197.06|259,996,035.72|4.55|4.61|1,214,384.00|1,258,904.00|44,520.00|\n\n|ORSTED|230,731,428.87|239,811,783.94|4.49|4.26|1,439,919.00|1,475,691.00|35,772.00|\n\n|MEL|219,395,699.40|241,290,949.69|4.27|4.28|60,133,448.00|61,245,104.00|1,111,656.00|\n\n|FSLR|218,406,314.20|230,595,493.76|4.25|4.09|2,676,220.00|2,774,248.00|98,028.00|\n\n|CEN|208,913,261.20|127,079,550.00|4.07|2.25|43,524,122.00|58,833,125.00|15,309,003.00|\n\n|EDPR|205,972,777.39|227,591,195.80|4.01|4.04|10,062,920.00|10,298,901.00|235,981.00|\n\n|ORA|202,078,133.52|216,349,817.60|3.94|3.84|2,690,071.00|2,759,564.00|69,493.00|\n\n|968|200,840,640.20|235,764,073.15|3.91|4.18|123,306,000.00|127,842,000.00|4,536,000.00|\n\n|DQ|191,723,879.76|224,197,550.92|3.73|3.98|3,084,361.00|3,197,341.00|112,980.00|\n\n|SCATC|189,703,209.81|207,528,669.68|3.7|3.68|6,638,798.00|6,826,979.00|188,181.00|\n\n|SEDG|179,505,612.00|192,470,628.48|3.5|3.42|690,300.00|715,584.00|25,284.00|\n\n|BLX|177,372,233.03|186,087,836.32|3.46|3.3|5,649,178.00|5,759,062.00|109,884.00|\n\n|INE|143,517,575.57|147,460,708.43|2.8|2.62|8,282,461.00|8,409,963.00|127,502.00|\n\n|RUN|139,902,796.73|154,536,421.48|2.73|2.74|2,695,103.00|2,801,603.00|106,500.00|\n\n|AY|133,971,430.26|147,421,892.80|2.61|2.62|3,984,873.00|4,050,052.00|65,179.00|\n\n|CIG|128,844,543.75|137,522,452.98|2.51|2.44|58,833,125.00|2,962,569.00|-55,870,556.00|\n\n|CSIQ|128,834,357.40|3,475,129.78|2.51|0.06|2,857,905.00|21,908,261.00|19,050,356.00|\n\n|ECV|117,902,183.90|129,147,774.80|2.3|2.29|6,424,816.00|6,570,299.00|145,483.00|\n\n|336260|114,970,510.72|115,802,755.50|2.24|2.05|2,516,342.00|2,606,371.00|90,029.00|\n\n|NOVA|106,169,262.48|122,386,810.90|2.07|2.17|5,901,599.00|3,320,315.00|-2,581,284.00|\n\n|SLR|101,598,832.16|110,878,085.74|1.98|1.97|4,986,597.00|5,052,496.00|65,899.00|\n\n|ELP|89,292,216.54|82,032,686.74|1.74|1.46|72,595,298.00|72,595,298.00|0.00|\n\n|NEOEN|88,817,322.11|104,194,320.07|1.73|1.85|1,984,296.00|2,055,668.00|71,372.00|\n\n|REGI|76,737,957.92|89,245,998.84|1.49|1.58|1,272,181.00|1,408,332.00|136,151.00|\n\n|PCELL|71,506,530.91|82,125,680.59|1.39|1.46|2,660,593.00|2,758,033.00|97,440.00|\n\n|ENLT|30,676,369.71|29,511,097.84|0.6|0.52|15,959,621.00|15,959,621.00|0.00|\n\n|EUR|20,931,383.82|29,905,604.48|0.41|0.53|17,793,500.00|25,346,955.00|7,553,455.00|\n\n|NEODS|8,009,173.31|8,033,003.04|0.16|0.14|2,420,368.00|2,420,368.00|0.00|\n\n|XTSLA|5,860,000.00|33,510,000.00|0.11|0.59|5,860,000.00|33,510,000.00|27,650,000.00|\n\n|NZD|4,129,348.99|6,536,064.44|0.08|0.12|3,355,627.00|9,257,226.00|5,901,599.00|\n\n|USD|3,731,216.40|8,603,534.67|0.07|0.15|3,731,217.00|8,603,534.00|4,872,317.00|\n\n|NZD|2,347,932.07||0.05||||0.00|\n\n|CAD|1,004,491.72|1,114,110.24|0.02|0.02|1,267,217.00|1,394,699.00|127,482.00|\n\n|CAD|951,173.91|221,591,682.77|0.02|3.93|1,199,953.00|44,328,674.00|43,128,721.00|\n\n|DKK|810,770.31|-10,871.89|0.02|0|5,125,528.00|-18,236,983.00|-23,362,511.00|\n\n|HBCFT|1,078,000.00|2,367,000.00|0.02|0.04|1,078,000.00|2,367,000.00|1,289,000.00|\n\n|HKD|721,798.05|721,501.01|0.01|0.01|5,610,248.00|5,610,248.00|0.00|\n\n|KRW|671,990.15|810,655.38|0.01|0.01|760,390,455.00|914,095,011.00|153,704,556.00|\n\n|NOK|373,782.88|1,944,638.96|0.01|0.03|3,199,563.00|16,543,141.00|13,343,578.00|\n\n|EBR||511,518.60|0|0.01|0.00|82,770.00|82,770.00|\n\n|ENLT|576.63|554.73|0|0|300|300|0.00|\n\n|ESM1|0|0|0|0|97|213|116.00|\n\n|EUR||12,498.15|0|0|0.00|6,217,987.00|6,217,987.00|\n\n|EUR||-28,101.17|0|0|0.00|-6,200,612.00|-6,200,612.00|\n\n|ILS|129,673.89|129,861.23|0|0|431,769.00|429,802.00|-1,967.00|\n\n|REGI|18,096.00|19,011.00|0|0|300|300|0.00|\n\n|SEK|128,655.01|128,379.47|0|0|1,120,148.00|1,118,371.00|-1,777.00|\n\n|NOK||-9,929.60||0|3,267,752.00|-24,493,696.00|-27,761,448.00|",

        "selftext": "Increasing governmental policy support worldwide to achieve net zero carbon emissions has incentivized Wall Street to place huge bets on the renewable energy industry. Consequently, many solar companies are finding new ways to capitalize on the industry tailwinds, and analysts expect Enphase Energy (NASDAQ:ENPH), SolarEdge (SEDG), and ReneSola (SOL) to deliver more than 20% returns in the next 12 months. Let\u2019s discuss these names in more detail.The renewable energy industry has been surging since the second half of 2020 on investor optimism surrounding policy support from governments around the world to achieve net-zero carbon emissions. Because solar is one of the most popular renewable energy sources, shares of companies in the sector have been surging over the past year. Furthermore, President Biden\u2019s interest in the electrification of vehicles over the next few years is motivating various solar companies to find efficient ways to charge electric vehicles with solar power.\nGiven the current industry tailwinds, Wall Street is placing huge bets on the solar industry. This has driven a rally in solar stocks, as evidenced by Invesco Solar Portfolio ETF\u2019s (TAN) 210.4% returns over the past year versus S&amp;P 500\u2019s 50% gains.\n\nBased on consensus price targets, we think prominent solar stocks Enphase Energy, Inc. (ENPH), SolarEdge Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:SEDG), and ReneSola Ltd. (SOL) have the potential to rally by more than 20% in the next 12 months.",

        "selftext": "**Disclaimer:**  \nListen, I know this probably isn't the place to post this. I understand that solar isn't something most people care about. But you know what? I see something, and I feel like I have a responsibility to share it.\n\nI might be a moron, it's a real possibility, and I want to assure everyone here, I am not a financial advisor, or even a professional trader. I don't want anyone to make any financial moves based off of my observations, especially since many of these observations are off the cuff, and the figures can be off. However, I would like to point some things out so that people much smarter than me could perhaps do the research.\n\nAlso, if I'm wrong on this and Sunworks is as good as the recent run up would imply, please, I urge you, let me know. I'm very much open to being wrong.\n\n**Moving on, Sunworks:**\n\n* Sunworks currently has a market cap of $450m, and was a penny stock until end of 2020. \n* As of 2020, they had 16 sales reps and fewer than 100 employees, according to their SEC filing. \n* They completed only roughly 500 installs for the year of 2020, a decline from 2019, despite 2020 being a great year for solar sales in California, which is one of, if not their primary, States for sales. \n* They had an accumulated debt of -$88m at the end of 2020, compared to something like -$75m 2019, meaning their debt is increasing.\n* They do not manufacture solar panels. They are simply a solar retailer, similar to SunRun and Sunnova, just on a much, much smaller scale, and similarly unprofitable.\n* They are facing serious headwinds on possible net metering changes in California, as well as interest rates (which fund their projects) increasing. \n* They're also facing headwinds of increasing shipping costs, as well as limited unit availability within the U.S.\n* It goes without saying, but their biggest headwind is steep competition from much bigger companies with much greater firepower (meaning ability to offer lower prices and greater volume), such as SunRun, Sunnova, and Tesla.\n* SUNW may be benefitting from solar hype in general, but with how far they're outpacing solar as a whole, and with what appears to be literally no justification, it looks unusual at best.\n\nJust for context, SunRun was established in **2007**, and has about **500,000 customers**.  \nSunworks was established in **2002**, and has somewhere between an estimated **10,000 and 20,000** customers (data unclear).\n\n**General Opinions:**\n\nIt's my belief that Sunwork's run up is either a market inefficiency, uneducated solar fomo, or worse. Please tread carefully with this stonk. Buy it if you like it, don't if you don't.\n\nMy opinions on solar stocks, aside from Sunworks: I believe the solar industry is great, especially with the average price per kwh being in a position to beat the U.S. average cost of power, and I believe there are many good solar stocks worth considering, especially with the federal tax credit having been extended last year. ENPH/SEDG are my top picks (American + Inverter suppliers). I think both SPWR and NOVA have some potential as retailers. FSLR, CSIQ, and JKS are each solid panel manufacturers, and SPRQ is a good solar financing company. \n\nMy prioritization for the value of solar companies would be the following: Inverter Companies &gt; Panel manufacturers &gt; Financing Companies &gt; Large retailers &gt; Small retailers.\n\n  \n**Wrap up:**\n\nCredibility: I'm pretty sure I've had more solar customers than Sunworks.\n\nDisclosure: I own a few Sunworks puts that I just bought today (less than half a percent of my portfolio), and will likely be buying more if it continues to climb without justification.\n\nTLDR: It looks bad man.\n\n  \nSunworks SEC source: [http://filings.irdirect.net/data/1172631/000149315221006917/form10k.pdf](http://filings.irdirect.net/data/1172631/000149315221006917/form10k.pdf)\n\nEdit: I apologize to my fellow apes if this is a bad post.  \nEdit 2: I also apologize for not including rocket emojis, or recognizing GME as the one true stonk.",

        "selftext": "Good Friday evening to all of you here on r/StockMarket. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning April 26th, 2021.\n\n# **Taxes and inflation will be key themes for markets in the week ahead - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/23/taxes-and-inflation-will-be-key-themes-for-markets-in-the-week-ahead.html)**\n*****\n&gt; The final week of April is going to be a busy one for markets with a Federal Reserve meeting and a deluge of earnings news.\n*****\n&gt; Hot topics in markets will continue to be inflation and taxes.\n*****\n&gt; President Joe Biden is expected to detail his \u201cAmerican Families Plan\u201d and the tax increases to pay for it, including a much higher capital gains tax for the wealthy. The plan is the second part of his Build Back Better agenda and will include new spending proposals aimed at helping families. The president addresses a joint session of Congress Wednesday evening.\n*****\n&gt; It\u2019s a huge week for earnings with about a third of the S&amp;P 500 reporting, including Big Tech names, such as Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon.\n*****\n&gt; As many have already done, firms like Boeing, Ford, Caterpillar and McDonald\u2019s, are likely to detail cost pressures they are facing from rising materials and transportation costs and supply chain disruptions.\n*****\n&gt; At the same time, the Fed is expected to defend its policy of letting inflation run hot, while assuring markets it sees the pick-up in prices as only temporary. The central bank meets on Tuesday and Wednesday.\n*****\n&gt; # The central bank takes the main stage\n&gt; \u201cI think the Fed would like not to be a feature next week, but the Fed will be forced from the background because of concerns about inflation,\u201d said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton.\n*****\n&gt; The central bank is not expected to make any policy moves, but Fed Chairman Jerome Powell\u2019s press briefing following the meeting Wednesday will be closely watched.\n*****\n&gt; So far, the barrage of earnings news has been positive, with 86% of companies reporting earnings beats. Corporate profits are expected to be up about 33.9% for the first quarter, based on estimates and actual reports, according to Refinitiv. Revenues are about 9.9% higher.\n*****\n&gt; There is important inflation data Friday when the Fed\u2019s preferred inflation gauge is reported.\n*****\n&gt; The personal consumption expenditure report is expected to show a 1.8% rise in core inflation, still below the Fed\u2019s target of 2%. Other data releases include the first-quarter gross domestic product on Thursday, which is expected to have grown by 6.5%, according to Dow Jones.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think the Fed has no urgency to shift monetary policy at this point,\u201d said Ian Lyngen, head of U.S. rates strategy at BMO. \u201cThe Fed needs to acknowledge that the data is improving. We had a strong first quarter.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe Fed needs to acknowledge that but at the same time they\u2019re keeping extremely accommodative policy in place, so they\u2019ll have to make a note to the fact that the easy policy is warranted,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; Lyngen said the Fed will likely point to continued concerns about the pandemic globally as a potential risk to the economic recovery.\n*****\n&gt; Powell is also expected to once more explain that the Fed will let inflation rise above its 2% target for a period of time before it raises rates so that the economy can have more time to heal. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a challenge for the Fed,\u201d said Swonk.\n*****\n&gt; The base effects for the next several months will make inflation appear to have jumped sharply because of the comparison to a weak period last year. The consumer price index for April could be above 3%, compared to 2.6% last month, Swonk added.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe Fed is trying to let a lot more people get out onto the dance floor before it calls \u2018last call,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cReally what Powell has been saying since day one is if we take care of people on the margins and bring them back into the labor force, the rest will take care of itself.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Stocks were slightly lower in the past week, and Treasury yields held at lower levels. The 10-year yield, which moves opposite price, was at 1.55% Friday.\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 was down 0.1%, ending the week at 4,180, while Nasdaq Composite was down nearly 0.3% at 14,016. The Dow was off just shy of 0.5% at 34,043.\n*****\n&gt; # Tax hike prospects\n&gt; Stocks were hit hard on Thursday when after a news report said that Biden is expected to propose a capital gains tax rate of 39.6% for people earning more than $1 million a year.\n*****\n&gt; Combined with the 3.8% net investment income tax, the new levy would more than double the long term capital gains rate of 20% or the richest Americans.\n*****\n&gt; Strategists said Biden is expected to propose raising the income tax rate for those earning more than $400,000.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think a lot of people are starting to price in the risk there going to be a significant increase in both corporate and capital gains taxes,\u201d said Lyngen.\n*****\n&gt; So far, companies have not provided much in the way of commentary on the proposed hike in corporate taxes to 28% from 21% but they have been talking about other costs.\n*****\n&gt; David Bianco, chief investment strategist for the Americas at DWS, said he expects larger companies will do better dealing with supply chain constraints than smaller ones. Big Tech is also likely to fare better during the semiconductor shortage than auto makers, which have already announced production shutdowns, he said.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cNext week is tech week. I think we\u2019re going to get down on our knees and just be in awe of their business models and their ability to grow at a behemoth scale,\u201d Bianco said.\n*****\n&gt; He said he\u2019s not in favor of Wall Street\u2019s popular trade into cyclicals and out of growth. He still favors growth.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe\u2019re overweight equities really because we\u2019re concerned about rising interest rates,\u201d Bianco said. \u201cI\u2019m not bullish in that I expect the market to rise that much from here.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe stuck with growth and dug deeper into bond substitutes, utilities, staples, real estate,\u201d he said, adding he is underweight industrials, energy and materials. \u201cEnergy is doomed. It\u2019s being nationalized via regulation. I do like industrials, they are well-run companies, but I do think infrastructure spending expectations for classic infrastructure are too high.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; He also said industrials are good businesses, but the stocks have become overvalued.\n*****\n&gt; Bianco said he likes big box stores, but smaller retailers are facing big challenges that were already impacting them prior to Covid. He also finds small biotech firms attractive.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI like healthcare stocks. Those valuations are reasonable. People have been paranoid about politicians beating on them since 1992. They manage through it and lately they\u2019ve been delivering,\u201d he said.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/03KqldG.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE S&amp;P SECTORS FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/FctG7IL.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/Iq1PKMJ.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/eegfti6.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/cdNcBaJ.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/yhkNZLm.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/9js7oZJ.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/g84GywG.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/64LgRnj.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/dD0vkLd.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/LaQNKey.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/rOIVB71.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/hKlmSsP.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/Fntbm0R.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Next Bump in Post-Election Year Rally Could Be in May\n\n&gt; As of yesterday\u2019s close, DJIA was up 10.5% year-to-date. S&amp;P 500 was up 10.1% and NASDAQ was at 7.0%. Compared to average post-election year historical performance since 1950 graphed in the charts above and below, DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ are all still comfortably above past post-election year average performance for this point of the year.\n\n&gt; Due to Covid-19, 2021 so far has been more volatile than the average post-election year. Aside from larger magnitude swings in performance, we have observed the return of seasonality with choppiness in February and weakness in March following monthly options expiration. Strength this April is also aligning with historical in post-election year April strength.\n\n&gt; Historically, the next area of potential concern for the current rally is just after mid-May. This is also right around the time Q1 earnings season is beginning to wrap and focus shifts to Q2 estimates, graduations, and other early summer activities.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/6d832ea3cc4bbc31e8cfe94f03d98ac6/8e21ed4124083bdb-70/s500x750/83b3d05531a38363e7eae827dfdc65cea7df6790.jpg))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/8d8b97ef2c731be8f580e16dbe25d431/8e21ed4124083bdb-5f/s500x750/1e8a68dfbdeea8147d89c8ac91122b1b05419ecb.jpg))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/cd741bab290266df3e64e5ed52a0d7a7/8e21ed4124083bdb-b0/s500x750/6384a25868caf6c5fcfad8e452b0ae508758114a.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Leading Indicators Suggest an Accelerating U.S. Economy\n\n&gt; The economic reacceleration is underway in the U.S., as the expanding vaccination campaign, lifting of mobility restrictions, and infusion of fiscal stimulus combined to lift the Conference Board\u2019s Leading Economic Index (LEI) in March. The LEI grew 1.3% month over month, ahead of Bloomberg consensus forecasts of 1%, raising the Conference Board\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) expectations to 6% on a year-over-year basis.\n\n&gt; After a weaker-than-expected February release that was primarily disrupted by the winter storm, data in March snapped back in a strong fashion. All ten components of the LEI rose in March, while jobless claims were the largest contributor to the growth of the index. Labor market data has continued to improve since the measurement period, as weekly jobless claims have posted back-to-back pandemic lows. The ISM New Orders Index was the second largest contributor to the LEI, which climbed to its highest levels since 2004.\n\n&gt; The Conference Board revised the February data lower, however, snapping what was a 10-month streak of growth for the index. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the LEI is back on the rise, suggesting further economic momentum in the coming months:\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/4.23.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; \u201cMomentum breeds momentum, and we expect the U.S. economy will continue to improve in the coming months as we move forward with reopening plans,\u201d noted LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cAs the rest of the world continues to improve as well, we expect some spill-over effects to also benefit the US economy.\u201d\n\n&gt; The U.S. is currently vaccinating around 3 million people per day, according to the Center for Disease Control (CDC), and over half of the adult population has received at least one dose of the vaccine. Meanwhile, over 80% of the population above the age of 65\u2014the most at-risk age segment of the population\u2014has received at least one dose of the vaccine. The improving vaccination data has helped embolden policymakers to lift restrictions, and prompted us to upgrade our GDP forecast for the U.S. to 6.25-6.75% in our recent Weekly Market Commentary.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # What Happens After The First Rate Hike?\n\n&gt; \u201cDon\u2019t fight the Fed.\u201d Old investment saying\n\n&gt; One of the popular questions we\u2019ve received lately is what do stocks do after the first rate hike? Let\u2019s be clear, we think the Federal Reserve Bank (Fed) will leave rates low until at least 2023, but what if we get a sudden dose of inflation? This isn\u2019t our base case, but a rate hike could potentially happen sooner in that situation.\n\n&gt; After all, the first rate hike in 2015 set off a huge sell-off into early February 2016, as the market was quite upset and let it be known that it felt the Fed acted too soon. In fact, the first hikes of 2004 and 1999 also saw losses the first three months after the first hike, but eventually stocks were in the green a year later.\n\n&gt; \u201cThe first hike in recent cycles has indeed brought with it some selling pressure, but hikes usually take place in strong economies, so it isn\u2019t surprising to see returns turn green once you go further out,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cBut let\u2019s not sound any alarms yet, we don\u2019t see a rate hike for a couple of years. Still, it\u2019s good to know what the playbook could be once it happens.\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, that initial rate hike can cause some hiccups the first three months, but returns turn much better 6- and 12-months later.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/4.21.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1)**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Twin Deficits and the US Dollar\n\n&gt; It was a particularly challenging year for the greenback in 2020, where the world\u2019s reserve currency acted as a \u201csafe haven\u201d asset at the height of the March 2020 market volatility, only to fall over the remainder of the year. With the U.S. outpacing much of the developed world in economic growth in 2021, Treasury yields have been rising and the dollar has strengthened, bucking the consensus view for dollar weakness.\n\n&gt; We view the \u201ctwin deficits\u201d of the U.S. economy\u2014the combination of the budget deficit and the current account deficit\u2014as a long-term structural driver of a weaker U.S. dollar. As a historical net importer, the U.S. has usually carried a trade deficit (leading to a broader current account deficit in the process), while the flood of pandemic aid has stretched the budget deficit and ballooned the sum of the twin deficits to all-time lows as a percent of gross domestic product (GDP). As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, changes in the twin deficits have been a relatively accurate predictor in the long-term trend of the value of the US dollar:\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/4.22.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; With the twin deficits reaching all-time lows, it\u2019s hard to be bullish the US dollar over the long-term relative to its major counterparts. \u201cThe short-dollar trade has certainly been a frustrating one for investors this year, but the long-term trend continues to point lower,\u201d added LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cHowever, a counter-trend rally like we saw in the first quarter might have been enough to flush out some of the crowded consensus for a lower dollar.\u201d\n\n&gt; U.S. economic growth has outpaced our developed nation counterparts to begin 2021, but expectations for growth in the rest of the world may be playing catch up. In particular, the 30-year German bund yield broke out to its highest level since the onset of the pandemic, suggesting growth expectations for one of our major trade partners may be on the rise.\n\n&gt; A soft dollar has a variety of investment implications. While we continue to favor U.S. stock market exposure over developed international markets, investments overseas may benefit from the tailwind of the softer dollar. Meanwhile, commodities have historically benefitted from a weaker dollar, and may be positioned for further upside as economic activity in the rest of the world heats up. For more on our tactical market views, check out our April Global Portfolio Strategy.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Dips in Short Supply\n\n&gt; While many areas of the market have seen sizable pullbacks this year, the broader market has been stingier. Just this morning, a client was lamenting the fact that they had a decent amount of cash, but the market just wasn't providing opportunities to get in. So far this year, the S&amp;P 500's largest decline from a peak (on a closing basis) has been 4.23%, and given that we're not even four full months into the year, we initially thought that 4% seemed normal enough especially when the earlier months of the year tend to be positive.\n\n&gt; In order to see how this year stacks up to prior years, the chart below shows the duration into each year (on a percentage basis) that the S&amp;P 500 first closed down 5% or more from its YTD peak. Years in green indicate that there wasn't a single point in the entire year that the S&amp;P 500 experienced a 5% decline. The last occurrence was in 2017, and there have been a total of seven years since 1928. As we near the end of April, we're nearly a third of the way into 2021, and compared to the 'average' year, we've already gone longer without a 5% pullback. Since 1928, the S&amp;P 500 usually experiences its first 5%+ pullback 28% of the way into the year, which coincidentally enough works out to April 15th - the day before Federal taxes are typically due! In fact, at this point in prior years, the S&amp;P 500 has already experienced its first 5%+ pullback more than 65% of the time. Believe it or not, in 30% of all years since 1928 the first 5% drop occurred in the month of January.\n\n&gt; Based on prior years, the market to this point has in fact been stingy in terms of providing opportunities for investors to add exposure, although based on today's reports of new capital gains tax increases from the Biden Administration, that window may soon open.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/04/042221-5-Pullbacks.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # What is a 200-Day Moving Average Again?\n\n&gt; If we've learned anything over the last two trading days after what seemed like a one-way move higher for the S&amp;P 500, it is that equities can also go down. Even after the declines of the last couple of days, though, the S&amp;P 500 still remains close to 4% above its 50-day moving average (DMA) and more than 10% above its 200-DMA. While there have been a handful of days since the COVID lows where the S&amp;P 500 has dipped below its 50-DMA, there hasn't been a single day since last June where the S&amp;P 500 came even close to testing its 200-DMA. We're only in late April now, but as long as the S&amp;P 500 doesn't see a significant fall in the next two months, it has the potential to go a full year without closing below its 200-DMA. When the 200-DMA does finally come into play again, many investors may not recognize what it is.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/04/042021-SP-500.png))**\n\n&gt; The chart below shows the percentage of time over a rolling one-year period that the S&amp;P 500 traded above its 200-DMA. At 89% now, the current level is hardly remarkable by historical standards. Right before the COVID crash last year, the percentage reached as high as 97.6%, and three years ago in March 2018, it was up at 100%. What is remarkable about the chart, though, is how elevated this moving average has been for so long. The last time it was below 50% was back in December 2009!\n\n&gt; It's easy to tell by looking at the chart, but thanks to short and swift pullbacks in the post-financial crisis period, this current streak without a sub-50% reading is the longest on record. To put a little more meat on the example, after the current streak of nearly 11.5 years, the next longest streak stretched over a period of just under ten years spanning from April 1991 through March 2001 while the one behind that was less than five years (ending in May 2008). And you only thought the market had been defying gravity recently!\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/04/042021-Above-200-DMA.png))**\n\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending April 23rd, 2021** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVSgvKq0pQw))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 4.25.21**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNEOWj2EubI))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt;

        "selftext": "I like to keep a track of this for myself, but I'm sure some of you longer term retards are also interested to see what's going on with ICLN, so below you'll find the changes. On the far right of the table, you can also see how many shares were bought/sold. The table is sorted by weight before the most recent change\n\nQuick TLDR for those of you that can't read tables:\n\n- 454,000 shares of PLUG were bought\n\n- 19,000,000 shares of Canadian Solar Inc were bought ($CSIQ)\n\n- ICLN now holds \u20ac27,000,000, up \u20ac7,000,000, and $8,600,000 , up $4,800,000 .\n\n- 55 million shares of COMPANHIA ENERGETICA MINAS GERAIS ($CIG) were sold, bringing their total holding down to 3 million shares\n\n- 2.5 million shares of SUNNOVA ENERGY INTERNATIONAL INC ($NOVA) were sold, bringing total shares held down to 3.3 million\n\n- $CIG and $NOVA were the only 2 stocks which had their positions decreased\n\nI think the fact that Blackrock have been continuously loading up on PLUG at the dip gives me a good reason to believe that their accounting error really is nothing. They bought another 130,000 shares in late March as well.\n\n\n|Ticker|Market Value (March 31)|Market Value (April 05)|Weight (March 31)(%)|Weight (April 05)(%)|Shares (March 31)|Shares (April 05)|Change in Shares|\n:--|:--|--:|:--|--:|--:|--:|--:|\n|PLUG|355,208,987.34|401,096,748.80|6.92|7.12|11,540,253.00|11,994,520.00|454,267.00|\n|ENPH|277,627,279.44|303,000,898.74|5.41|5.38|1,953,196.00|2,027,847.00|74,651.00|\n|VER|268,842,040.87|286,394,642.62|5.24|5.08|3,734,300.00|3,840,794.00|106,494.00|\n|SGRE|249,780,050.30|284,995,806.26|4.87|5.06|7,180,751.00|7,443,839.00|263,088.00|\n|VWS|233,779,197.06|259,996,035.72|4.55|4.61|1,214,384.00|1,258,904.00|44,520.00|\n|ORSTED|230,731,428.87|239,811,783.94|4.49|4.26|1,439,919.00|1,475,691.00|35,772.00|\n|MEL|219,395,699.40|241,290,949.69|4.27|4.28|60,133,448.00|61,245,104.00|1,111,656.00|\n|FSLR|218,406,314.20|230,595,493.76|4.25|4.09|2,676,220.00|2,774,248.00|98,028.00|\n|CEN|208,913,261.20|127,079,550.00|4.07|2.25|43,524,122.00|58,833,125.00|15,309,003.00|\n|EDPR|205,972,777.39|227,591,195.80|4.01|4.04|10,062,920.00|10,298,901.00|235,981.00|\n|ORA|202,078,133.52|216,349,817.60|3.94|3.84|2,690,071.00|2,759,564.00|69,493.00|\n|968|200,840,640.20|235,764,073.15|3.91|4.18|123,306,000.00|127,842,000.00|4,536,000.00|\n|DQ|191,723,879.76|224,197,550.92|3.73|3.98|3,084,361.00|3,197,341.00|112,980.00|\n|SCATC|189,703,209.81|207,528,669.68|3.7|3.68|6,638,798.00|6,826,979.00|188,181.00|\n|SEDG|179,505,612.00|192,470,628.48|3.5|3.42|690,300.00|715,584.00|25,284.00|\n|BLX|177,372,233.03|186,087,836.32|3.46|3.3|5,649,178.00|5,759,062.00|109,884.00|\n|INE|143,517,575.57|147,460,708.43|2.8|2.62|8,282,461.00|8,409,963.00|127,502.00|\n|RUN|139,902,796.73|154,536,421.48|2.73|2.74|2,695,103.00|2,801,603.00|106,500.00|\n|AY|133,971,430.26|147,421,892.80|2.61|2.62|3,984,873.00|4,050,052.00|65,179.00|\n|CIG|128,844,543.75|137,522,452.98|2.51|2.44|58,833,125.00|2,962,569.00|-55,870,556.00|\n|CSIQ|128,834,357.40|3,475,129.78|2.51|0.06|2,857,905.00|21,908,261.00|19,050,356.00|\n|ECV|117,902,183.90|129,147,774.80|2.3|2.29|6,424,816.00|6,570,299.00|145,483.00|\n|336260|114,970,510.72|115,802,755.50|2.24|2.05|2,516,342.00|2,606,371.00|90,029.00|\n|NOVA|106,169,262.48|122,386,810.90|2.07|2.17|5,901,599.00|3,320,315.00|-2,581,284.00|\n|SLR|101,598,832.16|110,878,085.74|1.98|1.97|4,986,597.00|5,052,496.00|65,899.00|\n|ELP|89,292,216.54|82,032,686.74|1.74|1.46|72,595,298.00|72,595,298.00|0.00|\n|NEOEN|88,817,322.11|104,194,320.07|1.73|1.85|1,984,296.00|2,055,668.00|71,372.00|\n|REGI|76,737,957.92|89,245,998.84|1.49|1.58|1,272,181.00|1,408,332.00|136,151.00|\n|PCELL|71,506,530.91|82,125,680.59|1.39|1.46|2,660,593.00|2,758,033.00|97,440.00|\n|ENLT|30,676,369.71|29,511,097.84|0.6|0.52|15,959,621.00|15,959,621.00|0.00|\n|EUR|20,931,383.82|29,905,604.48|0.41|0.53|17,793,500.00|25,346,955.00|7,553,455.00|\n|NEODS|8,009,173.31|8,033,003.04|0.16|0.14|2,420,368.00|2,420,368.00|0.00|\n|XTSLA|5,860,000.00|33,510,000.00|0.11|0.59|5,860,000.00|33,510,000.00|27,650,000.00|\n|NZD|4,129,348.99|6,536,064.44|0.08|0.12|3,355,627.00|9,257,226.00|5,901,599.00|\n|USD|3,731,216.40|8,603,534.67|0.07|0.15|3,731,217.00|8,603,534.00|4,872,317.00|\n|NZD|2,347,932.07||0.05||||0.00|\n|CAD|1,004,491.72|1,114,110.24|0.02|0.02|1,267,217.00|1,394,699.00|127,482.00|\n|CAD|951,173.91|221,591,682.77|0.02|3.93|1,199,953.00|44,328,674.00|43,128,721.00|\n|DKK|810,770.31|-10,871.89|0.02|0|5,125,528.00|-18,236,983.00|-23,362,511.00|\n|HBCFT|1,078,000.00|2,367,000.00|0.02|0.04|1,078,000.00|2,367,000.00|1,289,000.00|\n|HKD|721,798.05|721,501.01|0.01|0.01|5,610,248.00|5,610,248.00|0.00|\n|KRW|671,990.15|810,655.38|0.01|0.01|760,390,455.00|914,095,011.00|153,704,556.00|\n|NOK|373,782.88|1,944,638.96|0.01|0.03|3,199,563.00|16,543,141.00|13,343,578.00|\n|EBR||511,518.60|0|0.01|0.00|82,770.00|82,770.00|\n|ENLT|576.63|554.73|0|0|300|300|0.00|\n|ESM1|0|0|0|0|97|213|116.00|\n|EUR||12,498.15|0|0|0.00|6,217,987.00|6,217,987.00|\n|EUR||-28,101.17|0|0|0.00|-6,200,612.00|-6,200,612.00|\n|ILS|129,673.89|129,861.23|0|0|431,769.00|429,802.00|-1,967.00|\n|REGI|18,096.00|19,011.00|0|0|300|300|0.00|\n|SEK|128,655.01|128,379.47|0|0|1,120,148.00|1,118,371.00|-1,777.00|\n|NOK||-9,929.60||0|3,267,752.00|-24,493,696.00|-27,761,448.00|",
