Bullish on these tickers but given the number of positions in the portfolio I only have a cursory understanding of those businesses so I'm trying to trim the number of stocks I own - going for quality over quantity. This portfolio beats the SP when I backtested my purchases using SP instead of these tickers but maybe I can do better if I get rid of the gain diluting stocks? Looking for suggestions on what should go and feel free to suggest other positions not on this list that may be better than some of the positions I already have for long term growth. Looking for more genomics exposure as well (maybe ARGK but not a fan of higher expense ratios).
