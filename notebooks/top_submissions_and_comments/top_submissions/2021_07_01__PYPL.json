        "selftext": " For context: I've been a ROBLOX developer for 8 years, on the platform for 11 years. I have 200M+ total visits (visits work like youtube views) and made $250k usd from roblox in the past year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n If you're a boomer, roblox is not a game, it's more of a marketplace/app store. Developers make games, players buy robux and spend them in games, developers convert the robux to usd. Roblox charges the standard fee of 30% on all robux transactions between players. The part  where they rip devs off, is how much USD they get from robux. If you buy robux, then convert that robux back to USD, you will not get the same amount you paid, even before the 30% tax.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n Let's calculate how much roblox actually takes. If you spend $100 on robux, you will get 10,000 robux. After you spend all the robux in a game, the developer will get 7,000 robux after 30% tax. The current robux to usd rate is 100,000 robux for $350, with a minimum of 100,000 to cash out. That means the developer ends up with $24.50 from a player spending $100 in their game. Roblox is taking a 75.5% cut on robux earnings, compared to 30% on Steam or Apple app store. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n It gets worse, some devs aren't able to convert their robux to usd at all. Developers must be approved before they can convert robux. Even if all the robux came from legitimate means, some devs aren't accepted. This is an issue with roblox contractors (smaller developers who do commission work) and they can only get around that by accepting PayPal.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n What does this mean? Roblox is making bank off their developers, and the developers are fine with it. Lots of the developers are kids (under 18) and many from third world countries, so money has more value to them. Developers also fear the competition on other app stores where there are already established game dev companies. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy position: [2000 shares at $86.45](https://prnt.sc/1e15x8u)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Roblox takes 75.5% of earnings on robux from devs, devs don't care.

        "selftext": "SOFI seems to have hit a bottom around $17.25 today... and with PIPE selling exhausted- is ready to move much higher. (and what little selling may occur from employees- is a drop in the ocean compared to retail buyers... considering SOFI has less than 1000 employees). \n\n\nCramer just included SoFI as 1 of the post merger SPACs to buy now. SOFI has all buy ratings from analysts- with an initial $30 price target.  SoFI also has one of the highest short float % at around 45% (which meaning many Millions of shares have to he bought to cover those short positions). \n\n\nAnd with a market cap under $14B, SOFI is extremely undervalued (consider Robinhood going public later this summer around $40B.. likely to be $60B after 1st day of trading).  Buying SOFI anywhere near current prices- will definitely be a winner going forward.... and if SOFI gets several days of sustained volume... it is very likely to have a big run/squeeze combo in the immediate future. But its a definite big winner either way.  Not to mention a 2 for 1 deal... as Galileo will be worth just as much as SOFI- and an option to spin off in the Future (similar to EBay &amp; Paypal)\n\n\n**Summary of SOFI Becoming a Fintech Behemoth**\n\nFintech is becoming the next big disruptor- and Sofi is being positioned to be the real leader in this category (and currently- the dinosaur banks have market caps of 300B, $450B, etc). Not only is SOFI the only internet bank with the full slate of financial products...\nthey also have Galileo for the platform/\nSoftware fintech play... just look at the top quality leadership team SOFI is attracting... Anthony Noto as CEO.. CFO came from Uber... person in charge of Galileo from Google,etc.\n\n\n**Overview of Business **\n\nSoFi acquisition of Golden Pacific will make it a\nnational bank, like JPMorgan Chase. This will\nallow SOFI to take direct deposits &amp; make\nloans based on those deposits, rather than\nacting as a re-seller.\n\nSofi also offers Credit Cards &amp; recently\nannounced it deal to offer auto loans. Also,\ntheres SoFi brokerage, which competes with\nRobinhood.\n\nThen add to the mix, Galileo, a payments\nprocessor (ie Stripe, Square ) it bought for\n$1.2B. Galileo dominates the Banking-as-a-\nService (BaaS) ecosystem. Galileo offers\nbanking platform for over 90% of all digital\nbanks in North America. Over 70% of Top100\nFintechs globally are clients- including Chime\nand Robinhood.",

        "selftext": "[The Robinhood IPO Is Coming Soon. Steer Clear. \u2013 Market Trading Essentials](https://www.markettradingessentials.com/2021/07/the-robinhood-ipo-is-coming-soon-steer-clear/) \n\n[**Market Trading Essentials**](https://www.markettradingessentials.com/author/markettradingessentials/)  **July 23, 2021**\n\n[ Illustration by Andrea Chronopoulos ](https://preview.redd.it/qo4exqjladd71.png?width=2000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=58a33c334195bb7cdac3a39175c5d7cf0eaab40a)\n\nThere will be no velvet rope at Robinhood Markets\u2019 big debut on Thursday. The company is offering up to a third of its shares [in its initial public offering](https://www.barrons.com/articles/robinhood-ipo-51626693536?mod=article_inline) to the Average Joes who use its app, instead of the Wall Street suits who usually get first dibs. The wisdom of those crowds may validate the $35 billion valuation that the company projected [in a prospectus](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001783879/000162828021013986/robinhoods-1a1.htm). But its numbers don\u2019t.\n\nMake no mistake, Robinhood is a truly transformational company. Founders Vlad Tenev and Baiju Bhatt took a simple premise\u2014zero commissions\u2014and upended the brokerage industry. Its success forced the other major brokers to eliminate commissions and opened the door to millions of new investors who had never traded before. The company estimates that nearly half of all new brokerage accounts in the U.S. between 2016 and 2021 were opened at Robinhood. That\u2019s even more impressive given that 2020 was a record year for new accounts in the U.S., and 2021 is shaping up to be even better.\n\nRobinhood is on track to generate enough revenue this year to justify a valuation of $35 billion in theory. It reported revenue of $522 million in the first quarter, and the company estimated that it pulled in between $546 million and $574 million in the second.\n\nThomas Mason, an analyst at S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence, notes that when TD Ameritrade was a fast-growing broker in 1999, it traded at more than 26 times total net revenue. That would value Robinhood, with $1.35 billion in total net revenue for the four quarters ended March 31, at $35 billion.\n\nRobinhood\u2019s problem, however, is [the quality and sustainability of its revenue](https://www.barrons.com/articles/robinhood-ipo-meme-stocks-51625266076?mod=article_inline). At least three quarters of it comes from routing customers\u2019 trades to trading firms that execute the trades and profit off the spread between the bid and the ask, a practice called payment for order flow. During trading frenzies, payment for order flow rises. But when trading slumps, payment for order flow slumps, too. That\u2019s one reason most other brokers rely on other revenue streams for the majority of their revenue. Payment for order flow is also in the crosshairs of regulators, with Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Gary Gensler [raising concerns about it](https://www.barrons.com/articles/gary-gensler-says-sec-is-focusing-on-spacs-and-retail-trading-apps-51624460483?mod=article_inline) in recent weeks.\n\n**Robinhood by the Number**\n\n**The online trading platform released second-quarter financial estimates ahead of its initial public offering next week.**\n\n[ Note: The numbers in the filing are preliminary and subject to change. ](https://preview.redd.it/4azuzj2u9dd71.png?width=775&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=501e13fc5f12122fba0bd5be0a4ff531301c335c)\n\nRobinhood is also highly dependent on cryptocurrency trading, another area now getting a close review by the SEC. Trading in Dogecoin, the joke cryptocurrency favored by Elon Musk, made up about 6% of the company\u2019s revenue in the first quarter. \n\nThomas Peterffy, the chairman of Interactive Brokers, which focuses on more experienced traders, has been impressed by Robinhood and its ability to introduce new people into the market. \u201cI\u2019m a little bit talking my own book, because we get five to 10 customers from Robinhood every day,\u201d he says. But he wouldn\u2019t invest in the IPO. \u201cI like to understand the profitability of a business,\u201d he said. \u201cBut there is not a simple way to project Robinhood\u2019s profits going forward, or even understand it going backward.\u201d  \n\nRobinhood could pivot to other business models\u2014its goal is to branch out into lending and payments. But the company\u2019s forays into new areas have not gone well so far. In fact, they have sometimes flopped in spectacular ways. In 2018, it had to withdraw its plan to offer checking and savings accounts after being called out for misleading marketing and a lack of insurance, and later backtracked on plans to offer trading in the U.K. and to obtain a bank charter. *Barron\u2019s* has followed Robinhood\u2019s twists and turns, [including a cover story last August](https://www.barrons.com/articles/what-is-robinhood-apps-next-act-its-already-mastered-the-stock-market-game-51597451777?mod=article_inline).\n\nThere has been a boom in new IPOs this year, which has created a lot of opportunities for investors. These opportunities also come with great risk. Here\u2019s what you need to know \n\nThe company says in its prospectus that its customers \u201calready trust us with their hard-earned cash and assets,\u201d so they will likely trust it to take care of their other needs as they grow their wealth. The company did not reveal just how much of that hard-earned money the typical customer has put in her account, but the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority said in an enforcement letter that the median Robinhood customer had $240 in her account as of February.\n\nMany investors seem to consider Robinhood their \u201cplay-money account,\u201d says Hugh Tallents, senior partner at management consultancy cg42, which surveyed more than 1,000 account-holders at various brokers about their habits this year. To justify the valuation, \u201ccustomers will have to change their financial behavior to integrate a lot of their financial life with a company that has been mired in scandal for a long time. I just don\u2019t see that being likely,\u201d Tallents says.\n\nNearly every financial technology company is now focused on cross-selling customers on multiple services. [Square](https://www.barrons.com/quote/SQ) (SQ), Stash, [PayPal](https://www.barrons.com/quote/PYPL) (PYPL), [SoFi Technologies ](https://www.barrons.com/quote/SOFI)(SOFI) and more all want a bigger piece of your financial life. And some are able to make better first impressions. SoFi is known for refinancing student loans, for instance.\n\nGetting from a student loan to a mortgage is \u201ca bit of a layup,\u201d Tallents says. \u201cIt\u2019s far harder to envisage a world where people take a quite basic tool, which Robinhood is by design, and put a lot of their debt-based products or their savings accounts and integrate those things together.\u201d\n\n**Write to** Avi Salzman at [avi.salzman@barrons.com](mailto:avi.salzman@barrons.com)",

        "selftext": "# SOFI to Fly Pre earnings 8/20\n\n**I have read so many DD's on this sub regarding SOFI. Many of those DD's were just people trying to pump their position in order get some tendies. I will make sure to only summarize and include some parts of those DD's that were not meant for pump &amp; dump. This is a NON BIASED SOFI DD &amp; Analysis. Let's get started -**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***What is SOFI?***\n\n**Social Finance, Inc aka SoFi** is an American online personal finance company. A mobile-first service based in San Francisco, SoFi provides a suite of financial products that includes student loan refinancing, checking accounts, mortgages, personal loans, credit cards, stock investing and banking through both their mobile app and desktop interfaces. It is an ALL in one app for all your financial and investing needs.\n\nLook at the products sofi has to offer. The company has an amazing easy to use user interface and very smooth app.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u1bam7fqzec71.png?width=2658&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=64ff396904447a22bd4d94af98271f93887d63b1\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# What separates SOFI from other competitors?\n\nThe one single factor that gains Sofi a lot of revenue and sales is **\"Convenience\".** Because they provide a lot of services, they are able to attract their customers to get different products.\n\nLet's say you decide to buy a car and go to Sofi for a car loan. The Sofi team asks you to provide your Social security, pay stubs, previous bills, etc. and then finally grants you a car loan. Now, let's say after 3 months your friend who has been making a bank trading AMC and GME tells you to invest and you don't have a brokerage account. You eventually would end up knocking SOFI's door and ask them to let you invest because why the fuck would you want to fill out forms and apply at other brokerages. Now, let's say after couple of months of trading, you end up losing all your money because you're an APE who yolo'ed entire savings into 1st ever options play. Now, you need money for that business degree because you suck at investing. What would you do here? Would you go to some student loan company and fill out all the forms, provide credit history, etc. or would you just call up SOFI and ask them to loan you some tendies? The simple answer is **\"Call up SOFI\" because it's convenient.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# SOFI also came up with IPO investing.\n\nYou can now invest in IPO's even before they're traded on an exchange. Cool, innit?Unlike Robinhood, SOFI would never restrict the sale of the securities to the members in secondary markets. However, if you invest in an IPO and sell within 30 days then you might be restricted from IPO purchase for next 30 days or so. More details can be found on their website - \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bcmkpaqrzec71.png?width=2852&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=afbaa5cff6c608b2262c4ee20a53d4c9fa06893b\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# History of SOFI &amp; how did it become such a big company\n\nSoFi was founded in 2011 by Mike Cagney, Dan Macklin, James Finnigan, and Ian Brady, four students who met at the Stanford. The founders hoped SoFi could provide more affordable options for those taking on debt to fund their education. The company's inaugural loan program was a $2 million pilot at Stanford. For this pilot, 40 alumni invested about $2 million in approximately 100 students, for an average of $20,000 per student.\n\nThe founders were soon able to raise $1billion from softbank few years ago. The company is very successful and trading way below their valuation price.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Let's have a look at the SOFI's chart this year\n\nThis is 1 year chart for Sofi, it has a very very strong support at 15$. The stock has gone below 15$ only twice in 2021 and then rallied the following 2 weeks. The movement of this stock is like a spring, a huge dip is followed by an insane highs. The earnings are due 8/20 and I strongly believe that this stock will run before the earnings.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/na00wbnszec71.png?width=2134&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cb97b09ec2f01c7b8085470e82a09c6ac9243ca2\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Price Targets\n\nMichael Miller, an equity analyst at morning star said that $20.50 is a Fair Value for this stock. It's currently trading at $15.10 at the time of writing this DD. That's an upside of 25%.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vgaq59ntzec71.png?width=672&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=22ec9ef2f9c9302c86e930bd90db0a8641bb7c96\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***Summary of why is SOFI a good play?***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* A very strong support at 15$ price, in the last 7-8 months, this stock has rallied after a huge dip. With the earnings coming up for this company, I am positive that there will be a rally.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Sofi is positioned to be a #1 leader in the fintech sector. They are jacks of all trades and offering different products to their customers all within one app or website.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Convenience of being able to apply for student loans, investing, mortgages will attract consumers because who wants to end up applying at different companies for different needs.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Sofi acquired GALILEO which is a very big company. You haven't heard of this company yet because it's a B2B company. Sofi paid about 1.2B$ for it. They're basically a payment processing platform like stripe, square, paypal etc which is used by all top fintech companies around the globe.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* The main goal of SOFI is to be able to provide as many products and services they can to their consumers. They are soon going to be a OneStopShop. Their goal is to basically become an amazon of FinTech and provide all the services in one place. By acting as a one-stop shop for its customer\u2019s finances, SoFi intends to create powerful cross-selling advantages that will reduce its cost of acquisition and give it a competitive advantage in the marketplace.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* SOFI has acquired Golden Pacific Bancorp and applying to become a national bank in the US.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* The company saw its client growth accelerate in 2020, with more than 2.2 million members on its platform by the end of the first quarter of 2021.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* The company\u2019s expanded product lineup along with increased adoption of digital banking during the pandemic has helped accelerate SoFi\u2019s growth, with the number of members increasing by nearly 80-90% in 2020. Rapid growth has continued into 2021, and SoFi remains the only company utilizing a digital full-service model, giving it a clear product niche. Source - morningstar\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* It is projected that SOFI would get an approval to become a bank in late 2021 or early 2022.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* It is projected that revenue will increase at a 43% CAGR over the next five years as the company benefits from its unique product offering as well as the revenue contributed by its 2020 acquisition of Galileo, which is only the one section of SOFI.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* During the company\u2019s SPAC merger, the company issued equity to PIPE investors to raise more than $1.2 billion in capital, on top of the $800 million that was generated by the SPAC merger itself. This along with debt paydown that occurred both immediately prior and during the SPAC merger has left the company in a good financial position.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* SoFi has more than $2 billion in cash and over $4 billion in debt, but that entire debt money is used to finance its lending activities. I believe that there is only little financial risk for SoFi, and incase company decides to re strategize their investment decisions then they would have plenty of money to do so.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* The adjusted Net Revenue and EBITDA are increasing and trending in the right direction, with 151% and 70% growth YOY respectively and the total products used by members has grown by 121% YOY and financial products has grown 273% YOY.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TLDR ;**\n\n**Not a Finance Advice**\n\n**The stock could rally prior to earnings on 8/20**\n\n**$18-$20 calls expiring 8/20**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPosition :\n\n50 contracts, strike 20$ expiring 8/20\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/auclbtwlzec71.jpg?width=739&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9eb33422179e9b6c0ca93bdb94ff0c177132697b",

SoFI also has one of the highest short float % at around 45% (which meaning many Millions of shares have to he bought to cover those short positions). \n\n\nAnd with a market cap under $14B, SOFI is extremely undervalued (consider Robinhood going public later this summer around $40B.. likely to be $60B after 1st day of trading).  Buying SOFI anywhere near current prices- will definitely be a winner going forward.... and if SOFI gets several days of sustained volume... it is very likely to have a big run/squeeze combo in the immediate future. But its a definite big winner either way.  Not to mention a 2 for 1 deal... as Galileo will be worth just as much as SOFI- and an option to SPIN on in the Future (similar to EBay &amp; Paypal)\n\n\n**Summary of SOFI Becoming a Fintech Behemoth**\n\nFintech is becoming the next big disruptor- and Sofi is being positioned to be the real leader in this category (and currently- the dinosaur banks have market caps of 300B, $450B, etc). Not only is SOFI the only internet bank with the full slate of financial products...\n\nthey also have Galileo for the platform/\nSoftware fintech play... just look at the top quality leadership team SOFI is attracting...

        "selftext": "Now that I got your attention, I\u2019m thinking there is going to be a (possibly major) correction mid-way next week.\n\n**FA:**\n\nFOMC meeting is on July 28 and they will be, yet again, discussing fiscal and monetary policies. Fed funds rate could remain at &lt;=0.25% or bump up. The rise in fed fund rate is pretty unlikely as JPow communicated that QE slowdown will precede interest rate hikes, but there's a good chance that tapering will be further discussed. US exports have climbed back to precovid numbers, US imports are higher than ever before despite DXY getting slapped meanwhile the GDP target has risen for 2021 signaling a sooner than anticipated economic recovery. Not to mention the continuous MoM CPI climbs in absurd amounts and the US operating at a massive trade deficit, all signal that tapering may start in the very near term despite JPow repeating how far we are from the economic target. However, officials have echoed on numerous fronts, the interest rate is not expected to see a hike until 2023; although, they predict that tapering plans will be announced in Fall of this year, but with everything seeming to go back to status quo sooner than expected, tapering or other bearish monetary policies could be announced and implemented shortly.\n\nTech earnings week is fast approaching. It\u2019s unlikely the prices will hold when tech stocks sit at all time highs and the ER forecast for blue chips remain stagnant compared to its previous quarters.\n\n**TA:**\n\nTA says we\u2019re reaching upper level resistance. Volatility is extremely high on the upside and can trigger HFT or quant funds to reduce inventory. We can expect higher levels of volatility (VIX futures that is only 1 week dte trading at roughly 20% from current levels).\n\n[Reaching critical trend line resistance. Consider QQQ to have a upside of +1&amp;#37; from here at $370\\~$371](https://preview.redd.it/2pp016pjbzc71.png?width=1546&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3248a4a2286ac3add6b4a7351682104e2ff5a773)\n\nEWT says we\u2019re reaching the massive correction cycle. It's the same shit when it comes to tech earnings run-up followed by the dump in spite of a decent performance.\n\nUncertainty creates risk and risk drives fear so the fact that ER release (granted a beat) by the blue chips might not be large enough to justify current prices, or the possible sector rotation that may ensue post ER release, or the possible tapering discussion which may change the macro, or reaching the upper level resistance of a major trend line could scare smart money away from the equity market in the near term. Call it quad witching if you will.\n\n**QQQ ETF weighting/ER Date:** \n\n* AAPL - 13.39%/July 28 \n* MSFT - 10.76%/July 27 \n* AMZN - 10.66%/July 28 \n* FB - 4.26%/July 28 \n* TSLA - 3.45%/July 26 \n* GOOGL - 3.42%/July 27 \n* PYPL - 1.99%/July 28\n\nThe stars have aligned for a (bigly) drop.\n\nPosition: QQQ 361p 08/06",

        "selftext": "Posting here to offer a little perspective on what some apes saw as a quick hype play.\n\nIt was evident that PSFE had finally found bottom last week after months of daily short attacks.  For months, we saw all the tell-tale signs of market manipulators expertly shaking out retail shareholders with order flow, short volume, massive block trades and 13F\u2019s showing institutions steadily loading up.  In this context, just as PSFE was to be officially added to the Russell 1000 and 3000 indexes, it seemed a little suspicious that Paysafe was suddenly being hyped and trending on WallStreetBets.  I had to wonder if this was an engineered event to generate more liquidity since market makers were clearly running out of sellers right when they had to fill a lot more institutional orders.\n\nThat\u2019s all just monkey brain theory that ultimately doesn't matter because my plan is to hold PSFE long-term.  There is a clear strategy with this company that will take some time to come to fruition and I want to be in on the ground floor, before all the rosy ER\u2019s come in.  With a fintech that does roughly as much transactional volume as Square and, despite recent reports, has similar growth to PayPal, it\u2019s no surprise that institutions want to accumulate at levels so low that the stock is almost completely de-risked from a long-term perspective.\n\nThe comprehensive DD below is for the diamond handed apes who may have been caught in the recent hype. Know that you\u2019re not alone. We saw the same thing right after CNBC\u2019s Jim Cramer called Paysafe, \u201cthe ultimate stock for this moment\u201d and market analyst Steve Grasso repeated his calls for it go to \u201c$45/$50 and then settle in before moving higher from there.\u201d  After initial spikes, deep-pocketed short-sellers methodically crushed retail holders, eventually bringing the price down to where it was last week.\n\nBut informed short sellers knew they couldn't push too far because that price was really not far from the price paid by noted fund managers like Dan Loeb (Third Point 41.5 million shares), David Tepper (Appaloosa Management, 10 million shares), Aaron Cohen (Survetta Capital, 13 million shares), Dipanjan Deb (Francisco Partners, 20 million shares) and Leon Cooperman (personally owns 1.1 million shares).  A price probably lower than paid by Wells Fargo\u2019s several funds (12 million shares) and even by Blackstone when they raised their initial stake of 123 million shares to a total of 160 million shares.^(1)  Also, it\u2019s worth noting that, since they all decided to invest, Paysafe has created significant value including securing new revenue streams in the US iGaming market and expanded partnerships with Coinbase, ESL Gaming, Luckbox, and Microsoft among others. ^(2)\n\nWith a presence in 120 countries, Paysafe is an extremely diversified global payment processor: #1 global leader in iGaming, #2 global digital wallet, #4 globally in integrated merchant processing. Ever since private equity groups Blackstone and CVC took Paysafe private, they\u2019ve been going through a major restructuring to reduce risk, increase margins and profits. It's because they are still very much in the middle of that process that I like it so much as an investment opportunity. Here are a few key points:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* In 2017, private equity groups Blackstone and CVC raised their bid five times to ultimately to take Paysafe private for $3.9 billion.^(3)  Blackstone says their typical investment term is \u201cupwards of 7-10 years\u201d ^(4) which aligns with the investment time-frame implied by an inside source close to those negotiations who said, \u201cThere is a fundamental change in the way we pay for goods and services, away from the cash and cheques of our parents\u2019 age,\u201d adding that the private equity firms \u201chave a decade-long thesis that this shift will only grow and grow and they want to get in now.\u201d ^(5)\n* Under Blackstone/CVC\u2019s stewardship, Paysafe grew revenue 65% from $864 million to $1.418 billion (28% CAGR pre-Covid). Last year, due to Covid-related brick-and-mortar business and sporting event closures, along with their long-standing strategic decision to exit specific high-risk Asian revenue channels, 2020 revenue stagnated.  This is the reason they recently reported only 5% YoY quarterly growth.  In their Q1 ER, management noted that, without those channel exits they would have reported growth in the \u201cmid to high teens.\u201d  But even if you include 2020\u2019s stagnant growth, their overall revenue growth since 2017 was still 18% CAGR. This is roughly the same as PayPal\u2019s current projected growth. ^(6,7)\n* A few months ago, Paysafe was brought public through a reverse merger transaction with acclaimed deal maker Bill Foley, Chairman of Fidelity. The deal paid down $1.2 billion in debt and gave Blackstone/CVC about $5.6 billion in cash and shares.^(8)  The fact that Blackstone's recent 13F shows they bought back 37 million shares, combined with statements from them and Paysafe's board, indicates that they did this deal, not for a mere 44% gain on a four year investment, but because Bill Foley is an extraordinarily successful and well-connected deal maker who has a proven track record for generating exponential growth.\n* Inorganic growth through M&amp;A is a major pillar of Paysafe\u2019s strategy going forward.  Bill Foley, now Chairman of Paysafe and a major shareholder, is a proven M&amp;A synergy wizard, particularly in the financial services arena.  Foley took Fidelity National Financial from $3 million market cap to $10.8 billion. Yeah, that\u2019s and \u201cm\u201d and a \u201cb\u201d.  Over just the last five years, Foley grew Ceridian 3.3X ($4.2B to $14B), Dun &amp; Bradstreet 5.6X ($2B to $11.3B), and Black Knight 8.7X ($1.6B to $14B).  Through his proven M&amp;A playbook, Foley also grew FIS from $2.5 billion to over $91 billion market cap. That\u2019s a 36x return.  He says  \u201cThose characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.\u201d ^(6,9)\n\n**Deleveraging, increasing margins and profit**\n\n* Paysafe recently confirmed they are on track to meet 2021 projections of $1.53 billion in revenue, $930-$970 million in gross profit, double-digit growth and expanding 30-35% EBITDA margins, and $103 billion in transactional volume.  Paysafe\u2019s already strong $362 million in 2020 free cash flow was reported to be on track for 29% growth in 2021.  Notably, their multi-year projections don\u2019t include growth from their \"active M&amp;A pipeline\" and their ongoing US iGaming expansion (projected at 55% CAGR).\n* Q1's earnings disappointed some because, as part of their restructuring, they had $90 million in one-time non-recurring expenses associated with the merger and paying down $1.2 billion in debt. The company noted: \u201cResults included interest expense of $58.5 million, an increase of 53% compared to the prior year, reflecting the expense of capitalized debt fees as a result of debt repayment on March 31, 2021. Net loss also included share-based compensation of $72.4 million, compared to none in the prior year due to shares vested on completion of the Transaction.\"\n* Take away the $90 million in one-time expenses and, rather than reporting a $49 million loss, the company would have reported $41 million in quarterly net profit, thereby beating all analyst estimates. All signs indicate they are on track to beat estimates going forward, although I have noticed a few platforms raising those estimates recently.\n* In addition to paying down $1.2 billion in debt, an improved Moody\u2019s credit rating has enabled the company to refinance roughly a billion at a 1.25% lower interest rate, with an option to reduce it another 25bp.^(10)  Foley says: \u201cOne of the keys to this transaction and value creation for our shareholders is the reduction of Paysafe\u2019s leverage ratio to 3.6x Debt/EBITDA.\u201d  Notably, this Debt/EBITDA ratio is far better than the majority of their fintech peers, and the resulting improved margins stand to make it better still.\n* The combined effect of overall recent debt management will be a savings of around $92 million annually.  This secures higher margins, increased cash for M&amp;A and higher profits which, in my view, will lead to raised price targets and positive price action catalysts.\n* As part of their restructuring to cut down on operating expenses and further increase margins, Paysafe has recently forged agreements with Snowflake and AWS as they move to cloud-based integration for easier migration between their platforms, easier cross-border payments and planned expansion into global banking as a service, having identified a $58 trillion TAM.\n\n**Highly competitve**\n\n* Unlike other payment processors, Paysafecard enables those without basic ID metrics, credit cards, or even bank accounts (the 1.7 billion \u201cunbanked\u201d globally) to engage in eCommerce in over 50 countries. This segment grew 63% YoY.  Just today, Microsoft introduced Payesafecard to its Xbox platform in 22 countries.\n* In various segments, Paysafe has recently expanded their partnerships with FOX bet, Roblox, Fortnight, Coinbase, Amazon, Twitch, Microsoft/Xbox, bet365, ApplePay, Draftkings, Spotify, Youtube, Visa, Betfair, PayLease, ESL Gaming, Luckbox, Amelco, BetMGM, Ceasar\u2019s, and Pointsbet among many others.\n* \\#4 globally in integrated merchant processing, Paysafe\u2019s proprietary scalable electronic payment platform was voted \u201cBest Omni-Channel Payment Solution\u201d, \u201cPayment Processor of the Year,\u201d and \u201cBest Payment Method.\u201d\n* They are #2 globally in the digital wallet space with a presence in 120 countries. They own Neteller and Skrill, which was voted \u201cBest Digital Wallet\u201d for \u201cbest consumer take up\u201d, \u201cmost innovative technology\u201d with \u201cgreatest potential to disrupt current ecosystems.\u201d\n* People are usually more likely to leave reviews when a payment platform doesn\u2019t meet their expectations. That said, Trustpilot rates Paysafecard as \u201cExcellent\u201d (4.7/5 stars-31,981 reviews), Paysafe\u2019s digital wallet Skrill as \u201cgreat\u201d (4.1/5 stars-18,037 reviews) and Skrill Money Transfer as Excellent (4.8/5 stars - 8,349 reviews). ^(11)\n   * By contrast, Truspilot rates Stripe as \u201cAverage 3.4/5 stars- 6,208 reviews), Venmo as \u201cbad\u201d (1.2/5 starts - 222 reveiews), Zelle as \u201cbad\u201d (1.2/5 stars - 326 reviews) and PayPal as \"bad\" (1.2/5 stars-18,555 reviews). ^(12)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1axvo1n3sl871.png?width=475&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ca4bb0678156d9737029ff6a3075728bd54e8940\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**\u201cAt Paysafe, the iGaming market volume was estimated to be $3.4 billion in 2019, and is now projected to reach $47 billion in 2025.\u201d**\n\n**\u201cIt\u2019s our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate.\"** \\- Bill Foley\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Paysafe is the #1 global leader in iGaming payment processing, a space that is extremely difficult to enter, due to managing risk and a very complex regulatory landscape. Paysafe\u2019s advantage here is a large aspect of its MOAT, as discussed below.  Paysafe is often an integrated back-end payment processor so most don\u2019t realize they are using it but they are already integrated with 75% of all US iGaming operators. Paysafe is actively laying the groundwork for their US expansion in the wake of a US Supreme Court decision allowing state-legalized sports betting.\n* Bill Foley says, \"It\u2019s going to be a land grab. We want to be out there about 10 miles ahead of everybody else\u2026we\u2019re seeding the future growth right now by state and by operator... The day a state opens up, we are there ready from a regulatory perspective, from a risk perspective, and from a product perspective... I have a vision that we should be THE digital wallet and have tie-ins with every major casino company that\u2019s headquartered or located in Las Vegas. There will be money to be made for everybody... We\u2019ve got a wide landscape we can attack. It\u2019s pretty exciting\u201d\n* In his letter to investors, fund manager Dan Loeb said, \u201cWe believe the US is poised to become the largest online gambling market globally as it begins to deregulate state by state and Paysafe is exceptionally positioned to capitalize as the global market leader.\u201d\n* Compass Point analyst Michael Del Grosso, who initiated coverage with a $19 price target, noted, \u201cPSFE operates in high-growth verticals, has a unique advantage in its consumer and merchant facing solutions, and offers exposure to a secular growth opportunity in the potential legalization of iGaming in the United States,\u201d adding, \u201cwe believe there is upside to our forecasts in the event of state-level legalization of iGaming.\u201d ^(13)\n   * Recent headlines since Del Grasso wrote that:\n      * \"New York State Legalizes Online Sports Wagering\"\n      * \"Maryland Online Sports Betting Bill Passes Legislature\"\n      * \u201cNew Hampshire sports betting deal approved overwhelmingly; Hogan likely to sign\"\n      * \"Arizona governor signs bill legalizing sports betting\"\n      * \"Wyoming Legalizes Sports Betting\"\n      * \u201dDelaware igaming revenue up 74.3% year-on-year in March\"\n      * \"Pennsylvania gambling revenue rockets 162.7% in March - The biggest increase was recorded for sports wagering, where revenue rocketed by 326.1%\"\n      * \u201cCaesars Entertainment (Paysafe partner) announced Official Sports Betting Partner of NFL\"\n      * \u201cMichigan\u2019s online sports betting launch hailed a success, Ohio could follow this year\u201d\n      * \u201cOhio legislators doubling down on legalized sports gambling\u201d\n      * \u201cLouisiana Begins The Process of Legalized Sports Betting\u201d\n      * \u201cPath to legalized Texas sports betting becomes more clear\u201d\n      * \u201cNC lawmakers make push to legalize sports gambling to generate funding for schools\u201d\n      * \u201cFlorida poised to offer sports betting under major gambling deal\u201d\n      * \u201cLegal Sports Betting Could Get To California Sooner Than You Think\u201d\n      * \u201cCanada legalizes single-game sports betting\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Every analyst covering Paysafe rates it as a \"Buy\". A few quotes :\n   * RBC Capital 5-star analyst Daniel Perlin: \u201cWe believe PSFE offers a unique combination of digital wallet capabilities, accelerated cash conversion for consumers who would otherwise be out of the ecommrece loop, and integrated payments, all focused on specialized &amp; complex end-markets, which creates a competitive moat and pricing power.\u201d \u201crecent underperformance is largely due to the complex nature of PSFE\u2019s business and the FTAC II transaction\u201d and adds his view that Paysafe offers one of the best combinations of services in online payment space: \u201cPSFE has created a unique two-sided network enabling merchants to accept online &amp; in-store payments (in specific niche verticals), while also offering consumers a digital wallet &amp; eCash solution, which converts cash-heavy users to digital users. We believe it\u2019s this combination that enables PSFE to generate superior take rate economics vs. peers.\u201d ^(14)\n   * BMO Capital, 5-star analyst, James Fotheringham: \u201cPSFE is a global leader in iGaming (online betting related to sports, poker, and other casino games, as well as lotteries and bingo). Indeed, 36% of PSFE\u2019s revenues are from global iGaming. That is far more than for any of its peers.\u201d iGaming deposit volumes in the U.S. will grow \u201cat more than five times the rate of growth elsewhere in the world\u201d with a \"5-year CAGR (compound annual growth rate) of between 40% to 55%.\" ^(15)\n   * Evercore ISI analyst David Togut 'praised Paysafe for its \u201crobust risk management operation,\u201d and its high rankings in several key performance indictors globally, including cash network, stored digital wallet value, and amount of partnered independent merchants.' ^(16)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**MOAT:**  **\u201crobust risk management operation\u201d**\n\nSo why does Paysafe dominate iGaming and why how is it able offer eCommerce services to the 1.7 billion globally who can't even manage to have bank accounts or credit cards?\n\nTheir industry leading multi-jurisdictional regulatory expertise offers a durable advantage in spaces where competing fintechs are hesitant or unwilling to enter. CEO Philip McHugh from transcript : \u201cWhen we talk about a deep and a wide MOAT, this is absolutely one of the areas that we see that benefit where it\u2019s hard to copy.\u2026We have over 300 professionals dedicated to risk, compliance, and analytics. That is very, very rare in the payments space. It\u2019s a real strength of ours. We\u2019ve been able to track some of the top people in the industry, including the former CRO from PayPal, and we\u2019ve upgraded the team, we\u2019ve built some real data capabilities, and we see this continuing to be an area of differentiation for Paysafe versus others.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can de-risk some transactions where the market has abandoned many of these players\u2026we bring millions of consumers into the ecosystem. We bring unique ways to pay and access funds that a typical card processor certainly can\u2019t do. When you have that two-sided network, you change the conversation. When we speak to some of our largest iGaming customers, we\u2019re not only talking about take rates and comps, we\u2019re talking about revenue-generation, we\u2019re talking about attracting the types of customers that they want and they need in their ecosystem. That\u2019s a really, really powerful position to have.\u201d ^(9)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Valuation:**\n\nA while back I looked at a basket of fintech peers including PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, BILL, GPN, and Paysign.\n\n* Paysafe reports 30%+ EBITDA margin,  mid to high teen EBITDA growth, and $362 million in free cash flow (now on track to increase 29%),\n* By comparison, a third of the peer group reported negative EBITDA, half reported negative EBITDA growth, and a third negative free cash flow.\n* Paysafe also has better EPS than over half the group and better Debt/EBITDA ratio than 3/4 of them.\n* The group's collective growth rate of \\~12.5% is in the range of Paysafe's 10-13% projections but the company's estimates may be intentionally conservative as they do not take into account their current expansion into US iGaming nor do they factor in their \"active M&amp;A pipeline.\"  Foley is apparently known for under-promising and over-performing.\n* As noted above, Paysafe was growing 28% CAGR pre-Covid, but taking into account last years slow down due to Covid-related business closures and strategic channel exits, it grew at 18% CAGR, a rate on par with PayPal's projected growth.\n\nGiven all the above factors, it seems fair to look at Paysafe's potential price based on an average of peer multiples:\n\nPaysafe\u2019s share price with average of sector peer multiples:\n\n* EV/EBITDA ratio : $122.09\n* EV/Rev ratio : $83.91\n* EV/FCF ratio : $87.86\n\nAverage: $97.95\n\nMore realistic price after removing all outliers in each category which put PSFE share price over $100\n\n* EV/EBITDA ratio : **$50.75**\n* EV/Rev ratio : **$44.64**\n* EV/FCF ratio : **$44.18**\n\n**Average : $46.52**\n\nIn a nutshell, the basket of sector peers has an average growth within Paysafe\u2019s conservative projections yet they trade at 350-750% higher multiples. With Paysafe having better financials than most, it is hard to argue that this is proportionate. Either the entire field has to come down or Paysafe has to go up.  While I don't necessarily agree with his time frame, market analyst Steve Grasso's call for \"$45/55\" may actually be quite reasonable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Sources:**\n\n(1) see fintel or other source for institutional ownership.

Either 150x more volume is traded per user, or the bid/ask spreads from payment for routing exceeds 150x current.\n\n4) A combination of the above. 50x user growth and 3x profit margin growth. \n\n5) Assume that operating costs are fairly negligible and linear due to SaaS being economies of scale based.\n\nBear Case: \n\n1) Robinhood is a \"Trading software that's thinly veiled as a technology company\" and should be given the P/E of a tech company that can scale exponentially. \n\n2) Robinhood faces regulatory risk expanding outside of USA and even if every man woman and child deposits what the average APE has on the platform right now and trades at the frequency of an average RH APE- We would reach a P/E of 217.\n\n3) If Robin hood abolishes the methods of: \"Payment for order flow and uses monthly fees/data charges\" it will lose a large part of the entirety of its' branding. It would be like if Apple abolished the iPhone. Free Trading is their Model. \n\n4) As Order Flow is a linear business, 1 unit of order flow results in $1 extra. In order to reach 150x multiplier to reduce PE to 'reasonable tech company levels' we would be looking at 150x the net volume being transacted on Robinhood. \n\n5) Robinhood \n\nExcerpts from S-1 Filing: \n\nWe incurred operating losses each year since our inception in 2013 through 2019, including net losses of $6.1\u00a0million, $57.5\u00a0million, and $106.6\u00a0million for fiscal 2017, 2018, and 2019, respectively. We expect our operating expenses to continue to increase in the future as we increase our sales and marketing efforts, continue to invest in research and development, further develop our products and services, improve and expand our customer support functions and expand into new geographies. \n\nMoreover, as of March 31, 2021, options to purchase 18,096,127 shares of our Class A common stock with a weighted-average exercise price of approximately $2.23 per share were outstanding and 81,820,160 shares of our Class A common stock were subject to outstanding RSUs (including 27,663,658 shares subject to 2019 Market-Based RSUs). \n\nThere are currently &gt; 96 million shares held by employees.   \n\n\nFunding Rounds:\n\nYear   Amount    Valuation    Baggers at IPO dump\\_price \n\n2017   $110m      $1,3b           24x\n\n2018    $363m      $5.6b          5.7x\n\n2019    $323m      $7.6b          4.2\n\n2020    $280m      $8.3b          3.8x\n\n2020   $320m        $8.6b         3.7x\n\n2020   $200m        $11.2b      2.8x\n\n2020   $460m       $11.7b        2.7x\n\nBull Case 1: \n\nRobin Hood has been growing at a very fast rate therefore its' valuations validate this. The insider investors are incentivized to hold. \n\nBear Case 1: \n\nThe insiders made anywhere between a minimum of 2.7 --&gt; 24x already within the last few years, private firms typically take profits and reinvest in other startups. (Unless Robinhood grows at exponential rates going forwards)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSelling Pressures: \n\nImagine if you're an Ape working at RH and you can cash in on a 10-20 bagger immediately in 30-days, would you sell? \n\nAn average engineer who worked at Robinhood for 4 - years on average holds \\~ $400k-800k in RSUs (at a price of $2 per share). At the time of IPO we're looking at $4-8m if you sell. Maybe you hold, maybe not in. \n\nIf you're an investor who invested in Series G-1 , G-2 (the lastest bagholders). You've got yourself a 1-2 bagger already in 1 year.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPersonal Opinion:\n\nRobin hood is being evaluated as a \"Growing Tech company\" at multipliers that seem unreasonable. \n\nRobinhood does not have a roadmap that provides a way to reach earnings through their current model which is Payment for Orderflow.  \n\nEven with the introduction of their \\[censored\\]currency, Coinbase ambitiously is boasting a forward P/E of 30x. \n\nEven as a growing Fintech like Square is at a P/E at 201x, and mature Fintech such as Paypal is at 30x.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPositions: Short 500 shares of RH\n\nThis is not financial advice, tons of companies fuck over their customers at some point. GME/AMC - JAN madness aside, I'm short this on a pure autist basis. \ud83d\udc3b\n\nSources:\n\nCompetitors:\n\n[https://www.businessofapps.com/data/robinhood-statistics/](https://www.businessofapps.com/data/robinhood-statistics/)\n\n[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1783879/000162828021013318/robinhoods-1.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1783879/000162828021013318/robinhoods-1.htm)\n\nDetails of Lock-up and insider Holdings\n\n[https://www.jioforme.com/robin-hood-sets-ipo-prices-at-the-lower-end-of-the-range-and-rates-trading-apps-at-26-7-billion/633014/](https://www.jioforme.com/robin-hood-sets-ipo-prices-at-the-lower-end-of-the-range-and-rates-trading-apps-at-26-7-billion/633014/)\n\n[https://craft.co/robinhood/funding-rounds](https://craft.co/robinhood/funding-rounds)  \nEmployee Sources, cross-referenced with Blind, and the TC seems pretty in line.\n\n[https://www.levels.fyi/company/Robinhood/salaries/Software-Engineer/](https://www.levels.fyi/company/Robinhood/salaries/Software-Engineer/)\n\n[https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/robinhood/company\\_financials](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/robinhood/company_financials)",

All indices are way off its lows from 52 weeks ago (even more so from the bottom of the 2020 cash). Clearly the indices are doing ok. But what about the stocks in the S&amp;P500?\n\nIn this next chart, here's the value companies in the S&amp;P500 have made since 52 weeks ago (again, the gains should be much more than this since the 2020 lows).\n\n**Marketcap valuation gained during the last 52 weeks**\n\n||Top 5|Top 10|Top 20|Top 50|Top 100|Top 250|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|$|$4.96T|$6.49T|$7.93T|$10.76T|$14.15T|$18.03T|\n|%|23.69%|31.02%|37.87%|51.42%|67.62%|86.14%|\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n||Bottom 250|Bottom 100|Bottom 50|Bottom 20|Bottom 10|Bottom 5|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|$|$2.9T|$780.77B|$340.88B|$92.3B|$38.79B|$13.11B|\n|%|13.86%|3.73%|1.63%|0.44%|0.19%|0.06%|\n\nThe total value gained in the S&amp;P500 index since one year ago is $20.93 trillion! The top 5 companies contributed to about 24% of those gains and the top 250 companies contributed to basically all of it (\\~86%).\n\nAs of right now, the S&amp;P500 index is now valued at $39.38 trillion, so the S&amp;P500 index has doubled in value since a year ago which is absolutely insane. Let's look at the valuations of these companies.\n\n**Valuations of companies right now**\n\n||Top 5|Top 10|Top 20|Top 50|Top 100|Top 250|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|$|$9.08T|$12.26T|$15.67T|$21.89T|$27.68T|$34.86T|\n|%|23.05%|31.13%|39.8%|55.59%|70.29%|88.51%|\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n||Bottom 250|Bottom 100|Bottom 50|Bottom 20|Bottom 10|Bottom 5|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|$|$4.52T|$1.18T|$478.81B|$159.71B|$73.03B|$23.64B|\n|%|11.49%|3%|1.22%|0.41%|0.19%|0.06%|\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Top and Bottom Companies off their highs and lows**\n\n||Top 5|Top 10|Top 20|Top 50|Top 100|Top 250|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|off the highs|\\-2.56%|\\-12.340%|\\-9.13%|\\-6.86%|\\-6.79%|\\-7.42%|\n|off the lows|54.50%|54.221%|48.67%|47.09%|53.02%|54.03%|\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n||Bottom 250|Bottom 100|Bottom 50|Bottom 20|Bottom 10|Bottom 5|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|off the highs|\\-11.53%|\\-13.56%|\\-14.55%|\\-16.05%|\\-20.23%|\\-19.23%|\n|off the lows|65.00%|67.48%|75.81%|67.54%|61.85%|56.65%\u200b|\n\nTop 10 includes Tesla, which is about 25% off its highs that's why you see the top 10 is -12% off its highs. Besides that, one could say the top 5 companies are carrying the index. The top 250 aren't doing so bad either. After that, the bottom 250 gets a bit ugly. The smaller caps did gain more overall up until their highs before they retreated.\n\nNow let's look at how much carrying the top companies are doing.\n\n**Companies in the S&amp;P500 for every 1-3% move**\n\n|||1%||2%||3%||\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n||% of the S&amp;P500|$|%|$|%|$|%|\n|AAPL|6.16%|$24.26B|0.062%|$48.53B|0.12%|$72.79B|0.18%|\n|MSFT|5.38%|$21.19B|0.054%|$42.39B|0.11%|$63.58B|0.16%|\n|AMZN|4.59%|$18.08B|0.046%|$36.16B|0.09%|$54.24B|0.14%|\n|GOOG|4.42%|$17.42B|0.044%|$34.83B|0.09%|$52.25B|0.13%|\n|FB|2.49%|$9.82B|0.025%|$19.63B|0.05%|$29.45B|0.07%|\n|BRK.B|1.62%|$6.39B|0.016%|$12.77B|0.03%|$19.16B|0.05%|\n|TSLA|1.60%|$6.31B|0.016%|$12.63B|0.03%|$18.94B|0.05%|\n|V|1.32%|$5.20B|0.013%|$10.39B|0.03%|$15.59B|0.04%|\n|NVDA|1.23%|$4.84B|0.012%|$9.67B|0.02%|$14.51B|0.04%|\n|JPM|1.18%|$4.63B|0.012%|$9.25B|0.02%|$13.88B|0.04%|\n|JNJ|1.13%|$4.46B|0.011%|$8.93B|0.02%|$13.39B|0.03%|\n|WMT|1.00%|$3.96B|0.010%|$7.91B|0.02%|$11.87B|0.03%|\n|UNH|0.99%|$3.91B|0.010%|$7.83B|0.02%|$11.74B|0.03%|\n|MA|0.96%|$3.77B|0.010%|$7.53B|0.02%|$11.30B|0.03%|\n|PYPL|0.90%|$3.54B|0.009%|$7.09B|0.02%|$10.63B|0.03%|\n|HD|0.88%|$3.47B|0.009%|$6.94B|0.02%|$10.41B|0.03%|\n|PG|0.87%|$3.41B|0.009%|$6.82B|0.02%|$10.22B|0.03%|\n|BAC|0.84%|$3.30B|0.008%|$6.59B|0.02%|$9.89B|0.03%|\n|DIS|0.82%|$3.21B|0.008%|$6.43B|0.02%|$9.64B|0.02%|\n|ADBE|0.74%|$2.92B|0.007%|$5.83B|0.01%|$8.75B|0.02%\u200b|\n\nEvery 1% move Apple makes as of now, \\~$24 is moved and the S&amp;P500 index moved \\~0.06%. A 3% move would impact $72 billion dollars in valuation and has a 0.18% impact on the index. Doesn't seem much but the index is valued at almost $40 trillion dollars.

Almost 90% from the top 250 companies.\n* S&amp;P500 adds and removes companies all the time. If a company is performing poorly and finds a company that is doing well over the past few quarters, it will consider swapping them.\n* Valuations in these companies don't reflect what's going on the economy. All indices are near record highs yet there's a lot going on in the economy (unemployment, inflation, real estate, etc.) that at any moment could create FUD.\n* Stock picking isn't easy. It's a lot more difficult to find the losers than to pick the winners. Make sure you have a strategy. Reddit is known for choosing small caps. If you're going to invest in small caps, don't let emotion get to you. They usually see wild swings 10-20% days up and down.\n* Hopefully some insight what the overall market looks like. Large caps are carrying the market, we're at all-time highs, and earnings are coming up. Expect some profit taking next week and the weeks after during earnings season.\n\nHope ya'll find this useful. Good luck to all.",

The person is informed that there are two \u2018black box\u2019 investment opportunities, A and B.\n\nHere's what we have in **box A**\n\n* people who have had some degree of success in business broadly speaking; some former executives and others are financiers or investors. They have performed well enough to stay in the business \u2014 but are certainly not hall of famers (or not when it comes to investing at least)\n* after making a deal, they will join the company and possibly add some value\n* invest very little or none of their own capital and get paid 20% of the money you put in just to get a deal done regardless of how much you the investor make\n* always offer rights (warrants) to other investors who get special access, which decreases the intrinsic value of your investment by 5% (in a typical case)\n* choosing from a pool of companies that would *not* attract enough interest from professional investors to go public the conventional way and are *not* backed by highly accomplished investors (Nikola, UpHealth, Romeo, CuriosityStream, Lordstown)\n\nHere's what we have in **box B**\n\n* some of the most well-respected investors on the planted with track records that include investing in or founding some of the largest companies in existence (Facebook, AirBnB, PayPal, Stripe, Square, etc.) \n* these fist-rate sponsors will be a serious value add once they join the board \n* invest a significant amount of their own capital and / or get compensated to the extent that you the investor make money on the investment\n* sometimes offer rights (warrants) to other investors who get special access, which decreases the intrinsic value of your investment by 2.5% or lower and sometimes do not offer any such rights\n* as a result of these aforementioned factors, they will be choosing from a pool of companies of which *would* attract enough interest from professional investors to go public the conventional way and are backed by accomplished investors (e.g. NextDoor, Grab, Aurora, OpenDoor, Payoneer, Traveloka, SoFi, SmartRent)\n\nWell, imagine if I were to inform the alien that **box A** was *far* more popular than **box B**. So much so that people were willing to pay \\~20-30% more on average for box A. The alien would be utterly dumbfounded and ask ***why***?!\n\nThe short answer: *human psychology.*\n\nThe long answer / story (from my perspective)...\n\n# The Beginning of the New Era of SPACs (spring - summer 2020)\n\n*\\**  A*gain plenty of you already know all of this and I'm sure some of you know much more than myself. But I've noticed some newcomers on this sub lately (welcome and I hope things turn around sooner than later for your sake especially!). So I figured some background would be helpful.*\n\nWhen I discovered SPACs, I was surprised by the level of enthusiasm and appetite for what appeared to me like mediocre (if not outright sketchy) companies. True, pre-2020 SPACs were typically vehicles for unexciting, junky companies in industries like offshore drilling and mining. So EV and space companies seemed like a step in the right direction. But from what I could tell, these  companies were clearly **not** the stuff of appealing growth / tech IPOs \u2014 yet they were trading as if they were. (The exception, of course, being DraftKings, which was the type of company that could've IPOd conventionally.)\n\nMany lacked real revenue; and virtually none had prodigious or even exceptional founders / leadership or top-tier VC investors, like Sequoia, Kleiner Perkins, Greylock, Khosla, etc. These funds have consistently achieved outsized returns investors by investing in tech for decades. Indeed, Sequoia is widely considered by many in the field of investing to be the most successful investor in all of modern history. That is not to say that top-tier VCs are infallible; Kleiner Perkins invested in Fisker before it went bankrupt. But it's certainly a signal that the some of the sharpest, most analytical minds in the investing field have done their diligence and believe the risk-reward for a given company is favorable. In other words, the odds are in your favor. \n\nThe epitome of such low-caliber companies was Nikola. I remember watching Trevor Milton on CNBC when VTIQ/NKLA was around $10.5 or so. I messaged my friend \"This guy is a joke; like a bad used car salesman\" and my friend replied \"Yeah, he's the next Lizzy Holmes.\" ... Flash forward a month, and VTIQ/NKLA had more than doubled to the $20s, which confounded me. Then I forgot all about it... until another month had passed and that same friend texted me \"Remember VTIQ? Now it's at $70\"\n\nI could not believe it: *a* *700% increase in two months* \u2014 *and with that joker at the helm!? What the hell happened / how is that possible?? Did they perfect alchemy or some shit???*\n\nHe explained that people thought it could be the next Tesla. This was laughable to me, as if what made Tesla so successful were the mere reality that it has been operating in the EV sector \u2013 not the brainpower and superhuman work ethic of Musk and his team.\n\nWhat followed in the subsequent several months seemed a bit unusual to me but not nearly as crazy as the NKLA phenomenon (nor as crazy as what would follow from 12/2020-02/2020). Several SPACs announced deals, many of which were EV related and some did pretty well. But none held above $20, other than HYLN. For example, the Gores deal with Luminar was a 'the crowd goes mild' occasion (I believe commons closed at $10.8 on the day of the DA, up from $10.4 the day before). Since DraftKings, Luminar was the first company to go through a SPAC that had the markings of a highly attractive growth investment: serious, heavyweight investors behind it and a prodigious founder and CEO. This was the kind of growth company I was looking for. However, it seemed at the time that the valuation was just too steep.\n\nLate in the summer, a few SPACs had rallied considerably, most notably HYLN, RIDE, and VLDR. I thought that these rallies were seriously overdone and that nearly all the companies to SPAC at that point were pretty underwhelming. HYLN was, in my mind, the one possible exception but I felt I didn't understand the science / tech nearly well enough to have any substantial grasp of the company's promise.\n\n# The Middle (fall 2020)\n\nThen came the first serious SPAC market downturn. Nearly 3 months of continual decline among SPACs... QS (then KCAC) gradually drifted from $24 to \\~$11; Luminar fell to $10; SBE hovered around $11 for weeks; MP dropped to around $11; DMYD announced the SportsGenuis deal and reached $10.4 on the DA (and remained below $11 for weeks)... I got crushed during this time and almost gave up on SPACs altogether.\n\nIt\u2019s still not clear what caused this. The NKLA scandal came to light around that time, which couldn\u2019t have helped. Also, HYLN was bid up to $55+ on the expectation that it would perform like NKLA post merger and shoot up another $20 or so \u2013 and instead gradually bled for weeks. And the market as a whole had some election related tremors; but those weren\u2019t all that severe. The basic cause seems to have been that people got greedy bought at high prices without understanding what they were buying (this is also when SPAC options started to become popular).\n\nIn November, I assumed that the days of SPACs targeting pre-revenue companies and skyrocketing were over \u2014 and that if there was money to be made in SPACs in the future, it\u2019d be in companies with substantial revenue and more predictable, steady businesses.\n\nThe time wasn't all bad for SPACs, though.\n\nAs much as it pains me, I've gotta throw Chamath a bone here. He pulled off a good deal with one of the best growth companies to go through a SPAC, OpenDoor, during this period. (Though he also made an atrocious deal with Clover shortly thereafter.) And around this time, many of the most promising sponsors to ever start SPACs come into the picture at this time. This list includes Peter Thiel, [Hemant Taneja](https://www.generalcatalyst.com/team/hemant-taneja/), Peter Thiel, Reid Hoffman,[ Alexander Tamas](https://neckar.substack.com/p/alexander-tamas-the-vc-youve-never), and Mickey Malka.\n\n# The Middle - part 2 (winter 2021)\n\nBy this time, the number of new SPACs hitting the market was unprecedented. The number of **SPAC IPOs in the first 3 months of 2021 surpassed the total for 2020**, which itself was a record-shattering year.\n\nMost reading this already know what happened in this timeframe. But for those who don't, **full-blown mania ensued**. QS hit $130 after de-SPACing, fueled by a frenzy of options buying and what appeared to be a sizable [gamma squeeze](https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/gamma-squeeze-193213870.html). Arrival also announced a SPAC deal, which went to $20 quickly, as it was by far the most legitimate EV company to SPAC thus far. In the wake of this, every and any EV SPAC went to $20+. Even the ones that had announced EV deals in the fall that stuck at trust and had no interest at the time were, all of the sudden, hot shit and no price was too high for them.\n\nIn the two months that followed, any deal with a remotely futuristic, sext techy company shot up considerably on a DA or even a rumor...\n\n* Good sponsor + a good company DA on Monday = $20/share+ by Friday\n* Good sponsor + decent company = low to high teens within days\n* Decent sponsor + decent company = low to mid teens\n* Cathie Wood bought it = straight to $20.\n\nBy late January, finding pre-DA commons from mediocre sponsors below $10.5 or warrants below $1.75 wasn't easy. For decent sponsors, you were looking at $11+ for pre-DA commons and $2.2+ for warrants. I remember someone talking about warrants \"going on sale\" for $2.20 for a green tech focused SPAC \u2014 from a sponsor whose previous SPAC deal resulted in a bankrupt company. You can't make this shit up.\n\nRisk-taking reached an all-time high. People were buying warrants at incredibly inflated prices and loads of options for pre-DA SPACs that did not even have a rumor. The SPAC that perhaps best exemplified this was **IPOD,** which **hit $18** within a few months of IPOing and ***without even so much as a rumor of a rumor.***\n\nI may be exaggerating the craziness somewhat but not all that much. It truly was madness.\n\n...................................................................................................................................................................................\n\n**Amidst all this, my thinking was as follows:**\n\nThe SPAC market was way frothy. But so was the broader market; and SPACs at least have a price floor. Also, SPACs from mediocre to good sponsors were trading well after de-SPACing and, in many cases, getting high PTs from credible analysts that validated their rallies. (I don't give very much credence to equity analysts but it was a good sign nevertheless.) Moreover, the caliber of sponsors in SPACs has increased by an order of magnitude. Most great companies would genuinely value the input of Peter Thiel, for example. So these first-rate, legendary VC sponsors are not simply offering money and less dilution: their joining the board after the merger and guiding the company will add significant value.\n\nMoreover, I reasoned, better investors with SPACs that add value as board members, minimize dilution and conflicts of interest should also attract better companies... Hey, m*aybe a highly sought-after and seriously impactful unicorn like Impossible Foods or Reddit would go through a SPAC! That could be an even bigger game changer for an already game that's already changed so much in a year's time.*\n\nAnd these new players were not only changing the game by virtue of their name/clout. More and more sponsors were setting up their SPACs such that their payout was tied to contingent on making a deal that resulted in decent returns for investors \u2014 not merely making a deal.\n\nLet's use LEAP as an example of a such a first-tier SPAC, since I have only a *very* small position currently and I posted this elsewhere in response to a question...\n\nMickey Malka is up there with the *cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me* of today's early-stage VCs, at least when it comes to fintech. Chamath (who I find deplorable for the record) said he was in one of Ribbit's funds and his IRR was several hundred percentage points. That's in the top .001% even for VC funds.\n\nThis is a serious, top-tier investor who's proven himself playing against the big boys and has a reputation to uphold... not merely a tall midget in the SPAC circus, like Chamath, [who failed as a VC](https://www.axios.com/social-capital-collapse-0c3257ab-b599-4047-b5cc-5d465419b373.html), and so many other sponsors who are, or at least were, idolized on [r/SPACs](https://www.reddit.com/r/SPACs/). (Not saying all serial SPAC sponsors are less worthy of our money than all top VCs; Fortress, for one, is excellent and MP was one of the best SPAC deals of all time, but I digress...)\n\nHe also set up his promote structure so that it's much more aligned with us investors:\n\n* They take half of the normal promote (10% of the IPO float) for simply completing a deal.\n* But then they can earn up to an additional 20% promote (for 30% total), which vest in four equal tranches upon achieving outsized share performance, at $20.00, $30.00, $40.00, and $50.00 per share\n\nAnd there are other SPACs with even more investor friendly and less dilutive structures, like [HAAC](https://www.reddit.com/r/HAAC/comments/lz9xiu/haacs_sail_structure_is_more_important_than_ever/) and CBAH's SAIL structure.\n\n**In short**: There being significantly better players and significantly better incentives was reason enough to believe that the premium *certain* SPACs demanded was justifiable.\n\nThat's why I made a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SPACs/comments/m0t2vq/why_im_more_optimistic_than_ever_about_spacs/) amidst the first wave of the 2021 SPACpocalypse expressing my optimism. When it comes to my expectation of a quick SPAC market recovery, **I was dead wrong**. But my fundamental reasons for optimism remain intact thus far.\n\n# Where are we now?\n\nI assume just about everyone is familiar with the SPAC market of the last few months. But here's a concise recap for those who aren't:\n\n&gt;After approaching GM's market cap, CCIV tumbled 50% on the day of the DA. This was the first sign of trouble. In the weeks that followed, interest rates climbed day after day and eventually approached 2% \u2014 and the market mentality shifted from 'risk-on and growth at any price' to 'risk-off and flee growth at any price.' There was a broad market sell off in high-growth stocks, especially in the frothiest areas: EVs and green tech like TSLA and futuristic tech / ARKK. And SPACs, running hotter than ever, were ripe for a massive correction, which set in dramatically. Then Archegos collapsed and as a result, prime brokers tightened their lending requirements to institutional investors. Given that many funds were 3-8x leveraged on SPAC units (bought at the $10 IPO price typically), there was immense selling pressure from many of the largest holders of SPACs. They needed to sell at any price. If you look back at the daily trade volume, you'll find some massive block sales in SPACs like those in VIAC and DISCA. Some of the very highest quality SPACs, like VYGG and TCVA, were able to find block buyers for millions of shares in a day at $9.9-10. But mediocre and crappy SPACs were not. And all DAs were seen as urgently needed liquidity opportunities for funds who were happy to sell at any price above trust and even willing to sell slightly below trust.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;To make matters even worse, many of the SPACs that retail traders were most excited about proved to have inept management and/or poorly thought out business models... RIDE turned out to be run by a Trevor-esque con-man; GOEV lost their key executive and scraped their previous business model; RMO slashed their revenue projections substantially. And short reports flowed in at record rates. (These are my recollections at least... I haven't followed these SPACs closely so let me know if I'm mistaken on any details.)\n\nCurrently, SPAC common shares are a shell of their former selves. Nearly all (irrespective of sponsor quality and/or DA quality) have bled to $10 or lower. And hardly any deal has managed to appreciate substantially. The only most successful DAs of the past few months that I can think of were FWAA and KVSB; and neither is currently above $11 at the moment. It's downright depressing.\n\nMore importantly, I truly feel for those came to the party late and who believed in a company and got burned. Some of these sponsors and founders should face serious penalties for misleading investors and making hasty, sloppy deals instead of taking their time and rigorously evaluating companies. \n\n# My current thinking\n\nLike most of you, I've been through the wringer since February. Moreover, the performance of recent de-SPACs has undeniably been concerning.\n\n* E.g. the company that I had the highest level of confidence in going into the merger was a SaaS trading at 14x 2022 EBITDA that had a sponsor with a strong background in SaaS investing and a solid PIPE. The company had been consistently beating its projections from the DA presentation. It received a $20+ PT and a $16 PT, both from a reputable firms. And yet it traded down to $8.5. And this wouldn't even be considered particularly poor post-merger performance in this environment.\n\nThe complaints and theories about how we ended up in this rut are numerous and not mutually exclusive. My overarching belief is that none of these issues are structural or necessary. Here are my thoughts on each specifically.\n\n***Overly high valuations***\n\nI think there is validity to this. However, there is nuance here that is usually overlooked.\n\nThe investor presentations for 90% of SPACs clearly demonstrate the **discount** you are getting at comparable public companies relative to EV/Revenue or EV/EBITDA. And this discount is usually in the range of 20-40%...\n\nHowever, many SPACs targeted hyper growth and / or pre-rev companies. Those companies fell out of favor in the broader market this past spring \u2014 and many have yet to recover. ARKK is a good proxy for such companies and the index remains \\~25% off its February high. The slump is even more notable for small-cap EV stocks. Plug power remains 60% below its ATH. So the problem for many recent de-SPACs is that **from the time of the DA to the merger date, the comps got crushed**. So even a SPAC that was valued at a 25% discount (based on EV/rev or EV/EBITDA) to similar public companies isn't worth $10 any longer if its comp fell 30-40%. It would now be worth $8-9. \n\nMoreover, **it's sometimes the case that these comps aren't appropriate**, like RIDE comping itself to TSLA for instance or SFTW/BlackSky using Palantir as a comp. The comps are, of course, far more established companies with world class talent.\n\nBut there are plenty of cases where the comps are completely appropriate. For example: [FWAA/SmartRent](https://s27.q4cdn.com/632832908/files/doc_presentations/Investor-Presentation.pdf) comping itself to [Alarm.com](https://alarm.com/), LTCH, and Matterport. Or [IACB/Innovid](https://info.innovid.com/hubfs/Investor-Resources/Innovid_Investor-Presentation_(06.22.21).pdf) comping itself to DoubleVerify. There is no reason to think that either of those companies are inferior to their comps. This is not only true with respect to their financials (revenue, growth, gross margins, market penetration, etc.) but the quality of the management is also very comparable. And yet you are getting in at a significant discount by buying at $10. For that reason, FWAA traded up to a high of $12.8 weeks after it's April DA during the SPAC crash \u2014 and did so *on institutional buying* (there was and still is virtually no retail interest.)\n\n***A glut of SPAC sponsors / shortage of desirable private companies***\n\nAs I said earlier:\n\n&gt;From what I could tell, these companies were clearly **not** the stuff of appealing growth / tech IPOs. Many lacked real revenue; and virtually none had prodigious or even exceptional founders / leadership or top-tier VC investors, like Sequoia, Kleiner Perkins, Greylock, Khosla, etc.\n\nSuch companies are far from being picked over by SPACs. In fact, very few have gone public through a SPAC.\n\nCB Insight has a [Complete List Of Unicorn Companies](https://www.cbinsights.com/research-unicorn-companies). Many of these are companies with top talent and premier investors that I'd like to invest in and that would have serious institutional interest as well. Based on companies included in that list from 2019-2021, **less than 4% have gone public through or struck a deal with a SPAC** and less than 10% have gone public through an IPO from what I can tell. And **as of 2021 there are 760 unicorns,** 14 of which have agreed to a SPAC deal (those 14 are included in the 4% figure above).\n\nSo have SPACs depleted the private EV company stock? Yeah, they likely have. But those pre-revenue,  companies with mediocre founders and backers were never all that enticing to me to start with. Again, I'm looking for a company that has substantial revenue, a first mover advantage and/or a serious moat, some of the most brilliant, capable people leading it, and backing / guidance from the very smartest investors around, like Impossible Foods (spoiler: this isn't the last you'll hear about Impossible).\n\nFor more on this subject, check out an earlier [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SPACs/comments/m6nosi/are_there_actually_too_many_spacs_chasing_too_few/https://www.reddit.com/r/SPACs/comments/m6nosi/are_there_actually_too_many_spacs_chasing_too_few/) of mine.\n\n***PIPE dumps***\n\nI have two simple (semi-rhetorical) questions. First, if PIPEs selling their shares is a necessarily a detriment to post-merger share price, then how is it that so many SPACs traded so well months after their mergers in 2020 and early 2021? Second, how is a PIPE dump different from the 'flipping' that goes on with the funds who get IPO allocation on conventional IPOs (which evidently doesn't kill the pop on conventional IPOs)?\n\n***Short sellers***\n\nI'm really not sure what the influence of short sellers has been on the price action of SPACs. However, if valuations were not too high and / or the companies were of high caliber, short selling SPACs (into de-SPAC especially) wouldn't make any sense. Indeed, it would be particularly reckless to short SPACs given that the share counts are relatively low, which makes them susceptible to short squeezes. So this is really just a function of the first problem.\n\n# The opportunity\n\nThese have been dark times, no doubt. Still, I feel a bit like that alien being presented with box B at a 20% discount to box A. In other words, in 2020 and early 2021 SPAC investors were presented with garbage (for the most part) and mistook it for gold; now we're being presented with gold and, as a result of that mistake, treating it like garbage.  \n\nIt's indisputable that never in SPAC history have there been more first-rate sponsors who are incentivized to make excellent deals for their investors. \n\nYes, the upside reward for SPAC investors has undeniably diminished recently and could very well remain below its peak forever. Warrants have shown signs of life in the past couple of months but common shares remain stuck around the lowest levels I've seen.\n\n***However,*** **so too has the downside risk**: you can now buy SPACs from the very best sponsors with the least dilutive, most investor friendly structures at or below trust value. And as a result, you can use leverage to significantly increase your upside without significantly increasing your risk. (This is the case on RH at least, where the margin rate is 2.5%.) The same is true with warrants, which are still cheap; although the risk (or at least volatility) is higher, of course, and warrants across the board have rebounded a bit. I wasn't comfortable buying pre-DA warrants from mediocre sponsors at $1.8-2.5 in January. But I'm very comfortable holding pre-DA warrants from very good to excellent sponsors in the $1.00-1.5 range or post-DA warrants from such sponsors with strong DAs in the $1.50-2 range.\n\nThe million dollar questions are: will exceptional unicorns choose to public via SPAC and will sponsors be able to get them to do so at attractive valuations?\n\nI'll end on a note of optimism: in April a [Reuters article](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-impossible-foods-m-a-exclusive/exclusive-impossible-foods-in-talks-to-list-on-the-stock-market-sources-idUSKBN2BV2SF) mentioned that Impossible Foods was considering a SPAC listing. That deal has yet to materialize. But if it does, best believe I'll be slapping the ask.",

Nice gain for SPRT on Friday, up almost 13% before giving back a little AH. Call options more than double puts in open interest. IV is so elevated that even deep out of the money calls are stupid expensive. I've seen a lot of people throwing out crazy numbers for stock valuations. Call option buying could be what's driving the price right now. For market makers, when they sell call options, they buy stock to hedge, remaining delta neutral via the Black-Scholes model. Or they could be long other call options. The caveat with this is with elevated volume on out-of-the-money call options, if the stock price stalls and there is no gamma pressure, market makers can unwind their hedges (sell the stock they bought to protect their ass from selling naked calls), putting further downward pressure on the share price. Premiums are crazy right now, so MMs are more than willing to sell these options. Things to keep in mind: IV crush and the potential that this merger may already be priced in. I closed my $4.5 calls for over 100% gains.\n\n\\- **EDU** \\- I expect this to be the next ~~stock~~ falling knife about posted with a bunch of \"but look at what it was valued at before!\" or \"available at a huge discount!\" Well, there's a reason. The CCP is probably going to make private tutoring companies non-profi7t. In the last 3 months, this stock has lost 80% of its value. It's not trading a discount, it's going down in flames. Let it find a bottom first.\n\n**- ATOS** \\- welcome back, old friend. The set up is starting to become eerily similar to last month. MM's making a TON of money selling options on this.\n\n\\- **GOTU** \\- see: EDU above.\n\n\\- **BBIG** \\- hype, run up, completes acquisition aaaaaand price tumbles. Not a ton, but a bit. Keep this in mind SPRT holders.\n\n\\- RLX - being sued for securities fraud following its IPO. Chinese companies are toxic AF right now. The big put volume was either a long hedging their bet OR closing their hedged bet.\n\n\\- **CEMI** \\- another gap-down day for CEMI after exploding earlier in the week. Ouch.\n\n\\- **IGC** \\- are we seeing a pattern here yet? IGC was juiced to the tits on Thursday and came back to Earth on Friday. [I wrote about this company 4 months ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/mh9to5/no_position_dd_igc_dont_get_burned/). This stock rocketed off news of a patent for Alzheimer's treatment with THC. The company has been claiming this product would be on shelves since 2018! Their revenue is \\~$900K for fiscal 2021. Lots of red flags with this company.\n\n\\- **ACOR** \\- big gap-up for ACOR on new of commercializing one of their drugs in Spain. Gap-down Monday? We will see.\n\n\\- **ADVM** \\- big loss after the company announced one of they're drugs sucks in clinical trials, basically. In April the stock dropped over 60% in one day because one of they're drugs sucked in clinical trials. Will probably keep falling.\n\n\\- **XSPA** \\- the ticker name always makes me imagine a spa specifically for X-Men. No news, looks like algos picking up discounted options.\n\n**- NMTR** \\- considering the $1 put is the most active, and stock price is over $1, I can infer that most likely this a long hedging their position through buying puts.\n\n\\- **WISA** \\- when you fly too close to the sun, sometimes your wings melt, right Icarus? This company did investors DIRTY. After two positive days, which drove up the share price, WISA announced an offering. Way to kneecap your investors. This is one of the scummiest moves, IMO. What a gift for call sellers, though.\n\n**- CYCN** \\- gap-up on announcing that it will announce results of a clinical study soon.\n\n**- ARDX** \\- the stock price tumble continues. It seems to be slowing, but this stock still has not found bottom. Open interest continues to rise on call options, which is just goofy. High IV means people are overpaying for these options. Just wait for this to find bottom and calm down. If it has a dead cat bounce, don't rush in.\n\n\\- **CBIO** \\- the company announced they screened their first patient for a study, which is necessary before starting phase 1 of trials next year. I think this news is reflected in the Dec call buying.\n\n\\- **ADTX** \\- looks like credit call spreads establish for February. Bearish move\n\n\\- **IMV** \\- no real news, just looks like the stock finally got a bit of volume. Maybe its the purchases brought on by a public offering that was recently offered at a 16% discount to the market.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhew. Lot going on there.

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, July 14, 2021**\n\nStocks largely gained today in another volatile session, with the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Nasdaq (QQQ) once again powering to new intraday highs, the third time this week for the SPY. The major indexes continue to be driven higher by continued strength in mega-cap tech stocks. The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small caps, continued its streak of underperformance, trading 1.65% lower today at the time of writing. Market participants continue to digest new inflationary data, Q2 earnings season, and Jerome Powell\u2019s testimony before Congress. \n\nThis week, the market is starting to experience signs of volatility, with the SPY opening the session firmly in the green before falling until about the middle of the session before recovering to close the day green. It seems to me that recent reports about inflationary data have injected some uncertainty into the market. The Labor Department\u2019s June Consumer Price Index (CPI), which measures changes in the prices of consumer goods, rose 0.9% in June, accelerating from May\u2019s 0.6%. Year-on-year, the CPI is up 5.4%, exceeding the 4.9% expected by economists and the fastest rate of growth since 2008. Core CPI, which excludes the volatile price energy and food and is therefore considered a more accurate representation of general price inflation, was up 4.5% year-on-year as prices bounced from last year\u2019s pandemic-era lows.\n\nToday, a report by the Labor Department showed that the Producer Price Index (PPI), which measures the average changes in prices received by domestic producers for their output rose 1% in June, accelerating to 7.3% rise year-on-year, while still reflecting base effects. Core PPI rse 5.5%. This is the fastest rate of increase since 2009.\n\nWhile the CPI and PPI prints are not ideal, the market\u2019s somewhat muted reaction (though there was a little volatility) seems to confirm that market participants are increasingly pricing in higher-than-expected inflationary data and are buying into the Federal Reserve\u2019s argument that current pressures are transitory and due to pandemic-related disruptions. Moreover, it is very important to consider that current inflationary data is calculated on a year-on-year basis, so base effects are very much inflating the current numbers. In other words, inflationary readings are high because they are being measured using numbers from June 2020 when prices across the board collapsed as lockdowns and social distancing policies were implemented across the world. As I have said many times in the past, I am personally not yet worried about current inflationary pressures translating into a prolonged cycle of higher prices, though one always has to acknowledge the risks in the market and be prepared to act. \n\nIn other news, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell gave  his semi-annual monetary policy to Congress, where once again, he basically said the same thing he has been saying for months. Powell said \u201cinflation will likely remain elevated in the coming months before moderating\u201d and that the US economy was \u201cstill a ways\u201d off from reaching the threshold of \u201csubstantial further progress\u201d that would trigger the Central Bank to roll-back pandemic-era policies. In short, Powell basically said while he expects higher inflation prints in the coming months, pressures are transitory and due to pandemic era disruptions and the Fed\u2019s goal for economic recovery have not been met. [Here is Powell\u2019s complete testimony, but here are two of his most important quotes.](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/testimony/powell20210714a.htm)\n\n**On the labor market:** \u201cConditions in the labor market have continued to improve, but there is still a long way to go. Labor demand appears to be very strong; job openings are at a record high, hiring is robust, and many workers are leaving their current jobs to search for better ones. Indeed, employers added 1.7 million workers from April through June. However, the unemployment rate remained elevated in June at 5.9 percent, and this figure understates the shortfall in employment, particularly as participation in the labor market has not moved up from the low rates that have prevailed for most of the past year. Job gains should be strong in coming months as public health conditions continue to improve and as some of the other pandemic-related factors currently weighing them down diminish.\u201d\n\n**On inflation:** \u201cInflation has increased notably and will likely remain elevated in coming months before moderating. Inflation is being temporarily boosted by base effects, as the sharp pandemic-related price declines from last spring drop out of the 12-month calculation. In addition, strong demand in sectors where production bottlenecks or other supply constraints have limited production has led to especially rapid price increases for some goods and services, which should partially reverse as the effects of the bottlenecks unwind. Prices for services that were hard hit by the pandemic have also jumped in recent months as demand for these services has surged with the reopening of the economy\u201d.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Big banks continued to underperform today, with investors not impressed despite banks posting very strong earning reports. . JP Morgan, which is often considered a bellwether for the US economy given its sheer size, reported great results, driven in part by the release of $3 billion the bank had set aside to protect against potential losses from default loans during the pandemic, a sign that consumers held up better than the bank expected. JPM recorded revenues of $31.4 billion and profits of $11.948 billion, a staggering improvement from profits of $4.687 billion a year ago. One downside from the earnings report is a sharp reduction in revenues produced from trading, which is not surprising given the insane run by the market in 2020. \n* Airline stocks initially gapped up in the morning after American Airlines (AAL) and Delta Airlines (DAL) offered upbeat outlooks for the second half of 2021, citing increasing consumer demand as the US continues to reopen. However, stocks were unable to hold onto their gains and largely finished negative.\n* Twitter (TWTR) announced it was discontinuing its disappearing Fleets feature after failure to win traction with users.\n* According to Facebook (FB), the company is pledging $1 billion to support content creators on its platforms through the end of 2022. Content creators will receive a monthly bonus if they hit milestones for earnings Stars, a form of digital tipping that fans can use to pay their favorite creators during live-streamed videos. Instagram's bonus programs will include incentives to use Reels, its copycat TikTok feature that showcases short-form video clips. Creators will earn money based on how their Reels videos perform, the company said.\n* Microsoft (MSFT) is betting hybrid work will provide an opening to make its Windows operating system more widespread, launching a new service aimed at getting users of Apple (AAPL) and Android products to use the software. Windows 365, the company said, will be accessible on any device running any operating system that has a web browser, such as Apple Mac computers, iPhones and iPads, or those running Android software made by Alphabet (GOOGL)\n* **\\*\\*Please note price target upgrades are written during the session and may not reflect closing prices\\*\\***\n* Apple (AAPL) target raised by JP Morgan from $170 to $175 at Overweight.

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, July 9, 2021**\n\nThe stock market pulled a remarkable turnaround today, shaking off yesterday\u2019s declines with the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) rocketing to another record intraday high, led by the financial and energy sectors, which had been lagging as of late and continued strength in mega-cap tech stocks. It seems that after a brief flare-up of concerns regarding the coronavirus delta variant and a potential acceleration of the timeline to taper quantitative easing in the US, fears have greatly tempered. At the time of writing, the Dow Jones (DIA) rose 1.27% while the Nasdaq (QQQ) rose 0.6% and is very slightly below it\u2019s all-time high. The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, led the day, rising more than 2%.\n\nIn recent weeks, market participants are increasingly trying to gauge if the surge we are seeing in the more contagious coronavirus delta variant will weigh on global growth rates. Yesterday, it seems concerns came to a head after the Japanese government made a last minute announcement that a state of emergency would be re-instituted across Tokyo and that all events would take place behind closed doors, with no spectators, walking back an earlier decision to allow locals to attend the games. The state of emergency will begin on Monday and run through Aug. 22, while the games are scheduled from July 23 to Aug. 8. On Wednesday, 16 days before the Opening Ceremony, the [Tokyo Metropolitan Government reported 920 COVID cases](https://stopcovid19.metro.tokyo.lg.jp/en), over 200 more than any other single-day total since May. On Thursday, it reported 896, the second-highest count since May. Other countries, like India and Brazil, are also dealing with an extremely worrying surge of cases. Even in the US, where roughly 50% of those eligible are fully vaccinated, the country is seeing a small surge in cases recently, with the delta variant accounting for 51.7% of all new infections, according to the CDC. According to reports, as of yesterday, only 16.8% of the Japanese population was vaccinated against the virus. \n\nIn other news, in another move that raised concerns about the global growth rate, China\u2019s central bank signalled it will be cutting the amount of cash that banks must hold in reserve, a move that suggests the economic recovery in China may be slowing down. The People\u2019s Bank of China (PBOC) will reduce the reserve requirement ratio by 0.5 percentage points for most banks, according to a [statement](http://www.pbc.gov.cn/goutongjiaoliu/113456/113469/4287599/index.html) published Friday. That will unleash about 1 trillion yuan ($154 billion) of long-term liquidity into the economy and will be effective on July 15, the central bank said. The reduction was signaled earlier this week, when the State Council, China\u2019s equivalent of a cabinet, hinted the central bank would make more liquidity available to banks so they could lend to smaller firms hurt by rising costs. The timing and magnitude of the move, coming a week before second-quarter growth data, suggests worries about the economy\u2019s outlook and was a decisive shift away from policy tightening, which most, if not all, recovering economies are pursuing.\n\nKen Cheung, Chief Asian Foreign Exchange Strategist at Mizuho, said \u201cThe PBOC came in broader and sooner than expected, highlighting the policy urgency to support the Chinese economy. Such firm easing measures could further fuel concern over China\u2019s growth outlook in the second half as well as the upcoming Q2 GDP figures in the coming week\u201d. Just to put into more familiar terms, this would be like if the Federal Reserve suddenly turned around and said rather than discussing tapering quantitative easing, it would instead propose pumping more money into the economy.\n\nWhile these global concerns did jitter the market yesterday, the impressive recovery in US equities underscores the remarkable strength of its economy, as the country continues reopening thanks to effective distribution of the vaccine, with 48% of the population fully vaccinated, according to the CDC. In my opinion, while the delta variant does pose a risk to global growth rates, and the market may react negatively to headlines about it, the foundations of the recovery in the US (i.e nation-wide reopening measures, a rapidly improving labor market, record earnings from companies, and a high level of savings among Americans) are very strong and will continue to underpin a bull market here. \n\n**Highlights** \n\n* The recent sell-off in crude oil recovered, with the West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures settling higher by 2.2% to $74.56 per barrel at the time of writing.\n* Apple (AAPL), the largest company in the world, reached a new all-time high today. \n* President Biden is expected to sign an executive agreement ordering the Federal Trade Commission to limit or ban noncompete agreements, unnecessary occupational licenses, and revise guidance for sharing wage information between the HR department and workers and other employers. \n* Tesla (TSLA), Brookfield Asset Management (BAM) said Friday they would work together on a new initiative to create the nation's most sustainable residential community. The companies said the provisionally named SunHouse at Easton Park in Austin, Texas, would be the first Tesla Solar neighborhood.\n* On Monday, a trial will kick off in the Court of Chancery in Wilmington, Delaware between Elon Musk and shareholders. The plaintiffs alleged that Musk used his control at Tesla to force the company to buy SolarCity for $2.6 billion in order to protect his investment in the company from bankruptcy and want Musk to pay that money back to Tesla. IMO seems a little weird to me to sue about this given that SolarCity has proven to be a good acquisition for Tesla.\n* Apple (AAPL) is reportedly in early talks with the NFL to buy the rights to stream Sunday Night games for their streaming service. A while ago, Amazon (AMZN) bought the right to stream Thursday NFL games for Prime Video. \n* Marvel\u2019s \u201cBlack Widow, opened in theaters last night and is expected to be the biggest opening since 2019, with the film projected to bring around $80 million domestically. This is huge and a sign that Americans' appetite to go to movie-theaters is very real. Personally, I\u2019m going to go watch in the theaters this weekend. \n* Foxconn, a well known supplier for Apple, is discussing plans with Fisker (FSR) to open a factory to build EV\u2019s in Wisconsin. In a statement, the company said, \u201cFoxconn has engaged the Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation (WEDC) to discuss the company's plans for electric vehicle manufacturing.

The Dow Jones (DIA), which tracks industrial and financial stocks, fell 0.37%. The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, outperformed, rising 1.53% at the time of writing. Just like last Monday, today demonstrates that, while there are risks present in the market, investors and traders remain eager to buy up every dip.\n\nToday, market participants continue to digest a slew of earnings reports, with three of the largest companies in the market, Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), and Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG) reporting yesterday. Today, after-hours, Facebook (FB) and PayPal (PYPL) are reporting, among many others. \n\nMoreover, market participants also eyed the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) July Monetary Policy Report, which largely reiterated what members of the Fed have been saying for months, but did include some new language hinting that the economic recovery is getting closer to the Fed\u2019s stated goals. The statement read, \u201cLast December, the Committee indicated that it would continue to increase its holdings of Treasury securities by at least $80 billion per month and of agency mortgage\u2011backed securities by at least $40 billion per month until substantial further progress has been made toward its maximum employment and price stability goals. Since then, the economy has made progress toward these goals, and the Committee will continue to assess progress in coming meetings.\u201d In other words, the Fed says substantial progress has been made and that in the coming months, we will increasingly begin to hear more about a timeline to taper quantitative easing. \n\nOn inflation, the statement largely reiterated what it has in months past. The statement read, \u201cInflation has risen, largely reflecting transitory factors. Overall financial conditions remain accommodative, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses\u201d and \u201cThe Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. With inflation having run persistently below this longer-run goal, the Committee will aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time so that inflation averages 2 percent over time and longer\u2011term inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2 percent. The Committee expects to maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy until these outcomes are achieved.\u201d\n\nHowever, the report did acknowledge potential risks and stated the Fed was ready to act if \u201cappropriate risks arise\u201d. The statement read, \u201cIn assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee's goals. The Committee's assessments will take into account a wide range of information, including readings on public health, labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments.\u201d\n\nRead the entire July FOMC statement here: [https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20210728a.htm](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20210728a.htm)\n\nShares of Facebook (FB) fell 5% after-hours despite largely beating analyst after the company warned of a significant slowdown moving forward. Here are the numbers.\n\n* **Earnings:** $3.61 per share, adjusted, vs. $3.03 per share as expected by analysts, according to Refinitiv.\n* **Revenue:** $29.08 billion, vs. $27.89 billion as expected by analysts, according to Refinitiv.\n* **Daily active users (DAUs):** 1.91 billion, vs. 1.91 billion as expected by analysts, according to StreetAccount.\n* **Monthly active users (MAUs):** 2.90 billion, vs. 2.91 billion as expected by analysts, according to StreetAccount.\n* **Average revenue per user (ARPU):** $10.12, vs. $9.66 as expected by analysts, according to StreetAccount.\n\nImportantly, however, with respect to guidance, Facebook warned of a significant deceleration in growth moving forward. The company said it expects \u201cyear-over-year total revenue growth rates to decelerate significantly on a sequential basis as we lap periods of increasingly strong growth.\u201d\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Twitter (TWTR) stock surged roughly 5% before moderating after the company announced it was testing a new feature called the \u201cShop Module\u201d that would enable businesses to sell their products directly through the Twitter platform. \n* Quarterly revenue for LinkedIn, the professional social network owned by tech giant Microsoft, surpassed $1 billion in the quarter for the first time.\n* Youtube, which is owned by Alphabet, reported revenues of $7 billion for the quarter. To put into context how massive YouTube really is, Netflix (NFLX) had $7.3 billion in revenue this quarter, which has a $230 billion market-cap. It\u2019s funny, in a world where the competition between streaming services for professional content is becoming increasingly more saturated, YouTube is poised to become and doesn\u2019t spend billions to produce and acquire content. \n* Shares of chip-maker AMD gapped up today after the company beat earnings estimates and raised guidance moving forward that suggests the company will continue to take market share away from Intel. As I\u2019ve said before, I think AMD and NVDA are the kings of this space.\n* Chinese stocks gapped up today after a massive, across the board sell-off. \n* Microsoft (MSFT) earnings Yesterday\n   * **Revenue:** $46.15 billion versus $44.25 billion expected\n   * **Earnings per share:** $2.17 versus $1.92 expected\n   * **Productivity and Business Processes:** $14.69 billion versus $13.9 billion expected\n   * **Intelligent Cloud:** $17.38 billion versus $16.4 billion expected\n   * **More Personal Computing:** $14.09 billion versus $13.8 billion expected\n* Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG) earnings yesterday\n   * **Earnings per share (EPS):** $27.26 vs $19.34 per share\n   * **Revenue:** $61.88 billion vs $56.16 billion\n   * **YouTube advertising revenue:** $7.00 billion vs $6.37 billion expected\n   * **Google Cloud revenue:** $4.63 billion vs $4.40 billion expected, \n   * **Traffic acquisition costs (TAC):** $10.93 billion vs $9.74 billion expected\n* Apple (AAPL) earnings yesterday\n   * **EPS**: $1.30 vs. $1.01 estimated \n   * **Revenue**: $81.41 billion vs. $73.30 billion estimated, up 36% year-over-year \n   * **iPhone revenue**: $39.57 billion vs. $34.01 billion estimated, up 49.78% year-over-year \n   * **Services revenue**: $17.48 billion vs. $16.33 billion estimated, up 33% year-over-year \n   * **Other Products revenue**: $8.76 billion vs. $7.80 billion estimated, up 40% year-over-year \n   * **Mac revenue**:$8.24 billion vs. $8.07 billion estimated, up 16% year-over-year \n   * **iPad revenue**: $7.37 billion vs. $7.15 billion estimated, up 12% year-over-year \n   * **Gross margin**: 43.3% vs. 41.9% estimated \n* **\\*\\*Please note that current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect closing prices\\*\\***\n* Apple (AAPL) with a host of target raises.

What are recent stocks you bought and in which sector?

        "selftext": "It was evident that PSFE had finally found bottom last week.  For months, we saw all the tell-tale signs of market manipulators expertly shaking out retail shareholders with order flow, short volume, massive block trades and 13F\u2019s showing institutions steadily loading up.  In this context, just as PSFE was to be officially added to the Russell 1000 and 3000 indexes, it seemed a little suspicious that Paysafe was suddenly being hyped and trending on WallStreetBets.  I had to wonder if this was an engineered event to generate more liquidity since market makers were clearly running out of sellers right when they had to fill a lot more institutional orders.\n\nThat\u2019s all just monkey brain theory that ultimately doesn't matter because my plan is to hold PSFE for a long time.  There is a clear strategy with this company that will take some time to come to fruition and I want to be in on the ground floor, before all the rosy ER\u2019s come in.  With a fintech that does roughly as much transactional volume as Square and, despite recent reports, has similar growth to PayPal, it\u2019s no surprise that institutions want to accumulate at levels so low that the stock is almost completely de-risked from a long-term perspective.\n\nThe comprehensive DD below is for investors with a longer view who may have been caught in the recent hype. Know that you\u2019re not alone. We saw the same thing right after CNBC\u2019s Jim Cramer called Paysafe, \u201cthe ultimate stock for this moment\u201d and market analyst Steve Grasso repeated his calls for it go to \u201c$45/$50 and then settle in before moving higher from there.\u201d  After initial spikes, deep-pocketed short-sellers methodically crushed retail holders, eventually bringing the price down to where it was last week.\n\nBut informed short sellers knew they couldn't push too far because that price was really not far from the price paid by noted fund managers like Dan Loeb (Third Point 41.5 million shares), David Tepper (Appaloosa Management, 10 million shares), Aaron Cohen (Survetta Capital, 13 million shares), Dipanjan Deb (Francisco Partners, 20 million shares) and Leon Cooperman (personally owns 1.1 million shares).  A price probably lower than paid by Wells Fargo\u2019s several funds (12 million shares) and even by Blackstone when they raised their initial stake of 123 million shares to a total of 160 million shares.^(1)  Also, it\u2019s worth noting that, since they all decided to invest, Paysafe has created significant value including securing new revenue streams in the US iGaming market and expanded partnerships with Coinbase, ESL Gaming, Luckbox, and Microsoft among others. ^(2)\n\nWith a presence in 120 countries, Paysafe is an extremely diversified global payment processor: #1 global leader in iGaming, #2 global digital wallet, #4 globally in integrated merchant processing. Ever since private equity groups Blackstone and CVC took Paysafe private, they\u2019ve been going through a major restructuring to reduce risk, increase margins and profits. It's because they are still very much in the middle of that process that I like it so much as an investment opportunity. Here are a few key points:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* In 2017, private equity groups Blackstone and CVC raised their bid five times to ultimately to take Paysafe private for $3.9 billion.^(3)  Blackstone says their typical investment term is \u201cupwards of 7-10 years\u201d ^(4) which aligns with the investment time-frame implied by an inside source close to those negotiations who said, \u201cThere is a fundamental change in the way we pay for goods and services, away from the cash and cheques of our parents\u2019 age,\u201d adding that the private equity firms \u201chave a decade-long thesis that this shift will only grow and grow and they want to get in now.\u201d ^(5)\n* Under Blackstone/CVC\u2019s stewardship, Paysafe grew revenue 65% from $864 million to $1.418 billion (28% CAGR pre-Covid). Last year, due to Covid-related brick-and-mortar business and sporting event closures, along with their long-standing strategic decision to exit specific high-risk Asian revenue channels, 2020 revenue stagnated.  This is the reason they recently reported only 5% YoY quarterly growth.  In their Q1 ER, management noted that, without those channel exits they would have reported growth in the \u201cmid to high teens.\u201d  But even if you include 2020\u2019s stagnant growth, their overall revenue growth since 2017 was still 18% CAGR. This is roughly the same as PayPal\u2019s current projected growth. ^(6,7)\n* A few months ago, Paysafe was brought public through a reverse merger transaction with acclaimed deal maker Bill Foley, Chairman of Fidelity. The deal paid down $1.2 billion in debt and gave Blackstone/CVC about $5.6 billion in cash and shares.^(8)  The fact that Blackstone's recent 13F shows they bought back 37 million shares, combined with statements from them and Paysafe's board, indicates that they did this deal, not for a mere 44% gain on a four year investment, but because Bill Foley is an extraordinarily successful and well-connected deal maker who has a proven track record for generating exponential growth.\n* Inorganic growth through M&amp;A is a major pillar of Paysafe\u2019s strategy going forward.  Bill Foley, now Chairman of Paysafe and a major shareholder, is a proven M&amp;A synergy wizard, particularly in the financial services arena.  Foley took Fidelity National Financial from $3 million market cap to $10.8 billion. Yeah, that\u2019s and \u201cm\u201d and a \u201cb\u201d.  Over just the last five years, Foley grew Ceridian 3.3X ($4.2B to $14B), Dun &amp; Bradstreet 5.6X ($2B to $11.3B), and Black Knight 8.7X ($1.6B to $14B).  Through his proven M&amp;A playbook, Foley also grew FIS from $2.5 billion to over $91 billion market cap. That\u2019s a 36x return.  He says  \u201cThose characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.\u201d ^(6,9)\n\n**Deleveraging, increasing margins and profit**\n\n* Paysafe recently confirmed they are on track to meet 2021 projections of $1.53 billion in revenue, $930-$970 million in gross profit, double-digit growth and expanding 30-35% EBITDA margins, and $103 billion in transactional volume.  Paysafe\u2019s already strong $362 million in 2020 free cash flow was reported to be on track for 29% growth in 2021.  Notably, their multi-year projections don\u2019t include growth from their \"active M&amp;A pipeline\" and their ongoing US iGaming expansion (projected at 55% CAGR).\n* Q1's earnings disappointed some because, as part of their restructuring, they had $90 million in one-time non-recurring expenses associated with the merger and paying down $1.2 billion in debt. The company noted: \u201cResults included interest expense of $58.5 million, an increase of 53% compared to the prior year, reflecting the expense of capitalized debt fees as a result of debt repayment on March 31, 2021. Net loss also included share-based compensation of $72.4 million, compared to none in the prior year due to shares vested on completion of the Transaction.\"\n* Take away the $90 million in one-time expenses and, rather than reporting a $49 million loss, the company would have reported $41 million in quarterly net profit, thereby beating all analyst estimates. All signs indicate they are on track to beat estimates going forward, although I have noticed a few platforms raising those estimates recently.\n* In addition to paying down $1.2 billion in debt, an improved Moody\u2019s credit rating has enabled the company to refinance roughly a billion at a 1.25% lower interest rate, with an option to reduce it another 25bp.^(10)  Foley says: \u201cOne of the keys to this transaction and value creation for our shareholders is the reduction of Paysafe\u2019s leverage ratio to 3.6x Debt/EBITDA.\u201d  Notably, this Debt/EBITDA ratio is far better than the majority of their fintech peers, and the resulting improved margins stand to make it better still.\n* The combined effect of overall recent debt management will be a savings of around $92 million annually.  This secures higher margins, increased cash for M&amp;A and higher profits which, in my view, will lead to raised price targets and positive price action catalysts.\n* As part of their restructuring to cut down on operating expenses and further increase margins, Paysafe has recently forged agreements with Snowflake and AWS as they move to cloud-based integration for easier migration between their platforms, easier cross-border payments and planned expansion into global banking as a service, having identified a $58 trillion TAM.\n\n**Highly competitve**\n\n* Unlike other payment processors, Paysafecard enables those without basic ID metrics, credit cards, or even bank accounts (the 1.7 billion \u201cunbanked\u201d globally) to engage in eCommerce in over 50 countries. This segment grew 63% YoY.  Just today, Microsoft introduced Payesafecard to its Xbox platform in 22 countries.\n* In various segments, Paysafe has recently expanded their partnerships with FOX bet, Roblox, Fortnight, Coinbase, Amazon, Twitch, Microsoft/Xbox, bet365, ApplePay, Draftkings, Spotify, Youtube, Visa, Betfair, PayLease, ESL Gaming, Luckbox, Amelco, BetMGM, Ceasar\u2019s, and Pointsbet among many others.\n* \\#4 globally in integrated merchant processing, Paysafe\u2019s proprietary scalable electronic payment platform was voted \u201cBest Omni-Channel Payment Solution\u201d, \u201cPayment Processor of the Year,\u201d and \u201cBest Payment Method.\u201d\n* They are #2 globally in the digital wallet space with a presence in 120 countries. They own Neteller and Skrill, which was voted \u201cBest Digital Wallet\u201d for \u201cbest consumer take up\u201d, \u201cmost innovative technology\u201d with \u201cgreatest potential to disrupt current ecosystems.\u201d\n* People are usually more likely to leave reviews when a payment platform doesn\u2019t meet their expectations. That said, Trustpilot rates Paysafecard as \u201cExcellent\u201d (4.7/5 stars-31,981 reviews), Paysafe\u2019s digital wallet Skrill as \u201cgreat\u201d (4.1/5 stars-18,037 reviews) and Skrill Money Transfer as Excellent (4.8/5 stars - 8,349 reviews). ^(11)\n   * By contrast, Truspilot rates Stripe as \u201cAverage 3.4/5 stars- 6,208 reviews), Venmo as \u201cbad\u201d (1.2/5 starts - 222 reveiews), Zelle as \u201cbad\u201d (1.2/5 stars - 326 reviews) and PayPal as \"bad\" (1.2/5 stars-18,555 reviews). ^(12)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**\u201cAt Paysafe, the iGaming market volume was estimated to be $3.4 billion in 2019, and is now projected to reach $47 billion in 2025.\u201d**\n\n**\u201cIt\u2019s our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate.\"** \\- Bill Foley\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Paysafe is the #1 global leader in iGaming payment processing, a space that is extremely difficult to enter, due to managing risk and a very complex regulatory landscape. Paysafe\u2019s advantage here is a large aspect of its MOAT, as discussed below.  Paysafe is often an integrated back-end payment processor so most don\u2019t realize they are using it but they are already integrated with 75% of all US iGaming operators. Paysafe is actively laying the groundwork for their US expansion in the wake of a US Supreme Court decision allowing state-legalized sports betting.\n* Bill Foley says, \"It\u2019s going to be a land grab. We want to be out there about 10 miles ahead of everybody else\u2026we\u2019re seeding the future growth right now by state and by operator... The day a state opens up, we are there ready from a regulatory perspective, from a risk perspective, and from a product perspective... I have a vision that we should be THE digital wallet and have tie-ins with every major casino company that\u2019s headquartered or located in Las Vegas.

A few quotes :\n   * RBC Capital 5-star analyst Daniel Perlin: \u201cWe believe PSFE offers a unique combination of digital wallet capabilities, accelerated cash conversion for consumers who would otherwise be out of the ecommrece loop, and integrated payments, all focused on specialized &amp; complex end-markets, which creates a competitive moat and pricing power.\u201d \u201crecent underperformance is largely due to the complex nature of PSFE\u2019s business and the FTAC II transaction\u201d and adds his view that Paysafe offers one of the best combinations of services in online payment space: \u201cPSFE has created a unique two-sided network enabling merchants to accept online &amp; in-store payments (in specific niche verticals), while also offering consumers a digital wallet &amp; eCash solution, which converts cash-heavy users to digital users. We believe it\u2019s this combination that enables PSFE to generate superior take rate economics vs. peers.\u201d ^(14)\n   * BMO Capital, 5-star analyst, James Fotheringham: \u201cPSFE is a global leader in iGaming (online betting related to sports, poker, and other casino games, as well as lotteries and bingo). Indeed, 36% of PSFE\u2019s revenues are from global iGaming. That is far more than for any of its peers.\u201d iGaming deposit volumes in the U.S. will grow \u201cat more than five times the rate of growth elsewhere in the world\u201d with a \"5-year CAGR (compound annual growth rate) of between 40% to 55%.\" ^(15)\n   * Evercore ISI analyst David Togut 'praised Paysafe for its \u201crobust risk management operation,\u201d and its high rankings in several key performance indictors globally, including cash network, stored digital wallet value, and amount of partnered independent merchants.' ^(16)\n\n**MOAT:**  **\u201crobust risk management operation\u201d**\n\nSo why does Paysafe dominate iGaming and why how is it able offer eCommerce services to the 1.7 billion globally who can't even manage to have bank accounts or credit cards?\n\nTheir industry leading multi-jurisdictional regulatory expertise offers a durable advantage in spaces where competing fintechs are hesitant or unwilling to enter. CEO Philip McHugh from transcript : \u201cWhen we talk about a deep and a wide MOAT, this is absolutely one of the areas that we see that benefit where it\u2019s hard to copy.\u2026We have over 300 professionals dedicated to risk, compliance, and analytics. That is very, very rare in the payments space. It\u2019s a real strength of ours. We\u2019ve been able to track some of the top people in the industry, including the former CRO from PayPal, and we\u2019ve upgraded the team, we\u2019ve built some real data capabilities, and we see this continuing to be an area of differentiation for Paysafe versus others.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can de-risk some transactions where the market has abandoned many of these players\u2026we bring millions of consumers into the ecosystem. We bring unique ways to pay and access funds that a typical card processor certainly can\u2019t do. When you have that two-sided network, you change the conversation. When we speak to some of our largest iGaming customers, we\u2019re not only talking about take rates and comps, we\u2019re talking about revenue-generation, we\u2019re talking about attracting the types of customers that they want and they need in their ecosystem. That\u2019s a really, really powerful position to have.\u201d ^(9)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Valuation:**\n\nA while back I looked at a basket of fintech peers including PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, BILL, GPN, and Paysign.\n\n* Paysafe reports 30%+ EBITDA margin,  mid to high teen EBITDA growth, and $362 million in free cash flow (now on track to increase 29%),\n* By comparison, a third of the peer group reported negative EBITDA, half reported negative EBITDA growth, and a third negative free cash flow.\n* Paysafe also has better EPS than over half the group and better Debt/EBITDA ratio than 3/4 of them.\n* The group's collective growth rate of \\~12.5% is in the range of Paysafe's 10-13% projections but the company's estimates may be intentionally conservative as they do not take into account their current expansion into US iGaming nor do they factor in their \"active M&amp;A pipeline.\"  Foley is apparently known for under-promising and over-performing.\n* As noted above, Paysafe was growing 28% CAGR pre-Covid, but taking into account last years slow down due to Covid-related business closures and strategic channel exits, it grew at 18% CAGR, a rate on par with PayPal's projected growth.\n\nGiven all the above factors, it seems fair to look at Paysafe's potential price based on an average of peer multiples:\n\nPaysafe\u2019s share price with average of sector peer multiples:\n\n* EV/EBITDA ratio : $122.09\n* EV/Rev ratio : $83.91\n* EV/FCF ratio : $87.86\n\nAverage: $97.95\n\nMore realistic price after removing all outliers in each category which put PSFE share price over $100\n\n* EV/EBITDA ratio : **$50.75**\n* EV/Rev ratio : **$44.64**\n* EV/FCF ratio : **$44.18**\n\n**Average : $46.52**\n\nIn a nutshell, the basket of sector peers has an average growth within Paysafe\u2019s conservative projections yet they trade at 350-750% higher multiples. With Paysafe having better financials than most, it is hard to argue that this is proportionate. Either the entire field has to come down or Paysafe has to go up.  While I don't necessarily agree with his time frame, market analyst Steve Grasso's call for \"$45/55\" may actually be quite reasonable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Sources:**\n\n(1) [https://fintel.io/so/us/psfe](https://fintel.io/so/us/psfe).\n\n(2) [https://www.reddit.com/r/PSFE/comments/oak2jx/paysafes\\_value\\_creation\\_trajectory\\_is\\_very\\_much/](https://www.reddit.com/r/PSFE/comments/oak2jx/paysafes_value_creation_trajectory_is_very_much/)\n\n(3) [https://www.wsj.com/articles/blackstone-cvc-to-buy-paysafe-for-3-9-billion-in-latest-online-payments-deal-1501830827](https://www.wsj.com/articles/blackstone-cvc-to-buy-paysafe-for-3-9-billion-in-latest-online-payments-deal-1501830827)\n\n(4) [https://pws.blackstone.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2020/09/the\\_life\\_cycle\\_of\\_private\\_equity\\_insights.pdf](https://pws.blackstone.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2020/09/the_life_cycle_of_private_equity_insights.pdf)\n\n(5) [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-paysafe-group-m-a-idUSKBN1AK0KN](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-paysafe-group-m-a-idUSKBN1AK0KN)\n\n(6) [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1818355/000119312520311998/d54063d425.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1818355/000119312520311998/d54063d425.htm)\n\n(7) [https://www.paysafe.com/fileadmin/content/pdf/Analyst\\_Day\\_presentation\\_March\\_9\\_\\_2021.pdf](https://www.paysafe.com/fileadmin/content/pdf/Analyst_Day_presentation_March_9__2021.pdf)\n\n(8) [https://sec.report/Document/0001104659-20-089252/](https://sec.report/Document/0001104659-20-089252/)\n\n(9)  [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1818355/000119312520311837/d18843d425.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1818355/000119312520311837/d18843d425.htm)\n\n(10)  Global Capital link removed due to forbidden word in the url. \n\n(11) [https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.paysafecard.com](https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.paysafecard.com)\n\n(12) [https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.paypal.com](https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.paypal.com)\n\n(13)  [https://www.streetinsider.com/Analyst+Comments/UPDATE%3A+Compass+Point+Starts+Paysafe+Group+Ltd.+%28PFSE%29+at+Buy%3B+All-In+on+an+iGaming+Opportunity/18197588.html](https://www.streetinsider.com/Analyst+Comments/UPDATE%3A+Compass+Point+Starts+Paysafe+Group+Ltd.+%28PFSE%29+at+Buy%3B+All-In+on+an+iGaming+Opportunity/18197588.html)\n\n(14) [https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/billionaire-david-tepper-places-bet-on-3-strong-buy-stocks-2021-06-04](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/billionaire-david-tepper-places-bet-on-3-strong-buy-stocks-2021-06-04)\n\n(15) [https://themoneymanifesto.com/2021/06/21/paysafe-is-ready-to-ride-the-igaming-wave-analyst-says-buy/](https://themoneymanifesto.com/2021/06/21/paysafe-is-ready-to-ride-the-igaming-wave-analyst-says-buy/)\n\n(16) [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/paysafe-poised-profit-085250018.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/paysafe-poised-profit-085250018.html)",

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, July 29, 2021**\n\nDespite some volatility earlier in the week, stocks firmly rose today as market participants looked beyond slightly disappointing GDP and jobs data and the Federal Reserve\u2019s July Monetary Policy, which showed no changes but did indicate members are increasingly considering the potential timeline to taper quantitative easing (QE). In my opinion, the fact that markets continue to shrug off volatility to charge higher shows great relative strength and signals that market participants remain willing and able to buy dips. \n\nThe S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Dow Jones (DIA) both recorded fresh all-time highs, closing 0.4% and 0.42% higher respectively. The Nasdaq (QQQ) is right under its own record high and closed the day 0.18% higher. The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, outperformed again, closing 0.77% higher.\n\nToday, the US Bureau of Economic Analysis released its advanced estimate of second-quarter gross-domestic-product (GDP) growth. Despite accelerating from the first-quarter, economists were largely expecting a higher jump, despite consumer spending, the largest component of US economic activity, beating expectations. However, it seems market participants were not fazed. Here are the numbers:\n\n* **Q2 GDP, seasonally adjusted annualized quarter-over-quarter:** 6.5% vs. 8.4% expected and a downwardly revised 6.3% in Q1\n* **Personal consumption:** 11.8% vs. 10.5% expected and 11.4% in Q1\n* **Core personal consumption expenditures, quarter-over-quarter:** 6.0% vs. 6.1% expected and an upwardly revised 2.7% in Q1\n\nMarket participants are digesting the Federal Reserve\u2019s July Monetary Policy Report, released yesterday, which largely reiterated what members of the Fed have been saying for months, but did include some new language hinting that the economic recovery is getting closer to the Fed\u2019s stated goals. The statement read, \u201cLast December, the Committee indicated that it would continue to increase its holdings of Treasury securities by at least $80 billion per month and of agency mortgage\u2011backed securities by at least $40 billion per month until substantial further progress has been made toward its maximum employment and price stability goals. Since then, the economy has made progress toward these goals, and the Committee will continue to assess progress in coming meetings.\u201d In other words, the Fed says substantial progress has been made and that in the coming months, we will increasingly begin to hear more about a timeline to taper quantitative easing. \n\nOn inflation, the statement largely reiterated what it has in months past. The statement read, \u201cInflation has risen, largely reflecting transitory factors. Overall financial conditions remain accommodative, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses\u201d and \u201cThe Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. With inflation having run persistently below this longer-run goal, the Committee will aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time so that inflation averages 2 percent over time and longer\u2011term inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2 percent. The Committee expects to maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy until these outcomes are achieved.\u201d\n\nHowever, the report did acknowledge potential risks and stated the Fed was ready to act if \u201cappropriate risks arise\u201d. The statement read, \u201cIn assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee's goals. The Committee's assessments will take into account a wide range of information, including readings on public health, labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments.\u201d\n\nRead the entire July FOMC statement here: [https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20210728a.htm](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20210728a.htm)\n\nAmazon (AMZN) absolutely smashed earnings, posting probably the most impressive quarter I have ever seen. Despite this, the stock is currently down 5% after some analysts raised concerns about a slowdown in growth moving forward due to reopenings and difficult comparisons. Personally, with numbers like this, I am going to snap up any dip if it continues tomorrow. Here are the numbers:\n\n* **Revenue:** $115.06 billion expected versus $88.91 billion in Q2 2020\n* **EPS:** $15.75 expected versus $10.30 in Q2 2020\n* **AWS revenue:** $14.18 billion expected versus $10.81 billion in Q2 2020\n\nIn other news, the Labor Department Weekly Unemployment Report came in higher than expected. Here are the numbers \n\n* **New Jobless Claims:** 400,000 vs 385,000 expected\n* **Continuing Claims:** 3.269 million vs 3.183 million expected\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Yesterday, shares of Facebook (FB), which recently joined the $1 trillion market-cap club, fell after the company warned of a \u201csignificant slowdown\u201d in growth moving forward and suggested that Apple\u2019s (AAPL) newest iOS app-tracking update, which let\u2019s users opt out of having apps track their activity outside their own platform, would negatively impact their core advertising business. Here are the numbers\n   * **Earnings:** $3.61 per share, adjusted, vs. $3.03 per share as expected\\\\\n   * **Revenue:** $29.08 billion, vs. $27.89 billion as expected by analysts\n   * **Daily active users (DAUs):** 1.91 billion, vs. 1.91 billion as expected\n   * **Monthly active users (MAUs):** 2.90 billion, vs. 2.91 billion as expected\n   * **Average revenue per user (ARPU):** $10.12, vs. $9.66 as expected \n* PayPal (PYPL) also reported earnings, which were largely in-line with expectations. As a result, stock fell roughly 5% today. Personally, that move seems a little overdone to me.\n* Today was the highly anticipated IPO of Robinhood (HOOD), popular brokerage that has garnered a horrendous reputation among many retail traders, particularly those who invest in \u201cmeme stocks\u201d. Like I have said before, personally not touching that stock with a 10-foot pole, too many dynamics at play. But it will still be fun to keep track of.\n* President Biden on Thursday called for state and local governments to make $100 payments to every newly vaccinated American as authorities race to stem the newest wave of Covid-19 cases. \n* Trevor Milton, founder and former CEO of Nikola Motors, the truck, hydrogen start-up that turned out to be a fraud, was charged with defrauding investors.\n* **\\*\\*Please note that current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect closing prices\\*\\***\n* Align Technologies (ALGN) with two target raises.

Quarles. \u201cIn my judgment, we do not need to fear stablecoins. The Federal Reserve has traditionally supported responsible private-sector innovation. Consistent with this tradition, I believe that we must take strong account of the potential benefits of stablecoins, including the possibility that a U.S. dollar stablecoin might support the role of the dollar in the global economy. For example, a global U.S. dollar stablecoin network could encourage use of the dollar by making cross-border payments faster and cheaper, and it potentially could be deployed much faster and with fewer downsides than a CBDC. And the concern that stablecoins represent the unprecedented creation of private money and thus challenge our monetary sovereignty is puzzling, given that our existing system involves\u2014indeed depends on\u2014private firms creating money every day.\u201d\n\n\n\nOther catalysts:\n\n    \u2022 Court case vs. against Apple: Currently seems to head to settlement.

The float seems to be locked as well. I\u2019m very bullish on this and expecting more positive news from the company itself, and from the Fed. APTY\u2019s current focus is just on time with the financial and technological trends. Currently the ticker is not current yet, so there is room to run with news being released by the company.\n\n\n\nBearish case:\n\n    \u2022 APTY doesn\u2019t follow through with what they said.\n        \u25e6 Very reputable management with a great background, law firm represent them is great.\n    \u2022 Their financial revealed to be bad.\n        \u25e6 According to their aurex slides, it is quite profitable.\n    \u2022 Government turned its back on stablecoins.\n        \u25e6 Very less likely, it seems the Fed would like to embrace the private coins that pass the AML and KYC requirements and other rules. Hopefully to extend fiat benefits to the crypto asset.\n\nDD subjected to edit as others might point out errors or anything needed to be added.",

This could make buying SQ analogous to buying J.P. Morgan in 1871,\" Dolev wrote in a new research note to clients.\u00a0\n\nDolev reiterated his Buy rating and $380 price target on Square. The company's stock currently trades at $238, up about 8% on the year, according to [Yahoo Finance Plus data](https://www.yahoo.com/plus/finance?ncid=editoriald_yhm5ec0oo8o).\u00a0\n\nAt the heart of Dolev's call is Square evolving into the bank of the future via its Cash App, one that essentially becomes the financial hub for consumers. Currently, the Cash App offers payment services, stock trading and the ability to buy bitcoin.\u00a0\n\n\"We view Cash App as the ultimate challenger bank. Our detailed build of potential products shows a clear path from Cash App's current $40-50 average revenue per user (ARPU) to $150-200 over the coming years by adding products that range from tax services, to insurance, to home equity lending\" Dolev said.\u00a0\n\n[ Sign with logo at the headquarters of mobile payment company Square in the South of Market \\(SoMa\\) neighborhood of San Francisco, California, October 13, 2017.

We estimate that the U.S. bank account TAM \\[total addressable market\\] is 400 \\[million\\]-500 million accounts. This implies more than 10x potential upside to its user base. Conservatively assuming Square reaches 15% penetration of the total U.S. bank account TAM (\\~70 million active users, up from 36 million in December 2020), coupled with ARPU \\[average revenue per user\\] of $175 (midpoint of $150-200), points to nearly $12 billion in medium term gross profit potential.

        "selftext": "I've been struggling these past few months at settling on a portfolio that I was happy with. I am young (23), so I wanted my investments to take advantage of that by being more aggressive with growth. At the same time, I realize that the current market is overextended, and a lot of the companies I really like are trading with a lot of that growth priced in. So, I wanted to put together a portfolio that would satisfy my risk/reward tolerance without having to pay a hefty premium.\n\nThe two pieces of advice that I greatly resonate with are:\n\n1. Invest in a great company at a good price &gt; good company at a great price\n2. concentration builds wealth, diversification preserves it\n\nSo I wanted to keep the number of stocks low (&lt;10) and put my money in companies for which I have high conviction. I started out by first creating a list of sectors that I think are best set up for hyper-growth in the next 10-20 years. For me, those are:\n\n* Tech &gt; Information &amp; Communications / AI, AR, and Automation / Cyber Security\n* Financial Services &gt; FinTech\n* Healthcare &gt; Health Tech &amp; Genomics\n* Consumer Cyclicals &gt; Internet Retail / Gambling\n* EVs\n\nObviously, that list is not exhaustive, but those are the areas I feel the most comfortable with and in which I can see the long-term potential. I used that list as a starting point to look into companies and solidify the ones that will make up my portfolio. Some of the positions are more speculative than others, but I have found to have a compelling enough business model for me to invest in. If you have any criticism or suggestions, please comment below! I'm always looking to learn and discover great companies!\n\n# Portfolio Holdings:\n\n**FB**\n\nFor me, this was a no-brainer. The fundamentals are absurdly strong; pretty much no debt with a boatload of free cash. Consistent share buybacks (although not much) and increase in revenue. Outside of the main platform, it owns Instagram and Whatsapp which are incredibly sticky apps. Not to mention all the other projects they have going on (Occulus, FB Watch, etc.). What appealed to me the most was the fact that their ROIC is one of the best compared to the other FAANG stocks. There's also still room for ARPU to grow, especially on the international level. Instagram is also getting reworked to increase monetization. This stock is still undervalued/fairly valued and has, in my opinion, a lot more growth compared to some of the other FAANG companies.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**SOFI**\n\nI wanted a piece of the fintech space, but the industry leaders PYPL and SQ are way too expensive for me to justify starting a position now. Comparatively, SOFI is trading way below their multiples and there's a lot to like about this company. With SPACs, a lot of the time the fundamentals do not match up to the hype they receive. However, SOFI's Q1 report showed tremendous YOY growth with promising guidance. They also show an increase in the number of users that use more than one of their services, which is an extremely important part of their identity. Now bears may say that this company lacks a moat because traditional banks can just enter the space easily, however, that's not considering one of the most compelling parts of this company, which is their acquisition of Galileo, a payment processor that is integrated with over 90% digital banks in North America and over 70 of the top 100 FinTech companies. So, even as more competitors enter the space, SOFI stands to benefit from that.\n\nNot to mention their management team is stacked with talent. What really sealed the deal for me was the vision of CEO Anthony Noto. In a recent interview, Noto states that the reason SOFI hasn't gone international, despite the interest, is that they wanted to keep refining the product and make sure it can suit the user as best as it can before expanding overseas. This is a CEO that really cares about what they're building and the people who use it.\n\nThere's a lot of tailwinds for this company, and even if the fed does increase interest rates in 2022/23, they only stand to benefit.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**DKNG**\n\nThis position hinges on political policy, but I'm optimistic about it given how smooth the process of legalizing online betting in the US has been so far. The balance sheet may not be the cleanest, but companies like these typically spend a lot upfront in the form of CACs, and they've done an amazing job in that regard at making this company a household brand. Q1 2021 reports that monthly unique payers (MUPs) increased 114% yoy.\n\nThere's so much growth ahead in the short and long term. Over half the country has legalized betting (in some shape) in 3 years. The gambling market size is predicted to undergo hyper-growth in the next 10 years. Furthermore, DKNG has expressed interest in the esports scene, which is also something that has and will see explosive growth.\n\nWith that all said, I don't think the stock is cheap, and there are definitely a lot of risks here, but I believe in what they've done so far and can see a lot of upside in the long term.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**ABBV**\n\nI was between this and BMY, and I might end up just going 50/50 in both. Great fundamentals, a lot to like. Strong top-line revenue growth yoy and a lot of free cash flow. Share buybacks every year, except for the most recent when they issued shares to raise money for their acquisition. There's some concern that HUMIRA, their most popular drug which makes up about 50% of their revenue, has its exclusivity period ending 2023, but their recent acquisition of Allergen positions them well for the future. ABBV is certainly not a crazy hypergrowth stock, but they still have room for growth and their dividend is king. Especially now, when it's trading at a very reasonable valuation, it's a great time to buy in.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**BABA**\n\nI'm sure this stock needs no explanation on this sub. I really think this stock, or the likes of TENCHY, belongs in every portfolio that's focused on long-term growth at a reasonable price. So unless you're extremely against Chinese companies and the risk they may present, this is an absolute steal at these prices. In fact, right now most U.S companies are overvalued whereas almost every Chinese stock is undervalued.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**COIN**\n\nI stayed far away from buying into this company when it IPO'd. Now it has fallen to a pretty reasonable valuation, so I decided to start a small position. I hold a small crypto portfolio myself and although I don't think crypto will replace fiat money, I still see a lot of potential in it long term for a variety of uses. If you don't believe in crypto at all, then it's a lot harder to justify buying into this company.\n\nCOIN itself is one of the most popular crypto exchanges and they posted blistering numbers in their 2021 Q1 report. Granted, a lot of that was tied to the initial explosion of crypto in mainstream media, but the conservative projections for the full year of 2021 are still great. Crypto is still in its infancy in terms of mainstream support and use and the potential TAM is massive.\n\nThat said in the short term, there will be a lot of volatility with this stock. That's why I'm starting with a very small position, with the intention to add if the numbers and guidance continue to impress. Bear cases made of COIN usually rests on the fact that there is nothing proprietary about COIN or that they depend too heavily on transaction fees, which I fully acknowledge, but they have the name recognition and the biggest userbase, and it'll be up to their management team to make the right moves and continue to innovate. I'm still learning about the crypto space, but there's a lot more than just a means of exchange.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**CLF**\n\nAmerican steel. Steel futures have been unstoppable lately, with the re-opening and word that an infrastructure deal is in the works, there's a lot to like about steel. News of China pulling back from steel exports also allows American steel to be more competitive in the marketplace. Yet, despite all these catalysts, the prices of companies like CLF are still lagging behind. This is not your typical growth play, and I personally see this as a short-term (6-12 months) position, due to steel's cyclical nature. I'll also admit I got into this a few months before when CLF was sitting at 18 a share. Still, CLF is poised to gain a lot, and quite a lot to like about this company. The management team under Lourenco Goncalves has revitalized CLF, making big acquisitions of AK Steel and ArcelorMittal USA. He's also recently gone and raised Q2 2021 guidance, and there's reason to believe that even that was conservative for how hot the industry is currently. \n\nIf you're interested in learning more about the thesis behind steel, I'd suggest checking out r/Vitards. Anyways, I don't know if I'm going to hold this position for say 10+ years, so I'll be looking to capitalize on some short-term gains and use those profits to either open up a new position or fuel my current investments.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TDOC**\n\nThis is also a very speculative position, similar to COIN. After the major pullback, I believe TDOC is at a very fair evaluation. Despite posting another quarter without profit, there's a lot to like about this company. They have one of the highest NPS scores, significantly greater than AMZN and APPL, which is something that's very compelling and which is something the balance sheet doesn't reflect. Combine that with the fact that they have captured a big chunk of the market, with healthcare professionals and big institutions, makes the company very, very sticky. Even if it only is the \"Zoom for healthcare,\" the quality is strong enough that users won't just drop it for just any other substitute. \n\nBut it's not just the \"Zoom for healthcare\". The acquisitions it has made, both BetterHelp and Livongo, have amazing implications and have yet to show their full potential on TDOC's balance sheet. There's still so much of the healthcare space that can be innovated, and TDOC is primed to take over.\n\nFor right now, I'm OK with TDOC being unprofitable even with the pandemic pushing it along so well. That tells me they're funneling their revenue back into research and development to continue to build up its services and revenue streams.\n\nI also believe that telehealth is still in its infancy, and even though it was massively adopted during COVID, that only accelerates its long-term use and adoption by a little bit. It's going to take a while before it becomes sophisticated enough for people to see the value. This is a long-term play to which I will be consistently adding.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**BARK**\n\nBarkbox features in delivering monthly care packages for dogs on a subscription basis. This is something that's not as hyped as EVs, but pet care is a fast-growing market that sees more spending each year. In fact, quarantine boosted the number of pet owners in the US dramatically. Barkbox has seen tremendous yoy growth in revenue and subscriptions, with a CAGR, gross margins, and a returning customer rate that beats the industry leader CHWY as well as other popular brands. BARK has made a lot of partnerships with the likes of AMZN, WMT, TGT, etc., and looks to continue to expand vertically in the space of dog hygiene/medicine/food. All of this while trading at a much lower multiple than the other big pet care brands. \n\nThe management team is fantastic. Manish Joneja, CEO of BARK, has 2 decades of experience as director of Amazon global exports and expansion and 5+ years on eBay as product lead. Carly Strife and Henrik Werdelin have been featured in Forbes 30 under 30 and Top 100 Most Creative/Top 100 people in tech, respectively. \n\nThe bear case of this company is that they have no moat, but their customer retention speaks a lot to brand loyalty and satisfaction. CHWY also has a box subscription service for dogs, however, it's nowhere close to as popular as BARK. BARK is also expanding internationally, starting first with Australia.\n\nWill it get to where CHWY is? That part isn't clear and it depends on how well BARK is able to build on what it has and expand what it has to offer. But the stock has a lot of room to run given the current valuation, and the product is sticky enough to either allow them to succeed or be a target for an acquisition. \n\n\\-\n\nI want to get into a genomics stock but I haven't read up enough to be confident in opening a position yet. I think I'd either go with ARKG, or the likes of CRSP/BEAM/XTG. \n\nI have my eye on a couple of companies that I would love to get into for the right price. However, they are currently way too overvalued for my liking. \n\n* CRWD/NET/S (Cybersecurity in general)\n* ABNB\n* PINS\n* DUOL (IPO set for 2021)\n* AI/PATH\n* CRM\n* ETSY\n* PYPL/SQ\n* PTON\n* EVs (TSLA/Nio/etc.)\n* STEM\n* FIGS",

        "selftext": "I feel like this earnings season is a great time to compile a list of reasons why a stock can drop after an earnings report and also how you can use this knowledge to decide for yourself if the dip is a good buying opportunity or if it's time to jump ship. I'll start us off, but comment below if I missed anything!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**1.**  **Financials Missed Estimates**\n\nThis is what most people look for in the earnings report first, and what headlines news articles. Did revenue grow, did EPS beat, etc. However, in this day and age, I'd argue this does not matter as much compared to some of the other metrics below, especially for growth stocks. Sure, a big miss will result in the stock tanking, but a slight miss, meeting expectations, or slight beat will not really move the stock all by itself. Sometimes, even a big beat in financials won't necessarily outweigh the impact of the other metrics. \n\n* Before making a decision to buy/sell, ask yourself: \"Do the financials of this quarter change my overall thesis in any way?\" \"Is the miss in financials something temporary (i.e maybe acquisition costs) or is there a worrying trend?\" \"Is the miss in financials something that is out of the company's control (i.e pandemics, natural disasters, etc.)?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**2. A Miss Elsewhere**\n\nThis includes anything outside of pure financials and sometimes outweighs the impact of the company's balance sheet. For example, social media companies rely heavily on growth of MAUs in line or above expectations. Production can be slowed due to shortages or other reasons, which investors see as threatening to the profitability of the company in the near/long term.\n\n* Before making a decision to buy/sell, ask yourself: \"Is this something that's temporary or that will continue to be a problem?\" \"Does this change my overall thesis in any way?\"\n\n \n\n**3. Earnings are Priced In**\n\nSay it with me everyone: \"everything is priced in.\" On a more serious note, a lot of companies are priced for perfection, so even a nice beat on every metric may not move the price that much, because it's expected to do so. However, a miss on anything can result in investors selling out of a rich valuation to take profits and waiting for a more reasonable entry. It's a nice reminder that fundamental analysis does matter even in an extreme bull market.\n\n* Before making a decision to buy/sell, ask yourself: \"Is my future valuation of this company still the same?\" \"If not, is it still reasonable enough to justify holding/buying more?\" \"Is the new price attractive enough for me to buy?\" \"How long do I plan to hold this stock for, and is there a better opportunity to grow my money elsewhere?\" \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**3. Sector Influences &amp; Competition**\n\nThis includes more macro movements of the stock market. Is it in a cyclical industry? Is there positive momentum for the stock? Other similar company earnings can impact the way investors feel about the stock before its earnings. This can lead to overly high expectations, and result in overall disappointment if the company does not report as well as its competitors. Significant events can also play a role in the overall sentiment of the earnings report. For example, eBay moving away from PayPal transactions greatly hurt investor sentiment for the future financials of the company. \n\n* Before making a decision to buy/sell, ask yourself: \"Did the company's competitive advantage weaken?\" \"Will the events that transpired hurt the company in the long term?\"   \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**4. Poor Guidance**\n\nThis is probably the most important factor. The stock market is priced for the future. If the company can't provide guidance of continued growth in metrics that are most important to their success, or if their predicted growth is too slow for the consensus of analysts and investors - this will greatly tank the stock price. This ties into point 3, where the sentiments of overall valuation change. Sometimes, CEOs have a history of sandbagging their guidance; it would be wise to keep this in consideration when judging the outcome of earnings.\n\n* Before making a decision to buy/sell, ask yourself: \"Is the guidance reasonable? Is leadership sandbagging or is the guidance too optimistic?\" \"Does the guidance change my overall thesis, are people overreacting?\"   \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**5. Changes in Philosophy and Leadership**\n\nWhen leadership changes, the transition can be rocky for the short term, or it can drastically change the mission of the company. This can also mean poor allocation of capital, poor guidance, etc. \n\n* Before making a decision to buy/sell, ask yourself: \"Will the new leadership change anything?\" \"Is this change temporary?\" \"Is this change something that I think will help or hurt the company?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**6. Market Headlines and Trends**\n\nThis would be anything related to broad market changes, like interest rates, a market shift to lower-risk investments, world news, etc.\n\n* Before making a decision to buy/sell, ask yourself: \"Does this hurt the company in the long term?\"",

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, July 22, 2021**\n\nStocks edged higher today in a very volatile session, with the three main indexes (S&amp;P 500 (SPY), Nasdaq (QQQ), Dow Jones (DIA) falling at open before reversing to the upside mid-session, a sign that market participants remain eager to buy up any dip. On the other hand, the Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, broke its two day rally, trading 1.75% lower at the time of writing. Market participants continue to weight a variety of factors, including but not limited to: (1) faster-than-expected pace of economic recovery, (2) surging corporate earnings, (3) potential inflationary pressures, (4) labor market imbalances, and (5) concerns surrounding the coronavirus delta variant. Basically, the market is balancing between expectations for rapid economic expansion moving forward and concerns surrounding inflation and the delta variant.\n\nToday, the Labor Department released the Weekly Unemployment report, which unfortunately, showed an unexpected rise in new jobless claims filed. New jobless claims jumped to 419,000, well above consensus estimates of 360,000 and a sharp jump from the previous week, which showed pandemic-era lows in claims filed. Since the beginning of the pandemic, market participants have closely tracked these numbers in order to gauge the health of the labor market. However, with rising infections threatening to trigger new restrictions, labor market reports have taken on more importance than usual.\n\nIn the US, despite roughly 50% of the population being vaccinated, in the past two weeks, infections across the country have roughly doubled, with cases jumping from 13,200 on July 4 to 32,300 on July 18, according to data compiled by John Hopkins University. However, as I said yesterday, it is important to understand that the rising infections are broadly concentrated in areas with higher vaccine hesitancy. According to data from the CDC, 97% of people who have died or been hospitalized with COVID-19 since the vaccine became widely available are unvaccinated. Dr Rochelle Walensky, Director of CDC said of the rising cases, \u201cThere is a clear message that is coming through. This is becoming a pandemic of the unvaccinated. Our biggest concern is we are going to continue to see preventable cases, hospitalizations, and sadly deaths among the unvaccinated.\u201d Sadly, despite the widespread availability of the vaccine in the US, hesitancy in certain places remains very high.\n\nIn other news, Q2 earnings season continues full steam ahead, with the quarter shaping up to be another record-setting one. Earnings are expected to be super-charged by higher than expected demand from savings-laden consumers as the economy reopens. While concerns around the delta variant have put a damper on sentiment, reports by companies have not reflected any slowdown in growth. So far, analysts are looking for S&amp;P 500 earnings to grow by 61.9% year-on-year in aggregate, according to FactSet data \u2013 an estimate UBS's Head of Equity Derivatives Research Stuart Kaiser said may still be \"need to be revised higher.\" \n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Shares of Twitter (TWTR) skyrocketed after-hours after the company reported better than expected earnings and raised guidance moving forward.\n* Shares of Domino\u2019s Pizza (DPZ) skyrocketed after smashing earnings estimates and announcing a new share buyback program\n* US Senators introduced a bill that would amend Section 230, the well-known law that gives social media companies immunity from what users post on their platform, to hold companies liable for health-related misinformation.\n* Websites of several airlines, banks and technology companies, including Amazon's AWS, Delta Air Lines (DAL) and American Express (AXP), were facing outages, according to DownDetector.

On Trend Spider you can also run the seasonality data over the past 10, 20, 30 or more years to really get a feel for how to format your investing strategy. We can also look at certain sectors:  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9khbxxqsa2d71.png?width=475&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0cffdc3d49a1183633eacd36b6cb55e14517e933\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/w3pwmi7ta2d71.png?width=484&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=99373f0f993c1f45fab6eed78af9b8347eb9ee88\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/aw0ex6rta2d71.png?width=498&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2f3ed555bcd32e32c83019622c8c47c485e00036\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/30qbao9ua2d71.png?width=483&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=87b7969b90e0eb47b8a09a581660350917843cc0\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0x47dnqua2d71.png?width=490&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=394117c62c81c7a45fb80d6f65fc90ffdac9a0cd\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rtikmg7va2d71.png?width=475&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e277ba82da3b15072d0621b8d7326f533c091aac\n\n \n\nTech (XLK), Retail (XRT), Financials (XLF) and Real Estate (XLRE) also cool down after a hot summer, yet Materials (XLB) and Semiconductors (SMH) consolidate a little, but not as much.

I am getting ready to take profits on longer term positions and move somethings around in preparation for a bigger dip in September or August that I've been writing about for some time now. July is traditionally the best month, as it is this year too. Data is powerful, and I would not be surprised at all if the same thing happens this years. Some interesting plays that I recommended before to park capital in after taking profit from your sectors that will be rotated out of, could be: **$X, $SCHD, $XHB, $DG** however, there are a lot more. It will depend on your own investigating and thoughts as to which is the bet fit for you.  \n\nMaybe **$BTI, British American Tobacco,** could be a perfect fit for you. I just wrote a detailed 8 page research report that I did on this highly undervalued stock.  (It's a PDF file, but I can issue a free copy to anyone that asks)\n\nOverall, even though the markets will most likely pull back in the upcoming months, I don't think there is any need to panic; no crash is coming. Sector rotations are a sign of a healthy markets plus the 10 year treasury bond is under 1.3% currently. Even if you just sat on your hands in a long term buy and hold portfolio, like most do, it will be find as the markets start heating up going into the holiday seasons. Let's consider what sectors and companies do well during the holiday season and we then can know what we should buy next.  \n\nWe will be discussing this more later on, but let's not get ahead of ourselves to much. *After all, the stock market is only a tool to transfer wealth from the impatient to the patient.*  \n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n^(Disclaimer: The comments opinions and analysis expressed herein are for informational and educational purpose only and should not be considered as individual advice or recommendations.)",

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, July 20, 2021**\n\nToday, the market pulled a remarkable reversal and clawed back most of the losses from yesterday, one of the worst days for the three major indexes all year. Despite fears surrounding the coronavirus delta variant and potential inflationary pressures, the volume of buys going into the major indexes yesterday suggest market participants remain unperturbed and eager to buy up any significant dips in the market. If anything, today teaches us not to succumb too quickly to fear, uncertainty, and doubt. Today reinforces the remarkable strength of the markets in the US. Potential risks will always be present in the market, and one always has to be prepared to act in case of a downturn, but one shouldn\u2019t make decisions based on fear. We have seen dips like this in the past before the year, yet the three main indexes continue their monster uptrend. The Russell 2000 (IWM) broke it\u2019s downtrend and outperformed, climbing roughly 3% today. In other news, Q2 earnings season continues and is shaping up to be another record breaking quarter.\n\nYesterday, it seems fears surrounding the coronavirus delta variant came to a head, with LA county reinstating its mask mandate and the Japanese government reportedly discussing potentially cancelling the Olympics after a slew of infections among athletes and staff. In the US, despite roughly 50% of the population being vaccinated, in the past two weeks, infections across the country have roughly doubled, with cases jumping from 13,200 on July 4 to 32,300 on July 18, according to data compiled by John Hopkins University. However, as I said yesterday, it is important to understand that the rising infections are broadly concentrated in areas with higher vaccine hesitancy. According to data from the CDC, 97% of people who have died or been hospitalized with COVID-19 since the vaccine became widely available are unvaccinated. Dr Rochelle Walensky, Director of CDC said of the rising cases, \u201cThere is a clear message that is coming through. This is becoming a pandemic of the unvaccinated. Our biggest concern is we are going to continue to see preventable cases, hospitalizations, and sadly deaths among the unvaccinated.\u201d Sadly, despite the widespread availability of the vaccine in the US, hesitancy in certain places remains very high.\n\nIn Japan, things are going from bad to worse with the Olympics. Despite reinstating a state of emergency and banning spectators from attending the events, the games have so far been beset by a slew of infections by both staffers and athletes. Today, the head Tokyo Olympics Committee did not rule out the potential for the games to still be cancelled last minute.\n\nLike I said yesterday, it\u2019s unclear how the situation will play out, but I continue to urge market participants not to panic just yet. While the rising cases are concerning and very unfortunate, on the positive side, the current vaccines have so far proven effective against the delta variant and countries around the world are quickly ramping up their vaccination efforts. But as always, one has to acknowledge the risks that are present in the market. \n\nQ2 earnings season is shaping up to another record-setting quarter, similar to Q1 of this year. So far, analysts are looking for S&amp;P 500 earnings to grow by 61.9% year-on-year in aggregate, according to FactSet data \u2013 an estimate UBS's Head of Equity Derivatives Research Stuart Kaiser said may still be \"need to be revised higher.\" \n\nA big part of the strong Q2 earnings growth is easy comparisons to the year-earlier period that represented the bottom of the Covid-19 earnings impact. But Q2 estimates also reflect genuine growth, with total index earnings expected to be up +8.8% compared to the pre-Covid 2019 Q2 period. In other words, even when compared to an earnings season 2 years ago, well before the coronavirus pandemic, this earnings season is expected to show very strong growth. Estimates for Q2 and beyond have been steadily going up, with the current +60.5% earnings growth rate up from +50.6% at the end of March and +41.6% at the start of January 2021.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield continued its steady decline, 1.20% at the time of writing\n* Robinhood (HOOD), popular broker and one of the most awaited IPOs, is set to go public on July 29 with a roughly $35 billion valuation.

Yesterday was \"Why the increase after hours?\" and today is \"Why the drop?\" Can't say for sure, definitely some profit taking going on. Growing number of puts in the OI. I would imagine the call volume on the higher strikes is calls being sold to take advantage of elevated premiums, however, there were large market sweep orders at the $18 call strike. Call volumes obliterated put volumes, will be interesting to see with tomorrow's OI numbers (they only get updated once per day, in the morning before the market opens, there's no such thing as live OI data) if IV drops on the calls, which would signify selling or positions being closed out. As of this morning, 137K calls in OI vs 64K puts. Yesterday in this post I discussed the use of stop losses to ensure that at least a minimum of gains is captured. If your position is still positive, it would be prudent to do so. Remember, just as gamma can ramp share prices up swiftly, it can unwind the share price just as fast. I know I sound annoyingly pessimistic, I just don't want to see people lose out on profit unnecessarily.\n\n\\- **UXIN** \\- nice gap up the day before earnings, signs of good news? I'm still super skeptical with China stocks.\n\n\\- **TELL** \\- nice pop on news of finalizing an agreement to sell liquid natural gas to Shell. \n\n\\- **SGLB** \\- good sized gap up today from ~~Ligma~~ Sigma Labs, with nearly all of the volume at the $5 strike for August. Low, low revenue numbers from earnings last week, but the company has cash in hand after two offerings and warrant exercises.\n\n\\- **SWN** \\- SWN reported earnings and fell a bit. This company has $3 billion in total debt! Yikes. That's almost their market cap. No update to forward guidance. For an earnings drop, less than 7% isn't *that* bad. Option activity seems to be algos and sweeps picking up discounted options.\n\n\\- **INFI** \\- small give back in the price today after yesterday's monster gain after the day before that's nosedive. This stock would make a great roller coaster. \n\n\\- **ABUS** \\- small drop saw big money scooping up options on the cheap. Boring, I know.\n\n\\- **IGC** \\- finished lower than yesterday's small bounce back. Call option numbers still rising in OI, but put percentage up over 250% in the last 5 trading days.\n\n\\- **ABEV** \\- high volume on call options were mostly just outright buys. Bullish.\n\n\\- **GSS** \\- Big 25% gain after releasing relatively poor earnings. Production fell 25%, costs were flat, 15% decline in revenue and EPS fell by 50%. BUT the company has enough cash on hand to pay off some huge debt, which should really help the balance sheet.\n\n\\- **BCEL** \\- announced clinical trial results that seemed fine...and the stock dropped over 40%. Big buy orders for cheap calls.\n\n\\- **LODE** \\- minor share gain on acquisition news. One entity loaded the boats with well over 3,000 calls.\n\n\\- **PFMT** \\- this stock has been laddering up since early July. Analysts think PFMT is about the breakeven on earnings soon. The small rise must have caught some algo's eye.\n\n\\- **ARDX** \\- after a minor loss on the day, this stock is up a couple percent after hours. Yesterday had me wondering if this stock has found it's floor. I would need to look at the chart, but the fact that it's no longer free falling is a positive sign of at least stability. \n\n\\- **APRN** \\- nearly 9% daily gain after announcing a new box with Partnership for a Healthier America. I'm all for people eating better and learning to cook but wowzers is Blue Apron so much more than just going grocery shopping. The January 2023 $22 call is a bit of a stretch, IMO.\n\n\\- **ABIO** \\- nice gain the day after announcing some phase 2 results. Tutes buying in? You would think the big gain would come the day of the announcement. \n\n\\- **BTCM** \\- little pullback today after a gaining 16% yesterday. Folks taking profits.\n\n\\- **ELYS** \\- nothing special besides an almost 4% share gain for the day. People do love to gamba tho.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI imagine this list will be much bigger tomorrow with weekly opex. Anyway, thx for reading, happy trading, and holler if you have any questions",

But here\u2019s the rub: Heretofore each downturn has been followed by the price of the coin recovering and then going on to greatly exceed its previous high.\n\nDoesn\u2019t that scream long term buy and hold? (Or trader bait if that\u2019s what floats your boat.) Shouldn\u2019t you therefore own a piece? Maybe just a little piece?\n\nHow do we know crypto will continue to go up? No one knows. Apple ([AAPL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL?p=AAPL&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch)), Tesla ([TSLA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA?p=TSLA&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch)) and Nvidia ([NVDA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NVDA?p=NVDA&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch)) seem like obvious bets now, but five or 10 years ago they looked risky, or overpriced or both. And with Bitcoin you add a whole other layer of uncertainty, which is to say crypto currency itself. Crypto is way more complex and speculative than iPhones or EVs or chips.\n\nI\u2019ll get into the issue of defining crypto later, but I want to be clear that what I\u2019m really trying to address here is, should you have some exposure to crypto in your investment portfolio, and if so, what kind and how much?\n\nThat question comes from this fact: It\u2019s entirely possible the only thing riskier than owning crypto, is not owning crypto. Meaning that 50 years from now, your grandchildren might shake their heads in disgust for you not buying Bitcoin at $32,000, (or $25,000 next week.)\n\nA dilemma, no?\n\nLet me briefly address the word \"new\" in my lead, which I used because for the past 25 years, I've called tech the trade of our lifetime. Just like with what we\u2019ve seen so far with crypto, tech stocks would go up and would go down, but they would always go higher. The chart for the NASDAQ 100 Technology Sector ([\\^NDXT](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5ENDXT?p=^NDXT&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch)) goes from bottom left to top right. And it makes sense, doesn\u2019t it, as tech becomes a bigger and bigger part of our economy.\n\nAnd now? Well, I\u2019m not saying tech is finished by any means, but it could be that after two and a half decades, the sweetest part of that trade has run its course, especially for the big FAAN/MG (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Microsoft, Google) names. Two strong winds now blow in the faces of those companies.\n\nThe first is the tyranny of large numbers, meaning it becomes increasingly difficult for a company to grow 30% a year when its annual revenue is closing in on $200 billion (as is the case with Google, which also sports a market valuation of $1.7 trillion.) How can a company sustain that and how much bigger can it grow? The second wind is potential government regulation addressing the massive market power of these giants, (though breaking up these companies may be a boon to shareholders and consumers.) And of course these two headwinds are intertwined.\n\nA segue back to crypto. I know it seems like all you hear these days is \"Bitcoin, Bitcoin Bitcoin,\" right? Celebrities, CEOs, and heads of state are either investing in it, setting up endeavors or commenting on it. But here\u2019s the thing, the total value of all Bitcoins right now is $605 billion, or about half of a single FAAN/MG. That also equals only about 1.7% of the world's supply of money (and about 5.3% of the world's gold supply, according to Investopedia.)\n\nIn fact all crypto coins combined now account for less than 5% of the world's money supply. Imagine the hype if crypto gets to be equal to 25% or 50% of what they call fiat (or traditional) currency. So maybe crypto has room to grow. On the other hand [tulip bulbs were worth a bunch too, back in the day.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulip_mania#/media/File:Tulip_price_index1.svg)\n\nWhat exactly is cryptocurrency? (Forgive me if this part is familiar.) Crypto is a type of digital, usually non-government issued, currency that is encrypted, which protects it from being counterfeited. (So-called stablecoins are crypto pegged to traditional currency like the dollar.)\n\nThese currencies exist on distributed computer networks which use blockchain technology, a special kind of database really, which creates a permanent record of transactions that can be viewed by all.\n\n[Bitcoin](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BTC-USD?p=BTC-USD), launched in 2009 by someone or some people under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto, is the king of the coins, but there are thousands of them, [(Yahoo Finance tracks over 300)](https://finance.yahoo.com/cryptocurrencies), including biggies like [Ethereum](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ETH-USD?p=ETH-USD), used for instance to buy and sell NFTs (non fungible tokens, [which I wrote about here](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/69-million-reasons-why-you-should-care-about-nf-ts-121858223.html)), [Ripple, or XRP](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/XRP-USD?p=XRP-USD), which is used for banking transactions and the infamous [Dogecoin](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/DOGE-USD?p=DOGE-USD), a satirical coin (replete with its Shiba Inu dog meme), which has a very no joke market value of $25 billion.\n\nYes, it's kind of crazy. Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger don\u2019t like crypto. Munger calls it \u201crat poison\u201d and says it aids and abets criminals. That certainly has been true (along with all the legit use), but it ignores the obvious point that a vast majority of all the crime in the world is facilitated by traditional currencies and systems, (Exhibit A: [The FinCEN Files investigations. ](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/jasonleopold/fincen-files-financial-scandal-criminal-networks)Crypto is never mentioned here. JPMorgan, HSBC and Deutsche Bank and dollars are often.) It\u2019s still very much the case that the $100 bill is the criminal\u2019s currency and denomination of choice.\n\nOthers point to additional issues with Bitcoin. Elon Musk for instance, generally a crypto bull, helped juice the run-up in Bitcoin earlier this year when Tesla announced it would accept Bitcoin as payment. But Musk then created a crypto downdraft in May when he suspended that program due to environmental concerns, as creating Bitcoin, (or mining), requires copious amounts of energy consumption. (Musk said this week he will reconsider as mining processes improve.)\n\nOthers note Bitcoin isn\u2019t actually accomplishing what many hoped it would do. \u201cBitcoin was designed as a digitally anonymous medium of exchange that did not involve a trusted third party, such as a central bank, but Bitcoin has failed abjectly at its stated objective,\u201d says Eswar Prasad, a professor at Cornell University and author of a forthcoming book called, \"The Future of Money: How the Digital Revolution Is Transforming Currencies and Finance.\"\u00a0\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very volatile currency in terms of value, so it is not a reliable medium of exchange. Moreover, it\u2019s slow, expensive, and cumbersome to use,\" he said. \"Despite a lack of intrinsic value, Bitcoin began to be adopted mainly as a speculative asset.\u201d\n\nRic Edelman, executive chairman of Edelman Financial Engine, doesn\u2019t necessarily disagree but says \u201cwhere bitcoin is not succeeding as a digital currency it is succeeding as a digital asset.\u201d Furthermore Musk and others believe that entrepreneurs will build \u201clayers\u201d on top of Bitcoin that will render it more utility.\n\nMainstream bankers like Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase, have also mostly been critical, though Dimon\u2019s view is evolving. Initially he savaged crypto, but said that blockchain technology was legit (a common stance by mainstream financial folks), and green lit blockchain projects at the bank. Then in congressional testimony to the U.S. House Financial Services Committee in late May, he [said he wouldn\u2019t steer clients away from crypto.](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jp-morgans-jamie-dimon-buyer-beware-on-cryptocurrencies-200700048.html)\n\n*\u201cMy own personal advice to people is: stay away from it. That does not mean the clients don't want it,\u201d Dimon said. \u201cThis goes back to how you have to run a business. I don't smoke marijuana but if you make it nationally legal, I'm not going to stop our people from banking it.\"*\n\nJust this week, [JPMorgan became the major bank to give its customers access to crypto funds.](https://www.businessinsider.com/jpmorgan-financial-advisors-crypto-bitcoin-products-retail-wealth-management-2021-7)\n\nI tend to think that Bitcoin and its ilk are to money what the internet is to information \u2014 a digital, low cost, less fettered variation. As such, cryptocurrency and blockchain are a parallel universe to the legacy world of finance, soon to mirror every facet of what came before and perhaps one day to subsume it. What does that mean for JPMorgan, the Fed, the NYSE and the dollar? Lots, though who knows what exactly. It may not kill any of them though. For instance, all those newfangled mobile payment businesses like PayPal and Square haven\u2019t slowed Visa and Mastercard much.\n\nThen there\u2019s regulation. At some point lawmakers will wrap their brains around crypto, but they haven\u2019t yet. \u201cRight now we\u2019re past the wild west phase where we were living in a fairly unregulated environment. We\u2019re in what I would characterize as an awkward phase,\u201d says Daniel Tramel Stabile, a partner in the Miami office of Shutts &amp; Bowen LLP\u200b\u200b and a professor at University of Miami Law School, who specializes in legal issues surrounding digital assets. \u201cI think in the long run regulation will be a very positive thing for the industry as it continues to mature.\u201d\n\nI could write a zillion more paragraphs about crypto, it touches every corner of our lives now and there are a flood of news stories every day, but I\u2019m going to leave it at that. Except to refer you to a pretty incredible, somewhat under-the-radar conversation[ at The B-Word Conference ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTESiH2zPB8)this week between Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, Jack Dorsey, CEO of Twitter ([TWTR](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TWTR?p=TWTR&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch)) and Square ([SQ](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SQ?p=SQ&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch)), and Cathie Wood, head of ARK Invest, entitled \u201cDemystifying Bitcoin.\u201d It really bears watching but here are a few choice nuggets salient to this story.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve thought about money for quite a while,\u201d says Musk. \u201cI especially think about money as an information system. It makes sense to support something that improves the quality of information with which we conduct the economy. Bitcoin is a candidate for that.\"\n\n\u201cMy hope for crypto in general is that it can improve the efficiency of the information that we call money. So if the core efficiency of money is improved and money has less error, error as in any kind of government interference or fraud. This will lead to a better standard of living and more power to the individual, which I very much agree with.\u201d\n\nDorsey said he likes crypto because of \u201cthe network and the community. It\u2019s deeply principled, it\u2019s weird as hell, it\u2019s always evolving. It just reminded me of the internet when I was a kid. The amount of cost and distraction that comes from our monetary system today is real and it takes away attention from the bigger problems.\u201d\n\nCathie Wood sees crypto as \u201csolving even more problems but also creating even more opportunities as well, which is the history of technology and disruptive innovation.\u201d\n\nSome visionary advocates there, all three of whom are oh-so-familiar with wild swings in valuation. Speaking of which, the price action of Bitcoin has not been for the faint of heart. From October 2013 to April 2014, for instance, BTC went from $100 to $1,000 and back to $400. But that\u2019s ancient history. In 2017, BTC went from $900 in March to (famously) almost $20,000 in December, and then down to $3,500 a year later. And now over the past 12 months or so, Bitcoin went from $5,000 to $60,000 and now halved again.\n\nDespite that, or really because of that, more and more want to take the plunge. A new survey by Goldman Sachs \u201cfound that n[early half the family offices it does business with want to add digital currencies](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-21/bitcoin-btc-where-rich-family-offices-are-investing-goldman-survey-shows?sref=eeq6exxF) to their stable of investments.\u201d Billionaire Interactive Brokers founder Thomas Peterffy, who\u2019s been critical of crypto previously, [told CNBC this week ](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/21/thomas-peterffy-says-he-owns-some-cryptocurrency-because-you-have-to-play-the-odds.html)that \u201cEven I myself have put a little bit of money into crypto, because even though chances are, I think, that this is not going to be a viable market, I think that there\u2019s a small chance that this will be a dominant currency, so you have to play the odds.\u201d\n\nIn fact crypto has already minted a new crop of billionaires and centimillionaires, like Sam Bankman-Fried, who [Forbes estimates ](https://www.forbes.com/sites/ninabambysheva/2021/07/20/bitcoin-exchange-led-by-worlds-richest-crypto-billionaire-raises-record-900-million/?sh=59f135eb4e33)is worth \u201c$16.2 billion, thus cementing his title of the wealthiest known crypto billionaire.\u201d[ Bankman-Fried is building FTX, ](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/crypto-billionaire-bankman-fried-explains-whats-next-for-bitcoin-103739653.html)a new crypto derivatives exchange which just did a $900 million private equity funding, the biggest in PE history. (Funny I don\u2019t see any crypto billionaires popping up on [Bloomberg\u2019s Billionaires List.](https://www.bloomberg.com/billionaires/?sref=eeq6exxF)..yet.)\n\nWe checked in with Eric Jansen, founder and CIO of investment management firm Finivi, and asked him for his crypto investing thesis. \u201cIt\u2019s an alternative investment that doesn't seem to be correlated with the stock market,\u201d he says. \u201cThe holy grail of investing is to have a basket of investments that don\u2019t react the same way to events\u2014interest rates going up or down or the stock market up or down. You could potentially be in a scenario where crypto markets are doing well and the stock market is not. It could be like the early days of the internet,\" Jansen says. \u201cYou have to expect Pets.com type stocks that go to zero, the same in crypto world, but there are going to be Amazons, Google and Facebooks that eventually come out of it.\"\n\n\u201cMoney is becoming a form of expression,\u201d Jansen continues. \u201cIn the U.S. I use dollars, in China I use the yuan. I believe in Dogecoin, buy stuff in Doge, believe in Dash, I\u2019ll buy in Dash. You\u2019ll use cryptocurrency because it defines you. That\u2019s where currency is going. Not country by country but more individualistic.\u201d\n\nWell that\u2019s different.\n\n\u201cI began highly skeptical, thinking it was a very dubious proposition that this was legitimate,\u201d says Ric Edelman. \u201cThe more I learned, the more I discovered that this is a revolutionary technology that will change commerce on a global scale. I\u2019m confident anyone who goes through a similar exploration will reach a similar conclusion. Don\u2019t allow your biases or assumptions to prevent you from making investment decisions that you may regret.\u201d\n\nOK, if you\u2019re buying any of this then, well, how much do you buy?\n\n\u201cI generally advise investors to allocate 1% of the portfolio to digital assets because of the volatility and because of the price potential,\u201d says Edelman. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to have a significant allocation to have a material improvement in your portfolio. One percent is plenty. If it fails, it\u2019s only 1%. Won\u2019t cause financial harm. If it improves, as it has historically, it will deliver significant returns.\u201d\n\nSo where do you put this mad money? \u201cTwo choices,\u201d says Edelman. \u201cSimply stick with the largest, most established digital assets. That\u2019s Bitcoin and Ether. Together they comprise about 80% of the marketplace. It\u2019s like saying \u2018if you're going to invest in soft drinks, buy Coke and Pepsi.\u2019\u201d\u00a0\n\nOnce you [decide to take the plunge ](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/investing/how-to-invest-in-bitcoin)you then have to decide whether to buy coins directly from an exchange like CoinDesk or Gemini, (not so straightforward still), from a broker dealer like Robinhood, from a Bitcoin ATM (true!), through futures, a peer-to-peer network or through a fund like Grayscale\u2019s GBTC at brokers like Fidelity, Schwab or E-Trade. (The latter is really the easiest.)\n\nBottom line: There\u2019s a whole (parallel) universe to explore here. Take it slow, be careful, learn and make up your own mind. Just know the whole thing could implode one day \u2014 or devour the world of money and finance as we know it. Or perhaps most likely, something in between.",

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, July 20, 2021**\n\nToday, the market pulled a remarkable reversal and clawed back most of the losses from yesterday, one of the worst days for the three major indexes all year. Despite fears surrounding the coronavirus delta variant and potential inflationary pressures, the volume of buys going into the major indexes yesterday suggest market participants remain unperturbed and eager to buy up any significant dips in the market. If anything, today teaches us not to succumb too quickly to fear, uncertainty, and doubt. Today reinforces the remarkable strength of the markets in the US. Potential risks will always be present in the market, and one always has to be prepared to act in case of a downturn, but one shouldn\u2019t make decisions based on fear. We have seen dips like this in the past before the year, yet the three main indexes continue their monster uptrend. The Russell 2000 (IWM) broke it\u2019s downtrend and outperformed, climbing roughly 3% today. In other news, Q2 earnings season continues and is shaping up to be another record breaking quarter.\n\nYesterday, it seems fears surrounding the coronavirus delta variant came to a head, with LA county reinstating its mask mandate and the Japanese government reportedly discussing potentially cancelling the Olympics after a slew of infections among athletes and staff. In the US, despite roughly 50% of the population being vaccinated, in the past two weeks, infections across the country have roughly doubled, with cases jumping from 13,200 on July 4 to 32,300 on July 18, according to data compiled by John Hopkins University. However, as I said yesterday, it is important to understand that the rising infections are broadly concentrated in areas with higher vaccine hesitancy. According to data from the CDC, 97% of people who have died or been hospitalized with COVID-19 since the vaccine became widely available are unvaccinated. Dr Rochelle Walensky, Director of CDC said of the rising cases, \u201cThere is a clear message that is coming through. This is becoming a pandemic of the unvaccinated. Our biggest concern is we are going to continue to see preventable cases, hospitalizations, and sadly deaths among the unvaccinated.\u201d Sadly, despite the widespread availability of the vaccine in the US, hesitancy in certain places remains very high.\n\nIn Japan, things are going from bad to worse with the Olympics. Despite reinstating a state of emergency and banning spectators from attending the events, the games have so far been beset by a slew of infections by both staffers and athletes. Today, the head Tokyo Olympics Committee did not rule out the potential for the games to still be cancelled last minute.\n\nLike I said yesterday, it\u2019s unclear how the situation will play out, but I continue to urge market participants not to panic just yet. While the rising cases are concerning and very unfortunate, on the positive side, the current vaccines have so far proven effective against the delta variant and countries around the world are quickly ramping up their vaccination efforts. But as always, one has to acknowledge the risks that are present in the market. \n\nQ2 earnings season is shaping up to another record-setting quarter, similar to Q1 of this year. So far, analysts are looking for S&amp;P 500 earnings to grow by 61.9% year-on-year in aggregate, according to FactSet data \u2013 an estimate UBS's Head of Equity Derivatives Research Stuart Kaiser said may still be \"need to be revised higher.\" \n\nA big part of the strong Q2 earnings growth is easy comparisons to the year-earlier period that represented the bottom of the Covid-19 earnings impact. But Q2 estimates also reflect genuine growth, with total index earnings expected to be up +8.8% compared to the pre-Covid 2019 Q2 period. In other words, even when compared to an earnings season 2 years ago, well before the coronavirus pandemic, this earnings season is expected to show very strong growth. Estimates for Q2 and beyond have been steadily going up, with the current +60.5% earnings growth rate up from +50.6% at the end of March and +41.6% at the start of January 2021.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield continued its steady decline, 1.20% at the time of writing\n* Robinhood (HOOD), popular broker and one of the most awaited IPOs, is set to go public on July 29 with a roughly $35 billion valuation. Personally, I wouldn\u2019t touch this with a 10-foot pole, too much baggage for my liking. But I have popcorn ready to see what happens\n* Today, Nvidia\u2019s (NVDA) 1:4 stock split went through, with the company now trading around $186\n* After a steep decline, oil stocks surged today\n* Ford Motors (F) issued three safety recalls affecting more than 800,000 in response to six injury allegations stemming from issues with the \u201crear suspension toe link which significantly diminishes steering control, increasing the risk of a crash.\u201d\n* Twitter (TWTR) and Square (SQ) CEO Jack Dorsey said SQ is launching a business dedicated to \u201cdecentralized financial services\u201d. Through Twitter Dorsey said the company is \u201cfocused on building an open developer platform with the sole goal of making it easy to create non-custodial, permissionless, and decentralized financial services.\u201d\n* \\*\\***Please note that current stock price was written premarket and may not reflect closing prices\\*\\***\n* Apple (AAPL) target raised by UBS Group from $155 to $166 at Buy. Stock currently around $146\n* Albemarle (ALB) target raised by Loop Capital from $199 to $208 at Buy. Stock currently around $187\n* John Deere (DE) target raised by Credit Suisse from $427 to $439 at Outperform. Stock currently around $348\n* Edward LifeSciences (EW) Target raised by SVB Leerink from $106 to $125 at Outperform. Stock currently around $107\n* Exelon (EXC) target raised by Morgan Stanley from $60 to $63 at Overweight. Stock currently around $46\n* Facebook (FB) target raised by Jefferies Financial from $385 to $400 at Buy. Stock currently around $342\n* Alphabet (GOOGL) target raised by Jefferies from $2850 to $2950 at Buy. Stock currently around $2526\n* Fortinet (FTNT) target raised by BTIG Research from $385 to $400 at Buy. Stock currently around $342\n* O\u2019Reilly Automotive (ORLY) target raised by Wells Fargo from $600 to $660 at Overweight. Stock currently around $608\n* Paypal (PYPL) target raised by Wells Fargo from $310 to $250 at Overweight. Stock currently around $298\n* Snapchat (SNAP) target raised by Credit Suisse from $80 to $90 at Outperform. Stock currently around $62\n\n\u201cEvery adversity, every failure, every heartache carries with it the seed of an equal or greater benefit.\u201d -  Napoleon Hill",

        "selftext": "Strange day on the market, yet somehow was still able to build on all time highs. It seems like investor confidence is there for the time being as we head into probably the most impactful week of earnings season. I'll update the calendar below as the week progresses and we'll see how the market reacts. \n\n Obligatory these aren't stock recommendations, this does not constitute financial advice - if you need that advice contact your broker, I'm just analyzing data, do your own DD, would you rather have cheeto fingers the rest of your life or have a popcorn kernel stuck in the back of your throat for the rest of your life , no position DD will return I just need some time, etc. etc. etc. \n\nEarnings Calendar (*now with updates!)*:\n\n Monday: Tesla (EPS +19.42%, Revenue +1.09%), Lockheed Martin (EPS -0.05%, Revenue +0.56%)\n\nTuesday: Apple, Microsoft, Google, Visa, UPS, Starbuck, Raytheon, 3M, AMD, GE\n\nWednesday: Facebook, Paypal, Pfizer, Qualcomm, Shopify\n\nThursday: Amazon, Mastercard\n\nFriday: Abbvie, Exxon, Chevron\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm still not sold, this feels like a bear trap to me.

After being up nearly 30% in premarket, SPRT ended the day with a 9% gain. Over 120K calls to over 47K puts in the OI. Today's volume saw 41K calls and 9K puts. Ton of action, ton of OI, volatile stock. Fun fun fun! OTM call action continues to force MMs to delta hedge. There was a wonderful post yesterday regarding the similarities between SPRT and ATOS as they approached monthly OPEX. If the stock or option activity slows down, MMs can begin to unwind their hedges. I've been asking this question the whole time: Is the merger priced in? Prudent traders would set stop losses to manage their risk. Don't buy the old \"the shorts are hunting stop losses\" BS. Manage YOUR risk. This isn't a team sport.\n\n**- EDU** \\-the decline continues for China education stocks. From the last edition of this post: \" It's not trading a discount, it's going down in flames. Let it find a bottom first.\" Elevated option activity generally increases implied volatility, which increases option prices. There's no rush here, as it still hasn't found a bottom.\n\n**- TAL** \\- See EDU above. \n\n\\- **TYME** \\- TYME had a monster day, rocketing nearly 30% after receiving a patent for their cancer treatment. This stock closed yesterday at $1.08 and at one point today was at $2 before retreating. The $1 puts were had dirt cheap and could prove worthwhile if the stock retreats tomorrow after the big gap-up.\n\n**- HUT** \\- crypto is on a run, so mining stocks took off today. A stock like this will be tied to the hip with the crypto market, so a return to Earth may be a little less likely than the big gappers can be. \n\n\\- **NXTD** \\- no real news, this micro cap just finally got some volume. Average volume is a smidge over 2 million shares traded - today that number was over 75 million. Will the trend continue? I suspect this will be another one of those big gainers that gives a little back the next day.\n\n\\- **BITF** \\- See HUT above. As crypto goes, so goes mining stocks.\n\n\\- **ATIP -** This stock sold off after disappointing Q2 results. What's crucial to understand about earnings is that it's not just the EPS and revenue that drives post-earnings price action. It's guidance - how the company expects to perform in the future. In this case, ATIP revised guidance downward, and investors revised ATIP's share price down as well. \n\n**- CEMI** \\- The selloff continues after blowing up earlier in the week. At least it seems to be slowing. \n\n\\- **IMV -** yuge gap-up day for IMV after receiving a price target upgrade yesterday. Will the run continue or is this too large of a gap to not sell off a bit tomorrow?\n\n\\- **ARDX** \\- I can actually just C&amp;P from the last one of these posts because it all still applies:  the stock price tumble continues. It seems to be slowing, but this stock still has not found bottom. Open interest continues to rise on call options, which is just goofy. High IV means people are overpaying for these options. Just wait for this to find bottom and calm down. If it has a dead cat bounce, don't rush in. \n\n\\- **BTCM** \\- See HUT and BITF above\n\n\\- **IGC** \\- IGC gave back even more today from Thursday's gain. I'll keep quoting myself until I'm wrong or option traders listen. From the last post:  are we seeing a pattern here yet? IGC was juiced to the tits on Thursday and came back to Earth on Friday. [I wrote about this company 4 months ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/mh9to5/no_position_dd_igc_dont_get_burned/). This stock rocketed off news of a patent for Alzheimer's treatment with THC. The company has been claiming this product would be on shelves since 2018! Their revenue is \\~$900K for fiscal 2021. Lots of red flags with this company. \n\n\\- **INFI** \\- looks the stock slipped ahead of its earnings report. Confident investors loaded up on discounted call options. It all depends on the earnings.\n\n\\- **ADVM** \\- after a huge loss Friday from one of their drugs sucking in a clinical trial, option traders appear willing to kick the tires. Here, I can admit I was wrong, because I thought this one would continue to drop.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHMU if you have any questions! I'll be writing earnings articles aaaaallllll night!",

        "selftext": " Hello I am trying to understand some tax implications.\n\nToday has been a great day as both big tech and mid-cap went flying and my pick up was. MRNA, PYPL, and DOCU, all of which I had reasonably scored well.\n\nBut for the sake of simplicity, I am wondering tax implications here\n\nPYPL 300C 8/20 bought at 10.8, Sold at 11.5, then during mid day push back, I bought it again at 10.7, and then it went down to 10.0, I believe, and I bought it at 10.0 (or maybe I was a little bit lucky to get the least pricing). Then When it hits back to 10.3, I sold back to lock the profits and to give me some buffer zones, and then before today's closing, I sold it back at 12.0\n\nSo basically, it was\n\nBUY SOLD = net profits\n\n10.8 11.5 = +0.7\n\n10.7 10.3 = -0.4\n\n10.0 12.0 = 2.0\n\nMy cost basis would be (buy) 10.8+10.7+10.0 = 31.5 and (sold) 11.5 + 10.3 + 12. 0 = 33. 8\n\nso am I going to be taxed on the differential 2.3?\n\nor due to wash sale rules, I would be taxed on 2.7 then?\n\nFollowing assumption must be applied\n\n1. Using RH, so it wont let me select specific lots, but first in and first out\n2. No complicated tax situation just W2 9-5 workers who want some financial freedom in early retirements\n3.

        "selftext": "# INTRO- Markets pulled back late last week, finally, after a long bull run. Going into this week, I expect more of the same before a possible couple of final good week until we see the major summer cool off. This isn't the best time to be getting into new positions and traders should be more defensive going forward. With most everything close to all time highs, my strategy of buying on support won't provide a lot of entries for the time being. Pulling back through the next couple of months will though.  \n\nTesla is now offering drivers an FSD subscription, charging $199 a month instead of a flat $10,000 fee. That could open a big, steady revenue stream for the EV giant. In China, **Tesla** also introduced the Standard Range Model Y and it is a huge hit. In days of being released, it was fully booked until October. I still like $**TSLA** up to $900-$1200.\n\nLast week was another good week of trading, although some positions that I have are a little behind. Next week should provide some catch up. If you feel the need to get into new positions, make them small for now. We will have a better opportunity in a couple months. \n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nI really like $**UPS** for two major reasons. One, there is a major increase in demand around the world. Two, going into the holiday season should naturally see the major shipping providers to see an increase in revenue. I like $210 monthly calls here, but prefer to buy at support and have an alert set.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xpd30m60s2c71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=71354d5a143ae7908f601af3161fcc4b672a3c46\n\n I'm adjusting the **ROKU** alert down to the 180 MA and will be waiting on a pull back. Still most analysts that I see are bullish on **ROKU**, but seeing how we are likely to pull back market wide I can be more patient. Once it does hit my entry zone, I'm interested in $400 EOY calls.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u6llvmv1s2c71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5f628b8783d58e183b545248af5f4582b9bc637b\n\n $**EBON** is probably the stock I feel most confident in a long term put. For those of you that don't know, they are a Chinese manufacturer of Cryptocurrency mining equipment, such as ASIC Bitcoin hardware. I've personally been to their factory near Shanghai, and was shocked at how dirty it was. Being a computer/asic chip maker, one would expect the factory floor to be in better shape. That being said, I've had luck shorting this stock before. I think it is a sinking ship. Ride puts into the ground here.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gyv2x903s2c71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c6fdf7351c2b937401d17af2a6ecb9c83dd8a61d\n\n Oil got hit last week, and **CVX** sold off Thursday and Friday. Overall I am bullish on **Chevron**, however I will be adjusting the alert trigger down to a lower support that dates back to the lowest low of Covid. There is also a big volume shelf here. Let's see if we can pick up some $100 calls a couple months out in expiration at this support.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qradn204s2c71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fca77db16efb387aff6dd184ad556b1a3eb661ad\n\n$**PYPL** has just come off of its resistance and is heading down. I might be a little late to the **PYPL** put party, but if it does test this major resistance again I've got my alert ready and will right down puts to the 50MA. Make note that **PYPL** usually has bad months in August and September. I'm thinking around $280p, couple months out.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/77ssiow4s2c71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c35fe805bfc56c24d086a4d08683f43d70ae5f91\n\n $**SQ**, another mobile payment provider, could really change the way we think of banking, transactions, and QR paying. I personally think that Paypal is ahead in these regards, but Square is up and coming for sure. Having lived in China for a decade and have witnessed the rise of mobile QR payment apps, such as Alipay and Wechat, I can tell you they are great. I don't carry a wallet anymore. I believe that **SQ** will eventually offer other products such as insurance, Investments and there is a lot of opportunity for advertisements and data collection. The price of this stock is approaching the 180 and 50MA. If you think like I do, you might want to take this chance to pick up some LEAPS on **SQ**.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yy84oru5s2c71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=48194be225d293ad730daf14635f6619363647c1\n\n I've set an alert for $**EMKR** pulling back all the way to the 180MA and then settling into LEAPS around a $10 strike. **EMCORE Corporation**, together with its subsidiaries, provides advanced mixed-signal optics products in the United States, Canada, Asia, Europe, and internationally.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0l9gsfw6s2c71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fa0e1fd32aa6647dfd2b8544b27e745231b75d74\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n **DG, Dollar General** usually does well in August and September while other indices, tech and growth are pulling back. Overall, I like this play for transitioning out of some tech stocks and setting up for a winter run. $**DG** has excellent management and has done a really good job with expanding its business in rural America. \n\nHowever in the short term it looks as if we can score on puts when the price reaches resistance. It would be ideal if we can ride them back down to the 20/50MA, or even lower support. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/003y8h48s2c71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d02ebd0b169fbbb8ef2964f4e59f1d5c4de44803\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n Disclaimer: The comments opinions and analysis expressed herein are for informational and educational purpose only and should not be considered as individual advice or recommendations.",

        "selftext": "**What it do?**\n\nAnother down day for most of the market, with Amazon's earnings cuck reverberating across the SPY, QQQ and many others. I personally played the VXX (volatility index) *again* this week, which is insane. It *almost* always goes up Friday with options expiring. Played both calls and puts on the SPY for profit. When your hedges end up being profitable in addition to your position? \\*chef's kiss\\* \n\nBeing bullish is way more fun, but bear plays can make money, too. Pigs? Yeah, they get slaughtered.\n\nObligatory these aren't stock recommendations, **this does not constitute financial advice - if you need that advice contact your broker**, I'm just analyzing data, do your own DD, I'm not a financial advisor but you can call me daddy if you like, \\*no position DD\\* for SURE coming this weekend I just need a stock to write about etc. etc. etc. \n\n \n\n**Earnings Calendar** (*now with updates!)*:\n\nMonday: Tesla (BIG BEAT), Lockheed Martin (miss EPS, beat revs)\n\nTuesday: Apple (beat), Microsoft (beat), Google (BIG BEAT), Visa (beat), UPS (beat), Starbucks (beat), Raytheon (beat), 3M (beat), AMD (beat), GE (beat)\n\nWednesday: Facebook (beat), Paypal (beat EPS, miss revs), Pfizer (beat), Qualcomm (beat), Shopify (beat)\n\nThursday: Amazon (beat EPS, miss revs), Mastercard (beat)\n\nFriday: Abbvie (beat), Exxon (beat), Chevron (beat)\n\nWhat did we learn?

The market as a whole had a rough day after Amazon's earnings miss. Puts percentage dropped in OI, but that might have been traders exercising during yesterday's drop. Looks like calls at $2.5, $3, and $4 OI dropped, as traders closed out of their positions once they started seeing profits dwindle. OI numbers suggest that there are quite a bit of calls being sold by traders at the $11 and $12 strikes, and puts being sold at $7 and $8. Premiums are so high these might end up being profitable, but with such a volatile stock, these positions can turn on you at the drop of a hat. OI numbers on Monday will be very telling if the mostly negative day shook out some call holders. I'll keep asking - Is the merger priced in?\n\n\\- **ATOS** \\- oh how the mighty have fallen. Pay attention, SPRT holders, as this was the last stock that ran up and tip-toed before falling back to Earth. ATOS wants to dilute, which, in the long run will probably be good for company since they have a big fat bagel as far as revenue goes. \n\n\\- **ARDX** \\- maybe this is the new floor for ARDX, as the free fall has subsided. As far as options go, the fact that the lowest strike is $2.50 just doesn't do it for me. Maybe as a LEAPS.\n\n\\- **ITP** \\- $0.5 calls here are cheap as dirt. Still, China stocks don't exactly put the tingle in my dingle.\n\n\\- **INFI** \\- another down day for INFI, yet the open interest sentiment is increasingly bullish, even with the 5-day put percent over 250.\n\n\\- **APRN** \\- sweet little 10% bump, continuing the move from yesterday. It's weird that a company with as big of a name as Blue Apron did an offering in June, but then again, they don't make money. When it comes to penny stocks, I'm not a huge fan of biopharmas - I want something that has a product. This company *does* but their financials aren't great.\n\n\\- **ATIP** \\- Seems like they are getting sued because their earnings report stunk and the stock dropped? Ooh boy, this kinda dumpster fire just ain't my cup of tea.\n\n\\- **WATT -** the company reported earnings yesterday after the bell. EPS -$0.18, $185K in revenue. They have $38 million in cash/equivalents and spent $11.2 million in operating expenses for the quarter. Either pump those revenue numbers up, or expect some kind of capital raise soon. You know what that means...most likely dilution.\n\n\\- **MNKD** \\- long investor hedging their position with the $3 put. This company just always reminds me of Attitude Era wrestling. Foley is God.\n\n\\- **LLNW** \\- Most of the option action was calls for September, which are still pretty cheap. This stock was up 10% at one point before fading to only a 5% gain. Penny earnings are hilarious, man. LLNW missed on revenue, EPS and the stock rose. Why? Guidance, lowering of costs, and improved service quality. \n\n\\- **CRNT** \\- Just under a 7% gain for the stock today. A lot of algos bought the dip on options around 11:30 EST. \n\n\\- **CBIO** \\- small drop today, right to the 52-week low. This may be leading some to buy into weakness, with the thesis that the share price could rebound at least a little. Also led to 1300+ call credit spreads with March 2022 expiration. Bearish.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCan SPRT reclaim its momentum? Is it advisable to buy puts on stocks that rocket out of nowhere? Are the markets prepped for new all time highs next week, or are we teetering on knife's edge? Find this out, and more, next time, on Dragonball Z!\n\nHollerrrrr if you wanna discuss. Shout out to \"random ticker with rocket emoji\" gang! I'll be glued to my computer writing all weekend if anyone need any help with stuff. \n\nHave a great weekend!",

        "selftext": "Hey gang, sorry for the missed post yesterday. Had a *ton* of work to do before the big earnings day after hours, then had to drive to a fancy pants business meeting/dinner in LA that was literally all about options trading. I'll make it up to you with a beefy post. Mmm....beef.\n\nObligatory these aren't stock recommendations, **this does not constitute financial advice - if you need that advice contact your broker**, I'm just analyzing data, do your own DD, I love my new job,  etc. etc. etc. \n\n Earnings Calendar (*now with updates!)*:\n\nMonday: Tesla (BIG BEAT), Lockheed Martin (miss EPS, beat revs)\n\nTuesday: Apple (beat), Microsoft (beat), Google (BIG BEAT), Visa (beat), UPS (beat), Starbucks (beat), Raytheon (beat), 3M (beat), AMD (beat), GE (beat)\n\nWednesday: Facebook (beat), Paypal (beat EPS, miss revs), Pfizer (beat), Qualcomm (beat), Shopify (beat)\n\nThursday: Amazon, Mastercard\n\nFriday: Abbvie, Exxon, Chevron\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo Tesla and Google both had monster earnings beats and the stocks drifted higher. Some of these companies beat analysts expectations but still dropped, Facebook for example. Why? Because of *how* they beat earnings and forward guidance. Let's stick with the Facebook example.  They beat analysts' expectations, but warned of significant growth slowdown. At this level, expectations are pretty high, but guidance is probably the most important factor in earnings for all stocks.\n\nSo my FOMC fearmongering was pretty much a total dud. I did close my VXX (volatility index) calls for a very healthy gain Tuesday. The TECS calls are probably a washout, but they were very cheap, and they don't expire until Friday. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n|STOCK|PRICE|VOLUME (AVG)|CALLS% - PUTS%|MOST ACTIVE (#)|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|SPRT\\*|8.97|99,567 (8,522)|86 - 14|Call options|\n|EDU|2.36|90,087 (45,902)|80 - 20|Aug $2.5 &amp; $5 calls|\n|INFI|2.45|59,570 (908)|77 - 23|Aug calls and puts|\n|RLX|4.38|23,566 (11,679)|86 - 14|Oct $7.5c (2.7K), Sept $5c (2.6K)|\n|OPK|3.89 (|12,110 (5,304)|45 - 55|Jan 23 $3p (5K), July 30 $4c (2.3K)|\n|ADVM|2.37,|10,306 (2,219)|100 - 0|Calls (Curiously all $2.5 calls spread across Dec, Mar 22, Jan 22)|\n|IGC|1.87|8,784 (2,731)|93 - 7|Aug $2c (4.6K)|\n|BTG|4.09|8,556 (1,912)|99 - 1|Sept $5c (7.5K)|\n|BITF|3.94|7,269 (3,990)|94 - 6|Aug $5c (1.5K), Feb 22 $5c (1.3K)|\n|ARDX|1.73|6,867 (2,435)|95 - 5|Aug $2.5c (2.8K)|\n|ATIP|3.85|6,182 (2,342)|83 - 17|Dec $5c (1.1K), Sept $10c (1.1K)|\n|NXTD|0.79|6,161 (2,515)|94 - 6|Aug $1c (3.8K)|\n|YQ|1.22|5,313 (418)|97 - 3|Aug $2.5c (4K)|\n|UAMY|1.03|5,269 (1,087)|96  - 4|Aug $1c (1K), Feb 22 $1c (1K)|\n|ASMB|3.54|4,625 (340)|35 - 65|Nov $5c (1.5K), Aug $5p (1.5K), Nov $5p (1.5K)|\n|TYME|1.22|4,012 (1,823)|73 - 27|Aug $2c (1.3K)|\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNotes:\n\n\\- **SPRT** \\- I *wish* I could have broke this down yesterday when SPRT was mooning AH. I'm glad it didn't give it all back throughout the day. Why the increase yesterday? Most likely a combination of short covering and increased delta hedging. 134K calls vs 55K puts in OI as of this morning, with 85K calls and \\~14K puts in today's volume. Saw some chatter about folks not using stop losses on this one. If you're glued to your broker, I guess that's fine. However, if you've ever cried about RH locking you out of trading, maybe a *trailing* stop wouldn't be such a bad idea. If you set a trailing stop and it gets triggered, at least gains were secured. As much as stock gurus talk about entry points, traders should take care of managing their EXITS. I'm not saying to sell, but I am saying that no one knows where this thing can or will go, so manage your risk. Have an exit in mind. I closed calls several days ago that would be worth WAY more now. Am I bummed? Sure, a little bit. But I secured my gains and there's literally always another trade.\n\n\\- **EDU** \\- a nice rebound today and yesterday for the beleaguered Chinese private tutoring company. Call volume has increased, but implied volatility is starting to drop, signaling that the majority of this call activity is short. Earnings are coming up, can EDU regain it's lost glory? Not any time soon, in my opinion.\n\n\\- **INFI** \\- INFI's price movement made me double-take today. What a wild ride. Stock slipped Monday ahead of earnings, then Wells Fargo upgrades it's price target to $14 and INFI comes roaring back. \n\n\\- **RLX** \\- no big news I can find, except their being sued a bunch for misstatements regarding its business prospects. Maybe don't claim you're #1 in something when you're not. I thought maybe the volumes were saying calendar spread, but it seems that algorithms were picking up these options.\n\n\\- **OPK** \\- I can't see any direct news for the increase besides perhaps some pre-earnings hype. Jan 2023 puts are a long protecting their position. The $4 weeklies are a pure earnings play. Dicey.\n\n\\- **ADVM** \\- some mild gains on the day after this stock fell off a cliff, just months after falling off a higher cliff. Must have caught the attention of some bullish hedgie algos.\n\n\\- **IGC** \\- a small bounce back up after bleeding back all of it's gains from a single day last week. I still see lots of red flags with this company.\n\n\\- **BTG** \\- Is this mineral mining company seeing an increase in price because it shares the same ticker as Bitcoin Gold? Probably not, but that was my first thought. No real news here, perhaps there were some folks afraid of inflation talk from the FOMC? Almost all of the action came from a single source.\n\n\\- **BITF** \\- another nice little day for the bitcoin mining stock. I'm actually writing an article on technical analysis of recent crypto movement for \\[redacted\\], and so far I'm most surprised at the fact that the excuse for the recent run-up was Amazon rumors and that the price hasn't fallen since Amazon denied the rumors. Of the most active options here, the most prudent is probably the LEAPS.\n\n\\- **ARDX** \\- is this the floor that I've been oh so annoying about? Uncertain. On Monday I said if it has a dead cat bounce, don't rush in. There for sure is money to be made buying into weakness, but I personally would like to see a stable level. The fact that the lowest option is at the $2.5 strike is a real turn off.\n\n\\- **ATIP** \\- some modest gains for ATIP after the selloff on Monday. Those September calls at $10 are very confusing, but at least they were cheap.\n\n\\- **NXTD** \\- no news, but a very modest gain of a few cents. OI for the $1 call is rising, and the put/call ratio is dropping. Probably some speculative attempts to hit a home run at $0.12 per contract.\n\n\\- **YQ** \\- very similar sort of setup to EDU. \n\n\\- **UAMY** \\- decent gain today from an \"operational update\" from the company. \n\n\\- **ASMB** \\- Looks like we got a put calendar spread (s) going on. Sell the near term put, buy the longer dated expiry.\n\n\\- **TYME** \\- wild ride for TYME. Took off on Monday, came back a little bit but was technically \"up\" Tuesday, then fell today. Put open interest has dropped off a cliff - I imagine when the price tanked traders closed their positions to take profits. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyways, my bad for missing yesterday, but there's big things brewing in the background on a personal level. Considering this forum is where I started writing about this kind of stuff in the first place, I'm very grateful for this sub and will continue to contribute as much as I can.\n\nIf you have any questions about options or trading in general, don't hesitate to reach out, either here or by DM.",

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, July 14, 2021**\n\nStocks largely gained today in another volatile session, with the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Nasdaq (QQQ) once again powering to new intraday highs, the third time this week for the SPY. The major indexes continue to be driven higher by continued strength in mega-cap tech stocks. The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small caps, continued its streak of underperformance, trading 1.65% lower today at the time of writing. Market participants continue to digest new inflationary data, Q2 earnings season, and Jerome Powell\u2019s testimony before Congress. \n\nThis week, the market is starting to experience signs of volatility, with the SPY opening the session firmly in the green before falling until about the middle of the session before recovering to close the day green. It seems to me that recent reports about inflationary data have injected some uncertainty into the market. The Labor Department\u2019s June Consumer Price Index (CPI), which measures changes in the prices of consumer goods, rose 0.9% in June, accelerating from May\u2019s 0.6%. Year-on-year, the CPI is up 5.4%, exceeding the 4.9% expected by economists and the fastest rate of growth since 2008. Core CPI, which excludes the volatile price energy and food and is therefore considered a more accurate representation of general price inflation, was up 4.5% year-on-year as prices bounced from last year\u2019s pandemic-era lows.\n\nToday, a report by the Labor Department showed that the Producer Price Index (PPI), which measures the average changes in prices received by domestic producers for their output rose 1% in June, accelerating to 7.3% rise year-on-year, while still reflecting base effects. Core PPI rse 5.5%. This is the fastest rate of increase since 2009.\n\nWhile the CPI and PPI prints are not ideal, the market\u2019s somewhat muted reaction (though there was a little volatility) seems to confirm that market participants are increasingly pricing in higher-than-expected inflationary data and are buying into the Federal Reserve\u2019s argument that current pressures are transitory and due to pandemic-related disruptions. Moreover, it is very important to consider that current inflationary data is calculated on a year-on-year basis, so base effects are very much inflating the current numbers. In other words, inflationary readings are high because they are being measured using numbers from June 2020 when prices across the board collapsed as lockdowns and social distancing policies were implemented across the world. As I have said many times in the past, I am personally not yet worried about current inflationary pressures translating into a prolonged cycle of higher prices, though one always has to acknowledge the risks in the market and be prepared to act. \n\nIn other news, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell gave  his semi-annual monetary policy to Congress, where once again, he basically said the same thing he has been saying for months. Powell said \u201cinflation will likely remain elevated in the coming months before moderating\u201d and that the US economy was \u201cstill a ways\u201d off from reaching the threshold of \u201csubstantial further progress\u201d that would trigger the Central Bank to roll-back pandemic-era policies. In short, Powell basically said while he expects higher inflation prints in the coming months, pressures are transitory and due to pandemic era disruptions and the Fed\u2019s goal for economic recovery have not been met. [Here is Powell\u2019s complete testimony, but here are two of his most important quotes.](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/testimony/powell20210714a.htm)\n\n**On the labor market:** \u201cConditions in the labor market have continued to improve, but there is still a long way to go. Labor demand appears to be very strong; job openings are at a record high, hiring is robust, and many workers are leaving their current jobs to search for better ones. Indeed, employers added 1.7 million workers from April through June. However, the unemployment rate remained elevated in June at 5.9 percent, and this figure understates the shortfall in employment, particularly as participation in the labor market has not moved up from the low rates that have prevailed for most of the past year. Job gains should be strong in coming months as public health conditions continue to improve and as some of the other pandemic-related factors currently weighing them down diminish.\u201d\n\n**On inflation:** \u201cInflation has increased notably and will likely remain elevated in coming months before moderating. Inflation is being temporarily boosted by base effects, as the sharp pandemic-related price declines from last spring drop out of the 12-month calculation. In addition, strong demand in sectors where production bottlenecks or other supply constraints have limited production has led to especially rapid price increases for some goods and services, which should partially reverse as the effects of the bottlenecks unwind. Prices for services that were hard hit by the pandemic have also jumped in recent months as demand for these services has surged with the reopening of the economy\u201d.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Big banks continued to underperform today, with investors not impressed despite banks posting very strong earning reports. . JP Morgan, which is often considered a bellwether for the US economy given its sheer size, reported great results, driven in part by the release of $3 billion the bank had set aside to protect against potential losses from default loans during the pandemic, a sign that consumers held up better than the bank expected. JPM recorded revenues of $31.4 billion and profits of $11.948 billion, a staggering improvement from profits of $4.687 billion a year ago. One downside from the earnings report is a sharp reduction in revenues produced from trading, which is not surprising given the insane run by the market in 2020. \n* Airline stocks initially gapped up in the morning after American Airlines (AAL) and Delta Airlines (DAL) offered upbeat outlooks for the second half of 2021, citing increasing consumer demand as the US continues to reopen. However, stocks were unable to hold onto their gains and largely finished negative.\n* Twitter (TWTR) announced it was discontinuing its disappearing Fleets feature after failure to win traction with users.\n* According to Facebook (FB), the company is pledging $1 billion to support content creators on its platforms through the end of 2022. Content creators will receive a monthly bonus if they hit milestones for earnings Stars, a form of digital tipping that fans can use to pay their favorite creators during live-streamed videos. Instagram's bonus programs will include incentives to use Reels, its copycat TikTok feature that showcases short-form video clips. Creators will earn money based on how their Reels videos perform, the company said.\n* Microsoft (MSFT) is betting hybrid work will provide an opening to make its Windows operating system more widespread, launching a new service aimed at getting users of Apple (AAPL) and Android products to use the software. Windows 365, the company said, will be accessible on any device running any operating system that has a web browser, such as Apple Mac computers, iPhones and iPads, or those running Android software made by Alphabet (GOOGL)\n* **\\*\\*Please note price target upgrades are written during the session and may not reflect closing prices\\*\\***\n* Apple (AAPL) target raised by JP Morgan from $170 to $175 at Overweight.

        "selftext": "tl;dr: Katapult Holdings (KPLT) is one of the best values in the market today. It has a dirt cheap valuation vs. its peers, and the growth runway is massive. Long shares.\n\nKatapult Holdings (KPLT) recently went public through a reverse merger. Katapult is a leading \"buy now, pay later\" (BNPL) player that provides financing options for non-prime customers. The newly merged company had its first quarterly earnings two weeks ago, and execution was solid. KPLT is profitable, growing quickly, and trading at a huge discount to other players in this field. I believe Katapult is a minimum $25 stock trading for $11.30. Keep reading if you want to know why.\n\nWhat Is Katapult?\n\nKatapult\u00a0provides BNPL options for non-prime Ecommerce customers. Katapult is the only pure-play financing platform dedicated to Ecommerce, as shown below:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rjuc35coft871.png?width=640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d22f897955d25ad8dd93d1f1a66fa226c08cba32\n\nSource: Initial Investor Presentation\n\nAccording to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, 38% of US consumers are considered nonprime, making it difficult for these consumers to access financing options. Additionally, 67% of consumers with a FICO score below 700 need a BNPL option for large purchases. Katapult provides this solution for online customers. Katapult's platform integrates seamlessly to merchant sites, so customers can choose the financing option as they check out.\u00a0\n\nConsumers are given three payment options through Katapult:\n\n* **First 90 Days**  \n\n   * Customers only pay the cash price + a 5% fee.\n* **After 90 Days**  \n\n   * Customers can complete the purchase at a significant discount to the full lease-to-own cost.\n* **Full Lease Term**  \n\n   * Payment is \\~2x the lease origination amount over the life of the lease.\n\nKatapult is partnered with merchants such as Wayfair, Lenovo, Purple, and Motorola. The company also has partner integrations with Ecommerce platforms like Shopify, BigCommerce, and OpenCart. Katapult gives online platforms access to larger customer bases and higher repeat purchase rates (45%).\u00a0\n\nKatapult also uses a \"waterfall\" method to gain customers that failed prime lending applications. When consumers fail to get financing from prime lenders like Affirm, they are passed on to Katapult.\u00a0\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jpcbpo9pft871.png?width=640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c8b4791b3ff9896f31abd9590288794f9c2d320f\n\n*Source: Investor Presentation*\n\nAs you can see from the graph above, Katapult approves \\~60% of consumers who failed prime lender applications. These \"waterfall\" applicants generate $117M incremental originations per 1M applications.\n\nKatapult's risk model reviews over 100 attributes, including lease history, prior payment behavior, and behavioral biometrics, to approve or deny applicants in under five seconds. The company has a sub-3% fraud rate across its portfolio, and it recovers 80- 90% of lease costs of charge offs.\n\nKatapult has also gotten more efficient as its platform has grown.\u00a0\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/unnh0l7qft871.png?width=640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fac474589c2380cb0938e7b0d46ad8e78a8a1103\n\n*Source: Investor Presentation*\n\nIndexed return on leases have increased each year as Katapult's customer base has expanded.\n\nQ1 Performance\n\nAs mentioned earlier, Katapult went public through a reverse merger. Reverse mergers are notorious for providing and falling short of aggressive revenue projections. Here are Katapult's projections from December.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5m7ntn9rft871.png?width=640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=903d916097cfb87bb9fe6a28bdf4d3410d322aa6\n\n*Source: Investor Presentation*\n\nNow let's see how the company performed. Katapult released Q1 earnings yesterday. The company did $82M in revenue, up 88% year over year. Net income was $8.1M, or a 120% increase from Q1 last year. Adjusted EBITDA was $14.7M, good for a 122% increase over last year too.\n\nHow about forward guidance?\u00a0\n\n* Gross Originations: $375-$425 million\n* Revenue: $425-$475 million\n* Adjusted EBITDA: $50-$60 million\n\nWhile the EBITDA target dropped slightly, revenue and originations are in line with December's projections.\n\nRelationship with Wayfair\n\nOne metric that stood out to me was the acceleration of originations from non-Wayfair merchants. 58% of Katapult's revenue came from Wayfair in 2020. However, in Q1 2021, Non-Wayfair originations were up 87.4%. This is compared to a 66% increase in Q4 2020 and 46.1% for FY 2020. Meanwhile, Wayfair originations were up 57.7%. Recent execution suggests that Katapult is making great strides to diversify its revenue streams.\n\nWhile Wayfair is still the company's largest source of income, Katapult CEO Orlando Zayas is not concerned. In a recent interview, he said this about their parternship with Wayfair:\n\n\"*I\u2019m not worried about it because if you\u2019re going to have a partner to have high concentration right now, Wayfair is a great partner to have. So we\u2019re really thrilled with their relationship. And the relationship is pretty deep too. We\u2019re actually in the process of doing a direct integration with them so that, you know, the tentacles, if you will, within the company are a lot tighter, and then we have a two year agreement with them. \\[\u2026.\\] So, you know, am I worried about it? No, because it\u2019s a great retailer. And I think our relationship is very strong, but, you know, I would like to minimize it and have, you know, five or six Wayfairs and a bunch of other smaller ones.*\"\n\nWith Katapult hinting at a deeper partnership with the furniture retailer, and the company showing accelerated growth in its non-Wayfair base, I am not too concerned with the heavy revenue concentration.\n\nValuation Gap\n\nValuation is the driving factor in my Katapult bull thesis. The stock is dirt cheap. While several reverse mergers have priced deals at sky-high valuations, KPLT went public at a $1B valuation with $450M in 2021 revenue.\u00a0\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s8wz8gbtft871.png?width=640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=db269053f7e8e661f0efe2bb871059e8feca8158\n\n*Source: Investor Presentation*\n\nThe graphic above comes from the December investor presentation. 14x EBITDA for a company growing sales, net income, and EBITDA at \\~100% for the last three years is great value by itself. When you compare this to other companies in the sector, Katapult looks criminally undervalued.\u00a0\n\nLet's look at the valuation gap now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kft0oa7uft871.png?width=640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=14b451c5c8afc295d37c65b25e5328b7cf53f536\n\nAt Tuesday's $11.37 price, Katapult was trading at 2.7x sales and 22.3x EBITDA. That's less than 1/3 of PayPal's (PYPL) revenue multiple and 1/2 of Paypal's EBITDA multiple, despite growing revenue 3x faster. When compared to Affirm (AFRM), a more direct competitor, the valuation gap is even larger. Push that valuation out to 2022, and KPLT is 8x EBITDA and 1.5x revenue. That's a value-stock price for a hypergrowth company.\n\n22.4x revenue for an unprofitable company growing at 40%, vs. 2.7x revenue for a profitable company growing at 65%. If Katapult went public through a traditional IPO, it would be worth over $2B right now. Because it used a reverse merger, sentiment around the stock has been poor.\n\nGrowth Prospects\n\nA study from Juniper Research suggests that BNPL transactions will grow from $226B in 2021 to $995B by 2026. 55% of Americans used a BNPL option as of March 2021, vs. just 37% in July 2020. There will be room for a lot of winners in this market, and Katapult will be one of them.\n\nKatapult is forecasting over $1B in revenue by 2023, and the company could beat this number if it keeps aggressively expanding to include new merchants. Katapult added 26 new retail partners in Q1 alone. Additionally, Katapult will benefit from the growth of its current partners like Wayfair.\n\nHere's the deal: there has been no sell-side coverage on this stock yet. When IBs start initiating coverage, it's going to moon. \"Price target $35 based on XYZ estimates\". You want to front run those releases. This a millionaire-making stock. When valuation is expensive, execution has to be perfect. When valuation is cheap? Any good news is a catalyst. I am giving you a $30 stock for $11. Don't miss it.\n\nRisks\n\nLike any investment, Katapult has its fair share of risks. The primary risk factors are:\n\n* Customer concentration\n* Credit risk from nonprime consumers\n* Competitors entering the nonprime market\n\nWhile Wayfair is still the company's largest customer, Katapult has been growing its non-Wayfair revenue base at an accelerating rate. Management assured investors that Wayfair would be a partner for a long time, so I don't foresee this risk causing any issues with business in the short term. Katapult has also been able to post consistent profits while dealing with nonprime customers, and its risk model has proven to be more accurate as the customer base expands. Finally, I don't see Affirm or another competitor taking market share from Katapult. KPLT has a multi-year head start in this market niche, and it has been able to scale its operations profitably. While other companies could enter this sector in the future, the total addressable market is large enough to accommodate multiple players.\u00a0\n\nConclusion\n\nStop chasing stocks that already peaked, and get in early for once. Katapult is a criminally undervalued stock given its growth rate and competitors' valuations, and I think it should be trading around $25 per share at the minimum. As we move further away from the reverse merger, Katapult will trade on its own merit, and I think the stock will appreciate accordingly. Assuming Katapult continues to scale its revenue and expand its customer base, I think the stock has a massive growth runway. I'm long shares, and I plan to hold them for a while.",

        "selftext": "So apparently I came to know Qiwi as a russian finnacial stock. I tried asking fellow WSB members about it, but most rejected my idea this stock, while they were pumping the migrant deporter GEO. \n\nWhy I think Qiwi will be 20% upside in next month. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ryjwpr51uka71.png?width=1028&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a6fd021d72170803c3fc14977cbe121098692d3d\n\nQiwi has been trading sideways for the last 6 months. while gaining momentum slowly. It's ATL was only 8.62 and currently it's trading at only $10.20.\n\n \n\n**Qiwi** is a leading payment solutions provider in Russia and much of the former Soviet Union. Apparently (according to the company), opening up a digital wallet on Qiwi is easier than tying one's shoelace -- all one needs is a phone number. There is no identity verification required, and the fees are low, if not zero. The company boasts of having more than 29 million customers and processes more than 128 billion rubles ($1.75 billion) worth of transactions each month.\n\nIt also manages more than 106,000 kiosks (ATMs) in the aforementioned geographical regions, where customers can deposit cash into their digital wallets. Don't regard this as a small detail; many former Soviet states still operate as cash-based economies. After all, capitalism has only been around in these countries since 1991. Cash is still king (or tsar, Putin, etc.) there.\n\nBut know that Qiwi is here to stay for the long term. For historical and political reasons, many Russian consumers are rather skeptical of Western-based tech firms (and I don't blame them!). Instead, they would prefer made-in-Russia alternatives, such as Vk.com instead of **Facebook**, and searching on **Yandex** instead of Google.\u00a0\n\nOr better yet, take the example of\u00a0**Paypal**\u00a0 The payment solutions giant has been in Russia since 2006 but recently terminated domestic money transfers between Russian users, citing unpopularity. It looks like the charm runs deep within Qiwi.\u00a0\n\nThe company has its own line of credit cards in addition to managing digital payments. What's more, it offers up to 8% cash back for its customers for shopping on e-commerce sites like AliExpress. More than 630,000 users have signed up for the bonus.\n\nDespite all it has to offer, the stock is ridiculously cheap at just 6.4 times forward earnings. For future growth, I would look at growing integration between e-commerce retailers and its own users. This is a top-notch payment solutions provider you don't want to miss.\u00a0",

        "selftext": "Payoneer is a payment platform that offers a way for businesses to pay and receive money, for a low fee. Payoneer believes that the total addressable market (defined as global e-commerce volume) is $26 trillion a year. Payoneer processed over $44 billion in 2020 alone.\n\nPayoneer works with 9 of the top 20 most valuable companies. Alongside these big names, Payoneer also has 5 million+ marketplaces and businesses, across over 190 countries.\n\nPayoneer also offers:\n\n* Accounting integrations\n* Capital to small businesses\n* Regulatory and compliance infrastructure\n* Physical debit cards\n* Tax solutions\n\nSo, it is basically a bank that includes an accountant to help meet a business\u2019 needs. The one product or feature that is missing is digital coins and no doubt they will be offering that soon, if anything they should make that a major priority.\n\n**Management Team**\n\nScott Galit - CEO of Payoneer, previously a senior VP at MasterCard. Serious financial services pedigree.\n\nMichael G Levine - CFO of Payoneer, ex-City VP and ex-CFO of Maler Technologies. MBA from Wharton.\n\nBetsy Cohen - Tons of finance related experience, including founding Bancorp. Should be able to give Payoneer great advice for future growth.\n\n**Customers**\n\nPayoneer has some big name clients, including but not limited to:\n\n* Amazon Europe\n* Google\n* eBay\n* Walmart\n* Upwork\n* Fiverr\n* AirBnB\n* Booking.com\n\nWeird right, they work with Ebay given Paypal does too. This is because they work with countries and specific clients that Paypal not accept into their platform. Investors need to understand that sometimes people have to use other platforms because they the Paypal\u2019s or banks are NOT willing to take the risk. Sure the risk is probably higher but the amount of people that need access to capital or payment process is high when many banks in many countries do not approve people for such type of access.\n\n**Switching Costs**\n\nIntegrating, setting up, and teaching staff how to use a new payment platform can be time-consuming and expensive for businesses. Therefore, when a client is set up on Payoneer, it is unlikely that they will switch to another provider. This is best seen by the &gt;100% volume retention that Payoneer has (i.e. customers stay and increase their payment volume).\n\n**Brand**\n\nPayoneer, from what I have seen, has a strong brand (though this is obviously a subjective factor). This idea is reinforced by the presence of their big name clients. Branding is really important in FinTech, businesses need 100% confidence when money and payments are involved. This offers not only stops entrants into their market, but should also facilitate future growth and customer acquisition.\n\n**Network Effect**\n\nImagine company A is on Payoneer and wants to pay company B. Company A suggests payment through their usual payment processor, Payoneer. Company B now signs up to Payoneer and decides to do all their payments through it etc. This is the network effect that Payoneer enjoys. This is a very powerful barrier to entry - very difficult to overcome, while also hard to create yourself.\n\n**Geographies**\n\nUNSUBSTANTIATED: Conversations on Reddit leads me to believe that Payoneer has a strong presence in Asia. If anyone has evidence, please put it in the comments.\n\nIf this is true, it should give Payoneer an edge in capitalising on the future growth of the emerging markets.\n\nSome evidence:\n\n* The CEO has gone on record saying Korea is one of their big market focuses.\n* Achieved triple digit growth each year in the asian markets from 2012-2016.\n\n# Valuation and Financials\n\n# Enterprise Value: $3.29 billion\n\n# Projected 2021 revenue: $432 million\n\n# EV/2021 revenue multiple: 7.6x\n\n# 2019-2020 revenue growth: 8.8%\n\n**Institutional Ownership**\n\nPayoneer has some institutional giants already invested, including Wellington Management, Dragoneer Investment Group, Fidelity Management and Research, Temasek, and Franklin Templeton.\n\n**What do I think the future holds for Payoneer? I actually think there are several exits for this company.**\n\n1. **Growth**: The company continues to grow and eventually reach billions of revenue within 5 to 10  years.\n2. **Consolidation**: Large international payments processer buys them. Could be Paypal, Square,      Stripe, First Data, etc. consolidation WILL happen in this space and I  think short-term Payoneer will acquire some companies and then be sold to a bigger company. Think of this as how banks in the USA were allowed to merge in 1995 given the law that passed. Before you had 100,000 banks then it was 50,000 banks, then 10,000 banks, and now like 5,000 banks but the top 10 banks make up a large % of the business/volume.\n3. **Wildcard**: CRM business buys them. What many people do not realize is that CRM\u2019s have been changing the game. First, it was to help you sell with marketing tools, then it is to improve communication within the team, then it will be stored, and legal transactions then it will be a financial transaction.      They are literally going to control the beginning to the end of the customer relationship and all of that data they possess is very valuable to help their customers grow.\n\nPersonal Note\n\n**Price Target**\n\nBull Case: $26\n\nMain Case: $21\n\nBear Case: $16\n\nHow did I get these numbers? Just educated guesses.\n\nDisclosure I am long on the company  (LEAP's and Shares)",

        "selftext": "I am an on and off investor/stockholder for many reason(one of them to keep my money safe). I buy and sell based on deep market deduction and patterns observed in  human behaviour. \nI\u2019m only analysing facts and if requested I come up with proof.\n\nOk let\u2019s start and crack this open. Due to well know global financial turmoil on March last year I was left without a job time when I start looking as many of us in share investments, puts, ETF etc. etc.\n\nUntil February current year I was a frequent PayPal user but as my bank account got slimmer so was my PayPal activity. You might think ahh this is why PayPal has a weak Q2. Don\u2019t rush with your foolish deductions be patient and I will reveal my full analysis. Around this time also me and my gf broke up from unrelated reasons to my financial activity. \nSo around April I\u2019ve seen this opportunity to buy puts in GME so with my last money thats what I did. I had 50 in my bank account I put 50 then I remember I have an overdraft so I squeezed my bank account out of it as much as I could until I reached on -98.05 (-100 is the limit). \nAfter few days some red figures was showing on my investment app I deleted my options and deleted the app. The results blank my mind. \n\nI became desperate I was left without income no saving no loans. No one to borrow money from. I was feeling tormented. Then I get a call from an unsaved number. As I don\u2019t receive any calls I thought yes this might be a future interview I applied for or my ex-girlfriend trying to get in touch with me. Unfortunately was a girl representing paypal asking me to move funds into my account as it\u2019s negative -50. I hang up the phone scared how I left my paypal account on negative. After few days my network provider cut my phone so paypal didn\u2019t tried to get in contact with me. \nThat happened in April up till now my PayPal balance is still on -50. That\u2019s what it shows whenever I go to McDonald\u2019s for wifi. \n\nMy conclusion is as it follows paypal had a weaker second quarter because I owe them 50 money. They must had spent much more because they moved me to a debt collection agency (I check my emails at McDonald\u2019s also) \n\nSo easy deduction they spent more money on me + my 50 money debt = profit loss = weak Q2\n\nI\u2019ll keep my PayPal account on negative this quarter also (I recommend all smart readers do this) and I\u2019ll buy puts at the end of the Q3. The profits will be staggering for sure. \n\nIf you\u2019re smart you can apply this technique and we will become rich together. \n\nPS: Edit: I\u2019ll use my parents credit card for this puts.",

        "selftext": "**How to make money with TikTok**\n\n(Before we start, This is how I did all this 100% Free: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr\\_OhOs8Xu8&amp;t=10s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr_OhOs8Xu8&amp;t=10s) \n\n**The** first manner human beings are creating wealth from Tik Tok is developing bills after which promoting them. This is turning into an increasing number of famous with-inside the eCommerce or product area. Example of Tiktok Live on diverse Tiktok bills. Similar to Instagram, you\u2019re going to pick a gap after which pass in advance and create wonderful content material, preferably content material that is going viral to draw that individual who might be the appropriate client on your product. There are already human beings on this area nowadays who're developing TikTok profiles round a sure hobby.\n\nUsually it\u2019s a gap subject matter and that they may not have whatever to promote, however they\u2019re going to attain out to manufacturers in that enterprise and promote their TikTok profile to them and those are authentic creating wealth this manner. The right information for product manufacturers is after they have that account of their hands, it\u2019s without a doubt pretty clean to promote merchandise. One manner that human beings are promoting merchandise is thru TikTok Live. They are launching merchandise whilst livestreaming or they\u2019re without a doubt keeping auctions whilst stay streaming. And, of course, there may be the hyperlink withinside the bio wherein you may constantly power your fans to buy your product. So in case you\u2019re the kind of individual to like TikTok, and also you simply need to develop a following round a sure subject matter and construct that network round a sure subject matter, pass for it after which attain out to the ones manufacturers who would really like to have get admission to to the ones fans and promote them your account.\n\n**#2: Donations** The 2nd manner human beings are creating wealth from TikTok goes Live and gathering donations from viewers (similar to you may do on different platforms, like Twitch). I discover this selection of TikTok fascinating. It\u2019s truly a constructed in monetization platform, actually from day one. From what I\u2019ve visible, here\u2019s the way it works: When you\u2019re a TikTok user, you may pass into your profile and buy some thing referred to as cash. For one hundred cash it'll price you $1.39. Now what do you do with those cash? When one in every of your preferred creators goes Live, you may without a doubt ship them cash as a manner of giving thank you for all in their attempt in growing the content material they do. What does the author do with this coin? The author turns the cash into diamonds and people diamonds may be transformed into coins through PayPal. Cool, proper? On the Chinese model of TikTok \u2013 an app referred to as Douyin \u2013 there may be a next-stage function much like this. When creators are Live, they could without a doubt connect a buying cart to a product they promote. So it\u2019s kinda like QVC or the buying channel. You can pass Live, keep an auction, and those can purchase your product whilst you\u2019re Live thru the buying cart function. My bet is this selection goes to return back to bills international faster in preference to later.\n\n**#3: Manage** influencer campaigns The 1/3 manner to make cash from TikTok is to control influencer campaigns. This isn\u2019t a brand new idea. There are directly up influencer organizations to serve Instagram influencers already. The identical idea applies to TikTok. You may be the intermediary or the broking among a author on TikTok and a logo who desires to paintings with that influencer. From growing the settlement, coping with each parties, ensuring the deliverables are all met \u2013 simply being a coordinator \u2013 you may fee a carrier rate to control campaigns like that. TikTok as a platform is smart; they without a doubt have an inner influencer software already constructed in. So if I\u2019m a massive logo and I need to attain out to TikTok and say, Hey, that is the distance I\u2019m in, what influencers ought to I paintings with? I can do that. The best component is, I\u2019m going to pay a percent to TikTok for brokering that settlement. That\u2019s wherein you may are available in as a carrier or business enterprise to make that settlement outdoor of TikTok and assist manufacturers shop a bit little bit of cash\n\n**#4: Tiktok** advertisements platform The fourth manner you may make cash from TikTok is through the use of their advertisements platform. Just like Facebook and Instagram advertisements, you may Google proper now, \u201cTikTok advertisements\u201d and join up for get admission to to their advertisements platform. It is quite self-explanatory in case you\u2019ve ever run paid site visitors before, so in case your market\u2019s on TikTok, it is probably really well worth you growing some advertisements, placing a few price range closer to experimenting there and seeing what occurs. Maybe you may promote greater of your merchandise thru TikTok!\n\n**#5: Management offerings** The 5th manner you may make cash from TikTok is through presenting control offerings for creators at the app. Some creators on TikTok have hundreds of thousands of fans and occasionally this occurs truly rapid and in a single day for that author. It\u2019s like having a enterprise land of their lap. Tiktok profile of Charli D'Amelio with 14.4M fans. You should step in and provide offerings to assist them with their content material method, their innovative method, perhaps coping with gives and offers that come their manner. So when you have that history in manufacturing or storytelling, you may simply observe that to presenting control offerings to [TikTok creators.](https://tiktokbusiness7.blogspot.com/)\n\n**#6: Consulting** Last however now no longer least, when you turn out to be a seasoned on TikTok, and perhaps you truly apprehend how a person should take a video that perhaps receives one hundred perspectives and assist them get 100,000 perspectives, well, you may really provide consulting offerings. This is a truly high-quality manner to leverage your understanding from the platform and assist folks who need to be TikTok well-known or they need to be creators, without a doubt increase their method so their films get visible through loads of thousands, if now no longer hundreds of thousands of human beings.\n\nOf course, you want to have the history and the enjoy on this first to provide this as a carrier. But when you\u2019re there, human beings can pay to have your enjoy and your mind on their account. And in case you assist them get any offers or influencer agreements, you may even negotiate a percent or a reduce of that deal really due to the fact you're their representative and you've helped them pass viral on TikTok. So there you've got got it. Six approaches that I see human beings creating wealth from[ TikTok nowadays, even whilst it\u2019s ](https://tiktokbusiness7.blogspot.com/)nevertheless truly, truly early on. Let\u2019s pass returned to my first factor at the start of this video. Why do I, an Instagram marketer, suppose that TikTok is probably greater effective than Instagram? The manner I see it, Instagram testimonies are type of much like TikTok films, however they expire after 24 hours. This is wherein TikTok is effective. TikTok is without a doubt much like YouTube, which means you may submit a video nowadays, however perhaps the set of rules alternatives it up months later and begins offevolved pushing that video into the feed of folks who would really like it.\n\nThe reality that your films don\u2019t disappear has a variety of electricity to it due to the fact it could power a variety of site visitors and eyeballs to you months after the reality. That motive on my own is why human beings have become occasionally hundreds of thousands of perspectives to their TikTok films with only a few fans. It\u2019s due to the fact the set of rules is selecting up your video, and pushing it out. Again, there\u2019s a variety of hobby and now no longer a variety of content material. So the set of rules is pushing it out to the folks who it thinks are going to be receptive to that content material. And \u2013 hello \u2013 waking as much as hundreds of thousands of perspectives with only a few fans. I mean, in nowadays\u2019s day and age, I don\u2019t suppose there\u2019s some other app or platform that could provide you with the ones types of[ outcomes proper now.](https://tiktokbusiness7.blogspot.com/)",

        "selftext": "Posting here to offer a little perspective on what some apes saw as a quick hype play.\n\nIt was evident that PSFE had finally found bottom last week after months of daily short attacks.  For months, we saw all the tell-tale signs of market manipulators expertly shaking out retail shareholders with order flow, short volume, massive block trades and 13F\u2019s showing institutions steadily loading up.  In this context, just as PSFE was to be officially added to the Russell 1000 and 3000 indexes, it seemed a little suspicious that Paysafe was suddenly being hyped and trending on WallStreetBets.  I had to wonder if this was an engineered event to generate more liquidity since market makers were clearly running out of sellers right when they had to fill a lot more institutional orders.\n\nThat\u2019s all just monkey brain theory that ultimately doesn't matter because my plan is to hold PSFE long-term.  There is a clear strategy with this company that will take some time to come to fruition and I want to be in on the ground floor, before all the rosy ER\u2019s come in.  With a fintech that does roughly as much transactional volume as Square and, despite recent reports, has similar growth to PayPal, it\u2019s no surprise that institutions want to accumulate at levels so low that the stock is almost completely de-risked from a long-term perspective.\n\nThe comprehensive DD below is for the diamond handed apes who may have been caught in the recent hype. Know that you\u2019re not alone. We saw the same thing right after CNBC\u2019s Jim Cramer called Paysafe, \u201cthe ultimate stock for this moment\u201d and market analyst Steve Grasso repeated his calls for it go to \u201c$45/$50 and then settle in before moving higher from there.\u201d  After initial spikes, deep-pocketed short-sellers methodically crushed retail holders, eventually bringing the price down to where it was last week.\n\nBut informed short sellers knew they couldn't push too far because that price was really not far from the price paid by noted fund managers like Dan Loeb (Third Point 41.5 million shares), David Tepper (Appaloosa Management, 10 million shares), Aaron Cohen (Survetta Capital, 13 million shares), Dipanjan Deb (Francisco Partners, 20 million shares) and Leon Cooperman (personally owns 1.1 million shares).  A price probably lower than paid by Wells Fargo\u2019s several funds (12 million shares) and even by Blackstone when they raised their initial stake of 123 million shares to a total of 160 million shares.^(1)  Also, it\u2019s worth noting that, since they all decided to invest, Paysafe has created significant value including securing new revenue streams in the US iGaming market and expanded partnerships with Coinbase, ESL Gaming, Luckbox, and Microsoft among others. ^(2)\n\nWith a presence in 120 countries, Paysafe is an extremely diversified global payment processor: #1 global leader in iGaming, #2 global digital wallet, #4 globally in integrated merchant processing. Ever since private equity groups Blackstone and CVC took Paysafe private, they\u2019ve been going through a major restructuring to reduce risk, increase margins and profits. It's because they are still very much in the middle of that process that I like it so much as an investment opportunity. Here are a few key points:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* In 2017, private equity groups Blackstone and CVC raised their bid five times to ultimately to take Paysafe private for $3.9 billion.^(3)  Blackstone says their typical investment term is \u201cupwards of 7-10 years\u201d ^(4) which aligns with the investment time-frame implied by an inside source close to those negotiations who said, \u201cThere is a fundamental change in the way we pay for goods and services, away from the cash and cheques of our parents\u2019 age,\u201d adding that the private equity firms \u201chave a decade-long thesis that this shift will only grow and grow and they want to get in now.\u201d ^(5)\n* Under Blackstone/CVC\u2019s stewardship, Paysafe grew revenue 65% from $864 million to $1.418 billion (28% CAGR pre-Covid). Last year, due to Covid-related brick-and-mortar business and sporting event closures, along with their long-standing strategic decision to exit specific high-risk Asian revenue channels, 2020 revenue stagnated.  This is the reason they recently reported only 5% YoY quarterly growth.  In their Q1 ER, management noted that, without those channel exits they would have reported growth in the \u201cmid to high teens.\u201d  But even if you include 2020\u2019s stagnant growth, their overall revenue growth since 2017 was still 18% CAGR. This is roughly the same as PayPal\u2019s current projected growth. ^(6,7)\n* A few months ago, Paysafe was brought public through a reverse merger transaction with acclaimed deal maker Bill Foley, Chairman of Fidelity. The deal paid down $1.2 billion in debt and gave Blackstone/CVC about $5.6 billion in cash and shares.^(8)  The fact that Blackstone's recent 13F shows they bought back 37 million shares, combined with statements from them and Paysafe's board, indicates that they did this deal, not for a mere 44% gain on a four year investment, but because Bill Foley is an extraordinarily successful and well-connected deal maker who has a proven track record for generating exponential growth.\n* Inorganic growth through M&amp;A is a major pillar of Paysafe\u2019s strategy going forward.  Bill Foley, now Chairman of Paysafe and a major shareholder, is a proven M&amp;A synergy wizard, particularly in the financial services arena.  Foley took Fidelity National Financial from $3 million market cap to $10.8 billion. Yeah, that\u2019s and \u201cm\u201d and a \u201cb\u201d.  Over just the last five years, Foley grew Ceridian 3.3X ($4.2B to $14B), Dun &amp; Bradstreet 5.6X ($2B to $11.3B), and Black Knight 8.7X ($1.6B to $14B).  Through his proven M&amp;A playbook, Foley also grew FIS from $2.5 billion to over $91 billion market cap. That\u2019s a 36x return.  He says  \u201cThose characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.\u201d ^(6,9)\n\n**Deleveraging, increasing margins and profit**\n\n* Paysafe recently confirmed they are on track to meet 2021 projections of $1.53 billion in revenue, $930-$970 million in gross profit, double-digit growth and expanding 30-35% EBITDA margins, and $103 billion in transactional volume.  Paysafe\u2019s already strong $362 million in 2020 free cash flow was reported to be on track for 29% growth in 2021.  Notably, their multi-year projections don\u2019t include growth from their \"active M&amp;A pipeline\" and their ongoing US iGaming expansion (projected at 55% CAGR).\n* Q1's earnings disappointed some because, as part of their restructuring, they had $90 million in one-time non-recurring expenses associated with the merger and paying down $1.2 billion in debt. The company noted: \u201cResults included interest expense of $58.5 million, an increase of 53% compared to the prior year, reflecting the expense of capitalized debt fees as a result of debt repayment on March 31, 2021. Net loss also included share-based compensation of $72.4 million, compared to none in the prior year due to shares vested on completion of the Transaction.\"\n* Take away the $90 million in one-time expenses and, rather than reporting a $49 million loss, the company would have reported $41 million in quarterly net profit, thereby beating all analyst estimates. All signs indicate they are on track to beat estimates going forward, although I have noticed a few platforms raising those estimates recently.\n* In addition to paying down $1.2 billion in debt, an improved Moody\u2019s credit rating has enabled the company to refinance roughly a billion at a 1.25% lower interest rate, with an option to reduce it another 25bp.^(10)  Foley says: \u201cOne of the keys to this transaction and value creation for our shareholders is the reduction of Paysafe\u2019s leverage ratio to 3.6x Debt/EBITDA.\u201d  Notably, this Debt/EBITDA ratio is far better than the majority of their fintech peers, and the resulting improved margins stand to make it better still.\n* The combined effect of overall recent debt management will be a savings of around $92 million annually.  This secures higher margins, increased cash for M&amp;A and higher profits which, in my view, will lead to raised price targets and positive price action catalysts.\n* As part of their restructuring to cut down on operating expenses and further increase margins, Paysafe has recently forged agreements with Snowflake and AWS as they move to cloud-based integration for easier migration between their platforms, easier cross-border payments and planned expansion into global banking as a service, having identified a $58 trillion TAM.\n\n**Highly competitve**\n\n* Unlike other payment processors, Paysafecard enables those without basic ID metrics, credit cards, or even bank accounts (the 1.7 billion \u201cunbanked\u201d globally) to engage in eCommerce in over 50 countries. This segment grew 63% YoY.  Just today, Microsoft introduced Payesafecard to its Xbox platform in 22 countries.\n* In various segments, Paysafe has recently expanded their partnerships with FOX bet, Roblox, Fortnight, Coinbase, Amazon, Twitch, Microsoft/Xbox, bet365, ApplePay, Draftkings, Spotify, Youtube, Visa, Betfair, PayLease, ESL Gaming, Luckbox, Amelco, BetMGM, Ceasar\u2019s, and Pointsbet among many others.\n* \\#4 globally in integrated merchant processing, Paysafe\u2019s proprietary scalable electronic payment platform was voted \u201cBest Omni-Channel Payment Solution\u201d, \u201cPayment Processor of the Year,\u201d and \u201cBest Payment Method.\u201d\n* They are #2 globally in the digital wallet space with a presence in 120 countries. They own Neteller and Skrill, which was voted \u201cBest Digital Wallet\u201d for \u201cbest consumer take up\u201d, \u201cmost innovative technology\u201d with \u201cgreatest potential to disrupt current ecosystems.\u201d\n* People are usually more likely to leave reviews when a payment platform doesn\u2019t meet their expectations. That said, Trustpilot rates Paysafecard as \u201cExcellent\u201d (4.7/5 stars-31,981 reviews), Paysafe\u2019s digital wallet Skrill as \u201cgreat\u201d (4.1/5 stars-18,037 reviews) and Skrill Money Transfer as Excellent (4.8/5 stars - 8,349 reviews). ^(11)\n   * By contrast, Truspilot rates Stripe as \u201cAverage 3.4/5 stars- 6,208 reviews), Venmo as \u201cbad\u201d (1.2/5 starts - 222 reveiews), Zelle as \u201cbad\u201d (1.2/5 stars - 326 reviews) and PayPal as \"bad\" (1.2/5 stars-18,555 reviews). ^(12)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2tce80abpl871.png?width=475&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=32e78dde014d5edf387cd4f9f603fceb6ab6c4c7\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**\u201cAt Paysafe, the iGaming market volume was estimated to be $3.4 billion in 2019, and is now projected to reach $47 billion in 2025.\u201d**\n\n**\u201cIt\u2019s our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate.\"** \\- Bill Foley\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Paysafe is the #1 global leader in iGaming payment processing, a space that is extremely difficult to enter, due to managing risk and a very complex regulatory landscape. Paysafe\u2019s advantage here is a large aspect of its MOAT, as discussed below.  Paysafe is often an integrated back-end payment processor so most don\u2019t realize they are using it but they are already integrated with 75% of all US iGaming operators. Paysafe is actively laying the groundwork for their US expansion in the wake of a US Supreme Court decision allowing state-legalized sports betting.\n* Bill Foley says, \"It\u2019s going to be a land grab. We want to be out there about 10 miles ahead of everybody else\u2026we\u2019re seeding the future growth right now by state and by operator... The day a state opens up, we are there ready from a regulatory perspective, from a risk perspective, and from a product perspective... I have a vision that we should be THE digital wallet and have tie-ins with every major casino company that\u2019s headquartered or located in Las Vegas. There will be money to be made for everybody... We\u2019ve got a wide landscape we can attack. It\u2019s pretty exciting\u201d\n* In his letter to investors, fund manager Dan Loeb said, \u201cWe believe the US is poised to become the largest online gambling market globally as it begins to deregulate state by state and Paysafe is exceptionally positioned to capitalize as the global market leader.\u201d\n* Compass Point analyst Michael Del Grosso, who initiated coverage with a $19 price target, noted, \u201cPSFE operates in high-growth verticals, has a unique advantage in its consumer and merchant facing solutions, and offers exposure to a secular growth opportunity in the potential legalization of iGaming in the United States,\u201d adding, \u201cwe believe there is upside to our forecasts in the event of state-level legalization of iGaming.\u201d ^(13)\n   * Recent headlines since Del Grasso wrote that:\n      * \"New York State Legalizes Online Sports Wagering\"\n      * \"Maryland Online Sports Betting Bill Passes Legislature\"\n      * \u201cNew Hampshire sports betting deal approved overwhelmingly; Hogan likely to sign\"\n      * \"Arizona governor signs bill legalizing sports betting\"\n      * \"Wyoming Legalizes Sports Betting\"\n      * \u201dDelaware igaming revenue up 74.3% year-on-year in March\"\n      * \"Pennsylvania gambling revenue rockets 162.7% in March - The biggest increase was recorded for sports wagering, where revenue rocketed by 326.1%\"\n      * \u201cCaesars Entertainment (Paysafe partner) announced Official Sports Betting Partner of NFL\"\n      * \u201cMichigan\u2019s online sports betting launch hailed a success, Ohio could follow this year\u201d\n      * \u201cOhio legislators doubling down on legalized sports gambling\u201d\n      * \u201cLouisiana Begins The Process of Legalized Sports Betting\u201d\n      * \u201cPath to legalized Texas sports betting becomes more clear\u201d\n      * \u201cNC lawmakers make push to legalize sports gambling to generate funding for schools\u201d\n      * \u201cFlorida poised to offer sports betting under major gambling deal\u201d\n      * \u201cLegal Sports Betting Could Get To California Sooner Than You Think\u201d\n      * \u201cCanada legalizes single-game sports betting\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Every analyst covering Paysafe rates it as a \"Buy\". A few quotes :\n   * RBC Capital 5-star analyst Daniel Perlin: \u201cWe believe PSFE offers a unique combination of digital wallet capabilities, accelerated cash conversion for consumers who would otherwise be out of the ecommrece loop, and integrated payments, all focused on specialized &amp; complex end-markets, which creates a competitive moat and pricing power.\u201d \u201crecent underperformance is largely due to the complex nature of PSFE\u2019s business and the FTAC II transaction\u201d and adds his view that Paysafe offers one of the best combinations of services in online payment space: \u201cPSFE has created a unique two-sided network enabling merchants to accept online &amp; in-store payments (in specific niche verticals), while also offering consumers a digital wallet &amp; eCash solution, which converts cash-heavy users to digital users. We believe it\u2019s this combination that enables PSFE to generate superior take rate economics vs. peers.\u201d ^(14)\n   * BMO Capital, 5-star analyst, James Fotheringham: \u201cPSFE is a global leader in iGaming (online betting related to sports, poker, and other casino games, as well as lotteries and bingo). Indeed, 36% of PSFE\u2019s revenues are from global iGaming. That is far more than for any of its peers.\u201d iGaming deposit volumes in the U.S. will grow \u201cat more than five times the rate of growth elsewhere in the world\u201d with a \"5-year CAGR (compound annual growth rate) of between 40% to 55%.\" ^(15)\n   * Evercore ISI analyst David Togut 'praised Paysafe for its \u201crobust risk management operation,\u201d and its high rankings in several key performance indictors globally, including cash network, stored digital wallet value, and amount of partnered independent merchants.' ^(16)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**MOAT:**  **\u201crobust risk management operation\u201d**\n\nSo why does Paysafe dominate iGaming and why how is it able offer eCommerce services to the 1.7 billion globally who can't even manage to have bank accounts or credit cards?\n\nTheir industry leading multi-jurisdictional regulatory expertise offers a durable advantage in spaces where competing fintechs are hesitant or unwilling to enter. CEO Philip McHugh from transcript : \u201cWhen we talk about a deep and a wide MOAT, this is absolutely one of the areas that we see that benefit where it\u2019s hard to copy.\u2026We have over 300 professionals dedicated to risk, compliance, and analytics. That is very, very rare in the payments space. It\u2019s a real strength of ours. We\u2019ve been able to track some of the top people in the industry, including the former CRO from PayPal, and we\u2019ve upgraded the team, we\u2019ve built some real data capabilities, and we see this continuing to be an area of differentiation for Paysafe versus others.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can de-risk some transactions where the market has abandoned many of these players\u2026we bring millions of consumers into the ecosystem. We bring unique ways to pay and access funds that a typical card processor certainly can\u2019t do. When you have that two-sided network, you change the conversation. When we speak to some of our largest iGaming customers, we\u2019re not only talking about take rates and comps, we\u2019re talking about revenue-generation, we\u2019re talking about attracting the types of customers that they want and they need in their ecosystem. That\u2019s a really, really powerful position to have.\u201d ^(9)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Valuation:**\n\nA while back I looked at a basket of fintech peers including PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, BILL, GPN, and Paysign.\n\n* Paysafe reports 30%+ EBITDA margin,  mid to high teen EBITDA growth, and $362 million in free cash flow (now on track to increase 29%),\n* By comparison, a third of the peer group reported negative EBITDA, half reported negative EBITDA growth, and a third negative free cash flow.\n* Paysafe also has better EPS than over half the group and better Debt/EBITDA ratio than 3/4 of them.\n* The group's collective growth rate of \\~12.5% is in the range of Paysafe's 10-13% projections but the company's estimates may be intentionally conservative as they do not take into account their current expansion into US iGaming nor do they factor in their \"active M&amp;A pipeline.\"  Foley is apparently known for under-promising and over-performing.\n* As noted above, Paysafe was growing 28% CAGR pre-Covid, but taking into account last years slow down due to Covid-related business closures and strategic channel exits, it grew at 18% CAGR, a rate on par with PayPal's projected growth.\n\nGiven all the above factors, it seems fair to look at Paysafe's potential price based on an average of peer multiples:\n\nPaysafe\u2019s share price with average of sector peer multiples:\n\n* EV/EBITDA ratio : $122.09\n* EV/Rev ratio : $83.91\n* EV/FCF ratio : $87.86\n\nAverage: $97.95\n\nMore realistic price after removing all outliers in each category which put PSFE share price over $100\n\n* EV/EBITDA ratio : **$50.75**\n* EV/Rev ratio : **$44.64**\n* EV/FCF ratio : **$44.18**\n\n**Average : $46.52**\n\nIn a nutshell, the basket of sector peers has an average growth within Paysafe\u2019s conservative projections yet they trade at 350-750% higher multiples. With Paysafe having better financials than most, it is hard to argue that this is proportionate. Either the entire field has to come down or Paysafe has to go up.  While I don't necessarily agree with his time frame, market analyst Steve Grasso's call for \"$45/55\" may actually be quite reasonable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Sources:**\n\n(1) [https://fintel.io/so/us/psfe](https://fintel.io/so/us/psfe).\n\n(2) [https://www.reddit.com/r/PSFE/comments/oak2jx/paysafes\\_value\\_creation\\_trajectory\\_is\\_very\\_much/](https://www.reddit.com/r/PSFE/comments/oak2jx/paysafes_value_creation_trajectory_is_very_much/)\n\n(3) [https://www.wsj.com/articles/blackstone-cvc-to-buy-paysafe-for-3-9-billion-in-latest-online-payments-deal-1501830827](https://www.wsj.com/articles/blackstone-cvc-to-buy-paysafe-for-3-9-billion-in-latest-online-payments-deal-1501830827)\n\n(4) [https://pws.blackstone.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2020/09/the\\_life\\_cycle\\_of\\_private\\_equity\\_insights.pdf](https://pws.blackstone.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2020/09/the_life_cycle_of_private_equity_insights.pdf)\n\n(5) [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-paysafe-group-m-a-idUSKBN1AK0KN](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-paysafe-group-m-a-idUSKBN1AK0KN)\n\n(6) [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1818355/000119312520311998/d54063d425.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1818355/000119312520311998/d54063d425.htm)\n\n(7) [https://www.paysafe.com/fileadmin/content/pdf/Analyst\\_Day\\_presentation\\_March\\_9\\_\\_2021.pdf](https://www.paysafe.com/fileadmin/content/pdf/Analyst_Day_presentation_March_9__2021.pdf)\n\n(8) [https://sec.report/Document/0001104659-20-089252/](https://sec.report/Document/0001104659-20-089252/)\n\n(9)  [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1818355/000119312520311837/d18843d425.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1818355/000119312520311837/d18843d425.htm)\n\n(10)   [https://www.globalcapital.com/article/b1s344yyc1zccx/paysafe-preps-post-spac-refi](https://www.globalcapital.com/article/b1s344yyc1zccx/paysafe-preps-post-spac-refi)\n\n(11) [https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.paysafecard.com](https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.paysafecard.com)\n\n(12) [https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.paypal.com](https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.paypal.com)\n\n(13)  [https://www.streetinsider.com/Analyst+Comments/UPDATE%3A+Compass+Point+Starts+Paysafe+Group+Ltd.+%28PFSE%29+at+Buy%3B+All-In+on+an+iGaming+Opportunity/18197588.html](https://www.streetinsider.com/Analyst+Comments/UPDATE%3A+Compass+Point+Starts+Paysafe+Group+Ltd.+%28PFSE%29+at+Buy%3B+All-In+on+an+iGaming+Opportunity/18197588.html)\n\n(14) [https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/billionaire-david-tepper-places-bet-on-3-strong-buy-stocks-2021-06-04](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/billionaire-david-tepper-places-bet-on-3-strong-buy-stocks-2021-06-04)\n\n(15) [https://themoneymanifesto.com/2021/06/21/paysafe-is-ready-to-ride-the-igaming-wave-analyst-says-buy/](https://themoneymanifesto.com/2021/06/21/paysafe-is-ready-to-ride-the-igaming-wave-analyst-says-buy/)\n\n(16) [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/paysafe-poised-profit-085250018.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/paysafe-poised-profit-085250018.html)",

        "selftext": "Disclaimers: I got paid to write the original article (not on WSB), I don't own the stock and this is obviously not financial advice\n\n# Key Points\n\n**Paysafe Limited** ( [NYSE:PSFE](https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/software/nyse-psfe/paysafe) ) is a payment processor and is not going to be the new Stripe or PayPal, but has a solid chance to **grow within specialized industries like gambling and gaming**. \n\n**Their brand Skrill** is especially tailored to fit the European market and has gained some good barriers to entry from competition because of the huge EU regulations for payment processing and transactions.\n\nPaysafe went private in 2017 and was flipped back on the market in 2021 by Blackstone ( [NYSE:BX](https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/diversified-financials/nyse-bx/blackstone-group) ).\n\nThink of Blackstone as one of those agencies that buy a house in a good area but is half torn down because the owner ate too much crayons. They buy a stake in the property, tear down the ruined walls, fix up the rest and put it back for sale. This is actually a pretty smart move, as they gave Paysafe a second chance, and a profit opportunity for investors (and a big fat chunk for themselves).\n\nWith the new shareholder structure they have significantly more pressure on management to deliver returns and pay off some of the long term debt (more below).  \n\n\n[Shareholder Structure PSFE](https://preview.redd.it/ttxv4m5i0l871.png?width=843&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=181308678e7f80fce6b13b1c2219c99dddece313)\n\nThey have Microsoft as a client and are tied to the success of the MS Store and Xbox, which is currently growing.\n\n# The Business\n\nPaysafe is a payment platform that enables businesses and consumers to connect and transact by payment processing, digital wallet, and online cash solutions.\n\nIt offers digital wallet solutions under the **Skrill** and **NETELLER brands** , which enable users to transact from a virtual account.\n\nThe company generates most of its revenues by processing online payments for merchants and customers engaged in the online gambling and foreign exchange trading sectors.\n\nPaysafe focuses on specialized and high-risk verticals, including:\n\n* iGaming\n   * Encompasses a broad selection of **online betting related to sports, esports, fantasy sports, poker and other casino games**\n* Emerging Markets\n   * Includes **stock, FX and blockchaincoin trading, direct marketing** (which can include nutraceuticals and multi-level marketing, travel and entertainment, integrated payments and digital goods)\n\n**These streams represented approximately US$1.1 b, or 74%, of Paysafe\u2019s revenue** for the year ended December 31, 2020.\n\nPaysafe\u2019s CEO, Philip McHugh, [*stated* ](https://www.barrons.com/articles/paysafe-is-public-again-51617221958)that r oughly 75% of online gambling operators use Paysafe for processing payments. This includes operators like DraftKings ( [NASDAQ:DKING](https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/consumer-services/nasdaq-dkng/draftkings) ), William Hill, Betfair, Bet365, Golden Nugget Online Gaming ( [NASDAQ:GNOG](https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/consumer-services/nasdaq-gnog/golden-nugget-online-gaming) ), PokerStars, and more.\n\nPlayers of iGaming can use Paysafe\u2019s Skrill and Neteller digital wallets, and other services to place bets.\n\n# Revenue by Segment\n\nIts important to know which Paysafe services sell the most, and grow. Here is a breakdown of revenue by segment:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Quarterly Revenue by Segment for Q1 2021 vs Q1 2020](https://preview.redd.it/qggorsml1l871.png?width=690&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2581b60bf3fdc3ee62ddf2ec02c92cc8f06b8aca)\n\nPaysafe\u2019s **growth is currently concentrated within the eCash Solutions**, while the other segments took a slight reduction in the first quarter of 2021. Their strongest segment is integrated processing, with a US$176.9 m revenue in Q1 2021. \n\n# Expansion\n\nPaysafe recently [announced](https://ir.paysafe.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/95/paysafe-to-enable-online-cash-payments-on-microsoft-store) that it has further extended its relationship with Microsoft ([NASDAQ:MSFT](https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/software/nasdaq-msft/microsoft)), and is now enabling online cash transactions on Microsoft Store on Xbox. With this, Paysafecard is now available on Xbox consoles for millions of customers in 22 European countries. If done right, this has a large growth potential.\n\nThis is good but not huge, because Paysafe was already offering payment processing to Xbox, they have now increased the payment options.\n\nHowever, the fact that Microsoft has partnered with Paysafe gives the copmany potential to grow along with the growth of the MS store and Xbox sales. \n\nAn additional potential boost will be the fact that the MS store will come by default and expanded in the new Windows 11. \n\nThe downside is that Microsoft has the pricing power to dictate terms, and Paysafe might need to settle for lower margins.\n\n# Debt\n\nConsidering financial health and the company\u2019s direction, one of the reasons Paysafe sought to **go public was to raise enough capital from shareholders in order to pay-out some of its outstanding debt**.\n\nManagement has committed to, and is following through with this goal!\n\nThe company has paid out close to US$1.4 b from its total US$3.5 b debt.\n\n**On the surface, this looks like a stabilizing move, but it may have some implications:**\n\n1. Management made a possibly bad decision when leveraging a young growth company in the past\n2. If the company had to be flipped private to public again by a third party, that **raises questions as to why wasn\u2019t the company able to outgrow the debt problem in the first place?**\n   1. Did they have bad management, a wrong capital structure, did they overestimate their growth capacity, or were they early with their innovation and misjudged market demand?\n\n**The answers to these questions are crucial in shaping the way investors see this company.**\n\nIf it was a management error, then that is fixable with supervision, transparency and governance.\n\nIn case they had the wrong capital structure, then flipping the company by Blackstone ( [NYSE:BX](https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/diversified-financials/nyse-bx/blackstone-group) ) was the perfect move to get future returns.\n\nIf they overestimated their growth capacity, things get dangerous, because this means the company may not be able to enter a high growth phase and deliver more profits than the current (or lower) valuation.\n\nFinally, if they were early on their innovation, they now have a second chance with a more mature market and fresh capital.\n\nCheck the operating expenses in the future for Paysafe! Since this is a software company, an increase in OpEx should be multiplicative for growth down the line (this does not materialize immediately). Also, keep an eye on R&amp;D and SG&amp;A expenses - Marketing and research &amp; development, should drive multiplicative but **not** linear growth - otherwise they are just spending money on cheap customer acquisition numbers.\n\n# Analysts Estimates\n\nTake a look at the future growth lines. Revenue is expected to grow but not too much, about 10% per year. This means that the current market price already reflects the future growth in the company, and the way to change this is if Paysafe gets another large client(s) like Microsoft.\n\nAlso, gambling on sports events is projected to increase as the lockdowns are lifting, and we will most likely see some growth in Q3 and Q4 2020.\n\n[Future Growth Estimates for Paysafe: Revenue, Earnings, Free Cash Flow](https://preview.redd.it/l1b95szu5l871.png?width=846&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=47be99144baa44f9f655f5a62f008d1deb7b8781)\n\nThe company will also become profitable by 2020. This may give them a bump in the stock price, but keep an eye for Q3 2020 results, by that time traders know if it makes sense to increase their positions.  Management has plenty of tricks to break profit, they can cut employees and ramp up marketing with cupons, discounts etc. This will affect margins - If they are reducing, then someone is spending more than they used to in order to get the same result!\n\nI personally watch EBIT margins, because they include Marketing and Development costs. Stay away from Gross Margins!\n\nAnd mind that fat pink line, that is Free Cash Flow, which means that in the future this can be a HIGH cash generating business. But not now, because it is young and must invest heavily in growth!\n\n# Risks:\n\nI keep seeing a lot of companies doing the same in FinTech: payments, e-banking, saving, cash transfers, investing, trading, you name it. **Not everyone will be a winner!** Think about spreading your bets. And if you go YOLO, at least understand the risks.\n\nCareful not to be early! According to my (SUBJECTIVE) estimates Paysafe is actually trading above intrinsic value, there is a chance that someone is just looking for bagholders.\n\n# Sentiment\n\nThis is what the short-term sentiment looks like for Paysafe based on options expiring 16 Jul 2020.\n\n[Call and Put Option contracts expiring 16 Jul 2020 for PSFE](https://preview.redd.it/q2ikqjz69l871.png?width=1184&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2d463c3b99b117f5b600fe9321a72a4e9e119702)\n\nSentiment is mostly positive, with a lot more calls than puts, but the price is not expected to move more than US$14 per share in the near term.\n\n# Final Word\n\nMy boss is considering sending me on a permanent vacation because he doesn't like the way I do DD (articles are too long and complicated). If you like my research please drop by my original article, a click is more than enough. \n\n[https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/software/nyse-psfe/paysafe/news/get-to-know-paysafe-nysepsfe-the-specialized-payment-process](https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/software/nyse-psfe/paysafe/news/get-to-know-paysafe-nysepsfe-the-specialized-payment-process)\n\nThank you for reading!",

        "selftext": "tl;dr: Katapult Holdings (KPLT) is one of the best values in the market today. It has a dirt cheap valuation vs. its peers, and the growth runway is massive. Long shares.\n\nPositions: [https://imgur.com/a/2XNBlIR](https://imgur.com/a/2XNBlIR)\n\nKatapult Holdings (KPLT) recently went public through a reverse merger. Katapult is a leading \"buy now, pay later\" (BNPL) player that provides financing options for non-prime customers. The newly merged company had its first quarterly earnings two weeks ago, and execution was solid. KPLT is profitable, growing quickly, and trading at a huge discount to other players in this field. I believe Katapult is a minimum $25 stock trading for $11.30. Keep reading if you want to know why.\n\nWhat Is Katapult?\n\nKatapult\u00a0provides BNPL options for non-prime Ecommerce customers. Katapult is the only pure-play financing platform dedicated to Ecommerce, as shown below:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Source: Initial Investor Presentation](https://preview.redd.it/qa445dlubt871.png?width=640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ba4d2945197d844da09bc643363a392ed5a7b446)\n\nAccording to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, 38% of US consumers are considered nonprime, making it difficult for these consumers to access financing options. Additionally, 67% of consumers with a FICO score below 700 need a BNPL option for large purchases. Katapult provides this solution for online customers. Katapult's platform integrates seamlessly to merchant sites, so customers can choose the financing option as they check out.\u00a0\n\nConsumers are given three payment options through Katapult:\n\n* **First 90 Days**  \n\n   * Customers only pay the cash price + a 5% fee.\n* **After 90 Days**  \n\n   * Customers can complete the purchase at a significant discount to the full lease-to-own cost.\n* **Full Lease Term**  \n\n   * Payment is \\~2x the lease origination amount over the life of the lease.\n\nKatapult is partnered with merchants such as Wayfair, Lenovo, Purple, and Motorola. The company also has partner integrations with Ecommerce platforms like Shopify, BigCommerce, and OpenCart. Katapult gives online platforms access to larger customer bases and higher repeat purchase rates (45%).\u00a0\n\nKatapult also uses a \"waterfall\" method to gain customers that failed prime lending applications. When consumers fail to get financing from prime lenders like Affirm, they are passed on to Katapult.\u00a0\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/w7yoo4q8dt871.png?width=640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=60119af069ce0040b2e3dd60d52f3b762062c936\n\n*Source: Investor Presentation*\n\nAs you can see from the graph above, Katapult approves \\~60% of consumers who failed prime lender applications. These \"waterfall\" applicants generate $117M incremental originations per 1M applications.\n\nKatapult's risk model reviews over 100 attributes, including lease history, prior payment behavior, and behavioral biometrics, to approve or deny applicants in under five seconds. The company has a sub-3% fraud rate across its portfolio, and it recovers 80- 90% of lease costs of charge offs.\n\nKatapult has also gotten more efficient as its platform has grown.\u00a0\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6215du0adt871.png?width=640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=54b9f4389e96859ea80392b89dbd511e1ebac78f\n\n*Source: Investor Presentation*\n\nIndexed return on leases have increased each year as Katapult's customer base has expanded.\n\nQ1 Performance\n\nAs mentioned earlier, Katapult went public through a reverse merger. Reverse mergers are notorious for providing and falling short of aggressive revenue projections. Here are Katapult's projections from December.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sxul07hddt871.png?width=1810&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=926f56b9ab9b9ded879ee0261b1d48c2947da230\n\n*Source: Investor Presentation*\n\nNow let's see how the company performed. Katapult released Q1 earnings yesterday. The company did $82M in revenue, up 88% year over year. Net income was $8.1M, or a 120% increase from Q1 last year. Adjusted EBITDA was $14.7M, good for a 122% increase over last year too.\n\nHow about forward guidance?\u00a0\n\n* Gross Originations: $375-$425 million\n* Revenue: $425-$475 million\n* Adjusted EBITDA: $50-$60 million\n\nWhile the EBITDA target dropped slightly, revenue and originations are in line with December's projections.\n\nRelationship with Wayfair\n\nOne metric that stood out to me was the acceleration of originations from non-Wayfair merchants. 58% of Katapult's revenue came from Wayfair in 2020. However, in Q1 2021, Non-Wayfair originations were up 87.4%. This is compared to a 66% increase in Q4 2020 and 46.1% for FY 2020. Meanwhile, Wayfair originations were up 57.7%. Recent execution suggests that Katapult is making great strides to diversify its revenue streams.\n\nWhile Wayfair is still the company's largest source of income, Katapult CEO Orlando Zayas is not concerned. In a recent interview, he said this about their parternship with Wayfair:\n\n\"*I\u2019m not worried about it because if you\u2019re going to have a partner to have high concentration right now, Wayfair is a great partner to have. So we\u2019re really thrilled with their relationship. And the relationship is pretty deep too. We\u2019re actually in the process of doing a direct integration with them so that, you know, the tentacles, if you will, within the company are a lot tighter, and then we have a two year agreement with them. \\[\u2026.\\] So, you know, am I worried about it? No, because it\u2019s a great retailer. And I think our relationship is very strong, but, you know, I would like to minimize it and have, you know, five or six Wayfairs and a bunch of other smaller ones.*\"\n\nWith Katapult hinting at a deeper partnership with the furniture retailer, and the company showing accelerated growth in its non-Wayfair base, I am not too concerned with the heavy revenue concentration.\n\nValuation Gap\n\nValuation is the driving factor in my Katapult bull thesis. The stock is dirt cheap. While several reverse mergers have priced deals at sky-high valuations, KPLT went public at a $1B valuation with $450M in 2021 revenue.\u00a0\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6ecqnpvgdt871.png?width=1866&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cab44cbf05afa5acfa3e340e7b5450d94418c68f\n\n*Source: Investor Presentation*\n\nThe graphic above comes from the December investor presentation. 14x EBITDA for a company growing sales, net income, and EBITDA at \\~100% for the last three years is great value by itself. When you compare this to other companies in the sector, Katapult looks criminally undervalued.\u00a0\n\nLet's look at the valuation gap now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7dkam6whdt871.png?width=1194&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9e7f5b9bf1d16f36b35a88217141b024f2ea3c65\n\nAt Tuesday's $11.37 price, Katapult was trading at 2.7x sales and 22.3x EBITDA. That's less than 1/3 of PayPal's (PYPL) revenue multiple and 1/2 of Paypal's EBITDA multiple, despite growing revenue 3x faster. When compared to Affirm (AFRM), a more direct competitor, the valuation gap is even larger. Push that valuation out to 2022, and KPLT is 8x EBITDA and 1.5x revenue. That's a value-stock price for a hypergrowth company.\n\n22.4x revenue for an unprofitable company growing at 40%, vs. 2.7x revenue for a profitable company growing at 65%. If Katapult went public through a traditional IPO, it would be worth over $2B right now. Because it used a reverse merger, sentiment around the stock has been poor.\n\nGrowth Prospects\n\nA study from Juniper Research suggests that BNPL transactions will grow from $226B in 2021 to $995B by 2026. 55% of Americans used a BNPL option as of March 2021, vs. just 37% in July 2020. There will be room for a lot of winners in this market, and Katapult will be one of them.\n\nKatapult is forecasting over $1B in revenue by 2023, and the company could beat this number if it keeps aggressively expanding to include new merchants. Katapult added 26 new retail partners in Q1 alone. Additionally, Katapult will benefit from the growth of its current partners like Wayfair.\n\nHere's the deal: there has been no sell-side coverage on this stock yet. When IBs start initiating coverage, it's going to moon. \"Price target $35 based on XYZ estimates\". You want to front run those releases. This a millionaire-making stock. When valuation is expensive, execution has to be perfect. When valuation is cheap? Any good news is a catalyst. I am giving you a $30 stock for $11. Don't miss it.\n\nRisks\n\nLike any investment, Katapult has its fair share of risks. The primary risk factors are:\n\n* Customer concentration\n* Credit risk from nonprime consumers\n* Competitors entering the nonprime market\n\nWhile Wayfair is still the company's largest customer, Katapult has been growing its non-Wayfair revenue base at an accelerating rate. Management assured investors that Wayfair would be a partner for a long time, so I don't foresee this risk causing any issues with business in the short term. Katapult has also been able to post consistent profits while dealing with nonprime customers, and its risk model has proven to be more accurate as the customer base expands. Finally, I don't see Affirm or another competitor taking market share from Katapult. KPLT has a multi-year head start in this market niche, and it has been able to scale its operations profitably. While other companies could enter this sector in the future, the total addressable market is large enough to accommodate multiple players.\u00a0\n\nConclusion\n\nStop chasing stocks that already peaked, and get in early for once. Katapult is a criminally undervalued stock given its growth rate and competitors' valuations, and I think it should be trading around $25 per share at the minimum. As we move further away from the reverse merger, Katapult will trade on its own merit, and I think the stock will appreciate accordingly. Assuming Katapult continues to scale its revenue and expand its customer base, I think the stock has a massive growth runway. I'm long shares, and I plan to hold them for a while.",

        "selftext": " You will see the full analysis below, but its a bit of a read, so here\u2019s the exec sum:\n\n* **Product:** Bill.com is a fintech platform that helps small and mid-sized businesses (SMBs) streamline and automate billing and payment processes that most SMBs still perform manually.\n* **Revenue model:** 49% fixed-fee recurring, 49% usage-based \u201crecurring in nature\u201d, 2% float interest.\n* **Market size:** $9 billion domestically, $30 billion globally. Strong pandemic-driven momentum.\n* **Go-to-market:** Direct and indirect via channel partners (most major accounting firms, accounting software providers and financial institutions).\n* **Competition:** Several competing solutions available, new challenger start-ups and competitors entering from adjacent market segments.\n* **M&amp;A:** Bill.com is in the process of acquiring spend management company Divvy for $2.5 billion ($625 million in cash, rest in shares). Divvy has $100 million in annual revenue, growing 100% YoY.\n* **Financials:** Strong financial performance based on high revenue growth, good customer retention and on-target operating efficiency. Company will need to prove ability to maintain growth while turning profitable.\n* **Valuation:** The total enterprise value (TEV) of $16.4 billion implies a TEV / NTM revenue multiple of 59x. Comparable companies are valued at 20x - 25x.\n* **Conclusion:** High-quality company with an excessive price tag. Share price likely to decline to market standard levels. Target PPS: $100 (-54%), in 6 - 12 months\n\n&amp;#8203;\n\n    Product \n\nInvoicing and payment processes can be messy and physical documents are prone to human error, which can lead to incorrect or delayed payments. This is where Bill.com comes into the picture. Its platform automatically fills out invoices or recognizes information on incoming invoices, including supplier details and payment amounts, reducing the time for data entry and the likelihood of manual errors.\n\nThe platform offers automated field entries, bill approval and payment. Then, it is synced with the accounting software such as QuickBooks for reconciliation of accounting entries and bookkeeping. The integration between Bill.com and the accounting software eliminates double entry and human errors.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8935sq7kpc971.png?width=640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=478cf108c612f0e3a11537bceaceca021fc1a693\n\nIts payment tools enable remote approval and automated payments to suppliers via ACH, wire transfers or PayPal. The company\u2019s bill payment feature enables customers to make electronic payments to suppliers outside the US and, compared to banks, the company\u2019s transaction fees are more competitive. For example, banks usually charge an average of $38 as wire transfers fee whereas Bill.com charges almost 4 times less with its International Payments solution, providing costs savings to its customers. According to the company, it offers payments options to over 130 countries with a supplier network of over 2.5 million.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2afv204lpc971.png?width=940&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=de1287971b64ee952f288b9ba858a407dee2787f\n\n    Revenue Model \n\nThe company earns revenues through **subscription** and **transaction fees** as well as **interest** on transactions held.\n\nIn the last quarter, which ended in March 2021, 49% of total revenues were recurring based on per user pricing for use of the platform as a fixed monthly or annual payment. Another 49% was transaction revenue, which represents usage-based fees collected for each transaction processed through the platform. The remaining 2% are float revenue, which is interest earned from customer funds while payment transactions are clearing.\n\nWhile 49% recurring revenue is very low compared to other SaaS businesses, it is fair to say that the other 49% transaction revenue are for the most part \u201crecurring in nature\u201d: A customer who only has access to the platform but does not have any transactions (let\u2019s say a payment of accounts payables), will not pay transaction fees. But customers have a certain number of transactions each month for which they will pay. The number of these may fluctuate to some degree, but for the most part, they can be seen as recurring.\n\n    Market Size \n\nIn 2018, there were approximately 30 million SMBs in the US. While 24 million of these SMBs are sole-proprietors, the company focuses on serving the over 6 million employer firms, because SMBs large enough to have employees tend to have a greater need for more advanced accounts payable and accounts receivable processes in their back offices.\n\nBy multiplying the average revenue per customer of $1,500 by the 6 million domestic employer firms and 20 million (sufficiently large) SMBs globally, the total annual addressable market for the company can be estimated at **$9 billion domestically** and **$30 billion worldwide**.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ss84shvlpc971.png?width=511&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3c2afb1c0a258ea700a0f2a3f81c0ab66f8fa40a\n\n    Go-To-Market \n\nBill.com acquires customers **directly** through digital marketing and inside sales, and **indirectly** through accounting firms and strategic partners including accounting software companies and financial institutions.\n\nIts partner base includes over 80 of the top 100 accounting firms in the US and several of the largest financial institutions, including **Bank of America, JPMorgan and American Express**. Bill.com\u2019s platform can be integrated with many of the major accounting software providers including companies such as **QuickBooks Online, Xero, Sage Intacct and Oracle NetSuite**, who dominate the accounting software market.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/o185frxmpc971.png?width=640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cd6508266264d04174de9d56ee2f298f73b3dfb9\n\nBill.com\u2019s integration with major accounting software and partnerships with financial institutions provides the company with an avenue to expand its market reach. However, the accounting software vendors could quickly turn from partners into competitors if they decide to provide similar services. Also, there is nothing stopping the partnered banks from collaborating with competitors in the future. On the contrary, it would be in the bank\u2019s and accounting firms\u2019 interests to work with several providers besides Bill.com.\n\n**To summarize,** the company\u2019s partnerships and integrations are valuable assets in its go-to-market approach. However, they are not a competitive moat.\n\n    Competition \n\nA range of other companies are offering good competing solutions. Differentiation can come from the breadth of the product offering or integrations with complementary systems like accounting, banking or ERP software.\n\nWith a user friendly and mature product, the company was well positioned to benefit from the move to digital that accelerated in 2020 and H1-2021 due to the pandemic. But while the company has an early-mover network advantage with various leading financial accounting software providers, financial institutions and accounting firms, competitive pressures are certain to increase in the future as various challenger companies are emerging and players from adjacent markets enter the competition to get a piece of the cake.\n\nFor example, payables automation solution provider **Tipalti**, who is valued at $2 billion. The company has stronger focus on enterprise customers and already counts player like Twitter, Twitch, Roblox, Roku, National Geographic, Business Insider and many other names to its customer base.\n\nAdditionally, cloud-based business spending management platform **Coupa** (COUP) has a TEV of $20 billion and is expected to generate ca. $540 million in revenue this year. Coupa provides companies control and visibility into how they spend money but also offers invoice automation and billing services similar to Bill.com\u2019s.\n\n    Divvy M&amp;A \n\nIn early June, Bill.com announced that it is going to acquired Divvy, a corporate spend management \u201cstartup\u201d. The total purchase price of around $2.5 billion is substantially above the company\u2019s roughly $1.6 billion post-money valuation that Divvy set in its January 2021 financing round. $625 million will be paid in cash, the remainder in shares.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8km8tvrnpc971.png?width=940&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d0cbc696d6ee515f192146887d4c31d0a66583fd\n\n**Divvy by the numbers:**\n\n* $100 million annualized revenue\n* \\&gt;100% revenue growth YoY\n* $4 billion annualized total payment volume (TPV)\n\nSo Divvy sold for around 25x its current revenue-run-rate and the growth rate tells us that the company did not sell due to performance weakness.\n\n**Strategic rationale for the acquisition**: Bill.com extends its platform with Divvy\u2019s complementary spend management capabilities and therefore expands its overall market opportunity by serving a larger share of the customer\u2019s spend. Additionally, buying a company with an attractive financial profile and high growth will drive Bill.com\u2019s own growth.\n\nDivvy seems to be a suitable acquisition target that will strengthen Bill.com strategically and financially. The company will be able to provide a more wholistic offering to its customers and capture a larger share of their wallet. As the company expands its market, competition will increase from incumbents like Brex, Ramp, Airbase, Coupa, Expensify and Spendesk.\n\n    Financials \n\nIn the [last available quarter](https://s24.q4cdn.com/404137088/files/doc_financials/2021/q3/BILL-IR-DECK-Q3'21-Final.pdf) (ending March 2021),\n\n* total revenue was $60 million, up 45% YoY,\n* gross margin was 74%, vs 76% in the same quarter previous year (PY),\n* free cash flow was ($6.2) million, vs ($2.1) million PY,\n* implying a FCF margin of (10%), vs (5%) PY,\n* its rule of 40 value was 34%,\n* its dollar based net retention rate was 121%, and\n* its CAC payback period was 10 months\n\nLet\u2019s compare that with the average cloud software company in the SaaS index:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1iv78tlopc971.png?width=847&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b155a4b9a6381fbe86275c0dde55594d8d25c9ee\n\n* **Growth:** Bill.com is growing quite a bit faster than the average. This is important because growth is what investors pay the highest price for\n* **Gross margin:** Pretty much on par with the market\n* **FCF margin:** The free cash flow is notably lower than that of most other SaaS companies, as Bill.com is still burning cash to drive growth\n* **Rule of 40:** As a result of the negative profitability, its rule of 40 value is below average. Nevertheless, 34% is a decent value\n* **Net retention:** With 121%, the company is a little above average and shows a healthy ability of retaining and growing existing customers\n* **CAC Payback period:** The relatively low value of 10 months is good for the company and is likely a bi-product from the market moving from manual to digital, which means that the company is winning customers even without massively increasing sales and marketing spending\n* **Cash:** As of March 2021, Bill.com has almost $800 million in net cash on the balance sheet. $625 million of that will be used to pay for the acquisition of Divvy, leaving $175 million in net cash\n\n**In summary,** financials are very good driven by a strong tailwind from the market bringing customers to its doorstep. At the moment, the company seems to focus on keeping growth as high as possible at the expense of profitability. This is the smart thing to do in order to capture market share in a time when every SMB is looking for an automated bookkeeping solution. With $175 million in available net cash and a quarterly cash burn of $6.2 million, Bill.com has sufficient runway left. Nevertheless, the company will soon need to show investors the ability to turn profitable while maintaining a high growth rate.\n\n    Valuation \n\nAs of Friday\u2019s close, Bill.com has a total enterprise value of **$16.4 billion**. Based on estimated NTM revenues of $279 million (including the quarter that ended this week), this represents an astronomic TEV / NTM revenue multiple of **59x.**\n\nThe charts below show an index of cloud software companies, mapping their performance metrics (e.g. growth) against their valuation (TEV/NTM revenue multiple). You can see clear correlations. Think of it as\n\n&gt;**\u201cFor a company with x% of expected revenue growth, the market usually pays a valuation (multiple) of y\u201d.**\n\nPlus / minus some variation.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nq5q7knppc971.png?width=1106&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=58f7c46ff09d63841e5b34303fcc6b9aaba9a153\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rnq5a8dqpc971.png?width=1107&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=232cbb8b459ee530452d16645dfdc32e18f176bf\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i4nu4bfrpc971.png?width=1111&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8b959d9fb139c6135a0ca1de15298f7fc141c2de\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/su5jtegspc971.png?width=1110&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0ea09b404999e49a2fd28427bfd30298d4b32a75\n\nBill.com is a strong outlier on each of these charts. What does that tell us:\n\n* **Growth:** The market generally pays higher valuations for companies with higher growth. However, there are several companies growing as fast as Bill.com or even faster, which trade at lower valuations.\n* **Net retention:** The market generally pays higher valuations for companies with higher net retention rates. However, there are several companies with net retention rates as good or even better than that of Bill.com, but which trade at lower valuations.\n* \u2026\n\nYou get the idea.\n\nThe company\u2019s performance metrics are strong, there\u2019s no question about that. But there are numerous examples of companies with similar or better performance metrics which trade at cheaper prices.\n\n**In summary,** based on Bill.com\u2019s KPIs and the valuations that investors pay for such performance, the company should trade at a lower price.\n\n    Conclusion \n\nBill.com\u2019s bookkeeping automation software provides convenience, improved efficiency and cost-effectiveness to a broad customers base. The market it operates in has a significant size and is in the middle of a momentum from manual to digital &amp; automated. With top tier channel partners and a range of accounting and banking integrations, the company is well positioned to capture and capitalize on the increasing demand.\n\nThe acquisition of Divvy will add complementary features to its current product offering and strengthen stickiness with customers. Yet the possibilities for differentiation through technology are limited and competition will increase significantly in the medium term through both new challengers and adjacent incumbents.\n\nSoft factors and hard factors look positive and, per se, I am bullish about the company and the direction in which it is going. Nevertheless, Bill.com\u2019s valuation is too high. Companies with similar profiles are trading at **20x - 25x NTM revenue**. This means that Bill.com has a more than **100% premium valuation** to the market standard. Is this justified by a superior product offering, exclusive partnership agreements or a brand name? It doesn\u2019t seem this way.\n\n**How to play this**\n\n* **Long:** What needs to happen for the price to go up further?  \n\n   * The company must continue to execute and grow as expected by the market\n   * The macro environment (interest rates etc.) must keep stable\n   * The valuation multiple must stay at a premium of 100% over comps\n* **Short:** What could happen for the price to go down?  \n\n   * Commoditization of bookkeeping automation software which leads to price competition, lower revenue per customer and decreasing growth\n   * Rising inflation causes earlier interest rate increases, which usually hits high-growth software companies the hardest\n   * Contraction of Bill.com\u2019s valuation multiple towards market standards\n   * Major post-merger integration difficulties\n\nIt seems most likely that the company will continue to perform well, but that its valuation multiple will contract to a more market standard level, leading to a decline in share price.\n\nHowever, we cannot say exactly when this will happen and it is of course possible that the share price will continue to increase over the next few weeks. The target share price based on fundamentals is \\~$100, representing a 54% downside, which is realistically achievable over the next 6 - 12 months.\n\nFrom a portfolio-management perspective, adding a short position in an overvalued company can decrease the overall risk of the portfolio: In volatile times, gains in your short positions can (partially) offset losses in your long positions.",

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, July 22, 2021**\n\nStocks edged higher today in a very volatile session, with the three main indexes (S&amp;P 500 (SPY), Nasdaq (QQQ), Dow Jones (DIA) falling at open before reversing to the upside mid-session, a sign that market participants remain eager to buy up any dip. On the other hand, the Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, broke its two day rally, trading 1.75% lower at the time of writing. Market participants continue to weight a variety of factors, including but not limited to: (1) faster-than-expected pace of economic recovery, (2) surging corporate earnings, (3) potential inflationary pressures, (4) labor market imbalances, and (5) concerns surrounding the coronavirus delta variant. Basically, the market is balancing between expectations for rapid economic expansion moving forward and concerns surrounding inflation and the delta variant.\n\nToday, the Labor Department released the Weekly Unemployment report, which unfortunately, showed an unexpected rise in new jobless claims filed. New jobless claims jumped to 419,000, well above consensus estimates of 360,000 and a sharp jump from the previous week, which showed pandemic-era lows in claims filed. Since the beginning of the pandemic, market participants have closely tracked these numbers in order to gauge the health of the labor market. However, with rising infections threatening to trigger new restrictions, labor market reports have taken on more importance than usual.\n\nIn the US, despite roughly 50% of the population being vaccinated, in the past two weeks, infections across the country have roughly doubled, with cases jumping from 13,200 on July 4 to 32,300 on July 18, according to data compiled by John Hopkins University. However, as I said yesterday, it is important to understand that the rising infections are broadly concentrated in areas with higher vaccine hesitancy. According to data from the CDC, 97% of people who have died or been hospitalized with COVID-19 since the vaccine became widely available are unvaccinated. Dr Rochelle Walensky, Director of CDC said of the rising cases, \u201cThere is a clear message that is coming through. This is becoming a pandemic of the unvaccinated. Our biggest concern is we are going to continue to see preventable cases, hospitalizations, and sadly deaths among the unvaccinated.\u201d Sadly, despite the widespread availability of the vaccine in the US, hesitancy in certain places remains very high.\n\nIn other news, Q2 earnings season continues full steam ahead, with the quarter shaping up to be another record-setting one. Earnings are expected to be super-charged by higher than expected demand from savings-laden consumers as the economy reopens. While concerns around the delta variant have put a damper on sentiment, reports by companies have not reflected any slowdown in growth. So far, analysts are looking for S&amp;P 500 earnings to grow by 61.9% year-on-year in aggregate, according to FactSet data \u2013 an estimate UBS's Head of Equity Derivatives Research Stuart Kaiser said may still be \"need to be revised higher.\" \n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Shares of Twitter (TWTR) skyrocketed after-hours after the company reported better than expected earnings and raised guidance moving forward.\n* Shares of Domino\u2019s Pizza (DPZ) skyrocketed after smashing earnings estimates and announcing a new share buyback program\n* US Senators introduced a bill that would amend Section 230, the well-known law that gives social media companies immunity from what users post on their platform, to hold companies liable for health-related misinformation.\n* Websites of several airlines, banks and technology companies, including Amazon's AWS, Delta Air Lines (DAL) and American Express (AXP), were facing outages, according to DownDetector. So far, I\u2019ve been unable to find the cause.\n* Bank of America (BAC) on Wednesday said its board approved a 17% increase to the company's quarterly cash dividend.\n* U antitrust regulators are set to give unconditional approval to Irish aircraft leasing company AerCap's (AER) $30 billion bid for General Electric's (GE) aircraft leasing business, three people familiar with the matter said.\n* Ford (F), startup Argo AI, and Lyft (LYFT) are reportedly working together to launch a self-driving ride-hailing service in Miami, Florida and Austin, Texas later this year. At first, there will be a safety driver behind the wheel but reportedly want fully automated robotaxis by 2022 or 2023.\n* **\\*\\*Please note that current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect closing prices\\*\\***\n* Ally Financial (ALLY) target raised by Citigroup from $59 to $63 at Buy.

As he cruised down the highway with friend and fellow entrepreneur Adeo Ressi, the question came up:\n\nWhat was Musk going to do next?\n\n\"I told Adeo I had always been interested in space, but I didn't think that was something a private individual could do anything about,\" Musk relates to Eric Berger, author of the new book [*Liftoff: Elon Musk and the Desperate Early Days That Launched SpaceX*](https://www.amazon.com/Liftoff-Desperate-Early-Launched-SpaceX/dp/0062979973)*.* Still thinking about the conversation later that day, Musk checked out NASA's website, looking for plans for humans going to Mars.\n\nHe didn't find any.\n\nSo, after taking some time to study the subject a bit more in-depth, Musk came up with his own.\n\nWhat follows in *Liftoff* is a crazy (and fascinating) journey of how Musk built a company meant to try to solve some very complex problems.\n\nAnd while most aspiring entrepreneurs aren't trying to tackle the challenge of interstellar travel, they can still learn quite a bit from Berger's behind-the-scenes look at the early days of SpaceX, one that [Musk himself has endorsed.](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1380480918243090433)\n\nHere are a few key lessons, just from the first chapter.\n\n**Don't start with a product. Start with a problem**\n\nSpaceX didn't start off building its own rockets. In fact, in the early days, Musk and his advisers traveled to Russia (twice) to try to buy a refurbished intercontinental ballistic missile.\n\nThe problem, writes Berger, was the Russians had no respect for Musk. In their eyes, Musk had no idea what he was getting himself into. So, they offered him their rockets at a ridiculous markup.\n\n\"I wondered what it would take to build our own rocket,\" said Musk.\n\nA few years later, Musk and SpaceX had done just that.\n\n**Do your research, first**\n\nMusk needed to prove he was serious. An avid student, Musk already had Ivy League degrees in economics and physics. He applied that student's mentality to his new area of focus.\n\n\"\\[Musk\\] had been reading everything he could get his hands on about rockets, from old Soviet technical manuals to John Drury Clark's iconic book on propellants, *Ignition!* \" writes Berger. Further, Musk knew full well that other entrepreneurs had dabbled in rocket science and failed. So he studied what they had done, learning from their mistakes so as to avoid repeating them.\n\nNow, Musk was ready to start meeting with rocket scientists. All the while, he continued that \"learn-it-all\" mindset, asking good questions and listening intently for the answers.\n\n**Embrace challenges**\n\nMusk's original plan was to inspire the public, leading to more funding for NASA. But the more Musk learned, the more he realized that NASA had its own problems beyond funding.\n\n\"I began to understand why things were so expensive,\" said Musk. \"I looked at the horses that NASA had in the stable. And with horses like Boeing and Lockheed, you're screwed. Those horses are lame. I knew Mars Oasis would not be enough.\"\n\nSo, Musk began to think bigger.\n\nIf Musk could bring down the cost of space travel, there would be more opportunities. And if SpaceX could cut through the red tape that plagued NASA, it could help pave the way to pursue those opportunities.\n\nNot everyone was as enthusiastic.\n\nBerger relates how the following spring Musk called a meeting of about 15 or 20 prominent aerospace engineers. The engineers had been encouraged to attend by Mike Griffin, a leader in the field who would later become the administrator of NASA.\n\n\"\\[Musk\\] walks in and basically announces that he wants to start his own rocket company,\" relates Chris Thompson, an aerospace engineer who was advising Musk. \"And I do remember a lot of chuckling, some laughter, people saying things like, 'Save your money, kid, and go sit on the beach.'\"\n\nBut Musk wouldn't give up easily.\n\n\"Musk searched among the doubters to find the few believers,\" writes Berger. \"Musk wanted people who embraced a challenge rather than shrank from it, optimists rather than pessimists.\"\n\nIt didn't take long, and Musk found those optimists.\n\nHe offered five people the opportunity to join SpaceX's founding team; two accepted: Chris Thompson and a rising star in rocket engines, Tom Mueller.\n\n**Make employees owners**\n\nAs SpaceX's employee count grew, Musk wanted to leverage those employees' sense of ownership. \"Because they were spending his money, Musk gave employees an incentive to be frugal with it,\" explains Berger.\n\n\"Early hires received large chunks of stock,\" he writes. \"When an employee saved the company $100,000 by building a part in-house instead of ordering one from a traditional supplier, everyone benefited.\"\n\nWhat followed was a team building a culture of doing huge things with as little resources as possible.\n\nOf course, not every new business owner is already a millionaire, like Musk was when he began [building SpaceX](https://www.inc.com/jason-aten/spacex-just-blew-up-a-200-million-rocket-elon-musks-response-was-a-brilliant-example-of-emotional-intelligence.html?cid=search).\n\nBut almost everyone can take advantage of the lessons Musk demonstrated in those early days of SpaceX:\n\n1. Don't start with a product. Start with a problem.\n\n2. Do your research, first.\n\n3. Embrace challenges.\n\n4. Make employees owners.\n\nDo this right, and you'll increase the chances your business has at success--and eventually even turn some of the doubters into believers.",

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, July 9, 2021**\n\nThe stock market pulled a remarkable turnaround today, shaking off yesterday\u2019s declines with the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) rocketing to another record intraday high, led by the financial and energy sectors, which had been lagging as of late and continued strength in mega-cap tech stocks. It seems that after a brief flare up of concerns regarding the coronavirus delta variant and a potential acceleration of the timeline to taper quantitative easing in the US, fears have greatly tempered. At the time of writing, the Dow Jones (DIA) rose 1.27% while the Nasdaq (QQQ) rose 0.6% and is very slightly below it\u2019s all-time high. The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, led the day, rising more than 2%.\n\nIn recent weeks, market participants are increasingly trying to gauge if the surge we are seeing in the more contagious coronavirus delta variant will weigh on global growth rates. Yesterday, it seems concerns came to a head after the Japanese government made a last minute announcement that a state of emergency would be re-instituted across Tokyo and that all events would take place behind closed doors, with no spectators, walking back an earlier decision to allow locals to attend the games. The state of emergency will begin on Monday and run through Aug. 22, while the games are scheduled from July 23 to Aug. 8. On Wednesday, 16 days before the Opening Ceremony, the [Tokyo Metropolitan Government reported 920 COVID cases](https://stopcovid19.metro.tokyo.lg.jp/en), over 200 more than any other single-day total since May. On Thursday, it reported 896, the second-highest count since May. Other countries, like India and Brazil, are also dealing with an extremely worrying surge of cases. Even in the US, where roughly 50% of those eligible are fully vaccinated, the country is seeing a small surge in cases recently, with the delta variant accounting for 51.7% of all new infections, according to the CDC. According to reports, as of yesterday, only 16.8% of the Japanese population was vaccinated against the virus. \n\nIn other news, in another move that raised concerns about the global growth rate, China\u2019s central bank signalled it will be cutting the amount of cash that banks must hold in reserve, a move that suggests the economic recovery in China may be slowing down. The People\u2019s Bank of China (PBOC) will reduce the reserve requirement ratio by 0.5 percentage point for most banks, according to a [statement](http://www.pbc.gov.cn/goutongjiaoliu/113456/113469/4287599/index.html) published Friday. That will unleash about 1 trillion yuan ($154 billion) of long-term liquidity into the economy and will be effective on July 15, the central bank said. The reduction was signaled earlier this week, when the State Council, China\u2019s equivalent of a cabinet, hinted the central bank would make more liquidity available to banks so they could lend to smaller firms hurt by rising costs. The timing and magnitude of the move, coming a week before second-quarter growth data, suggests worries about the economy\u2019s outlook and was a decisive shift away from policy tightening, which most, if not all, recovering economies are pursuing.\n\nKen Cheung, Chief Asian Foreign Exchange Strategist at Mizuho, said \u201cThe PBOC came in broader and sooner than expected, highlighting the policy urgency to support the Chinese economy. Such firm easing measures could further fuel concern over China\u2019s growth outlook in the second half as well as the upcoming Q2 GDP figures in the coming week\u201d. Just to put into more familiar terms, this would be like if the Federal Reserve suddenly turned around and said rather than discussing tapering quantitative easing, it would instead propose pumping more money into the economy.\n\nWhile these global concerns did jitter the market yesterday, the impressive recovery in US equities underscores the remarkable strength of its economy, as the country continues reopening thanks to effective distribution of the vaccine, with 48% of the population fully vaccinated, according to the CDC. In my opinion, while the delta variant does pose a risk to global growth rates, and the market may react negatively to headlines about it, the foundations of the recovery in the US (i.e nation-wide reopening measures, a rapidly improving labor market, record earnings from companies, and a high level of savings among Americans) are very strong and will continue to underpin a bull market here. \n\n**Highlights** \n\n* The recent sell-off in crude oil recovered, with the West Texas intermediate crude oil futures settling higher by 2.2% to $74.56 per barrel at the time of writing.\n* Apple (AAPL), the largest company in the world, reached a new all-time high today. \n* President Biden is expected to sign an executive agreement ordering the Federal Trade Commission to limit or ban noncompete agreements, unnecessary occupational licenses, and revise guidance for sharing wage information between the HR department and workers and other employers. \n* Tesla (TSLA), Brookfield Asset Management (BAM) said Friday they would work together on a new initiative to create the nation's most sustainable residential community. The companies said the provisionally named SunHouse at Easton Park in Austin, Texas, would be the first Tesla Solar neighborhood.\n* On Monday, a trial will kick off in the Court of Chancery in Wilmington, Delaware between Elon Musk and shareholders. The plaintiffs alleged that Musk used his control at Tesla to force the company to buy SolarCity for $2.6 billion in order to protect his investment in the company from bankruptcy and want Musk to pay that money back to Tesla. IMO seems a little weird to me to sue about this given that SolarCity has proven to be a good acquisition for Tesla.\n* Apple (AAPL) is reportedly in early talks with the NFL to buy the rights to stream Sunday Night games for their streaming service. A while ago, Amazon (AMZN) bought the right to stream Thursday NFL games for Prime Video. \n* Marvel\u2019s \u201cBlack Widow, opened in theaters last night and is expected to be the biggest opening since 2019, with the film projected to bring around $80 million domestically. This is huge and a sign that Americans' appetite to go to movie-theaters is very real. Personally, I\u2019m going to go watch in the theaters this weekend. \n* Foxconn, a well known supplier for Apple, is discussing plans with Fisker (FSR) to open a factory to build EV\u2019s in Wisconsin. In a statement, the company said, \u201cFoxconn has engaged the Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation (WEDC) to discuss the company's plans for electric vehicle manufacturing. Foxconn is optimistic about our partnership with WEDC and looks forward to ongoing discussions\n* **\\*\\*Please note that current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect closing prices\\*\\***\n* Aptiv (APTV) target raised by Jefferies Financial from $170 to $182 at Buy.

        "selftext": "One thing I have learned in life is savings are really important for you and your future. That is why I started to focus on building two big savings account since I was 13, so I should worry less and don\u2019t stress as much in the future. I had savings account focusing on investing into something I could live in, one day near the future and the other one, was for educational purposes. \nSince B..coin exploded, there has been made several millions of coins and everybody is hoping for the next Coin to take off soon. And I was one of those. I started investing into different cryptos and stocks and it always gave such a rush when you can see your graph going up and the daily profit margin is green. However, this did not go as planned. I saw the profit margin turning negative for each day there would go and I just though the market would regulate soon to normal again so I began investing more and more for each there would go. This led to, I was suddenly all in with both of my savings accounts and I lost about 50% percent already. I wanted to sell some off because I am going on vacation with my two kids on Wednesday next week, so I could finance the expenses on the trip. This was here in this weekend, that everything went wrong. I sold privately and got hacked and loosing about 95% percent of my capital and leaving me with around 600 dollars. I do not got anything left. Just a story tip so you are going to be aware of hackers and the FOMO can be harsh. Everything now has been set on standby with my vacation with my children due to I don\u2019t afford it anymore. However, I hope it is okay that my PayPal link is in this, so if anyone wants to donate something, feel free to. Thank you.\n\nhttps://www.paypal.me/TripExpenses",

        "selftext": "You will see the full analysis is below, but its a bit of a read, so here\u2019s the exec sum:\n\n* **Product:** Bill.com is a fintech platform that helps small and mid-sized businesses (SMBs) streamline and automate billing and payment processes that most SMBs still perform manually.\n* **Revenue model:** 49% fixed-fee recurring, 49% usage-based \u201crecurring in nature\u201d, 2% float interest.\n* **Market size:** $9 billion domestically, $30 billion globally. Strong pandemic-driven momentum.\n* **Go-to-market:** Direct and indirect via channel partners (most major accounting firms, accounting software providers and financial institutions).\n* **Competition:** Several competing solutions available, new challenger start-ups and competitors entering from adjacent market segments.\n* **M&amp;A:** Bill.com is in the process of acquiring spend management company Divvy for $2.5 billion ($625 million in cash, rest in shares). Divvy has $100 million in annual revenue, growing 100% YoY.\n* **Financials:** Strong financial performance based on high revenue growth, good customer retention and on-target operating efficiency. Company will need to prove ability to maintain growth while turning profitable.\n* **Valuation:** The total enterprise value (TEV) of $16.4 billion implies a TEV / NTM revenue multiple of 59x. Comparable companies are valued at 20x - 25x.\n* **Conclusion:** High-quality company with an excessive price tag. Share price likely to decline to market standard levels. Target PPS: $100 (-54%), in 6 - 12 months\n\n&amp;#8203;\n\n    Product\n\nInvoicing and payment processes can be messy and physical documents are prone to human error, which can lead to incorrect or delayed payments. This is where Bill.com comes into the picture. Its platform automatically fills out invoices or recognizes information on incoming invoices, including supplier details and payment amounts, reducing the time for data entry and the likelihood of manual errors. \n\nThe platform offers automated field entries, bill approval and payment. Then, it is synced with the accounting software such as QuickBooks for reconciliation of accounting entries and bookkeeping. The integration between Bill.com and the accounting software eliminates double entry and human errors.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7la5vq1ko6971.png?width=640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4a6241f9450e679671a41a208182baf8f09db382\n\nIts payment tools enable remote approval and automated payments to suppliers via ACH, wire transfers or PayPal. The company\u2019s bill payment feature enables customers to make electronic payments to suppliers outside the US and, compared to banks, the company\u2019s transaction fees are more competitive. For example, banks usually charge an average of $38 as wire transfers fee whereas Bill.com charges almost 4 times less with its International Payments solution, providing costs savings to its customers. According to the company, it offers payments options to over 130 countries with a supplier network of over 2.5 million.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1ww7n98mo6971.png?width=940&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6f2207c351aaf4bda3538bce5e102494b2f12e9e\n\n    Revenue Model\n\nThe company earns revenues through **subscription** and **transaction fees** as well as **interest** on transactions held. \n\nIn the last quarter, which ended in March 2021, 49% of total revenues were recurring based on per user pricing for use of the platform as a fixed monthly or annual payment. Another 49% was transaction revenue, which represents usage-based fees collected for each transaction processed through the platform. The remaining 2% are float revenue, which is interest earned from customer funds while payment transactions are clearing.\n\nWhile 49% recurring revenue is very low compared to other SaaS businesses, it is fair to say that the other 49% transaction revenue are for the most part \u201crecurring in nature\u201d: A customer who only has access to the platform but does not have any transactions (let\u2019s say a payment of accounts payables), will not pay transaction fees. But customers have a certain number of transactions each month for which they will pay. The number of these may fluctuate to some degree, but for the most part, they can be seen as recurring.\n\n    Market Size\n\nIn 2018, there were approximately 30 million SMBs in the US. While 24 million of these SMBs are sole-proprietors, the company focuses on serving the over 6 million employer firms, because SMBs large enough to have employees tend to have a greater need for more advanced accounts payable and accounts receivable processes in their back offices.\n\nBy multiplying the average revenue per customer of $1,500 by the 6 million domestic employer firms and 20 million (sufficiently large) SMBs globally, the total annual addressable market for the company can be estimated at **$9 billion domestically** and **$30 billion worldwide**. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dak02nipo6971.png?width=511&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fb908e47cb36807e70d4abf6e4bde08574c17847\n\n    Go-To-Market\n\nBill.com acquires customers **directly** through digital marketing and inside sales, and **indirectly** through accounting firms and strategic partners including accounting software companies and financial institutions.\n\nIts partner base includes over 80 of the top 100 accounting firms in the US and several of the largest financial institutions, including **Bank of America, JPMorgan and American Express**. Bill.com\u2019s platform can be integrated with many of the major accounting software providers including companies such as **QuickBooks Online, Xero, Sage Intacct and Oracle NetSuite**, who dominate the accounting software market.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2mngq1kro6971.png?width=640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0ec0c3351e1711f983e90a735c6b2dcedd8cbdc8\n\nBill.com\u2019s integration with major accounting software and partnerships with financial institutions provides the company with an avenue to expand its market reach. However, the accounting software vendors could quickly turn from partners into  competitors if they decide to provide similar services. Also, there is nothing stopping the partnered banks from collaborating with competitors in the future. On the contrary, it would be in the bank\u2019s and accounting firms\u2019 interests to work with several providers besides Bill.com.\n\n**To summarize,** the company\u2019s partnerships and integrations are valuable assets in its go-to-market approach. However, they are not a competitive moat.\n\n    Competition\n\nA range of other companies are offering good competing solutions. Differentiation can come from the breadth of the product offering or integrations with complementary systems like accounting, banking or ERP software.\n\nWith a user friendly and mature product, the company was well positioned to benefit from the move to digital that accelerated in 2020 and H1-2021 due to the pandemic. But while the company has an early-mover network advantage with various leading financial accounting software providers, financial institutions and accounting firms, competitive pressures are certain to increase in the future as various challenger companies are emerging and players from adjacent markets enter the competition to get a piece of the cake.\n\nFor example, payables automation solution provider **Tipalti**, who is valued at $2 billion. The company has stronger focus on enterprise customers and already counts player like Twitter, Twitch, Roblox, Roku, National Geographic, Business Insider and many other names to its customer base.\n\nAdditionally, cloud-based business spending management platform **Coupa** (COUP) has a TEV of $20 billion and is expected to generate ca. $540 million in revenue this year. Coupa provides companies control and visibility into how they spend money but also offers invoice automation and billing services similar to Bill.com\u2019s.\n\n    Divvy M&amp;A\n\nIn early June, Bill.com announced that it is going to acquired Divvy, a corporate spend management \u201cstartup\u201d. The total purchase price of around $2.5 billion is substantially above the company\u2019s roughly $1.6 billion post-money valuation that Divvy set in its January 2021 financing round. $625 million will be paid in cash, the remainder in shares.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/plhkwgmvo6971.png?width=940&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b98691049600f9944ca9cdfe880b58363ffa919d\n\n**Divvy by the numbers:**\n\n* $100 million annualized revenue\n* \\&gt;100% revenue growth YoY\n* $4 billion annualized total payment volume (TPV)\n\nSo Divvy sold for around 25x its current revenue-run-rate and the growth rate tells us that the company did not sell due to performance weakness.\n\n**Strategic rationale for the acquisition**: Bill.com extends its platform with Divvy\u2019s complementary spend management capabilities and therefore expands its overall market opportunity by serving a larger share of the customer\u2019s spend. Additionally, buying a company with an attractive financial profile and high growth will drive Bill.com\u2019s own growth.\n\nDivvy seems to be a suitable acquisition target that will strengthen Bill.com strategically and financially. The company will be able to provide a more wholistic offering to its customers and capture a larger share of their wallet. As the company expands its market, competition will increase from incumbents like Brex, Ramp, Airbase, Coupa, Expensify and Spendesk. \n\n    Financials\n\nIn the [last available quarter](https://s24.q4cdn.com/404137088/files/doc_financials/2021/q3/BILL-IR-DECK-Q3'21-Final.pdf) (ending March 2021), \n\n* total revenue was $60 million, up 45% YoY,\n* gross margin was 74%, vs 76% in the same quarter previous year (PY),\n* free cash flow was ($6.2) million, vs ($2.1) million PY,\n* implying a FCF margin of (10%), vs (5%) PY,\n* its rule of 40 value was 34%,\n* its dollar based net retention rate was 121%, and\n* its CAC payback period was 10 months\n\nLet\u2019s compare that with the average cloud software company in the SaaS index:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fnqk1b4zo6971.png?width=847&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3749022f6924fa4d21c14ffeb3952ebd59b47772\n\n* **Growth:** Bill.com is growing quite a bit faster than the average. This is important because growth is what investors pay the highest price for\n* **Gross margin:** Pretty much on par with the market\n* **FCF margin:** The free cash flow is notably lower than that of most other SaaS companies, as Bill.com is still burning cash to drive growth\n* **Rule of 40:** As a result of the negative profitability, its rule of 40 value is below average. Nevertheless, 34% is a decent value\n* **Net retention:** With 121%, the company is a little above average and shows a healthy ability of retaining and growing existing customers\n* **CAC Payback period:** The relatively low value of 10 months is good for the company and is likely a bi-product from the market moving from manual to digital, which means that the company is winning customers even without massively increasing sales and marketing spending\n* **Cash:** As of March 2021, Bill.com has almost $800 million in net cash on the balance sheet. $625 million of that will be used to pay for the acquisition of Divvy, leaving $175 million in net cash\n\n**In summary,** financials are very good driven by a strong tailwind from the market bringing customers to its doorstep. At the moment, the company seems to focus on keeping growth as high as possible at the expense of profitability. This is the smart thing to do in order to capture market share in a time when every SMB is looking for an automated bookkeeping solution. With $175 million in available net cash and a quarterly cash burn of $6.2 million, Bill.com has sufficient runway left. Nevertheless, the company will soon need to show investors the ability to turn profitable while maintaining a high growth rate.\n\n    Valuation\n\nAs of Friday\u2019s close, Bill.com has a total enterprise value of **$16.4 billion**. Based on estimated NTM revenues of $279 million (including the quarter that ended this week), this represents an astronomic TEV / NTM revenue multiple of **59x.**\n\nThe charts below show an index of cloud software companies, mapping their performance metrics (e.g. growth) against their valuation (TEV/NTM revenue multiple). You can see clear correlations. Think of it as \n\n&gt;**\u201cFor a company with x% of expected revenue growth, the market usually pays a valuation (multiple) of y\u201d.**\n\nPlus / minus some variation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wxanaow3p6971.png?width=1106&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f2deaa46b9aab2670fde6a252106c072ef7a0099\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9q10jph4p6971.png?width=1107&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=04aca47233cf88f485b371d61a3926dda21f7a48\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jze3qu25p6971.png?width=1111&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ee4e4ea334114efbd80e6ec432df1808f9b5991b\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lydm9pt5p6971.png?width=1110&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=04911cefd4e09da2cdb4c8bb9be9aa5752f04464\n\nBill.com is a strong outlier on each of these charts. What does that tell us: \n\n* **Growth:** The market generally pays higher valuations for companies with higher growth. However, there are several companies growing as fast as Bill.com or even faster, which trade at lower valuations.\n* **Net retention:** The market generally pays higher valuations for companies with higher net retention rates. However, there are several companies with net retention rates as good or even better than that of Bill.com, but which trade at lower valuations.\n* \u2026\n\nYou get the idea.\n\nThe company\u2019s performance metrics are strong, there\u2019s no question about that. But there are numerous examples of companies with similar or better performance metrics which trade at cheaper prices.\n\n**In summary,** based on Bill.com\u2019s KPIs and the valuations that investors pay for such performance, the company should trade at a lower price.\n\n    Conclusion\n\nBill.com\u2019s bookkeeping automation software provides convenience, improved efficiency and cost-effectiveness to a broad customers base. The market it operates in has a significant size and is in the middle of a momentum from manual to digital &amp; automated. With top tier channel partners and a range of accounting and banking integrations, the company is well positioned to capture and capitalize on the increasing demand. \n\nThe acquisition of Divvy will add complementary features to its current product offering and strengthen stickiness with customers. Yet the possibilities for differentiation through technology are limited and competition will increase significantly in the medium term through both new challengers and adjacent incumbents.\n\nSoft factors and hard factors look positive and, per se, I am bullish about the company and the direction in which it is going. Nevertheless, Bill.com\u2019s valuation is too high. Companies with similar profiles are trading at **20x - 25x NTM revenue**. This means that Bill.com has a more than **100% premium valuation** to the market standard. Is this justified by a superior product offering, exclusive partnership agreements or a brand name? It doesn\u2019t seem this way.\n\n**How to play this**\n\n* **Long:** What needs to happen for the price to go up further?   \n\n   * The company must continue to execute and grow as expected by the market\n   * The macro environment (interest rates etc.) must keep stable\n   * The valuation multiple must stay at a premium of 100% over comps\n* **Short:** What could happen for the price to go down?  \n\n   * Commoditization of bookkeeping automation software which leads to price competition, lower revenue per customer and decreasing growth\n   * Rising inflation causes earlier interest rate increases, which usually hits high-growth software companies the hardest\n   * Contraction of Bill.com\u2019s valuation multiple towards market standards\n   * Major post-merger integration difficulties\n\nIt seems most likely that the company will continue to perform well, but that its valuation multiple will contract to a more market standard level, leading to a decline in share price. \n\nHowever, we cannot say exactly when this will happen and it is of course possible that the share price will continue to increase over the next few weeks. The target share price based on fundamentals is \\~$100, representing a 54% downside, which is realistically achievable over the next 6 - 12 months.\n\nFrom a portfolio-management perspective, adding a short position in an overvalued company can decrease the overall risk of the portfolio: In volatile times, gains in your short positions can (partially) offset losses in your long positions.",

        "selftext": "Disclaimers: I got paid to write the original article, I don't own the stock and this is obviously not financial advice\n\n# Key Points\n\n**Paysafe Limited** $PSFE is a payment processor and is not going to be the new Stripe or PayPal, but has a solid chance to **grow within specialized industries like gambling and gaming**.\n\n**Their brand Skrill** is especially tailored to fit the European market and has gained some good barriers to entry from competition because of the huge EU regulations for payment processing and transactions.\n\nPaysafe went private in 2017 and was flipped back on the market in 2021 by Blackstone $BX.\n\nThink of Blackstone as one of those agencies that buy a house in a good area but is half torn down because the owner ate too much crayons. They buy a stake in the property, tear down the ruined walls, fix up the rest and put it back for sale. This is actually a pretty smart move, as they gave Paysafe a second chance, and a profit opportunity for investors (and a big fat chunk for themselves).\n\n[Shareholder Structure PSFE](https://preview.redd.it/rb48axu7il871.png?width=843&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=28a7f426de261cf252bb6e6e351197004bc2e2e9)\n\nWith the new shareholder structure they have significantly more pressure on management to deliver returns and pay off some of the long term debt (more below).\n\nThey have Microsoft as a client and are tied to the success of the MS Store and Xbox, which is currently growing.\n\n# The Business\n\nPaysafe is a payment platform that enables businesses and consumers to connect and transact by payment processing, digital wallet, and online cash solutions.\n\nIt offers digital wallet solutions under the **Skrill** and **NETELLER brands**, which enable users to transact from a virtual account.\n\nThe company generates most of its revenues by processing online payments for merchants and customers engaged in the online gambling and foreign exchange trading sectors.\n\nPaysafe focuses on specialized and high-risk verticals, including:\n\n* iGaming\n   * Encompasses a broad selection of **online betting related to sports, esports, fantasy sports, poker and other casino games**\n* Emerging Markets\n   * Includes **stock, FX and blockchaincoin trading, direct marketing** (which can include nutraceuticals and multi-level marketing, travel and entertainment, integrated payments and digital goods)\n\n**These streams represented approximately US$1.1 b, or 74%, of Paysafe\u2019s revenue** for the year ended December 31, 2020.\n\nPaysafe\u2019s CEO, Philip McHugh, [*stated* ](https://www.barrons.com/articles/paysafe-is-public-again-51617221958)that roughly 75% of online gambling operators use Paysafe for processing payments. This includes operators like DraftKings $DKING, William Hill, Betfair, Bet365, Golden Nugget Online Gaming $GNOG, PokerStars, and more.\n\nPlayers of iGaming can use Paysafe\u2019s Skrill and Neteller digital wallets, and other services to place bets.\n\n# Revenue by Segment\n\nIts important to know which Paysafe services sell the most, and grow. Here is a breakdown of revenue [by segment](https://ir.paysafe.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/91/paysafe-reports-first-quarter-2021-results-and-reaffirms):\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Retrieved from the latest quarterly report](https://preview.redd.it/3fuwkh0jil871.png?width=690&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=481e8cd52d7d62fea52af53bf08d6dd8ab9ac710)\n\nPaysafe\u2019s **growth is currently concentrated within the eCash Solutions**, while the other segments took a slight reduction in the first quarter of 2021. Their strongest segment is integrated processing, with a US$176.9 m revenue in Q1 2021.\n\n# Expansion\n\nPaysafe recently [announced](https://ir.paysafe.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/95/paysafe-to-enable-online-cash-payments-on-microsoft-store) that it has further extended its relationship with Microsoft $MSFT, and is now enabling online cash transactions on Microsoft Store on Xbox. With this, Paysafecard is now available on Xbox consoles for millions of customers in 22 European countries. If done right, this has a large growth potential.\n\nThis is good but not huge, because Paysafe was already offering payment processing to Xbox, they have now increased the payment options.\n\nHowever, the fact that Microsoft has partnered with Paysafe gives the copmany potential to grow along with the growth of the MS store and Xbox sales.\n\nAn additional potential boost will be the fact that the MS store will come by default and expanded in the new Windows 11.\n\nThe downside is that Microsoft has the pricing power to dictate terms, and Paysafe might need to settle for lower margins.\n\n# Debt\n\nConsidering financial health and the company\u2019s direction, one of the reasons Paysafe sought to **go public was to raise enough capital from shareholders in order to pay-out some of its outstanding debt**.\n\nManagement has committed to, and is following through with this goal!\n\nThe company has paid out close to US$1.4 b from its total US$3.5 b debt.\n\n**On the surface, this looks like a stabilizing move, but it may have some implications:**\n\n1. Management made a possibly bad decision when leveraging a young growth company in the past\n2. If the company had to be flipped private to public again by a third party, that **raises questions as to why wasn\u2019t the company able to outgrow the debt problem in the first place?**\n   1. Did they have bad management, a wrong capital structure, did they overestimate their growth capacity, or were they early with their innovation and misjudged market demand?\n\n**The answers to these questions are crucial in shaping the way investors see this company.**\n\nIf it was a management error, then that is fixable with supervision, transparency and governance.\n\nIn case they had the wrong capital structure, then flipping the company by Blackstone ( NYSE:BX ) was the perfect move to get future returns.\n\nIf they overestimated their growth capacity, things get dangerous, because this means the company may not be able to enter a high growth phase and deliver more profits than the current (or lower) valuation.\n\nFinally, if they were early on their innovation, they now have a second chance with a more mature market and fresh capital.\n\nCheck the operating expenses in the future for Paysafe! Since this is a software company, an increase in OpEx should be multiplicative for growth down the line (this does not materialize immediately). Also, keep an eye on R&amp;D and SG&amp;A expenses - Marketing and research &amp; development, should drive multiplicative but **not** linear growth - otherwise they are just spending money on cheap customer acquisition numbers.\n\n# Analysts Estimates\n\nTake a look at the future growth lines. Revenue is expected to grow but not too much, about 10% per year. This means that the current market price already reflects the future growth in the company, and the way to change this is if Paysafe gets another large client(s) like Microsoft.\n\nAlso, gambling on sports events is projected to increase as the lockdowns are lifting, and we will most likely see some growth in Q3 and Q4 2020.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Past financials \\(left\\) and future growth estimates \\(right\\) for PSFE](https://preview.redd.it/2hphk5t0jl871.png?width=846&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dbfb0e3b3bcca3068584f98ca38865abebb1af09)\n\nThe company will also become profitable by 2020. This may give them a bump in the stock price, but keep an eye for Q3 2020 results, by that time traders know if it makes sense to increase their positions.  Management has plenty of tricks to break profit, they can cut employees and ramp up marketing with cupons, discounts etc. This will affect margins - If they are reducing, then someone is spending more than they used to in order to get the same result!\n\nI personally watch EBIT margins, because they include Marketing and Development costs. Stay away from Gross Margins!\n\nAnd mind that fat pink line, that is Free Cash Flow, which means that in the future this can be a HIGH cash generating business. But not now, because it is young and must invest heavily in growth!\n\n# Risks:\n\nI keep seeing a lot of companies doing the same in FinTech: payments, e-banking, saving, cash transfers, investing, trading, you name it. **Not everyone will be a winner!** Think about spreading your bets.\n\nCareful not to be early! According to my (SUBJECTIVE) estimates Paysafe is actually trading above intrinsic value, I also see a lot of promotion going on - there is a chance that someone is just looking for bagholders.\n\n# Sentiment\n\nThis is what the short-term sentiment looks like for Paysafe based on options expiring 16 Jul 2020.\n\n[PSFE call and put option contracts at strike prices, expiring 16 Jul 2020 ](https://preview.redd.it/7m9memu9jl871.png?width=1184&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8d6fba4747bd4eb27251e5a7b1706857815eecbe)\n\nSentiment is mostly positive, with a lot more calls than puts, but the price is not expected to move more than US$14 per share in the near term.\n\n# Final Word\n\nMy boss is considering sending me on a permanent vacation because he doesn't like the way I do DD (articles are too long and complicated).
