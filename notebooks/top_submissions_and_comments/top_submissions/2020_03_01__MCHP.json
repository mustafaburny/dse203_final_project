I was making 500$ in a day, keeping my profits small, and not getting greedy.\n\nI set myself a goal: If I can make 5000$ before summer, I can take it off and pursue a startup venture I have been working on in the background. \n\nEarly Feb, trying to approach this smartly, I figured lets forget the stoploss so I dont realize my losses. Stonks only go up. Also, lets leverage MAXIMUMLY so I can get out of the market sooner than later. Then I went all in on MSFT 200 3/20 since nutella and bill fuks. \n\nThen it drilled. And drilled. And I kept betting it would go back up. It didn't.\n\nLast week, I had 1000$ left. Puts, since stonks only go down and beer virus is the end of the world.\n\nToday, all my accounts are unofficially blown up. \n\nI have less than 1k left to my name. Time to long $ROPE. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://imgur.com/anjaLFQ \n\n https://imgur.com/2p26qgp \n\n https://imgur.com/47b9IEd",

He was 84.\n\nHis death was announced Monday by his wife, Suzy.\n\nWith a determination to win by busting up bureaucratic complacency, Welch earned two titles \u2014 \u201cmanager of the century,\u201d and \u201cNeutron Jack\u201d for slashing tens of thousands of jobs. Under his leadership, GE became the world\u2019s most valuable company, after Microsoft. Its fortunes later turned south.\n\nWhile at the helm, Welch bought and sold scores of businesses, expanding the industrial giant into financial services and consulting. GE Capital Bank was founded seven years into his tenure. His acquisitions included RCA \u2014 then-owner of NBC \u2014 and Kidder Peabody, the brokerage that became entangled in an insider trading scandal.\n\nHe also streamlined the conglomerate\u2019s bloated bureaucracy by giving managers free rein to make changes they deemed beneficial to the bottom line.\n\nHe invented the \u201cvitality curve,\u201d in which managers were ranked into three groups. The top 20% \u201cA\u201d group was \u201cfilled with passion, committed to making things happen.\u201d The \u201cvital\u201d 70% \u201cB\u201d group was essential to the company and encouraged to join the A\u2019s. Then there was the bottom 10% \u201cC\u201d group. \u201cThe underperformers generally had to go,\u201d Welch said in his 2001 book, \u201cJack: Straight From the Gut.\u201d\n\nAccording to the book, \u201cthe workforce went from 411,000 to 299,000 during his first five years as chief. With such cuts, he acquired the derisive moniker named after the neutron bomb, which was designed to kill multitudes without destroying cities.\n\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/02/jack-welch-obit-ge.html",

For the truly truly autistic - there is Micron.\n\nHere's my reasoning - the market has sold off a whole bunch in the past week, but some look much weaker than others right now. I wouldn't touch Apple with a 10 foot pole because it has gone up so far, and was the favorite for so long. But if there is a rebound, which stocks might be the strongest? Not the ones everyone has been FOMOing into for the past 2 months because those people have just got burned (I'm looking at you MSFT $200 call holders). \n\nAnd definitely not $SPCE - probably one of the worst ideas ever to come across this sub. \n\nIf I look at which ones have held up very strong the past week and close on Friday, Nvidia definitely gets my attention. It's been a slower climber but recently broke out and last week just retested its upward trend.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[$NVDA still on an linear uptrend, up 7&amp;#37; on Friday 2\\/28](https://preview.redd.it/a9vdb1w6l5k41.png?width=909&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d0f7eb6f3ac9f0cf270f390dac9608d48d6ebbfe)\n\nMedia companies with no physical presence (hence coronavirus safe) also seem like decent bets. I'm talking about Netflix and Facebook here. $FB and $NFLX are the only FAANG stocks not breaking out to new highs recently and there could be a rotation of money into them as they are minimally affected by coronavirus. Also Facebook has announced a $10 billion stock buyback.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[$NFLX mostly flat last week, still in solid uptrend](https://preview.redd.it/fhafupxfl5k41.png?width=880&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=72057d5a941678e3deda16910e4418f4e988180f)\n\nDon't have a position because last week was insane, but watching.",

I am a student and this 1k$, and hopefully +300$ every month is not needed by me in short term until like maybe 4-5 Years later I will cash in, who knows not even then so Its kind of a long term investment. I am waiting for the market to open again soon in 3 hours and see how it is going. What will your suggestion be, which companies have the 'growth' stock.",

        "selftext": "&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Positions](https://imgur.com/gallery/aPzFTne)\n\nThis may or may not be the bottom but I decided to hop in on what I believe to be some highly discounted securities.  \n\n$AMD is looking to take over $INTC market share and so far they have been doing a good job.  Regardless of whether or not they still have their Financial Analyst day on 05 March 2020 they are still primed to take off.  Almost all of the recent processors they have released have resulted in backorders and lines at retailers for people to buy the products, sometimes well over MSRP.  There is evidence to suggest $AAPL is looking at using their processors in the near to medium term future as well.  This of course would make the company pop.  After reaching a high of $59.27 I picked these up on Coronavirus fears at $46.40, around 21% discount from their recent high. \n\n$MSFT has been through the ringer lately.  With $AMZN whining about the JEDI contract, to Coronavirus fears this thing has just been pummeled.  With a recent high of $190.70 and picking these up at $165.39 these are at about 13.27% discount.  I suspect they will be allowed to continue with their JEDI contract because attempting implicate federal employees in any wrongdoing is seriously difficult due to the \"Discretionary\" nature of awarding contracts.\n\n$TAN is Invesco's Solar Energy ETF.  With the world looking to renewables and green energy this is a no brainer. \n\n$PBD is Invesco's Global Clean Energy ETF.  Again, renewables are a no brainer and while $TAN focuses on solar, this encompasses all forms of clean energy. \n\nI bought protective puts where needed/available, $TAN &amp; $AMD.  My $MSFT position is 10 shares and I have a stop loss in place that I'll adjust daily.  $PBD provides no options for protection, so manually adjusting stop losses daily here as well",

But I think I just found a way to make pretty much free money. \nThe steps are easy:\n\n1) take out a student line of credit for let\u2019s say 5k\n\n2) use that money to either sell weekly cash covered puts or covered calls, on a good stock you wouldn\u2019t mind holding, I was thinking AMD or KO.\n\n3) use the premium to pay down the interest and principle of the loan.\n\nThis way you\u2019ll continually make profit cause even if your assigned just sell either a put/call. You can just use to the premiums to buy down the loan and by the time you\u2019ve paid off the loan, the remaining money is just free profit. Since it was never your own money.\n\nI feel like this can\u2019t go tits up. I wanna hear some opinions.",

He was 84.\n\nHis death was announced Monday by his wife, Suzy.\n\nWith a determination to win by busting up bureaucratic complacency, Welch earned two titles \u2014 \u201cmanager of the century,\u201d and \u201cNeutron Jack\u201d for slashing tens of thousands of jobs. Under his leadership, GE became the world\u2019s most valuable company, after Microsoft. Its fortunes later turned south.\n\nWhile at the helm, Welch bought and sold scores of businesses, expanding the industrial giant into financial services and consulting. GE Capital Bank was founded seven years into his tenure. His acquisitions included RCA \u2014 then-owner of NBC \u2014 and Kidder Peabody, the brokerage that became entangled in an insider trading scandal.\n\nHe also streamlined the conglomerate\u2019s bloated bureaucracy by giving managers free rein to make changes they deemed beneficial to the bottom line.\n\nHe invented the \u201cvitality curve,\u201d in which managers were ranked into three groups. The top 20% \u201cA\u201d group was \u201cfilled with passion, committed to making things happen.\u201d The \u201cvital\u201d 70% \u201cB\u201d group was essential to the company and encouraged to join the A\u2019s. Then there was the bottom 10% \u201cC\u201d group. \u201cThe underperformers generally had to go,\u201d Welch said in his 2001 book, \u201cJack: Straight From the Gut.\u201d\n\nAccording to the book, \u201cthe workforce went from 411,000 to 299,000 during his first five years as chief. With such cuts, he acquired the derisive moniker named after the neutron bomb, which was designed to kill multitudes without destroying cities.\n\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/02/jack-welch-obit-ge.html",

For the truly truly autistic - there is Micron.\n\nHere's my reasoning - the market has sold off a whole bunch in the past week, but some look much weaker than others right now. I wouldn't touch Apple with a 10 foot pole because it has gone up so far, and was the favorite for so long. But if there is a rebound, which stocks might be the strongest? Not the ones everyone has been FOMOing into for the past 2 months because those people have just got burned (I'm looking at you MSFT $200 call holders). \n\nAnd definitely not $SPCE - probably one of the worst ideas ever to come across this sub. \n\nIf I look at which ones have held up very strong the past week and close on Friday, Nvidia definitely gets my attention. It's been a slower climber but recently broke out and last week just retested its upward trend.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[$NVDA still on an linear uptrend, up 7&amp;#37; on Friday 2\\/28](https://preview.redd.it/a9vdb1w6l5k41.png?width=909&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d0f7eb6f3ac9f0cf270f390dac9608d48d6ebbfe)\n\nMedia companies with no physical presence (hence coronavirus safe) also seem like decent bets. I'm talking about Netflix and Facebook here. $FB and $NFLX are the only FAANG stocks not breaking out to new highs recently and there could be a rotation of money into them as they are minimally affected by coronavirus. Also Facebook has announced a $10 billion stock buyback.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[$NFLX mostly flat last week, still in solid uptrend](https://preview.redd.it/fhafupxfl5k41.png?width=880&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=72057d5a941678e3deda16910e4418f4e988180f)\n\nDon't have a position because last week was insane, but watching.",

I am ready to invest 1000$ now in stocks. Would it be sensible to buy more AMD stocks, Some MSFT and VISA. What do you think about Nvidia? it seems that currently, its too expensive even after this coronavirus dip. I am a student and this 1k$, and hopefully +300$ every month is not needed by me in short term until like maybe 4-5 Years later I will cash in, who knows not even then so Its kind of a long term investment. I am waiting for the market to open again soon in 3 hours and see how it is going. What will your suggestion be, which companies have the 'growth' stock.",
