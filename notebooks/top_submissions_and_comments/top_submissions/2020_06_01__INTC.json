        "selftext": "First, I want to say I know most of us, even the professionals have no idea what is going on, ever.\n\nSecond, nearly every news article and blog to me is consistently wrong. But what really pisses me off is the follow up news articles, postings, etc have a bogus explanation why something happened. The information that should of been presented prior if it were a true future analysis. There is no benefit figuring out a short term explanation for increase or decrease in a stock after the fact when the stock market is a future fight.\n\nFinally, I am no better than anyone else, but I get gut feeling on some stocks that just stand out based of their trend and my intuition. I haven't got cocky and gone all out on any of these, but I have strong feelings. For example:\n\no 2016 I invested $200 dollars into AMD (60 Shares) which is worth \\~$3200 today. I was looking through various businesses and saw AMD significantly lower than Intel at the time. It was like 2 dollars a share! I was certain it would have substantial growth, maybe dumb luck, maybe intuition. I won't lie, I have no idea when to sell and rarely do. They still appear to be doing so well and will have a significant hand in AI, future of gaming and other technologies. \n\no 2020 At the bottom of Tesla's stock in March trading about \\~350 a share, I knew that would quickly rebound as the future is now, the clear path to transportation is self driving just as significant as all revolutionary technologies. For me, when I retire in 30-40 years I see myself in a self driving RV, with virtual reality capabilities. So, I held off on Tesla at this time because I listed to people full of shit thinking the economy was going to crash and Tesla would be worth less than 250 a share. \n\no Currently, I've invested in a couple commercial airliners, because look at those margins. Analyzing how long it takes airlines to recover, I say full recovery in 2-3 years. I eyeballed Boeing hard, many articles cautioning 'too big to fail' what a load of garbage. They are critical to national transportation. I was going to put down $1,000 on them at about $120 per share. They are up to $173 per share today, and I believe this is only the beginning. \n\no Also, Ford is a lot like the airlines, I have watch this stock sadly die away for four years, and I don't think it will be gone for good. It was \\~9 a share prior to COVID, and went sub $5. I bought a little then and I think they could get to $7 maybe even 8$ before continued their downward trend. \n\nI deviated with my own holdings, but I want this to be about inaccurate articles saying we are going into a recession, specific companies are the next Apple/Amazon that usually go down. Seriously, look up old news articles on companies are overwhelmingly wrong. \n\nIf you are curious of my holdings: ALK, F, SBUX, WEN, MSFT, TSLA, CSCO, SFM, NVIDIA, KR, AMD, CANN\n\nIn the past 4 years, I have 50% gain. Whatever you do, don't buy CANN, I knew this was a dumb move, but i had a little greed in me when I did it.",

        "selftext": "So I asked this about a month ago but want to  see if anyone can think of other companies to add to the list.\n\nThe late Steve Jobs once quoted Alan Kay ***\"People who are really serious about software should make their own hardware.\"*** and said that he felt the same way and that's part of why Apple has been so successful.\n\nI am trying to identify the largest, fastest growing innovative companies that create their own  software AND hardware . So far on my list i have  \n**Apple**  \n**Tesla**  \n**Microsoft (Xbox, tablets)**  \n**Google (Home assistant, chromebook)**  \n**Amazon (Alexa/echo, kindle)**  \n**IBM (mainframes, cloud, blockchain)**  \n**Nvidia**  \n**Nintendo**\n\nTo a lesser extent:  \n**Facebook (AR/Oculus)**  \n**Intel**  \n**Adobe**\n\nCan anyone add help me to add more to this list?",

        "selftext": "Was wondering what you guys think of Broadcom ($AVGO) in the semicon space? It is currently priced at $310+ and reported a $5.14 EPS, meeting expectations. Given that it has a good IP portfolio, do you think the stock is reasonably priced right now?\n\nFor comparisons, AVGO has a P/E of ~50, while INTC is at 12, QCOM at 25 and AMD at 130.\n\nI\u2019m a total noob, but I was thinking of investing in it. But I felt $300+ is a bit steep given the current scenario in the market. How would you evaluate it?\nLooking for some advise.",
