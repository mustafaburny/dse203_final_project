        "selftext": "Companies which operate in duopolies often have wide moats which deliver good financial performance because they're less susceptible to new entrants, often due to high barriers to entry. Many industries also mature to the point where it's only profitable for a handful of companies to operate, which can be profitable for those which survive. For an example, look at the memory semiconductor manufacturing industry. Lots of consolidation over the past two years like Intel selling its NAND business to SK Hynix and Western Digital buying Kioxia. \n\nMy question is, what are some duopolies in relatively attractive industries? Regardless of market cap. I'll start: \n\n$V and $MA: one of the first duopolies many people think of, the two companies with a solid grip on the payment processing space. Have been some worries about new technology/entrants as of late but the chart for these companies tells the story. \n\n$WM and $RSG: waste management is a highly fragmented industry but these two companies have come out on top after Republic Services (the 3rd largest at the time) bought Allied Waste (2nd largest) in 2008. Many think of garbage disposal as a boring, defensive industry akin to utilities, but both stocks are up 150% in five years (good but not great) with a 1.5% dividend, good management and should (theoretically) offer decent downside protection in an economic downturn. \n\nSemiconductor capital equipment: not listing individual stocks because the entire industry is a series of duopolies between $ASM, $LRCX, $AMAT, $TOELY, and $KLAC. The technology is so damn hard and expensive to develop that the market has been whittled down to these five companies supplying most equipment for fabricating semiconductors, charts speak for themselves. \n\nWhat are some other ideas on duopolies? Open to any feedback on this strategy as well.",

        "selftext": "1:09p ET 9/16/2021 - Benzinga\nSen. Elizabeth Warren Asks Federal Reserve To Ban Its Leaders From Trading Stocks\nMentioned:\tAAPL AMZN BABA CVX GE\nSen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) has called on the 12 regional presidents of the Federal Reserve System to enact new rules to prevent their leaders from individual stock trading.\n\nWhat Happened: Warren, who is the chairwoman of the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Subcommittee on Economic Policy, made her request following news reports that Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan and Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren actively traded stocks and other investments during 2020.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported Kaplan made multiple stock trades of more than $1 million each involving shares of Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL), Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. -ADR (NYSE: BABA), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN), Chevron Corporation (NYSE: CVX) and General Electric Company (NYSE: GE), while Rosengren focused his trades on real estate-related securities.\n\nWarren pointed out that although Kaplan and Rosengren pledged to sell their individual stock holdings and no longer trade individual stocks, their actions created conflicts of interest and potential self-dealing.\n\n'This controversy over asset trading by high-level Fed personnel highlights why it is necessary to ban ownership and trading of individual stocks by senior officials who are supposed to serve the public interest,' Warren stated. 'Regional Fed leaders must ban the ownership and trading of individual stocks by senior officials, and impose strong and enforceable ethics and financial conflicts of interest rules for themselves and their staff to restore public trust.'\n\nRelated Link: Sen. Elizabeth Warren Asks Federal Reserve To Break Up Wells Fargo\n\nWhat Else Happened: Warren also raised attention to her proposed Anti-Corruption and Public Integrity Act, which she said was designed to strengthen conflict of interest and recusal requirements of government officials by banning individual stock ownership by members of Congress, senior congressional staff, federal judges, members of the presidential cabinet, White House staff and other senior agency officials while they are in office.\n\nWarren's legislation also included provisions to prevent federal government officials from holding or trading stock in companies that could influence their agency, department or actions. It also requires senior government officials and White House staff to divest from privately owned assets that could present conflicts, including large companies and commercial real estate.\n\nWarren introduced the Anti-Corruption and Public Integrity Act in 2018 without co-sponsors and was never acted upon by the Senate. She reintroduced the legislation in 2020, again without co-sponsors, and the bill was referred to the Senate Finance Committee but has yet to be brought up for consideration.\n\nPhoto: Gage Skidmore / Flickr Creative Commons.\n\n\u00a9 2021 Benzinga.com.

Technically Anal**\n\nSo this past week saw a considerable breakout of the $9 resistance wall and a concomitant FOMOing into the ticker with FD's destined to Lambo or Burn. Well those FDs are either now ash or in a giant gasoline-soaked pyre, but let's have a look at the charts to see if any of the poor bastards holding 9/17 $17 calls can be saved.\n\nFirst, a general look at the important lines:\n\n[So many lines, so much value](https://preview.redd.it/cnrsj3ehy2n71.png?width=1576&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c95d5beb400d7024a6196736106457fd6c843879)\n\nThe most important level on here is the one I've labeled \"Launch #1\", though at this point the \"#1\" is looking smidgen unnecessary. First established on the gap-down on Oct. 6 of last year, it provided resistance on three occasions afterward (yellow arrows for the simpletons), with the last ending in a massive breakout to all-time highs.\n\nThe $9.08 line is the second most important line on the chart, in my possibly chromosome-deficient opinion. First established on Mar. 15 of this year after the bounce from all-time lows, it provided some level of resistance immediately afterward, but in the post *squeeze-that-wasn't-a-squeeze* world of the past few months it has become the ultimate resistance, a titanic, 700-foot wall of ice and sorrow towering over the pitiable bag holders huddling beneath its monstrously cold heights. Before this week, there were three prior attempts so surmount the Wall, all ending failure.\n\nOf next and most immediate importance is the $8 mark. I have it as $7.94 as there is a small case for its origin story beginning on Mar. 25 of this year. However, like the $9 mark, its true importance has been found recently, and ***cannot be overstated***: This line, however pitiful, represents a **higher low** and thus holding that line is of critical importance for the prospects of any near-term upward action.\n\nThe orange downtrend line was the last of the downtrend lines, and crossing it resulted in the most recent attempt at the Wall of $9.\n\nThe green line is **the bottom**, a place of green pastures and buxom women, where the burdens of your bags will vanish away . . . because you've passed from this world and its worries.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNext is a chart looking at the $11.13 mark:\n\n[Fibonacci, because Italian people](https://preview.redd.it/86tdxc76z2n71.png?width=1576&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=05b1f1e37ef85a53788c7100bddb17f9d64889a2)\n\nAs shown, the 78.6% Fibonacci retracement level of $11.13 is shaping up to be a very important line. Indeed, it is soon to over shadow the $11.80 breakout line in that regard. On the dump following the June push, the ticker found support at $11.16 on Jun. 21, and subsequently it opened and dumped down from that level on a Jul. 6 (yellow arrows for simpletons). And just this week we saw the ticker reach up to **exactly** $11.13, before getting summarily thrown back off the top of the Wall. At this point, I think a breakout of $11.13 probably results in a significant push up. But we're getting well ahead of ourselves with that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBeing a TA wunderkind, I've turned my head to just the right angle and found a sliver of hope for the hopeless Men of the Watch:\n\n[Two girls &amp; a cup: can't possibly fail](https://preview.redd.it/ary603egz2n71.png?width=1842&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e4e5b5f27b60656be73760dee5251e0e1d79e6b8)\n\nThe good news is it looks like a cup &amp; handle formation. The bad news is that *usually* a cup &amp; handle is a pause in an uptrend. Here, however, you have a downtrend into the cup (the giant pink arrow for the simpletons). This is a great example of Cbass's First Law of TA: You can always find a chart &amp; indicator combination to tell you what you want to hear. So, let's just call this a positive, because we have little else.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLooking at 1hr chart, let's see if we can find some more copium:\n\n[I see Higher Lows from my house!](https://preview.redd.it/dyaiz8hnz2n71.png?width=1842&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4f6ec421727eeedc62a68c18d33c86a25cd03e9d)\n\nAfter the post earnings dump, CLOV briefly had a breakdown below the $8 support before rallying back up to test the $9 Wall, repeatedly. In that time, it found itself in a new channel between $8.40 and $8.60, thus establishing $8.40 as a **new, higher low**. This, as much as the Great YOLO Brigade of Labor Day Weekend, was the cause of the breakout on Tuesday. Basically, the chart was screaming that a breakout was incoming, YOLO brigade be damned.\n\nThe copium for next week is whether or not another higher low can be put in at $8.60. Like any good Man of the Bag Watch I have to hope it can, because if I try to leave, my portfolio gets hunted down and beheaded.\n\nThe worse and therefore more likely scenario is a breakdown all the way back to $8, undoing several weeks worth of upward progress. The absolute worst case is a *true* failure of $8 and a return to all-time lows. This would be a dagger in the heart, and unless someone knows a Red Woman, we're fucked.\n\n[Winning, winning so fuckin' hard right now](https://preview.redd.it/8zf0arxvz2n71.jpg?width=1200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=55ff09023716e9894e0f4fd672ec56fa1d4808de)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**Part 2. Dynamically-expanding Dildos** **^((for maximum gapping)****)**\n\nIn true Clovtard fashion, my knowledge of this company prior to purchasing shares was \"it does some techy stuff with healthcare.\" Which, it turns out, is basically all you need to know. This company is one of those that seems complex and super high-tech, but in reality is more basic bitch than your average Instagram thot. That being said, it might still work out for them... after all, do you see some of these basic bitches that blow up on Instagram? Living proof that ***literally anything*** is possible.\n\nBut just in case someone cares (and to keep the Clovtards from reeing in the comments), here's a look at the company underlying the CLOV:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\----------------------------\n\n***Business Model***\n\n* **TL;DR: they sell insurance to old people &amp; process payment claims from doctors**\n\nClover sell two products:\n\n1. Medicare Advantage (MA) plans, which are just insurance plans for people on Medicare that include extra services along with the Medicare stuff, and\n2. Direct Contracting (DC) plans, which are one of several alternative payment models recently put forth by CMS (the people that run Medicare)\n\nThe important difference between these is that Medicare Advantage is an insurance plan where the ***patient*** is Clover's customer and Direct Contracting is where the ***doctor*** is Clover's customer. With the latter, Clover is acting as, essentially, a *payment processor* for the doctor's Medicare patients. This allows Clover to get a sweet slice of that government largess. On the doctors' side of it, they deal with Clover instead of CMS. Supposedly the whole scheme (and this is one of five put forth by CMS in 2020) is supposed to save the government money (&gt;!it won't!&lt;). I don't give a fuck about that part; all I care about here is whether Clover can grow their slice of the pie. \n\nThis Direct Contracting scheme was a ***major selling point*** for Chamath when they went public (more on that below), and for good reason. Clover only needs to manage a single relationship (with the doctor) to grab up dozens, or potentially hundreds, of patients. This DC scheme should be (*on paper at least)* far more efficient than Clover's original business model, which was just managing MA plans. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\----------------------------\n\n***Growth***\n\n* **TL;DR: they can** ***potentially*** \\~**25x their customer base** **^((but probably much, much less))**\n\nSo other than **\"the squeeze\"**, why would anyone ***genuinely*** believe this company is going to have some astronomical valuation that would give them a stock price on par with the likes of United Healthcare? Simple: growth. \n\nRight now Clover only services MA and DC contracts in a small number of counties: 108 in 8 states. They are expected to nearly double with an additional 101 counties by the end of the year, bringing the total to 209 in 9 states. Since there are 3,000 some odd counties in the United States, there is (*on paper*) a lot of room to expand here. **This is good**.\n\nAs of their latest earnings report, they had 128,591 \"lives under management.\" (I think that is a creepy as fuck way of putting it, but I *guess* it's industry standard....) Of those, 66,566 were MA customers and the remaining 62,025 were *indirect* patients, i.e., the Medicare patients of doctors in a DC agreement with Clover. The total of \\~129,000 was a year-over-year increase of 126.3%. **This is also good**.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Math time!**\n\nIn their best counties, Clover has upward of 25% market share (at least this is their *claim*); that is, they have a quarter of the MA patients signed up with them. But to assume they can do that everywhere would be absurd. To keep this ultra simple, let's just assume that their current percentage as of the last earning report is representative of what they can do. So that is 128,591 \"lives\" across 108 counties which comes to an **average of 1,190 \"lives\" per county**.  (Obviously, not all counties are the same size, but let's just use this average for simplicity's sake.) So we have:\n\n**1,190 x 3000 = 3.57 million \"lives\"**\n\n**3,570,000 / 128,591 = 27.8**\n\nSo, ***theoretically***, Clover could achieve **27.8x growth** in customers, and ***presumably*** a similar growth in revenue. (We'll get to profitability, or lack there of, below.) Looking deeper at this number, one thing going for it is that the number of old people is steadily increasing. But on the other hand, competition is a thing, and big thing in this space. To assume that Clover is going to have 3.5 million customers in 10 years, or even 20, is pretty wild..... \n\nChamath claimed Clover was the \"easiest ten bagger\" he'd ever seen (or some shit like that). So, even going with that number, they would end up with 1.3 million \"lives\" in ten years. Even this seems pretty high to me. They went from 0 to 62,025 DC patients this year, but it is ***always easier to grow when you're small***. Scaling is an issue for all businesses. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\----------------------------\n\n***Profitability***\n\n* **TL;DR: they'll make no profit for a long ass time** **^((if ever))**\n\nAs for actually making money, well Clover doesn't do that. Yes, they had a 140% increase in revenue, which is good, but their expenses are rising ***faster*** than revenue. Accordingly, they missed on earnings by -0.52, or **378% downside surprise**. In typical corporate fashion, their forward guidance is full of claims of improvement on cost management just around the corner.\n\nThere is, to be fair here, a legitimate reason for some of the cost increases in the form of covid expenses. Essentially, some old people needed extra care, while others *delayed* care until it looked safe which caused a massive spike in trips to the doctor. And when you're old and you let shit slide, it gets a lot worse and a lot more expensive.\n\nFurthermore, their basic strategy involves eating losses when they take on new \"lives under management,\" with the idea that they'll make it back, and more, further down the road with that same patient though the efficiencies of their \"A.I.\", Clover Assistant.  \n\nTaking them at their word that this works (and will continue to do so at larger scales) then it is obvious they will being eating losses for years to come. Allegedly, they'll turn a profit in 2023, but I wouldn't hold my breath on that. However, just growing their \"lives under management\" number might be enough to hold up the stock price.\n\nIt might **not** be enough, however, to keep the lights on. If they can't at least slow the bleeding, share issuances could be lurking down the road (queue the pump &amp; dump conspiracies).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\----------------------------\n\n***Competition***\n\n* **TL;DR: they have to take market share from better companies**\n\nAs noted above, the biggest hurdle in front of Clover is **competition**. Despite the \"tech start-up\" narrative surrounding Clover, the reality is that they are marching into the teeth of well-entrenched healthcare companies. \n\nThe likes of United Healthcare and Humana aren't going to take lightly to little ol' Clov rolling up in their shit. With about 10 million patients between them, UH and Humana are monsters in the Medicare space and with that comes the ability to undercut the competition. Furthermore, all these big players also have their own ***magic AI machine-learning gizmos*** that do ***magic AI things***. And they already have access to more data than Clover on account of their massive patient base. \n\nThis doesn't mean they can just snuff Clover out of existence, but taking away market share from established players is a far different gambit than expanding into a new market. And it gets harder the bigger you get. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\----------------------------\n\n***Shaddy Shit***\n\n* **TL;DR: Chamath is a shaddy af, and so is the CEO**\n\nThis whole shabang was rolled out in typical Chamath fashion. Back in October of 2020, in his pitch for Clover, he claimed they **\"already\"** had 200,000 lives under management in their **Direct Contracting program** (i.e., not including the MA patients). Except that was bullshit of the Chamath-degree. At the time he claimed this, Clover ***hadn't even started*** its DC program (it had only just been accepted into the program). \n\nAs their latest earning report notes, they don't expect to get anymore \"lives\" in their DC program until Jan. 2022. (This is due to Medicare enrollment period rules). So, rather than \"already\" having 200,000 for 2021, Clover will instead end the year with the \\~62,000 that they have right now. ***Chamath at his finest, ladies and gentlemen.***\n\nClover's top guy, Vivek, is also well-known for being shaddy. Though, in his case, I don't actually care as much. Back in the day, this guy ran three hospitals in NJ that were noteworthy for having the highest fees of any hospitals in America. Shaddy, but shaddy in the ***ruthless capitalism direction***. He gets a pass from Cbass *for this*. He is also alleged to have pilfered a company he ran back in the day. This doesn't get a pass, because it could negatively affect my bottom line. \n\nClover is the subject of two ***related*** investigations, one from DoJ and the other from the SEC. The DoJ one is about shaddy business practices; something about kickbacks. I also don't give much a fuck about this. The SEC investigation is about the fact that the DoJ investigation was not disclosed during the SPAC merger. All this will probably amount to some fines, if anything at all. \n\nOn scale of 0 to Enron, I'll give Clover a 1.5. Doesn't look that bad to me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\----------------------------\n\n***Technology***\n\n* **TL;DR: they have a magic AI app that designed to maximize** **~~health~~** ***profits*** **^((maybe))**\n\nThe last thing to mention is the Great Green Hope: the **Clover Assistant**. This is the \"tech\" in Clover and the reason dipshits are using #TelsaHealth. What is it? Well, basically a data input and analysis program. More basically: *Microsoft Excel with fancy buttons*.\n\nClover Assistant is used by the doctors (and many MA patients use it, too) to coordinate and recommend stuff. The Great Hope here is that doctors love using this thing so much that they'll sign onto a DC agreement with Clover, allowing Clover to process their Medicare payment claims in exchange for access to the \"**app**\".\n\nSo is it going to work? Well, it is ***starting*** to: Clover went from 0 to 62,000 patients via this scheme this year. It's a country fucking mile from what Chamath claimed, but ain't nothing. And given the potential for expansion into the rest of the US, and you have the receipt for a pretty damn good return on capital. But then again, it is just an \"app\".\n\nTo be clear, I don't hate the *idea* of Clover Assistant. Conceptually, I actually like it. The Clover Assistant basically helps doctors make sure their patients are getting the \"right care\" by compiling data and presenting it in an easy to use fashion. This is presented as an opportunity to \"improve outcomes\" and \"save costs\" and \"help the under-served.\" But I don't give a rat's ass about any of that.\n\nWhich brings me to the Hindenburg report, and the part about it that I ***like***. The report claims that Clover is using the Assistant to direct doctors toward medical recommendations that would result in profits for Clover (rather than the best medical outcome), and that they are incentivizing the doctors with increased payments for these outcomes. ***I love this.*** Now, Clover vehemently denies this is the case, but I (not so) secretly hope their lying here, because this is ***exactly*** what I imagine when I think of applying Big Data-A.I. and Machine Learning to healthcare.   \n\nPeople have ***blind faith*** in machines, particularly ones that they've been told are \"**A.I. powered**\" and involve \"**machine learning**\". Thus, you can use the concept of \"A.I.\" to persuade patients to just accept whatever the computer tells them. Machine learning is then used program the Clover Assistant to ***maximize profits***, which should involve providing the minimum care required to keep the patient alive as long as possible. (Medicare pays a set amount to Clover and they get to keep the extra if the patients don't use up all the funds). \n\nThe only way I could see to improve on this diabolical scheme would be if they ground up the corpses of their newly deceased patients, turned them into food and fed them to the rest of their **\"lives under management.\"** I'm lookin' for every penny here, kids, ***every single penny***.\n\n[It's made from options traders!](https://preview.redd.it/u4qd8tzo63n71.jpg?width=780&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6e27a86ed516acbd906706d2e9440056b6bd90d3)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**Part 3. A Conspiracy of Idiocy**\n\nTypical of any stock ticker that gathers a cultish following, the Clovidiots are as well-known for their conspiracy theories as they are for their options expiring worthless. Now, most of these are the run-of-mill shit you get with any ticker: the Hedgies, reeee! You would think that this is the first time some of these people had ever bought a stock... oh, wait.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\----------------------------\n\n***Hedgies!!!***\n\n* **TL;DR: it's the stock market, deal with it**\n\nSo, do the \"Hedge Funds\" manipulate the stock price? Well, sure, why not. They definitely shorted it, and then managed to cover those short sales with little appreciable rise in the stock. Back in June, CLOV was at something like a 48% shorted. Now the it's 15% and I believe it got as low as 7% before this week's run up. While going from 48% to 7% short with no appreciable rise in the stock price looks impossible, it's definitely not when you considered that a large percentage of the float has been in institutional hands this whole time. Stock goes up a little, they sell and back down she goes, welcome to a regular day on the stock market.\n\nIs this some grand conspiracy of fat cats in a room smoking cigars as they plan out how to stick it to those pesky Reddit kids? ***I doubt it***, but if it makes you feel better, whatever.\n\nI, personally, would worry less about the \"Hedge Funds\" and more about the Market Makers, as they're the ones selling you the options, and if they buy up the stock beforehand, they can sell out for a profit while simultaneous vaporizing those call options you bought from them. In fact, I'm pretty sure this is the game.\n\nCan anything be done about it? Well, no, not really. At least, not unless retail buys up a larger percentage of the float. However, with each false run up, I wonder if that exact process is taking place, i.e., more bagholders are being newly minted, and each, not wanting to take an L and just move on with his life, decides to become a \"diamond handed ape.\" Only time will reveal the truth of this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\----------------------------\n\n***Us vs. the World***\n\n* **TL;DR: everyone thinks this way, deal with it**\n\nThe second great conspiracy of CLOV is that the whole of the internet is out to get it. This is proffered with the full knowledge that GME-Anon and Popcorn ***both believe the same thing about their own stock.*** Both also believe that CLOV is, ***in and of itself***, a conspiracy to distract from their pet stock. But GME-Anon ***also believes*** that Popcorn is an engineered distraction. And all three are ***also*** convinced that the Mods are out to get them, ***specifically***.\n\nThis is, of course, perfectly normal behavior. That might seem shocking to some of you, but the next time you're watching football with a die hard fan (or whatever lame-ass europoor sport you watch), look for their reactions whenever the slightest thing doesn't go their way:\n\n* *\"These fucking refs are terrible! They're totally biased against my team! They've got it out for us! I'm going to write an angry letter to the league!\"*\n\nSound familiar? It should, because if you look around with open eyes, you'll find this exact behavioral pattern repeated at infinitum across every conceivable human endeavor.\n\nDo people hate CLOV and the masses of idiots holding it? Sure, and I don't blame them. You guys can be pretty fucking annoying. That does not, however, equate to a grand conspiracy of suppression. The fact that your copy-pasta DD got nixed just like everyone else's lazy dogshit copy-pasta is not you being singled out. It's you not understanding the rules and adapting your behavior to play within them. But hey, maybe it's easier to just blame the Mods.\n\n[\\(please don't ban me\\)](https://preview.redd.it/7mfo4sa0q3n71.jpg?width=1600&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=00e9a245357f31fe49b1cf093303f400f411d546)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**Part 4. Rise now, a Man of the Bag Watch**\n\nHaving taken a brief tour of Castle Black and had a bit of a feel for what it's like to be a venerable Man of the Clov Bag Watch, most of you are probably thinking: *Okay, how the fuck do I get out this chickenshit operation?* \n\nWell, you are probably still hoping for **moon**. In that regard, I've some bad news for you: ***there will be no squeeze.*** \n\nThere will absolutely not be a **short squeeze****.** At 15% short, there is zero chance of this happening. *\"But, bruh, the* ***real*** *short number is like 420% bruh.\"* Bullshit. Just straight bullshit.\n\nThere is also not going to be a **gamma squeeze.** Not anytime soon, and likely never. In order to get a gamma squeeze you need options that are going to be delta-hedged. But why delta-hedge options that are going to be Thanos-snapped out of existence by expiry?\n\nA while back, it looked like there could be a **mixed squeeze** (short covering + gamma hedging), but that's all in the past now. Down the road from now, could it still happen? Yeah, sure, and I could end up raw-dogging a Victoria's Secret model on the hood of my new lambo. All kinds of crazy things are ***possible***, but that doesn't make them ***likely***.\n\nAnd honestly, what the fuck is wrong with a good ol' grind up? Squeezes are fun, I get it. You get to see your money double, triple, 5x, 10x, all in the space of a day or two. You get to see those option YOLO's gain a thousand of percent in minutes. But you still make money on a grind up. A fuckload of it.\n\nI'm not sure I buy into this whole notion of a \"squeeze\" being the **Holy Grail of the Stock Market**. It's starting to sound like the Bears and their perpetual claims that they're going to make ***all the money*** on the coming collapse, all while lighting round after round of SPY puts on fire. The Squeeze Fanatics are doing the same thing, but with call options on meme stocks. \n\nBut, hey, what do I know? I'm just peon in this operation, a pitifully small cog in the great meat grinder we call the stock market. For now the chart tells me there's still **hope of up**, and so my bag watch continues. When the chart dies and there is no more good to be said of the company, then I will initiate my Bagholder Optimization Formula and there my watch will end. Until then, I man my post.\n\n[Tormund Bearfucker](https://preview.redd.it/dpx4byfpy3n71.jpg?width=961&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=55407f36e295ce5450fa607f21dfa766fc2f54c1)\n\n**Positions or Ban:**\n\n[Maybe I can try crtl-z?](https://preview.redd.it/w59n919dx3n71.jpg?width=1667&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2a10ed3b8aee187ad77f3d03404586278d97e8c4)",

        "selftext": "So, Alibaba is of course the most discussed stock in the last month on this sub, I think. So I decided to discuss Tencent, instead.\n\nI think Tencent is simply incredible. Let's see why:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **WeChat** \n\nThey own WeChat/Weixin (Weixin is for mainland China, WeChat for everywhere else. I will call it WeChat). WeChat is.. WeChat. Mohnish pabrai calls it \"a bazooka Tencent can fire at will\". It has 1.25 billion users. What can you do on WeChat? Everything. Text, pay for stuff, play games, shop online, anything. Imagine if the following app existed:\n\n* Need something on Amazon? No problem, you can do it directly from WeChat through its mini-app.\n* Need to pay something in a shop? Use TenPay.\n* Need a ride on Uber? Use WeChat mini-app.\n* Need to order food on DoorDash? WeChat.\n\nReplace Amazon with JD, Uber with Didi, DoorDash with Meituan, and you have WeChat. \n\nWeChat is a bazooka beause, if Tencent decides to partner with someone and allows them to integrate in their ecosystem, that business will explode. It happened with Pinduoduo, which mainly works on WeChat: it grew 100% last year.\n\nSince it runs the platform, Tencent gets a commission. Also, it stores all the data that goes through these apps. In 2020, revenue from WeChat was 16.7 billion dollars, out of 74.6 billion in total. WeChat has 3.2 million mini programs on its platform, which transacted 1.6 trillion RMB (247 billion $) in 2020. To get how much this thing is growing, in 2017 it was 210 billion RMB (32b).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Tencent's empire**\n\nTencent has an impressive number of businesses: they have a subscription revenue which is 62% that of Netflix; a media ads business (bigger than the Nyt), games, cloud, mobile payment services. Their business is so wide it is hard to navigate. Some examples:\n\n1. **Gaming**: Tencent has around 50% of market share in China in the mobile gaming industry. In 2020 they made 29.3 billions from games. In 2021 it is probably going to be lower. Online gaming industry in 2020 was 58b, it is expected to grow to 86b in 2027. Mobile gaming is projected to be 70% of the online gaming market in China by then.\n2. **TenPay**: There are two ways to pay for stuff in China: TenPay and AliPay. While in the West switched from cash to cards, and are still in transition, China has skipped a step and went directly to mobile payments. In 2018 already, a walloping 83% of all payments in China were made through mobile. Now it is around 90%. Cards are useless, in China: they account for less than 5% of payments. In the Western world, Google pay and Apple Pay are only now eroding the empire of Visa, Mastercard, American Express etc. China, on the other hand, was to Tencent and Alibaba like a smooth field: they just took over. Apple pay now has around 500 million users world-wide. Tencent has 900 millions. From the last financial report, Tencent shows that revenue of the financial technology and corporate services business increased by 40% year-on-year to RMB 41.9 billion (6. billions). China's mobile payment market is projected to reach 88.4 Billion usd by the year 2027, trailing a CAGR of 47.3%.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Tencent's fantastic portfolio**:\n\nBefore you do a cf analysis of Tencent, you need to know that Tencent has a portfolio that is currently valued around 250 billions usd at present. It is like a financial version of Cthulhu, with tentacles everywhere. It is quite hard to navigate/find information about it. They say they are currently invested in over 700 companies, of which only 103 are publicly traded. This guy has put up a [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1owpL6WmMK30X19Kw3BziAw39rGJbsfIMOOexdtvAkxU/edit) for you that tracks the most notable public ones.\n\nSome notable busineness Tencent owns (percentages might not be accurate):\n\na) Gaming:\n\n* 100% Riot Games (League of Legends)\n* 40% Epic Games (Fortnite)\n* 81.4% Supercell (Clash of Clans)\n* 10% BlueHole (PUBG)\n* 80% Grinding Gear Games (Path of Exile)\n* 5% Activision Blizzard.\n* 20% Kingsoft (gaming competitor in China &amp; cloud business)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nb) Finance:\n\n* 30% Webank (biggest online bank in China)\n* 2%? Khatabook (digital payments in India)\n* 25% Gojek (same in Indonesia)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nc) Social:\n\n* 50.1% Huya (twitch-like)\n* 38% Douyu (twitch-like)\n* 12% Snapchat\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nd) Music:\n\n* 58% Tencent music\n* 6.8% Spotify\n* 10% Universal music group\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ne) E-commerce:\n\n* 25% Sea ltd (which also makes games, does mobile payments etc)\n* 18% JD\n* 17% Pinduodo\n* 7% Vipshop\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nf) Other\n\n* 20% Meituan (Doordash of China)\n* 15% Nio (ev)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Valuation**\n\nHow do you value Tencent? Currently, Tencent has a market cap of 619.72b, with a P/E of 24 and P/fcf (trailing 12 months) of 22 (Do not forget the investment portfolio, as well). fcf grew 29.4% a year in the last 10 years. Tencent has Microsoft-style profit margins of 35%. Revenue is growing at more than 30% a year, which is insane for a company this size. With its impressive portfolio, Tencent is poised to have a leading role in a country that is growing it GDP at 7%, that soon will catch up with the US, and where around 500 million people are projected to reach middle class in the next 10 years, something which will benefit tech companies the most. Of course, the risks are China regulations, in particular its anti-monopoly campaign; China in general: VIE structure, accounting standards etc. Here is an earnings based model, but take it with a grain of salt. \n\nDiscount rate: 14%. Based on eps without nri. 20 years.\n\n* Best scenario (20%): year 1-10: 25% growth, y 10-20: 10%. Value: 112.13\n* Normal scenario (60%): y1-10: 18%; y10-20: 10%. Value: 70.38\n* Worst scenario (20%): y1-10: 15%. y10-20: 8%. Value: 55.27\n* Fair value: 75.7\n* current price: 64.56. Undervalued by 17.25 % for a 14% return.  \n\n\nOf course it's all about assumptions. If you raise margin of safety, cut down growth estimates etc, you will get a very different number. I think I used a fairly conservative growth estimate, though. I personally think the upside for Tencent is insane., even though it is a behemoth already. It is one of my strongest buys.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI might consider doing a separate post about the risks of investing in Tencent: China regulations etc. For now.. thanks for reading!\n\nSources:\n\n[https://www.businessofapps.com/data/wechat-statistics/](https://www.businessofapps.com/data/wechat-statistics/)\n\n[https://www.notboring.co/p/tencent-the-ultimate-outsider](https://www.notboring.co/p/tencent-the-ultimate-outsider)\n\n[https://finance.yahoo.com](https://finance.yahoo.com) &amp; [gurufocus.com/](https://gurufocus.com/)\n\n[https://www.statista.com/topics/4322/apple-pay/](https://www.statista.com/topics/4322/apple-pay/)\n\n[https://daxueconsulting.com/payment-methods-in-china/](https://daxueconsulting.com/payment-methods-in-china/)\n\n[https://static.www.tencent.com/uploads/2021/04/08/960eae1f18dd716fd3a7d704e123d7a5.pdf](https://static.www.tencent.com/uploads/2021/04/08/960eae1f18dd716fd3a7d704e123d7a5.pdf)\n\n[https://min.news/en/economy/aa274e1f9ba05e4b8a246a71d9035681.html](https://min.news/en/economy/aa274e1f9ba05e4b8a246a71d9035681.html)\n\n[https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2020/10/08/2105516/28124/en/Global-Contactless-Payment-Transaction-Market-Report-2020-2027-Market-Expected-to-Grow-at-a-CAGR-of-49-7-U-S-Market-is-Estimated-at-10-Billion-While-China-is-Forecast-to-Grow-at-47.html](https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2020/10/08/2105516/28124/en/Global-Contactless-Payment-Transaction-Market-Report-2020-2027-Market-Expected-to-Grow-at-a-CAGR-of-49-7-U-S-Market-is-Estimated-at-10-Billion-While-China-is-Forecast-to-Grow-at-47.html)\n\n[https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2021/05/04/2222088/28124/en/China-Online-Gaming-Market-Report-2021-Market-was-Valued-58-Billion-in-2020-and-is-Expected-to-Reach-to-86-Billion-by-2027-Top-Players-are-Tencent-NetEase-Kingsoft-Changyou-Shanda-.html](https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2021/05/04/2222088/28124/en/China-Online-Gaming-Market-Report-2021-Market-was-Valued-58-Billion-in-2020-and-is-Expected-to-Reach-to-86-Billion-by-2027-Top-Players-are-Tencent-NetEase-Kingsoft-Changyou-Shanda-.html)\n\n[https://kr-asia.com/key-stat-mobile-games-to-take-over-70-of-chinas-gaming-market-in-2020](https://kr-asia.com/key-stat-mobile-games-to-take-over-70-of-chinas-gaming-market-in-2020)",

        "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nI would like to share my ongoing DD on high short interest stocks, methodology, and conservative but high ROI plays moving into October. It's exhausting now as everything now is considered a \"short squeeze\" but I would like shed some light on relatively safe plays and reasoning behind it. This methodology will always change based on data presented. The #1 rule in this is that you don't want to chase on plays that are being run. What I do for myself is to get in plays based on data/method that are not running (pre-squeeze), scale into the stock, wait for the catalysts, and then scale out of the stock once it starts running. See below:\n\nMethodology/Criteria:\n\n1. I am looking at high short interest stocks on MarketWatch and HighShortInterestStocks continuously for the top 10 tickers (you can find these sites via Google and make sure to look at it continuously!). S3 has good information but I don't pay for the data.\n2. Market cap over $1.5B per WSB rules but you can use this methodology to find other smaller cap plays yourself outside of WSB.\n3. I look for the following requirements (STRICT) and they must all be present at any given time.\n\na. The first requirement is the stock must be close to a 52 week low or close/below the 200 MA- you can also follow the YTD Change %. You want to make sure you are buying value and not stocks that are down because they are truly terrible companies.\n\nb. The second requirement is the stock must have catalysts in the short term horizon- this allows for anticipation of upside and call option flow. The most % of money I ever made was purchasing stocks/calls in their pre-squeeze stage before they actually squeezed. This way you don't get IV crushed while chasing but as the IV builds, you gain massively on calls. If you are purchasing calls when the IV is at or less than 90% and a catalyst hits that takes the IV &gt;130%, these are massive gains.\n\nc. The third requirement is that the stock float must be shorted &gt;30%. Low float stocks aren't a requirement although they help in certain situations.\n\nd. The 4th requirement are technicals. The one set up I always play is a falling wedge as long as it meets the requirements above. I also love playing cup and handles and bull flags as they are the most consistent. I do not play symmetrical triangles or wedges- I feel as though these are more unpredictable.\n\ne. The other dataset that I look at are call/put ratio and open interest on call options. This can tell you how bullish or bearish generally the market is for the future. A large amount of OI on calls means people are anticipating something significant.\n\n4) Scale In with stock/call purchases based on risk/reward ratio. Make sure to SCALE IN. This doesn't mean purchasing all at one time. I usually purchase not in time increments but in % decrease increments (on average -5%) to be safe and purchase 90% stock / 10% calls (&gt;3 months out) to scale in below based on my own risk management. If I want to go riskier/higher reward, I will increase the amount of calls or shorten the call expiration date. But I strongly advise purchasing calls &gt;3 month out exp.\n\ni.e. Day 1: 90% stock / 10% calls (20% of capital) and then repeat when the stock price drops 5%. If the stock price jumps, I don't scale up as many might do. I just move onto another play. Holding CASH is always a position.\n\n5) Once the catalyst hits or there is upside to the stock, I scale out of my positions/gains (not all at one time). Make sure you follow volume - if the volume is strong, you can hold onto your positions much longer to get maximum ROI.\n\n6) Rinse, repeat, and share with others on your plays.\n\nThe stock that I am most interested in right now is $ROOT and I've evaluated the others- please feel free to drop in comments what you would like for me to evaluate. Right now it is the #4 most shorted stock on MarketWatch and HighShortInterestStocks. I will let you know my thoughts on the others in the comments thread and why $ROOT is better vs. others like $SDC. I do look at basic fundamentals to help my game and I do see that $ROOT has $1B in cash while trading at a market cap of $1.5B. They do have a catalyst on the horizon which is their Carvana partnership launch date and other insurance programs (haven't gotten hit by negative news except earnings). Short Interest is at 35%. Technically, they are in a falling wedge with it getting tighter- this is when I like to go riskier on calls as you could see a significant breakout. Let me know your thoughts and I will answer questions that you may have!\n\n[$ROOT Technicals as of 9\\/27](https://preview.redd.it/frkwyx88b2q71.png?width=1412&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=52ae9151bfa18df1a5a1935a720b26feb87568c1)",

        "selftext": "The Evergrande group is responsible for servicing 80,000 retail investors with \"high yield\" investment accounts.  That's a lot of chads and a lot of wifes boyfriends about to be without their life savings.  Xi Jinping does not like people with wealth, he is a hardline communist, just ask Jack MA (if you can find him).  \n\nTheres also 1.6M people who have pre-paid for a house which has never been delivered.\n\nThe CDO's created by evergrande are on the books of some major banks, HSBC for example, and even Blackrock.\n\nEvery day nothing is done the risk of this spiralling out of control increases exponentially.\n\nThere are talks and hints of a \"partial bailout\", one that will allow delivery of those homes but will not rescue the shareholders and bondholders.  This fits with Xis \"for the people\" policy mandate.\n\nGreat idea in theory, but just how do you intend to accomplish that? Capitalism works when companies are held together, not broken apart.  Just attempting to do something like that has no guarantee for success.\n\nOther major part of this is the reason a wholesale bailout is not being offered.  This is because Evergrande is not the only chinese real estate company potentially in this situation, the government knows it can't bail them all out, so is still figuring out what to do.\n\nTBH it looks about as bad as it gets, so my gut instinct would be to buy puts;\n\nI guess calls are the play then :)\n\nTBH I still haven't thought up a decent play for this yet, I'm open to suggestions but my current favourite idea is NIO puts, since with so many \"investors\" being up in arms in china about this, and them being the demographic that buys these cars, their sales are going to take a massive hit.\n\nHope this helps and Good Luck!!",

        "selftext": "\nEvergrande investors face 75% hit as company edges closer to restructure\n\nAnalysts say massively indebted China property group likely to be dismantled to avoid triggering market-wide panic\n\nThe Guardian\nMartin Farrer\nMon 13 Sep 2021 02.14 EDT\n\nThe troubled Chinese property group Evergrande has edged closer to a government-engineered restructuring which could see bondholders take huge losses as Beijing\u2019s price for saving millions of homeowners from financial ruin.\n\nWith the likelihood increasing every day that the massively indebted group will be dismantled to avoid triggering a market-wide panic, trade in one of its bonds was suspended in Shanghai on Monday after it plunged 25%.\n\nShares in the group founded by billionaire Xu Jiayin in the 1990s slipped 6% on Monday to sit below their 2009 float price of HK$3.5.\nChina property market rocked as Evergrande struggles to repay $300bn debts\n\nEvergrande has been struggling to manage its enormous $300bn debt pile for several years but tougher regulations about debt levels brought in last year as part of president Xi Jinping\u2019s drive against inequality has accelerated its crisis. \n\nA firesale of its properties has failed to dent the debt pile despite generous discounts, a strategy further undermined by falling house prices.\n\nThe property market has exploded in China in the past two decades. Total real estate sales were 16tn yuan ($2.5tn) in 2019, or 10% of the country\u2019s entire economic output.\n\nA disorderly failure of Evergrande would represent a serious risk to the whole Chinese economy, with the risk of contagion in the rest of the world.\n\nAnother sign of the weakness of the sector came when shares in the office developer Soho China tumbled 35% on Monday \u2013 its biggest daily drop since listing more than 14 years ago \u2013 after the US investment giant Blackstone scrapped a $3bn takeover deal.\n\nEconomists at the consultancy Capital Economics said in a note titled \u201cEvergrande circling the plughole\u201d that a banking failure triggered by the collapse of major property developers was the \u201csingle most likely scenario that could lead to a hard landing in China\u201d.\n\nNomura International Hong Kong credit analyst Iris Chen told Bloomberg on Monday that a restructuring of the group was \u201calmost unavoidable\u201d. She believes that the government in Beijing will ensure that Evergrande delivers homes and pays suppliers, where dollar debt investors would get 25% of their money back.\n\nLuther Chai, a senior research analyst at CreditSights Singapore, also said Evergrande will default and enter restructuring. Evergrande\u2019s dollar bonds are trading at around 30c in the dollar, which indicates losses of 70%. Foreign investors own $7.4bn of Evergrande\u2019s US-denominated debt.\n\nMark Williams, chief Asia economist at Capital, also believes that the most likely endgame is \u201ca managed restructuring in which other developers take over Evergrande\u2019s uncompleted projects in exchange for a share of its land bank\u201d.\n\nCapital estimates that Evergrande had 1.3tn yuan in presale liabilities at the end of June, equivalent to roughly 1.4m individual properties that it has committed to complete. \u201cA restructuring that prioritised homebuyers might not leave much for other creditors,\u201d Williams said, pointing to heavy losses for bondholders.\n\nXi seems determined to target some of China\u2019s billionaires in his drive to create a more equal society, as Alibaba founder Jack Ma found to his cost last year. In a harbinger of the \u201cthree red lines\u201d introduced to toughen up balance sheet requirements for property firms, Xi said two years ago that houses were for \u201cliving in, not for speculating\u201d.\n\nEvergrande was the \u201cposter child for excess leverage in a sector in which policymakers want to instil more discipline,\u201d Williams said.\n\nBen Wang, of Jamieson Coote Bonds in Sydney, also agrees that the default is coming. \u201cGiven the large size of its balance sheet, Evergrande is deemed as a systematic risk to the Chinese financial system: the authorities cannot afford to let it fail abruptly. \n\nWe believe Evergrande is likely to collapse in a controlled manner.\u201d\nEvergrande said two weeks ago that its total liabilities had swelled to 1.97tn yuan ($305bn) and warned of risks of defaults on borrowings.\nIt issued a profit warning at the end of August in which it admitted that it could default on debt payments. The warning came days after Xu, the third richest person in China, resigned as chairman of its real estate arm.\n\n=========================\n\nMy POV:\n- I haven\u2019t been able to find the full list of Evergrande investors/debt holders\u2026seems purposely opaque\u2026not a good sign.\n- $300B is a huge number\u2026and I\u2019m concerned some \u201cgenius finance folks\u201d repackaged the debt into thousands of smaller CDS products that are about to infect the global financial system.",

I understand Amd and Nvda have taken some market share for themselves and the deal with Apple ended last year, aside from this I believe the company is solid and should not be trading anywhere near the p/e it currently is \n\nDell - seems like a solid move with the 5 bil buyback taking place, technicals are strong \n\nMrk - Merck and Co seems a bit undervalued and the technicals are showing buy, nice dividend, slow mover but nice for the long term\n\nYeti Holdings - liking the breakdown we are seeing and I will be waiting for the right time to add this one, love their products, low p/e, nice strong trend, what is not to like ???? Maybe they should merge with crox and run together!!!! \n\nAbbVie - I like the weekly chart coming back down to the 50 ma for a buy, looks like a big cup and handle forming, adding this along with AZN \n\nDocusign - any dips I'm buying \n\nAfrm - swinging for new highs, technicals are strong, looking for a breakout very soon \n\nAmd - still holding strong \n\nDkng - love it long term, adding dips whenever possible \n\nNetflix - loaded months ago, up nicely and holding\n\nTesla - not selling, new highs coming",

        "selftext": "So you might have heard of these 2 like really big boomer companies: Visa and Mastercard. They both had great earnings but since the end of July V is down around 10% and MA around 15%. Red week after red week. You might wonder why. The thing is that no one really knows, as no really strong fundamental bearish argument can be dug up. \n\nSome people are saying that the recent drop is due to the BNPL companies pick up some steam. While that might me the case, I don't really see them taking the place of V and MA in the next few years. \n\nFirstly, they currently obey little to no regulation. We all know where that leads. The central banks around the world won't allow for much longer for \"\"fintechs\"\" to go around lending money with very little to no credit check. Debt is already starting to form bubbles in different sectors of the market (look at govies, fucking Greece borrowing at negative interest rates lol, but more importantly the junk bonds are quite on fire with everyone trying to get some decent returns but that makes the yields drop even more). What nobody wants is a fucking retail debt bubble. So IF BNPL continues to get more market share, regulators will surely step in rather sooner than later. \n\nA second point is the demographics of the BNPL. Everyone has a credit/debit card, but not everyone is going to open accounts with fintechs to buy shit. Why would they do it when they already have that since forever from a bank that they more or less trust? BNPL is more appealing to the Z crowd, while the millenials and boomers (the segments having the highest wealth and spending) go with the credit cards. Not to mention the high and ultra high income people. \n\nLastly (I have a few more points really but I'm bored talking about fucking BNPL), take a look at their valuations. Some BNPLs are worth like 15-20% of V. Companies that are losing (a lot of) money year after year. \n\nSo, BNPL aside, why do I think V and MA will go up? Well, multiple reasons:\n\n* the market will realize sooner or later that they are trading bellow fair price and as such the market will level this out. You can make money by getting ahead of the market or by riding the wave up;\n* travel picking up again, Delta is just noise for the countries with high vaccination rates; this increases spending and even better spending in foreign currency; the FX revenues of these companies has understandably fallen since the pandemic;\n* more and more payments are going cashless. While this has been true for a few years all around the world, the trend has picked up some pace especially in the emerging and developing countries where the entire market share goes to V and MA. \n* spending season is set to start. You can figure out yourself what this means\n* earnings are also approaching. By this fact alone the companies will get more attention from the smart money. If you decide to play this via options, you will get a nice vega bump\n* price action: after dropping like 2 rocks, they actually had a decent week until they were taken down with the market last Friday\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPositions? I have V and MA shares in my boring investment account. I added more on the drop. I also have 225 and 227.5 calls on V expiring next Friday (the retard in me) and Oct 15 230, 235 and 240 calls. I exited my MA position because I was getting way overleveraged on this play, but I still hold my thesis.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHow you can play this? Well, the safest way is through shares. It might not be this week or this month, but this companies WILL go up. Other than that... calls ofc. I would advise at least 2 weeks out, but try to go for a month or more. I would go for the 230 and 235 on V, similar OTM strikes for MA. Or you could also play it wsb style with 227.5 for next Friday.",

        "selftext": " \n\nAlibaba,\n\nThe largest Chinese e-commerce company that has been dropping consistently since October of last year. (at this point in time, it has fallen over 50% from its historical highs)\n\nIt all started when CEO Jack Ma decided it would be a splendid idea to insult the Chinese government (saying that their regulations are outdated) in front of the Chinese government.\n\nIt was not a particularly intelligent move on Mr. Ma\u2019s part.\n\nDuring the first few months of his absence, many speculated that he was locked in prison, silenced, or worse by the Chinese government. Since then, we have confirmation that the man is still alive and well, but he is not making nearly the number of public appearances that he used to. Although I don\u2019t know for sure, I am willing to speculate that he was just under house arrest while Mr. Xi gave him a good spanking and made sure he didn\u2019t get so cocky again.\n\nThis and more recent complications with China, However, plunged the stock price to 2017 levels. The more recent complications I include the fear of nationalization, a 2.8 billion dollar fine on Alibaba, forcing the company to share its data, the shutdown of the Chinese tutoring industry, the restrictions on the gaming industry, the impending of the Evergrande collapse, and etc. All this has contributed to the rapid decline of most Chinese companies traded in the US.\n\nToday, I would like to analyze the risks of Alibaba. There are plenty of posts and videos out there covering the clear difference between Alibaba\u2019s stock price and its intrinsic value, but I think a blind man could even see that Alibaba is currently ludicrously undervalued when looking at its numbers, which is why I think it is more important to look at the current risks of Alibaba.\n\nFirst of all, the greatest risk to an investor in Alibaba is simply that the stock keeps tumbling while being driven by negative sentiment and momentum, plus it does not help when it seems that there is addition bad new coming out of China every month. But if one is thinking in the long term, this risk of this is negligible, as Alibaba still sits at a very attractive price.\n\nSecondly, the risk of nationalization. I find the fact that people think China is going to kill the hand that has been feeding them for the past decades (free market capitalism) ridiculous. Sure, the Chinese government has definitely not adopted a Les Affaires approach to capitalism seeing that they are more than willing to control certain sectors of the economy, but I can guarantee that they are not planning on reverting to good old communism, as it has clearly not served them well in the past.\n\nContinuing on the point of nationalization: the shutdown of the entire Chinese tutoring industry and restriction of the gaming industry was a bit extreme, but I would assume that the CCP would argue that it was a necessary move to deal with China\u2019s growing demographic problem. (If you are interested in that check out this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vTbILK0fxDY&amp;ab_channel=PolyMatter)).\n\nIn terms of numbers, you can actually see the effects of the 2.8-billion-dollar anti-trust fine on BABA\u2019s balance sheet. Although it looks quite painful in the short term, this fine will likely not hinder the company\u2019s performance or FCF significantly in the long term. Most importantly, this fine will not have a substantial impact on the company\u2019s valuation.\n\nSadly, I do not have enough expertise or knowledge to touch on the part of Alibaba sharing its data and how that would affect the company\u2019s valuation or future. I also do not understand in detail the nature of the Evergrande collapse to confidently discuss how that would affect Alibaba.\n\nNevertheless, I still think Alibaba presents a uniquely asymmetrical investment opportunity at this moment based on the extreme undervaluation, high growth, and hopefully, a current market overreaction to all the bad news coming out of China at roughly the same time. I understand that I left out a couple minor and major points regarding what is currently happening in relation to Alibaba, but I am simply too exhausted to research or type anymore so this is all you are getting. To conclude, I had already invested a couple thousand dollars into a few BABA shares and long term ATM options, and I am excited to see what happens in the coming months and years.\n\nWhat do you guys think about the risks with Alibaba?",

        "selftext": "**Summary:**\n\n* Affirm is a major player in the booming \u201cpoint of sale financing\u201d or \u201cbuy now pay later\u201d niche.\n* Affirm lets online shoppers choose an installment plan at checkout.\n* The point of sale financing market exploded during the pandemic and is expected to keep growing fast.\n* Competitor Afterpay was recently acquired by Square, and there is speculation that Affirm may be an acquisition target.\n\n**What they do:**\n\nAffirm operates a point-of-sale payment solution for consumers. Its payment network allows consumers to pay for purchases with an installment plan.  \n \n\nAffirm pays the merchant the full amount upfront. They charge an APR of 10 to 30 percent, depending on the plan and on the buyer\u2019s credit. The Affirm app makes it easy for buyers to keep track of payments and sends reminders.  \n \n\nAffirm also receives a fee from merchants. Online sellers have found that point-of-sale financing increases sales volume and reduces cart abandonment, so they are willing to pay for the service.  \n \n\nThere were over 12,000 active merchants using the Affirm platform in March 2021, more than double the number in the same quarter of 2020. Active consumers grew 60% to 5.4 million in the same period. Gross merchandise volume grew 83% to $2.3 billion.  \n \n\nAffirm has an exclusive relationship with Shopify ($SHOP), and provides point-of-sale financing to Shopify merchants.  \n \n\nShopify is a leading competitor to Amazon. They are growing at a wild rate: gross merchandise volume was up 119% in the last reported quarter and the number of merchants with Shopify stores has been rising at 126% a year. Shopify now powers over 1.7 million businesses in more than 175 countries.  \n \n\nAffirm\u2019s relationship with Shopify allows them to offer their services to an enormous and rapidly growing customer base.\n\n**Why they\u2019re spiking in interest:**  \n \n\nReddit mentions of $AFRM in the last 8 days leaped 875% from the previous 8-day period.  \n \n\nThe surge was kicked off by the August 3 news that Affirm will work with Apple ($AAPL) to provide installment plans for Apple device purchasers in Canada.  \n \n\nThat announcement was followed on August 5 with news that Square ($SQ) is acquiring Australian buy-now-pay-later provider Afterpay for $29 billion. Affirm shares gained 18% on the combined news.  \n \n\nThe Square/Afterpay combination will provide competition for Affirm, but it also brought attention to the sector.  \n \n\nThere has been speculation that another major player seeking to move into the buy-now-pay-later space will acquire Affirm rather than develop their own system.  \n \n\nShopify (which already owns 7.6% of Affirm), PayPal, and even card giants like Visa and Mastercard have been suggested as potentially interested in acquiring Affirm.  \n \n\nNotable comments from Reddit:  \n \n\n\"I\u2019m long on $AFRM. The financial sector is dinosaurs through and through. If you\u2019ve ever applied for (and received) a mortgage, it\u2019s a nightmare. It requires little imagination on my part for Affirm or \u201cGreen Sky\u201d to open up to home and auto loans.\"\n\n\\- PinBot1138  \n \n\n\u201cPeople should probably get AFRM for when it gets acquired for a free 30%.\u201d  \n \\- Lukebreit  \n \n\nSignal: Over 77% of the $AFRM float is held by institutions. Scottish investment management firm Baillie Gifford is the largest institutional holder, with over $75 million worth of shares.\n\n \n\n**Why $AFRM could be valuable:**\n\nThe buy-now-pay-later has enormous upward momentum. Sales have increased dramatically and the increase is expected to continue. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMcKinsey &amp; Company\u2019s annual POS Financing Survey found that about 60% of consumers are likely to use point-of-sale financing over the next six to 12 months.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAffirm founder and CEO Max Levchin has a record of developing successful and innovative payment systems: he\u2019s one of the founders of PayPal.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAffirm does not charge late payment fees and has a fixed monthly payment system. This feature is attractive to users who are concerned with the complexities of credit card billing and payment.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAffirm\u2019s Net Promoter Score - a measure of customer loyalty - places the company at 78, above Amazon and just below Apple. 64% of transactions are from repeat users, and repeat customers spend an average of $2,200 per year. Delinquency rates were just over 1% in 2020.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSix of 10 analysts covering the stock rate it \u201cBuy\u201d, with the other 4 placing it at \u201cHold\u201d. The consensus price target is $76.71, 14% above the current level.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRapid user growth, high customer retention, and a rapidly expanding market add up to very strong growth prospects for $AFRM.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe stock has dropped to under 50% of its post-IPO surge of $140 per share and has settled into a steady band in the $60-$70 range.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPost-IPO hype often drives new listings to unrealistic valuations. When they drop back to a more realistic level many retail investors become frustrated and drop out. That leaves a core of institutional holders and a strong base for appreciation of positive news.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**What the risks are:**\n\nAffirm is not profitable and is not expected to achieve profitability soon. The Company also has a high debt/equity ratio of 87.95%. The Company has adequate working capital but the combination of debt and losses is still a concern.  \n \n\nAffirm operates in a highly competitive market. Right now that market is dominated by relatively new companies like Afterpay, and Klarna. The sector\u2019s rapid growth could attract competition from larger companies with greater financial capacity than Affirm.  \n \n\nAffirm faces credit risk. Default rates have been extremely low, but unexpected events could drive them high enough to affect the Company\u2019s results.  \n \n\nAffirm is exposed to a potential economic downturn. A recession could reduce the discretionary purchases that drive much of the Company\u2019s gross merchandise volume and increase default rates.  \n \n\nThe buy-now-pay-later sector could attract increased government regulation, which could affect the Company's results and stock price.  \n \n\n***Bottom line:***\u00a0*Affirm\u2019s lack of profitability makes it a speculative play. But its rapid revenue growth and established position in an exploding market make it an interesting speculative play. There is strong potential for acquisition and for medium to long-term growth. Watch for the release of Q4 and full FY 2021 results, scheduled for Sept. 9.*",

EMA10 is a known moving average (widely accepted among traders) that is used as reference since it has been stable since 08/31 (**18 days and counting**). **EMA10 = 12.09, and this is my reference point.** \n\nI dissected each candle by marking the highs, body tops, body lows, and candle low. I kept 15.32 from yesterday thinking that this **prior resistance may turn into support**. (Disregard today's candle.  I did not take a screenshot yesterday)\n\n[DISSECTION](https://preview.redd.it/d4j5seallbp71.png?width=1680&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2be7525d958cbb791f3965cf5afa3ddabdfcc601)\n\nI narrowed to the 30MIN chart per usual and watched the open to look for support. There were buyers and the candle closed high at 13.50. The next candle filled the gap and closed at the prior candle low, and that showed **12.25 as a potential** support. Recall that EMA10 = 12.09, which the **likelihood of 12.25 being support** **was good I thought**, and my entry was at 12.30. Again, I am **thinking in terms of probabilities**.  The price dropped to fill the gap at 11.82. Buyers stepped in a created a wide range. After that, **price continued dropping to 11.20**. Everyone was likely discouraged and stomachs were churning, I know it!  I got all sorts of messages asking me what I thought or should do. All I did was **practice emotional control**, focused on the chart, and went through the **RULES** again! My edge is the ability to tune out noise, focus my thoughts, and remain discipline. I don\u2019t allow noise to **control my trade**. By the end of the day, the **continuity momentum helped $ATER recover** from 11.20 to close 12.00. Notice that the close was on a **bullish engulfing** candle as well. \n\n[PRICE ACTION](https://preview.redd.it/h7qu7u8rlbp71.png?width=1680&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a21cccd8f77c0b5f13d5e66c0ed9b665bde3ceb4)\n\nIs my entry at 12.30 at risk?  I wouldn't have put myself in harms way if I was not **convicted**. \n\n[DISCLOSURE](https://preview.redd.it/4xrupu77mbp71.png?width=1118&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c6817d68a9514aa9987a150a5a52ea863ce8b007)\n\nLet's take a look to see if $ATER changed character: \n\n1. Closed 12.00, which is a touch below EMA10 12.08\n2. CR = 23%, but not worried as a low CR is characteristic of a distribution \n3. EMA21 10.40 \n4. Accumulation days still outnumber distributions. \n\n[VOLUME, MA, CR](https://preview.redd.it/dtpp2p7wlbp71.png?width=1680&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=94f367e5e8725dfff337d17ed7380da9fcf998b8)\n\n**Character has not changed**. The rules have not been broken. Price was still **drawn to EMA10**. A weak stock would have continued selling off past support. $ATER recovered like a **monster stock** that it is and pulled itself back to EMA10.  In the same fashion, I expect the trend to continue with $ATER advancing upward as before.  \n\nRemember, **all indicators are lagging measures**! There is no such thing as a forward-looking indicator. This is the proper use of MA\u2019s . Strengths and weaknesses are determined by comparing current price to the past. MA\u2019s are records of past behavior, and if the current price is above an MA, then this is a **demonstration of strength.** The converse applies, where the stock is considered weak if the current price is below its history. \n\nI disclosed my position to prove that I am invested. I\u2019ve been accused of pumping and banned from different forums on Reddit. I wanted to show that I mean what I say. I said yesterday that I will be looking for an entry and I took a screenshot to show that I\u2019ve carried out what I said I would do. \n\nPlease allow me to study more for the plan tomorrow! \n\nAs always, thanks for reading!",

In short, I\u2019m not really seeing my money \u201cwork for me.\u201d Despite having almost $69,000 invested in the market across stocks, bonds, and ETFs, I\u2019ve only seen a net gain of about $1,411, which is quite disheartening.

        "selftext": "When I started trading I was trying to follow the mantra of \"don't invest more than you're willing to lose.\" This resulted in sort of a max of $400-500 that I would put in per individual stock and I definitely had too many going at once to see any legit profit. \n\nI have also read that I should have specific rules set and follow them, setting emotions aside. With this, I have set my initial investment around $1-2K as well as buying puts to hedge potential drops and/or setting Stop Limits for a % I would be willing to lose. My goal is to hit around a 20-30% ROI before selling. There are a few I plan to just buy and Hold, but others I would like to swing trade over the span of a few months. \n\nThe more I think about it, wouldn't it be better to put far more (10-20K) into a stock that is very likely to increase in value over time, like blue chip stocks - wait for it to drop to a 20-50 day MA, invest and look to get out when that 20% is hit. \n\nBut you can't time the market! I know, I know but stocks like MSFT, AAPL, JNJ, PG and many others aren't likely to just drop to 0 even if they do have a pullback (which is when I would buy). Plus, I would have purchased a Put and/or set a stop loss with what I'm comfortable losing. \n\nHow hard do you all go in on your initial investment and do you really need to up the ante to see consistently high returns? What are your thoughts on going in heavy on a strong stock and swing trading it?",

        "selftext": "I know you hairy bastards only like eating crayons that only have the potential to go up 1000% in a week but I look for more realistic plays. Don't bother reading if you're only interested in 10 baggers because I am speculating that this stock is undervalued by about 50% \\*only\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHeavy insider buying and big growth potential make this already under-valued stock look even more attractive.\n\n**Company Overview**\n\n**Website**: https://www.selectquote.com/\n\n**Market cap at publishing**: $2.3B\n\n**Price at publishing**: $13.80\n\n**Price Target**: $20.96 (52% upside)\n\n**CEO**: Tim Danker\n\n**Headquarters**: Overland Park, KS\n\n**Founded**: 1985\n\n**Employees**: 3,300\n\n**Company Overview**\n\nSelectQuote, Inc. operates a technology-enabled, direct-to-consumer distribution platform that sells a range of insurance policies to consumers from various insurance carriers in the United States. The company operates through three segments: Senior; Life; and Auto &amp; Home. It distributes senior health policies, such as medicare advantage, medicare supplement, medicare part D, and other ancillary senior health insurance-related policies, including prescription drugs, dental, vision, and hearing plans; term life policies; and non-commercial auto and home property, and casualty policies. The company was incorporated in 1999 and is headquartered in Overland Park, Kansas.\n\nThe first thing I like about SelectQuote is they have a simple and easy-to-understand business, they are insurance brokers. They are not an insurer and therefore are protected from any risks associated with underwriting. SelectQuote just sells insurance on behalf of insurers primarily via their website and collects commissions. Commissions are earned once the plan is activated and again for subsequent renewals, they also receive performance bonuses from many of their insurance partners when hitting certain quotas. Currently their lifetime value of commissions or \u201cLTV\u201d which represents commissions estimated to be collected over the estimated life of an approved policy for their two biggest segments, Medicare Advantage and Medicare Supplement stands at $1,260 and $1,269 respectively. SelectQuote estimates that their market share is less than 2.5% in each of the three segments they operate, allowing for plenty of room to grow.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n**Financials**\n\nSelectQuote\u2019s income statement for the year ended June 30, 2021 looks like this:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dnldpz7ruwn71.jpg?width=1894&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ec5cecb2705430c96a81afa429213f3469760d67\n\nBetween 2018 and 2021 CAGR for revenue is an impressive 59% with a 76% increase in revenue over 2020. EBITDA and net income are also up over 40%, all very positive signs of a growing company.\u00a0\n\nHere is a breakdown of where that $938M in revenue came from in 2021:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n2pbkjzsuwn71.jpg?width=1892&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c0a88bb40da7527231225a96107235c38ad3e864\n\n$729M or 77% came from their senior segment which is basically medicare insurance plans. The fact that they are focusing so much on Medicare is significant because that is where most of the future growth will come from as we\u2019ll see in the sections to come.\n\nSome YoY comparisons I like to make:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uuop90iuuwn71.jpg?width=578&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7e543fc4e7cdf626bd095a3efc2649ae73d45f33\n\n The 80% decrease in FCF is primarily due to the adjustment of $333M in commissions receivable to the net income when calculating operating cash flow but this should positively affect their future FCF as those pending commissions are converted to cash.\n\n**Insider Buying**\n\nThis is actually how SelectQuote first hit my radar, I saw large amounts of insider purchases and I decided to dig a little deeper into the company.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/oux9ihbwuwn71.jpg?width=1239&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=534f35d6fd1c062bc3ecc175f822013fe596b872\n\n As you can see, there have been 13 flat-out purchases by the CEO, CFO, COO, and directors in prices ranging from $8.75 all the way up to $13.28 on September 13th, 2021 in addition to eight option exercises. The total value of all purchases comes out to more than $8M. The most notable purchases are the Senior President dropping $2M, the CEO dropping $1M, and the COO dropping $2M, all in Aug 21\u2019when the price was near $9. As an investor, you obviously love to see this. No one knows the company better than these guys and they seem to know that the stock has plenty of upside if they are willing to splashdown that much of their own cash.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n**Analyst Consensus**\n\nDon\u2019t just take it from me, here are the views of \u201cprofessional\u201d analysts. There are 7 analysts covering SelectQuote who have an average PT of $17.93, with a low of $13 and a high of $25. The targets are very much in line with my own PT of $20.96.\u00a0\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2wig56uyuwn71.jpg?width=853&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=86179aefc2f6b033238466ac3965db6816629cf6\n\n### Outlook\n\n**Growth Potential**\n\nSo what does the future hold for SelectQuote? Growth, and lots of it. Growth will come in the way of a larger TAM and a more aggressive push to activate more policies. There are several ways for seniors to sign up for Medicare. The first is to sign up for the \u201ctraditional\u201d government-issued insurance and the other is to sign up for a private market solution, which is basically Medicare offered through an insurance company, this is called Medicare Advantage. Medicare Advantage is SelectQuote\u2019s biggest segment and accounted for 77% of their revenues in 2021. Why is it so important for SelectQuote to focus on Medicare Advantage? Well, the market is growing quickly and so will their share of it. The market is growing thanks to favorable demographic trends that will see more baby boomers reaching 65 years of age. In 2020, the percentage of the population reaching 65 was 15.6%, that\u2019s up from 12.9% in 2010. On average, 10,000 baby boomers are expected to turn 65 every day, or nearly 4 million per year for the next 10 years. Not only will there be more people eligible for Medicare but our grandmas and grandpas are now internet-savvy technophiles. Internet usage among older generations has increased from 40% in 2019 to 75% in 2021,\u00a0 meaning more online shopping that includes everything from diapers to insurance.\u00a0\n\nThere were roughly 60M Medicare policies in 2019, 27M were through Medicare Advantage, representing 38% of the market. Of the 27M Medicare Advantage plans, SelectQuote only accounts for .55M or 2%. According to analysts, the Medicare Advantage market alone is expected to swell to 37M by 2025. If they can reach just 4% of the market by that point, they\u2019ll have roughly 1.5M policies which, if they can maintain their LVT of $1,260/policy will total \\~1.9B in Medicare Advantage revenue alone. I believe they can do even better than 4% because of their improving online targeting and aggressive hiring of agents. As of June 30, 2021, SelectQuote employed a total of 1,356 core agents and hired an additional 3,000 flex employees during the Annual Enrollment Period which is a long way of saying busy season in the insurance industry. In comparison to 2020 when they had 1,000 core agents and 1,400 flex agents, an increase of 36% and 114% respectively. They are also ramping up their marketing by spending $385M in 2021 vs $185M in 2020, a 108% increase.\n\n**Acquisitions**\n\nIn April 21\u2019 SelectQuote launched an online platform called Population Health which is designed to \u201cprovide awareness and education for seniors to ensure the full utilization of their health benefits\u201d. The website is designed to ultimately make contact with MA patients and understand their needs to get them the best care for them. In doing so, they are able to connect these patients with one of their primary care providers (generating commissions) or provide a service of their own. In order to facilitate the growth of Population Health, SelectQuote created SelectQuote Ventures Inc \u201cSVI\u201d to identify potential partnerships and potential acquisitions. So far they have acquired InsideResponse, an online marketing consulting firm for $65M, Lead Distribution Company, which does what its name suggests for $33.5M, and Express Med Pharmaceuticals or SelectRx for $24M.\u00a0\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d9l4kci1vwn71.jpg?width=1873&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1f1faf82eb5e757d25d547a141c559c5613dc343\n\n SelectRx is an interesting pharmaceutical distributor which handles everything there is to handle regarding medications. After gathering information through a consultation, they automatically refill and package medications in easy-to-read and understand packaging and mail it out to their subscribers. SelectRx should provide a healthy ROI, especially when used in conjunction with Population Health. SelectRx is expected to generate $120M in revenue in FY2023 with EBITDA around $20M, not bad for a $24M investment. Both platforms are already performing well as the data below shows. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wwlrywe3vwn71.jpg?width=1372&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9297ec00f6911506df264a1263d18e4897bbff12\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nToday I told the story of a company with a simple and solid business that is at the pinnacle of expertise due to its long exposure to the insurance brokerage business. Although they have been around for a while, they are just starting to hit their stride with the large influx of cash from their IPO ($350M) when they were priced at $20/share. A company that is operating in a market that is undoubtedly growing along with an aging population and who is aggressively seeking to increase their share of said market. They are off to a great start by growing their senior revenue by 101% between 2020 and 2021. They are not just resting on their laurels and focusing on senior revenue but creating a new platform (Population Health) and making acquisitions like SelectRx to expand their offerings.\n\nProbably the most telling point I touched on in this article is the insider buying. SelectQuote\u2019s management at all levels is so convinced of the future of their company that they are willing to splash down large bundles of their own cash all the way up to $13.34/share and I\u2019m not sure they are done yet, I would look for more insider buying in the months to come. If they are so assured of the company\u2019s future why the hell wouldn\u2019t I be?\u00a0\u00a0\n\n**Valuation**\n\nI use a simplified discounted cash flow analysis based on Aswath Damodaran\u2019s teachings at NYU which uses assumptions about future cash flows that are discounted to today\u2019s dollars in order to reach a present valuation. I used the company\u2019s own financial forecasts to guide me up to the year 2022. The discount rate of 6.67% is based on their WACC which was calculated using the assumptions seen below in the \u201cWACC\u201d section. I used 1.2% as the terminal growth rate for the purpose of being conservative. The current value per share I get is $20.96 representing an upside of 53%.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4k6iu1s5vwn71.jpg?width=1138&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0a5ffc46dd2f2935baf78425e12b6aa8da9cd728\n\n**Price Target**\n\nI have a price target of **$20.96** for SelectQuote.\n\n**TL;DR:** Grandparents are getting older and know how to use computer, will use computer to buy Medicare through SelectQuote, stock price go up.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n**My position**\n\nI have not initiated a position in any companies mentioned in this article, however,\n\nI may purchase shares within the next 72 hours.\n\n**Disclaimer**\n\nThe contents on this site/article are for informational and entertainment purposes only and does not constitute financial, accounting, or legal advice.

        "selftext": "What's up Degens??  The $DUDE here with another of my periodic \"Dude Diligence\" reports...\n\nFor those that haven't yet seen Part 1 which was my initial comprehensive look at Clover Health Investments AKA $CLOV here's the link below:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pn6gev/clov\\_dd\\_the\\_dude\\_diligence\\_report\\_912\\_edition/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pn6gev/clov_dd_the_dude_diligence_report_912_edition/)\n\nI've been creating &amp; publishing these periodic due diligence reports more than anything to clear up a lot of the rampant misinformation that's continually perpetuated here on WSB with regards to CLOV.  I'll also be updating it, clarifying sections if needed and fixing typos to keep it fresh and will continue to do this so it can become the one-stop thread here on WSB that any of you CLOV Apes can reference and direct people to if needed.  \n\nI know a lot of the misinfo (unfortunately) ...is passed along (potentially) on purpose because \"...clov is a distraction, blah, blah\" say the $AMC apes, but then wait, isn't \"...amc is the distraction\" according the $GME apes and so on, and so on...\n\nPeople, guess what... all apes are ultimately on the same team and none of these factions are distractions from each other, instead they show a growing collective strength retail traders are building to combat greasy HF's and anyone else aligned with them to manipulate and steal from retail traders.  We're ALL fed up with the lack of transparency in our manipulated system- doesn't matter if you team GME, AMC or CLOV... we can't continue with the infighting, when in the end, we're all fighting for the same thing.  There's plenty to go around when the timing is right for each...\n\nAnyway, this DD report won't be as comprehensive as last weeks- it'll be quite a bit more brief and I'll be focusing on some of the catalyst I believe will be influencing CLOV price action over the next 1-2 months and beyond.\n\nAs always, this is made up of my opinions, I'm not a financial advisor nor is this intended as financial advice.  Invest at your own risk and do your own due diligence.  I like this stock long-term and do currently have a sizable position.  \n\nAlso, I'm more active on Twitter ( [https://twitter.com/nikiped1a](https://twitter.com/nikiped1a) ) than I am here on reddit, so if you like this or any of my other write ups, I'd love to hear your feedback both positive or negative (I'm always doing my best to improve and learn from all of you and know I can get things wrong at times.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**CATALYSTS INFLUENCING CLOV PRICE ACTION LEADING UP TO Q3 EARNINGS**\n\nCLOV Q3 earnings are upcoming with the quarter ending on Oct 31, 2021.  The Earnings Release will be on or around Nov 11th (hasn't been officially announced yet).\n\nFor those of you not familiar with Clover Health Investments- you probably immediately think \"healthcare company\" right?  Well, wrong... kindof.  CLOV is a next-gen technology (software/A.I.) driven company playing in the crusty, dinosaur healthcare industry.  If you think of it any other way, you're entirely missing what their mission is.  It's to change and disrupt a greedy, generally content-to-stay-the-same insurance space (again, if you want more depth, go read my previous write up at the link above)\n\nBefore I get into the most recent items, I want to reiterate what I detailed in my last DD that will really start to come into play in this upcoming ER.  CLOV announced their plan to double their market size at the end of Q2.  So their **140% YoY revenue growth in Q2** did not include any of this potential new territory.\n\n...let that sink in.\n\nCLOV then announced a little over a month later (early Aug '21) their partnership allowing them to now do business in the state of Florida beginning in 2022 stating this:\n\n\"...*Through the arrangement, ValueH will support Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs) and Management Services Organizations (MSOs) participating in Clover\u2019s Direct Contracting Entity beginning in 2022.*\n\n*Clover\u2019s DCE will enable providers to manage the care of their Original Medicare patients with the Clover Assistant. The Clover Assistant is a clinical software tool used by doctors at the point of care to provide them with data-driven, personalized recommendations to improve how they care for their patients. Participating providers can benefit from:*\n\n* ***Unified, Actionable Data****: access lab results, prescription lists, and previous diagnoses, including those from other clinicians*\n* ***Personalized Care Plans****: receive and share new information at each patient visit and have access to clinical decision support*\n* ***Simple, Fast Reimbursement****: receive the Clover Assistant reimbursement within seven days for each patient seen with the Clover Assistant*  \n\n\n*\u201cWe are excited to partner with ValueH to help support our efforts to increase the quality of care delivered to patients while simultaneously lowering medical costs...\u201d*\n\nIn summary, nearly doubling their market potential (not including their new partnership in Florida) will be massive heading into the Medicare Open Enrollment period beginning on Oct 15, 2021 and continuing through Dec 7, 2021.  This will give CLOV 17 days of OE before Q3 ends and provide us with a glimpse into their Medicare Advantage enrollment growth as a teaser in their ER.  \n\nSpeaking of Open Enrollment, one other big announcement that will be provided leading up to Open Enrollment is Clover Health's updated 2022 Medicare Star Rating.\n\nEvery year, Medicare evaluates plans based on a 5-star rating system. Medicare Star Ratings help you know how good a job a plan is doing. You can use these Star Ratings to compare plan's performance to other plans. \n\nAs of last year's rating, Clover Health has a 3.0 star Overall rating (3.5 stars for Health Plans and 3.0 star for Drug Plan Services\n\nThe biggest bit of news relevant to investors that comes from these updated rating will be how much of a \"bonus\" CLOV is paid per life under management.   This chart below shows the variance of Average Bonus paid out per enrollee- some as low as $169 and some as high $660 per enrollee.  \n\nI wasn't able to find specific info on what Clover's payout was this past year, but they definitely have a fair amount of opportunity to increase their star rating and thus increasing bonuses paid out.  Even a marginal 5 -10% bump would be significant to CLOV's operating margins that have raised questions by some potential investors in the rapidly expanding growth company.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/try6xmgu7ko71.png?width=797&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=90a1d576dbed081d7bd3290e03512a357244ae39\n\nMedicare Advantage payout growth 2015-21\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/v5nq8f5j8ko71.png?width=792&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c5c726019b1a930ab19b709c73affd2364356c93\n\nThere was also some news that came out last week about UnitedHealthcare that could be a potential catalyst in a few of the states they operate in.  UHG is facing sanctions from enrolling new members in a number of midwestern states, Arkansas, New Mexico. \n\nThe three UnitedHealthcare plans penalized by the federal government provide coverage for about 86,000 people, which is just a fraction of the company's total Medicare Advantage enrollment of nearly 7.5 million people.  To put that into perspective, Clover currently has around 65K Medicare Advantage enrollees, so even though it's a \"fraction\" of the enrollees to a massive company like UHG, this would be a boon to have less competition in these regions and pick up any of these enrollees in the states CLOV currently operates in, which at this point only seems to be potentially Kansas, but that is based on info that could be out of date.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**HAS THE BOTTOM ARRIVED AND IS A MOMENTUM SHIFT COMING IN HOT?**\n\nFor some others that have been trading and monitoring CLOV for several months and now have a general understand it's daily and weekly patterns, there seems to be a potential shift in sentiment since the middle of August- not surprisingly given their Q2 earnings surprise that I feel shocked a lot of CLOV naysayers and opened a lot of others eyes to the exponential growth opportunity it is beginning to unveil.\n\nOne thing I think, that has been frustrating for some investors is how CLOV's management team hasn't really combatted any of the misinformed attacks on them directly, but instead, through actions and beating expectations.  Personally, I kind of like that approach as we all know talk is cheap, and actions speak much, MUCH louder than words.  It also shows a composed confidence they appear to have in their product and growth opportunity.\n\nI feel these next 5 weeks we are going to see a lot of investors get into CLOV before their next earnings.\n\nI can't confirm this for certain, but this past week a number of people in the CLOV community have seen massive after-hours dark pool prints that could potentially be institutional long buys.  We're talking 1.2M shares purchased AH this past Wed, multiple 1M+ buys on Thurs and numerous 500K-1M+ buys on Fri totaling over 5M shares again, within minutes of market close.\n\nI'm waiting to see what the data looks like tomorrow morning (on Mon, Sept 20th) but from what I can tell, it may be institutional short positions being covered and them shifting to long positions.  Again, this is unconfirmed at this point, but from the information I am seeing- that's what it looks like.\n\nI think it goes without saying that this would be a very bullish signal having between $40-$60M in large single block (institutional) purchases.  I'm going to keep my eye on this and I'd love to hear any of your thoughts on the matter.\n\nLastly, I want to give you all an idea of how I think about CLOV price action.  THIS IS NOT A PRICE TARGET, but instead ranges and timelines of how I think about CLOV.\n\nI'm going to list these out because I've seen a number of probably new or less experienced investors to CLOV post some nervous commentary asking if they should sell (at a loss) or not.  My advice is this;  look at the data, look at the potential long term- in my view, everything is screaming #BullishAF.  Do your own DD and know what you're working with.\n\nSometimes you just have to check out when it's in the midst of declining 7 straight trading sessions so you're not watching every single move downward, wanting to punch your monitor.  Keep the long-term perspective in mind stick with your gut intuition.\n\nWith that said, here are some ranges I think we \\*could\\* see over the next 9-12 months and how I look at it:\n\n**Sept 20th - approx. Nov 15 (whenever Q3 earnings are released):  $7.50- $12 range**\n\nCLOV could very well dip back down to $7.50, though at this point, I feel it would be unlikely.  Barring any macro economic event, I see us prob staying above $8 moving forward as this is a great accumulation zone.  I think we could see some quick spikes back up to$10 or $11+ but I don't see us breaking $12 until we get Q3 data and have a clearer picture of the direction of the company in terms of FCF, revenue, open enrollment momentum, etc.  If all this comes in strong, expect a significant surge in sustainable price, not just a pump and dump.\n\n**Nov 15 - approx. Feb 15 (when Q4 earnings are released): $12- $17 range**\n\nI think this is conservative, but I like setting conservative expectations and then being surprised on the upside.  \n\nI really think this could be a huge quarter because Open Enrollment will have come and gone, CLOV will probably jump from the 65Kish MA lives under mgmt to 75-80K+ and continue their 20%+ annual growth rate, however, what gets interesting is their Direct Contracting Entity numbers currently at \\~60K.  \n\nThe Q4 ER will not only include all the MA enrollees, but it will include a month of the DCE number that will be counted between  Jan 1-31 2022.  I wouldn't be surprised if we see this jump 10's of thousands, especially with the Florida partnership becoming active as well.  CLOV could have 100-150K+ DCE enrollees, putting upwards of a quarter million lives total (DCE+MA) under mgmt.  \n\nOf note, and not that it matters because I think all these ratings firms are corrupt and in on the market manipulation, but CLOV initially had $18-$20 PT's from a number of these large firms when CLOV had mentioned the potential of 200K lives under mgmt.  If we're 25% more than that, where does the PT go?\n\nAlso of note, even those I hate these greasy analysts, we very well could see some PT upgrades even before Q3 ER (after the firm buys in a $8 today, and then manipulates the price in their favor by upgrading it shortly afterward, just like we've saw them do (BoA and Cowen) with their short positions on the way down \\*facepalm\\* ...honestly, it's such a joke.  I don't know why anyone other than Boomers (that knew a more trustworthy American system in better days of yore compared to our dumpster fire that's being run into the ground today) that trust these anal-yst tools... but I digress.\n\nWhat I'm getting at is that when an upgrade or new PT comes, that could accelerate these ranges I'm listing substantially.\n\n**Feb 15- approx. May 15 (whenever Q1 earnings are released): $17- $45+ ( range**\n\nIf at this point, we see 3 solid earnings reports or even 2 out of 3 for Q2, Q3 and Q4, it will be hard to stop this bulldozer moving forward and I think we start to see it's true value being represented in it's stock price.\n\nAnd last but not least- I'm basing these ranges off of fundamentals, not a squeeze... Do remember, there IS a potential of a juicy squeeze in there at some point- ...but in my mind, that's just the icing.   \n\nLFG CLOV APES!!!",

        "selftext": "I have been looking around and I want to play with weeklies and SPY options to help grow my account and I wondered what will be some good and effective strategies? I know some people go out and buy monthlies, LEAPS, etc. but I want to grow my account faster and I want to try a strategy with weeklies and same day lottos. My plan is to use these indicators:\n\nVWAP (Volume weighted average price): Anything above the VWAP indicates an uptrend and anything below the VWAP indicates a potential downtrend. \n\nBollinger Bands: The Bollinger Bands signify price within two standard deviations of a moving average and in this case we are going to use the 20 day moving average. The tighter the Bollinger bands are together, that signifies less volatility and it could signify a potential breakout that might come later on. If the candle is trending or moving on the bollinger band upwards, it signifies a continuation of that trend and vice versa, if it moving downwards that trend continues. My plan is to use bollinger bands along with VWAP.\n\nExponential moving averages (EMA)/ MA: When day trading, I am thinking about using the 9 day EMA and the Bollinger 20 day EMA when conducting my trades. I will be looking to use these EMA/MA as a support and resistance and I am thinking a good entry timing is when there is a specific trend and two green candles on the 1 min or the 5 min off the 9 EMA. If there are two green candles that close above the 9 EMA, that signifies an uptrend for me and two red candles that close below the 9 EMA, that signifies a downtrend for me. If the candle deflects off the 9 day EMA and back towards a trend, it's showing trend strength and a potential continuation and if it break the 9 day EMA it shows a reversal. If the bollinger bands is tighter, then we could potentially look at the 20 MA on the bollinger as a potential bounce too. I think if the 9 EMA/20 MA cross, it signifies a potential change in direction or trend too.\n\nSupport/Resistance Lines/Price Levels/RSI: I almost forgot about these but price levels, support, resistance, trend-lines do matter and we have to draw them actively on our charts when day trading especially when doing this with SPY. If there is a price level, it could break down or a potential bounce. On a price level from a previous or current day that fails to break, it could obviously break down but a reversal and candles to signify that reversal so could potentially signify an entry too. I seen some really good bounces and reversals off price levels but sometimes they break to lower lows and higher highs on certain time frames. \n\nEverything is very complicated and there is no one fit's all strategy but should we use all this together? I plan on trading SPY options (weeklies and daily lottos), I know swings (trades more than 1 day) use other techniques but my question do most people who trade weeklies enter in as a day trade or do they trade those weeklies/bi-weeklies overnight too? Seems very risky but I want to start growing my account and getting on a roll. I know I can do swings which range from 2 weeks to 2 months or more but I traded using VWAP, EMAs/MAs, and Bollingers and I had some very good success with catching on some 100% 200% moves and I want to try winning those again.",

        "selftext": "Hello fellow apes,\n\nApellis Pharmaceuticals is a pharmaceutical company which develops, manufactures and distributes medicine to patients around the world. They have a medicine which already has already been approved by the FDA and therefore they are already selling their product and have a somewhat stable revenue stream. This medicine, called pegcetacoplan is also scheduled to be reviewed by the European Medicines Agency.\n\n# The Growth Play\n\n[Apellis submitted their medicine for review in September 2020](https://investors.apellis.com/news-releases/news-release-details/apellis-announces-submission-pegcetacoplan-marketing), and [EMA recognized their approval in October of 2020](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/report/applications-new-human-medicines-under-evaluation-chmp-october-2020_en.pdf). Search for \"pegcetacoplan\" in the second link's pdf. [In May, the FDA approved pegcetacoplan for adults with rare blood disease](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-safety-and-availability/fda-approves-new-treatment-adults-serious-rare-blood-disease). On the day of the approval the stock jumped 25%. We know this medicine works. All that is left is the EMA approval, which would allow Apellis to market and sell the product in Europe as well. On top of their projected revenue growth in the US, they're entering an entire new market through which they will be able to grow as well. Apellis has had growth in their revenue over the past three quarters.\n\n# Recent Events\n\nApellis is currently 48% down from it's 52 week high of $73.00 which it hit on July second. This is because of disappointing results from a study for an unrelated product to pegcetacoplan which came out September 9th, a day on which the stock dropped by around 40%. Since the drop, there hasn't been any significant news. The medicine which failed a clinical trial was an eye treatment projected to bring in significant revenues to the company. Although many analysts have slashed their price targets, the average price target remains at $67. The company's revenue hasn't taken a hit and won't take a hit since they weren't selling the other product to begin with.\n\nBy the way, another trial result released the same day for the same medicine was successful, with the medicine hitting it's primary endpoint.\n\n[Barron's wrote an article on September 22nd](https://www.barrons.com/articles/midcap-biotech-stock-picks-51632326428?siteid=yhoof2) on how several mid-size biotech stocks had significant breakout potential, including (Ape)llis.\n\n# The Technical Play\n\n[Apellis stock chart alongside 30 day MA and triangle](https://preview.redd.it/x4x3pefkb5q71.png?width=1849&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bee6f63bcb4cc339087903df94c40883d41386f4)\n\nApellis moved up 11.66% throughout the day, opening at $31.25 and closing at $35.06, moving past its 50 day moving average, and is forming a somewhat familiar pattern to us apes. Most technical indicators are saying that the stock is about to make a big move up, and today was only the start.\n\nDespite this sharp upwards movement, Apellis is not even near being overbought according to it's 5 day, or 14 day, or 30 day RSI. Indicating that it still has room to grow even more in the very near future\n\n[Apellis stock chart alongside RSI](https://preview.redd.it/wbiq32wfc5q71.png?width=655&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bb616d6988bb3b15923662366a4736797445f3e6)\n\n# Tl;dr:\n\nApellis is a biopharmaceutical company poised to get approval to advertise and sell one of it's major products, pegcetacoplan, which has *already* received approval from the FDA for advertisement and sale in the United States. The stock is also showing several technical indicators that it is about to break out, moving past it's 50 day moving average in an 11.66% upswing just today.\n\n# Ape Summary:\n\n(Ape)llis ($APLS) gonna sell more stuffs, so stonk go up.

TheStreet score**\n\nThe first filtering step is to get stocks with Buy recommendation at TheStreet stock screener. I\u2019m only keeping stocks with A+, A or A- rating (top ones), although A-, B+, B and B- are Buys as well.\n\nFrom thestreet.com:\n\n***A (Excellent)*** *\u2013 The stock has an excellent track record for maximizing performance while minimizing risk, thus delivering the best possible combination of total return on investment and reduced volatility. It has made the most of the recent economic environment to maximize risk-adjusted returns compared to other stocks. While past performance is just an indication \u2014 not a guarantee \u2014 we believe this fund is among the most likely to deliver superior performance relative to risk in the future as well.*\n\nAnd about the methodology (source: https://www.thestreet.com/r/ratings/reports/detail/T.html):\n\n*TheStreet Ratings\u2019 stock model projects a stock\u2019s total return potential over a 12-month period including both price appreciation and* ***dividends****. Our Buy, Hold or Sell ratings designate how we expect these stocks to perform against a general benchmark of the equities market and interest rates. While our model is quantitative, it utilizes both* ***subjective*** *and* ***objective*** *elements. For instance, subjective elements include expected equities market returns, future interest rates, implied industry outlook and forecasted company earnings. Objective elements include volatility of past operating revenues, financial strength, and company cash flows.*\n\n**2. Zacks Rank**\n\nIt is required that the Zacks Rank is Hold, Buy or Strong Buy (so we\u2019re avoiding stocks with Sell and Strong Sell recommendations). The Zacks Rating utilizes a completely different system, based on company earnings-related data, in particular earnings estimate revisions and earnings surprises, to predict profitability of holding the company\u2019s shares. More from https://www.zacks.com/education/stock-education/zacks-rank-guide-6:\n\n*A portfolio of Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks has beaten the market in 26 of the last 31 years with an average annual return of* ***+24.3%*** *a year; more than double that of the S&amp;P 500\u2019s +10.6% .*\n\n**3. Weiss Ratings recommendation**\n\nWe\u2019re only keeping stocks with Buy (B) or Strong Buy (A) recommendation.\n\nWjat are these scores? This is what I found at their website:\n\n*\u201cA\u201d Rating:* ***Excellent.*** *The company\u2019s stock has an excellent track record for providing strong performance with lower-than-average risk, and it is trading at a price that represents good value relative to the company\u2019s earnings prospects. While past performance is no guarantee of future results, our opinion is that this stock is among the most likely to deliver superior performance relative to risk in the future. Of course, even the best stocks can decline in a down market. But our \u201cA\u201d rating can generally be considered the equivalent of a \u201c****Strong Buy****\u201c.*\n\n*\u201cB\u201d rating:* ***Good.*** *The company\u2019s stock has a good track record for delivering a balance of performance and risk. While the risk-adjusted performance of any stock is subject to change, our opinion is that this stock is a good value, with good prospects for outperforming the market. Although even good investments can decline in a down market, our \u201cB\u201d rating is considered the equivalent of a \u201c****Buy****\u201c.*\n\n**4.  Yahoo Finance  recommendation and target price**\n\nIt is required that the Yahoo Finance stock recommendation is at least mixed Buy/Hold from experts. Additionally, the predicted target price (average, from experts) should be at least 5% higher than the current one.\n\n**5. Piotroski F-Score**\n\nThe Piotroski score is a number between 0-9 that reflects nine criteria used to determine the strength of a company\u2019s financial situation, including profitability, leverage or operating efficiency. Zero is the worst value and nine is the best. As we can read in[ Piotroski\u2019s paper](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/9dc9/b030da18ab28d1e1a1bbf7e33fb5911f189e.pdf) from 2000:\n\n*In addition, an investment strategy that buys expected winners and shorts expected losers generates a* ***23% annual return*** *between 1976 and 1996, and the strategy appears to be robust across time and to controls for alternative investment strategies.*\n\nIt is required that the score is 4 or higher. The values were retrieved from https://www.gurufocus.com.\n\n**6. InvestorsObserver Overall Score**\n\nThe rank has a value in between 0 and 100. It takes into account both **technical** analysis and **fundamental** stock data. An Overall Rank of N means that a given company is rated above N% of stocks, therefore the higher the number, the better. My requirement is that the company has InvestorsObserver Overall score of at least 50.\n\n*The Overall Score combines our two technical scores (Short Term and Long Term) with our Fundamental Score into one metric. This makes our overall score a great place to start when evaluating stocks, regardless of your investing style.*\n\n*A low score doesn\u2019t necessarily mean a stock is likely to go down, just that our system doesn\u2019t think there\u2019s much of a bullish case for it.*\n\nPlease note that the company profile data (short description) was taken from  tradingview (sometimes I shortened it) and dividend data was retrieved from MarketBeat.\n\nI hope you enjoyed the reading.

        "selftext": "Hopefully, you've studied enough from  the prior article to follow.  We'll begin, however, with the basics in  understanding candles and volume.  Think of candles as a fight between  SHORTS and BUYERS, and the ending point (CLOSING RANGE=CR) shows who is  in control.  A CR 40% or more is considered good support by buyers.   Volume tells us the strength in a move.  For example, if there was an  increase +20% but BELOW average volume, the move is not supported and a  drop/correction is expected.\n\nCONTINUITY  is the trend direction.  This is found by looking at longer timeframes,  which I use the monthly.  If the CR is lower than the prior bar, then  expect a downtrend and vice versa.  Look at volume to see if there is  strength supporting the move.\n\n$ATER  monthly shows a candle above the prior month, CR 80.95% and above  average volume.  We can clearly see that $ATER is in an uptrend.  ALSO,  KEEP IN MIND THAT THIS IS ONLY 1 WEEK IN SEPT AND VOLUME HAS ALREADY  SURPASSED AUG. THIS IS AN EXPLOSIVE CHANGE IN CHARACTER !!\n\n[ CR = \\(CLOSE-LOW\\) \\/ \\(HIGH \\/ LOW\\) ](https://preview.redd.it/ohp5aywtrym71.png?width=1680&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b6db9341d1db3d26c83e0ff82eff604e7eb5253e)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[ WEEKLY CR + VOLUME ](https://preview.redd.it/n12eiq1wrym71.png?width=1680&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=23c622566a334be34279dbce01492e57c0d2e544)\n\n A consolidation can be detected by looking at price action where price  remains within a level while the volume dries up.  Volume dries up as  the number of SELLERS decrease and price remains within a level as  BUYERS support the price.  $ATER consolidated after a big move in a  clear pennant formation before a HUGE inflow of buyers. \n\n[ CONSOLIDATION ](https://preview.redd.it/z747d0zzrym71.png?width=1680&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=616699553cbd66eb9f87a14716b32d9eb7ca63b5)\n\n You should already be familiar with MOTHER BARS and price action breaking the highs and lows of these bars: \n\n[MOTHER BARS](https://preview.redd.it/kafioo03sym71.png?width=1680&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c43b3cefac901da636af04f10ed9893db1478a85)\n\nA stock below the 50 day simple  moving average (SMA) is generally considered a \"sick\" stock.  $ATER is  above the 50SMA. The MA's I use (other traders may differ) are EMA10  (green), EMA21 (yellow), SMA50 (red).\n\nNOTICE THAT 1ST BAR BREAKS 50SMA, 2ND CONFIRMS 50SMA BY REBOUND, AND 3RD IS A BREAKOUT.  $ATER IS ALIVE AND HEALTHY !!\n\n[50SMA BREAKOUT AND CONFIRMATION](https://preview.redd.it/3z0t41j6sym71.png?width=1680&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=09c0bfaad91fce08d86ce860135bc812db576981)\n\nLet's star off by looking at risk.  I'm worried that price may be a  little extend and a pullback occurs.  How so?  Well, $ATER broke out of  consolidation and short term resistance and ran above the MA's.  Fridays  closing range was 51%, which means that sellers were active (possibly  from those who bought in the 3's).  However, remember that a CR 40% or  more is supportive.  Bullish indicators to consider is an UPTREND  continuity, ABNORMALLY HIGH VOLUME, and a recent EXPLOSIVE CHANGE IN  CHARACTER, and 50SMA CONFIRMATION AS SUPPORT. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6l3qdd3dsym71.png?width=1680&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eaac2ee441709c1bcc4dc03f54ad78f6c77672ac\n\nSo, am I worried about a pullback?   Obviously, no.  Why?  $ATER is a YOUNG BULL and volume has been EXTREME.   I expect a pullback to result in another consolidation and price  continues an upward trajectory afterwards.\n\nShort term targets are wide bodied weekly tops\n\n[SHORT TERM TARGETS](https://preview.redd.it/j8jr71rfsym71.png?width=1680&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fb0ac976e5e520df4c2a2e8b977ae9bdd78bfe54)\n\nRecall from $ATER SHORTS HAVING \"MOTHER BAR\" PROBLEMS that a signal to  either short or long is a break of highs and lows?  Let's consider our  RISK again.  Will $ATER drop -13% to signal those on the sideline to  enter the short?  Maybe.  But will it hold and continue the full -27%?   What MA lies there? 50SMA, which has already been CONFIRMED AS SUPPORT  (BUYERS STEPPED IN LAST TIME).  Thus, the risk/reward leans toward $ATER  BULLS \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ilxt55bjsym71.png?width=1680&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3fac8f1e9749648ad230b89fddb02be2dc9319c7\n\nWhen using lower timeframes, the information becomes less reliable due  to volatility.  This is why CONTINUITY is best determined by the monthly  chart.  Nevertheless, looking closer can give clues about the  underlying action and the 4HR chart shows an UPWARD VOLUME which  indicates ACCUMULATION.  Also, look at the last 4HR candle and notice  the WIDE BODY.  The accumulation + wide range will be difficult for  SHORTS to break the low and signal an attack. \n\n[4HR PRICE ACTION](https://preview.redd.it/bosjcyxlsym71.png?width=1680&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6ce07685c9508fbab3ca72befd46da8acba16749)\n\n Did you miss my post about EMA10+EMA30 CROSS?  +28% IN 2 DAYS!! \n\n[EMA10+EMA30 CROSS](https://preview.redd.it/4gku7fjpsym71.png?width=1680&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6a230b7d5eea27bb13c62018b0fabb892de218d0)\n\n The next crossover I'll be watching is the EMA10+EMA50 \n\n[ EMA10+50 CROSSOVER ON WATCH ](https://preview.redd.it/4h11ld3tsym71.png?width=1680&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=88e01583e04863dfa8ab78b16f6f3ee259e351cf)\n\nAnother potential for price momentum is the POWER OF 3, which is the  convergence of MA's to a single point. There are variations but I stick  to the MA's mentioned above.  The caveat is that this potential has  better odds for a BIG move when price is near the convergent point,  which $ATER is sitting above.  Will continue to watch. \n\n[POWER OF 3](https://preview.redd.it/15w7a66wsym71.png?width=1680&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=148efbef74d25f04cd38dd3491ff825c27e2d84d)\n\nSo, what am I looking for on Monday?   The price is a little extended so a pullback may take place.  I see an  EXPLOSIVE change in character, the 4HR timeframe strong price action,  50SMA has already been confirmed, the volume is at an extreme, and EMA  crossover and POWER of 3 remains on watch.  The risk/reward leans  towards $ATER BULLS.  I think a pullback may happen, and if it does,  buyers will step in.\n\nLast but not  lease, keep a watch for the break of short term targets.  Once broken,  buyers on the sidelines waiting for a signal showing price action is  strong may enter and perpetuate momentum.\n\n[SHORT TERM TARGETS](https://preview.redd.it/87rs1otysym71.png?width=1680&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a160665429c0c7f592306194fe1b6b176beedb95)\n\nI'LL CLOSE WITH A GENERAL ADVISE WHEN  CONSIDERING RISK/REWARD: LOOK FOR CHART PATTERNS THAT MOST PEOPLE CAN  RECOGNIZE EASILY AS THEY HAVE THE BEST PROBABILITY OF A GOOD OUTCOME.   JUST A QUICK GLANCE AT $ATER ONE CAN SEE THE OBVIOUS TREND.\n\nI  HOPE THIS HAS HELPED SOME OF YOU OUT THERE UNDERSTAND THE  TECHNICALITIES IN PRICE ACTION.  YOU CAN APPLY THESE METHODS TO ANY  STOCK YOU ARE INVESTED.\n\nTHANKS FOR READING !",

        "selftext": "I recently started looking into Market Sentiment and got a lot of insights on how the market is behaving\n\nBelow are some of the indicators that I found to be useful. For more details and graphs, [check this blog post.](https://alphapursuits.com/stock-market-sentiment-analysis/)\n\nWould love to hear what tools you use to analyze the market.\n\n1) Smart Money / Dumb Money Confidence\n\nThese data show the correlation between Smart Money (Blue) and Dumb Money (Brown) in regards to the market.\n\nWhen the Dumb Money Confidence is dominating (the red boxes), the market seems to continue on an uptrend overall with some minor sideways move. This could be the time to go big, deploy more capital without worrying about hedging.\n\nWhen the Dumb Money line is crossing over with Smart Money, it\u2019s time to be cautious and it could lead to a large decline (red arrows).\n\nObviously, this is only one of the many data points we need to look at and decide how to trade but this could also be useful at confirming what is going in the market.\n\nFor example, both Dumb and Smart Money lines have crossed each other a couple of times in the last couple of months, which indicates it\u2019s time to be cautious. My declined trading profit in the last couple of months indicates that I am getting assigned more with the Wheel Strategy, in other words, more stocks are declining in price. The Wheel Strategy is a positive Beta strategy so clearly, the market condition is changing despite the fact that SPX continues to climb higher.\n\n\n2) ROBO Put/Call Ratio\n\nROBO stands for\u00a0Retail-Only,\u00a0Buy-to-Open. It looks at transactions that are buy-to-open only for trades that are under 10 contracts of Put and Call options.\n\nIn theory, this ratio focuses on small traders to get a better feel for what they are trying to do. Put is generally used to speculate price decline for small traders so the Put/Call ratio generally goes up when the market is in decline.\n\nThe ROBO Put/Call ratio is right now below 0.5 and the last time it was hovering around this level, was between 2004 \u2013 2008 before the financial crisis (red boxes).\n\nThis doesn\u2019t mean we are going to have another market decline like in 2008 but, it certainly shows how confident the small traders are with the current market.\n\n\u00a0\n3) NYSE Net High-Low %\n\nSimilar to the graph of the % of stocks that are above 50 days Moving Average (MA) described earlier, this data shows the net percentage of NYSE securities trading at a 52-week high minus the percentage trading at a 52-week low (blue line).\n\nWhen there is a divergence between the SPX price and the NYSE Net High-Low ratio (red arrows), a market dip occurred sometime after it (yellow arrows). Obviously, there have been divergences that did not follow with a market dip, but it certainly is one of the signs to watch out for.\n\nI overlayed the Smart Money / Dumb Money Confidence Spread (brown line) and there is a clear correlation that can be seen.\n\n\n4) Sector and Country Sentiment Overview\n\nChina recently started regulating its tech industry BIG TIME. As a result, many of the Chinese stocks started to decline, including non-tech-related ones. Probably not a good time to open any Chinese stock-related positions, or it could also be a great opportunity if you are a contrarian.\n\n\nThe Delta variant COVID-19 is causing yet another surge in infection cases and after moving sideways in May and June, the Health Care sector has started moving up again.\n\nIt\u2019s not always as clear-cut or as easy to explain why the changes in sentiment for certain sectors or countries, but keeping an eye on these data could provide an early warning sign or potential trade opportunities.",

        "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nI would like to share my ongoing DD on high short interest stocks, methodology, and conservative but high ROI plays moving into October. It's exhausting now as everything now is considered a \"short squeeze\" but I would like shed some light on relatively safe plays and reasoning behind it. This methodology will always change based on data presented. The #1 rule in this is that you don't want to chase on plays that are being run. What I do for myself is to get in plays based on data/method that are not running (pre-squeeze), scale into the stock, wait for the catalysts, and then scale out of the stock once it starts running. See below:\n\nMethodology/Criteria:\n\n1) I am looking at high short interest stocks on MarketWatch and HighShortInterestStocks continuously for the top 10 tickers. S3 has good information but I don't pay for the data.\n\n2) Market cap over $1.5M per WSB rules but you can also make smaller cap plays yourself.\n\n3) I look for the following requirements (STRICT) and they must all be present at any given time. \n\na. The first requirement is the stock must be close to a 52 week low or close/below the 200 MA- you can also follow the YTD Change %. You want to make sure you are buying value and not stocks that are down because they are truly terrible companies. \n\nb. The second requirement is the stock must have catalysts in the short term horizon- this allows for anticipation of upside and call option flow. The most % of money I ever made was purchasing stocks/calls in their pre-squeeze stage before they actually squeezed. This way you don't get IV crushed while chasing but as the IV builds, you gain massively on calls. If you are purchasing calls when the IV is at or less than 90% and a catalyst hits that takes the IV &gt;130%, these are massive gains.\n\nc. The third requirement is that the stock float must be shorted &gt;30%. Low float stocks aren't a requirement although they help in certain situations. \n\nd. The 4th requirement are technicals. The one set up I always play is a falling wedge as long as it meets the requirements above. I also love playing cup and handles and bull flags as they are the most consistent. I do not play symmetrical triangles or wedges- I feel as though these are more unpredictable. \n\n4) Scale In with stock/call purchases based on risk/reward ratio. Make sure to SCALE IN. This doesn't mean purchasing all at one time. I usually purchase not in time increments but in % decrease increments (on average -5%) to be safe and purchase 90% stock / 10% calls (&gt;3 months out) to scale in below based on my own risk management. If I want to go riskier/higher reward, I will increase the amount of calls or shorten the call expiration date. But I strongly advise purchasing calls &gt;3 month out exp. \n\ni.e. Day 1: 90% stock / 10% calls (20% of capital) and then repeat when the stock price drops 5%. If the stock price jumps, I don't scale up as many might do. I just move onto another play. Holding CASH is always a position. \n\n5) Once the catalyst hits or there is upside to the stock, I scale out of my positions/gains (not all at one time). Make sure you follow volume - if the volume is strong, you can hold onto your positions much longer to get maximum ROI.\n\n6) Rinse, repeat, and share with others on your plays. \n\nThe stock that I am most interested in right now is $ROOT and I've evaluated the others- please feel free to drop in comments what you would like for me to evaluate. Right now it is the #4 most shorted stock on MarketWatch and HighShortInterestStocks. I will let you know my thoughts on the others in the comments thread and why $ROOT is better vs. others like $SDC. I do look at basic fundamentals to help my game and I do see that $ROOT has $1B in cash while trading at a market cap of $1.5B. They do have a catalyst on the horizon which is their Carvana partnership launch date and other insurance programs (haven't gotten hit by negative news except earnings). Short Interest is at 35%. Technically, they are in a falling wedge with it getting tighter- this is when I like to go riskier on calls as you could see a significant breakout. Let me know your thoughts and I will answer questions that you may have!\n\n[Most Shorted Stocks via MarketWatch](https://preview.redd.it/bmxmix5ty1q71.png?width=1450&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=051f6b44efd8aa841bca637e5cc863ef2a8a4f41)\n\n[High Short Interest Stocks](https://preview.redd.it/99hhitqoy1q71.png?width=1209&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0684db529b4c517dc36a4841cca05798502c10d1)\n\n[Technical based on 9\\/27](https://preview.redd.it/5z69u5e952q71.png?width=1412&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f9fa000a504b83a4a4fc2cdab70f1403d105edfb)",

VCG/VCG via Getty Images)        \n&gt;  \n&gt;In response, skittish  investors have started dumping their stock. Up to $1 trillion has been  wiped off the valuation of Chinese firms since February, after  regulators began targeting electronic payment providers, real estate  developers, private tuition companies (a vast, $120 billion industry in  education-hungry China) and the gaming sector. The latter\u2014a giant and  highly lucrative market generating $44 billion in earnings last year\u2014is  now reeling from new directives banning children from playing more than  three hours of online games a week.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;It\u2019s the  biggest socio-economic change since reformist leader Deng Xiaoping  unleashed market forces in the late 1970s. In words that have since  become infamous, Deng propelled the country\u2019s export-driven resurgence  with the exhortation: \u201cLet some people get rich first.\u201d Many forget that  he went on to say that those allowed to achieve wealth would be  expected to \u201clead other regions and people to gradually achieve common  prosperity.\u201d His successors now look poised to make good on the bargain.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Read more:** [*What the Crackdown on China\u2019s Tech Firms Is Really About*](https://time.com/6079877/china-ipo/)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;A senior CCP official [said last month](https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3146438/chinas-common-prosperity-push-does-not-mean-killing-rich)  that \u201ccommon prosperity\u201d does not mean \u201ckilling the rich to help the  poor.\u201d But rumors are swirling that Beijing may bring in property,  inheritance, and capital gains taxes to level the playing field in a  society where the top 1% now control 31% of wealth, according to Credit  Suisse\u2014up from 21% two decades ago. The preferential 10% tax rate  enjoyed by internet companies is also expected to be rolled back in  favor of the standard 25% corporate rate.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\u201cXi is  saying, \u2018Hey, I found the magic sauce,'\u201d explains Sung Wen-Ti, a  scholar specializing in the CCP leadership at the Australian National  University. \u201c\u2018I\u2019m going to continue to use this socialist market economy  to encourage economic growth, while redistributing wealth in a way that  doesn\u2019t lead us back to the Mao Zedong days of poverty.\u2019\u201d   \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \ud83d\udcf7  Chinese tourists crowd as they leave the exit of the Forbidden City on October 6, 2020 in Beijing, China. Kevin Frayer/Getty Images        \n&gt;  \n&gt;The meaning of common prosperity  \n&gt;  \n&gt;In July, [to mark the CCP\u2019s centenary](https://time.com/6077358/china-communist-party-centenary-xi-jinping/),  Xi announced that the goal of building \u201ca moderately prosperous society  in all respects\u201d was complete, having already declared [absolute poverty eradicated](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-56194622#:~:text=Chinese%20President%20Xi%20Jinping%20says,been%20lifted%20out%20of%20poverty.).  By 2049, the centenary of the People\u2019s Republic, the goal is to \u201cbuild a  modern socialist country that is prosperous, strong, democratic,  culturally advanced and harmonious.\u201d  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Of course,  \u201cdemocratic\u201d means different things in China than it does in the West,  but there\u2019s no doubt that the goal of a \u201csocialist country\u201d is more  important to Xi than it was to his immediate predecessors. So far,  celebrities who flaunt their wealth and welch on taxes have found  themselves abruptly taken off the Chinese internet. Officials have also [announced](https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1008371/beijings-top-teachers-will-rotate-shifts-across-schools)  the ramping up of a scheme to rotate the best teachers among different  schools in order to equalize education standards. Ride-hailing firm Didi  and e-commerce platform JD.com have meanwhile moved to establish trade  unions for their staff, who until now have typically been employed  casually via third-party contractors, receiving paltry benefits. But the  central government has offered little specific guidance as to what  socialism and common prosperity mean in practice.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;The  vagueness mirrors an anti-corruption drive started by Xi in 2012.  Instead of new laws and regulations to ensure transparency and  accountability, that purge instead borrowed from the ancient Chinese  tactic of \u201ckill a chicken to scare the monkeys,\u201d says Moser\u2014making an  example of [1.5 million officials](https://www.efe.com/efe/english/world/china-punishes-more-than-1-5-million-officials-for-corruption/50000262-3412841), a comparatively small number, to send a clear message to all 90 million apparatchiks that graft was no longer tolerated.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;This  is the context in which China\u2019s wealthiest have been left to interpret  the implications of common prosperity for themselves. Unsurprisingly,  they have been throwing money at the problem, pouring billions into  charitable foundations as a gesture of appeasement.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \ud83d\udcf7  A  woman walks past a sign celebrating the centenary of the Communist  Party of China, with the CCTV headquarters seen in the background, on  June 28, 2021 in the central business district of Beijing.

That came on top of an earlier pledge of 100  billion renminbi from Tencent, and 10 billion renminbi from bosses at  each of Pinduoduo, Xiaomi and Meituan, for various social projects.  Alibaba had already been in the spotlight after regulators fined the  firm $2.8 billion and nixed the $37 billion IPO of its fintech arm, Ant  Group, which was subsequently ordered to restructure. Notably, the  firm\u2014along with several of China\u2019s most profitable corporations\u2014is based  in Zhejiang province, chosen as \u201ca demonstration zone for achieving  common prosperity,\u201d [according](http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2021-06/10/c_1310001320.htm) to the official Xinhua news agency.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Read more:** [*How China\u2019s Digital Currency Could Challenge the Dollar*](https://time.com/6084146/china-digital-rmb-currency/)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\u201cXi  doesn\u2019t want to be seen as someone who\u2019s in league with these giant  tech companies and billionaires, so he\u2019s cracking down on them,\u201d says  Moser. \u201cIt\u2019s a populist move so ordinary people feel the CCP is on their  side.\u201d   \n&gt;  \n&gt;Reading the political winds, many of  China\u2019s most famous tycoons have quietly stepped back from boardroom  positions in recent weeks to take roles with a social focus.

        "selftext": "In between manipulating the stock market through his Twitter feed and snorting Provigil through a paper straw, Elon MusK has been building out his manufacturing capacity in China to service EM EV demand. China in and of itself isn\u2019t a driver of Tesla\u2019s profits. In August they made only 8,621 deliveries to Chinese customers.( https://www.investopedia.com/tesla-tsla-turns-on-the-charm-in-china-5203303 ). It seems like conspicuous signs of wealth are losing popularity in China. Wonder why? Ask Jack Ma.\n\nConsidering Tesla\u2019s facing supply chain disruptions in China due to coal shortages (LOL) the honeymoon phase for Elon Musk and Xi Jinping may be over. His investment in China wasn\u2019t just financial. They actually cut a tourism commercial for Xinjiang ( https://mobile.twitter.com/teslacn/status/1406277513517494272?lang=en ). See no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil. Cost of doing business in China. \n\nBut what options does Tesla have? What other country has the rare earth minerals, the space, and Elon has a serious fetish for solar panels so through in lots of sunshine as well. Only one country country fits the bill. That being Australia (  https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/apr/17/the-race-for-rare-earth-minerals-can-australia-fuel-the-electric-vehicle-revolution ). Sure they don\u2019t have as big a population, but these factories are highly automated anyway.\n\nSo Australia is perfectly situated to ascend into EV dominance, except for one crucial ingredient. That being a functioning society. Elon hates covid restrictions, threatening to pull out of their Fremont California plant all together if exemption were not made ( https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/20/tesla-gets-exemption-from-new-california-covid-19-health-orders.html ). I have a sneaking suspicion that if Australia ever got it\u2019s shit together, a Tesla Gigafactory would spontaneously emerge in Melbourne from the machine elf dimension. But for now Elon\u2019s stuck in China, sucking Xi\u2019s dick, plotting his escape.",

So there was no recap yesterday, got mixed up and didn't have the time*\n\nStocks fell today, extending the previous day\u2019s decline in the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Dow Jones (DIA) as market participants continue to digest the recent August Job Report and concerns surrounding rising coronavirus infections across the US. The tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) 0.33% down while the SPY and DIA fell 0.11% and 0.2% respectively. The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, fell 1.10%.\n\nYung-Yu Ma. Chief Investment Strategist at BMO Capital said, \u201cWe think the fundamental drivers of strong earnings, an accommodative Fed, and a still healthy appetite for risk taking are really what\u2019s going to support the market for the rest of the year.\u201d \n\nThe Labor Department released their monthly unemployment report, which showed hiring in August slow down dramatically as the US continues to battle massive spikes in coronavirus Delta cases in certain parts of the country, mainly the South/Southeast (according to the CDC, roughly \u2153 of all COVID-related hospitalizations are in Texas and Florida as both states deal with record coronavirus cases and low hospital capacity). Due to this surge and the reimposition of pandemic-era restrictions in areas with high transmission rates, employment numbers came in shockingly low compared to estimates and the previous month\u2019s numbers. Here are the numbers.\n\n* **Change in non-farm payrolls:** \\+235,000 vs. +733,000 expected and a revised +1.053 million in July\n* **Unemployment rate, August:** 5.2% vs. 5.2% expected and 5.4% in July\n* **Average hourly earnings, month-over-month:** 0.6% vs. 0.3% expected and 0.4% in July \n* **Average hourly earnings, year-over-year:** 4.3% vs. 3.9% expected and 4.0% in July\n\nPresident Biden said of the report, \u201cWhile I know some wanted to see a larger number today and so did I, what we\u2019ve seen this year is continued growth, month after month, in job creation. This is the kind of growth that makes our economy stronger.\u201d\n\nMembers of the Fed have consistently signaled they will be looking especially closely at labor market data to determine when to start tapering the pandemic-era quantitative easing program. Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said the August Jobs Report could be his signal to hit the \u201csubstantial further progress mark\u201d the Fed stipulated in December and begin tapering. He said, \u201cI think that one more good job report if it\u2019s in the 850,000 to 1 million range will be sufficient to claim substantial further progress in employment for tapering.\u201d August was not the report they were looking for. \n\nIn its latest Beige Book, which is basically a report by the Federal Reserve on current economic conditions, members said the economy downshifted slightly due to Delta variant concerns. The report stated, \u201cThe deceleration in economic activity was largely attributable to a pullback in dining out, travel, and tourism in most Districts, reflecting safety concerns due to the rise of the Delta variant, and, in many cases, international travel restrictions.\u201d \n\nIn the US, the surge in infections in certain parts of the nation continues unabated, with hospitalizations this weekend roughly 300% higher than Labor Day weekend in 2020, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. The surge in patients comes as the highly contagious Delta variant continues to spread across the US, and coincided with a weekend that saw a spike in travel. According to the Transportation Security Administration, more than 3.5 million people travelled across the country on Friday and Saturday for the Labor Day holiday, despite the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s recommendation for unvaccinated people to refrain from traveling. \n\n[https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/sep/07/us-covid-patients-hospitals-surge](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/sep/07/us-covid-patients-hospitals-surge)\n\n[https://www.kq2.com/content/news/Health-officials-urge-caution-as-students-return-to-class-after-long-holiday-weekend--575252751.html](https://www.kq2.com/content/news/Health-officials-urge-caution-as-students-return-to-class-after-long-holiday-weekend--575252751.html)\n\nIn other news, the battle between Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos is heating up! Last week, SpaceX sent a filing to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) accusing Amazon of using regulatory and legal means to stifle and slowdown competition. SpaceX said, \u201cWhile SpaceX has proceeded to deploy more than 1,700 satellites, Amazon has yet to even attempt to address the radiofrequency interference and orbital debris issues that must be resolved before Amazon can deploy its constellation\u201d and suggested \u201cas it falls behind competitors \\[Amazon\\] is more than willing to use regulatory and legal processes to create obstacles designed to delay those competitors from leaving Amazon even further behind\u201d (ouch).\n\nIn response, Amazon said, Whether it is launching satellites with unlicensed antennas, launching rockets without approval, building an unapproved launch tower, or re-opening a factory in violation of a shelter-in-place order, the conduct of SpaceX and other Musk-led companies makes their view plain: rules are for other people, and those who insist upon or even simply request compliance are deserving of derision and ad hominem attacks. If the FCC regulated hypocrisy, SpaceX would keep the commission very busy.\u201d SpaceX won this one IMO, that was a nasty burn. \n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Job openings in July as measured by JOLTS soared by a staggering 749,000 \u2014 hitting yet another all-time high just shy of 11 million open jobs, enough to eliminate most of the current slack in the labor market.\n* El Salvador became the first country in the world to roll out a digital currency as a form of legal tender, allowing businesses and customers to transact using blockchain. There are some initial teething problems with the launch of the Chivo, the country\u2019s wallet app and locals being unfamiliar with the technology. Digital currencies also fell, though I don\u2019t know unknown if the drop is correlated to the launch in El Salvador\n* Damn, the buy-now-pay-later (BNPL) market is red-hot right now. Following Sqaure\u2019s (SQ) acquisition of Afterpay for $29 billion and Amazon (AMZN) partnering up with Affirm (AFRM) to offer BNPL on Amazon, PayPal (PYPL) is now stepping into the arena by acquiring Japanese BNPL firm Paidy for $2.7 billion\n* Twitter (TWTR) launched a global test of a tool it calls Communities, a feature similar to Facebook Groups that gives users a way to tweet to people with similar interests. This follows the recent launch of Super Follows, where content creators can charge their followers for their content. \n* Applied Materials (AMAT) announced it was releasing two new tools aimed at improving efficiency of making a new class of chips for electric vehicles. The machines announced on Wednesday are designed for chips made from a material called silicon carbide. Such chips are gaining traction in electric vehicles like those made by Tesla Inc because they are more efficient and lighter in weight than standard silicon chips for transmitting power from a car's battery to its motors, helping improve range. Silicon carbide chips are difficult to manufacture because the material is very hard\n* **\\*\\*Please note that current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect closing prices\\*\\***\n* ASML target raised by Wells Fargo (WFC) from $800 to$975 at Overweight.

        "selftext": "# A business-model:\n\nNetflix\u2019s vision relies on two conditions: expand the user base as quickly as possible to gain a strong position in the market; to fulfill the first condition you must create your own content. As we will see under, this strategy is still in place, however, we are at an inflection point. Netflix will either continue its meteoric growth or settle and progressively disappear. There will be no in-between.\n\n**Subscriber Growth Drives Netflix Story**\n\nOver the last several years, Netflix was focused on growing its subscriber base. In this sense, it has been investing heavily in local-language original content production worldwide. The addition of net subscribers dictates Netflix stock performance.\n\nNetflix ended the second quarter with 209.18 million subscribers worldwide. The U.S. and Canada accounted for 35.4% of the total subscriber base. The rest is spread across the globe.\n\nStay-at-home orders during the Covid-19 pandemic drove business for Netflix and other home entertainment services. Consumers watched more television because movie theaters, live music, and sports were shut down during the pandemic. However, the reopening of the economy hurts Netflix. It faces difficulties in comparison to last year. Subscribers keep increasing but at a slower rate.\n\n**Netflix: product analysis**\n\nNow for a while, Netflix has been producing its own series. This choice limits the costs of purchasing series from other producers and ensures exclusive content for subscribers. Netflix has been rather successful with hits as: \"Money Heist,\" \"Orange Is the New Black,\" \"Stranger Things,\" \"The Umbrella Academy\" and \"The Witcher.\"\n\nAnd this successful trend is increasing as recent shows on Netflix have been buzzworthy including: \"Bridgerton,\" \"Ginny &amp; Georgia\" and \"Sweet Tooth.\" Popular new original movies include \"Fatherhood,\" \"Army of the Dead\" and \"Gunpowder Milkshake.\"\n\nCreating its own content is a great initiative. A survey by investment bank Cowen showed that Netflix's growing library is the top driver of new customers. Managers\u2019 perception of reality and the wishes of customers seem aligned.\n\n**Netflix Dominates 2021 Awards Season**\n\nThese series are not only commercially successful but also cinematographically successful. This year, Netflix has been awarded numerous prizes.\n\nOn July 13, Netflix received 129 nominations for Emmy Awards from the Television Academy. It was close to second to WarnerMedia's HBO and HBO Max, which garnered 130 nominations. The most-honored Netflix shows included \"The Crown,\" \"The Queen's Gambit\" and \"Bridgerton.\"\n\nNetflix won the most awards of any studio at the 93rd Academy Awards on April 25. It picked up seven Oscars, but it came up empty in the best picture and acting categories. Netflix headed into the ceremony with 36 nominations, far more than any other studio.\n\nNetflix also garnered the most awards of any studio or network at the 26th annual Critics Choice Awards on March 7. It won 14 awards for productions such as \"The Crown,\" \"The Queen's Gambit\" and \"Ma Rainey's Black Bottom.\"\n\nAt this year's Producers Guild Awards on March 24, Netflix won awards for episodic TV drama (\"The Crown\"), limited series (\"The Queen's Gambit\"), and documentary film (\"My Octopus Teacher\").\n\nNetflix took the top prize at the 27th Screen Actors Guild Awards on April 4 for its movie \"The Trial of the Chicago 7.\" It also won awards for TV shows \"The Queen's Gambit,\" \"Ozark\" and \"The Crown.\" Netflix took home seven awards at this year's SAG Awards.\n\n# Fundamentals\n\nHere are few fundamentals (because the amount of cash the company owns still matters).\n\n**Balance sheet**\n\nCurrent assets or well above current liabilities which means that the company can pay all its short-term debt with the cash on hand.\n\nMoreover, one can see that equity is high and increased a lot in the past 6 months (by more than 25%). This is great news for shareholders as it means that Netflix has cash for future investments, or it will return it to investors.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Q2 2021 earnings: letter to shareholders](https://preview.redd.it/6ofbmi1iwln71.png?width=632&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=24a4b772ddbf2e31c898e7df664bece22d7683cf)\n\n**Statement of Profit and Loss**\n\nWe can observe a slight increase in revenue compared to last quarter however it does not transfer in higher net income as marketing expenses increased and interest and other income sharply dropped. We can wonder if the increase in marketing expenses was useful as they increased it by 12% when led to an increase in revenue (if there is a causal link) of 2,5%. Then lower revenue from interest (loss) also led to a decrease in net income compared to the previous quarter.\n\nOn a broader scale, results are good compared to the same quarter one year ago. This is mostly due to a proportionally smaller increase in the cost of revenue compared to the increase in revenue itself. However, it must be noted that also compared to this period, the increase in marketing expense did not lead to a proportionally increase in revenue. In the long run, this might be annoying as it means that customers do not react to Netflix\u2019s marketing. It reduces Netflix's possibility to increase revenue and then profit through marketing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Q2 2021 earnings: letter to shareholders](https://preview.redd.it/ztimbp1mwln71.png?width=605&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0babc82d94adc2625ebe749c2cc59df56baada30)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Growing competition:\n\nMeanwhile, Netflix is facing new competition from traditional media companies. **AT&amp;T** (T)-through WarnerMedia launched HBO Max in May 2020. **Comcast** (CMCSA)-owned NBCUniversal followed in July 2020 with Peacock. **Discovery** (DISCA) debuted its Discovery+service on Jan. 4. **ViacomCBS** (VIAC) launched Paramount+ on March 4.\n\nOther services include **Amazon** (AMZN) Prime Video, **Apple**'s (AAPL) Apple TV+, **Walt Disney**'s (DIS) Disney+, Hulu, and more.\n\nIncreasing competition is starting to take on Netflix\u2019s market share.  Relative to competitors Netflix\u2019 shows are getting less popular:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/09hfhkepwln71.png?width=605&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cbc26fe88e6ccf6110824407dc5f7762faf01035\n\nThe situation could get even more complicated for Netflix. Indeed, knowing that customers have on average 5 streaming services ( *Despite Return to \u2018Normal,\u2019 People are Spending More Time and Money on Streaming Services Now than During Height of Pandemic,* TMT Insight Briefing Report, 2021), if we subtract one music subscription, we are left with 4 subscriptions. Customers will likely have a Disney and Prime subscription due to the variety of their catalog and the \u201cmust\u201d they contain. Amazon\u2019s recent move to buy MGM and with Disney still releasing blockbusters, it seems unlikely that customers will avoid these two services.  Then, currently, it makes sense to add Netflix among the two streaming services left.\n\nHowever, such a high number of subscriptions is unlikely to persist over time, people will likely tend back to their pre-pandemic habits.  Moreover, in the above reasoning, I did not consider Apple. With its massive resources, it could increase its budget in order to attract more customers. Companies like AT&amp;T and Comcast still have deep pockets and if they judge it useful to invest in streaming, they will have resources that Netflix does not have. Of course, currently, Netflix offers the best product as shown by this poll ( *Assessing Video Trends in US, UK, Germany, and Japan;* John Blackledge, James Kopelman, William Kerr and Max Spaeth; 2021). They have certain knowledge and unique know-how and brand. However, quality can be purchased by hiring good employees and the previously mentioned companies have the capabilities to hire such people.\n\n# Questionable management decisions:\n\nOn Oct. 29 of 2020, Netflix increased its price by 1 USD for the standard and premium tiers of its subscription video-on-demand service in the U.S. Even if Netflix stock jumped on the news. This decision is questionable. Indeed, Netflix is already one of the most expensive services compared to competitors. Prime is at $8,99 per month and Disney Plus is at $7,99. Other competitors are usually a bit cheaper than Netflix. It also means that now Netflix has fewer possibilities to increase profit. We have seen that competition is increasing, which means that it will be more complicated to draw new customers. At the same time, rising prices will get even more complicated.\n\nManagement should also reconsider its marketing as the analysis above in the \u201cfundamentals\u201d part shows that it is inefficient at increasing revenue. This is concerning.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TLDR:** Netflix is still a top-of-the-art streaming service. Recent awards show that series from Netflix are the best. However, competition is ramping up with Amazon who bought MGM, and Disney still releasing blockbusters. Deep-pocket companies like Apple and AT&amp;T could be future challengers. Moreover, Netflix seems to have already used its ability to increase earnings through a price increase as their service is the most expensive compared to pairs. Polls showed that the competition is getting market share even if the number of subscribers keeps increasing for Netflix. In conclusion, I do not expect Netflix to decrease but I do not see numerous future catalysts which could push the stock higher.\n\nPS: As my text present it, I am not a shareholder of Netflix. I have been in the past, but this is over for the reasons mentionned above.",

        "selftext": "Hopefully, you've studied enough from  the prior article to follow.  We'll begin, however, with the basics in  understanding candles and volume.  Think of candles as a fight between  SHORTS and BUYERS, and the ending point (CLOSING RANGE=CR) shows who is  in control.  A CR 40% or more is considered good support by buyers.   Volume tells us the strength in a move.  For example, if there was an  increase +20% but BELOW average volume, the move is not supported and a  drop/correction is expected.\n\nCONTINUITY  is the trend direction.  This is found by looking at longer timeframes,  which I use the monthly.  If the CR is lower than the prior bar, then  expect a downtrend and vice versa.  Look at volume to see if there is  strength supporting the move.\n\n$ATER  monthly shows a candle above the prior month, CR 80.95% and above  average volume.  We can clearly see that $ATER is in an uptrend.  ALSO,  KEEP IN MIND THAT THIS IS ONLY 1 WEEK IN SEPT AND VOLUME HAS ALREADY  SURPASSED AUG. THIS IS AN EXPLOSIVE CHANGE IN CHARACTER !!\n\n[ CR = \\(CLOSE-LOW\\) \\/ \\(HIGH \\/ LOW\\)  ](https://preview.redd.it/v9uwyojz4ym71.png?width=1680&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=47c0fbc83935bc734ca506a9c2e88f0c5b28ce67)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[WEEKLY CR + VOLUME](https://preview.redd.it/bee1k7f25ym71.png?width=1680&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5107d537979df867124b3c1d388f95de8327ed4c)\n\nA consolidation can be detected by looking at price action where price  remains within a level while the volume dries up.  Volume dries up as  the number of SELLERS decrease and price remains within a level as  BUYERS supported the price.  $ATER consolidated after a big move in a  clear pennant formation before a HUGE inflow of buyers. \n\n[CONSOLIDATION](https://preview.redd.it/sj72qyic5ym71.png?width=1680&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=06198aca0ba9de2f483a6d3d2fe492d1f7892259)\n\nYou should already be familiar with MOTHER BARS and price action breaking the highs and lows of these bars: \n\n[MOTHER BARS](https://preview.redd.it/bfn19tll5ym71.png?width=1680&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bc102791694da358d532bb3de2028c7f76de7177)\n\nA stock below the 50 day simple  moving average (SMA) is generally considered a \"sick\" stock.  $ATER is  above the 50SMA. The MA's I use (other traders may differ) are EMA10  (green), EMA21 (yellow), SMA50 (red).\n\nNOTICE THAT 1ST BAR BREAKS 50SMA, 2ND CONFIRMS 50SMA BY REBOUND, AND 3RD IS BREAKOUT.  $ATER IS ALIVE AND HEALTHY !!\n\n[ BREAK AND CONFIRMATION OF 50SMA ](https://preview.redd.it/hgfr9ibs5ym71.png?width=1680&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b3402ed60dbe4125614428a8f2ed541c0451c59b)\n\nLet's star off by looking at risk.  I'm worried that price may be a  little extend and a pullback occurs.  How so?  Well, $ATER broke out of  consolidation and short term resistance and ran above the MA's.  Fridays  closing range was 51%, which means that sellers were active (possibly  from those who bought in the 3's).  However, remember that a CR 40% or  more is supportive.  Bullish indicators to consider is an UPTREND  continuity, ABNORMALLY HIGH VOLUME, and a recent EXPLOSIVE CHANGE IN  CHARACTER, and 50SMA CONFIRMATION AS SUPPORT. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vakvm10y5ym71.png?width=1680&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cf2c8e8c26bdbb4947636763af304e191f4d0eab\n\nSo, am I worried about a pullback?   Obviously, no.  Why?  $ATER is a YOUNG BULL and volume has been EXTREME.   I expect a pullback to result in another consolidation and price  continues an upward trajectory afterwards.\n\nShort term targets are wide bodied weekly tops.\n\n[SHORT TERM TARGETS](https://preview.redd.it/8ppizcu16ym71.png?width=1680&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=72c9349ade4991720271d2d7e730b8a99c7974bc)\n\nRecall from $ATER SHORTS HAVING \"MOTHER BAR\" PROBLEMS that a signal to  either short or long is a break of highs and lows?  Let's consider our  RISK again.  Will $ATER drop -13% to signal those on the sideline to  enter the short?  Maybe.  But will it hold and continue the full -27%?   What MA lies there? 50SMA, which has already been CONFIRMED AS SUPPORT  (BUYERS STEPPED IN LAST TIME).  Thus, the risk/reward leans toward $ATER  BULLS \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wvbegt066ym71.png?width=1680&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=265e38e19e34d27acb6ee7d98283bd239109ca00\n\nWhen using lower timeframes, the information becomes less reliable due  to volatility.  This is why CONTINUITY is best determined by the monthly  chart.  Nevertheless, looking closer can give clues about the  underlying action and the 4HR chart shows an UPWARD VOLUME which  indicates ACCUMULATION.  Also, look at the last 4HR candle and notice  the WIDE BODY.  The accumulation + wide range will be difficult for  SHORTS to break the low and signal an attack. \n\n[4HR PRICE ACTION](https://preview.redd.it/kp09wnt86ym71.png?width=1680&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ffe94d2c03c4eba5cd93a0bf66c4644835e89fae)\n\n Did you miss my post about EMA10+EMA30 CROSS?  +28% IN 2 DAYS!! \n\n[ EMA10+EM30 CROSS ](https://preview.redd.it/lqcinsmd6ym71.png?width=1680&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0d67a81beed88bcf11631a8cac23e2add1b23b0c)\n\n The next crossover I'll be watching is the EMA10+EMA50 \n\n[ EMA10+50 CROSSOVER ON WATCH ](https://preview.redd.it/7e1jurkg6ym71.png?width=1680&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c5a16c4ce442132ccabbd83a4f373ffd375a748d)\n\nAnother potential for price momentum is the POWER OF 3, which is the  convergence of MA's to a single point. There are variations but I stick  to the MA's mentioned above.  The caveat is that this potential has  better odds for a BIG move when price is near the convergent point,  which $ATER is sitting above.  Will continue to watch. \n\n[POWER OF 3](https://preview.redd.it/yahcq74k6ym71.png?width=1680&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dfa6fed801568c71dedbd007d806d3bff8538521)\n\nSo, what am I looking for on Monday?   The price is a little extended so a pullback may take place.  I see an  EXPLOSIVE change in character, the 4HR timeframe strong price action,  50SMA has already been confirmed, the volume is at an extreme, and EMA  crossover and POWER of 3 remains on watch.  The risk/reward leans  towards $ATER BULLS.  I think a pullback may happen, and if it does,  buyers will step in.\n\nI HOPE THIS  HAS HELPED SOME OF YOU OUT THERE UNDERSTAND THE TECHNICALITIES IN PRICE  ACTION.

        "selftext": " The Case For SelectQuote ($SLQT)\n\nHeavy insider buying and big growth potential make this already under-valued stock look even more attractive.\n\n**Company Overview**\n\n**Website**: https://www.selectquote.com/\n\n**Market cap at publishing**: $2.3B\n\n**Price at publishing**: $13.80\n\n**Price Target**: $20.96 (52% upside)\n\n**CEO**: Tim Danker\n\n**Headquarters**: Overland Park, KS\n\n**Founded**: 1985\n\n**Employees**: 3,300\n\n**Company Overview**\n\nSelectQuote, Inc. operates a technology-enabled, direct-to-consumer distribution platform that sells a range of insurance policies to consumers from various insurance carriers in the United States. The company operates through three segments: Senior; Life; and Auto &amp; Home. It distributes senior health policies, such as medicare advantage, medicare supplement, medicare part D, and other ancillary senior health insurance-related policies, including prescription drugs, dental, vision, and hearing plans; term life policies; and non-commercial auto and home property, and casualty policies. The company was incorporated in 1999 and is headquartered in Overland Park, Kansas.\n\nThe first thing I like about SelectQuote is they have a simple and easy-to-understand business, they are insurance brokers. They are not an insurer and therefore are protected from any risks associated with underwriting. SelectQuote just sells insurance on behalf of insurers primarily via their website and collects commissions. Commissions are earned once the plan is activated and again for subsequent renewals, they also receive performance bonuses from many of their insurance partners when hitting certain quotas. Currently their lifetime value of commissions or \u201cLTV\u201d which represents commissions estimated to be collected over the estimated life of an approved policy for their two biggest segments, Medicare Advantage and Medicare Supplement stands at $1,260 and $1,269 respectively. SelectQuote estimates that their market share is less than 2.5% in each of the three segments they operate, allowing for plenty of room to grow.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n**Financials**\n\nSelectQuote\u2019s income statement for the year ended June 30, 2021 looks like this:\n\n https://imgur.com/uXGvNHY \n\nBetween 2018 and 2021 CAGR for revenue is an impressive 59% with a 76% increase in revenue over 2020. EBITDA and net income are also up over 40%, all very positive signs of a growing company.\u00a0\n\nHere is a breakdown of where that $938M in revenue came from in 2021:\n\n https://imgur.com/iZh5w4i \n\n$729M or 77% came from their senior segment which is basically medicare insurance plans. The fact that they are focusing so much on Medicare is significant because that is where most of the future growth will come from as we\u2019ll see in the sections to come.\n\nSome YoY comparisons I like to make:\n\n https://imgur.com/sEdCCfH \n\nThe 80% decrease in FCF is primarily due to the adjustment of $333M in commissions receivable to the net income when calculating operating cash flow but this should positively affect their future FCF as those pending commissions are converted to cash.\n\n**Insider Buying**\n\nThis is actually how SelectQuote first hit my radar, I saw large amounts of insider purchases and I decided to dig a little deeper into the company.\n\n https://imgur.com/Ap2cRUu \n\nAs you can see, there have been 13 flat-out purchases by the CEO, CFO, COO, and directors in prices ranging from $8.75 all the way up to $13.28 on September 13th, 2021 in addition to eight option exercises. The total value of all purchases comes out to more than $8M. The most notable purchases are the Senior President dropping $2M, the CEO dropping $1M, and the COO dropping $2M, all in Aug 21\u2019when the price was near $9. As an investor, you obviously love to see this. No one knows the company better than these guys and they seem to know that the stock has plenty of upside if they are willing to splashdown that much of their own cash.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n**Analyst Consensus**\n\nDon\u2019t just take it from me, here are the views of \u201cprofessional\u201d analysts. There are 7 analysts covering SelectQuote who have an average PT of $17.93, with a low of $13 and a high of $25. The targets are very much in line with my own PT of $20.96.\u00a0\n\n https://imgur.com/coecapG \n\n### Outlook\n\n**Growth Potential**\n\nSo what does the future hold for SelectQuote? Growth, and lots of it. Growth will come in the way of a larger TAM and a more aggressive push to activate more policies. There are several ways for seniors to sign up for Medicare. The first is to sign up for the \u201ctraditional\u201d government-issued insurance and the other is to sign up for a private market solution, which is basically Medicare offered through an insurance company, this is called Medicare Advantage. Medicare Advantage is SelectQuote\u2019s biggest segment and accounted for 77% of their revenues in 2021. Why is it so important for SelectQuote to focus on Medicare Advantage? Well, the market is growing quickly and so will their share of it. The market is growing thanks to favorable demographic trends that will see more baby boomers reaching 65 years of age. In 2020, the percentage of the population reaching 65 was 15.6%, that\u2019s up from 12.9% in 2010. On average, 10,000 baby boomers are expected to turn 65 every day, or nearly 4 million per year for the next 10 years. Not only will there be more people eligible for Medicare but our grandmas and grandpas are now internet-savvy technophiles. Internet usage among older generations has increased from 40% in 2019 to 75% in 2021,\u00a0 meaning more online shopping that includes everything from diapers to insurance.\u00a0\n\nThere were roughly 60M Medicare policies in 2019, 27M were through Medicare Advantage, representing 38% of the market. Of the 27M Medicare Advantage plans, SelectQuote only accounts for .55M or 2%. According to analysts, the Medicare Advantage market alone is expected to swell to 37M by 2025. If they can reach just 4% of the market by that point, they\u2019ll have roughly 1.5M policies which, if they can maintain their LVT of $1,260/policy will total \\~1.9B in Medicare Advantage revenue alone. I believe they can do even better than 4% because of their improving online targeting and aggressive hiring of agents. As of June 30, 2021, SelectQuote employed a total of 1,356 core agents and hired an additional 3,000 flex employees during the Annual Enrollment Period which is a long way of saying busy season in the insurance industry. In comparison to 2020 when they had 1,000 core agents and 1,400 flex agents, an increase of 36% and 114% respectively. They are also ramping up their marketing by spending $385M in 2021 vs $185M in 2020, a 108% increase.\n\n**Acquisitions**\n\nIn April 21\u2019 SelectQuote launched an online platform called Population Health which is designed to \u201cprovide awareness and education for seniors to ensure the full utilization of their health benefits\u201d. The website is designed to ultimately make contact with MA patients and understand their needs to get them the best care for them. In doing so, they are able to connect these patients with one of their primary care providers (generating commissions) or provide a service of their own. In order to facilitate the growth of Population Health, SelectQuote created SelectQuote Ventures Inc \u201cSVI\u201d to identify potential partnerships and potential acquisitions. So far they have acquired InsideResponse, an online marketing consulting firm for $65M, Lead Distribution Company, which does what its name suggests for $33.5M, and Express Med Pharmaceuticals or SelectRx for $24M.\u00a0\n\nhttps://imgur.com/ULNVlKV \n\n SelectRx is an interesting pharmaceutical distributor which handles everything there is to handle regarding medications. After gathering information through a consultation, they automatically refill and package medications in easy-to-read and understand packaging and mail it out to their subscribers. SelectRx should provide a healthy ROI, especially when used in conjunction with Population Health. SelectRx is expected to generate $120M in revenue in FY2023 with EBITDA around $20M, not bad for a $24M investment. Both platforms are already performing well as the data below shows. \n\n https://imgur.com/Qs9pQXL  \n\n**Conclusion**\n\nToday I told the story of a company with a simple and solid business that is at the pinnacle of expertise due to its long exposure to the insurance brokerage business. Although they have been around for a while, they are just starting to hit their stride with the large influx of cash from their IPO ($350M) when they were priced at $20/share. A company that is operating in a market that is undoubtedly growing along with an aging population and who is aggressively seeking to increase their share of said market. They are off to a great start by growing their senior revenue by 101% between 2020 and 2021. They are not just resting on their laurels and focusing on senior revenue but creating a new platform (Population Health) and making acquisitions like SelectRx to expand their offerings.\n\nProbably the most telling point I touched on in this article is the insider buying. SelectQuote\u2019s management at all levels is so convinced of the future of their company that they are willing to splash down large bundles of their own cash all the way up to $13.34/share and I\u2019m not sure they are done yet, I would look for more insider buying in the months to come. If they are so assured of the company\u2019s future why the hell wouldn\u2019t I be?\u00a0\u00a0\n\n**Valuation**\n\nI use a simplified discounted cash flow analysis based on Aswath Damodaran\u2019s teachings at NYU which uses assumptions about future cash flows that are discounted to today\u2019s dollars in order to reach a present valuation. I used the company\u2019s own financial forecasts to guide me up to the year 2022. The discount rate of 6.67% is based on their WACC which was calculated using the assumptions seen below in the \u201cWACC\u201d section. I used 1.2% as the terminal growth rate for the purpose of being conservative. The current value per share I get is $20.96 representing an upside of 53%.\n\n https://imgur.com/uCPMzl1  \n\n**Price Target**\n\nI have a price target of **$20.96** for SelectQuote.\n\n**TL;DR:** Grandparents are getting older and know how to use computer, will use computer to buy Medicare through SelectQuote, stock price go up.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n**My position**\n\nI have not initiated a position in any companies mentioned in this article, however,\n\nI may purchase shares within the next 72 hours.\n\n**Disclaimer**\n\nThe contents on this site/article are for informational and entertainment purposes only and does not constitute financial, accounting, or legal advice.

        "selftext": "Disclosure: I'm long MA since 2006 or so and have done well but don't want to be complacent.\n\nI have regularly bought the dip with MA - especially in December 2018 and again during the COVID crash of March 2020.\n\nThe difference to me now is that in both of those cases, the dip was a reflection of the broader market correcting heavily. Since the latest MA earnings, it has been on a straight downward trend while the market generally is holding its own.\n\nSo I'm wondering - is weakness in the face of market strength a reason to reconsider this long term investment? What has fundamentally changed about its business prospects? The bull side is that the world is still largely cash-based so plenty of room to grow for years.\n\nWhat of threats? Is this fear of buy now pay later? Lingering covid impact and depressed cross border volume? Fear that governments might create V/MA alternatives like India's UPI? Cryp-to? Perhaps a belief that just too much growth is already priced in?\n\nWould welcome thoughts from those who follow this space.",

No possible way MGM lets Entain be aquired as although it will not affect its US operations, it still affords the possibility of DKNG expanding its global footprint.

        "selftext": " \n\nFirst things first, Consumer price  index data finally came slightly lower then expected 5.3 vs the 5.4 , honestly the nail on the coffin for the inflation scare will be with Octobers consumer price index data , if it shows a staling in inflation or even some deflation in some items , the transitory theory that jpow has been talking about for the past few months will be proven true. Furthermore , a lot of the inflation is due to supply chains issues aka transitory aka this shit isnt forever . Honestly by 2023 i think supply chains should be solved ... hopefully maybe not all but a good portion.\n\nThe delta strain , caused a little bit of a fuck up which the market priced in relatively quick, if Im being honest , idk what to say about covid one day we are like 250K+ the next we are up 70k+ . I hope we hit a peak already and are now going back down but who knows with the holidays and flu season around the corner .\n\nSo this is just my view and what ill be planning on doing ,\n\nFirst off, spys been selling off since last week , honestly its been a slow bleed all the way down to the 50ma, Im really expecting a bounce around there any time now . Im bearish on spy for the rest of this week because well, the ex dividend date is this Friday 9/17/2021. So chance on spy hitting any new highs this week are out of the equation. Also im just expecting a sell off for the rest of week maybe either tomo or Thursday a little pump but really not expecting much as it heads off to its ex dividend date.\n\nIll probably scalp puts, not sure which strike yet because idk what spys price will be these next 2 days.\n\nA lot of people are talking about a market having a crash or something coming and to them , all ill say is , put your money where your mouth is, right now is just a buying opportunity in my eyes ( for me im waiting for a little bit more of a dip , before buying some calls , but i am starting to sell dec puts for fb, and nvidia )\n\nI think what the market is doing right now is well... listening to jpow and understanding that he was right... \" economy open inflation go big, spending go big then stop , slow growth realization, market back to normal.\"\n\nEconomy opened and sure enough consumer price index came in hot which was expected , low supply , high demand, then it was followed by stellar earnings because well stimulus people stimulus. People still had that federal boost and all of that other stuff now that stimulus is gone , the market is figuring out that \"oh shit, everythings not going to grow as much because people arent spending as much and stimulus ended.\" Thats what i think is getting priced in now and why stocks are dropping right now .\n\nIf anything , this pain will start ending this friday ( ex dividend for spy so that itself is the last negative catalyst and it will probably finally hit the 50 ma 441 maybe a little lower but should start some kind of rebound. Then next week we have the fomc meeting where jpow will grab all the bears by the balls and say we will not taper until later which will cause the start of the next rally which will go into q3 earnings which will probably destroy expectations since we still had stimi cash , and if congress passes this new bill aka the 3 trilli bill then ladies and gentlemen q4 will be sexy asf . Which is followed by a wtf we doing in 2022 but hey , enjoy the moment guys !\n\nGo ahead and share your thoughts im all ears !",

        "selftext": "\\*Updated 9/29\\*\n\nHi everyone,\n\nI would like to make an update that includes new plays and share my ongoing DD on high short interest stocks, methodology, and conservative but high ROI plays moving into October. It's exhausting now as everything is considered a \"short squeeze\" but I would like shed some light on relatively safe plays and methodology/reasoning behind it. This methodology and process will always change based on data presented. The #1 rule in this is that you don't want to chase on plays that have been running and overextended as you'll become a bagholder. What I do for myself is to get in plays based on data/method that are not running (pre-squeeze), scale into the stock, wait for the catalysts, take profit/scale out of the stock once it starts running, buy on dip supports, and repeat until the play is exhausted. Please see below:\n\nMethodology/Criteria:\n\n1. I am looking at high short interest stocks on MarketWatch and HighShortInterestStocks continuously for the top 10 tickers (you can find these sites via Google and make sure to look at it continuously!). S3 has good information but I don't pay for the data.\n2. I will only discuss stocks with a market cap over $1.5B per WSB rules, but you can use this methodology to find other smaller cap plays yourself outside of WSB. \n   1. The current stocks in the Top 10 high short interest list on Marketwatch and meet a $1.5B market cap are: $ROOT, $SDC, $NKLA, $GOEV, and $GOGO\n3. I look for the following requirements (STRICT) and they must all be present at any given time.\n\na. The first requirement is the stock must be close to a 52 week low or close/below the 200 MA- you can also follow the YTD Change %. You want to make sure you are buying value and not stocks that are down because they are truly terrible companies. This gives you better chances of purchasing a company at a discount that can allow for higher ROI based on risk.\n\nb. The second requirement is the stock must have catalysts in the short term horizon- this allows for anticipation of upside (bullish) and call option flow. The most % of money I ever made was purchasing stocks/calls in their pre-squeeze stage before they actually squeezed. This way you don't get IV crushed while chasing but as the IV builds, you gain massively on calls. If you are purchasing calls when the IV is at or less than 90% and a catalyst hits that takes the IV &gt;130%, these are massive gains.\n\nc. The third requirement is that the stock float must be shorted &gt;30%. Low float stocks aren't a requirement although they certainly help in these situations but more than likely won't meet $1.5B market cap requirement per WSB.\n\nd. The 4th requirement are technicals. The one set up I always play is a falling wedge as long as it meets the requirements above. I also love playing cup and handles and bull flags as they are the most consistent. I do not play symmetrical triangles or wedges- I feel as though these are more unpredictable and can reverse against you hard.\n\ne. (not requirement) The other dataset that I look at are call/put ratio and open interest on call options but it is not a requirement. This can tell you how bullish or bearish generally the market is for the future. A large amount of OI on calls means people are anticipating something significant.\n\nf. (not requirement) When I am scalping/trading, I also keep in mind the $SPY $QQQ and $IWM (most important). Most of these stocks are small cap so they will follow the $IWM to a degree. Before I enter into a position, I always check to see that $IWM is on my side for a swing, otherwise, I wait. \n\n4) Scale In with stock/call purchases based on risk/reward ratio. Make sure to SCALE IN. This doesn't mean purchasing all at one time. I usually purchase not in time increments but in % decrease increments (on average -5%) to be safe and purchase 90% stock / 10% calls (&gt;3 months out) to scale in below based on my own risk management. If I want to go riskier/higher reward based on a catalyst or a quicker technical setup, I will increase the amount of calls bought vs shares or shorten the call expiration date. But I strongly advise purchasing calls that are &lt;3 month out exp. as time decay and IV crush will kill you on a wrong move. \n\ni.e. Day 1: 90% stock / 10% calls (20% of capital) and then repeat when the stock price drops 5%. If the stock price jumps, I don't scale up as many might do- I stick to the plan and wait for another -5% dip unless I see strong volume support at price level. There are many other plays and there will continue to be many others plays. Holding CASH is always a position.\n\n5) Once the catalyst hits or there is upside to the stock, I scale out of my positions/gains (not all at one time) and take profit. Make sure you follow volume - if the volume is strong, you can hold onto your positions much longer to get maximum ROI. In these cases, you can also buy on any dip or technical pattern setup opportunities as long as volume is coming in. **Volume is KEY.** If you don't see volume coming in on a setup, then I would take the gain/loss and find another play.\n\n6) Rinse, repeat, and share with others on your plays.\n\nThe charts for $ROOT, $SDC, $NKLA, $GOEV, and $GOGO are below and I will discuss the plays at the bottom of each image. Please also let me know if there are any catalysts for these stocks and ask any questions!\n\n**Time: 1 Year / 1 Day Charts**\n\n[$ROOT: -66&amp;#37; down YTD, below 200 EMA, and #4 High Short Interest. By far my favorite technical set up as it's a falling wedge and it has tested $5.19 as a double bottom. Breakout expected to be in the low to mid $6.  It could bounce or continue further so always keep cash to scale in. Volume is also preceding movement. There is the Carvana catalyst on the horizon and fundamentally they have $1B in cash vs. $1.4B market cap. $10.62 is the price target for next Fibonacci.](https://preview.redd.it/l38kx8je9iq71.png?width=1395&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5c8da6ad13f9c153f1d2bbf9bb8d8e2f403f878f)\n\n[$SDC: -56&amp;#37; YTD, #9 High Short Interest, and momentum as it's probably one of WSB's favorite. Broke out of it's 1 yr downtrend at $5.50 level and broke above 200 EMA, but couldn't hold \\(see volume\\). It tested the 23.6&amp;#37; Fibonacci but couldn't break as it needs to be a strong break \\(hard rejection\\). Volume is diminishing and it looks like it wants to re-test $4.63 low. This is an example of an exhausted play where you take profit on the way up and re-enter by scaling back in. Wait for this to curl again and you can scale in. ](https://preview.redd.it/i7ltwhkp9iq71.png?width=1422&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=450de6a1e4702e028ce33008856f6545ed2aa08f)\n\n[$NKLA: -37&amp;#37; YTD and #7 on High Short List. This one must have broken a lot of hearts as technically it looked like it was going to breakout of the downward wedge but you can see that there was no volume for continued momentum \\(required\\). Rejected and now it broke below the 200 EMA. Might see a bounce again around $10 for the short uptrend line and if it breaks, could see a re-test of $9.02. Wait for this to curl and scale back in if you want to play but it doesn't look like a high momo runner due to volume being absent. ](https://preview.redd.it/az15kf2u9iq71.png?width=1431&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=88443ea898be877389fa16773645b2d554745607)\n\n[$GOEV: -46&amp;#37; YTD and #8 on Short List. Recent runner as it broke yearly downtrend line at $7.10, fell due to no volume continuation, and then due to momo, bounced above 200 EMA, tested 23.6&amp;#37; Fibonacci, and now re-testing 200 EMA. Could bounce and head higher to the break of $9.30 again and break above. Look at the volume - this is a high momo stock as volume comes in\\/out. I prefer not playing these setups as the volume could go out any moment and prefer pre-squeeze setups before the volume comes in. ](https://preview.redd.it/u1k1b1c4aiq71.png?width=1415&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b62f75ae2e284a7e33cbfa1360c2ddd57735f76d)\n\n[$GOGO: -39&amp;#37; YTD and #14 on Short List. Exhausted play and wouldn't touch as it already broke out. Could see continuation as that is crazy volume but could also see a significant drop. The risk here is too high vs reward and it doesn't fit my methodology. I didn't even think about playing this as it's a triangle wedge and could have easily just tested the bottom trend line. The volume came in unexpectedly. ](https://preview.redd.it/c9y4nv0faiq71.png?width=1420&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=212d135dec7d8b50b4dd60a3b8cc885cdee79720)",

But if you dig deeper in their financials there is nothing to stop them. And the major risk from CCP i believe will dissipate going forward. \n\nThe whole crackdown on Chinese tech started with Jack Ma when he talked publicly and in front of Chinese high officials , how Chinese financial system is old and cant catch up with tech innovation. This was about ANT IPO. Well, imagine the best screw up and Jack Ma did that. But this can turn into an opportunity for those who didnt have positions before in Chinese stocks. \n\n2 weeks after Jack Ma \u2018s speech, crackdown started in November last year. It is my opinion that even CCP did not imagine this much sell off. Now I believe they are taking their feet from the brake , they cant let Chinese entrepreneurship lose its hope and they need large companies to rival American ones. \n\nAlso don\u2019t forget that these scrutiny is good for Chinese stocks in the long term. It makes them better organization by fixing their weaknesses. \n\n\nIf you are interested I can write a long post with all DD inside.",

(OTC PINK:OMHI), an owner and operator of OneMart super merchandising stores and Builders Depot in the Caribbean, and the parent of its wholly owned subsidiary, Rydeum Caribbean, Inc., of British Virgin Islands, today announced it has issued 200 contactless debit cards to the Jamaican Union of Travelers Association (JUTA), Montego Bay Chapter. Previously, on July 13, 2021, OMHI announced its first business to business (B2B), Local On-Demand Technology (LODE-TECH) contract with JUTA, the largest taxicab company in Jamaica.\n\nThe control center consisting of two computers, six 32\" monitors, and one 65\" LED TV, which is required for JUTA to manage the DoGetGo platform have been installed in the JUTA Montego Bay office and configured and tested in preparation for launch:\n\n* Rydeum has issued the first 200 driver debit cards, which allow drivers to receive contactless payments shortly after rides are complete.\n* Cards have been issued through a relationship which Rydeum has previously established with MasterCard &amp; Intercash.\n* Debit cards give drivers an option to withdraw cash from ATMs or to use at any vendor that accepts MasterCard.\n* The DoGetGo launch event is expected to be scheduled within the next 30 days amid strict COVID-19 protocols, in conjunction with the Planning Committee of Jamaica, the Jamaican government and relevant private sector parties - JUTA plans to issue cards to members at this event.\n* Following the launch event, up to 200 JUTA Montego Bay members will be available to service riders on the DoGetGo app in Montego Bay, with additional drivers added progressively.\n\n**\"Our 10 members who were able to preview the driver's app and the control center were fascinated, excited, and even gave it a thumbs up,** as they know the world is going in this direction and don't want to be left behind,\" said Simon Lawrence, President of JUTA. \"The biggest problem now is COVID-19, but it is forcing the entire country to get digital, and this makes the DoGetGo app a true game-changer, nonetheless we must work with the planning committee and the government to ensure that we can introduce this to the wider membership in a safe way amid government imposed COVID-19 gathering restrictions,\" said Simon Lawrence, President of JUTA.\n\n**\"I am very pleased to report the implementation of the DoGetGo app with JUTA Montego Bay continues to be a resounding success,\" said Mark Vanterpool**, President and CEO of OMHI. \"Once we gain greater traction in Jamaica, we will use our success here as a model for the rollout of DoGetGo across the Caribbean. On the British Virgin Islands, the combination of DoGetGo with our two OneMart superstores, our Builders Depot store and our convenience stores gives BVI residents and visitors the widest array of goods and services at the best prices with the only true contactless delivery in the country.

(OTC Pink: MMMW) recent testing on a small solar tracker unit has demonstrated that the tracker motor was substantially\u00a0 more powerful than required to move the tracker through the day.\u00a0 For example, a motor with only one third of an amp was required on the small unit which currently has a motor with 2.4 amps. \u00a0The patent pending solar tracker is designed to increase the power output of a solar project by more than 30 percent for less than 10 percent additional cost.\n\nMeanwhile, Mass Megawatts is taking note of the high growth market for solar trackers. The use of solar trackers is known to reduce the cost of solar powered electricity. The global demand is anticipated to be worth more than $3 billion by 2025 expanding from the current market size of about $2 billion. Mass Megawatts sees an opportunity to be part of the growing solar tracker market with a lower cost product than the trackers marketed by other solar tracker companies in this high growth segment of the solar energy market.\u00a0 A solar tracker is a method of tracking the sun throughout the day for a photovoltaic (PV) system. In order to increase energy output throughout the day. The market is anticipated to have substantial growth due to the growing need for renewable energy.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe patented pending, Mass Megawatts \u2018Solar Tracking System\u2019 (STS) is designed to improve solar-energy production while and at the same time reduce material and installation costs. The patented pending, Mass Megawatts \u2018Solar Tracking System\u2019 (STS) is designed to automatically adjust the position of solar panels throughout the day to receive an optimal-level of direct sunlight. Unlike other solar tracking technologies, the Mass Megawatts STS utilizes a low-cost structure that adds stability to the overall system while also improving energy production levels. The STS also uses a proprietary mechanical innovation to limit dynamic and static loading on the tracker, which can occur during periods of high wind and extreme weather, in order to reduce wind-related stresses and system downtime. The STS allows Mass Megawatts to lower material costs and reduce the number of solar panels needed to generate the rated capacity. Due to this advantage, Mass Megawatts can deliver more solar power production at a price similar to lower-capacity, stationary systems.\n\nWith its patent pending, Solar Tracking System and Wind Electric Power Generation system and very little debt. Mass Megawatts believes it is well positioned for expanded production and supporting its revenue generation goals in the longer term.\n\nProduct information and sales inquiries can be made through the company\u2019s contact page at\u00a0[www.massmegawatts.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=5ubLkMjXHztD5ZgvCJ2MNbIbGtiZyzFzEkDv34cFNyOZNETBPLgRphwZ7X_paXZML5qN6Nc10iEBQBap5ZJCGuMCIehU__HCiNKK9dEHYBc=)\u00a0and the e-mail address on the Website.\n\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements that could be affected by risks and uncertainties.

        "selftext": "September 7,  JAKARTA \u2013 \n\nThe legal process for the trademark dispute of anti-rust liquid products between the WD40 and Get All 40, which has been running for more than a year, is still ongoing. Get All 40 will appeal to the Supreme Court for the decision of the Central Jakarta District Court of Niaga Judges which is considered not to apply the principle of justice and seems reckless.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe feud began in 2015 when WD40 filed a lawsuit for the cancellation of the Get All 40 certificate to the level of the Supreme Court (MA). However, Get All 40 managed to reclaim its rights through the Intellectual Property Rights Appeal Commission (HAKI) by taking advantage of the issuance of PP 10 of 2019, concerning Procedures for Appealing Marks in Intellectual Property Rights.\n\nAfter getting the certificate back, on August 18, 2020, Benny Bong as the owner of the Get All 40 trademark sued for compensation to WD40.\n\nThe trial of the lawsuit was submitted on August 6, 2021. However, on January 5, 2021, WD40 through its attorney Hadiputranto, Hadinoto &amp; Partner (HHP) filed a lawsuit against the cancellation of the Get All 40 certificate as previously done on January 5, 2021, then the Panel of Judges granted WD40 lawsuit with decision Number 03/Pdt.Sus-Merek/2021/PN.Niaga.Jkt.Pst on August 25th, however, the decision of the Panel of Judges led by Dulhusin,SH,MH was considered legally flawed, reckless and not based on the principles of justice. and propriety, legal defects due to the shortcomings of the parties.\n\nBenny Bong as the owner of the Get All 40 trademark felt that the court\u2019s decision had violated the law and the process was not based on the principle of justice, \u201cAll the defenses that we submitted were not taken into consideration. The Panel of Judges only refers to the arguments presented by the plaintiffs,\u201d said Benny Bong to a number of media crews on Monday (6/9/2021).\n\nThis businessman who was once a WD40 dealer suspected that there was a \u2018game\u2019 behind the decision,\n\nWhile the testimony of expert witness Dr. Suyud Margono, SH., MHum., FCIArb. The panel of judges who said there was no similarity were ignored by the panel of judges. \u201cPak Suyud is the most expert in the field of trademarks. But his statement was not taken into consideration,\u201d said Benny Bong.\n\nBenny Bong deeply regrets the attitude of law enforcement officers who do not take sides with local entrepreneurs who are struggling to create domestic products to be able to compete with imported products. \u201cEven President Jokowi has repeatedly said that we love domestic products,\u201d he said.\n\nThe same thing was conveyed by Chandra Suwono, a businessman and chairman of the HWI Lintedeves Market Cooperative. According to him, there has been injustice against local entrepreneurs, as well as playing around with the law in Indonesia by foreign businessmen with WD 40, because the panel of judges is of the opinion that WD40 is a large company, registered worldwide.\n\n\u201cBut we should refer to the law in Indonesia. Indonesian products must be supported by all Indonesian people, including law enforcement officers. The President himself supports domestic products, \u201csaid Chandra.\n\nChandra suspects that there are big powers who deliberately make efforts with all events to play with the law in Indonesia and try to shut down domestic production. \u201cWe should support Get All 40 as a domestic product so that it can compete in the global world,\u201d said Chandra.\n\nIn the absence of legal certainty, according to Chandra, the business world, especially domestic production, will be left hanging, because it is attacked by large outside parties.\n\nFrom that decision, we should suspect that there has been a legal affair. In addition to making an appeal to the Supreme Court, I will also complain to Commission III of the DPR, the Judicial Commission, and the KPK to oversee the next legal process, Chandra said.\n\nAs the attorney for Get All 40, Djamhur, S.H, he has many notes that will be written down in the memory of the appeal later. There are several important points that weaken the decision, such as the lack of parties and the validity of the legal standing.\n\nAccording to Djamhur, in their consideration regarding the lack of parties, the Panel of Judges said that it was the right of the plaintiff\u2019s initiative to determine which parties would be sued in accordance with the jurisprudence of Supreme Court Decision No. 546K/Sip/1970 issued on 28 October 1970.\n\n\u201cIt turned out that after I checked, the Supreme Court Decree No. 546 does not concern the party being sued, the decision is only for a dispute over the sale of rubber between Eka Nasrun, President Director of PT Bintang Jaya Raya and the head of Bank BNI City Branch. It has nothing to do with this matter. This means that the Panel of Judges \u2018shoots from the ground\u2019, as if we were tricked and fooled, \u201csaid Djamhur.\n\nDjamhur wondered why some of the jurisprudence related to the trademark dispute that he submitted was ignored, but the Panel of Judges instead used jurisprudence that had nothing to do with the case being decided.\n\n\u201cThe Appeal Commission should have been involved as a defendant because what is being questioned is the certificate issued by the Appeals Commission. In fact, every decision of the Appeals Commission is usually challenged in the Commercial Court,\u201d explained Djamhur.\n\nDjamhur also highlighted the decision of the Panel of Judges which did not take into account the opinion of expert witnesses who stated that there were no similarities in essence between WD40 and Get All 40.\n\nAccording to Djamhur, his party has also filed an exception regarding the Legal Standing of the plaintiff\u2019s attorney because the principal\u2019s passport is only in the form of a photocopy legalized by the local Indonesian Embassy, not the original document.\n\n\u201cThe legalization of the local Indonesian Embassy is only limited to stamps and signatures, but not about the contents. The judge\u2019s decision stated that the signature on the document was confirmed by the Consulate General of the Republic of Indonesia. Well, the words \u2018justified\u2019 cannot be proven. So the word justify is just an assumption by the Panel of Judges, not based on documentary evidence,\u201d said Djamhur, who hoped that the Supreme Court would consider his appeal wisely and fairly.\n\nAccording to him, there has been injustice against local entrepreneurs, as well as playing around with the law in Indonesia by foreign businessmen with WD 40, because the panel of judges think that WD 40 is a large company, registered worldwide.",

        "selftext": "  \n\n# A business-model: \n\nNetflix\u2019s vision relies on two conditions: expand the user base as quickly as possible to gain a strong position in the market; to fulfill the first condition you must create your own content. As we will see under, this strategy is still in place, however, we are at an inflection point. Netflix will either continue its meteoric growth or settle and progressively disappear. There will be no in-between. \n\n**Subscriber Growth Drives Netflix Story**\n\nOver the last several years, Netflix was focused on growing its subscriber base. In this sense, it has been investing heavily in local-language original content production worldwide. The addition of net subscribers dictates Netflix stock performance.\n\nNetflix ended the second quarter with 209.18 million subscribers worldwide. The U.S. and Canada accounted for 35.4% of their total subscriber base. The rest is spread across the globe.\n\nStay-at-home orders during the Covid-19 pandemic drove business for Netflix and other home entertainment services. Consumers watched more television because movie theaters, live music, and sports were shut down during the pandemic. However, the reopening of the economy hurts Netflix. \n\nSubscribers keep increasing but at a slower rate.\n\n**Netflix: product analysis**\n\nNow for a while, Netflix has been producing its own series. This choice limits the costs of purchasing series from other producers and ensures exclusive content for subscribers. Netflix has been rather successful with hits as: \"Money Heist,\" \"Orange Is the New Black,\" \"Stranger Things,\" \"The Umbrella Academy\" and \"The Witcher.\"\n\nAnd this successful trend is increasing as recent shows on Netflix have been buzzworthy including: \"Bridgerton,\" \"Ginny &amp; Georgia\" and \"Sweet Tooth.\" Popular new original movies include \"Fatherhood,\" \"Army of the Dead\" and \"Gunpowder Milkshake.\"\n\nCreating its own content is a great initiative. A survey by investment bank Cowen showed that Netflix's growing library is the top driver of new customers. Managers\u2019 perception of reality and the wishes of customers seem aligned.\n\n**Netflix Dominates 2021 Awards Season**\n\nThese series are not only commercially successful but also cinematographically successful. This year, Netflix has been awarded numerous prizes.\n\nOn July 13, Netflix received 129 nominations for Emmy Awards from the Television Academy. It was close to second to WarnerMedia's HBO and HBO Max, which garnered 130 nominations. The most-honored Netflix shows included \"The Crown,\" \"The Queen's Gambit\" and \"Bridgerton.\"\n\nNetflix won the most awards of any studio at the 93rd Academy Awards on April 25. It picked up seven Oscars, but it came up empty in the best picture and acting categories. Netflix headed into the ceremony with 36 nominations, far more than any other studio.\n\nNetflix also garnered the most awards of any studio or network at the 26th annual Critics Choice Awards on March 7. It won 14 awards for productions such as \"The Crown,\" \"The Queen's Gambit\" and \"Ma Rainey's Black Bottom.\"\n\nAt this year's Producers Guild Awards on March 24, Netflix won awards for episodic TV drama (\"The Crown\"), limited series (\"The Queen's Gambit\"), and documentary film (\"My Octopus Teacher\").\n\nNetflix took the top prize at the 27th Screen Actors Guild Awards on April 4 for its movie \"The Trial of the Chicago 7.\" It also won awards for TV shows \"The Queen's Gambit,\" \"Ozark\" and \"The Crown.\" Netflix took home seven awards at this year's SAG Awards.\n\n# Fundamentals\n\nHere are few fundamentals (because the amount of cash the company owns still matters). \n\n**Balance sheet**\n\n\u00b7 Current assets or well above current liabilities which means that the company can pay all its short-term debt with the cash on hand. \n\n\u00b7 Moreover, one can see that equity is high and increased a lot in the past 6 months (by more than 25%). This is great news for shareholders as it means that Netflix has cash for future investments, or it will return it to investors.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Netflix Q2 2021: letter to shareholders](https://preview.redd.it/8zbcycc9tin71.png?width=632&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c4ae3e9201a461abc75944ab8710a78270efc600)\n\n**Statement of Profit and Loss**\n\nWe can observe a slight increase in revenue compared to last quarter however it does not transfer in higher net income as marketing expenses increased and interest and other income sharply dropped. We can wonder if the increase in marketing expenses was useful as they increased it by 12% when led to an increase in revenue (if there is a causal link) of 2,5%. Then lower revenue from interest (loss) also led to a decrease in net income compared to the previous quarter. \n\nOn a broader scale, results are good compared to the same quarter one year ago. This is mostly due to a proportionally smaller increase in the cost of revenue compared to the increase in revenue itself. However, it must be noted that also compared to this period, the increase in marketing expense did not lead to a proportionally increase in revenue. In the long run, this might be annoying as it means that customers do not react to Netflix\u2019s marketing. It reduces Netflix's possibility to increase revenue and then profit through marketing. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Netflix Q2 2021: letter to shareholders](https://preview.redd.it/2lmexa0itin71.png?width=605&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=38a1bfb9451e19011ba8407204ed5fcec0ce8a7c)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Growing competition:\n\nMeanwhile, Netflix is facing new competition from traditional media companies. **AT&amp;T** (T)-through WarnerMedia launched HBO Max in May 2020. **Comcast** (CMCSA)-owned NBCUniversal followed in July 2020 with Peacock. **Discovery** (DISCA) debuted its Discovery+service on Jan. 4. **ViacomCBS** (VIAC) launched Paramount+ on March 4.\n\nOther services include **Amazon** (AMZN) Prime Video, **Apple**'s (AAPL) Apple TV+, **Walt Disney**'s (DIS) Disney+, Hulu, and more.\n\nIncreasing competition is starting to take on Netflix\u2019s market share.  Relative to competitors Netflix\u2019 shows are getting less popular:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1gx3zmbotin71.png?width=605&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=39551e34fdc384ed13a76429f3f0ef26672f301d\n\nThe situation could get even more complicated for Netflix. Indeed, knowing that customers have in average 5 streaming services ([https://www.jdpower.com/business/resources/despite-return-normal-people-spending-more-time-and-money-streaming-services-now](https://www.jdpower.com/business/resources/despite-return-normal-people-spending-more-time-and-money-streaming-services-now)), if we subtract one music subscription, we are left with 4 subscriptions. Customers will likely have a Disney and Prime subscription due to the variety of their catalog and the \u201cmust\u201d they contain. Amazon\u2019s recent move to buy MGM and with Disney still releasing blockbusters, it seems unlikely that customers will avoid these two services.  Then, currently, it makes sense to add Netflix among the two streaming services left. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, such a high number of subscriptions is unlikely to persist over time, people will likely tend back to their pre-pandemic habits.  Moreover, in the above reasoning, I did not consider Apple. With its massive resources, it could increase its budget in order to attract more customers. Companies like AT&amp;T and Comcast still have deep pockets and if they judge it useful to invest in streaming, they will have resources that Netflix does not have. Of course, currently, Netflix offers the best product as shown by this poll ([https://www.cowen.com/insights/assessing-video-trends-in-us-uk-germany-and-japan/](https://www.cowen.com/insights/assessing-video-trends-in-us-uk-germany-and-japan/)). They have certain knowledge and unique know-how and brand. However, quality can be purchased by hiring good employees and the previously mentioned companies have the capabilities to hire such people.\n\n# Questionable management decisions:\n\nOn Oct. 29 of 2020, Netflix increased its price by 1 USD for the standard and premium tiers of its subscription video-on-demand service in the U.S. Even if Netflix stock jumped on the news. This decision is questionable. Indeed, Netflix is already one of the most expensive services compared to competitors. Prime is at $8,99 per month and Disney Plus is at $7,99. Other competitors are usually a bit cheaper than Netflix. It also means that now Netflix has fewer possibilities to increase profit. We have seen that competition is increasing, which means that it will be more complicated to draw new customers. At the same time, rising prices will get even more complicated.\n\nManagement should also reconsider its marketing as the analysis above in the \u201cfundamentals\u201d part shows that it is inefficient at increasing revenue. This is concerning.\n\n**TLDR:** Netflix is still a top-of-the-art streaming service. Recent awards show that series from Netflix are the best. However, competition is ramping up with Amazon who bought MGM, and Disney still releasing blockbusters. Deep-pocket companies like Apple and AT&amp;T could be future challenges. Moreover, Netflix seems to have already used its ability to increase earnings through a price increase as their service is the most expensive compared to pairs. Polls showed that the competition is getting market share even if the number of subscribers keeps increasing for Netflix. In conclusion, I do not expect Netflix' shares to decrease but I do not see numerous future catalysts which could push the stock higher. \n\nPS: As my text present it, I am not a shareholder of Netflix. I have been in the past, but this is over for the reasons explained above.",

        "selftext": " \n\nIF YOU LIKE TOKENS, THIS IS MY WHITE PAGE FOR A PROJECT I HAVE WORKED ON FOR A YEAR. THIS IS NOT A PUMP AND DUMP TOKENS DISCUSSION, RATHER JUST AN IDEA FOR US TO GET 24/7 access to markets. Unfortunately I lack the capital to ever produce this if anyone wants to contact me to work on this with me I would be more than ok to discus it, but would like people to understand that this is what we should want. It grants the ability to buy and sell stocks 24/7 (no after hours) and it allows liquidity of the stocks bought. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSince September 2020. I actually feel this is a fitting time to talk about tokenization of stocks, TOKEN, energy consumption, and tier 1-4 money. \n\nSo tokens have been around since 2008, there are various different types ranging from tokens, altcoins, to BiTC, etc. They have value because people say they have value. There are 2 main algorithms for mineable tokens Proof of Work and Proof of stake. When your computer is mining tokens in a POW way it is using its gpu/cpu/asic mining to solve complex algorithms by using hashes. Proof of Stake does the same but you have a staked amount and the various nodes are approved. HOWEVER there is something that is a token or a representation of something else. Chainlink does this. Now I believe firmly that you could take every stock in the stock market and tokenize it so that it can preform 2 functions.\n\n1. It gets rid of the need of a broker because it becomes a peer to peer exchange.\n\n2. It allows for stocks to become a more liquid asset moving from tier 2 to tier 1. This in theory would allow a person to purchase an ETF or other dividend granting stock and hold them in a tokenized form garning more interest than what a bank would off as ETF grant both Dividends and appreciate in value. Furthermore, you could if the market was extremely efficient use the tokens to buy goods and services. So long as there was an established base currency to chart the movement and trade quickly enough.\n\nI did run into several problems however. \n\n1. efficient trading would mean that stocks would need to be traded in seconds, if there was no buyer a middleman would need to hold it. THIS was solved by limiting the tokenized stocks to ETFs, and stocks located on the Dow jones, Nasdaq, and S&amp;P 500. \n\n2. Energy consumption of Tokens in movement is extremely costly. To move BitC, ETC and many other tokens there is a gas fee associated with the movement. This is currently 2.251 USD. This would potentially increase dependent on the amount of trades for big stocks, and changes to the code.\n\n3. The amount of transactions that may occur per second on the Blockchain is limited. If I were to complete the movement I would need around 1700 transactions per second just to match the amount of usage in a VISA card to pay for things. BitC currently runs at 4.6 transactions per second.\n\nThus using either ETC or BitC based Blockchains were impossible due to these present constraints.\n\nHowever, Problems 2 and 3 were solved by looking into the XRP source code which has a low cost of movement, and can handle the amount of transactions. As of present the cost to move 1 unit of XRP costs .0002 USD. XRP also is able to due approximately 1200 transactions per second thus allowing for faster movement which could see massive improvement.\n\nThus I choose XRP as my source code to examine and add to. As a baseline it achieves the baseness of what I want, however, I wanted add 3 things.\n\n1. An \"Autofork\" mechanism that allows the tokens to split and send one of the forks to a secure wallet for examination at year end.\n\n2. Smart Contract features that allow the user to obtain the stock by choice, or an instant payout.\n\n3. Smart features that allow the user to be notified of dividend dates, Splits that could happen, and reverse splits. \n\nThese will be discussed Here.\n\nThe \"autofork and reclamation process\" is vital to my idea, as it does 2 things. Firstly it clears the electronic ledger which decreases the subsequent energy costs of moving the token. It further allows regulators to check for fraud, manipulations, etc. The ledger functionality of tokens are immutable, showing which wallets it has been sent to. Thus things such as short ladders, pump and dump schemes, etc. would be easily traceable once the ledgers would be analyzed by a computer. Current Machine learning techniques allow for patterns to be observed and thus proper regulation could occur. Furthermore, transfers of stocks, assets, etc. could be tracked. Manipulation of the current tax codes through trusts, IRA, and offshore accounts could be much more easily observed and corrected. The fork allows users to maintain the same amount of token despite there prior tokens being taken. Thus it is all the same. \n\nSmart contract features Remain very important. Smart contracts allow users to set time frames, and do things otherwise not available to base tokens. Setting these up would allow users to quickly exchange currencies without the need of active participation, set up \"if-then\" statements\", and much more intricate details otherwise not available to tokens.\n\nOther smart features is just an offshoot of that which serves to increase the user experience and any technical problems that may be encountered. As stock splits and reverse splits are common, the code will need to be adjusted for each token in order to allow for it to be acknowledged. This potentially could mean forking the token, but this could be problematic in terms of record keeping. Thus adding the ability to manipulate supply for holders becomes very important to the creators of this.\n\nNow a completely tokenized economy requires a base currency from which everything can have its price based upon. This is important as it allows companies to better determine what a base price of a good may be. If the tokens are in an \"extremely efficient\" exchange, near instantaneous exchanges would prevent price changes of stocks from affecting prices. Now the problem with this is it eliminates 3 major players: Banks, Merchants, Brokers. \n\nAs of present the average US savings rate is 00.06%.  Checking accounts is 00.03%. The average increase of the Vanguard S&amp;P 500 ETF has seen an increase of \\~7% on average with a dividend of 1.29% annually. This is over 40 times greater than a checking account. If it was useable at any time for a trade, people could in theory invest and then use the tokens to pay for goods and services thus negating the need for a checking account. Banks would see a great amount of stress. The average american would see an increase in stock market participation.\n\nA further problem encountered would be for merchants. Companies like VISA, Mastercard, Amex, all function as middlemen as they make money per swipe. If a person were to use the system as mention, they wouldn't make a dime because of the peer-to-peer functionality of Tokens. As tokens go from one wallet to another, it means that if they were to move from a person to a business no middleman is needed.\n\nFinally, the peer-to-peer functionality removes the need for a broker. This would further affect large brokers as traditional stock trading highly depended on brokers for this. Costly paperwork that is approximately $170 Billion would see a substantial decrease as a result. \n\nMany more possibilities are present such as NFTs created for things such as loans that are group funded and split dependent on the amount contributed, movement of music through NFTs as these are tokenized. This persists for other things such as Video game downloaded codes, artwork, and other presently created NFTs. In a perfectly potentially goofy scenario, trading codes of video games could be used as payment if the market had a buyer. In theory if a person had a copy of game 1 and its \"verification code\" (in the form of an NFT), you could trade this for game 2 if there was a buyer immediately looking for it. This is an extremely unlikely scenario, however it does make the exchange of these goods a much easier. \n\nAnother potential pro is the ability to properly assess people's \"Net worth\". Examination into the \"Net worth\" of the 00.01% becomes a possible. This in turn can assist the government with finding tax evasion.",

        "selftext": " \\*Updated 9/30\\*\n\nHi everyone,\n\nI would like to make an update that includes new plays and share my ongoing DD on high short interest stocks, methodology, and conservative but high ROI plays moving into October. It's exhausting now as everything is considered a \"short squeeze\" but I would like shed some light on relatively safe plays and methodology/reasoning behind it. This methodology and process will always change based on data presented. The #1 rule in this is that you don't want to chase on plays that have been running and overextended as you'll become a bagholder. What I do for myself is to get in plays based on data/method that are not running (pre-squeeze), scale into the stock, wait for the catalysts, take profit/scale out of the stock once it starts running, buy on dip supports, and repeat until the play is exhausted. Please see below:\n\nMethodology/Criteria:\n\n1. I am looking at high short interest stocks on MarketWatch and HighShortInterestStocks continuously for the top 10 tickers (you can find these sites via Google and make sure to look at it continuously!). S3 has good information but I don't pay for the data.\n2. I will only discuss stocks with a market cap over $1.5B per WSB rules, but you can use this methodology to find other smaller cap plays yourself outside of WSB.\n   1. The current stocks in the Top 10 high short interest list on Marketwatch and meet a $1.5B market cap are: $ROOT, $SDC, $NKLA, and $GOEV\n3. I look for the following requirements (STRICT) and they must all be present at any given time.\n\na. The first requirement is the stock must be close to a 52 week low or close/below the 200 MA- you can also follow the YTD Change %. You want to make sure you are buying value and not stocks that are down because they are truly terrible companies. This gives you better chances of purchasing a company at a discount that can allow for higher ROI based on risk.\n\nb. The second requirement is the stock must have catalysts in the short term horizon- this allows for anticipation of upside (bullish) and call option flow. The most % of money I ever made was purchasing stocks/calls in their pre-squeeze stage before they actually squeezed. This way you don't get IV crushed while chasing but as the IV builds, you gain massively on calls. If you are purchasing calls when the IV is at or less than 90% and a catalyst hits that takes the IV &gt;130%, these are massive gains.\n\nc. The third requirement is that the stock float must be shorted &gt;30%. Low float stocks aren't a requirement although they certainly help in these situations but more than likely won't meet $1.5B market cap requirement per WSB.\n\nd. The 4th requirement are technicals. The one set up I always play is a falling wedge as long as it meets the requirements above. I also love playing cup and handles and bull flags as they are the most consistent. I do not play symmetrical triangles or wedges- I feel as though these are more unpredictable and can reverse against you hard.\n\ne. (not requirement) The other dataset that I look at are call/put ratio and open interest on call options but it is not a requirement. This can tell you how bullish or bearish generally the market is for the future. A large amount of OI on calls means people are anticipating something significant.\n\nf. (not requirement) When I am scalping/trading, I also keep in mind the $SPY $QQQ and $IWM (most important). Most of these stocks are small cap so they will follow the $IWM to a degree. Before I enter into a position, I always check to see that $IWM is on my side for a swing, otherwise, I wait.\n\n4) Scale In with stock/call purchases based on risk/reward ratio. Make sure to SCALE IN. This doesn't mean purchasing all at one time. I usually purchase not in time increments but in % decrease increments (on average -5%) to be safe and purchase 90% stock / 10% calls (&gt;3 months out) to scale in below based on my own risk management. If I want to go riskier/higher reward based on a catalyst or a quicker technical setup, I will increase the amount of calls bought vs shares or shorten the call expiration date. But I strongly advise purchasing calls that are &lt;3 month out exp. as time decay and IV crush will kill you on a wrong move.\n\ni.e. Day 1: 90% stock / 10% calls (20% of capital) and then repeat when the stock price drops 5%. If the stock price jumps, I don't scale up as many might do- I stick to the plan and wait for another -5% dip unless I see strong volume support at price level. There are many other plays and there will continue to be many others plays. Holding CASH is always a position.\n\n5) Once the catalyst hits or there is upside to the stock, I scale out of my positions/gains (not all at one time) and take profit. Make sure you follow volume - if the volume is strong, you can hold onto your positions much longer to get maximum ROI. In these cases, you can also buy on any dip or technical pattern setup opportunities as long as volume is coming in. **Volume is KEY.** If you don't see volume coming in on a setup, then I would take the gain/loss and find another play.\n\n6) Rinse, repeat, and share with others on your plays.\n\nThe charts for $ROOT, $SDC, $NKLA, and $GOEV are below and I will discuss the plays at the bottom of each image. Please also let me know if there are any catalysts for these stocks and ask any questions!\n\n**Time: 1 Year / 1 Day Charts**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[ $ROOT: -66&amp;#37; down YTD, below 200 EMA, and #4 High Short Interest. By far my favorite technical set up as it's a falling wedge and it has tested $5.19 as a double bottom. Breakout expected to be in the low to mid $6. It could bounce or continue further so always keep cash to scale in. Volume is also preceding movement. There is the Carvana catalyst on the horizon and fundamentally they have $1B in cash vs. $1.4B market cap. $10.62 is the price target for next Fibonacci. ](https://preview.redd.it/11c3p84ffnq71.png?width=1395&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=de7c65b3ca4c6d58834fa47f4f1de8ede3f5cadb)\n\n[$SDC: -56&amp;#37; YTD, #9 High Short Interest, and momentum as it's probably one of WSB's favorite. Broke out of it's 1 yr downtrend at $5.50 level and broke above 200 EMA, but couldn't hold \\(see volume\\). It tested the 23.6&amp;#37; Fibonacci but couldn't break as it needs to be a strong break \\(hard rejection\\). Volume is diminishing and it looks like it wants to re-test $4.63 low. This is an example of an exhausted play where you take profit on the way up and re-enter by scaling back in. Wait for this to curl again and you can scale in. ](https://preview.redd.it/4sgg5czhfnq71.png?width=1422&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=55d91705f1aac405c2d6909875fcefa29f7af7c1)\n\n[ $NKLA: -37&amp;#37; YTD and #7 on High Short List. This one must have broken a lot of hearts as technically it looked like it was going to breakout of the downward wedge but you can see that there was no volume for continued momentum \\(required\\). Rejected and now it broke below the 200 EMA. Might see a bounce again around $10 for the short uptrend line and if it breaks, could see a re-test of $9.02. Wait for this to curl and scale back in if you want to play but it doesn't look like a high momo runner due to volume being absent. ](https://preview.redd.it/7908jdbkfnq71.png?width=1431&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d8c3eb6f816fd2cdd64a02d752f9b5bc91d53670)\n\n[ $GOEV: -46&amp;#37; YTD and #8 on Short List. Recent runner as it broke yearly downtrend line at $7.10, fell due to no volume continuation, and then due to momo, bounced above 200 EMA, tested 23.6&amp;#37; Fibonacci, and now re-testing 200 EMA. Could bounce and head higher to the break of $9.30 again and break above. Look at the volume - this is a high momo stock as volume comes in\\/out. I prefer not playing these setups as the volume could go out any moment and prefer pre-squeeze setups before the volume comes in. ](https://preview.redd.it/4sdvllenfnq71.png?width=1415&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=707b6c5a41101e949cc2cb0f9507d7b3dedec996)",

        "selftext": "I   owned some shares of QTS preferred A series stock. When Blackstone    acquired QTS I assumed the stock would simply transfer to a new issue    via Blackstone. It appears instead that I simply am unable to trade the    shares I own, at least that's how it appears in my Fidelity account.   From the announcement today:\n\n&gt;Following  the closing of its acquisition on August 31, 2021  by affiliates of  Blackstone Infrastructure Partners, Blackstone Real  Estate Income  Trust, Inc. and Blackstone Property Partners, QTS Realty  Trust (\"QTS\")  announced that holders of its 6.50% Series A Cumulative  Convertible  Perpetual Preferred Limited Liability Company Units (the  \"New Series A  Preferred Units\") will have the right, until the close of  business on  October 14, 2021, to convert each New Series A Preferred Unit into  $172.84 in cash. Thereafter, holders of New Series A Preferred Units  will have the right to convert each unit into $167.40  in cash. At the  closing of the acquisition, each outstanding share of  QTS 6.50% Series B  Cumulative Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock was  automatically  converted into one New Series A Preferred Unit.  \nAdditional   information regarding the conversion is included in a notice of   occurrence of a fundamental change that has been distributed to holders   of New Series A Preferred Units. Holders who wish to convert their New   Series A Preferred Units should contact their broker, bank or other   nominee. Computershare is serving as the conversion agent and can be   contacted at c/o Computershare, Voluntary Corporate Actions, 150 Royall   Street Suite V, Canton, MA 02021 or \\[redacted email\\]\n\nIt  appears I should be able to convert the shares to cash but Fidelity  seems not to be able to handle that, at least not via the app. Does  anyone know the way to go about this?",

        "selftext": "First of all do your own DD. For disclosure i own BABA, tencent and jd.com - 10% of total portfolio. \nChinese stocks have been oversold IMO. From Alibaba to JD.com. But if you dig deeper in their financials there is nothing to stop them. And the major risk from CCP i believe will dissipate going forward. \n\nThe whole crackdown on Chinese tech started with Jack Ma when he talked publicly and in front of Chinese high officials , how Chinese financial system is old and cant catch up with tech innovation. This was about ANT IPO. Well, imagine the best screw up and Jack Ma did that. But this can turn into an opportunity for those who didnt have positions before in Chinese stocks. \n\n2 weeks after Jack Ma \u2018s speech, crackdown started in November last year. It is my opinion that even CCP did not imagine this much sell off. Now I believe they are taking their feet from the brake , they cant let Chinese entrepreneurship lose its hope and they need large companies to rival American ones. \n\nAlso don\u2019t forget that these scrutiny is good for Chinese stocks in the long term. It makes them better organization by fixing their weaknesses. \n\n\nIf you are interested I can write a long post with all DD inside.",
