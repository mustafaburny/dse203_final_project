        "selftext": "Last night, I was watching the Rolland Garros semi-finals (Grand Slam tournament - basically 1 of the 4 biggest tennis tournaments every year.)\n\nI love tennis both as a player and spectator, and as I have been rooting for this particular player for many years now, whom yesterday had a real chance of winning and going into the Finals of Rolland Garros for the first time in his career, I thought to myself:\n\n*Why not place a small fun bet to make it all the more exciting*.\n\nI had never betted on sports ever before this, maybe once with $2 as a joke with some friends around 10 years ago or so.\n\nThe player I am supporting starts to lose during the first hour of the match. So I sign up, deposit the minimum $10, and find that the return rate was 4/1 (I.e. $10 gets me $50 if my player wins, $40 profit).\n\nBeing a massive fan of the player, I thought on top of my own excitement for the game, 4/1 odds were fantastic.\n\nI am about to place the bet, but I find that the odds had shifted to 3/1 as my player had started earnings some points back.\n\nThen to 10/3, then 3/1 again.\n\nI found myself in a disgusting mindset hoping my player would lose a few points so that I can get in on the 4/1 odds, which I thought were great odds. **I had never, ever wished for this player to lose a point before**. This shook me quite a bit.\n\nAnd it happens! I quickly place my bet, **and I realise I had just bought the dip on a fucking tennis match.**\n\nThe match resumes and my player keeps losing. I refuse to believe this will happen as like I mentioned previously, I am a massive fan, believe in him, and want him to succeed.\n\nThe match reaches a point where my player is nearly defeated, at which point I go back and look at the odds.\n\nI see now the new revised odds at 7/1, then one more point is lost and I it goes to 8/1!\n\nOn the rush of adrenaline from the match and from my desire for my player to win, I deposit another $10 and place another bet at $10, with a profit of $80 if my player wins.\n\nIn the moment I realise **I just doubled down on a tennis dip, and I have a position of $20 with a potential profit of $120.**\n\nA few points later and a lot of adrenaline, and it happens. I am thrilled.\n\nMy player makes a comeback, FUCK YEEAH, I scream!\n\nHe gets back in the game and for the next hour or so ups his game significantly, just as I had hoped. **The match is a complete thriller filled with adrenaline and unbelievable tennis**. I am loving it.\n\nI am so happy for him and at the same time, **I am thinking about my tennis tendies.**\n\nThe game reaches a point from near defeat, to perfect equilibrium in score from the two players.\n\nI log back in to the betting platform to look at how the odds are fairing now.\n\nThe **$10** bet I had made early in the game was now worth **$17.40**\n\nThe **$10** bet I had made later in the game was now worth **$31.31**\n\nI now had the option to cash out nearly at 150% return, get out and enjoy the game and root for my player, **or diamond hand this bitch and root for my player still**.\n\nI choose the latter as the $20 was insignificant to me, and think to my learnings that **I will pass the fuck out before I tap out.**\n\nA few exhilarating points ensue, but it turns out my player had become exhausted. The rest of the game progresses and it's clear that he will lose. He cannot keep up the brilliant come back that had taken place thus far.\n\nI go back into the betting platform and noticed that:\n\nThe **$10** bet I had made early in the game was now worth **$0.35**\n\nThe **$10** bet I had made later in the game was now worth **$0.14**\n\nNot only was my favourite player about to lose, but **my contracts would expire worthless.**\n\nAnd lose he did.\n\nIt was an incredible match and he won the hearts of many fans that night. He is an unbelievable player with so much promise as he is still very young.\n\nThe tennis they played was just fantastic.\n\n\\---\n\nThe whole experience left me thinking to myself that the emotions, the mechanics, the complete and utter unpredictability where identical with options trading.\n\nIt was then that it **really** hit me that the term \"investing\", or \"trading\" platforms is the fakest front for what is actually absolute gambling.\n\n I can't help but feel a bit dirty that I took something I am passionate for, something I've kept pure for so many years, a pure love for the sport and put inside emotions and mechanics of greed and opportunism. That's the definition of the ugly side of capitalism and I got the taste of it first hand last night.\n\nI have deleted my betting account and will never engage in sports betting again after this. **The rooting and cheering I had for this player in previous matches VS this one felt self-less and pure, whereas last night I found myself rooting on the fact that I'd make money. This left me feeling pretty shitty with myself.**\n\nI thought I would share this story with all of you retards, hoping that you will learn something and relate on a level which will benefit you in life.\n\n\\---\n\n**tl;dr**\n\n1) Some things are best kept pure and outside the scope of making money.\n\n2) Options are not financial derivatives, they are **gambling** derivatives.\n\n3) Gambling can exist in every single aspect of life, and it can really consume you and your passions.\n\n4) TIM APPLE 122C 11/20, LET'S FUCKING GO YOU ABSOLUTE FUCKS.",

        "selftext": "U.S. equity valuations have become a \"total nightmare\" fueled by \"young and dumb\" investors, according to Cole Smead, president and portfolio manager at Smead Capital Management.\n\nAt present, investors are paying 22 times forward earnings to purchase stocks on the S&amp;P 500, 50% higher than the 10-year average valuations across the index.\n\nThe forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio divides the current share price of a company by its estimated future earnings per share (EPS).\n\nMuch of the market rally which took the U.S. benchmark from correction territory in March to an all-time high in August was driven by tech megastocks and a bullish options market.\n\n\"The buying that went on in August and September is a 10-year phenomenon the likes of which we have never seen, among millennials and in the risk-taking among people that don't want to own bonds and want to own overpriced U.S. quality businesses, it is of record proportions,\" Smead told CNBC's \"Squawk Box Europe\" on Thursday.\n\nHe added that current valuations were an example of \"stock market failure\" driven by millennials speculating in the stock market for the first time. Smead projected that markets could be in for a nosedive since despite its monetary policy shoring up credit markets, the Federal Reserve \"can't save a stock market.\"\n\n\"They are buying bullish call options that expire inside two weeks. There was ($500 billion) of bullish call options bought in a four-week stretch by small retail traders,\" Smead said.\n\nA call option is a contract between the buyer and seller of the call to exchange a security, in this case a stock, at an agreed price.\n\n\"In '99 it was $100 billion, in '07, it was $100 billion. That is what young, dumb investors are doing and when the market makers see those (call buying) out there, they sell that call to that person and they buy the stock,\" Smead added.\n\nHe suggested that the willingness of wealthy investors and the baby boomer generation to \"ride the index to a fault\" and overpay for stalwart American businesses such as Costco and Microsoft was also detrimental.\n\n\"Microsoft is a wonderful company, but at 40 times earnings, there is a 0% chance of that producing wealth for someone over the next 10 years that will meet their needs.\"\n\nDespite a sharp tech sell-off in early September, Microsoft shares remain 40% higher since the turn of the year, while fellow tech titans Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Facebook and Netflix have all been on a tear since March's crash.\n\n[Source](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/15/smead-nightmare-us-stock-valuations-driven-by-young-dumb-investors.html)",

I don\u2019t know that you can bet on tripling your investment, but I feel safe assuming that it\u2019ll grow considerably given that many people\u2019s current cost basis is based on the fire sale that the COVID recession brought at the beginning. And really the market is doing so bad right now because COVID cases are rising because it\u2019s winter, but once it starts to heat up and COVID cases aren\u2019t spiking the way they currently are I\u2019m sure the market will regain some territory - or at least not be pinned down the way it currently is. And it seems like his assessment was generally a response to the conventional advice that you can guarantee returns by investing in an index fund that follows the S&amp;P 500 or investing in the big tech companies (and there is definitely a concern that they could be harmed by anti-trust suits). But I think it depends on what you\u2019re investing in. Like if you\u2019re in airlines they\u2019re directly affected, probably more than any other industry, by COVID restrictions. Their earnings have been shit because of it and once people aren\u2019t afraid to travel I just don\u2019t see how their earnings and then share value don\u2019t go up. If you wanted to hedge against the sort of losses he talks about I would probably sell once they start announcing vaccines coming out because I\u2019d be surprised if the market didn\u2019t drive prices up with their optimism that that means everything is going back to normal. On top of that, when he says that the market in 2012 still wasn\u2019t above its 2000 peak it\u2019s a bit disingenuous because when you look at the S&amp;P over the past 20 years he\u2019s right, but 2000 was a peak (at about 1491), then after a dip, the market went to a high of about 1535 in 2007, then the market crashed in 08 and started recovering and he just picked an arbitrary point in that recovery that proved his point but which became irrelevant the very next year, in 2013, when the market DID exceed 2000 levels and then boomed over the next 7 years to more than double what it was in 2000 or 2006. \n\nRegarding what he said about big tech companies, yeah I would probably stay out of tech. Those companies already have such a high share price that I\u2019ve always been skeptical of jumping in anyway. He also says globalization is in retreat, and I think that\u2019s a bit of a hasty conclusion. I think we\u2019re definitely at a crossroads where we\u2019re trying to determine if we\u2019re going to dive headfirst into a more globalist orientation or retreat and be more isolationist, but I\u2019m skeptical that in the longer term we aren\u2019t going to be more globalist in orientation. But I do think we\u2019re in for a bit of identity seeking as it pertains to whether we\u2019re going to be more globalist or isolationist, because if you recall TPP had pretty steep opposition on both sides of the aisle - but not so much that Obama wasn\u2019t willing to pursue it. And I think the luster of isolationism has probably been tarnished a bit by Trump. Though globalism is really one of those things, just like anti-racism and shit like that, where this election seems to sort of serve as a referendum on it. Trump is certainly not a fan of globalism, but Biden seems at least more globally oriented and has at least in some cases shown an inclination towards reviving Obama-era policies that Trump dismantled because Biden was part of the Obama era so his legacy is sorta tied up in that as well, and one of those policies was TPP. As far as workers demanding a fairer split of capitalism, that\u2019s fair. I do anticipate things like wage hikes, but that could also result in people spending more because they have more (i.e. Keynesianism). I also think it\u2019s a fair point about the aging demographics thing. It makes sense that boomers would want to divest themselves of riskier stocks and people just haven\u2019t been having kids as much as they used to, so the working-age population is surely going to feel that bite at some point (though I\u2019m not sure when). However, the US has long been an exception to the rule of shitty population growth rates in the west. In general, we don\u2019t have a ton of kids, but where we have historically differed is that we attract a lot of immigrants so our population grows that way - and Biden has already stated that he\u2019s going to be reversing some of Trump\u2019s immigration policies.",

        "selftext": "Hi, fairly seasoned investor here. I've done fairly well this year (up roughly 55% YTD and actively managing my portfolio daily). Honestly, I'm a bit bewildered by all the love for tech that still exists here. To me, it's pretty obvious that from here on out, the next 40-50% gains will come from the recovery stocks, not tech. \n\nWhat do I mean by recovery stocks? Retail, commercial real estate, airlines, casinos, cruise lines, financials.\n\nWhy? Allow me to borrow a couple minutes of your time.\n\n**Vaccine vaccine vaccine.** There is a widespread belief, which I agree with, that we will not have an approved vaccine available for the public to use until early next year. However, that is a dumb reason to not buy recovery stocks. The question you should be asking is: will we know that one of the many vaccines that are out there is effective and safe by the end of this year? Once we have a vaccine candidate that we know is effective and is safe, then the game is over. It does not matter if that vaccine won't be approved for a few weeks after, or won't be available for widespread use for a few months. The market looks forward. Once it becomes clear that a vaccine is ready and is coming sometime within the next 6 months, the recovery stocks will boom. \n\nSo, when will we know? Pfizer has said that they should know by the end of October whether a vaccine is effective, and will release some data around then. If their Phase 3 data is positive, then I expect a huge rally in the recovery stocks. I expect their phase 3 data to be positive, given the positive phase 1/2 data, the cloaked positive comments in the press by Pfizer execs, and my belief in mRNA's potential.\n\n**Ok well even if we get a vaccine approved we don't know if people will even take it, right?**. Of course they will. Sure, there will likely be only a small cohort of brave souls initially who take it, but once they take it and find it effective and low on side effects, they will tell their circle of friends/family, some of whom will then take it themselves, and then tell their circle, etc. etc. People want someone else to be one of the first to take it, but like with many things, once they hear it recommended from their friends who took it, they will themselves take it. Also, let's not forget that we won't need 100% vaccination rate for things to get back to mostly normal, and a lot of activities that were previously restricted (like international travel) will likely be available again only to vaccinated folks, which will further boost vaccination rates and create a self-reinforcing cycle.\n\n**Ok but things will never fully return back to the way things were, right?** Probably not 100%, but I think 80%, yes, and much more quickly than you think. There is so much fearful talk of remote work being the way forward, and that no one wants offices anymore, and why would you ever travel for business again. I think this is all blown WAY out of proportion. For God's sakes guys, this is the way we've been doing things for many decades. People's habits won't just change on a dime like that because of a 9-12 month situation that is temporary. People will still want to see each other face to face, people will still go to offices, etc. I mean, I work remotely for my job, and it sucks. Meetings are confusing, I find myself procrastinating and not being nearly as efficient/productive as I was when I was in an office, team cohesion is down. Many employers do not like remote work because productivity is decreased significantly, and it's employers who will set the policy. Now, sure, maybe we have more remote work than we did before. Maybe it's an option for some people, maybe you work 1-2 days remotely per week or something, fine. But I don't think this justifies a 300-600% run up in some of these work from home stocks, and I expect to see those absolutely crater once we have a vaccine.\n\n**Ok, but the stock prices of these recovery stocks won't return to normal for quite a while, right?** Not only will they, but they'll surpass their previous pre-covid levels. Why? The Fed, and short covering. The Fed has inflated the prices of all the 'hot' stocks. PTON, ZM, FSLY, etc. all have had huge run ups because tech was hot, and people had a lot of money to invest. Once the recovery stocks are hot, they will be inflated too. The Fed has committed to keeping rates low for at least another couple years (due to wanting inflation pegged at 2%), so rates will be low even after we have a vaccine. Short interest in some of the recovery names are also quite high, so short covering will drive these stocks even higher than you'd expect.\n\n**Ok, but, a second wave is coming, right?** Probably, but a second wave at this point should mean nothing to recovery stocks. It's all about the vaccine. If a vaccine is shown to be effective in November, but we get hit with a second wave in December, who cares? Yes maybe these companies will have 1-2 months of pain, but again, the market looks way forward, and once you have a vaccine, the light at the end of the tunnel will be blaring, and you'll ignore the bumps on the way.\n\n**Ok, so why not just buy the recovery stocks when/if they come out with positive data?** Yeah, you could I guess, if you're a very risk averse investor or not totally convinced. However, I would not be surprised to see some of the more hard hit recovery stocks up by 15-20% after positive vaccine data (for example, ALK was \\~$65 pre-covid, but is now at \\~$38. If a vaccine is shown to be effective tomorrow let's say, I don't think it'd be unreasonable to see that stock shoot up to $44 pre-market). Even then I'd still expect more upside though, so I'd be a buyer there. However, I'd personally prefer to cash in on those 15-20% gains as well as the future upside, which is why I'm a buyer here.\n\n**Ok, well, what are the risks?** The risks are mainly around a covid vaccine not being effective or being unsafe. If that happens, then recovery stocks will take a serious beating. You also may see some short term pain if covid cases jump before vaccine data is released, as some folks/algos in the market take that as meaning 'sell recovery, buy tech'. Also, make sure you buy companies with very strong balance sheets, as if there are any unexpected bumps in the road with a vaccine, you don't want to be stuck with a company you're worried about going bankrupt.\n\n**I would really really appreciate feedback on this.** I'm investing a lot of money in these stocks, and am by no means blind to the risks. I would really love hearing from everyone here about the things I missed or am not considering. If you have something I'm missing, and can potentially save me many many thousands of dollars, please please take a few minutes and just share that comment here. Thanks for your time reading this!",

Shares dropped to less than $49 in after-hours action immediately following the report, after closing the regular session with a 0.8% gain at $53.90.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The chip maker reported third-quarter net income of $4.3 billion, or $1.02 a share, down more than 28% from $5.99 billion, or $1.35 a share, in the year-ago period.

        "selftext": "**Before dismissing this due to the many posts about this in the past month, I strongly suggest taking the time to read this if you have incurred losses above the premium paid on expired Robinhood spreads. Yea yea, I get it that we should have closed the spreads instead of letting them expire, lesson learned. But there's a lot more to the story that shows Robinhood was clearly in violation of FINRA regulations and FINRA is in fact currently launching an investigation into Robinhood on my behalf.**\n\nI personally was impacted by this when I lost $54,000 from 9/4 TSLA Put Debit Spreads that I paid a total premium of $300 for. The 9/4 put debit spreads that I owned had expired on 9/4 when they were OTM, but due to the news about TSLA not being included in the S&amp;P after hours on 9/4, the stock price dropped significantly and the spreads became ITM after hours. I was assigned 1000 shares of TSLA at $400/share on $400,000 worth of margin. Robinhood liquidated the shares at a price of \\~$346 on Tuesday 9/8. I had only invested $23,000 of my own money and specifically had Margin Investing disabled on my account.\n\nI\u2019ve seen many comments from other Robinhood users who were impacted and who essentially chalked it up to an expensive learning lesson, but there are a number of reasons why I strongly believe there is a compelling case to be made for restitution due to what I consider to be Robinhood\u2019s misconduct and gross negligence on the matter. I\u2019m currently in communication with a few Stockbroker Fraud Lawyers who are very interested in the case and willing to take it on a contingency basis (i.e. they only get paid if we are awarded restitution).\n\nHere are some of the key points of the case:\n\n* **Robinhood's website explicitly stated \u201cYou\u2019ll** ***NEVER*** **lose more than the premium you paid to enter the put debit spread.\"**  \n\n   * I have the evidence proving this as I printed a copy of this Robinhood webpage on Tuesday 9/8, and Robinhood took down this specific webpage on Thursday 9/10. The fact that they took this webpage down to me is a clear admission of liability due to their inaccurate representation of risk.\n   * Robinhood (and all stockbrokers) have a responsibility to accurately convey information and risk levels to their customers, especially Robinhood in this case since their target demographic is retail investors with limited investing experience. The fact that they inaccurately portrayed the level of risk to their investors is in my opinion a violation of FINRA rule \u201c2210. Communications with the Public\u201d. In fact, I\u2019ve already been in communication with FINRA and they are launching an investigation into Robinhood on my behalf.\n* **Margin Investing was specifically disabled on my account**\n* **Robinhood has no mechanism for exercising my long puts even if I wanted to. The spreads showed as expired in the application, and it is impossible to get in touch with live Robinhood support.**  \n\n   * If you try to call Robinhood, you will get an automated message telling you to submit a ticket. I submitted two support tickets and messaged Robinhood on Twitter multiple times over the long Labor Day weekend, but did not get a response until Tuesday 9/8 around 8:00PM, after all of the damage had already been done.\n   * Their lack of customer support is even more egregious (potentially constituting gross negligence) when considering the extremely unfortunate story of the 20 year old who took his life for almost the same exact situation as described here. It had been about 2 months since that occurred, and Robinhood had done nothing to improve the way they displayed information or to provide customer support for emergency situations. It\u2019s worth noting that my account was showing -$800,000 buying power.\n* **Robinhood specifically told me that I had until Friday 9/11 to raise enough capital to pay off my margin call, but they automatically liquidated the shares Tuesday 9/8 for a significant loss. They also liquidated all of my other options that were later worth an extra \\~$20,000 from what they sold them for.**\n\nPlease be aware that there is a 6 year statute for claiming restitution, so this may still apply to you if you had a similar experience with Robinhood aside from the exact situation described in this post. If you had a similar experience and are looking for restitution, please DM me and we can exchange contact details to discuss further.",

Dr. Sean Conley, the president's physician, says that President Trump received an experimental drug made by Regeneron, which contains two antibodies against the coronavirus. \nThe medicine is currently in clinical trials and isn't approved by the Food and Drug and Administration. How the president's medical team got the medicine wasn't disclosed in the statement. \nIn response to NPR's query, Regeneron declined to comment specifically, citing patient confidentiality. But Regeneron said it can make the drug available outside a clinical trial through a \"compassionate use program,\" subject to the OK of a review committee. \nThe drug, called REGN-COV2, is given as a single dose by injection (an infusion). The president received the high dose being tested by the company \u2013 8 grams.\u201d",

        "selftext": "Just a quick estimate: the last two console cycles GME's market cap was 9.7bn and 6.6bn. If we go with a conservative 3bn target with 65m shares outstanding that would be a 46$ price target. 2019 revenue was 6bn already. Now take into the account the bubbly nature of today's account and the fact that Tesla's 2019 revenue was just 4x of Gamestop's (yes, that's right, 24bn vs 6bn) we have a pretty (realistically) optimistic thesis\n\nNow, I would argue that this console cycle could be even better for the company than any of the last two: \n\n* New management trying to turn the company around + Ryan Cohen who turned *dog food company* into a multibillion business\n* Gaming is going to only increase in popularity\n* Despite bearish arguments, GameStop actively tries to get into digital. Part of everything a person spends digitally on an xbox sold at GameStop goes to the company. I think that is a huge additional revenue stream.\n* CDs are declining only in a percentage of total sales compared to digital, but absolute numbers are not decreasing. I saw a data on that somewhere but am too lazy now to search for it so treat it as my personal opinion\n* (if you like crayons) GME formed two perfect cup&amp;handle patterns: on 1month and 1hr charts\n* If that was not enough there might be countless wildcard events: Sony sharing digital revenue (not that much of a stretch), any other partnership with major gaming entities, share buybacks (was in the past so not off the table), some new investors, or any of the ideas they come up to let GameStop live and prosper\n\n\nNow if we speculate that GameStop's market cap would only be 9bn (was one cycle ago) we have a share price of 138$ per share.\n\nThe short squeeze is just a cherry on top of that, propelling the price up faster and higher. But we can also play that. The new short interest data comes out on Oct 26th, so we'll have a more clear picture of what is happening on the short side.

Usually, it's used to easily dismiss someone else's well-crafted DD, however today let's use it to actually do something useful with it. Let's find out, how much growth is priced in in the current price of Zoom and Tesla. As a comparison I also included Microsoft and P&amp;G.\n\nNow follows the detailed description of how I calculated that. If you are only interested in the results, scroll to the bottom.\n\nHow would you even calculate something like that? I will do it with the so-called [Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discounted_cash_flow). The intuition behind it is that by buying stock you essentially lose out on the returns the cash you used to buy the stock could yield somewhere else, like if you invested it in bonds or an S&amp;P 500 ETF (or of course in FDs, whatever floats your boat). So, this model takes this into account by treating the cash you pay today (or more accurately, its current market cap) as a discounted cash flow of the future returns.\n\nTo be able to use this model, we need to make several assumptions. First, we need to decide on a time-frame in which we expected the company to completely earn its current valuation. I will use 10 years here as a very generous value.\n\nSecond, we need to decide what the cash flow actually will be. For this very simplified application of the DCF model I used the Net Income of the last quarter. I will call this N. In the end we want to have a growth rate as a result which tells us how much the quarterly earnings will need to increase every quarter to earn its entire valuation in the given time-frame. I will call this q.\n\nTo account for the equity a company already has, its current equity E must also be included in its future returns. Again, as a very generous estimation, I will assume that the equity will appreciate like the average returns of the S&amp;P 500 in the last 10 years which is 16.3%.\n\nFinally we need wee need the discounted cash value. This is the current market cap M of the company. We also need to decide on an interest rate to discount M. Again, very generously, instead of assuming that M should also be assumed to have the average S&amp;P 500 returns, we will instead only use the much lower, essentially risk-free returns of the 10Y US bonds, which currently is 0.75%.\n\nTo summarize, we made the following assumptions:\n\n* Time frame of 10 years\n* Equity E appreciates by average S&amp;P 500 returns of 16.3% every year\n* Cash flow is given by the net quarterly income N\n* Current market cap M is discounted by 10Y US bond yield, which is 0.75%\n\nNow, we can formulate the following equation that puts the expected growth of N into relation with the other variables:\n\n    E * 1.163^10 + N * (q^(4 * 10) - 1) / (q - 1) = M * 1.0075^10\n\n(Equity in 10 years plus quarterly earnings of the next 10 years that grow by q every quarter must equal discounted market cap )\n\nNow we only need to select a company and solve the equation for q. This can be done by using approximation methods like Newton's method, or just plug it into Wolfram Alpha.\n\nAs mentioned in the title, let's first start with Zoom and Tesla. All values are in Million USD:\n\n##Zoom:\n\n    E = 1198.81\n    N = 185.99\n    M = 160400\n\nThis gives us q = 1.12575 as a result. So, for Zoom, its current market cap has a yearly growth of q^4 - 1 = 60.61% priced in *for every year in the next 10 years*. Note that this already includes the Q2 earnings which were almost 7 times higher than Q1 earnings.\n\n##Tesla:\n\n    E = 9855\n    N = 11202\n    M = 1658500\n\nThis results in q = 1.17685. So, for Tesla, its current market cap has a even larger yearly growth of q^4 - 1 = 91.82% priced in *for every year in the next 10 years*.\n\n##Microsoft and P&amp;G:\n\nFor comparison, let's also calculate this for less meme-y stocks. I chose Microsoft and P&amp;G, let me know if you want to know the results for other stocks.\n\nMicrosoft:\n\n    E = 118304\n    N = 11202\n    M = 1658500\n    =&gt; q = 1.04679\n    =&gt; q^4 - 1 = 20.07%\n\nP&amp;G:\n\n    E = 46521\n    N = 2800\n    M = 358600\n    =&gt; q = 1.02179\n    =&gt; q^4 - 1 = 9.01%\n\n\nDisclaimer: This is a very simplified calculation which makes many assumptions: We only look at a companies net income of the last quarter, its current equity and its market cap, nothing else. Also, this looks at a rather large time-frame of 10 years, so is not that useful for short-term stock price predictions.\n\nTo summarize: By using the DCF model we can calculate that Zoom and Tesla have priced in into their current market cap outrageously high growth rates already for the next 10 years. Around 60% and 90%, respectively.\n\nPositions: [ZM](https://i.imgur.com/Rae9FzS.png), [TSLA](https://i.imgur.com/ybVcZ1M.png)",

        "selftext": "**TL;DR** While no one knows what future generations of science will hold, I will say with certainty that companies peddling green energy products are in situation closely akin to the Dot Com Bubble.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFirst, all of the electric vehicle stocks are massively overvalued at the moment. A brief list:\n\n[Tesla\u2019s](https://www.bing.com/search?q=tesla+stock&amp;qs=HS&amp;pq=tesla&amp;sc=6-5&amp;cvid=644717105441413197B46E27908A7CB9&amp;FORM=QBRE&amp;sp=1) PE Ratio is 1,170 in spite crashing recently. The average PE is around 18, and Tesla has gained the largest market cap of any auto maker in history, in spite only accounting for around 1.5% of all vehicle sales. As awesome as their team has proven over the years, there\u2019s no way they could meet the market\u2019s expectations anytime this decade.\n\n[NIO](https://www.bing.com/search?q=nio%20stock&amp;qs=n&amp;form=QBRE&amp;sp=-1&amp;pq=nio%20stock&amp;sc=7-9&amp;sk=&amp;cvid=BA8D2A8B783F46319BE31B9956890EC8) is a Chinese electric car company. Note Chinese consumers are mostly poor and overwhelmingly prefer small personal transportation like scooters, motorbikes, ebikes. They have been losing money but that doesn\u2019t stop their price from rising over 1,200% in the past year.\n\n[Nikola](https://www.bing.com/search?q=nikola+stock&amp;qs=LS&amp;pq=nikola+stock&amp;sc=6-12&amp;cvid=DC098EE074A6496FACCDC7B02BFDCE2E&amp;FORM=QBRE&amp;sp=1) is trading below its IPO price being more and more revealed as a scam. They claim to have designed their own working truck, but all they have is CGI mockups and a faked video where they rolled the truck down the hill. Engineers have debunked a lot of the claims their founder Trevor Milton made, but in short he claims his stuff does literally double of everything Tesla does in spite having no product or design team or history of the long process of creating that. Plus Trevor Milton resigned in the face of lawsuits and investigations pending. And in spite Nikola itself saying they were \u201chighly dependent on their founder\u201d Trevor Milton, they are still on Robinhood\u2019s **100 Most Popular list!**\n\n[Arcimoto](https://www.bing.com/search?q=Arcimoto%20stock&amp;qs=n&amp;form=QBRE&amp;sp=-1&amp;pq=arcimoto%20stock&amp;sc=6-14&amp;sk=&amp;cvid=8AB657D7B3D54A39BCE0C00777388A79) is a small company with 95 employees that makes small electric utility vehicles. They\u2019ve only been selling cars for a year, they\u2019re losing money, but they still have a market cap of 195 million.\n\n[Aryo](https://www.bing.com/search?q=ayro%20stock&amp;qs=n&amp;form=QBRE&amp;sp=-1&amp;pq=ayro%20stock&amp;sc=6-10&amp;sk=&amp;cvid=C1CACD62DB384890B47989F02C5D2698) is an engineering sub-contractor specializing in EV. They have six employees, a revenue of zero the last two years, and a market cap of 68 million.\n\nThe trend extends to related industries, with nickel and lithium stocks rising alongside anticipation of contracts from EV companies (with disappointingly meager results). And consider that as large a market cap these companies have, they also compete with older motor companies that are making their own EV and hybrid vehicles. On the wind and solar side, they have seen similar growth over the same time period, which is even more telling.\n\n[SolarEdge](https://www.bing.com/search?q=SolarEdge%20stock&amp;qs=n&amp;form=QBRE&amp;sp=-1&amp;pq=solaredge%20stock&amp;sc=7-15&amp;sk=&amp;cvid=881BEB5EA020452D8737355C25F7693B), an Israeli innovation company, has risen over 200% in the last year and has a PE of 74.\n\n[Vivent Solar](https://www.bing.com/search?q=Vivent%20Solar%20%20stock&amp;qs=n&amp;form=QBRE&amp;sp=-1&amp;pq=vivent%20solar%20stock&amp;sc=6-18&amp;sk=&amp;cvid=EF6DB7BE434F4EFB9F3542386CA62018) has risen over 550% in a year, have under three thousand employees, are going into big debt with their investment, and have a market cap of 5.29 billion.\n\n[Vestas Wind Systems](https://www.bing.com/search?q=Vestas%20Wind%20Systems%20%20stock&amp;qs=n&amp;form=QBRE&amp;sp=-1&amp;pq=vestas%20wind%20systems%20stock&amp;sc=7-25&amp;sk=&amp;cvid=D635DB0D4724467F9663C497DBAFF96B) has risen by 118% over the last year, has a PE of 57, a market cap of 32 billion, and only 25,541 employees.\n\nNote these are *utilities companies*, that have years long installation and maintenance contracts with cities who go into decades of debt to install these services. To show how slow the industry moves, my hometown still has a working coal power plant that was built in the late 1920\u2019s. Sure there\u2019s new windfarms being built, but this stuff was built to last and it costs a fraction as much to overhaul old stuff than buy new. Ergo the old stuff goes offline slowly, and new investments are made.\n\nThis means the rise of the wind and solar industry is **solely due to** **investor sentiment**, not the growth of the industry itself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen science itself comes in.\n\nIn strictly performance and economic terms, gas is fundamentally better than renewables. [The main issue](https://youtu.be/Hatav_Rdnno) comes down to energy storage: A gallon of gas contains 13 times more energy by volume than the best lithium ion batteries Tesla has to offer. That same gas has 50 times more energy by weight than lithium ion batteries. Plus, gasoline just goes into a tank and sits there, while batteries are broken into many cells with connective wires and packaging that aren\u2019t space or weight efficient. Tackling this problem has been Tesla\u2019s greatest hurdle, as they\u2019ve had issue with [new batteries randomly exploding.](https://www.popularmechanics.com/cars/hybrid-electric/a28687473/tesla-model-3-explosion/)\n\nOn top of that, electric motors offer a lot less horsepower for a given weight than a gas motor, along with a much lower top speed. Electric motors do offer instant torque, less maintenance requirements, and don\u2019t need to idle, but that means little to the average consumer. Altogether with current tech an EV user would be limited in the range, weight, and speed he can move things. Where I live I don\u2019t even have the garage to charge an EV in nor are there charging stations anywhere within 80 miles, and many people live likewise.\n\nThis is also why you don\u2019t see many electric airplanes. The range, speed, and payload are extremely limited.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOf course, you say \u201cBut the science is moving forward, and we\u2019re investing it that.\u201d Two problems:\n\nGas motor tech is also advancing as companies find ways to improve efficiency and reduce emissions. Of course they are, because not only is it a very good thing to do\u2026 It is a very Profitable thing to do. And why are we complaining when they raise efficiency on the type of vehicle that +95% of people drive?\n\nNext problem is that scientific progress is measured in decades and generations, not months and years. For instance, [projections](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/technology/weve-long-waited-for-fusion-this-reactor-may-finally-deliver-it-fast/ar-BB19A6Xq) have put us 20 years away from fusion power\u2026 ever since the 1960\u2019s. Much progress has been made, like using giant magnets to force atoms together or complex math to compensate for instability issues, but they still only making marginal improvements when the problem is no one can make self-sustaining fusion. Fusion requires isotopes of hydrogen, the lightest gas in existence. Fusion requires ludicrously high temperatures and/or pressures to work. Fusion creates a nuclear flash. None of the above cooperate with each other at all.\n\nIn the case of solar panels, each decade has seen measurable improvement, but the base issues that were there over a century ago when it was just a laboratory novelty still exist. Namely, finite energy from sunlight even if they were 100% efficient (they aren\u2019t), and the fact each panel is a significant investment. Current research revolves around solving [mystery wear and tear](https://phys.org/news/2019-06-solar-cell-defect-mystery-decades.html) that makes panels lose productivity and also making the panels self-cooling so they don\u2019t lose efficiency at high temperatures. But still, the up-front costs are debilitating by any measure.\n\nSo not only has the market priced in a revolution in the car industry, it has priced in major revolutionary advances in science that can\u2019t happen anytime soon. I can\u2019t predict the future, maybe in 50 years new energy storage devises will hit the market using a currently unknown caveat of quantum physics.\n\nBut current scientific research reflects what will hit the market in 10-30 years. I mean it, even in military projects it takes that long for something to go from a concept to a weapon. Case in point, according to Ben Rich from Lockheed\u2019s Skunk Works, the experimental concepts of radar absorbing paint and a radar resistant shape of aircraft were known back in the 1960\u2019s. His book detailed some of the immense list of tricky technical issues involved in making an actual stealth plane, however.\n\nWhat generates this bubble? Look at 5 year charts of these stocks and you\u2019ll see the pattern. The started going up last winter, dipped with the Coronavirus crash, and then immediately soared. I ask Why?\n\n1. [Essentials.](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/16/focus-on-essential-companies-that-can-get-through-to-the-other-side-jim-cramer-says.html) Institutional investors are looking for high growth stocks safe from Covid induced bankruptcy.\n\n2. [Autists.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/sergeiklebnikov/2020/08/17/robinhood-valuation-soars-to-112-billion-with-new-funding-and-record-growth/#282f7699663d) Discount brokers, from Webull to TastyTrade to ThinkorSwim to Interactive Brokers, all have grown a lot, especially in the last year with quarantined and bored people looking for a way to make some money. Even r/wallstreetbets have seen their membership rise significantly over this period. Nothing wrong with that, but what do all these inexperienced investors consider good growth positions in ethical industries? That\u2019s right, tech stocks and renewables, and the average number of stocks held is two per account. In some circles I follow, I\u2019ve had to explain that day to day changes in the market price does not always reflect the business itself. And I\u2019ve literally seen this question: \u201cWhich should I invest in, Tesla or Apple?\u201d (FACEPALM)\n\n3. [Hedge Funds.](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hedge-fund-darlings-vs-tesla-204030211.html) These guys seek out high risk high reward schemes, and it is known that several capitalized in Tesla\u2019s meteoric rise and were among the first to bug out. While it varies wildly how these guys make money, the high volumes surrounding the \u201cmeme stocks\u201d would present them with many opportunities.\n\n4. [Venture capitalists.](https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-is-a-billionaire-who-doesnt-care-about-money-2020-5) Rich people are no different, and several corporate heads in renewables said they were more concerned about science than making money. Nothing wrong with that, but you see where the market has gone with this?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut not all hope is lost for those of you who want to invest in renewables; Nuclear energy is seriously undervalued! Again, this is due to public perception effecting investments, and not the science itself. Progress continued to be made in the science even after Chernobyl caused the total halt of reactor construction, and now as old reactors start going offline and new reactors are cheaper, safer, and come in conveniently smaller packages they look more tempting than ever.\n\nNamely, Microsoft and General Electric are partnering to make [NuScale](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200828005299/en/NuScale-Power-History-Small-Modular-Reactor-Receive), a small modular nuclear reactor that can be produced in bulk, shipped as one piece on a semi, installed into bunkers with a crane, and integrated with as many other reactors as you want. The streamlined process brings costs down, and the small size allows for small remote installations to cut their overhead power costs to near zero. So far, only the Pentagon is buying, but it is also just passed a rigorous certification process last week.\n\nAlso, [thorium nuclear reactors](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/could-thorium-revive-the-nuclear-energy-industry-1029624977) are becoming a thing. These are a lot less energy efficient, but physically can\u2019t break down in a lot of the ways uranium plants have historically (I.E. coolant leaks). Technical hurdles remain, but this has been in the works since the 1980\u2019s and only slowly has it been getting attention.\n\nAnd yes, nuclear is definitely a great option. From the perspective of energy density, kw per dollar, initial installation costs, and manning costs nukes lead all others by a ridiculously large margin. In fact, one of the biggest costs are actually the extreme safety and security requirements. And used parts have to be disposed of in lead containers and buried deep in a remote desert.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn my autist opinion, I give an emphatic sell recommendation to the whole renewable industry.\n\nDo I recommend dropping everything and going into nuclear? No, I\u2019m saying the damage is done with this human error. Someone has already bought at the top, and when the selling starts someone will lose money. This doesn\u2019t mean renewables are doomed, either. Recall that Apple, Microsoft, and Amazon all weathered the Dot Com Bubble, because the bottom line is the stock market DOES NOT REFLECT THE ECONOMY, it reflects investor confidence.",

This whole time I was investing my money into a crytocurrency which has been quite stable for some time. I ended up making a stupid mistake one day when I sent my funds from my cold wallet to binance. I figured I could make a quick buck, and I did in a matter of 2 days I had made 5k profit. I sent funds back and I should have left it at that. But stupid me I attempted to try again. Well bad trades started happening and I kept thinking I could make it back. Slowly but surely I get down to my last 10k. I ended up making a very bold move and sent it all to my futures account. Two days later bitcoin takes a big dip and I am almost liquidated. I\u2019m currently sitting at 1k. I want to freaking die. It\u2019s a hard pill to swallow and I know I did it to myself. I could\u2019ve really done a lot with that money but I threw it all away.

        "selftext": "\"**Property prices have risen across the US during the pandemic and, contrary to popular perception, they have risen in each of rural, suburban, AND urban areas**. Despite widely reported speculation about a collapse in demand for urban living (likely spurred by the outsized attention given to New York City and San Francisco), our data suggests that people left urban areas, but at a more modest pace than media reports might suggest.\"\n\n\"**COVID-19 has not caused people\u2019s housing preferences to permanently shift away from the amenities of urban living**. Density aversion is leading to some declines in the biggest cities. But price changes during COVID-19 suggest that people are still willing to pay for urban amenities, placing value on access to restaurants, bars, and cultural institutions found in denser cities \u2013 they will just need to find places where they are less impaired by social distancing rules.\"\n\n\"**We do see more risk of cities underperforming suburbs, a contrast to many years when home price increases in urban areas significantly outpaced those in suburban or rural areas**. While prices are likely to rise all over, urban areas are at risk of losing their long stretch of outperformance over suburbs. More working from home (WFH) in the future, risks around COVID-related closures of urban amenities, and potentially lingering aversion to density are likely to give the suburbs a relative edge in the future, even as both places rise in absolute terms. This could create an incremental demand bump of up to 500,000 new housing units in the US if up to 2% of people permanently relocate out of urban areas.\"\n\n\"**Of the biggest cities in the US, only New York and San Francisco have seen average price declines during the pandemic**. Most urban areas in the US have benefitted from the same pent-up demand and increase in affordability that has lifted suburbs. And while we would not dismiss the tail risk of a self-reinforcing cycle of falling home prices for New York City or San Francisco, it remains a tail.\"\n\n\"**We expect the trend of rising home prices in both cities and suburbs to persist even after the pandemic ends, because affordability has improved and should remain elevated for some time**. The collapse in long-term interest rates made mortgages more affordable at the same time that household savings soared as a result of lockdowns and government largesse. Moreover, millennials have reached their peak marriage years, so are entering their peak years for home buying. These should provide a tailwind for both suburban and urban properties.\"\n\n\"**Multifamily rentals are the most challenged corner of the residential market, with rents at risk due to a potentially \u201cK-shaped\u201d recovery (where higher income workers experience a rebound, but lower income worker remain strained)**. If lower-wage jobs take a long time to reappear, or don\u2019t reappear at all in the places they were before, rents could take a material hit.\"\n\n\"**In contrast, Single-Family Rental (SFR) appears poised to benefit from the same economic recovery.** SFR customers have similar wealth to home buyers, so they are less likely to face the pressures of multi-family assets. And because their assets gain in value as home prices rise, they should perform well in a general regime of rising prices.\"\n\n\"**In the UK, trends have been similar to the US, but with perhaps a relatively bigger shift of interest to the suburbs.** The risks are slightly different, however, as housing assets are more exposed to government policy shifts.\"\n\n\"**In China, there is a growing desire for better housing and better living conditions after COVID-19.** Flexible work arrangement and hygiene awareness have caused local residents to look for better housing, more bedrooms, and second homes.\"\n\n\"**Student enrollment is falling in the US, creating a risk for security-backed student housing.** However, initial trends are promising and moves to reduce density could offset any reductions in enrollment. In the UK, enrollment trends are the opposite \u2013 rising as is typical of recessions.\"",

        "selftext": "Tuesday is the day. After many months of investor buildup, Apple is finally about to unveil the first generation of 5G iPhones, which likely will be called iPhone 12.\n\nThe details have been widely leaked. Apple \ufffc (ticker: AAPL) is expected to unveil four models. Here\u2019s how Raymond James analyst Chris Caso laid it out in a research note last month:\n\n\u2022 iPhone 12, with a 5.4-inch screen, priced at $699\n\n\u2022 iPhone 12 Max, with a 6.1-inch screen, priced at $799\n\n\u2022 iPhone 12 Pro, also with a 6.1-inch screen, plus higher end cameras, priced at $999\n\n\u2022 iPhone 12 Pro Max, with a 6.6-inch screen, priced at $1,099\n\nThere is also some speculation about new Apple-branded over-the-ear headphones called AirPods Studio, and perhaps a new product for tracking things with Bluetooth called AirTags. But there\u2019s no question that this event is all about the iPhone, and the expectations are sky high.\n\nWedbush analyst Daniel Ives writes this morning that this will be the most important Apple iPhone product cycle since the iPhone 6 in 2014. That time, Apple finally moved beyond 4-inch displays\u2014the iPhone 6 was 4.7 inches and the beloved iPhone 6s a whopping 5.5 inches.\n\nAll of the new phones will run on 5G networks. (No coincidence that the tag line for the event is \u201cHi, Speed.\u201d) Ives notes that the Pro versions are expected to have Lidar sensor technology, useful for augmented reality applications, as well as enhanced rear-camera technology. Ives expects preorders to kick off in a few weeks, with two of the models shipping later this month and the other two in mid-to-late November.\n\nIves says the U.S. version of the phones will be capable of accessing speedy millimeter wave version of 5G, which he thinks \u201ccould be a game changer looking ahead as more infrastructure, technology and apps are built around this transformational 5G highway over the coming years.\u201d\n\nIves is particular bullish on the prospect for the new phones in China\u2014he thinks the country will account for 20% of upgrades over the coming year.\n\n\u201cWith 5G now in the cards and roughly 40% of [the]...iPhone installed base not upgrading their phones in the last 3.5 years, [Apple CEO Tim] Cook &amp; Co. have the stage set for a supercycle 5G product release, which should drive shares further,\u201d he writes. \u201cAlthough the soft macro and Covid backdrop will clearly dent some demand, we believe the underlying growth drivers for iPhone 12 success are unparalleled for Cupertino.\u201d\n\nIves maintains his Outperform rating and $150 price target.\n\nMeanwhile, RBC Capital analyst Robert Muller on Monday repeated his Outperform rating, while lifting his price target on Apple stock to $132 from $111. Muller writes that he thinks the new iPhone lineup will \u201ckick off a significant replacement cycle which we believe will be a multiyear process as new applications and spectrum become available over time.\u201d\n\nMuller is also bullish about Apple\u2019s push into the fitness category with the pending launch of the Fitness+ service. \u201cWe view Apple\u2019s upcoming Fitness+ offering as a worthwhile competitor within the Health and Wellness category, and expect the service will benefit from pandemic-related at-home spending trends,\u201d he writes. \u201cIn addition to meaningful revenue/EPS contribution, we expect notable synergy opportunities across Watch/TV/iPad/Services and view the offering as one more way that Apple can drive customer loyalty and, importantly, repeat purchases.\u201d\n\nAssuming a 20% adoption rate by Apple Watch customers, Muller estimates that Fitness+ could generate $3 billion in annual revenue by 2022. \u201cOur revenue estimates are stand-alone for Fitness+; however, Apple Watch is a requirement and unit sales could benefit from interest in Fitness+,\u201d he writes.  \u201cIn total, we view Fitness+ as an ideal candidate to drive additional Apple-related spend and, importantly, keep customers more engaged and immersed within the Apple ecosystem, which should drive future iPhone sales.\u201d\n\nSource: Barron's",

        "selftext": " **What is Happening?**\n\nActivist investor Dan Loeb is urging Disney to permanently suspend its dividend and use the funds to fuel growth at its streaming service, Disney+. Disney stock traded up 1.64% Wednesday. Loeb's Third Point owns less than 1% of Disney.\u00a0\n\n*Activist investors acquire stakes in companies with the intent to bring operational change. Warren Buffett started out as an activist investor.*\u00a0\n\n**Why does this Matter?**\n\nDisney's stock is down 16% for the year as amusement parks are still slow to reopen due to\u00a0restrictions. Also, last week Disney announced that it was laying off 28,000 workers, wiping out about a quarter of its U.S. theme-park workforce.\u00a0  \n\n\nRight now the company's only bright spot is Disney+. It\u00a0attracted more than 60 million subscribers and even won praise from the likes of Netflix CEO Reed Hastings.\u00a0  \n\n\nLoeb would like to use the $3 billion Disney dividend to double Disney+'s budget for original content, bring in additional subscribers, lower churn, and boost pricing power. He would also like to see Disney combine Disney+, ESPN+, Hulu, and Star into one powerhouse streaming service. That way Disney could increase pricing and start releasing all movies on the platform, cutting out movie theaters completely.\u00a0  \n\n\n**The Takeaway:**   \nInitially, it might seem scary to take away that 1.43% dividend yield from shareholders; however, Loeb is not completely crazy. Dividends are just one way a company can choose to \"allocate capital/profits\". As Loeb correctly points out, times are changing in the entertainment sector and Disney should capitalize on that by redirecting dividends\u00a0to this high growth project.\u00a0In the long-run, such a capital allocation decision might just\u00a0reward shareholders a lot more than the 1.46% dividend.\u00a0",

        "selftext": "Good sobering reminder that tech is not \"immune\" from Covid\n\n* * *\n\nSAP SE shares dropped as much as 21%, the biggest intraday fall since 1999, after the software company cut its revenue forecast for the full year and said it expects a fresh wave of lockdowns to hurt demand through the first half of 2021.\n\nIn a test for Christian Klein, who became sole chief executive officer in April, the pandemic will delay SAP\u2019s goals for cloud revenue, overall sales and operating profit by one or two years, especially in hard-hit industries such as business travel, the Walldorf, Germany-based company said in a statement on Sunday. The drop in shares on Monday wiped 28 billion euros ($33.1 billion) off SAP\u2019s market value.\n\nThe drop-off in SAP\u2019s cloud revenue is a sign that companies are putting off making major decisions about updating their software, as the pandemic continues to limit any global economic recovery.\n\nSAP said it expects limited growth and margin improvement over the next two years, and moved expectations to meet its 2023 strategy plan out to 2025. Klein said on a call Monday he expects a conservative recovery into the first half of next year.\n\nThe previous outlook \u201cassumed economies would reopen and population lockdowns would ease, leading to a gradually improving demand environment in the third and fourth quarters,\u201d SAP said in the statement. \u201cLockdowns have been recently re-introduced in some regions and demand recovery has been more muted than expected.\u201d\n\nThe pessimistic short-term outlook from SAP risked a knock-on effect on the European software industry, warned analysts at Citi. Europe\u2019s Stoxx Technology index fell as much as 6.3%, its biggest one-day loss since March.\n\nSAP now expects adjusted revenue of 27.2 billion euros to 27.8 billion euros ($32.2 billion to $32.9 billion) at constant currencies in 2020, lower than the earlier guidance of 27.8 billion euros to 28.5 billion euros. SAP also said it no longer sees a boost from business-travel related revenue this year in its Concur business.\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to find positive news in the results, Nicholas David, an analyst at Oddo BHF said Monday. \u201cThe warning on the mid-term ambitions was expected/feared by the market but the new ambitions are lower than the most pessimistic expectations,\u201d he said in a note.\n\nQualtrics IPO\n\nSAP said it is in the advanced stages of a listing for its Qualtrics software unit. It announced the decision in July to list the U.S. unit less than two years after buying the company for a record sum, a surprise u-turn signaling a strategic shift under Klein.\n\n\u201cWe are well advanced in the preparations of the Qualtrics IPO\u201d, Chief Financial Officer Luka Mucic said on a call Monday. \u201cQualtrics has had a strong quarter which will set it up for further growth into next year.\u201d\n\nNew Outlook\n\nAdjusted cloud revenue is expected to be 8 billion euros to 8.2 billion euros in 2020, down from a previous estimate of 8.3 billion euros to 8.7 billion euros.Operating profit will be 8.1 billion euros to 8.5 billion euros this year, down from expectations of as much as 8.7 billion euros.SAP updated its mid-term ambition for total revenue to more than 36 billion euros in 2025 compared to its previous estimate of 35 billion euros in 2023.The company sees more than 22 billion euros in cloud revenue and over 11.5 billion euros in operating profit by 2025.\n\nThird Quarter\n\nThird quarter non-IFRS operating profit decreased by 12% year over year to 2.07 billion euros. That compared to the 2.15 billion-euro average estimate from analysts in a Bloomberg survey.Revenue in the period declined 4% to 6.54 billion euros compared to analysts\u2019 average 6.89 billion euro estimate.\n\nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/sap-cuts-2020-sales-outlook-203149264.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNhLw&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAF_TaMgWyjSVtobIX4GleBfpxopa9L9TJPKsfacBFTYWfKsmRwIYgoXWKTsN9zxuDnWxbFmAOO_C0MoqBPECjfaDupuibcHiddhhuFflrSnOonBcL_HNEvw4VBScDkIZLzNmq6o7D-LBpS3t8eU_C32-pyOY2zz9QVNvDCuoJ3hT",

        "selftext": "Alright retards and autists,\n\nAs the 5 of you that listened to me last time will know, I am a pilot flying freight for AAWW. \n\nFor the third time I am posting DD as I have done or commented every quarter, and for those of you that have listened, you are probably buying your 3rd or 4th yacht by now. So here I go again:\n\nSo the business model most airlines, passenger airlines, follow is they want you retards to pay for their gas and us retards to fly you etc by buying tickets, and use the business traveler and belly freight to make their razor thin profit margins. Since demand has fallen off a cliff by as much as 90%, and there is an increased demand for freight capacity, the belly freight capacity normally used by the passenger carriers has now gone to the freight carriers, as well as a significant increase in e-commerce. Add to that that Atlas (AAWW) and Kalitta(privately owned) have pretty much been the go to to lead the charge to bring masks and other PPE over from Asia in addition to regular contracts, its provided a large tailwind to the freight/ACMI industry. Freight capacity is currently in such demand that freight prices have increased 10x normal rates. One charter flight of cargo from China through to Cincinnati nets 1.1 million in profit for AAWW, in addition to regular routes for DHL contracts. If you look at Q1 last year where we were at -29 million, which is a historically poor quarter for us with the impacts from chinese new year, and the Q1 swing to +29 million this year, that illustrates some of the impact. Our most profitable quarters are Q3 and Q4, due to increased demand during the peak holiday season and run up to it. Add to this the fact that our inability to staff due to labor issues (which will be resolved this year) is now solved because of thousands of pilots out of work, there is going to be a growth boom. We expect to hire another 1000 to a total of 3000 by end of year 2021, putting us at the same size in terms of pilot group, as UPS. ATSG and more importantly AAWW also have government contracts for the military, DoS, etc that provide other revenue streams. In summation: a pandemic, moms stress shopping on Amazon, and Wars all provide massive tendies for this sector.\n\nThe Play:\n\nAs I have mentioned before in various comment threads, the way to make money on AAWW earnings is to ride the run up wave to the earnings. Despite massive beats, there is maybe a 10% pop on earnings and then a pull back before it starts to push back up again at a nice gingerly pace throughout the ensuing quarter.\n\nPositions:\n\nAAWW 70C 11/20\nAAWW 75C 11/20\n\nThanks for coming to my ted talk.",

If you end up in an account deficit and you don\u2019t resolve it by the end of the trading day on October 16, you will be issued a [**margin call**](http://sg.robinhood.com/ls/click?upn=6fntGirSE5selsQKrSSUHjMA59bDfCWW6qZNCvrM0fJJl1X47T2AcffKHm-2BaJqTTQuGgInaPzu96PEQUN1nwuWpS-2BxPQs7F1GJURHrwATGY-3DgYHQ_MQUFcoWv1-2FLxBDNNs3puw489MgRyTMIrkhURUkDkGonBR0y54K0Ymimqlq8C-2FN-2FNNHZxdHy4TeDuj-2FeCg7mFLkhzx-2Ba1H98pPoXlvIJGUkrZNYjQ7rRA7P9In0DQkqs-2FGu0ZNLpXGNPgMxmBMnSDpvVOT29z4hPUXfzPzS8RYyNgRVP6G3IEiaII3z5-2BQsl52cpdhC0YZWKH1Y79zuCwFYLAIsil6eCDFIrbIP4AX2gJUlqd9ZkrgBialQOKiO6YwKqcGS2eo9LifbROyB29ckUmg8h4sTU5E-2B4j1-2FRXba7B4rB3t4NT3fva0nWmQUbsqh8urnYlu55pzHY-2FOtemjOKEkntPDxQi7RexY57LzELDuKSpeEDU17YS0f5AM-2FYNJ8myb0R979CYVoEPfJB-2BmmTJLmcjEKF92BWatdtVZb36o1-2FM3UcOoUckf948GFFkQZKzJLbzbiLcDiTIWNTzxg-3D-3D).

        "selftext": " Alright Autists,\n\nYou've been hearing a lot about Gamestop. It is MASSIVELY shorted. There are roughly [\\~70 million shares](http://shortsqueeze.com/shortinterest/stock/GME.htm) that have to be bought sooner or later.\n\nThere aren't many opportunities like this where a company is turning around, entering a new console super cycle with a healthy balance sheet, gaming and tech visionaries leading the turn around, and negative sentiment prevailing for years. This created one of the greatest short bubbles I've seen in the market. Rumor has it that a few Wall Street firms are on the short end of this trade.\n\nPeople have already posted about [Ryan Cohen](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/gamestop-stock-price-chewy-investor-plans-amazon-rival-ecommerce-2020-9-1029612504), [Reggie Fils-Aime](https://venturebeat.com/2020/03/09/reggie-fils-aime-gamestop/), [Microsoft](https://www.businessinsider.com/xbox-deal-with-gamestop-includes-revenue-share-on-digital-sales-2020-10)...I'm going to talk a little about Gamestop's E-commerce. E-commerce is very important as it will massively increase its total addressable market and help continue optimizing its dense retail structure (increasing profitability.)\n\nNow that Gamestop is turning into an e-commerce gaming power house (\"Chewy of Gaming\"), it's good to track their e-commerce metrics. Gamestop's total addressable market went from purely relying on brick-and-mortar to include everyone with internet. Their website is very nice now and they also recently [updated the app](https://twitter.com/Reggie/status/1311802247114678273)\n\n. Covid has changed consumer shopping behaviors and forced companies to up their e-commerce games, subsequently putting [consumer loyalty up for grabs](https://www.retailcustomerexperience.com/articles/building-customer-loyalty-in-the-post-covid-19-retail-environment/) (Gamestop already has [55+ million loyalty members!](http://news.gamestop.com/fact-sheet-0))\n\nLet's see what their e-commerce has been doing. Referring to the charts below (data excludes the app; it's only web and mobile web traffic):\n\n1. [Gamestop web traffic is skyrocketing](https://www.similarweb.com/website/gamestop.com/)  \n from August to September. What's really interesting is that its Category Ranking (a measure against its own competitors) went from 83 to 38! This could mean that Gamestop is capturing market share from its e-commerce competitors (Amazon, Best Buy, Target, Newegg, etc.)\n2. Organic search is improving (less ad costs and means people are searching for Gamestop directly)\n3. Social media referrals are increasing (Twitter and Reddit leading the way)\n4. [Google searches](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%205-y&amp;geo=US&amp;q=gme%20stock)  \n for Gamestop's stock are at all time highs! (Bonus...not directly related to Gamestop's e-commerce)\n5. Another big one that not many people know about yet is that Gamestop is penetrating PC Gaming Hardware. That is a [$40 billion industry](https://wccftech.com/pc-gaming-hardware-market-to-grow-by-3-6-billion-in-2020-thanks-to-covid-19/)  \n and growing! The overall industry is growing at roughly 10% a year and entry-level gaming hardware is growing at over 20%! I believe Gamestop has the advantage of being a dominant player in that industry compared to Newegg, Best Buy, Amazon, etc. As a comparison, roughly half of [Best Buy's revenue](http://s2.q4cdn.com/785564492/files/doc_financials/2020/ar/Best-Buy-Fiscal-2020-Annual-Report.pdf) (pg. 26) comes from Computing and Mobile (\\~$20 billion.) Gamestop is getting ready to attack that industry hard and get its piece of the pie. This could be a very fast growing and lucrative category!\n\nI've attached a screenshot of interestings graphs and metrics, and you'll find references to articles in the hyperlinks above. Enjoy :)\n\nTL:DR Gamestop e-commerce is killing it.

        "selftext": " \n\nAT&amp;T is a company that I'm sure doesn't need explaining. It is familiar to all of us as a telecom company that has branched out to providing internet, entertainment (HBO Max being one of their more recent ventures), and more.\n\n**Why this is being posted now &amp; the potential:**\n\n* Q3 reporting is set for 22 October.\n* At its current price AT&amp;T is in a position to provide significant growth prospects alongside a safe, high-paying dividend.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLooking at it current chart (16 October for reference) we can clearly see here that the stock is trading at its lowest levels since Q1. This provides a great opportunity to buy quality company at much higher yields to lock in superior long-term returns. It is unlikely they will drop much lower than this point due to the effect downward pressure has on dividend paying companies. If we look at the older charts, when AT&amp;T has reached these lows the stock has a strong tendency to rally from this 27-28$ support area. Additionally AT&amp;T has a lot going for it, let's quickly take a look.\n\n**What AT&amp;T has going for it:**\n\n* It has increased its dividend payout for the last 36 years and has the means to continue to do so.\n* Consistent revenue growth.\n* Lots and lots of cash on hand.\n* They are a leader in the US for 5G.\n* They are working to replace old top management (This is particularly important).\n* Warner Media and HBO Max\n\nWarner Media and HBO Max may be points of controversy here. Let's look at it from this perspective. These get AT&amp;T into new markets, HBO in particular into the saturated streaming market. Netflix has dominated this particular sector, however Disney and AT&amp;T are cracking Netflix's business model by pulling back their streaming to their own platforms. This is the reason Netflix is creating so many of its own shows/movies and increasing it's subscription price. This pressure is allowing AT&amp;T to slowly claw its way in. (Very slowly though, obv HBO Max is no Disney Plus). Additionally this will be the first full quarter of HBO Max on the books for AT&amp;T, with 36 million new subscribers reported it is likely to have a positive effect on the report.\n\nThe safe dividend is a strong factor to remain bullish on AT&amp;T. Even with the disruptions from the COVID-19 pandemic, AT&amp;T's balance sheets show recurring profitability and consistent cash flow generation can easily cover the quarterly payouts.\n\n**Two big issues:**\n\n* A lot of long-term debt (At extremely low rates, so fortunately it doesn't impact their cash flow)\n* Terrible acquisitions over the last 10 years (Direct TV, which they are looking to sell)\n\nIt could be a good sign that AT&amp;T is finally looking to sell the underperforming Direct TV. Sure they bought it for $67 Billion and would likely sell for $20 Billion but off loading legacy segments can allow them to focus on growth and expand into markets that are actually relevant for today and tomorrow while being less of a drag on their current debt.\n\n**Final Comments:**\n\nPlease extend my DD by doing your own research on top of everything else you have read here, there were many points only briefly touched on.\n\nThank you for taking the time to read!",

        "selftext": "My friends - as a beginner who has recently started making (a little bit more serious) efforts into learning how to invest and trading, let me share some findings with you.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. DO NOT LISTEN TO PEOPLE LIKE STEVEN DUX. Every person in the financial industry has an objective one way or another. Why do you think they keep playing up the fact that they're rich but ask you to participate in their courses or \"learn their secrets\" for a couple thousands of your hard-earned cash? Because they want to take advantage of your inexperience and sell you something that seems grand but is usually something that you can Google or learn easily on your own. There are no \"industry trade secrets\" in investing; if there were, a lot more people like these ones offering you such \"secrets\" would be billionaires and wouldn't bother trying to \"teach\" you something that you don't know.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2. Take information from a variety of resources. Don't take anyone's offer in selecting \"stocks\" for you that will make you rich overnight. These are tremendous red flags because investments are a deeply personal choice. You invest in companies that you believe in and that YOU think will do well. If all he/she does is offer you a plan that is obscure in where you're putting your money or promises instant wealth with \"unicorn\" companies, they will run with your money. Do your research, learn basic financial concepts from places like Investopedia, and find companies that you truly think will stand the test of time and will grow. Think about it: would you want to throw all your funds at \"tried and tested\" companies like Exxon because some investment guru said it's the best choice (but you personally disagree with or think is going to fail in the future), or invest in a company like Patagonia (ethically respectable, well-known, and trusted) or Google (world-renowned and used, not the best ethically but you know that no one's going to give up their search engine in a long, long time) that you trust for the medium-long term?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: Make your own decisions and learn things for yourself one step at a time instead of placing your trust and funds into the hands of another. It'll pay off in the long run, I guarantee it.",

They\u2019re climbing in the United States. And so there\u2019s still a sufficient level of uncertainty out there\u2026 we don\u2019t believe that\u2019s an environment to guide into,\u201d Apple CEO Tim Cook told CNBC\u2019s Josh Lipton. \n\nApple hasn\u2019t offered guidance for the past two quarters because of uncertainty related to the Covid-19 pandemic. \n\nHowever, Cook said that he was optimistic about iPhone 12 sales for a number of reasons, including 5G support, carrier promotions, and a loyal install base, and said that \u201cinitial data points are really quite good.\u201d\n\niPhone revenue was down over 16% from the same quarter last year and came up short against Wall street expectations. However, many investors and analysts are more focused on how the iPhone 12 will sell in the coming year. Apple\u2019s iPhones went on sale this year in October, and more models are planned for next month, meaning that sales from the new devices aren\u2019t counted in this quarter.\n\nRevenue for Macs and iPads both exceeded analyst expectations, most likely driven by strong work-from-home trends during the pandemic. Apple drew attention to strong results in those categories last quarter, too. Overall, Mac revenue was up 29% year-over-year and iPad revenue rose 46% from the same quarter last year. \n\nSales in China were a weak point for Apple. Sales in greater China, which includes Hong Kong and Taiwan, dropped to $7.95 billion from $11.13 billion a year before, over a 28% decrease.\n\n\u201cA larger percentage of China revenue is made up of new iPhones. And so that\u2019s the reason the number for the total quarter started with a minus sign. But given what we see in the early going with the new iPhones, we\u2019re confident we\u2019ll grow in Q1,\u201d Cook told CNBC.\n\nApple released new Apple Watch Series 6 models that went on sale in September. The category that those devices are counted in for sales is called Wearables, Home, and Accessories, which came in slightly higher than expectations. The category also includes sales from headphones such as AirPods and Beats. Sales for the category were up over 20% on a year-over-year basis. \n\nInvestors are always closely examining Apple\u2019s services business, which includes subscriptions like iCloud and Apple Music, fees from the App Store paid by app developers, and licensing revenue. Services revenue exceeded Wall Street expectations and grew 16% over last year. \n\nOn Friday, Apple will release bundles of its subscription services called Apple One, Reuters reported. The bundles vary by region but include Apple Music, iCloud storage, and Apple TV+ streaming video.",

        "selftext": "I live in a hillbilly ish suburb about an hour and a half outside Chicago.  I had to run to grocery store just now about 7pm on a Monday. The prime truck was at the end of my street as I walked out. I watched it leave the first stop, then onto the guy across from me, then to my Next door neighbor, and literally stood there watching him proceed to hit 5 more houses on my block. Then he turned and appeared to stop at another house on a separate block as I headed on my way. How the fuck is any company going to truly compete with amazon. Unless Walmart plus or anyone just opens a online warehouse for delivery in every region that operates similarly I don\u2019t see how anyone can compete with them. \n\nI work for a chain retail auto parts company in hodunkville.  Cant even tell you how many customers a day try to have us price match amazon or rock auto).  Amazon rapes us on everything and many many people  already has prime so if we have to order something for a customer what incentive does customer have to order from us and not get it for literally 1/4 of price in many cases.  Auto parts are something a lot of people don\u2019t realize amazon sells if they aren\u2019t a DIY person already. \n\nMy point is that amazon will take no fucking prisoners and literally wipe the floor with anyone who tried to out innovate them. It makes me honestly think about getting a management position with them in the factory about 30 min from me. God damn bless whoever owns their stock at a low avg because they going to send yo ass to retirement",

I have great friends, a loving family that supports me and for my age (22) I am doing well, 4.0 student in college, extra curriculars, jobs lined up for after I graduate, the whole nine yards, but even with everything I have I still feel unfulfilled, as if I\u2019m missing something in my life. I\u2019ve come to the realization that I don\u2019t want to be a 9 to 5 slave like 95 percent of the world, I realized that I would rather be a failure that took my shot than an average person who didn\u2019t. I want to be able to enjoy my life on my terms, and the only way I feel like I can do that is if I get rich. Maybe I\u2019m falling into the get rich quick trap, but even if I do I don\u2019t really even care anymore. Life is short, you have to take some risks (calculated) to get to where you want to be. I know not all of us retards are gonna be successful, a lot of us will go broke trying, but I really wish y\u2019all the best. Hope as many of us make it as possible.",

        "selftext": "Going into an election, there will be volatility, especially given the present circumstances. There is a lot of information available that will simultaneously be political in nature and impact markets.\n\nIt's getting to the point where it's almost impossible to discuss markets without getting into politics. Stimulus, for example, depends on 2 sides reaching an agreement. Discussion about the politics of negotiation can help estimate probability of something passing, but is also very political in nature.\n\nI'm all fine with removing inflammatory and disrespectful posts, or politics totally irrelivant to markets(ie social issues). But I think we should be allowed to politely discuss politics as long as it is relevant to markets and investing.\n\nI understand it's difficult to moderate huge threads, but if you aren't up to moderating, appoint someone else.",

        "selftext": "# If you find this interesting please follow my account for more DD.\n\n# I'm also working on an Excel file which will provide all fundamental data about a stock, more info about that on my account. TLDR at bottom!\n\n**Introduction**\n\nWith the change and progressing to extremer climates, global warming is coming our way. It has been shown world governments are incapable of properly taking action against this threat. Since it seems like global warming won\u2019t be stopped, we will have to start adapting to the new extreme climates. One way of ensuring a comfortable living/working space in this grim future is by making use of HVAC (Heating Ventilation &amp; Air Conditioning). **And that\u2019s what got me thinking**. My family has been hell bent on **NOT** getting air-conditioning. But with the summer temperatures ever more frequently reaching +40c with a humidity of +70%(Hup Holland Hup) it\u2019s becoming unbearable. Sleepless nights, overheated pets, fainting, old people dying and just losing your will to live. These are all issues more people around the world are starting to face. Every place on earth is getting more extreme. Every place on earth is getting more need for Climate control. And every company is looking to profit of that! This is why my next play is in the HVAC industry. \n\n**Finding our compatible companies.** \n\nI only want to invest in the best companies. Living in The Netherlands I personally don\u2019t know the best brands, luckily, I\u2019ve got great internet. So, after spitting through some review sites these are the 5 public companies that came out best when looking for \u201cBest HVAC/Air-conditioning companies/brands\u201d. (Not ranked) \n\n1. Carrier (Day&amp;Night, Bryant, Toshiba &amp; 15 more)\n\n2. Trane (American Standard, Thermo King &amp; 7 more). \n\n3. Daikin (Goodman, Amana). \n\n4. Lennox (Service Experts, Allies Air Enterprises). \n\n5. Johnson Controls (Hitachi, York)\n\n**Understanding the HVAC market.**\n\nBefore we continue to further analyze the companies, we first need to understand the HVAC market.\n\nSome facts: \n\n1. The HVAC business has been valued at $91.30B in 2020 and is expected to reach $173B by 2024 and $367B by 2030. That\u2019s a Compounded Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of +/-15%. \n\n2. The most popular countries for Air Conditioning (AC) per household are: Japan 91%, USA 90%, Korea 86%, Saudi Arabia 53%, China 60%. \n\n3. Global stock of AC is expected to grow to 5.6B by 2050, up from 1.6B in 2018. (This is 1 AC sold every second for the next 30 years).\n\n4. Less than a third of the global households own an AC.\n\n5. 8% of the 2.8B people living in the hottest parts of the world own an AC (Brazil, Indonesia, India, African countries).\n\n6. AC demand is increasing every year going from 97,60M in 2012, up 111M in 2018.\n\nAs can been seen in the above statements the HVAC business is very well integrated in some large countries. But the most exciting prospects are those of the developing countries. In Mexico, Brazil, Indonesia, South Africa and India only 16%, 16%, 9%, 6% and 5% respectively of the households have AC. This is a MASSIVE market just waiting to be exploited.\n\n\\- The Indian AC market stood at $4,3B in 2017 and is expected to surpass 11B by 2023, that\u2019s a CAGR of over 17%. This rising growth is led by rising infrastructure development, growing demand for housing and the constantly rising temperatures and consumers purchasing power.\n\n\\- The Middle Eastern and African market is expected to have an CAGR of 4,9% during 2019-2024.\n\n\\- The Indonesian market is currently experiencing a 2% CAGR in AC demand over 2012 till 2018.\n\n\\- The US is expected to have a CAGR of 3.1% from 2020 to 2030.\n\n\\- Europe is expected to have a CAGR of 6% from 2019 to 2025.\n\n\\- **The global HVAC market is expected to grow with a CAGR of 5.5% from 2018 till 2024**.\n\n**Market share.**\n\nThis was actually really really difficult to find free sources on and I can\u2019t really make a clear picture out of it so here are the numbers:\n\n\\- 2013 North America market: Carrier 17%, Daikin 15%, Trane 10%, Johnson 9%, Lennox 6%, LG 5%.\n\n\\- 2013 Global AC market: Daikin 13%, Carrier 10%, Johnson 8%, Trane/LG 4%.\n\n\\- 2018 Indian market share: LG 17,7%, Hitachi 7,9%, Daikin 7,4%.\n\n\\- HVAC Used by construction firms in USA: Carrier 29%, Lennox 17,3%, Daikin 8,2%, Trane7,3%, LG 1,8% Johnson 1,8%.\n\n\\- 2020 global \u201cWall-Mounted Fan Coil Units\u201d market: Daikin 29%, Trane 26%, Carrier 12%, Johnson 7,5%\n\nMy conclusion from this and other information found online is that globally Daikin is the biggest followed by Carrier, Johnson, Trane, LG and Lennox. I accounted for all known acquisitions since 2013 in the market share.\n\n**An introduction to the Companies**\n\n**Carrier**\n\nCarrier products and related services include HVAC and refrigeration systems, building controls and automation, fire and special hazard suppression systems and equipment, security monitoring and rapid response systems, provided to a diversified international customer base principally in the industrial, commercial and residential property and commercial transportation sectors.\n\nEmployees: 53,000+\n\nCountries active: 160+\n\nMarket Cap: 25,959B\n\n**Key points:**\n\n\\- 85% of sales are in the USA or Europe, they are however planning to expand globally.\n\n\\- 51% HVAC, 29% Fire and Security, 20% Refrigeration.\n\n\\- Since April 2020 carrier has split off from Raytheon Technologies, allowing them to focus fully on the HVACR market.\n\n\\- Carrier is planning on cutting 600million in costs by 2022 (4% of current COGS)\n\n\\- Carrier has recently launched its \u201cBlueEdge\u201d platform, providing aftermarket service to customers and minimizing machinery downtime &amp; costs.

Also, Johnson had some fuckery going on in all their 10k\u2019s so these numbers might not add up, let me know if you found something.\n\nLooking at the company\u2019s financials and numbers it\u2019s a tough decision to make, all companies a pretty close to each other. There are however some things that stand out:\n\n\\- Carrier has a significantly higher NPM then the competitors.\n\n\\- Lennox might be in financial trouble.\n\n\\- Daikin spends the most on R&amp;D relative to its revenue, I see this as a big plus.\n\n\\- Johnson their revenue is growing the fastest on a 5Y CAGR.\n\n\\- Johnson their P/E is much higher than the competition.\n\n\\- Johnson their Dividend is the higher % wise\n\n\\- Daikin has increased sales in 2020 while other companies have seen a drop.\n\n\\- Daikin\u2019s NPM is stable at around 8% while Carrier\u2019s NPM has grown explosively. \n\n\\- Trane has a high debt/equity ratio\n\n\\- Both Carrier and Daikin have a very strong Interest coverage ratio.\n\n\\- Johnson's TTM would be better without an irregular expense of 602M\n\nNow on to the less financial aspect of the data.\n\nI really like the way Daikin presents their annual report, they have clear strategies on how to better engage the Indian market. They are also showing that they know where their market growth protentional lays and are willing to act on it. Furthermore, what really strikes me as interesting is that Daikin produces materials for semiconductor testing, this might be a goldmine in the upcoming tech revolution and Daikin has shown to be well aware of this upcoming trend. Carrier on the other hand has not properly breached the Asian/Middle eastern market yet, they have stated to expand their geographical presence but I have found no conclusive strategies in how to do so. What is impressive about carrier is their high net profit margin and willingness to act on a more digital environment, an area where Daikin is currently lacking.\n\nTo conclude this research properly, if I had to choose a company right now, I\u2019d being going for Daikin. Their well-presented data and goals for emerging markets, combined with their semiconductor products make me believe they are most suited for rapid growth. Their geographical location also puts them in a better position for Asian dominance. And their Goodman sub brand is well known in America and a direct competitor to Carrier. Carrier is a close second, with impressive brand recognition and attractive financials. One thing carrier does well that Daikin does not is transport refrigeration. In my opinion trucking is going to play a much larger role when self-driving trucks start to appear.",

        "selftext": "I would like to preface this by first saying I really don't care whether or not you personally invest in ARKK or whatever. If you believe in your investments more power to you and I'm not here to bash anyone's choices there's no guarantees in life. \n\nThat said...\n\nARKK is the concept of an actively managed mutual fund in the format of an ETF. Long term, study after study after study has shown (in the context of long term investing), an overwhelming majority of actively managed funds do not beat the regular stock market index. Furthermore, ARKK's high expense ratio has the potential to cause significant drag on your earnings if ARK fails to deliver on outperforming the market the next few years.\n\nSo if you would not buy an actively managed mutual fund that sells itself by \"outperforming the market\" and \"picking a collection of innovative stocks\", why buy ARKK? It might seem revolutionary as an ETF. When you view ARKK in it's mutual fund form, [ADNPX](https://www.morningstar.com/funds/xnas/adnpx/quote), ARKK stops resembling some wonder ETF and starts to more accurately resemble what it really is - an active managed fund that's just attempting to rebrand itself.\n\nThe REAL reason why Catherine Wood is a genius is that she has successfully identified and tapped into an new market of investors -  young naive investors that follow hype with limited experience with active funds - and sold them on an old idea with trendy new branding. With her success with ARKK, you're starting to see a lot of other actively managed mutual funds release their own ETF versions to buy into this market as well and compete with ARKK.",

        "selftext": "My largest single portfolio piece is shares of ICLN, a clean energy ETF comprised of 30 highly liquid clean energy businesses, mostly concentrated around residential solar and hydrogen fuel cells (PLUG is an example). \n\nI currently have about 13% of my portfolio in ICLN and I\u2019m nearly at 70% return for the year. There are a lot of reasons to want exposure to renewables that we\u2019ve discussed before. Here\u2019s why I think you should invest in ICLN and do it before the end of October\n\n1. Most renewables (particularly solar) are actually cost competitive with almost every other form of energy. In most of the US, the cost of residential solar per kWh is less than half of the kWh cost of utility generated power. This is beginning to put tremendous pricing pressure on oil and natural gas. The long term economics favor wind and solar. \n \n2. State corporation commissions are rolling out robust renewable energy and efficiency standards, including states that haven\u2019t traditionally espoused political interest surrounding climate change. Arizona for example recently unveiled a major REST update that will substantially accelerate the states transition to renewables. \n\n3. Major renewable energy companies like PLUG and RUN are maturing. The solar industry in particular burned a lot of investors as young companies struggled to establish themselves in a volatile market heavily reliant on government subsidy. That\u2019s no longer the case. There are several mature market players that are highly stable, have dynamic leadership, and have proven they can execute amidst changing market conditions. They are well represented in ICLN. \n\n4. The politics of climate change are settling. This year alone Pew found that 67% of Americans don\u2019t believe government response to climate change has been good enough, 63% believe stricter environmental laws are worth the cost, and for the first time in history a majority of Americans identify climate change as a major issue for them. \n\n5. Joe Biden is going to win the election. This might bring some heat, but I don\u2019t care. Even a polling error of the same magnitude of 2016 results in a resounding Biden win. The election is actively happening and Biden is winning in every major battleground. This is why timing is important - a Biden administration (with a narrow democratic majority in the senate) will be caged in on what they can accomplish. An easy political win with bipartisan appetite includes major infrastructure/energy investments, extensions of tax credits for renewables, and a return to reciprocal trade policy on renewable imports. I expect the entire sector to surge with a Biden win. Like it, hate it, I don\u2019t care - this has nothing to do with my politics and everything to do with my bottom line.",

        "selftext": "It seems alot of people dont know much about this company.\n\nI am up $11,000 in this company in gains, and i do plan to sell half of my shares once NIO reaches $43.\n\nThen i will keep the other half of the shares in the comany for long term\n\nI purchased NIO 100 shares at $6.30 in Apiril 2020, right before the EV hype but sold them at $7.30.  Do so speculations on EV hype tanking.\nNIO has been only buy and hold this year.\n \nAfter Months of research and opinions, and later i drove a Tesla this year for the first time. I purchased a Tesla Cybertruck $100 pre order. I think Electric vehicles are truly the future and ICE companies are long behind the trend. Even though these ICE conpanies are moving to EV. Many dont have the Tech and customer likeness that Tesla has. ICE companies will struggle getting their loyal customers to switch to EV vehicles. While Tesla never needed that switch. In fact Tesla is actually stealing ICE customers and has been for years.\n\nWe can go ahead and assume Tesla owners are not going to go back to a ICE vehicle unless it was for financial situations and vehicle space. \n\nIll be honest i, i wouldnt pay 45k for a small model 3 sedan when i could just buy a large crew cab luxury Ram for 40k.\n\nHowever, Tesla vehicles lose 10% value each year compared to 20% In ICE vehicles.\n\n\nBack to NIO\n\n1. They  have 3 vehciles right now with a recent model thst was released mid of 2020. They will have another vehicle released January 6th 2021, on NIO day. Thats 2 new vehicles released in one year span. Bring it to a total of 4 vehicles. This is relatively easy for them because they dont actually own a single factory. They pay JAC motors to build them vehicles.\n\n2. They are backed by the government. The chieese government i vested $1.1 billion dollars into their company 2 months ago if they agreed to relocate their headquarters in Hefei, China. Its about 200 miles west of Shanghai, China.\n\n3. They are the only other EV with actually reasonable vehicles for consumers.\n\n4. The CEO and founder is \"William Li\". He is a billionaire who also co-founded a publically traded company named \"BitAuto\" (BITA) its an auto review company in China.\n\n5. They have over 100 stations in China that swap batteries for new fully charged ones in 5 mins.\n\n6. Their negative quarterly margin is shrinking very fast and if the rate continues, they will have positive profitable margins by next year.\n\n7. William Li said october 10th, Nio's vehicle production target is 150,000 total sales and he wants to double that to 300,000 by end of 2021.\n\n8. They have an auto driving feature called. NIO pilot. \u00a0\n\nThe in-house developed NIO Pilot, empowered by Mobileye EyeQ4, boasts over 20 driver assistance features and supports firmware-over-the-air updates. Always evolving, always up-to-date.\n\n9. They have NIO SERVICE, which are vans with batteries that can charge an EV on the go, if you run out of Electricity on the side of the road. \n\n10. They are limited to 5,000 vehicles per month by JAC motors. JAC MOTORS is the company that actually makes the NIO vehicles.\n\n11. The Nio Es6 is a high comparable vehicle to the Tesla Model X with simalir pricing.\n\n12. NIO's reported customer loyalty referral is 3 times higher than Tesla's in China.\n\n13. NIO BASS (battery as a Service) is a subscription-based battery service where you will be able upgrade copacity in the future. It includes the battery swaping stations they have placed around cities. \n\nSo there is all the main info i found about this Car Company. I really think if it will thrive in the future, as long as they dont screw it up. Its risky of course. Just like Tesla. \n\nBut the main reason i think we will see NIO reach Tesla in China is because the Chineesr culture is just like American culture. We love seeing made in USA products, just like they love seeing Made in China products.\n\nI think that people were forced to buy Tesla in China because the chineese people didnt have a choice. But now that NIO is starting to look like the next Battery started EV company, we can see them overcoming Tesla in China in the next 5 years.\n\nBut i will also say that Tesla vehicles are more efficient in their vehciles in many ways, I still think NIO will thrive in China.",

That presents a massive opportunity for those who are paying attention. Are you paying attention?\n\nThis massive short position is coupled with extremely low sentiment in the bond markets generally. In fact sentiment has just bounced off of 0%. These sort of excessive conditions are exactly what veteran traders look toward for opportunity. Typically when we see sentiment this low, we see a move upward in prices.\n\n[Source: http:\\/\\/jayonthemarkets.com\\/](https://preview.redd.it/phenn5k4omv51.png?width=1226&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=25d17db5b997acde7e4a5d5a2109207a024ca01c)\n\nThe hedge funds are betting on interest rates rising. They are betting on inflation. They are betting on a weak dollar. And they will be wrong on every count.\n\nThis bet stems from a fundamental misunderstanding of how the Fed and QE operates. Let's discuss this now.\n\n# Money Printer Does NOT Go Brrrrr\n\nThis can be a complex topic, so I'll keep this as simple and brief as I can.\n\nQuantitative Easing is not Cash. In fact, QE is deflationary.\n\nHere is how QE works, in a nutshell. The Fed buys bonds from the big banks. Except the Fed isn't buying them with cash. In exchange for the bonds, the Fed puts funds in a reserve account held by the bank. These reserve funds CANNOT BE TOUCHED by the banks. All the banks can do is use this account as collateral to lend against. Which means if the banks aren't lending, QE funds are not entering the economy. And the banks are not lending, because they would have to risk their own capital to do so.\n\n[Source: https:\\/\\/www.stlouisfed.org\\/open-vault\\/2019\\/august\\/open-market-operations-monetary-policy-tools-explained](https://preview.redd.it/ep5o34n6omv51.png?width=900&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=85ee20a6a61a6070561d2977f6fea4e44ee98437)\n\nIn fact, it's much worse than that. Because the Fed is removing bonds from the open market, and not paying cash for them. Those bonds could be sold for actual cash, which would provide actual liquidity in the market. Despite all the Fed's talk about \"creating liquidity,\" what the Fed is actually doing is REMOVING liquidity from the system.\n\nWhy would they do this? Answer: To lower interest rates. Don't take my word for it, the Fed explains this itself.\n\n[Source: https:\\/\\/www.stlouisfed.org\\/open-vault\\/2019\\/august\\/open-market-operations-monetary-policy-tools-explained](https://preview.redd.it/bfojuyh8omv51.png?width=1280&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8e0d6943fe4d61fc98cb9d5d022e35bcf1c4f697)\n\nSee, the Fed has to follow the laws that govern its actions. Despite what the public believes, the Fed does not have the legal authority to simply print money and hand it out. The Fed knows that the true source of inflation in a debt-based economy is through credit expansion. So the Fed does everything it can to reduce interest rates, both by setting reserve rates near zero and by using QE to drive rates down further.\n\nOnly when credit expansion revives will we begin to see inflation and a true recovery. The Fed knows their hands are tied, which is why they keep hammering Congress to pass more stimulus.\n\nPerhaps the greatest strength of the Fed is in \"forward guidance.\" The Fed simply uses words to convince the public that money is being printed, that inflation is coming, so that people go out and spend and buy assets. They are playing a trick on the public, and the trick is working. People actually believe inflation is coming, that stocks are being held up by the Fed, that money is pouring into the system. The public is wrong on every count.\n\n# For Every Seller, There is a Buyer...\n\nWe all know that every seller needs a buyer. So who is buying the bonds that the hedge funds are shorting in record numbers?\n\nAnswer: The big commercial banks, both foreign and domestic. In other words, the Smart Money. Commercial banks have accumulated a whopping $4.464 TRILLION in securities.\n\nThe Banks are setting up a huge trap for the hedge funds, buying up their bonds for cheap and waiting for the inevitable cover. The Smart Money knows how the Fed works. They know deflation and falling interest rates are coming. And the banks are buying up bonds left and right.\n\n[Source: https:\\/\\/www.federalreserve.gov\\/releases\\/h8\\/current\\/default.htm](https://preview.redd.it/u27ezj8vomv51.png?width=1225&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c74ac7de6f1c1f50bed9d3b7c270b034bb53419b)\n\nIn the last 20-year treasury auction, there were $53 billion in bids for a $22 billion offer. That's called DEMAND, folks. Foreign investors bid $16 billion and primary dealer banks bid $31 billion. The banks, both foreign and domestic, want more bonds.\n\n[Source: https:\\/\\/www.treasurydirect.gov\\/instit\\/annceresult\\/press\\/preanre\\/2020\\/R\\_20201021\\_3.pdf](https://preview.redd.it/9fbudvqxomv51.png?width=792&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0f508a93a891b0e0b1e95abc916e9295da1cc0fa)\n\nThe banks also control lending standards. They are not showing much willingness to open up business and lend. They know that would be risky, because the economy still has not truly recovered. They likely also know that stock prices are inflated, and are prepping for the next leg down.\n\n# The Day WSB Beat the Hedge Funds?\n\nWe have a real opportunity here... An opportunity to bet WITH the Smart Money, and to help squeeze the hedge funds out of their irrational position. Also an opportunity to profit off all the ignorant speculators (looking at most of you) who don't understand how QE works, who think Powell is \"printing money\" and holding up stocks, who think inflation and higher interest rates are just around the corner, when the opposite is true.\n\nAn alliance between the high and the low, the rich and the poor, the smart and the...retarded. All to take money out of the hands of these leveraged dopes on Wall Street.\n\nInterest rates are going to zero. And bonds move inverse to yields, so we will go long bonds. Lucky for us, there is a convenient ETF that allows us to trade the long-term bond market: TLT. And yes, this ETF has options...\n\nI know what you are thinking. \"Bonds? Ok grandpa.\" TLT is no TSLA. But if you want to survive as a trader long-term, you want to look for safe, high-probability plays exactly like this one.\n\n**Position: $TLT 162c 2/19**",

I know SNE is tech but it does not move with the sector much and I really like this position. Any thoughts on good buys. I was really interested in BA but wanted to wait to see what happened after sept 15th and that wasn't great. Great buy but will take years so I am watching for now. Some others I have been following are V/MA, FDX (although getting pricey), J&amp;J and CVS.

        "selftext": "I like Square as a company and see a lot of people are bullish about it. However, a few things stop me from investing. Be interested to hear thoughts but at the moment I am a Square bear. \n\n**Management**\n\nJack Dorsey is a visionary. I don\u2019t think this is controversial. However, his track record at Twitter is worrying for shareholders. Be it daily active user growth, ambition with acquisitions but ultimately failure to monetise a fantastic platform where you have big corporations, celebrities and even the President reaching out to 200m daily active users for free. With Square, the closed loop business model of businesses and consumers is again a fantastic concept that could break the power of Visa/Mastercard. Execution remains to be seen, of course. \n\n**Competition**\n\nSquare operate in a highly competitive field for consumers and businesses. Let\u2019s take consumers based on Square\u2019s fast-growing Cash App. It offers things a normal bank does like deposits, ATM access, money transfer. If it becomes a fully-fledged bank offering loans, credit; it is competing against the likes of big incumbents (e.g. JP Morgan, Bank of America). Granted they\u2019re dinosaur firms but they already have a huge customer base that are older and, therefore, have more money and deposits. This means it is much easier for them to monetise their customers resulting in high ARPU. Why would these lucrative customers, en-masse, want to uproot their finances to Square when their existing providers will be providing the same service by copying Square, as JP Morgan have done this week? [Link](https://www.pymnts.com/smbs/2020/jpmorgan-takes-on-square-and-paypal-at-the-point-of-sale/) \n\nFor businesses, Square\u2019s provides software offering (invoicing, PoS, online store) but face strong competition from the likes of Shopify who are taking a fully integrated service approach to SMEs which allows them to take their business online but also manage all their backend processes, including payments. This is a highly convenient service for entrepreneurs. Shopify already has 6% share of the online retail market. Square also provides hardware products which make it easy for SMEs, in particular, to take payments. However, there is evidence that retail is facing a more permanent shift in the US vs. the rest of the world with 60% less footfall today than a year ago [Link](https://www.spring-board.info/benchmarks/benchmark/daily-footfall). 58% of Square\u2019s GPV is from food/drink, retail and professional services. Square may have good market share but it is a shrinking industry.\n\nAnd as a final piece, competitors in both spaces are generally in very healthy financial shape: Paypal, Shopify, Global Payments, Western Union and big banks are well-capitalised. \n\n**Valuation**\n\nPerhaps you can get over the above with the fact that Square has strong network effects and are able to win customers cheaply. However, in my opinion, Square is priced for perfection. Simply looking at a price/sales metric, it is trading 13x LTM. This is high but maybe relatively reasonable for a fast-growing business. However, 25% of Square\u2019s revenue is accounted by Bitcoin \u201crevenue\u201d. This brings little value to Square (2% gross profit) and even Square themselves discount this revenue in their KPIs because it is \u201cout of their control and not reflective of Square\u2019s performance\u201d. \n\nNow onto profits. It is not fair to be too hard on Square\u2019s profitability. After all, it is in high growth phase and its marketing costs were its highest opex line item at roughly 35% for YTD. However, a cursory look at it is Enterprise Value / EBITDA (forward look to Dec2020), it is 242x. If we give credit for Square\u2019s business plan for a further two years, today\u2019s Enterprise Value over broker consensus forecast EBITDA for 2022, it is still a heady 77x. This is when Square is supposed to have EBITDA of $1bn which is three times more than it is forecast for Dec 2020. Priced to perfection.\n\nIf you compare it to Paypal, it is trading at 39x and 27x EV / EBITDA for Dec 2020 and 2022.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nSquare has formidable backers like Ark Invest. I am also not a great believer in \u201cdumb retail\u201d overvaluing a stock for a prolonged period of time. But for reasons above, I am cautious with Square and yet it keeps climbing so please tell me what I am missing\u2026",

        "selftext": "HONG KONG\u2014Chinese financial-technology giant Ant Group Co. is aiming to raise at least $34.4 billion from the world\u2019s biggest-ever initial public offering, fillings showed Monday, in a blockbuster deal that will bypass U.S. stock exchanges.\n\nThose sums would eclipse the $25 billion raised in 2014 by its former parent Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and the $29.4 billion of shares sold more recently by Saudi Aramco, in what is to date the largest-ever IPO.\n\nThe mammoth IPO, which spans Shanghai and Hong Kong, adds to an already frenetic year for China\u2019s capital markets, which are enjoying a boom in share sales despite heightened tensions with the U.S.\n\nAnt is seeking to raise about $17.2 billion in each city, based on prices of 68.8 yuan and HK$80 respectively per share, according to regulatory filings. Ant could raise up to a maximum of about $5.2 billion more, if underwriters exercise their option to purchase up to 15% more shares in an arrangement known as a greenshoe.\n\nIn a few years, Ant has helped change how people in China spend, borrow, save and invest. The firm, which has its origins in an escrow service for Alibaba\u2019s e-commerce websites, now processes trillions of dollars in payments annually, runs one of the world\u2019s largest money-market funds, and facilitates small loans to hundreds of millions of consumers and small businesses. \n\nThe price values the Hangzhou-based group at about $313 billion, after including the new capital raised but before any greenshoe. In comparison, Mastercard Inc. was worth about $330 billion as of Friday\u2019s close. A private fundraising in 2018 valued Ant at $150 billion.\n\nJack Ma, who controls Ant, said over the weekend the IPO will be \u201cthe largest in human history.\u201d Speaking at a financial forum in Shanghai on Saturday, he said: \u201cThis is the first time that such a big IPO was priced outside of New York City, which we wouldn\u2019t have dared to think about five, or even three years ago.\u201d",

A monkey picking random stocks today made money.\n\nThat being said, we need to talk about BABA and yes it has a 12% run up in the last month but only 17% since the middle of the summer. No squiggly lines, all logic. Get on board and enjoy.  \n\n\n* China's Ecommerce - Clearly a huge upside here and where the Chinese government will continue to prop up large players like Jack Ma - why? Simple, the Renminbi, or Chinese Yuan for you glue eaters, is the defacto currency on the platform. This is part of a longer term destabilization of the USD as the reserve currency for all banks (and in no part due to Jpow brrrrring all over the place and slowly devaluing the buck).\n* Ant IPO - Jack Ma is taking this bad boy public and has restricted it to HK/Shanghai markets - why? They are not going to look into the sweetheart contracts and backroom deals from BABA and its supply chain, buyers, fintech violations, etc. Bonus plus - they have 9M buyers from retail (aka WSB China) on an 18-month lockup deal (WSJ link - [https://www.wsj.com/articles/ant-group-taps-millions-of-its-own-users-for-early-bird-ipo-funds-11602503774](https://www.wsj.com/articles/ant-group-taps-millions-of-its-own-users-for-early-bird-ipo-funds-11602503774)). That means a limited drop off on day 2 of IPO (sorry Snowflakes)\n* Marco Rubio - This fucking mouthbreather from Florida thinks the US has a right to stop a foreign company and foreign government's exchange listing. Jack Ma is happy to stay out and even regretted taking Alibaba public. 95% of transactions are done in China and its provinces, with 5% TOTAL coming from the rest of the world.

A full breakout measured move of pennant breakout puts the stock at $2.40 which will fill the gap from September 10.\n\n$ZYNE: Zynerba has a meeting upcoming with the FDA for transdermal cannabis cream: Zygel. Remember we buy the hype and sell the news. This is a swing with the potential to see $7.50-8.00 if approved by the FDA. The company is expected to meet with the FDA again by the end of the year and stop looks primed to move based upon that meeting.\n\n$RKT: Rocket has earnings upcoming on 11/10/20. The last ER they ran up to $35. Currently in a squeeze on the 1-hour chart. This will be a slow and steady gainer until ER so manage your stop loss appropriately.\n\n$NBY: Masks are being talked about everywhere being more and more essential due to more spiking of Covid-19. Local governments are calling for a federal mandate. Currently trading at the bottom of a repetitive range of .71 and .84. Even if no breakout, a move to .84 is a good 16.5% return.\n\n$CEI: Most are holding or swinging this into the upcoming merger news with Viking Energy. Recently broke out of a descending wedge into a pennant and now is about to break out of that pennant. Looks like it wants to test the old support line of the major trend as new resistance which would put the stock at $1.23.

        "selftext": "There's a huge amount of people in Crypto who think that Buy&amp;Hold is the best strategy. That might be true (especially when effort vs results are considered) for more mature markets, but I felt that in Crypto, simple Trend Following should be able to catch the bulk of the big moves and avoid most of the bear markets, so I ran some tests.\n\n# Strategies\n\nI picked some of the most basic Trend Following strategies with reasonable/round parameters:\n\n* **MA Crossover** (*rx\\_xma*)\u2014 when fast MA crosses over slow MA, go long. I will also use several different MAs for this \u2014 EMA, LRC (LinReg), HMA, WMA, KAMA, SuperSmoother, WVMA, TEMA, ZLEMA. `Parameters used: fast MA = 5d, slow MA = 40d`\n* **Supertrend** (*SupertrendXm*) \u2014 uses ATR to get band width, goes long if price over the band. `Parameters used: ATR period = 5d, band multiplier = 1.5/2/2.5`\n* **Bollinger Bands Breakout** (*rx\\_bb\\_bout*) \u2014 goes long when price over upper band. `Parameters used: BB period = 3d/5d, BB stddev = 2, MA = EMA/LRC/SuperSmoother`\n* **High/Low Breakout** (*hilo*) \u2014 goes long when price over previous X days high. Close position when under X days low. `Parameters used: period = 5d/10d`\n* **Linear Regression Slope** (*expreg\\_slope*) \u2014 goes long when slope of regression &gt; 0. `Parameters used: reg period = 5d/10d/15d`\n* **Single MA/Price Crossover** (*rx\\_xma\\_single*) \u2014 goes long when price crosses over MA. Same MAs as *rx\\_xma* will be used (EMA, LRC, etc). `Parameters used: reg period = 30d`\n* **Single MA Slope** (*rx\\_xma\\_slope*) \u2014 goes long when slope of MA &gt; 0. Same MAs as *rx\\_xma* will be used. `Parameters used: MA period = 20d, slope period = 1d`\n\n# Testing setup\n\n* Long only.\n* 0.10% commission.\n* Simple condition for entry (long), reverse for exit (close).\n* No stoplosses or take profits.\n* Use 100% of balance on each trade (will add position sizing in next post).\n* 60m candle size, except for *Supertrend* (1d to get daily ATR).\n\n# Coins and date ranges used\n\nI will use 25 of the \\~TOP50 coins and 3 different date ranges.

        "selftext": " ***PayPal (Nasdaq: PYPL) Q3 Earnings Play***\n\nPayPal earnings are coming up in october and the company has a lot of potential as they already crushed Q2 earnings.\n\n**General facts**\n\n* 73% YTD growth\n* $225B Market Cap\n* 2019 Revenue: $17.772B\n\nThe stock went down in [september](https://i.imgur.com/FHA4reY.png) and is now on for a earnings [run-up](https://i.imgur.com/uJ0M4QX.png). PayPal is currently sitting around $15 below its ATH. There is probably no need to explain what PayPal is or what it does.\n\nTotal Payment Volume (TPV)\n\n\"Total  Payment Volume or \"TPV\" is the value of payments, net of payment  reversals, successfully completed through our Payments Platform,  excluding transactions processed through our gateway products.\"\n\n\\--&gt; *Fees on money transactions*\n\nThat means that PayPal makes more money when more transactions are being made.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n1iw3tt13dr51.png?width=554&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0c5711eda5ad1f0422692e74985c16820a43f0fe\n\n**Free Cashflow (FCF)**\n\n$2.19B in Q2 with an increase 112% y/y\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2tr61wt23dr51.png?width=550&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1f3f312a637670c54ebbd70fb223f49b60e5d4fc\n\n\\--&gt;  Now you are probably asking yourself what all those fucking images and  words mean. It\u00b4s simple. PayPal has seen a lot of new users due to the  pandemic and everyone ordering their shit from Jeff Bezos. We are still  in a pandemic and the second wave is about to come. This means that more  and more people are going to use services like PayPal and as I stated  above; more users means more transactions which means more money for PayPal. So more tendies for us. [https://imgur.com/D9IMC8A](https://imgur.com/D9IMC8A)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/folqhri63dr51.png?width=596&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c762f9444098ded4754854951c09b6db37a3ad64\n\nSource:   \n\n[https://investorplace.com/2020/10/paypal-stock-will-rise-with-its-powerful-fcf-growth/](https://investorplace.com/2020/10/paypal-stock-will-rise-with-its-powerful-fcf-growth/)\n\nAs you can see when the TPV rises, the FCF rises as well. TPV will rise due to more and more people using PayPal due to the Pandemic. This will lead the FCF to rise as well and this makes stonks go up for us to make some tendies.\n\n**New Customers**\n\nPayPal has seen a rise in new accounts of 21.3 million in Q2.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6xkjfind3dr51.png?width=414&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c1c34c732b58eb2c3daa5581dffaa5d0a5ba565b\n\n**So how are we making tendies on the upcoming earnings?**\n\nPayPal is expecting \"strong momentum from Q2 to continue into Q3\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1slqhmre3dr51.png?width=478&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c9fa90bc61c64cebfb38f1b4d565bd4ab7172632\n\n*They will be crushing earnings* [*again*](https://i.imgur.com/iBhZqrE.png) *like they did in Q2 (actual Growth: 22% and 25%)*\n\nAnalysts have set a *price target around $220.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img n0vw56pf3dr51...*\n\n**Recent News**\n\n\"PayPal and Mastercard will continue the global expansion of its PayPal Business Debit Mastercard.\" [Source](https://www.mobilepaymentstoday.com/news/paypal-business-debit-mastercard-expands-european-market-reach/)\n\nThey also announced to support black communities and businesses. [Source](https://investor.paypal-corp.com/news-releases/news-release-details/paypal-announces-recipients-5-million-community-partner-grants)\n\nConclusion\n\nIt may not be the most exciting stock to play this month but it is a relatively safe play.\n\nPositions: 220c somewhere in November\n\nGood luck everyone",

        "selftext": "Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning October 26th, 2020.\n\n# **There\u2019s a big week ahead for the market with an earnings deluge, GDP data and stimulus negotiations  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/23/theres-a-big-week-ahead-for-the-market-with-an-earnings-deluge-gdp-data-and-stimulus-negotiations.html)**\n*****\n&gt; About a third of the S&amp;P 500 companies report earnings, including Apple and Microsoft, but uncertainty around stimulus and the presidential election could loom larger for markets in the week ahead.\n*****\n&gt; There is also important economic data on the calendar, with a first look at third-quarter gross domestic product Thursday. After the second quarter\u2019s shocking 31.4% decline following coronavirus shutdowns, the economy bounced back with growth of 32.5% expected in the third quarter, according to Refinitiv.\n*****\n&gt; Nearly 170 companies report earnings in the coming week, with a diverse group of blue chips among them, including Boeing, Caterpillar, Honeywell, and Merck. There is also a big showing from large tech names. Microsoft reports Tuesday, and Apple, Amazon, Alphabet and Facebook all report in a small window just after the market close on Thursday.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cFor some of these stocks that have run a long way, the bar for those stock to respond to good earnings is higher,\u201d said Julian Emanuel, head of equities and derivative strategy at BTIG.\n*****\n&gt; So far about 85% of S&amp;P companies that have reported earnings beat estimates, about 20 percentage points more than the long term average. Companies have been reporting earnings more than 16% above estimates, and the expectation is that earnings overall will be down about 18%, based on actual results and forecasts, according to I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv.\n*****\n&gt; The Dow Jones Industrial average fell 0.95% for the week, breaking a 3-week win streak as coronavirus fiscal negotiations dragged on and tech shares declined.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe\u2019ve offered compromises, the speaker on a number of issues is still dug in,\u201d said Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Friday. \u201cIf she wants to compromise, there will be a deal. But we\u2019ve made lots of progress in lots of areas, but there\u2019s still some significant areas that we\u2019re working through.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; His comments knocked stocks down a bit midday Friday.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIt\u2019s been a muted reaction to earnings overall,\u201d said Leo Grohowski, chief investment officer at BNY Mellon Wealth Management. \u201cSo I\u2019m disappointed, in a way, as a fundamentally focused chief investment officer, that the stimulus saga seems to be what it\u2019s all about day in and day out, hour by hour. It\u2019s the stimulus saga, the election looming and the Covid resurgence. Those three things have sort of made earnings a page four story.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; With a week to go before the Nov. 3 election, the market could be a bit more volatile, especially if the outcome looks increasingly less certain.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe market is going to focus on the state of stimulus. It\u2019s going to focus on whether the polls are tightening or widening with regard to the probability of having an unclear outcome, contested outcome or both,\u201d said Emanuel.\n*****\n&gt; Former vice president Joe Biden\u2019s lead has narrowed slightly but he is still ahead in swing state polls.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe are experiencing a little bit of the calm before the storm here. I do think we are going to get some 1%, 2% daily moves depending on the news...I think you could see a 3% to 5% down opening the following day [after the election] pretty easily,\u201d said Grohowski. \u201cI think the market has grown increasingly comfortable with a cleaner result, even if the cleaner result is an all blue result, which potentially would result in a higher tax regime.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Strategists say the market began to focus more on the possibility of a Democratic sweep, where Democrats take the White House and Congress. That could mean a bigger stimulus package, and some strategists believe tax hikes would be delayed until the economy is on more solid ground.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cAs we get closer to the election, we\u2019re likely to see more volatility no matter what the outcome,\u201d said Grohowski.\n*****\n&gt; Emanuel said investors are not adequately hedged for an uncertain outcome. \u201cActive managers have the most net long positions they\u2019ve had in a number of years because they\u2019re fearful of missing a year-end rally,\u201d said Emanuel. \u201cThe options market in no way, shape or form is telling you people are hedged right here. The market is discounting a slight volatility, not expected to be persistent into year end.\u201d\n*****\nEmanuel said the options market indicates investors do expect some volatility but not through year end, as some investors began hedging for several months ago.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWhat we see by and large is again the bump in volatility. It\u2019s really only anticipating a 2% or 3% move in the market either way, after the election, and then the expectation is to likely moderate after that,\u201d Emanuel said.\n*****\n&gt; The final trading day of October is on Friday, so there could also be some added volatility as fund managers readjust their portfolios between bonds and stocks. In the past week, Treasury yields broke out of a four-month range. The 10-year yield rose above 0.80% for the first time since June, and while it could move higher, strategists expect its move to be contained.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/67jHHD1.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/M13Rd10.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/ROEcV0O.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/zqElHD7.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/9iotJBk.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/lrNGV86.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/xGvBBYL.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/tR0QKgZ.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/uzQTMAY.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/iXkAMua.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/80umQkP.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/4BQenwD.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/rZFBz4D.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Nasdaq vs. Dow Outperformance\n\n&gt; You may not realize it, but while the Tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite is up a ridiculous 28% so far in 2020, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is still in the red on the year.\n\n&gt; Below is a table showing the Dow and Nasdaq's annual percentage change since 1972 when the Nasdaq came into existence. Were the year to end now, the Nasdaq would be outperforming the Dow by 28.65 percentage points. This would be the third strongest outperformance for the Nasdaq on record and the strongest since 1999 when the spread was 60 percentage points!\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/dowavg.png))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/downazpctchg.png))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/spreaduse.png))**\n\n&gt; Below are all years since 1972 in which the Nasdaq outperformed the Dow by at least ten percentage points. The Nasdaq has posted an annual gain of 20%+ in seventeen different years, but never in a year when the Dow was in the red. Probably the year that most resembles 2020 in terms of the performance spread is 1979 when the Nasdaq rose 28.11% and the Dow rose just 4.19%. Following that year in 1980, both the Dow and Nasdaq surged again and the Nasdaq outperformed by another 18.9 percentage points.\n\n&gt; Interestingly, of the twelve years where the Nasdaq outperformed the Dow by more than ten percentage points, the Nasdaq went on to beat the Dow again in the next year eleven out of twelve times. The only time we've seen the Nasdaq crumble versus the Dow in the following year was in 2000 after 1999's outperformance. In 1999, the Nasdaq beat the Dow by a humongous 60 percentage points. After that large gap, though, the Nasdaq ran out of gas in 2000 and underperformed the Dow by 33 percentage points when the Dot Com Bubble finally burst.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/outperfo.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Leading Indicators Show Slowing Pace of Economic Recovery\n\n&gt; The Federal Reserve\u2019s (Fed) Beige Book presented qualitative data that suggested the pace of the economic recovery had been tapering, as we discussed in the LPL Research blog, Beige Book Shows Pace of Recovery is Moderating, but now we have quantitative data that is confirming the survey data. The Conference Board\u2019s Leading Economic Index (LEI) increased 0.7% month over month in September to beat Bloomberg consensus expectations of 0.6%, but slowed after rising 1.4% in August and 2% in July.\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the leading indicators are still growing, but at a slower rate than the blistering pace seen in the initial months after emerging from lockdowns.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/10.23.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Growth in the LEI in September was primarily driven by the improvement in jobless claims, as well as continued strength in building permits for new private housing\u2014a trend that matches the behavioral shifts to accommodate work from home conditions during the pandemic. The pullback in stock prices last month and manufacturers\u2019 new orders were the lone detractors from the LEI in September.\n\n&gt; \u201cIt comes as no surprise that growth began to level off after the surge over the summer, and the softer LEI print is suggesting the economy could be losing momentum heading into the fourth quarter,\u201d said LPL Chief Investment Officer Burt White. \u201cHowever, despite the slowing momentum, we still expect solid economic growth in Q4, just not quite at the same rate in Q3.\u201d\n\n&gt; The decline in manufacturers\u2019 new orders is likely in relation to election uncertainty, which should prove transitory. However, the recent rise in COVID-19 cases in both Europe and the United States may cause business activity to slow, even if no additional lockdowns are mandated. As we head into the fourth quarter, we will continue to monitor real-time data for any additional clues about the pace of the economic recovery.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Halloween Trading Strategy: S&amp;P 500 Up 85% of the Time\n\n&gt; Next week provides a special short-term seasonal opportunity, one of the most consistent of the year. The last 4 trading days of October and the first 3 trading days of November have a stellar record the last 26 years. From the tables above &amp; below:\n\n&gt; * Dow up 77% of the time, 20 of last 26 years, average gain 2.05%.\n&gt; * S&amp;P up 85% of the time, 22 of last 26 years, average gain 2.11%.\n&gt; * NASDAQ up 85% of the time, 22 of last 26 years, average gain 2.67%.\n&gt; * Russell 2000 up 77% of the time, 20 of last 26 years, average gain 2.31%.\n\n&gt; Many refer to our Best Six Months Tactical Seasonal Switching Strategy as the Halloween Indicator or Halloween Strategy and of course \u201cSell in May\u201d. These catch phrases highlight our discovery that was first published in 1986 in the 1987 Stock Trader\u2019s Almanac that most of the market\u2019s gains have been made from October 31 to April 30, while the market tends to go sideways to down from May through October.\n\n&gt; Recent market weakness has held off our Seasonal MACD Buy Signal so far, but it could trigger anytime now. Uncertainty abounds with surging covid-19 cases, a heated presidential election and persistently elevated unemployment. However, each day that passes is one day closer to a covid-19 vaccine. Interest rates are low and ample liquidity is available to support the market and the economy. Additional fiscal stimulus also appears to be coming soon. Debate continues on the amount, but both parties do appear to agree it is needed in one form or another.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/79a067fc10d5ee40688ccec4ecb3fe2d/5899f7da34b8b8c0-e3/s500x750/4b0222300348a79e152bf80a85a41faf34984e3e.jpg))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/120a6a895b102be90ac05d6d5cbcdf2a/5899f7da34b8b8c0-26/s500x750/94df00168310f90a644b7aaa6f94820f807a4080.jpg))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/545ec0f231cb05daf30bc162745dc559/5899f7da34b8b8c0-25/s500x750/d84cab3903b5c92e70d470a07c469e2d646d38b8.jpg))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/a59dd0402f777bcb3f8fd3fb014a35ed/5899f7da34b8b8c0-82/s500x750/f54029e610ed2abc990f8b7c6ea9678925bc0a5a.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # \"Quitters\"\n\n&gt; Like an old pair of \"quitters\" that keep falling down because their elasticity is shot, the market has had its own trouble staying up over the last few trading days. Today isn't over yet, but if the S&amp;P 500 finishes around current levels it will mark the fourth straight day of finishing down at least half of one percent from its intraday high. Compared to the three days before, today's pullback from an intraday high has actually been pretty mild up to this point. Following Monday's 2%+ decline from the intraday high shortly after the open, yesterday, the S&amp;P 500 traded down close to 1% from its afternoon high. These two reversals followed Friday's late-day sell-off when the S&amp;P 500 finished the day down 0.75% from its intraday high.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/102120-Last-Four-Days1.png))**\n\n&gt; While it's disheartening to see the market erasing early gains as the day goes on, it's helpful to put the last four trading days into perspective. Over the last 25 years, it hasn't been uncommon for the S&amp;P 500 to finish the day down at least 0.5% from an intraday high for four days in a row. The current streak, if it holds, would be the 158th such streak of four or more days. That works out to more than six a year. There have also been a number of streaks that were much longer than the current one. In fact, it was only a month ago that the S&amp;P 500 went 11 straight days of finishing the day down at least 0.5% from its intraday high, and besides that streak, there have been five other streaks that spanned ten or more trading days.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/102120-Streaks.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # October Optimism For Homebuilders\n\n&gt; Given housing inventories remain historically low thanks to still strong demand, homebuilders have plenty to be optimistic about. The National Association of Home Builders (NAHB) has continued to show this strength as its monthly sentiment survey set a record high for the month of October. Back in August, the index tied the previous record level of 78 from December of 1998. Over the past two months, it has only raised that bar, coming in at 85 this month; 2 points above forecasts and last month's reading of 83.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/101920-NAHB-1.png))**\n\n&gt; The rise in the index comes on broad strength across each of the sub-indices. Present Sales, Future Sales, and Traffic all matched or made record highs in October. The only sub-index that was not higher was for Traffic, though, it was unchanged at a record high.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/101920-NAHB-Table1.png))**\n\n&gt; As for the look across each of the four US regions, the West and Northeast both saw sizeable upticks to new records, but sentiment in the Midwest and South were actually slightly lower. For the Northeast, this is the third record in a row. Meanwhile, the West's record high in October finally surpassed the prior high of 91 from October of 2005. Finally, even though sentiment fell in the Midwest and South, both remain at higher levels now than any month other than September's record highs.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/101920-NAHB-Regions.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending October 23rd, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED.)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 10.25.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED.)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$AAPL** \n&gt; * **$AMZN** \n&gt; * **$MSFT** \n&gt; * **$AMD** \n&gt; * **$UPS** \n&gt; * **$FB** \n&gt; * **$SHOP** \n&gt; * **$BA** \n&gt; * **$HAS** \n&gt; * **$PFE** \n&gt; * **$SMPL** \n&gt; * **$MMM** \n&gt; * **$TWLO** \n&gt; * **$GE** \n&gt; * **$FSLY** \n&gt; * **$PINS** \n&gt; * **$NOK** \n&gt; * **$TWTR** \n&gt; * **$MRNA** \n&gt; * **$CHGG** \n&gt; * **$ETSY** \n&gt; * **$SAP** \n&gt; * **$CAT** \n&gt; * **$LGND** \n&gt; * **$FVRR** \n&gt; * **$SPOT** \n&gt; * **$GOOGL** \n&gt; * **$LLY** \n&gt; * **$GILD** \n&gt; * **$RTX** \n&gt; * **$TDOC** \n&gt; * **$OSTK** \n&gt; * **$V** \n&gt; * **$ATVI** \n&gt; * **$MA** \n&gt; * **$XOM** \n&gt; * **$ABBV** \n&gt; * **$HCA** \n&gt; * **$SHW** \n&gt; * **$F** \n&gt; * **$NVS** \n&gt; * **$NRZ** \n&gt; * **$MRK**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/uzQTMAY.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/8wcVG2D.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 10.26.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/AaPzlgn.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 10.26.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/9GgF3Hb.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday  10.27.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/rwj1IS3.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 10.27.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/k4Rx5gI.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/YjH86d9.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 10.28.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/LUzqajk.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/NcPneVZ.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 10.28.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/AMyjDf6.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/312QBRU.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/mjgt9Gs.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 10.29.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/ZJ4Y4Vk.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/3pFmMuz.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/SZg9uyc.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 10.29.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/IGm07VC.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/IRNiQEm.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 10.30.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/SLRmoZE.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 10.30.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/7OhLjkG.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Apple, Inc. $115.04\n**Apple, Inc.

CHF Solutions recently received 180-day extension to meet Nasdaq minimum bid price requirement.\n\nOther than this, we have received little to no news from this company. Definitely a chart play. On the 180d chart, you can see a clear reversal happened last week, the question is how far can this push? Next line of resistance in the high 40\u2019s low 50\u2019s, with enough volume we could see this one have run similar to the one in pre-market.\n\n50 day moving average is approaching the 200 day moving average at a consistent rate. Has the possibility of crossing in the next few days. Going to check the overall direction at market open and decide whether or not it\u2019s good to get in this one a few days late.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Trend reversal](https://preview.redd.it/h5klrqqwq9r51.png?width=1604&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4556b678b9d692cc89d9acd788ee83d7003ce395)\n\n ***$TBLT:***\n\nAug. 25, 2020  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --  ToughBuilt Industries, Inc.  (\u201cToughBuilt\u201d) (NASDAQ: TBLT; TBLTW), an advanced product design, manufacture and international distributor with emphasis on innovative products currently focused on tools and other accessories for the professional and do-it-yourself construction industries, today announced their products have been accepted for immediate placement on www.rona.ca. \n\nRona.ca will carry 64 SKU\u2019s of ToughBuilt products, including but not limited to Cliptech tool belts, bags and totes, knee pads, sawhorses, and Miter Saw Stands. Rona Canadian customers will now have the option to purchase ToughBuilt products while they shop online at [www.rona.ca](http://www.rona.ca/).\n\nMichael Panosian , Chief Executive Officer of ToughBuilt, commented, \u201cWe are pleased to announce this new cooperation with Rona and look forward to adding more new items in fourth quarter. Rona\u2019s great distribution throughout  Canada  allows us to expand our brand awareness and increase our market share in this growing market. We also believe and look forward to a significant growth in both professional and DIY business in  Canada  within the second quarter and beyond.\u201d www.rona.ca is the online arm of  Rona, Inc. \n\nCreated in 1939, RONA is a banner of Lowe\u2019s  Canada , one of Canada\u2019s leading home improvement companies with head office located in  Boucherville, Quebec . Spanning the entire country, RONA\u2019s vast network of more than 375 stores includes both corporate stores and independent affiliated dealers. Known for its large in-store and online product selection as well as for its installation services, RONA also provides expert support and advice to its retail and pro customers for their building and renovation projects.\n\nQuarantine + home improvement go hand in hand, this much is obvious. On the 180d chart, the 50 day moving average just crossed the 200 day ma, and the last two trading days brought higher lows and higher highs. PR expected beginning of October. Be cautious with this one, as i am seeing this ticker blasted all over social media and reddit.

The deal closed this week. Shares plummeted 24.5% to close at  $18.69  on Wednesday, the stock's first day of trading under its new symbol, VLDR. Investors might have overreacted. Baird analyst Tristan Gerra launched coverage of the company Thursday, rating shares the equivalent of Buy. His target for the stock price is $28, about 50% higher than recent trading levels.\n\nLidar is, essentially, laser-based radar and part of the suite of sensors auto makers use to achieve advanced safety features, as well as create self- driving cars. Gerra expects sales to grow 55% a year on average for the next four years, hitting  $684 million  by 2024. Velodyne Lidar is well positioned to maintain its position as the volume and cost leader --  $100  announced \\[selling prices\\] -- as the company continues to optimize performance and costs along with its proprietary manufacturing,\" wrote Gerra in a Wednesday evening report beginning coverage of the stock. Lidar is expensive. And driving down sensor costs is key to adoption. \" Lidars will become an integral part of autonomous vehicles' sensor systems, owing to camera limitations,\" he said. Cameras can't function in all conditions.\n\nVelodyne says it has more than 300 customers, including auto makers. Gerra writes the company has engaged with Tesla (TSLA). Gerra is the only analyst covering Velodyne at the moment. The average stock in the Dow Jones Industrial Average has about 30 analysts.\n\nDespite the relative lack of coverage, Velodyne isn't small. Its market capitalization, based on the pro-forma total of shares outstanding post merger, is about  $3.3 billion . At the stock's recent high, the market value was more than $5.5 billion.\n\nHidden opportunity here. This stock took one hell of a slide downward during the month of September after the deal with GRAF closed, with a high of $32.75/share and now just trading at $17. Things I like about this company:\n\n* Product that solves an issue and is necessary (autonomous safety)\n* Engaged with big name customers (including Tesla)\n* Under most people\u2019s radar\n* 50% fall in one month is a clear overreaction \n* Merger implies later catalysts\n\nLong $VLDR\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Rough September](https://preview.redd.it/t75p7rh4r9r51.png?width=1608&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0b79facf1a9249fe39d834ae22e5b8f91744888e)\n\n**Never forget to do your own DD; remember: For all you know, all the stocks that I mention here will dip 90% tomorrow; Do your own DD, I'm not some magic fairy. Trading will never come this easy to you. If all the stocks on here went up, I'd be chilling on my own Island.**",

        "selftext": "Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/smallstreetbets. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning October 26th, 2020.\n\n# **There\u2019s a big week ahead for the market with an earnings deluge, GDP data and stimulus negotiations  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/23/theres-a-big-week-ahead-for-the-market-with-an-earnings-deluge-gdp-data-and-stimulus-negotiations.html)**\n*****\n&gt; About a third of the S&amp;P 500 companies report earnings, including Apple and Microsoft, but uncertainty around stimulus and the presidential election could loom larger for markets in the week ahead.\n*****\n&gt; There is also important economic data on the calendar, with a first look at third-quarter gross domestic product Thursday. After the second quarter\u2019s shocking 31.4% decline following coronavirus shutdowns, the economy bounced back with growth of 32.5% expected in the third quarter, according to Refinitiv.\n*****\n&gt; Nearly 170 companies report earnings in the coming week, with a diverse group of blue chips among them, including Boeing, Caterpillar, Honeywell, and Merck. There is also a big showing from large tech names. Microsoft reports Tuesday, and Apple, Amazon, Alphabet and Facebook all report in a small window just after the market close on Thursday.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cFor some of these stocks that have run a long way, the bar for those stock to respond to good earnings is higher,\u201d said Julian Emanuel, head of equities and derivative strategy at BTIG.\n*****\n&gt; So far about 85% of S&amp;P companies that have reported earnings beat estimates, about 20 percentage points more than the long term average. Companies have been reporting earnings more than 16% above estimates, and the expectation is that earnings overall will be down about 18%, based on actual results and forecasts, according to I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv.\n*****\n&gt; The Dow Jones Industrial average fell 0.95% for the week, breaking a 3-week win streak as coronavirus fiscal negotiations dragged on and tech shares declined.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe\u2019ve offered compromises, the speaker on a number of issues is still dug in,\u201d said Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Friday. \u201cIf she wants to compromise, there will be a deal. But we\u2019ve made lots of progress in lots of areas, but there\u2019s still some significant areas that we\u2019re working through.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; His comments knocked stocks down a bit midday Friday.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIt\u2019s been a muted reaction to earnings overall,\u201d said Leo Grohowski, chief investment officer at BNY Mellon Wealth Management. \u201cSo I\u2019m disappointed, in a way, as a fundamentally focused chief investment officer, that the stimulus saga seems to be what it\u2019s all about day in and day out, hour by hour. It\u2019s the stimulus saga, the election looming and the Covid resurgence. Those three things have sort of made earnings a page four story.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; With a week to go before the Nov. 3 election, the market could be a bit more volatile, especially if the outcome looks increasingly less certain.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe market is going to focus on the state of stimulus. It\u2019s going to focus on whether the polls are tightening or widening with regard to the probability of having an unclear outcome, contested outcome or both,\u201d said Emanuel.\n*****\n&gt; Former vice president Joe Biden\u2019s lead has narrowed slightly but he is still ahead in swing state polls.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe are experiencing a little bit of the calm before the storm here. I do think we are going to get some 1%, 2% daily moves depending on the news...I think you could see a 3% to 5% down opening the following day [after the election] pretty easily,\u201d said Grohowski. \u201cI think the market has grown increasingly comfortable with a cleaner result, even if the cleaner result is an all blue result, which potentially would result in a higher tax regime.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Strategists say the market began to focus more on the possibility of a Democratic sweep, where Democrats take the White House and Congress. That could mean a bigger stimulus package, and some strategists believe tax hikes would be delayed until the economy is on more solid ground.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cAs we get closer to the election, we\u2019re likely to see more volatility no matter what the outcome,\u201d said Grohowski.\n*****\n&gt; Emanuel said investors are not adequately hedged for an uncertain outcome. \u201cActive managers have the most net long positions they\u2019ve had in a number of years because they\u2019re fearful of missing a year-end rally,\u201d said Emanuel. \u201cThe options market in no way, shape or form is telling you people are hedged right here. The market is discounting a slight volatility, not expected to be persistent into year end.\u201d\n*****\nEmanuel said the options market indicates investors do expect some volatility but not through year end, as some investors began hedging for several months ago.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWhat we see by and large is again the bump in volatility. It\u2019s really only anticipating a 2% or 3% move in the market either way, after the election, and then the expectation is to likely moderate after that,\u201d Emanuel said.\n*****\n&gt; The final trading day of October is on Friday, so there could also be some added volatility as fund managers readjust their portfolios between bonds and stocks. In the past week, Treasury yields broke out of a four-month range. The 10-year yield rose above 0.80% for the first time since June, and while it could move higher, strategists expect its move to be contained.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/67jHHD1.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/M13Rd10.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/ROEcV0O.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/zqElHD7.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/9iotJBk.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/lrNGV86.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/xGvBBYL.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/tR0QKgZ.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/uzQTMAY.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/iXkAMua.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/80umQkP.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/4BQenwD.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/rZFBz4D.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Nasdaq vs. Dow Outperformance\n\n&gt; You may not realize it, but while the Tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite is up a ridiculous 28% so far in 2020, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is still in the red on the year.\n\n&gt; Below is a table showing the Dow and Nasdaq's annual percentage change since 1972 when the Nasdaq came into existence. Were the year to end now, the Nasdaq would be outperforming the Dow by 28.65 percentage points. This would be the third strongest outperformance for the Nasdaq on record and the strongest since 1999 when the spread was 60 percentage points!\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/dowavg.png))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/downazpctchg.png))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/spreaduse.png))**\n\n&gt; Below are all years since 1972 in which the Nasdaq outperformed the Dow by at least ten percentage points. The Nasdaq has posted an annual gain of 20%+ in seventeen different years, but never in a year when the Dow was in the red. Probably the year that most resembles 2020 in terms of the performance spread is 1979 when the Nasdaq rose 28.11% and the Dow rose just 4.19%. Following that year in 1980, both the Dow and Nasdaq surged again and the Nasdaq outperformed by another 18.9 percentage points.\n\n&gt; Interestingly, of the twelve years where the Nasdaq outperformed the Dow by more than ten percentage points, the Nasdaq went on to beat the Dow again in the next year eleven out of twelve times. The only time we've seen the Nasdaq crumble versus the Dow in the following year was in 2000 after 1999's outperformance. In 1999, the Nasdaq beat the Dow by a humongous 60 percentage points. After that large gap, though, the Nasdaq ran out of gas in 2000 and underperformed the Dow by 33 percentage points when the Dot Com Bubble finally burst.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/outperfo.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Leading Indicators Show Slowing Pace of Economic Recovery\n\n&gt; The Federal Reserve\u2019s (Fed) Beige Book presented qualitative data that suggested the pace of the economic recovery had been tapering, as we discussed in the LPL Research blog, Beige Book Shows Pace of Recovery is Moderating, but now we have quantitative data that is confirming the survey data. The Conference Board\u2019s Leading Economic Index (LEI) increased 0.7% month over month in September to beat Bloomberg consensus expectations of 0.6%, but slowed after rising 1.4% in August and 2% in July.\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the leading indicators are still growing, but at a slower rate than the blistering pace seen in the initial months after emerging from lockdowns.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/10.23.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Growth in the LEI in September was primarily driven by the improvement in jobless claims, as well as continued strength in building permits for new private housing\u2014a trend that matches the behavioral shifts to accommodate work from home conditions during the pandemic. The pullback in stock prices last month and manufacturers\u2019 new orders were the lone detractors from the LEI in September.\n\n&gt; \u201cIt comes as no surprise that growth began to level off after the surge over the summer, and the softer LEI print is suggesting the economy could be losing momentum heading into the fourth quarter,\u201d said LPL Chief Investment Officer Burt White. \u201cHowever, despite the slowing momentum, we still expect solid economic growth in Q4, just not quite at the same rate in Q3.\u201d\n\n&gt; The decline in manufacturers\u2019 new orders is likely in relation to election uncertainty, which should prove transitory. However, the recent rise in COVID-19 cases in both Europe and the United States may cause business activity to slow, even if no additional lockdowns are mandated. As we head into the fourth quarter, we will continue to monitor real-time data for any additional clues about the pace of the economic recovery.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Halloween Trading Strategy: S&amp;P 500 Up 85% of the Time\n\n&gt; Next week provides a special short-term seasonal opportunity, one of the most consistent of the year. The last 4 trading days of October and the first 3 trading days of November have a stellar record the last 26 years. From the tables above &amp; below:\n\n&gt; * Dow up 77% of the time, 20 of last 26 years, average gain 2.05%.\n&gt; * S&amp;P up 85% of the time, 22 of last 26 years, average gain 2.11%.\n&gt; * NASDAQ up 85% of the time, 22 of last 26 years, average gain 2.67%.\n&gt; * Russell 2000 up 77% of the time, 20 of last 26 years, average gain 2.31%.\n\n&gt; Many refer to our Best Six Months Tactical Seasonal Switching Strategy as the Halloween Indicator or Halloween Strategy and of course \u201cSell in May\u201d. These catch phrases highlight our discovery that was first published in 1986 in the 1987 Stock Trader\u2019s Almanac that most of the market\u2019s gains have been made from October 31 to April 30, while the market tends to go sideways to down from May through October.\n\n&gt; Recent market weakness has held off our Seasonal MACD Buy Signal so far, but it could trigger anytime now. Uncertainty abounds with surging covid-19 cases, a heated presidential election and persistently elevated unemployment. However, each day that passes is one day closer to a covid-19 vaccine. Interest rates are low and ample liquidity is available to support the market and the economy. Additional fiscal stimulus also appears to be coming soon. Debate continues on the amount, but both parties do appear to agree it is needed in one form or another.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/79a067fc10d5ee40688ccec4ecb3fe2d/5899f7da34b8b8c0-e3/s500x750/4b0222300348a79e152bf80a85a41faf34984e3e.jpg))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/120a6a895b102be90ac05d6d5cbcdf2a/5899f7da34b8b8c0-26/s500x750/94df00168310f90a644b7aaa6f94820f807a4080.jpg))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/545ec0f231cb05daf30bc162745dc559/5899f7da34b8b8c0-25/s500x750/d84cab3903b5c92e70d470a07c469e2d646d38b8.jpg))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/a59dd0402f777bcb3f8fd3fb014a35ed/5899f7da34b8b8c0-82/s500x750/f54029e610ed2abc990f8b7c6ea9678925bc0a5a.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # \"Quitters\"\n\n&gt; Like an old pair of \"quitters\" that keep falling down because their elasticity is shot, the market has had its own trouble staying up over the last few trading days. Today isn't over yet, but if the S&amp;P 500 finishes around current levels it will mark the fourth straight day of finishing down at least half of one percent from its intraday high. Compared to the three days before, today's pullback from an intraday high has actually been pretty mild up to this point. Following Monday's 2%+ decline from the intraday high shortly after the open, yesterday, the S&amp;P 500 traded down close to 1% from its afternoon high. These two reversals followed Friday's late-day sell-off when the S&amp;P 500 finished the day down 0.75% from its intraday high.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/102120-Last-Four-Days1.png))**\n\n&gt; While it's disheartening to see the market erasing early gains as the day goes on, it's helpful to put the last four trading days into perspective. Over the last 25 years, it hasn't been uncommon for the S&amp;P 500 to finish the day down at least 0.5% from an intraday high for four days in a row. The current streak, if it holds, would be the 158th such streak of four or more days. That works out to more than six a year. There have also been a number of streaks that were much longer than the current one. In fact, it was only a month ago that the S&amp;P 500 went 11 straight days of finishing the day down at least 0.5% from its intraday high, and besides that streak, there have been five other streaks that spanned ten or more trading days.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/102120-Streaks.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # October Optimism For Homebuilders\n\n&gt; Given housing inventories remain historically low thanks to still strong demand, homebuilders have plenty to be optimistic about. The National Association of Home Builders (NAHB) has continued to show this strength as its monthly sentiment survey set a record high for the month of October. Back in August, the index tied the previous record level of 78 from December of 1998. Over the past two months, it has only raised that bar, coming in at 85 this month; 2 points above forecasts and last month's reading of 83.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/101920-NAHB-1.png))**\n\n&gt; The rise in the index comes on broad strength across each of the sub-indices. Present Sales, Future Sales, and Traffic all matched or made record highs in October. The only sub-index that was not higher was for Traffic, though, it was unchanged at a record high.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/101920-NAHB-Table1.png))**\n\n&gt; As for the look across each of the four US regions, the West and Northeast both saw sizeable upticks to new records, but sentiment in the Midwest and South were actually slightly lower. For the Northeast, this is the third record in a row. Meanwhile, the West's record high in October finally surpassed the prior high of 91 from October of 2005. Finally, even though sentiment fell in the Midwest and South, both remain at higher levels now than any month other than September's record highs.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/101920-NAHB-Regions.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending October 23rd, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vePSziSYeBg))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 10.25.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED.)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$AAPL** \n&gt; * **$AMZN** \n&gt; * **$MSFT** \n&gt; * **$AMD** \n&gt; * **$UPS** \n&gt; * **$FB** \n&gt; * **$SHOP** \n&gt; * **$BA** \n&gt; * **$HAS** \n&gt; * **$PFE** \n&gt; * **$SMPL** \n&gt; * **$MMM** \n&gt; * **$TWLO** \n&gt; * **$GE** \n&gt; * **$FSLY** \n&gt; * **$PINS** \n&gt; * **$NOK** \n&gt; * **$TWTR** \n&gt; * **$MRNA** \n&gt; * **$CHGG** \n&gt; * **$ETSY** \n&gt; * **$SAP** \n&gt; * **$CAT** \n&gt; * **$LGND** \n&gt; * **$FVRR** \n&gt; * **$SPOT** \n&gt; * **$GOOGL** \n&gt; * **$LLY** \n&gt; * **$GILD** \n&gt; * **$RTX** \n&gt; * **$TDOC** \n&gt; * **$OSTK** \n&gt; * **$V** \n&gt; * **$ATVI** \n&gt; * **$MA** \n&gt; * **$XOM** \n&gt; * **$ABBV** \n&gt; * **$HCA** \n&gt; * **$SHW** \n&gt; * **$F** \n&gt; * **$NVS** \n&gt; * **$NRZ** \n&gt; * **$MRK**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/uzQTMAY.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/8wcVG2D.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 10.26.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/AaPzlgn.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 10.26.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/9GgF3Hb.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday  10.27.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/rwj1IS3.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 10.27.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/k4Rx5gI.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/YjH86d9.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 10.28.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/LUzqajk.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/NcPneVZ.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 10.28.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/AMyjDf6.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/312QBRU.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/mjgt9Gs.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 10.29.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/ZJ4Y4Vk.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/3pFmMuz.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/SZg9uyc.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 10.29.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/IGm07VC.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/IRNiQEm.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 10.30.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/SLRmoZE.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 10.30.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/7OhLjkG.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Apple, Inc. $115.04\n**Apple, Inc.

As it rounded at the bottom (bullish) I didnt jump out the window thinking oh this is the bottom. That's incorrect way to execute this winning strategy. Even tho it's a cheaper price. The probability of it reversing is only slightly greater with just one point of confluence. It started to curl up and broke above the neckline(resistance of a specified trend pattern) and came back to it to test as support at 1.20. second point of confluence. Bought in anticipation of high probability of it continuing up after. It continues to give confirmation. Golden crossover 4hr third point of confluence. Inverted H&amp;S playing out 4hr fourth point of confluence. Ema/Ma fanning 4hr fifth point of confluence. Bullish pin bar 4hr sixth point of confluence. Shall I continue? Any Expert ta trader will jump on this with only 4 points. There are 6+ hence",

        "selftext": "**Watchlist for 10/13/20** \n\n$NBY: Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, Amazon Prime Day will be held on 10/13-10/14, same as last night\u2019s watch. \n\n$NAKD: OVER 100 MILLION SHARES traded today! Looking for a price target of $0.19. Been on a downtrend for far too long, looking for a sympathy move for Amazon move along with other names like $DXLG, $MSN, and $ICON \n\n$WAFU: Halted up today with no news. Volume spiked and ran into after hours. Looking for continuation into tomorrow\u2019s premarket. The trend is turning back to bullish on a 4-hour slingshot. Thinking this can reach past highs at just under $15 with volume. \n\n$WIMI: Today WIMI ran to $8 on no news and slow day due to Columbus Day. Looking for a continuation of this momentum play with the Apple event happening tomorrow. This former low float running looking to gap up tomorrow in Charter 1\u2019s opinion. The price target is $10.50. \n\n$CEI: Most are holding or swinging this into the upcoming merger news with Viking Energy. Still looking for a price target of just under $3. \n\n$RIOT: Sympathy play with bitcoin and $MARA running today. Price target $4.50. \n\n$AAPL: BIG DAY tomorrow \u2013 iPhone 12 (5G) debut is at 6 PM. In my opinion, found support on the 50 MA @ $116. If the vast sell-off begins, it may discover second support of around $113. With all that being said, keep in mind many people bought cheap shares during Trump Tweet on 10/6. Price Target of $130 if all goes well. \n\n**Also on Watchlist for Gains:** \n\n$SNMP, $JFU, $IZEA, $LIZI, $FAMI, $RKT(longer swing)",

        "selftext": "Hey guys, my post aims more at international trades because the deal is with the currency exchanges and international transfer fees.\n\nI've recently acquired a decent sum of money (decent for me at least) - 13k USD. Before transferring it to my account at Swissquote (my broker) I decided to do a little experiment with exchange and transfer fees.\n\nI've sent small amounts to my account using 3 ways:\n\n1. Credit Card\\*\n2. Bank transfer\n3. Debit Card\\*\n\nHere are the results: (end currency: USD, start currency PLN - my home currency) \n\n1. Credit Card =&gt; sent 20USD =&gt; paid 4,05PLN/USD\n2. Bank transfer =&gt; sent 20USD =&gt; paid 4,03PLN/USD\n3. Debit Card =&gt; sent 20USD =&gt; paid 3,9PLN/USD\n\nAs you can see Debit Card is MASSIVELY winning - **it's 3,7%** cheaper than Credit Card\n\nIt means that I would've lost about **413USD** if I had sent it using the Credit Card.\n\nI've read about the fees and the numbers make sense but it's still crazy to me that I could lose that much money BEFORE even started trading it lol.\n\n\\*Both cards are from Mastercard\n\nAnyways, just thought I'd share this, maybe it helps someone.",

        "selftext": "\nFor Trading October 22nd\n   \nWHR HOME RUN NUMBERS\n \nCMG, TSLA, LVS All Beat\n \n \nClosed out TBT calls and waiting to re-enter..\n\nToday\u2019s market was another back and forth without much net change.  I know that many think that 100 or 200-point moves look like a lot but on a percentage basis it\u2019s less than 1%.  With \u201calgo\u2019s\u201d and buy and sell programs, that\u2019s not overwhelming.  At the end of the day the DJIA was -97.97 (.35%), NASDAQ -31.80 (.28%), S&amp;P 500 -7.56 (.22%), the Russell -13.93 (.86%) and the biggest loser was DJ Transports -135.28 (1.14%).  Market internals were 2:1 down on both NYSE and NASDAQ.  Only 7 stocks were up out of the DJIA with the big winner TRV adding 45 DP\u2019s and the loser was GS -33 DP\u2019s.  The rest were all up or down less than 20.  The lack of progress on any stimulus plans seems to be the main issue, and it concerns me greatly.  I\u2019m not so much concerned with poor holiday sales, but they clearly will suffer, but the jackasses in Washington have no idea what it means to be concerned with the rent, or food, or heat, and assuming that Biden gets elected, I wouldn\u2019t expect any action until mid-winter.  #TERMLIMITS.\n\nTonight\u2019s closing comment video: https://youtu.be/g-gP65lp96E\n \nSECTORS:  Earnings were the big movers again today with some big names putting out some big numbers.  The biggest winner that I keyed in upon was Whirlpool (WHR).  I should have seen that coming with all of the home repairs and upgrades, great housing numbers and easy credit terms.  They beat top and bottom lines and the stock had closed $196.83 -3.10 (1.55%) but after the numbers traded up to $216 and the last is $205.75 +5.82 (2.91%).  They had great metrics for their own brand as well as private label lines.  The all-time high of $217.00 was way back in early 2015.  Tesla beat and although their call hasn\u2019t taken place yet, the stock had a pretty calm day (for TSLA), finishing $422.64 +.70 but after the beat the stock traded to $442.00 and the last is $436.95 +15.01 (3.5%).  We\u2019ll have to see if Elon has \u201cone more thing\u201d to announce!  SNAP had great metrics and while it was $34.95 +6.50 this morning, it traded to $38.89 and finished $36.23 +7.78 (27.35%).\nCHIPOTLE (CMG) was a loser, although their numbers were good, with major continuing growth in digital and opening new stores.  I personally order from there and get it delivered within 25-30 minutes (for free) and love it.

        "selftext": " **FAANGs, retail led market gainers while energy continued recent declines:**\n\n* **Consumer discretionary** was the best sector with department stores, apparel and AMZN-US among gainers. BBB-US rose sharply following earnings beat. **Communication services** were supported by FAANGS strength. **Tech** finished ahead with semis and software among the best segments. **Consumer staples** were in line as big box, grocers and cosmetics gained though drug stores were lower and foods mixed. **Financials** lagged with custody banks and P/C insurers lower. **Industrials** were behind with machinery and multis lower though airlines stronger. **Healthcare** was lower on hospital and large cap pharma declines and mixed performance in med tech. **Materials** were off with non-ferrous metals (copper prices down sharply), global miners and chemicals showing some weakness. **Energy** was broadly lower with all sectors down sharply.\n\n**White House boosts fiscal stimulus offer to $1.6T:**\n\n* [Roll Call](https://www.rollcall.com/2020/09/30/exclusive-mnuchin-coronavirus-relief-plan-includes-more-state-local-funds/) reported that in recent negotiations with House Speaker Pelosi about a fifth coronavirus relief bill, Treasury Secretary Mnuchin raised the White House's offer to just over $1.6T. This is up from an original proposal of $1T though Mnuchin has previously expressed a willingness to go up to $1.5T. The new offer includes $250B in funding for state and local governments, up from $100B, but below the nearly $400B+ sought by Democrats in their latest proposal. It also features $400 a week of additional unemployment benefits, up from their prior $300 a week offer but still below the $600 sought by Democrats. Talks expected to continue today and despite the favorable market reaction, still skepticism there will be enough additional movement to get something done. [Politico](https://www.politico.com/playbook) discussed how Senate Republicans present another big obstacle, even if Trump prods them to do a deal.\n\n**ISM manufacturing index lost a little strength in September:**\n\n* **ISM Manufacturing Index** for September of 55.4 missed 56.3 estimate, down from prior month 56. New orders index down 7.4 at 60.2, production index down 2.3 at 61, employment index up 3.2 at 49.6, new export orders index up 1 at 54.3. The report indicated expansion in the economy for the fifth month since contraction in April with manufacturers becoming better at maintaining output in reconfigured factories. Elsewhere, September **IHS Markit final manufacturing PMI** of 53.2 slightly lower than flash 53.5 and above 53.1 in August. New orders upticked while output (fastest in ten months) and employment (second fastest since Nov-19) growth increased sharply. August **construction spending** of 1.4% m/m beat consensus and prior reading of 0.7%.\n\n**Initial jobless claims and August personal consumption better:**\n\n* Weekly **initial jobless claims** at 837K in the week ending 26-Sep, versus consensus of 850K and below prior week reading of 873K (revised up 3k). Largest increases in NY, GA, MA, NJ; largest decreases in MA, MI. Four-week average was 867K, down 12K from last week. **Continuing claims** for the week ending 19-Sep were lower at 11.767M vs consensus 12.275M and prior week's 12.747M (revised up by 167K). Elsewhere, August monthly **personal consumption expenditures** of +1.0% m/m, above consensus 0.7% following July's 1.5% gain (revised down 0.4%); **personal income** fell 2.7% m/m versus expected -2.5% and July's +0.5% (revised up 0.1%) as federal unemployment benefits rolled off. **Core** **pce deflator** of 0.3% m/m (0.33% unrounded) met consensus though July revised up a tick to 0.4%. On a y/y basis, the inflation measure was 1.6%, two tenths above expected and prior reading.\n\n**Corporate layoffs raise more concerns about protracted crisis:**\n\n* [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-09-30/disney-shell-cuts-mark-warning-sign-for-global-economic-rebound?sref=L75TRUmI) discussed how the tens of thousands of job cuts announced by blue-chip companies in a 24-hour span is a warning sign for the global economic recovery. Recent layoff announcements have come from Disney (DIS-US ), Goldman Sachs (GS-US ), Allstate (ALL-US ), Marathon Petroleum (MPC-US ), Royal Dutch Shell (RDS-GB ), Elanco (ELAN-US ), and the airlines. The article highlighted concerns that job losses have begun to spill over the from the service sector that initially suffered the brunt of the layoffs from the coronavirus pandemic with more companies now looking to protect margins. Cost-cutting has been a key component of the earnings resilience theme. Back in late August, a [WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/new-covid-19-layoffs-make-job-reductions-permanent-11598654257) article flagged concerns that a wave of corporate layoffs could be permanent as companies increasingly see the coronavirus pandemic as the driver of a more protracted economic downturn\n\n**Auto sector remains a recovery bright spot:**\n\n* [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-autos-sales/u-s-auto-sales-stay-on-recovery-path-despite-tight-inventory-idUSKBN26M4XB) and [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-10-01/fiat-chrysler-toyota-beat-3q-forecasts-auto-sales-update?sref=L75TRUmI) both discussed the recovery in the auto market over the course of Q3. General Motors (GM-US ), Fiat Chrysler (FCAU-US ) and Toyota (TM-US ) all reported better than expected results. GM also mentioned that sales improved sequentially each month within Q3 and that both industry and GM sales rebounded significantly in October, finishing the month with y/y sales increases. The articles highlighted strong consumer demand for SUVs, trucks and hybrids. These groups were longstanding outperformers before the coronavirus pandemic as well. Demand underpinned by a combination of broader economic recovery and low rates. A number of other companies with leverage to autos have also highlighted the sector recovery in their recent updates. These include dealers, semis and electronics.\n\n**Fed extends dividend and buyback restrictions on banks:**\n\n* Fed [announced ](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20200930b.htm)Wednesday after the close that none of the 33 banks with more than $100B of assets would be allowed to resume share repurchases in Q4 and that it would also maintain a cap on dividend payments. Fed said move intended to ensure the banks maintain a high level of capital resilience. Added that the capital positions of the big banks have remained strong during Q3 while such restrictions were in place. Move was widely expected by the Street. A number of banks that presented at the Barclays Global Financial Services Conference last month expressed an interest in resuming buyback activity as soon as possible. Capital return uncertainty has been an overhang on the group. The other big headwind has been lower NII guidance from softer loan demand and an uptick in repayments. However, banks have been more upbeat on asset quality.\n\n**Senate panel votes to subpoena tech executives:**\n\n* [The Hill](https://thehill.com/policy/technology/519101-senate-panel-votes-to-subpoena-big-tech-executives) noted that the Senate Commerce Committee voted Thursday to subpoena the CEOs of Twitter (TWTR-US ), Google (GOOGL-US ) and Facebook (FB-US ). The vote compels the CEOs to testify at a hearing on Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act that will discuss social media's alleged conservative bias. The move was previewed last week. DOJ has already recommended that Congress pare back Section 230 laws, which give sites broad immunity from lawsuits for words, images, and videos. Back in May, President Trump signed an executive order to limit protections for online platforms. [Axios](https://www.axios.com/congress-looks-to-squeeze-big-tech-ahead-of-election-8deb407a-8e2a-4989-9682-dade915583a8.html) recently discussed how it's nearly certain that neither a Section 230 reform bill from the Senate nor the antitrust legislation that could come out of the House will pass anytime soon. Market has also tended to ignore the continued pickup in regulatory scrutiny in favor of secular growth and disruption themes.\n\n**Mixed vaccine headlines:**\n\n* [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-09-30/oxford-astra-covid-vaccine-review-said-to-start-in-europe?srnd=premium-asia&amp;sref=L75TRUmI) reported European regulators set to announce an accelerated review of the coronavirus candidate from AstraZeneca (AZN-US ) and the University of Oxford. This will allow them to see trial data while the study is ongoing and potentially speed up the approval process. However, [Reuters](https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-health-coronavirus-vaccine-astrazenec/exclusive-fda-widens-u-s-safety-inquiry-into-astrazeneca-coronavirus-vaccine-sources-idUKKBN26L3T8) reported the FDA has broadened its investigation of a serious illness in the AstraZeneca trial and will look at data from earlier trials developed by the same scientists. Noted this raises likelihood of further delays for what has been one of the most advanced vaccine candidates. CEO of Moderna (MRNA-US ) told the [FT](https://www.ft.com/content/9b242ecc-3dce-4534-9171-cdf624468a2a) that his company would not be able to apply to the FDA for emergency use authorization of its coronavirus vaccine until at least late November. Added that he did not expect to have full approval for broad distribution until next spring. Timelines more in line with those of public health officials than Trump.",

        "selftext": "Summarized to save you time.\n\n**Still chatter about a broader stimulus bill, but even airline-only deal could be tough:**\n\n* [Politico](https://twitter.com/JakeSherman/status/1314208911654678530) said Treasury Secretary Mnuchin floated possibility of restarting broader stimulus talks in call with Speaker Pelosi last night. Then Trump told [Fox Business](https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/pelosi-stimulus-checks-donald-trump-1200) this morning \"a bigger deal\" involving $1,200 stimulus checks was possible. Comments come after Trump talked about halting negotiations only to suggest yesterday he wanted Congress to pass funding for airlines, PPP and another round of stimulus checks. However, prospects for any deal remain dim, especially as Pelosi castigated Trump today for walking away from necessary relief. Some resistance within the GOP for more spending on stimulus, and Senate Majority Leader McConnell likely reluctant to bring up any measure his caucus is uncertain to back. Note GOP Sens. Toomey and Lee released a [statement](https://www.toomey.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/toomey-and-lee-issue-statement-regarding-an-additional-round-of-taxpayer-funded-grants-for-airlines) saying Congress should not make targeted grants to airlines. Other hurdles include Congress being out of session, focus on upcoming SCOTUS hearings, and short calendar before Election Day.\n\n**Pence and Harris square off in vice presidential debate:**\n\n* VP Pence and Democratic candidate Kamala Harris debated in Salt Lake City on Wednesday ([WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/trumps-covid-19-diagnosis-amps-up-spotlight-on-vice-presidential-debate-11602084013)). Pence defended administration's pandemic handling while touting strong economic stewardship and renegotiated trade deals. Harris zeroed in on Trump's poor management of the coronavirus. Harris demurred when asked whether Biden would push to add more justices to the Supreme Court. Also skirted question on presidential succession if her running mate becomes incapacitated. When pressed Harris said Biden would not ban fracking (though Harris said in 2019 said she would ban the practice). Meanwhile, Pence dodged a question about how Trump would protect pre-existing conditions if Affordable Care Act is struck down by Supreme Court. Debate was more civil than the Trump-Biden confrontation last week. Trump and Biden to debate again on 15-Oct. Organizers said debate now scheduled to be virtual, though Trump said that is not acceptable.\n\n**Continuing jobless claims fell significantly while initial claims in line:**\n\n* Weekly **initial jobless claims** at 840K in the week ending 3-Oct, versus consensus of 837K and prior week's reading 849k (revised up 12k). Largest increases in MA, IL, NJ; largest decreases in TX, FL, GA. Four-week average was 857K, down 13K from last week. **Continuing claims** for the week ending 26-Sep were well lower at 10.976M vs consensus 11.500M and prior week's 11.979M (revised up by 212K). Individuals filing initial claims in the federal **Pandemic Unemployment Assistance** program for week ending 3-Oct fell to 464K from 509K in prior week. Persons claiming benefits in **all programs** for week ending 19-Sep declined to 25.505M from 26.509M in the prior week.\n\n**Trump credits Regeneron's antibody cocktail for his recovery from coronavirus:**\n\n* In a [video](https://www.twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1313959702104023047), President Trump talked up Regeneron's (REGN-US ) experimental monoclonal antibody cocktail, saying it was \"key\" to his recovery from coronavirus ([Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-10-07/trump-hails-antibody-treatment-wants-all-patients-to-have-it?srnd=politics-vp&amp;sref=J9GPLx1B)). Added that he is working on getting the treatment authorized and that it should be made free to Americans. REGN said presence of antibodies in Trump's blood could be result of its treatment, and it will seek EUA ([Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-10-08/regeneron-seeks-fda-emergency-clearance-for-covid-19-treatment?srnd=premium-asia&amp;sref=J9GPLx1B)). Trump mentioned Eli Lilly (LLY-US ), which has also requested EUA of its experimental antibody-based treatment ([WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/eli-lilly-asks-fda-to-authorize-covid-19-antibody-drug-11602074998?mod=hp_lead_pos4)). Trump's physician, Sean Conley, noted detectable levels of coronavirus antibodies were found in Monday's blood sample that weren't detected on Thursday. In his video, Trump also said vaccines should be approved before election. He again faulted for China for the virus and said Beijing would pay a big price.\n\n**Bond market impact of a Blue Wave scenario under increasing scrutiny:**\n\n* [FT](https://www.ft.com/content/6369516f-d4d1-4a31-817c-417585b0c24a) said that investors are increasingly focusing on the risk of a decline in long-term US government bond prices in anticipation of a more robust economic recovery and hefty additional government spending after November's presidential election. Noted long-dated Treasury yields have risen sharply since the start of the month to highest levels since June, while some fund managers warn this may be the start of a sharper selloff in US debt, though magnitude of a move depends on results of elections. Article cited Goldman Sachs strategists said investors could pull forward expectations for US rate rises on stimulus and vaccine developments, while Morgan Stanley strategists described a \"rates scare\" of a sudden move higher in yields that could take market by surprise. However, some strategists said the Fed would show little tolerance for destabilizing increase in rates that upends efforts to support the economy.\n\n**Fed unlikely to change QE strategy, at least for now:**\n\n* [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-fed-evans/fed-has-capacity-to-amp-up-bond-buying-but-no-need-now-evans-says-idUSKBN26S3K4?il=0) reported that Fed officials said the bank could ramp up its bond purchasing program or weight its purchases at the long end of the curve to push down further on borrowing costs. However, officials including Chicago's Evans (voter) said any changes are unlikely to happen in the short-term, with Evans saying it would be the Spring until he has a better sense of whether the Fed will need to give explicit guidance on the future pace or type of asset purchases. Also comes after yesterday's [September FOMC minutes](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomcminutes20200916.htm) showed little discussion over whether to adjust the Fed's current $120B per month pace of bond purchases. Despite cautious approach to QE, a Fed paper this week said that bond purchases equal to 30% of US economic output, or \\~$6.5T, are required to offset the impact of the Fed's benchmark rate already being near zero ([Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-10-07/top-fed-economist-says-much-more-qe-needed-to-offset-zero-bound?sref=J9GPLx1B)).\n\n**Economists warn of impact on economic growth if stimulus negotiations fail:**\n\n* [NY Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/07/business/second-stimulus-bill-fails-impact.html?action=click&amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;pgtype=Homepage) the latest to note the economic impact of the the end of stimulus, with loss of momentum likely to grow unless more aid doesn't arrive soon. Noted near universal agreement from economists who say more aid is needed for individuals, businesses, and local governments, and that the amount is less important than how fast and where the money is deployed. Also discussed aid to state and local governments, which economists say could drive sizable reduction in economic activity if left without additional support, though was a key area of disagreement in latest round of stimulus negotiations. Moody's last month said state and local governments will have budget shortfalls of $500B through summer 2022, assuming pandemic does not get worse. Biggest cuts expected to be in education and healthcare. Also highlighted worries further state spending reductions could prolong the economic downturn ([NY Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/07/business/state-budgets-coronavirus-aid.html)).\n\n**WSJ survey shows 43% of economists not expecting full labor market recovery until 2023:**\n\n* A [WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/wsj-survey-43-of-economists-dont-see-u-s-gaining-back-lost-jobs-until-2023-11602165600) survey showed a slower timeline for a labor market recovery than predicted six months ago, particularly in travel and leisure because of continued high coronavirus infection rates. Cited a potential worsening of the COVID-19 crisis as the flu season approaches with no coronavirus vaccine, a lack of fresh fiscal stimulus, and uncertainty around the election as factors weighing on the labor market recovery. Around 80% of economists said the current election process is introducing more uncertainty into financial markets compared with elections of recent decades, and 73% saying it was creating more uncertainty than usual for the economy. However, the survey showed more optimism around a GDP rebound, with \\~58% of those surveyed expecting economic output to return to its prior peak in Q1-19 by 2021, while \\~19% expect it to recover by Q1-22. On average, the economists expect GDP to contract 3.6% this year, followed by growth of 3.7% in 2021 and 3% in 2022.\n\n**US explores restricting Ant Group and Tencent payment systems:**\n\n* People familiar with the matter told [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-10-07/u-s-explores-restrictions-on-ant-group-tencent-payment-systems?sref=J9GPLx1B) Trump administration is exploring restrictions on Ant Group and Tencent Holdings (700-HK ) over concerns their digital payment platforms threaten US national security and give Beijing access to banking and personal data of hundreds of millions of people. Restrictions could involve putting both companies on Treasury Department's national list, which effectively bars firms from doing business with them. Such a move would risk angering China beyond its unhappiness over TikTok. Administration officials discussed idea of restrictions in a 30-Sep meeting, though a final decision isn't imminent with officials acknowledging difficulty in moving forward until a mechanism is established. Also, no indication idea has been presented to Trump.\n\n**BoE Governor Bailey expects a Brexit deal, willing to take more action:**\n\n* [Reuters](https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-boe-bailey/bank-of-englands-bailey-says-risks-are-very-much-to-the-downside-idUKKBN26T16D) cited comments by BoE Governor Bailey in the Yorkshire Post, who said he believed the UK and the EU can reach a deal, and in the best interests of both sides. He reiterated that while he would like to see Britain and the EU retain equivalent standards on financial services, it would be wrong to follow EU rules if it had no control over. Meanwhile, on the economic impact from the rising number of coronavirus cases, said it was likely to hurt economy, but less than initial surge earlier this year. In separate comments from SRB panel discussion, highlighted BoE was not out of firepower and would use if it needs in second and third wave of virus. Emphasized it must use policy actively and aggressively. Would use policy tools to the fullest extent possible to support economy ([Reuters](https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-boe-bailey-firepower/bank-of-england-not-out-of-firepower-bailey-says-idUKKBN26T1D1?il=0))\n\n**ECB minutes emphasize FX impact, warns on complacency:**\n\n* The [ECB](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/accounts/2020/html/ecb.mg201008~49aeff32e1.en.html) September minutes discussively extensively the impact of a strong euro on the inflation outlook. It highlighted that appreciation of the euro had a material impact on inflation and market positioning was tilted to further gains. It noted that inflation expectations remained close to historic lows, amplifying risks to anchoring and there was broad agreement that there was no room for complacency. Two main FX drivers were identified: a reversal of dollar safe haven flows and the decisive action taken by EU governments on fiscal policy. It was thought that in the prevailing environment of uncertainty, the best course of action was to keep a steady hand on policy. Some made the point that with tensions in the market subsiding the pace of monthly asset purchases could be reduced. On the policy options available, it pointed to a further cut in the policy rate and changes to the TLTROs.",

No that isn\u2019t reverse psychology.\n\nI\u2019d like the advice of some of the more seasoned traders in here on how they played it or would have played it this morning. \n\nI learn best by example and while I made 10% I could have made a LOT more. What did I miss that should have kept me in this?\n\n1. This is a crap China stock from what I can tell, would you even take the risk?\n\n2. I saw it about 9:40, waited for a dip and thought there was support so I bought at $5.00 Looks like I should have waited a bit longer but what signal did I miss? Needed more consolidation?\n\n3. I kept watching MACD, MA, and RSI so I held tough through the bottoms. This seems like I did the right thing. Dip vs Crash?\n\n4. I sold on a run up at $5.50 but it went further (and is still going as I write this) I really didn\u2019t think this could do $6 or $7 let alone $9! Again, what did I miss to indicate continuation?\n\n5. I saw short squeeze thrown around some on Twitter, does that seem accurate? \n\n6. Is this just heavily manipulated?\n\nI made 10% or $100 but left 60%+ on the table. These stocks will keep popping up I just want to try to play them better.\n\nThanks in advance.\n\n-DD",
