They're developing a platform that helps retail investors during their stock research process (Finding ideas/opportunities &amp; fundamentally researching them).  \nThe market research starts with personal interviews of millennial investors, who are actively invested in the stock market. If you get some time I'd love to conduct a short interview with you. The idea is to get educated and intelligent people to share a bit about how they go about their research. Not to give up too much, but rather to understand the investor's (you) behavior.  \n\n\n**If you think you can help me, feel free to comment on the post and I'll get in touch with you.**",
