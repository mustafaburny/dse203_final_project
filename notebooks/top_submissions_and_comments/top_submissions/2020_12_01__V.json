        "selftext": "GME Gang, a belated Merry Christmas \ud83c\udf84 \ud83c\udf81. Our savior, u/DeepFuckingValue, has shown us the light, and we must rejoice for him and his. Watch this ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aIVscxs9oJg&amp;t=11s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aIVscxs9oJg&amp;t=11s)) if you aren't familiar with the duality that is Roaring Kitty &amp; DFV. Smash that subscribe button and come back to reading (or ask a grown-up for help) these words.\n\nAs the semiliterate among you know, GameStop was scheduled to present on the last day of the ICR Conference (an investor conference for public &amp; private companies to show off how big their shlong is going to be when fully pumped) on January 13th, under the retail category. GameStop analyst extraordinaire (I won't speaketh the naughty Eeking Salpha words, mods) Justin Doperiala at DOMO Capital caught this minor, yet massive tweak.\n\nAt some point in the last few days, GameStop was shifted from the Retail &amp; Consumer category on the 13th to now present under the TECHNOLOGY category AH on Jan 11th. What does this mean? Management may not be-a-buncha-bitches after all. They clearly requested the category switch and have something TECHNOLOGY related to share. M&amp;A? Strategic shift/review? DIGITAL FIRST OMNI-CHANNEL?!? \n\nNow, #WeWantCohen and there's really nothing the boomers can say to change that. But what they can do, is speak boomerish in a way that the other market participants are made aware of the tech &amp; e-commerce opportunity that has not been valued in any way by the market (yes, even at $20/share the stock is an easy 2-3x on fundamentals over 2021-2022). GameStop's tens of millions of unique customer profiles and decades deep dataset are truly unique in the massive gaming industry.\n\nMelvin's put position was rolled to Jan21 (see pic), and management surely knows this. Could they be competent after all? Yes. This tells us they are dropping dongs. Now will Melvin bend over and take it? Doubtful. But don't believe the FUD. The upside opportunity and near term re-rating has been enhanced by Management's choice of the words TECHNOLOGY in this case.\n\nTL;DR: DFV is the man. GME is going much higher. I have thousands of shares and hundreds of ITM/ATM/OTM calls from Apr21 to Jan2023.\n\nP.S. \ud83d\ude80",

        "selftext": "Alright Degenerates- I posted a small little snippet a day or so ago about BFT. I wanted to do a bit of DD on BFT but also wanted to highlight something that was brought to my attention by a degenerate gambler. Lastly, I wanted to compile some good little snippets that have been put together by some other members as well as from the investor presentation.\n\n**Before reading further please understand the major Risks.**\n\n* This is SPAC with \\~10.00 NAV, if the deal falls through it could drop to 10.00 USD\n* The warrants could be very lucrative but they can be called and if a deal fails to materialize, these can become worthless.\n* If you're ok with the above risks, continue reading.\n\nKeep in mind that this merger is not complete, but the terms of the deal have been provided to investors and we will be able to either vote yes for the deal or vote no and redeem our shares in BFT for 10.00 cash. So there is downside to this play should the vote not go through or should the two entities terminate the agreement. Right now the downside is \\~3 dollars per share according to the close price from today.\n\n# MY POSITIONS - Mostly PRPL, PSTH and BFT/BFT.W\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ygrfo9vp0b461.jpg?width=1065&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ccd5cd4846d0cdcd6f1ed0e7a37548399a5cf461\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fd3o99vp0b461.jpg?width=1072&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=96faf02b077fc060c6025bbf7976b54edc6db493\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# The Customers and MOAT\n\n* Deep Customer Base with deep ties to gambling/betting industry with Deep penetration in Europe and growing customer bases around the world. Gambling is a tricky business and regulated differently than other industries. Many big players have avoided the industry and Paysafe has a great reputation and has become one of the early movers in the industry. The following are some notable customers.\n* &amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0bhbpnvr0b461.jpg?width=473&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=57ec71dfedd8c6eb1d604282021340fbd8d39025\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cno03rvr0b461.jpg?width=285&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4281b8e0db4783b7b4b6cce74f62f0694bdbb008\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* A gentleman u/dancinadventures posted this comment on my last post:\n\n\\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- *I actually know Paysafe and the usage quite well.*\n\n*PayPal has many restrictions in Europe regarding iGaming , so does Square.*\n\n*This is a big play on iGaming for those that aren\u2019t aware.*\n\n*I was a mid- high stakes online poker player through the 2010-2018. Played a variety of sites. : iPoker; PokerStars, Paddy, MicroGaming, 888, Party. Why so many sites? Because I was always on lookout for where the action was, if a big whale sat down at one online casino; you bet your sweet ass I\u2019m there.*\n\n*So let me give you my take as a consumer that\u2019s probably spent over $100,000 in transaction fees personally on Paysafe.*\n\n*This was one of the cheapest and fastest ways to move money around online.*\n\n*Unlike Stripe this which is against risky business such as CBD and gambling, paysafe is actually one of the leading payment providers in both UK/AUS / Ireland for iGaming.*\n\n*Big example is William Hill, Bet365, Bwin.*\n\n*Now why would you want to move money online around as a gambler ?*\n\n*Well, Visa/MC charge close to 50%-&gt;75% more, online casinos = the merchant. They don\u2019t wanna pay that, and in fact put limits on this type of payment processor. (Your visa\u2019s credit cards etc). If a punter deposits / withdraws frequently, the online casino could literally be on the hook for like 20-30% of the turnover throughout the gambler\u2019s period. (This assumes the gambler doesn\u2019t lose all his money per deposit.*\n\n*Imagine you\u2019re a professional sportsbettor, you\u2019re not loyal to one site. Different spreads / odds are offered on every site, you want to be able to move your money from one to another quickly and cheaply. Arbitrage opportunities do exist in sports betting as bookmakers hedge their books to minimize risk, diff frequencies of bets occur on each sports book; you get the idea.*\n\n*For recreational punters, it\u2019s simple: some sporting events that are smaller simply don\u2019t exist on one site that exist on another. Eg. Perhaps you using Pinnacle / 10dimes for low spreads on high volume events, but perhaps you want to gamble on live events on bet365 on another day, and bet ponies on Hill.*\n\n*What if you only have $5000 ? Giant pain in ass to deposit money to each site, paysafe lets you move it around easily.*\n\n*Should you use visa, you may get blocked from depositing on various sites; Bodog, WHill, Bet365 just to name a few. Withdrawals and clearing deposits with bank transfers or checks takes days-&gt; weeks and gamblers ain\u2019t gonna wait for that shit.*\n\n*You can also buy prepaid paysafe cards from stores if you don\u2019t wish to use your real credit card; and load that shit up.*\n\n*One of the biggest markets this is prominent in is South east Asia, they are some of the biggest punters and fucking loving gambling. Looking at you pinoys, Indonesians, Malays.

([Video interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfhgbZBWgBE)). The video covers a lot more than the article so I highly recommend watching that.\n\n&gt; \u201cThat has quieted down and we are in negotiations,\u201d she said. \u201cWe wanted to be fair and square with our partner, and I think things will work out.\u201d\n\nShe's expecting strong return on her funds:\n\n&gt;Wood said she\u2019s confident her investments will return **at least 20% annually**, more than **doubling** over the next five years. As one of the few female CEOs in finance, Wood prizes her performance. She also points to it as advice for other women in her field.\n\nHer biggest bet in the future is probably going to be in genomics (ARKG):\n\n&gt;Tesla\u2019s still in the running, but I would have to say the biggest upside surprises are going to come from the genomic space\n\n&gt;The next FANNGs are going to be from genomics (from the video)\n\nI know Resolute is painted as the bad guys here, but according to this article, they were the first big backers to invest in Ark, to give Cathie a chance:\n\n&gt;\u201cWe were quite the loss-making company, and I felt it acutely since I funded most of it for the first three years,\u201d Wood said. \u201cWe built it. They did not come.\u201d With no background in ETFs and only $40 million of assets after 2 1/2 years, Wood needed a partner to distribute Ark\u2019s products. That\u2019s how Resolute entered the picture. In 2016, it acquired a minority stake, including an option to buy control.\n\n\nArk is much bigger and more profitable than it appears.\n\n&gt;\u201cWe\u2019re up to $50 billion,\u201d Wood, Ark\u2019s chief executive officer, said in a Bloomberg \u201cFront Row\u201d interview. \u201cOur business is very profitable.\u201d In addition to the $30.5 billion of assets in its seven ETFs, Ark **manages accounts for retail and institutional clients** as well as funds in non-U.S. markets. Its ETF revenue alone adds up to at least $225 million a year.\n\nI didn't know Ark handles accounts for institutional clients. Does that represent any conflicts of interest (I assume not this is probably very common right?)\n\nJust wanted to share the news since I know many here were worried about this.",

        "selftext": "I saw Cathie's outlook on Genetics and AI combining, and did my research. It has me convinced I should go super long on ARKG. Here is a video from a [MIT AI Chad and MIT Gene Chad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=brslF-Cy3HU&amp;ab_channel=LexFridman) \\- the first of 3 on this podcast and my key takeaways were: Genes are cool as fuck. AI will do for the genome what it did for chess and Go. These companies have the potential to be the next FAANGs in exponential growth.\n\nThis isn't all some hype to make me shoot thiccer rope like Spiderman, but industrial level genetics engineering. Need gasoline? Modify a bacteria to eat plastic and shit gasoline. Need a new organ? Farm that shit off a super pig. Need a specific drug that's expensive to make? Modify a nonspecific fungal enzyme to biosynthesize it. There isn't just one good reason to be long here, there are tons. Shit will actually be a genomic revolution. I think the human genetics stuff is the least interesting actually because of how complicated it will be and all the regulations and red tape. Modifying bacteria/fungus and shit you can culture and scale is going to be the real money. If I could go more specific on those ideas I would but I'll take the ARKG basket for now.\n\n It's going to disrupt major industries, and I guarantee genetics will help us combat climate change. We'll make bacteria that act as carbon sinks, and then retarded companies will pay tons of moneys to offset their carbon footprint to some assholes with giant vats of this shit in some barren wasteland just eating carbon dioxide and farting oxygen. It's going to change our world and make every industry it touches a level of magnitude more productive. This is the type of generational investment that Apple in 1996 or Google at IPO would have been. \n\nThe keys to unlocking the 'genomic revolution' that ARKG wants are really just processing power and AI. Google is actually important here and will have a hand in the tech end. Deepmind just figured out protein folding. Remember in 2004 when we all tried to cure cancer by running spyware on our computers? It's fucking solved, proteins are solved. These are the building blocks of life and will give us tools to make new novel proteins that actually can turn us into stretch armstrong or make our dicks huge and so on. Now that we figured that out, the next step is learning what genes we can edit to start modifying proteins in our own bodies, or for more profit, bacteria/fungus. You can make a fucking enzyme that eats cancer. This shit is in the pipeline.\n\ntl;dr ARKG any strike. I'm in ARKG 105c 7/16 and wish I had more money to throw at it. There is nothing but room in this whole industry and it will change everything.",

        "selftext": "This is going to be the ultimate guide on ***what*** you should learn first starting from knowing absolutely nothing about investing to becoming an investor who can beat the market indexes. It doesn't matter if you invest in penny stocks or blue chips. The principles are all the same.\n\nThis is an opinionated guide. If you just want a resource unopinionated guide then check out this github:\n\n[https://github.com/ckz8780/market-toolkit](https://github.com/ckz8780/market-toolkit) (made by r/StockMarket &amp; u/ghostofgbt).\n\nCheck out the original post to keep updated on this guide as this subreddit does not allow cross-posting: [https://www.reddit.com/r/UndervaluedStonks/comments/kheec2/the\\_ultimate\\_fundamentals\\_guide\\_on\\_what\\_you\\_need/](https://www.reddit.com/r/UndervaluedStonks/comments/kheec2/the_ultimate_fundamentals_guide_on_what_you_need/)\n\nI will update it constantly in the future.\n\n# Prerequisites\n\n\\- There are no capital requirements to investing. In fact you should start learning as soon as possible because it takes time to become proficient at investing.\n\n\\- This guide is only for fundamentals as I specialize in fundamentals and not day trading, technical charting, cryptocurrencies or forex trading.\n\n\\- This guide is tailored towards people who want to individually pick stocks, if you solely do ETF's or index investing this guide is still useful to you but not aimed at you.\n\n\\- Investing should be done with disposable income. NOT with income you need such as rent money.\n\n\\- If you aren't willing to put in the time and effort that investing requires to beat the market indexes then you should stick to passive investing and just buy an index fund and forget about it for 20 years. This requires 0 effort but you will never beat 8% a year on average and you because you lack experience you may panic and sell at times when you shouldn't.\n\n# 1. Getting Started\n\nTo start off I would recommend watching this overview video, it quickly goes over the main stuff by legend investor Bill Ackman:\n\n[Bill Ackman: Everything You Need to Know About Stocks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEDIj9JBTC8)\n\nThen you should start reading, lots of reading and no big amounts of investing. You have to read books from other fundamental investors to have an idea of how they did it and the decades of accumulated experience of investing they have poured into that book. It's important to read the right books from authors who have a track record of beating the market, not just anybody. I have ordered this list in terms of ease of reading for newbie investors as well as priority:\n\n1. [Peter Lynch - One Up On Wall Street](https://www.amazon.co.uk/One-Up-Wall-Street-Fireside/dp/0743200403)\n2. [Peter Lynch - Beating the Street](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Beating-Street-Peter-Lynch/dp/0671891634)\n3. [Joel Greenblatt - The Little Book That Beats the Market](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Little-Beats-Market-Books-Profits-ebook/dp/B000YIUWFQ)\n\nThese 3 are all easy books for a beginner to get their feet wet and start off with some solid fundamentals. The harder books will come later.\n\n# 2. Relative Valuation Ratio's &amp; Technical Terms\n\nThere are **a ton** of financial terms and ratio's to learn such as PE, PEG, ROIC etc. The way to go about this is to learn these ratio's as you go when you encounter them in a book or your valuation and not just all at once. Investopedia usually has good explanations and videos of every term.\n\n\\- [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/)\n\nThe most important ratio's and relative valuations in my opinion are:\n\n\\- [Revenue](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/revenue.asp)\n\n\\- [Operating Margin](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/operatingmargin.asp)\n\n\\- [Operating Income](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/operatingincome.asp)\n\n\\- [ROIC](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/returnoninvestmentcapital.asp)\n\n\\- [WACC](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/wacc.asp) (not the CAPM Version)\n\n\\- [Price-to-operating Cash Flow](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/price-to-cash-flowratio.asp#:~:text=The%20price%2Dto%2Dcash%20flow%20(P%2FCF),and%20amortization%20to%20net%20income)\n\n\\- [Price-to-free Cash Flow](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pricetofreecashflow.asp)\n\n\\- [Price-to-owner-earnings](https://www.gurufocus.com/term/p2Owner_Earnings/PLA/Price-to-Owner-Earnings/)\n\n\\- [Debt-to-Equity](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/debtequityratio.asp)\n\n\\- [Interest Coverage](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/interestcoverageratio.asp)\n\n\\- [PEG](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pegratio.asp)\n\nThe most useless financial metric by far that way too many people use is the [PE ratio](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/price-earningsratio.asp), it is easily manipulated by accounting shenanigans, fluctuations in short term reporting and reinvesting companies such as Amazon. The PEG ratio also suffers from this but is better as it factors in growth.\n\nHere's an intro to relative valuations by Aswath Damoradan:\n\n[Session 14: Relative Valuation - First Principles (Free)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDZwqSierZ4)\n\n# 3. Reading Financial Statements\n\nInvesting is all about reading financial statements and understanding how to read them such as the 10-k, 10-Q etc. Pick any company, it doesn't matter which one but I recommend that you pick a simple company that you already use and know.\n\n**Income Statement**\n\n* [Session 2: The Income Statement (Free)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8wKr1QDSwg)\n\n**Statement of Cash Flows**\n\n* [Session 4: The Statement of Cash Flows (Free)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XobT12fvkXc&amp;t=1s)\n\n**The Balance Sheet**\n\n* [The Balance Sheet (Free)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSuc2HHQpxc&amp;t=1s)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Official RNS Reporting Sites**\n\nCompanies are required to file official reports with their countries regulator, in the U.S this is the SEC (apart from small companies that trade Over The Counter).A list of the most popular official sites, you can search for your company on here:\n\n\\- [SEC - United States Listed Stocks](https://www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/companysearch.html)\n\n\\- [OTC - United States OTC (Penny) stocks](https://www.otcmarkets.com/)\n\n\\- [LSE - UK Stocks](https://www.londonstockexchange.com/)\n\n\\- [ASX - Australian Stocks](https://www2.asx.com.au/)\n\n\\- [NZX - New Zealand Stocks](https://www.nzx.com/)\n\n\\- [TSX - Canadian Stocks](https://www.tsx.com/)\n\n\\- [CSE - Canadian Alternative Stocks](https://www.thecse.com/)\n\n\\- [EURONEXT - France, Ireland, Netherlands, Belgium, Portugal, Norway, Alt UK](https://www.euronext.com/en)\n\n\\- [GPW - Polish Stocks](https://www.gpw.pl/en-home)\n\n\\- [BOERSE FRANKFURT - German Stocks](https://www.boerse-frankfurt.de/en)\n\nFilings dump: [https://github.com/ckz8780/market-toolkit#filings](https://github.com/ckz8780/market-toolkit#filings)\n\nIt makes no sense to limit yourself to investing in one country only. A lot of bargains lay in other countries and you should expand your horizons to them and not just U.S stocks on Robinhood. So I added international links above too.\n\nA lot of the above sites also have email signups so you can be notified **instantly** when a companies publish a new report.\n\n# 4. Screeners\n\nYou should learn how to use screeners to narrow down stocks within your circle of competence and to the ratio's that you learned about in section 2. You want to screen for stocks that have below a certain threshold in x ratio, for example \\`PEG &lt; 1\\` which will screen all stocks for you that have a PEG of less than 1 (A PEG of &lt; 1 is theoretically undervalued...sometimes). It's best to combine multiple ratio's together to really narrow down to a select few companies to look at. This saves a bunch of time in finding potentially good companies.\n\nThe ratio's I like to use were all mentioned in section 2.\n\nScreeners dump:\n\n* [https://github.com/ckz8780/market-toolkit#scanners](https://github.com/ckz8780/market-toolkit#scanners)\n\nScreeners I personally like best:\n\n* [Finviz (Free)](https://finviz.com/screener.ashx)\n* [GuruFocus (Paid)](https://www.gurufocus.com/screener)\n\n# 5. Value Investing\n\nThe easiest way to make money long term in the stock market is to simple buy undervalued stocks, this ties into value investing. It's a simple concept where if you buy something undervalued then sooner or later the market will realize it's undervalued and correct accordingly (most times, sometimes it can stay undervalued forever). A lot of people mistake value investing for price to book ratio or some trash ratio like that, value investing is simply the concept of buying a stock for less than its intrinsic worth (i.e a margin of safety).\n\nTo get started I recommend you take a look at the top posts of all time on our sister sub: [https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/top/?t=all](https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/top/?t=all)\n\nThen you **must** read the following books as well:\n\n1. [Benjamin Graham - Intelligent Investor](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Intelligent-Investor-Definitive-Investing-Practical/dp/0060555661/ref=sr_1_3?dchild=1&amp;keywords=intelligent+investor+edition&amp;qid=1608384157&amp;sr=8-3)\n2. [Benjamin Graham - Security Analysis, Sixth Edition](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Security-Analysis-Foreword-Buffett-Editions/dp/0071592539)\n\nThese are the staples of value investing and what Warren Buffet read multiple times. They are difficult and long books to understand at first which is why I have put them in the 4th section so don't worry if you don't understand everything at first.\n\n# 6. Intrinsic Valuations\n\nThe most important part of this section in my opinion. If you understand how to intrinsically value a company then you understand when to buy and when to sell a company based on it's real value.\n\nThese differ from relative valuations such as the ratio's I posted above (PEG, PE etc) because here we are trying to find the intrinsic value to a company and NOT the relative value compared to it's peers. This is an important difference, for example in the 2001 dot com bubble you could have valued an insanely overvalued internet stock with a relative ratio such as Price-Operating-Cash-Flow and you may have found it to be better than it's peers. Just because it's better relatively than it's peers in it's industry does not mean a company is fair value.\n\n**Discounted Cash Flows Models**\n\nThe reason a lot of people do not like DCF's is because:\n\n1. They do not understand how to do them properly.\n2. The resources online are absolutely terrible for DCF's, most use CAPM (in my opinion, a completely flawed way to calculate your WACC).\n3. The templates are confusing.\n\nI felt the same way until I watched Aswath Damoradan's course on corporate finance.\n\nHere's the short course with 15 min long videos each:\n\n[Short Course on Valuation (Free)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znmQ7oMiQrM&amp;list=PLUkh9m2BorqnKWu0g5ZUps_CbQ-JGtbI9)\n\nHowever I highly recommend you do the entire university course (for free) because it's invaluable to understanding how to intrinsically value companies:\n\n[2019 Full Undergraduate Valuation Course (Free)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IxSvyBEK7s&amp;list=PLUkh9m2Borqn0rW96St_MJchWcjbdfWxT)\n\n[2019 Full MBA Valuation Course (Free)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiMw4AuMRlE&amp;list=PLUkh9m2Borqkr0lxe9WjH7cDBi4ZnZPOx)\n\nThere is a lot of cross-over between the above two playlists so once you do one course you can cherry pick videos from the other course.\n\n[Covid DCF Template Excel Spreadsheet (Free)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9GfXJ-IrSA&amp;list=PLUkh9m2Borqnk6tJUpGzN4RcDUBAjovqN&amp;index=4)\n\n[NYU - All Valuation Spreadsheets (Free)](http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/)\n\nI use the above first link for all my DCF's that you see me post here, if you see the description of the youtube video he links to the excel file template.The reason why I like it is because it's easy to use (he explains how to use it in his video) and it does not use the flawed CAPM model for calculating the WACC.\n\n**Dividend Discount Models**\n\nAn alternative way of getting the intrinsic value of a company. I do these very rarely so I'm no expert on them. I hope to up date this section in the future with more details.\n\n* [Aswath Damoradan - Ch 14: Dividend Discount Models](http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/pdfiles/valn2ed/ch14.pdf)\n\n# 7. Accounting\n\nTo be able to read Financial Statement numbers you really need to know how accounting works, both for GAAP (U.S) and IFRS (Most of Rest of World).\n\nThe reason why you should know accounting is not only to spot red flags in financial statements but also to understand the downsides of accounting. For example, only recently in 2018 were companies required to include Capital Leases in their balance sheets liabilities. Before then, companies could hide it in Off-Balance sheet statements that few people looked at, grossly inflating the viability of some businesses with heavy lease requirements.\n\n* [David Krug - Accounting 1 Full Course (Free)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkZ6Q67Q15E&amp;list=PL301238C9BC6E0B83)\n* [David Krug - Accounting 2 Full Course (Free)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cC9SZ3RC8Y&amp;list=PLHhe-2tIHRqEw5JRX6trtsLLlwwbpdXJX)\n* [Aswath Damoradan - Accounting 101 (Free)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbp3-AU9v_g&amp;list=PLUkh9m2BorqmKaLrNBjKtFDhpdFdi8f7C)\n* [Howard Schilit - Financial Shenanigans, How to Detect Accounting Gimmicks &amp; Fraud in Financial Reports](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Financial-Shenanigans-Accounting-Gimmicks-Reports/dp/0071703071)\n\nDavid Krug's courses are an in depth full courses on accounting. You may not have the time to learn accounting in full though so if you do not then I would recommend the Accounting 101 course which fast tracks you to learn only what you need for our purposes.\n\nHoward Schilit's book will give you a good overview into the most common financial accounting tricks that you can try and spot.\n\n# 8. Psychology of Investing\n\nI have put this at section 7 because it's had to quantify how much it can help you as it's different for each individual and also because psychology is a long term game with investing.\n\nThis is perhaps the most overlooked section though, most investors never bother to get their psych in order which is a big mistake usually because of overconfidence of their own abilities.\n\n* [The Little Book of Behavioral Investing: How not to be your own worst enemy](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Little-Book-Behavioral-Investing-Profits/dp/0470686022)\n* [The Behavioral Investor](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Behavioral-Investor-Daniel-Crosby/dp/0857196863/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;keywords=behavioural+investor&amp;qid=1608401405&amp;sr=8-1)\n\n# 9. Monte Carlo Simulations &amp; Data/Statistics\n\nThis section is completely optional and not necessary but allows you to fine tune your assumptions.\n\nSo monte-carlo simulations are simulations that run thousands of times on your valuation models (such as your DCF model) to simulate multiple cases in your models. So instead of just doing a bear case and a bull case in your DCF model you can run a monte-carlo simulation and give your boundaries for your inputs (e.g 25% with a std. deviation of +/- 5%) and you will get a range of different outputs, in our case estimated prices per share and then you can use the mean price as your estimated price per share.\n\n* [Aswath Damoradan - A Monte Carlo Simulation Guide (Free)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFd_qEpYFBc)\n* [Simular Monte Carlo Simulation Excel Plugin (Free)](https://www.simularsoft.com.ar/)\n* [RiskAMP Monte Carlo Simulation Excel](https://www.riskamp.com/)\n* [Comparison of Monte Carlo Excel Plugins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_risk_analysis_Microsoft_Excel_add-ins)\n* [Khan Academy - Probabilities and Statistics Full Course (Free)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzkc-qNVoOk&amp;list=PLC58778F28211FA19)\n\nWell... if you've made it this far then congratz. It's a lot to learn, basically a full time job to learn all of it. And that's the point, if it was easy everyone would be rich.\n\nA final point is that a lot of the above links are from prof. Aswath Damoradan. The reason is that I have found him to be the absolute best source of information in regards to valuation ever and everything he publishes is completely free.\n\nThanks!",

        "selftext": "\ud83d\ude80 **$PSTH \u2013 Activist investor Bill Ackman\u2019s Gigantic SPAC \u2013 Updated DD** \ud83d\ude80 \n\nI last wrote on PSTH roughly 30 days ago and at the time the SPAC was getting very little press attention at all. Ackman announced the SPAC in the spring of 2020 and it started trading in July at an NAV of $20. Ackman has steadily collected an impressive investor list, filled with long term and reputable investors.\n\nSince then and since my last post a lot has happened. This DD serves to provide an update and recap for those new to the stock and considering a play here.\n\n**TLDR;**\n\nPSTH is a gigantic SPAC with a reputable CEO and the most impressive investor list ever created. The company is on record for a Q1 announcement and is targeting a \u201cmature unicorn\u201d. At an NAV of $20, the downside risk is capped significantly while the upside potential is very high depending on target.\n\n**Background information and recent events**\n\n\u00b7 In July 2020, Bill Ackman went live with SPAC $PSTH \u2013 the SPAC raised $5B in proceeds with the option to take it to $7B (leveraging funds from PSCM, Ackman\u2019s hedge fund) making it the biggest SPAC ever created.\n\n\u00b7 In multiple interviews following the SPACs debut, Ackman has been clear about several things:\n\no He is hunting for a \u201cmature unicorn\u201d\n\no He has stipulated a predictable business is most ideal with steady cash flow or guarantees along the lines of predictable growth\n\no This means large cap, well run, asset light, family owned, high moat, company\n\no He has a buying power of approximately $7B dollars at present and is hoping to capture a minority stake of between 15-20% of a large enterprise. This means a valuation in the ballpark of $40B.\n\no He has delivered on developing an incredibly impressive list of investors thus far\n\no **Investors in the SPAC so far include:** \n\n\u00a7 Baupost Group (headed by Seth Klarman, $30B hedge fund manager, \u201cthe next Buffet\u201d and noted value investor) = $450M position\n\n\u00a7 Guggenheim Capital = $560M position\n\n\u00a7 Ontario Teachers Pension Plan = $290M position\n\n\u00a7 Soroban Capital = $290M position\n\n\u00a7 Wells Fargo = $290M position\n\n\u00a7 Kevin \u201cSharktank\u201d O\u2019Leary = undisclosed position to be reported in Q1\n\n\u00a7 Warren Buffet\u2019s position remains speculative. He recently left his JPM position and is secretly adding to a big position (pushing the filing deadline requirements as he does whenever he builds a big position as to not cause an overprice of the stock before he finishes buying). There is also a large undisclosed position in PSTH held by someone from Q3. This remains completely speculative and it may not be Buffet but another large stakeholder or pension fund.\n\n\u00a7 KEY Point: \\*\\*No other big banks have secured big positions in PSTH\\*\\*\n\no The investor list above is just a sample of the top holders. Each of these positions were made at the end of Q3 of this year. The stock has risen $2 or 10% of NAV since this time (not much considering the size and runway ahead).\n\n**PSTH SPAC Design**\n\n\u00b7 PSTH is called a SPAC, but as others have pointed out, it does not resemble any other SPAC, in size or design. Some details:\n\n\u00b7 PSTH incentivizes long-term holding and only dramatic upward shifts in the stock price through its unique \u201ctontine\u201d structure. Upon purchase of one common share and holding of that share through announcement and merger, owners receive 2/9 of a warrant with a strike of $23. Those who buy and sell on announcement bounce therefore give up that 2/9 and it goes back into the pool for those who hold through merger. What a lot of people are missing is what this means. It means that the ceiling for the value of that fractional warrant is unknown but at minimum is 2/9. If there was a minority sell off on announcement that 2/9 could increase to 3/9 or 4/9 warrant for those who stay in. This creates a wild incentive for long-term holding of the company and is referenced in the \"tontine\" name - look it up, pretty cool.\n\n**Targets**\n\nMuch speculation exists online as to what companies Ackman is targeting. Here are some key points:\n\n\u00b7 Earlier in the year he commented publicly on Air B&amp;B, Stripe and Bloomberg. He praised all three companies publicly.\n\n\u00b7 Since that interview, Air B&amp;B has gone public via IPO and notably lost out on $3.8B during the valuation process and IPO\n\n\u00b7 Stripe has generated intense interest online. Despite the hype, the Collison brothers (head of Stripe) have publicly commented via tweet that \u201cno such deal\u201d had been struck after a WSB twitter account congratulated the brother\u2019s in a silly way. Despite this, many (including me) believe that Stripe is still very much in play and that some of this is a negotiation tactic. When questioned on Stripe, Ackman was gracious but said that the company was not ready to go public, citing managerial and personnel deficits only. In the immediate aftermath of that comment (literally the next week), Stripe went on an insane hiring spree specific to Public Managerial positions. This has been documented extensively by u/YoloCapitalMgmt on twitter. Ackman is on record saying his biggest regret in investing was not getting in on MasterCard due to regulation uncertainty. He said the best investment you could ever make, assuming valuation made sense, was in a company that made royalties on others spending money. He has since commented that PSTH would very much be in favor of merging with a FINTECH. Big name FINTECH EXEC Jackie Reeses (former head of square) has been added to the board of PSTH, creating even more speculation around Stripe as a target).\n\n\u00b7 Bloomberg remains in play. There has been no definitive declination by Bloomberg and rumors in the past exist in both directions. Michael Bloomberg has both commented that he would not take the company public and that there could be interest in a minority stake being sold.\n\n\u00b7 Other potential targets that have been floated with little in the way of momentum include SpaceX, Fidelity, Inspire Brands and Subway.\n\n**Target summary based on my view**\n\nTargets in order of likelihood of Q1 merger announcement\n\n1. Bloomberg\n\n2. Stripe\n\n3. Fidelity \n\n**Bill Ackman**\n\nA few notes on the head of the SPAC, Ackman:\n\n\u00b7 A billionaire activist hedge fund manager with a highly interesting track record if you\u2019re interested in looking into it.\n\n\u00b7 He has had some misses in years gone by most notably Herbalife short (where he was correct but still lost money) and Valeant.\n\n\u00b7 In recent years he has mounted an insane comeback poster annualized return of 50 and 60%. \n\n\u00b7 Some of his most iconic recent plays include Chipotle (take a look at that story) and Canadian Pacific\n\n\u00b7 Notably he shorted the market prior to COVID, correctly predicting a financial collapse. Through the use of CDS (made popular during the 2008 financial crisis, he turned a $27M insurance policy into a $2.6B trade in March of this year. He subsequently used the funds to advance positions in high quality companies he was a holder of (when these stocks were at their absolute lows in March).\n\n**Some other notes**\n\nThis is a highly interesting play and to get in you are betting on Ackman and the impressive investor list he has obtained.\n\nWhile this isn\u2019t objective financial advice, this play is incredibly enticing and one worth looking into\n\n**Resources**\n\n\u00b7 Ackman interviews: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzz5SGpDrc4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzz5SGpDrc4) \n\n\u00b7 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmaCarSyBk4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmaCarSyBk4) \n\n\u00b7 Klarman position: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-does-seth-klarman-pershing-165111126.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-does-seth-klarman-pershing-165111126.html) \n\n\u00b7 Guggenheim position: [https://whalewisdom.com/schedule13d/view/guggenheim-capital-llc-sc-13g-2020-08-10-psthu](https://whalewisdom.com/schedule13d/view/guggenheim-capital-llc-sc-13g-2020-08-10-psthu) \n\n\u00b7 Buffet leaves JPM: [https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/warren-buffett-berkshire-hathaway-built-8-billion-jpmorgan-stake-slashed-2020-11-1029846193](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/warren-buffett-berkshire-hathaway-built-8-billion-jpmorgan-stake-slashed-2020-11-1029846193) \n\n\u00b7 Buffet secret position: [https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/17/warren-buffett-could-be-building-a-secret-position.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/17/warren-buffett-could-be-building-a-secret-position.html) \n\n\u00b7 PSTH (Ackman) recent letter to investors, see PSTH section: [https://assets.pershingsquareholdings.com/2020/08/28125504/Pershing-Square-Holdings-Ltd.-June-2020-Interim.pdf](https://assets.pershingsquareholdings.com/2020/08/28125504/Pershing-Square-Holdings-Ltd.-June-2020-Interim.pdf) \n\n\u00b7 My original DD (pinned by mods, is here): [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k3bf1o/psth\\_dd\\_klarman\\_buffet\\_ackman\\_the\\_unicorn\\_hunter/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k3bf1o/psth_dd_klarman_buffet_ackman_the_unicorn_hunter/) \n\n\u00b7 u/YoloCapitalMgmt on twitter provides an exceptional documentation around PSTH with a specific focus on Stripe: [https://twitter.com/yolocapitalmgmt?lang=en](https://twitter.com/yolocapitalmgmt?lang=en) \n\no Many of the other PSTH related twitter accounts are just opinion accounts attempting to either pump or dump specific stocks.

        "selftext": "[https://github.com/brndnmtthws/thetagang](https://github.com/brndnmtthws/thetagang)\n\nHey r/options,\n\nI posted this in a couple other subs and people liked it, so I wanted to share here for the benefit of anyone who may have missed it. I apologize sincerely if you've already seen it and now you're mad.\n\nAnyway, I wanted to automate one strategy for my main buy and hold account, and after a lot of messing about with various brokers/APIs I settled on IBKR for a variety of reasons. I decided to release the work I did as an open source project (you can maybe tell from my GitHub profile that I've been building software for a while, and I make things open source when I can).\n\nI wanted to solve these problems:\n\n* automate trading as much as possible to remove emotional mistakes/issues\n* work with broad market index funds, like SPY/QQQ/VTI/TLT/BND/whatever rather than individual stocks (I prefer not to mess with stocks unless I am o.k. with losing money)\n* provide more consistent returns while clipping some of the short term gains (we do this through covered calls)\n* taking advantage of the historical profitability of writing puts instead of buying the underlying (check out [this paper](https://cdn.cboe.com/resources/indices/documents/pap-assetconsultinggroup-cboe-feb2012.pdf))\n\nThis strategy is based on something called \"The Wheel\", which is useful when you a) want to own the underlying stock or ETF and 2) want to harvest from the volatility along the way. It's a somewhat passive strategy (compared to trying to guess uppies vs downies), which is my preferred way of investing.\n\nI won't go into a ton of detail here on why this works (or rather: IF it works), but you can check out content on YouTube or wherever to learn about 30 delta covered calls, 30 delta BuyWrite indices, theta decay, so on. From that you draw your own conclusions, and decide whether it's the right risk/reward profile.\n\n# Example Usage\n\nYou really need to read the project README to get a better sense of how to use it, but if you REALLY want to start quick you can run it with docker (you'll still need to create `thetagang.toml`, the config for the bot, and `config.ini` for IBC, samples of which can both be found in the project):\n\n    $ docker run --rm -it \\\n         -v ~/ibc:/ibc \\\n         brndnmtthws/thetagang:latest \\\n         --config /ibc/thetagang.toml",

        "selftext": "I know, I know. This has been talked about here for months now so bear with me as I needed a place to rant.\n\nLike many, I\u2019ve been following most of these EV companies since the summer. I mean who isn\u2019t enticed by seeing people make 300% in a month? It\u2019s completely rationale to want and get in on the action. Hell, I consider myself a conservative investor and even I\u2019ve made money on some of these names so I guess you can call me a hypocrite for even writing this.\n\nAt some point though one has to recognize just how irrational this has become. No revenue until 2025? No problem, here\u2019s a $17 BILLION market cap (talking about you quant scape). Go onto any EV/SPAC forum or Stocktwits and dare to question a valuation or why a stock tripled in a week. Ask about the potential dilution from warrants or PIPE shares set to go out. You\u2019ll likely just get a cocky response about having FOMO. These bulls are getting so caught up in the moment with short term gains, it reminds of those 2 Florida real estate guys from The Big Short:\n\nhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Mfu_iFS-UY8\n\nTake PIC for example. Traded around its NAV (basically a price floor before merger) for months before abruptly surging. Nothing has changed about the company -  no new catalysts other than rumors of a potential merger date which is widely expected. What is the rationale for paying double what the company was valued at a couple weeks ago? These SPACs are becoming commodities in a sense that it\u2019s solely supply/demand driven by hype and literally nothing else. \n\nI guess to me the worst part of all this and why it bothers me so much is that 99.9% of the time it will be that average Joe who eventually loses cause they put too much of their savings into a SPAC at $50 after watching some pumper from YouTube who used bright colors and 500% gains In the thumbnail. \n\nYou know who wins 99.9% of the time? Institutions and hedge funds. They are eating this up. Whether it is just shorting these risky stocks or taking advantage of the arb opportunities. I\u2019ve counted 6 recently merged SPACs that have significant spreads between the common stock and warrants. Arbitrageurs are locking in these gains - eventually taking retail money. \n\nI know I sound lame but this EV hype is getting dangerous and people need to be aware of how this will end. Some will make money short term and know when to get out but a lot of ignorant people are going to lose money once the dust settles with all this.\n\nThoughts?",

        "selftext": "Mis compas, mis amigos y amigas, fellow autists and retards of WSB,\n\nI return to you now with the second installation of my Big Crazy Idea about why Bill Ackman's SPAC, Pershing Square Tontine Holdings, and what is shaping up to be the most important company for the economic development of the internet, Stripe, could be teaming up to take steps in order to wrest back control of the financial system from the veritable freak show of private equity and investment banking, which I will collectively refer to as Big Capital. The previous post can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kbjpqy/an_alternative_hypothesis_for_psth_stripe_for_the/) and serves as an introductory foray into institutional financial crime. If you thought that one was long, strap the fuck in, because we're going deep into the muck with our third eyes wide open.\n\n#Big Capital, Big Crime, and Rivers of Blood\n\nThis section will attempt to provide some historical context on the history of Big Capital with a particular focus on the inextricable links between intelligence agencies (mainly the Central Intelligence Agency and its predecessor, the Office of Strategic Services) and Wall Street, starting around the time of World War II. It will lean heavily on the work of Michael S. Judge, whose podcast [Death is Just Around the Corner](https://www.patreon.com/deathcorner/) has become an integral part of my understanding of the nature of American imperialism, which has been largely scrubbed from the history books. It will also draw from excellent books including but not limited to Vincent Bevins' [The Jakarta Method](https://www.publicaffairsbooks.com/titles/vincent-bevins/the-jakarta-method/9781541724013/) and Stephen Kinzer's [The Brothers](https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250053121) and [Poisoner in Chief](https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250140432). In the interest of accessibility, I will be supplying Wikipedia articles for further reading, but with the caveat that [Wikipedia itself cowtows to the American imperial project](https://thegrayzone.com/2020/06/10/wikipedia-formally-censors-the-grayzone-as-regime-change-advocates-monopolize-editing/) and **should not be taken as an authoritative account of history.**\n\nI think the best place to start this story is with Allen Dulles, the longest serving director of the CIA, and his brother John Foster Dulles, who was Dwight Eisenhower's Secretary of State. Before joining the federal government, the Dulles brothers worked for [United Fruit Company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Fruit_Company), which is now known as Chiquita Brands International (yes, the \ud83c\udf4c company), where John served as legal counsel and Allen was on the board of directors. The United Fruit Company was a key driver of the CIA-led [1954 Guatemalan coup that ousted the democratically elected Jacobo Arbenz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1954_Guatemalan_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat) and replaced him with the dictator Carlos Castillo Armas, which will be a recurring theme in this missive. Put a pin in this for now, because we have to backtrack a little further first.\n\nIt is critical to understand that the CIA and the agencies that came before it, are deeply rooted in the boy's club of Wall Street from the years between World War I and World War II, and that pipeline catapulted people like [Prescott Bush](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prescott_Bush) (father of George H.W. Bush and grandfather of George W. Bush) to the highest levels of the American government. Most of these roaches skittered out of investment banks like [Brown Brothers Harriman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_Brothers_Harriman_%26_Co.) or law firms like [Sullivan &amp; Cromwell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sullivan_%26_Cromwell), both institutions that still stand to this day.\n\nPrescott Bush and the Dulles brothers were up to some real sketchy shit before, during, and after WWII, [having business ties to German industrialists that helped finance Hitler's rise to power and helping Nazis launder money and transport looted art and valuables through European banks](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/sep/25/usa.secondworldwar). Supreme Court Justice Arthur Goldberg even went so far to say that [\"The Dulles brothers were traitors.\"](http://libcom.org/library/making-killing-christian-dewar) Prescott and the Dulles brothers were probably not literally card-carrying Nazis, but the model of fusing big business and central government, which the CIA was based on and adheres to up to this very day, [**is explicitly fascist when going off of the dictionary definition of the word**](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/fascism) (read: not using it as a proxy for \"person I disagree with politically\" as it's so often used today). Did you know that the CIA has an active venture capital operation called [In-Q-Tel](https://www.iqt.org/) and that Palantir's only early investor besides Peter Thiel was [one and the same](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/10/21/magazine/palantir-alex-karp.html)? Now you do.\n\nIn the last days and immediate aftermath of WWII, the intelligence agencies spearheaded an effort by the US government called [Operation Paperclip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Paperclip), which was designed to save Nazi and Japanese scientists from the gallows and put them to work developing weapons programs in the US. [Wernher von Braun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wernher_von_Braun), chief architect of the Saturn V \ud83d\ude80 that sent Apollo to the \ud83c\udf11? Operation Paperclip. [Shiro Ishii](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shir%C5%8D_Ishii), a man who was loading grenades full of plague bacteria and sewing babies together and shit in Manchukuo (Japanese-occupied China)? Operation Paperclip.\n\nAt this point in the story, WWII is over and the USSR has become the Big Bad Mans of the time period from 1945 to 1991 that we collectively refer to as the Cold War. Unfortunately, the Cold War was not actually very cold, and instead took the shape of a seemingly endless series of proxy wars and regime change operations led by Western intelligence agencies attempting, with various degrees of success, to overthrow democratically elected leftists and appoint authoritarian leaders with the backing of weapons and money from the CIA. This is not an exhaustive list, but includes examples like the [1953 Iranian coup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1953_Iranian_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat) that overthrew Mohammad Mosaddegh and replaced him with Shah Pahlavi, the aforementioned 1954 Guatemalan coup, the [mass killings in Indonesia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesian_mass_killings_of_1965%E2%80%9366) that ultimately resulted in the removal of Sukarno and a 31 year military junta under Suharto, the [1973 Chilean coup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1973_Chilean_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat) that brought Augusto Pinochet to power, and both the [Korean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_War) and [Vietnam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_War) Wars, in which the greatest military in the world was epically pwned by a bunch of starving jungle fighters using slingshots and AK-47s.\n\nThe underlying reason for a lot of this carnage, besides the stated goal of beating back the spectre of communism or whatever the fuck? Resources. Iran had oil, Chile had nationalized the copper mines that Big Capital needed to fuel the electronics boom, and both the [Golden Triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Triangle_\\(Southeast_Asia\\)) and [Golden Crescent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Crescent) were fertile ground for growing opium, which was used to make the heroin the CIA trafficked all over the world and sold to buy weapons that they then gave to the dictators they propped up, sometimes [using the bodies of dead soldiers as mules](https://www.nytimes.com/1972/12/17/archives/drug-feared-sent-in-bodies-of-gis-court-told-that-smugglers-used.html). \n\nDoes any of this sound familiar and related to the current day? How about the overthrow of [Evo Morales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Bolivian_protests) in Bolivia, which was applauded by [Elon Musk](https://imgur.com/XCsXNTJ), who wants cheap access to their copper mines so he can make batteries for his shitty cars? How about the Forever War in the Middle East, which has effectively turned [Afghanistan into a narco-state?](https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/jan/09/how-the-heroin-trade-explains-the-us-uk-failure-in-afghanistan) How about the endless revolving door between the Pentagon, defense contractors, and the rest of the federal government, as exemplified most recently by the nomination of [Raytheon board member General Lloyd Austin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lloyd_Austin) to be Joe Biden's Secretary of Defense? That's right, you blue-pilled goldfish, the Democrats are not your friends either.\n\n#The Stripe and PSTH Angles\n\nAlright, enough psychic assault for the moment. Let's talk about Stripe for a bit. As stated previously, Stripe is building the infrastructure that the internet economy runs on. The Collison brothers, those cheeky little leprechauns, seem like they're wired pretty differently than most of the money grubbing bug people that inhabit Silicon Valley. [Take this clip of co-founder and CEO Patrick Collison](https://youtu.be/knXY3Rwtfww?t=1495) talking about the nature of motivation (listen through to ~27:20 at least). [Or this one of co-founder and president John Collison](https://youtu.be/N_W62v3RYwc?t=239) talking about the need to support small businesses who have been reamed by the pandemic and build Stripe bigger and better as a service to the small fish in the ocean (listen through to the end on this one).\n\nBill Ackman is a signatory on the [Giving Pledge](https://givingpledge.org/Pledger.aspx?id=157), and as discussed in the previous post, is also not your typical Wall Street swamp monster. He remarried last year and has a kid that's a little over a year old by this point. He deeply understands that the finance game is rigged against the little guys, that Big Capital has wrapped its disgusting slimy tentacles all over the world, and is choking more life out of it every single day. Could it be that he wants to do whatever he can to stop the world his kid will grow up in from devolving further into some kind of [Mad Max](https://imgur.com/HTpAmLG) scenario?\n\n[The order of operations for how PSTH is structured is flipped on its head](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/22/bill-ackman-and-tontine-holdings-rewrite-the-terms-for-spacs.html) from the way previous SPACs have been run by institutions like Goldman Sachs (remember, we hate them) with regard to sponsor compensation. Pershing Square isn't taking a thing until the investors in the SPAC see a 20% return, whereas most SPACs include clauses allowing the sponsors to snatch cheap warrants with their grubby little hands because they are run by unapologetic money pigs.\n\n#An Aside About C\u042fyptocurrency\n\nI, like most of you, am way too stupid to understand how the fuck c\u042fypto actually works on a fundamental level, but I think it's pretty clear that the reason it has value at all is as a hedge against total economic societal collapse like we've been seeing most recently in places like Venezuela, which underwent inflation to the tune of nearly [***54 million percent***](https://venezuelaaldia.com/2019/05/28/banco-central-venezuela-hiperinflacion-2016/) between 2016 and 2019. Hey, what the fuck is that Juan Guiado guy up to? Oh, [he's a CIA sock puppet](https://thegrayzone.com/2019/01/29/the-making-of-juan-guaido-how-the-us-regime-change-laboratory-created-venezuelas-coup-leader/).\n\nIt is interesting to note that Stripe used to support c\u042fypto but eliminated that functionality, at least directly, back in [2018](https://imgur.com/crnp9iJ). Patrick Collison used to talk about c\u042fypto frequently and would say things like [this](https://imgur.com/OSbi8uz) (take note of the date) but has been largely silent on the issue for years. I think it's possible that he and his brother have come around to thinking that while c\u042fypto is a heady big brain idea, it's too inaccessible for dummies like you and me, who just want to buy a cup of coffee without paying $20 in transaction fees. They could be trying to build a vanguard that would make such a thing unnecessary for a functioning society, a system that continues to run on dollars, euros, yen, and yuan. \n\nThat, and the original idea for c\u042fypto came from [another part of the bowels of the Deep State, the NSA](http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/classes/6.805/articles/money/nsamint/nsamint.htm). You know, that thing Edward Snowden revealed as spying on everyone all the time with the support of [the tech giants](https://imgur.com/buIPP1S), but we're mostly all cool with because hey, cat videos and free porn!\n\nI do have some suspicions about Snowden, being a former CIA contractor and all, and his insistence that privacy-minded folks use Tor, which is and always has been a [project of the Department of Defense and intelligence agencies](https://www.wired.com/story/cia-sets-up-shop-on-tor/). If you, like me, used c\u042fypto to buy drugs on the dark net back in the heady days of 2015 when they were basically crime bucks, you're also probably on a watchlist somewhere at Langley.\n\n#Conclusion\n\nIf you've reached this point without your eyes rolling back in your head and starting to drool, I sincerely applaud you \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f. I hope that you've learned something new and are now thinking about what bigger brains than you and I have, like those of Bill Ackman and the Collisons, could be trying to put out there in the world, if a PSTH + Stripe union is truly in the cards.\n\nI do find it quite interesting to look at the list of [Restricted Businesses](https://stripe.com/restricted-businesses) at Stripe. It includes a lot of things that Ackman has historically and more recently placed in his sights as the targets of his wrath, like multi-level marketing schemes and pseudopharmaceuticals (Herbalife) and pornography (Pornhub versus the credit card companies). There's also things you can extrapolate outward from if you want to get real wacky and use looser definitions, like \"gambling\" and \"get rich quick schemes\" (i.e. Robinhood).\n\nThank you for reading my brain ejaculation, and always remember: Big Brother is watching you.\n\n\n**TLDR: Reining in the types of financial crime that have created this fucked up world we're all stuck in is imperative to building a future that is better and more equitable for people all around the world, not just in the United States. A merger of Stripe with PSTH could represent a gigantic leap forward for driving a sword into the heart of the beast of Big Capital. You could get in now instead of the alternative that the traditional IPO process provides, where the big institutions get the first crack at everything and leave table scraps for the rest of us to fight over.

        "selftext": "Hey guys, hope everyone had a good Christmas and is enjoying some time off...\n\nI have previously speculated how Microvast will be a major player in the electrification of USA. I just found some articles I thought my current/potential investors would be interested in.\n\nMicrovast strategically made their headquarters in the states. They've tested their product in China and other countries for over 10 years, and are now ready to bring their operations into the US. I came across this article, and was pleasantly surprised hear their VP of marketing say \" Based on that success, we're moving forward with a major expansion of our U.S. activities, beginning with establishing a manufacturing facility, hiring more staff, and creating partnerships to support that effort.\" (1)\n\nI did not know this! I only speculated on it. It would make sense for them to establish production elsewhere first, perfect their product, and move into North America.  Article goes on to say \"This includes a primary emphasis on the e-bus sector, while also pursuing opportunities in truck electrification, mining processes, grid-scale energy storage, and other markets.\". Did you know the USA only has 700 electric buses? I wonder how many we will have in 2025 or 2030.\n\nThis will be huge. Microvast's factory in Germany took about 1 year to build and start operation (assuming they get going in Q1 21). Their current address is \" 12615 W AIRPORT BLVD SUGAR LAND TX 77478 SUGAR LAND TX 77478 USA\", it looks like this [https://gyazo.com/de049c3134518134c0add6c6b91c1c5b](https://gyazo.com/de049c3134518134c0add6c6b91c1c5b) and the front of the building is this company [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYmAksFCRW0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYmAksFCRW0).\n\nThe company on the front of the building (trans-market) only owns suite 600, ([https://transmarket.com/contact/](https://transmarket.com/contact/)) while Microvast owns the building. Not sure how this will pan out... maybe they build a factory, send their products to their building w trans-market, and go from there. This puzzle is a little bit more difficult to put together... \n\nNow before you say \"but Puts, this is a Chinese company, I do not trust\", maybe you can trust the US DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY and GM/ Fords' tech company USABC... Who awarded Microvast $1.5M and $4.5M, respectively. (2) (3)\n\nMy point is, this company will eventually be producing in 3 continents, and be a serious player in the global markets. \n\nTLDR buy THCB shares and warrants to exercise at a future date. :)\n\n1)  [https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2017/02/02/1254237/0/en/Microvast-Delivers-Record-Number-of-Electric-Buses-in-2016.html?fbclid=IwAR2z7s2dhcI9Yw0r6EI1UBoR0YmiHY3zsRwW8A-MJ9iB3qWdBZ0ZBRijfes](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2017/02/02/1254237/0/en/Microvast-Delivers-Record-Number-of-Electric-Buses-in-2016.html?fbclid=IwAR2z7s2dhcI9Yw0r6EI1UBoR0YmiHY3zsRwW8A-MJ9iB3qWdBZ0ZBRijfes)\n\n2) [https://chargedevs.com/newswire/doe-awards-19-million-for-extreme-fast-charging-research/](https://chargedevs.com/newswire/doe-awards-19-million-for-extreme-fast-charging-research/)\n\n3) [http://microvast.com/index.php/news/info/109](http://microvast.com/index.php/news/info/109)",

        "selftext": "What's up fellas at Options. I made a tool called [FD Ranker](https://www.swaggystocks.com/dashboard/stocklabs/fd-ranker) that logs the average IV of popular tickers. The tool is inclusive of almost 1,000 tickers now.\n\n**What is this tool good for**\n\nI posted in ThetaGang the list with HIGH IV options which is great for running the wheel or selling options. This list is an inverse of that list and displays tickers where IV is pretty low, thus, purchasing calls will likely be cheaper. For example, AAPL implied volatility right now is almost back to the pre-March lows. Remember a low IV can go lower and a high IV can go higher.

        "selftext": "[https://github.com/brndnmtthws/thetagang](https://github.com/brndnmtthws/thetagang)\n\nHey WSB,\n\nNot sure if this is WSB appropriate because it isn't YOLO material, but I thought I'd share anyways because people in the other trading subs liked it. Maybe some of you will eventually realize it's better to have money than not have money. I also like to share the good word and collect GitHub stars which I'm sure will be worth something some day.\n\nS'anyway, I wanted to automate one strategy for my main buy and hold account, and after a lot of messing about with various brokers/APIs I settled on IBKR for a variety of reasons. I decided to release the work I did as an open source project (you can maybe tell from my GitHub profile that I've been building software for a while, and I make things open source when I can).\n\nI wanted to solve these problems:\n\n* automate trading as much as possible to remove emotional mistakes/issues\n* work with broad market index funds, like SPY/QQQ/VTI/TLT/BND/whatever rather than individual stocks (I prefer not to mess with stocks unless I am o.k. with losing money)\n* provide more consistent returns while clipping some of the short term gains (we do this through covered calls)\n* taking advantage of the historical profitability of writing puts instead of buying the underlying (check out [this paper](https://cdn.cboe.com/resources/indices/documents/pap-assetconsultinggroup-cboe-feb2012.pdf))\n\nThis strategy is based on something called \"The Wheel\", which is useful when you a) want to own the underlying stock or ETF and 2) want to harvest from the volatility along the way. It's a somewhat passive strategy (compared to trying to guess uppies vs downies), which is my preferred way of investing.\n\nI won't go into a ton of detail here on why this works (or rather: IF it works), but you can check out content on YouTube or wherever to learn about 30 delta covered calls, 30 delta BuyWrite indices, theta decay, so on. From that you draw your own conclusions, and decide whether it's the right risk/reward profile.\n\n# Example Usage\n\nYou really need to read the project README to get a better sense of how to use it, but if you REALLY want to start quick you can run it with docker (you'll still need to create `thetagang.toml`, the config for the bot, and `config.ini` for IBC, samples of which can both be found in the project):\n\n    $ docker run --rm -it \\\n         -v ~/ibc:/ibc \\\n         brndnmtthws/thetagang:latest \\\n         --config /ibc/thetagang.toml\n\nI'll be around for a little while to take questions but if you don't make me feel cute I might delete later.",

There's been great DD on here. H C A C is a SPAC merging with Canoo, an EV company building customizable vehicles for retail, b2b, and industry that rely on a proprietary 'skateboard' (base electrical mainframe with a vehicle's four wheels) and 'top hat' system (different model builds, the 'type' of car, gets attached to the skateboard) that enables concurrent production lines. They can pump them out, and they have a deal with Hyundai to use Hyundai's production infrastructure. Production speed is already outpacing competition just in prototypes. The leadership is ex-BMW and -VW Audi designers/engineers.\n\nYou can check out the vehicle design here [https://www.canoo.com/design/](https://www.canoo.com/design/) and the real gold here [https://investors.canoo.com](https://investors.canoo.com), the investor presentation is unreal. They have a great product and plan to bring to market. Where they're really changing the game is the subscription model - \"transportation as service\" - which includes the vehicle, insurance, customizability (factory printed and applied, artist-designed skins). You should check it out for yourself and see if you like the vision. Regardless, price is going up. This is a company that can easily go to $50, surpass a NIO, and hit $100+ on Tesla's back.

        "selftext": " \n\n**Why We think TraceSafe (TSF.CSE) is one of the most undervalued Tech stocks in Canada**   \nCSE: TSF and OTCMKTS: UTOLF\n\n**Highlights of the Topic**\n\n* **Government Contracts (Hong Kong, Singapore, Cayman)**\n* **Venue Management (TD Gardens, IIHF World Junior Hockey Championships)**\n* **Peer Group Analysis**\n* **Summary/Conclusion**\n\n**Introduction:**\n\nTraceSafe owns 100% of the rights and interests in the real-time location tracking technology known as TraceSafe. TraceSafe includes original hardware such as wearable products, like a bracelet band or an access card, which has an embedded chip that can track the wearer's location to provide exposure notification.\n\nOver a 10-year period, TraceSafe has developed a robust and secure cloud-to-device platform that is designed to be highly flexible. This allows the technology to be tailored to many different applications, including contact tracing, quarantine management and real-time location services for company employees. This technology utilizes advanced low power bluetooth beacons and ensures both user privacy and administrative control. \n\nSo far the company has successfully deployed it\u2019s solutions across a variety of sectors.\n\n**Government Contracts** \\- TraceSafe has won government contracts in Cayman Islands, Singapore, and Hong Kong. These government contracts are lucrative as all travelers going to these destinations are required to self Quarantine with TraceSafe devices. So far, TraceSafe has been working together with the government of Hong Kong since March 2020, and more then 150,000 TraceSafe solutions have ben deployed. Additionally, contracts have been signed with hospitals in Singapore to track patients and beds, and a SE Asian Conglomerate (the customer has not disclosed for privacy reasons, but many people say that this client is Singapore Health Ministry). The Company is in active discussions with over 20 governments and is likely to announce a new deal with another government in Asia or North America. \n\n**TraceSafe and Hong Kong contract:**   \n[https://www.bloomberg.com/press-releases/2020-09-10/tracesafe-secures-new-order-in-hong-kong-for-quarantine-management-wristbands](https://www.bloomberg.com/press-releases/2020-09-10/tracesafe-secures-new-order-in-hong-kong-for-quarantine-management-wristbands)\n\n**TraceSafe Hong Kong Case Study:**   \n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUmyKaytCZc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUmyKaytCZc)\n\n**Hong Kong deal a \u2018catalyst\u2019 for future deals:**  \n[https://ca.proactiveinvestors.com/companies/news/930200/tracesafe--pandemic-has-become-a-catalyst--for-contact-tracing-bracelets-after-hong-kong-contract-930200.html](https://ca.proactiveinvestors.com/companies/news/930200/tracesafe--pandemic-has-become-a-catalyst--for-contact-tracing-bracelets-after-hong-kong-contract-930200.html)\n\n**TraceSafe order with Southeast Asian conglomerate:**  \n[https://www.accesswire.com/607388/TraceSafe-Awarded-Large-Scale-Order-from-Southeast-Asian-Conglomerate](https://www.accesswire.com/607388/TraceSafe-Awarded-Large-Scale-Order-from-Southeast-Asian-Conglomerate)\n\n**Venue Management** \\- Venues were hard hit by Covid with many sports teams experiencing significant financial distress as they mainly had to cease operations, and can no longer have fans at games. TraceSafe has inked contracts with the IIHF World Junior Hockey Tournament in Edmonton, Canada TD Gardens in Boston and Lampert Stadium in Toronto (Toronto Wolfpack rugby team). Getting approved for both TD Gardens and the World Juniors is a big deal as it was approved by Hockey Canada and likely points to potentially working with teams from the NBA or NHL in 2021. In addition to the covid use case, TraceSafe bracelets can be outfitted with payment capabilities to use for Concession stands. Privately held Delaware North owns TD Gardens, and is one of the biggest private hospitality and restaurant companies in the world (as per Forbes). If all of these deals are successful, it sets the stage for TraceSafe to work with some of the biggest sports and venue companies in the world.   \nThe deal with Hockey Canada involves a partnership with one of Canada\u2019s biggest telecommunications providers, Telus. Powered by Telus\u2019 world class wireless network, Tracesafe technology is deployed across the tournament bubble to provide quarantine management and monitoring of exposures. There are no other contact tracing companies in Canada that have partnered with a company of Telus\u2019 magnitude, and it is expected that this partnership will continue as TraceSafe solutions are deployed among Telus\u2019 corporate clients and employees.   \nHockey Canada, IIHF, Telus, TD Gardens (Delaware North)...the clients don\u2019t get much bigger and better than this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/o2txn3594r661.png?width=262&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8d6ed5e021d0850a986de3ca9c1a338a2a402ce6\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/posbfr2a4r661.png?width=761&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5e0339ea4d1b8816681f9e68720f6899eef9f3d5\n\n**TraceSafe and Telus IoT marketplace:**  \n[https://www.marketwatch.com/press-release/tracesafe-approved-for-nationwide-corporate-sales-in-telus-iot-marketplace-2020-12-07](https://www.marketwatch.com/press-release/tracesafe-approved-for-nationwide-corporate-sales-in-telus-iot-marketplace-2020-12-07)\n\n**TraceSafe and IIHF World Junior Hockey Championships:**   \n[https://ca.sports.yahoo.com/news/tracesafe-contact-tracing-2021-iihf-120000807.html](https://ca.sports.yahoo.com/news/tracesafe-contact-tracing-2021-iihf-120000807.html)  \n**TraceSafe partnership with Telus for IIHF World Juniors:**   \n[https://www.telus.com/en/about/news-and-events/media-releases/tracesafe-and-telus-iot-solutions-are-safeguarding-the-iihf-world-junior-championship-bubble](https://www.telus.com/en/about/news-and-events/media-releases/tracesafe-and-telus-iot-solutions-are-safeguarding-the-iihf-world-junior-championship-bubble)\n\n**TraceSafe and TD Gardens:**   \n[https://www.sporttechie.com/tracesafe-contact-tracing-deployed-at-bostons-td-garden](https://www.sporttechie.com/tracesafe-contact-tracing-deployed-at-bostons-td-garden)\n\n**Enterprise Management:** Enterprise in the biggest opportunity as the Private Sector dwarfs the public for  cases. TraceSafe has begun to work with one of Singapore\u2019s biggest construction companies, Boustead Construction. This sets the stage for further deals in Asia within the construction or office segment. TraceSafe technology can be used within this segment to provide location tracking, and greater insights into workplace habits and safety of workers. It becomes a big data play at this point. \n\n**Market Size**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tmgfvmsa4r661.png?width=982&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=42a3fdc47ad0e494d7b027e2680e12bb4bf51846\n\nThe markets TraceSafe operates in are massive with Enterprise Contract Tracing &amp; Wearable Tech being by far the biggest markets. \n\nOn the enterprise front, TraceSafe signed a deal with UKG which is a company built by the merger of Kronos and a Florida based software provider called Ultimate Software. The company is one of the biggest cloud computing companies in the world with top-tier clients that include Tesla, Marriott, Samsung, Yamaha, Sony Music, The Salvation Army, Miami Dolphins, Phoenix Suns, Revlon. Given the huge number of employees that these companies employ. We anticipate significant revenues to start showing up in Q1 from these customers and more deals in the Enterprise Space as a result of this partnership.\n\n**Airbeam Stake**\n\nTraceSafe currently owns a 13.5% stake in a company called Airbeam that is a 5G smart cities enabler built by former Qualcomm execs. Airbeam is due to IPO in Q1 2021 and the company is currently valued between 200-400M. This puts TraceSafe ownership around 27-54M. Wayne Lloyd announced a decision to issue Airbeam shares via Special Dividend to TraceSafe shareholders once the company goes  public. \n\nBelow is a calculation of how big this dividend will be given a few different Airbeam Valuation scenarios. \n\nAirbeam Valuation &amp; Expected $TSF Special Dividend\n\n150M Valuation = $0.57  per TSF Share\n\n200M Valuation = $0.76 per TSF Share\n\n300M Valuation = $1.14 per TSF Share\n\n400M Valuation = $1.52 per TSF Share\n\n**Comparison of the Competitors**  \n Now let\u2019s compare the Valuations of the TraceSafe\u2019s closest competitors (FaceDrive, Loop Insights)  \n*TraceSafe (TSF)*  \nMarket Cap: 22 Million  \n**Q3 Revenues: $1.1 Million (100% growth over Q2 with revenue only partly recognized for Hong Kong contract)**  \n**Shares Out: 35 million**\n\n*FaceDrive (FD)*\n\nMarket Cap: 1.55 Billion  \n**Q3 Revenues: $266,460**  \n**Shares Out: 94 million**\n\n*Loop Insights (MTRX)* \n\nMarket Cap: 230 Million  \n**Q3 Revenues: $0**  \n**Shares Out: 106 million**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ob2vxspb4r661.png?width=1220&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1cdd62706b3691499109aaf4ff6d9c3fdb738d8e\n\nAs you can see from the comparison, the contrast in valuations is quite large. Although it speaks to the bloated overvaluation in both $FD and $MTRX, it also underscores how grossly undervalued TraceSafe is as compared to Loop and FaceDrive, which have spent millions of marketing. Facedrive in particular spent over $8million on marketing in June 2020. \n\n**Summary/Conclusion:**   \n*Growing Revenues and Bargain Valuation of Tracesafe*\n\nSo far, TraceSafe has advanced from the Proof of Concept phase and is growing revenues rapidly. Q3 saw Revenues increase an 100% with Q4 Revenues expected to be around 2 Million, which is another 100% Increase. Based on this impressive growth, the market currently is giving TraceSafe around a  4x Sales Multiple. Given QoQ Revenue growth of 100%, this doesn\u2019t seem justified at all. \n\n* **Growing Margins are increasing profitability and will see the Company become Cash-flow positive in 2021.** \n* **TraceSafe is diversifying their product line-up to include Venues, Cruise Lines, Construction Sites and well poised to capitalize in 2021.**\n* **TraceSafe\u2019s stake in Airbeam is now worth 40.5M-54.0M and management is likely to issue Airbeam shares to shareholders.** \n* **Market for Enterprise Wearables expanding at 41% a year bodes well for TraceSafe**\n\nWe feel that TraceSafe\u2019s low valuation is a temporary imbalance given the lack of analyst coverage in small-cap markets which will correct. As to when this correction will occur, the best cure for undervaluation in the Small Cap space is \n\n**1) Promotional marketing or** \n\n**2) let the results speak for themselves**\n\nWe feel that the company is proving it\u2019s model, seeing successes in expanding its products line and customer base alongside a very Successful investment in Airbeam which de-risks investing in TraceSafe as investors today are getting 2 high-quality tech stocks for the price of 1. \n\n***Estimates and Price Target For TraceSafe***\n\nQ4 2020 Revenues: 2M \n\nFY 2021 Revenues: 20M \n\nP/S Multiple: 15x\n\n12 Month Price Target: $9.65 (includes Airbeam Spin-Off Value)",

        "selftext": "Gather round you hopeless autists. We have to talk. Listen to me you hopeless stupid fucking retards.  \nThe only reason I am not posting this on r/investing is because you asstards need help. There is some  \nserious chicken fucking tendies to be made here.  \nI'm the guy who famously claimed that Bob Swan, Intel CEO, should fabricate a silicone butt and fuck it  \nduring Intel's next earning call to appease stock holders instead of going over their financials. (See: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/j6ioot/intel\\_is\\_fucked/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/j6ioot/intel_is_fucked/)) As it turns out, I was right and Bob Swan showed everyone how much of a dipshit he really is and how he literally knows nothing about this industry. I doubled my principal on my last Intel put and I plan to do the same with my next more here.  \nFirst, let us a take a good look at what happened to intel. There is so much wrong with that company and I talked about it a lot in my last post. This analyst, Stacy Rasgon, who actually seems to have a basic understanding of this shit, sums it up fairly well. Click the fucking link asshole. Listen to him.  \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzTg6vWgDhQ  \nSo what do we have here:  \n  \"If you start digging in, theres almost no good news here. Gross margins have collapsed.\"  \n  \"This is the beginning of the bear thesis which seems to be embedded in the numbers here.\"  \n  \"Current trajectory of the business does not look good.\"  \nJesus Christ. Should have gone with the silicone butt bobby. Intel is ACTUALLY on fire. So what the fuck does intel plan to do about it? Bob Swan said himself on the earnings call that he wants to go with TSMC. Interesting choice Bobby Boy. Interesting because for once this is not a bad decision. But WHY would Bob Swan want to go with TSMC?  \nTSMC is perhaps the most strategically important company in the world right now. The American government has dramatically increased military operations with Taiwan.   \nOne very critical point that the average wsb idiot misses is that TSMC is only a foundry. Because of this they can focus only on improving their chip-manufacturing and not have to worry at all about selling/marketing the chips. Some of the major customers of TSMC are \\[3\\]:  \n\n\n* AMD\n* Apple (25% of TSMC revenue)\n* Broadcom\n* Marvell\n* MediaTek\n* Nvidia\n* Qualcomm\n* Xilinx\n\nSoon intel as well. Simply put, if any one of those companies above do well then TSMC wins. Their financials are perfect, they are the world leaders in their covid-proof industry, the only fab with a 5nm process and have a ton of massive customers for whom they have great relationships with (they built and bankrolled a new fabrication center just for Apple for fucks sake). If you pay close attention to this stuff, you may have heard how Nvidia recently went to Samsung for fabrication, yeah, Nvidia backtracked quickly on that and they are going back to TSMC due to Samsungs shit yields \\[4\\].\n\n  \n**Stop massaging your wife's boyfriend's vas deferens and listen up.** The American government  \nis currently preparing for a war with china over TSMC. The US is rapidly heading from a cold to a hot war with China. Some experts, such as Niall Furgeson, a well respected Stanford historian is already calling it \"Cold War 2\" \\[7\\].  \nThere is a video you must watch on this topic. It is produced by a Chinese-Hating-Korean-Trump-Supporter but it is most primary sources from China and it sums up quite well the China internal sentiment on this issue. (Click it you fucking autist):  \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2uP\\_8YoJTU&amp;ab\\_channel=KoreanaJones  \nWell, shit. So here we are:\n\n* The US can no longer fabricate semiconductors, only Taiwan can.\n* America will do everything is can as a matter of national security to protect TSMC.\n* USA bans China's only serious semi conductor fabricator SMIC. \\[5\\]\n* USA bans anyone from doing business with Chinese tech firms like Huawei. TSMC even confirmed AGAIN they will not fabricate for Huawei. \\[6\\]\n* Taiwan HATES China so they don't actually even want to work with their shitty fake tech companies.\n* Semiconductors are critical to a modern economy/military. (Xi JinPing has said this himself.)\n* Taiwan's military is a joke compared to China's so they will do everything to appease the Americans  \n  for the survival of their nation.\n* Hong Kong proved to the world, especially Taiwan, that China has zero interest in honoring any governance agreements made. This raises the stakes for Taiwan dramatically as a cooperation with China means a complete erasure of their culture and history.\n* ASML, the people who make the machines for TSMC, are a German company. Unsurprisingly, Germany has taken a similar stance, including military aid, for Taiwan. ASML is a \"crown jewel\" for Germany and they make a shit ton supporting TSMC.\n\n  \nSo what is the bear case for a company that is at the heart of US/Taiwan/Germany/Europe national security interests? A company which is ACTUALLY technologically superior to their competition and is basically the only game in town?  \nThe bear case is potential war with China. But if that happens your positions are going to shit anyway.\n\n**Options (Wish I bought more):**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r9uchpxpd0561.png?width=1080&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4ba1bc3a98783399ddfe80637b527ceb032ec742\n\n  \n**Stocks:**\n\n  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/knuge7gsd0561.png?width=1080&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b72bd468a5e77f97a423835eaaf2e87b6c1d8275\n\n**References**\n\n1.

        "selftext": "Robinhood's entire AUM is $20 billion according to Google. It is likely quite a bit more now. However it is tiny compared to something like Schwab with 5T. \n\nSo this got me wondering who is buying Tesla shares. There is no way Robinhooders have enough money to move the market so much. If you go to [https://whalewisdom.com/stock/tsla](https://whalewisdom.com/stock/tsla) and sort by shares held. The only person in the entire first page buying Tesla is [SUSQUEHANNA SECURITIES, LLC](https://whalewisdom.com/filer/susquehanna-securities).\n\nSusquehanna is the TSLA option maker. They are market neutral and likely bought shares to hedge for the explosion in Tesla option trading. My guess of what is happening is that, when someone buys Tesla options - say 750 strike for $1000 - they have notional exposure to 75000 for 1000 - 75x leverage !  So it's the options buying that are moving the TSLA stock.\n\nThere is this old video of Charlie Munger on dangers of options trading [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaGa\\_HaP3gA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaGa_HaP3gA). Options volume was never this large, for example Google's total option market volume is 1/5th of Tesla, even though its a 2x bigger firm. This reminds me of the oil bust in mid march where you had financial speculators who had no interested in taking delivery, same I think happens in Tesla where people just get options with no intention of taking delivery.\n\nWill be very interesting to see how much longer this elevated options trading continues as when the music stops, that 36billion+ of stock that Susquehanna holds will hit the market.",

        "selftext": "Okay, good morning fellow autists and retards. \n\nI'm not going to bother with the niceties since most of you have the attention span of a pre-teen needing to go potty. That's not a lot so I'll keep it brief.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGME is a B&amp;M primary business, first and foremost. It operates mainly in the US, though it also has retail stores in Canada, Europe, New Zealand and Australia. They used to be wildly popular back in the day, but have seen rapid decline since the digitization era has come and GME for the most part hasn't been adapting as it should have been.   \n\n\nThis brings us to today, where the share price has been averaging down for years, until mid-August this year when we got the news of the [partnership with Microsoft](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/gamestop-stock-surges-after-microsoft-partnership-announcement-2020-10-08#:~:text=GME%2C%20%2D5.74%25%20gained%2044,end%20and%20in%2Dstore%20operations), which sent the price to tendie-town for those who got in early. However, based on purely DCF, a fair value for the stock would be around 22 USD. Way higher than what it's now, and that's also the difference between Burry and Cohen imo. Burry invested purely on the fair value for GME, while Cohen has different intentions (more on that later).\n\nNow, a partnership is great, but it won't keep them afloat forever. They NEED to change their boomer mentality and start getting digitized. Gaming is a booming sector, [with insane growth YOY.](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/video-game-market#:~:text=The%20global%20video%20game%20market,12.9%25%20from%202020%20to%202027.&amp;text=The%20rising%20inclination%20from%20physical,on%20hardware%20compatibility%20and%20efficiency) They need to capitalize on this or they'll flicker out eventually because someone else came around and filled the void. \n\nThis is where Ryan Cohen comes in. No need to introduce him, this guy has been mentioned enough, founded CHEWY made millions, etc. What hasn't been sent home enough, is that he has vision. He knows what people want, how they want to be treated as customers ([which is in part why CHWY has such good reputability](https://www.forbes.com/sites/veronikasonsev/2018/05/23/chewys-customers-love-them-and-heres-why/?sh=58b595244b7f)). \n\nWhat the gaming industry lacks is a centralized point that makes people go \"Oh yeah, I need this or that game, let's go to Gamestop for that\" There really isn't that one name for people. It used to BE Gamestop with them even now still being the largest gaming retailer in America. But they're but a shadow of what they have been. \n\nNow if anyone has been able to follow me through my ramblings, Ryan Cohen has in front of him an opportunity to pull GME up from the mud and reveal a diamond. Because that what GME is. A diamond in the rough, and no one's noticed, or bothered to check it out. \n\nNow I don't know how, or when exactly, there are plenty of other posts that go into the when and how Cohen will take over, but all I do know is this:\n\n\\-He bought up 9.98% of the shares outstanding (massive position)\n\n\\-He ([or his lawyer](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kakxrm/gme_tribe_a_story_about_how_ryan_cohen_is_about/)) wrote an unusually aggressive letter to the BoD to change pretty massively. \n\n\\-He's mentioned in interviews that he doesn't like to half-ass investments if he [\"believes in the company\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJdZPTjq274). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat does this say for me? That he believes in the company, not so much in the current way that its heading (hence the letter). His stake in the company tells me he's not just a friendly passer-by telling them to look-up because a meteorite is about to smash into them. No, he's putting his foot in the door so that he can then open it wide and let in some fresh air (himself/his team). \n\nNot only would it change the entire company in a good way, it would make any sort of valuation unpredictable taking into account future potential. \n\nAdd on to this situation that GME is so heavily shorted, and this makes for a SUPER interesting play, if not long-term, at the very least short-term, because of the short squeeze that would occur because of this. And if Cohen takes over, long term prospects are probably higher than whatever we get from the squeeze. \n\nI don't know if much of what I said made sense, but here you go anyway. My 2 cents.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPositions are 1000 shares @$16.33 - It's not whale size, but I don't have much money to start with.\n\nHave a nice day retards.",

I have come out of retirement and taken a break from my usual routine of fucking sluts, yachting around the world and getting my toes licked by Dan Bilzerian to speak once again with my follow dumbasses, bagholders, suckers, Young Trillionaires\u2026 and yes, even the hater\u2019s. I have come to pump the shit out of **UHHHH I MEAN**\u2026 I have come to... *recommend* a stock that I think you all should buy. Heh heh, yeah that\u2019ll work. You might remember me as [the guy whose reddit post single-handedly killed WeWork](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/d6618z/real_dd_i_read_analysed_all_180_pages_of_the/). \n\n**Clever Leaves** (Listed as $S\u0226MA right now, soon to be $CLVR on Dec 18th once they\u2019re added to the Nasdaq) is basically one thing \u2013 They\u2019re a low cost producer of pharmaceutical-grade skunk weed. They have bigass facilities in Columbia  with 10million square feet of cannabis production, and they\u2019re definitely not involved in any cocaine production. If you\u2019ve seen Narcos, you know that nothing shady ever happens in Columbia. I haven\u2019t watched it but I have it on good word that there\u2019s talk about \u201cPlato and Plomo\u201d, which I think means Plantains and Plumage. A tropical paradise, no?\n\nSo what\u2019s the problem with weed companies like ACB, Tilray and Cronos? Well, they put the cart before the horse with their acquisition-before-product strategies. If you don\u2019t know what that means because you\u2019re a 14 year old using your parents\u2019 names to make a Robinhood account, it basically means they fucked themselves over by expanding too fast into buying random fucking companies (Bespoke grow rooms, anyone?) with their investor money without actually growing their weed at an affordable rate. The cost of producing weed isn\u2019t economical in Canada because the conditions for growing it there suck and the labor costs and taxes are insane. A bunch of companies set up shop in Canada since it was the first real country to legalize weed (**Ur**u**g**u**ay** doesn't count) and because they were fans of some guys called Tim Horton and Terry Fox, but ironically gimped themselves in the process. CLVR is going to sell weed to hipster Europeans who don't know how much they're overpaying, it fucking owns. They already have production and offices in Portugal and Germany. \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nCLVR is going to eliminate all competitors in the end. *Period*. Any dumbass can throw a seed in the ground in their backyard and piss on it daily and harvest enough pissweed to get them through the winter. Legalized weed is a cannibalistic exercise and a terrible investment because once you legalize, the margin on the product drops through the floor and it gets really fucking hard to produce the product (you know, the actual weed?) at a price that won\u2019t see you burn through cash like an ashy crackhead on his last rock. If you are actually reading this whole post and didn't just glaze over and buy in because it was really long, PM me and I'll send you my wife's boyfriend's nudes that she sends me to mock how much of a loser I am. Regardless, **the only way to make money in legalized weed is to grow at insanely low prices and under cut the competition which will allow you to buy up market share and then buy out the competition, and then start to raise prices**, which is CLVR's strategy. I learned this from a scene in The Wire btw.\n\nI once called ACB the Goodwill of pot stocks because they bring in just about anything they can find and it\u2019s staffed by retards. CLVR is the opposite, the people running the company have been there from the start and don\u2019t get fired and replaced once a year like most Canadian pot stock companies execs. [Here's a video of the CEO explaining their company](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkCE-DTSYuA). I gotta be honest kinda zoned out but he doesn't come off like a grifter to me so that's probably a good thing. He used to work in Blackstone and was an actual investor, which is basically the opposite of a WSB poster, so that means he's undoubtedly profitable. The rest of the management and SPAC team is a group of rich-ass investment banker crackers, so you just know they're finna make some coin. Here are some more rocket emojis. \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nDoes CLVR make any money right now? NOPE. Does that matter? Hell fuckin no, are you retarded?? But do you know how much money that ACB, TLRY and CRON burn through on a monthly basis? An absolute fuckload more. [Here's their prospectus if you want some pretty pictures and fewer words that will convince you that this is the right decision](https://samcospac.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/SAMA-Clever-Leaves-LOI-Investor-Presentation.pdf).\n\nTo sum up - $CLVR 1/15/2021 $20c, gg ez no re. Peace out and don't forget to thank me later and [follow me on twitter](https://twitter.com/talesofstocks) you dumbfucks.\n\nedit: I had to write it like $S\u0226MA because dumbass automod removed the original post.",

        "selftext": "Hey kids,  \nIm here today to talk to you about a company Im really hyped up about called **Momentus**.  \nThese guys are doing some really awesome shit out here providing last mile services for space transport, implementing new high-efficiency propulsion technologies for inter-planetary travel and shipping, and they\u2019re positioning themselves to be in on the GROUND FLOOR of \\*Permanent Space Infrastructure\\* and the permanent space economy. These guys rule. This is the **first publicly traded space infrastructure company.** \n\nDont even fucking kid yourself about this: If human beings dont blow themselves into the stone ages, space is \\*i n e v i t a b l e\\*. We\u2019re looking at $415Billion in revenue in the space industry currently, with Bank of America projecting the industry to expand upwards of $1.4Trillion in the near future.  \nAs excited as I am about these guys, I\u2019ll do what I can to give you the information I\u2019ve been able to dig up so you can check em out and see if you're interested. I personally think they have some short term hype potential (which I\u2019ll explain later) but Im buying calls now to lock in a price for this company to eventually exercise and hold for the full trip around the fucking moon\n\n  \n**Friends First: Momentus Confirmed Partners**\n\nCurrently, Momentus has confirmed and active partnerships or provides services to NASA, Lockheed Martin, and our favorite billionaire meme-lord papa Elon via Space X. They are already confirmed to be participating in the (hopefully) January 14th 2021 first-ever ride share rocket launch in partnership with Space X. They\u2019re launching 4 different times with Space X in 2021 including an already-booked full vehicle in December of 2021 so they are already out there making plans and getting shit moving. Besides these big names there are many others they have current accounts and partnerships with including Global Ground Station, Relativity, Albaorbital, and others. And just as a little sugar on top, [the President of SpaceX prefers the types of space-tugs offered by Momentus over small rockets](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/spacex-president-prefers-space-tugs-over-small-rockets-2020-11-18) (wouldnt mind em giving me a lil space tug myself ifyanowutimsayin)  \n**The Men Behind the Mission**  \nThe president and founder of Momentus is a man named Mikhail Kokorich. This guy was born in Siberia and studied physics in Russia where he finished his degree with honors while simultaneously starting a company. He has formed and headed several successful companies starting at age 19 with one that provided explosives and chemical services to Siberian mining companies. After that he founded and ran a chain of domestic merchandise retail stores, second in size only to Bed Bath &amp; Beyond, successfully scaled and sold one of the largest consumer electronic retail chains as well as one of the biggest timber companies in the world.. He finally moved back to his childhood dream of building a space company. The rest of their team includes people with previous experience in aerospace, propulsion, and robotics as well as others. Plus, Mikhail is Russian and they beat the US into space so he\u2019s already got a leg up. Also, Chris Hadfield (the astronaut that did an autistic David Bowie cover from the ISS) is on their Board of Directors, so thats pretty cool.  \n\n\n**The Company, The Vision, The Mission**  \nMomentus as a company currently has customers for space transportation services including last mile delivery, payload services that will decrease the costs across the board for launching and developing satellites, as well as fixing those puppies up and refueling them \\*while they\u2019re in orbit\\*. They have a proven groundbreaking water propulsion technology that is significantly cheaper than any current offerings, is reusable, and is already working since a successful test flight in mid-2019 thats still going to this day. **No pushing the satellite down a hill and turning the camera bullshit here.** They put their money where their mouth is and shot that fucker into space just to prove they could, and its **still going.** Currently they have &gt;$90M of signed contracts and 4 confirmed Vigoride (thats what they\u2019ve named their first model) launches on Space X Flacon-9s. They already have a product roadmap with 3 different models to be offered by 2024 providing both small satellite all the way up to 20,000kg transportation. They will have limited commercial launches starting in the first half of 2021 with full commercial launches going live by Q4 2021. They are compatible with Space X, Blue Origin, GK Launch Services, and Relativity with active launch deals signed with all except Blue Origin currently. They\u2019re also in negotiations for over $1.1B of contracts including with NASA and the US government. Companies like Starlink, Amazon, Apple, and Google already have plans to create their own satellite networks and Momentus is the first in line with proven technology to service all of these future plans with big and long lasting tech players. They have a clear path to profitability and &gt;$1B in EBITDA. Lastly, they\u2019re already looking to the future and working on plans for in-space solar energy generation, water and resource harvesting from asteroids and other planetary bodies, as well as all sorts of other cool sci-fi shit that (I hope) humans will be capable of before Im fucking dead.  \n**TL;DR**  \nMomentus is a bleeding-edge space infrastructure and technology company with a successful and passionate founder, a proven currently-in-space revolutionary water propulsion technology, active partnerships with Space X, NASA, and others, and already have good finances and a clear path to profitability and growth. They\u2019re going public via a special purpose acquisition company with an enterprise value of $1.2B which will later be relisted under the ticker $MNTS.\n\nMomentus was founded by a Russian (the first country in space), already has working partnerships with Papa Elon, and wants to build a future where getting to and moving around in space is cheap, renewable, and profitable. This guys are [going to the fucking moon and back several times on a tiny, water-propellled \ud83d\ude80 with or without you](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201201005408/en/Momentus-Announces-First-Rideshare-Mission-to-Moon), so I\u2019d suggest you grab a seat early and hold on tight  \n**Positions**  \n**1/21 20c and 25c (ticker-rename and first Space X launch hype)**  \n**2/21 20c (to lock in my price, exercise and hold)**",

        "selftext": "**Yes, its true**.  The liquidity programs we've come to know and love--the true \"pumps\"\u2014are stagnating or contracting, and it's clear SPY doesn't like this.  We are our own out there people. Let me break down for you how and why that is; and what we can do to save our tendies.\n\n*First, let\u2019s take a quick look at the vehicles that the FED has used to keep us propped up that I\u2019m referencing:*\n\n**Overnight short-term loans (Repo, Reverse Repo operations)**\n*What It Is*\n[More detailed description I did back in the day here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hcdpox/dd_playing_vxx_and_spy_against_the_fed_repo/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf), but this is the process by which the FED has been giving banks overnight loans so they could make asset purchases.  They used to give these loans to each other, but the process became fucked up and expensive and the FED stepped in to fix this by offering the loans themselves at a low rate.  Once the pandemic hit, they took the unprecedented step of offering the loans with zero additional interest for themselves, basically offering free money.\n[\u20180 basis points over IOER\u2019 is nerd speak for \u2018fucking free money\u2019](https://i.imgur.com/tD780yn.jpg)\n**-Did it work?  Yes.**  \nFed Policy typically takes a couple of months to affect the market.  With that in mind, you can see that the performance of SPY correlates with the interest rate and bid volume on overnight repo operations.  Free money policy was instituted in March, and the impact gained full strength in the spring.\n[look at this insane Repo activity in early June when the loans were free money. SPY was +7% month to date!](https://i.imgur.com/3bwjqd5.jpg)\n\n**Treasuries** \nI won't go too deep into treasury purchases and its effect on market activity, but the simplified version is this; **if the FED needs to flood the market with money by pushing people to invest in vehicles aside from safe, boomer treasuries, they will buy up the treasuries themselves.**  This raises the price of treasuries by starving the market, thus giving them less yield--in other words, making them less valuable.  With less yield, people turn to stocks.  That's an oversimplified version of how it works, but you get the gist; the FED buys treasuries so people buy stonks.\n**-Did it work? Yes**.\nTake a look at the yield rate on treasuries here.  [At this time in 2019, the 20 year yield was up as high as 2.2%](https://i.imgur.com/1fLBbE3.jpg).  But, take a look at what happens after March.  The Fed begins buying up the treasuries, and the yield goes down to .98 in April.  All you need to know is that means the yield on treasuries was dogshit so people were pressured to buy stonks.\n\"How do you know this was the Fed's doing?\"\nThey said it.  [Here is one of many statements from the FED](https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/opolicy/operating_policy_200312a) saying \"we are going to by the fuck out of treasuries at an increased rate because of COVID\".  How increased?  Take a look at this photo, we are talking about an average of 10 or 20 billion dollars, to 80 million dollars a clip.\n[treasury spending increased 3 fold](https://i.imgur.com/J08Av7D.jpg)\n\n**Bond Repurchases**\nIn March the FED announced they would be buying corporate bonds in another major boost to available liquidity.  Just as SPY got shaky, it was an added boost immeditely after the June  crash (a crash, btw, caused by a change in the repo loan interest rates).  Basically, when large companies need money they issue bonds to shore up cash that are available to the public (same shit as treasuries, basically)--the FED is now buying those bonds.  This direct infusion of cash from the FED is about as close to outright buying stock in companies as you can get.\n**Did it work? Yes**. \nSee: June rebound.  Also google some of the types of companies they're buying bonds from.  There's a reason why the fact that nobody is paying rent hasn't caused a mortgage-backed credit crisis for major banks...yet.\n\n*So, weve established the main tools the FED uses to prop up the market and that they work.  What\u2019s the problem, and why am I saying JPOW has forsaken us?*\n\n**Because the Fed\u2019s balance sheet has been contracting, and with that these programs are no longer offering nearly as favorable terms as they once were, but the market isn\u2019t strong enough to handle those unfavorable terms.**\n\n[here\u2019s a graph from the FED showing their flatlining balance sheet](https://i.imgur.com/CoRcfBb.jpg)\nThe FED is spending less overall than it was earlier this year (remember, it takes a couple months for spending policy to catch up in the market).  *This was bound to happen, but the problem is the key programs I mentioned are all at obviously ineffective levels and haven\u2019t been increased.*\n**a) Repo operations haven\u2019t been at a lower cost interest level since July**, from +0 basis points over the standard interest rate, to +5--and on longer term loan operations +10.  The market has not responded kindly to losing their free money, looking at the monthly SPY charts.\n**b) While generous, the treasuries purchases have stalled out at 80 million**.  More importantly, the FED hasn't facilitated any key changes to which terms they purchase (long v short, etc). The market has responded to this stagnation with stagnation, looking at the monthly SPY charts.\n**c) Bond purchases not set to increase**: The FED is still purchasing bonds, but have also stagnated the rates of that along with the other two facilities.  Kaplan, the Dallas Fed Chair who's always running his mouth, has [indicated a lack of support for increased corporate bond purchases. ](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/02/kaplan-says-hes-not-in-favor-of-fed-increasing-bond-purchases.html)\n\n**What the contracting FED balance sheet, the stagnation of these increased liquidity programs, and the lackluster performance of SPY over the past three months combine to signal is that the market/SPY is NOT healthy enough on their own to continue its rise.  If you take the 5 day election bump out the picture, SPY has performed over 50% less than its aggregrate performance April-August.**\n\nWhy did I say don't buy the dip YET? Is help coming?  Yes.  Two options:\n**1) The stimulus**: if enhanced UI benefits are improved, the spending in the consumer goods and credit market would provide a huge boost that could offset the economic effects of an increasingly bleek jobs situation.\n\n**2) The FOMC meeting on the 16th**: this is where the FED would make any decisive changes on the lending programs mentioned here.  My guy /u/curiousmaniac pointed out to me that these changes, if they even happened, likely wouldn't come to fruition in the new year (even if the policy is changed on the 16th).\n\n**So yeah, you might wanna chill on SPY. I hear you saying \u201cwhere was this BEFORE TODAY?! REVISIONIST HISTORY\u201d**\n-[here's my DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k9zcbo/why_the_market_is_becoming_the_economy_a_tale_of/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) from Tuesday saying not to go near SPY without a stimulus\n-[heres my tweet](https://twitter.com/yourboymilt/status/1336366986545098752?s=21) from last week calling the top of SPY at 370\nTo be fair, I'm wrong a fucking ton, as we all are lol. but gotta flx those few sweet moments you get it right.\n\n**Positions:**\nTLT is my new hedge against SPY because VIX and its derivatives are ass rn. I dont buy puts cuz im not sweet like that.  (here's my[ DD on VIX 101 if you're curious](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jfhdta/volatility_for_dummies_vxx_uvxy_vxx_and_spy/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf))\nOther than that, monthly stimulus plays that favor consumer spending (on places that are at an advantage from hybrid online/retail models due to lockdown), TOL (housing numbers explode when stimmy passes), and TDOC because TDOC is dope. \n\n**WMT: 1/8 155c**\n**TGT: 1/8 180c**\n**TDOC 11/24 200c**\n**TDOC 1/15 205c**\n**AAPL: 1/8 126c**\n**HPQ: 1/15 25c**\n**TOL 1/15 46c**\n\n\n**TLDR**: FED tools are drying up, SPY is toodangerous for now--market isn't strong enough on its own yet.  Count on monthlies that are a hybrid of pandemic retail/online winnersin preparation for the stimulus, and pay attention the results of FOMC meeting on the 16th.  VXX sucks and I'm using TLT as a hedge.\n\n**TLDR of the TLDR**: PLTR 1/15 500c, GME 12/24 35c\n\nill try to update contextual news and moves here at the end of the day if alot of people read this, and moves on my twitter yourboymilt since theres no notification thing here (not my fault mods)",

They've reduced their net debt YOY and has been able to maintain a strong and healthy balance sheet over the course of this pandemic.\n\n**Copper**\n\nAfter a small decline of 0.2% in 2019, world copper mine production, adjusted for historical disruption factors, is expected to decline by about 1.5% in 2020 and then to recover by around 4.5% in 2021:\n\nCopper prices are currently at an all time high (look at chart below) and demand for copper will pick up significantly into 2021 as economies start to recover.

Personally I find my highest returns to date to be stocks under $20 a share as I can buy 5x-10x the shares or more and any increase is exponentially more then my higher valued stocks. For example I own 100 shares of stock x at $114 a share, it increases to $124 a share profiting $1000 total. Or my other, I own 10,000 shares of stock y at $4 a share, it increases to $8 a share profiting $40,000 total... to me the cheaper shares are the better option and in my experience safer as drops tend to be less value so less loss.",

        "selftext": "**Re: Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA) \ud83e\udd21\ud83d\udca5 \ud83d\ude80**\n\nI wrote a DD on this super interesting play last week and it drew a bit of attention and some interesting dialogue.

Secretary deal on Tuesday.\n\nHere I wanna talk about the ins and outs of the SCOTUS oral arguments coming up on Wednesday, the likelihood of the treasury secretary decapitating that process by announcing a deal to bring FNMA public on Tuesday and the chances we could be about to witness one of the biggest speculative plays of the year. A KODAK moment if you will.\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Some facts:**\n\n**\u00b7 Supreme Court HEARD ARGUMENTS TODAY**\n\n[https://www.c-span.org/video/?477438-1/collins-v-mnuchin-consolidated-oral-argument](https://www.c-span.org/video/?477438-1/collins-v-mnuchin-consolidated-oral-argument)\n\n\u00b7 Treasury Secretary Mnuchin is listed as the government party on the suit\n\n\u00b7 There\u2019s no way he\u2019s going to let the court release a verdict totally clowning he and trump admin\n\n\u00b7 A new deal will be announced Monday or Tuesday\n\n\u00b7 Much of the legwork for same has been done through other governmental agencies\n\n\u00b7 That\u2019s all to say that I am really feeling a jump to $3 or $4 tomorrow afternoon\n\n**\\*\\*\\*This needs to be on your radar. Take a look as you haven't. I believe its either up 10-20% right away in the AM or you may have a chance you get in before the mid-day rush. The SCOTUS case will be all over the news this week. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are just ubiquitous names with a long history (started in the 1930's) and of course are notorious from the 2008-2010 financial crisis. The press is going to be all over it this week and hyping the oral arguments or any movement from the Treasury on settling out of court.\\*\\*\\***\n\n\\----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**FNMA boasts higher revenues than each of these companies:**\n\n1. Bank of America\n2. Home Depot\n3. Wells Fargo\n4. Citigroup\n5. Target\n6. Johnson and Johnson\n7. Raytheon\n8. Boeing\n9. Phillips 66\n10. Comcast\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nYou can\u2019t tell me this stock, if the gov/SCOTUS takes it out of conservatorship, is worth $2.5. This thing is going to $30. The numbers don\u2019t lie. The government has been criminally bleeding it dry and using political fog and stigma from the 08\u2019 financial crisis to justify this behavior.\n\n**Ackman is in at $2.20 and his old buddy Icahn is in at $4.**\n\nTrump admin and Mnuchin specifically (former Wall Street Exec) are gunna ram this through.\n\nI'm looking for counter arguments here other than (\"they told us this in 2016\"). Lots has changed since 16'. Where do people see this going in the next 6 months, with or without a Mnuchin deal on Tuesday?\n\nIs there anyone out there who really believes that this SCOTUS will rule against taking FNMA to the markets again?\n\n**This seems like such a lock that I am in need of some discussion here. What am I missing?**\n\nIs this thing brewing over the weekend and we see a 100% increase tomorrow? That's what I am thinking.\n\n**If a deal is struck early in the week, my god, my god...**\n\nLet's chat FNMA.\n\n\\--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Positions:** 10,000 commons at $2.60",

        "selftext": "Back at ya with some of my bullish opinions! I\u2019ll keep it simple and pick my favorite high-growth potential SPAC by industry again. \n\n(Check my post history where I posted a month ago 3 key industries and my bullish SPAC in each industry. The 3 were HCAC, APXT and LGVW. HCAC since went from $13 to $24 but now at post merger sell off phase at $18. APXT since went from $14 to now at $16, this one is expected to grow steadily still. LGVW went from $16 to now $21, rising fast recently thanks to ARK picking up a ton more shares. \nFull disclosure: Since that post last month I\u2019ve fully sold out of LGVW, have 100 left shares in HCAC/GOEV, 300 shares in APXT. Best of luck to fellow holders!!) \n\nNow on to my new high-growth SPACs to look out for TODAY by industry. \n\nSpace: A futuristic industry that has very few companies to begin with given the high cost and risks associated with launching and testing. So what company is safest? $NPA. They are merging with SpaceMobile. SpaceMobile is striving to create global wireless coverage. Vodafone, Rakuten, Samsung are heavily invested. They are patent protected and working alongside NASA. What I  also really like is the US federal government has high interest in dominating 5G infrastructure worldwide and SpaceMobile would directly do that. Check out my boys DD post here:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/SPACs/comments/khpzpg/ast_spacemobile_npa_invest_in_the_mobile_space/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf\n\nFinance: I would say $BFT but at this point you\u2019ve heard of them enough, it may be late to the party, and the high-growth factor isn\u2019t fully there. With this industry (as many it feels) it is ripe for changing. Bitcoin has proved that it works - it\u2019s now proving its actual value which we see as its currently the largest financial service in the world beating VISA. It is catching up to Berkshire Hathaways market cap. So a SPAC that is targeting a crypto company has the most high-growth opportunity imo. $FUSE is the ticker. They do not yet have a target but there are strong signs it will be BlockFi or another crypto company given $FUSE management team and social presence. It might be grasping at straws but many SPACs targets get correctly deduced like this. Check out my boys DD post here: \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/SPACs/comments/kjidcj/dd5_on_fuse_fusion_acquisition_corp_excellent/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf\n\nHousing: A rather cyclical and boring industry here so it can be tough to time as an investor and want to hold long. I still believe in this company for the short-term (I plan to sell pre-merger then rebuy as it dips post ticker change). $GHIV is the ticker. They are merging with United Wholesale Mortgage, the #1 wholesale mortgage lender in the US, in the largest SPAC deal yet. UWM had $1.45 Billion in net income in 2020 Q3! I had the honor to meet with current CEO Mat Ishbia (few years back) and he was an energetic, motivating and down to earth guy. Check out my boys DD post here:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/SPACs/comments/k6u8m7/ghiv_the_biggest_spac_deal_ever/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf\n\nMy Positions &amp; Price Targets:\n$NPA 300 shares at ~$12.50, price target of ~$18. \n$FUSE 200 shares at ~$10.46, price target TBD until we get a target confirmation of a crypto company. If BlockFi then price target of ~$20. \n$GHIV 200 shares at ~$11.07, price target ~$15 pre merger. $10C 1/15 expiry options, planning to sell this week or the 1st week of January. \n\nDisclosure:\nThis post is my personal bullish opinions. Please do your own research before investing. I try to aggregate key points that attract me and link other smart individuals DD posts that contain much more needed detail.

        "selftext": "Does anyone do ATM debit spreads for something fairly consistent like SQ? 30-45 DTE spreads seem like a solid way to get somewhere between 50-100% returns pretty consistently as long as it goes up like 1% a month (which besides March of this year SQ almost always does). So let's say you start out with 1k worth of ATM spreads (and assuming you have two months of the year that it doesn't hit the 1% increase and you sell at a 50% loss):\n\n1. 1k --&gt; 2k\n2. 2k --&gt; 4k\n3. **4k --&gt; 2k (50% limit sell)**\n4. 2k --&gt; 4k\n5. 4k --&gt; 8k\n6. 8k --&gt; 16k\n7. 16k --&gt; 32k\n8. 32k --&gt; 64k\n9. **64k --&gt; 32k (50% limit sell)**\n10. 32k --&gt; 64k\n11. 64k --&gt; 128k\n12. 128k --&gt; 256k\n\n(This is simplified obviously, and unrealistic maybe, but in the last year it's very rare that SQ wouldn't go up 1% in a month. Yes I know it probably won't happen exactly like that the next year, but let's say it's something similar)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Buy a 225C and sell a 230C for 1\\/29 \\(\\~30DTE\\)](https://preview.redd.it/9qbkhrr6wq761.png?width=340&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d9bde483d5936dbbae204f86f99db8143a3e9478)\n\nVertical spreads negate the effect of theta decay (since you're selling an OTM call) and you don't have to do much besides close the spread the week of expiration. My plan is to close something that has lost 50% value and then just open another spread 6 weeks later. \n\n[The same for 2\\/5 \\(\\~40DTE\\)](https://preview.redd.it/ep3z6w7vxq761.png?width=376&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a73eeeae0e4b6e295acbdb6969c98f6a17a2fc6a)\n\nObviously there are pitfalls, but has anyone been trading ATM spreads for a while? I've been doing OK the last couple months with Amazon spreads even though it's been basically flat (I've been getting 60-80% returns when I close them the week of expiration), but I'm going to switch to SQ and maybe something like Visa or MSFT.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Month over month, this thing is up like 90&amp;#37; of the time.](https://preview.redd.it/q1fiig9myq761.png?width=452&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c7a046685e5ca1e5c5626fb6d07b0e758b5f457b)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Another one](https://preview.redd.it/ecpmbcrn0r761.png?width=429&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b00fa007874c246fb6b6b78e63988d50fab3a45f)\n\nYes, stonks might go down every once in a while, but if things are going to stay dovish (and the last decade shows the US likes to keep it that way), why wouldn't this be the best strategy?

        "selftext": " First Id like to preface here that everything below is sourced facts or speculative opinions. What you do with this information is your own choice. [**This post is a continuance of part one**](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k0g3br/thcb_microvast_dd/)\n\nIn the past few weeks, there have been discussions on Microvast and Tesla, and comparisons to Quantumscape. Including today with even more pumping from Apple rumors. So, this post is presenting DD on these three topics.\n\nSo, first Ill address Microvast and Tesla. People have pointed out that the new Microvast battery plant in Germany [is only 30 minutes from the new Tesla plant.](https://www.google.com/search?ei=N_HgX5q0DJq5tQa58a_YCw&amp;q=Gr%C3%BCnheide+to+Ludwigsfelde&amp;oq=Gr%C3%BCnheide+to+Ludwigsfelde&amp;gs_lcp=CgZwc3ktYWIQA1AAWABgigRoAHACeACAAQCIAQCSAQCYAQCqAQdnd3Mtd2l6wAEB&amp;sclient=psy-ab&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjaq6LF4d_tAhWaXM0KHbn4C7sQ4dUDCA0&amp;uact=5) with the [speculation that a partnership is imminent](https://www.reddit.com/r/SPACs/comments/k3ek4i/microvast_soon_thcb_possible_collaboration_with/). The proximity is true but the agreement is speculative, the best-case scenario is that there is a potential manufacturing agreement or buyout of Microvast (explained below), worst case Tesla gets its IP stolen, both Win-Win scenarios for Microvast. There is also the possibility of a OEM partnership with other German automakers for their lower volume models (EV vans, sprinters, etc). \n\nSo, what role could Microvast play for Tesla, that might even be worth buying it entirely like they did Maxwell? The Microvast Lithium titanium-oxide (LTO) based batteries would be perfect for these 4 key Tesla issues:\n\n**1. Home Energy Storage**\n\nCurrently, Tesla\u2019s Powerwall is based on Lithium Nickel Manganese Cobalt Oxide (NMC) type batteries. These are great but are not superior to LTO batteries for the following reasons.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. They are not safer, having the added manufacturing costs of fire suppression. [Meanwhile, look at this demo of an LTO battery being set on fire.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAUYbSDEy6I)\n2. Suffer from degradation as soon as 500 cycles, [Tesla can only guarantee 70% capacity after 2000 cycles for the powerwall](https://www.solarquotes.com.au/blog/new-powerwall-warranty/) and [the cars are no better](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Discharge-capacities-left-axis-as-determined-via-galvanostatic-cycle-aging-at-three_fig4_321100167)\n3. They simply cannot operate in the cold, excluding several markets and causing thousands of online complaints\n4. They require conflict and polluting metals such as cobalt and nickel, If Elon Musk was not lying about his concern on this then this is a big factor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs for LTO batteries they are nothing new, but it is only RECENTLY that they have reached an attractive price point for consumer usage. For example, recently LTO batteries have been a popular battery chemistry with DIY solar builders because they pose no fire risk with extreme life cycles of 20,000 - 100,000+.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**2. RoboTaxis**\n\nPart of the Microvast\u2019s business model isn\u2019t just the production of cells, they design EV battery platforms. While Tesla\u2019s Lithium nickel cobalt aluminum oxide (NCA) batteries are great for personal passenger vehicles, due to their high specific energy, it is inferior to LTO batteries for a RoboTaxi like environment. For example, Tesla\u2019s standard current model 3 battery density is 260Wh/Kg, with a range of 260 miles, and V3 charge time of 40 minutes. So, in other words, you can travel about 6.5 miles per minute charge, with increased damage to the battery cycle life every fast charge. An LTO on the other hand does have a lower specific energy (100Wh/kg), but the charge time is 10 minutes with no damage. Assuming all else equal, 40 Minutes of charge time on the LTO would get you 4 full discharge cycles that will effectively give you a capacity almost double that of a Tesla. This is why this type of battery is now being used for EV buses and Taxis.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**3. Car accessory Battery**\n\nTeslas do not run on just their NMC batteries. They require standard lead acid 12 volt batteries. In fact there are rumors that when tesla first started out they tried to use the main HV batteries and ended up bricking the early model teslas. They took the cheaper more sensible route of just using the lead acids to power the accessories. The issue is that in an ICE car these batteries are charged by the engine and alternator. This cannot be accomplished the same way with an EV, which leads to premature crystallization and death of the batteries. They need to source lithium-based batteries that can draw large currents to keep the AC, Sound system, etc off the main high voltage power supplies. Using a typical lithium battery isnt an option here for details I won't go into but it's essentially due to the same thing. It'll die out in the cold and kill the main battery (not warranty covered), will go through cycles quickly, and hosts of other issues that don't exist with the LTOs\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**4. StarLink**\n\nThis is less Tesla but related. For LEO satellites these LTO batteries will last longer than everyone alive today, extending the usable life of the satellites and reducing the amount of space trash. In addition, they could potentially reduce satellite weight load. This is because a major part of these space instruments is thermal management. There is less material in space to conduct electrical heat away from the satellites. An LTO battery can operate at much higher temps than other chemistries.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThese are just some aspects of value Microvast might have to Tesla, which is not decades away (looking at you QS).\n\nAlso, I'll note that not all of these solutions have to be Tesla specific. These options are fair game to all of Tesla\u2019s competitors as well. Microvast also sells supercapacitor like batteries that are not LTO e.g., NMC which isn\u2019t a chemical used by Tesla but is used by Audi, BMW, Mercedes, and other German EV brands, (which goes back to German HQ rumors)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Now in regards to QuantumScape**\n\nI think QS is just showing the potential for Microvast post merger. It doesn\u2019t have to be one versus the other, but nonetheless, I'll compare the two. In terms of tech, they each have their own specific purposes, and each has its weaknesses. E.g. they still suffer from cycle life and cold/hot weather usage effects. Though I have a positive outlook at solid state batteries overall. Microvast does have some solid-state patents and I do believe they will be manufacturing sodium ion batteries by next year as well which will be great for other industries like smart grids. Others like [Toshiba and Mazda have already adopted LTO.](https://www.scib.jp/en/index.htm) The benefit here being that since the technology already exists they and Microvast will capture the largest exponential growth in renewables.  \n\nThis leads us to a business/investment standpoint, QS literally has no revenue and is 5 years away from being 5 years away, but more seriously from their own mouths they won't even break 1GWh production until 2026 and these estimates are never accurate, it will likely be closer to 2030. It makes you question how vested VW is in the venture considering out of $15B they spend on research every year they decided not to buy QS and keep it private or invest substantially more into them. QS is also going up against several other public and private businesses that claim to have solid state batteries. Whereas with Microvast, they have some exclusivity being one of the only 3 manufacturers who have invested into making LTO based batteries. Overall, I think QS has to address the long time horizons they are giving because if the patents that they have today are allegedly a part of their value, they will literally expire by the time they have any reasonable production numbers. But in terms of trading, in this environment, I think they will continue to climb (taking Microvast with it) until the citron hit piece comes out. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Lastly some off topic comments on Apple**\n\nAs for Apple, if you think they are coming out with a Apple car anytime soon (including using solid state batteries) you are just being greedy at this point. It is not in Apples MO. It\u2019s much more likely they are going to solve what I call the \u201cTesla touchscreen effect\u201d, where a touchscreen determines the superiority of a vehicle. It\u2019s a really impressive phenomenon. Online car reviewers like Doug Demuro will spend half their videos discussing SOLELY touchscreens. Developing these type of systems are expensive. Automakers like Aston Martin must buy stripped out versions of Mercedes software, and the Mercedes standard software itself has issues. Tesla has made these short comings more apparent than ever. I believe the Apple \u201cCar\u201d will go the way of the Apple \u201cTV\u201d. It will be a hardware/software supplement to luxury automakers who can't afford to build these Smart/UI systems. It will use Apple\u2019s SoC technology and provide Apple level integration in luxury cars, providing Apple content, self driving capabilities, etc.  Though for the greedy and pumpers who think it will be a physical car ill end with this. The APPLE HQ in Germany is also 30 Minutes from Microvast who also manufacture Iron Phosphate batteries, the [same kind that the Apple Car is alleged to be based on.](https://arstechnica.com/cars/2020/12/apple-is-allegedly-working-on-a-passenger-car-breakthrough-battery-tech/)",

        "selftext": "Greetings fellow retards,\n\nI would like to submit for your consideration the following hypothesis: **a spin-off of a Financial Crime Enforcement division from within Stripe as a publicly owned company through Bill Ackman's SPAC.**\n\nAfter having my mind totally shattered the last few days by watching some of the most insane biopharma pumping and dumping upon the Actual Stupids that inhabit stocktwits.com go down in real time (and getting banned from the platform in the process), I decided to clear my head for a while and then have a good think about the forgotten jewel of my autistic eye, Pershing Square Tontine Holdings.\n\nThis hypothesis should be read as an optimist's case that could possibly tie together a number of disparate threads into a sort of unified field theory about the roles that a SPAC like PSTH specifically and an infrastructure behemoth like Stripe will have in building the economic future of the internet. If you feel like immediately dismissing this post because of [this exchange](https://imgur.com/azcdTT3) or because your brain don't work good for other reasons, please exit the \ud83d\ude80 immediately.\n\nTo start with [Bill Ackman](https://imgur.com/a/wwofHhU), I mean, just look at the man. You would let this silver fox impregnate your wife if he showed up at the door because you are, like me, A F*gg0t Who Cares Too Much (or if you please, a \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b). It'd probably make her happy and you'd get a kid way smarter than the wretched spawn you've loosed from your own loins out of the deal, too.\n\nAnyway, for those who somehow still don't know this, Ackman is an activist investor and one of the more unconventional thinkers operating in the cesspool known as Wall Street. He's probably best known for two things: 1) his COVID crash short that was a [literal hundred bagger] (https://www.forbes.com/sites/antoinegara/2020/03/25/billionaire-bill-ackman-100-fold-return-on-coronavirus-hedge-2-billion/?sh=6f49d29e6fcc) and 2) a short position that blew up in his face to the tune of $1 billion, which he took against the very cool and very legal company that is definitely not a pyramid scheme, Herbalife.\n\nIf you've been paying attention to Ackman's last few days on Twitter, [he's been busy putting the screws to the big credit card companies](https://imgur.com/ZHsjkAP), with some apparent [success](https://imgur.com/kOq2H8E), for servicing Pornhub, known destination for pedo creeps. As someone who has spent the last year and a half slowly losing sanity while learning as much as I can about one [Jeffrey Edward Epstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Epstein), a network of events and financial institutions that support this hypothesis starts to take shape here.\n\nFamously, Epstein hung around a lot of people at the highest echelons of so-called \"polite\" society, appears to have been some kind of intelligence honeypot meant to blackmail sick rich fucks (look up the origins of the CIA if you want to know more about this), and [most definitely did not kill himself with the toilet paper thin sheets that they give you in the clink](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7855039/Graphic-photos-Jeffrey-Epsteins-autopsy-reveal-bloodied-neck.html) **(warning: dead guy pics within)**. He had close working relationships with [JP Morgan Chase](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/22/business/jeffrey-epstein-business-wall-street.html) and [Deutsche Bank](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/07/jeffrey-epstein-case-deutsche-bank-fined-150-million-penalty-for-relationship.html), which both have [conspicuously small positions](https://imgur.com/b4dOMkL) in PSTH, as well as [Goldman Sachs](https://www.wsj.com/articles/jeffrey-epstein-burrowed-into-the-lives-of-the-rich-and-made-a-fortune-11564092553), which is totally absent. I should probably note [that Ackman's wife did receive some Epstein bucks through the MIT Media Lab](https://www.artnews.com/art-news/news/neri-oxman-jeffrey-epstein-13236/) and that Ackman looks to have tried to [bury that story,](https://www.axios.com/joi-jeffrey-epstein-ties-mit-media-lab-professor-8384aa42-32d4-42dc-a0eb-54e23bcdee3a.html) which is ***very not cool***. Anyway, enough about Epstein (go listen to TrueAnon if you want to get yourself some of the same psychic damage that I have about him \ud83d\udc41). \n\nBank ownership of PSTH seems weirdly low in general except for [Wells Fargo](https://imgur.com/I3mrEiM), which strikes me as odd when considering that the top known holder is of PSTH is Guggenheim, which has been historically [jacked to the tits](https://imgur.com/gRaf649) with holdings from the finance sector, but trimmed those positions considerably after the financial crisis.\n\nBy this point you may be finding yourself asking \"how the fuck does all this relate to Stripe, you schizoid freak?\" to which my response is that the [banks themselves](https://www.icij.org/investigations/fincen-files/) are the biggest financial crime doers in the world and with institutions like [Deutsche and JP Morgan](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-09-21/highlights-from-the-fincen-files-on-banks-suspect-transactions) being particularly egregious offenders, Ackman could be using his big fucking brain to cook up the future of public accountability in finance.\n\nConsider the recent toothlessness of the organizations theoretically in charge of maintaining compliance with financial laws. There are examples that directly are relevant to everyone here who uses Robinhood (which picked [fucking Goldman Sachs](https://www.reuters.com/article/robinhood-ipo/exclusive-trading-app-robinhood-hires-goldman-sachs-to-lead-ipo-sources-idUSL1N2IO2TN) to lead their IPO). This includes their failure to disclose their practice of [selling order flow](https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-free-trading-on-robinhood-isnt-really-free-1541772001), for which they were fined a [piddly $1.25 million by FINRA](https://www.finra.org/media-center/newsreleases/2019/finra-fines-robinhood-financial-llc-125-million-best-execution). Robinhood's [top buyer of order flow is a little company called Citadel,](https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/b1m2p1cv68bx56/Twitter-Freaked-Out-Over-Robinhood-Selling-Its-Trade-Flow-But-the-App-and-Others-Have-Been-Doing-It-for-Years) which was fined [a mere $700,000](https://imgur.com/0yT6vpJ) for using this data to snipe retail orders from retards like you and your cousin Billy using [high frequency trading algorithms](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/091615/world-high-frequency-algorithmic-trading.asp), which is called frontrunning and is ***extremely not cool and extremely not legal*** (but crime definitely pays). For a company whose literal mission statement is to [\"democratize finance for all,\"](https://robinhood.com/us/en/support/articles/our-mission/) Robinhood sure does seem to put their finger on the scale in ways that unquestionably favor the big guys and by extension, themselves. By the way, the concept selling of order flow was invented by a dude you may have heard of who is currently serving a 150 year sentence for running a giant Ponzi scheme and will well-deservedly die in prison in the middle of Fucking Nowhere, [Bernard Madoff](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/paymentoforderflow.asp). Don't you wish the regulators would get off their knees, get the market maker dicks out of their mouths, and do their jobs?\n\nNow we return to Stripe. If you've ever bought anything on the internet, you've probably used Stripe to process the payment, even if you didn't realize it at the time. Stripe could wind up being one of the biggest and most valuable companies in the world if they play their cards right, and big brain haver [Paul Graham thinks they could wind up being the next Google in terms of valuation.](https://imgur.com/am4ONjr) Stripe is thought to [be valued somewhere from $70-100 billion right now](https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/28/what-to-make-of-stripes-possible-100-billion-valuation/), and we know that Ackman has about $7 billion in his war chest. I'd wager it's likely that the recent spate of IPOs by dog shit companies like AirBnB and DoorDash giving them ~$80 billion and ~$55 billion market caps respectively pushes Stripe's valuation toward the higher end of those current valuation estimates. Also take note of the second tweet in that screenshot, because it's strikes me as being not altogether dissimilar to what Ackman has previously said about what he thinks was his biggest miss going long, [Mastercard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxqTwpWizw4).\n\nStripe offers an [expansive and rapidly growing](https://imgur.com/OUSWYZi) anti-financial crimes platform called [Radar](https://stripe.com/radar) and is actively hiring for roles that seem like they'll be mission critical for the future of a company that's growing globally like [this one](https://stripe.com/jobs/listing/financial-crimes-investigation-payment-methods-lead-apac-chinese-speaker/2351914). They've already built the infrastructure that huge swathes of the internet economy run on and they're just getting rolling. \n\nGiven the utter levels of incompetence bordering on malfeasance by the syphilitic boomers with worm-filled brains that supposedly regulate finance, is it so implausible that an avowed optimist and guy who definitely thinks about this stuff more than you, [Patrick Collison,](https://imgur.com/5zwzFPm) would team up with the man running the [most investor-friendly SPAC ever](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/22/ackman-pershing-square-taking-no-compensation-for-new-spac-investment-vehicle.html) to truly bring the fight for equality of financial opportunity to the free market? I don't think so. Such an act would help subvert the power of creeps like [Ken Griffin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_C._Griffin), who almost certainly believes that you and everyone you love are pathetic little worms that live in a world belonging to him and his buddies.\n\n**TLDR: An offshoot of Stripe could still be the target and the merger of PSTH with Stripe Radar as an independent, publicly owned entity, could be a step toward truly democratizing the markets and saving America and the rest of the world from the leviathan of Big Capital.** \n\n\nPositions: short puts and long shares + March calls of PSTH in my active trading account, along with ~25% of my Roth IRA currently allocated to PSTH shares with the intention to sell about half of my mutual fund holdings after the next dividend goes out and put all of that money into PSTH.\n\nDisclaimer: I am retarded and this is not financial advice. Sorry for any typos that still exist, I proofread this a bunch of times and I tried my best.\n\nP.S: if I die for any reason after making this post, please do not accept the coroner's conclusion, because it means JP Morgan and Deutsche probably sent their hitters after me.",

I'm going to discuss this further in the next paragraph, but i wanted to show you guys this article ([https://wccftech.com/microvast-continues-to-generate-significant-hype-as-the-next-gen-battery-manufacturer-is-now-close-to-inking-a-definitive-merger-agreement-with-the-spac-tuscan-holdings/](https://wccftech.com/microvast-continues-to-generate-significant-hype-as-the-next-gen-battery-manufacturer-is-now-close-to-inking-a-definitive-merger-agreement-with-the-spac-tuscan-holdings/)) first. This was released on Dec 15, and was adjusted today by the author to write \"  the general consensus on the street indicates that Tuscan Holding\u2019s definitive **merger agreement (DA) with Microvast is likely to materialize within the next few weeks**\". The DA is coming very soon! and patient will get paid.\n\n\nI recently found an article that confirmed 1/3 of this story... see here https://news.kotra.or.kr/user/globalBbs/kotranews/782/globalBbsDataView.do?setIdx=243&amp;amp;amp;dataIdx=185796&amp;amp;amp;fbclid=IwAR27IvCwVloowrZqVxPZ0oeFGibhaVMFXEF5FD6HQwVrdiPGQyUZeo9u7Fs](https://news.kotra.or.kr/user/globalBbs/kotranews/782/globalBbsDataView.do?setIdx=243&amp;amp;amp;dataIdx=185796&amp;amp;amp;fbclid=IwAR27IvCwVloowrZqVxPZ0oeFGibhaVMFXEF5FD6HQwVrdiPGQyUZeo9u7Fs.\n\nIn the material section, the author says \" BASF is setting up a cathode material plant near Tesla's Berlin plant to supply Tesla with the goal of launching in 22 years. Collaboration with Tesla is emphasized, and it is expected to supply 400,000 electric vehicles cathode materials from 22nd.\". \n\nThe article highlights that 1) BASF and Tesla are working together, and 2) that \"cooperation is being predicted\" (with Tesla and Microvast). Although they did not plan to work together initially, there is a world where all three of them work together. I mean... look how close they are on google maps https://gyazo.com/c9c512ad5d297843d944e321bd2f9d49](https://gyazo.com/c9c512ad5d297843d944e321bd2f9d49. \n\nI am not investing in THCB because of this.

        "selftext": "Dear [r/SPACs](https://www.reddit.com/r/SPACs/) Community,\n\nIn this post, I'd like to share my 8-month SPAC investing journey. I want to thank you all for contributing to this Subreddit as the information found on here has been invaluable to me. I'm a novice to stock market investing/trading for the most part, and I'd like to ask some questions here towards the ond of this post, which I'm hoping to get some answers to by people who've been in the game for a while and have seen the ups and downs of SPACs and investing in general.\n\nSorry if this post is a bit lengthy. If you don't find any value in this post, please skip it. Otherwise, here comes my essay :)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**About Me**\n\nI'm a 24-year old living in Canada. I have a full-time job and make C$ 40,000 (US $31,000) per year, gross. My job has nothing to do with finance, business or economics. The first personal finance book I've ever read was Rich Dad, Poor Dad, about 6 years ago. Ever since, I knew that I'd like to get involved with some type of investing to own assets, which would help me make money outside of my regular job, ideally building passive income that would allow me to become financially independent. I'd like to think that I've always had good money managing skills, including saving and living frugally, but I realized a long time ago that building wealth just by directly trading my time for money and saving what I can would be an uphill battle, unless I found a very high-paying job.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Starting With Investing**\n\nIn September of 2019, I decided to put my savings into an account with Wealthsimple (a Robo Advisor) to get started with investing. Seven months later during the meltdown in March, I withdrew it all because I was scared of a V-shaped recovery not happening, as most people predicted. I took it all out at a 20% loss, which sucked and really hurt me emotionally. At that point, I got laid off temporarily, received the Canadian version of stimulus cheques, and decided that this is the perfect time to get a grip on investing and start managing my money actively instead of handing it over to some institution. I dove in head first and just watched every video I could on the stock market, investing, trading, technical analysis, fundamental analysis, brokers, and everything in between to get a very basic grasp of what is what.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Enter The SPAC**\n\nGetting my main stock market knowledge from YouTube videos, Investopedia, and Reddit, I came across VTIQ and watched it closely. I found this Subreddit, learned a lot, and realized that SPACs seem to good to be true. Foreseeing a clear catalyst (merger) that will result in an upswing in price? Minimal to no risk (if you get into commons at the right price) and the potential to double your money in a few weeks to several months? This sounded like a no-brainer to get in on.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**My Portfolio Growth**\n\nI opened an account with Questrade at the beginning of May. Initially, I funded it with US$ 8,600 and added US$ 2,680 later on for a total of US$10,680. Right now, my account is sitting at US$ 27,000, which is an increase of about **150% in 8 months**. To me, that's completely mind blowing. I've had two big '\"home runs\"; a 100% gain on SHLL (US$ 7,500 profit) and a 100% gain on SBE (US$10,000). The latter win is the equivalent of C$ 12,870. With my current job, that's a bit short of **4 months of work, or 640 hours, for that money had I directly traded my time for it**. I probably did 3 hours of research on SBE before building my position. Thats **640 hrs vs 3 hrs** of involvement for the same amount of money. How off is that ratio? It's still unfathomable to me to some extent that making money like this is possible. On a tangent, I can't believe that no personal finance basics, not even essentials like filing taxes, were taught to me in school. I don't know 1 person personally who has any stock market involvement, not even a close relative of mine who's an auditor and probably would be terrific at value investing if he got into it. To *ALL* of them, money plays a vital role in their lifes, and most of them got into certain professions only for the money they were hoping to be making. But wait, youre saying that there's a way to make money where your earnings are not in direct proportion to the time you put in? How is this not being discussed anywhere in academic settings, especially high school?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**My Outlook on SPACs and my Investment Approach**\n\nI understand that 2020 has been a very unique year given that the stock market has bounced right back after the sell off in late Feb/March, and we're at an all-time high again. Pretty much everything went up since March; you could've thrown a dart at whatever stock in March and probably made a decent return on it by now. Still, SPACs offered a unique advantage given that you have tremendously little risk on commons near NAV and sectors like renewable energy gaining serious traction with fossil fuels depleting at an alarming rate, California planning to ban the sale of new gas-powered cars by 2035, and Biden planning to set up a proper EV charging infrastructure, etc. Even though EV SPACs seem to be in a bubble to a lot of people, the renewable energy sector is in a world-wide upswing, and we're now in a terrific time to be a part of that trend and profit from tremendous growth opportunities for the next decades to come.\n\nMy approach so far has been to buy in on a rumour before LOI or DA *or* to buy in after some bleeding 6-8 weeks after a SPACs initial pop and then ride up the the price and sell out before the merger. I've invested in commons only, but I'll start adding some warrants too as they seem to give you very good leverage, but they also pose more risk should the merger not go through.\n\nI'll start putting 10-15% of all my gains into post SPACs that seem like great long-term investments once they come down in price, which I'll hold for the long term in a registered Canadian tax-free savings account (TFSA), such as HYLN. Most of my money I'll put in and out of positions within weeks to a few months, however. I do have a good appetite for growth, but I'll still make sound risk management my main priority. It's much better to lose out on runners and gains than to lose money by buying high, bagging positions and cutting losses. I think a lot of people don't realize that to break even on a 50% loss, you need a 100% gain.\n\nI've seen October and the brutal times for SPACs. I had been bag holding KCAC, RMG, and HCAC and others, and I experienced first-hand how quickly and drastically the tide can turn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**My Future Investing Journey**\n\nI see myself in investing full time eventually. My plan so far has been to grow my account to US $200k and then diversify by putting 1/4 of that amount into a down payment on a rental property, the mortgage of which a tenant will pay off. Then I'd trade the account from $150k up to 200k again and repeat that cycle, diversifying and growing my wealth across different asset classes. Once I have $200k in my account, I could also pay myself $32k/year (what I currently make through my 9-5) to quit my job and channel all of my attention into investing.\n\nThis will obviously take some time, and I don't expect every SPAC to yield a 100% return. However, you don't have to be right all the time. Given the low risk associated with NAV, I've felt comfortable so far having 30%-50% of my account value sitting in one SPAC. Once my account grows, I'll diversify some more and reduce the exposure to each individual SPAC for some better risk management.\n\nAll of this is honestly life-changing stuff. My mom gave me US$11.5k of her hard-earned money two weeks ago (I didn't count that in my portfolio growth decribed above, of course). I told her that I'll assume all of the risk and will give her back that exact amount to the cent if anything should go south, and I'll give her 100% of the profits (minus tax) if things go well. I put that money into GIK @ $11.44 and could already give her back her initial $11.5k + **$2k net,** which is a lot of money to me and to her. (I'll let it ride into the 20s though closer to merger and maybe manage to give her a 100% return before tax). My mom is extremely hard working and has always put the needs of me and my brother before hers. I've seen her slave away at low-paying night shift jobs only to put that money into my education and well-being. I'm extremely grateful for that and feel tremendously indebted to her. With SPACs, I feel like I'm able to give back some of that. I could give her extra money for retirement now that she can use to travel the world, or maybe I can even help her buy a small rental property eventually that'll add an additional income stream to her retirement.\n\nI also have a nephew and a niece, who are 3 and 2 years old respectively. I'd like to set up an investment account for both that I'm the custodian of where I'll put money into good green energy ETFs and stocks that could yield multiple 100%x to 1,000%x returns in the next two decades. That way, they'll have a great financial starting point when they enter their 20s.\n\nIt seems like the possibilities to helping others financially are endless, which has been a great driving factor for me in learning everything I can about SPACs and stock market investing/trading.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Questions**\n\nI'd like to ask some questions to experienced SPAC veterans and others who've been in the stock market for a long time and have seen the good and the bad.\n\n1. Who is investing full-time and has quit their job? If you did, do you have a degree in finance or similar that you think gave you a great fundamental understanding of the matter? I'm a firm believer in that everything can be self-taught and degrees aren't fully necessary unless the job you're going for mandates that you have a certain degree (MD, lawyer, financial advisor,...). I actually think that self-directed learning is the most effective way to learn because usually there is a strong desire to learn with pragmatic reasons behind it.\n\n2. Who has a regular job and does investing/trading on the side? If you are, how much time per day or week are you spending on research and trading/investing?\n\n3. At what point would you quit your job to pursue investing full time if you were me? I've been studying for 30 mins-1 hr each day since May and would probably need 2-3 more years to have a solid foundational understanding of the bigger picture. I know that going into this overnight is a pipe dream, and I'm trying to be realistic.\n\n4. What percentage of your portfolio is made up of SPACs? Are they in the \"growth\" section of your portfolio or is your entire portfolio in them?\n\n5. What's a realistic yearly total return on a growth-focused portfolio that's predominently focused on SPACs?\n\n6. Are SPACS here to stay? If I remember correctly, this sub was at around 16k members or so when I joined in May (I may be wrong on the actual number). There has been more money raised by SPACs in 2020 than ever before, and this Subreddit is growing exponentionally. Especially green energy companies have been all the rage with TSLA gaining attention since a few years and Biden being in office now. Will the profitability of SPACs stop eventually? Will there be an over-saturation of SPACs on the market, reducing quality picks? I believe that the money and safety lies in getting into commons at around NAV, before they're cool, but now a lot of pre-LOI SPACs are sitting 20-30% above NAV, which doesn't look good. Perhaps this will be cyclical, and positions will be sold during red phases (e.g, October 2020), but the overall demand and awareness is increasing.\n\n7. What's good life advice to someone like me who has been in this for only 8 months and is looking for some type of compass and guidance? How do you become a better investor or/and trader?\n\n8. Lastly, what are 3 things that you wish you had known earlier on in your journey that would've made you better, more knowledgable, help you avoid pitfalls, and speed up the process?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAgain, thank you all for contributing to this Subreddit. I hope that I'll be able to give even just a fraction of it back! Special thanks to Octopus Money Multipliers, Patrick Desjardins, and JMac Investing. I've learned a ton from your Youtube content. To a successful 2021 to everyone!",

(Link to his vid - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDrtvFfw-pw&amp;ab\\_channel=BloombergMarketsandFinance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDrtvFfw-pw&amp;ab_channel=BloombergMarketsandFinance))   \n\n\nCathie Wood, typically very optimistic (and still is in most of this vid), briefly mentions she believes a brief market correction is quite possible. \"...wouldn't be surprised to see some sort of \\[market\\] correction after this seasonally strong period that we're in.\" (Linked and time stamped to context - [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WCBUhQ6jJoM&amp;t=15m30s](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WCBUhQ6jJoM&amp;t=15m30s))  \n\n\nI am in between FOMO and \"just buy good and hold\" - I personally feel like a correction will happen. I tend to agree with Wood on a few things and what Chanos is describing is a little scary since if he's right and there's a tipping point with investors loosing faith due to corruption it could have somewhat of a snowball effect.   \n\n\nI could definitely see fraud companies going down, taking weak companies with them and having a reorganization of value for high value tech before strong companies bounce back.   \n\n\nAnyways just looking for other thoughts.   \n\n\nI'm not screaming P/E P/E! tech tech this and that, but the market has been strong and the fraud stuff feels a little like a tipping point may come about.",

        "selftext": "Been lurking here for awhile.  Thought I'd share a small story with everyone.  If you don't like reading, carry on your way, ya fckin degen.\n\nI began MY journey to degeneracy with a simple \"intro to understanding a business\" video I found on youtube.  The business model explored in this video was a simple lemonade stand.  Basic, straightforward fundamentals; perfect.  A striking, clearly intelligent, well spoken, demure, silver-haired gentleman guides me through the growth of this business model, beginning as single lemonade stand with a single investor, all the way through to a dividend paying, publicly traded company.  Had doubts at first but it ends up being pretty good stuff.  I noted the gentleman's name and carried on my way, to continue skimming the very surface of the business/finance world.\n\n   As you may have guessed, the gentleman in this video is Bill Ackman.  I took a liking to the guy.  I did some reading, watched some more videos.  Wasn't long before I found out about Pershing Square Tontine Holdings.  Didn't know what a SPAC was so I had to learn about those.  Turns out Spacman's SPAC isn't like other SPACs.  Okay cool, why?  Many reasons, the largest (as I understand them) being, the massive amount of capital at its disposal, and the \"tontine\" setup of share value/distribution, upon merger.  \n\nOkay so how'd I get here?  I found a post by u/infamousbreadfruit99 (if you see this, thank you btw, great stuff).  His post about going hard into SPACman's SPAC reminded of an interview I'd seen with him.  This video was about Ackman's missed opportunity with VISA/MASTERCARD going public.  The video starts with Ackman recounting sometime someone asked him the question in the title, \"What is the single best business in the world?\"  His answer?  \"If you could own a royalty on people spending money.\"  Smart guy, smart answer.\n\n...and AFAIK Stripe is... literally that... right?\n\nAnyway.  Felt like sharing.  Fck u, ya welcome.",

        "selftext": "AMD's newly released Radeon 6000 Series GPUs appear to have filled the performance gap with NVDA's RTX  3000 series cards while also being slightly cheaper. \n\nDigital Foundry: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QR9bj951UM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QR9bj951UM)\n\nRanked #4 for average benchmark on UserBenchmarks: [https://gpu.userbenchmark.com/](https://gpu.userbenchmark.com/)\n\nAMD seems like they have significantly improved their product line-up compared to the Radeon 5000 Series. AMD's value proposition for as a unified CPU and GPU manufacturer seems to have worked with last gen and current gen game consoles, as both Sony and Microsoft have opted for the same silicon. PC Users may also be attracted by the unified components value proposition and translate to higher PC CPU and GPU sales as AMD has filled the gap with both INTC and NVDA.\n\nDepending on how many GPUs AMD keeps in stock and the actual demand for new GPUs in 2021, I think the 6000 Series could chip away at NVDA's strong lead in market share for GPUs like with Intel CPUs. In doing so, this may attract investors away from NVDA, like with INTC, and boost AMD's stock significantly.\n\nIF (big if) AMD's next CPU/GPU line-up is to overtake NVDA next year, they could easily become the next $500B semi-conductor company in a few years. \n\nNow, what do the autists of WSB think? Can Lisa Su do it?\n\nPosition: 2/19/2021 $95 C. Might add $100 1/21/2022 C and a round lot on a dip, as the FDA's approval for the PFE vaccine may lead to another sector wide dip in tech stocks.",

        "selftext": "So put on my forensic hat and did some due diligence and narrowed who the intended target is going to for PSTH. \n\nRumors -Stripe, Coinbase, Fintech - As much as people want a fintech play I hate just being the bearer of bad news, but its not going to happen.  PSH/Ackman dont have a background in this area and it doesnt fit the mold of their intended target a MATURE company.  If you look at the Institutional investors, many penion funds are in their top holding which have a history of  investing in a companies with an established revenue and yoy growth.  \n\nWhen you breakdown all the mature companies with revenues in excess of $1B this is what you have as targets:\n\nTier V - Grocers, alot of grocers.  Wegmans would be the play here, but after having a record year for this industry its not a time to buy.\n\nTier IV - Retail, PSH/Ackman are very active in this area.  Menards currently #3 in home improvement would be the huge play in expanding out of the midwest, but Ackmans near $1B investment in Lowes and being on the board puts this in doubt.\n\nTier III - Convience chains, Wawa, Sheetz, QT.  These are huge resturant players and align with Ackmans experience even with Tim Horton.  The expansive growth and love of Wawa would be a hit.\n\nTier II - QSR Conglomerates - Inspiration Brands (Dunkin, Arbys, Buffalo Wild Wings, Jimmy Johns) this is actually what will be creating if they cannot buy one out right.  This is Bill Ackmans/PSH bread and butter.  They might be the most successful in the industry at doing this.\n\nTier I - Resturants - Like I said this is what they have a perfect track record of succeeding in.   Many companies are already public or under a Conglomerate but a few unicorns exist.  Five Guys, In &amp; Out, Whataburger but the ultimate unicorn in this industry is Subway.  They have the largest footprint of retail locations of any other restaurant (or business in the world).  The potential outreach of even adding coffee brands to Subway resturants would shake up the industry.  With $11B in revenue this would leave plenty cash on the table buy more resturant brand offerings \nand get them at 44k locations.  Look what Ackman did at Resturant Brands - got into Wendys and spun off Tim Hortons- did a spac on Burger King, bought Popeyes and then purchased Tim Hortons (after leaving Wendys) making $24B on QSR Conglomerate Resturant Brands he created.\n\nI actually created an interesting video on this, its actually is favorite one ive made to date.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/seaD3H9Hzx4",

        "selftext": "**\ud83d\ude80TWLO DD \u2013 When Opportunity Knocks You Blow the Door Open** \n\nNo, this isn\u2019t about PSTH. It\u2019s about my other favorite stock and second biggest holding, Twilio ($TWLO). \n\nI believe this to be a sleeping giant heading into 2021. Twilio ($TWLO) is a cloud services company that has seen exceptional gains over the course of the last three quarters. \n\n**Overview** \n\nTwilio ($TWLO) is a developer of communications software, cloud-based platform, and services. **Twilio is a leading communications platform firm that enables developers to integrate communications capabilities such as messaging, voice, and video into client-facing products, thus helping businesses strengthen customer engagement worldwide.** Its platform consists of the following sectors: engagement cloud, programmable communications cloud, and super network. \n\nVia TWLO, businesses can integrate real-time communications capabilities into business applications, expanding the number of touchpoints with their customers. Twilio\u2019s value proposition comes from the building blocks available to developers who can use software to assimilate new customer-facing offerings within their applications. Some simple use cases include automatic text notifications for appointments and two-factor authentication for secure services such as WhatsApp. The Programmable communications cloud software is a set of tools that enables developers to embed voice, messaging, and video capabilities into their applications. The super network is a software layer that allows customers' software to communicate with connected devices globally. \n\n**In other words, they are involved in sales happening online re: e-commerce and get a chunk of that action.** \n\nLet the tendies rain down amongst thee [https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/tony-montanas-little-friend-story-874414](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/tony-montanas-little-friend-story-874414) \n\nTwilio has done its own research on this and that coronavirus response accelerated digital communication strategies by about six years for businesses. \n\nThe CEO cites this in the Cramer interview and uses the very interesting of NIKE as a digital salesforce using TWLO platforms to reach out to customers. The change in focus can be illustrated by Twilio\u2019s stock run this year, growing 277% year to date. The shares climbed 1.6% higher Tuesday to new highs, closing at $370.75. \n\n**Fundamentals** \n\n\u00b7 Most Recent Price = 362.88\n\n\u00b7 52 Week High = 374.49\n\n\u00b7 52 Week Low = 68.06 \n\n\u00b7 Average Daily Volume = 2.75M\n\n\u00b7 Market Cap = 54.85B Consensus \n\n**Analyst Ratings** \n\nBuy 20/Overweight 1/Hold 1/Underweight 1/Sell 1 \n\n**Price Targets** \n\nRanges from high 300\u2019s to $550 \n\nFinancials (an actual \u201cFortress Balance Sheet\u201d as Jamie Dimon would say) \n\nI really cannot say enough about their balance sheet. Its bananas. \n\nTotal Assets = 5.15B \n\nTotal Liabilities = 871.11M\n\nTotal Equity = 4.28B \n\n\\*KEY Financial: TWLO has a Current Ratio (CR) of 8.22, which is insane. For reference, JPMs is 0.88. It\u2019s a metric used to convey overall financial strength using current assets and liabilities, fyi. \n\n**Big Shareholders:** \n\n\u00b7 The Vanguard Group, Inc. \n\n\u00b7 Morgan Stanley Investment Management, Inc.\n\n\u00b7 Fidelity Management &amp; Research Co. LLC \n\n\u00b7 BlackRock Fund Advisors \n\n**MORNING STAR REPORT SUMMARY**\n\n\u00b7 Twilio has elite retention rates within the software industry, with gross retention hovering around 97% and net dollar retention north of 120%. \n\n\u00b7 We think this is indicative of the stickiness of the firm\u2019s platform. \n\n\u00b7 The proposed acquisition of Segment ties together Twilio\u2019s software stack and will increase business reliance on the firm for customer engagement. \n\n\u00b7 As Twilio invests more in Solutions APIs, there should be a shift away from lower margin products such as messaging, which should also contribute to increased recurring revenues.\n\n\u00b7 \u201cWe view narrow-moat Twilio as having a long growth runway ahead, as the company continues to make strategic organic and inorganic investments to expand its platform.\u201d \n\n**Key Points re the Bull Case** \n\nSeveral big-time analysts/names have come out calling for a big bull session for TWLO in 2021 \n\n**Alex Zukin** \u2013 hugely respected and respected analyst from RBC ranked TWLO as the top software pick for 2021 - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5IXWtG9jQU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5IXWtG9jQU)\n\n**Jim Cramer**, you know him \u2013 He\u2019s also come out as a big TWLO bull. [https://twitter.com/jimcramer/status/1341822886043070469](https://twitter.com/jimcramer/status/1341822886043070469) \n\nEnough from analysts and Cramer though, there are people in the background that lead these people to post about stocks. The managers at Baron Funds are who I am talking about. Baron Funds is incredibly bullish on TWLO. Chief among their managers is **Alex Umansky**.  \n\n[https://www.barrons.com/articles/stock-fund-soaring-despite-coronavirus-51596060341](https://www.barrons.com/articles/stock-fund-soaring-despite-coronavirus-51596060341) \n\n**Oh, and if you don\u2019t know who or what Baron Funds are, look into it. Ron Baron is who laid the groundwork for me becoming bullish on TSLA in Q1.** \n\nBaron has been in on TSLA since 2013. He has been mocked and laughed at over the years for his huge position. Through the pandemic, he has not sold a single share, and only laments not being able to buy more. Even ARK got out of TSLA to some degree on this bull run. Baron Fund has done DD on TSLA and are projecting, based on numbers, revenue, and management (not hype) another 5-10x gain over the next 5 years. Some Ron Baron Balling on YouTube. \n\nBasically, DUNKING on the silly TSLA bears: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5QJlTMADGQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5QJlTMADGQ) \n\n[https://www.cnbc.com/video/2020/10/14/billionaire-investor-ron-baron-tesla-will-become-a-2-trillion-company.html](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2020/10/14/billionaire-investor-ron-baron-tesla-will-become-a-2-trillion-company.html) \n\nAnyways, these are the people placing TWLO in their funds in big numbers now.

        "selftext": "Good Friday evening to all of you here on r/StockMarket. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning December 7th, 2020.\n\n# **Any progress on stimulus could give the market a boost in the week ahead  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/04/stimulus-hope-markets-focus-next-week.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Stimulus to help the economy and vaccines to stop the virus are expected to the be the main focus in markets in the week ahead.\n*****\n&gt; Efforts to move along a fiscal package in Congress picked up momentum in the past week with Congressional leaders sounding conciliatory, and a bi-partisan group of senators pushing their own $900 billion proposal.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIt probably boils down to how much [Senate Majority Leader] Mitch McConnell is willing to deal, and I don\u2019t know what the answer is to that,\u201d said Mike Schumacher, head of rate strategy at Wells Fargo. \u201cIf it\u2019s going to happen, next week is the week. The government runs out of money on Friday. Congress has to come up with a funding scheme.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Strategists have said the two events could be tied, but Congress could also push through a spending resolution without including stimulus. Some programs will expire at the end of the month, if Congress does not provide funding, including unemployment benefits for millions of Americans.\n*****\n&gt; The on again, off again stimulus talks have led to skepticism in the market, and sets it up for a move higher if there is anything officially announced. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t think it\u2019s fully baked in. I would say the stimulus is a positive catalyst, unless it\u2019s less than $900 billion,\u201d said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities.\n*****\n&gt; While stocks surged in the past week, bond yields also moved higher. Yields move opposite price, and bond yields have been rising on stimulus expectations. More spending means more debt, and that sends rates higher.\n*****\n&gt; The 10-year was at 0.97% Friday, and appeared ready to move back to the 1% level for the first time since March.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIs it the case here, stimulus is already factored in, and will people take their money and run?\u201d said Schumacher.\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 gained 1.7% in the past week, ending Friday at 3,699, a record high. The Dow also ended up 1% at a record 30,218, and Nasdaq gained 2.1% to a record 12,464.\n*****\n&gt; # Getting jabbed\n&gt; Vaccine news has been a catalyst for the market\u2019s surge since early November, when Pfizer first revealed the high efficacy of its vaccine. Since then Moderna and Astra-Zeneca both revealed results of their own vaccines.\n*****\n&gt; A Food and Drug Administration advisory committee meets Thursday on emergency use authorization for the Pfizer and BioNTech vaccine.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThey\u2019re starting to roll it out in the U.K, and that\u2019s something that\u2019s going to be watched here to see how it unfolds,\u201d said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist Prudential Financial. \u201cThat\u2019s the next issue for the market. The deliveries, the distributions. Are people being jabbed? These are all questions the market is concerned about about because they\u2019re looking forward to it unrolling smoothly in the U.S.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; About 3 million people will be vaccinated in the initial rollout. Moderna\u2019s vaccine is expected to be approved the following week, and by year-end both vaccines are expected to reach 20 million people in the U.S.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe vaccine news has started to see a bit of diminishing return in terms of its wow factor,\u201d said Hogan. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be some volatility around the logistics.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Krosby said the virus remains in the forefront for the market because of the continuing spread and its economic impact as activities are shut down. California Thursday announced new restrictions with stay at home advisories in some regions.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe big question is how long does the Covid surge last?\u201d Krosby said.\n*****\n&gt; The virus shutdowns appear to be behind a slowdown in the labor market, and economists say it could slow activity into the first quarter. November job growth of 245,000 was about 200,000 less than expected. That makes Thursday\u2019s weekly jobless claims more important for markets.\n*****\n&gt; There is also CPI and PPI inflation data Thursday and Friday.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThere is this push pull in the market regarding inflationary pressures,\u201d said Krosby. \u201cIt\u2019s not expected, which is why if it does print higher, it could ignite the conversation regarding inflation.\u201d\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/PZEBIS8.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/ypJI3Vy.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/s01kzjN.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/7Y1RKiX.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/nF9LHWm.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/F99YkSI.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/00G6LqZ.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/8OK0Nmw.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!]())**\n(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/PDrxDY8.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/5rCf9oe.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/VsZzlKU.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/moiEQsJ.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Stocks and Bonds Both in Rally Mode\n\n&gt; When it comes to equity market performance in a given month, it doesn't get much better than November. While the S&amp;P 500's total return of 10.95% in the month was only the second-best monthly performance of the year, it was still enough to rank as the third-best month for the S&amp;P 500 in the last thirty years and just the ninth month since 1980 that it was up 10%+.\n\n&gt; The chart below shows the S&amp;P 500's annualized total return over the last one, two, five, ten, and twenty years and compares the current returns to the historical average. For the last year, the S&amp;P 500's total return has been 17.5% which is nearly six full percentage points higher than the historical average. For the last two years, the annualized return has been nearly as strong at 16.8%, and it is actually even stronger relative to the historical average of 10.5%. Moving further out the time horizon, the S&amp;P 500's annualized returns drift lower, and while the five and ten-year annualized returns are greater than average, the S&amp;P 500's annualized gain of 7.3% in the last 20 years is more than 3.5 percentage points below the historical average of 10.9%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120120-SP-500-Act-vs-Avg.png))**\n\n&gt; The last couple of years haven't just been strong for equities. Over the last year, long-term US Treasuries, as measured by the Merrill Lynch 10+ Year US Treasury Index, have rallied 15.7%, which is more than six full percentage points greater than the historical average of 9.5%. Over the last two years, returns have been even stronger with an annualized gain of nearly 20%, or more than double the historical average of 9.1%! While the last two years have been strong for US Treasuries, the last five, ten, and twenty years have all seen returns of between one and two percentage points below their historical average.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120120LT-Treas-Act-vs-Avg.png))**\n\n&gt; Lately, when you see rallies in the equity market, it tends to be accompanied by a decline in treasuries as yields rise. In November, though, that wasn't the case. Even with the S&amp;P 500 up 10.95%, long-term US Treasuries rallied just over 1%. So how uncommon is it for stocks to rally like they did in November while bonds also rally. Actually, it is not very uncommon at all. The table below shows the nine months since 1980 where the S&amp;P 500's total return in a given month was 10% or more, and of those months, long-term treasuies also rallied in every month but one (October 2011).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120120-Stocks-Up-10.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Manufacturer Recovery Continues\n\n&gt; This morning, the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) released a less positive outlook for the US manufacturing sector. The headline number for ISM's Manufacturing index fell from 59.3 last month down to 57.5. A drop was expected, but the actual results were worse than the drop to 58.0 that had been forecasted. That reading indicates that the manufacturing sector continued to grow in November but at a slower rate than October.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120120-ISM-Headline.png))**\n\n&gt; Similar to the various Federal Reserve bank surveys from around the country, breadth in the November report was more negative than in recent months. Of the ten indices excluding the headline number, only three were higher in November: Backlog Orders, Supplier Deliveries, and Export Orders. Additionally, two indices\u2014Customer Inventories and Employment\u2014showed contractionary readings.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120120-ISM-Table1.png))**\n\n&gt; One theme of the report was that orders remain very healthy. New Orders fell from 67.9 to 65.1, but that is a sixth consecutive month of expansionary readings. Although the index was lower this month, meaning new order growth decelerated, it remains in the top decile of historical readings. As new orders have continued to grow, so too have backlogs. The index for Backlog Orders has continued to press higher, rising to 56.9 from 55.7. That is in the 88th percentile of all months and is now at the highest level since August of 2018. Demand continues to improve with new orders coming in at a historically strong pace, even though it is slower than last month, and order backlogs have once again risen as a result.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120120-ISM-Orders.png))**\n\n&gt; As new order growth decelerated, so too did production. The index fell from 63.0 in October to 60.8 last month. That is still consistent with growth (readings above 50) in production but at the slowest rate since June. One factor that potentially had an impact on the slowdown in production is issues with suppliers. The index for Supplier Deliveries rose for the fourth month in a row in November and reached the highest level since May. Higher readings in the Supplier Deliveries index indicates longer lead times and vice versa. In other words, products from suppliers have been taking longer to reach manufacturers, in turn, impacting productivity.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120120-ISM-Prod-Supp.png))**\n\n&gt; Although suppliers appear to have some constraints and production has slowed slightly, business inventories rose for the second month in a row even as more and more firms report that customer inventories are too low. The index for Customer Inventories now sits in the bottom 2% of historical readings after dropping another 0.4 points in November. At 36.3, the index is at the lowest level since June of 2010. That low reading can be considered positive for future production.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120120-ISM-Inventorie.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Big Gains In November Steal From Santa\n\n&gt; What a month November was! Here are some of the highlights:\n\n&gt; * Best month for Dow since January 1987 (11.9%) and best November since 1928\n&gt; * Best month ever for the STOXX 600 (16.7%)\n&gt; * Best month ever for the Russell 2000 (18.3%)\n&gt; * Best month for the S&amp;P 500 (10.8%) and Nasdaq (11.8%) since April 2020\n&gt; * Best month for Dow Transports since October 2011 (12.1%)\n&gt; * Best month from PHLX Semiconductor Index since March 2003 (18.4%)\n&gt; * Best month for Industrials (16.0%) and Financials (16.8%) since April 2009\n&gt; * Second best month ever for energy (28.0%)\n\n&gt; A way better than expected earnings season, a likely split Congress, and major breakthroughs on the vaccine front all helped stocks soar last month,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cAdd ongoing support from the Federal Reserve as the cherry on top and we are looking at a truly historic month on many levels.\u201d\n\n&gt; Here\u2019s all the Dow monthly returns since 1900. Last month was the best return since January 1987. Now before you go out and sell because you see 1987, remember the S&amp;P 500 added another 20% the seven months after the huge gains in early 1987.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/12.2.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; It was the best November for the S&amp;P 500 since November 1928.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/12.2.20-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Small caps soared on the likelihood of taxes staying lower due to a divided Congress and vaccine progress, with the Russell 2000 adding more than 18% for the best month ever, topping the previous record from February 2000.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/12.2.20-Blog-Chart-3.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; What happens after a big month? Well, history says a 10% monthly gain is quite bullish. In fact, we had a 10% plus rally back in April 2020 and shared this same chart at that time. Sure enough, returns have been strong this time around as well. \u201cThe bottom line is the huge gains in November could actually be the start of something much stronger,\u201d according to Ryan Detrick. \u201cAlso, this was the second month of 2020 with a 10% gain. The only other year to do that? 1982, which kicked off a historic bull market.\u201d\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/12.2.20-Blog-Chart-3.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Turning to December, this month is widely known to be quite bullish, as Santa comes to town, people feel good, and stocks tend to do well. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, since 1950, December has been the second best month of the year, with only November better. December had been the best month of the year until the historic 9.2% drop in 2018. As a result, December hasn\u2019t been quite as strong over the past 10 and 20 years.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/12.2.20-Blog-Chart-4.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Breaking it down even more, a big rally in November can potentially steal some of December\u2019s thunder. As after a 5% or 10% rally in November, the returns in December are more muted. The flipside to this though is if the S&amp;P 500 is up more than 10% for the year (like 2020), then stocks have benefited from some performance chasing and have tended to do better.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/12.2.20-Blog-Chart-5.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; What does it all mean? After the historic move in November we wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see below average returns in December. We do believe this is a new bull market and lasting economic cycle of growth, but overall sentiment is getting quite stretched and this increases the potential for some near-term weakness.

I have come out of retirement and taken a break from my usual routine of fucking sluts, yachting around the world and getting my toes licked by Dan Bilzerian to speak once again with my follow dumbasses, bagholders, suckers, Young Trillionaires\u2026 and yes, even the hater\u2019s. I have come to pump the shit out of \\*\\*UHHHH I MEAN\\*\\*\u2026 I have come to... \\*recommend\\* a stock that I think you all should buy. Heh heh, yeah that\u2019ll work. You might remember me as \\[the guy whose reddit post single-handedly killed WeWork\\]([https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/d6618z/real\\_dd\\_i\\_read\\_analysed\\_all\\_180\\_pages\\_of\\_the/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/d6618z/real_dd_i_read_analysed_all_180_pages_of_the/)). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*Clever Leaves\\*\\* (Listed as $SAMA right now, soon to be $CLVR on Dec 18th once they\u2019re added to the Nasdaq) is basically one thing \u2013 They\u2019re a low cost producer of pharmaceutical-grade skunk weed. They have bigass facilities in Colombia  with 10million square feet of cannabis production, and they\u2019re definitely not involved in any cocaine production. If you\u2019ve seen Narcos, you know that nothing shady ever happens in Columbia. I haven\u2019t watched it but I have it on good word that there\u2019s talk about \u201cPlato and Plomo\u201d, which I think means Plantains and Plumage. A tropical paradise, no?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo what\u2019s the problem with weed companies like ACB, Tilray and Cronos? Well, they put the cart before the horse with their acquisition-before-product strategies. If you don\u2019t know what that means because you\u2019re a 14 year old using your parents\u2019 names to make a Robinhood account, it basically means they fucked themselves over by expanding too fast into buying random fucking companies (Bespoke grow rooms, anyone?) with their investor money without actually growing their weed at an affordable rate. The cost of producing weed isn\u2019t economical in Canada because the conditions for growing it there suck and the labor costs and taxes are insane. A bunch of companies set up shop in Canada since it was the first real country to legalize weed (\\*\\*Ur\\*\\*u\\*\\*g\\*\\*u\\*\\*ay\\*\\* doesn't count) and because they were fans of some guys called Tim Horton and Terry Fox, but ironically gimped themselves in the process. CLVR is going to sell weed to hipster Europeans who don't know how much they're overpaying, it fucking owns. They already have production and offices in Portugal and Germany. \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCLVR is going to eliminate all competitors in the end. \\*Period\\*. Any dumbass can throw a seed in the ground in their backyard and piss on it daily and harvest enough pissweed to get them through the winter. Legalized weed is a cannibalistic exercise and a terrible investment because once you legalize, the margin on the product drops through the floor and it gets really fucking hard to produce the product (you know, the actual weed?) at a price that won\u2019t see you burn through cash like an ashy crackhead on his last rock. If you are actually reading this whole post and didn't just glaze over and buy in because it was really long, PM me and I'll send you my wife's boyfriend's nudes that she sends me to mock how much of a loser I am. Regardless, \\*\\*the only way to make money in legalized weed is to grow at insanely low prices and under cut the competition which will allow you to buy up market share and then buy out the competition, and then start to raise prices\\*\\*, which is CLVR's strategy. I learned this from a scene in The Wire btw.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI once called ACB the Goodwill of pot stocks because they bring in just about anything they can find and it\u2019s staffed by retards. CLVR is the opposite, the people running the company have been there from the start and don\u2019t get fired and replaced once a year like most Canadian pot stock company execs. \\[Here's a video of the CEO explaining their company\\]([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkCE-DTSYuA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkCE-DTSYuA)). I gotta be honest kinda zoned out but he doesn't come off like a grifter to me so that's probably a good thing. He used to work in Blackstone and was an actual investor, which is basically the opposite of a WSB poster, so that means he's undoubtedly profitable. The rest of the management and SPAC team is a group of rich-ass investment banker crackers, so you just know they're finna make some coin. Here are some more rocket emojis. \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDoes CLVR make any money right now? NOPE. Does that matter? Hell fuckin no, are you retarded?? But do you know how much money that ACB, TLRY and CRON burn through on a monthly basis? An absolute fuckload more. \\[Here's their prospectus if you want some pretty pictures and fewer words that will convince you that this is the right decision\\]([https://samcospac.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/SAMA-Clever-Leaves-LOI-Investor-Presentation.pdf](https://samcospac.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/SAMA-Clever-Leaves-LOI-Investor-Presentation.pdf)).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo sum up - $CLVR 1/15/2021 $20c, gg ez no re.

        "selftext": "Microvast has IATF 16949 certification, which is an internationally recognized certification that confirms Microvast adheres to certain quality control processes in their manufacturing. Obtaining this certification requires an audit which involves two physical visits from an auditor, so Microvast definitely has functioning factories that looked convincing to at least two westerners. In addition, a surveillance audit is conducted each year after the certification is issued to ensure compliance. The IATF certifies GM and other auto manufacturers, so they are quite legitimate.\n\nHow do I know all this? If you go to [this](https://www.microvast.com.cn/about/dow-datas) page on MV's Chinese website, they have a pdf of their certification. If you punch registration ID given on that certificate into the certification checker on the IATF website [here](https://www.iatfglobaloversight.org/) (look at the column on the right), then you can see that Microvast currently holds certification.

I know their German HQ is a parking lot on google maps, but those street view photos were taken in 2008, well before any expansion into Germany occurred. Also, there have been videos about Microvast on YouTube since 2012 (first link below)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ONJwQDQApU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ONJwQDQApU)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f\\_XcImvle34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_XcImvle34)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y06l2F3Il7M](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y06l2F3Il7M)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gFAh3JzMis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gFAh3JzMis)\n\nThese vids seem scammy and low budget but this is typical for a Chinese company, they hire white monkey voice actors to make their company seem legit to other chinese so the quality is crap because the videos weren't meant to be viewed by people who understand english anyway. The point is that they were around and posting vids in 2012, a long time ago.\n\nThe point of mentioning this is that if this is a scam, it's incredibly elaborate and they are playing the long game. The scam is so well done that they actually created a functioning battery company in the process. You might as well buy THCB",

        "selftext": " Now, what is Nano-x Imaging, and why should you degenerates know about this company? Some people refer to them as the TSLA of the medical imaging world, Ill try to summarize wtf NNOX does as quickly as possible in the next \"few\" points.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1.**NNOX (** [Nanox.vision](https://www.nanox.vision/) **)** is a medical imaging startup that has developed a X-Ray source magnitudes of orders cheaper than current technology. Its basically the same improvement as going from an incandescent bulb to a modern led.\n\nWhy is this important? X-Rays, Ct scans, and other radiological imaging is currently expensive as shit resulting in 2/3rds of the world being unable to access the technology. NNOX hopes to make their \"biobeds\" so cheap that they'll basically give them away for free \\~ 14k vs the millions that the machines cost nowadays therefore allowing them to implement a better pricing model.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2. They will be implementing a pay per scan model allowing poorer areas without access to top radiologists to submit scans and have them processed by NNOX's radiologists and machine learning network.\n\nThis is the future more than the proprietary and patented X-ray source that will make this model possible. Cheap scans for the whole world will result in boatloads of data on every single disease and injury detectable by x-ray imaging, and that can be used to train their AI to not only make scans even cheaper but to have them process magnitudes faster and more accurately than human doctors.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n3. They have a lot of partnerships with major payers, and have board members that are already loaded. (SK Telecom, Foxconn, SK Hynix) They have 0 reasons to risk their money and reputations on something that wont make a dent in their net worth until NNOX demonstrates and establishes their technology globally.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n4. Finally and probably the most important point is that Citron tried to shit on them calling them a fraud. Too bad their prototype was successfully demonstrated at the RSNA conference and Citrons report was quickly disproven as a work of garbage. (Reports disproving them: [Nanox | DKA](https://www.dka.global/nanox-imaging) , [(19) Nanox Live Demonstration - RSNA 2020 - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZETn3Cajio&amp;ab_channel=Nano-XImaging) )\n\nThis absolute unit really tried to convince everyone that equivalency approval isn't good enough because sir Andrew fucking Left himself discovered a new type of light that isn't equivalent to X-rays \\*autism intensifies\\* .\n\n/s if you didn't get it , basically if you think that LED's cant emit equivalent light to incandescent bulbs don't buy this stock.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyways, I can go on and on about how much good shit they have gong for em but I have the attention span of goldfish so its best to just read some of the linked articles.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: \ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\ude80\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nArticles, sources and shit:\n\n[Nanox's X-ray technology could be important. | Engadget](https://www.engadget.com/nanox-arc-x-ray-demonstration-160045549.html)\n\n[How AI May Prevent The Next Coronavirus Outbreak (forbes.com)](https://www.forbes.com/sites/simonchandler/2020/03/05/how-ai-will-prevent-the-next-coronavirus-pandemic/?sh=33d74404ac62)\n\n[X-Ray Startup Enlists SK Hynix to Disrupt Century-Old Market (yahoo.com)](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/x-ray-startup-enlists-chipmaker-095932201.html)\n\nLive Demo:\n\n[(19) Nanox Live Demonstration - RSNA 2020 - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZETn3Cajio&amp;ab_channel=Nano-XImaging)\n\nHere's the debunked shit if you wanna to read it for yourself:\n\n[NANO-X-a-Complete-Farce-on-the-Market.pdf (citronresearch.com)](https://citronresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/NANO-X-a-Complete-Farce-on-the-Market.pdf)",

They made the dark pool drop so big that you might as well hold, thats the only way we win ...or you can impulsively drop your shares and accept a 30% drop for no reason.

        "selftext": "**Background**\n\niRobot is a US-based consumer robot company. It designs and builds robots that assist consumers with the solutions for the activities to be carried both inside and outside of the home.\n\nIt derives the nearly all of it's revenue from it's in house cleaning robots. iRobot price range for it's robots are between $250 to $1000+. The cheapest robots give a simplistic cleaning such as just bouncing around the room multiple times to clean whereas the most expensive robots have AI to detect and smart map your room/house and efficiently clean.\n\nThe big selling points of this top tier robot range is the auto emptying bin functionality that has made these robots almost completely autonomous without much human interaction needed. This high tier product range is where iRobot really shines compared to it's competitors.\n\n**Competitors**\n\niRobot's biggest risk in my opinion is it's competitors.\n\nThere are already quite a few such as Shark, Ecovacs, Roborock, Neato, iLife, and eufy. As autonomous vacuum cleaners become more popular (and they will) we can expect more competitors to enter this space as well potentially causing margins to be pushed down.  Dyson, Bissell, Hoover, Samsung, LG and Panasonic are the traditional heavyweights and are also entering this space. Dyson especially has a history of innovation and could be a future threat.\n\nWhile iRobot has lost 12% market share since 2016 the overall market is significantly bigger, especially for the upper end product mix.\n\nThis is great news for iRobot as their products have the most added value in the upper range of this mix with features such as:- Auto emptying into bins- Smart AI pathfinding- Efficient charging of it's robots- Deep clean capability\n\nThe upper end of it's products have great reviews online. This youtube video explains the differences between the competitors very well and rates iRobot the best in the cheapest and most expensive categories for 2020: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYjlDwY9wPo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYjlDwY9wPo)\n\n**Numbers**  \nOpearing margin: 11%  \nNo debt.  \nPEG Ratio: 0.78.  \nROIC vs WACC 22% to 10.11%\n\niRobot has some really great numbers relative to it's peers. It's operating margins especially are indictive of a big MOAT and consumer loyalty.\n\n**DCF**\n\nI used Aswath Damoradan's spreadsheet for this. Here are the inputs:\n\n**18% CAGR** was chosen for years 2-5. Considering the rapidly expanding autonomous vacuum market and now COVID-19 has accelerated this very rapidly due to more people spending time at home therefore they are spending more on household items.\n\nThe recent revenue growths of 40% in the last quarter are due to the full lockdowns people have had. I expect this to drop in the following years to 18% on average.\n\n**10% EBIT Margin** was chosen for year 10. COVID-19 has had a big impact so far this quarter on margins due to the huge demand. This will level off though.\n\niRobot has a loyal product base and as they have shifted more towards the high end products I expect them to acheive margins of around 10% in year 10.\n\n**3 years** was chosen for the margins to converge. This is because the short term spike from covid should level off.\n\n**2.5 sales to cap ratio** was chosen. COVID-19 has stalled the companies plans to transition away from China to other parts of Asia, including Malaysia to 2021. This transitioning is happening due to the tarrifs between China &amp; the U.S. This should cause a short term dip in sales to capital ratio in 2021 due to having to reinvest heavily to move it's operations out of China.\n\nFor some reason this sub doesn't allow images so I can't post the full thing. Here's the full DCF: [https://www.reddit.com/r/UndervaluedStonks/comments/kc9xbz/irobot\\_a\\_great\\_company\\_undervalued\\_by\\_43/](https://www.reddit.com/r/UndervaluedStonks/comments/kc9xbz/irobot_a_great_company_undervalued_by_43/)\n\nCurrent price: $74.32   \nEstimated price: $128.98   \nMargin of safety: 43%",

        "selftext": "Hello guys Fred here with another serious DD post , this time on the merger of BFT with Paysafe\n\n\\--&gt; for details just watch my video on youtube, and don't forget to like and subscribe if you like the content. --&gt;  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnuZUAs9ruc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnuZUAs9ruc) \n\n\\--&gt; in summary :\n\n\\-Bill Foley is the mvp here, track record of reducing costs in companies while creating more value. ( cost margins are a problem right now at paysafe )\n\n\\-2nd highest marketshare when it comes to the e-wallet environment,  (rising total adressable market)\n\n\\- MVP when it comes to the igaming segment  and market volume is going to increase by atleast 300% by  2025 ( biggest marketshare) ( rising TAM ) ((\\*\\*All the kids are paying for their skins with paysafe prepaid cards\\*\\*))\n\n\\-4th biggest player when it comes to integrated payment methods. ( rising TAM)\n\nInteresting side notes :\n\nExclusive contract with draftkings for payments in the UK.\n\ncontract with Roblox for prepaid cards.\n\nYear on year revenue growth always in the double digits. Speaking of revenue lets take a look at some numbers compared to competitors.\n\nSadly we don't know the net income of paysafe, we do know  that the ebitda is hovering around 500 million for 2020. Are they profitable? NO reason : they did some acquisitions and probably have some debt payments running, but nothing major .[https://www.mobilepaymentstoday.com/news/paysafe-group-acquires-openbucks/](https://www.mobilepaymentstoday.com/news/paysafe-group-acquires-openbucks/)\n\nLets look at the market cap comparison/ share price / revenue of competitors :\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3urxzjr4n5561.png?width=3888&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7429e2d78063921a97c1deaf1fae6c271e36c829\n\nAs you can see, based on the revenue of 2021 compared to the current share price. Paysafe should be valued at 25.5 compared to Square and 91.8 compared to shift 4 ( shift 4 also isn't profitable at the moment)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nanother intresting fact: paysafe was a public company back in 2017 on the London stock exchange. back than it had a net profit of 180 million and shares outstanding were 242 million --&gt; eps 0.78 --&gt; P/E ratio : 19.7 = very respectable. certainly in the crazy current market with 50+ P/E ratio's LOL.\n\nOfc this was 3 years ago and the company changed a lot ( did acquisitions , invested in other markets. But now  these investmentss will start to pay off and with Bill foley at the wheel costs will get cut.\n\nHonestly with all this in mind. This stock is easily valued at 50 dollars + by the end of 2021.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFull disclosure :  in for 4k at 12.2",

        "selftext": "I know this is been a hotly debated and polarizing topic here. But the fact of the matter is there is just too much smoke for there not to be fire. I have seen a lot of \"yolo\" posts about this ticker that are 95% in the stock.... when you have a floor of 25% downside risk I don't think that qualifies as a yolo, more just an asymmetrical investment and probably a smart move in a volatile market.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVfS0vtH6mc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVfS0vtH6mc)\n\nThis video pretty much outlines why it's a safe bet and a sound investment.\n\nbut that's not why I'm here tonight. This has been a long time coming.\n\nLet me start by saying that I got into \"investing\" years ago with a couple hundred bucks just fucking around on E\\*TRADE spending $7 to buy $25 worth of stock only to find out it was $7 to sell it. Later on, I found out about an app called Robinhood that was made for window licking retards like myself. It was glorious, I could day trade up to 3x in one day before I lost everything and got locked out of my account for a week. I enjoyed it greatly.\n\nThen on December 23rd 2019 I saw an article on Marketwatch about how Draftkings was going public thru a SPAC. I didn't know what the fuck a SPAC was but it was just days before Christmas so I had a couple days off to research it. I took the couple hundred bucks in my account and I bought all the $DEAC I could get my hands on. Since then I have found this sub with other degenerate gamblers and retards like myself. Between the success of $DEAC / $DKNG, $PLTR, and $TQQQ (and others I can not mention) I managed to turn that 2K into over $80,000\n\nI have been following the $PSTH saga thru infamousbreadfruit AKA Yolocapitalinc on twitter, since early October...\n\nThe Jackie Reses situation is just too coincidental. She previously she spent seven years handling mergers and acquisitions at Goldman Sachs, the works at the Head of Square Capital for 5 years, then joins the board of $PSTH, then goes on Twitter and \"liked\" a picture of the Stripe logo... v sus if you ask me...\n\nThe recent influx of videos to hit twitter have the story\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ugWZau6Tds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ugWZau6Tds)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqrpbMQVWS8\\&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqrpbMQVWS8&amp;feature=youtu.be)\n\nI don't come on here much to be honest but there's also some good DD that has been posted in the past that is easily accessible. Anyways I know I am going on and on but the point is I am going all fucking in.\n\nI recently refinanced on my house to get a great rate and decided to take some cash out to \"invest\"...\n\nI'm taking the 80K profit this year from that other shit, throwing the cash out from the mortgage (20K) into half option calls, half shares on $PSTH. Yolo is relative. I basically live paycheck to paycheck and this is well over a year's salary.\n\n[I found this one to be one that is actually worth the \\\\\"YOLO\\\\\" flair.

        "selftext": "CONTEXT:\n\nWith the Fed keeping rates low for the foreseeable future, mortgage lenders are poised for further growth.\n\nQuicken Loans - a subsidiary of Rocket Mortgages (RKT) - was the first mortgage lender to go public and capitalize on the low mortgage rate environment. Following suite, United Wholesale Mortgage is going public via SPAC in a merge with G-H-I-V. \n\nWHAT IS IT?:\n\nOnly the largest SPAC deal EVER at a value of $16.1 Billion.\n\nUnited Wholesale Mortgage (UWM) is the largest wholesale mortgage lender in the US and the second largest mortgage lender next to RKT. \n\nSHOULD I BUY IT?:\n\nIn the most recent Quarter (Q3), UWM raked in $1.45B net income. They had 81% year-over-year increase in loan volume, at $54.2B. Per CEO Mat Ishbia on Q3: \"This is our best quarter in the company\u2019s 34 years, showing that borrowers are recognizing that independent mortgage brokers offer better rates, greater speed and deeper experience.\"\n\nG-H-I-V currently has over 50% institutional ownership, meaning the big fish are interested. With REITs failing, independent mortgage lending companies have become a new way of capitalizing on the real estate market. More of these companies will be going public in the months to come.\n\nUWM is the first one to IPO via SPAC. RKT priced their IPO at $18 back in August, and they have a much larger market cap.\n\nRKT Market Cap:  41B (2B shares).\n\nG-H-I-V Market Cap: 677M (53M shares).\n\nRKT may have larger market share, but as the second largest contender and due to the vast scale comparison in market cap, I think it's fair to say that G-H-I-V should at least be trading at a higher price than RKT. One of the biggest things keeping RKTs share price down is its bigness. With large institutional ownership parking money like they would in REITs, it makes it difficult for retail investors to move the stock price. With a market cap magnitudes smaller, G-H-I-V has the potential to moon the way RKT has failed to.\n\nWHEN?:\n\nThe Special Meeting for approval is happening January 20th at 6am PST. The new ticker will be UWMC. At the current price of $13/share, I believe the upside potential far outweighs the downside. I'm placing my conservative low end PT at $20, but I see G-H-I-V flying much higher than RKT.\n\nTLDR: \n\nBuy G-H-I-V for the same reason you bought RKT. G-H-I-V will moon the way you hoped RKT would. Buy before the January 20th meeting for max tendies.",

        "selftext": "**OVERVIEW**\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/SPACs/comments/ixjhuz/are_we_in_a_spac_bubble/g67cgse/\n\nThere are at least four ways to play SPACs, each corresponding to a SPAC's lifecycle.\n\nThe first play is arbitrage.  This comes and goes, depending on the stock price of a SPAC unit.\n\nThe second play is NAV, which u/bobbyneedslawadvice has posted about.  Again, this comes and goes.  One risk here is that rising bond yields could lower the NAVs of SPACs without targets.\n\nThe third play is the deadline calendar.  If we see an excess of SPACs, we could see more and more bad deals.  The \"SPAC bubble\" is mainly in play here.\n\nThe fourth and final play applies only to select SPACs.\n\n**BLOCKBUSTER EVENTS**\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/spacstreetbets/comments/jf5jy6/a_way_around_spac_saturation_event_spacs/gcgxany/\n\nThere are lots of SPACs around these days. There are legitimate concerns about saturation.\n\nAll reverse mergers / special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs) are not created equal.  Most don't have hype.\n\nEven among those that have hype, there are the regular ones, and then there are SPACs that present more clearly the way around SPAC saturation.\n\nThese latter SPACs are the event SPACs, or blockbuster SPACs.\n\nWelcome to the *real* money-making opportunity in SPAC Land!  These blockbuster events are characterized by most of these price movements, some more fundamental than others.\n\n**LETTER-OF-INTENT (LOI) POP**\n\nA letter of intent announcement is the lesser of two early announcements.\n\nHype-based price movement in reaction to this, Price Movement #1, is not necessary for a blockbuster event to unfold.  Also, even if this were to happen, a SPAC can be like SPAQ and not become a money-making blockbuster event.\n\n**DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT (DA) AND THE SPIKE**\n\nCertain hype SPACs can spike to at least $20.  Should they do so, they could become money-making blockbuster events.  Without spikes this high, this Price Movement #2, they will end up like regular hype SPACs such as LCA and OPES.\n\nSHLL / HYLN still holds the record for the highest spike.\n\n**ALTERNATIVE: BELATED UPWARD MOMENTUM**\n\nIf certain hype SPACs don't \"spike\" hard immediately, they can still have steady upward momentum that breaks $15 and stays there for the six weeks following their DA announcements.  While this alternative price movement, Price Movement #3, is mutually exclusive to Price Movement #2, it could indicate a blockbuster event in the making.\n\nDPHC / RIDE is the first blockbuster SPAC to have had this belated momentum.\n\n**LONG BLEED**\n\nReece Haslam posted a video on YouTube titled [The Best SPAC Investing Strategy! - Applies To All Highly Anticipated SPACs!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE55BzRqg-U&amp;feature=youtu.be)\n\nThose who miss Price Movement #2 should not FOMO into a SPAC, hoping it will keep going.  The next price movement, Price Movement #4, is the long bleed downward.\n\n**DOUBLE YOUR MONEY OR MORE: \"IPO POP\" OR PRE-MERGER RAMP-UP**\n\nThe fourth way to play SPACs presents this realistic opportunity: **Double your money or more in as little as two weeks!**\n\nWhat is this opportunity?\n\nWhy, it's none other than the pre-merger ramp-up to $30, $40, or more.  As the Washington Post commented on SHLL before HYLN, \"[this is the SPAC equivalent of the first-day IPO 'pop' that critics dislike](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/a-28-year-oldbillionaire-wins-the-spaclottery/2020/09/28/f64b0b58-017b-11eb-b92e-029676f9ebec_story.html).\"\n\nThis doubling or more of our money in as little as two weeks, this \"IPO pop,\" is the key differentiator between blockbuster SPACs, on the one hand, and regular hype SPACs, second-tier SPACs, and garbage SPACs, on the other.  This is the key differentiator between an excellent-to-near perfect SPAC management team and a lower-quality one!\n\nHow can this opportunity be made possible?\n\nPrice Movement #2 or Price Movement #3 has been a prerequisite for every blockbuster SPAC's pre-merger ramp-up, or Price Movement #5, since SHLL / HYLN.  VTIQ / NKLA has been the sole exception so far.\n\nWhich SPACs have been official blockbuster events to date?\n\nVTIQ / NKLA, SHLL / HYLN, GRAF / VLDR, DPHC / RIDE, and SBE (ChargePoint) have been the official blockbuster events to date.\n\nWhat are the risks?\n\nThe \"SPAC bubble\" is not in play here for blockbuster SPACs, but broader market bubbles are.  The relevant bubble is the \"future tech\" bubble inclusive of sustainability, within which EV belongs, and digitization.  2023 is the earliest that the Fed could raise the overnight lending rate.  This could adversely affect such bubbles, most notably the \"future tech\" one.\n\nAs for risks specific to definitive agreements, all its takes is a merger breakdown to collapse the pre-merger ramp-up of a blockbuster SPAC to collapse, which would then scare away retail players with the most money.  [The SPAC community actually caught a glimpse of this in none other than SHLL!](https://www.reddit.com/r/SPACs/comments/j1dilj/explanation_why_proposal_3_didnt_pass_for_shll/)\n\n**EXCEPTIONAL PRICE MOVEMENT: IMMEDIATE POST-MERGER PUMP AND DUMP**\n\nThere can be one more upward price movement following the pre-merger ramp-up.  After the merger and ticker change, there is the possibility of an immediate post-merger pump and dump.  VTIQ / NKLA is the blockbuster SPAC noted for this special price movement.\n\n**THEN COMES THE DROP**\n\nEven with an immediate post-merger pump, the drop must come.  [As Jim Cramer noted on Mad Money about SHLL / HYLN, \"then they pull back hard.\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ha9WoUEE3c)\n\nThis part is self-explanatory, and there are multiple reasons for this.\n\nAnyways, lots of money can be made in event SPACs / blockbuster SPACs, both long and short.",

        "selftext": "So real old heads remember everyone's favorite meme stock from 2017. This bad boy was pulling in money left and right and was trading at a sexy P/E of under 14$. Micron Technologies was trading under 10 bucks before our man main entered the picture, Swag Master Sanjay Mehrotra in 2017 and ever since Micron Technologies has boomed to a beautiful 72$. So what is Micron technologies, and why is it going to make you rich:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**What is Micron Technology?**\n\nThey're a company that specializes in producing NAND flash Semiconductors. Think the type of semi conductors used in your USBs, memory cards, cell phones and other small devices that lack the sizes for larger forms of dedicated storage. \n\n**What has been happening during the Rona**?:\n\nMicron crashed in February in anticipation of a decline of the global NAND market due to Corona's effects on the supply chain. However this disrupted China's ability to flood the market with semi-conductors and as a result allowed Micron to gobble up a huge amount of the market share. Another [WSBs DD post put it better than I could](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f7emhl/micron_technology_mu_dd/). Go read his post as well to get a better idea of what''s been happening over the last few months with Micron:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;The memory trough has finally bottomed. Micron did not lose money. How do I know it has bottomed? Earnings from other tech companies. They have been investing in data centers because the new hot technology is AI. Artificial intelligence require massive CPU, memory, and storage. Magnetic disk is so 1980\u2019s, it\u2019s all about NAND today. Who makes the hottest NAND? Intel and Micron collaborated on 3D XPoint (think Intel Optane). It\u2019s 1000x faster than NAND, last 1000X longer, and 10X as dense. It\u2019s basically not volatile DRAM, something to power the AI revolution.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Oh yeah, Micron just bought out Intel\u2019s share of 3DXPoint for 1.5B. The only manufacturing for 3DXPoint is in\u2026 Utah. That\u2019s right, not in China! So now I segue into the Mexican Beer virus. The majority of memory manufacturers are centered in the Wuhan area. The Wuhan area is basically shut down for the foreseeable future. Hmmm\u2026 which memory maker makes memory mostly outside China? If you said Micron, you win the prize. They have manufacturing locations in Idaho (you da hoe), Utah, Virginia, Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan, and Xian China. They have only one location in China, and it\u2019s not even in Wuhan.\n\nNot only did Micron use Corona as an opportunity to expand its market share, [but the dip in NAND memory demand was temporary and it returned to its upward trend](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/nand-flash-market-is-rebounding-faster-than-the-dram-market). Not only did demand increase; but the supply retracted as manufacturers in China and other Corona hit areas suspended operations as seen by this chart (you might have to click on it to see it closer)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Notice that oversupply is steadily declining](https://preview.redd.it/v8814125il361.png?width=328&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=820a650b6d82e238d8d9ffa53030961d59deeb68)\n\n**Diversification and Innovation**:\n\n[Here's an interview with the Swag Master himself:](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLl3b7SMUBk) \n\nThey've been able to make big bucks diversifying into data centers which have boomed with work from home and they've been making money on the online schooling trend. The demand for enterprise PCs has gone up. More or less every product that Micron Technology sells has boomed as a result of corona virus and they were able to achieve an Earnings Per Share growth of +77.55% since last year. They also will likely be used for the AI for self-driving cars so that's going to be exciting. We might even see a huge boom from them in the mid term once they start making deals with large EV manufactures. \n\nNot only have they seen growth in these new product lines but they've also come up with a new chip that should put them ahead of the competition for at [least a few years](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/11/11/micron-technology-just-announced-an-important-tech/):\n\n&gt;*176-layer NAND flash:*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;In the press release, Micron announced that it had begun volume shipments of the world's first 176-layer NAND flash chips. For those unfamiliar with NAND flash technology, it's becoming the nonvolatile storage medium of choice for many applications.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Nonvolatile storage retains information even when power is turned off. Legacy hard disk technology still has a place in cheap bulk storage in cloud data centers. Yet cost reductions have made NAND closer to hard disk drives in terms of cost-per-bit, and with much better performance and resilience, less space, and better total cost of ownership in many cases. NAND flash is found in data center servers, smartphones, game consoles, and laptops these days.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;With the data revolution taking off, NAND flash demand is supposed to compound at a 30% annual growth rate. Yet many NAND manufacturers have had a hard time making profits in recent years despite that insatiable end demand. Companies have begun stacking NAND modules on top of each other in a 3D vertical structure, with each layer significantly boosting storage capacity. While demand for bits has gone up, the NAND flash producers have oversupplied the market, crashing NAND prices along with profits.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;However, Micron's innovation could give it a significant leg up on rivals next year.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Why Micron Technology will grow after Covid**:\n\nThe big thing to realize is that Micron technologies has [some of the best chips in the market for handling the type of processing power that cell phones need](https://www.micron.com/insight/5g-ai-and-the-coming-mobile-revolution) for [5G and AI](https://www.micron.com/insight/5g-ai-and-the-coming-mobile-revolution). These guys are going to be miles ahead when 5G becomes the norm and the other companies will be trying to catch up for years. Don't take my word for it, trust everyone's favorite holocaust profiteers and Jeffery epstein's favorite bank, Deusche bank, who recently upgraded their outlook on them:\n\n&gt; In a research report, Ho said that Micron is expected to be a solid recovery pick as the economy starts recovering from the global pandemic. Demand drivers such as data centers, 5G smartphones, and gaming will accelerate the growth of Micron. Ho also pointed out that Micron is well-positioned for CY21 (calendar year 2021).   \n&gt;  \n&gt;Micron Technology is known as being a leading supplier and manufacturer of memory and storage used in a wide range of electronic devices ranging from PCs to smartphones. And the company is currently number three in market share for memory/storage shipments after Samsung and SK Hynix. DRAM currently makes up about two-thirds of the company\u2019s total revenue with NAND making up most of the rest of the revenue.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;DRAM is known for providing high-speed data storage and retrieval. And NAND flash products are electrically rewritable and nonvolatile memory that retains data when power is turned off. This makes NAND ideal for mass-storage uses \u2014 specifically for solid-state drives, which have started to displace traditional hard disk drives.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;DRAM and NAND are both promising for the future as SSDs are expected to be used in the majority of PCs and data centers as well as higher memory and storage content in smartphones. And AI and autonomous vehicles will also require substantial DRAM and NAND capacities.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Deutsche Bank is not the only brokerage to increase its price target on Micron. Mizuho analyst Vijay Rakesh recently increased the price target from $56 to $70. And Morningstar equity analyst Abhinav Davuluri, CFA recently increased the target price to $50 per share from $48. And in an analyst rating consensus of Micron stock with 33 ratings, 76% say buy, 21% say hold, and 3% say sell.\n\nThey aren't the only institution that's upgrading their outlook. It'd take too long to go over all of the upgrades so I'm just going to link them:\n\n[Goldman Sachs upgrades Micron Technologies](https://www.thestreet.com/streetlightning/stock-picks/mircon-computer-memory-dram-nand-technology-mu-semiconductor-goldman-sachs-buy)\n\n[Argus Research upgrades Micron Technologies](https://snapshot.fidelity.com/fidresearch/snapshot/landing.jhtml#/news?symbol=MU&amp;pageno=&amp;storyid=202012041056MIDNIGHTUSEQUITY_A2316094&amp;provider=MIDNIGHT&amp;product=USEQUITY&amp;sb=1&amp;sc=1&amp;san=1)\n\n[Morgan Stanley upgrades Micron Technologies](https://thefly.com/landingPageNews.php?id=3205255&amp;headline=MU-Micron-price-target-raised-to--from--at-Morgan-Stanley)\n\n[UBS Upgrades Micron Technologies](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/micron-shares-jump-after-ubs-boosts-rating-price-target)\n\n[Wells Fargo upgrades Micron Technologies](https://thefly.com/landingPageNews.php?id=3204494&amp;headline=MU-Micron-price-target-raised-to--from--at-Wells-Fargo)\n\nTheres probably more that I'm missing but you dont need me to post every [wordpress.com](https://wordpress.com)/Seeking Alpha/Motley Small Bus Rider word vomit from 2 bit prop traders and amatuer hedge fund larpers to prove my point. This bad boi is going up bigly.\n\n**The most important bit: How to trade**:\n\nYou guys can try making money with out of the money two week calls but I suspect that there are other ways to make money on this that might be more lucrative.\n\nFirst of all shares. Yes they are boring but keep in mind there's a really, really good chance that Micron gets the Vale treatment in the near future and spikes on rumors of being able to supply one of the big EVs with chips. I'm not going to tell you when this might happen because no one knows. But I feel it in my heart of hearts and half of the analysts upgrading it mention how Micron's new chip is going to have massive applications with self-driving automobile technology and if you watched some of the interviews with the Swag Master he always brings it up. Sure it might not be TSLA since they are in bed with TSM but keep in mind if they choose to keep that deal proprietary and TSM doesn't sell that chip to anyone else that means that basically there are no other chips for EV companies to choose from other than Micron.\n\nSecond what I'd really recommend are Leaps. Buy yourself some 2022 out of the money calls and you will print money in due time. There are just so many upside potentials with Micron that if even one of them ends up working out then these leaps will print.\n\nTLDR: Buy the 85$ January 2022 MU calls. You'll thank me later.",

I am a pure retard and not a financial advisor, take my analysis at your own risk.**\n\nInternational EV manufacturers have collectively shot to the moon this year. TSLA is likely overvalued, NIO performance has slowed. There are likely to be a range of discrepancies in supporting industries where securities are undervalued (e.g., steel, as recently popularised on this dumbass sub). Undoubtedly, these industries will grow to meet the needs of EV manufacturers as governments set ambitious targets to halt the production of FF vehicles.\n\nRef 1: [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-54981425](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-54981425)\n\nRef 2: [https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Is-Elon-Musk-Wrong-About-Lithium.html](https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Is-Elon-Musk-Wrong-About-Lithium.html)\n\n**If you have not considered the lithium market yet, you should**. As global demand for lithium rises (for EV li-ion batteries) demand is set to rise dramatically, and current supply is insufficient. As such, there are likely to be a range of lithium mining/exploration start-ups that will do astonishingly well in months and years to come, despite the fact lithium as a commodity has fallen in price. Moreover, as lithium is now in a dip, it is an excellent time to buy into the industry.\n\nRef 3: [https://www.ft.com/content/b9395e8c-9321-4351-b98d-a664b1e99b03?sharetype=blocked](https://www.ft.com/content/b9395e8c-9321-4351-b98d-a664b1e99b03?sharetype=blocked)\n\nRef 4: [https://twitter.com/KodalMinerals/status/1334435246872399873/photo/2](https://twitter.com/KodalMinerals/status/1334435246872399873/photo/2)\n\nI draw your attention to Kodal Minerals (KOD: LSE), a British firm headed by Aussie Bernard Aylward, who comes to the firm with high repute. KOD is a mining &amp; exploration company currently developing a project in Bougouni, Mali, with a whopping 350km\u00b2 of potential mining operations, expecting to haul ***1.94 million tonnes*** of lithium over 8 years, with an ***estimated 1.4bn revenue***. The company is currently sat at a **hilarious market cap of \u00a39m, trading at p0.08/share.** The project is in large part funded by Suay Chin, an enormous player in the Chinese lithium market.\n\nSource 5: [https://kodalminerals.com/project/bougouni-lithium-project/overview-highlights/](https://kodalminerals.com/project/bougouni-lithium-project/overview-highlights/)\n\nSource 6: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdyMZvQzcDg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdyMZvQzcDg)\n\n **\ud83d\ude80**  **\ud83d\ude80** The current market valuation remains low as KOD awaits a mining permit from the Government of Mali, which is expected in a matter of weeks. I anticipate that as the permit is granted and project action begins, KOD will carry my autistic fucking nut to Pluto. They also hold gold mining permits in Mali and C\u00f4te d'Ivoire which will shore up the share price. Definitely worth a look at. **\ud83d\ude80**  **\ud83d\ude80** \n\nDisclosure: I am in 295k KOD shares at p0.08.",

        "selftext": "So here is some DD from myself. Myself being an admitted amateur, but knows how to read patterns and news when I see it. Tired of seeing the word PLTR? Well, in a short couple of months you may get tired of seeing VXRT.\n\n**What is VXRT?**\n\nVaxart, Inc., a clinical-stage biotechnology company, engages in the discovery and development of oral recombinant protein vaccines based on its proprietary oral vaccine platform. The company's product pipeline includes norovirus vaccine, an oral tablet vaccine, which has completed Phase I clinical trials with bivalent oral tablet vaccine for the GI.1 and GII.4 norovirus strains; seasonal influenza vaccine, which is in Phase II clinical trials for treatment of H1 influenza infection; respiratory syncytial virus vaccine; and coronavirus vaccine. It is also developing therapeutic immune-oncology vaccines for cervical cancer and dysplasia caused by human papillomavirus. The company has a research collaboration agreement with Janssen Vaccines &amp; Prevention B.V. (Janssen) to evaluate the company's proprietary oral vaccine platform for the Janssen universal influenza vaccine program. Vaxart, Inc. is headquartered in South San Francisco, California. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**YTD History**\n\nVXRT was a penny stock coming into the new year and quickly found its feet mid summer rocketing up to 15 per share, 5 dollar short of its 5 YR ATH in 2016. VXRT has been trading relatively sideways for the past couple of weeks and is teetering on being an interplanetary rocket that soars well past the moon. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**My Research and Thoughts**\n\nVXRT will be offering among many other vaccines, and ORAL COVID-19 vaccine. That's right, oral. Now, Why is this huge you might ask? Well for starters the current vaccines are sensitive to specific temperatures and makes transportation ,storage, and administration a large hurdle. With a pill form it can be distributed en mass, globally, in any regular package. This not only relieves staffing issue to administer a vaccine on such a grand scale, but also allows many people that have a huge fear of needles to take it in an oral form. \n\nThe company is getting ready to publish phase 1 trials and finding with word of this happening around December 10. They recently hired a team of 5 manufacturing experts and have quality control expert job openings, which to me signals a need for an all hands on deck operation for when the manufacturing officially starts soon. Vaxart will be the first company to actually bring out mucosal immunity. \n\nThere are grumblings of a **Bill Gates** connection with a new Stanford hire at VXRT. If you dig deep enough, things start to get pretty interesting. Pfizer also recently came out and said that they would have trouble with initial demand for the vaccine and might not have enough till summer of 2021, in turn allowing other major players to enter the market and crush. Joe Biden said it himself, \n\n ***\u201cCost of actually getting the serum into an injection needle into someone\u2019s arm costs a lot of money. It takes a lot of people. It takes a lot of folks to get this done. We have to have a much better way than what we have seen to get this distributed.\u201d*** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere is some nice DD from someone I have no affiliation with but backs up my thoughts: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuofzQ73An0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuofzQ73An0)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TLDR**\n\nThere is risk. But this risk will pay off. A pill form vaccine is going to take us to the moon. Once funding is secured my bets are on a moon past 30 by first quarter. \n\nPositions 4/16/21 20C",
