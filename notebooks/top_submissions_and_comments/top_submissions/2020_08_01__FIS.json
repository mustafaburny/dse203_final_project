        "selftext": "  \n\nI was introduced to options in 2005. \n\nA co-worker of mine, who happened to be a 9/11 Truther before that was a term, was all hyped up on the upcoming ER for Amgen. He went around the office on a manic high, telling everyone to buy short term OTM call options - or as we refer to them around these parts, FDs. \n\nAs part of our retirement plans, we each had Fidelity brokerage accounts. To enable options trading, however, you had to call Fidelity and answer questions about your level of financial smarts and how much money you had. The correct answers were, of course \"genius level\" and \"shitloads.\" I answered truthfully. My other coworkers did not. They got to options trading enabled. I did not.\n\nAmgen beat and some of these guys landed 8 baggers. My own officemate made $50k and promptly took his family to Disneyland. As you can imagine, I was dismayed that I missed out.\n\nFor the next few months, chasing the next big trade was all the rage, and our team could hardly get anything done. I got my account upgraded by answering the questions correctly, but every play the group made after Amgen was a loser. Because I never had that thrill of victory, I quickly lost interest, but the temptation to recapture those initial gains captivated some of the other guys. As the losses racked up, the trading group got smaller and smaller, eventually distilling down to the most degenerate off talking in the corner, the crazy Truther mumbling his false prophesies to his last few disciples. I lost about $1000 \u2013 which was no small change at that time in my life \u2013 but I know that some of the guys lost a lot more chasing that high.\n\nThat\u2019s still better than the snake oil the retail investment crowd is selling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor any market at any given time, Boggleheads and r/investing will tell you to just keep putting money in, no matter how badly you are getting fucked.\n\n*\u201c7% YoY in the market!\u201d* \n\n*\u201cThe greatest force in the universe is compound interest!\u201d*\n\n*\u201cIf you hold for the long term, you don\u2019t have to worry about volatility!\u201d*\n\nHere\u2019s the cold truth: the life advice Boomers give out is fucking outdated, designed for an analog world created by a Greatest Generation that coddled them, and that includes their financial advice as well.\n\nI am from the \u201c[Oregon Trail Generation](https://socialmediaweek.org/blog/2015/04/oregon-trail-generation/)\u201d, the last slice of GenX that actually grew up with computers. We are the cohort that witnessed the death of the American Middle Class that the Internet Age and Globalization, entering the workforce just as the dot-com bubble finally put it out of its misery.\n\nWhen I was 3, my grandfather retired from Boeing after 35 years. They gave him a platinum plated set of draftsman\u2019s tools, a brass desk clock and a lifelong pension.\n\nWhen I was 19, my girlfriend\u2019s dad was a consultant for Boeing. His job was to dig up dirt on upcoming retirees so they could be fired to deprive them of that pension.\n\nI did the *thing,* that good old American Dream \u2013 marriage, house, car, kids. I did what the \u201cexperts\u201d tell you to do: save a slice of each paycheck for retirement, invest in a college plan, buy a house as a solid investment. \n\nHere I am barely middle-aged, and I have worked through three major financial crises since I entered the workforce.\n\nI\u2019ve chased a runaway housing market, lowering my parameters every month because the prices kept rising faster than I could make for a down payment.\n\nTwice, I have had my retirement account fleeced, then had to draw down what was left to keep a roof over my head - paying a penalty to do so. \n\nI have been so upside down on a mortgage I\u2019ve considered burning the house down.\n\nSo I am here to tell you firsthand that *Save, Buy, Hold and Diversify* will not help you when the whole market collapses and you find yourself in need of that money, that a house is just an investment that you can live in while it drops in value, and that *Dollar Cost Averaging* is another way of saying *Getting Cucked.*\n\nI say, if you are going to make or lose 50% in the next 10 years, you may as well make or lose that 50% in the next 10 *hours.* \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn some ways, younger Millennials and Zoomers are better equipped to face these facts than us older folks. If you came of age during the GFC or later, you understand that the game is rigged. All that bailout money is moving around the market while you are struggling to make minimum wage in the Uber Eats gig economy. Unlike those of us who grew up in more stable times, you know in your bones the halcyon days - the ones you've only ever heard about - about are never coming back. \n\nNot for everybody, at any rate.\n\nSo enters RobinHood, and it drives the financial pundits absolutely berserk. Who are these fucking kids YOLOing on HTZ? Don\u2019t they know they are supposed to be investing that money into a passive index fund, or even better, one of those retirement-date funds with the massive expense ratios? It\u2019s fucking up the game for the rest of us! \n\nI have traded options on and off for years in the hopes of making a little pocket money. Fact is, when commissions were $8-$20 per trade (plus a fee per contract), there was no way a small-time retail investor could participate meaningfully. With free or no commissions, the calculus has changed, lowering the bar of entry for smaller investors who can enter and exit a position at any time with only the bid-ask spread the main concern.\n\nBoomers created a monster, and they have only themselves to blame.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLike many of you, when March hit, I jumped in to puts and lost a bunch of money. This is because I was using an old way of thinking about options, the only one available to small-time retail traders just a few years ago: \u201cI hope that this security makes a huge break in a particular direction.\u201d \n\nAfter this loss and subsequent reflection, I determined that the money was there to be had, just that I was taking the wrong approach. I developed a new strategy, one that takes advantage of the simple fact that I can enter and exit a position without significant commission costs. I began to diversify my targets, and enter smaller positions on those targets, so that I didn\u2019t have everything riding on one or two plays. I developed exit strategies - and followed them! \u2013 so that I could take my wins or cut my losses quickly and move on to the next trade. \n\nAnd most importantly, I made it a point to withdraw my gains, if any, at the end of every week.\n\nSince April, I have executed no less than 20 trades per week if you count option expiry. In 15 weeks, I have doubled my account value. Not because of some one-off spectacular play or because I\u2019ve been a bull a bull market. In fact, I\u2019m a bear, but using a pretty neutral strategy. I doubled my money because I adapted to this new trading climate, found what works for me, and simply stuck to it.\n\nDo I think that makes me some some sort of fucking genius? Absolutely not. I\u2019ve made some smart, conservative plays that turned really goddamned sour. I\u2019ve made some truly retarded plays that turned out great. I\u2019ve had good weeks, bad weeks, and weeks that amounted to an incredibly stressful waste of time. I still make a bunch of mistakes - weekly, if not daily. \n\nI am still prepared \u2013 waiting, even \u2013 for my whole account to get wiped out due to a cacophony of bad plays. In the end, these are all gut decisions. Do I feel good about this? For each of them, only time reveals if I am right.\n\nBut if I have taken one thing away from what I have learned so far this year, it is this: *anybody can make rent money in the equities market now*. You do not have to have a massive account to overcome the burden of commissions, or have a huge investment in dividend stocks to realize a gains-based income. And thank God for that, because the job market is not going to save you.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know the gain porn here is enough to make a man drool, and the loss porn is enough to make his balls retract into his stomach. Just understand those are always one-sided directional plays. It\u2019s all-in on a single ticker, a true YOLO, not unlike putting it on black at the roulette table. It\u2019s easy to get caught up looking at the massive gains and get stars in your eyes.\n\nBut forget the lambo and the gold-plated yacht for a moment and consider something more immediate, such as: \u201ccould I pay this month\u2019s phone bill with my gains?\u201d With the money you can pare off into a brokerage account, is it possible to avoid spending the the money you make doing whatever it is you do for someone else and make your phone service \u201cfree\u201d?\n\nFor example, if you have $1000 and you make a reasonably conservative play with an exit strategy of $100 gain and $100 loss (such as a deep OTM 45DTE bull credit spread on a decent stock that\u2019s been beaten up recently, with a hard exit 21DTE), the likelihood is very high. It is not guaranteed \u2013 you may end up down $100 from where you started. But what *is* guaranteed is that you will have to spend 8 hours flipping burgers or whatever at $12.50 an hour to make that $100 if you don't. (Yes, I know, *taxes \u2013* the point still stands).\n\nWhen you finally get to take that $100 out and pay the phone bill with it, it becomes very, very real. \n\nImagine getting to a point where your trading gains pay for the things you *need*, so you can spend the money you earn with your blood sweat and tears on the things you *want.*\n\nThis is what it means to have a \u201cS.M.A.R.T.\u201d goal \u2013 small, measurable, achievable, realistic and time-sensitive. When you conform your efforts to translate into something small yet meaningful to your life, it changes the perspective.\n\nBut even if you decide to take your bi-weekly retirement contribution and YOLO it on MU FDs, you\u2019ve got just as much of a chance of coming ahead with that as you do giving it to Mr. Market to hold for the next 20 years.\n\nBoomers will tell you \u201cmost day traders lose money!\u201d First, \u201cday trader\u201d is a specific term. But that aside, it is also true most businesses fail in the first year. In both cases, people get burned, give up and go back to what they know. They fail to plan, they fail to learn from experience, and they fail to persevere. \n\nThis is not an appeal to \u201cnot be average\u201d nor to keep \u201cchasing bad money with good\u201d - just to keep trying. Set your goals, manage your risk, hone your successes, and learn from your failures.\n\nAt no other time in history has it been possible for the average Joe to participate in the equities market with so little friction as commission-free mobile trading, and with so much leverage as weekly options. I know, because I\u2019m old enough to remember when stock quotes were in the weekly paper, and they were registered in one-eighths of a dollar.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TL,DR; T**o Hell with the haters like Cramer and his ilk. Keep learning and growing and trying to rake in tendies. The lambo isn\u2019t the goal - *financial freedom* is. An Ally savings account and a shit job the boss is trying his damnedest to offshore ain\u2019t gonna get you there. We live in a Merchant Republic awash in wealth, and you have the right \u2013 the obligation, even - to participate. Go get your fucking slice.\n\nI love you retards.",

        "selftext": "I am quite surprised to see there hasn't been anything written about R.R. Donnelley &amp; Sons Company (NYSE: RRD).\n\nDespite being a very large company with massive revenue, they are extremely nimble and have handled the pandemic beyond my wildest expectations. They trade like a penny stock, with an extremely low market cap despite having billions in sales. \n\nBut what makes RRD even more special, is that it has a good bit of drama behind the recent share price cycling. This is not insider info or anything like that, and no I do not work for RRD.\n\nYou can look all this up of course, as it is all public info. Mid/late last year, there was an investment firm who apparently does hostile takeovers, Chatham Asset Management. For an example of what they do, look up McClatchy or read this NYT article:\n\n[https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/media/hedge-fund-chatham-mcclatchy-postmedia-newspapers.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/media/hedge-fund-chatham-mcclatchy-postmedia-newspapers.html) \n\nThey bought up 12.9% of RRD and it raised their board's eyebrows, and they passed a shareholder protection plan, which basically stated nobody can own more than 10% of RRD, else you have to liquidate your position down below 10%. That seemingly upset Chatham, because they called it a \"poison pill\" but in reality RRD was protecting itself. You can read RRD\u2019s response to Chatham here:\n\n[https://investor.rrd.com/news-releases/rrd-sends-letter-response-chatham-asset-management](https://investor.rrd.com/news-releases/rrd-sends-letter-response-chatham-asset-management) \n\nSince then, Chatham seems to have bad blood and was holding the stock down, as they tried to liquidate their position. They bought in at an average roughly $2 per share, and they owned 9,141,657 at climax. They sold off approximately 4 million shares as of June 1st's filing, and now own a maximum of 7.5%. It is widely speculated that the reason it kept capping out at $2 is because Chatham was trying to sell out and break even. By all accounts, this is a $3-4 stock all day long. \n\nNumerous other firms/banks are buying up shares. Geode (fidelity) has [$1M](https://stocktwits.com/symbol/1M) stake, Acadian 1.95M, State Street 2.26M, Saba 4.5M, Whitebox 2.3M, Brigade 1.74M, etc. and they've been increasing their positions for a steep discount since Chatham apparently kept selling it back to the ground. However, it is also widely speculated that Chatham\u2019s position has now been mostly, if not entirely liquidated. A run back up to $2 may be the last time RRD is in the $1 range, as there would be no further selloff. \n\nFinancially, RRD looks very sound. With their most recent ER on July 28th, they beat EPS by $0.07 and beat revenue by $14.90 million. Historically RRD has also paid a dividend, and if/when the covid19 situation turns around, it is expected the dividend would be restored as well. \n\nThey were the company responsible for printing the 2020 Census materials:\n\n[https://www.piworld.com/article/rr-donnelley-awarded-114m-contract-for-2020-census-production/](https://www.piworld.com/article/rr-donnelley-awarded-114m-contract-for-2020-census-production/)\n\nIt is entirely possible RRD will be printing mail-in ballots for the 2020 Presidential Election as well. In their Q1 2020 results filing, they stated:\n\n\u201c\\[RRD\\] is also receiving pandemic-related orders in many parts of its business, including special notification letters, government mailings, product packaging, labels, signage, mail-in ballots, test kit assembly, emergency kits, digital creative and COVID-19 specific consumer research and analytics.\u201d\n\nSource: [https://investor.rrd.com/news/news-details/2020/RRD-Reports-First-Quarter-2020-Results/default.aspx](https://investor.rrd.com/news/news-details/2020/RRD-Reports-First-Quarter-2020-Results/default.aspx)\n\nAdditionally, read what one of the Analysts asked on the July 29th ER call, and see how RRD's CEO responded:\n\n**Charlie Strauzer** \\-- *CJS Securities -- Analyst*\n\n\"\\[...\\] there's a lot of talk about this election year about mail-in ballots and other things where you potentially -- that could benefit you in terms of extra print work related to that? Are you starting to see some of that, you know, at the early stages here yet? Or do you think that will pick up more on Q4?\"\n\n**Dan Knotts** \\-- *President and Chief Executive Officer*\n\n\"Yeah. Charlie, it's Dan. The -- the election revenue -- that, you know, election season and the revenue that comes along with that. And we do expect to be a participant in that again this year and utilizing our commercial -- primarily our commercial print platform to support -- uh, to support those efforts.\n\nWe're seeing some of it flow through now. We expect to see more flow through in Q3. Relative to the mail-in ballot piece, we've connected with every state. And you know, given our work, leveraging our work on the Census and our performance on the Census, we're staying very close to that each of those individual states as they -- as they make those decisions.\"\n\nSource:  [https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/07/29/rr-donnelley-sons-rrd-q2-2020-earnings-call-transc.aspx](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/07/29/rr-donnelley-sons-rrd-q2-2020-earnings-call-transc.aspx) \n\n\\--\n\nFinally, in regards to competitor\u2019s stocks, RRD is extremely undervalued in every way. Their most direct competitor is Quad which has fewer sales yet trades at a higher p/s and p/c. See this chart of companies in the same/similar niche. \n\n[Why RRD? Growth, Undervalued, Gov't Deals &amp; Institutional Ownership.](https://preview.redd.it/ssrjeylqgaf51.png?width=492&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1ae178e6ec05d5a16ef516ab1216ad6272a2f54c)\n\nI believe, for all of these reasons, that RRD has been overlooked and brushed aside by most retail investors. It doesn't pop up on RobinHood's radar, it doesn't have a massive following online, yet they frequently release Press Releases with positive news and beat expectations. \n\nI am currently long on RRD, but wanted to share my research and findings with others since nobody seems to be talking about RRD.",

        "selftext": "I have 2 really important question and it's immensely appreciated whoever knows what this is about, here goes:\n\nI'm not allowed to post on this subreddit but, I logged into my Fidelity account today and Margin columns appeared. I've got a small account of 300 dollars and applied for margin and options a few weeks back and was messaged I was denied. I then resubmitted an application over a week ago and today randomly saw margin columns everywhere. I never received messages or any notification from Fidelity. Why is this? Is my account a Margin account now or is it still a cash account? Is this normal?\n\nNow begs question 2: Since I was on my cash account, I received a violation recently. I believe it was a free ride or GVF but not sure.\n\nSo looking at this now, I day traded a stock I bought yesterday with all my settled funds. I then bought new stocks today with the proceeds I got from the sell(I believe the cash from the day trade never settled). I know I can't sell because I did not used \"settled funds\" but rather \"cash available to trade\". But does this not matter anymore since margin columns appeared on my account, can I trade it now without it being settled funds?? What does this mean?\n\nMargin columns appeared on my UI, does this mean the cash account is gone? What's going on with this?? Thank you in advance, it's appreciated.",

        "selftext": "I wrote an `R` function to analyze a table of lots that make up a stock position for a single company (specifically, a single ticker). In addition to the normal stuff, it also provides adjustments for dividend reinvestments (and the relevant taxes on those dividends), as well as tax implications for selling. Short and long holding periods are considered automatically.\n\nThe function takes the following  arguments\n\n**data** \\- a data.frame with named columns *PurchaseDate*, *Quantity*, *CostPerShare*, *DivReInvest*, and *CapGainsRate*. Entries in the *DivReInvest* column take a value of 1 if the purchase was a dividend reinvestment, and 0 if it was not a dividend reinvestment. The CapGainsRate value will typically be the capital gains tax rate applicable *for the year of purchase*. In the event that a lot was purchased so recently income tax rates apply, use your marginal income tax rate for the specified value.\n\n**cgr** \\- Your capital gains tax rate for date specified with *date* argument.\n\n**itr** \\- Your current marginal income tax rate\n\n**price** \\- the market share price for the date specified with  *date* argument. Defaults to current date.\n\nThe output of the function is a list with two elements. The first element is an enhanced version of the data.frame passed as *data*. As before, each row represents one lot. The second element is a summary of the entire position with some useful information that can be tedious to calculate manually.\n\nFirst, I've built the table with the basic lot data below for a hypothetical investment in AAPL. In practice, all of the columns but Ticker, DivReInvest, and CapGainsRate are copied from from the individual lots view of my Fidelity account (as accessed via Safari on MacOS), into a Numbers spreadsheet.

        "selftext": "I ended up with a wash sale that I wasn\u2019t planning on. I bought some shares of CMG. Then on 2 different days within the week I bought some more as it dropped down some to bring down my cost basis per share. About a week later I sold all shares for a small profit over my new cost basis. The price I sold at was above most of my shares, but was below some of the first ones I bought. The loss on those first shares show up on Fidelity as a wash sale so I can\u2019t count those losses against my gains for tax purposes. I thought that to create a wash sale I would have had to buy CMG again within 30 days after I sold. But I never bought CMG again after I sold all my shares so why did I end up with a wash sale on those first shares?",

I actively contribute to all of them. I max out my Roth IRA and contribute to my employer match for my 401k at the bare minimum. Rest of the money goes into the taxable account. \n\nMy current brokerage account is all stocks. The usuals(AAPL, DIS, BABA, etc). My Roth IRA will mainly be mutual funds(FZROX, etc) and MSFT. I mistakenly added MSFT to my Roth IRA and since it\u2019s a long term hold anyway, I don\u2019t feel like selling and rebuying in my taxable account. I want to open a second brokerage account specifically for ETFs. Haven\u2019t decided the ETFs yet but looking at VOO or an equivalent, WCLD, maybe ARKK.\n\nMy question is, is this a good or bad idea? Is it too many accounts? Any other ETFs suggestions? Any other suggestions in general?\n\nThanks in advance",

        "selftext": "Some of you may know what this company is. Some of you may even use it's service, idk. For those who don't know, Sezzle is an ASX-listed US payment services company, that allows you to make a purchase online, and have it split into 4 interest free payments (1 at time of purchase and 3 more spaced 2 weeks apart each) to a debit or credit card. \nNow, I like their service. So much so, that I bought a small (10 share) position through my Fidelity international account, roughly a month ago. In that time, it has gone up about 75%.\nNow, if you do some google searching, you'll find plenty of \"experts\" that say it's a shit company, don't touch it. I say this is a winner, an underdog.\nWhy, do you ask? Simple. I use their services on a semi-regular basis, and I just used it for a purchase today. When I got the confirmation email, there was a link to a survey. Well, I took the survey. It was all about banking, specifically checking accounts. 10-15 questions or so, about features you look for in a checking account, how important those features are to you, etc. All the questions led to a culminating question;  Would you be interested in opening a checking account through Sezzle with features such as: no overdraft fees, no monthly account minimum fees, no late fees on Sezzle purchases, ability to easily send money to friends and family, debit card with no ATM fees, and 2-day early direct deposit?\nI have no option but to conclude that they're looking to become a rival of Chime and other recently popular online banking companies. Obviously this is conjecture, and you won't find this in their prospectus or any news articles, but I think it could be big.\n\nTLDR: ASX-listed Sezzle (SZL:AU) might be a real winner.\nAlso, for the retards out there, international trading means you pay a commission ^gasp.",

I know i need to diversify more and was planning on buying into some index funds over the next few weeks and months and adding more to my current positions. Would it be smart to add, let\u2019s say $2000 more dollars, over that time or would you guys add more since savings accounts are basically useless and the dollar is getting weaker.",

Now it just feels more like a hassle to manage with marginal benefit, and I've discovered the three-fund portfolio strategy. I want to simplify things and consolidate all my investments in either Schwab or Vanguard (I see that this sub recommends Vanguard).\n\nFor those who manage investments on multiple platforms, I'm curious as to your reasoning in maintaining funds on different platforms, especially if you do both funds and a roboadvisor.

        "selftext": "Hi,\n\nMy wife recently came into some money from her mom and it is all in a Fidelity account. While getting things changed over into her name, the people helping us suggested using their adviser services. We have done a couple of free meetings discussing goals and what we have and all the major assets. \n\nFrom this, he gave us a general plan and a cost estimate of .94% (+ fund expense ratios) to manage this for us. This would include re-balancing as needed, adjusting the asset ratios as plans change, and in general making adjustments to meet the general ups and downs of the market. The general plan looks like a bunch of mutual funds and a few things called SMA's (Separately Managed Account).\n\nMy question is: does that cost sound reasonable? does anyone have experience with Fidelity Management?\n\nI have been managing my 401k for years with no issues and i think I'm doing pretty good on that front. My wife is leaning toward giving them a chance and I'm unsure of the cost.",

        "selftext": "Hi, I am currently 21 and in college as the title says, and over the past two years I have maxed out my Roth IRA contributions in my account at Fidelity, which are being invested into FDKVX (Fidelity Freedom 2060 Fund) which is a target-date fund. I have just recently gotten into looking at this fund and others that I could possibly buy. Now I'm very new to this, but from what I can tell it seems that FDKVX follows the exact same trend as fidelity's total market/SP500 fund (FXAIX) except it consistently gets less of a percent return. So what I am wondering is, if either way, I am going to let my money sit for a very long time, why would I want to be invested in the target-date fund and not FXAIX which seems to perform better. I have also heard that FZROX is basically the same as FXAIX but with a 0% expense ratio, so why would anyone invest in FXAIX if that is the case. Any input would be appreciated, thanks!",

I make about 1400 a month, spending 850 for all living expenses (rent, groceries, utilities) leaving me with around 550 a month for everything else. I do end up spending most of this 550 (drinks with friends, maintaining my bike, shopping etc), or use what I save monthly (~100) for a yearly holiday and going home to see my family for Christmas. I have a few thousand saved from when I was working previously, and I have been trying to use this for investing. When I finish my PhD, I should hopefully see an increase in salary and will be able to invest more. \n\nI currently have 1000 invested via an ISA with 500 in HSBC FTSE 250 and 500 in Legal&amp;General UK index (both accumulation).\n\nI have an additional ~3000 GBP that I would like to invest but I\u2019m just kind of at a loss of what to do.\n\nI don\u2019t mind taking some risk (I guess medium risk?

When i told him about these he bought some shares of AMD and Intel, so i guess that was a good call? He also told me to invest in a food stock, so i'm thinking of General Mills (GIS)?

        "selftext": "This is the filing for the SEC. \n\nhttps://dd7pmep5szm19.cloudfront.net/2245/0001640334-20-001884.htm\n\nThey have delayed it until August 10.  I think this was strategic as Frank Martha, CEO wants to see how the sale of the XFL plays out. \n\nWe know the XFL was sold to The Rock for $15 million, but now that sale will probably not go through.  \n\nhttps://www.espn.com/xfl/story/_/id/29593665/the-xfl-rock-dany-garcia-15-million-know-league-sale-2021-season\n\nThe creditors in the bankruptcy are saying that is not enough and the purchase price should be significantly higher. \n\nhttps://brobible.com/sports/article/xfl-sale-dwayne-johnson-objection/\n\nUnlike this article says, this is not a small hiccup to the XFL starting in spring 2021. The Rock and Vince McMahon are very close and this sale makes it look like the league was given away at a cheap price to a close friend. \n\n$15 million sounds like a lot, but the Commissioner, Oliver Luck was scheduled to make no less than $20 million and over $30M if the league was to succeed.  \n\nhttps://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2018/06/11/report-oliver-luck-getting-20-million-guaranteed-from-the-xfl/\n\nIn comes the MLFB.  A season has been in the works for a few years now.  Frank has confirmed a 2021 season starting in April and ending July 1. \n\nThere will be a spring football league. Absolutely. The people want it and it will happen. \n\nAs recently as last month MLFB jumped from .002 to .02 a 10x with no news.  Leading up to the season before COVID the price was nearly .06 - 20x on current prices. If this league has a successful launch who knows where the price will end up.\n\nIt is OTC so it\u2019s not on Robinhood or Webull. \n\nE*TRADE you have to call in your order, 1-800-387-2331. \n\nYou can trade freely on Schwab, TD Ameritrade, and Fidelity.",

        "selftext": "Previously, I was just a long term investor but now I've recently gotten into day trading, and just this week I've switched from paper trading on TOS to day trading in my Fidelity IRA cash account. \n\nDue to my lack of due diligence, I ended up violating the good faith rule several times and my account is now restricted for 90 days. (I facepalmed and called myself an idiot after I read up on it. I was just so excited that I kept going next next next and ignored all the warnings on the app.)  \n\nAfter my 90-day restriction is up, I plan to apply for a limited margin account but I wanted some clarification first.\n\nBased on my understanding, limited margin IRA accounts will not have margin buying power but they will be allowed to trade with unsettled funds. Are there any rules or regulations I will have to be worried about violating as I continuously buy and sell within the same day beside the PDT rule? \n\nAlso, would it be better just to open a separate account to day trade in? I don't want to incur any margin interest fees and just want to trade using the funds I have available.\n\nThank you for your time and help!",
