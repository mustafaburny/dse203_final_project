        "selftext": "I don't know if anyone else noticed, but Friday was kind of a big one for GME. It **ripped face** from $43 up to $75 in the morning session. That was fucking wild, even for this autist's dream of a stock. \n\nOther's have already commented on why this has happened, but I'll summarize for this dunces in the back. In short, though, the market makers wrote a LOT of 0DTE OTM calls at open, and then had to buy shares to cover when those calls went ITM around noon. This is what caused the absurd spike from $50 to $75 in just an hour and a half. That's the **gamma squeeze** that everyone has been talking about, where MM's couldn't cover fast enough.\n\nThe rest is history, GME closed at $65, and every single call that expired yesterday was ITM. That's fucking retarded. \n\nWhat this means, though, is that the MM's/brokers are going to have to deliver a ridiculous amount of shares when these expired options settle. Typically, settlement is on a Tuesday. I've read estimates that 10-15M shares worth of calls expires ITM on Friday. Again, this is fucking retarded. \n\nPlease note that **none** of the above movement relates directly to the short squeeze... but it will. Because there are now 10-15M shares tied up in the clearing houses, there are now ever **fewer** shares to be borrowed. Some are tied up in passive funds that can't sell unless a rebalance is being done. Some are tied up in diamond hands. Now, though, about 20% of the total float is **committed to the fucking clearing house** as they sort out Friday's shitshow. \n\nDemand for GME will continue to pump on Monday. It's a cultural event now, where every lay person can be a modern-day Robin Hood. The shorts are going to have their positions closed whether they like it or not if this continues (which it will). Since there are far far far fewer shares floating over the next 2 trading days, though, a squeeze on Monday or Tuesday could utterly destroy Melvin and the other shorts. \n\nIf RC even opens his twitter app this weekend, it's over. \n\nPositions: [Take what's yours, gents.](https://imgur.com/a/7ipopDo)",

        "selftext": "# Ok retards listen up. Been seeing lots of cucks writing small DD pieces of bullish or bearish shit. You cucks need to read this cos this is the whole fucking thing.\n\nthis is also basically my magnum fucking opus so upvote retards. Dont give me awards, legit go buy a powerup membership for a year. Cant tell you to buy shares because we gonna get closed down by Suck Elons Cock somehow.\n\nim also not some fininacial advisor or whatever just read this and make your own conclusions degenerates.\n\nTLDR: GME DD sumarized, Margin doesnt affect longs the same way as shorts right now. Dont buy shares on margin though and get ready to supply collateral regardless. Short interest is up and some smart retards are on our side. Read the post to raise your IQ from 8 to 9 though. **\ud83d\udc3b \ud83c\udf08s  mega fuk and even posting high level bear shit to scare us.**\n\nCompulsory 7 rockets so you autists dont start having a seizure or something:\n\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nBasically been seeing posts about \"blah blah margin this, short interest this, WS to clever blah\". Going to split this post into distinct sections but im no english degree cuck so dont expect any bear bloomberg  level shit or something\n\n# 1. GME is a fucking steal regardless of squeeze. Buy now or be left on a dying planet while we head to alpha fucking centauri.\n\nSo basically everyone here knows about Ryan cohen and his horsemen of the apocalypse coming to steal melvins lunch money. This man bought apple stock in 2017. Hes fucking rich. Hes also an eccommerce wizard, taking CHEWY from a measly 100k co-founded company to a $4 Billion company in 2017 at which point he sold it to petsmart or something. Its now valued at $40 Billion, granted anything eccommerce now gets money thrown at it like a stripper in a high flying strip club or some shit idk im a virgin so dont listen to me, so it may well be a bubble. Regardless the thing grows its revenue like bacteria doing mitosis on agar jelly \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80.\n\nTHEY SELL FUCKING PET FOOD. the market for that is like what? $1?. Gaming is going to the moon and is basically recession proof because of how cheap game is compared to other things for how much you get out of it. Any bears saying that Gamestop cant compete with digital or with amazon. Ryan cohen already slapped amazons head in with a no name brand. Hell fucking do it again. About digital everyone here already knows, microsoft deal, Ryan cohen also mentioned the possibility of having \"Digital game exchanging\" or something, image below.\n\n*Processing img 2ba9j5d2zvb61...*\n\nHe also mentions streaming, digital content etc and aside from all the digital stuff wants GME to move to a community centric structure where big stores operate with VR centres, Internet cafe, table games like Dungeons and dragons and  40k (rapidly growing somehow will boom post covid) and as we now might know due to this post:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kypuyb/gme\\_dd\\_buildapc\\_kiosks\\_coming/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kypuyb/gme_dd_buildapc_kiosks_coming/)\n\nBUILD YOUR OWN PC KIOSKS. This is the literal smell of money. Go to your Gamestop to build your PC with your kid? Gamestop is already the goto place wher your parents go to get you your latest digital fix so now they can go build PC's and it cant go tits up?\n\n**Now for some pussy boomer talk (aka fundametals or something).**\n\nThe expected Q3 EPS was -0.84$ or something close to that. The actual loss was -0.53$ but boomzoids only talked about the revenue drop. No shit sherlock its closing all its dead weight stores.\n\nIn the holiday report I will talk about a bit more below, 11% of stores were closed and revenue dropped only 3%. Comparitive store sales increased nearly 5%. They cant get enough consoles to sell so expect the momentum to carry on for the whole year I expect. Eccommerce is up 300% over holidays. In Q3 they reported 800% to date. In 2020 Gamestops eccomerce went up 24x. YES YOU READ THAT RIGHT. Online sales now account for \\~33% of Gamestops sales now. This is literally gold dust for ryan cohen.\n\nWe are still trading at 0.38 P/S at this price. The average P/S for the SP500 is 2.753. Massive upside on these two numbers alone.\n\nBurry got in this for the MOASS and the intrinsic value. At the time intrinsic value was like $22 and this will pump up as RC takes it to new heights.\n\nGME in Q3 somehow halved the expected loss. Big Bad Boomer sherman somehow didnt fuck it up that bad by saying \"omnichannel\" at the speed of light. Yes the revenue dropped 30% but thats covid for you. As the PC kiosk post above shows GME now sells small items basically so fast they have to have fake stock lmao. The new console cycle always spikes the share price sky high too, as youll see in a crayon drawing later. The potential revenue that this console cycle brings in could be huge. Biggest ever is potentially a true statement and Gamestop sells every fucker they get. Combine the fact that they share game pass ( a massive hit) revenue from the xboxes they sell, something no other retailer has, revenue could be sky high.\n\nNow I know you autists are starting to develop short term dyslexia or something but keep reading. This could be the most important piece of shit you read in your life. How do you think I feel? My brains overheating just trying to write coherent sentences.\n\nHoldiay report was a bear trap imo, saw people saying the decrease in revenue was bearish blah blah blah. Lies. Comparitve store sales rose 5% and thats with some towns having like 4 gamestops. When the leases dont get renewed and these stores get liquidated (Also in Ryan cohens letter) they can just get this influx of cash and pay down debt and invest in logistics and marketing and new growth. Gamestop realistically needs like 1/2 the stores they have now and just need to improve efficiency. \n\n[https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/349890](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/349890) this article the messiah himself wrote. In it he states:\n\n&gt;At Chewy, we had maniacal discipline when it came to how we spent money. The company-wide culture of frugality came from his example. Free cash flow was our unwavering governor of growth. We grew Chewy from $200 million in sales in 2013 to $3.5 billion in 2018 while spending only $130 million in capital, all of which went into opening distribution centers across the country and acquiring new customers.\n\nManiacal. Thats all I need to say. The guy is going to get to mars before papa musk and he wont even break a sweat. When FCF starts to catch up to WS expectations every cuck analyst who donwgraded them is gonna get ditched and upgrades will start to happen.\n\nSo in the headin i said its a steal. That implies some future higher price target right? Well here is my guess for a conservative price target based on the information above and also some more I probably forgot cos im a retard.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[The difference is where share price looks to be and where market cap places us is due to difference in outstanding shares \\(another reason shorts are fuk\\)](https://preview.redd.it/dehiug393wb61.png?width=1552&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f198773c36d5109382eb2beba6fade3c059121df)\n\n&gt;The difference is where share price looks to be and where market cap places us is due to difference in outstanding shares (another reason shorts are fuk)\n\nThis alone means if for not inflation adjusted terms we reached 9.8Bn or whatever the crayon chart says we should reach:\n\n9.8/2.48 = \\~3.95   3.95 \\* $35.5 = \\~$140. The share price now to reach old mkt cap is $140 fucking dollars. Thats a 4 bagger from now. It gets better. \n\nfrom [statista](https://statista.com) :\n\n&gt;Considering the **annual inflation rate in the United States** in recent years, a 2.24 percent **inflation rate** is a very moderate projection.\n\nIf we take 2.24% inflation, the this share price target in todays money means we should reach $182 because of $140 \\* 1.0224\\^12, = $182 in adjusted. Thats more than a 5 bagger. basically we could see $10 GME price from short manipulation and buying more is basically a lottery ticket!\n\nI really dont understand the bear thesis. The only bear thesis ( short term this one) was that margin would affect longs more but I looked at it on ortex and its basically bullshit. Buy shares with cash though dont use margin. Own your piece of GME dont borrow it. Bears just spout \"DigITaL\" or \"BlOCKbuSTER\" so much Ryan tweeted a shit emoji at them. All the bears think theyre clever. What the fuck makes those cucks special? How are they different now than the ones from $2, or $4, or $10. \n\n**Bears are betting against:**\n\nRyan fucking cohen, buisness legend CHEWY from 100k investment, now 40 billion\n\nMichael burry, Investing legend, predicted the housing crisis and is in GME since april\n\nu/DeepFuckingValue , the new WSB god chad, now basically a whale\n\nReggie Fils-Aim\u00e9, gaming and buisness legend, former COO of nintendo\n\nSenvest, a mega fund thats actively managed\n\nNorweigan sovereign wealth fund\n\nFidelity, Vanguard and blackrock own this shit and are never selling they literally dont give a shit\n\nAll of WSB has now formed a shield wall against the bears\n\nMicrosoft gave GME highly discounted azure deals and free office use for all employees and a revenue sharing agreement. Bears are stupid if they think MSFT didnt vet GME.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSome valid bear thesis left now (the only ones left) ----&gt; Ryan Cohen dies.\n\n# 2. Now some analysis on the short squeeze and some technical data on puts and calls and ortex data.\n\nOk everyone on here and their cat, dog, bedbugs and wifes boyfriend  knows about the squeeze. Jimmy chill aka cramer even talking about it. Gamestop is literally the most shorted stock of all time and space. The squeeze makes every autist salivate because its basically free money while cucking big money out of like what 1% of their fund.\n\nAlthough I know all you cucks hate shares, and hate holding, if the squeeze doesnt happen selling is probably the most retarded thing anyone could do. Its literally buy high sell low and you fucking disgust me. STONK ONLY GOES UP.\n\nThis squeeze is so monumental that its been sucking sharks in like fresh blood. Most of the funds where shorting this from 30-15 dollars before this year so they didnt really care. It all changed with 2 people. u/DeepFuckingValue and Dr. Michael Burry. These guys are as OG as it gets with GME. I think u/DeepFuckingValue may have even sniffed this trade out before the legend himself. Since then funds will have churned this through their rules and started jumping on this train. Ive been in since $13 with 125 shares. If I had more money Id be buying but im just some stupid student ok. Im merely a medium for this money made information.\n\n**The stats for this stock now short wise are, from ortex:**\n\n*Concrete* short interest as of 31 December 2020: **71 Million**.\n\n*Estimated* short interest, *January 11th data:* (This isnt predicted, this is from data in flow, has margin of error) : **77 Million**\n\nShort shares on loan 7 days ago: **50 Million**\n\nShort shares on loan *now* (This breaks the bearish margin calls affect longs more thesis): 54.2 Million\n\n% of known float short: **147%** as of 31 December 2020\n\n% of know free float on loaned shorts: **108%** as of January 11th.\n\nSome [guy](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kyocql/updated_potential_holdings_of_gme/) on here took into account extra buying on wednesday, Institutions, Burry, RC's extra 7% and WSB ownership (something so stupendously  retarded no serious firm will do it) that float on short could be in the 100s of %. Total short float now I would say could be **200-400%** if the numbers are correct.  This pisses on all other short squeezes. Some countries ban shorting above 100% cos of how autistic it is.\n\nThe recent hike in interactive brokers available shares is probably a mix of sell off on friday (remember  some guys are now buying lambos with GME money. If they held they could by 10), calls exercising and puts being covered and brokers ditching the shares. Nakedshort even reported 5 million naked GME shorts on friday. This is bullish as fuck because the best the shorts could do on a red market day was **-10%**.\n\nGamestop is still on the SECs threshold list for 27 days now.\n\n*Processing img xsetax08pwb61...*\n\nNeed rockets \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80:\n\nOk so now if WSB owns an estimated 6-8% of the stock and we all know to move over to cash accounts now to avoid margin calls, we should be minimizing longs getting margin called. Every bear on stockwits is a clueless cuck who spouts \"blockbuster\" and these guys dont even know what margin even is so my bet is the colossal **54 Million** shares short on loan are gonna be affected by the margin calls more. Why? Because every long on margin is in the green, and now a true zealot/extremist/autist for ryan cohen so will supply their account with collateral to avoid margin call. Shorts are in the massive red zone. How do I know you ask?\n\nOrtex data from Jan 4th 2021:\n\n*Processing img urqb3c3zbwb61...*\n\nSo this shows for jan 4th the estimated short interest is 66.98 Million shares. From the exchange reported 71 Million on december 31st this makes a lot of sense because the share price fell from \\~21 to \\~17 so shorts took profits. The shares on loan arent for longs too. This is all purely short data, and 47M  shorted at $17 this shows.\n\nThese shorts are in a circle of hell we cant comprehend and makes satan scared.\n\nNow for the data for this week:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Ortex short data for Jan 14th for Gamestop](https://preview.redd.it/5ryumpl1dwb61.png?width=1152&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fb80c09e1be7b2f36f6d3745983cef4ce2b2df9b)\n\nSHARES ON LOAN HAVE GONE UP.  BUT 87% OF LOANED SHORTS WHERE SHORTING AT SUB $20. \n\nCost to borrow is also up, estimated short interest is up to a cataclysmic amount.\n\nLongs on margin need to supply collateral, but we are in the massive green zone, shorts are underwater. Margin calls will ravage the shorts and sting the longs. We also have the uptick rule in place until the end of the day, so shorts can only short on the way up. Im not saying itll happen but this shit is skewed in our favour big time. we need to \ud83d\udc8e[\ud83d\ude4c](https://emojipedia.org/raising-hands/)\ud83d\udc8e[\ud83d\ude4c](https://emojipedia.org/raising-hands/)\ud83d\udc8e[\ud83d\ude4c](https://emojipedia.org/raising-hands/)\ud83d\udc8e[\ud83d\ude4c](https://emojipedia.org/raising-hands/)\ud83d\udc8e[\ud83d\ude4c](https://emojipedia.org/raising-hands/)\ud83d\udc8e[\ud83d\ude4c](https://emojipedia.org/raising-hands/)\ud83d\udc8e[\ud83d\ude4c](https://emojipedia.org/raising-hands/)\ud83d\udc8e[\ud83d\ude4c](https://emojipedia.org/raising-hands/).\n\n**Seen a lot of talk about Gamma hedging and delta.**\n\nYou realize that the fucking bankers and brokers dont understand gamma hedging right? That shits up their with the black-scholes equation and feynman-kac solution. Forget about it. The retards claiming to understand it are either payed by hedge funds or lose money. The guy who took out outs thinking options exercising and gamma hedging would lead to a collossal sell off on friday lost money on his puts because **no one** except some quants in a goldman sachs server room know this shit. The idea is simple about neutral delta on options that people take out, but the simple system interacts with every other thing in the stock market, and wow who couldve guessed it, like nearly any other element of the stock market predicting something by the day is nigh impossible. That guy talking about Gamma , Delta and margin calls is on weeklies. Hes no more autistic and equally retarded as all of us. Hes a chill guy though so dont berate a fellow brother.\n\n**Now weve established the likelihood of longs getting margin called is far smaller than shorts, on to the options distributions**\n\n**Two images now: Top one is before the end of the 15th, the other one is after market close:**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img t8odq9btgwb61...*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img 3nqb33f0hwb61...*\n\nThese two graphs, show before market close and after. As we can see the massiver 51000 put contracts didnt get rolled over and the chances that those were melvins july puts rolled up is very high. They expired worthless. Lots of calls are printing big time while huge amounts of puts are worthless and bleeding money.\n\nSomething else we can extrapolate from the charts is that massive options trades are not present on the scale we saw before (tens of thousands).\n\n\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \n\nWe are seeing a discrepancy in the number of puts/calls opening up at the higher prices with calls gaining fast. This could show that some funds are now becoming optimistic on the long or short term prospects of gamestop. There are also more puts than options and if we assume this for shorts vs longs on margin (without even taking into account that all shorts are borrowed shares and pay interest further bleeding cash) then shorts are likely on more margin than longs.\n\nRegardless fellow autists my main point is two show that the bears are underwater and the bulls are flying high with regards to options.\n\n**Now lets compare this possible squeeze with others.**\n\nBear in mind this is the most shorted stock of all time, but differences in free float change the share price differently.\n\nKodak went from **$2.16 to $33.2**\n\nVolkswagen went from **\\~200 euro to nearly 1000.**\n\nOverstock went from **\\~$21 to $123**\n\nBlue apron went from **$2.31 to $18** \n\nIve been seeing some estimated that 1 million shares is roughly a dollars move in share price. This maths is about to be pretty autistic so bear with me degnerates.\n\n$1 now is 2.81% of the share price. Everything in the markets is exponential and based on percentages. So if we assume a full squeeze of ortexs estimated short interest (This assumes no sell off and no new shorts, new shorts can be positive or negative depedning on when in the squeeze they happen) **$35.5 \\* 1.0281\\^77 = $299.** GME to moon. \ud83c\udf11 .\n\nThis shit can happen. Hold on.\n\n**GME has squeezed and been manipulated before and it always happens around the console cycles. Shorts never win and they wont win now.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img 4ysv7bzclwb61...*\n\nBasically the crayon chart shows green (outstanding shares) orange ( short shares) purple (Market cap) and cyan (Share price). In 2006-2008 the share price rose in tandem with short interest ( Like now ) Until console releases when you can see an abrupt squeeze happend mooning the share price. \n\nThis happend to a degree in 2013 with the xbox one but worse conditions for the company and a worse console launch lead to slow short covering but the share price still mooned.\n\nNow we get to the best part. History is repeating itself for the third time and the shares sold short are literally higher than the outstanding shares, which have been decreasing since 2010. Short shares are also at the highest point ever and GME hasnt had a brighter future, well ever. Ps5 and Xbox Series X. are the two most hyped consoles since the Ps2. This is setting up the foundations for massive price movements weve never seen before. This shit has literally never happend, ever. Uncharted waters and we are the captain.\n\n**For the insurmountably retarded autists who think that the squeeze has happend look upon this and despair:**\n\n[**https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kwpf6k/gme\\_gang\\_there\\_hasnt\\_been\\_a\\_short\\_squeeze\\_yet/**](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kwpf6k/gme_gang_there_hasnt_been_a_short_squeeze_yet/)\n\nIHOR IS A MEGA WIZARD\n\nIhor I quote:\n\n&gt;**A long-buying tsunami ... is the primary factor for the price move**\n\nIhor Dusaniwsky is managing director of predictive analytics at S3 a firm similar to ortex. He told bloomberg that the squeeze hasnt happend yet and that this was long buying. If someone knows this shit its him. He was talking about the tesla squeeze in january 2020. He has access to resources we can only imagine. Barrons cut his comment that the squeeze hasnt happend yet out it was that fucking bullish. All the media ramming down \"Short squeeze has happend\" down peoples throats because bears are fucking scared.\n\nThe bots on stocktwits spamming bearish sentiment should show how rattled they are.\n\n**Conclusion: Buy shares with cash not margin. Hold shares forever unless RC dies (Shame hes a cybernetic demigod), Melvin bad, Shorts fuk, \ud83d\udc3b \ud83c\udf08  posting bearish shit are doing weeklies for the second time after they expired red on friday, GME to $200 without squeeze, Ryan cohen a god, GME is still a value play, Good luck have fun.**",

Hundred of thousands of retail (wsb) are buying the GME 60C across the options calendar and MM can't hedge properly because there are not enough GME shares to buy to properly financially hedge (accounting for the interest rate to borrow)\n\nMarket Structure\n\nTo summarize the market structure:\n\n1. Few GME shares to hedge.\n2. Hundreds of thousands of (wsb) are buying the GME 60C because of the infinite short squeeze.\n3. January 29, 2021 60C call option are the highest one on the option change for that date.\n4. Conditions for Infinite Gamma Squeeze &amp; Infinite Short Squeeze\n\nAs you may now realize --(MM and brokers) hope you don't -- there is a gap in the market structure that leaves them (MM/Citadel) vulnerable to massive losses.\n\n***Should*** **million of retails (wsb) buy the Januray 29, 2021 60C weekly on Monday, this will create an infinite gamma squeeze because MM still can't properly hedge, and are forced to buy shares at whatever price to hedge. MM doing so, forces brokers to margin call the shorts caught in their infinite short squeeze. Both conditions are pro-cyclical and feed on each other in an infinite feedback loop** ***so long as more an more retails buy the GME 60C.***\n\nThere is a chance that MM can dump the shares they bought to hedged the gamma steepening and call buying \\[2\\]. However, doing so does not make them market neutral. It effectively turns MM into a hedge fund. SEC may allow them to get away from this momentarily.\n\n**However, after the MM dump shares in an attempt to stop the infinite gamma squeeze they will be net short GME shares and unhedged/not market neutral.** If after the MM dump, retails continue to buy GME shares up to the $60 price, MM will be caught in a *exponentially worse gamma squeeze*, which should GME go pass 60C (gamma bump) on the week of January 25, it would turn into the one of biggest tail risk event for the MM/Citidaal.\n\n**tldr;**\n\n**There is a gap in the market structure so that if millions of retails buy Januray 29 GME 60C on January 25 2021, there is a high probability of both an infinite gamma and short squeeze. This has never happened in financial history. And should millions of retail buy the January 29 GME60C 2021, the losses for MM but profits for retail. Retails could see 100000% return on their weekly GME Januray 29 60C options.**\n\n**Edit1:** Apparently there may be higher call prices for the January 29 2021 option chains. Fundamentally, this analysis is still correct. Should millions of retail all choose a common call strike price to buy, the gamma squeeze will be triggered when that prices is hit.\n\nExample:\n\nShould millions of retail buy the January 29 70C or January 29 75C, and the infinite short squeeze continues. If the GME 70C or 75C is hit, GME share price enters a gamma squeeze.\n\nWhat the MM are hoping for are twofolds:\n\n1. They scare retails to sell below $60. This alleviates the infinite gamma squeeze. Or;\n2. Retails don't all buy the same call options. But given that wsb loves high risk, I hypothesize they will all choose the furthest OTM call options.\n\nGME at 60 is the Maginot line next week. Should it go to 75, gamma and infinite short squeeze continues. Should it fall below it, MM have won a strategic victory.\n\nReferences\n\n\\[1\\] h[ttps://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l2t9bf/gme\\_i\\_think\\_this\\_is\\_a\\_gamma\\_squeeze\\_where\\_dealers/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l2t9bf/gme_i_think_this_is_a_gamma_squeeze_where_dealers/)\n\n\\[2\\] [https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/l21gpz/infinite\\_short\\_squeeze\\_explained\\_blue\\_appron\\_case/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/l21gpz/infinite_short_squeeze_explained_blue_appron_case/)\n\n\\[3\\] [https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/options?p=GME](https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/options?p=GME)",

        "selftext": "**1, Brand loyalty and the NIO COMMUNITY**\n\nif you think tesla owners are cult followers, you have yet to seen Nio owners. Nio spent years and tons of money building and maintaining the Nio community that I have never seen any car manufacturer has done in the world. They built and are still building luxurious \"Nio house\" that both serve as dealerships on the first floor AND a place for Nio owners to hang on the second floor all over China. Instead of going to starbucks/library/sending their kids to day cares, many Nio owners go to Nio house to spend their weekend or send their kids to Nio house to meet the kids of other Nio owners. When you purchase a Nio car, you also join a big family.\n\n[There are tons of well designed Nio houses like this one in China ](https://preview.redd.it/jtfwd9j80ha61.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=63191752b59e6a5661087aaf45048221e6c6922f)\n\nTo give you autists an example how much Nio owners love their Nio cars and their community, Nio community in Shenzhen rented a fucking plane to fly to Chengdu to watch the Nio day. The pilot, co-pilot, flight attendants and all passengers aboard are all Nio owners. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hvny4zba1ha61.jpg?width=473&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1a2611b9f328006ad5a4c34775ca787104e05d55\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThey also developed an app (similar format as reddit) for Nio owners. They can post what they love OR hate about their Nio cars and William Li constantly checks the app for owners feedbacks. The fact that they don't just delete the negative posts right away but allows them to exist or even being upvoted to the front page and William Li himself would promise improvements shows their confidence and their determination on building this user-centered brand reputation.  \n\n[The Nio APP](https://preview.redd.it/pcnoj06shha61.jpg?width=591&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1eda62ddf16e8b0ba0dfa5ddb5f0be1430b3620c)\n\n*Processing img s1af28zshha61...*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOverall, I have yet to seen a single Nio owner who doesn't like the Nio service and does not recommend their family/friends to buy a Nio, it really is a cult. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**2, Battery swap**\n\nI saw a lot of retards here shitting on the battery swap, and those people are dumb af. First you need to understand that not every Chinese lives in a house like most Americans do and a lot of them don't have charger installed at home or a fixed parking spot to park their cars. If they do have a fixed parking spot, Nio cars have fast charging and CAN be charged at home just like Tesla. For those who dont have this privilege, do you think they'd prefer to spend 5-10 mins to get their battery swapped on the way home once a week OR find a public charging station and sit there for 2 hours waiting for their cars to get fully charged? \n\nNot to mention that all Nio cars share the same battery size, meaning the battery are upgradable. Say all the sudden you want to do a road trip, not only you don't have to worry wasting time charging your battery along the way, you can also rent a bigger size battery from Nio for a short time for longer range.  When solid state battery tech are mature, old Nio models can just buy a new battery comparing to buying a new car.(It's truly future proof)  No other EVs can do those. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wje1sek45ha61.png?width=3840&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dbff76cc058b08c0d2b976e9a85b294cdc6dab6b\n\n**3,How Nio are perceived as a brand and how Nio is positioning themselves in the Chinese EV market.** \n\nChina, for the past two decades, are gradually transforming from producing cheap shit for quick money to building quality products like Huawei, Xiaomi, Oppo etc are doing. However, there still ARE tons of people who would choose an established foreign brand over Chinese brand simply becasue of the subpar quality of Chinese products in the past, and it's an uphill battle for Chinese brands to gain the trust of Chinese consumers, especially the new emerging Chinese middle class with crazy buying power. \n\nTesla, on the other hand, have a huge fan base in China. I test drove Tesla model 3, Nio ES6, Xpeng P7, and Tesla model X. My objective verdict is, in terms of comfort and localization, Nio and Xpeng are both fantstic cars(better than Tesla in many aspects) and great value whereas Teslas are better driver's car with interior and build quality felt much cheaper. However, due to the high price of Model S and Model X and Tesla being a pioneer of EV, Tesla are viewed as a top brand in China. Even though Model 3 and Y both are aimed at the lower end market in China and have relativly poor build quality and way worse localization than Xpeng and Nio, the Tesla badge alone is worth a lot in many Chinese consumers' eyes, which is why Tesla are selling so well here and has higher demand by the day. \n\n*Processing img xomq27pa9ha61...*\n\nWith the relase of Nio ES8, ES6, EC6 and now ET7, Nio's strategy here is smart imo: they are trying to eat up the lunch of BMW, AUDI, Merc and even Porsche instead of releasing lower end cars to compete with Tesla in price. Because if say there is a a \"Nio ET3\" with similar price as Tesla Model 3 (40k USD) in the market rn, the majority of the Chinese buyers will take the Model 3 for the Tesla badge. And in my experience, Nio has done a great job stealing owners of high end German cars with their great service, the Nio community, and their great cars. Two of my neighbors who used to drive Audi Q7 and BMW 7 series swtiched to Nio ES6 and bascially became Nio salesman/saleswoman lol, and that speaks for the quality of Nio products. While there are many retards who are using the price of Tesla Model 3/Y to trash on Nio online, Nio ES8 ES6 EC6 ET7 will sell well as the demand for luxurious EV is there in China and Nio is pretty much the only option. I believe eventually Nio will release a 40k USD car in a year or two, but I like their strategy now. \n\n[My neightbor's ES6](https://preview.redd.it/kb0aut7ebha61.jpg?width=800&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=43854d812406010c570e2693dffe77349f3393a4)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**4, The Chinese EV market** \n\nSome of you retards already know this, but the majority of you don't, so let me give you some info on why the Chinese gov is pushing EV and how they are doing it. China is huge, but the natural resources per capita is low, especially oil. We heavily rely on the oil import from Russia and the middle East, and without them the the domestic oil supply is unsustainable. Electricity, however, is another story. Not only we have much greater coal reserve, the Chinese gov are pushing clean energy like crazy (hydro power, wind power, nuclear power etc), the amount of hydro power generated by Chinese dams are more than every single country's entire grid except the US and India.  While charging stations in the west are privately owned, Chinese goverment are literally pouring money into building all the infrastructure preparing a shift from ICE cars to EV. When CPC are determined to do something, they will get it done. Meanwhile, in mega cities like Beijing and Shanghai, the waitlist for owning an ICE car is literally several years while you can buy and register an EV right away with government subsidies. I think CPC will roll out more and more strict policies on owning ICE cars and eventually indirectly ban them. Even if 1 percent of Chinese drivers choose to buy a Nio in the future, that's still a HUGE number. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j0kmy2q7eha61.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9c51284b5bd30f44fc3e3b179b99c3f4ad76ddb0\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img pdotyiewdha61...*\n\nOverall, I'm really bullish on not just Nio, but also Xpeng, Li Auto, BYD, CATL etc and think Nio has a very bright future if things go right. \n\nWith the European expansion in the foreeable future, great leadership under William Li, great relationship between Nio and CATL and Nio and Nvidia, great products and great service, the cult of Nio community, and increasingly and inevitably more Chinese customers swtiching to EV, Nio has all the potential be the Huawei of Chinese auto manufacturer.  Buy Nio(Xpeng, BYD, CATL) stocks/leaps as much as you can and diamond hand them. it's going to be a wild ride but you will thank me in a few years with your multi baggers. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: NIO to the fucking moon \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80",

        "selftext": "I am a hedge fund manager (long-short, derivative mixed equity fund primarily value focused with some growth). In the past we have been value holders of GME three other times and started a small position today nears it's intraday high and will likely add to this next week should the stock fall.   Previously all my Reddit comments have involved my e-Skate collection or my landing of my airplane in challenging conditions (see: [https://youtu.be/Rn7XoYKlZl0](https://youtu.be/Rn7XoYKlZl0)) However, I can't resist commenting on the fascinating technical factors that likely will continue to propel this issue higher - perhaps significantly so over the next few weeks.  Andrew Left's mocking derision of retail investors may prove to be his waterloo.  Why would a value focused fund manager buy a stock that based on classic fundamental value analysis appears significantly overvalued?  \n\nGME appears to be a very interesting example of individual stock reflexivity.  What is reflexivity you ask?  This is the theory, originally promoted by George Soros that the stock market itself can cause the economy to either rise of fall (as opposed to the classic teaching that the economy affects the stock market).  An example of market reflexivity would be the great depression whereby a crashed market brought down an economy that was only in an ordinary recession, or the recent improvement in the economy, not withstanding Covid, which has followed a rising market.  In GME's case the rise in the stock price itself will likely result in fundamental improvements to the underlying economic metrics of the company.  Why?\n\n1. As the price of the stock rises, GME finds itself in the enviable position where it can use it's stock at currency to buy complementary businesses it could not otherwise afford - monetization of the current short squeeze by the enterprise will lead to fundamentally higher revenue and profits of the enterprise should they find good strategic acquisitions to further monetize their large retail customer base (which has real and to date largely untapped value).  The company is likely right now on the hunt for a major acquisition that could fundamentally alter the companies future prospects with that acquisition largely paid for on the back of short seller covering.\n2. Monetization of the short covering increase in share price via issue of a secondary .   The $500 million in debt (net of cash) the company currently has could be entirely extinguished with a secondary that is dilutive of only 10% of the equity base.  In fact such a secondary will, despite this dilution, likely result in a significant price rise for the stock (versus the usual fall in price after most, but not all, secondaries).  Bankruptcy risk will largely be eliminated with this secondary as will interest rate risk and financing costs ultimately increasing cash flow per share.  A 20% secondary will leave the company in a strong cash positive position with this cash available for expansion of sales efforts, cloud offerings, acquisitions, etc.\n3. Directly increased sales and revenue by virtue of the large amount of attention this epic short squeeze has brought to the company.  I suspect most long retail stockholders have explored the companies web offerings and are considering becoming customers.  This is free advertising to people with money who are tech savvy and the exact demographic GME would target with paid advertising.  \n4. Retention and efforts of existing management now becomes easy.  Every manager there wants to see this continue.  Operations at companies with sinking share prices typically suffer as management and employees leave the enterprise or develop anger and lassitude (think Sears Holdings).   The opposite is occurring here with every manager trying to beat their numbers to see the squeeze continue.\n5. This issue remains extremely heavily shorted.  Despite the squeeze that has already occurred, other \"value\" based investors have dived into short positions as the price has risen.  The short positions of this issue appears (although I can't be certain) to exceed 100% with all available shares already lent out from marginal accounts and probably a lot of naked shorting going on as well.  Although I don't yet have the current data on todays short position, I can say for certain the stock remains very heavily shorter, perhaps more so now than at any previous time.  Today, I called my broker asking about the availability of shares to short and the borrow costs.  We have one of the larger accounts at our brokers firm and I was able to speak directly to the \"hard to borrow\" desk.  No borrowable shares are available at any broker, anywhere, at this time, even for high borrow costs or even from other brokers.  This extreme short against a small common float, made more extreme no-doubt by naked shorting, could end very poorly for those short this issue.  As they are forced to close out their positions, the stock will continue to rise and continue to exacerbate the positive effects the rising price has on the above 4 issues.\n\nImpossible to know really where the stock goes from here as there does currently exist a disconnect from fundamentals. However, the extreme short position against the unrestricted common float here suggests to me there is a much greater chance of GME's price continuing to increase, perhaps significantly so, and this chance is far greater than the now fearful pundit in hiding's proclamation that the stock would soon see $20.\n\nFor what it's worth, over the past 13 years of this funds life, we have significantly beaten both the overall market and the dow,  (12.2%/year margin over DJIA inclusive of dividends since 2008).  We  have had plenty of losing issues despite this beat but also way more big winners, some really big.  Right now my money's with the retail investors who are long GME.  We only have a small position here but this may prove a big winner for us also.  Cheers.",

        "selftext": "Hello WSB\n\nI am making this post because I love this community and I want it to stay up for as long as possible. Since our community is starting to get very big right now and get a lot of media attention it is important that we think about what we comment and post. As a reddit user since many years back I have seen and been a part of communities that were shut down. Let me give you some exampels.\n\nr/WatchPeopleDie \u267015 March 2019 was a controversial subreddit from the very beginning since the main focus was to post media of real-life human deaths. After many years of complaints it was allowed to stay up as a quarantined subreddit. So what happend? The Christchurch shooting happened, long story made short a dude livestreamed a video of himself shooting up a mosque. Government agencies in different countries told people in general to not spread the video, guess what WPD did? Ye they posted the video... many times. But reddit didn't ban them immediately, they removed the posts they found and posted a sticky on the subreddit where reddit staff urged the users to not FUCKING POST THE VIDEO. But WPD went full retard and kept posting it. In a blink of an eye the whole subreddit was deleted, wiped from the face of this earth, gone forever. This went fast too, literally all of this happened within one day. For the same reason r/Gore \u267015 March 2019 was banned within 10 minutes after WPD.\n\nr/Physical_Removal \u267015 August 2017 advocated/joked/memed about violence against leftists but was allowed to exist because after all you know it's just memes lol. Then during the Unite the right rally in Charlottesville a person was killed by a car driven by a rightwinger. This sub went full retard and started to mock the dead person by being offensive and posting pictures/videos of the incident. This caused huge media attention and thereby pressure on reddit which resulted in the ban.\n\nr/DarkNetMarkets was a sub that was mostly about discussion about markets and vendors. This was enough for US authorities to pressure reddit on information about users on there and probably the reason why they removed it. People never actually sold stuff over this subreddit, but the discussion about the darknet markets was enough.\n\nr/pizzagate was a sub dedicated to the pizzagate conspiracy and was banned because they doxed a person believed to be a part of the conspiracy. \n\nThis is just a few examples of communities that I know about and some of them I myself was a part of. Many more communities have been deleted than the ones mentioned here that I don't even know about. And I am getting worried about WSB because I am starting to see resemblances with WSB and subreddits that were shutdown.\n\n1. We are starting to pick fights with people in the real world out there while at the same time the memes are getting more aggressive. We don't want to pick fights with the wrong people/institutions, now it turns out Citron was just a guy in an apartment lol, but next time? We picking fights with large banks? SEC? Remember the examples above, government agencies have put pressure on reddit before to shut shit down, if they want to get rid of us believe me they can do it.\n\n2. Media attention is getting big. This is not good, media have put pressure on reddit before as I showed you above, if we upset them, fuck with them, pick fight with them or whatever that makes them not like us the media can fuck us back hard just like before.\n\n3. Pump-and-dump of a stock is illegal and we don't want to fuck with the law. Remember above, r/darknetmarkets was only discussing illegal stuff not doing it on the subreddit but that was still enough for big government to fuck them. What you are doing when you write stuff like \"LET US PUMP XXX ROCKETSHIP EMOJI\" is giving them a reason to fuck us so stop doing it.\n\n4. Stop doxing. Remember r/pizzagate was banned because of doxing. So when u dox this Citron guy and send pizza to his fucking place that's putting the whole subreddit at risk.\n\nI don't want WSB to end up in the same graveyard as my other beloved subreddits that are lying there. So think about what you are commenting and posting, we got the media watching us right now and maybe even government agencies are taking interest in us too. And most important of all, if the admins on reddit tell us to stop doing something then u fucking stop doing that thing. Because if it goes that far the admins probably have CIA breathing down their necks.\n\nAlso backup subs doesn't work it has already been tried before. r/beatingwomen tried r/beatingwomen2, r/incels tried r/braincells... didn't work. So if we wanna make a backup plan we need to get more sophisticated, maybe create our own platform.\n\nAnyway shoutout to PLTR gang may tendieman come visit us\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80",

        "selftext": "**TLDR: The whole Citron attack, the news articles, Cramer etc was planned by pissed off hedge-funds (mainly Melvin) who want to portray WSB as a coordinated market manipulating entity. By pinning the blame for current volatility or anything that may go wrong in the future on us, no one will bother looking at how many laws they break actually manipulating markets everyday such as naked short-selling. Hedge funds are bleeding, and they're fighting to cover - Source: London Hedge Fund PM**\n\nHi everyone,\n\nTime to finally spill the beans about what's really going on here. WSB deserves to know.\n\nLong-time lurker here. This is a crazy but true story so buckle-up for a wild-ride. Here is evidence of my conversations with the mods, before the Shitron shit went down. Most of the complex, sensitive stuff was explained via signal call with OIP. Numerous emails which would be too long too disclose and also containing sensitive info were exchanged (takes centuries to write this shit out as you can see) but here are the things which I can release. It's very hard to prove everything because it's based on a tip I got from a reliable source and I don't have a recording of my calls with him or OIP, but here's proof I can provide without compromising certain people that I know what I'm talking about:\n\n[Evidence of modmail sent before this shit. Note the \"Urgent\" before this shit went down](https://imgur.com/a/Cx6SDAT)\n\n[Initial response by u/zjz to my private mod mail warning about impending chaos by the shorts to WSB via encrypted email](https://imgur.com/a/flE9HRE)\n\n[Signal warning to OIP after mod mail message (1)](https://imgur.com/a/mVbH0FD)\n\n[Very short explanation to OIP before sleeping (2) - went into depth on a call the next day](https://imgur.com/a/HkLqOA0)\n\n[Initially dismissed by Bacon, but after initial discussions he knew I had something](https://imgur.com/a/ARR3Edp)\n\n[Evidence of call with OIP - Signal doesn't show length](https://imgur.com/a/Ti9sEU3)\n\n[One of my convos with Bacon Futures (had to cut off because sensitive info)](https://imgur.com/a/hX1z6s7)\n\n[End of Conversation with Bacon Futures - Backing my post in light of all evidence provided](https://imgur.com/a/NfGkmPD)\n\n[More conversation with OIP - references proving that I mentioned these upcoming events](https://imgur.com/a/XFc5nzz)\n\n[OIP confirming on Thursday that my warnings were true and panned out exactly how I said they would](https://imgur.com/a/5TmznIF)\n\n**Storytime:**\n\nEarlier this week (I'm British) I sent an urgent message to the mods via a private channel (truth is if I put the full details of that screenshot some people involved who may be reading this will figure out the source potentially) warning them about information I received from a hedge fund trader at a boutique British fund who happens to be in the know about a lot of things going on behind the scenes in the market (he has friends in the SEC from his time in NYC) . I contacted the mods as fast as possible, I warned of a ridiculous conspiracy, some shit uncovered that was ridiculously crazy and that the mods had to know urgently. I gave them my encrypted email and phone. I got on a Signal call with OIP for some time, but also talked to Bacon Futures and [u/zjz](https://www.reddit.com/u/zjz/) about this situation. Everything I told them panned out, in the specific ways I said (I didn't know it would be Citron tweeting, but I knew and told OIP that some unexpected people with weight and attention would get involved very soon and take on WSB head-on). Initially I was treated like a jokeman and a crazy conspiracy theorist but zjz and Bacon both came around in the end. The 3 mods I have referred to will hopefully confirm in the comment section below that I indeed did warn ahead of these events unfolding.\n\n**But anyways, it's time you guys hear what my source had to say:**\n\nHe warned that there were many more hedge funds involved with the naked short-selling of GME and that the recent short/gamma squeeze had really pissed off quite a few people who were now faced with the prospects of huge losses on their books. Ever since WSB was covered by Luke Kawa on Bloomberg, firms have been keeping an eye on the sub. But this was the final straw, when retail investors just fucked over the institutions who are so used to manipulating markets the way they want through illegal practices such as naked short-selling. They were pissed off, royally, and finally decided to do something about the growing retail investor base (WSB) who were making money too easily, and that too at their expense.\n\nTheir plan is simple.\n\n1. **First of all, get the finance world to start covering WSB again heavily. Notice how there wasn't much coverage before of all the crazy things people on this sub have bought and how far they went up?** But recently, everyone's focused on WSB. They have to push the narrative that we are out-of-control retail investors (Brits like me who use CFDs are exempt lol) who are an institution, a solid group, manipulating markets. This turns the public perception of WSB, what is a retarded forum famous for both immense gain and loss porn, into a group of highly coordinated manipulators fueled by nothing but short-term greed. **Barrons, Cramer, Seeking Alpha, Business Insider, Bloomberg, Wall Street Journal, Marketwatch, even VICE FUCKING NEWS** etc everyone's on us. Never had this much coverage. It's all paid jobs coordinated across the media to draw attention to this. It's also to draw attention away from the fact that they engaged in naked short-selling and that's a key reason why the squeeze has been so hard.\n2. **Collude together to get someone who is considered a heavyweight to intervene and take on the WSB head on, explicitly.** I told OIP on Monday that there were much bigger fish involved in this and that we'd rattled the hornet's nest and that my source didn't want to give me a name but he said they were well-known short-sellers. He said their goal was to act as the public muscle on behalf of Melvin (remember how he sucked Melvin off completely during the video?) and others with an unexpected entrance (to spice things up and again draw public attention) and paint a straw-man of Reddit traders being the sole force behind GME going up (and not a combination of Cohen coming in, general turnaround buying, naked-short selling squeeze as well as options gamma squeeze from WSB). Not only does the market listen to Citron in general, so some puts can finally go in-the-money (notice how the expiry of the contracts is tomorrow?), but it draws huge attention. **Their sole intention is to villify and demonise retail investors, and to squeeze every penny out of us as they can like they normally do**. The whole situation doesn't make sense from a logical point of view... Why would **Citron enter out of nowhere, shill for Melvin, consistently repeat that GME is going to $20, postpone their speech for \"inauguration\", get \"hacked by too many people\" and then a mysterious person buys puts at the same time as the announcement?**\n\nThe whole markets are watching now, Institutions vs Retail. Citron takes on all GME buyers. Surprisingly enough, having told OIP explicitly that we should not act like a coordinated group with the GME pushing unless we want something crazy to unfold (OIP passed the message to the senior mods), the very next day WSB makes a twitter account with inflammatory comments like \"**We are a force to be reckoned with\" \"We are taking over\" \"It's time for us to have a voice\"**. My source told me weirdly enough ahead of time that there would be some form of public contact/calling out between short-sellers and WSB. **He literally said their tactic was to draw WSB out explicitly, paint us as a collective single entity which coordinates trades and turn the public sentiment against us**. I literally told this to OIP exactly on the call, that the hedge-fund muscle (didn't know it was fucking Shitron then) were going to come out and attack WSB for the first time directly as a bunch of clueless traders and suckers. **Literally, everything unwound almost exactly as my source claimed they would**. This started happening slowly before but I only got the tip now about the full story. They were bleeding before, they got their buddy Cramer (who's admitted to openly manipulating markets) to push for a GME stock offering to give those gay shorts liquidity. \"Shore up the balance sheet\" and some BS. Constantly moving from side to side. The whole thing is completely off. As I consistently said to the mods in my messages (images), the twitter account plays right into their hands and it's basically doing their job for them. You couldn't get more explicit than saying that you're \"**taking over\"** a market and a \"**force to be reckoned with\"**. We couldn't be more explicit in trying to get the SEC to investigate the subreddit. Even if we did control the stock market, the worst thing you can do is write these things out explicitly on Twitter where the SEC are known (Hi Papa Elon) to be fucking strict.\n\n**My opinion**: Getting retail investors out of the game has been a goal of the financial establishment for some time. They cannot fathom that what was once a big boys only table has now been democratised into any autist with $100 can buy options and make money. Meme stocks made more money than the hedge funds last year. They want us out of the game. It's that simple. But don't worry, they'll probably put restrictions in the name of \"protecting unsophisticated retail investors from volatility\". They'll ban your options without owning the underlying (but keep an exception for authorised financial institutions) just like they lobbied to class CFDs as swaps and keep them out of US retail's hands (freedom my arse). Pattern day trader rules, hello? **In the future something is probably going to seriously wrong, and they'll pin it on \"the uneducated retail investors\".**\n\nTo preserve the future of this sub, we must not act like or even entertain the idea that we are an institution. Deepfuckingvalue made a really good call, and kudos to him. **But the whole GME situation has gone too far, and you know it has when Cramer, Shitron, Melvin and a ton of major news outlets are all hammering on about WSB and GME**. **Not acting like an institution extends to not having a Twitter account which \"speaks on behalf of WSB\"**. There's bull gang, bear gang, cash gang, theta gang etc etc.\n\nFellow autists, I hope you can see this. As for the lead mods, please heed my warnings. As fun as it is crushing the institutions, they have much more power us retail investors. The SEC itself was founded by a fucking insider trader. **Only 1 person went to jail for the financial crisis but they sent a WSBer to jail for filing a false acquisition offer for Fitbit**. The game is rigged, always has been. Stick to meme stocks, go back to inversing each other to see who wins. Or post diamond in the rough DD which WSB is famed for. Thanks. \n\nHigh profiles do not help anyone, and it leads to things like this happening which threaten the very existence of our sub. **We may win the battle, but we will most definitely lose the war against these corrupt entities who bribe politicians to get bailed out when they fuck up, make laws to ruin their competition, manipulate markets for their own gain and have a chummy, revolving door with the SEC.**\n\nCitron, Cramer, Melvin. Fuck you. You guys are the true scum of the earth. I don't care that you're short GME, I care that you're taking part in collusion, market manipulation via naked shorting, and the intentional villification of small time day traders. \n\nJust like in 2008, you're coming up with bullshit and trying to sell it as AAA. Just like you villified the poor people and immigrants for taking home loans instead of the people like yourselves who committed securities fraud, you're villifying the small retail trader trying to make some money in a period of massive job losses whilst you continue to manipulate markets as you've done for decades and keep minting money.\n\n[u/zjz](https://www.reddit.com/u/zjz/) [u/OPINION\\_IS\\_UNPOPULAR](https://www.reddit.com/u/OPINION_IS_UNPOPULAR/) [u/ITradeBaconFutures](https://www.reddit.com/u/ITradeBaconFutures/)\n\nMy phone just died but imagine seeing the obligatory rockets,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nTendy Capital",

        "selftext": "Full disclosure, stolen from r/investing\n\nContext\n\nWhat happened last week with GME stock price and option was a combination of a gamma squeeze [1] and infinite short squeeze [2]. For the first time in financial history all GME call options are in the money (ITM) because the highest call strike price set by the CBOE for Januaray 29, 2021 is $60.\nNote:\u00a0A primer on gamma squeeze:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l2t9bf/gme_i_think_this_is_a_gamma_squeeze_where_dealers/\nMarket Maker [1] are in a condition never observed in financial history. Hundred of thousands of retail are buying the GME 60C across the options calendar and MM can't hedge properly because there are not enough GME shares to buy to properly financially hedge (accounting for the interest rate to borrow)\n\nMarket Structure\n\nTo summarize the market structure:\n\nFew GME shares to hedge.\n\nHundreds of thousands of are buying the GME 60C because of the infinite short squeeze.\n\nJanuary 29, 2021 60C call option are the highest one on the option change for that date.\n\nConditions for Infinite Gamma Squeeze &amp; Infinite Short Squeeze\n\nAs you may now realize --(MM and brokers) hope you don't -- there is a gap in the market structure that leaves them (MM/Citadel) vulnerable to massive losses.\nInfinite Gamma Squeeze\nShould\u00a0million of retails buy the Januray 29, 2021 60C weekly on Monday, this will create an infinite gamma squeeze because MM still can't properly hedge, and are forced to buy shares at whatever price to hedge. MM doing so, forces brokers to margin call the shorts caught in their infinite short squeeze. Both conditions are pro-cyclical and feed on each other in an infinite feedback loop\u00a0so long as more an more retails buy the GME 60C.\nThere is a chance that MM can dump the shares they bought to hedged the gamma steepening and call buying [1]. However, doing so does not make them market neutral. It effectively turns MM into a hedge fund. SEC may allow them to get away from this momentarily.\nHowever, after the MM dump shares in an attempt to stop the infinite gamma squeeze they will be net short GME shares and unhedged/not market neutral.\u00a0If after the MM dump, retails continue to buy GME shares up to the $60 price, MM will be caught in a\u00a0exponentially worse gamma squeeze, which should GME go pass 60C (gamma bump) on the week of January 25, it would turn into the one of biggest tail risk event for the MM/Citidal.\ntldr;\nThere is a gap in the market structure so that if millions of retails buy Januray 29 GME 60C on January 25 2021, there is a high probability of both an infinite gamma and short squeeze. This has never happened in financial history. And should millions of retail buy the January 29 GME60C 2021, the losses for MM but profits for retail will be massive. Retails could see 100000% return on their weekly GME Januray 29 call options at the highest strike price.\nEdit1:\u00a0Apparently there may be higher call prices for the January 29 2021 option chains. Fundamentally, this analysis is still correct. Should millions of retail all choose a common higher call strike price to buy (higher than 60C), the gamma squeeze will be triggered when that prices is hit.\nExample:\nShould millions of retail buy the January 29 70C or January 29 75C, and the infinite short squeeze continues. If the GME 70C or 75C is hit, GME share price enters a gamma squeeze.\nWhat the MM are hoping for are twofolds:\n\nThey scare retails to sell below $60. This alleviates the infinite gamma squeeze. Or;\n\nRetails don't all buy the same call options. But given that retail loves high risk, I hypothesize they will all choose the furthest OTM call options.\n\nGME at 60 is the Maginot line next week. Should it go to 75, gamma and infinite short squeeze continues. Should it fall below it, MM have won a strategic victory.\nEdit2:\nFor gamma squeeze, you look at the open interest (OI) and strike price. Should the share price get close to the price with a highest open interest, that's when the gamma steepening occurs as probability goes to 1. MM have to buy shares to remain neutral as the options are now ITM.\n\nReferences\n\n[1] https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l2t9bf/gme_i_think_this_is_a_gamma_squeeze_where_dealers/\n[2]\u00a0/r/stocks/comments/l21gpz/infinite_short_squeeze_explained_blue_appron_case/\n[3]\u00a0https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/options?p=GME",

        "selftext": "Today, Bloomberg released a report that CCIV (a SPAC) is considering taking Lucid Motors public. \"Blah Blah another EV play, who cares?\" You should. Outside of Tesla, the two legit pure play EV companies with legitimate prospects are Lucid and Rivian. Both private until now. \n\nBy the way, I have over $250k invested in this play:   [https://imgur.com/a/Lyq2lkC](https://imgur.com/a/Lyq2lkC)\n\nand I'm the guy who went from $6k to almost $300k in the last year on SPACs:  \n\n[https://imgur.com/a/c8prUGU](https://imgur.com/a/c8prUGU)\n\nI'd like to say I know this area well.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo why Lucid? Let's start with the CEO Peter Rawlinson. [https://www.lucidmotors.com/company/leadership/peter-rawlinson/](https://www.lucidmotors.com/company/leadership/peter-rawlinson/) Peter was the chief engineer on the Tesla Model S, designing the vehicle from the ground up. He started Lucid because he wanted to \"Make an electric vehicle that would appeal more to the luxury customer that drives a Mercedes or BMW. Tesla's are great, but they aren't beautiful.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSince then, he has designed the Lucid Air. [https://www.lucidmotors.com/air/specs](https://www.lucidmotors.com/air/specs) The Air is a 0 to 60 luxury sedan with a 500 mile battery range. It was named Forbes' electric car of the year, and is viewed as the only true competitor to Elon's lineage of vehicles. The Lucid Air also has state of the art charging capabilities, where you can get a 300 mile range charge in 20 minutes on a DC charging station. Range anxiety, one of the biggest issues for EV drivers, is no longer a problem.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhile the Air is the main selling point (and it comes on market this year), the company is also rolling out \"Project Gravity\", an electric SUV that will hit the market in 2023. While 0 revenue EV companies like Fisker, Nikola, and Canoo have all come to the market with no product for several years, Lucid is planning to IPO with its main vehicle selling this year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhy can we trust the CCIV rumor? Michael Klein, former Citi exec, is the head of Churchill Capital, the group behind this SPAC. While Klein's last SPAC performed poorly (Multiplan, CCXX), and CCX lost the TopGolf merger that it was rumored with, Klein is very experienced in this area. Frankly, he needs a good hit with CCIV, so a company like Lucid would put him back on the map. Given Lucid's lofty valuation (potentially $15B) only two SPACs could realistically handle the deal: PSTH and CCIV. CCIV has a $2B trust account. Additionally, Lucid is majority owned by the Saudi royal family, who Klein has strong ties with.

In a world where Tesla is worth $800B and Nio is $100B, Lucid Motors is poised to take off. They have every incentive to push for this deal to happen as hype will pick up with Lucid deliveries starting. Right now CCIV is trading around $14, and I fully expect it to run to $30+.

        "selftext": "**I've been mainly lurking for a few years and in my opinion, there are currently a few issues regarding this subreddit:**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* too much publicity\n\nWSB was originally a small community of autists wanting to make big gains with smart plays. Today WSB is more like an open discussion board, that's all over the news, and everyone can join and try to make some gains.  It's good to have a decent amount of players here but let's keep the information to ourselves and off the newspapers and CNBC. There is only a limited amount of gains to be made, let's keep the gains to ourselves and the boomers away. Also, what was the point of expanding to Twitter?\n\n* too many new wannabe autists\n\nWSB is on the frontpage of reddit like every other day with memes, and it attracts a lot of new members. Those new members aren't true autists and they clearly have hard time adjusting to our culture. This has caused attacking certain parties that we don't agree with, pump and dump schemes, lots of stupid posts and upvoting them, that nobody would have upvoted 6 months ago and so on. In general this is much more like a meme subreddit now, even when we are approaching the most important earnings week of the year. A good portion of the new members don't even understand the last sentence.\n\n* this isn't WallStreetMemes, this is WallStreetBets\n\nAnyone who's been here longer than 3 months, knows that we used to have much more useful posts or gain/loss porn in the frontpage of WSB, now it's mainly memes. It's fine to have memes here and there but most of them are just low quality karma farming memes and they get old real fast, unlike loss porn. I bet anyone who has been here longer than a year, would like to see people tattooing stupid shit, drinking piss, GUH their wife's boyfriend's savings away, and just see people act like the true autist they are, rather than these boring new memes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**How to fix this?**\n\n1. We had the rule for not allowing posts to be in r/all for like a whole 10 minutes back in the days, and I think we need that back. If someone is a true autist, they will find their way here regardless.\n2. Keep the WSB inside the WSB. No Twitter, no news, no sucking Cramer's dick to get to CNBC. We already have enough autists here to be a big player in financial markets. We don't need SEC to do us what your wife's boyfriend does to your wife.\n3. GME to the moon\n4. WSB needs to be kept under control. True autist never attacks anyone, we just troll people, make tendies and jerk to loss porn. It's pretty simple and if you can't accept it and follow the rules, you deserve to get banned.\n5. Let the new members become true autists, absorb our original culture, and I think WSB can be like it used to be. But if we constantly have a lot of new wannabe autists coming in, they are gonna take this sub over and there's nothing we can do.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\npositions:\n\npronebone, 156 shares of TSLA, 80 shares of GME, lots of leap calls and smaller positions",

        "selftext": "Good morning, and good afternoon, fellow Retards. I haven't had the need to make a post, until now. What a fucking fantastic day we've had in the past couple of days. Now, you've probably caught the itch to make it big with all the talks of a short squeeze, seeing as the topic has ignited with a bunch of fresh blood recently with the extreme media coverage of WSJ, Cramer, and various other media outlets. I've been in GME for about 5 or 6 months, nowhere near as long u/UberKikz11, u/DeepFuckingValue, and u/CptHubbard of course, but for the past 5 months. All I have been doing is watching this stock, reading the news, visiting stores around the state to get updates from local employees, and so much more.   \nWhat I want every single one of you to realize, is this one of the most artificially suppressed stocks on the market. Short sellers have more shares sold short than there are shares in existence for Gamestop. 71.2 MILLION sold short,^(\\[1\\]) versus an entire outstanding (heh nice) 69.75 Million shares outstanding. Now, let's do some number crunching. 19.25%, or \\~13.4m of those shares^(\\[2\\]), are held by insiders. Our faithful Board of directors, including big dog Ryan Cohen with OVER 9000!!!(9,001,000) shares. leaving us with \\~56.35m to play around with. Next stop, Institutional ownership, The big holders. So, of that 56.35m, the top 10 institutional holders hold 43,429,550 ^(\\[3\\]) and the top 10 mutual funds hold 18,746,499 ^(\\[3\\])  Totalling 62,176,049. So now just between the previously listed holders we have. \\*drum rolls\\* 75 Million shares owned by insiders and institutions. WAIT WAIT WAIT HOLD THE PHONE... How is that possible? 75 million shares solely owned by institutions, when there are only 69.75 in existence.  Short sellers. This is where the magnitude of the situation begins. All the shares you are trading right now, all of them that you own, are more than likely a share sold short. So, when the shorts cover their position... well, there just won't fucking be any without you selling their share sold short back to them, because institutions don't like to sell until they see BIG returns. Every single shareholder, whether it is your 1, 100, or 10,000 shares that you own right now, is the key.  YOU HOLD THE POWER! I need every single one of you to have faith through the dips and buy more, you are doing your part just by buying one more share on the dip, even more, when you buy 2 or 3 or 100. The key here is to HOLD YOUR FUCKING SHARES UNTIL SHORTS BLEED THEIR LAST DROP, AND ONLY THEN WILL WE SAY, \"Wait, you can sell these things?\" We are up against some big money here. Big money means they can bleed before covering their positions, but they are a business, they don't want to have big losses, so the covering WILL happen, and that is when we will see our squeeze. We haven't even started retards. Keep up the buying pressure with shares.  Your efforts, and patience, will GREATLY be rewarded.\n\nTL,DR: Shorts fukt, bulls win. Buy SHARES, not calls, and HOLD THE LINE until 420.69 (I have full faith in that sell target) GME TO THE MOON \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\n^(\\[1\\]) [https://shortsqueeze.com/?symbol=gme&amp;submit=Short+Quote%E2%84%A2](https://shortsqueeze.com/?symbol=gme&amp;submit=Short+Quote%E2%84%A2)  \n^(\\[2\\]) [https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/gme/insider-activity](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/gme/insider-activity)   \n^(\\[3\\]) [https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/holders?p=GME](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/holders?p=GME)",

        "selftext": "I\u2019ve seen a lot of discussions about GME over the past week that are missing important bull and bear elements in the thesis. This sub is so incredibly bullish that unsurprisingly, there\u2019s more missing bear arguments than bull, and bearish information is sometimes perceived as bullish (such as the margin requirement increases, which I feel are net-bearish). But there's also missing bull information.\n\nI previously posted about some option dynamics last week, that seem to have played out to an extent. I actually lost money on my puts because the expressed vol was less than I thought, and Friday ended up playing out in a basically neutral way from a bull/bear perspective with a mere 10% drawdown. That post is here. I correct predicted the outcome, but didn\u2019t predict the magnitude well enough and thus my trade sucked:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kxb7dy/analysis\\_of\\_massive\\_potential\\_gme\\_forced\\_selling/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kxb7dy/analysis_of_massive_potential_gme_forced_selling/)\n\nIn this new post, I\u2019ll cover what I know about current option structure (and will update once updated data for Friday comes out), and the implications (TLDR: Mostly, expect vol around multiples of 5 in stock price), as well as other trading dynamic topics that I think are misunderstood or rarely spoken of.\n\nI\u2019m not going to talk about my opinion of the value of the stock or the turn-around plan. I\u2019m actually in what is a modest put position for me at the moment (jan 22 $38 puts x 80), but I fully acknowledge this could go to the moon next week and I'll feel like a miniature Melvin capital (though shorting at $38 is a lot smarter than at $17) and probably deserve it in that case.\n\n**Current Option Structure:**\n\nI will update this as new data gets in, but you can see big concentrations of options at 30, 35, 39/40 and 45. There isn\u2019t open interest data for Friday, but volume suggests there are further ramps at 50/55/60, but they are probably smaller than the 39/40 and 30 ramps. Normally, dealers are going to be long calls (from people selling covered calls) and short puts (From people buying protection). On GME I think we all know it\u2019s short calls and short puts, since people are buying tons of calls from them, and also speculating with puts. As such, dealers are extremely short gamma, and that means that prices accelerate from dealer activity greatly. When the stock sells, the dealers have to dump stock (or short it). When the stock goes up, dealers have to buy.  **I believe that the Wednesday melt-up was as much a short squeeze as a gamma squeeze, as the price moved over a bunch of OTM options, forcing dealers to buy as much as 1/3 of the total float of the company to hedge!**\n\nThese patterns are most sharp at these large concentrations of strike prices, so the stock can jump from 39 to 41 a lot easier than from 36 to 38 as an example. On average, it\u2019s about $1m of stock bought/sold by dealers per percent change. To put in context, there was a jump Friday where about 250k shares got bought and moved the price 5%. That means that if accurate, dealer activity might have been up to half in that flash.   **We don\u2019t yet have the Friday data, but there was a lot of Friday volume. This amplification may be greater next week. This week had a gamma event on Wednesday, after which there were a ton of ITM WSB calls and OOM Melvin puts that don\u2019t have gamma, and thus the price de-volatilized somewhat. But we may now be in a situation with a lot of near the money options, which means we could see very large gamma squeezes up or down again.**\n\nHere\u2019s the structure, I\u2019ll update once there is Friday OI data available. This chart assumes that calls are positive gamma \u2013 they will all be negative gamma in this case, so predict accordingly.\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/czrKy6X](https://imgur.com/a/czrKy6X)\n\nAlso worth mentioning is the expirations next week. Here\u2019s the current structure for next week, using Thursday data, which I\u2019ll update once I get Friday data:\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/4wKTspB](https://imgur.com/a/4wKTspB)\n\nThis is a lot less bearish than the Friday we just had, but again, I\u2019ll update once I get the data. It\u2019s still a net sell on Friday as those option positions get cleared out (people sell to realize, and then buy other things in general), but more like under 1/10th of float vs the 1/3 of float we were staring at this Friday. Unless people piled into ITM calls Friday, which I find highly unlikely. As such, the downwards force this coming Friday, if this Friday was -10%, is more like -2 or -3% in a vacuum.  However, the higher the prices go into Friday, the more selling this in turn causes Friday, so in a world where we end at $55 on Thursday, I'd definitely not go into Friday long as this forced selling increases.\n\nMy sense out of all of this is:\n\n\\- The current gamma structure provides more ramps up than down from $35, but there are strong ramps in either direction. BUT, the volume suggests a lot of new put positions were established. On net \u2013 volatility up, not bearish or bullish.\n\n\\- There is some forced selling this coming Friday, but if that was the driving force yesterday, it would be a -3% or -2% not a -10%.  Slightly bearish.\n\n\\- If the stock moons this week, I would encourage you to approach Friday with care, and a more bearish or defensive mentality, even if fundamentally bullish.\n\n\\- A LOT of capital went into OOM puts and calls this week targeting the week after. If the stock is not volatile, a lot of speculators bleed out on both sides.\n\n**Margin Changes**\n\nThere was a lot of talk about how various brokerages have increased margin requirements on GME stock. Some set to 100% (Schwab), others set up a bit (TDA from 70% to 75%),  others rumored to be planning but haven\u2019t (IBKR). The reaction of the sub is that this is bullish. It\u2019s actually bearish.\n\nThe reason is that most of the shorts, in my opinion, are institutional. Retail will typically short with OOM puts which don\u2019t cause much actual selling to hedge. Institutions short GME are going to have that in a giant account with a ton of other assets, so changes on margin placed on them, if indeed that happened, wont margin call them except in scenarios where GME goes up 20x in a day or something.\n\nOn the other hand, if you are a retail trader where half or all of your positions are GME, this margin change does effect you, especially if you were out on margin, and it makes it harder to buy more shares. I don\u2019t think many retail traders are directly short the stock.  Anyone want to raise their hand and admit they are 50%+ GME and on margin to do it?\n\nAlso, consider the context -retail brokerages just did this on the back of everyone here buying shares long. That to me suggests they are looking at customer accounts, seeing some over-extension, worrying about it, and setting the rule to prevent themselves being burned. Some of you have a net worth of mostly GME in your levered account. If that gets squeezed down and a liquidation is forced those brokerages won\u2019t be seeing the money.\n\nSo, I think the margin changes are bearish. I would also urge you bulls to not set yourself up to be squeezed, which is my next point.\n\n**Squeezes and Short Interest**\n\nIt\u2019s true that this stock has high short interest. There\u2019s contradictory evidence as to if the shorts went up this week or went down. IBKR share availability suggests it may have went down, other sources suggest up, and I'll update once we have solid post-Friday data that someone posts. However, just because the short interest is high, doesn\u2019t mean that it can be squeezed easily from here \u2013 Wednesday I think was that squeeze. A lot of the old shorts may have covered then, and we may be looking at new shorts.\n\nAdditionally, while GME longs here on stock are not squeezable if not on margin, those of you on OOM call options ARE squeezable, and those of you on ITM options are in a sense even more squeezable. OOM call options decay if the stock doesn\u2019t go up, and then the shares dealers bought to hedge the call they sold you get sold back into the pool. ITM options, when sold, do the same but more powerfully \u2013 selling a very ITM call option on GME means a dealer immediately goes out and dumps 100 shares of GME on the market. If you in turn buy 100 shares, it\u2019s netural, or if you buy a bunch of NTM calls, you might even cause a net buy. But, those will tend to cause selling if people take money off the table and as time goes on.\n\nAnd yes, there are a TON of new put options, and those get squeezed out too.\n\nSo there is a dual squeeze potential here \u2013 shorts vs their losses and borrow fees and decaying option positions which cause dealer buying, and longs using margin and longs in call options fighting time and also watching dealers dump their hedged longs.\n\n**Yield Enhancement Program**\n\nA pro tip I have for this sub is \u2013 if you intend to hold a ton of long stock that is in high demand by short sellers, you should get paid to lend it to short sellers. That\u2019s how the option dealers make a lot of their money \u2013 I\u2019m sure citadel is making a killing holding a ton of GME stock to hedge, and promptly lending it to hedge funds at 30% borrow rate, while having very little risk.\n\nMost brokerages don\u2019t pay you for lending your shares out, but IBKR does. Right now, if your GME shares are loaned out, you get something like 15% annualized in rebates. This doesn\u2019t work if the shares are in margin, they have be fully paid and settled, but it is a substantial extra if you are a long-term believer in the stock, and on other brokerages, they get paid instead of you.  If any other brokerages have this feature that are non-institutional, please post and I\u2019ll add.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nI think the major factor here remains simply the desire of this sub to pile new money in. However, it\u2019s hard to maintain these prices for more than a few weeks without additional catalysts because options are getting pricey and decay will set in, and the transformation plan Cohen has laid out will take time to do and thus present it\u2019s own catalysts that would powerfully attract a institutional investors on the sidelines.\n\nIn terms of other factors:\n\n\\- The margin changes, again, are definitely bearish. How bearish? That depends on how many of you guys bought a ton of GME shares on margin and whether or not we gap down Tuesday. I don't think it affects the short interest much.\n\n\\- The option situation is probably net bullish Tuesday/Wednesday/Thursday, but net bearish Friday (slightly)\u2026 but does mean that next week can be insanely volatile\n\n\\- Price moves are easier in the vicinity of $35, $30, $39, $40, and to a lesser extent, $45, $50, $55, $60 due to gamma 'ramps'.\n\n\\- I\u2019ll post new data when I get it",

        "selftext": "Fellow retarded guys and gals, I am CONVINCED GME will hit higher highs and the circuit breaker will keep halting the stock\u2019s upward movement next week (this is a good thing people, calm the FUCK down when it happens). I am seriously considering throwing my ROTH into this. We\u2019re talking a LOT of money. I\u2019m not a whale, god no, but I want to yeet this cash and see if it can double or triple in the next week. \n\nWhat GME shorters and my actual retard brother and everyone else is failing to understand is, we certified smooth brains on this sub can see GameStop\u2019s FUTURE potential. We already knew GameStop was a \u201cdying company\u201d but fuck, we held the goddamn line and now some of you can afford a full meal at Wendy\u2019s, and not just some fries. GameStop is due for a massive transformation, and we see it. Boomers clearly don\u2019t, the Gay Lemon did not, but we hold and buy SHARES because we understand that this isn\u2019t a bet on the past but faith in the future of the company. \n\nI have been in this army since the price hit $36.00.

Shit, I feel in my jellies it\u2019ll hit $120-$130 by EOW next week. \n\nSo \ud83d\udc8e\ud83e\udd1a bulls, is it time to YEET the Roth IRA all into GME, and if so, when should I buy in to help the cause?

Our culture is now the culture of the entire finance industry. Our memes are now viral across every social platform. Our shitty DD now moves entire markets.\n\nThe world is already talking about us, but it is time for us to have a voice and talk back. Moving forward, the moderators will be managing the Twitter account [@wsbmod](https://twitter.com/wsbmod) as our main form of communication with the outside world. This account will be used to coordinate AMAs and other interactions with important people, share dank memes while giving due credit to our creators here, and generally shitposting to the best of our abilities. Not to mention being able to reply to Shitron's tweets.\n\ntl;dr [@wsbmod](https://twitter.com/wsbmod) is the only official Twitter account of the sub and we need your help to ensure our voice is heard loud and far.\n\nThank you.",

        "selftext": "Long-time lurker here, finally starting to post with the imminent GME squeeze, **TL;DR at the bottom**\n\nThought it would be helpful to give a VERY BRIEF, slightly more serious explanation on the current situation to the influx of new members:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBefore we start, here's a nice little glossary of autistic terms used around here:\n\n\ud83d\ude80  = stock gonna go up\n\n\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc50 = holding onto a stock like a god\n\n\ud83d\udcdd\ud83d\udc50 = selling like a loser\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, currently Gamestop (GME) is on a pretty inevitable short-squeeze path, what does that mean? It means it's about to do something like this:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[fuckin ridiculous am i right, a more recent example would be tesla \\(TSLA\\) if you think this is old boomer shit](https://i.redd.it/frjx9fil1qb61.gif)\n\nNow the mechanics of it why short squeezes happen are a little complicated for beginners but here are some threads and other links explaining them IF you want to learn more:\n\n[WSB Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kwb827/gme_endgame_dtc_infinity/)\n\n[Video explanation if you can't read like many of the autists here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMRyWZ6CXqM)\n\n[Boring Boomer website explanation](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortsqueeze.asp)\n\nThere also a lot of other factors at play here, but go search that on your own, there's tons of good threads here on WSB\n\nAND if you're really serious about it, ACTUALLY RESEARCH GAMESTOP, its annual revenue, market cap, stocks in general, but lmao none of y'all gonna do that so:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo should you buy GME stock asap?\n\nDo you like free money? Fuck yeah buy that shit \ud83d\udcb8\ud83d\udcb8\ud83d\udcb8\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHOWEVER here are some VERY IMPORTANT things you should be mindful of in these upcoming weeks:\n\n* The very tippy top of Short-squeezes last fairly long, in the picture above (Volkswagen) it shot up and stayed there for a whole day (at around $600, it did spike at a crazy $1000 for a couple hours though), SLOWLY coming back down over a few days, then finally dropping. THIS MEANS this isn't some minute-by-minute play here, you have some time, just make sure you are prepared.\n* In these coming days (or maybe weeks) GME price will waver up and down as the big corporations (Melvin \ud83d\udc7f) start trying to cover their asses until eventually it will start spiking like crazy, the Short-squeeze will have started\n* Some shit might go down this TUESDAY, it might not, but some shit will ***definitely*** go down within the next week or so as corporations are losing big amounts of money as time goes by\n* THE LONGER PEOPLE HOLD \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc50 ONTO THEIR STOCKS, THE HIGHER CORPS LIKE MELVIN WILL HAVE TO PAY FOR THEM, this brings me to my next and final point\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# The importance of holding \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc50\n\nThe price of GME will most likely STAIRCASE upwards (going UP then down then UP, etc), as corps begin to short, people with \ud83d\udcdd\ud83d\udc50 (pussies) will begin to sell because of the \"profit\" they're making\n\nNot only will you regret it when the squeeze hits its peak, but you are letting the shorters get off easy by giving them cheap stocks\n\nImagine this:\n\nyou bought GME at $35, it goes up to $100, you panic sell cuz holy shit thats profit, you check again in an hour and see that GME is now $200 because of the many godlike \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc50 we have in this sub, then you start crying because not only did you hurt the cause, you missed out on a shit ton more money\n\n***This is the importance of holding \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc50***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso if you read the DD (basically theory on future prospects) on Gamestop, you'll realize that it actually does have a pretty bright future, so while this may be a pump and dump for many, I'm sure this stock will actually reach quite a large number in the not so distant future (just google Ryan Cohen)\n\nMy current estimation for the price target is:\n\nIt will ***definitely*** hit $100 within the next week\n\nIt will probably spike to around $200-$300 for a day or two\n\nIt has a small chance of going fucking nuclear and going past $300   \ud83d\ude80   \ud83d\ude80   \ud83d\ude80  (small chance but definitely possible)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, I didn't want to speak boomer but this is important as this subreddit is quite literally an addiction for a lot of people, DON'T PUT MONEY IN THIS STOCK IF YOU'RE NOT COMFORTABLE, WE'RE LITERALLY A BUNCH OF RETARDS (sometimes smart retards)\n\nTHIS IS NOT FINANACIAL ADVICE AND IF YOU LISTEN TO ME OR ANYONE ELSE ON THIS SUBREDDIT YOU ARE ALSO RETARDED LIKE ALL OF US\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# TL;DR: THE MORE OF US THAT HOLD \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc50 THE HIGHER GME WILL  \ud83d\ude80  \ud83d\ude80  \ud83d\ude80  \ud83d\ude80  \ud83d\ude80  \ud83d\ude80  \ud83d\ude80  \ud83d\ude80\n\n# DO NOT WAVER, HOLD\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc50 AND YOU WILL BE REWARDED, SELL\ud83d\udcdd\ud83d\udc50 AND YOU'LL FOREVER GET LAUGHED AT BY EVERYONE HERE LMAO\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nthank you for coming to my ted talk",

(BlackBerry is in both). BlackBerry\u2019s market cap is only at 7 billion, yes only 7 billion...it should be at 100 billion, because stocks are supposed to be investments for future earnings...100 billion market cap would put BlackBerry at a share price of $180 US ...crowdstrike which earns the same amount as BlackBerry is at a 50 billion market cap, and if you evaluate the vehicle side of BlackBerry and Amazon partnership to be 50 billion dollars additional market cap (I believe it\u2019s worth more) then you have 50 + 50 = 100 billion market cap evaluation",

        "selftext": "Good afternoon\n\nThe current market has some obvious similarities with the internet bubble in the 2000s at the moment:\n\n1) Sectoral bubble\n\nElectric Vehicle stocks, Renewable energy stocks, crypto and possibly even fintech stocks have skyrocketed to insane levels in 2020. A PE ratio of 100-200 for stocks in these sectors is considered \"cheap\" right now, that's what \"investors\" before the dotcom crash thought aswell.\n\n2) Historic low interest rates\n\nThis is the biggest catalyst for the creation of an insane bubble, very low interest rates. Just like in the 2000s, we currently have historic low interest rates, which makes stocks the only game in town. The big myth here is that people think stocks only go up, with interest rates close to 0. That's absolutely not true and that's the scary part in my opinion, because even professionals and analysts think that. The market doesn't stay disconnected from the economy forever.\n\n3) IPO mania and speculation\n\nWe haven't seen more IPO's in 2020 since the dotcom bubble. This on itself isn't a big deal, but the valuations these IPO's get are beyond insanity. Any company that gets linked to EV in some way, automatically gets a 100%+ boost to their stock price, without even having a product or sales number. 1999 all over again?\n\n4) \"New paradigm\"\n\nLet's be honest, at least 80% of the people in any financial subreddit (excluding WSB, +-99% there) thinks that Tesla is the new paradigm that will take over the world. Trust me, it is not. I've been doing some math on Tesla valuation, and I have no fitting word for its current valuation. I won't go in the details why, because I could write a whole book about this. I still firmly believe that growing positive cashflows should be the main catalyst of a stock that goes up, and a company with a negative cashflow (THAT ONLY GROWS AT A 25% RATE) shouldn't get a 1t valuation, that's too disrespectful for companies such as Google, Microsoft, Amazon and Apple. \n\n6) Greed and FOMO\n\nEveryone wants to jump on this train, no one wants to miss out, but I can assure you, these valuations are absurd and those who can't get out early enough, will be left holding the (empty) bag.\n\nKind regards and stay safe (physically and financially)",

        "selftext": "Hi all, it's your friendly neighborhood fellow retard, u/fieryskyes.\n\nLooking to open up a discussion thread about today's GME Short Data. I'm attaching an image from ORTEX after today's beautiful share price action. You bet that GME will be making news rounds all over the world after today, over the weekend. We're only getting started. If any of you have read my MOASS price target post from around a week or so ago, you would know that I kept on hammering the term 'zero point'. It just means it's the starting point (whether it's your portfolio value, or the share price, or both) prior to a face-ripping MOASS. Well, if you've held on to GME the entire time since that post, congratulations. Your zero point has just grown a substantial amount after today's close @ +51.08% (as per Yahoo! Finance). That's just today's gain. It's some fucking tendie-town shit.\n\nAll the mathematical power and beauty of consecutive-day compounding interest is now to GME LONGS' advantage. The inverse is true for shorts: they're getting seriously fucked by many things; face-ripping, ass-gaping, wife-fucking compounding interest only one among them. (Also, RIP to Citron Research AKA. Andrew \"Left for Dead\" Shitron.)\n\nI don't claim to be an expert on GME short metrics &amp; data, and so I leave it to the experts to hopefully analyze what I'm attaching here, hence a discussion thread. *AKA. WHAT DO THESE CRAYONS ON THE SCREEN MEAN, DADDY?* \n\nHowever: based off off what I see on the data attached, it looks like shorts have started to unwind their positions, albeit slightly, relative to the entire short position. Again remember, on WSB, we take into account TRADEABLE % of FLOAT, where, according to some DDs posted in the sub, is estimated to be running at around 200%+.\n\nAll said, I think we have a ways to go before all the shorts are fully covered e.g. more tendies to come. Focus, get ready, and have a plan. This could be *THE* trade of your lifetime.\n\n*Processing img xquiruns9yc61...*\n\n**GME SHORT DATA, ORTEX, 1/22/21.**   \n **-Exchange Reported Short Interest:**   \n Last: 71.20M   \n Previous: 68.13M   \n % Change: +4.50%\n\n**-% Freefloat on Loan:**  \n Current: 102.29%  \n 7 days ago: 115.45%  \n % Change: -11.40%  \n   \n **-Shares on loan:**  \n Current: 48M  \n 5 days ago: 54.17M  \n % change: -11.40%  \n   \n **-Days to Cover (On loan):**  \n Current: 3.06  \n 7 days ago: 4.03  \n %Change: -24.24%  \n   \n **-Cost to Borrow:**  \n Current: 23.94%  \n 7 days ago: 23.93%  \n %Change: 0.01%  \n   \n **-Utilization:**  \n Current: 100  \n 7 days ago: 100  \n %Change: 0\n\n**TL;DR: Short data as per ORTEX is attached.

        "selftext": "Hi everyone.  Long time WSB lurker and I've learned a lot here, so I'd like to give back and hopefully add some value to this sub.  I think it\u2019s worth spending a little time laying out my thoughts on why I\u2019m investing in GME as an active early stage VC, and hopefully my insights can help people not paperhand before the real gains are made.  I'll try to provide new insights that I haven't seen on this subreddit yet.\n\nFull disclaimer- this is my personal money I\u2019m investing.  Positions are 678 shares at a $39.81 average as a starter and looking to open a more significant position in the next few months once a few questions have been answered for me on things I\u2019m looking to see (which I\u2019ll discuss below).\n\nObligatory rockets: \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80.  If a few things happen, this goes to the moon regardless of a short squeeze.  I'll explain why below.\n\nFirst, a quick overview at how most VC's do due diligence.\n\n**How VC's Invest**\n\nWhen we do due diligence on early stage investments (our Fund is a pre-seed and seed Fund with a few Series A deals), there\u2019s a few things we look for, especially when evaluating growth companies in tech are as follows:\n\n1) What\u2019s the market size? There are three types of market sizes investors look at; TAM, SAM and SOM.   Feel free to look up how sizing these markets works if you aren't familiar, this is a long post so I won't waste people's time.  The important thing to remember here is that **the larger the TAM, the more room for growth and competition and the more interest there is to invest in a space.**  This is very important for GME and we will come back to why later.\n\n2) What's the CAGR?  (Compound Annual Growth Rate).  Basically, is the market expanding or shrinking, and how fast.  Again, google this if not familiar.\n\n3) Experience of the management team- have they actually been there before and demonstrated an ability to scale and exit a company in this space?\n\n4) Unit economics- do the numbers make sense as this company grows?  Is it actually going to be profitable?  Every firm looks at these different.  We look at CAC/LTV ratios and doubling time with tech companies.  The TLDR of this is \"how much money does it cost me to get a new customer, how long will they be my customer before they leave, how much money will they spend while they are my customer, and how fast can I double the money I spent on advertising to get that new customer \".\n\nThere are a lot more things that obviously go into determining whether something is a good investment or not, but if there are red flags in any of these core areas a tech company is almost always uninvestable.\n\n**Now onto why after recent developments I think GME is shaping up to be one of the most attractive investment opportunities that investors have seen in these markets in years, but why many of you will miss out on the majority of the gains long term.**\n\n1 and 2) Market size and CAGR.  As a gamer myself in spare time and a tech investor this is a market that hasn't even scratched the surface of how large it will get.  Gaming is a market worth hundreds of billions, with an explosive CAGR as more young people grow up with gaming being a socially accepted activity and in many people's lives the center of their social experience.   Most of you are familiar with this already, so nothing more to be said here.  \n\nNow the question in the past was, is Gamestop capable of growing their share of this market?  Until Ryan Cohen, the answer was no (and this is why the share price went down to where it was).  Again, you all know this.  But this leads to the second point of why it is now an attractive option\n\n2) Ryan Cohen.  Not from an \"excited about a memeing CEO\" perspective, but from the most important thing to institutional investors- does he have a proven track record scaling and exiting profitable e-commerce businesses?  Yes he does.  \n\nAgain, you all know all this and it is how the stock price got to here today.  Everyone is sitting waiting and watching to see if there is a short squeeze (myself included), and there is a lot of hype and excitement.\n\n**But this is leading everyone to miss the forest for the trees because of the 4th point:**\n\nGME's Unit Economics have the potential to be best in industry, yet shares are priced at an extreme discount to revenues currently.\n\nI'd encourage everyone to check out this article talking about how companies with strong growth are normally priced by tech investors by one of the A16z partner.  [https://a16z.com/2020/08/17/role-of-entry-multiples-in-valuations/](https://a16z.com/2020/08/17/role-of-entry-multiples-in-valuations/)  The article is titled \"why entry multiples don't matter\" and helps entrepreneurs understand how valuations of companies can make sense for tech investors.\n\nThe short of it is for all the WSBers who can't read: if you have more growth, you get a higher multiple because you will have the potential to produce far more dividends faster, especially in high margin tech companies.\n\nSo what is fascinating about GME?\n\n**If I was presented a new company that had just driven it's e-commerce revenues 300%!!!!! YoY, operating in a several hundred billion TAM, backed by investors and management who had grown a company in the same vertical to hundreds of millions in annual subscription revenue, and with a strong balance sheet and distribution footprint and a widely recognized brand, 20x topline revenue in the early stages would be considered a steal to invest at.** \n\nInstead, GME is priced at a $2.8B market cap, less than half of annual revenues.\n\nThis is an unheard of valuation for a growth company to be trading at a discount.\n\nSo why is GME underpriced, and why did so many people (myself included) not see or continue to not see this opportunity until now?  If it's such a good opportunity, why are shares so cheap?\n\n**Most investors are looking at the legacy Gamestop business that has existed for the past decade instead of treating GME like a new startup (CHEWY for Gaming).**\n\nIf Ryan Cohen can transform GME into a subscription-based membership model where in exchange for your monthly fee you have a one stop shop to all things gaming discounted, you have a company that could easily be valued at a 10-30x multiple on top-line revenues.  However, because most investors outside of this subreddit still view it as a traditional brick and mortar play vs. a subscription focused tech company with omnichannel growth strategies, they think a bubble is forming and are shorting it instead of buying in.\n\n**So why am I not all in yet but why am I excited?**\n\nThe most important thing yet to be understood is what does the customer value proposition look like under the new direction Ryan Cohen takes GME.  Most large investors will be waiting to see how over the next year the balance sheet is strengthened for growth, what new revenue models can be implemented, and to see if there has been a true pivot from brick and mortar.\n\nThis is a company that if management can execute on correctly, most large institutional investors will be clamoring to get a significant stake in and grow it because the gaming market is here to stay and grow.  Bear arguments that digital game sales will hurt GME miss the entire point of the pivot.  Ryan understands this and wants to instead bring the whole gaming experience in house- everything you buy you want to buy from GME because you're part of their membership program (again think Costco).  Those programs are insanely profitable and if the unit economics show that to investors as the company pivots the valuation will soar immediately as people realize it's Amazon Prime, not Blockbuster.  However, it is yet to be seen if they can execute on this vision, which is why I am not all in yet.\n\nThere is still long term risk which is why this stock is still low.  Not a lot but there is some.\n\nMaybe the company doesn't grow?  Maybe they reject Ryan's vision?\n\nBut here's the bottom line.\n\nIf a shift to digital first does occur, and GME becomes a subscription first omnichannel gaming company, the market cap will conservatively be 10x topline revenues.\n\nLet's say that stays flat next year at $5B.  \n\nThis market cap (matching industry standards) **should for an appropriate valuation for a growth stock be $50B.** \n\nI know this sounds insane.  But if Ryan can complete the transformation he is hoping for this is a very conservative valuation.\n\nA $50B market cap would be $800 a share right now.  Again, this assumes Zero topline revenue growth.  If revenue begins to grow again 10x will be unrealistic and the multiples will get far higher.\n\nThis is why the short squeeze is distracting many.  **In 5 years if you diamond hands this company, the fair value of shares can range from $800-$2400 and not be in any sort of bubble or unjustified by fundamentals speculation.**\n\nTLDR; this company if Ryan does what we believe he will may be one of the most undervalued companies this subreddit has ever discovered.  Even if you take profits in a short squeeze, don't forget to keep shares for a long position because opportunities like this rarely come around.  I imagine the short squeeze will allow them to issue more shares to  strengthen the balance sheet, and the company has a fantastic launch pad to start from with the size of it's existing customer base, brand awareness, and revenue. If it becomes clear that GME will be executing on Ryan's vision even at a $10B market cap this will be a steal and I will open a full position then.  I am waiting to expand my position to see what happens with the pivot, as this all goes out the window if GME rejects his strategy.\n\nAs always, due your own DD but I have learned a lot about options from this sub and hopefully this helps a few people understand why selling shares may end up being the biggest regret of their life.  **GME's business model has the potential to look just like Amazon's with a focus on the gaming industry and these shares are only at this price because the market is still looking at the old company and not the new startup that GME could become.**\n\n**Don't paper hand this one.**",

You know why?\n\nBecause what\u2019s the one thing Google, Apple, and TSLA have in common? They\u2019re actually in the fucking auto business.\n\nYou think Mercedes or Toyota wants to cede even more profit in the auto business to competitors by adopting their OS and giving them a boost? Do you know how cutthroat and ruthless the corporate world is?\n\nLet me demonstrate with the ol\u2019 lemonade stand analogy. Let\u2019s say you setup a lemonade stand outside your house and all the kids are going nuts for your lemonade. Next thing you know, Jimmy from next door opens a lemonade stand, and throws in a Jolly Rancher inside each lemonade he makes. You\u2019re fucked. Jimmy just took your business, your friends, your girl and her bf.\n\nYou need to level the playing field by adding Jolly Ranchers to your lemonade... so how will you do this? Are you gonna go up to Jimmy\u2019s stand and straight up buy Jolly Ranchers from your mortal enemy? Is that what a smooth brained person would do?\n\nNO, you would walk your ass down the street to a neutral third party convenient store, buy fucking Jolly Ranchers from them, and while you\u2019re at it, buy some cough syrup and add that as well to your lemonade. Because fuck Jimmy, that\u2019s why.\n\nSpeaking of lemonade...\n\n\u201cwHat iF ShiTrOn TaKeS a ShIT oN BB?\u201d\n\nAndrew Left although the gayest bear of them all, actually saw BB potential years ago calling it the next NVDA. He was early on that call, but he was right.\n\nBack to the lemonade moat:\n\nListen retards, Blackberry is not a competitor to any auto maker the same way Apple, Google, and TSLA are. You think auto makers are going to use their competitors OS? Or you think these non techy auto dinosaurs like Mercedes and Toyota are gonna reinvent the wheel and create their own OS. Fuck no. Don\u2019t be so rough brained and fall for that gay bear \u201cDD\u201d\n\nBlackBerry is a third party corporation that all auto makers can form an auto cartel around with Papa Chen as the cartel lord. A couple automakers MIGHT create their own OS because they\u2019re a fucking tech company to begin with, and they have the scale and reach to do so, but don\u2019t think for A FUCKING SECOND their competitors are gonna just line up to use it and cede more their profits to them. These other Auto OS (if made) will be specific and unique to that companies own car. Think. Use that smooth brain.\n\nBlackberry has effectively become the gate keeper of the Auto Data Market.\n\nAlso this is a tough fucking market. Cars are one of the most data rich endpoints in the world that need securing. This isn\u2019t like a laptop, you click the wrong link, and next thing you know you have a million Hentai pop ups. The car is more serious. You click the wrong link; and you\u2019re dead.\n\nAre you getting the picture now? Do you see why Cylance was bought? Do you see why BlackBerry\u2019s moat is so secure?\n\nCylance has just been integrated into QNX and was shown off at CES. How many of you missed that fine detail?\n\nNot only does QNX now act as the gatekeeper of all auto data, it fucking protects the super sensitive endpoints using AI driven cyber protection that gets better and better the more the data grows, which it will, exponentially.\n\nAutomakers are lined up like school boys on Easter Sunday ready for deliverance from Papa Chen as he blesses them with QNX.\n\nRemember when Chen said: \u201cwhen better days come, we\u2019ll be ready to execute\u201d\n\nBetter days are here. This is what he was talking about. They\u2019ve positioned and prepared themselves for 10 years to become the Auto Data Gatekeeper once the technology was ready. The foresight on Papa Chen... Absolute Genius.\u201d\n\nCredits fo the DD: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l37ktg/bb_weekend_due_diligence_confirmation_bias/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf",

        "selftext": "I'm seeing a-lot of comparisons going on to the bubble in 1999 with the crazy valuations going on.  Furthermore, I see the same things like 08-09 was the last time we had a serious correction and increasing Covid cases with the weakening dollar could be the catalyst blah blah blah.  Who the hell cares?  This fear mongering of what might happen tomorrow is some shit i'm tryna leave behind in 2020.  The bigger picture here is that our very landscape has changed in the last 2 decades and we have to stop being scared of change and fear of a correction.  Can it happen?  Sure, in fact it probably should happen but will that change anything in the long term?  No.  Here's a few differences between our very economy now versus what it was like 10-20 years ago...\n\nWe live in a day and age where more people have access to investing in our history with zero commission trading fees and apps like robinhood, acorns, or betterment that appeal appeal to the beginner investor.  The result is that the younger and younger generations are becoming more involved in the investment sector of the economy.  Coupled with the fact that a large part of these young investors Millenials and Gen Z, do not own a home and/or live with their parents they have more freedom to put their disposable income into the market.  What's interesting is that millennials are actually one of the most cynical generations towards the stock market mostly because we have lived through two major recessions in recent times and have a large distrust placed in large financial institutions.  This seems to have fundamentally changed proportion of americans who are benefitting from the stock markets bull run from an individual standpoint.  However, with the rise of 401(k) benefits offered by employers and expansion of these plans, millennials are shifting more disposable income towards these options as opposed to self directed or individual plans which tells a different story.\n\nWe live in a day and age where new financial instruments and investing options are dominating the market popularity.  The historic rise of ETFs approx +6,000 since 2009 have ushered in a new era of low cost diversification for the average investor.  Employers are increasing 401(k) benefits and company match policies allowing for large capital accumulation among younger investors who are reaping the benefits.  The rise of cryptocurrency has brought in an entirely new method to invest in the future which is particularly attractive to the younger generations who have lived through the technology era and have seen what investments in the future can look like.\n\nWe live in a day and age where we are exchanging information at the blink of an eye with a simple google search.  Trend identification and data analysis in this day and age is easily accessible and a powerful tool to the average investor.  Things such as cloud computing, AI, Genomics, blockchain, green/renewable energy are changing the foundation of our future and these ideas aren't going away anytime soon.  Access to social media, blogs, investment forums have never been easier and will continue to advance our general education and understanding.\n\nWho knows what the next 10, 20, or even 50 years will bring?  I don't know but i'm certain that **change is here to stay** so stop worrying and embrace the unknown.\n\nWhile I do agree with you in the fact that some of these company valuations are insane and this bull market cannot be seen as sustainable in the short run I think it's important to weigh those concerns with the macroeconomic factors that have changed the investment landscape in the last 10-20 years.  You should have a healthy dose of skepticism otherwise you will be caught off guard but you should also take into account the investing world is evolving and traditional metrics and guidelines in which investors have traditionally based their investment decisions on needs to adapt with it.  What remains true is that not all great things can last forever and a healthy correction is brewing in the future and trying to time it is, and always will be, the worst mistake you can make.  DCA into your positions has and always will be no matter what the best way to invest.\n\nWho knows what the investment landscape will look like in 10-50 years?  Creative destruction in our world knows no bounds and we are constantly advancing toward it.  Change is brought on by optimism and in a 2020 lacking that - heres to a forward looking future built on the backs of bulls!",

        "selftext": "Congrats you degenerates, you finally beat The Man and you're swimming in tendies. This was a fun ride and it's probably not over yet, but I'm hopping off the train with over a million dollar gain. \n\nHere's the fun part - while I never thought I'd make this much on the trade, when I entered it I promised my Maker I'd give 20% of whatever gains I had to charity and folks affected by the pandemic. I thought maybe it would be $10k or maybe $20k - who knows, $50k if shit got wild. \n\nSo far, post taxes it's around $150k. Wow. We researched charities in our area and I found one that focuses on preventing evictions and helping kids in crisis. We called them this week to tell them what we plan to drop by next week and they were shocked. It costs a lot less to keep a family in their current home than to find them a new one, and in a lot of places, the average eviction is over less than a thousand bucks. They estimate this will keep 100 families in their homes - the majority of whom have kids under 5.\n\nI don't want give up privacy or too many details here and you can ban me for that if you want ( you can see I mentioned this plan in an earlier comment a few weeks ago) , but there are a ton of eyes on this sub and this community right now - let's show the world that we're not the 'dumb money' and we do good when we do well.\n\nI encourage everyone who made bank on this to make a donation to a local charity as there's a lot of need right now.",

        "selftext": "Well guys, I lost 90k today on SPY calls which was basically all of my account. I started in 2017 with like 30k of my own money and over the course of 3 years, spent probably a couple hundred hours learning about stocks, options, doing \"research\" etc. Today, I am down 8k since i started in 2017.\nThat was money I planned on using for a downpayment on a house, and for paying my taxes on gains from last year. So once February comes around, the 20k I have left is basically going to taxes on gains from last year which are now gone. I am effectively broke :-)\nIm not that upset because I have a decent paying job.. but god damn, I was literally just contacting real estate agents last week because I was planning on buying a house. I could still buy one, but it will probably take me years to get back to 100k in savings.\nI should have just stuck to selling puts like I was doing for the past couple months. The gains aren't huge, but selling 100k worth of puts every week is enough to make you a couple G's every month with not a ton of risk. I could have made my future mortgage payments just selling puts.\nI am trying to look on the bright side. Having 100k made me spend somewhat frivolously. Like eating out twice a day, buying clothes i didn't need, etc. Now I have to go back to scrimping and scraping, which is good I think. I was getting a little ridiculous.\nAlso, I have been finishing up my degree online but have had no motivation since I already have a decent job and decent money saved. Im feeling the pressure now to hurry up and finish my degree so I can get a better job (100k+ a year).\nI went all in on $390 1/22 SPY calls yesterday. I did the math; if we would have had a 1.5% day today, I would have made about 500k.. but it was pretty flat so at open, I was already down a shit ton. Figuring there was no chance left, I pulled out what was left, about 47k. I saw ford was going up crazy and figured that was pretty much my only chance to get back to where I was. Basically bought calls expiring tomorrow at the top, started going down, I pushed out and sold. So now I have 20k.\nI'm not super depressed about it or anything because I know ill be fine, but I already miss the coziness of having 100k stored away. Knowing that if I lost my job or something, id be okay. But like I said, Im looking on the bright side.\nMy goal at the moment is to just save as much money as possible, pay my taxes in February, and then start over.\nNot even gonna lie, if I didn't need the 20k to pay taxes on last years gains, Id probably yolo it into something crazy. It's better to feel like this than nothing at all. Kinda fucked but whatever man, life is just boring.",

        "selftext": " I don't get what you guys are worried about with PLTR.\n\nHere's my **personal** DD on PLTR, you're welcome to read and do whatever you want. Other helpful info or pointing out mistakes in my DD is very welcome.\n\nFears preventing you from buying PLTR\n\n1. Targeted ads on your phone from Yahoo Finance or Zacks telling you PLTR = BAD!!!1!eleven\n2. Shills spamming \"pLtR tO tHe MoOn\" and :rocket: on PLTR thread comments.\n3. Last quarter's seemingly bad financials/earnings.\n4. Financials Moving Forwards\n5. Soros who owns 21 million shares \"threatening\" to sell his shares upon DPO expiry.\n6. DPO expiry 3 days after February's earnings and possible insiders and DPO holders sale and dip.\n7. What does PLTR tldr.\n8. Other Information\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***#1 Targeted Ads***\n\nAds and articles are both paid for by someone.The fact that in the past 3 weeks i've been getting multiple multiple targeted ads on my phone related to PLTR since i love PLTR so much.\n\nAds are telling me that PLTR is bad, doesn't provide a dividend, they're telling me PLTR's fair price is 20 instead of 25 based on some financial model and have gone as far as to provide a list of alternative stocks to buy.\n\nTo me, this all screams: **SCARE TACTICS**\n\nAdditionally, the last few weeks of ups and downs in PLTR's stock price is another indication of the attempts to short the stock to sh!t and drive investors out. (For what reason? I don't know.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***#2 Shilling PLTR***\n\nI myself love to shill PLTR to people whenever i can. I do this because i legitimately think this company will do great. I work as a product manager in a software development house and understand what PLTR does. PLTR is not cryptic.Regardless, i think when people shill PLTR to you, they are right to do so as you're probably missing out on a great opportunity to make money in the long run. If you're looking for big gains short term, maybe try something else.\n\nShillery is OK, but at least give the facts.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***#3 Last Quarter's Bad Financials***\n\nIf you'd done your DD not by searching reddit posts but by checking PLTR's actual quarterly report, you'd know that PLTR's \"bad\" last financial quarter/earnings were due to the costs of listing themselves on the *New York Stock Exchange*.\\~855million were spent on listing and stock related compensations and this is the big reason.\n\n**Direct quote by PLTR here:** [https://investors.palantir.com/news-details/2020/Palantir-Reports-Revenue-Growth-of-52-in-the-Third-Quarter-Raises-Full-Year-2020-Guidance/default.aspx](https://investors.palantir.com/news-details/2020/Palantir-Reports-Revenue-Growth-of-52-in-the-Third-Quarter-Raises-Full-Year-2020-Guidance/default.aspx)\n\n&gt;We incurred a loss from operations of $847.8 million, which includes $847.0 million in stock-based compensation following our recent direct listing.\n\nI would like to remind everyone that this is a **1 TIME THING.** Put simply, this means that PLTR won't have as excessive losses next quarter as they did this last quarter.\n\n*Additionally*, let me go into further detail on this and not just leave it to that.\n\n* ***PLTR's quarterly operating expenses for the past 3 quarters were at around \\~260 million.***\n* ***PLTR's operating expenses this quarter were \\~987 million.***\n\nADDITIONALLY...\n\nPLTR also had a higher R&amp;D cost this quarter that just passed. Normally they'd pay 80 million on R&amp;D, but somehow ended up paying \\~300 million this quarter. No one knows why, but this is another thing that influenced PLTR's earnings.\n\n[https://investors.palantir.com/news-details/2020/Palantir-Reports-Revenue-Growth-of-52-in-the-Third-Quarter-Raises-Full-Year-2020-Guidance/default.aspx](https://investors.palantir.com/news-details/2020/Palantir-Reports-Revenue-Growth-of-52-in-the-Third-Quarter-Raises-Full-Year-2020-Guidance/default.aspx)\n\n&gt;On September 30, 2020, in connection with the Direct Listing, we incurred $769.5 million and $8.4 million of stock-based compensation using the accelerated attribution method related to the satisfaction of the performance-based vesting condition for RSUs and growth units, respectively, that had satisfied the service-based vesting condition as of such date.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***#4 PLTR financials moving forwards***\n\nPLTR is deep in bed with the government and the Biden regime although may look like it would be against using PLTR is in fact secretly very pro-surveillance e.g pro Palantir.\n\nHere's some of the known organizations in the US Govt that use PLTR:\n\n1. CDC\n2. Office of the Secretary\n3. Food and Drug Administration\n4. Immigration and Customs Enforcements / ICE\n5. Internal Revenue Service / IRS\n6. National Institute on Drug Abuse\n7. DOD/ARMY - ACC Aberdeen Proving Ground\n8. Coast Guard / DHS\n9. DOD/NAVY - Naval Information Warfare Systems Command\n10. US Attorney's Offices / DOJ\n11. US Special Operations Command / SPEC OPS\n\nBoys. The big institutional people know these things. You just found this out. See how deep PLTR is already in bed with the Government?????? Palantir IS the next Raytheon/Lockheed of DATA aggregation and visualization.\n\n***UPCOMING EARNINGS***\n\nI've done some quick maths and it looks like PLTR is more likely to be in positive earnings this quarter and with a 0.02 cent EPS target, we can easily assume that they'll destroy this with maybe 0.04 or 0.08 EPS. In the worst case scenario, PLTR's EPS this quarter could be somewhere around MINUS -0.05 ish due to interview costs and ad/campaigning costs that were not there before the company was listed.\n\n***WHAT CAN DESTROY PALANTIR***\n\nNow, there's big possible downsides and Palantir can fail IF contracts that expire are not renewed. That's biggest REAL reason for Palantir's balance sheet getting screwed.\n\nI've seen a disturbing pattern with PLTR's financials and that's that every year, it's R&amp;D cost is rising by between 150 and 350 million dollars. This is quite a bit of negative revenue and if new contracts are not constantly coming in, PLTR's balance can start going into the negative.\n\n***WHAT WILL NOT DESTROY PALANTIR***\n\nSome people may have concerns over the new left leaning government dumping PLTR. An article was posted that is behind a paywall EVERYWHERE that goes something like this:\n\n[https://www.thedailybeast.com/cdc-officials-urge-biden-team-to-dump-palantirs-covid-tracker](https://www.thedailybeast.com/cdc-officials-urge-biden-team-to-dump-palantirs-covid-tracker)\n\nIn my opinion, i believe this is inconsequential and that a few people crying to daddy Biden to kill a multimillion contract with PLTR is a stretch. Also we know the current new Biden team has his hands full and will have them full for at least the next 1 year with what's going on.\n\nThere is no time to deal with a few crybabies and even if he did deal with it and did decide to kill the PLTR Tiberius Covid tracker contract with the CDC which he WONT, these things take months and years to deal with, and by then the contract/s will have already brought PLTR tons of money and revenue in.\n\n***HOW MUCH DOES KARP AND HIS GOONS GET PAID***\n\nShort answer is... A LOT. The amounts below are PER YEAR. That's a lot of money in the hole and contributes to annoying amount to why PLTR is always just at the edge of just barely being profitable.\n\n*Processing img ba58nqcurob61...*\n\nPalantir's prospectus 311 page document's 130 last pages are almost all exclusively talking about extremely complicated options trading schemes that are made by Cohen and others to make sure they can squeeze out a LOT of money out of PLTR.\n\nMithril Investments has existed from before and is not a new company. Owned by Thiel/Cohen/Karp as a way to launder and exchange options for more options and more money for all 3 of them. Also Shyam Sankar to me feels corrupt which scares me a bit, he's had some very shady dealings and has brought his wife in PLTR that gets paid 200k per year.\n\nProspectus Document: [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1321655/000119312520230013/d904406ds1.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1321655/000119312520230013/d904406ds1.htm)\n\nI suggest you skim through it, it contains EVERYTHING about Palantir.\n\n**Palantir is going to need to have to be getting AT LEAST 500 million in NEW contracts per year to REMAIN BARELY profitable. It's doable in my opinion, but just barely and it's why they made the company public to try and get more people's attention and increase the inflow of contracts.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***#5 Soros and his 21 million shares***\n\nFirst of all, i think we can all agree that Soros can suck it.\n\nIf you've read a few articles here and there, you'll know that Soros owns/owned 1% of Class A PLTR shares. No one knows whether he's sold them yet or if he's an DPO holder who'll sell 3 days after February's earnings.\n\nWhether he sells them or buys more will be mostly inconsequential in my opinion. We see dips and pumps every day. He legally cannot sell his shares all at once, he'll have to sell certain amounts daily and over time. This will create annoying sideways motion as shares exchange hands and consolidation starts for 2-3 weeks until his and insider shares exchange hands.\n\nNothing special to see here, move along just a little draw down resulting in some consolidation.\n\nPLTR is exposed to OIL more than anything, so fluctuations in the general market and general market crashes affect PLTR much less than other stocks. Also PLTR does not track ANY benchmarks. NONE.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***#6 DPO expiry 3 days after earnings in February***\n\nTo my limited knowledge, this is how BIG plays who are holding DPO shares usually work:\n\n* If a stock has performed well up to earnings and investors are more than happy with the returns, they're more likely to not sell their stock or just sell less than they normally would.\n* If a stock hasn't performed as well as investors thought, these investors are more likely to sell stock or reduce their positions more than normal.\n\nThere's a total of 1.16Billion Class A PLTR shares currently (Give or take don't flog me). We are currently trading with \\~250 million shares while the rest are locked away in the DPO.\n\nWhen those shares are \"unlocked\" in February, the price of the stock won't be diluted. These shares already exist and are accounted for. They are simply locked. Also when they are unlocked, the share price won't simply multiply because all shares are now tradeable.\n\n&gt;According to [Palantir\u2019s after-hours filing with the SEC this afternoon](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1321655/000119312520257973/d89036dex991.htm), the company has 1.16 billion Class A shares, 484 million Class B shares and 1 million Class F shares on its cap table outstanding today, or a total of roughly 1.64 billion. Only Class A shares will trade, and Class B and F shares are convertible to Class A shares on a one-to-one basis. On a fully diluted basis, which Palantir says represents 2.2 billion shares total according to its most recent S-1 filing, the company is valued at $16 billion. The difference between those two aggregate numbers comes from outstanding stock performance grants, warrants and other financial instruments.\n\nWhat **WILL** affect stock price:\n\n* Employees exercising their non class A options into Class A shares. This IS dilution.\n* The bigwigs e.g Alex Karp, Peter Thiel and a few other bigshots exercising their options and then selling them for a profit.\n\n*To note, regular employees will barely affect the price of the stock with their miniscule share holdings. Alex Karp, Peter Thiel and a handful of other high ranked executives in PLTR are the ones that will create a tiny but manageable ripple in the stock price.*\n\nWhat **COULD** affect the stock price a lot:\n\n* Massive sell off by the big institutional holders.\n* Not shorters. (Citron and Citi can suck it, we're in control here)\n* People with weak spaghetti wet paper hands.\n* Everyone fomoing the same weeklies e.g like when everyone bought Jan 15 calls on everything.\n* Big but silent scare campaign (that's already going on) to scare off normies like us.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***#7 What does PLTR do, tldr.***\n\nImagine Facebook's database of everything about everyone &amp; Youtube's Database of everything &amp; Geolocation data in a database made by the US Army for known terrorist cells.\n\nPalantir allows you to select and match varied data TYPES from several different database, combine it in any way you want and visualize it so that it's human readable by even the dumbest person in the room so that even they can see patterns and come to conclusion on a subject matter.\n\nIt's kind of like filling an excel sheet with data and then visualizing it with a bar chart, except the date you filled the sheet with can be anything and not just numbers or dates or countries and you can make various combinations using all the different rows of data to maybe come up with a pattern to something like how to best distribute the Covid vaccines in the counties in a very specific state in the US.\n\nLiterally what you see in SciFi movies where people combine random data by smashing keys on a keyboard and somehow find the murderer, the location of a terrorist or the percentage that someone will commit a murder in the future based on a lot of random data about that person or the area, country, family, history... anything.\n\nWhile this all might sound super cool and amazing, it is. Maybe in 10 years time there will be a few more companies doing this, but for now, it's only Palantir, Circles, Alteryx and a few other private entities that do this type of thing. Many of them work with governments and are hush hush due to the kinds of things they use this type of software for (terrorist cells, warzones, etc) and the public backlash this could cause.\n\ntldr: Glorified data aggregator and visualization platform/software with different access levels for different people.\n\n**PLTR is superbly positioned to offer their software to SLOW and Boomer like organizations like Governments.**\n\nGovernments are stupid and don't have neither the time, nor technical knowledge to develop this software themselves for internal use. This is what PLTR capitalizes on and why Governments use them so much.\n\nGovernments could have spent the a fraction of the money they spend on PLTR contracts to make the software themselves but only for their own internal systems and use, but they can't and if they tried, they'd fail because technocracy in governments is not a thing. By the time they'd even complete a project like this, it'd likely be out of spec, unusable and would require further development and money and we know how slow and bad governments are at doing even the basics. Again PLTR wins because of this.\n\n**PLTR is likely NOT** to be adopted by giants like Google or FB or other modern tech organizations of any size because they are not stupid. They have their own purpose built internal systems that they use to do everything related to data aggregation and visualization because they have the technical knowledge and resources. Buying PLTR for their use is a joke.\n\nPLTR capitalizes on being general a general purpose tool and is set up manually by an engineer over the course of 4-10 days for each customer. The engineer customizes and configures the system for each company's custom use since the software allows you to do so. Regular aggregation and visualization software CAN do the same, but typically lacks data input types and features that PLTR has because PLTR has cultivated a special set of features over many years that were suggested by their existing clientele in battlefields and other places.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***#8 Other Information***\n\n***\\*\\*Big known PLTR Holders\\*\\****\n\n*Processing img a404oalxrob61...*\n\n***\\*\\*PLTR's Price List (2019)\\*\\****\n\n[https://www.esi.mil/Download.aspx?id=7186](https://www.esi.mil/Download.aspx?id=7186)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***\\*\\*Personal TA and Crayon Mania\\*\\****\n\n[https://www.tradingview.com/chart/PLTR/nrjqL4dw-PLTR-Risky-April-100-200-possibility/](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/PLTR/nrjqL4dw-PLTR-Risky-April-100-200-possibility/)\n\n[https://www.tradingview.com/chart/PLTR/5YcdCye0-PLTR-Schizzo-Technical-Analysis/](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/PLTR/5YcdCye0-PLTR-Schizzo-Technical-Analysis/)\n\n[https://www.tradingview.com/chart/PLTR/CkCTvtqM-PLTR-PLTR-train-leaving-the-station-get-ready/](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/PLTR/CkCTvtqM-PLTR-PLTR-train-leaving-the-station-get-ready/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***\\*\\*PLTR stock pumping events\\*\\****\n\n* 7'th Jan - Interview\n* 26'th Jan - Demonstration\n* 11'th Feb - Earnings\n* \\~15'th Feb - DPO expiration - Havoc\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***\\*\\*Similar Companies\\*\\****\n\n* PLTR - Palantir - Stock Price \\~$25 - Market Cap 48bln\n* AYX - Alteryx - Stock Price \\~$125 - Market Cap 8bln\n* Semantic Research - Private\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***\\*\\*Known Contract Info\\*\\****\n\n* 240 million Palantir Air Force contract expiring soon in 3 months.

I'll be holding onto it for the next year. If it's not at least 300% by then, i'm selling it and moving on to the next stock. App i'm using is Revolut.\n\nAlso yes, i'm ALL-IN only on Palantir because i know my money will multiply itself in the short term. I'm not holding this till 2025 as others are supposedly doing. I'm selling in 2022 with 300% or more profit. PLTR is severely undervalued, underpriced because it's a DPO. Give it till EOY and we're going to be rich. If it was an IPO it'd be trading at 180+ already imho.\n\nI've spent the last month and a half holding PLTR. I've gone full schizzo mode when it comes to PLTR. I lose sleep daily and i love it. I hadn't slept for 37 hours a few days ago because i spent so much time researching PLTR and scraping the internet for all possible information.\n\nI come from an IT/Development background, so i understand what PLTR does completely.\n\nMy PT's for PLTR are:\n\n* 48-89 by March or April.\n* 75 - 125 by EOY.\n* 200+ 2022 IF they solve their income and constantly increasing R&amp;D cost issues.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4t0k1ujprob61.png?width=407&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0b3a16265edafa290432e6b79f9009e3df99f495",

        "selftext": "One of the things that amazes me currently in this market is that, it feels like we are trying to justify every new coming hot tech/growth company as if they are the next AMZN in their field. I think one of the delusions people are having lately is that they look at what people projected for AMZN 5-10-15 years ago and compare that to what actually happened.\n\nWhile it is true that AMZN exceeded any sort of expectation by a huge margin (and did this consistently, year over year) it feels to me that we are taking perhaps one of the most unique success stories ever and then extrapolate that to others, thinking that as if those sort of growth and expectations are in fact more common and easy to achieve than not.\n\nI could discuss this for a number of stocks, I wanted to open discussion for TSLA. As we all know, TSLA stock went up almost 8 fold in the last year. Today, it is common occurrence in the market that analysts are justifying these price levels and state why TSLA is just more than a car company. This argument obviously has its own merits, but aren't we little ahead ourselves and already attribute *from today,* all those things that could potentially be achieved and bake it into the price?\n\nIf we went back in in time, we could probably say AMZN was more than just a book company, but could we really say that they would have almost monopolistic power in most of the areas they operated in? Could we really say back in 2008 that AMZN would emerge the market leader in something like for instance Cloud? Or, did these things happen and then we realized how great AMZN became, *after the fact.* It feels like this was much easier to do in hindsight. But what if AMZN is truly that one outlier, anomaly, in the history of stock markets in terms of sustained growth and market power?\n\nIsn't this what we are trying to do with TSLA here? I do think Elon is one of the greatest minds of our time and can achieve far beyond any other has achieved so I am not comparing Bezos or any other with Elon here. But what I am trying to say is that, just thinking TSLA as a company, aren't we already saying today that they already have monopolistic power in EV cars, autonomous driving, solar-energy trade, underground tunnels, robotaxis, etc. - you name it, as if they are already there and waiting to be switched on? It's as if we have already attributed everything we could imagine could happen and already announced TSLA as the winner.\n\nNow this is the theory side of things. **How about financial side of things?**\n\nI don't want to approach this from a car sales point of view, but I will make certain comments.\n\nBut what if we applied AMZN's growth trajectory into TSLA, without focusing too much on car sales, and just see what growth and valuation that would lead us? If TSLA is just more than a car company, what other example could serve best in terms of growth, thinking from an array of products and technological advantage perspective?\n\nSo I did a quick and dirty DCF calculation. In there, my starting point is the first year when AMZN hit $24 billion in revenue, which is 2009. TSLA achieved it's $24 billion in 2019, so from there onwards I am applying AMZN's growth trajectory for the following 10-11 years. Then, growth is gradually reduced in going into the terminal year. What this means is TSLA will be roughly $900 billion revenue generating company by year 20 (2040). From a car sales perspective, I can't really project how many cars it could sell in 20 years, but lets say it is 10 million cars. (I think GS said 15 million). Toyota in 2019 sold around this number I believe so with all the competition that will happen in this space, I think this is by no means and under-estimation. In 2019, TSLA sold roughly 367,500 cars and for a total revenue of $19.2 billion (excluding regulatory credits). On average this equates to $52k per car. In 20 years, car prices will be higher than what they are today obviously, but there will be competition and economies of scale to bring the price down. This one is hard to assume but let's say it grows 1.0% - 1.5% per year with long term inflation, again not necessarily higher because of these offsetting factors. If they do indeed sell 10+ million cars, this is roughly $600-650 billion from cars.\n\nThis leaves you with another $200-250 billion or so for other things, whatever you want to attribute this for - AI, robotaxies, insurance, and so on. Now this figure is a future value, so from today's perspective (using a discount rate of 8% used in my DCF below) that's roughly $60 billion (revenue). This is again a huge number, as it is almost another Facebook, 2x Coca-Cola etc., or half of GM/Toyota type business from revenue generating capability, again, from *today's perspective - none of which has already happened.*\n\nOnce again I want to point out that my revenue projections are not driven by bottoms-up car sales, rather, I am using simply AMZN trajectory in terms of growth, then try to attribute the resulting final revenue figure into parts, obviously majority being from car sales, and the rest from whatever you can think of. (Simply because we don't know what AI/Robos/Insurance/Transportation businesses can generate from revenue/profitability/market share perspective and more importantly what the competition in those areas can be). If you think TSLA can grow even more than AMZN, then I just want to remind you that you won't easily justify 40-50% revenue growth rates once you're in the 50+ billion zone, which is the point of the argument. AMZN, still achieved those growth rates when it had 100+ or 200+ billion, which is what we are already assuming here.\n\nSo in the stock price we have baked in, from a revenue perspective, a car business that will sell at least 10+ million cars (this number can obviously be higher but even 10 million will be big market share),  and other businesses that are worth, today, more than most companies you can think of.\n\nNow this is the growth side of things. How about margins?\n\nWe know TSLA generated a last twelve months EBITDA margin of 14% as of Q3 2020. While margins from car manufacturing is certainly improving, most of this margin is actually attributed to sales of regulatory credits, which are by definition almost 100% profit. And so in reality, the margins are much lower, maybe around low single digits between 1-5%. Now this is important because even with all this revenue growth (and if you disagree with me and think it will even be higher), you still need to achieve big margins on your business. I mean really really good margins, we are talking about 15-25% each year. Interestingly, AMZN, while growing its top line crazily over the years and becoming a behemoth as it is today, always lacked in terms of their margins. That goes without saying they are a tech company that typically exhibit great returns on capital. So the point is they had to sacrifice their margins to be able to achieve this growth and this is an important point.\n\nIn my DCF, I am extremely generous. I kept TSLA's EBITDA margins at 15% for the next 3 years, bumped to 17.5%, 20.0%, then to finally 25.0% every 3 years in going forward. Once again these regulatory credits will not be there forever so those margins are extremely optimistic at this point. They might indeed achieve 25% margins in 10 years or so but it won't be this smooth.\n\nWith these two major factors, other items in the DCF are not super important. The discount rate is 8.0%, which I believe is reasonable, NWC and Capex assumptions are in line with what they are today and I don't think they would necessarily go down (if not go up). I just want to mention that you may completely disagree with some of the assumptions I outlined above. The point however is no matter what sort of DCF you come up with, you will end up either with lower or slight higher value for TSLA, using very, very aggressive assumptions for 10+ years. So the point and question is around the **margin of safety** here.\n\nIt seems I can't directly post pictures so here is the link for the DCF:\n\n[https://ibb.co/mSHDcBh](https://ibb.co/mSHDcBh)\n\nYou might wonder, well your price is even higher than what it is today so why did you write this.\n\nOnce again my whole point in the argument was that the margin of error in TSLA's stock price right now is non-existent, because we've already treated it the next AMZN, gave the best margins possible, attributed big bucks on its other stuff. I think my DCF is still in the unreasonable side, but I wanted to point this out that even a s*light change in trajectory would mean a totally different path and stock price for TSLA.*\n\nSo the question is, are we ahead of ourselves with TSLA? This could also apply to others as well, this so called growth companies. It is as if we are pricing everything today and think that they have already achieved incredible market share in everything they touched and it's only a matter of time that these revenue/profits are realized. Are we taking one anomaly and applying this rationale for every other great company under the name of \"it's tech\"? Elon is great and TSLA will be great. But the business model may not just allow them to be the next AMZN, regardless of technology or improvement.\n\nOne final comment I will make is related to autonomous driving and data TSLA is collecting. While it is for certain that this data gives TSLA an incredible power in developing this technology, I see couple of issues with this as it relates to future of this thing.\n\nCompanies such as Facebook are big not because of their software, but because of the network effects they exhibit. And because of those network effects they become larger and larger and are able to collect more data, which creates an incredibly profitable cycle for them as they can monetize that data right away. Data for TSLA here only matters in developing that technology. Monetization however, is another story.\n\nWhat I am not entirely sure with all this AI story is that if it needs to continuously get updated for use, then how do regulators/companies determine the older version was safe to use to begin with. What I understand is that AI is something that needs to get constantly updated based on data, challenge here is that you are carrying people's lives here (as opposed to targeting ads) so there needs to be an infliction point where the full autonomous driving AI software should be at a point where it is certainly 100% safe to use. Because if it is not, then the technology fails until it reaches to that point. If it does reach out to that point, then how difficult is it going to be for others to get to that point or use similar technology if what you need is to get from point A to B safely. \n\nBesides there is the price factor in as well. Let's say TSLA is the only one who can do this. If autonomous driving is too expensive, then how much will people pay for it? Say if the car is 50k and you have to pay extra 50k on top of that - would you do this? Would this have a cannibalization effect? Or if it is monthly subscription fees, would you go on to pay this forever? How significant will the cost be in 20 years from now when others presumably also start providing some sort of service.\n\nOn the other hand, if it is not expensive and only a fraction of the car price, then how are you going to achieve these growth levels with that data and technology to begin with. It is one thing to have a great technology, another to monetize it. They might license it for sure, but then you lose all that power right away. So the question then becomes, will it be a niche product or commodity at the end of the day - either of which will not allow you to have incredible returns.\n\nWhat are your thoughts?",

        "selftext": "From Zack\u2019s: (more confirmation)\n\n4 Steel Stocks Set to Gain on Spurred Up Demand in 2021\n\nMentioned:\tMT RYI SC.HN ZEUS\n\nThe steel industry in the United States now seems poised to make a comeback from the COVID-19 led slump during the earlier part of last year. Demand for the metal is gradually returning as manufacturers are springing to action. Notably, increased demand has led to higher steel prices. Per S&amp;P Global Platts, the benchmark price for hot-rolled steel hit a two-year high of $900 per ton in December 2020, as mentioned in a Wall Street Journal article.\n\nMoreover, the American Iron and Steel Institute reported that in the week ending Jan 2, production increased 3.1% from the week ending Dec 26, 2020. Capacity utilization also improved to 80.1% from the previous week\u2019s capacity utilization of 72.3%. Although weekly productions were down on a year-over-year basis, the uptick in production from the prior holiday-induced week bodes well.\n\nReflective of the uptick in demand for steel, manufacturing activity has also been expanding in the United States. Per the latest report from the Institute for Supply Management, the purchasing manager\u2019s index for December was 60.7% compared to 57.5% in November, marking the eighth consecutive month of growth.\n\nMeanwhile, the World Steel Association (\u201cworldsteel\u201d) also forecast in a report that global demand for steel will rise 4.1% in 2021 following an estimated slump of 2.4% in 2020. Moreover, worldsteel predicted that demand for steel in the United States should increase 6.6% in 2021 following an estimated drop of 15.8% in 2020.\n\nSeparately, global production of light vehicles is expected to rebound in 2021. This rebound will be important because the automotive industry is a major contributor to demand for steel. Notably, IHS Markit estimated global light vehicle production to rebound 14% to 84.3 million units in 2021, following an estimated dip of 17% in 2020, as quoted in a Business Wire article. The article further mentioned that in North America, IHS Markit forecast a production increase of 29% on a year-over-year basis for the remainder of 2021 following a cautious view of the first quarter.\n\n4 Steel Stocks to Buy Now\n\nThe outlook for the demand for steel is gradually improving. Steel prices have witnessed an uptick and reflective of the rising demand, manufacturing activity has also continued to expand. Meanwhile, production of light vehicles is also expected to rebound in 2021, a development that bodes well for the steel industry. This makes it a good time to invest in steel stocks that stand to benefit from this improved outlook. We have selected four such stocks that carry a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nArcelorMittal MT, along with its subsidiaries, owns and operates steel manufacturing and mining facilities in Europe, North and South America, Asia, and Africa. The company sells its products to various customers in the automotive, appliance, engineering, construction, energy and machinery industries through a centralized marketing organization, as well as distributors. The company currently has a Zacks Rank #1. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings increased 62.2% over the past 60 days. The company\u2019s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is more than 100%.\n\nSchnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. SC.HN recycles ferrous and nonferrous scrap metals; and manufactures finished steel products worldwide. Under the Cascade Steel and Scrap segment, the company provides semi-finished goods, which include billets; and finished goods consisting of rebar, coiled rebar, wire rods, merchant bars, and other specialty products. The company currently has a Zacks Rank #1. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings increased 52.8% over the past 60 days.

        "selftext": "Tesla stock went up almost 700% this year because Wedbush (who\u2019s made an absolute fortune getting people to buy into his narrative) got retail investors to buy into the narrative that Tesla is not an automotive company, despite over 90% of its revenue coming from selling cars. Once the narrative stuck that it\u2019s a \u201ctech\u201d company, BAM, valuation goes up $550B. And please don\u2019t be an autist and say something retarded like \u201cif Tesla is a car company then Apple is a phone company\u201d. Yes, over 50% of apples revenue is from phones, but they also have huge revenue segments in Mac, IPad, Audio, Services, etc. So, if Apples revenue was 90% phones then yes that statement would be true, buts it\u2019s not so please don\u2019t try and justify it with that stupid brainwashing comment (which I know someone will post in the comments and get 1k upvotes). \n\nNow, Tesla is a phenomenal company with a visionary leader, don\u2019t get me wrong - but they are being priced like the next Amazon. One slip up and they will tumble - or if they can\u2019t find that one thing that will essentially print money for them (Apple iPhone, Google ads, Microsoft Azure, Amazon web services), then valuation will get cut in half. The first 6x months will be about value stocks, and I predict Tesla hits $500 before it hits $900. I think this year makes millionaires first from Tesla puts, then calls in the second half of the year. \n\nThe only thing I can think of that makes this not happen is the amount of cash they have on hand from selling more shares. That amount of money is dangerous in the hands of Elon. But let\u2019s see what happens - I think puts are the way to go early on, could net some new millionaires.",

Cause I'm about to drop a fucking novel.\n\nYou've probably heard Blackberry QNX a few times around other DDs but you're wondering wtf is it and who the hell is even using it. QNX is an Real Time Operating System (more on this later) meant for vehicles, and it's been around for a really long time. Currently there are at least 175m cars running around with QNX. As for what cars those are, I'll keep it short: Apple Car Play was developed on QNX.\n\nSo why haven't we heard more about Blackberry in recent years since there's so many QNX cars around? 2 reasons. 1: Dumbasses like you thought it was a phone company. 2: QNX is so ahead of the fucking game that boomer auto manufacturers like Ford and Mercedes were too stupid to use it effectively. For the last few years it's just been used to turn on your car's radio. *But things have changed now.*\n\n**Zombie cars and QNX**\n\nQNX is the first commercial microkernel RTOS. *What the fuck does that even mean nerd?* For anyone like me who's not a software genius, I've done some research so we all know what we're getting into. A Real Time Operating System is developed to focus processing power on two most important things: Speed and Accuracy. This is different from shit like Windows and Mac OS (General Purpose OS or GPOS) as they spread processing power throughout the system because there isn't exactly anything that's significantly more important than the others. However, when you're using a self-driving program you need the hardware to perform the action at the exact time and speed. Your self driving program brakes too late? Crash into the car ahead of you. Your self program turns the wheel too late or too soon? Crash into a wall.\n\nBlackberry has been working on this technology since 2014. But car makers literally could develop autonomous vehicles fast enough. So these guys have just been twiddling their fucking thumbs.\n\nFast forward to now, where the rise of Tesla has made everyone and their momma make a self driving EV. Everyone is trying to make their own autopilot *program* but not their own OS. So who's OS are they using?\n\n[SONY?](https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/11/sony-reveals-more-details-on-its-secretive-vision-s-sedan/?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAGWdfOT_GLnUXiZBQr4m4lDr6V0nzG6pkRMU6WLRNhsLRKDJHY4MAwxHb-HWZr3pDmEfBYyleSgqSAIjoeXMqU6MfKVSgBbWY5t8brOzZ61dAfzBMOQezOwKfHLLecBdHNEqSjqSskM_c-uUKa-IndxUGWi_Ay9pQMD4kj0iDqvI) Blackberry QNX.

If you read the article, you'll see XPEV is using DESAY's autopilot program that's built on QNX. Know who else is using DESAY autopilot? [Li Auto](https://en.desaysv.com/index.php?id=4974) But what about Nio you might ask? Well on NIO day, it was announced that NIO will be using [Nvidia](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2018/nvidia-announces-world-first-functionally-safe-ai-self-driving-platform) DRIVE....which is also built on QNX. What about the Apple car? There's no confirmation yet, but rumors of them reaching out to both [Canoo](https://www.press.canoo.com/press-release/blackberry-to-power-autonomy-systems-in-canoos-next-generation-electric-vehicles) and [Hyundai](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2019/hyundai-autron-selects-blackberry-qnx-to-power-next-generation-adas-and-autonomous-driving-software-platform) makes me skeptical that Apple has succeeded in creating their own RTOS even after rumors of them starting 7 years ago. *But even if they did... it doesn't even matter.*\n\nYou might have noticed that I didn't mention Tesla at all. That's because they have developed their own Linux-based Operating system, which Tesla has been having trouble getting it approved by US safety regulations. QNX on the other hand, already is. $BB to the fucking moon\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nLinux is also an open source OS and this becomes a huge problem when we talk about zombie cars.\n\nThat's right. *Motherfucking zombie cars*. You know that scene in \"Fate of the Furious\" where Charlize Theron straight up just hacks all the cars in the city and starts slamming them into buildings? Yea, this is a legitimate fear of the U.S. government and Linux is not going to pass any safety regulations. And you better believe after SolarWind and FireEye hacks, Cybersecurity is the hottest topic right now when it comes to national security. You better believe the U.S. Government won't just allow open source OS flowing around millions of autonomous driving cars that can be hijacked at any time of day.\n\nYou know who does have MULTIPLE government certifications already though? Blackberry bb. I won't get it, but you can read [u/josh\\_moworld](https://www.reddit.com/u/josh_moworld/)'s post right [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kxknrl/bb_dd_9_reasons_why_bb_is_from_former_bb_employee/) to get a better idea Blackberry's history with the U.S. government and security.\n\nThe best part about it all is, Blackberry designed QNX to be 100% POSIX compliant. In dumbass terms it basically means any LINUX based program can be ported over easily. Come join the dark side, Elon.\n\nNow that you're pretty much caught up to speed on QNX, let's move over to IVY and why I believe IVY will be Blackberry's return to the throne \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\n**Blackberry x AWS IVY**\n\nIVY is a co-development between Blackberry and Amazon and it is a 50/50 partnership. That's right; Jeff Bezos, the second richest man in the world and king of predatory business practices chose to partner with a company that has a $5.5b market cap. All hail, John Chen \ud83d\udc51\ud83d\udc51\ud83d\udc51\n\nSo what is IVY? Basically IVY cloud-based software that OEMs can install into their QNX vehicles (or any OS) and read sensor data from the vehicle's DCUs (domain controller units). These are basically sensors that give you data such as: times that you unlocked and locked your car, your car's wheel speed sensors, wiper arm sensors, tire pressure etc. In a Tesla, which is loaded with sensors, you will also see: sentry mode data, when an small object hits your car while parked, how hard you step on the accelerator, how hard you brake etc.\n\nIVY basically captures this data and in real time sends it to OEMs for them to analyze. Cars are going to be fitted with more and more sensors (regardless of if they have autonomous systems or not) and the data that IVY provides is very helpful. This allows OEMs to see their customer's car preferences or driving styles and can further develop their future vehicles to match customer's interests. Also, since the data is transferred in REAL TIME, things like horrible weather conditions, traffic updates, and icy roads can be communicated to all vehicles within the OEM network so that people can be notified ahead of time.\n\nBut you know which industry would *love* this? Insurance companies. OEMs can gather all the safety data that IVY delivers and actually PROVE to insurance companies that their cars are safer. You know how Tesla had to come up with their own auto insurance? That was because Insurance companies were charging crazy high rates for Tesla's that had auto pilot. They didn't know exactly how to rate the risk, or who would take the blame. With Blackberry IVY, OEMs and insurance companies can partner together and have reliable data to work off of.\n\nBest part of it all, IVY is extremely scalable and is a subscription based service. There isn't an exact price announced yet, but you know if Jeff Bezos is involved then there will definitely be a lot of profits flowing in from IVY.\n\nFor me, I'm long-term on $BB with some options to take advantage of the recent hype. I plan on holding shares until I see an actual competitor to QNX and IVY... which I've looked all over the internet and I can't find any. And honestly, Blackberry's security suite has so much to offer this isn't even the complete DD. I've just been typing for too long and figured it was a good time to stop. Maybe I will write another post in the future.",

        "selftext": "I'll admit it. All this Blackberry pump got me hyped and I want to get some action too. BB has potential to moon, but I think a lot of you will still manage to lose money, because you are picking wrong strategies.\n\n**The problem**\n\nI know this sub is obsessed with short term OTM calls. However by buying these you are doing no justice to yourself and this community.\n\nLet me explain. Have you ever wondered who sells you these calls? I'll tell you. Big guys and by big guys I'm talking billion dollar financial institutions that we call **market makers**. Market maker does not care which stock, what strike, how many \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 we put here - all they care about is to **make money by selling you calls.**\n\nMarket makers are very good at managing risk. Whenever they sell calls, they make sure they have the underlying stock. That way, they essentially sell **covered calls** instead of **naked calls**.\n\nWhen you look at the option table, you will notice a column called **Open Interest**. It basically tells you have many option contracts are out there in the wild. Think about this as a number of retards holding these in their Robinhood account, hoping to get rich quickly.\n\nMarket makers love when there is a big hype around certain stock, especially certain strike and date. They sell these calls to you retards, and all they have to do as the expiration date nears is make sure **the stock stays below the most popular strike**, aka **strike with the most open interest**.\n\nWhy would they do that? Because they **make free money** by selling you these worthless gambling short term tickets.\n\nHow would they do this? By shorting the stock. Remember they are so big that they can afford to short the stock and suppress the price of the stock **in the short term** just in time for **your short term calls to expire worthless**.\n\nI know some of you geniuses will tell me that market makers can't manipulate the stock in the short term; sure keep telling yourself that while you ride in your 2010 Toyota Corolla.\n\n**You are easy targets**\n\nOver 11,000 of you idiots, bought $12 February calls. Don't believe me? Check it yourself: [https://twitter.com/silberschmelzer/status/1350903153433128967/photo/1](https://twitter.com/silberschmelzer/status/1350903153433128967/photo/1)\n\nAll market makers have to do now, is make sure BB does not moon past $12 by February 19 and they are set. You lost your stimulus check money and have no means to play again.\n\nMarch is even worse: [https://twitter.com/silberschmelzer/status/1350910637451468801/photo/1](https://twitter.com/silberschmelzer/status/1350910637451468801/photo/1). All of you piling into $15 strikes. Why are you making yourself easy targets? You are disclosing your strike and your date! What if BB moons in April? Can you sustain wasting money on these monthly calls with your minimum wage jobs?\n\n**The solution**\n\nBuy shares. They do not expire. There is no pressure to be right. You want to be on the \ud83d\ude80 when it starts taking off, instead of being broke on the ground.\n\nWith worthless calls, no one will like you - even this sub will make funny of you.\n\nBelieve me. I've been here long enough to remember MSFT 03/21/2020 C $200 and PLTR 12/31/2020 C $30.\n\n**TL;DR**  \nBuy BB shares, not short term OTM calls.",

After my post on Friday explaining why that day's dip wasn't problematic a lot of things have happened. Once again, **thank to everyone for holding the line**!!! And also thanks to **everyone who keeps buying into the cause**. Stay put (aka don't press the f\\*cking sell button)... Keep in mind, that not only are we likely to make big dollars but we are also protecting 45,000 people who work at a company that was important in many people's childhoods - and soon will be relevant for future generations again. Without further ado, here are the updates regarding GameStop:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# \ud83d\udcc5 A Summary of GameStop's moon mission\n\n***GENERAL INFORMATION***:\n\n* At this point we have many different investors that are in it for the long term (sorted by investment size): **Fidelity** (including their Intrinsic Opportunities Fund), Daddy Cohen's **RC Ventures**, **Blackrock**, **Susquehanna**, the OG u/DeepFuckingValue, and of course us *fellow retards* \\- among others\n* GameStop is still a Fortune 500 company which operates as the **WORLD'S LARGEST MULTICHANNEL VIDEO GAME RETAILER**\n* The firm has huge potential for expansion (including in ecommerce) as the **video game market is valued at $160 billion dollars** with an estimated **Compound Annual Growth Rate of 12.9%** (according to *Grand View Research).*\n\n***SHORT INFORMATION (Ortex Estimates; exact Updates not for another week)***:\n\n* *Estimated short interest*: \\~72 Million (decreased after spike but still up from 2020 EOY)\n* *Estimated short float*: still at \\~**101%+** (other estimates as high as 180%)\n* GameStop is still on the **SEC threshold list for 28th consecutive days**\n* Cost to borrow increased by an estimated 14.2%\n* Around 80% to 85% of shorts were likely shorted with a stock price under $20  \u2757 \u2757\n\n***NEWS***:\n\n* Jim Cramer acknowledged that the short busting seems to be working\n* Fidelity, IBKR and Schwab are confirmed to have eliminated/limit margin on $GME (heavily limiting short sellers)\n* Outgoing board members sold a total of nearly $20 Million dollars in stock on Friday sending the stock tumbling bc of the news. Having that said,  \ud83d\udc8e **\u270b s** saved the stock from a potential panic selloff\n* **Ryan Cohen Tweeted yesterday (1/17): Peanut Emoji &amp; GIF saying \"So you're telling me there's a chance\".** The actual meaning remains unclear but many interpreted this as his confirmation that there is a chance for an infinity squeeze \ud83e\udd5c\ud83e\udd5c\ud83e\udd5c\n* Multiple sources have confirmed that PC-Building Stations are coming in near future (mini microcenter-style)\n* Uptick rule (SEC 210) is in effect until at least EOD Tuesday\n* **$GS2C (Frankfurt) is up nearly 17% at the time** of writing this DD (on a NYSE holiday)\n* Webull and Etoro disabled shorting $GME\n\n***OTHER FACTORS***:\n\n* There are talks about **potential margin calls** (which would strongly affect shorts)\n* Additional stimulus potential will increase the WSB meme buy\n* u/TitusSupremus DD post ended up on Reddit's popular page (with 300+ awards and 11k+ upvotes) making it inevitable for Reddit users outside of this sub to miss out on this. (This play has literally reached the Front Page of the \"Front Page of the Internet\")\n\n**News about GameStop seem to be never-ending. This renders technical analysis nearly irrelevant as well. Despite some major publications releasing a bearish outlook on the firm, the bullish signs are overwhelming**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# \ud83d\udd2e Outlook over the coming days:\n\n* Expect yet another highly **volatile day/week on the market**. Be careful with options at the moment; shares are likely the way to go and will also help the cause more...\n* There is no doubt that the **potential for another squeeze exists** (maybe even a legendary MOASS)!!!\n* Even if the squeeze does not happen (for whatever reasons) this stock is an **absolute value buy**, as many people before me have explained here. Another reason to go with shares rather than options!\n\n**As long as idiots don't \ud83d\udcc4\u270b there is a fairly low potential for downside and HIGH POTENTIAL FOR LARGE UPSIDE on the LONG POSITION**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# \ud83d\udc3b Media Outlets, Melvin &amp; other short sellers\n\nI feel like I am a broken record, but GameStop is here to stay. I know WallStreetBets will never change your mind but if you were honest you would go back an analyze past short squeezes.\n\nLet's take the example of KBIO's 10,000% squeeze:\n\n* KBIO was entirely defunct and insolvent unlike **GME which actually has an amazing opportunity in a fast-growing space**. The childhood memories of most American's and brand recognition alone play a huge factor. Plus, their subsidiaries are solid as well!\n* **Fundamentals don't matter in these situations**... it's a result of a variety of different factors that cause a short squeeze, and now you have an unprecedented influence: bullish individuals who will never give up - aka us!\n* Most squeezes undergo a similar sequence of events:\n\n1. Shares are **massively over-shorted** (over 100% is banned by some governments for a reason)\n2. **Big news regarding the overhaul** of the firm (happened with RC ventures buying in and overhauling board control)\n3. Forced **borrow recall** and/or margin removal (this already started)\n4. An actual squeeze happens as **panic breaks out** among short sellers - it's just a matter of time before someone starts folding (BTW, doubling down is a horrible bet and has barely ever gone well after a squeeze)\n\n* News Outlets and analysts tend to focus on patterns or traditional methods of pricing stocks. There is no way to say that this will be a good stock to short and therefore short selling downside far outweighs the upside.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**EASY TO SHORT does not mean EASY TO COVER. Now it's time to realize that SHORTING THIS STOCK WAS A HORRIBLE IDEA and in fact STILL IS A HORRIBLE IDEA. For institutional and retail short sellers alike: you may see the same consequences as $KBIO short sellers did - many of which went bankrupt. LONG POSITIONS are the way to go.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNote: For everyone who is new to this, please be aware that options have low impact on share prices and that volatility (among many other things) plays a huge factor in your trades. Be careful with your trades and always do your own due diligence. This is for educational purposes only.\n\nPS: \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nPPS: Now would be the perfect time for an announcement by GME for future plans. Even a small announcement relating to a technology-shift will slingshot-launch our moon mission. Maybe a potential for that happening as GameStop canceled appearance at ICR??

        "selftext": "**TL;DR** on the bottom unless you're into masochism cuz I took Adderall for this and it's long as fuck.\n\nI called GRWG, I called RAVN, now its time for me to take Mommy Cathie\u2019s hand and lead my fellow WSBautists to the moon once more. KTOS makes rockets, and there's one with our name on it. \ud83d\ude80\n\n**Quick Wikipedia Introduction:**\n\n&gt;**Kratos Defense &amp; Security Solutions, Inc**, (NASDAQ: [KTOS](https://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/ktos)), headquartered in San Diego, California,specializes in directed-energy weapons, unmanned systems, satellite communications, cyber security/warfare, microwave electronics, missile defense, training and combat systems.\u00a0  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Customers include the U.S. federal government, foreign governments, commercial enterprises and state and local government agencies. Kratos is organized into six major divisions:\u00a0  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Defense and Rocket Support Services\u00a0  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Microwaves Electronics  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Modular Systems  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Public Safety and Security  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Technology and Training  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Unmanned Systems.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Some of Kratos' newest products are part of a Pentagon effort to partner with innovators and incubate technology-focused businesses in Silicon Valley  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Kratos has primarily an engineering and technically oriented work force of approximatively 2,700 with a substantial number of the Company's employees holding national security clearances. Virtually all of Kratos' work is performed on a military base, in a secure facility or at a critical infrastructure location. [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kratos_Defense_%26_Security_Solutions)\n\n**Why You\u2019re Really Here**\n\n**October 8th, 2020**, ARK Investment Management LLC filed a 13F-HR form disclosing ownership of **558,726 shares** worth $8,733,000.\n\n**November 30th, 2020**, ARK Investment Management LLC filed a 13F-HR form disclosing ownership of **1,106,685 shares** worth about $21,337,000 USD\u2014representing a 98% increase in shares and a 144% increase in value in under two months. GUH \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nARK recently doubled their stake in KTOS, and they're are not alone in their confidence.\u00a0\n\nSmart money loves KTOS, as illustrated by their 89.86% institutional ownership:\u00a0\n\n* Blackrock has a 6.83% stake in the company at 8.3 million shares\n* Vanguard has a 6.55% stake at 8 million shares\n* Fidelity has a 5.36% stake at 6.6 millions shares.\u00a0[Source](https://money.cnn.com/quote/shareholders/shareholders.html?symb=KTOS&amp;subView=institutional)\n\nI'm no genius, and neither are you. But I have made myself good money riding the coattails of those with billions at stake and teams of researchers behind them.\n\nThat said, institutional ownership comes as no surprise as far as defense companies go. Instituions love to own them. They\u2019re safe investments. The military's got deep pockets and smart money knows never to bet against America.\u00a0\n\nHowever, Kratos is not just any old Defense and Aerospace company. There is a reason that ARKQ [added 153,098 shares to their fund just last week.](https://cathiesark.com/ark-combined-holdings-of-ktos)\n\n**Like GRWG, Kratos Defense and Security Solutions has spent the last ten years gobbling up their competition.** Six acquisitions and one merger later, the frequency of their contracts reflect their place as a leader in military tech development:\n\n* December 8th, 2020: [Kratos Receives $37.7 Million Skyborg Program Contract Award from USAF Advanced Aircraft Office](https://ir.kratosdefense.com/news-releases/news-release-details/kratos-receives-377-million-skyborg-program-contract-award-usaf)\n* December 10th, 2020: [Naval Air Systems Command Exercises Option for an Additional $38.7 Million for Full Rate Production (Lot 2) of the BQM-177A Subsonic Aerial Target System](https://ir.kratosdefense.com/news-releases/news-release-details/naval-air-systems-command-exercises-option-additional-387)\n* December 21st, 2020: [Kratos Receives $17.8 Million Contract Modification Related to XQ-58A Valkyrie from USAF Research Laboratory](https://ir.kratosdefense.com/news-releases/news-release-details/kratos-receives-178-million-contract-modification-related-xq-58a)\n* December 28th, 2020: [Naval Air Systems Command Exercises Option for an Additional $3.6 Million to Kratos for Contractor Logistics Support &amp; Engineering Services for the BQM-177A Subsonic Aerial Target System](https://ir.kratosdefense.com/news-releases/news-release-details/naval-air-systems-command-exercises-option-additional-36-million)\n* December 29, 2020: [Kratos Awarded Contract Modification Valued at $22 Million to Provide Satellite Command and Control System Sustainment](https://ir.kratosdefense.com/news-releases/news-release-details/kratos-awarded-contract-modification-valued-22-million-provide)\n* December 30, 2020: [Kratos C5IS Business Receives $10.5 Million in National Security Related Program Orders](https://ir.kratosdefense.com/news-releases/news-release-details/kratos-c5isr-business-receives-105-million-national-security)\n* Januray 4, 2020: [Kratos Receives $11 Million Development Contract for Next Generation Satellite Program](https://ir.kratosdefense.com/news-releases/news-release-details/kratos-receives-11-million-development-contract-next-generation)\n\nKratos\u2019 acquisitions have allowed it to develop proprietary technologies that are sold as products. Not only that, but as many of the above contracts show, they are also being paid \ud83d\ude80 buku bucks \ud83d\ude80 to maintain and service the products and tech that they sell.\n\nBut ok yeah, sure, they produce: disposable missiles made for aerial target practice, small sUAS swarming drones, satellites, radios, and augmented reality simulation training systems and microwave electronics\u2014but that is not what grabbed my attention and surely not what grabbed the attention of Cathie Ark.\u00a0\n\nReady for the kicker? Say it with me now:\n\n**Ground Vehicle Automation**\n\n&gt;The Kratos Multi-Platform Appliqu\u00e9 Kit (M-PAK) is the next generation of Ground Vehicle automation. The system can be used to quickly and easily convert your existing fleet of standard human-driven vehicles into optionally-manned systems that can be driven in manned or unmanned modes. M-PAK is a scalable system that can be used as a stand-alone vehicle mobility kit or sensors can be added to offer various levels of autonomy\u2026 M-PAK allows for a semi-permanent installation in a vehicle, which releases the user from committing to one vehicle platform or a particular vehicle.\n\nThese two developments are why Cathie bought up KTOS for ARKQ. These vehicle conversion kits also represent Kratos\u2019 foray into the commercial space. Their ground vehicle automation kits, originally used to safely lead military convoys, are now used to man impact-absorbing trailers behind slow-moving highway construction vehicles. Up until recently, the job of driving the impact truck was filled by some poor employee. Now, with Kratos\u2019 product, this job can be completely automated, with the GPS-guided computer safely trailing whatever work vehicle it is instructed to.\u00a0[Source](https://www.kratosdefense.com/systems-and-platforms/unmanned-systems/ground/autonomous-truck-mounted-attenuator)\n\nBasically, you can turn any truck into a completely independently acting, simple, autonomous vehicle with the installation of this semipermanent kit.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Sea Surface Vehicle Automation**\u00a0\n\n&gt;Kratos \\[has also\\]developed a number of vehicle control systems that are easily installed and quickly convert most human-driven seaborne vessels to unmanned systems.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The Kratos C2 is currently in use and supporting mission operations for the U.S. Navy and Army utilizing the High-Speed Maneuvering Surface Target (HSMST), which was developed in response to a requirement for a 40+ knot target to represent littoral threats encountered by the fleet and which would retain 35 kt capability in advanced sea states. [Source](https://www.kratosdefense.com/products/uav/land-and-sea/sea-surface-vehicle-automation)\n\nSo they\u2019re making boat drones too.\u00a0\n\nMilitarily, these unmanned sea surface vehicles can be used against seaborne targets and mine hunting. Commercially, the tech being developed by Kratos may have applications in cargo shipping, seaweed farming, and data collection.\n\n**Most Importantly**\n\nIn terms of the fundamentals, **tomorrow, January 13, there will be a virtual conference during which time they will be exhibiting some more of their new tech.** I believe that they will play into the recent EV/AI hype and focus on these automation kits and their potential foray into the commercial space. With some good media coverage, I think this could be a very positive catalyst for the stock. I tried calling investor relations to ask some questions, but they dubbed my calls. **Big dick energy. Bullish.**\u00a0\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\n&gt;President &amp; CEO, Eric DeMarco, and its Executive VP &amp; CFO, Deanna Lund, will present at the 23rd Annual Needham Virtual Conference on January 13th at 11:30am Eastern.

Consolidation on an upwards trend.\u00a0\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[MACD\\/RSI Bullish.

Super solid buy wall at around $25.69. Anything around these levels I would count as buying the bottom. Set a stop loss slightly below the support to minimize downside risk.\u00a0\n\nThis morning January 12th, premarket action suggests a moon mission. They were [just awarded another 12 million dollar contract a few hours ago](https://ir.kratosdefense.com/news-releases/news-release-details/kratos-awarded-127-million-task-order-complete-cost-optimized). \n\n**TL;DR: : With its powerful acquisitions, sticky government contacts, consistent revenue growth, institutional backing, THICC technicals and TOMORROW'S imminent positive catalyst, KTOS cannot go tits up.

        "selftext": "Well, if anyone hates market makers, today is your day. I'm 90% sure they got completely screwed.\n\nI don't think this is a short squeeze primarily. I think we are actually seeing a gamma breakdown, and citadel and other market makers are losing hundreds of millions today.\n\nShorts don't HAVE to cover until there are 0 shares to borrow and they get bought in. They may get margin called before, but institutions diversify. And there are shares to borrow to an extent, rate still 22% on IB. I'm sure some of this happened, but you can't really force this until the many hundreds on a typical hedge fund book.\n\nOn the other hand, looking at options, OI went up a lot overnight - I sadly did not check this AM. You now have 80K calls expiring today at 55 to 60 bucks, then another 70k next week, and another maybe 50k at longer dates.\n\nThat's 200k, or 20m shares!!! To hedge that at 63+ you need... about 20m shares.  Of course, some are thetagang short options, so call it 15m shares. Keep in mind, dealers had 25-30m shares before this going into today, so they now want to hold 50m shares (on 110m sythethic float of loaned shares + real shares)\n\nI think that when the ramp started around 55, dealers had to rush to buy shares, but could not get 15m shares between $50 and $60. I still think they need to buy more shares. So they are probably down 5-10m shares from what they need, which means they are losing $10m per dollar move in the price, and will pay any price to stop the bleeding. They basically oversold you guys calls yesterday and didn't risk manage. I'm sure some guys in their risk mgmt department are getting fired over this, as the writing was on the wall, and they still sold you guys calls - they should've been charging $10 a call yesterday to protect themselves. I suspect when the dust settles, we will find out that the better market makers BOUGHT calls from other market makers, and would not be surprised if there's an 8-k from a market maker tonight about exceptional losses. You may actually bankrupt a small one.\n\nIn terms of gamma conditions ffom here, there's no remaining ramp, but there may be residual MM buy. They are likely buying your $60 calls to hedge themselves from more pain, so it should stabilize in a few hours since they'll pay anything to stop the bleeding. From there, it's a down ramp until gamma ramps re-built at higher prices.\n\nI have no idea where the price goes from here today. Conventionally, it should be selling because there's a lot of calls ITM rolling off, but MMs may be so damn underwater and in need of shares it may not happen, and they may not sell shares on calls sold to them as they may be underhedged.\n\nWow.\n\n**I'm a bear, but seriously, congrats bulls, you did break the market, but maybe not in the way you think you did. I really think the guys you screwed today were MMs...** \n\nAnd I'm really dumb for not checking open interest this morning. Writing was on the wall due to all the calls you guys bought yesterday.",

        "selftext": " One of Andrew Left's cases for selling $GME was the fact that companies with a long-term \"short thesis\" can still borrow shares easily and aren't paying high interest rates to hold these shares! This is **blasphemy**. On E-Trade right now its literally **impossible** to short the stock (no shares available, check picture). E-Trade is one of the largest trading platforms in the world!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img nugg9zxj3uc61...*\n\nAnd when you were able to short the stock the borrow rates were **astronomical**.....  not \"average\" as he suggests.... I have posted proof of that as well (I was short GME for a while. Gay bear I know). He paints a picture as if these huge hedge funds are short GME and willing to wait it out for months for their \"short thesis\" to prove true. **This is false.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img xwtd0v1m3uc61...*\n\n**The scary thing about short positions is when they move against you is the get larger.**  What started out as a $10million dollar bet against Gamestop at $5 share price is now a $100million dollar bet if the stock price hits $50. Also consider that many of these funds were probably doubling down as the stock ran up. See how a position that was maybe 1% of your portfolio can quickly become 20% or **even more**.\n\nWhat Andrew doesn't want to admit is that some of these big funds are holding **massive** bags. I guarantee you it's getting to the point where the juice is no longer worth the squeeze. Shares are getting called back, margin req's are changing (it happened at E-trade), and firms are paying super high interest rates just to hold their position that's getting larger and larger. Not to mention this is  happening in the middle of a crazy bull run. Do fund managers really want to continue holding this position when so much other stuff is hitting all time highs? I could throw a dart at a board full of SPACs and MEME stocks and be up 100% in 6 months, \n\nBasically what fund managers are beginning to be say to themselves is something along the lines of \"**the markets can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent.\"**  Frankly the original \"short thesis\" doesn't even matter anymore for these companies like Melvin. What matters is the stock is up nearly 1000% in the last 6 months and their short position has become so large that it's a massive liability. They aren't stupid. They understand a gamma squeeze could send this thing to  $1,000 and their fund could legitimately blow up. \n\nWhat I'm saying is that investors are applying so much pressure that they're going to break. The  thesis of the company changed when Ryan Cohen came on board. That's when you saw institutional **smart/big**  money get on the long side (notice how it was one day after the announcement, analysts had to pitch it to the fund managers first). The companies who are short desperately want to get out of their positions but they don't want to cover at this price. They desperately want the stock to fall to $20 so they can exit their positions without a MTD portfolio loss of double digits. Remember that the people making these decisions got there because they were almost always **correct**. These guys bagholding are feeling the pressure. One bad trade can unravel everything you've worked for on Wall Street.\n\n**What This Means**:  Buy as many shares as you can and **hold** no matter what. **As long as we don't sell we will avoid a massive sell-off**. Let the scalpers get their trades in don't panic. There aren't enough shares available to short for them to drive down the price artificially. Once they start covering and the algos join in we are going to moon again. \n\nDisclaimer:\n\nI am long Gamestop with 8,000 shares with plans to acquire more......\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img 5ftuly325uc61...*",

        "selftext": "Reddit has a impulse to become an echo chamber because of how the upvote and downvote mechanics work. People who are downvoted get their posts and comments hidden and eventually get muted, and Karma does motivate people to seek upvotes. The best examples are how r/politics become completely blue dominated with no alternative views, or people will post things on r/nottheonion and the comments get dominated as if it is r/politics. Alongside this, you see a gradual reduction in nuance, which in r/politics became \"mango bad\".  You see this throughout other subs on non-political topics once a tribal identity forms, and there is a strong tribal narrative on one side of an issue, and then people passionately downvote anything not in agreement. \n\nOn WSB bets, the mods banned political comments to prevent this kind of tribal BS seeping into the sub. But, we are starting to get extremely tribal about specific meme stocks to the point where it's very difficult to get quality DD on the other end of the issue. An awful lot of top posts do not have humor value as memes, and are basically - &lt;ticker I YOLOed my entire account into&gt;  \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80  followed by trash talk about some skeptic somewhere. I feel like arguing with people about a hot ticker now is like arguing with an anti-vaxxer friend about Moderna, or a blue friend about Mango's actual governmental actions, or a red friend about vote counting. It's really hard to be constructive or for anyone to get smarter.\n\nIf the goal of this sub is to collectively pump particular stocks, I guess this is true to form, but if the goal of this sub includes discussion to inform better trading outcomes for participants, this dynamic is greatly reducing the quality of trading discussion. Right now, the feed is almost exclusively just two tickers, and those threads have very few contrary views, even well thought out ones. Even 4 or 5 months ago, I felt this sub was a lot different than stocktwits, but it's hard to tell the difference sometimes now.  I really want to be part of a community where we consistently find insight and trades that everyone else thought was dumb but was in reality brilliant, and that holds up some time later. The GME value thesis at $5 is one of those. So too was BTFDing the pandemic, and shorting it too. \n\nI think this current tribalism is going to lead to worse trading outcomes for the sub in the long run. When we front-run a big wave of increasing bid on a stock, and then that price becomes stable or we exit before it's not, we outperform the market. That happened big time last year with Coronavirus, and has happened repeatedly with TSLA. In other cases we try to forget, it's been the opposite, like multiple times ahead of AMD earnings, PRPL, and over-exuberance with PLTR into the 30s. Basically, if we pump the stock, and then the broader community of investors doesn't come around to the point of view, we are stuck with the bag. And a lot of these outcomes come from when we are all-in and super emotional about it, which I think we all know is NOT how to trade if you want the best results. \n\nWe should stop downvoting posts and comments that are well written, and instead leave them alone or up vote them.

        "selftext": "I have been investing since 2008 when I was in college and recognized a unique opportunity and realized that my $5,000 savings was not much compared to my future earnings.  So I dumped my money into WF and turned it into about $15k in a year.  Since about 2011, I have been investing in mainly ETF index funds with the occasional individual stock.  I have a 401K thru work that invests in 2 separate index funds where about half my money is.  Another 25% is in IRAs that I use to actively trade individual stocks and another 25% is in a brokerage account where I had a few ETF (ARKK and VB) and a mutual fund.  Last year all my accounts performed well, especially my IRA due to some lucky trade timing.  My 2020 return was about 30% overall.  However, early this week I sold a bunch of assets in my IRA and brokerage account and am sitting on about 40% cash.  Only holding ARKK and the funds in my 401K.\n\nQuestion is, is anyone else struggling to balance the FOMO on this crazy overvalued momentum swing versus a belief that an inevitable correction is going to occur?  I am paralyzed in deciding to get back in because when I look at all these fundamentals none of it is making sense.  That doesn\u2019t even account for the elephant in the room of the impact all this stimulus may have by causing potential hyperinflation.  My strategy has always been to sell when valuations become absurd.  Historically I have always been able to find other value and buy back in.  Now I am struggling because it seems like everything is overvalued.",

Now, let's do some math.\n\n**Assumptions:**\n\n\u2022 Assume C(n) is 'zero point', prior to squeeze; where 'C' is initial capital, and 'n' is all the compounded multiplier *prior* to the deadly short squeeze. It's some king shit. Therefore, C(n)=SP.\n\n\u2022 Assume days-to-cover is about 6 under a 100% of float shorted scenario (which, in our case, is actually 250%-300%+. Who knows how that shit plays out. (I like to play conservative: positive surprise is better than negative.)\n\n\u2022Assume 50% increase in share price (SP) per day during short squeeze panic.

        "selftext": "WSB mods: please msg me if you take this down (again)\n\nWhat an exciting time to be alive! We're gonna bust an institutional short hedge fund Robinhood-style in the middle of a global pandemic and trigger a great redistribution of wealth.\n\nTLDR: Short squeeze trigger might've changed from waiting for GME/RC news about positive GME growth &amp; direction to the gamma squeeze triggering intolerably high prices for shorts and/or margin calling. Short squeeze timeline might've just been moved closer by months. \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc50 and buy \ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\udcb0 (shares or calls).\n\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nSo by now you've probably heard that the price hikes on the past two Fridays were due to gamma squeezes. When calls are purchased, Market Makers buy some shares just in case they have to pay out or provide shares when the contract is settled. This lowers their risk, and they are generally good at not losing money.\n\nSo what happened Friday? Literally every open call that was sold at any time hit their strike price became ITM, because the highest strike available was $60 and the stock closed at \\~$65. Even if the call didn't expire until 2023, their risk management policies dictate that they must purchase shares to cover their potential downside.\n\nWhat drives stock prices? Supply and demand. Supply was already low on Friday, and MMs started hedging their positions gobbling up shares left/right/center at whatever price they could get, driving up demand. The stock price surged (praise be) and we collectively did our little happy dances.\n\nNow apparently, these \\~10-15M shares should be cleared by around Tuesday and in the hands of anybody deciding to exercise their call options. If those investors \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc50 and don't sell those shares, it decreases liquidity and increases the ceiling of the gamma short feedback squeeze.\n\nSo the gamma squeeze went like this. People bought calls at any price, for any date, and on Friday they had all closed ITM, profitable for those who hold the calls but painful for MMs and the people who sold the calls who now need to find millions of shares to buy. New calls at higher strikes (\\~$115) will be available next week, and the same thing can potentially happen again, especially if there's a good chunk of those outstanding 15M shares that still need to be purchased. What'll happen when people buy calls again on Monday but MMs still need to buy millions of shares by Tuesday? Supply and demand, the price will soar again. What happens when the price approaches ITM territory for new outstanding calls? MMs need to hedge by buying shares. What happens when MMs need to buy more shares from a smaller pool of available shares? Supply and demand.\n\nWe've achieved the gamma feedback loop.\n\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nBuying ITM or near OTM calls will force MMs to hedge by buying more shares which will raise the stock price and bring higher-strike calls closer to ATM/ITM which forces them to buy more shares , all in a vicious loop.\n\nDO, NOT, SELL, YOUR, SHARES.\n\n\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc50 \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc50 \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc50 \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc50 \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc50 \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc50 \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc50 \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc50 \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc50 \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc50 \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc50 \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc50 \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc50 \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc50 \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc50\n\nNow, onto the short squeeze.\n\nThere are still 102.3% shares shorted. Literally more shares have been shorted than Gamestop has issued. As of Friday after market close, the short squeeze has not yet squoze.\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l2xc4o/gme\\_moass\\_update\\_ortex\\_data\\_12221](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l2xc4o/gme_moass_update_ortex_data_12221/)\n\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nSo what is the short squeeze?\n\nA quick background because some are new to this, but since it's been explained in plenty of other DDs for months now here's the short version (haha).\n\nCertain huge hedge funds thought GME would pull a blockbuster and implode down to $0. They completely ignored the fact that the ex-CEO of Nintendo is now on the Board of Directors, along with Ryan Cohen and the two people that helped him build Chewy from nothing to a $3.5B powerhouse that beat Amazon at online retail. The legend outcompeted Jeff fucking Bezos after getting denied funding by \\~100 VCs, and he only sold Chewy cause his beloved father &amp; mentor suddenly died while he was getting ready to take Chewy public.\n\nPetSmart bought Chewy and promptly IPOd it to $10B.\n\nAfter the last earnings report he threatened the GME BOD to stop dropping the ball OR ELSE. He put his money where his mouth is and bought 13% of GME. They listened, struck a deal with him and are getting ready to pivot GME (just like $BB). GME will do two main things:\n\n1. Transform their online presence to make it the Amazon of gaming\n2. Update their retail locations to enter into the PC gaming market\n\nAll of this was discovered thanks to many hard-working autists who put together fantastic DDs which are now making us bank. We salute you, and personally, thank you very much because this will measurably change my life (which is why I'm writing this).\n\nPrevious to the two GME gamma squeezes, we were essentially waiting for GME to announce what our hard-working autists have been telling us ever since RC released his warning letter to the GME BOD. Why is this important?\n\nBecause the bears still believe in their bear thesis.\n\nThe bears still think GME will Blockbuster and they believe the current bump in stock price is the equivalent of a \"dip\" for them, so they doubled-down on their short position.\n\nUntil their thesis is proven wrong/outdated via news from either GME or RC outlining GME's new growth plans, shorts will cling to their bear thesis and think we are delusional retards. Truth is, we just figured out GME's plan before the shorts did, and we're clinging to the unofficial news because it simply, makes, sense.\n\nSOOO, once the news breaks that GameStop actually has a really good growth plan, bears will say \"awe fuck\" and start buying shares to close out their short position. Except wait, supply and demand again. There are so few shares now that they would have to buy our shares, sell them back, buy them again at a higher price, sell them back, buy them again at a higher price, sell them again, and on and on again to the moon, about 13x. That will be the true squeeze we have all been waiting for.\n\nWhat we didn't realize is that\n\n1. The catalyst to trigger the short squeeze has potentially changed, and\n2. The timeline might've just moved a lot closer to the present day\n\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nI Present To You: The Gamma Short Feedback Squeeze\n\nThe gamma squeeze causes MMs to buy shares, driving price up. Shares are purchased, fewer shares are available to be sold, price goes up. This increases the loss floor of the shorted shares for short sellers and increases the interest paid to continue shorting them. Remember, shorting a stock caries unlimited risk because a share price can climb to an unlimited height. As the risk increases, the shorts get scared. If they are forced to cover, their losses will be proportional to the increase of the stock price. Higher price = higher losses for them. They can keep paying interest, but at some point the risk becomes too great and they throw in the towel. Now that GME has hit mainstream media, everybody and their grandmother has heard in the news that GME squeeze is incoming and is getting in on the game. Supply and demand, price goes up, supply goes down, gamma squeeze forces MMs to buy more to hedge, supply goes down, price goes up.\n\nPrice keeps going up, shorts get mighty nervous. They might decide to ride it out for a few years, EXCEPT......\n\nWhen there are no more shares available to trade, margin calls will begin. Shares that were purchased with borrowed funds will be forcibly liquidated, and you can bet that at some point Melvin's shorts will be forcibly margin called.\n\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nBoom, short squeeze triggered by the gamma squeeze: The Gamma Short Feedback Squeeze\n\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nThe gamma squeeze will firstly drive the price a lot higher BEFORE the main short squeeze. It will also feedback into the short squeeze which increases with probability every time more shares are taken off the board and every time the stock price increases.\n\nAll you have to do, is\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc50, and if you can, buy \ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\udcb0 (shares or calls).\n\nThis is history in the making, an unprecedented event. Not only is the ratio of shares shorted to shares realistically available to sell higher than the VW squeeze, but it's getting turbocharged by a gamma squeeze too. We are double-dipping this bitch!! This went from a once-in-a-decade opportunity to a once-in-a-century play, and we get to take from shitty companies counting on others to fail and redistribute their wealth to the average retard.\n\nIf you benefit from this play, please remember to set aside funds for taxes (bless you tax-free TFSA) and for charity.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPosition: 346 shares @ $20 (doubling Monday once funds transfer). \n\nAlso, I listed my 7-series for sale and will buy a $3k shitbox to drive until the squeeze has squoze, sinking the sale proceeds directly into $GME. When this happens I'll be able to upgrade to a lambo instead.",

        "selftext": "&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Good Afternoon Retards.** Tilray (TLRY) has been having a nice start to 2021. This is only the beginning and there's still time for you to secure your first 10 bagger of 2021. \ud83d\ude80\n\n**Why TLRY?**\n\nIt's all in the fundamentals. TLRY got the better end, at least in the short term, of the merger deal with APHA. The premium APHA will pay per share in this reverse acquisition will be of great benefit to TLRY's balance sheet. Tilray's massive potential has now been coupled with strong fundamentals. When (Yes, WHEN not if) weed is legalized in the US, Tilray, a company registered in the US, has the foothold in the US that, when combined with APHA's resources and distribution, will be a DOMINANT force in the market. \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nNot only is Tilray in a good position to take over the US Cannabis market, but it also has a strong presence in Canada, where it is headquartered. The merger with APHA means TLRY will own 17.3% of the Canadian Cannabis market, **by far the largest** market share of any other Canadian Cannabis companies. \n\n**The US is a HUGE market to be tapped into\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80**\n\nGeorgia Senate elections are **TOMORROW,** as of the writing of this post **BOTH** Democratic candidates are the betting favorites to win. **When this happens, the blue wave is complete and weed is all but legalized in the US.** A Democrat-controlled Senate was the last domino needed to fall. It is reasonable to believe that weed can and will be legalized in the US before the end of Q1 2021. \n\nOnce weed is federally legalized, the market expands **EXPONETIALLY** in the US. Weed will become legal in large states such as New York. **Billions of dollars are just sitting that TLRY is in the best position to take** \n\n**TLRY is MASSIVELY undervalued\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80**\n\nAs of 12/31, TLRY is trading at a very attractive 4.23 \\* book value. MorningStar gives TLRY a fair value of 14$ (As of 1/1/21). Only 1 of 18 analysts have given TLRY a sell rating.\n\n**Wall Street is bullish on TLRY\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80**\n\nSince it has cooled down since the Biden rally, Tilray has consistently been reaching higher highs and higher lows. It is up around 6% at the time I'm writing this post. Put/Call Ratio is .1! Safe to say Wall Street is preparing for the Blue Wave and the legalization of weed, of which TLRY is in the best position to take advantage of the untapped US market. \n\nSources:\n\n[https://www.livemint.com/news/world/tilray-and-aphria-announce-merger-to-create-the-largest-global-cannabis-company-11608361067376.html](https://www.livemint.com/news/world/tilray-and-aphria-announce-merger-to-create-the-largest-global-cannabis-company-11608361067376.html)\n\n[https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/12/22/the-2-best-cannabis-stocks-to-own-in-2021/](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/12/22/the-2-best-cannabis-stocks-to-own-in-2021/)\n\n[https://bookies.com/news/senate-races-odds-tracker](https://bookies.com/news/senate-races-odds-tracker)\n\n[https://mjbizdaily.com/which-states-are-likely-to-legalize-recreational-marijuana-in-2021/](https://mjbizdaily.com/which-states-are-likely-to-legalize-recreational-marijuana-in-2021/)\n\n[https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TLRY/key-statistics/](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TLRY/key-statistics/)",

        "selftext": " **TLDR: Because the trading dynamic has changed, I think shorts will choose to cover this week and next, which lends strong support to price (assuming it happens). I also think MMs will put their guard up a little. And I think the company will make actions soon, though maybe not this week. I find it impossible to predict Monday as there's a lot of option settlement stuff and Friday was way up, but I think this week is likelier than not green on short covering (Finally). There is downside risk with the massive gamma ramp down, but I don\u2019t think it will get activated this week.**\n\n*Disclaimer: I have a few long-duration puts I grabbed around $70, that I intend to dump as soon as possible because they no longer match my views, and I may initiate long position after because I\u2019m currently short term bullish on this stock, having through though the current dynamics this weekend. Yes, this has been my worst trade this year, you are welcome longs.* \n\n*No, I don't have updated gamma charts, those become available Monday morning. I too am curious.*\n\nOne key perspective in trading is how are the other groups trading going to trade, and what is the structure of the market?\n\nTrades only make sense in the context of the market the stock exists in. This stock does not exist in the same market it existed in even a week ago, and certainly 2 weeks ago, and as such, many trade theses became very obviously invalid Friday. **That means the value-based short GME trade that made sense from a value basis a few weeks ago no longer make sense, even though the price is even higher.** \n\nThe key actors here are:\n\n**Majors:**\n\nRetail (which can be summarized as net long).\n\nThe Market Makers / Option Dealers\n\nLong/Short Hedge Funds\n\nThe Company\n\n**Minors:**\n\nValue Mutual Funds\n\nWildcard: Other hedge funds\n\nHere\u2019s my analysis of each:\n\n**Market Context:** Before this week, you could see GME as a battle to determine fair value of a stock. At this point, though, you can look at the GME chart in a 6 month or 1 yr view, and it looks like more like a hyberbolic/bubble situation \u2013 like the most popular SPACs of last year, or that \u2018digital money\u2019 thing we don\u2019t talk about here in the earlier days, or that battery company that has a ticker that starts with a Q, or Tilray during it\u2019s original bubble period. In other words, this market looks like a bubble. That doesn\u2019t mean we are above a stable exit price. It just means the market has bubble-like characteristics, which is important to the actions of the actors. Bubbles pop when the capital inflows flip. But more importantly, bubbles scare the hell out of shorts. Shorts know not to short bubbles unless they can precisely predict when the capital inflows will flip. If they don't know this, they figure it out fast.\n\n**Retail:** Retail, in particular WSB and retail, have made it\u2019s intentions clear. Buy at any price until the shorts capitulate, and WSB and other retail traders have shown a lot more capital available than in the past in these scenarios, which makes it a very credible threat alongside the obvious emotional investment. That leads to some behavior outcomes elsewhere in this. It is unknown what retail will do if this has a 30% drawdown, but I personally think it would be more durable than usual in bid.  Some retail will buy long term puts, but those will be low gamma and shouldn\u2019t matter a lot. \n\n**MMs/Option Dealers** \u2013 They got burned hard Friday. Normally they are happy to sell you guys tons of options, and provide liquidity on exits, and lend out their long shares to short sellers for fees, and this kind of volume and volatility sounds like enormous profit to them. But because they over-sold $60 calls and could not hedge \u2018smoothly\u2019, they got burned to the tune of low 9 figures as a group. They are going to be careful to not get burned again. They will accomplish this through a few methods. First, they are going to charge you more for options. That\u2019s already happening, and it means building gamma ramps are harder, but also means more of you will just buy shares. Secondly, they may choose to hedge your calls at higher delta than mathematically standard, so they might buy 30 shares to hedge a call that normally would get 20. This would guarantee \u2018smooth\u2019 hedging ahead of upwards momentum into big strikes like $75 or $115. Overall, I don\u2019t think this really matters much, it just means you are not going to see a market-breaking gamma degenerity like Friday and more gradual gamma squeezes like that first Wednesday squeeze. **It is worth noting that there is a 50m share gamma ramp DOWN should this stock enter free fall selling, in which dealers being so long stock could end up being forced to dump it and then even short, but I don\u2019t know what would cause that this week, so I think it\u2019s very unlikely to be a factor this week, unless net capital flows go negative from retail.** \n\n**Long/Short Hedge Funds** \u2013 These are the guys who account for most of the short interest, and have not been margin called because they have huge, diversified books with dynamic risk management. They look at GME. They think it generously justifies a $20 target, and really think it\u2019s worth $10.  They are dead certain without a raise, the company is out of business in 3 years. They expect a capital raise and dilution, and also expect selling. They have traditional valuation metrics to think this. They saw this happening and thought \u2013 wow, these guys are retail traders, they\u2019ll just take their money and run, and this will come crashing down. If a stock is smart to short at $7, it must be brilliant to short at $60, right? \n\nThe problem is, that thesis depends on the market context of this being an orderly market around a value stock. That\u2019s not what this market is after Friday, at least from a raw glance at the chart on 6m view, and that\u2019s on top of very high short borrow fees that are bleeding money for them. Most importantly, this market is closer to a bubble, and one DOES NOT short a bubble that is moving up or is stable. You only short a bubble while it is clearly collapsing. **I would expect a rational CIO at one of those funds to point out the context mismatch (what was a value short, is now a bubble short), and tell the traders to get the hell out, ASAP, maybe even tomorrow (or Friday at the close, which might have been some of that melt-up to 64).** Or hedge it, which means buying now very expensive OTM calls which ends up helping the stock price. In short, I think after Friday, these funds are going to try to get an orderly cover of their short ASAP, and expect short interest to fall quickly on that. Other shorts may show up, but they won\u2019t be as committed. And I think a lot of shorting will shift to long-term OTM put options betting on a regression to mean some months from now, but those don't add selling by dealers when written.  I think this is a change of context that will finally cause short covering, and is why I\u2019m bullish the stock this week.  There was also some recent news about short funds just getting out of shorting in this market because it's a loser right now. \n\n**The Company \u2013** GME is here for long term shareholder value. Their goal is not to screw the shorts, and it is also not to get the stock to the highest value possible in a 3 day period. They should and can issue new shares, but should do that with a growth story about why they are doing it in order to hopefully make a bid as they do it. I think that could happen any time, and it might come with a new role for Cohen, which of course make sit a bid. So I think they will raise, and I think the current market will bid the raise. \n\n**Value Mutual Funds \u2013** A lot picked up GME in the single digits. They\u2019ve been selling (example is the orderly position reduction of that GME board members stake). I expect they are mostly or entirely out by now, since these are now growth stock prices, and they thus will have little impact on this stock.  \n\n**Wildcard: Hedge funds \u2013** A sufficiently large hedge fund can do very odd things to this stock by tossing a quarter to a half a billion of capital at it. They could bid it up with you, they also could try to trigger the gamma ramp down and pair with OTM puts. They could also do the Stevie Cohen \u2013 Sell an enormous amount of near the money calls or puts to dealers so as to ceiling or floor the price. Really hard to know. But this stock will attract some very smart money in this context, waiting for opportunities, which could be to GME long\u2019s benefit or detraction. Impact: Chaos.\n\n**Wildcard: Insiders \u2013** Cohen can\u2019t swing trade for a profit anything he hasn\u2019t held 6 months or more as a 10%+ holder, and I think that\u2019s bad for his reputation anyway. Most other board members and execs could, and may, but I don\u2019t think that will be negatively received by this market really. I don't expect this to matter much. I also don't think Cohen is going to buy, since he can become CEO at this point if he wants to out of the next election between the support of this sub, his reputation, his current votes, etc.",

        "selftext": "We have entered stage 2 of the short squeeze. Brief overview of market conditions below.\n\n\n1. Shorts are losing $812 million a day in their short positions\n\n2. Last report I saw 95k shares are available to short, down from 1.2 million last week\n\n3. Last report I saw 71 million in short interest\n\n4. Positive media attention on GME due to short busting\n\n5. Upward trend through the 1.2 million short seasawing over 1 week\n\n6. Current price is $46 USD in after hours\n\n\nEffects.\n- At a loss of 812 million a day in short positions all shorts are bleeding money\n\n- 95k shares available for shorting down from 1.2 million means the shorts can't seasaw\n\n- more media outlets are showing positive news for GME so more people are jumping in that before\n\n- at spot price it would cost 3.2 billion to cover all shorts\n\n\nMy thoughts\nWith current estimations of 6 days to cover the short interest when a short squeeze takes off i dont see hedge funds covering this without being margin called; they've all found religion and are paying for a hard market correction to cover and exit. I'm pretty sure alot of them are going to have to liquidate most or all holdings to cover if margin called.\n\nThat being said I expect this stock take off now on the basis that short selling doesn't work, they were seasaeing 1.2 million to try to push the price down, and they've maxed out. This stock is not going back down unless a catastrophe happens and even so the stock might be suppressed for a day if that due to the limited shares moving around.\n\nExpect huge volatility with an only upwards trajectory due to \ud83d\udc8e \u270b s. \n\nI'm hoping for a margin call myself and to be blunt I'm going to try to sell my shares at a million a piece.\n\n\nThe size of the short interest and limited supply of shares in circulation leads me to believe that estimates that this is only going to 5x or 10x is way off. VW short interest was 12.8% and GME is over 100%. Hedge funds lost $30 billion covering just 12.8%. What do you within 100% covering with an estimated 6 days to cover based on stock circulation will look like.\n\nThis is going to make head lines when the short squeeze starts snowballing. And I honestly believe its now that it starts. Theres no downward pressure.\n\n\n\ud83e\udd5c\ud83d\ude80 \u27a1\ufe0f \u26ab\n\n\nThat isn't a fucking black dot thats the fucking black hole in the middle of the galaxy cause this fucking stock is loaded with way more peanut sauce to take us way past the fucking moon boys!",

        "selftext": "Hello, my favourite paste-eating, rocket-posting children. In a few hours, the market opens, and the flood gates will begin. I'm all for GME, both for the MOASS and the long-term outlook of the company. I have been theory crafting all weekend, reading every fucking DD, Discussion, and Shitpost since August 2020 post to this god-forsaken Subreddit and there is one simple fact that is currently not being discussed. I'll start off with a TL,DR and then go from there.\n\nTL,DR: Bears are undeniably fucked, You control the power, GME is not going to the moon, but to the edge of the fucking observable universe.\n\nLet's go, Gamestop has a NEGATIVE Float. There is likely not an original Gamestop issued share left on the market. What do I mean? Per my last post, I told you that there are approx 69.75 million OG shares, and approx \\~75 Million shares owned by insiders (board of directors)/top 10 institutions\\[1\\]. meaning the likelihood of the shares that you, me, and DeeEffVee own are a shorted share. What I failed to emphasize, is the ABSOLUTE SHEER MAGNITUDE of the situation. There is no way that shorts can get themselves out of it. They're only going to be buying back their shorted shares which, since they are above 100%, there is no way to do that, unless institutions sell off everything they own into the open market. Which is unlikely, as institutions are in it for a long haul, but there may be some trimming on the way up. \n\nI've commonly simplified this potential squeeze as 100 PS5s(common shares) and 134 PS5 buyers(shorts), but I've had an epiphany that it is wrong. The 100 PS5s are already purchased, sitting in the institution/insider's homes and more than likely, the shares that are out there being traded have been created by the shorts. Where the fuck am I going with this? THERE ARE NO PS5s LEFT AND EVERYTHING THAT YOU AND I ARE PLAYING WITH IS A SHORTED SHARE. THERE IS NO TRUE FLOAT LEFT, AND NOW WE ARE PLAYING AROUND WITH FUCKING IOUs. We still have legal ownership, and voting power with our shares, but they've been created out of the borrowing process of shorting a share, and not a genuine OG share. I reiterate, Gamestop is essentially in a Negative float % position.\n\nNow, what does that mean for the outcome of the situation? bringing up some data that u/TitusSupremus provided on his last post, we can see that of the 79,519,042 shorted shared, 68% or 54,168,330 of all shorted shares are shorted on margin. Some of which are naked shorted shares, which of course, is an illegal activity when not covered within a 3 day timeframe. (we are at trading day #27.) With many brokerages starting to increase their margin requirements, and maintenance %'s. Brokers will force a buy-to-close on short positions on behalf of the shorts. This is going to cause a snowball effect, coupled with the SEC 201 (Up-Tick Rule enacted until EOD Tuesday 01/19/2021).\n\nI have two theories of what may happen tomorrow/this week\n\n1)Margin call happens, we have an increase of buying pressure due to all you loyal GME DiamondHands, along with retail and investment F.O.M.O., ALONG WITH MARGIN CALLED SHORTS WHO CAN'T CLEAR UP ENOUGH CAPITAL TO COVER THEIR POSITIONS, all the buying pressure means that price goes up and our friend SEC 201, more brokers are going to buy-to-close, etc. etc. taking us well beyond $420.69 and into the territory of whatever price you want to sell at. \n\n2)We remain fairly flat, since shorts can only sell on the up-tick, throughout the day, as brokers are allowing shorts to clear up capital on other investments to cover their margin call. More illegal shorting occurs, and shorts double down on their position even greater. Wednesday and beyond, just spikes and dips like we\u2019ve seen since last week on an upward trend. \n\nPositions: 1000 shares @ 15.84\n\n\\[1\\][ https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/holders?p=GME](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/holders?p=GME)",

Thus, I propose a complaint campaign to get someone (cough, perhaps a government body who was designed to look into shit just like this, cough) to do something. \n\nWe can submit complaints here:\n\n [https://www.sec.gov/tcr](https://www.sec.gov/tcr) \n\nThere is literally an exact category for this (\"Manipulation of a Security\" and then select \"Abusive Naked Short Selling\"). \n\nI'm a simpleton autist, I don't get fancy with my words but I've drafted a basic letter here that you can use:\n\n*To whom it may concern,*\n\n*This letter serves to bring the SEC\u2019s attention to suspected illegal activity in GameStop Corporation\u2019s (ticker GME) trading. As a shareholder in GME, I have concerns about illegal naked short selling and increasing failure-to-deliver rates in the month of December 2020 through present day. GME has consistently appeared on the NYSE Threshold Security list for the last 18 trading days. In order to appear on the threshold list, a stock has to have 0.05% of outstanding shares fail-to-deliver, for GameStop this amounts to roughly 350,000 shares.* ***GME\u2019s failure to-delivery rates have exceed this amount on most trading days in December 2020****.* ***Furthermore, on at least three trading days in December,*** ***the total number of shares failed-to-deliver exceeded 1 million****. Below is a summary of trading days in December which had exceptionally high failures-to-deliver:*\n\n*12/1: 91,971 @ $16.56*\n\n*12/2: 1,061,397 @ $15.80*\n\n*12/3: 1,787,191 @ $16.58*\n\n*12/4: 999,475 @ $16.12*\n\n*12/7: 1,002,379 @ $16.90*\n\n*12/8: 872,292 @ $16.35*\n\n*12/9: 721,361 @ $16.94*\n\n*12/10: 605,975 @ $13.66*\n\n*12/11: 880,063 @ $14.12*\n\n*12/14: 284,296 @ $13.31*\n\n*Given the data presented above, I request the SEC to further investigate suspected illegal naked short-selling in GME, particularly as it concerns Melvin Capital, who holds a substantial short position in the Company.*\n\nNow as an autist, I don't even know if I've fully got the concept down but I think I'm close enough. Would love feedback if anyone with a big brain has any.\n\nTLDR: Big money is playing illegal games on GME. We need to bring that shit to light",

I'm not even entirely sure what I can and can not say as of now. Nuking of subs is building up steam. We will either have to drop the subculture and become highly moderated, (basically, memes + r/options) or get axed.  \n\nJust today that guy, who posted a highly suspicious post about Nio went all over reddit blaming WSB for racism (yeah, the sub that basically worships Lisa Su is somehow racist against Asians now). We all know how this can escalate. Easier mental gymnastics was used to ban uncomfortable subs.  \n\nI address this question to the mods and the general community. Do we have a plan for this scenario? Discord is fine, but no adequate discussion is possible there. And Discord isn\u2019t exactly a stronghold of free speech.  \n\nIDK what can it be. Signal? Telegram? (my personal favorite: they fought and won censorship in Iran, Belarus and Russia. If I got it right, Russia literally blocked half of the internet trying to ban them). 4Chan? Mastodon? Separate web forum?\n\nMaybe we adopt to whatever the new rules are? Or we just go on with blazing guns until the music ends?  \n\nI know similar topics were raised earlier, but it seems that the whole situation is evolving and having some guidance regarding the future of the sub would be much appreciated.",

Let me remind you.\n\n\nMelvin Capital bet that GameStop would go bankrupt. If it had, those assholes would've been dancing in their New York offices, popping champagne and laughing, completely aware of the damage they were rejoicing in. They tried to capitalize on a global pandemic as the final nail in the coffin for yet another retail company that wouldn't change.\n\n\nOn the other side, things would've been pretty grim. GameStop workers make, what, slightly more than minimum wage? They are probably completely unaware of companies like Melvin Capital who hope their employer goes out of business. They're just trying to make a buck.\n\n\nNot this time.\n\n\nGameStop may have an outdated business model that hasn't adapted to 2011, let alone 2021, but it's an American institution. Every single one of us has walked into a GameStop at least once and bought a game we were excited about. Our little brothers and sisters would beg us to take them there to buy the 80th edition of Pokemon Red/Blue/Yellow/Gold/whatever. We've all perused a Game Informer, hoping to see a 10 rating. You can shit on them for charging too much or not paying enough for a used game, but you don't hope their people go on unemployment.\n\n\n\nSo Melvin Capital and short sellers (lol [Frankfurt School Associates](https://i.redd.it/wxohwokyrab61.jpg)) can go fuck themselves.

        "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nI'm going to use this space to say what I would expect Tues/Wed regarding GME (obviously not an expert).\n\n# First some facts:\n\n1) There was an obscene amount of shorts of GME before it went up last week (138%+ of float). There is now still an EVEN MORE obscene amount of shorts of GME (120-170% of float as high-quality estimates).\n\n2) There has been over a month of likely \"naked short selling.\" Aka, ILLEGAL market manipulation (Sells of unconfirmed shares that then end up not going through) in an attempt to further drive down price (27 days on NYSE Threshold securities list, since Dec 8th).\n\n3) Fees to borrow GME have gone up significantly (sitting around 30% atm) and required margins have increased at brokers (75% for Fidelity, 100% for Schwab). This means those brokers are less confident in it going down, and that there are less available shares floating around (lower volumes).\n\n4) Friday, there was a huge early shorting of the stock (the rapid 10% drop) that led to Rule 201 being invoked (stock can only be shorted on an uptick until EOD Tuesday). How do I know it was likely shorting? Because the drop stopped as soon as the Rule was invoked.\n\n# From these facts, what are conclusions I have drawn?\n\n1) Investors (firms or otherwise) who have shorted GME are **repeatedly doubling down**. Big players are doing so to directly (and sometimes illegally, see naked short selling above) manipulate the market in a downward direction. **They have been working on this for months, making the stock undervalued by far,  which is why short volume has been so high, and are continuing to manipulate this stock downward in an attempt to make those earlier shorts less of a failure.**\n\n2) They believe the current price increase will not be sustained or, more like IMHO, that they can out-short any increase that is sustained, so they are paying increasing fees on those shorts every day until the price drops enough (and it needs to drop A LOT for their earlier shorts).\n\n# So what do I think will happen Tues/Wed?\n\n**1) On Tuesday, SEC Rule 201 is still in effect. That means that short sellers can only sell shorts on \"upticks\" (aka, they can only short at prices above the current market price). I expect that those short sellers will continue to double down, so we may see a price ceiling come into effect. Every time the price increases, the shorting can happen so they'll short it. I expect volume will be relatively low, and the price will not move very far.**\n\n**2) On Wednesday, SEC Rule 201 is not in effect yet. If price moves significantly upwards on Tues, I would almost definitely expect an early short on Wednesday in an attempt to drive small profit selling and further drop the price. If price moves significantly downward on Tues, I would expect the same early shorting in an attempt to induce panic selling. Finally, if price doesn't move much on Tuesday, its much more of a toss-up on their strategy, but I would (personally) anticipate another attempt to short sell the price down as we saw Friday (deep pockets of shorters, already in very deep on shorts).**\n\n**TL;DR: I think shorters gonna keep shorting (legally and illegally) so everyone should be prepared for that. They think the risks of losing older shorts outweighs the risks of additional shorting/the fees of new/old shorts. They've done this level of consistent, repetitive shorting/market manipulation before and have only paid for it a handful of times.**\n\nJust sharing my opinion of what happens next. I'm not here to convince anyone to do anything.\n\nGME 266 at 36.54",

        "selftext": "# Company Overview\n\nPalantir technologies is an American software company founded in 2003 and headquartered in Colorado that specializes in big data analytics.\n\nThey started building software for the intelligence community in the US to assist in counterterrorism investigations by helping them identify patterns hidden deep within large datasets.\n\nLater they realized that similarly to the intelligence community, commercial institutions did not have the most effective tools to manage and make sense of the data involved in large projects.\n\nPalantir has now developed two principal software platforms, Palantir Gotham which serves primarily the intelligence community, and Palantir Foundry for commercial purposes.\n\nPalantir went public on September 30, 2020 through a direct public offering. The company opened for trading at $10 a share, giving it an initial valuation of about $22B. As of the date of this publishing, Palantir stock is trading at $25.98, with a Market Cap of $44.26B, and 52-w high of $33.50.\n\n# Understanding the Business\n\n**Value Proposition**\n\nInstitutions often rely on various single-purpose software solutions which support the specific workflows of their operations such as customer relationship management and financial planning. Each new software creates a new silo within an already fragmented data landscape.\n\nWhen it comes to making operational decisions, institutions are left spending significant time and resources to unify their data. By the time the question is answered, the underlying data may be stale.\n\nA central operating system for data\n\nPalantir\u2019s software allows institutions to reorganize the various independent data systems that support their operations into a unified data asset which facilitates advanced data analysis, knowledge management, and collaboration.\n\nAugmenting existing data systems, not displacing\n\nAt a large manufacturer, Palantir does not build machine production ERP software, instead, Palantir\u2019s software connects their production ERP data with other relevant systems. By integrating existing solutions into our central operating system, organizations can choose to maintain key historic investments without having to rebuild their entire data infrastructure.\n\nMaking data actionable\n\nGotham and Foundry enable their users to put data in context, using language that people understand. They transform data into objects that make sense to everyone in an organization. Data is represented not as cells in a spreadsheet, or exports from a single system, but as entities, events, relationships, consequences, and decisions.\n\nTheir ontology management systems allow organizations to create their own description of the world, starting from a set of basic components: objects (such as people or events), properties (attributes), and relationships that tie objects together.\n\nUnderstand the history of data and decisions\n\nPalantir\u2019s software tracks each piece of data in the system to its source and records all changes that have been made to a dataset or data object. Users can distinguish between data derived from a source system or data created by another user, and if a dataset has been updated/modified, the user can also identify the fact that the data was updated, the action, and the logic used to perform the update. This allows users to easily explain where the data, logic, and decisions originate.\n\nEnable users to work together even in the most complex circumstances\n\nThe versioning and branching capabilities of their software enables thousands of users across departments and organizations to work on the same datasets, and actively collaborate on new models and analysis.\n\nUsers can safely branch a view or a dataset into an isolated sandbox where the user is able to build or experiment as they wish and may merge successful experiments back into the main dataset. Each version of a dataset is saved so that it remains protected and available for concurrent access.\n\nEnforce rigorous and reliable data protection\n\nPalantir\u2019s software was designed to embrace the complexity of security clearances, institutional boundaries, and varying data sensitivity levels. Organizations are able to secure each piece of information and define the privileges users require to perform a specific action on a specific resource. The central authorization system creates an audit trial of user activity which allows oversight officials to monitor behavior, identify potential violations, and investigate anomalies.\n\nAI/ML and operational change through data-driven decisions\n\nTheir software infrastructure also enables organizations to combine simple math, third-party black box models, and machine trained models of the different components of their businesses in a graph made up of nodes (for example, each node can be a manufacturing unit and distribution site in a supply chain) where each model can describe the properties of a node, resulting in an interactive digital simulation of an entire supply chain.\n\nThe AI/ML interface surfaces critical information about models, including plots, validation statistics, model stages, parameters and metadata.\n\n**Revenue Streams**\n\nPalantir\u2019s revenue streams consists of their two main software, Gotham which was designed primarily for the defense and intelligence sectors, and Foundry for the commercial sector. However, the platforms are not exclusive to either sector, for example, Gotham is also offered to commercial customers in the financial services industry. The two platforms can either be used separately or bundled together as a single ecosystem.\n\nCurrently, revenue is more or less evenly split between the government and commercial sector.\n\nIt is important to note that for the government sector Palantir has to participate through a procurement process against other contractors who also sell custom tools.\n\nGotham\n\nIts main tools include:\n\nGraph \u2013 a whiteboard like interface for users to explore, visualize, and interact with entities, their properties and their networks. Users can create or edit data in the graph and resolve duplicate objects to ensure robust data quality.\n\nGaia \u2013 lets users plan, execute, and report on operations via a shared live map. Live maps track real-time data and users drag and drop objects from other Gotham applications directly into Gaia.\n\nDossier \u2013 is a live collaboration document editor to share analysis and discover intelligence. Users can collaborate across teams and organizations to create a living, interactive, and up-to-date document.\n\nVideo \u2013 an application designed to interact with both streaming and historical video data. Users can review video footage in the platform as well as enhance raw footage with geospatial information and overlays based on other data sources.\n\nAva \u2013 an AI system which scans billions of data points in order to proactively assist investigations by alerting users to new, hard-to-find potential connections.\n\nMobile \u2013 brings Gotham into the field via mobile devices to provide support to real-time, distributed operations.\n\nFoundry\n\nMonocle \u2013 enables users to understand data lineage using a graphical interface. Users can explore upstream dependencies or downstream consumers of data, as well as trace logic for a dataset back to its source.\n\nContour \u2013 enables top down exploration of large-scale data. Users may filter, join, and visualize datasets to answer analytical questions and publish the results as a report or new dataset that will automatically update with the underlying datasets.\n\nObject Explorer \u2013 allows users to interact with data represented as objects \u2013 like customers, equipment, or plants \u2013 rather than rows in a table.\n\nFusion \u2013 Foundry\u2019s spreadsheet environment.\n\nReports \u2013 allows users to publish their work from other applications in a document that dynamically updates as the underlying data changes.\n\nI strongly suggest watching [Palantir\u2019s demo day](https://palantir.events/livedemoday) on January 26 to gain a better understanding of the tools provided by both software.\n\nPalantir\u2019s Software Example Use Cases\n\n* Humanitarian workers plan disaster relief missions following a natural disaster.\n* Investigators receive alerts about open cases when new data about a suspect enters any system.\n* Automotive plant engineers detect defects at their station while vehicles are still on assembly line.\n* District attorney map out complex criminal networks in order to decide where to focus resources.\n* Scientists use a unified view of cancer patients to personalize care.\n\n# Industry\n\n**Market Size**\n\nAs of Q3 2020 Palantir had 132 customers across 36 industries around the world.\n\nCurrently, according to Palantir\u2019s own estimates the Total Addressable Market (TAM) for their software across the commercial and government sectors around the world is approximately $119B. The TAM for the government sector is $63B and for the commercial sector $56B. Within the government TAM, $37B is international and $26B is domestic.\n\nAccording to [Statista\u2019s market forecast](https://www.statista.com/outlook/14000/100/software/worldwide) revenue in the software market is expected to grow at an annual growth rate of 7.4% between 2021 and 2025.\n\n**Industry Fundamentals**\n\nEmbrace digital transformation or risk getting disrupted\n\nIt has become evident that companies which embrace digital transformation persist, while businesses that fail to transform or transform too late will disappear. According to a [Harvard Business Review report](https://hbr.org/sponsored/2017/07/digital-transformation-is-racing-ahead-and-no-industry-is-immune-2) digital disruption extinguished 52% of Fortune 500 companies between 2000 and 2017.\n\nWe have repeatedly seen that pathbreaking institutions that use data to transform their core operations are the ones that win.\n\nBuy or Build\n\nInstitutions often resort to the default approach of attempting to build a custom solution themselves. However, according to a recent [report by The Standish Group](https://www.standishgroup.com/about), of 50,000 custom software projects from more than a 1,000 organizations, only 23% that were started from scratch were completed on time and on budget, while 56% of all projects were either overdue or over budget. Additionally, only 12% of organization-wide digital transformation projects were considered successful.\n\nAdditionally, according to the [NewVantage Partners 2020 Big Data and AI Executive Survey](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200106005280/en/NewVantage-Partners-Releases-2020-Big-Data-and-AI-Executive-Survey), business adoption of Big Data continues to be a struggle, with 73.4% of firms citing this as an ongoing challenge.\n\nPalantir provides the example of a U.S. Military department which spent more than $1 billion building an enterprise resource planning system from scratch. The system was never delivered, and the project was terminated.\n\nCrisis &amp; Instability\n\nA [survey from AppDynamics](https://www.appdynamics.com/blog/news/agents-of-transformation-report-2020/) reports that 71% of IT professionals said COVID-19 has caused their businesses to implement digital transformation projects within weeks rather than the typical months or years, and 65% of respondents said they implemented digital transformation projects during the pandemic that had been previously dismissed.\n\n# Competitive Landscape &amp; Risks\n\n**Competition**\n\nPalantir\u2019s main competitors include:\n\nInternal software development \u2013 At first, organizations frequently attempt to build their own data platforms with the help of consultants, IT services companies, packaged and open-source software, and sizable internal IT resources.\n\nAnd two software companies with very similar business models:\n\n[Alteryx](https://www.alteryx.com/) \u2013 founded 23 years ago and based in California, Alteryx is a public company with FY 2019 revenues of $418M and more than 1,290 employees. Alteryx is focused on providing solutions to the commercial sector and as of 2019 they had approximately 6,100 customers in more than 90 countries. Amongst their main customers are Chevron Corporation, Federal National Mortgage Association, Nasdaq Inc, Netflix, salesforce.com, Toyota, Twitter, and Uber Technologies.\n\n[Semantic AI](https://www.semantic-ai.com/company) \u2013 is a privately-held software firm based in California, Semantic AI was founded in 2001 and after 9/11 it was used as \u201cplatform by choice\u201d by the intelligence community. Similar to Palantir, they have gained significant adoption in the Defense and Law Enforcement communities and have recently launched their enterprise intelligence platform.\n\n**Competitive Strategy**\n\nCustomer acquisition\n\nPalantir\u2019s customer acquisition strategy targets large-scale, hard-to-execute opportunities at large government and commercial institutions. The high installation costs, high failure risks, complexity of data environments, and the long sales cycle associated with these opportunities raise the barriers to entry for competition.\n\nAdditionally, in the first phase of Palantir\u2019s customer acquisition strategy, they provide minimal risk to their customers through short-term pilot deployments of their software at no or low cost to them. As the customer increases the usage of the platform across its operations, Palantir\u2019s revenue and margins grow significantly.\n\nSoftware engineers on the front line\n\nIn order to fully address the most complex challenges of their customers, Palantir sends their Forward Deployed Engineers (FDEs), in order to experience and understand the problem firsthand. By working alongside their customers, FDEs gain a deep understanding of their needs, how and why they make decisions, and how they calculate trade-offs.\n\nLeverage experience in both private and public sector\n\nTo the commercial sector, Palantir offers software which was designed to be secure enough to handle national secrets and stable enough to support soldiers\u2019 wartime decisions. To the government sector, they offer software which incorporates and reflects Palantir\u2019s experience of working across 36 industries and years spent in the field.\n\nPalantir\u2019s strategic relationships last for years\n\nBy the end of 2019, Palantir\u2019s top 20 customers had an average relationship of 6.6 years.\n\nPalantir has chosen sides\n\nTheir software is exclusively available to the United States and its allies in Europe and around the world.\n\n**Growth Strategy**\n\nBecome the industry default\n\nPalantir\u2019s current and potential customers are some of the largest enterprise in the world. They intend to broaden the platform\u2019s reach through partnerships that establish their platforms as the central operating system for entire industries.\n\nThis model has been successfully implemented in the aviation industry where, through its partnership with Airbus, work with more than a 100 airlines and 15 airline suppliers.\n\nContinue to grow their direct sales force\n\nPalantir\u2019s decision to grow their sales force in recent years has resulted in a number of significant new customers, including Fortune 100 companies as well as a number of leading government agencies in the U.S. and other countries.\n\nIncrease their reach with existing customers\n\nTo drive revenue growth at an account, Palantir uses a number of sales and marketing strategies which include:\n\n* Creating partnerships to extend the platform beyond the customer\u2019s four walls into the operations of their partners and suppliers\n* Selling additional productized cross-industry software capabilities\n* Selling strategic implementations of Palantir\u2019s software against specific use cases\n\nFor Q3 2020 Palantir\u2019s average revenue per customer had increased 38% compared to the same period last year.\n\nBecome the default operating system for the U.S. government\n\nPalantir\u2019s software has been tested and improved over years of use across industries and various government agencies in the U.S. who have been able to deploy Palantir\u2019s platforms rapidly with minor configurations.\n\nPalantir already works with government agencies such as the U.S. Army, Navy, and Airforce, CDC, Department of Homeland Security, FDA, and SEC.\n\nNew methods of customer acquisition and partnership\n\nAs Palantir considers growing into new markets outside the U.S., they may consider entering into partnerships with strategic organizations that operate in their target market.\n\nFor example, in Japan they launched a partnership with SOMPO Holdings, Inc.. one of the largest insurance companies in the country, to help grow their commercial and government business in the Japanese market.\n\n**Moats**\n\nR&amp;D expenditure\n\nSince 2008 and up to 2019, they have invested a total of $1.5B in research and development.\n\nNetwork effects\n\nEvery data source that is integrated to the system, and every action taken by a developer, data scientist, or operational user, is made accessible to all other users at the institution.\n\nAt a financial services customer, network effects enabled Palantir\u2019s software to scale from a single use case to more than 70 workstreams across compliance, front office, risk, and internal audit desks. Each new application was built on a shared foundation of integrated systems, user groups, and existing applications.\n\nAdditionally, each customer on their platform generates network effects. Palantir can leverage the knowledge acquired and capabilities developed for a customer within a specific industry and incorporate it into the platform for the benefit of all customers across industries. For example, capabilities of Palantir\u2019s platform that were originally developed to help optimize production of crude oil, has been adapted by manufacturers of medical equipment to optimize supply chains.\n\nIn addition to supporting individual institutions, Palantir\u2019s platforms have the capacity to become the central operating system for entire industries and sectors.\n\nRegulation\n\nSection 2377 of the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act (\u201cFASA\u201d) requires the U.S. government to first consider readily available commercial items before pursuing acquisition of custom developed items. Palantir\u2019s software is a commercial item within the meaning of the law. A custom government solution built by a consulting company, is not.\n\nIn 2016, Palantir won a lawsuit against the Army, challenging its decision to pursue a software development contract for the replacement of its battlefield intelligence system. In 2018, the ruling was upheld, and the US Court of Appeals ordered the Army to consider existing commercially available products. After testing real products, the Army selected Palantir\u2019s software to deploy tactical units across the force.\n\n**Other Relevant Risks**\n\nPrivacy and civil liberties\n\nPalantir is not in the business of collecting, mining, or selling data. They build software platforms that enable customers to integrate their own data \u2013 data they already have. Palantir claims to be committed to ensuring their software is effective as possible while preserving individuals\u2019 fundamental rights to privacy and civil liberties.\n\nCustomer concentration\n\nFor the 9 months ended September 2020, Palantir\u2019s top 3 customers accounted for 27% of their revenue.\n\n# Financial Summary\n\n**Proforma Balance Sheet**\n\n[https://postimg.cc/ykzC91FN](https://postimg.cc/ykzC91FN)\n\n**Income Statement**\n\n[https://postimg.cc/yD1qQLp4](https://postimg.cc/yD1qQLp4)\n\nPalantir\u2019s revenue has had a CAGR of 68.8% since inception, and 27.6% for the last three years.\n\nFor the 9 months ended September 2020 compared to the same period last year:\n\n* Revenue of the government sector increased by $177M (73%), of the increase 84% was from existing customers.\n* Revenue of the commercial sector increased by $80M (30%).\n* COGS, Sales and Marketing, R&amp;D, and SG&amp;A expense increases consist primarily of an increase in stock-based compensation expense primarily due to recognition of cumulative stock-based compensation expense upon the Direct Listing related to the company\u2019s restricted stock units. The increase was partially offset by a decrease in traveling expense related to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nPalantir uses a Contribution Margin as a key business metric to evaluate their financial performance, which has improved consistently over the last 4 quarters. In short, by achieving a higher contribution margin, the increase in revenue required for Palantir to break-even is smaller.\n\n**Proforma Cashflow Statement**\n\n[https://postimg.cc/64CsSgNw](https://postimg.cc/64CsSgNw)\n\nFor the 9 months ended September 2020:\n\nNet cash provided by financing activities consist primarily of proceeds from the issuance of common stock\n\n# Investment Decision\n\n**Valuation Results**\n\n[https://postimg.cc/kBF3v0cv](https://postimg.cc/kBF3v0cv)\n\nThe result of my [Valuation Model](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zMy8dkNFib7h-FkFtPZMf9bhH8DjE3XKf5t-HB_c5eY/edit?usp=sharing) indicate a **Value of Equity per share of $28.38**\n\nMayor assumptions of the valuation model include:\n\n* By 2031, Palantir will gain 6% Market Share of a $119B market that grows 7.4% annually. This implies Palantir\u2019s revenue will grow at a CAGR of 30% for 10 years.\n* Palantir will achieve US GAAP operating margins of 23% by 2031.\n* Terminal year growth rate of 5% and WACC of 7.5% after reaching a Beta of 1.0.\n* Risk free rate of 2.5% and Equity Risk Premium of 5.5%\n\nFollow the link to view the valuation model, it include references to all assumptions. Please feel free to download it, play with it, and share your conclusions.\n\n**Investment Decision**\n\nI believe that at its current price PLTR is a buy opportunity for the following reasons:\n\n* The model\u2019s revenue and margin growth assumptions are achievable and likely to be exceeded if PLTR successfully executes their growth strategies.\n* The industry is driven by strong fundamentals, organizations that do not embrace digital transformation and big data will cease to exist.\n* Even though Palantir\u2019s moat is currently narrow, it could expand significantly if they are successful in establishing their software as a central operating system for various industries.",

        "selftext": "Long time first time yada yada yada... tldr at bottom\n\nSo did you see what all those stupid articles on whatever ad-infested websites were saying yesterday?? \u201cGameStop soars another 50% from EPIC short squeeze, up 69% (nice) at time of halt.\u201d You see this and think omg it\u2019s actually happening. Wrong. Anyone with half a brain that doesn\u2019t use the word retard while writing an article can work for those asinine media companies. So while a couple of us are partly qualified for those jobs and are able to fit the rectangle block in the rectangle hole, our pristine vernacular of the English language may have us shown the door (maybe the same one our friend at the helm of Citron is on his way through). Now even a former Boglehead like me should be able to figure out that the short squeeze has not been mcsquozen. Quick quote before we get into things...\n\nI think it was Denzel Washington who once said \u201cIf you don\u2019t read the newspaper, you\u2019re uninformed. But if you do read the newspaper, you\u2019re misinformed.\u201d Definitely something to think about in this day and age. \n\nAnyway moving on. As probably many people at this point have already said, what happened on Friday was a gamma squeeze. This comes from MM\u2019s having to hedge from all of us degenerates buying options. They however work a little differently than us when it comes to limiting their exposure. Us morons have to have 100 shares of a stock to be able to sell a covered call against it. If we had less than 100 shares, we may as well be as naked as the GameStop shorts. There\u2019s this little guy called delta (frankly if you don\u2019t know the Greeks it may be wise to take a quick break from options and learn those little buggers) that MM\u2019s use as their indicator of how many shares they need to limit their exposure. Delta is a number between 0 and 1. Say you buy an option and the delta is .41, MM\u2019s have to buy 41 shares to limit their downward exposure. But as the share price moves closer to the strike price, delta will increase and thus the MM\u2019s will have to buy a few more shares (and vice versa with price moving down). So with the sheer amount of those otm options purchased yesterday (looking at you 55-60 calls), MM\u2019s had to hedge accordingly, but as more people bought those calls as the price became closer and closer to the strike, it created a fun feedback loop where the MM\u2019s were then forced purchase those additional shares as delta increased. So then after the halts, call buyers near and far took their profits which caused the MM\u2019s to unwind their exposure bringing the stock price back down. If you bought $3,000 worth of 60c 0DTE and sold at the right time, you would\u2019ve made a cool million+ (I know right what the fuck?!?!). So could this happen again next Friday? If a lot people expect a gamma squeeze like this to happen and buy a shitload of way otm calls, then it could be a self-fulfilling prophecy and there will be many new millionaires made next Friday. I personally have some PLTR calls I\u2019ll be selling next week after demo day to try and fuck around with some 0DTE\u2019s and most likely get burned lol. But don\u2019t you ever listen to someone who says they know exactly where a stock price is going in the future and always do your own DD. \n\nAnyone else find it very odd that the highest strike price call option was only $60, AND THAT IT FINISHED ITM???? Either way calls with new strikes have been written (anyone see those 1/29 115\u2019s lmao). \n\nSo moving forward into next week, don\u2019t be scared or discouraged if we have some relatively flatter days, we\u2019ve been \ud83d\udc8e \ud83d\udd90 this far. Personally I would sort of like to see GME consolidate a little bit in the beginning part of the week (this is healthy for a stock - increasing exponential growth of +50% every day, while it looks just dandy on your account, cannot be kept up at any longer term rate). Also, as of today GME has 8 more days for their fourth quarter earnings. You know what this means? Buy PowerUp rewards, buy a console for your wife\u2019s bf (preferably a bundle), buy used games (maximize profit margin), or fuck even buy Thor\u2019s battle axe and use it as a butt plug for all I care (we know after the past two weeks that\u2019s about the only thing that will fucking fit). An unexpected revenue and earnings beat, as well as profitability, may absolutely send this thing to the stratosphere. Why is nobody talking about Reggie as well as our three wise men from RC Ventures??? \n\nAs a side note there\u2019s also a lot of new blood entering from this publicity. Be nice to them -we were all beginners at one time so answer their questions, as basic as they may seem. Also be careful about what DD\u2019s you may read, they could be using this platform for their own malicious benefit rather than the good of the group. \n\nTL;DR - gamma squeeze made some people rich as fuck, may happen again next Friday but it also may not. Don\u2019t be scared of consolidation next week. Buy some shit from GameStop in the next eight days. Squeeze has not been squozed. \n\nAnd finally, thank the O.G. GME gang for the hundreds, probably even thousands of hours they collectively put in to help us all.\n\nBe patient, be well. \n\n*sighs* \ud83d\ude80\ud83e\udd5c\n\nPositions: \n1541 GME shares bought at 13, 17, 18, 32, 35, 42, 52, 66(lol)\n5 GME 1/21/2022 30c\n609 PLTR shares bought at 19, 24, 26, 27\n10 PLTR 5/21 40c\nAnd energy and metals/mining mutual funds????",

I work in Venture Capital and am doing well at it.\n\nLemonade caught my attention because I summarized the S1 in details at IPO, for my personal learning. The S1 specifically states that because of reinsurance - gross margin for the business is stuck closely around 20% (reinsurance basically provides a floor but also caps potential profit if loss ratios come down).\n\nNow - take a quick look at Bloomberg consensus. The company trades at 53x EV / 2022E Consensus Revenue as of tonight (yes, 53x FORWARD revenue)\n\nIf we put a 20% gross margin on this revenue (because of reinsurance there is virtually no chance the company significantly exceeds that!) the company basically trades at 250x EV / 2022 Gross Profit.\n\nTWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY TIMES 2022E (normalised) GROSS PROFIT.\n\nI am speechless that the Motley Fool can recommend such a stock to its customers.

My personal opinion is that this is bound to end badly in the next 2y (bar acquisition scenario, but I don\u2019t see who would fork out 100x 2020 revenue for that business).

        "selftext": "The last few months have been quite eventful for uranium investors, with shares of companies all across the sector appreciating in value substantially. There have been many reasons why this is the case and it feels different to just being strong seasonality. Below are 15 \u2018first time\u2019 things to look out for in this sector to start the year with, with full credit going to John Quakes (@quakes99 on Twitter), a retired earth sciences researcher, professor, analyst, writer and one of the best public sources for news about the uranium sector. I share his view that 2021 will prove to be an incredible year for the uranium sector and subsequently for anyone invested in it. Now, onto the aforementioned \u2018first times\u2019: \n\nFirst time entering a new year with uranium already in a record supply deficit, which is set to deepen further with 2 major mines permanently closing this year in Australia and Niger (\\~7 million pounds, gone). At the same time, demand for nuclear energy has remained strong throughout the COVID-19 pandemic and continues to grow in a global shift to decarbonize industry dependent on fossil fuels.\n\nFirst time that Cameco, the world\u2019s 2nd largest producer, has begun a new year with every one of its uranium mines in Canada shut down. Both of the world\u2019s 2 largest uranium mines are under care and maintenance, resulting in zero lbs being produced in Canada as we enter 2021. The US is also producing zero lbs while Kazakhstan\u2019s production is at a multi-year low that is likely to continue thru 2022 under the nation\u2019s current flex-down program and pandemic related mining disruptions. All uranium mines in the Ukraine have also been shut down due to the inability of the mine operator to pay the wages of 5000 mine workers.\n\nFist time that at least 3 of the world\u2019s largest uranium producers are forced into buying uranium on the spot market. Cameco is now the largest spot market buyer in the world. World\u2019s largest producer Kazatomprom is now also a spot buyer, as is French Orano given that heir Canadian mills are suspended and their Cominak mine in Africa is heading for closure in March. Inventory held by the world\u2019s largest uranium producers is at rock bottom levels for the first time ever and in need of replenishment this year.\n\nFirst time the US has taken steps to support its domestic uranium mining industry by establishing a strategic uranium reserve, a 10 year buying program (1.5 billion dollars total) whereby the US government will purchase, convert and potentially enrich US mined uranium to create an emergency supply for US reactors. Goal is to ensure at least 2 US uranium mining companies remain active and viable during this time when the commodity price of U3O8 is half the cost of production.\n\nFirst time in several decades that there is strong bipartisan support in the US to rebuild the existing nuclear energy industry and manufacture a new generation of advanced reactors on a global scale, which is seen as a high priority in order to catch up with Russia and China who have become the new world leaders in nuclear energy.\n\nFirst time that uranium equities have entered a bull market when there is an actual supply deficit. The last bull market saw the price of uranium skyrocket on mine floods and other events that created the \u2018fear\u2019 of a supply deficit on the horizon, at a time when the US-Russia Megatons to Megawatts program was still continuing to supply 20m lbs per year to US nuclear utilities, a program that continued until 2021 as the world\u2019s largest virtual uranium mine.\n\nFirst time that a new year begins with spot market supplies significantly depleted. Supply accessible to carry traders has been severely reduced. Kazatomprom no longer sells any lbs into the spot market and Orano\u2019s supply from Canada and Niger is at a record low level, pushing nuclear utilities to secure new long term contracts with producers rather than entering into shorter term contracts with carry traders. Security of supply is a top priority of utilities (whose inventories are estimated to be around 2,5 years\u2019 worth of supply, when the guideline is to never let it drop below 2-3 years given the long time it takes to enrich and deliver the fuel to the reactors).\n\nFirst time that US and European nuclear utilities have begun a new year with inventories drawn down below usual safety margins at the same time that mines supply is in a record deficit and global uranium production is at its lowest level in 12 years. The new 2020 IAEA/NEA uranium Red Book projects that secondary supplies will fall in the future as an overdue utility inventory restocking cycle begins, due to higher levels of contracting, conversion and enrichment that will reduce underfeeding as facilities see their utilization rates rise.\n\nFirst time in several years that there are no geopolitical overhangs holding back the uranium contracting plans of US and European nuclear utilities. There are no potential section 232 actions targeting uranium imports and no sanctions likely against UUN participants (Russia, China, UK, Germany, France) in the JCPOA Iran Nuclear deal. Russia and the US have successfully negotiated a 20-year extension to the Russian Suspension Agreement that will see the US imports from Russia decline over the coming 2 decades. The incoming US administration supports keeping nuclear power plants running and plans to immediately rejoin the Paris Climate Accord, pushing for global net zero emissions by 2050, a process in which nuclear energy will play a major role.\n\nFirst time that nations around the world will be recovering from a global pandemic with massive infrastructure spending programs that include boosting nuclear capacity to achieve net zero carbon emissions goals. A new \u2018nuclear renaissance\u2019 is beginning to take shape on pandemic recovery spending to boost clean energy. The perception of nuclear energy is also changing to that of a safe, reliable, necessary baseload power source that fits with an emerging ESG investing model. Decarbonization has become a new buzz word in the global vocabulary. The \u2018electrification of everything\u2019 from cars, buses, trucks and trains to major industry is the new global target. Sustainability of so-called renewables solar and wind is now being called into question after failures by Germany and California to successfully transition to an economy powered by intermittent energy sources. Higher electricity prices, no net carbon emissions reductions and rolling blackouts have demonstrated how \u2018renewables\u2019 are not able to fulfill their early promise. This might change with new battery technology and better implementation, but we are nowhere near that point yet.\n\nFirst time that uranium stocks are entering a new year on the heels of one of their best performance years since the last bull market. The U3O8 spot price is still one-half the global average cost of production that will incentivize new mines to be built this decade. This signals to investors that we are still at the opening pitch of the first inning of a long game yet to play out. A necessary doubling of the U3O8 commodity price is yet to come.\n\nFirst time that Canada has begun a new year embarking on a small modular reactors build-out program with several provinces pledging to deploy SMR\u2019s to power remote communities, mines and industrial heat applications in the energy industry.\n\nFirst time that nuclear is being viewed as the ideal carbon free high-temperature power source to produce clear hydrogen fuel. US, Russia, Japan and others are looking to leverage their existing nuclear power capacity to produce hydrogen and build high-temperature SMR\u2019s to optimize the use of emissions free nuclear to produce zero emissions hydrogen.\n\nFirst time in decades that there is an emerging surge in acceptance of nuclear  of nuclear energy as necessary to achieve zero carbon emissions goals, with countries like the Netherlands looking to add more capacity after conducting studies showing nuclear is safer and cheaper than variable renewable energy.\n\nFirst time I can recall one of the leading nuclear fuel consultants UxC reporting to their subscribers that uranium is in a 57M lbs mined supply deficit, that utility and supplier inventories are \u201cdeclining at a rapid rate\u201d just as global fuel demand growth is accelerating, a clear signal that a bull market is getting underway.\n\nTLDR: with all the catalysts that are in place, I am of the firm believe that uranium related equities, namely the developers and explorers, will offer returns that will outperform any other broad investment asset class/sector in the market. This is a bold claim to make, but I can\u2019t see any other opportunity that offers even close to the same risk vs reward the uranium sector offers. Read my other posts on the subject to get an idea of what companies you might want to look at and to get an answer to any question you might have. Good luck and here is to a great new year!",

        "selftext": "TLDR: Gamestop is fielding PC build kiosks at a number of stores, BUY GME SHARES ROCKETS OUTBOUND\n\n\nToday I went into Gamestop with the intent of browsing around and using a $25 gift card I got for Christmas like a year ago. I have not been inside a physical GME store since at least 2018 when I bought an Xbox. I immediately noticed that they have a much wider variety of merchandise, everything from games to PC hardware to toys and clothing. So on that note I was looking to buy a new PC gaming headset since I noticed they \"have\" a ton of them. I grabbed one and went to check out. The manager informed me that they don't actually have them in stock or available to order- in fact, most of the items in the store were just display boxes for promotional purposes. I thought this was weird, but she explained that:\n\n**1- They sell in-store items so fast that if they didn't display empty boxes the store would look entirely empty. She gave an example of 200 packs of pokemon cards that sold out completely within 24 hours**\n\n**2- They are reluctant to fill the store with generic items that don't move fast, because that store specifically, among \"3-4 others in the state\" are going to be totally redesigned to accommodate for what she described to me as \"PC building stations\".**\n\n**3- They have been absolutely crushing it with sales and store interest due to COVID. She stated that people are buying things that she has never sold before, like niche Wii remotes and other items.\"**\n\nNow, we have speculated for some time that GME is going to pivot to PC parts and hardware. I noticed that they do stock some PC peripherals and a few components like graphics cards (older models, they had an NVIDIA 1660 in stock) and PSUs. \n\nHOWEVER, I haven't seen or heard anything regarding a full-on build station. The way she described it to me, is that customers will be able to totally spec out a PC gaming rig, and have it shipped directly to their house. She said there will likely be a dedicated store employee there to assist customers and provide advice. THIS IS FUCKING HUGE. Currently, you have to be pretty \"in-the-know\" to spec out a gaming PC properly, and the pricing makes it unrealistic for a lot of gamers. On top of that, I think there is a perception that you need a lot more technical skill to get into PC gaming. What GME is doing will allow the PC gaming market to bust wide open and become more accessible for a lot more people. And finally, some sort of agreement or deal with the big manufacturers (as hinted) would make this even more lucrative!\n\nShe also said that there is a huge push from upper management for store employees to get knowledgeable on PC gaming and hardware- she said management is pushing hard for the company to step into the future. Meanwhile during the 30 minutes I was in the store, probably 10-15 customers came through and bought at least minor items. Keep in mind this is in a strip mall in a Midwestern rust belt town- certainly does not fit the \"Next blockbuster!1!!!\" thesis.\n\nPersonally I believe this is a very bullish move from Gamestop- and bodes well for the future on top of the other well-established information out there. GME is and continues to be an excellent value play, not even accounting for the upcoming short squeeze. It sounds like the vision from Cohen and others at the top is already filtering down to the people charged with carrying it out. I plan to buy at least 50 more shares on Tuesday.\n\n\nPositions: 250 shares @22.30 cost avg, 2x 4/19/21 $30c, 2x 01/29/21 $50c\n\n(Somebody on mobile add the rockets pls)",

        "selftext": "Today was a crazy day.  The whole market is down, nothing makes any sense and all the paper hands probably abandoned the ship before the long weekend.\n\nI am still mad, despite being in profit cuz I have no fucking idea how it is possible for a stock to drop 20 percent after open without crushing negative news. I have never seen something like this. However, there is no room for panic. Apple is expected to have historic earnings in less than 2 weeks and the stock experienced a huge dip today, GME fell hard also and every fucking autist here was buying it. We finished the day at 8 percent up.\n\nI would not judge anyone who sales next week, not everyone needs to be a long term investor, but fuck the paper handed mfos who bought shares today and immediatly sold 1 hour later. How much can you actually lose? The absolute bottom is 4 per share and that would put the company at 2.5 bil valuation. The brand name is worth more than that and BB is a significant player in the IoT, Cybersecurity and EV industries. The cyber firm Crowdstrike has  180 mil revenue compared to BB near 1 billion and is valued at 50 billion, ten times more than BB. If you are gonna paper hand, at least wait till you are an in profit, the retards  who sold GME after the last dip are deeply regretting it now. \n\nPS: Today was tough, but the battle has just began.
