        "selftext": "[Here\u2019s](https://www.reddit.com/r/investmentdata/comments/kj69oo/track_trading_by_us_senators/) the dashboard tracking trading by U.S. Senators.\n\nA while back I did a little write-up on which politicians I actually think browse this sub, I\u2019ll copy that below:\n\n**Honorable Mention: Former Rep. Barbara Comstock (VA-10)**\n\nComstock lost her 2018 re-election bid and I don't necessarily think she is a WSBer (she doesn't trade nearly as many meme stocks as the other guys on this list) but I do blame her for turning off the ATM that was 2016-2018 $MU.\n\nShe bought \\~$75,000 worth of Micron Technology stock on 6/25/18, just days before the first stretch in years when the stock wasn't literally printing money. MU lost half its value in the next 6 months, and still hasn't recovered to the price she purchased it at.\n\n**#5. Rep. Alan Lowenthal (CA-47)**\n\n***Favorite meme stocks: SPCE, GLD***\n\nLowenthal is actually one of the more successful traders on this list, having gotten in to $GLD in September of 2019. He also timed his exit from $SPCE pretty well, selling about half of his position right at the mid-February peak.\n\nIf I had to guess, I'd say Lowenthal just lurks the sub looking for opportunities to inverse WSB.\n\n**#4. Rep. Josh Gottheimer (NJ-5)**\n\n***Favorite meme stocks: SNAP, TSLA, GE, NVDA, LULU, AMD***\n\nThe Josh Gottheimer story is a story of perseverance and diamond hands. I'm pretty sure this guy read some DD on here that said SNAP was going to moon after its IPO, because he bought into the stock just days after it went public. He caught the falling knife right on its tip as his position lost 75% of its value over the next couple years. A lesser man would have cut the loss, but Gottheimer just kept buying up more $SNAP even as it was losing him money. Those of you who have an eye on the markets (perhaps a minority) will know that his grit and determination was rewarded handsomely in the last couple months.\n\n**#3. Sen. Pat Roberts (Kansas)**\n\n***Favorite meme stocks: TSLA, GLD, BYND, NVDA, GE***\n\nPat Roberts is another guy that I think just comes here to inverse the sub. Roberts made an impeccably well-timed TSLA play a few months ago when he bought in on August 3rd, just a few days before the August run-up began and then sold on September 1st, just before the early September drop.\n\nInsider trading or inversing WSB? You decide.\n\nWSB must be big in Kansas, because the next guy up is the fellow who was just elected to fill the vacancy being left by Roberts upcoming departure from the senate.\n\n**#2. Rep. Roger Marshall (KS-1)**\n\n***Favorite meme stocks: JNUG, TSLA, SNAP, MU, ROKU, AMD, NVDA, LULU***\n\nMarshall got a big promotion to the Senate a few days ago, and if that didn't work out he probably would have switched to day-trading full time. He was already day-trading JNUG within a few months of entering office, buying and then selling thousands of dollars worth of the stock between market open and close.\n\nWhat Marshall really lacks is patience, as he recently entered then prematurely exited a position in ROKU in mid-September, missing out on big gains in the weeks to follow.\n\n**#1 Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (Rhode Island)**\n\n***Favorite meme stocks: GME, TSLA, GE, NVDA***\n\nThe story of Sheldon Whitehouse is not a happy story, but it's a story that might be told of many a member of this community. He had the right ideas, but just did not have strong enough hands to see them through.\n\nOn July 28, 2017, Whitehouse entered a position in $TSLA. Seeing a modest 3% gain through the month of August, he doubled down on his position on August 24th, 2017.\n\nAlthough he soon began to lose money as $TSLA sank, in Elon he still trusted, and he bought more $TSLA yet again in December of 2018.\n\nSadly for Whitehouse, we now reach the heartbreaking part of the story. Seeing a 30% loss on the investments into TSLA he'd been making over the last 2 years, Whitehouse lost faith and sold the entirety of the position on August 27th, 2019.\n\nAfter holding TSLA for over 2 years at a loss, he sold within weeks of what would become a yearlong, nearly 1000% run-up.",

Lately every pick I make is going red and every pick I decided not to make is going green big time and I have to admit it's got me a bit paralyzed at the moment. I watch the indexes make new highs and I've seen nothing but red since mid-March. \n\nMy next play was going to be semiconductors. Had a limit order for Micron at 86 and missed it only to see it go up into the 90s. Applied Materials same thing. \n\nIt seems like every trade I go to make, either I don't pull the trigger or I'm way late on the rally trying to buy on the back end of overbought. I know this is pretty much textbook bad investing. \n\nI'm significantly overweight on oil/energy which I am still holding and have some value ETFs but I am afraid to buy anything else.

Keep in mind, I am currently long at higher prices, so I am biased. However, I would like to alert as many people to what I consider a tremendous buying opportunity. Atomera looks ripe for the picking by patient investors, since the stock has retraced 60% from its 52-week high. \n\nShares of Atomera peaked at $47.13 on February 8, 2021.\n\nLike a lot of growth companies, investors have seen shares of Atomera pull back on consolidation, profit taking, and a brutal market for growth companies. Then, along came the shorts. As of March 31, 2021 there were 2,952,916 shares short, according to NASDAQ. The average daily volume on March 31 was 429,749 shares, which means it is going to take the shorts 6.87 days to cover. Many investors are anxiously waiting on the April 15th numbers to come out. Atomera currently has around 20 million shares in the float.\u00a0The total number of shares outstanding was 22.4 million as of December 31, 2020. The proxy has\u00a0updated inside and board holdings on page 13, which is about 14.4%, but those in the list include a portion that is not vested/exercisable, thus, 20 million is in the float. According to the latest information from NASDAQ, there are 71 institutional shareholders who own 5,886,520 shares, or 26.02% of the outstanding shares. On the way to its $47.13 high, shares of Atomera were regularly up several points in a day. In my opinion, I would not want to be short Atomera at these levels. In my opinion, it is time to buy. I am already long the stock, albeit at higher prices, and I am planning on adding to my position. \n\nWhat Atomera does is a little difficult to understand. I believe I have provided a pretty good description of its business model in this report. Atomera has a six phases process with an end result that is the commercialization of wafers that utilize Atomera's Mears Silicon Technology. Once again, Atomera's Mears Silicon Technology bolsters the performance and power efficiency of transistors. \nIn recent months, Atomera announced it has delivered its MST IP transfer package in accordance with a JDA contract. With this advancement, the JDA customer became the first Atomera customer to enter the fourth phase of the six-phase engagement process, which culminates in commercialization of MST-enabled wafers. As I mentioned earlier, Atomera currently has 25 engagements in its customer pipeline, consisting of nine in phase one, 15 in phase three, and one in phase four. Not only do I believe shares of Atomera are heavily shorted and trading deep in oversold territory, it's only a matter of when, not if, Atomera moves additional customers from Phase 3 to Phase 4, which in turn justifies a higher and higher valuation.\n\nMears Silicon Technology\n\nAtomera has developed Mears Silicon Technology, which increases performance and power efficiency in semiconductor transistors. Mears Silicon Technology is a thin film used to enhance semiconductors results in higher performance, lower power, and lower costs. Mears Silicon Technology can be implemented using equipment already deployed in semiconductor manufacturing facilities and is complementary to other nano-scaling technologies already in the semiconductor industry roadmap. Mears Silicon Technology enhances transistors to deliver significantly better performance in today's electronics by using a material that enhances transistors to improve performance. Large semiconductor providers license the technology in order to incorporate Mears Silicon Technology into their silicon wafer manufacturing process. Some of the benefits of Mears Silicon Technology include a longer battery life for mobile phones, making smaller Internet of Things (IoT) devices even smaller, and making web servers even more powerful.\n\nAtomera was founded in 2001 by Robert Mears with a vision to develop a platform of materials technologies for use across multiple industries. In response to the slowdown in the advancement of Moore's Law, Atomera used atomic level material science to develop Mears Silicon Technology which provides multiple benefits to industry participants. Moore's Law was an observation made by Intel co-founder Gordon Moore in 1965. Mr. Moore found the number of transistors on a chip doubles every year, but industry observers have suggested that the trend, which has lasted decades, may soon end. Atomera says that MST extends Moore's Law by allowing semiconductor manufacturers to improve power and efficiency within the same process node. For semiconductor designers Mears Silicon Technology improves performance and power efficiency while potentially reducing cost. For semiconductor fabs, the technology allows them to extend the life of their expensive manufacturing facilities by providing a new, unexpected suite of material improvements within existing process nodes. After several years of research to perfect the technology, Atomera is now engaged with leading semiconductor companies to integrate Mears Silicon Technology into their manufacturing flow.\n\nBusiness Model\n\nAtomera does not intend to design or manufacture integrated circuits directly. Instead, the Company develops and license technologies and processes that its management believes offers the designers and manufacturers of integrated circuits a low-cost solution to the industry's need for greater performance and lower power consumption. Atomera's customers and partners include:\n\nFoundries, which manufacture integrated circuits on behalf of fabless manufacturers.\n\nIntegrated device manufacturers, or IDMs, which are the fully integrated designers and manufacturers of integrated circuits.\n\nFabless semiconductor manufacturers, which are designers of integrated circuits that outsource the manufacture of their chips to foundries.\n\nOriginal equipment manufacturers, or OEMs, which manufacture the epitaxial, or EPI, deposition machines used to deposit semiconductor layers, such as the MST film onto the base silicon wafer.\n\nElectronic design automation companies, which make tools used throughout the industry to simulate the performance of semiconductor products using different materials, design structures and process technologies.\n\nAtomera's revenue model is based on licensing arrangements whereby its customers initially pay the Company a fee for an integration license that provides them the right to use MST technology in the manufacture of silicon wafers for internal testing and sampling. Atomera's management plans for each integration license agreement to be the first of a three-stage licensing process with the customer, with the first integration stage to be followed by one or more agreements granting them manufacturing and distribution licenses. These are referred to as the second and third stages, respectively. Atomera expects that agreements granting manufacturing and distribution licenses will provide for substantially larger upfront license fee payments than the integration licenses and distribution agreements will require licensees to make royalty payments to us based on the number and sales price of MST-enabled products they sell to their customers. Starting in 2019, Atomera began to develop deeper relationships with several large potential customers who were evaluating MST across multiple manufacturing processes and product lines. The Company has begun proposing an engagement format called a joint development agreement, or JDA, to certain customers. Atomera expects that JDAs will be customized to a particular customer's goals but that generally they will include development, manufacturing and licensing components.\n\nAtomera's management believes that the Company's success is dependent upon the adoption of its MST technology through the Distribution stage by at least one IDM, foundry, or fabless semiconductor manufacturer. In January 2021 Atomera entered into a JDA with a leading semiconductor provider for integration of its MST technology into their manufacturing process. The JDA includes the grant of an upfront, paid manufacturing license allowing the customer to install the recipe for Atomera's MST film into a tool in their fab and to fabricate semiconductor wafers incorporating MST for use in their products, as well as development milestones that, if achieved, could result in additional revenue to Atomera. Although this JDA does not confer commercial distribution rights, Atomera's management believes that successful execution would be a significant step toward commercialization and provide opportunities for additional license revenues and potential royalty streams from one or more of its customer's multiple production lines. On March 2, 2021 Atomera announced it advanced its previously announced JDA customer to the fourth phase of its customer engagement process, indicating that Atomera has delivered its MST IP transfer package in accordance with JDA contract. With this advancement, the JDA customer became the first Atomera customer to enter the fourth phase of the six-phase engagement process, which culminates in commercialization of MST-enabled wafers. Atomera currently has 25 engagements in its customer pipeline, consisting of nine in phase one, 15 in phase three, and one in phase four. In its corporate deck, Atomera lists Applied Materials (AMAT) among its partners, as well as Texas Instruments Incorporated (TXN), Micron Technology, Inc. (MU), and Intel (INTC) as its target customers. Upon delivery of Atomera's IP transfer package and issuance of its invoice, the JDA customer will move from phase three into phase four. Subject to process and subsequent product qualifications that demonstrate, in commercial scale production, the enhancements the Company believes its MST technology offers, including increased speed, reliability and energy efficiency. Atomera expects to license its MST technology to one or more of these companies.\n\nThere are currently somewhere around 370 wafer fabs operating worldwide. The adoption of Mears Silicone Technology in one fab can make Atomera profitable from royalties alone. That being said, like a lot of growth companies, Atomera has a history of significant operating losses and the Company anticipates continued operating losses for at least the near term. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, Atomera incurred net losses of approximately $14.9 million and $13.3 million, respectively, and its operations have used approximately $12.1 million and $10.4 million of cash, respectively.\n\nAtomera is also working with OEMs on process development and equipment optimization to ensure that MST can be reliably and predictably deposited using their manufacturing tools. The Company has successfully deposited MST using tools made by each of the leading epitaxial deposition equipment suppliers and management believes that if the Company is successful in its commercialization efforts, these tool OEMs will promote the incorporation of our MST technology as an option to their standard offering. By doing so, it is my opinion they will simultaneously stimulate additional sales of their capital equipment and encourage more customers to adopt MST.\n\nSemiconductor Industry Overview\n\nSemiconductors are included in so many everyday things that there is now a global shortage. The size of the semiconductor industry overall has grown to over $500 billion. As its overall size has increased, the equipment makers that feed it are better positioned to generate strong returns and have seen higher levels of free cash flow. Demand for chips will likely keep the overall sector growing and semiconductor manufacturers will need to continue to increase capital spending to keep pace.\n\nOver the last few years we have seen a tremendous expansion of consumer and commercial products, especially in wireless, automotive and mobile electronic devices. The growth of the Internet and cloud computing has provided people with new ways to create, store and share information. At the same time, the increasing use of electronics in cars, buildings, appliances and other consumer products is creating a broad landscape of \"smart\" devices and the evolution of wearable technologies and The Internet of Things. Due to the popularity of mobile devices and other electronic products, there is increasing demand for integrated circuits and systems with greater functionality and performance, reduced size, and much less power consumption as key requirements. During 2020, the global COVID-19 pandemic accelerated trends toward remote work, cloud computing and mobile devices. These trends coincided with the rollout of 5G cellular networks and 5G-enable devices.\n\nThese developments depend, in large part, on integrated circuits, or microchips, which are sets of electronic circuits on a single chip of semiconductor material, normally silicon. It is common for a single semiconductor chip to combine many components (processor, communications, memory, custom logic, input/output) resulting in highly complex chip designs. Transistors are the building blocks of integrated circuits and the most complex semiconductor chips today contain more than a billion transistors, each of which may have features that are much less than 1/1,000th the diameter of a human hair. The most widely used transistors in semiconductor chips today are based on CMOS technology. Among its many attributes, CMOS allows for a higher density of transistors on a chip and lower power usage than non-CMOS technologies.\n\nBetter Semiconductor Performance\n\nFor years, the semiconductor industry was able to almost double the number of transistors it could pack into a single microchip about every two years, a rate of improvement commonly known as \"Moore's Law.\" The semiconductor industry uses the term \"node\" to describe the minimum line width or geometry on a semiconductor chip, expressed in nanometers, or nm, for today's technologies. Historically, the smaller the node, the smaller the transistors and the more closely they are packed together, producing chips that are denser and thus less costly on a per-transistor basis. Frequently, smaller nodes also correspond to an improvement in chip performance, making them the mile markers of Moore's Law, with each node marking a new generation of chip-manufacturing technology.\n\nUntil recently, the industry succeeded at maintaining the rate of improvement predicted by Moore's Law by scaling the key transistor parameters, such as shrinking feature sizes and reducing operating voltages, thereby allowing more transistors to be packed onto a single microchip. This trend was facilitated in large part by the development of CMOS technologies. However, a discontinuity in the rate of improvement delivered by scaling appeared when transistor technology reached feature sizes below 100 nanometers. The industry responded with advanced materials to supplement the ongoing geometry shrinks. Some of those materials advances included strained silicon, Silicon-on-Insulator and High-K/Metal Gate.\n\nThe designers and manufacturers of integrated circuits and systems - Atomera's targeted customers - are facing intense pressure to deliver innovative products at ever shorter times-to-market, as well as at lower prices. In other words, innovation in chip and system design today often hinges on \"better, sooner and cheaper.\" Atomera's management believes that the semiconductor industry has accepted that moving forward in the nano-era will require adoption of new innovations that extend the scaling formula, including those based on the use of new engineered materials, a market opportunity our MST technology seeks to address. Because shrinking geometries at the smaller nodes incurs higher capital and manufacturing costs, only a limited number of companies can afford to continue investing in those nodes. In my opinion, these constraints will cause semiconductor designers and manufacturers to turn to engineered materials, like MST, to solve this problem.\n\nThe Short Story\n\nThe short interest in the stock may be the biggest catalyst of all. Shares of Atomera have been crushed over the past 10 weeks. As of March 31, 2021 there were 2,952,916 shares short, according to NASDAQ. The average daily volume on March 31 was 429,749 shares, which means it is going to take the shorts 6.87 days to cover. It will be interesting to see the numbers for April 15, which should be out soon. On April 7, 2021 NASDAQ published a news story on Atomera's ticker titled \"What Kind Of Investors Own Most Of Atomera Incorporated (ATOM)?\" Shares of Atomera have traded lower every day since then. The article was written by an organization called Simply Wall Street. Simply Wall Street is not based on Wall Street. Simply Wall Street is based in Sydney Australia. Its founder is a young man named Al Bentley. According to Mr. Bentley's LinkedIn profile he graduated from college in 2009 and he was a Graphic Graduate Engineer, a Naval Architect, and a Project Engineer. After reading the articles Simply Wall Street writes, I noticed every article is negative and bearish. Either Mr. Bentley is a very benevolent soul who wants to stop people from investing in what he thinks are bad companies, or he has an interest in seeing those companies' shares trade lower. This, of course, is just my opinion.\nIn my opinion, stocks with a tight float, solid insider ownership, and strong institutional shareholders have a lot of potential to trade higher when the shorts start to cover.\n\nSummary\n\nAtomera has a high margin, recurring revenue financial model. The Company also has a strong balance sheet, solid technology, and a patent portfolio that has increased 17% year over year and includes 269 patents granted and pending. Atomera is gaining traction with many top industry players and growing its licensee base. This gives the Company the opportunity to ramp up its commercial license revenues.\n\nAtomera has 23,006,449 common shares issued and outstanding as of its March 12 proxy filing. Out of the 23,006,449 common shares outstanding, institutional ownership is 26.02%, while management owns 14.4%. In my opinion, with almost 3 million shares short and a strong shareholder base, shares of ATOM could trade much higher in the near-term. The fact that the adoption of Mears Silicone Technology in one fab can make Atomera profitable from royalties alone makes Atomera a great long-term play. Atomera plans to release its first quarter 2021 financial results after the market closes on Wednesday, April 28, 2021. The company will host a live video Zoom webinar at 2:00 p.m. Pacific Time (5:00 p.m. Eastern Time) on Wednesday, April 28, 2021 to discuss the results. The live webinar can be accessed through Atomera's investor relations website at\u00a0Atomera Incorporated.\n\nInstitutional Ownership:\n\nhttps://fintel.io/so/us/atom\n\n[Intel - Supporting MST](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/news/progress-integrated-photonics-data-centers.html)\n\nhttps://atomerastockreport.wordpress.com/2021/02/20/atomera-atom-facts-and-figures-as-of-12-31-20/",

        "selftext": "In a time when pervasive chip and semiconductor shortages are snarling supply chains across the globe, it is hardly a surprise that chip giant Micron shares surged more than 5% in premarket trading, after the chipmaker gave a bullish sales and earnings forecast, with analysts positive on pricing trends for dynamic random access memory (DRAM), while highlighting improving demand from enterprise customers.\n\nShares in chip stocks peers also climbed in premarket trading, with Applied Materials up 2.6%, Nvidia gaining 1.5%, and Intel +1.2%. Separately, the WSJ reported that Micron and Western Digital are each exploring a potential deal for Japan\u2019s Kioxia.\n\nBelow, courtesy of Bloomberg, is a snapshot of what analysts said about Micron\u2019s stellar results:\n\nRBC Capital Markets (outperform, raises PT to $120 from $110)\n\n    Micron\u2019s results are \u201csolid across the board\u201d and news of potential consolidation of NAND is an added bonus\n    While revenue midpoint guidance was on top of RBC\u2019s expectations for the May quarter, profits are expanding at a faster rate\n    Micron continues to see \u201crobust\u201d demand from hyperscale companies, and enterprise demand looks to be improving\n\nCowen (outperform, raises PT to $105 from $100)\n\n    Says it is \u201chard to argue this was anything but a watershed quarter,\u201d noting better results, better guidance and immediate accretion from halting XPoint\n    Prudent capacity planning is now paying off, and is evident from improved pricing and margins\n\nEvercore (outperform, PT $135)\n\n    Severe shortages and disciplined capex is driving a \u201cperfect storm\u201d\n    Says the DRAM market is in \u201csevere\u201d shortage, pricing is increasing rapidly, and Micron\u2019s management expects further tightening through 2021\n    Reflecting on current spending levels on DRAM capex, it\u2019s \u201chard to see issues head,\u201d especially considering lean inventories at Micron\u2019s customers as well as equipment slots that are largely full until 1H22\n\nPiper Sandler (neutral, PT $90)\n\n    Micron saw strength across the board, and it appears demand has outpaced supply in the DRAM market, driving improving pricing trends\n    Notes data center, 5G handsets, automotive demand all remaining strong, with enterprise demand improving\n    Believes strength is likely to persist through much of calendar 2021 before potentially subsiding to more normal trends in calendar 2022",

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, April 1, 2021**\n\nStocks rose today, extending gains in another record-setting session. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) closed above $400 for the first time ever, starting the new quarter with a bang after President Biden announced a new $2 trillion infrastructure proposal.\n\nToday marks the first session of Quarter 2, hopefully putting to rest the volatility that dominated the market last quarter. Historically, the month of April has been good for equity markets, with the SPY gaining an average of 1.51% since 1980.\n\nHeading into Q2, we expect cyclical, energy, financial, and reopening stocks, whose performance is strongly tethered to the health of the broader economy, to continue driving the market higher. The last quarter saw the rotation out of tech and growth stocks as the US economy continues to gradually reopen due to the increased pace in vaccinations. Kristina Hooper, chief global market strategist at Invesco agrees, saying \u201c I think we\u2019re going to see more of the same in terms of market leadership. This is an environment in which the economy is likely to accelerate. And I think that means that we\u2019ll see continued outperformance of areas like energy, like financials, like consumer discretionary, material, industrials \u2014 those areas of the stock market that are most sensitive to the economy.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, President Biden introduced a new proposal called American Jobs Plan. The proposal includes roughly $2 trillion to help rehabilitate and build out the country's infrastructure, address the crisis around climate change and curb economic inequality. The plan includes spending to repair aging roads and bridges, jump-start transit projects, and rebuild school buildings and hospitals. It would also expand electric vehicles, replace all lead pipes and overhaul the nation\u2019s water systems. To pay for the proposal, Biden will propose raising the corporate tax rate to 28% from 21% for 15 years and implementing other policies to disincentivize offshoring. View a complete breakdown of the bill [here](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/biden-infrastructure-plan-details-113700242.html).\n\nLooking ahead, the March jobs report is set to be released Friday. The report is estimated[ to show the economy created a whopping 630,00 jobs](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/march-jobs-report-consumer-confidence-what-to-know-in-the-week-ahead-160859015.html) in March \u2014 the most since October 2019 before the coronavirus pandemic. As a reminder, US exchanges will be closed tomorrow in observance of Good Friday.\n\n**Highlights** \n\n* The Department of Labor released the weekly unemployment report\n   * **Initial jobless claims:** 719,000 vs. 675,000 expected and a revised 658,000 during the prior week\n   * **Continuing claims:** 3.794 million vs. 3.750 million expected and 3.870 million during the prior week\n* [The Institute for Supply Management's March purchasing managers' index ](https://www.ismworld.org/supply-management-news-and-reports/reports/ism-report-on-business/pmi/march/)rose to 64.7 for the highest print in nearly four decades. This came in well above consensus estimates for a rise to 61.5 in March from February's 60.8. Readings above the neutral level of 50 indicate expansion in a sector.\n* A lot of clean energy stocks, that have been beaten down recently, rallied on the back of Biden\u2019s proposal.\n* United Airlines is planning to restart the pilot hiring process it halted last year as the airline gears up to meet rising travel demand, the company told pilots in a memo viewed by The Wall Street Journal. \n* NIO stock gapped up 8% in the morning before falling due to better-than-expected delivery numbers. NIO delivered 7,257 vehicles in March 2021, increasing by 373% year-over-year and 20,060 vehicles in Q1, increasing by 423% year-over-year\n* Elon Musk has been nominated to join the board at Endeavor as the company looks to IPO.

I have made some nice profits I've taken $100 and turned it into $1,000 in a couple days.\n\nI seem to stick to the same stocks, apple, MU, Snap and recently nio. \n\nSo I'm just here to see if I'm doing things wrong. I usually buy calls or puts.\n\nTypically I'll stay in the money with my stock choice. So for example if I see apple is at $132 I'll buy a call for 132.50 or so. \n\nNow my question is I see people buying out of the money calls and making money as well. Like apple is $132 right I'll see people buying $136 calls and making money. \n\nI'm not sure how that part works I do know the premiums are cheaper the higher up you go  and the closer you get to in the money the more you pay for a premium.\n\nFor example that 136 call might be $60 as opposed to the $132.50 that would be $140.\n\nHow do you typically play out your calls? Anything I should be doing different? I can make nice profits but once I get over a grand I blow.mt account up. I've done it twice off of $100.",

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, April 1, 2021**\n\nStocks rose today, extending gains in another record-setting session. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) closed above $400 for the first time ever, starting the new quarter with a bang after President Biden announced a new $2 trillion infrastructure proposal.\n\nToday marks the first session of Quarter 2, hopefully putting to rest the volatility that dominated the market last quarter. Historically, the month of April has been good for equity markets, with the SPY gaining an average of 1.51% since 1980.\n\nHeading into Q2, we expect cyclical, energy, financial, and reopening stocks, whose performance is strongly tethered to the health of the broader economy, to continue driving the market higher. The last quarter saw the rotation out of tech and growth stocks as the US economy continues to gradually reopen due to the increased pace in vaccinations. Kristina Hooper, chief global market strategist at Invesco agrees, saying \u201c I think we\u2019re going to see more of the same in terms of market leadership. This is an environment in which the economy is likely to accelerate. And I think that means that we\u2019ll see continued outperformance of areas like energy, like financials, like consumer discretionary, material, industrials \u2014 those areas of the stock market that are most sensitive to the economy.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, President Biden introduced a new proposal called American Jobs Plan. The proposal includes roughly $2 trillion to help rehabilitate and build out the country's infrastructure, address the crisis around climate change and curb economic inequality. The plan includes spending to repair aging roads and bridges, jump-start transit projects, and rebuild school buildings and hospitals. It would also expand electric vehicles, replace all lead pipes and overhaul the nation\u2019s water systems. To pay for the proposal, Biden will propose raising the corporate tax rate to 28% from 21% for 15 years and implementing other policies to disincentivize offshoring. View a complete breakdown of the bill [here](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/biden-infrastructure-plan-details-113700242.html).\n\nLooking ahead, the March jobs report is set to be released Friday. The report is estimated[ to show the economy created a whopping 630,00 jobs](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/march-jobs-report-consumer-confidence-what-to-know-in-the-week-ahead-160859015.html) in March \u2014 the most since October 2019 before the coronavirus pandemic.

This came in well above consensus estimates for a rise to 61.5 in March from February's 60.8. Readings above the neutral level of 50 indicate expansion in a sector.\n* A lot of clean energy stocks, that have been beaten down recently, rallied on the back of Biden\u2019s proposal.\n* United Airlines is planning to restart the pilot hiring process it halted last year as the airline gears up to meet rising travel demand, the company told pilots in a memo viewed by The Wall Street Journal. \n* NIO stock gapped up 8% in the morning before falling due to better-than-expected delivery numbers.

Major indices all posted gains in the holiday-shortened week as S&amp;P 500 and Dow finished at record closes. Energy led the market on stronger crude. Tech, communication services beat the tape (FANMAG complex broadly higher). Consumer staples, healthcare, utilities the only sectors lower. Treasuries mostly firmer with some notable strength at the long end of the curve. Dollar weaker on the major crosses. Gold finished up 0.7%. WTI crude settled up 3.9% despite OPEC and its allies agreeing increase output by \\~2M bpd through July.\n   * **Infrastructure continued to dominate the headlines with a lot of moving pieces** after White House detailed plans to spend $2.25T+ over next eight years. Fiscal stimulus still a key piece of the bullish narrative for stocks though plans for another big spending also fit with pickup in concerns about inflation/economic overheating. Higher taxes another potential headwind for risk sentiment. Also some focus on how difficult it will be to get infrastructure stimulus passed given the lack of Republican support, competing preferences among Democrats and their razor-thin majorities in both the House and Senate.\n   * Busy on the data front ahead of nonfarm payrolls tomorrow. **ISM manufacturing gauge surged in March** with new orders strong, though growing backlogs and supplier delivery times reinforcing broader themes of supply chain pressures and rising input costs. Press has been picking up this theme, noting some consumer-products firms raising prices. Elsewhere, weekly **US initial jobless claims missed**, seeing a larger-than-expected uptick. On the global front, **US-China tensions** another area of focus with more concerns about Chinese incursions into Taiwan.\n   * **TSM** to spend $100B on capex over next three years. **MU** beat and guided above with focus on favorable DRAM dynamics. Company and **WDC** both exploring an acquisition of Japan's Kioxia for approx. $30B. **KMX** comp sales weaker than expected, though March sales commentary upbeat. **F** announced more shutdowns due to semi shortages. **QS** up big after meeting technical milestone for additional $100M investment from Volkswagen. **CCK** in talks to sell its cans unit for more than $2B. **ANGI** acquired additional 20% interest in its MyBuilder business. **WING** comps better. **EBS** lab errors resulted in 15M ruined **JNJ** vaccine doses (but not expected to impact US supply targets). **PLAY** beat and guidance ahead on better reopening pace but stock already a big ytd gainer. **GES** EPS well ahead of consensus and guidance better with digital a bright spot.\n* **Digest**\n   * **Most sectors higher with growth ahead of value:**\n      * Growth generally led cyclical/value on first day of Q2. **Energy** the standout, following WTI higher with E&amp;Ps particularly strong. **Tech** a big gainer with help from semis and software (MSFT also had a good day). Internets and entertainment the leaders in **communication services**. **Financials** ahead on upside across credit cards and insurance, while banks mostly brushed off Treasury yields move lower down today. **Consumer discretionary** trailed with some weakness among retailers offsetting support from AMZN and homebuilders. **Materials** saw some drag from industrial metals, with steel the weak spot. **Industrials** a bit of an underperformer with select machinery and multis down. **Healthcare** mixed with some weakness in managed care, distributors, and large-cap pharma (JNJ). **Consumer staples** worst performer with HPCs, tobacco, and grocers some of the weights.\n   * **ISM Manufacturing highest in over 37 years, initial jobless claims and continuing claims miss:**\n      * **March ISM Manufacturing** PMI up 3.9 points m/m to 64.7, ahead of 61.5 estimate, for highest print since Dec-1983. New Orders, production indexes highest since Jan-04, employment index highest since Feb-18. Supplier deliveries continued to slow, up to highest reading since Apr-1974. Prices also elevated, holding near highest since Jul-08. **Initial jobless claims** of 719K were up 61K w/w, and missed consensus estimates for 690K. However, prior week revised down 26K to 658K from 684K, which was lowest since the pandemic surge in claims began in Mar-20. **Continuing claims** fell to 3.794M from 3.870M, though also missed estimates for 3.775M. While this week's claims will not flow through to tomorrow's March jobs report (2-Apr, 8:30 ET), labor market data in focus given reopening and vaccine-driven economic momentum. **March nonfarm payrolls** expected to increase by 285K m/m to 614K, which would be the highest since Oct-20.\n   * **OPEC+ agrees to gradual output increases of 1M bpd over the coming months:**\n      * [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-01/opec-agrees-to-gradually-increase-oil-output-in-coming-months?srnd=premium&amp;sref=J9GPLx1B) reported that OPEC and its allies agreed to gradually boost oil output from May to July. The group will add more than 1M bpd over the coming months, incluidng a 350K bpd increase from Saudi Arabia and Russia in May, and an additional 450K bpd in July. Saudi Arabia may also roll back some of its voluntary 1M bpd cuts. While market had expected group to roll over existing limits, article cited analysts who say product demand is expected rise by 3M bpd over the next three months, so increase isn't bearish.

Popular \"coins created by computers\" are perceived as having a demand for high energy, and well inherently doesn't do anything besides act as a currency.\n2. Popular \"coins created by computers\" caused a surge in demand for CPU.\n3. Newly designed \"coins created by computers\" use HDD and will do something? so could replace Popular \"coins created by computers\" or at least cause demand like Popular \"coins created by computers\" for CPU.\n4. Hard drives are hard to make.\n5. Hard drive companies are undervalued. Barron's showed that WDC has a price target of 125 while currently at $60.\n\nSo, HDD companies will see a boom like AMD/MU.\n\nWhy am I wrong? Why shouldn't I buy a shit ton of 100$ calls for $10.\n\nLong HDD companies.\n\nThis is not financial advice, see my post where I talk about losing the 150k earnings I had from COVID like a fucking tool for thinking 2 trillion dollars wouldn't jumpstart the economy.\n\nArticles and Stuff\n\n[https://www.barrons.com/articles/western-digital-profit-to-surge-on-higher-flash-memory-prices-analyst-says-51618848790](https://www.barrons.com/articles/western-digital-profit-to-surge-on-higher-flash-memory-prices-analyst-says-51618848790)",

        "selftext": "KULR is Leading the Battery Revolution\n\n[Silvia Mu\u00f1oz Campo](https://www.benzinga.com/users/silvia-mu-oz-campo)   April 26, 2021 10:00am   4 min read   Advertiser Disclosure\n\nRenewable energy and electric vehicles (EV) market stocks like **Tesla** [TSLA](https://benzinga.com/stock/tsla#NASDAQ), Nio Inc. [NIO 0.01%](https://benzinga.com/stock/nio#NYSE), **KULR Technology Group** [KULR](https://benzinga.com/stock/kulr#OTC), LG Chem (OTCPK: LGCLF), **Samsung SDI** (OTCPK: SSDIY), **ChargePoint Holdings Inc** [CHPT](https://benzinga.com/stock/chpt#NYSE), and **Blink Charging Co.** (NASDAQ: BLNK, BLNKW), among others, are leading the headlines of countless media stories and the reason is simple \u2014 the world needs drastic solutions to stop the damage caused to the planet.\n\nTraditional road transport accounts for 15% of total CO\u2082 emissions and the primary source of energy remains coal, natural gas and oil. Consequently, the world needs technological advancements to accelerate the adaptation of sustainable solutions.\n\nThe new U.S. administration plan includes $174 billion to promote EVs and EV charging stations, $80 billion for public transit and another $80 billion for railroads. To make sure these plans go as expected, many EVs and charging stations (most likely fast-charge stations) will require higher energy density battery cells. This, in turn, will require more efficient thermal management solutions as well as safer battery management systems to protect from thermal runaway.\n\nThese higher energy density batteries are one of the answers that enable the use of renewables from vehicles to entire power plants \u2014 hence, the battery revolution. Yet, we are still in the early stages of developing the market, and with its different reliable suppliers.\n\n**KULR Technology Group** [KULR](https://benzinga.com/stock/kulr#OTC), a developer of lithium-ion battery safety and thermal management technologies, is taking its space-proven solutions for electronics to serve the world of electric transportation, energy storage, battery safety, 5G infrastructure, cloud computing, aerospace, and defense applications. Over the last year, KULR has been focused on filling the demand for heat management solutions in the EV, and even more broadly, the overall electric transportation market.\n\nEarlier this week, the company announced the June 2021 launch of a new product line of high-capacity lithium battery packs targeting the $127 billion commercial drone market. In fact, KULR recently secured a global commercial drone manufacturer as a customer and expects to secure additional customers in the second half of 2021. The announcement is a first step in KULR\u2019s overall strategy of targeting adjacent markets complementary to the company\u2019s established battery safety and thermal management products. KULR intends to rapidly expand into additional electric transportation markets in the coming year.\n\nLast summer the company partnered with Drako Motors for its electric supercar, and the Consumer Product Safety Commission reported that KULR\u2019s design solutions can stop fires and explosions in lithium-ion battery packs and provide additional insights on the future of safe battery technology.\n\nBattery storage plays a major role in the future and is very key to KULR and what they are doing with battery safety. Without a doubt, the company is poised to become an essential player as the battery revolution continues. Benzinga has covered many of the company\u2019s milestones.\n\nRead also: [From Mars to Your Hands: KULR Is Making Electronics Cooler and Safer.](https://www.benzinga.com/news/20/12/18939009/from-mars-to-your-hands-kulr-is-making-electronics-cooler-and-safer)\n\nHere\u2019s what you need to know about the company today.\n\n**KULR Strengthens for Uplisting**\n\nLast year was significant for the company, yet 2021 has brought many changes and exciting news that continue to strengthen the company for potential uplisting. Here are a few developments you should know about:\n\n* **The company appointed Keith Cochran as President and COO in March.** Keith was SVP of Jabil [JBL 0.11%](https://benzinga.com/stock/jbl#NYSE), the 3rd largest EMS provider in the world.\n* It recently strengthened its board by the appointments of Joanna D. Massey and Morio Kurosaki as directors, contingent upon the Company\u2019s common stock being approved for uplisting to a senior national exchange. KULR expects their involvement to strengthen the corporate governance and strategic direction.\n* **A few days ago, the company announced Antonio Martinez as the new Vice President of Operations.** Mr. Martinez will be responsible for managing the day-to-day operations of the company\u2019s manufacturing department as well as supporting strategic growth goals.\n\nIn addition, KULR reported its 4Qr 2020 results:\n\n* Increased in revenue by 298% compared to the prior year corresponding quarter \u2014 mainly reflecting increased aerospace and governments.\n* KULR became the official thermal management and battery safety technical partner for Andretti Technologies, the advanced technology arm of Andretti Autosport, founded by Michael Andretti.\n* As part of the alliance, KULR agreed to establish a thermal management testing and design platform for high-performance battery solutions with the highest safety ratings specially adapted to the rigorous technical requirements of Andretti\u2019s global racing enterprise. Both partners would focus on co-developing and co-marketing motorsports\u2019 battery and safety technologies to automotive partners for mass-market EV applications.\n\nAdvertisement Disclosure:  The following post was written and/or published as a collaboration between Benzinga\u2019s in-house sponsored content team and a financial partner of Benzinga.

        "selftext": "**Archegos $20 Billion Margin Call**\n\nWe started off this week dealing with the fall out of a massive margin call that was executed in large part by Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley to cover losses incurred by Archegos Capital when their leveraged positions with Viacom ($VIAC) and Discovery ($DISCA) went haywire. Bill Hwang who runs Archegos Capital had been acquiring positions in both Viacom and Discovery through highly leveraged swaps. The straw that broke the camels back was a $3 Billion dollar equity offering by Viacom to fund their streaming business which caused a 29% decline in the stock price, which greatly affected the value of Archegos swaps. The losses proved to be too great for Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley\u2019s personal risk tolerance as they demanded more collateral from Archegos to cover their losses. When Archegos was unable to do so, a $20 Billion dollar liquidation was initiated as multiple banks forced closed Archegos positions in block trades. (Block Trades are large trades negotiated between a buyer and seller, usually institutional, that is done off of the open market.) Baidu, Tencent Muisc, Vipshop Holdings, Viacm, Discover, Farfetch, iQiyi, and GSX Techedu all had positions closed and faced selling pressure as apart of the margin call. \n\nOn Monday, US banks faced a sell off of their own as investors grew concerned about losses they may have faced as a result of Archegos Margin Call. It is currently being reported that the total global losses may be as large as $6 Billion dollars. Morgan Stanley shares fell 2.6%, Goldman Sachs dropped 1.7%, Deutsche Bank dropped 5%, UBS was down 3.8%, Creduit Suisse plummeted 14%, and Nomura suffered the worst with a 16.3% decline. Nomura warned in a statement that their loss may have been as large as $2 Billion dollars. There are rumors that one bank may have lost up to $4 Billion. \n\n**Suez Canal Re-Open for business**\n\nAfter being stuck sideways for nearly a week, the Ever Given container ship, which stands larger than the entire state building, has been unstuck from the Suez Canal. It was reported that the ship got stuck due to strong winds from a sand storm. This resulted in many transport ships containing goods and materials becoming blocked as they were unable to travel to their destinations. It was initially believed that the dig-out effort could last weeks to get the ship unstuck causing many ships to detour around Africa to make it to their destination. It was estimated that $400 Million dollars an hour in goods were being blocked from entering the canal.  \n\nIn the end, tug boats and dredgers prevailed and were able to free the ship from the banks which lead to the reopening of the canal. Shortly after the hashtag #Putitback started trending on twitter as some people seemingly wanted the boat to stay stuck for meme purposes. The unsticking of the boat had no immediate effect on the market as stocks remained mixed for the day. The S&amp;P 500 closed nearly unchanged, the Nasdaq closed down .6%, while the Dow Jones closed up .32% for a new record high.   \n\n**Bond Yields**\n\nInterest rates continue to creep up in the bond market. Early Tuesday in the trading day the 10 year treasury yield hit a high of 1.77%. The spike comes after President Biden promised that by mid-April 90% of adults would be eligible to receive the covid Vaccine and that his administration is hoping to increase the pharmacies administrating vaccines from 17,000 to 40,000 sites around the US. The rise in bond yields is currently attributed to the massive amounts of stimulus being spent in combination with vaccine effort leading America to what is sure to be one hell of a reopening. Godman Sachs forecasting that the US will see a rise in GDP growth of nearly 7% throughout 2021. Some think that this might be too much too fast and is worried that the massive amounts of stimulus going into the economy will lead to future inflation and higher interest rates. Regardless, the Biden administration is looking ahead to its next multi-trillion dollar economic stimulus package which will targeted towards infrastructure. \n\nUpdate: Bonds rallied to end the trading week, bringing down the 10 year yield to 1.67%.\n\n**Build Back Better, US Infrastructure &amp; rising taxes.**  \n\nOn Wednesday Biden unveiled the details of his $2.3 trillion dollar infrastructure plan in Pittsburgh. His plan would currently put $621 towards roads, bridges, public transit, and EV charging stations, $400 Billion towards care for the elderly, $213 retrofitting buildings and constructing affordable housing. Another $111 Billion would go to replace lead water pipes, $100 billion for broadband, and $100 billion towards upgrading the power grid to deliver clean energy. In additions the plan aims to build 500,000 EV charging stations, and invest in domestic semiconductor manufacturing. Delays in manufacturing due to semi-conductor shortages have become a hot topic as of late, and put pressure on the US to begin to manufacture semiconductors domestically rather than depend on China. \n\nThe Build Back Better plan will be funded by raising corporate taxes from 21% to 28%. In 2017 President Trump had lowered the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. Although, it\u2019s important to keep in mind that corporate taxes are just the first round of increased taxes that Biden is proposing. It is also expected that he will make a push to raise taxes on \u201chigh income\u201d individuals and families, and also raise capital gains taxes for those who trade in the stock market. Although the income and spending of the higher taxes would take place over the course of 10 years, if higher taxes are approved those would go into effect this year. \n\n**OPEC**\n\nOPEC lowered their 2021 growth forecast by 300,000 barrels per day due to concerns about the recovery as parts of Europe go back into lockdown. Germany and the Netherlands have extended their lockdown into April, and France announced this week they will be entering into another lockdown as their ICU hits a high of 5,000 patients. Many other parts of Europe will be having temporary lockdowns for Easter to prevent the people traveling and possibly spreading Covid. It\u2019s easy to see how OPEC remains concerned about oil demand with the US largely being the only country seemingly getting a grip on the virus with their vaccine rollouts. \n\nOPEC is set to meet on Thursday to discuss their output policy. At their last meeting, Saudi Arabia added an additional 1 million barrel per day cut to their oil production which resulted in a temporary surge to the price of oil to the mid $60\u2019s. Currently OPEC is curbing the output by over 7 million barrels per day to help keep the price of oil stable.\n\nUpdate: OPEC agreed on Thursday to do gradual increases in oil production starting in May which lead to rally in the oil market, bringing the price per barrel up 3.5% to over $61 per barrel. \n\n**ISM PMI &amp; EOW market rally.** \n\nManufacturing in March jumped to its highest level in 37 years. The Institute of supply management announced on Thursday it\u2019s manufacturing index number increased from 60.8 to 64.7 which is the highest level since December 1983. It\u2019s a stunning rebound in manufacturing considering 1 year ago the index dropped to under 45 in April while the US and most of the globe were under the first Covid lockdown. Although a rising PMI number is a sign of economic expansion, it could also be a sign of rising inflation as trillions are being pumped into the economy to stimulate growth. \n\nAll major indices rallied to end the week. The S&amp;P 500 broke above 4,000 for the first time to end at an all time high, the Nasdaq continued its rally gaining 1.8%, and the Dow had modest gains to close up .5%. The market will be closed on Friday in observance of Good Friday, although the jobs report will still be released on schedule. First time unemployment claims rose to 719K in March higher than the expected 675K that were expected. Although with the economy heating up as indicated by the PMI number, it is believed this unexpected bump in unemployment will be temporary and continue to fall into the summer season. \n\n**Notable Earnings** \n\n$LULU posted an earnings beat with an EPS of $2.58 and revenue of $1.73 billion. Their net revenue increased 94%. Despite the earnings beat $LULU dropped in trading and ended the week at $301.07. $LULU\u2019s shares price has dropped 18% since the beginning of the year. \n\n$CHWY reported 4th quarter results that beat estimates and reported an unexpected profit causing the stock to pop 7% in after hours trading. Their revenue was up 51% from a year and had a 43% increase in users. CHWY hit a high of $93 dollar per share, and ended the week reading at $82.71\n\n$MU also beat on earnings posting $0.98 per share. In addition they posted revenue of $6.24 billion for the quarter also beating estimates. Their stock traded higher to end the week as they gave a bullish forecast for their future and raised their forecast for the second quarter. As the US struggles with a chip shortage that has been slowing production in multiple sectors, expectations will certainly be high moving forward.",

I own the main ETFs as well as individual stocks. Currently AMD, NVDA, MU, TSM, and MU.  \n\nIt's hard not to find non-biased info on forums but I'm hoping someone with actual engineering knowledge can help me out. Their website is too opaque/jargony for someone as dumb as me. \n\nThis is their blurb:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;The POET Optical Interposer\u2122 utilizes a novel waveguide technology that allows the integration of electronic and photonic devices into a single multi-chip module. \u00a0By applying advanced wafer-level semiconductor manufacturing techniques and novel packaging methods, POET\u2019s Optical Interposer eliminates costly components, assembly, alignment and testing methods employed in conventional photonics solutions.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn this environment of extreme shortage, what is the case for them emerging as a relevant lower-tier player based on their stated tech?  They're a Canadian company, minutes from where I live in Toronto. Their leadership are ex-GF executives. They are traded on the venture exchange.\n\nTIA",

        "selftext": "\nThis is a list of the top 20 companies that experienced the largest change in insider shares in the last seven (7) days.\nThe SEC defines an insider as any officer, director or 10% shareholder. It is not illegal for these people to buy or sell their own shares.\nIn fact, since most of them get paid in stock options, it is expected. However, it is illegal for them to trade on inside information\nthat has not been made public. So for example if there are drug trial results that are bad and not public,\ninsiders cannot dump shares. That said, many people have observed that insiders - in general - seem to have a good\ntrack record at timing their purchases.  All trades that are marked as part of a 10b5 plan are excluded from this report.\n\n## Largest Insider Buying (Last 7 Days)\nCompany|Count|Shares Changed|Avg.
