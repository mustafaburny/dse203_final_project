Seems like a great time to buy, especially as their main competitor, Cineworld, shuddered their US locations. \n\nOf course this could also be the tipping point where we stop going to movie theaters entirely and begin to shift new releases to at home streaming, which wouldn't bode too well for AMC I imagine.\n\nDo you guys think it's a safe buy?",

        "selftext": "think about it, retard. \n\nin 2017, amc stock was around $30. now the stock is less than $3. big rona is raging hard in people's hearts and ballots, and meanwhile america's biggest corporations are getting a raging hard-on for buying a chain of movie theaters.\n\nbloomberg reported last night \"rumors\" that AMC is going to go bankrupt.

Bankruptcy, Aron says, might have to be an option down the road, \"but that time has not yet arrived, and any reports to the contrary are wholly inaccurate.\"\n\nAMC is definitely looking for a buyer. It's allowed now, thanks to a court ruling this last summer, i think.\n\nLookin at you Bezos, and maybe you, netflix guy. also, have you seen the AMZN Studios intro on prime? they show AMZN branded movie theaters, if that's the kinda dd you like. prime early access for showings? yes.\n\nbesides, rona gonna be background noise by next summer's blockbusters. they might even replay the blockbusters that got blueballed this year (tenet, 007, mulan).\n\nposition: **AMC Jan-15-21 $5 calls** (jan-22 leaps too are fun and cheap)\n\n*tl;dr: HTZ replay*",

        "selftext": "**Introduction:**  \n \n\nAMC Entertainment and Cinemark are the two largest U.S. theater companies. \n\n* AMC is the largest theater chain in the U.S. and the world.\n   *  AMC has acquired Carmike Cinemas along with the European Odeon and Nordic shortly thereafter. \n   * AMC operates 630+ theaters in the U.S. and 365 theaters in Europe.\n   * There are even plans for AMC to open theaters in Saudi Arabia.\n* Cinemark is the second largest in the U.S.\n   * It operates 342 US theaters\n   * Operates 205 theaters across Latin America.\u00a0\n   * In an interesting twist Cinemark has a 25% stake in National Cinemedia (NASDAQ: NCMI) (The focus for NCMI is advertising)  \n\n\n**52 Week Highs/Lows:**\n\n* AMC High: $10.95 / Low 1.95$ - Currently trading at $3.04 (17 October)\n* CNK High $37.83 / Low $5.71 - Currently trading at $7.86 (17 October)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Comparing the balance sheets (At a glance):**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBefore this comparison just some quick notes: Movie attendance has decreased gradually over the last 20 years. Both Cinemark and AMC have released rewards programs which has actually increased attendance in 2019 (And then a wild COVID appeared). Additionally both companies have increased their prices to bump up their revenues over the years. (Popcorn obv tastes better when you spend 500$ on it)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAMC has spend the last several years buying up Cinema chain (Lots of acquisitions in 2016-17), naturally the fund this they loaded up on debt. So, naturally, COVID-19 has put the company in a very difficult spot. \n\n* Last year the company had $340 million in interest payments.\n* It's debt totals over $5 billion. (As of last year)\n* AMC is holding just $198.5 million in cash\n* AMC has more theaters in high-rent locations compared to Cinemark - This lowers their revenue.\n* Their current debt is 5x their current  EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization)\n\nAMC is currently in fund-raising mode, they have stated they have enough funds through the year and possibly a bit longer. Recently though AMC has made a deal with Universal. A step into the streaming market, especially during these lockdowns, could move the company in a brighter direction if they can weather their current conditions.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCinemark, unlike AMC, has committed to more conservative growth, a move that puts Cinemark in an excellent position to weather the current COVID downturns.  \n\n* CNK has over $571.76 million in cash\n* Additonally they have access to over $100 million in additional credit\n* Their expenses total to \\~$520 million if we lump their interest and lease payments. (Plus some other obligations I'm sure)\n* Their current debt is \\~2x their current  EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization)\n\nCinemark has states they have enough money to last through 2021 comfortably. One important note, unlike AMC, Cinemark does not appear to have made move  towards streaming services. This could impact their future revenues if theater attendance continues to decline more in favor for streaming. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The Takeaway:**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis choice definitely comes down to personal risk tolerance, and depend on your view of the resiliency of the movie industry. Theaters have been on the decline for years, the reward programs have decreased this flow a bit, but how much will it continue to do so especially if people have unsubscribed from these to pinch pennies during COVID?  \n\n\nAMC is definitely the riskier of the two, they have tons of debt and Europe has seen less theater attendance than Latin America has for CNK. However if AMC survives (by its own means or government money), there is potential for stronger upside, especially since they are getting their foot in the door with universal.   \n\n\nCinemark's conservative growth is definitely paying off during this time. However, if AMC does survive then what will Cinemark's moves be in the future to ensure their continues relevance as theaters continue to decline?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Final Thoughts:**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDo I think these (AMC &amp; CNK) are super long term holds? I am hesitant to say. Looking at a 1-2 year window I do believe they both have strong potential for profit. Beyond that it is difficult to say. AMC's moves with universal could put the company on a new future path away from traditional theaters. It'll be interesting to see where that goes and what Cinemark will do to move itself from a potentially dying market. If you buy definitely set stop-losses just incase, and/or plan an exit price. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThankyou to all that have read this far. This is not all inclusive so please please do your own research to supplement the quick comparison here. Additionally thankyou to everyone who provided constructive comments on the AT&amp;T post. That was definitely more of a controversial stock, it was interesting to hear everyone's different takes.",

        "selftext": " \n\n**Introduction:**\n\nBlink Charging owns, operates, and provides electric vehicle (EV) charging equipment and networked EV charging services primarily in the United States.   It also provides the \"Blink Network\", a cloud that  tracks charging stations and the associated charging data. This data provides property owners, managers, and parking companies remote monitoring and management of EV charging stations and payment processing. Additionally it provides drivers with station information, info such as location, availability, and applicable fees.   \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Current setup:**\n\nAs of December 2019 it has approx. 14,700+ EV charging stations across the US East Coast, West Coast, and locations in the Mid-West. Additionally they are expanding into Europe and the Middle East. (Can't attach the map because rules)\n\nThe following types of locations currently have stations (It is pretty much where you'd expect):  airports, auto dealers, healthcare/medicals, hotels, municipal locations, residential and condos, parks and recreation areas, parking lots, religious institutions, restaurants, retailers, schools and universities, stadiums, supermarkets, transportation hubs, and workplace locations. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Predictions:** \n\nEV charging industry is projected to be a $112 billion industry by 2027.  The growing demand and sentiment for electric vehicles is a major factor responsible for aggressive growth. Additionally expansion of this industry will increase rapidly as more world governments move towards becoming carbon-neutral status the next few decades. \n\n*  In 2018 US EV sales were up 81% from 2017\n*  In 2018 global EV sales totaled 2.1 million, up 64% from 2017\n* There are currently more than 1.2 million electric vehicles in the U.S.\n* The global EV market is expected to grow at a 25.6% CAGR from 2019-2026 and is forecasted to reach over $567B by 2026\n*  By 2025 EV sales are projected to account for 30% of all global vehicle sales \n*  By 2030, the US is estimated to need 13 million charging stations \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Recent Developments for Blink:**\n\n* Agreement with Cushman &amp; Wakefield for Deployment of EV Charging Stations \n* Agreement with InterEnergy for the purchase of $1.2 million of Blink EV charging equipment to be deployed in the Dominican Republic\n* Co-recipient of a $900,000 grant from the BIRD energy program for the development of a DC fast-charging solution\n* Reached more than 23,000 deployments of EV charging stations at multiple living complexes and offices\n* Migrated the Blink Network to Microsoft Azure to optimize performance, operability and driver experience and prepare for future expansion\n* Expansion into Greece with Eunice Energy joint venture, deploying 40+ ports \n*  Blink enhanced its software to work seamlessly with Google Maps \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA more recent agreement with SG Blocks (NASDAQ: SGBX) aims to deploy a rapid and cost-effective innovative EV charging containers designed to provide off-grid charging solutions through a combined solar and battery components in multiple capacities. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Competitors:**\n\nChargepoint (their main competitor, they are not publically traded) - focused on manufacturing and selling hardware (SemaConnect is another competitor we could lump here)\n\nEVgo, Electrify America - DCFC (Direct-current fast charger) charging solutions that are mainly beneficial for long road trips\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Blink Charging claims to stand out from their competitors claiming: \"We are the only company in the U.S. that can provide a full package of EV charging solutions under one roof, from start to finish!\"** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Prices &amp; Market Cap:**\n\n52 Week Range $1.25\u2014$14.58 \n\nMarket Cap $310M \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The Takeaway &amp; Final Thoughts:**\n\nInterest and sentiment towards Electric Vehicles has been booming and the EV charging industry is poised to grow along side them. Like many of the companies that produce electric cars, EV charging is not the most profitable right now, however, having the infrastructure in place sets Blink and Chargepoint in excellent positions to capitalize in this upcoming market. Additionally there is the possibility of future government subsidies. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you to all that have read this. This is not all inclusive so please please do your own research to supplement, especially since I did not talk in depth about the company financials, and since there are many competitors in this emerging market. Additionally thank you to everyone that provided constructive comments to the AMC vs Cinemark post. I hope everyone has a good day.",

Spoiler: &gt;!basically everyone from the earlier seasons is already dead and no one wants to watch it.!&lt;\n\nHowever, the company has been able to maintain 25% margins for over 10 years and can still generate substantial amounts of cash even if viewership declines (like $100m - $200m per year).\n\nOn top of this, they have one of the biggest niche streaming services in Shudder, Acorn TV, and a couple others. At the end of this year, they'll have 4m subscribers on that. Competitor Crunchyroll, with 3m subscribers, is being shopped by AT&amp;T for $1B. There's your marketcap right there.\n\nSo basically the company is worth probably double the current price, even if things go poorly. If they can find another show like Walking Dead, stock could be a 10x.",

        "selftext": "Ok,,, an idea for fucks sake\n\nCan a sloppy fishy dream or what?\n\nI'm sure all of you are aware of AMC taking a fat shit right now, but what if it was lowkey getting a plumpkin this whole time behind the scenes? Will AMC wipe its ass soon or go Elvis Presley... idfk, but I do have a vision of future theaters that just might change the dynamic of how movie tickets are bought and/or presented to the public. Hear me out, BEZOS has revolutionized mail today as we know. What if any streaming company buys out AMC theaters, but makes some reservations to the theater itself. Such as creating a revolutionary way to buy our tickets or group up to meet friends to watch movies at theaters. What if you could use your PRIME(could be anything else just throwing shit out there) from Amazon(or any other) as a subscription to go watch movies at theaters on a weekly or monthly basis? Would such a system be possible to implement? Creating a new dynamic where movies are streamed from Amazon to the screen itself. Lots of possibilities. One being, creating custom theater rooms where friends can buy into certain rooms with specific showings? Or maybe give the moviegoers the option to book a room to a certain movie released they want to watch with friends? Maybe random people who want to meet other random people to select a room that incentivizes engagement because ik society can use something like this nowadays. Somehow connect dating apps with this infrastructure to create blind or wanted dates? I just feel like there is so much potential if one of these big companies actually looked into this in some form or fashion...\n\nRegardless... A hopeless fuck as myself has procrastinated enough on this random thought as this shit probably will hit chapter 11. At least the property is an asset. Can a fishy dream?\n\n\\-a tired hallucinogenic pleb\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nConclusion: If you read this far, FDs all day on this bitch",

        "selftext": "##The Boomer Weekly\n\n###Where dreams die. Slowly.\n\nI have to get to the course for my tee time so this week we\u2019re going to punch it through Boomerland in an [AMC Gremlin](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/65/Gremlin_side_%285903000893%29.jpg/1200px-Gremlin_side_%285903000893%29.jpg) so that I can get there on time. Fuck you, AMC had sexy cars including the [Matador](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fc/1972_AMC_Matador.jpg/280px-1972_AMC_Matador.jpg) and the [Pacer](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/e0/AMC_Pacer_1975_French_advertisement.jpg/220px-AMC_Pacer_1975_French_advertisement.jpg) (*that* is how you sell a car, folks). \n\nLet\u2019s just look at all companies\u2019 performance on Monday: fuuuuuuuuuuuuck that\u2019s green. Right. Now on to the rest of the week. \n\nPsyche. This is Boomerland and youthful exuberance is rarely tolerated here.\n\nLet\u2019s circle back to IBM, who sells International Business Machines but did not get the memo that Monday was supposed to be green. Tuesday was ugly. Wednesday was nice. Thursday was *not*. Had a good Friday to close out the week -1.7% to 125.93. Side note: you may remember that IBM spiked in early February at over $156/share. Only about 24% more to go. \n\nGE, who sells General Electrics, also failed to have a green Monday (see, *this* is why Boomerland is special) and muddled through the week only to become the hottest fucking stock on everyone\u2019s mind starting late Thursday and rising 7% to close out the week +5.5%.  Why? Because the Boeing 737 Max could fly again this year. Yep, that\u2019s right - the stock rose 7% because they are a supplier for a company who delivered 11 planes in September, had no new orders, and released an apocalyptic industry forecast last week but got encouraging news from the FAA on their most scandalous plane. Jebus, that was a long sentence. Let\u2019s just say this: makes total sense and there\u2019s nothing to see here.\n\nLet\u2019s just slide right into BA, who *also* did not have a green Monday. BA touched a low of -4.8% on the week at open on Thursday but quickly rose back to green for the day before taking off overnight (pun fully intended so suck my Gremlin) to reach soaring heights of +2.75% for the week at open on Friday. Somewhat of a sensor issue shortly after takeoff and rolled into the weekend -0.2% for the week to 167.35. \n\nLet\u2019s find a company that *did* get to participate in Monday\u2019s extravaganza. Coca-Cola ($KO) got above $51/share on Monday but then Tuesday happened. And Wednesday. And Thursday. But Friday was at least flatish. Down -1.8% for the week to close out at $49.94/share.\n\nHON (Honeywell). A lot of action happened between pre-market Monday and close on Friday. Very little of that actually mattered. Closed the week +0.1%. It\u2019s like the new person in The Villages - still has a lot of spunk but just wants to fit in with its slower friends at the Dow. (Just like KO, I have a raging conflict of interest here and I don\u2019t think that tucking it into my waistband is going to help.)\n\nHSBC. It\u2019s one week chart just looks like one long groan punctuated by a hiccup. Had a stellar Monday for +0.02% and then proceeded to dump. Bottomed out at -5.7% for the week on Thursday morning and recovered a bit to close out the week -2.6%. Why? Who knows, maybe investors think all this talk of legalizing weed in Mexico is bad for their business. \n\nI\u2019m definitely going to be late for my tee time. One more.\n\nF (Ford) snazzy af on Monday flirting with +6% near open but proceeded give most of that up by Thursday morning. Investors saw the words \u201cChina\u201d and \u201cgood\u201d in the company\u2019s sales report released Thursday and gave themselves CTE as they bashed their heads against the buy button as fast as they could. Closed out the week +4%. \n\nHope you enjoyed our tour through Boomerland for the week ending October 16th, 2020. Now get out of my AMC Gremlin, I have an appointment at the Putt-Putt.",

WTI crude up 1.6%.\n* Quiet session with nothing particularly incremental surrounding the higher-profile topics. **Earnings** beat rates remain elevated but bar also higher. **Fiscal stimulus** headlines seem to be more noise than news given the still fairly wide gap between Democrats and Republicans over the size and scope of the package. **Coronavirus** headlines have revolved around the recent pauses in vaccine and treatment trials (though optimism on both fronts remains elevated) and worries uptick in US cases suggest next big wave has begun. Not much new on **politics** where the key themes as of late have revolved around dampened concerns about a contested election and the potential for a Democratic sweep (though Senate expected to be very close).\n* Bank earnings in focus**.** **BAC-US** beat but lower quality as NII/NIM remain pressured. **WFC-US** mixed with NII/NIM and expenses worse and provisions and fee income better. **GS-US** had a blowout Q with trading, equity investments and expense control bright spots. **USB-US** and **PNC-US** both beat on lower provisions and better fee income.
