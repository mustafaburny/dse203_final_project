        "selftext": "Alright retards. Gather round, im bringing you this chad bull play from a throwaway account so nobody knows im a degenerate on my \u201cgrown up\u201d account.  PLTR is going to the moon \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 you can click off now if thats all you needed to know, but if you\u2019re curious why this technology is the future, keep reading.\n\n**ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IS MORE \u201cARTIFICAL\u201d THAN \u201cINTELLIGENT\u201d**\n\nAs has been dutifully noted by many fellow autists, Palantir is an artificial intelligence/algorithim data mangement software company. However, you don\u2019t quite have to worry about your wife going off and getting a robot boyfriend anytime soon. While this may come to a surprise to Jeffery Epstein\u2019s pal Steve Hawking[who believed robots will soon take over the world](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.newsweek.com/stephen-hawking-named-epstein-unsealed-files-virginia-giuffre-ghislaine-maxwell-1521920%3famp=1)  smart people in the field have been dealing with solving the problems of making artificial intelligence work for decades. This is good news for all those that have diamond hands \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc50 on their Palantir shares in the coming years, because one of the founders solved one of the major problems over a decade ago and I\u2019ll tell you how.\n\n\n**The problem with Artificial Intelligence and the Palantir Solution**\n\n\nIf you aren\u2019t yet familiar with [Stephen Cohen](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Cohen_(entrepreneur)) you should be. This is the ultimate autist chad that coded the first prototype of Palantir in 8 weeks. At his time at Stanford, he studied machine learning and artifical intelligence (this was way back in 2005, these beasts of nature are always 20~ years ahead of the normie media and their trends). However, as Cohen himself mentions in his talk at Stanford [\u201cThe Path to Palantir\u201d](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=g_6_kGDdjwI) he became dissapointed studying AI due to the many limitations of the field he quickly realized. Firstly, the AI is only ever as smart as the algorithms that the humans were able to develop, thus more \u201cartificial\u201d than \u201cintelligent.\u201d Secondly, while computers are able to store and calculate numbers even faster than an autist doing his math homework before his mom will let him have his tendies, and their superior skill at storing this information, computers cannot grasp numerous concepts that human\u2019s are skilled at. Most fundamentally, this is creativity and anything that is subjective. The example Cohen uses in his speech is hunger. Try explaining the feeling of hunger to someone and while you may be able to quantify it as a number between 1-10, this quantification leaves a lot out that someone that has never experienced hunger would understand. To put it simply, there are numerous factors in life that are impossible for a computer to qualify. Computers are good at factors they can quantify (numbers) but are as retarded as your average WSB bottom feeder when it comes to the qualitative (subjective). This is where Palantir comes in. Effectively, Palantir solves the quantitative issues for the human and lays it out for humans to interact with and add in qualitative analysis. Palantir is a marriage between a computer\u2019s impeccable ability to process and store numbers and data and humans impeccable ability to use creativity and view context as well as the subjective. \n\n\n**Software &amp; Business: The Dinosaur Superstructure**\n\n\nHeres where our other founder bellwether [Peter Thiel ](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Thiel) comes in. If you haven\u2019t heard of him yet, your girlfriend probably doesn\u2019t you stay out past 8 PM, even when she\u2019s not home. Member of the paypal mafia, when hes not busy making billions with his buddies musk and bezos, he\u2019s [taking down Gawker with Hulk Hogan ](https://www.forbes.com/sites/mattdrange/2016/06/21/peter-thiels-war-on-gawker-a-timeline/?sh=78387f3251c5)for outing his private sex life. Like how Cohenknows how computer\u2019s work, Thiel knows how businesses work. How many people here have been in an actual office building? Probably not the right crowd, I know, most of you still live in your parent\u2019s basement, but that won\u2019t matter when PLTR moons. Anyway, one of the first things youll notice is that the majority of technology used by businesses and governments are older than the average /r/teenagers poster. [According to research conducted by Kaspersky, \u201cfour in ten of very small businesses (VSB), and roughly half of small and medium-sized businesses (SMB), still rely on operating systems such as Windows XP or Windows 7 which are nearing their end of life.\u201d](https://www.itproportal.com/amp/news/businesses-still-dependent-on-outdated-software/) For some reason, I cannot find similar statistics for even larger companies that would be more likely for Palantir to be working with, but i\u2019d wager from experience and knowing the scaleability issues that come with updating to technology, especially when dealing with a bunch of boomers, that it would be even higher for large companies. However, this is great news, because our good friend Thiel has the perfect formula to grab the biggest 6000 businesses by the balls.\n\n\nEssentially, Palantir fronts the costs of installing and getting the software embedded into an operation in it\u2019s \u201cacquisition contract\u201d stage. Im not a finance frog, but from what I understand they don\u2019t actually make money from these contracts. Hence why they haven\u2019t been profitable. However, the model is like a snowball. After the acquisition contract has expired, the boomers running the operation Palantir is contracting to have finally figured out how to use the software without training wheels and it is entrenched in their companies business. A larger contract with higher margins is signed. Further, companies of that companies competition look at what Palantir has done for that company, such as when in Q3 Palantir found 315m in unnecessary spending for an oil and gas company, slotting to save the company 1b in the coming 12 months https://investors.palantir.com/news-details/2020/Palantir-Reports-Revenue-Growth-of-52-in-the-Third-Quarter-Raises-Full-Year-2020-Guidance/default.aspx and they are forced to sign an acquisition contract, further pushing the snowball along and acting as a case study of success for Palantir. \n\n\nRemember to diamond hands and buy that dip. The markets are an unmedicated bipolar teenaged girl on her period and currently Palantir is in a downswing, but that is only a buying opportunity for the wise of us. Short term, I could see Palantir dipping as low as $20. This negative feedback loop will be broken either by a new contract, Karp interview day, another media announcement, or demo day. Eventually. I\u2019ll lose a lot of you here, if I already havent, but hold strong and don\u2019t stress the short term as long as you agree with my thesis and have done/seen enough due diligence of your own to understand the fundamentals of this company are as solid as Karp\u2019s skiing legs. Longer term, I can see this company being at 100b+ market cap being conservative. \n\n\nBest of luck and fuck \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b andrew \u201cnever right\u201d left of Citron research, morgan stanley, and credit suisse. \n\nPLTR TO THE MOON \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\n\nDisclamers: 100 shares @ 25 (my portfolio is around 22k.

        "selftext": "  \n\n\n**A Value-Based A.I. Investment**  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the era of growing small businesses and increasing brand presence, the internet appears to be a vast and difficult space to make a lasting impression on from a small business perspective. Small businesses may have insufficient entries in Google, Yahoo, and other search engines, where clients are likely to discover them. This is significant for these businesses, because if their information is inaccurate or missing, it will turn away potential customers. Yext, a growing New York based company under the ticker YEXT, provides a solution for modifying these entries and increasing the internet presence of small businesses.  YEXT shows promise as a growing long term stock due to its unique product line and hopeful financials.\n\nIn a sense, Yext is like Google but for enterprises that require more depth than Google can provide for them, and they actually use Google to help companies advertise and gain traction with consumer base using their APIs that are integrated with consumer platforms. The advertising industry is huge, as we\u2019ve seen Google, Facebook, and Snapchat dominate simply off reaching consumers, and collecting their data. Yext bridges the gap between businesses and unstructured data of potential consumers and existing consumers, setting them up in a multi-billion dollar industry expected to continually increase for the future. \n\nTheir main product line includes Answers: a search engine, Listings: an advertising tool to get your company\u2019s products onto multiple platforms, Pages: a tool that helps get your business at the top of every location search, Reviews: which helps you engage with customer feedback, and Knowledge Graph/Analytics which helps business owners see their customer interactions with their webpages and other online presence. Websites used to be everything for a business but now a business requires presence across multiple platforms and integration with every search engine, map, or social media. The more a business\u2019 online presence is spread the more analytics you need too, and Yext is the amalgamation of the entire business\u2019 internet presence. This cloud-based software is easy to use, and it\u2019s used by several reputable companies; including huge fast food chains, travel companies, car manufacturers and even banks. \n\nYext solves the problem of particular consumer questions and connects the respective business with precisely what the consumer was looking for. Specific questions such as \u201cwealth advisor near me who specializes in healthcare\u201d (an example they used in their past annual report) will become increasingly easier to answer with the newest developments in Artificial Intelligence. The control of the ever-changing facts of a business are what enable it to spread its sales. Up-to-date and relevant information on every nook and cranny of the web has become a necessity, as convenience has become the most necessary commodity. Poor site experience is a huge detractor for the large majority of shoppers, and if businesses are able to retain this potential loss in customers they\u2019d be willing to pay anything. Managing an online presence using one dashboard is going to be a very desirable service for all businesses, regardless of size. Yext links all the chains together in the cloud, for Google Assistant, Alexa, Siri, and even the Chinese WeChat, all services which are improving more and more in terms of their search capabilities and they\u2019re growing in popularity.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe product or service a company provides is the most crucial aspect of a company\u2019s success, and YEXT seems to deliver on its product. The solution requires a subscription that can be priced according to a business\u2019 specific needs. YEXT does not seem to have as many recognizable competitors. Its main competitors, Birdeye and Chatmeter, are both private companies with no real news about an IPO anytime soon, while YEXT has been public on the NYSE for three years. From this perspective, YEXT maintains an advantage over its competitors due to it being more recognizable and financially stronger due to its valuation reaching over a billion after going public. However, a reported issue with the product is that listings may go back to normal after a contract with a small business terminates. This is justifiable, because a small business could use the service for a month and reap all benefits. To improve this aspect of the solution that is controversial, maybe a potential solution could be negotiating a minimum period the contract has to be active in order for listings not to revert when it is terminated. Despite this drawback, Yext Inc. has innovated in this niche field and is emerging as a frontrunner in back-end listing modification.\n\nNow that we have established that YEXT will likely be a frontrunner in structuring advertising data, we need to establish WHY this is a growing industry, as YEXT is heavily dependent on the growth of eCommerce and other forms of online and in person business. Without businesses, Yext will have no source of revenue so the expansion of commerce is critical to Yext\u2019s revenue. Fortunately, eCommerce and small businesses are trending upwards, indicating a healthy future for YEXT. One way to examine if this industry is growing is to analyze advertisement spending, as more online businesses directly correlates to more money spent on advertising. The graph below regarding digital advertising spending clearly illustrates that online business is growing, with advertisement spending nearly doubling over the six years.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/plzhvnh7w1961.png?width=700&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d7bc511f13b8c4b13206acfc3015bfe9d5303176\n\nAnother way to gauge the health of the industry YEXT is heavily dependent on is to take a look at the growing amount of transactions online. Transactions correlate to greater revenue generated via the internet and thus a greater need for YEXT to introduce smaller businesses to this growing market. The chart below from Statista portrays the growth of Mobile POS payments and Digital commerce over seven years, almost tripling in total volume. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img jydysim9w1961...*\n\nOnce again this looks promising for YEXT, as their clients are primarily located in this sect of online business due to accurate data going hand in hand with more online sales. Furthermore, YEXT will be a solid pick for investors in the long term due to its growth along with a growing industry and its solid product. If you are interested in delving deeper into why eCommerce and online payments are growing, be sure to check out the Paypal/Square DD as well.\n\nOn their last 10k, Yext reported the following for their most recent compiled income statement:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f8renwobw1961.png?width=700&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d66290b3c437c25c5798b9130d55f3fdbbd25470\n\nAs you can see for the top line, there are plenty of positive signs. Revenue has grown by over $50M yearly from 2016 to 2019, and from 2019 to 2020 revenues grew by about $70M. So the indicator when it comes to sales is overwhelmingly signaling that this company is well-positioned to grow, especially in the near future. Gross profit margins are also great as the cost of the product itself isn\u2019t much. The potential issues in the income statement show up as you go toward the bottom line. Operating expenses far outweigh gross profits so net profits are -30% despite gross profit margins being 75%. Breaking down Opex, you can see that about \u2154 of them go towards sales and marketing, which isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing as distributing your product can be a huge future investment, but it can be concerning for investors who want a product that \u201csells itself\u201d. Despite this rather arbitrary requirement, the sales growth justifies the spending as it\u2019s obviously working and eventually revenue should far outpace selling expenses. \n\nIn their 10k, they state that their sales expenses primarily had to do with more wages and a higher headcount of employees. As the company\u2019s operations grow, they\u2019ll need more employees to run it in an aggressive growth stage. Despite the constant revenue growth, the stock price has been diluted due to more underwriting in 2019. It may take a while to recover from all the extra supply that was brought into the market, but even if we see more financing in early stages, I personally wouldn\u2019t be concerned as that\u2019s a normal course of action for younger companies.\n\nA quick look at the financials indicates that YEXT is improving as a company over each year. Due to their relatively high amounts of investment, the EPS for the company has remained negative. The EPS was also a lot worse in previous years. However, don\u2019t let this negative metric fool you, as the EPS has been trending positive since the first quarter of 2020. This indicates significant improvement, especially since the EPS hasn\u2019t been improving much prior to 2020. The increase of the EPS is also supported by the increase of change in working capital from $2M to $4M. As for the rest of the cash flow statement, the negative values are primarily caused by the expansion of operations. This expansion of operations is indicated by the increasing total assets, which means that YEXT grew their assets via larger operations. Although the numbers may be negative temporarily, the expansion of operations allows YEXT to generate more revenue from operations and hopefully turn the direction of cash flows around. Constant reinvestment back into the company is a good sign as it indicates owner and shareholder confidence in the future prospect.\n\nFinally, delving into the 10Q provides reassuring prospects for the future health and growth of YEXT as a company. Looking at the breakdown of individual risks, YEXT looks to be relatively secure in the future. The main risks of the company are internal, and are not influenced by factors such as inflation and foreign currency fluctuations. To some, YEXT may appear risky due to its limited financial history and potential unprofitability due to it being relatively new. However, these risks will ultimately be insignificant, as the expansion of operations will soon be recovered by profits if YEXT maintains its current scale of growth that it has achieved in 2020.\n\nIn conclusion, YEXT will be a good pickup for many investors because the enterprise solutions industry overall has done very well, and Yext\u2019s solutions are definitely a foray into the future of artificial intelligence combined with traditional SaaS. If you compare Yext to another company that has a similar premise, Twilio, you can see that Yext\u2019s price/sales ratio is only 1/7th of Twilio\u2019s. Of course, Twilio is far more overvalued and has had better sales growth than Yext this past year, but Yext isn\u2019t a slouch in sales growth either as we\u2019ve seen. Plus, they have far more potential than Twilio does as we\u2019ve seen with their relatively small market cap of $2B. Both companies offer AI-based enterprise solutions, but Yext is just as good if not a better solution for the future as it has more applicability through a variety of businesses. If you want to see similar growth to what we\u2019ve seen in company\u2019s such as Twilio but feel as if you\u2019ve missed the bus, don\u2019t worry: we\u2019ve got the pick for you. Yext is still 25% off its 52-wk high, and they are sure to surpass it with just one or two blowout positive ERs which will be in the books soon.",

        "selftext": "Here's my portfolio and a little reasoning on why I bought each stock and why I'm holding what I hold. I always find it interesting to look at other people's portfolios so here you go. Hope you find it interesting and let me know your thoughts!\n\n**GHIV - 46.35% portfolio diversity.**\n\nThis is a SPAC with a merger set to go forth with United Wholesale Mortgage. I'm normally not a big fan of value plays but this one seems too enticing for me to not go with. I'm sure you all have read a decent bit about this so I'll keep it short. They have fantastic revenue, the circumstances are great for them, they pay a 40 cent dividend, institutional people like them, we like them, comparing them to RKT I feel good about this.\n\n**NPA - 13.45% portfolio diversity.**\n\nAnother one you've probably heard a lot about but I like this because it's probably the future of cell service and their competition with SpaceX isn't too direct.\n\n**NOVS - 5.14% portfolio diversity.**\n\nThis company deals with greenhouse farming. It's really interesting actually and I believe it's part of the future of farming. The people in the industry know this is the way for the future and the Netherland does it and does it well. It's smart, it's fresh to get to a huge chunk of the country, solid stuff.\n\n**STIC - 4.93% portfolio diversity.**\n\nThis is one where I bought in a little high but I still like the company. They have a merger with BarkBox. BarkBox is a subscription company with about 10 years behind them and reaching some solid growth and revenue. The market is growing domestically and worldwide and I assume it will continue this trend. They're a popular company and people like them. I think they can get people to continue their subscriptions and have some big growth.\n\n**INVT -  4.58% portfolio diversity.**\n\nThis is one of the few non-SPAC stocks on the list, but it's genetics stuff, which I like.\n\n**JWS - 4.42% portfolio diversity.**\n\nThis is a SPAC with a merger with Cano Health. It's the largest growing health care provider for the second year now, with 7000% annual growth. I believe it was chapter 8 of the Psychology of Money where it said that you should invest in companies you love and this is exactly that. It's all about serving the underserved communities. I like the ethical views of the person running the SPAC and the Cano's CEO. More on the leadership team, the person running the merger and the CEO of Cano are looking to be more business partners than investor-CEO. The merger is great for extra funding to Cano but a big thing they're looking for is leadership from the guy in charge of the SPAC. The CEO seems good, but the SPAC guy has the experience that will work together well with him.\n\n**GIK - 4.33% portfolio diversity.**\n\nMerger with Lightning eMotors. This one is more speculative that it will just go up and maybe there's some chance at long term success but this is more short term since I really don't think they can compete with Tesla.\n\n**CFII - 2.41% portfolio diversity.**\n\nAcquisition with View, a window company with high-level stuff. I like this company a good bit but the only problem I have with it is that their valuation is just so high so I'll probably see what happens and most likely will sell right before the merger.\n\n**PSTH - 3.03% portfolio diversity.** \n\nBill Ackman SPAC with no merger. My thinking is to just use it as a place to park some money and I used to have more shares, but I took a good chunk out since right now it's looking more and more like an overpriced pile of cash but still holding to this share. I think Ackman has solid stuff going on and there's more reasoning for this one, but the main idea here is a place to park money where it seems like it should grow short term. And if not and it goes down, I'm relatively confident about this for the longer term.\n\n**BOWX - 2.25% portfolio diversity.**  \nNo merger announced. This is really just a place to store my cash and spice things up a little since it's fairly close to the net asset value and I like the people running it, a solid background in data (founder of TIBCO). Hoping for a target in data analytics but we will see.   \n**LGVW - 2.16% portfolio diversity.**  \nThis is one where I honestly should've bought more on the dip because it's such a solid and well-trusted company by everyone in the industry, but it was more than $4 above the SPAC's net asset value at the time and I didn't have the hindsight, which is fine. Target is Butterfly Network. They do ultrasounds and such and what I love about this company is that the people who work in the sector love their product and swear by them. I also like the purpose of the company. Their goal is to make high-quality ultrasound imaging affordable and widely available to those who would have been worse off. It does good stuff and makes the world a better place. They are the leader in what they do and have and they're the ones transforming the business of ultrasounds, not the other way around. The final note on this is that they have institutional backing from the right people who are very long term on the stock. I plan to hold this after the merger and for a good amount of time.\n\n**BFT - 1.65% portfolio diversity.**\n\nHas a merger with Paysafe. I'm sure you've all heard enough DD's and enough articles and research to show this has a lot of promise. I like this company but I don't have more of it because there's so much competition from Square and PayPal and I think those two are great companies. However, I think Paysafe has its own thing to offer but we will see.\n\n**CLA - 1.48% portfolio diversity.**\n\nThis does stuff that's very similar to what $LAZR does and we all saw how well that went.\n\n**FUSE+ (2 warrants) - 0.56% portfolio diversity.**\n\nThis one, I admit, is a speculative buy. I'm just a fan of the team behind it and see some potential. It's a spac with no merger announced yet, but they aim to have a SPAC target in fintech. Their valuation target for the company also went to $10 billion which gives a lot more options for better targets. The final note is that there has been a very high volume. Could just be the market doing its own weird thing but could also be some insider knowledge. I'm just taking my chances on this one because I think the balance of probability is on my side and this is one I can afford to lose.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't need to be right on all of these at all. My hope is just that the balance of probability ends up in my favor. A lot of these are interesting companies that I think will do some good for the world so I don't mind putting money into a company that moves the world towards a good cause.",

I have seen a land of tendies unparalleled. \n\nAffirm, the buy now pay later company will ipo some time this or next month and they will skyrocket like PLTR to the moon. I bet my left and only nut on it for these reasons:\n\n1) millennials and everyone else wants more shit but too many are YOLOing it on other shit. So Affirm will give you the chance to buy it today and pay for it upto 6 months later, free money equals tendies, at least that\u2019s what they want us retards to think. If enough retards fall for it then the late fees could be enough to get some nice WAP tendies.\n\n2) Max Levchin (no clue how to spell that shit) is one of those PayPal autists. You know who else are an PayPal autists? Peter thiel and Elon musk. Enough said as the tendies write themselves\n\n3) my wife\u2019s boyfriend Tyrone told me he likes affirm\u2019s fundamentals... whatever the fuck that means. But if Tyrone said it then who am I to disbelieve. \n\n4) I owe affirm a lot of money and if I default then I can collect it back on the IPO cause that\u2019s how it works.\n\n\nOne day we will look back on this moment and screech autistic noises of joy as we all T-pose on Tyrone before he puts us to bed.",

The tool is inclusive of almost 1,000 tickers now.\n\n**What is this tool good for**\n\nI posted in ThetaGang the list with HIGH IV options which is great for running the wheel or selling options. This list is an inverse of that list and displays tickers where IV is pretty low, thus, purchasing calls will likely be cheaper. For example, AAPL implied volatility right now is almost back to the pre-March lows. Remember a low IV can go lower and a high IV can go higher. Do your DD before entering any positions!\n\n# Low IV Tickers List\n\n\\*Some of the market cap data is off, so always double check before entering any plays!\n\nPlease note this list is only inclusive of the more popular tickers mentioned around Reddit.

        "selftext": "With 2020 over, I decided to look at the regional geographic distribution of North America's \"mega\" cap corporations ($50b+ market capitalization) by headquarters.\n\nHere's the graphic I made laying that out: [https://i.imgur.com/t37BQWc.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/t37BQWc.jpg)\n\nNorth America has 152 mega cap companies, 145 in the United States and 7 in Canada. Mexico has 2 companies right on the cusp (Walmex at $49b and America Movil at $49b), but misses the cusp. Maybe next year.\n\nThese 152 companies have a market cap of $27.06 trillion. 97.7% is in the USA. 2.3% is in Canada.\n\nTo be clear, these companies are grouped based on the location of their headquarters, aka where high-level executive decisions are made (where CEO/President/Chairman/Board/executive management generally resides). Of course, these companies have multinational operations and their workforce is spread throughout.\n\nSome thoughts:\n\n* The U.S. gained $5.586 trillion in mega cap market value in the past year. Canada gained $97 billion. North America gained $5.683 trillion total.\n* The West Coast had a banner year due to COVID pandemic and general inertia. With 56.6 million people (of North America's 580 million, or 9.8%) it is now home to 46 companies who combined have 52.4% of North America's mega cap market value. Last year, these 145 companies had a market cap of $21.4 trillion, and the West Coast had 42.4% of the share. So the West Coast captured 10% of the mega cap \"market share\" in one year.\n* Mega cap market value increased by 26.79% in the United States and 18.34% in Canada. In both cases, the increase was due to tech growth. In Canada, Shopify's growth alone makes up nearly the entirety of Canada's growth. Shopify went from not being mega cap ($46b) on January 1, 2020, to having a market cap of $137 billion a year later, or 198% growth. If you exclude Shopify from Canada's listing, Canada's mega cap only grew by 1.24%, showing how countries without competitive tech industries will fall behind in the coming decade. If Shopify can continue to grow in the coming years, it will do wonders to shift Canada's mega cap value away from dying (energy) and stagnant (finance) industries.\n* The same tech shift was noticeable throughout the U.S. The West Coast's mega cap market value increased by a whopping 52.9% from $9.067 trillion to $13.863 trillion. Tesla alone added $593 billion of market capitalization, or nearly the entire mega cap value of Canada. The rest of the U.S. had mixed growth. The Great Lakes and Southeast had 12.75% market cap growth and 12.80% market cap growth, respectively. The Northeast, heavy on traditional industries and finance, only grew by 4.56%. The Southwest declined by 5.32% due to the oil shock and Exxon's market cap collapse.\n* Of the 7 North American companies among the Top 10 globally, we have the following growth:  \n\n   * Alphabet: +$264 billion market cap growth\n   * Amazon: +$714 billion market cap growth\n   * Apple: +$968 billion market cap growth\n   * Berkshire Hathaway (the only non-tech): -$8 billion market cap growth\n   * Facebook: +$193 billion market cap growth\n   * Microsoft: +$482 billion market cap growth\n   * Tesla: +$593 billion market cap growth\n   * **TOTAL: +$3.206 trillion**\n* As the numbers above show, the 7 companies above grew by $3.206 trillion. So these 7 alone account for 57.4% of the U.S. gain, and 56.4% of North America's. They also account for 67% of the West Coast increase just due to sheer size, even if smaller tech companies had much better percentage growth rates than all but Tesla.\n* Two companies IPOd straight into mega cap territory: Airbnb and Snowflake. Both are seriously overvalued and I can't imagine them sustaining those levels.\n* If 2021 is a year of recovery, I could also see a correction, with money being pulled from the safety of big tech back into traditional industries. So next year's snapshot might be far less imbalanced than the +53% West Coast, +5% Northeast dynamic we had this year.\n* HQ relocations are a big question mark. This year alone, Charles Schwab and Oracle moved their HQs to Texas (though the former's isn't final final until January 21). If Paypal or Tesla move to Texas in 2021, the West Coast dominance could be reduced even further.\n\nAny other thoughts?",

        "selftext": "Hello everyone! Looking for seasoned advice on where to go from here. I started to invest recently (I know it\u2019s an easy market climate to make money in atm) but it\u2019s definitely a long term commitment I\u2019m looking to make and very willing to weather the ups and downs. Before I make a longer term commitment I know I need to diversify a little bit more than I currently am, as I have quite a bit invested in growth stocks (clean energy). Here are some of my positions: \n\nICLN, RIDE, PLUG, STOR, PBD, OPTT, Tan, JPM, BLDP, AQN, JMIA ,PYPL &amp; LITE. \n\nI guess before I commit more I\u2019ll take any diversifying advice I can get! I know it\u2019s a lot in energy and for sure looking to spread it out a little. \n\nThank you!",

        "selftext": "Hi All,\n\nI am based in Burnaby, BC. I have been actively investing in individual stocks since 2018 with success.\n\nThe majority of my money has been put to work with US &amp; Canadian-based publicly traded companies.\n\nWhen I heard the news that PayPal and Square were making sizeable investments in Bitcoin a few months, I took this as a sign that it was time to look at Bitcoin more seriously. I spent hours watching YouTube videos and reading articles on Bitcoin, and became fascinated by it's finite characteristics.\n\nAbout a month ago, I opened a Coinbase account and started buying small amounts of Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). My mind has been blown ever since. It seems like the value of my investments in both assets has been going up by the hour. Everyday I wake up to more money in my account. \n\nAs a Canadian I feel like I have been misled and oppressed by the dinosaur Canadian Banks and their 18% credit card products and .05% savings accounts for so long. To have access to a saving / investment vehicle like Bitcoin and/or Ethereum brings feelings of liberation and hope to my life right now. I understand the party could end at any time, but it feels like something special is happening right now at the same time.\n\nI wanted to put this opportunity on everyones radar. \n\nIf you are actively investing in Bitcoin, Ethereum, or other crypto currencies. Are you noticing the same opportunity as me? What are your thoughts?\n\nP.S. typically I have been skeptical of Bitcoin and the crypto currency world, but that changed for me a few months ago. I can't believe what unfolding before my eyes while invested in this space day by day.",
