        "selftext": "I'd like to invest in VR and I'd like some input. I think VR is going to be quite successful in the future. It has a lot of room to grow and many possibilities. People always try it and like it, and FB is working on getting rid of any barriers that prevent people from buying it. For example, owning a PC, having to pay over 500, etc. \n\nFB recently announced that they would be releasing a new all-in-one headset soon, and I think it will sell quickly and lead to VR becoming quite popular.  \n\nQualcomm was involved in making the chips in the oculus headset, and will likely be the ones supplying them for the upcoming one.\n\nI'm split between which one to invest in. Sadly, even with a very successful VR launch, VR is a very minor aspect for them, and will probably not affect stock price much. \n\nI looked at companies like htc, but I think the oculus will keep heavily outperforming competitors. \n\nAny thoughts? \n\nI almost invested in qcom at 143$ and it jumped up by about 8$ just a few days later.

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, August 2, 2021**\n\nStocks continued volatility from last week, with the three major indexes opening the day in the green before turning lower towards the end in the first trading session in August. As has been the case for at least a few weeks now, it seems the market will continue to perform a careful balancing act between record corporate profits and expectations for economic expansion and concerns surrounding the highly contagious coronavirus Delta variant and inflation. \n\nSo far, 59% of the companies in the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) have reported Q2 earnings, with 88% of these beating analyst expectations, according to FactSet. This quarter is shaping up to be another record-breaking one, with corporate earnings growth rate expected to accelerate 85%, which would be the biggest jump since the Q4 20009. \n\nHowever, it is important to note that, despite beating earnings expectations, a number of these companies have pulled back, with tepid outlooks moving forward overshadowing strong results. Moving forward, given that most companies have so far exceeded pre-pandemic levels and the current quarter has an easy comparison to last year, expectations for growth are inevitably going to moderate. This said, I think the pullback in some stocks following earnings is an overreaction. \n\nIn the last few weeks, concerns over the coronavirus Delta variant are increasing, which inevitably, has injected volatility in the markets. Last week, the CDC reversed their indoor mask policy. The agency now recommends that even fully vaccinated individuals begin once again wearing masks indoors in areas with high coronavirus transmission and in K-12 schools. Dr. Rochelle Walensky, Director of the CDC said, \u201cIn areas with substantial and high transmission, CDC recommends fully vaccinated people wear masks in public, indoor settings to help prevent the spread of the delta variant, and protect others. This includes schools\u201d. \n\nAs I have said before and will explain further below, while the surge in cases is unfortunate, it is important to note that the surge is largely concentrated in areas with high vaccine hesitancy. Moreover, while cases are surging, thankfully, hospitalizations and death rates are much lower when compared to previous surges, a sign that the vaccine is doing its job. While it doesn\u2019t prevent one from becoming infected, it greatly reduces the possibility for complications. \n\nIn the US, despite roughly 50% of the population being vaccinated, in the past two weeks, infections across the country have roughly doubled, with new cases jumping from 13,200 on July 4 to 78,433 as of July 31, according to data compiled by John Hopkins University. However, it is important to note, despite the surge the 7-day average of deaths is 360, once again according to John Hopkins University. \n\nAccording to data from the CDC, 97% of people who have died or been hospitalized with COVID-19 since the vaccine became widely available are unvaccinated. Dr Rochelle Walensky, Director of CDC said of the rising cases, \u201cThere is a clear message that is coming through. This is becoming a pandemic of the unvaccinated. Our biggest concern is we are going to continue to see preventable cases, hospitalizations, and sadly deaths among the unvaccinated.\u201d Sadly, despite the widespread availability of the vaccine in the US, hesitancy in certain places remains very high.\n\nMoreover, last week, the Fed released its July Monetary Policy Report largely reiterated what members of the Fed have been saying for months, but did include some new language hinting that the economic recovery is getting closer to the Fed\u2019s stated goals. The report also acknowledged potential risks and stated the Fed was ready to act if \u201cappropriate risks arise\u201d. The statement read, \u201cIn assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee's goals. The Committee's assessments will take into account a wide range of information, including readings on public health, labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments.\u201d\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* In a big industry move, Square (SQ) acquired Australian fin-tech company Afterpay, which allows customers to pay in installments, for $29 billion in an all-stock transaction. Square released a statement that read, \u201cSquare plans to integrate Afterpay into its existing Seller and Cash App business units, enable even the smallest of merchants to offer BNPL \\[buy now, pay later\\] at checkout, give Afterpay consumers the ability to manage their installment payments directly in Cash App, and give Cash App customers the ability to discover merchants and BNPL offers directly within the app.\u201d\n* Along with the Afterpay announcement, SQ unexpectedly announced Q2 earnings, which showed gross profit growing 91% thanks to strong Cash App and Seller ecosystem growth. The company reported revenue of $4.68 billion, 87% growth year-on-year but below the the $5.03 billion expected. Earnings per share skyrocketed to $0.66 compared to $0.30 expected.\n* Google announced it was moving away from Qualcomm (QCOM) and would begin manufacturing its own in-house processors for new Pixel phones launching later this year. This follows a similar move to what Apple (AAPL) did to Intel (INTC).\n* Ford Motors (F) Chief Financial Officer John Lawler said the company hopes to reinstate a dividend by the end of the year. He said, \u201cWe've had a really tough period of time here the last couple of years with Covid last year and now the chip shortage. We plan to bring the dividend back as soon as we can...depending on how the second half goes with \\[computer\\] chips, it could be as early as the end of this year.\u201d Ford suspended its dividend last year.\n* Electric vehicle sales in China more than tripled in July compared to a year ago. \n   * Nio delivered 7,931 vehicles in July, 124% increase YoY\n   * Xpeng (XPEV) delivered 8,040 vehicles, 228% increase YoY\n   * Li (LI) delivered 8,589 vehicles, 251% increase YoY\n* \\*\\***Please note that current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect closing prices\\*\\***\n* Abbvie (ABBV) with two target raises.

        "selftext": "Ok idiots listen up AMD is now headed to $269 before EOY.\n\nHere is why:\n1) Intel is getting pantsed by AMD\n2) NVDA is the benchmark stock for AMD to compare against\n3) XLNX merger closes in November (potentially earlier)\n\nFor you non nerds: Smart Intel engineers went to go to work for Facebook, Amazon, Google, Tesla. The idiots that remained screwed up massively over the last 2 years getting ready for the next generations of chips.\nSemiconductor manufacturing is complicated and takes 3 years to work out the kinks on the new technology. TSMC is good and Intel sucks. This will continue for 2-3 more years minimum.\n\n\n1.AMD revenue growth. Last week announced 99% yearly growth. Still room to grow after pulling down Intel\u2019s pants (10% market share for EPYC today, every cloud and enterprise customer is now validating EPYC).\n\n2. NVIDIA is run by the Elon Musk of the semiconductor industry. Jensen has been CEO longer than all the other semiconductor CEOs combined (Internet+Broadcom+Qualcomm+AMD+TSMC+AMD). NVDA earned their 94 p/e. Whose next? AMD\n\n3. Big players are arbitraging XLNX acquisition. Once this selling pressure disappears (presumably around merger closing) it\u2019s gonna rip.\n\nAt the end of this (rev growth, reduced selling pressure, P/E matching NVDA today) AMD will be at $269.",

        "selftext": "\n\nSHANGHAI, Aug 3 (Reuters) - China's regulatory agency is launching an investigation into chip distributors in the auto industry, citing suspicions of price gouging, it said on Tuesday.\n\nThe action by the State Administration For Market Regulation (SAMR) is the latest in a regulatory crackdown following a range of companies and industries targeted over the past year as the Chinese government clamps down on industry.\n\n\"In response to prominent problems such as speculation and high prices in the automotive chip market, the State Administration of Market Supervision has recently filed an investigation on car chip distributors,\" the agency said.\n\nThe firms were suspected of driving up prices, based on price monitoring and reporting clues, it added in its statement, and vowed to investigate and punish illegal acts such as hoarding, price-gouging and collusion.\n\nA global shortage of chips that began last December has disrupted supply chains and the hardware sector worldwide. Though initially concentrated in the automotive sector, it has since spread to affect a wide range of gadgets.\n\nPanic about supply uncertainty has occasionally led chip buyers and distributors to purchase more chips than they need, creating a vicious cycle that further drives up prices.\n\nIn June, the chief executive of chipmaker Intel said he expected the shortage to hit bottom by year-end, with the market retuning to normalcy only by 2023.\n\nIn April China's regulator imposed a record fine of $2.75 billion on e-commerce giant Alibaba for engaging in anti-competitive practices.\n\nhttps://www.reuters.com/technology/china-regulator-investigate-auto-chip-distributors-suspicion-price-gouging-2021-08-03/\n\n**Ok, this is getting a bit out of hand. A constant barrage of bearish news coming out of China after some stabilizing that happened at the end of last week. Not sure what the endgame here is for China or the CCP. On one hand, it makes no sense for them to lose the confidence of foreign investors with moves like this. Are they pushing the boundaries of patience of investors? Or is this a deliberate attempt to crackdown on each sector one by one?**\n\n*Stocks likely to be affected by this: AMD, INTC, QCOM, NVDA. If you know some others that are a part of the cars in China, please post them in the comments*",

Intel is securing its foothold in the semiconductor industry by building infrastructure, acquiring companies, and signing contracts. \n\n\tIntel wants to increase chip output and drive down its average costs to stay ahead of the competition. Intel is expanding into the automotive, consumer electronics, and foundries industry. Intel faces stiff competition from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) and Samsung. All three companies have announced plans to increase research development by 2023-24.\n\n\tMoore's Law is key to understanding how the chip shortage occurred and how to prevent it from happening again.
