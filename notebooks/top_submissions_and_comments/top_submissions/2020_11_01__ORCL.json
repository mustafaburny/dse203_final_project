        "selftext": "Read first, thank me later. **AvePoint, the Largest Microsoft 365 Data Management Solutions Provider, Announced a $2bn Merger in a definite business combination with Apex Technology Acquisition Corporation** (NASDAQ: APXT). The post-closing entity will be listed on NASDAQ under new ticker AVPT and maintain the AvePoint name. The transaction has been approved by the Board of Directors of Apex, as well as the Board of Directors of AvePoint and it is expected to finalise in Q1 2021\n\n**// About AvePoint**\n\nAvePoint is the largest data management solutions provider for the Microsoft cloud, with over 1,300 employees in 29 global offices. Key takeaway:\n\n* AvePoint was founded in 2001 as a company to help ease the complexity of SharePoint installations, which at the time were all on-premise. Today, it has adapted to the shift to the cloud as a SaaS tool and primarily acts as a policy layer enabling companies to make sure employees are using these tools in a compliant way\n\n[Company's Footprint](https://preview.redd.it/hc09mm676r161.png?width=2336&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1bcd7d11a2681c0cc6d44c7a0f79996caf32b8a1)\n\n* Huge diversified blue-chip client base, \\~7 million members (as of Sep 30, 2020) with 16k accounts and 25% of Fortune 500 using the company\u2019s services. 7M users represent 3% or 250M Microsoft 365 client base with an estimated addressable market of $33 billion by 2022 (according to IDC). The Company sells directly to large and mid-market enterprises, and its solutions are also available to managed services providers on more than 100 cloud marketplaces globally. Regarding Microsoft, the company \u201cBridges the Gap Between What Microsoft Cloud Offers and What the Enterprise Requires\u201d\n\n[Blue-Chip Client Base](https://preview.redd.it/0uk448a96r161.png?width=1876&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b61eb238ce37f141bdce97e697dfeb83d3c65384)\n\n* Compared to other recent SPAC deals and business combinations we just saw, AvePoint has indeed a great track record. Expected 2020 revenues @ USD 148M, a + 26% YoY increase (78% recurring revenues). There are 212 public software companies and AvePoint is one of 5 that is growing at a rate of more than 25% revenue while maintaining a 14% EBIT margin and 30% ARR growth. The company is projecting significant growth for the next two years with revenue estimates of $257 million and ARR of $220 million by the end of 2022\n\n[Strong Financials](https://preview.redd.it/5bvco38b6r161.png?width=2676&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9b300e2cab1456089b024f5cfd61c6f598d80d7f)\n\n* Great market trends. Explosive data growth, increasing data regulations, shifts to the cloud, hyper growth of Microsoft Teams were all trends that fuelled the growth prior to the pandemic. The impacts of COVID-19 have greatly accelerated these trends\n\n[Current and Future Potential](https://preview.redd.it/jwg00s6d6r161.png?width=2704&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=03e3dcfdd8f3fea45a494e49e9bb81d55857287a)\n\n* The company raised $200 million in January this year led by Sixth Street Partners (formerly TPG Sixth Street Partners), with additional participation from prior investor Goldman Sachs. The company has raised a total of $294 million in capital before the reverse merger announcement\n\n**// About APXT**\n\n* Outstanding management: led by Oracle CFO Jeff Epstein (\\*cough\\* didn\u2019t kill himself \\*cough\\*) and former Goldman Sachs Head of Technology Investment Banking Brad Koenig. Their combined experience includes more than 100 technology IPOs, Served on 20 boards and advisory boards and saw mergers involving companies such as Microsoft, Oracle, Ebay,, Dell, Yahoo! and Twilio\n* Apex\u2019s balance of $352 million plus a $140 million additional private investment will be handed over to AvePoint. Once transaction fees and other considerations are paid for, AvePoint is expected to have $252 million on its balance sheet. Existing AvePoint shareholders will own approximately 72% of the combined entity, with the balance held by the Apex SPAC and the private investment owners. Implied enterprise value of 9.0x 2021E revenue with very attractive valuation multiples compared to peers\n\n[Transaction Details](https://preview.redd.it/0ldackve6r161.png?width=2782&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8e9ec5264c32e5db6076833fbea655a4b2dfe47b)\n\n**// Advisors**\n\nEvercore Group L.L.C., Citigroup Global Markets Inc., Goldman Sachs &amp; Co.

Business combination already approved means less risk on that side (if compared to Tuscan for instance) but very huge upside potential\n* Pre-market stands @ +42%. I would buy R1, forget about it all the way to 80% capital invested TP @ \\~+30%. Look at the overall market conditions in Dec and TP the remaining funds @ +60% upside. But I\u2019m less degenerate than you guys are\n\n*Disclaimer: all images should be credited to AvePoint or the above-mentioned sources.

        "selftext": "So we all know about Roblox, Airbnb, DoorDash, and Affirm IPO-ing this year. I'm here to tell you there's one company that is beyond slept on. Introducing Palantir's little brother, [C3.AI](https://C3.AI)\n\n# What is [C3.AI](https://C3.AI)?\n\nFor those of you that actually care about a company before dumping your McDonald's paycheck into it, here's some info. C3 markets itself as an Enterprise AI company founded by Thomas Siebel. For those that don't know, Thomas Siebel created Siebel Systems which revolutionized Consumer Relationship Management and was later bought out by Oracle. Now back to the Enterprise AI bit. Basically traditionally companies go through different vendors for each of their AI and ML needs. C3 aims to fix that problem by offering an entire suite of tools that are inter-compatible with each other causing easier usability and more productivity. They have contracts in essentially every industry with companies such as 3M, Shell, and Raytheon, AsrtraZeneca and received a $95M contract with the Department of Defense for the F35 fighters and the US Air Force for maintenance on older aircraft.\n\n# Why [C3.AI](https://C3.AI)?\n\nI won't bother you with words but I'll let the pictures from their S-1 filing do the job.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ojd7b196g8261.png?width=2449&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=94feeb7f9d8e37cccd803983b5a928e613750b05\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gpb7nry6g8261.png?width=2449&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3651e1b7a1bd403774524bfdfdb88d4b8cb979a7\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9pzly028g8261.png?width=7680&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=76afb284750b4698c2c57049637600a9a964f71f\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mvwi9gw8g8261.png?width=7680&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=22b05a4f6bf3c833982f82666063674e6be99291\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8guycek9g8261.png?width=3840&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1008e2507e9d0afb904fc24a70ca50272dd0cf74\n\n# The TL;DR\n\nSaaS Model-Driven Architecture\n\nGovernment Contracts\n\nIntegration with major cloud players\n\n71% Year on Year Growth\n\n# TL;DR of the TL;DR\n\nPalantir took us to the moon but [C3.AI](https://C3.AI) will make sure we get to the moon.\n\nShares couple days after IPO for the dip then load up on LEAPs when it IPOs\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the link to their [S1 filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1577526/000162828020016443/c3ais-1.htm) where I got most of the information from.",

        "selftext": "\nAPXT has reached a deal to merge with AvePoint, the largest Microsoft 365 Data Management Solutions Provider. The company is being valued at $2 billion and will trade under AVPT.\n\nAPXT has a huge client base already, at an estimated 7 million members. 25% of the Fortune 500 uses Avepoint.\n\n'AvePoint\u2019s 7 million customers represent a 3% share of Microsoft\u2019s 250 million 365 users. AvePoint believes it can get to 10% share and Microsoft will hit 500 million users in the future, good for 50 million AvePoint future customers.'\n\nAddressable market: $33 billion by 2022.\n\nThe company ALREADY HAS REVENUE (unlike other SPACs), which is expected to total $148 million by the end of this year. A large % of this is recurring revenue as well, with 78% of revenues in 2020 estimated to be recurring. Expected revenue CAGR of 30% to 2022.\n\n**5-time winner of Microsoft Partner of the Year award.**\n\nManagement: 'Apex is led by former Oracle CFO Jeff Epstein and former Goldman Sachs Head of Technology Investment Banking Brad Koenig'. These are huge, knowledgeable players. They can turn this company into a goliath, especially with the extra capital from a SPAC.\n\nBig name backers: Sixth Street Partners, Goldman Sachs,\n\nBig advisors on the deal, including Goldman Sachs, Evercore and Citigroup.\n\nThis seems similar to the other data related plays weve had this year \\*cough\\* PLTR \\*cough\\*. Not the same type, but definitely in a growth market with strong margins. Also allows you to diversify away from EVs a bit.\n\nThe SPAC hasn't run yet, currently trading at $10.75 per share, so this has a lot of room to run. Very little downside, but huge potential upside.\n\nSources:\n\n[https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201123005590/en/AvePoint-the-Largest-Microsoft-365-Data-Management-Solutions-Provider-Announces-2bn-Merger](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201123005590/en/AvePoint-the-Largest-Microsoft-365-Data-Management-Solutions-Provider-Announces-2bn-Merger)\n\n[https://www.avepoint.com/](https://www.avepoint.com/)\n\n[https://www.marketwatch.com/story/microsoft-cloud-partner-avepoint-going-public-via-merger-with-blank-check-company-apex-technology-2020-11-23](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/microsoft-cloud-partner-avepoint-going-public-via-merger-with-blank-check-company-apex-technology-2020-11-23)\n\n[https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/avepoint-public-via-spac-valued-160729256.html](https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/avepoint-public-via-spac-valued-160729256.html)\n\n[https://www.benzinga.com/m-a/20/11/18489999/microsoft-cloud-provider-avepoint-going-public-via-apex-technology-spac](https://www.benzinga.com/m-a/20/11/18489999/microsoft-cloud-provider-avepoint-going-public-via-apex-technology-spac)\n\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nDisclaimer: I have APXT shares and this does not constitute financial advice.",

        "selftext": "supp guys, hope you are ready for another busy week of loss porn and short selling reports that gonna destroy your accounts. \n\nFor all those of you who missed the pltr and gme train or are too scared to get in (if you are than gtfo of this subreddit), I'm going to show you a company that is so undervalued it hurts and its to take off soon\ud83d\ude80\n\n**So what is Alteryx?**\n\nglad you asked, Alteryx is a data analytics data science company that provides a platform for companies to perform analysis of the data, share it, and deploy lots of analytic models. The platform can be used by business analysts, programmers, and trained data scientists. The company wants to solve the problem of wasting time in the organization for doing simple Data analytics. As for 2020 60 BILLION DOLLARS per year wasted on analysts doing repetitive manual work in spreadsheets. The uniqueness of this company is that the interface of the platform is very intuitive and user friendly, using drag and drop interface and mainly reduces the need to write complex software code. Their platform is designed to interact with almost any data source, starting from IBM, Microsoft, Oracle, and SAP to AWS, Google Analytics, Workday, and more.\n\n**Who are the customers?**\n\nSo the company has, as of 2020, approx. 7000 customers in more than 90 countries and big names like Netflix, Salesforce, Toyota, Chevron, Uber, Twitter, Xerox, Nasdaq, and many more. The company already has a name in the big boys' playground and we can expect it to continue to expand. \n\n**Tell me more, please.**\n\nNo problem amigo. The company continues its growth strategy by a series of acquisitions mainly for developing tools and talented people. in 2019 they acquired ClearStory Data mainly because the developers are very good and can leverage them to help to develop and improve their tools. They acquired Feature Labs to augment their machine learning capabilities and to penetrate to the East coast of the US. Also the company announced strategic alliances with Adobe, UiPath and ABBYY to accelerate adoption of APA (analytic process automation) which altreyx is a leader at. \n\nAlteryx is a subscription-based software which makes it a SaaS company the same as TTD, Shopify and so on, but it focuses on analytics. Their main competitors are the big software companies (IBM, Microsoft, SAP) and some small ones which most of them are private.                  So in order to compare them to check if they are under/overvalued, I will use companies in the same field as Datadog, Splunk, and more.\n\n**Let's dig in for some numbers**\n\nAnnual revenue has increased from 86M to 418M in just 4 years (2016-2019) that is a 48% CAGR which is amazing. This year the company expects to grow revenues at around 15% mainly because of covid, which made companies cut expenses.\n\nQ3 revenues growth is 38% YOY, customer growth is 24% YOY.                                                        Gross Margin is 93% (Amazing) Operating Margin is 24%. This company is super efficient and with great margins.\n\nThe company is profitable as of the 3Q with a positive EPS of 0.07. It uses more than 50% of its gross profit for R&amp;D which is exactly what we want to see in a growing tech company.\n\n**Balance Sheet**\n\nCash is down to 95M from 409M mainly because of acquisitions, but short term investments are almost double YOY with 627M. **Current Ration** is 1:4 approx. and **asset to liabilities ratio** is 1:1.5 so the company is indeed solvent and can survive even black swans like covid.                 Liabilities wise the company has 650M in convertible bonds which as we see can be covered by the short-term investments, It is something we should consider when the company starts to underperform, not now though. \n\nCash from Operating Activities for the 3Q is 16.3 M an improvement of 20%                              FCF is negative for the quarter mainly because of the investments they made (240M) \n\nSo the company is performing really well so far this year and is able to grow despite covid and companies reducing expenses. Of course, they need to increase their FCF but as long as they are growing and acquiring companies it's all good.\n\n**Let's use some gay TA to see what's going on**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[AYX 1 day chart](https://preview.redd.it/eu91ywiifd261.jpg?width=1374&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=96335b788ca104400101c7f29fdc13435ce4aac7)\n\nWell as you see AYX is in a range for quite a while (since May) with 104 and 80 acting as support and 150 and 178 as resistance. It hits 104 twice and couldn't break it and in the last 2 weeks, it tried again, and again was denied. \n\nSo the stock can now go to 150 easily or contest again the 104 level. with the tech trend going up I can see it going to retest that 150 level hoping to break it.\n\n**Now we compare this company with other companies**\n\n \n\n* SNOW: \u201821 EV / Rev = \\~100x\n* DDOG: \u201821 EV / Rev = \\~ 40x\n* MongoDB: \u201821 EV / Rev = \\~ 25x\n* **Alteryx: \u201821 EV / Rev = \\~ 15x**\n* JFROG: \u201821 EV / Rev = \\~ 30x \n* PLTR \u201821 EV / Rev = \\~ 50x\n\n(thanks  [u/xwpv8j62](https://new.reddit.com/user/xwpv8j62/) for the info)\n\nAs you see AYX is the most UNDERVALUED company here which means a lot of room to grow.\n\nGross Margin:\n\n**AYX- 92%**\n\nDDOG- 78%\n\nSNOW - 55%\n\nMongoDB- 69%\n\nP/S Ratio:\n\n**AYX-  16.95**\n\nDDOG- 51.71\n\nSNOW - 150.15\n\nMONGODB-  30.88\n\nPLTR - 47.76\n\nAYX has the best margin, best ratios, and still is way undervalued than its peers. This is wrong and YOU have a chance to take advantage of it.\n\n**TL:DR,**  Shares and January Calls at 120/130 strike will do the work.\n\nHave fun guys happy trading and tendies for y'all.",

        "selftext": "Hi,\n\nI work as a PM at a large tech company and as part of my job it's important for me to understand major technology trends. I put this post together to outline a major technology trend (bottoms-up sales) and to analyse some potential investment opportunities to go along with this trend.\n\nPlease let me know if you found this post valuable. I'm considering starting a tech/investing newsletter where I analyse tech trends and look at associated investment opportunities. Would love to know if that's something people would be interested in.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Bottoms-Up Software Sales**\n\nThe \"bottoms up\" go-to-market strategy is the main sales strategy used by some of the world's fastest growing enterprise software companies, from Atlassian to Zoom.\n\nThe premise behind the bottoms-up strategy is simple. Instead of taking a top-down approach, where software is sold directly to company leaders (CEO, CTO etc), bottoms-up software can be adopted by individuals or small teams at a company before expanding to being used company-wide.\n\nFor example, Zoom is often initially adopted by individual salespeople to run a remote sales call before being eventually adopted company-wide to run all company meetings.\n\nThere are huge opportunities for public investors who can understand and identify companies that are successfully using the bottoms-up strategy. In this post, I'll explain the benefits of a bottoms-up strategy and list some exciting public companies using this strategy to their advantage.\n\n## What's so special about bottoms-up?\n\nThere are a number of distinct advantages to the bottoms-up strategy that makes for incredible businesses and investments.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Lower cost of customer acquisition (CAC).** Traditional top-down software companies such as Oracle and SAP spend a massive amount of money on sales. They need to since they are selling to C-level executives and their products typically cost millions to implement. Bottoms-up businesses don't have this problem. Users can sign up to their products directly from the website in minutes. Therefore they spend far less money on sales and can acquire customers for far less.\n* **More money for R&amp;D.** Since bottoms-up companies don't need to employ a large sales force, they can spend more of their revenue on research and development. They can either focus on improving their current product offering or building brand new products.  \n   * This creates a really powerful flywheel effect. Less money spent on sales = more money for R&amp;D = a better and faster improving product = more customers = less money spent on sales....\n* **More chances to be adopted.** Top-down companies only really get one or two chances to sell to a customer. If the CEO doesn't like your sales pitch, there's not much you can do. Bottoms-up companies have hundreds of chances to be adopted since they can be adopted by individual employees or small teams.\n* **You can sell down-market.** Many of the best SaaS (software as a service) products are used by both startups and large companies due to their bottoms-up strategy. This allows them to access a larger total addressable market, generate revenue early, get quicker feedback and to also grow revenue naturally as their customers grow in size. Top-down companies typically don't sell down-market due to the high sales costs involved for them.\n\n## What to look for in a bottoms-up company\n\nNot all bottoms-up companies are created equal. Here are some important things to look out for when evaluating investment opportunities.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Look for a \"receptive\" market.** The bottoms-up strategy is not a one-size-fits-all approach. The approach just doesn't make sense for some products and markets. E.G. Payroll software needs to be adopted company-wide for it to be effective. Whereas project management software can be easily adopted by individuals or small teams. This is a receptive market.\n* **World-class design.** Bottoms-up companies can only be successful if their products can be easily adopted and used by individual users. To provide value quickly, these products need to be intuitive, simple and a joy to use. Look for products that fit this description. If you are unsure on how to evaluate design quality, go to websites such as G2 and read customer reviews.\n* **Growing average revenue per customer.** Bottoms-up products are easily adopted by individual employees. However, the real test of a bottoms-up product is whether or not it spreads within each customer and starts to generate more and more revenue. Look for companies where this is happening. If a bottoms-up company is only growing through new customer acquisition then this is a bad sign. Their product is not being widely adopted at each customer.\n* **High sales efficiency ratio.** In the same vein as the advantage of having a low CAC, high quality bottoms-up companies should have high sales efficiency ratios as they need to employee fewer salespeople than top-down companies.\n* **Moving up-market.** While the ability to sell down-market is a big advantage, you should be wary of companies that only sell down-market. Look for companies that sell to both Fortune 500 companies and startups.\n\n## Bottoms-Up Companies\n\nBelow are some bottoms-up companies that are, in my opinion, great investment opportunities. (Please note, that this is not investment advice and just the companies that I'm excited about for my personal portfolio).\n\n### Asana ($ASAN):\n\nAsana is a project management software company that IPO'd in late September. It is the archetypical bottoms-up company; individual users/teams adopt Asana to run their own projects before it is eventually adopted company-wide as the go-to project management tool.\n\nI like Asana for a couple of reasons:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. **Asana's sales efficiency is 1.15.** This is a very healthy number for a newly public company and shows that their bottoms-up strategy is working very well.\n2. **R&amp;D spend is 64% of revenue.** While this may seem incredibly high to some and could be a negative sign at a more mature company, as explained above bottoms-up companies live and die on the quality of their product. A high % spend on R&amp;D shows that Asana's management clearly understand where their money can create the most long-term shareholder value.\n3. **Product &amp; design quality.** This is an entirely personal opinion but I've used Asana extensively and it's the best-designed project management tool I've ever used.\n4. **YoY revenue growth of 85%.** Even though Asana is a relatively young company, revenue growth of 85% is incredibly impressive.\n\n### Slack ($WORK) :\n\nSlack is a business chat/communications tool for companies. Colleagues can send DMs to each other, create channels (chat rooms), private groups and more. It is becoming the de-facto internal communication channel for many of the world's fastest growing companies.\n\nI like Slack for a couple of reasons:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. **Product stickiness.** Once Slack is adopted company-wide it is incredibly hard to replace. The deep customisation allowed (different channels, private groups etc) and the amount of stored knowledge in the system means that many companies would almost grind to a halt if they could not use it. They would not be able to effectively communicate. This is in contrast to a tool like Zoom, which could be fairly easily replaced if better video conferencing software was available.\n2. **Average user activity is 90 minutes per day.** The average slack user spends 90 minutes every day on the platform. This is an incredible example of the value that slack is providing to it's users and is indicative of a bottoms-up product that is getting adopted company-wide.\n3. **65 of the Fortune 100 use Slack.** As mentioned above, a critical measure of a bottoms-up company is whether or not they can move up-market. Slack is being used by some of the world's fastest growing public companies. It is also used by Amazon, which at the time of writing is the 3rd largest company (by market cap) in the world.\n\n### Honourable Mentions:\n\nBelow are some more bottoms-up companies that are definitely worth investigating.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. Zoom ($ZM)\n2. Atlassian ($TEAM)\n3. Datadog ($DDOG)\n4. Zendesk ($ZEN)\n5. Hubspot ($HUBS)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWould you be interested in reading more posts like this?

The deal values the company at $2 billion.\n\n**What does AvePoint do?** AvePoint migrates, manages, and protects data in Microsoft 365.\n\n**Management with Notable Credentials:** Apex Technology is led by former **Oracle Corporation** CFO **Jeff Epstein** (Unfortunate Name) and Brad Koenig, the former Head of Technology Investment Banking at **Goldman Sachs**.\n\nEpstein [helped ](https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2019/08/15/ex-oracle-cfo-plans-to-shop-for-a-tech-company.html)Oracle complete over 20 acquisitions including the $8.5 billion purchase of BEA Systems and the $7.4 billion acquisition of Sun Microsystems.\n\nKoenig helped on 42 technology IPOs in 1999 that raised $9.6 billion. He was also part of the team that brought **Alphabet Inc** to market in a $1.7 billion IPO. \n\n**Growth Potential According to AvePoint:** AvePoint believes it has an addressable market size of $33 billion by 2022.\n\nAvePoint\u2019s 7 million customers represent a 3% share of Microsoft\u2019s 250 million 365 users. AvePoint believes it can get to 10% share and Microsoft will hit 500 million users in the future, good for 50 million AvePoint future customers.\n\nOf 212 public software companies, AvePoint joins a select group that has revenue of $150 million in 2020, year-over-year revenue growth of 25% or more, and EBIT margins of 10% or more.\n\nThe five companies in the group are **Atlassian Corporation** (NASDAQ: [TEAM](http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=TEAM)), **RingCentral** (NYSE: [RNG](http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=RNG)), **ServiceNow** (NYSE: [NOW](http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=NOW)), **ZoomInfo Technologies** (NASDAQ: [ZI](http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=ZI)), and **Zoom Video Communications** (NASDAQ: [ZM](http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=ZM)).\n\nEach of the five companies in the select group is up more than 80% in 2020, with ZoomInfo seeing a strong 2020 IPO and Zoom Video up more than 500% on the year.\n\n**Financials:** AvePoint is estimating revenue to grow 26% year-over-year to $148 million for fiscal 2020.\n\nThe company is forecasting revenue to hit $193 million and $257 million for fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2022, respectively. AvePoint is increasing its recurring revenue, providing predictable forecasting for its financial estimates.\n\n**Why should you buy?** \n\n* Microsoft Office 365 has a worldwide market share of 41.59%, and Microsoft Powerpoint with 5.06%, for a combined **46.65%**.

(Minimal Risk, if merger fails, you get $10 per share back.)\n\n**Position:** 50 Shares at 10.50.\n\n***Why only 50 shares?*** I'm 18 and broke, so instead of using this money for something like a PlayStation or Macbook, I would rather invest it and hopefully double/triple/quadruple my money. \n\n***HOPEFULLY APXT HITS $20 AND UP BEFORE BOXING DAY.***\n\n***DISCLAIMER: I'M A RETARDED 18 YEAR OLD, DON'T TAKE THIS POST TOO SERIOUSLY, DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH ETC.

        "selftext": "APXT has reached a deal to merge with AvePoint, the largest Microsoft 365 Data Management Solutions Provider. The company is being valued at $2 billion and will trade under AVPT.\n\nAPXT has a huge client base already, at an estimated 7 million members. 25% of the Fortune 500 uses Avepoint.\n\n'AvePoint\u2019s 7 million customers represent a 3% share of Microsoft\u2019s 250 million 365 users.

A large % of this is recurring revenue as well, with 78% of revenues in 2020 estimated to be recurring. Expected revenue CAGR of 30% to 2022.\n\n**5-time winner of Microsoft Partner of the Year award.**\n\nManagement: 'Apex is led by former Oracle CFO Jeff Epstein and former Goldman Sachs Head of Technology Investment Banking Brad Koenig'. These are huge, knowledgeable players. They can turn this company into a goliath, especially with the extra capital from a SPAC.\n\nBig name backers: Sixth Street Partners, Goldman Sachs,\n\nBig advisors on the deal, including Goldman Sachs, Evercore and Citigroup.\n\nThis seems similar to the other data related plays weve had this year \\*cough\\* PLTR \\*cough\\*. Not the same type, but definitely in a growth market with strong margins. Also allows you to diversify away from EVs a bit.\n\nThe SPAC hasn't run yet, currently trading at $10.75 per share, so this has a lot of room to run.

        "selftext": "Hi,\n\nI work as a PM at a large tech company and as part of my job it's important for me to understand major technology trends. I put this post together to outline a major technology trend (bottoms-up sales) and to analyse some potential investment opportunities to go along with this trend.\n\n# Bottom-Up Software Sales\n\nThe \"bottom up\" go-to-market strategy is the main sales strategy used by some of the world's fastest growing enterprise software companies, from Atlassian to Zoom.\n\nThe premise behind the bottom-up strategy is simple. Instead of taking a top-down approach, where software is sold directly to company leaders (CEO, CTO etc), bottom-up software can be adopted by individuals or small teams at a company before expanding to being used company-wide.\n\nFor example, Zoom is often initially adopted by individual salespeople to run a remote sales call before being eventually adopted company-wide to run all company meetings.\n\nThere are huge opportunities for public investors who can understand and identify companies that are successfully using the bottom-up strategy. In this post, I'll explain the benefits of a bottom-up strategy and list some exciting public companies using this strategy to their advantage.\n\n# What's so special about bottom-up?\n\nThere are a number of distinct advantages to the bottom-up strategy that makes for incredible businesses and investments.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Lower cost of customer acquisition (CAC).** Traditional top-down software companies such as Oracle and SAP spend a massive amount of money on sales. They need to since they are selling to C-level executives and their products typically cost millions to implement. Bottom-up businesses don't have this problem. Users can sign up to their products directly from the website in minutes. Therefore they spend far less money on sales and can acquire customers for far less.\n* **More money for R&amp;D.** Since bottom-up companies don't need to employ a large sales force, they can spend more of their revenue on research and development. They can either focus on improving their current product offering or building brand new products.  \n   * This creates a really powerful flywheel effect. Less money spent on sales = more money for R&amp;D = a better and faster improving product = more customers = less money spent on sales....\n* **More chances to be adopted.** Top-down companies only really get one or two chances to sell to a customer. If the CEO doesn't like your sales pitch, there's not much you can do. Bottom-up companies have hundreds of chances to be adopted since they can be adopted by individual employees or small teams.\n* **You can sell down-market.** Many of the best SaaS (software as a service) products are used by both startups and large companies due to their bottom-up strategy. This allows them to access a larger total addressable market, generate revenue early, get quicker feedback and to also grow revenue naturally as their customers grow in size. Top-down companies typically don't sell down-market due to the high sales costs involved for them.\n\n## What to look for in a bottom-up company\n\nNot all bottom-up companies are created equal. Here are some important things to look out for when evaluating investment opportunities.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Look for a \"receptive\" market.** The bottom-up strategy is not a one-size-fits-all approach. The approach just doesn't make sense for some products and markets. E.G. Payroll software needs to be adopted company-wide for it to be effective. Whereas project management software can be easily adopted by individuals or small teams. This is a receptive market.\n* **World-class design.** Bottom-up companies can only be successful if their products can be easily adopted and used by individual users. To provide value quickly, these products need to be intuitive, simple and a joy to use. Look for products that fit this description. If you are unsure on how to evaluate design quality, go to websites such as G2 and read customer reviews.\n* **Growing average revenue per customer.** Bottom-up products are easily adopted by individual employees. However, the real test of a bottoms-up product is whether or not it spreads within each customer and starts to generate more and more revenue. Look for companies where this is happening. If a bottom-up company is only growing through new customer acquisition then this is a bad sign. Their product is not being widely adopted at each customer.\n* **High sales efficiency ratio.** In the same vein as the advantage of having a low CAC, high quality bottom-up companies should have high sales efficiency ratios as they need to employee fewer salespeople than top-down companies.\n* **Moving up-market.** While the ability to sell down-market is a big advantage, you should be wary of companies that only sell down-market. Look for companies that sell to both Fortune 500 companies and startups.\n\n## Bottom-Up Companies\n\nBelow are some bottom-up companies that are, in my opinion, great investment opportunities. (Please note, that this is not investment advice and just the companies that I'm excited about for my personal portfolio).\n\n### Asana ($ASAN):\n\nAsana is a project management software company that IPO'd in late September. It is the archetypical bottom-up company; individual users/teams adopt Asana to run their own projects before it is eventually adopted company-wide as the go-to project management tool.\n\nI like Asana for a couple of reasons:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. **Asana's sales efficiency is 1.15.** This is a very healthy number for a newly public company and shows that their bottom-up strategy is working very well.\n2. **R&amp;D spend is 64% of revenue.** While this may seem incredibly high to some and could be a negative sign at a more mature company, as explained above bottom-up companies live and die on the quality of their product.

Colleagues can send DMs to each other, create channels (chat rooms), private groups and more. It is becoming the de-facto internal communication channel for many of the world's fastest growing companies.\n\nI like Slack for a couple of reasons:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. **Product stickiness.** Once Slack is adopted company-wide it is incredibly hard to replace. The deep customisation allowed (different channels, private groups etc) and the amount of stored knowledge in the system means that many companies would almost grind to a halt if they could not use it. They would not be able to effectively communicate.

        "selftext": "Read first, thank me later. **AvePoint, the Largest Microsoft 365 Data Management Solutions Provider, Announced a $2bn Merger in a definite business combination with Apex Technology Acquisition Corporation** (NASDAQ: APXT). The post-closing entity will be listed on NASDAQ under new ticker AVPT and maintain the AvePoint name. The transaction has been approved by the Board of Directors of Apex, as well as the Board of Directors of AvePoint and it is expected to finalise in Q1 2021\n\n**// About AvePoint**\n\nAvePoint is the largest data management solutions provider for the Microsoft cloud, with over 1,300 employees in 29 global offices. Key takeaway:\n\n* AvePoint was founded in 2001 as a company to help ease the complexity of SharePoint installations, which at the time were all on-premise. Today, it has adapted to the shift to the cloud as a SaaS tool and primarily acts as a policy layer enabling companies to make sure employees are using these tools in a compliant way\n\n[Company's Footprint](https://preview.redd.it/hc09mm676r161.png?width=2336&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1bcd7d11a2681c0cc6d44c7a0f79996caf32b8a1)\n\n* Huge diversified blue-chip client base, \\~7 million members (as of Sep 30, 2020) with 16k accounts and 25% of Fortune 500 using the company\u2019s services. 7M users represent 3% or 250M Microsoft 365 client base with an estimated addressable market of $33 billion by 2022 (according to IDC).

Expected 2020 revenues @ USD 148M, a + 26% YoY increase (78% recurring revenues). There are 212 public software companies and AvePoint is one of 5 that is growing at a rate of more than 25% revenue while maintaining a 14% EBIT margin and 30% ARR growth. The company is projecting significant growth for the next two years with revenue estimates of $257 million and ARR of $220 million by the end of 2022\n\n[Strong Financials](https://preview.redd.it/5bvco38b6r161.png?width=2676&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9b300e2cab1456089b024f5cfd61c6f598d80d7f)\n\n* Great market trends. Explosive data growth, increasing data regulations, shifts to the cloud, hyper growth of Microsoft Teams were all trends that fuelled the growth prior to the pandemic. The impacts of COVID-19 have greatly accelerated these trends\n\n[Current and Future Potential](https://preview.redd.it/jwg00s6d6r161.png?width=2704&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=03e3dcfdd8f3fea45a494e49e9bb81d55857287a)\n\n* The company raised $200 million in January this year led by Sixth Street Partners (formerly TPG Sixth Street Partners), with additional participation from prior investor Goldman Sachs. The company has raised a total of $294 million in capital before the reverse merger announcement\n\n**// About APXT**\n\n* Outstanding management: led by Oracle CFO Jeff Epstein (\\*cough\\* didn\u2019t kill himself \\*cough\\*) and former Goldman Sachs Head of Technology Investment Banking Brad Koenig. Their combined experience includes more than 100 technology IPOs, Served on 20 boards and advisory boards and saw mergers involving companies such as Microsoft, Oracle, Ebay,, Dell, Yahoo! and Twilio\n* Apex\u2019s balance of $352 million plus a $140 million additional private investment will be handed over to AvePoint. Once transaction fees and other considerations are paid for, AvePoint is expected to have $252 million on its balance sheet. Existing AvePoint shareholders will own approximately 72% of the combined entity, with the balance held by the Apex SPAC and the private investment owners.

Business combination already approved means less risk on that side (if compared to Tuscan for instance) but very huge upside potential\n* Pre-market stands @ +42%. I would buy R1, forget about it all the way to 80% capital invested TP @ \\~+30%. Look at the overall market conditions in Dec and TP the remaining funds @ +60% upside.

        "selftext": "Read first, thank me later. **AvePoint, the Largest Microsoft 365 Data Management Solutions Provider, Announced a $2bn Merger in a definite business combination with Apex Technology Acquisition Corporation** (NASDAQ: APXT). The post-closing entity will be listed on NASDAQ under new ticker AVPT and maintain the AvePoint name. The transaction has been approved by the Board of Directors of Apex, as well as the Board of Directors of AvePoint and it is expected to finalise in Q1 2021\n\n**// About AvePoint**\n\nAvePoint is the largest data management solutions provider for the Microsoft cloud, with over 1,300 employees in 29 global offices. Key takeaway:\n\n* AvePoint was founded in 2001 as a company to help ease the complexity of SharePoint installations, which at the time were all on-premise. Today, it has adapted to the shift to the cloud as a SaaS tool and primarily acts as a policy layer enabling companies to make sure employees are using these tools in a compliant way\n* Huge diversified blue-chip client base, \\~7 million members (as of Sep 30, 2020) with 16k accounts and 25% of Fortune 500 using the company\u2019s services. 7M users represent 3% or 250M Microsoft 365 client base with an estimated addressable market of $33 billion by 2022 (according to IDC). The Company sells directly to large and mid-market enterprises, and its solutions are also available to managed services providers on more than 100 cloud marketplaces globally. Regarding Microsoft, the company \u201cBridges the Gap Between What Microsoft Cloud Offers and What the Enterprise Requires\u201d\n* Compared to other recent SPAC deals and business combinations we just saw, AvePoint has indeed a great track record. Expected 2020 revenues @ USD 148M, a + 26% YoY increase (78% recurring revenues). There are 212 public software companies and AvePoint is one of 5 that is growing at a rate of more than 25% revenue while maintaining a 14% EBIT margin and 30% ARR growth. The company is projecting significant growth for the next two years with revenue estimates of $257 million and ARR of $220 million by the end of 2022\n* Great market trends. Explosive data growth, increasing data regulations, shifts to the cloud, hyper growth of Microsoft Teams were all trends that fuelled the growth prior to the pandemic. The impacts of COVID-19 have greatly accelerated these trends\n* The company raised $200 million in January this year led by Sixth Street Partners (formerly TPG Sixth Street Partners), with additional participation from prior investor Goldman Sachs. The company has raised a total of $294 million in capital before the reverse merger announcement\n\n**// About APXT**\n\n* Outstanding management: led by Oracle CFO Jeff Epstein (\\*cough\\* didn\u2019t kill himself \\*cough\\*) and former Goldman Sachs Head of Technology Investment Banking Brad Koenig. Their combined experience includes more than 100 technology IPOs, Served on 20 boards and advisory boards and saw mergers involving companies such as Microsoft, Oracle, Ebay,, Dell, Yahoo! and Twilio\n* Apex\u2019s balance of $352 million plus a $140 million additional private investment will be handed over to AvePoint. Once transaction fees and other considerations are paid for, AvePoint is expected to have $252 million on its balance sheet. Existing AvePoint shareholders will own approximately 72% of the combined entity, with the balance held by the Apex SPAC and the private investment owners. Implied enterprise value of 9.0x 2021E revenue with very attractive valuation multiples compared to peers\n\n**// Advisors**\n\nEvercore Group L.L.C., Citigroup Global Markets Inc., Goldman Sachs &amp; Co. LLC, Evercore and Cowen In\n\n**// TL;DR - Bottom line**\n\n* AvePoint is a Market leading SaaS company, with powerful tailwinds for Microsoft Cloud, a high quality and diversified customer base and compelling historical &amp; expected financial results, business model and valuation\n* APEX after hours trading on Wednesday 25/11 saw a +19.20%, while the trading day closed slightly positive with no significant spike. Business combination already approved means less risk on that side (if compared to Tuscan for instance) but very huge upside potential\n* Pre-market stands @ +10%. I would buy R1, forget about it all the way to 80% capital invested TP @ \\~+30%. Look at the overall market conditions in Dec and TP the remaining funds @ +60% upside. But I\u2019m less degenerate than you guys are\n\n*Disclaimer: all images should be credited to AvePoint or the above-mentioned sources.

        "selftext": "Hi,\n\nI work as a product manager at a large tech company and as part of my job it's important for me to understand major technology trends. I put this post together to outline a major technology trend (bottoms-up sales) and to analyse some potential investment opportunities to go along with this trend.\n\nPlease let me know if you found this post valuable. I'm considering starting a tech/investing newsletter where I analyse tech trends and look at associated investment opportunities. Would love to know if that's something people would be interested in.\n\n## Bottom-Up Software Sales\n\nThe \"bottom up\" go-to-market strategy is the main sales strategy used by some of the world's fastest growing enterprise software companies, from Atlassian to Zoom.\n\nThe premise behind the bottom-up strategy is simple. Instead of taking a top-down approach, where software is sold directly to company leaders (CEO, CTO etc), bottom-up software can be adopted by individuals or small teams at a company before expanding to being used company-wide.\n\nFor example, Zoom is often initially adopted by individual salespeople to run a remote sales call before being eventually adopted company-wide to run all company meetings.\n\nThere are huge opportunities for public investors who can understand and identify companies that are successfully using the bottom-up strategy. In this post, I'll explain the benefits of a bottom-up strategy and list some exciting public companies using this strategy to their advantage.\n\n## What's so special about bottom-up?\n\nThere are a number of distinct advantages to the bottom-up strategy that makes for incredible businesses and investments.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Lower cost of customer acquisition (CAC).** Traditional top-down software companies such as Oracle and SAP spend a massive amount of money on sales. They need to since they are selling to C-level executives and their products typically cost millions to implement. Bottom-up businesses don't have this problem. Users can sign up to their products directly from the website in minutes. Therefore they spend far less money on sales and can acquire customers for far less.\n* **More money for R&amp;D.** Since bottom-up companies don't need to employ a large sales force, they can spend more of their revenue on research and development. They can either focus on improving their current product offering or building brand new products.  \n   * This creates a really powerful flywheel effect. Less money spent on sales = more money for R&amp;D = a better and faster improving product = more customers = less money spent on sales....\n* **More chances to be adopted.** Top-down companies only really get one or two chances to sell to a customer. If the CEO doesn't like your sales pitch, there's not much you can do. Bottom-up companies have hundreds of chances to be adopted since they can be adopted by individual employees or small teams.\n* **You can sell down-market.** Many of the best SaaS (software as a service) products are used by both startups and large companies due to their bottom-up strategy. This allows them to access a larger total addressable market, generate revenue early, get quicker feedback and to also grow revenue naturally as their customers grow in size. Top-down companies typically don't sell down-market due to the high sales costs involved for them.\n\n## What to look for in a bottom-up company\n\nNot all bottom-up companies are created equal. Here are some important things to look out for when evaluating investment opportunities.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Look for a \"receptive\" market.** The bottom-up strategy is not a one-size-fits-all approach. The approach just doesn't make sense for some products and markets. E.G. Payroll software needs to be adopted company-wide for it to be effective. Whereas project management software can be easily adopted by individuals or small teams. This is a receptive market.\n* **World-class design.** Bottom-up companies can only be successful if their products can be easily adopted and used by individual users. To provide value quickly, these products need to be intuitive, simple and a joy to use. Look for products that fit this description. If you are unsure on how to evaluate design quality, go to websites such as G2 and read customer reviews.\n* **Growing average revenue per customer.** Bottom-up products are easily adopted by individual employees. However, the real test of a bottoms-up product is whether or not it spreads within each customer and starts to generate more and more revenue. Look for companies where this is happening. If a bottom-up company is only growing through new customer acquisition then this is a bad sign. Their product is not being widely adopted at each customer.\n* **High sales efficiency ratio.** In the same vein as the advantage of having a low CAC, high quality bottom-up companies should have high sales efficiency ratios as they need to employee fewer salespeople than top-down companies.\n* **Moving up-market.** While the ability to sell down-market is a big advantage, you should be wary of companies that only sell down-market. Look for companies that sell to both Fortune 500 companies and startups.\n\n## Bottom-Up Companies\n\nBelow are some bottom-up companies that are, in my opinion, great investment opportunities. (Please note, that this is not investment advice and just the companies that I'm excited about for my personal portfolio).\n\n### Asana ($ASAN):\n\nAsana is a project management software company that IPO'd in late September. It is the archetypical bottom-up company; individual users/teams adopt Asana to run their own projects before it is eventually adopted company-wide as the go-to project management tool.\n\nI like Asana for a couple of reasons:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. **Asana's sales efficiency is 1.15.** This is a very healthy number for a newly public company and shows that their bottom-up strategy is working very well.\n2. **R&amp;D spend is 64% of revenue.** While this may seem incredibly high to some and could be a negative sign at a more mature company, as explained above bottom-up companies live and die on the quality of their product. A high % spend on R&amp;D shows that Asana's management clearly understand where their money can create the most long-term shareholder value.\n3. **Product &amp; design quality.** This is an entirely personal opinion but I've used Asana extensively and it's the best-designed project management tool I've ever used.\n4. **YoY revenue growth of 85%.** Even though Asana is a relatively young company, revenue growth of 85% is incredibly impressive.\n\n### Slack ($WORK) :\n\nSlack is a business chat/communications tool for companies. Colleagues can send DMs to each other, create channels (chat rooms), private groups and more. It is becoming the de-facto internal communication channel for many of the world's fastest growing companies.\n\nI like Slack for a couple of reasons:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. **Product stickiness.** Once Slack is adopted company-wide it is incredibly hard to replace. The deep customisation allowed (different channels, private groups etc) and the amount of stored knowledge in the system means that many companies would almost grind to a halt if they could not use it. They would not be able to effectively communicate. This is in contrast to a tool like Zoom, which could be fairly easily replaced if better video conferencing software was available.\n2. **Average user activity is 90 minutes per day.** The average slack user spends 90 minutes every day on the platform. This is an incredible example of the value that slack is providing to it's users and is indicative of a bottom-up product that is getting adopted company-wide.\n3. **65 of the Fortune 100 use Slack.** As mentioned above, a critical measure of a bottom-up company is whether or not they can move up-market. Slack is being used by some of the world's fastest growing public companies. It is also used by Amazon, which at the time of writing is the 3rd largest company (by market cap) in the world.\n\n### Honourable Mentions:\n\nBelow are some more bottom-up companies that are definitely worth investigating.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. Zoom ($ZM)\n2. Atlassian ($TEAM)\n3. Datadog ($DDOG)\n4. Zendesk ($ZEN)\n5. Hubspot ($HUBS)\n6. Docusign ($DOCU)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWould you be interested in reading more posts like this?

        "selftext": "Only seen a couple posts about APXT. Seems like many are overlooking the opportunity here. Get in while it\u2019s still early. Volume is already heating up.\n\nAPXT will be merging via SPAC with Microsoft partnered company AvePoint in Q1 2021. Merger valued at $2 billion and will trade under AVPT.\n\n**AvePoint:**\n\n* AvePoint offers data management solutions for Microsoft Cloud users.\n* Is 5 time Microsoft partner of the year.\n* Currently estimated 7 million users only make up roughly 3% of total Microsoft Office 365 users, meaning there is a lot of room to grow. AvePoint believes they may even be able to hit the 10% share. Potentially 50 million future AvePoint customers.\n* Microsoft Office makes up 41% of the global market share for office applications. Big growth opportunity for AvePoint.\n* Estimated addressable market of $33 billion by 2022.\n* 2020 projected growth of 25% from previous year.\n* 25% of Fortune 500 companies use AvePoint for data management/solutions.\n\n**APXT:**\n\n* Unlike many SPACs, APXT checks out financially. They already have revenue.\n* Estimated revenue of $150 million by end of 2020. Much of this is recurring income.\n* Management made up of many key figures with access to resources and great track records.\n* Jeff Epstein is CEO, former CFO of Oracle Corporation.\n* Brad Koenig is former Head of Technology Investment at Goldman Sachs.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* After hours on 11/25 was up 20% since market close. Expect this shit to open high on Friday.\n* Many who\u2019ve gotten in are already up 20+%.\n* As of now there is no option trading available. Warrant trading is.\n\n**TLDR:**\n\n* APXT will be merging with AvePoint via SPAC in Q1 2021.\n* Their CEO is the former CFO of Oracle and his name is Jeffrey Epstein.

        "selftext": "So this is my first post on the subreddit but I have been a member for a few months now. I sort of stay on the side and read everyone else's posts and try to get some ideas. I actually just started investing back in September, and I have been slowly learning the ins and outs of investing. I see a lot of posts about stocks and their values and a lot of useful information but one topic I don't see come up often is dividends (maybe there are tons of posts and I am just missing them all). I see people get excited about jumps in prices but not dividend payout dates. Before I ask my question I want to just give a short story of this guy I know. I call him the \"Dividend guy\", mostly to protect his identity.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo about a year ago, I started thinking of my future at 21 years old, and I met this guy at work who is about 5 years older than me. I saw him one day looking at stocks on his computer and I sparked up a conversation with him telling him how I am trying to get into investing for my future. He gave me some tips and it seemed to be a common interest we shared so every time we saw each other we brought it up.  This guy has been investing since he was 18, and he was telling me about some of the stocks he owns. However, one thing I noticed was that after every stock name he told me he also told me the dividend yield % which was impressive he knew them offhand. Fast forward to yesterday and we sat down at the lunch table and he wanted to show me something, he gave a huge talk about why he loved dividends and then showed me a picture of his portfolio. More specifically it was the last 3 stocks that paid him dividends and I was kind of shocked.  One was a payout of around $300 CAD dollars for AT&amp;T dividends, another was around $250 CAD for oracle dividend payouts, finally around $75 dollars CAD for apple dividends, total that up, and within a few days, he made $650 dollars. Also, that's apparently quarterly payments so he gets around $650 dollars every 3 months or so (if that's how it works). I was impressed but then he told me his and plan and this plan is what got me to write this post. He told me he puts all the money he makes from dividends back into purchasing more stocks for now (I know people do this and I do the same). However, he told me his goal is to earn enough money from quarterly dividends and retire by the time he is in his 40's eventually he wants to have enough money coming from dividends to retire and just live his life off of dividend payments. He told me he would need somewhere between $15,000 to $20,000 CAD coming in quarterly for him to meet his goal.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, this got me thinking, I thought this was a cool idea, however, I wanted some opinions from people who know more than me. Is this guy's thinking normal or not normal? I have never heard of someone banking this much off of dividend payments. I mean I just got my first dividend payments from Apple and I made around 6 dollars CAD from 24 shares. I can see taking the hundreds of dollars you can make from dividends and putting back into your portfolio but not living off of them.  But I am worried I am too new to investing to be questioning anybody's methods. So I would love to get some opinions and see if maybe this is a strategy I should look into for the longterm.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you!",

        "selftext": "It was recently just in the news about the US filing a 15 day extension for ORCL, WAL, and other investors to buy it. ORCL has the obvious mastery in the nuts and bolts of Tik Tok, which is data management and cloud work. Read this excerpt.\n\n*  In Tuesday\u2019s court filing, ByteDance said it submitted a fourth proposal last Friday that contemplated addressing U.S. concerns \u201cby creating a new entity, wholly owned by Oracle, Walmart and existing U.S. investors in ByteDance, that would be responsible for handling TikTok\u2019s U.S. user data and content moderation.\u201d \n\nSince the new entity would mean that the US gets to own the user data (remember that the whole point of the trade war is that China was quote on quote stealing US data, lol). This would increase Oracle's value immensely, as it is a business deal closely related to working with the governments (smells kind of political) and to be able to wield TikTok in the American market would be comparable to the new snapchat or instagram or vine. It seems like a really great app (100 million users), and once hands transfer over to an American company (fingers crossed?) the tech market would probably be disrupted to some degree as well, as it's comparable to Facebook buying Instagram, which many people are pissed at for mishandling American's data....\n\nOh, plus the Don gave it, \"his blessing.\"\n\nI don't do calls or anything, but I might put a good chunk of change into it soon.\n\nTo be updated.",

This is absolute bogus and will not happen. It is and will be [C3.ai](https://C3.ai)\n\nAs other posts have pointed out, [c3.ai](https://c3.ai) has already filed with the SEC, which goes far beyond Stripe's \"rumors\" that they \"could\" IPO. Your wife is \"rumored\" to be sleeping with your coworker but you don't believe those guys right, they're just fucking with you.\n\nLet us look at the requirements for PSTH's Investment (spoiler, C3 meets all of them):\n\n\\- Large Market Cap\n\nCompany is currently valued at 3.3 billion dollars, that is quite large.\n\n\\- Significant Barriers to Entry\n\n\"a strategic partnership **with Microsoft** to bring enterprise AI technology to the energy industry via **Azure\u2019s cloud computing platform**. [C3.ai](https://C3.ai) also has **Bank of America, Koch Industries, AstraZeneca,** the **U.S. Air Force, Army Aviation and the military\u2019s U.S. Strategic Command** as customers\" - [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/16/c3ai-files-s-1-for-ipo-to-list-on-nyse-under-ticker-symbol-ai.html)\n\nPartnerships like these are exclusive, which makes them crucial barriers to entry for other data analytics companies. They are also pursuing AI grant initiatives with Top 10 Universities\n\n\\- Strong Balance Sheet\n\nI know nothing about balance sheets but it says they're operating at a loss currently but so is PLTR, a competitor of theirs.\n\n\"[C3.ai](https://C3.ai) had $156.7 million in revenue in the fiscal year leading up to April 2020 and a net loss of $69.4 million the same period.

This guy knows how to do data and has a reputation for it. \n\n\\- Simple, Predictable, Free Cash Flow Generative Business\n\nThe demand for data and analytics is only growing from here as more businesses revolutionize\n\n\\- Limited exposure to extrinsic factors that we cannot control\n\nNo matter what, we will need data and AI, recession or not, pandemic or not, and so forth.\n\nthis ties in with next point\n\n\\-  Minimal capital markets dependency\n\nstonks go up, we need data. they go down, we need data\n\nIf NONE of this convinces you, then I present the result of unleashing the highest concentration of my Asperger's Syndrome within this thesis below: \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mnudruqi7a261.png?width=1127&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f20cf5475cd160e6f3ccc71fe6fbf28fa541ebf0",

        "selftext": "Hi,\n\nI work as a product manager at a large tech company and as part of my job it's important for me to understand major technology trends. I put this post together to outline a major technology trend (bottoms-up sales) and to analyse some potential investment opportunities to go along with this trend.\n\nPlease let me know if you found this post valuable. I'm considering starting a tech/investing newsletter where I analyse tech trends and look at associated investment opportunities. Would love to know if that's something people would be interested in.\n\n## Bottom-Up Software Sales\n\nThe \"bottom up\" go-to-market strategy is the main sales strategy used by some of the world's fastest growing enterprise software companies, from Atlassian to Zoom.\n\nThe premise behind the bottom-up strategy is simple. Instead of taking a top-down approach, where software is sold directly to company leaders (CEO, CTO etc), bottom-up software can be adopted by individuals or small teams at a company before expanding to being used company-wide.\n\nFor example, Zoom is often initially adopted by individual salespeople to run a remote sales call before being eventually adopted company-wide to run all company meetings.\n\nThere are huge opportunities for public investors who can understand and identify companies that are successfully using the bottom-up strategy. In this post, I'll explain the benefits of a bottom-up strategy and list some exciting public companies using this strategy to their advantage.\n\n## What's so special about bottom-up?\n\nThere are a number of distinct advantages to the bottom-up strategy that makes for incredible businesses and investments.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Lower cost of customer acquisition (CAC).** Traditional top-down software companies such as Oracle and SAP spend a massive amount of money on sales. They need to since they are selling to C-level executives and their products typically cost millions to implement. Bottom-up businesses don't have this problem. Users can sign up to their products directly from the website in minutes. Therefore they spend far less money on sales and can acquire customers for far less.\n* **More money for R&amp;D.** Since bottom-up companies don't need to employ a large sales force, they can spend more of their revenue on research and development. They can either focus on improving their current product offering or building brand new products.  \n   * This creates a really powerful flywheel effect. Less money spent on sales = more money for R&amp;D = a better and faster improving product = more customers = less money spent on sales....\n* **More chances to be adopted.** Top-down companies only really get one or two chances to sell to a customer. If the CEO doesn't like your sales pitch, there's not much you can do. Bottom-up companies have hundreds of chances to be adopted since they can be adopted by individual employees or small teams.\n* **You can sell down-market.** Many of the best SaaS (software as a service) products are used by both startups and large companies due to their bottom-up strategy. This allows them to access a larger total addressable market, generate revenue early, get quicker feedback and to also grow revenue naturally as their customers grow in size. Top-down companies typically don't sell down-market due to the high sales costs involved for them.\n\n## What to look for in a bottom-up company\n\nNot all bottom-up companies are created equal. Here are some important things to look out for when evaluating investment opportunities.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Look for a \"receptive\" market.** The bottom-up strategy is not a one-size-fits-all approach. The approach just doesn't make sense for some products and markets. E.G. Payroll software needs to be adopted company-wide for it to be effective. Whereas project management software can be easily adopted by individuals or small teams. This is a receptive market.\n* **World-class design.** Bottom-up companies can only be successful if their products can be easily adopted and used by individual users. To provide value quickly, these products need to be intuitive, simple and a joy to use. Look for products that fit this description. If you are unsure on how to evaluate design quality, go to websites such as G2 and read customer reviews.\n* **Growing average revenue per customer.** Bottom-up products are easily adopted by individual employees. However, the real test of a bottoms-up product is whether or not it spreads within each customer and starts to generate more and more revenue. Look for companies where this is happening. If a bottom-up company is only growing through new customer acquisition then this is a bad sign. Their product is not being widely adopted at each customer.\n* **High sales efficiency ratio.** In the same vein as the advantage of having a low CAC, high quality bottom-up companies should have high sales efficiency ratios as they need to employee fewer salespeople than top-down companies.\n* **Moving up-market.** While the ability to sell down-market is a big advantage, you should be wary of companies that only sell down-market. Look for companies that sell to both Fortune 500 companies and startups.\n\n## Bottom-Up Companies\n\nBelow are some bottom-up companies that are, in my opinion, great investment opportunities. (Please note, that this is not investment advice and just the companies that I'm excited about for my personal portfolio).\n\n### Asana ($ASAN):\n\nAsana is a project management software company that IPO'd in late September. It is the archetypical bottom-up company; individual users/teams adopt Asana to run their own projects before it is eventually adopted company-wide as the go-to project management tool.\n\nI like Asana for a couple of reasons:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. **Asana's sales efficiency is 1.15.** This is a very healthy number for a newly public company and shows that their bottom-up strategy is working very well.\n2. **R&amp;D spend is 64% of revenue.** While this may seem incredibly high to some and could be a negative sign at a more mature company, as explained above bottom-up companies live and die on the quality of their product. A high % spend on R&amp;D shows that Asana's management clearly understand where their money can create the most long-term shareholder value.\n3. **Product &amp; design quality.** This is an entirely personal opinion but I've used Asana extensively and it's the best-designed project management tool I've ever used.\n4. **YoY revenue growth of 85%.** Even though Asana is a relatively young company, revenue growth of 85% is incredibly impressive.\n\n### Slack ($WORK) :\n\nSlack is a business chat/communications tool for companies. Colleagues can send DMs to each other, create channels (chat rooms), private groups and more. It is becoming the de-facto internal communication channel for many of the world's fastest growing companies.\n\nI like Slack for a couple of reasons:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. **Product stickiness.** Once Slack is adopted company-wide it is incredibly hard to replace. The deep customisation allowed (different channels, private groups etc) and the amount of stored knowledge in the system means that many companies would almost grind to a halt if they could not use it. They would not be able to effectively communicate. This is in contrast to a tool like Zoom, which could be fairly easily replaced if better video conferencing software was available.\n2. **Average user activity is 90 minutes per day.** The average slack user spends 90 minutes every day on the platform. This is an incredible example of the value that slack is providing to it's users and is indicative of a bottom-up product that is getting adopted company-wide.\n3. **65 of the Fortune 100 use Slack.** As mentioned above, a critical measure of a bottom-up company is whether or not they can move up-market. Slack is being used by some of the world's fastest growing public companies. It is also used by Amazon, which at the time of writing is the 3rd largest company (by market cap) in the world.\n\n### Honourable Mentions:\n\nBelow are some more bottom-up companies that are definitely worth investigating.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. Zoom ($ZM)\n2. Atlassian ($TEAM)\n3. Datadog ($DDOG)\n4. Zendesk ($ZEN)\n5. Hubspot ($HUBS)\n6. Docusign ($DOCU)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWould you be interested in reading more posts like this?

        "selftext": "APXT has reached a deal to merge with AvePoint, the largest Microsoft 365 Data Management Solutions Provider. The company is being valued at $2 billion and will trade under AVPT.\n\nAPXT has a huge client base already, at an estimated 7 million members. 25% of the Fortune 500 uses Avepoint.\n\n'AvePoint\u2019s 7 million customers represent a 3% share of Microsoft\u2019s 250 million 365 users. AvePoint believes it can get to 10% share and Microsoft will hit 500 million users in the future, good for 50 million AvePoint future customers.'\n\nAddressable market: $33 billion by 2022. \n\nThe company ALREADY HAS REVENUE (unlike other SPACs), which is expected to total $148 million by the end of this year. A large % of this is recurring revenue as well, with 78% of revenues in 2020 estimated to be recurring. Expected revenue CAGR of 30% to 2022. \n\n**5-time winner of Microsoft Partner of the Year award.**\n\nManagement: 'Apex is led by former Oracle CFO Jeff Epstein and former Goldman Sachs Head of Technology Investment Banking Brad Koenig'. These are huge, knowledgeable players. They can turn this company into a goliath, especially with the extra capital from a SPAC. \n\nBig name backers: Sixth Street Partners, Goldman Sachs, \n\nBig advisors on the deal, including Goldman Sachs, Evercore and Citigroup.\n\nThis seems similar to the other data related plays we've had this year \\*cough\\* PLTR \\*cough\\*. Not the same type, but definitely in a growth market with strong margins. Also allows you to diversify away from EVs a bit.\n\nThe SPAC hasn't run yet, currently trading at $10.75 per share, so this has a lot of room to run.

        "selftext": "The Palantir Bump: Politics or Product?\nPalantir, the data-analytics firm co-founded by Peter Thiel, went public in early October at a $21 billion valuation. The company\u2019s shares, initially priced at $10, dipped on the day of its direct listing and were flat in the weeks thereafter. Analysts doubted that Palantir could grow quickly enough to paper over the hundred of millions in losses incurred in recent years.\n\nThe stock has nearly tripled since then \u2014 up 20 percent today alone.\n\nWhat explains the $50 billion valuation for a company that reported more than $1 billion in losses this year? Some are chalking it up to the election of Joe Biden, whose personnel decisions suggest a return to a more muscular U.S. defense policy. The material effect of policy decisions on Palantir\u2019s bottom line is hard to quantify. On the margin, a more active foreign policy expands Palantir\u2019s potential revenue from government contracts, but not nearly enough to account for the $30 billion that has been added to the company\u2019s market cap in the past month. Palantir\u2019s market cap dwarfs those of competitors in government IT, such as Booz Allen Hamilton and Leidos; even if investors expect it to become the dominant contractor, that alone cannot justify the $50 billion valuation.\n\nNot to mention that Palantir is disrupting the national-security establishment by competing with defense contractors that have entrenched relationships in Washington. We\u2019re talking about a company that sued the U.S. Army in 2016 and won \u2014 not exactly a friend of the defense establishment. A return to the pre-Trump status quo should benefit defense majors such as Boeing and Lockheed Martin, not a young software firm. There\u2019s also the inconvenient fact that the company\u2019s co-founders both supported Donald Trump, and Thiel has been a vocal critic of foreign intervention.\n\nAs always, the real story of Palantir\u2019s surge is less intriguing than the media narrative: It\u2019s a very promising business.\n\nPalantir reported higher-than-expected revenues in the fourth quarter, driven by a large contract with the U.S. Army and 15 sizeable deals struck with commercial customers. Revenue from new customers grew 177 percent from last year, diversifying Palantir\u2019s customer base, which previously depended on a handful of big-ticket clients.\n\nFor a company like Palantir, the addition of a new customer returns a high multiple to the actual revenue generated by that customer because (1) new deals prove new use cases and (2) Palantir\u2019s operating-system business model generates high returns to scale.\n\nThe foundation of Palantir\u2019s commercial business model is its \u201cFoundry\u201d operating system, a central repository where customers can access, manage, and analyze their data. A large portion of the company\u2019s recent growth resulted from the \u201cmodularization\u201d of Foundry; i.e., Palantir began to sell bits and pieces of the platform rather than requiring customers to integrate it entirely. That\u2019s crucial because the dominance of legacy data systems such as Oracle and SQL led investors to question whether Foundry would find a receptive market. Each new Foundry customer provides further evidence that there is a real market for new data-management tools.\n\nAnd new commercial contracts improve the underlying product: As more businesses adopt the Foundry OS, more apps will be built on top of it, and the cost of switching to a different software provider will be higher. As the Foundry user base grows, so does Palantir\u2019s ability to improve the operating system and identify additional use cases for it. Investors in the company are betting that Foundry will be adopted by a sufficiently large number of businesses to become a standard system for data analytics.\n\nAs usual with high-growth tech firms, this is a risky proposition: If Palantir achieves massive commercial adoption, it can take market share from standard data platforms and build high-margin products on top of its operating system. That can generate more growth in the form of consulting projects, new products, etc. If the company doesn\u2019t take enough commercial market share, it will still be a niche, high-value IT firm, but it will not trade at 30 times revenue.\n\nBottom line: It\u2019s not politics, it\u2019s the product.\n\n[Source](https://www.nationalreview.com/2020/11/palantirs-eye-popping-rally/)",

        "selftext": "In early September, a handful of TikTok stars, most of them in their early 20s, gathered on a Zoom call to tackle a weighty question: Should they take on the U.S. government?\n\nAfter more discussions,  Doug Marland , a 23-year-old comedian from  New Jersey , raised his hand to join a lawsuit objecting to the Trump administration's order to ban the app. Two others -- musician  Alec Chambers  and fashion designer Cosette Rinab -- also volunteered.\n\nThe three have a combined 7.4 million followers on TikTok and make their livings off the app. The suit argued that a ban would mean losing their income and limiting their ability to express themselves.\n\nThe lawsuit got little attention when it was filed in a  Pennsylvania  court. The TikTok stars ultimately prevailed -- and the case has become central in creating a path for the app to maintain its foothold in the U.S., where it is now used by almost one in three Americans.\n\nIt looked like a grass-roots effort, but it was not. Behind the scenes, the legal action was orchestrated by TikTok and its Chinese parent company,  ByteDance Ltd. , according to people familiar with the matter. It lined up the influencers to be plaintiffs, connected them with a top First Amendment lawyer and helped create a legal strategy that was complementary to a separate lawsuit the company pursued under its own name, the people said.\n\nIt was an unexpected twist in a geopolitical business saga that began this summer, and continues with a preliminary deal still under negotiation that involves  Oracle Corp.  and  Walmart Inc.  taking stakes in TikTok.\n\nByteDance and its potential U.S. partners are optimistic about completing a deal in the coming weeks, according to people familiar with their discussions and internal thinking. On Wednesday, the Trump administration granted ByteDance a one-week extension to complete a deal, putting the new deadline at  Dec. 4 .\n\nIn August, President Trump signed an order calling for TikTok to be shut down or, alternatively, sold to a U.S. company. The administration said it feared ByteDance could share information about U.S. users with the Chinese government, which the company said it would never do.\n\nThe first ruling in TikTok's favor came with its own lawsuit, which argued that an initial  Commerce Department  ban on downloading or updating the app would harm the company's business. On  Sept. 27 , Judge  Carl Nichols  in the  U.S. District Court  in  Washington, D.C. , determined that the government likely overstepped its authority under national-security law. The government appealed the decision, and the case is still ongoing.\n\nOn  Oct. 30 , Judge  Wendy Beetlestone , in federal court for the  Eastern District  of  Pennsylvania , ruled on the influencer lawsuit. She blocked  Commerce Department  restrictions that would have barred U.S. companies from listing TikTok in their app stores -- a move that would effectively make it inoperable in the U.S.\n\n\"Without access to the TikTok app, Plaintiffs would lose access to all of these followers, as well as to the professional opportunities afforded by TikTok,\" Judge Beetlestone said in her decision.\n\nThe U.S. government has appealed the ruling. The government called the plaintiffs' claims meritless and argued their request to block the ban would \" necessarily infringe on the President's authority to block business-to-business economic transactions with a foreign entity in the midst of a declared national- security emergency.\"\n\nIn a statement, TikTok's interim head,  Vanessa Pappas  said: \"We stand behind our community as they share their voices, and we are committed to providing a home for them to do so.\"\n\n One  of ByteDance's goals in recent months was to draw out the Trump administration's assault, the people said, betting that key officials would likely become increasingly distracted as the election approached.\n\nThe TikTok review by the administration began with the U.S. Committee on Foreign Investment, which evaluates deals for national security risks. That committee has ordered ByteDance to divest its U.S. operations of TikTok, out of concern that user data could be shared with the Chinese government given regulations there that require companies to hand over huge swaths of information. ByteDance has said it would never share data with the Chinese government, though analysts and experts say companies generally have little choice but to comply if asked.\n\nByteDance's legal efforts were designed to chip away at the more punitive efforts by the Trump administration, even while it pursued a deal that would satisfy the Cfius order, which also has bipartisan support in  Washington . Any deal will ultimately require signoff from the U.S. president.\n\nAlthough President-elect Biden has not made clear his position on TikTok, the committee's divestiture order would still likely stand under new administration.\n\nFor now, an outright ban of TikTok appears off the table: On  Nov. 12 , the  Commerce Department  said it wouldn't enforce the order that would have effectively forced TikTok to shut down, citing the ruling in the stars' lawsuit, and the administration's legal options are dwindling.\n\n\"It's a big muddle because of these lawsuits,\" said a senior administration official.\n\nMs. Rinab, a 21-year-old senior at the  University of Southern California , said she started crying when she learned of the court victory. \"I was so, so happy,\" she said.\n\n\"This entire experience has been one I'll never forget,\" said Mr. Marland. \"It taught me a lot about the country, the way laws work, and court procedures.\"\n\nWhile TikTok was aggressively pushing back on the proposed bans in the courts, it also pledged to work cooperatively with national-security regulators on the potential deal that would address the U.S. government's data-security concerns.\n\nIn mid-September, the company announced it had chosen  Oracle  as its partner to secure its data in the U.S., with the software giant and  Walmart Inc.  taking ownership stakes in a new company that would run TikTok's U.S. operations.\n\nA key sticking point that still needs to be ironed out is the size of the ownership stakes for ByteDance and its new U.S. investors, according to people familiar with the discussions and internal thinking.\n\nThe negotiations have already helped  Walmart  forge closer ties to TikTok, something that has motivated the retailer from the beginning, according to people familiar with the situation.  Walmart  is working toward partnering with TikTok on providing warehouse and shipment support for sales made through the app, and  Walmart  CEO  Doug McMillon  now has relationships with TikTok's executive leadership, some of the people said.\n\nExecutives at  Oracle , who see TikTok as a major customer for its cloud business, expect the deal to be completed before the end of the year, a person close to the company said.\n\nByteDance kept its lawsuits against the U.S. government active in part to ensure that the app didn't face a shutdown as the negotiations took place.\n\nMr. Trump would still prefer to get rid of TikTok in the U.S. altogether, though his attention has shifted to other matters, the senior administration official said. The official said that even though Mr. Trump gave his preliminary approval to a deal, he has never been fully sold on the idea because he doesn't want a transaction that could be perceived as benefiting  China .\n\nInside the Trump administration, Treasury Secretary  Steven Mnuchin , Attorney General  William Barr  and  White House  economic adviser  Larry Kudlow  have all said in meetings at times that they believe a deal could work, while  White House  adviser and  China  hawk  Peter Navarro  has advised Mr. Trump to avoid a deal, according to the senior administration official.\n\nTikTok believes it will still likely need to divest its American operations or face persistent questions about its handling of U.S. data, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nA deal must ultimately get signoff from the U.S. Committee on Foreign Investment and Mr. Trump, as well as the Chinese government.\n\nThe lawsuit was designed in part to put a human face on TikTok. Mr. Chambers, the musician, joined the app in late 2018, and a cover version of Halsey's \"Without Me\" recorded in the basement studio at his parents' house earned him thousands of early followers.\n\nNow more than two million users follow his videos, many of which feature his own original music or his covers of radio hits. The 25-year-old from  Connecticut  has earned endorsement deals to promote Extra gum and Cinnamon Toast Crunch cereal.\n\n\"TikTok has allowed regular kids like me, who don't have access to a lot of money or connections to people who are high up in the industry, to make a stamp in the music business,\" he said. \"I felt like I needed to fight\" for TikTok.\n\nMr. Marland, the comedian, said he likewise amassed enough TikTok followers to quit his job waiting tables and drop out of school. He now supports himself with sponsorships from brands including Snickers and Reebok, and boasts three million followers.\n\nAs threats against the app grew through the summer, TikTok officials stayed in close touch with top performers on the app to reassure them that they had a plan to ensure survival and to dissuade them from switching to rival platforms, according to people familiar with the outreach. As part of those communications, the company stressed that the stars had rights of their own to defend, the people said.\n\nIn September, TikTok brought the high performers together to talk on a Zoom call about the U.S. government threats and what might be done about them. They answered questions about how TikTok had affected their lives, according to a person who attended the call. Eventually Mr. Chambers, Mr. Marland and Ms. Rinab volunteered to be plaintiffs in the lawsuit.",

        "selftext": "Hi,\n\nI work as a PM at a large tech company and as part of my job it's important for me to understand major technology trends. I put this post together to outline a major technology trend (bottoms-up sales) and to analyse some potential investment opportunities to go along with this trend.\n\n# Bottom-Up Software Sales\n\nThe \"bottom up\" go-to-market strategy is the main sales strategy used by some of the world's fastest growing enterprise software companies, from Atlassian to Zoom.\n\nThe premise behind the bottom-up strategy is simple. Instead of taking a top-down approach, where software is sold directly to company leaders (CEO, CTO etc), bottom-up software can be adopted by individuals or small teams at a company before expanding to being used company-wide.\n\nFor example, Zoom is often initially adopted by individual salespeople to run a remote sales call before being eventually adopted company-wide to run all company meetings.\n\nThere are huge opportunities for public investors who can understand and identify companies that are successfully using the bottom-up strategy. In this post, I'll explain the benefits of a bottom-up strategy and list some exciting public companies using this strategy to their advantage.\n\n# What's so special about bottom-up?\n\nThere are a number of distinct advantages to the bottom-up strategy that makes for incredible businesses and investments.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Lower cost of customer acquisition (CAC).** Traditional top-down software companies such as Oracle and SAP spend a massive amount of money on sales. They need to since they are selling to C-level executives and their products typically cost millions to implement. Bottom-up businesses don't have this problem. Users can sign up to their products directly from the website in minutes. Therefore they spend far less money on sales and can acquire customers for far less.\n* **More money for R&amp;D.** Since bottom-up companies don't need to employ a large sales force, they can spend more of their revenue on research and development. They can either focus on improving their current product offering or building brand new products.  \n   * This creates a really powerful flywheel effect. Less money spent on sales = more money for R&amp;D = a better and faster improving product = more customers = less money spent on sales....\n* **More chances to be adopted.** Top-down companies only really get one or two chances to sell to a customer. If the CEO doesn't like your sales pitch, there's not much you can do. Bottom-up companies have hundreds of chances to be adopted since they can be adopted by individual employees or small teams.\n* **You can sell down-market.** Many of the best SaaS (software as a service) products are used by both startups and large companies due to their bottom-up strategy. This allows them to access a larger total addressable market, generate revenue early, get quicker feedback and to also grow revenue naturally as their customers grow in size. Top-down companies typically don't sell down-market due to the high sales costs involved for them.\n\n## What to look for in a bottom-up company\n\nNot all bottom-up companies are created equal. Here are some important things to look out for when evaluating investment opportunities.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Look for a \"receptive\" market.** The bottom-up strategy is not a one-size-fits-all approach. The approach just doesn't make sense for some products and markets. E.G. Payroll software needs to be adopted company-wide for it to be effective. Whereas project management software can be easily adopted by individuals or small teams. This is a receptive market.\n* **World-class design.** Bottom-up companies can only be successful if their products can be easily adopted and used by individual users. To provide value quickly, these products need to be intuitive, simple and a joy to use. Look for products that fit this description. If you are unsure on how to evaluate design quality, go to websites such as G2 and read customer reviews.\n* **Growing average revenue per customer.** Bottom-up products are easily adopted by individual employees. However, the real test of a bottoms-up product is whether or not it spreads within each customer and starts to generate more and more revenue. Look for companies where this is happening. If a bottom-up company is only growing through new customer acquisition then this is a bad sign. Their product is not being widely adopted at each customer.\n* **High sales efficiency ratio.** In the same vein as the advantage of having a low CAC, high quality bottom-up companies should have high sales efficiency ratios as they need to employee fewer salespeople than top-down companies.\n* **Moving up-market.** While the ability to sell down-market is a big advantage, you should be wary of companies that only sell down-market. Look for companies that sell to both Fortune 500 companies and startups.\n\n## Bottom-Up Companies\n\nBelow are some bottom-up companies that are, in my opinion, great investment opportunities. (Please note, that this is not investment advice and just the companies that I'm excited about for my personal portfolio). Please note, I currently personally hold a position in Slack, but not Asana (yet).\n\n### Asana ($ASAN):\n\nAsana is a project management software company that IPO'd in late September. It is the archetypical bottom-up company; individual users/teams adopt Asana to run their own projects before it is eventually adopted company-wide as the go-to project management tool.\n\nI like Asana for a couple of reasons:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. **Asana's sales efficiency is 1.15.** This is a very healthy number for a newly public company and shows that their bottom-up strategy is working very well.\n2. **R&amp;D spend is 64% of revenue.** While this may seem incredibly high to some and could be a negative sign at a more mature company, as explained above bottom-up companies live and die on the quality of their product. A high % spend on R&amp;D shows that Asana's management clearly understand where their money can create the most long-term shareholder value.\n3. **Product &amp; design quality.** This is an entirely personal opinion but I've used Asana extensively and it's the best-designed project management tool I've ever used.\n4. **YoY revenue growth of 85%.** Even though Asana is a relatively young company, revenue growth of 85% is incredibly impressive.\n\n### Slack ($WORK) :\n\nSlack is a business chat/communications tool for companies. Colleagues can send DMs to each other, create channels (chat rooms), private groups and more. It is becoming the de-facto internal communication channel for many of the world's fastest growing companies.\n\nI like Slack for a couple of reasons:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. **Product stickiness.** Once Slack is adopted company-wide it is incredibly hard to replace. The deep customisation allowed (different channels, private groups etc) and the amount of stored knowledge in the system means that many companies would almost grind to a halt if they could not use it. They would not be able to effectively communicate. This is in contrast to a tool like Zoom, which could be fairly easily replaced if better video conferencing software was available.\n2. **Average user activity is 90 minutes per day.** The average slack user spends 90 minutes every day on the platform. This is an incredible example of the value that slack is providing to it's users and is indicative of a bottom-up product that is getting adopted company-wide.\n3. **65 of the Fortune 100 use Slack.** As mentioned above, a critical measure of a bottom-up company is whether or not they can move up-market. Slack is being used by some of the world's fastest growing public companies. It is also used by Amazon, which at the time of writing is the 3rd largest company (by market cap) in the world.\n\n### Honourable Mentions:\n\nBelow are some more bottom-up companies that are definitely worth investigating.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. Zoom ($ZM)\n2. Atlassian ($TEAM)\n3. Datadog ($DDOG)\n4. Zendesk ($ZEN)\n5. Hubspot ($HUBS)\n6. Docusign ($DOCU)\n\nPlease let me know if you've found this post valuable.

        "selftext": "I am going to share DD on some of my higher conviction ideas. I hope they will be helpful and I welcome feedback. First up is $BILL\n\n**Background:** Businesses spend stupid amounts of time dealing with AR/AP (accounts receivable/payable). It is one of the last areas of the back office that haven\u2019t been improved by technology (e.g., quickbooks, turbotax etc). Sending, receiving, paying, and tracking invoices and payments is a MASSIVE market that is ripe for a technological solution. ENTER [BILL.COM](http://bill.com/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/enwnlynw9e261.png?width=956&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=49ff34b4e98784f827111ae6c2017c4bd7697a9a\n\n**WHAT THE FUCK IS BILL:** BILL is a cloud based AR/AP platform that manages invoices, allows staff to approve and pay bills and then downloads that information into accounting systems. It is a huge time save and simplifies an annoying af part of running a business. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mr57d8sx9e261.png?width=948&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ba18e5f18ba875e361e17f347ae46731ef358d2a\n\nBILL\u2019s platform is huge and already has 2.5m network members. That means when you go to pay a business, you can just type a name, and it's pretty likely the business you are trying to pay is already on the platform. This creates a huge advantage and creates massive barriers to new entrants (nobody wants to sign up to multiple platforms). Think of it like Venmo but for businesses \n\nThe biggest banks in the country already know they have to work with BILL and provide this service to their business customers (BOA, Wells, JPM). The product is also plugged into all the accounting platforms (Oracle, Quickbooks, Sage etc)\n\nThey are now focused on bringing this product to international companies. If they are successful they will basically be THE global business-to-business payments platform. You could make a solid case that someone like Visa or Mastercard, maybe even Stripe or PayPal would love to own this shit. \n\nThey already have $169m of revenue and are growing at like 50% YoY. The business is profitable with 77% gross margins but the most important part is that this is a HUGE global opportunity - about $30b which they could conceivably become the only player in.\n\nThey are marketing with investors over the next few weeks. Today they will be at the Credit Suisse Technology conference and tomorrow at the Wells Fargo TMT Summit\n\n**KEY TAKEAWAYS**\n\n\\- LIKE VENMO OR CASH APP BUT FOR BUSINESS\n\n\\- NETWORK EFFECT CREATES AN INSURMOUNTABLE MOAT\n\n\\- AS THEY EXPAND THE NETWORK GETS LARGER MAKING THE PRODUCT EXPONENTIALLY MORE VALUABLE. IT FEEDS ON ITS SELF\n\n\\- 59% YOY REVENUE GROWTH\n\n\\- 77% GROSS MARGINS\n\n\\- HUGE GLOBAL OPPORTUNITY ($30B)\n\n\\- TOP HOLDERS INCLUDE LEGIT AF HEDGE FUNDS LIKE LONE PINE AND WHALE ROCK\n\nBILL is rapidly becoming the dominant player in AR/AP and has the potential to become the Quickbooks of its segment. \n\n**How to play:**\n\nBuy stock \n\nSell puts \n\nBuy calls, something in 2021 ITM\n\n**Not investment advice just my opinion. Do your own research.** \n\nI own December 2021 $110 calls and common stock\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x6mvu478ce261.png?width=1087&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8463f4fd33a2be2bc95f1ebf8caefb48faeda565",

Even Robinhood thinks Biden is good for them how could they go down. I'm watching from the sidelines but here's some loss porn for you.  It's aged like fine wine, sorry, it took awhile for my wife's boyfriend to explain the mistakes I made in a way I could comprehend.\n\nI got greedy and put 85% of my account into one positions, then held +75% DNKN spreads grasping for more tendies before the buyout news came through, but was struck down by Inspire's billions of $'s. \n\nNow that I have $3.36 to invest, I figured I would buy Sundial. I can't afford Aurora Puts or Canopy Calls, and Slang doesn't trade on RH. If everything goes my way I will have enough money for a preroll in 2024 when it is hopefully legalized in Texas. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd yes it was $100, but longterm even more \\~ $ 7k across everything, \n\nFerrari tires are \\~1.75 each so the math from the TLDR checks out. See below for the rest:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI started swing trading Aston Martin on TD  for $0.05-0.10  in the June when it was playing with $1 (it's down to $0.80 today) \n\nI thought \" wow this is easy\" until they hit me with the fees a month down the road. \n\nSo I got a Robinhood, too and once I lost most of my money, a WeBull. That comes later. \n\nI started making money swing/daytrading shares, and then \"taught myself\" options.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Best Trades:**\n\n\\+1460%\n\n\\+555%\n\nConsistent Aston Martin $$$\n\nCanna swing trading\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Biggest Guhs:**\n\n* \\+$700 overnight on $ Spy Puts when it went to 297 in June                                                                         (didn't even have to burn a day trade) held to SPY300 and up and up until expiry $0.... GUH\n* Panic Selling GME calls, they were profitable within 2 days and I had months,                                       \nbought and sold puts and blew the remainder of the account... GUH\n* Did not Buy NKLA as VTIQ, thinking it was a scam and worthless compared to Tesla                               \nWhile this is true everywhere except the NKLA subreddit, it went to $90 and I missed it... GUH\n\nI won't have much to say until I get off unemployment, I guess I could paper trade but that seems way less fun than the past few months. Here's some nostalgia:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**My Favorite WSB Moments**\n\nBeing too poor for Teslamania but getting to watch from outside\n\nJerome memes\n\nTanker Gang's spirit\n\nPRPL Lambo\n\nGME Yolo $3 mil ( good luck brother)\n\nNKLA defenders thinking they're right\n\nCocky Bears spamming the sub and losing money on NKLA puts when I had calls\n\nHolding $1500 options overnight on a $4500 account and thinking I had a relatively low risk tolerance\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**My least Favorite WSB Moments**\n\nKang Gang wiping out everyone\n\nTanker Gang's Tendies\n\nSelling NIO at $6 \n\nNot Buying NIO 50C at $30\n\nPeople losing money on PRPL and blaming PRPL Lambo guy for it\n\nMissing Kodak\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyways seems like enough for now. I guess I can get up from my chair at the Wendy's I am currently sitting in and turn in my application. I just feel like I'm not worth the job so I might just head to the dumpster instead.\n\nIf a Market Maker scanner sees this, forward the following to Jamie Dimon:\n\n\"Dear Jamie, Please Venmo me $10,000 I promise to let it get spoofed out of me by your metals desk trading GLD options and NAK. Hope the family is well, Happy Holidays.\" ###\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI will end with a prayer.\n\nDear Jerome, \n\nI am sorry for my sins. If I am given another chance at tendies I will approach them as a grateful bull. Buying stocks is better than selling them, that's why we have covered calls, overnight pullbacks for entries, overnight gaps for gains, and our patron saint: margin. Obviously stocks should go up, we have the technology to make them go whenever we want, I don't know why I didn't listen to the blatantly obvious signs of a Bull Market or the wise words of the oracle himself .\n\n\"Buy the Dip Faggot\"",

        "selftext": "APXT has reached a deal to merge with AvePoint, the largest Microsoft 365 Data Management Solutions Provider. The company is being valued at $2 billion and will trade under AVPT.\n\nAPXT has a huge client base already, at an estimated 7 million members. 25% of the Fortune 500 uses Avepoint.\n\n'AvePoint\u2019s 7 million customers represent a 3% share of Microsoft\u2019s 250 million 365 users. AvePoint believes it can get to 10% share and Microsoft will hit 500 million users in the future, good for 50 million AvePoint future customers.'\n\nAddressable market: $33 billion by 2022. \n\nThe company ALREADY HAS REVENUE (unlike other SPACs), which is expected to total $148 million by the end of this year. A large % of this is recurring revenue as well, with 78% of revenues in 2020 estimated to be recurring. Expected revenue CAGR of 30% to 2022. \n\n**5-time winner of Microsoft Partner of the Year award.**\n\nManagement: 'Apex is led by former Oracle CFO Jeff Epstein and former Goldman Sachs Head of Technology Investment Banking Brad Koenig'. These are huge, knowledgeable players. They can turn this company into a goliath, especially with the extra capital from a SPAC. \n\nBig name backers: Sixth Street Partners, Goldman Sachs, \n\nBig advisors on the deal, including Goldman Sachs, Evercore and Citigroup.\n\nThis seems similar to the other data related plays we've had this year \\*cough\\* PLTR \\*cough\\*. Not the same type, but definitely in a growth market with strong margins. Also allows you to diversify away from EVs a bit.\n\nThe SPAC hasn't run yet, currently trading at $10.75 per share, so this has a lot of room to run. Very little downside, but huge potential upside. \n\nSources:\n\n[https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201123005590/en/AvePoint-the-Largest-Microsoft-365-Data-Management-Solutions-Provider-Announces-2bn-Merger](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201123005590/en/AvePoint-the-Largest-Microsoft-365-Data-Management-Solutions-Provider-Announces-2bn-Merger)\n\n[https://www.avepoint.com/](https://www.avepoint.com/)\n\n[https://www.marketwatch.com/story/microsoft-cloud-partner-avepoint-going-public-via-merger-with-blank-check-company-apex-technology-2020-11-23](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/microsoft-cloud-partner-avepoint-going-public-via-merger-with-blank-check-company-apex-technology-2020-11-23)\n\n[https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/avepoint-public-via-spac-valued-160729256.html](https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/avepoint-public-via-spac-valued-160729256.html)\n\n[https://www.benzinga.com/m-a/20/11/18489999/microsoft-cloud-provider-avepoint-going-public-via-apex-technology-spac](https://www.benzinga.com/m-a/20/11/18489999/microsoft-cloud-provider-avepoint-going-public-via-apex-technology-spac)\n\nDisclaimer: I have APXT shares and this does not constitute financial advice.",

The challenge will be a lack of quick entry options through acquisition, meaning the likely approach for Salesforce would be to build organically and scale by drafting off the larger infrastructure players.\n\nFor instance, right now, Salesforce uses preferred cloud relationships for its various apps. AWS for its core CRM, and Azure for its Marketing Cloud. To maximize revenue, and overtime profit, Salesforce would be best served to build its own infrastructure, then scale out using third-party data center hosts such as Equinix to minimize build-out costs but maintain full control of the data and customer environment. This has been the approach of Oracle and IBM, and it wouldn\u2019t be an overnight process.",
