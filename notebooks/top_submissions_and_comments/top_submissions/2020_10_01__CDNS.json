        "selftext": "\"**We hosted a call on Friday, October 2nd with Erin Meyer, author of No Rules Rules \u2013 Netflix and the Culture of Reinvention, a recent book Erin co-authored with CEO Reed Hastings.** We delved into the philosophy behind Netflix\u2019s Culture Deck, drawing on Erin\u2019s inside look with interviews from over 200 current and past employees globally at Netflix, and sought to answer what made Netflix\u2019s culture so radically unique, how sustainable it is as Netflix expands its reach globally, and whether the magic can continue without its current leadership. A replay is available upon request. Please contact your RBC sales representative for details. Key takeaways:\"\n\n\"**What is the Netflix Culture?:** Netflix published its famous Culture Deck back in 2009. Among its key concepts were the Keeper Test (keep those you would fight to keep, adequate performance gets a generous severance package), and Freedom &amp; Responsibility (\u201cF&amp;R\u201d, which Reed sometimes referred to as \u201coperating on the edge of chaos,\u201d offering employees the ability to operate with maximum flexibility and very few rules. What makes such radical concepts work? Erin noted the foundational premise of the **Netflix culture is that Freedom Breeds Innovation, Process Kills Flexibility**. And to get to this level of freedom requires first achieving talent density by hiring the very best talent with pay at the top of the market. It also requires employees to give each other (including Reed) feedback frequently and candidly. Coupling that with the Keeper Test ensures those who don\u2019t make the cut get a generous severance, while the \u201cstunning colleagues\u201d are retained with a continuously adjusted top of the market pay. Erin pointed out that while many corporate cultures tend to be filled with generalized positive terms, Netflix seeks to identify the key dilemmas (e.g. job security vs. talent density) and set guidelines on how employees should make decisions.\"\n\n\"**Will Netflix Work Without Reed?** Erin believes the corporate culture makes the success of the company, and the exceptional quality of Reed is that he not only preaches the ethos, but actively lives it by incorporating culture discussions in every leadership meeting, frequently soliciting feedback and more importantly celebrating feedback received from employees up and down the company. Erin saw the same candor and transparency with new co-CEO Ted Sarandos and across the organization. But is Reed the tent pole that Netflix couldn\u2019t run without? While Erin acknowledged F&amp;R couldn\u2019t be implemented without a leadership\u2019s full support and commitment, she also saw the same principle fully embodied in Sarandos\u2019s leadership as well as that of many other executives. Would the Netflix Culture disintegrate if Reed hops on a sailboat tomorrow? No, though Erin believes sustaining this secret sauce of Netflix\u2019s success requires the next CEO to be fully committed to the same principles that made Netflix what it is today. As for the newly announced co-CEO structure, Erin believes it should be business-as-usual for Netflix save for a title change given the company\u2019s unique F&amp;R principles.\"\n\n\"**How does the Culture Translate Overseas?** We believe in the next decade, Netflix\u2019 game plan in international markets will be the key driver of its 500x30 (our estimate of 500MM subs by 2030). Erin was a skeptic when Reed asked if F&amp;R and the culture of candor can be applied to Netflix\u2019s global offices as the company prepared its big 130-country expansion in 2016. Some regions like the Netherlands work particularly well with this culture \u2013 which Reed believed was foundational to its Freedom principle, while other regions like Japan, Singapore, and Brazil initially struggled. To crack the culture code, Netflix introduced a focus on relationship building that provided the context for amicable candor, as well as more formal feedback sessions that seem to have done the trick for its Japan office, though Erin believes this will be an ongoing learning experience as Netflix continues to expand its global footprint.\"\n\n\"**On the Edge of Chaos**: Erin believes the emphasis on candor and feedback is in fact not unique to Netflix, and is becoming a wave embraced by a growing number of corporates beyond Silicon Valley. The notion of talent density is also not unique. But where Erin thinks Netflix truly differentiates is in radically minimizing policies and processes \u2013 no vacation &amp; expenses policy, no decision-making approvals, and no management by objectives like KPIs. Perhaps part of what drove Netflix\u2019s impressive cadence of putting out hit content across genres (from The Crown to Tiger King) lies in the magic of what Reed calls \u201coperating on the edge of chaos\u201d or as Netflix\u2019s Head of HR Jessica Neal puts it \u2013 \u201cDon\u2019t control your stunning employees, let them run free.\u201d",

        "selftext": "**1st TLDR**: Quest Diagnostics may have a lot of new business and backlog that is not priced in. Covid testing is a new revenue stream and they probably have a backlog from all of the medical procedures that couldn\u2019t get done during lockdown. This is a medium conviction trade for me (lower side of medium).\n\nThank you to everyone for the feedback on my boring plays post. This was mentioned by u/WillyGeyser and u/spacegrab. I think this one has a good shot. Many of you are familiar with Quest Diagnostics. You have probably been there at some point or used their services for bloodwork or drug tests. They could post a big beat with good guidance after hours. (I know you have an hour left. I have been in meetings all day but wanted to get this out in case it popped. Luckily, it\u2019s at a low now.)\n\n**Factors:**\n\n1. **Covid Contracts**\\-Multiple people have mentioned that their schools have regular Covid testing contracts with Quest. The colleges and schools that opened up have testing at a given cadence set up as a means of preventing an outbreak. This is a new revenue stream that probably isn\u2019t going away any time soon.\n2. **Testing Backlog**\\- During the lockdown, many areas hospitals were flooded, and surgeons were only allowed to do surgery if the patient was at risk of losing \u201clife or limb\u201d. Elective surgeries are money makers for hospitals and surgeons too, so they obviously want these done since Covid was a big money drain on them. Anything that was postponed, from well visits to surgery, has gotten jammed in these past couple of months. I have a family member that needed to wait for a procedure. They needed bloodwork ahead of time, and the only slot available within a 1.5 week period was 6AM or something silly like that. \n3. **Search Traffic**\\-See below for Google Trends. We had a high spike the end of June and early July as well as the end of August into early September. (This affirms the possible school contract theory. The locations are interesting heat map wise- Pennsylvania has the same spike pattern and they are a college haven if that\u2019s worth anything.)  People would probably search this the first time they needed it. So, it wouldn't get a lot of recurring I would think.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Nationwide](https://preview.redd.it/qoapnjqyyhu51.png?width=1353&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=969e0a197cc4d6105fc83f68b95005072be6223a)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Hotspots for Quest near me search](https://preview.redd.it/x43chcl0zhu51.png?width=1218&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5c8b7c49b299ca5131fa63bbd8b54129fc9a9ab1)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Search trend for Pennsylvania](https://preview.redd.it/f5jdq6b3zhu51.png?width=1350&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ddeb212ccef6872787339b65bef5e94b16362152)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Possible Counterpoints:**\n\n1. They have been asking for payment up front because of issues with insurance payouts apparently. This could be bullish or bearish. It depends on accounting practices, how bad the issues are now, etc. I won\u2019t pretend to know this. It could bite us.\n2. The testing backlog may not be as big as I am thinking it is and they may be slow on other business as other areas have been in lockdown.\n\n**TLDR 2:** I think the positives outweigh the negatives with this one. I am in a 10% position with November 130C and a single 135C for a little spice (it\u2019s low liquidity). As I mentioned before, it\u2019s on the lower side of medium conviction, but I figured we could use something else for AH so we\u2019re not all in on Tesla. I also have a 5% in NTGR Nov40C thanks to u/shinzo123123 .",

        "selftext": "Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/smallstreetbets. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning October 19th, 2020.\n\n# **More volatility is likely ahead as rising cases, lack of stimulus overshadow strong earnings  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/16/more-volatility-is-likely-ahead-as-rising-cases-lack-of-stimulus-overshadow-strong-earnings.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Another volatile week may be in store for traders as coronavirus cases rise in the U.S. and Europe while Democrats and Republicans remain at an impasse over new fiscal aid.\n*****\n&gt; The Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&amp;P 500 fell for three straight days this week. That slide was the longest losing streak for the averages since mid-September. The two market benchmarks eked out slight gains on Friday to snap their losing streak.\n*****\n&gt; Investors and traders expect this choppy trading action to continue, especially as the worsening coronavirus data and a lack of U.S. coronavirus stimulus draw attention away from a strong earnings season thus far.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe combination of no stimulus, fading economic momentum, and the threat of rising coronavirus cases, creates a rather negative dynamic for risk assets right now,\u201d said Tom Essaye, founder of The Sevens Report, in a note to clients.\n*****\n&gt; The seven-day average of new daily coronavirus infections has risen in 39 states, including New York, New Jersey and Wisconsin, according to a CNBC analysis of data from Johns Hopkins University and the U.S. Census Bureau. At the nationwide level, the rate of new daily cases is at its highest level since August.\n*****\n&gt; In Europe, the seven-day average of new Covid-19 cases has surpassed that of the U.S., leading several countries in the region to reinstate tougher social distancing rules and roll back previous reopening measures.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWhat this means is economic activity may slow down a bit, and we\u2019ve already started to see some of that in the data,\u201d said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities, noting the weekly jobless claims numbers released Thursday show they\u2019ve reached a point where \u201cthey\u2019re not going to get better; they\u2019re going to get worse.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; The Labor Department said initial U.S. jobless claims hit their highest level since August, reaching 898,000 in the week ending Oct. 10.\n*****\n&gt; Investors will also keep their eyes on Washington during the week ahead as lawmakers continue to struggle over new U.S. fiscal stimulus.\n*****\n&gt; # Political posturing on stimulus \u2018hurting\u2019 those in need\n&gt; This week, President Donald Trump said he would raise his offer for a coronavirus aid above the current level of $1.8 trillion. The White House\u2019s current offer is smaller than a $2.2 trillion package passed by the House. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., has said the administration\u2019s proposal \u201cfalls significantly short\u201d of what is needed.\n*****\n&gt; This back and forth between the two parties has dwindled expectations among market participants of a compromise being reached before the Nov. 3 election. It has also added to the concerns surrounding the U.S. economic recovery.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThis political posturing is hurting that cohort of the economy that needs help the most,\u201d said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. \u201cTo the small and mid-size business owner, the airlines, this is not just about politics; this is every day life. There going to be an impact in the real economy if we don\u2019t see something now.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # Earnings season ignored?\n&gt; Those talks over further stimulus are also expected to divert attention away from the corporate earnings season, which began this week but had next to no impact on the broader market.\n*****\n&gt; Procter &amp; Gamble, Netflix, Travelers, American Airlines and American Express are among the companies slated to report next week.\n*****\n&gt; JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs and VF Corp. are among the 49 S&amp;P 500 companies that posted their latest quarterly results this week. Of those 49 companies, 86% reported better-than-expected earnings, according to data from The Earnings Scout.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI wish I could say that next week we\u2019re going to put aside the politics and the Covid concerns behind us, but we won\u2019t trade this earnings season,\u201d said Hogan of National Securities. \u201cWhile it will likely be a record-breaking season for companies beating estimates, it\u2019s also going to be one that is largely ignored because there\u2019re so many other macro factors that are more important.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; There is also some important housing data in the week ahead, including home builders\u2019 sentiment Monday, housing starts Tuesday, and existing home sales Thursday.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe housing market is still off to the races,\u201d said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics. \u201cThe mortgage applications were strong, suggesting very strong activity in the month of September.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Zandi said the market will eventually cool when interest rates begin to rise. But for now, \u201ccertainly the economy could use the juice.\u201d\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/6i8E0Lr.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/zGJke6U.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/jkd6p4Z.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/sQiEyVc.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/zksl2rH.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/eBTMjg7.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/xUN9dhd.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Tu2aS7U.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/ffP3FJL.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/nGdIfrv.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/TrguDpO.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/4CSvumn.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/GN3ZIki.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 5 Charts We Are Watching\n\n&gt; There are many charts that caught our attention this week, and today we share the top 5 charts we\u2019re watching.\n\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 Index recently had a four-week losing streak and fell nearly 10% along the way, while the Nasdaq and many large cap tech stocks fell even more. Then in a big move higher over the past two weeks, many stocks moved from oversold to overbought in a very quick timeframe.\n\n&gt; As the LPL Chart of the Day shows, more than 90% of the components in the S&amp;P 500 were beneath their 10-day moving average on September 24 and within two weeks saw more than 90% above this short-term trend line. This type of buying thrust is consistent with future strong returns, suggests quick reversals from oversold to overbought are a good thing, and could bode well for stocks to outperform bonds well into 2021.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/10.16.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Parts of the economy are opening back up, while employment continues to disappoint. One specific area that continues to improve is how many people are flying, as the seven-day average number of travelers going through Transportation Security Administration (TSA) checkpoints hit a new recovery high. We discuss other high-frequency data points in our COVID Surge Stalling Europe\u2019s Recovery blog.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/10.16.20-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; We\u2019ve noted before that stock market gains ahead of the election historically support the incumbent party, while if stocks are lower it tends to support new leadership in the White House. Taking this further, the US dollar also tends to send signals for who might win. In fact, when stocks are up and the US dollar is lower ahead of the election, or if stocks are lower and the US dollar is higher before an election, the results have accurately predicted the last seven times those scenarios took place. Given stocks are up and the US dollar is slightly lower, this could be one clue the upcoming election will be much closer than many are expecting.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/10.16.20-Blog-Chart-3.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Sticking with the election, many investors are worried about higher taxes and more deregulation if former Vice President Joe Biden wins. \u201cHigher taxes may be one part of it, but Biden is also looking at huge spending initiatives,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cStock markets like spending, and this could more than help offset potentially higher taxes.\u201d Lower tariffs could potentially provide another offset as well.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/10.16.20-Blog-Chart-4.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Last, Friday\u2019s retail sales report came in better than expected, marking five consecutive months of year-over-year gains. It is worth noting the economy has never been in a recession after 4 or more consecutive monthly gains. Still, in the face of one of the most severe recessions ever, it took only a few months for sales to get back to new highs, as shown below. Historically, new highs in retail sales happen in expansions\u2014and this is yet another clue the recession is likely over.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/10.16.20-Blog-Chart-5.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Record Surge In Business Formations As Economy Recovers From COVID\n\n&gt; Yesterday the Census updated business formation stats for Q3, and as indicated by high-frequency data from the Atlanta Fed, business formation exploded in Q3. As shown in the first chart below, total business applications rocketed upwards by 1.57 million, a record increase. Stripping out businesses that are unlikely to result in hiring, the numbers are much smaller in absolute terms but still rose 79% to a record pace. Finally, applications for businesses with planned wages surged 70% from a record low in Q2, to the highest levels since 2008.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/101520-Biz-Apps.png))**\n\n&gt; In all three instances, the recent behavior is a complete reversal of the post-Financial Crisis period, when the prolonged recession led to a huge decline in business starts. That\u2019s a good sign for the breadth of the economic rebound, as business formation tends to lead to higher productivity thanks to more innovation and investment. Below we show changes in total business applications by state; Michigan, Illinois, and Georgia are the biggest winners, with applications more than doubling. This analysis was originally published in our evening report -- The Closer -- on 10/14/20.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/101520-Biz-Apps-State.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # B.I.G. Tips - Retail Sales Rebound\n\n&gt; After a disappointment last month, Retail Sales saw a nice rebound in September as consumers seem undeterred from spending despite the expiration of extended UI benefits and the lack of an additional stimulus bill. For the month of September, headline Retail Sales rose 1.9% m/m versus expectations for a more modest increase of 0.8%. Ex Autos and Gas, growth was even better relative to expectations, although August\u2019s already slower than expected growth was revised modestly lower.\n\n&gt; Breadth in this month\u2019s report was strong. Of the thirteen sectors that comprise the total pie, all but one of them (Electronics and Appliances) showed growth. Normally, when a sector shows m/m growth of a percent or two, it\u2019s impressive. This month, though, the volatility of the pandemic remains in place as two sectors showed growth of over 5%, including Clothing which saw double-digit growth relative to August!\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/sectors1016.png))**\n\n&gt; While the monthly pace of retail sales is back at all-time highs, the characteristics behind the total level of sales have changed markedly in the post COVID world. In our just-released B.I.G. Tips report, we looked at these changing dynamics to highlight the groups that have been the biggest winners and losers from the shifts.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # University of Michigan Mixed Again\n\n&gt; The University of Michigan reported preliminary consumer sentiment numbers for October. University of Michigan data has shown a much smaller bounce than other sentiment surveys, but the preliminary numbers for October did increase versus September. The strongest part of the survey was expectations, which has risen three months in a row to the highest levels since March. Consumers' current assessment of the economy fell sequentially and is sitting at about the same place it was back in early 2012.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/101620-Michigan.png))**\n\n&gt; One feature of the University of Michigan poll with incomplete data prior to 2016 but more complete data since is a breakout of economic sentiment by political party affiliation. As shown below, their data shows Republicans getting a massive sentiment boost in the wake of the 2016 election. The key here though, is that the boost to the sentiment of Republicans and the decline for Democrats came after the election as this data is definitely lagging to political outcomes rather than leading.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/101620-Michigan-Part.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Small Business Smiles\n\n&gt; Sentiment among small businesses continued to improve in the month of September according to the NFIB's monthly Small Business Optimism Index. As shown below, the index rose 3.8 points to 104 which is now just half of a point below the levels prior to the pandemic in February. That was also better than expectations of a smaller improvement to 101.2. Small business sentiment has now risen in four of the past five months.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/101320-NFIB-Headline.png))**\n\n&gt; In the table below, we break down this month's report by each of the ten components of the headline number as well as the many other indices included in the report such as those not used as inputs to the headline number and what small businesses are reporting to be their biggest problems.\n\n&gt; Across all indices of the September report, breadth was solid with only a couple of indices falling month over month\u2014Expected Credit Conditions and Credit Conditions Availability. Some of those that were higher saw record or near-record month-over-month increases.\n\n&gt; Some of the most notable indices this month included those regarding inventories. The Current Inventories index which gauges the net percent of owners viewing current inventory levels as too low rose 2 points to a record high reading of 5. Given this, the index for Plans to Increase Inventories is tied with the reading from November of 2004 for a record high of 11. Indicating low inventory levels, the report is consistent with some other recent data like the regional Fed manufacturing surveys. Those low inventories are resulting in higher prices as that index's 12-point increase in September marked the biggest one month gain on record. While the Higher Prices index is not at any sort of an extreme, September's move indicates that a rising number of businesses are raising prices.\n\n&gt; Additionally, those higher prices and lower inventory numbers appear to be a result of demand that continues to rapidly improve. The indices for Actual Sales and Actual Earnings Changes remain negative for a sixth and tenth month in a row, respectively, meaning a net number of businesses continue to see lower rather than higher top and bottom-line numbers. But these indices are seeing big moves higher. For the index of Actual Earnings Changes, the 13-point climb in September was the largest on record and the 9-point increase for Actual Sales Changes followed a 13-point increase in August; both being some of the largest one-month moves on record. In order to meet the needs of this demand, a higher number of businesses plan to increase employment with that index rising to 28; the highest level since December of 2018. Even though businesses seek to hire more, they also report it is hard to fill positions as the index of Job Openings Hard to Fill rose to the top 5% of all readings. Cost and quality of labor also were reported as two of the most pressing problems for businesses.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/101320-NFIB-Table2.png))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/101320-NFIB-Components.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Small Businesses Cautiously Optimistic\n\n&gt; In an earlier post, we highlighted the details of the September NFIB Small Business Optimism report. The report showed overall sentiment among small businesses has continued to improve as demand has bounced back (though it has not yet fully recovered as still more businesses report lower sales and earnings on a net basis) leading to low inventory levels, higher prices, and a need for more employment. While generally improved conditions have lifted optimism, that is not to say small businesses have given an all-clear. The Uncertainty Index from NFIB has risen each of the past three months with September's 2-point increase bringing it back to the same level as March of this year. In other words, it is perhaps best to say that small businesses are cautiously optimistic.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/101320-NFIB-Uncertainty.png))**\n\n&gt; From the pandemic to the Election, there are plenty of reasons for businesses to be uncertain. As for what they are reporting to be the biggest problems, labor remains at the top. 30% of businesses have reported that either cost (9%) or more predominately quality (21%) of labor are their biggest issues. While off the highs from the past few years, the current readings are still historically elevated.\n\n&gt; Behind labor, government related problems also are largely on the minds of business owners. Government red tape and taxes combine to account for 29% of businesses' biggest problems. While that is a large share, neither of those indices are at any sort of extreme.\n\n&gt; Poor sales, on the other hand, remains as the third major concern for businesses. 12% of businesses reported poor sales as the single most important issue in September, down from 15% in August and 7-percentage points lower than the April peak. While improved, the number of businesses seeing demand as a major issue is still at some of the highest levels of the past several years.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/101320-NFIB-Most-Import-Problems.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Sentiment By State\n\n&gt; Below is a look at the year-to-date reading for the high-frequency Morning Consult daily consumer sentiment indicator. While still well off highs seen prior to the COVID Crash in late February and early March, sentiment has generally been ticking higher off the lows. You'll notice in the chart below, however, that while the \"Future Expectations\" reading is still bouncing back nicely, the \"Current Conditions\" reading has been going more sideways over the last couple of months.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/101420-MC.png))**\n\n&gt; We can also look closer into state level readings from the daily Morning Consult sentiment numbers. In the heat map below, we show the changes in the levels of consumer sentiment for each state since mid-February. As shown, the lower 48 have seen much larger improvements than Alaska or Hawaii with the largest improvements coming in the Northeast and parts of the Midwest. On the other hand, in addition to Hawaii and Alaska, some of the key swing states like Maine, New Hampshire, and Nevada have improved the least. Of all 50 states, Vermont's current reading on sentiment is the closest to its February levels, but even Vermont is still down 17.9 points.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/101420-MC-By-State.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending October 16th, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED.)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 10.18.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOJ8b0hke_s))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$TSLA** \n&gt; * **$NFLX** \n&gt; * **$PG** \n&gt; * **$INTC** \n&gt; * **$LMT** \n&gt; * **$ABT** \n&gt; * **$KO** \n&gt; * **$T** \n&gt; * **$HAL** \n&gt; * **$SNAP** \n&gt; * **$PM** \n&gt; * **$VZ** \n&gt; * **$AAL** \n&gt; * **$ERIC** \n&gt; * **$LOGI** \n&gt; * **$WGO** \n&gt; * **$IBM** \n&gt; * **$PLD** \n&gt; * **$TMO** \n&gt; * **$CMG** \n&gt; * **$LGND** \n&gt; * **$LUV** \n&gt; * **$CDNS** \n&gt; * **$TSCO** \n&gt; * **$DGX** \n&gt; * **$LII** \n&gt; * **$NDAQ** \n&gt; * **$LRCX** \n&gt; * **$PHG** \n&gt; * **$BIIB** \n&gt; * **$CLF** \n&gt; * **$ACI** \n&gt; * **$ONB** \n&gt; * **$TXN** \n&gt; * **$SYF** \n&gt; * **$NEE** \n&gt; * **$GPK** \n&gt; * **$TRV** \n&gt; * **$SFNC** \n&gt; * **$FCX** \n&gt; * **$MAN** \n&gt; * **$IRBT** \n&gt; * **$CMA** \n&gt; * **$LLNW**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/ffP3FJL.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/nGdIfrv.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 10.19.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/9fUPN3h.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 10.19.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/xQoRNmb.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday  10.20.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/sWeYEHF.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 10.20.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Ne3gwPi.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 10.21.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/bNGBGWs.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 10.21.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/uPFnifS.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 10.22.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/lk20RGG.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 10.22.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/I007KF1.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 10.23.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/I0WSfDw.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 10.23.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Tesla, Inc. $439.67\n**Tesla, Inc.

It is not illegal for these people to buy or sell their own shares.\nIn fact, since most of them get paid in stock options, it is expected. However, it is illegal for them to trade on inside information\nthat has not been made public. So for example if there are drug trial results that are bad and not public,\ninsiders cannot dump shares. That said, many people have observed that insiders - in general - seem to have a good\ntrack record at timing their purchases.
