        "selftext": "So maybe I'm a bit OCD but I like to have a portfolio that has a company that starts with each letter. I can have more than 26 stocks, but each letter has to be represented. Am I the only one who does this?\n\nHere's my ABC portfolio:\n\nA is for Alphabet (and Amazon and American Tower)\n\nB is for Bluerock\n\nC is for Comcast-NBC (and Cloudflare, Coca Cola and Crown Castle)\n\nD is for Disney (and Danaher and Duke Energy)\n\nE is for Enbridge\n\nF is for Forrester Research\n\nG is for Goldman Sachs\n\nH is for Hershey\n\nI is for Imperial Oil\n\nJ is for Johnson and Johnson\n\nK is for Kaiser Aluminum\n\nL is for Lemonade\n\nM is for Microsoft\n\nN is for New York Times\n\nO is for Orange\n\nP is for Purple Innovation\n\nQ is for Qorvo (might replace with Qualcomm soon)\n\nR is for Royal Bank of Canada (and Raytheon Technologies, Redfin and Rosetta Stone)\n\nS is for Starbucks (and Southwest Airlines and Square)\n\nT is for Tesla (and Trade Desk)\n\nU is for Union Pacific\n\nV is for Visa\n\nW is for Walmart (and Waste Management)\n\nX is for Xcel Energy\n\nY is for Yum Brands\n\nZ is for Zillow\n\n40 stocks total atm. 26 minimum, but I'm definitely overdiversified between C and R. In an ideal world, I would trim to 32-36, or the typical sports league.\n\nAny changes you would make? Any weird quirks you follow in building your portfolio?",
