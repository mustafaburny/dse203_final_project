        "selftext": "So just got into covered calls recently. I purchased 600 shares of RIDE for an average cost of 9.76. \n\nI wrote 5 calls on Monday expiring yesterday for 0.90 with 10$ strike. So that would br 450$ in premium and 120$ of stock movement because I will be assigned at 10.\n\n I wrote another call few days later and sold that at 0.31 10.5$ strike. So that's 31$ premium+74$ (stock movement/assignment. \n\nIt closed at 10.65$ on Friday. So that's 575$ I made on covered calls for a total cost of 5,856$. That's a 0.098% gain in 5 days. I know the stock can dive and I'll either have to keep writing covered calls on it until it comes back up or cut my losses but is this normal? To see this amount of gains like this? I also made about $400 on 300 shares of a different stock doing same thing. I though covered calls were low risk low reward, and these gains were not seen on weeklies? I sold 1 strike OTM each time so I know that premium will be higher but damn I can't pass 900$ a week up.",

        "selftext": "Here is the translation of the best analysis of the taurus stock. by: Rafael Freitas\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n$TASA3 $TASA4\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1Q21\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPossibly this is the last thread I will do about the role. I've already exposed the bulk of the thesis here and it all ends up getting boring.\n\nShare capital, CVM358, balance sheets, expenses. Everything has already been said. Exceptionally, something very off the radar, I\n\nI come back here out of respect for those who followed the news, to talk about something more complex about the case.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLet's get to the result. Trying to model what was to come in this first quarter, the accounts were simple. Always taking 4Q20 as a reference. Most of the data was already known.\n\nwe would have\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n \n\nan average dollar of 5.48 for revenue, +1.7% and 5.70, +9.6% (last ptax) for cash markdown + company debt, QoQ. Obviously, generating the well-known financial expense for us, eroding a good part of the period's net income.\n\nWe also knew that production would have ended the quarter\n\nwith 8,500 weapons/day, against 8,200 a/d. The transfer of 13.2% of IGPM on revenue from the domestic market, and, obviously, the average ticket, which was perhaps the main point to be addressed by the company, at 210U$ consolidated in 2020.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, in a call with RI, there was already the theoretical\n\ninformation that the average production for the quarter would have been slightly lower than the peak production in late March. What didn't cross my mind was that this number would come 7% lower. Yes, we ended 1Q21 with an average of 7,900 weapons/day. All this was addressed to\n\nwith the company. From the outset, it is understood that every manufacturing process involves issues that a simple rule of 3 does not include. There were mandatory vacations, fewer working days and training that would imply optimizing your current process lines.\n\nThat said, at first the\n\nrevenue below 4Q20 caught my attention. Again, the issue of daily production ends up being one of the reasons. Going further, I bring up a reflection on the company's audit regarding this amount of weapons produced daily. The volume was higher QoQ, which, instinctively,\n\nit would not make sense if the 8,200 guns/day of the 4Q had been conceived. This is something of internal management, which I will cover later, especially regarding the upcoming production. Anyway, let's go back: despite the theoretical shortfall in this first quarter of the year, the volume\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n \n\nGREATER produced, thus, attention is paid to SMALLER revenue, in addition to a SALES volume, also LOWER, QoQ.\n\nLet's do it by steps. Synthesizing. We produce more, sell less and generate less revenue per weapon sold. Average Ticket dropped. Why did this happen? We don't have the entire backorder\n\nsold?\n\nIt is here that the main points of this balance reside, which are not explicit to those who look only at the numbers.\n\n1-The QoQ stock grew 35%.\n\n2-The ticket actually fell. 498,000 weapons were sold. 512.5M of revenue generated. Dollar 5.48. This makes us reach a\n\naverage ticket of 187.8U$ per quarter in question. 11% lower than the 2020 consolidated.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- What the fuck was that!? haha\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEverything needs to be analyzed calmly. They exist\n\nreasons for the above. Once again, everything was promptly addressed to the company, which was very helpful in answering all points. The ticket dropped due to turnover and breakdown of sales and specific production in the 1Q. Mostly low value products were sold\n\nlike Heritage, which would tend to generate less revenue for us, but higher margin. So it was done. (Follows message from CFO, S\u00e9rgio). The ticket being disclosed only in the 4Q annual result has a reason. This composition is dynamic. The 2Q will contain billing for Rifles,\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n \n\nbeing sold for at least 560U$. 200% above the 1Q ticket. The company continues with its relentless commitment to add the increase in this consolidated average ticket in 2021, as this is one of the main points where there is room for Taurus to grow at the expense of its competitors.\n\nTherefore, this potential revenue additive should appear in the next results.\n\nThe stock inventory and its fattening. Why was this production not readily transformed into sales, given the backorder sold? The answer is simpler than it sounds and brings out, once again,\n\nreal life stuff. Logistics. Yes, logistics. The majority of BR production takes an average of 15-20 days to arrive in the US. Included in this current stock are weapons destined for bids already known by the market, and, quite possibly, part of the GX4, with scheduled release\n\nfor May 19th.\n\nLet's go back to quantitative analysis and company perspectives. Commented on this adverse issue of the audit regarding the average daily production of weapons, this time the doubt was removed so that there was no room for interpretation. Taurus 2Q21 is operating with\n\na daily production capacity of 9,510 weapons per day. 20% more than the 1Q21 average.\n\nCapabilities and process improvements, together with the continued ramp up of Georgia, which, by the way, uses 30-40% of its current land for operations, leaving A LOT of margin\n\nof business expansion in the future, coupled with new lines, such as the one mentioned earlier about GX4, are increasing the company's productivity and capacity to reach a new operational level.\n\nA simple account. I will use 9,750 weapons/day as an average by the end of 2021.\n\n492,000 weapons produced this year.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n492,000 + 9,750 x 191 business days (2T (63), 3T (65), 4T (63) = 2,354,250 WEAPONS\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat's right. This had already been commented on both by RI and by Sal\u00e9sio. But there is always pragmatism on both sides, and this, in fact, is the best way to\n\nfollow. This number implies paying for the complete backorder of the company still in 2021. At least as far as its production is concerned. Final sales could spill over into 1Q22. Little changes. What needs to be highlighted is the company's current potential. Which is NOT in the prices, and NOT\n\nit reflects the maximum capacity they can get, as I see many preaching.\n\nThe case today reflects strategic planning delivery. There is no longer the asymmetry of a turnaround, however, what is on the table still exposes us to a beautiful earning potential.\n\nI will not\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n \n\nbring up here calculations and calculations of how much revenue would tend to generate from the total sale of this backorder, much less how much the 2021 consolidated ticket could be. You need to sensitize scenarios with an average dollar for this year and understand where you are getting into.\n\nI remain very calm with the charge of my position, even having increased it at the beginning of the trading session.\n\nFinally, the debt, just to make an imagination of the scenario in terms of multiples.\n\nNet debt closed the quarter at 665.7m. With 221.5M in the maturity profile for 2021.\n\n\\~100M rollable.\n\nForget about those projections they brought in on the balance sheet including the sale of helmets and land in POA. Use this as an add-on if they materialize.\n\n2021 final EV -&gt; I'll embed the remaining T13 and T15 deleveraging here (full subscription)\n\nand do not put anything on the account of the T17s still in circulation. That would take us to -80M provided with this strand. I will use the 5.40 dollar as a base, both to calculate debt and ebitda. That said, keeping the current composition unchanged, we would have -40M currency exposure. Now the\n\nmain point when measuring the company's enterprise value: The possible cash until the end of 2021. Excluding the debt that will have to be paid by the end of that year (110M) and adding 150M of capex announced by the company (these launches can be diluted ), I'll just\n\nnormalize 1Q21 EBIT to imagine where we would be headed. (168.4\\*3T remaining).\n\nEV 115,000,000 (diluted Q13/Q15) \\* 26.00 + DIV BRU \u2013 CAIXA E RECEB (220,000,000) / EBITDA (30% mg 2.4B revenue {800,000,000}) = 4.01x End 2021\n\nThe company's net margin ex-effects does not\n\nrecurring rates in this quarter reached 26.2%. Once again, make the calculations of how much revenue the company could generate and make this number aware to arrive at the end of the period. Addendum 1: this excludes all sorts of non-recurring effects. Addendum 2: weakening dollar we should\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nsee smaller margins. Do your calculations. Target intact. 45 BRL KD lowered qoq, WACC 8-9% perpetuity 4%, under these conditions I would be satisfied.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHugs and have a nice weekend, everyone. Forget short term swing",

        "selftext": "Thing are looking up in SPAC land and there are still hundreds of SPACs' warrants under $1. It seems the appetite for risk is returning and prices have started appreciating rapidly. Fortunately there are still good warrants to be found at good prices.\n\n***DISCLAIMER:*** *I am not a financial advisor. I have 93 different warrants positions (80 still pre-DA) and have spent the past three months building out positions in as many good teams as I can as close to all-time lows, and I have positions in all the 12 of the warrants mentioned in this article.

If you are looking for a good aerospace SPAC it may well be the best:\n\n* Dennis A. Muilenburg, the former CEO of Boeing, \n* Marion Blakey, the former Administrator of the FAA, former CEO of the Aerospace Industries Association and former CEO of Rolls-Royce NA, \n* Howard Lance, the former CEO of Maxar and Harris, \n* Christopher Lofgren, Chairman of the US Chamber of Commerce and the CEO of Schneider National\n* Gen. Stephen Wilson, ret. 4 Star Air Force General and Vice Chief of Staff of the Air Force\n* Top advisors include Paul Eremenko, fmr CTO at Airbus, Gur Kimchi, Co-Founder of Amazon Prime Air, Dr. John Tracy, VP of Engineering at Boeing, and more...\n\n# LCAH-WT \n\n**Last Trade:** $0.865 \n\n**Warrants in Units:** 1/4\n\n**Sector:** Consumer, Dining, Hospitality, Entertainment, Gaming \n\n**Previous/Related:** GNOG. GNOG warrants were early redeemed and hit a high price of $10.56.\n\n**Team:** Tilman Fertitta (Houston Rockets owner, CEO of Landry's)\n\n**CLAA-WT** \\- Last Trade: $0.90 - 1/5 warrants in units, and one of the cheapest in that split. The team's previous SPAC was OUST, which successfully completed a merger and the warrants are currently at $3.35, with a high price of $4.57.\n\n# GLBLW\n\n**Last Trade:** $0.69\n\n**Warrants in Units:** 1/3\n\n**Sector:** Not specified, but suggest \"proven business models as we do not intend to assume risks of unproven technologies \"\n\n**Team:** Very solid team for this price: Peter Yu (Managing Partner at Cartesian, former CEO of AIG Capital Partners, Former Director National Economic Council), Elias Dias Sese (President of Northern Europe Kraft Heinz, Former CEO of Tim Hortons), Daniel Karp (Former VP of Worldwide Business Development at Pfizer) \n\n# AGGRW\n\n**Last Trade:** $0.78\n\n**Warrants in Units:** 1/3\n\n**Sector:** Tech - Software, HCIT, Fintech, robotics/automation, EdTech  \n\n**Team:** Jay Bhatt (Former CEO, Alfresco Software; Former CEO, Blackboard), John Newton (Founder/CTO, Alfresco Software), Steven Alesio (Former Chairman/CEO, Dun &amp; Bradstreet), Carol Bartz (Former CEO of Yahoo! and Autodesk), Carl Bass (Director and Fmr CEO of Autodesk; Fmr Director, Hewlett-Packard)   \n\n# DHBC-WT \n\n**Last Trade:** $0.73\n\n**Warrants in Units:** 1/3\n\n**Sector:** Financial Services\n\n**Team:** A very solid resumed team for warrants this cheap: Robert Hurst (Former Vice Chairman/ Head of Investment Banking Division, Goldman Sachs), Richard DeMartini (Former President of Asset Management, Bank of America, Former Chairman, Discover Card). \n\n# DTOC-WT \n\n**Last Trade:** $0.78\n\n**Warrants in Units**: 1/4. This is the cheapest 1/4 split warrant on the market as of last trade Friday.\n\n**Sector:** Healthcare Tech \n\n**The team:** Kevin Nazemi (Fmr Co-CEO, Oscar Health),Bradley Fluegel (Former Chief Strategy Officer, Walgreens &amp; Anthem), Jim Moffatt (Former Vice Chairman/Global CEO, Deloitte Consulting). \n\n# PCPC-WT\n\n**Last Trade:** $1.93\n\n**Warrants in Units:** 1/4. Remember when I said this post was about warrants under $1 and DTOC was the cheapest 1/4 split? Well, that was technically true, but PCPC-WT's $1.93 needs an asterisk: This SPAC is at 2.5x the scale of a normal SPAC, with a $25 per share baseline and a $28.75 strike. By that standard, these warrants at $1.93 would be worth .775 if it were a normal $10 base SPAC. \n\n**Team:** Led by Sahnjeev Mehra, founder and managing partner, Peripheras Capital. \n\n**Notable Feature:** It also has an investors-friendly CAPS incentive structure, where the founders get 6% on merger as opposed to the typical 20%, then provides payouts at certain price levels for sticking with the company long term.\n\n# BOAS-WT\n\n**Last Trade:** $0.67\n\n**Warrants in Units:** 1/3. One of the cheapest in that warrant split. \n\n**Focus:** PropTech\n\n**Team:** Scott Seligman, Chairman of The Seligman Group (a real estate development company), David Glazer (CFO, Palantir), Shane Battier (Former NBA player and VP of Analytics and Basketball Development, Miami Heat)\n\n# SGAMW (DA: REDBOX)\n\n**Last Trade:** 0.84\n\n**Valuation:** $693M, with 2021E revenues of $569M (EV 1.2x estimated revenues).\n\n**Why it's a buy:** According to conventional wisdom, Redbox is a dying company. People are moving away from conventional media like disc videogames and DVDs to all streaming. However, I think that conventional wisdom is from the perspective of those of us who have the privilege to afford internet, smart TVs and streaming services. 70% of Redbox's customers are \"late adopters\" - largely the elderly and low income. To these people, a $2 DVD rental for the latest release is a cheaper night of entertainment than most other forms, and Amazon digital movie rentals for the blockbuster new releases not on Prime are often over $6. Additionally, Redbox is pivoting to digital and supposedly more affordable for the same movies than Amazon. \n\n# LIVKW (DA: AGILETHOUGHT)\n\n**Last Trade:** 0.85\n\n**Valuation:** $482M for $184M in 2021E revenue (EV 2.6x estimated revenues)\n\n**Why it's a buy:** This is a boring IT services company that SPAC investors don't care about, heavily based around consultants in Mexico (even though the corporate HQ is in Dallas). This has led to it becoming underrated for a valuation this good, and for a company that has a good reputation in their field. They trade at very favorable multiples compared to other stocks in their field. One doesn't have to be a groundbreaking product for a company to be a good stock.\n\nGood luck!",

It can be confirmed that he armed foreign governments (Philippines) as is stated in the 1987 FBI report. This suggests Federal Arms and Empire State Arms were used to book Meridian's sales and launder the proceeds from such sales. He refused to give a sworn statement to the house committee regarding specifics of Meridian's specific business dealings (outside of discussing the loss incurred to him as a result of his L.A.P.D apprehension).\n\nNichols also established an arms dealing company of the same name during his time in Queensland, Australia:\n\n [https://opencorporates.com/companies/au/168176592](https://opencorporates.com/companies/au/168176592)\n\nThe existing entity, Meridian Fire Arms was established in 2011 (3 years after the Israel case):\n\n[https://opencorporates.com/companies/us\\_mi/801614393](https://opencorporates.com/companies/us_mi/801614393)\n\nAs a vendor they're listed as Meridian Defense Corp. or \"MDC\":\n\n[https://meridiandefensecorp.com/](https://meridiandefensecorp.com/)\n\nYes, Meridian is still in business to this day and their logo is an OCTOPUS.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3binldn13r371.png?width=125&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ab4230428d5c6deff466bb5fdb9fae39df39d515\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uh6an79x2r371.png?width=870&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=81f12f2adf06fd2c4d855afe8c61476f7b442881\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f4gbp0x73r371.png?width=792&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e0e52e1dd7695f3152ee9f1481602da0aff4f12f\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/msd0an8a3r371.png?width=869&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1b0d3ddc3454bd3addc1bb0918e952017af7dd8e\n\n[https://www.company-histories.com/The-Wackenhut-Corporation-Company-History.html](https://www.company-histories.com/The-Wackenhut-Corporation-Company-History.html)  \n\nHave fun.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIjxqks9ugo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIjxqks9ugo)\n\nThe source that reported this (Wayne Madsen) lacks credibility and has disseminated propaganda in much of his \"journalism\". Madsen has previously promoted propaganda through unsubstantiated conspiracy claims. Think COINTEL.\n\nMadsen previously served in the U.S Navy and NSA. He has been featured on such programs as 60 Minutes.\n\nGiven his involvement with confidential government programs in the past, I would be cautious of the potential for deliberate misinformation being disseminated by Madsen.\n\nIt was speculated by Channel 3 News' Nathan Baca that this may be an attempt to \"fake\" Robert Booth Nichols' death; a similar strategy employed by his business partner Samuel Israel.\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayne\\_Madsen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayne_Madsen)\n\nI don't know if Robert Booth Nichols was a CIA asset. I'm here to present information and receive scrutiny. But yeah. Weird.\n\n# What about the Octopus? That's just a crazy tall tale created by Robert Booth Nichols right?\n\nBelieve it or not, Sam Israel and Robert Booth Nichols are not the only individuals to mention the Octopus.\n\n[Freelance Journalist; Danny Casolaro](https://preview.redd.it/cwycwo7zyu371.jpg?width=240&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=606ad5e8ec900ca3f59f7b9278753d851ea51690)\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danny\\_Casolaro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danny_Casolaro)\n\n&gt;\"Joseph Daniel Casolaro (June 16, 1947 \u2013 August 10, 1991) was an American freelance writer who came to public attention in 1991 when he was found dead in a bathtub in room 517 of the Sheraton Hotel in Martinsburg, West Virginia, the medical examiner ruled the death a suicide.\"  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\"His death became controversial because his notes suggested he was in Martinsburg to meet a source about a story he called \"the Octopus.\" This centered on a sprawling collaboration involving an international cabal, and primarily featuring a number of stories familiar to journalists who worked in and around Washington, D.C. in the 1980s\u2014the Inslaw case about a software manufacturer whose owner accused the Justice Department of stealing its work product, the October Surprise theory that during the Iran hostage crisis Iran deliberately held back American hostages to help Ronald Reagan win the 1980 presidential election, the collapse of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International, and Iran\u2013Contra.\"  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\"Casolaro's family argued that he had been murdered; that before he left for Martinsburg, he had apparently told his brother that he had been frequently receiving harassing phone calls late at night; that some of them were threatening; and that if something were to happen to him while in Martinsburg, it would not be an accident. They also cited his well-known squeamishness and fear of blood tests, and stated they found it incomprehensible that if he were going to commit suicide, he would do so by cutting his wrists a dozen times. A number of law-enforcement officials also argued that his death deserved further scrutiny, and his notes were passed by his family to ABC News and Time Magazine, both of which investigated the case, but no evidence of murder was ever found.\"\n\nFrom the earlier quoting LA Times article: [https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1993-03-21-mn-13734-story.html](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1993-03-21-mn-13734-story.html)\n\nNichols had frequent contact with Casolaro just before the journalist, who was probing a web of conspiracies ranging from the Iran-Contra affair to alleged Justice Department skullduggery, was found with his wrists slashed in a West Virginia motel room.\n\nThe report, titled \u201cThe INSLAW Affair,\u201d said the Justice Department had failed to adequately investigate charges that high-level officials had stolen and misused a private firm\u2019s sophisticated computer software designed to help track criminals.\n\nRegarding the Inslaw Report:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/Epstein/comments/hmfc6k/beyond\\_ghislaine\\_the\\_maxwell\\_octopus/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Epstein/comments/hmfc6k/beyond_ghislaine_the_maxwell_octopus/)\n\nNichols acknowledged to committee investigators that he had spoken to Casolaro often and served as a sounding board for him, but would not provide a sworn statement to the House committee.\n\nThe trial, which enters its second week of testimony Monday, stems from a 1986 incident in which Nichols, armed with a concealed pistol, was taken into custody by Los Angeles police at The Palomino.\n\nNichols said he was with his brother-in-law, James Hopko (when)\n\n&gt;Without warning, Nichols testified, he was flung to the ground and two revolvers were pointed at his head. Nichols, who was carrying a concealed weapons permit from the Santa Clara County Sheriff\u2019s Department, was disarmed, handcuffed and transported to the North Hollywood LAPD station.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Nichols\u2019 suit charges that the loss of the permit led to a withdrawal of a Swiss financing for his firm, Meridian Arms Corp., to manufacture a new machine gun in South Korea.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;To buttress his client\u2019s credibility as a businessman, Nichols\u2019 lawyer introduced in court a flood of paper indicating that he had worked on numerous ventures with prominent individuals. They included Robert A. Maheu, Howard Hughes\u2019 former right-hand man; Michael A. McManus, an aide to President Ronald Reagan; Clint W. Murchison, then the owner of the Dallas Cowboys, and George K. Pender, an executive with a worldwide engineering company.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Nichols testified about discussions he had with a White House aide on the rebuilding of Lebanon while he was affiliated with Meridian\u2019s predecessor firm, Santa Monica-based First Intercontinental Development Corp. That firm supposedly specialized in secret foreign construction projects for the U.S. government.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Appended to Gates\u2019 affidavit was an Oct. 8, 1987, document stating that the FBI was investigating whether Giaquinto, Nichols and others were \u201cbuying and/or selling stocks by the use of manipulative or deceptive practices.\n\nWithout a doubt, Robert Booth Nichols was involved in mob-related investment schemes leveraging relationships he had established through the CIA, Wall Street and arms dealing ventures. Concerning, to say the least.\n\nIn his 2008 deposition, Nichols explains he was a member of the Board of Directors for George K. Pender's FIDCO.\n\nGeorge K. Pender's only business registration with any U.S State Department is as Director of First International Development Corporation (FIDCO) in Santa Monica, California.\n\n[https://www.corporationwiki.com/California/Cambria/first-intercontinental-development-corporation/40237496.aspx](https://www.corporationwiki.com/California/Cambria/first-intercontinental-development-corporation/40237496.aspx)\n\nWell, well, well.... Nichols stated FIDCO: \"specialized in secret foreign construction projects for the U.S. government.\" I wonder how common these \"secret foreign construction\" companies are?\n\nEarlier in the L.A Times article, Nichols explains being with his brother in-law James Hopko before being arrested by L.A.P.D officers.\n\n[https://www.corporationwiki.com/Hawaii/Honolulu/robert-b-nichols-P5886865.aspx](https://www.corporationwiki.com/Hawaii/Honolulu/robert-b-nichols-P5886865.aspx)\n\nThis business registration with the U.S State Department of Honolulu, lists an Ellen M. Hopko as secretary. This is Robert B. Nichols wife.\n\nThis report serves to expose certain established practices within high stakes and confidential societies.\n\nRobert Booth Nichols was investigated in 1987 by the FBI for:\n\n&gt;\"buying and/or selling stocks by the use of manipulative or deceptive practices.\"\n\nThe practice described above is the Modus Operandi of Ken Griffin/Citadel, Steve Cohen/Point72 , D.E Shaw, The Blackstone Group, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, KKR, BITG and the list goes on through Wall Street.\n\nI believe the Bond scam employed by Sam Israel and Robert Booth Nichols is the same scheme that was run by Salomon Brothers and continues to be employed by Citadel, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley (among others). Co-ordinating to short 10 year treasury bonds to keep that money printer a going.\n\nThis is the Federal Reserve's \"Secret Market\".\n\nThank you for reading.\n\nTLDR:\n\nSam Israel III and Robert Booth Nichols were involved in an elaborate U.S Treasury bond trading scheme that continues to be employed by the largest banks and funds on Wall Street.\n\nFor Bayou Management (Israel's fund), this scheme involved shadow government organizations and extremely prominent individuals in government, finance, business + organized crime. Further research of the persons and events surrounding this bizarre crime uncovers evidence of CIA arms smuggling and money laundering operations tied to the Iran-Contra Scandal, Wackenhut Corp and private prison profiteering.\n\nIf I was you though, I would read the whole post.\n\nIf you made it this far, you might be interested in further research materials:\n\nBulk references for the wrinkle brains that like to look closer.
