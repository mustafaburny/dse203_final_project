        "selftext": "  \n\nFor those who have never heard of Netlist I am attempting to provide Due Diligence on what will be an explosive opportunity in my opinion and a look into a small company who has been fighting the Largest Bullies in the tech world for 12 years. Google tried to steal Netlist IP in 2009 and the CEO has taken them to task and refused to fold. He is a \"Diamond Hands\" CEO fighting Google, Samsung, SK Hynix(we just won that one in April), INPHI, and Micron. The story and DD continues below.\n\nIn 2009 Netlist allowed Google to see their patent that made memory run faster. If you remember, in 2009 Google was trying to establish itself against stiff competition in the search engine wars for dominance. Netlist had the key. Problem was Google didn't want to pay for it so after signing an NDA and seeing what it could do they promptly stole the IP and bootlegged it through China. Netlist noticed they were using it and filed suit. In court Google stated they did not use it so the Judge ordered a cross section of their servers examined. They were caught with the IP of Netlist in their servers. At that point Googles next move was to claim that it was not a valid patent and a stay was placed by the court while the patent was validated through the USPTO. Netlist beat Google at every stage and in June of 2020 the PTAB in a rule 36 unanimous decision found in Netlists favor. Google waived their right to appeal to SCOTUS and in February the 912 patent was reissued with 78 claims upheld. \n\nSince June 15th of last year Netlist who was formerly a NASDAQ listed company and is now OTCQB saw their share price grow from .195 cents to a high of 3 dollars and has been consolidating just over $2.00. The stay was lifted and the trial has resumed. The court has ordered a schedule and Amended Infringement Contentions were due Friday. Google is attempting to delay Discovery so this week Magistrate Spero in Northern District of Ca ordered a discovery conference with him on June 25th next Friday with a requirement that after the meeting the parties must confer and hash out the discovery process. If they cant agree they are required to submit to the court by June 30th each parties position.\n\nWillful infringement is subject to Treble damages by the court.\n\n   \n \n\nNetlist also has a breach of Contract suit against Samsung, Infringement suit against Micron, and INPHI. Every case is progressing nicely. We just keep winning.\n\nOn April 6 we Settled with SK Hynix. In that forward thinking agreement we locked up a supply agreement for 600 Million dollars, Received 40 million in cash up front, signed a collaboration agreement to develop our new Hybridimm product which is a jump on CXL market, and got totally free access to SK HYnix patent portfolio in a sharing agreement.\n\n   \n \n\nGoogle is the main case but reddit links below are for many ongoing case related documents. All of them are recent.\n\nBrokers have been offering shareholders up to 17. 5 % percent to shareholders to lend shares because longs know what we got and we are holding. MM's are manipulating this daily with the biggest being CDEL. They have to be exposed.\n\nOne other point is that Google has requested mediation after Intervening rights but they are fighting Discovery like the Devil is after them? IMO they will settle first.\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/NLST/comments/nxg9k5/jason\\_shelby\\_interrogatories/?utm\\_source=share&amp;utm\\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/NLST/comments/nxg9k5/jason_shelby_interrogatories/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/NLST/comments/o1a2xn/here\\_comes\\_the\\_judge\\_i\\_guess\\_we\\_know\\_why\\_google/?utm\\_source=share&amp;utm\\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/NLST/comments/o1a2xn/here_comes_the_judge_i_guess_we_know_why_google/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/NLST/comments/o23pn1/micron\\_proof\\_of\\_service\\_received\\_western\\_district/?utm\\_source=share&amp;utm\\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/NLST/comments/o23pn1/micron_proof_of_service_received_western_district/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/NLST/comments/o35qh5/samsung\\_just\\_filed\\_their\\_declaration\\_i\\_assume/?utm\\_source=share&amp;utm\\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/NLST/comments/o35qh5/samsung_just_filed_their_declaration_i_assume/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/NLST/comments/o360g7/declaration\\_by\\_kong\\_yong\\_lee\\_samsung\\_to/?utm\\_source=share&amp;utm\\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/NLST/comments/o360g7/declaration_by_kong_yong_lee_samsung_to/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)\n\n[http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/opinions-orders/19-1720.RULE\\_36\\_JUDGMENT.6-15-2020\\_1603464.pdf](http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/opinions-orders/19-1720.RULE_36_JUDGMENT.6-15-2020_1603464.pdf)\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/NLST/comments/lddc1q/patent\\_912\\_reexamination\\_certificate\\_issued/?utm\\_source=share&amp;utm\\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/NLST/comments/lddc1q/patent_912_reexamination_certificate_issued/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)",

I believe in their value or whatever.\n\nWould it not always be best to just sell slightly OTM weekly puts until it drops a tad and I get assigned? If I was going to purchase and hold at the current price anyways, then me getting assigned at a lower price with premium would be better than if I bought now. However, if it expires worthless, I just collect premium, but that is a pretty decent return because it was only a barely OTM put. Seems like an easy way to get a 4-5% discount on stocks if you were 100% committed to holding for years after purchase. Only downside would be if the stock rockets up in a week and never returns to that value, but that seems like a smaller risk I'd be willing to take. Am I missing something?",

        "selftext": "[https://investors.micron.com/events-and-presentations](https://investors.micron.com/events-and-presentations)\n\nin about 30 mins from now\n\nI have a small long position in micron. \n\nMay 25 - At JPMorgan Global Technology, Media, and Communications Conference, Micron announed it expects revenue for the quarter to be at or above the high end of the stated guidance range. This is SOP for Sanjay and nice to hear if you have been in Micron for a little while. \n\nJune 1 - announced volume production of DRAM using Node 1Alpha. This is 14nm but using DUV instead of EUV so its cheaper to make. Samsung and SK Hynix are using EUV for 14nm, but havent seen head to head comparisons yet. \n\nThesis - If this Node 1 alpha process is comparable to Samsung/SK Hynix 14nm stuff, it means higher margin for Micron. It means better guidance moving forward obviously as well. \n\nSamsung's former president is in jail which seems to be screwing their business up a bit. Has been steadily losing market share and margin to SK Hynix and Micron. \n\n(these are my opinions, no proof etc dont sue me)\n\n\"Semi conductors are cyclical\" - yeah but we are deep into tacit collusion now on pricing. We basically going to see \"short supply\" forever. The risk here is not in over supply but in an anti-trust/competition ruling. This is going to be incredibly difficult to find unless someone talks or leaves a smoking gun. These companies arent stupid. Its incredibly easy to enter into tacit collusion because its the reasonable and logical choice but its incredibly difficult to prove. Even if they do prove it, the disgorgement in profits still makes it +EV so it doesnt even matter that much. \n\nPeople are reading Microns reluctance to increase capex as an indication of no confidence in future demand. Thats not the way I see it. This is part of the tacit collusion. They basically get to tell their competitors \"hey, we are not increasing capex that much and you probably shouldnt either unless you wanna stop the gravy train\". \n\nLets extract from their last Q2 report. \" CY-21 DRAM industry bit demand growth of approximately 20%, with DRAM industry supply to be below demand; DRAM market is currently facing a severe undersupply, causing DRAM prices to increase rapidly ... CY-21 NAND industry bit demand growth in the low-to-mid 30% range, with NAND industry supply exceeding demand; more CapEx cuts are needed to allow for healthy NAND industry profitability...Long-term DRAM industry bit demand growth CAGR of mid-to-high teens\" \n\nfollowed by\n\n\" CY-21 DRAM &amp; NAND Micron bit supply growth expected to be below industry demand growth...Long-term DRAM &amp; NAND Micron bit supply growth CAGR in line with industry demand growth CAGR...Across DRAM &amp; NAND we target long-term cost reductions in line with industry\"\n\nMake of that what you will. Sure seems like a convenient way to say lets all make money together. At the same time its entirely logical and explainable. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThings I want to find out in the call:\n\n\\- Is micron doing R&amp;D into EUV for the next generation? Contracts lined up with ASML for EUV plant since ASML has a backlog? Might be super secret stuff but would be nice to know. \n\n\\- guidance for next quarter and next financial year (obviously). I think this is going to be higher than expected due to the Node 1 alpha mass production assuming it is decent. \n\n\\- Is Micron going to continue spending money on R&amp;D and poaching talent? Seems to be working so far imo. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy thoughts on price - we see a little pop because the high end of guidance is already priced in despite Sanjay always blowing earnings beyond his pre-announcements. Because thats priced in as well. However Micron sometimes sells off post earnings which is incredibly annoying so I dont think weeklies etc are good. Just buy the stock and hold it. \n\nHistoric PE rations etc are all crap here. We are in a new business model. Its not cyclical anymore.",

I also have some other ETFs including the QQQ, VTI, and SPY.\n\nTo me, my portfolio seems very tech/bio heavy - NVDA, GOOG, ADBE, U, XLK, ABBV, REGN. I also held short positions on QS and AI and recently bought to cover. I also held AMZN, SNOW, SQ, MU, CHWY, CVX, XOM, MRNA, TWLO, VUZI, and MKC, which I sold for a nice profit. I did buy 1000 shares of AMC at 10 and sold at 70, 1000 shares of CLOV at 13 and sold at 23, and GME at 50 and sold at 330 - possibly a bit unwise of me. I just sold my F at $16.\n\nI don't know whether I should get back into some of my previous holdings or buy some more of my current holdings? Also, what are the best ways to find good stocks? Are there any that should be on my radar? What stocks perform well and are pretty good buys? I am looking to diversify my portfolio a bit, it seems to tech heavy.\n\nThank you in advance!",

Its consumer products are marketed under the brands Crucial and Ballistix. Micron and Intel together created IM Flash Technologies, which produces NAND flash memory.\u00a0Their current market cap is\u00a0$88.97 billion.\n\nMicron remains firmly positioned in a memory market as more products require chips that are experiencing a shortage right now. Many see the company's situation as a big reason why you should be buying their shares.\u00a0The shortage could particularly benefit Micron in the DRAM memory market, where South Korean chipmakers Samsung and SK Hynix are its only competitors. DRAM made up about 68% of Micron's revenue in 2020. Additionally, the company claimed about 23% of the global DRAM market.\u00a0The NAND sector is a bit more diversified thanks to the presence of Western Digital and its SanDisk subsidiary. However,\u00a0Micron is one of the largest suppliers in this segment as well.\n\nMicron's earnings for the first quarter of 2021 showed little difference from what the analysts were expecting.\u00a0They reported earnings per share of $0.98, which is 3 cents more than the consensus estimate. They reported a slight beat of revenue estimates as well. Their Q1 2021 revenue came in at $6.24 billion compared to the estimated $6.23 billion.\u00a0Their next earnings report is scheduled for **Jun 30, 2021**.\n\nAnalysts from **Deutsche Bank**\u00a0estimate Micron's stock to reach\u00a0$110 in the next 12 months. The analysts at\u00a0**Wells Fargo**\u00a0also have high expectations for this stock with a price target of\u00a0$115. Out of 24\u00a0analysts, 18\u00a0have\u00a0given Micron a BUY rating and 6 a HOLD rating.",

        "selftext": "Which semiconductor companies will be most likely to receive funds after the bill is signed into law? Here are my thoughts and assumptions. Please correct any mistakes. Disclaimer: I own positions in Intel, Micron, and Applied Materials.\n\nMy understanding is that the bill is largely meant to support and consolidate semiconductor manufacturing and semi cap manufacturing in the U.S. Thus, U.S.-based companies with facilities in the U.S. that want to develop their semiconductor manufacturing capabilities in the U.S. will be the most likely to receive funding from this law as well as future support from the U.S. government which is aligned with rare bipartisanship to address and neutralize the threat of China\u2019s growing global technological dominance. Those companies will have a competitive advantage in the marketplace after receiving these funds, regardless of other fundamental or technical factors.\n\nHowever, the funds will come in the form of grants and tax credits. My understanding, and here's where I'm making big assumptions, is that companies must apply to receive the funds and that this is an involved and competitive process. The law won\u2019t be signed until toward the end of this year at the earliest. Then companies will apply for grants to fund projects to build fabs, improve supply chains, etc.\n\nINTC and MU seem like clear favorites to receive funds because they\u2019re U.S.-based IDMs with facilities primarily in the U.S., and they\u2019re often included in news stories related to the bill. TSM and Samsung are outside the U.S., though that doesn\u2019t mean they couldn\u2019t hypothetically receive funds to build a fab in the U.S. But if grants are competitive, then how likely would TSM or Samsung be to receive funds to build a new fab if they were competing with Intel or MU for the same funding, based purely on the intent of the law being to support U.S.-based semiconductor business?\n\nAMAT also seems like a favorite to receive funds even though ASML has a monopoly on the most advanced semi cap equipment. ASML is based in the Netherlands and only has two facilities in the U.S. Also, I speculate that AMAT could use funds from the law to put toward R&amp;D to compete with ASML, but my knowledge in that area is lacking.\n\nIt won\u2019t be until next year before companies can even start applying for funds. There probably won\u2019t be any winners for projects until at least a year from now.\n\nCatalysts:\n\n* Bill gets signed by the end of this year.\n* Companies submit applications for projects and winners are announced.\n* Winners start receiving funds and investing them in projects.\n\nThis isn't advice. I'm not a financial advisor.",

        "selftext": "Netlist vs Google 12 year Battle coming to an end and Billions at stake. For those who have never heard of Netlist I am attempting to provide Due Diligence on what will be an explosive opportunity in my opinion and a look into a small company who has been fighting the Largest Bullies in the tech world for 12 years. Google tried to steal Netlist IP in 2009 and the CEO has taken them to task and refused to fold. He is a \"Diamond Hands\" CEO fighting Google, Samsung, SK Hynix(we just won that one in April), INPHI, and Micron. The story and DD continues below. \n\nIn 2009 Netlist allowed Google to see their patent that made memory run faster. If you remember, in 2009 Google was trying to establish itself against stiff competition in the search engine wars for dominance. Netlist had the key. Problem was Google didn't want to pay for it so after signing an NDA and seeing what it could do they promptly stole the IP and bootlegged it through China. Netlist noticed they were using it and filed suit. In court Google stated they did not use it so the Judge ordered a cross section of their servers examined. They were caught with the IP of Netlist in their servers. At that point Googles next move was to claim that it was not a valid patent and a stay was placed by the court while the patent was validated through the USPTO. Netlist beat Google at every stage and in June of 2020 the PTAB in a rule 36 unanimous decision found in Netlists favor. Google waived their right to appeal to SCOTUS and in February the 912 patent was reissued with 78 claims upheld. \n\nSince June 15th of last year Netlist who was formerly a NASDAQ listed company and is now OTCQB saw their share price grow from .195 cents to a high of 3 dollars and has been consolidating just over $2.00. The stay was lifted and the trial has resumed. The court has ordered a schedule and Amended Infringement Contentions were due Friday. Google is attempting to delay Discovery so this week Magistrate Spero in Northern District of Ca ordereda discovery conference with him on June 25th next Friday with a requirement that after the meeting the parties must confer and hash out the discovery process. If they cant agree they are required to submit to the court by June 30th each parties position. \n\nWillful infringement is subject to Treble damages by the court. \n\nNetlist also has a breach of Contract suit against Samsung, Infringement suit against Micron, and INPHI. Every case is progressing nicely. We just keep winning. \n\nOn April 6 we Settled with SK Hynix. In that forward thinking agreement we locked up a supply agreement for 600 Million dollars, Received 40 million in cash up front, signed a collaboration agreement to develop our new Hybridimm product which is a jump on CXL market, and got totally free access to SK HYnix patent portfolio in a sharing agreement. \n\nGoogle is the main case but reddit links below are for many ongoing case related documents. All of them are recent. \n\nBrokers have been offering shareholders up to 17. 5 % percent to shareholders to lend shares because longs know what we got and we are holding. MM's are manipulating this daily with the biggest being CDEL. They have to be exposed. \n\nOne other point is that Google has requested mediation after Intervening rights but they are fighting Discovery like the Devil is after them? IMO they will settle first.",

Google waived their right to appeal to SCOTUS and in February the 912 patent was reissued with 78 claims upheld. \n\nSince June 15th of last year Netlist who was formerly a NASDAQ listed company and is now OTCQB saw their share price grow from .195 cents to a high of 3 dollars and has been consolidating just over $2.00. The stay was lifted and the trial has resumed. The court has ordered a schedule and Amended Infringement Contentions were due Friday. Google is attempting to delay Discovery so this week Magistrate Spero in Northern District of Ca ordereda discovery conference with him on June 25th next Friday with a requirement that after the meeting the parties must confer and hash out the discovery process. If they cant agree they are required to submit to the court by June 30th each parties position. \n\nWillful infringement is subject to Treble damages by the court. \n\nNetlist also has a breach of Contract suit against Samsung, Infringement suit against Micron, and INPHI. Every case is progressing nicely. We just keep winning. \n\nOn April 6 we Settled with SK Hynix. In that forward thinking agreement we locked up a supply agreement for 600 Million dollars, Received 40 million in cash up front, signed a collaboration agreement to develop our new Hybridimm product which is a jump on CXL market, and got totally free access to SK HYnix patent portfolio in a sharing agreement. \n\nGoogle is the main case but reddit links below are for many ongoing case related documents. All of them are recent. \n\nBrokers have been offering shareholders up to 17. 5 % percent to shareholders to lend shares because longs know what we got and we are holding. MM's are manipulating this daily with the biggest being CDEL. They have to be exposed. \n\nOne other point is that Google has requested mediation after Intervening rights but they are fighting Discovery like the Devil is after them? IMO they will settle first.",

        "selftext": "Hi, My sweet little angels. \n\nHope you are well.\n\nWe need to talk about Tesla.\n\nWe don\u2019t need to talk about the fundamentals. We don\u2019t need to talk about the EV Market. We don\u2019t need to talk about scamc0ins. We don\u2019t need to talk about the God Meme of Elon Musk. All we need to talk about is the stock price attached to that beautiful T-S-L-A. \n\nWhen people tell you that TSLA is a bubble usually your reaction is \u201cNo shit, baby tits.\u201d Or \u201cBuy the dip, fuckface, Elon\u2019s sending his cum to mars.\u201d  All, fine, fuck it, whatever, but what if I told you that TSLA is guaranteed to go down?\n\nLet\u2019s start with the biggest run of a muthafuck this decade. TSLA crashes covid style like all of our favorite tech homies, then rises 700% through the rest of the year peaking at almost $900/ share. Why the fuck would any stock rise 700%? Why?\n\nTwo words. GAMMA SQUEEZE.\n\nIf you don\u2019t know what a gamma squeeze is then you should go back to fucking sleep because it\u2019s the only thing pushing up these beautiful companies all year. GME? Gamma Squeeze. RKT? Gamma Squeeze. AMC? Gamma Squeeze. \n\nTLDR Gamma Squeeze; MM/ Institutions work on a hedging system. They sell your dumbass some OTM FD\u2019s for pennies in return for pennies in profit, but if those OTM\u2019s become ITM\u2019s then our MM need to be hedged to deliver your ass some shares in case you exercise that shit. They do this by staying delta neutral and buying up shares in case your calls go in the money. The more calls that arrive in the money, the more shares they buy to stay hedged, the more calls in the money, the more people jump in to make money, the more calls that go in the money, the more shares that are hedged. Endless Feedback Loop. I don\u2019t know the math and I don\u2019t know how, but the last two years have shown that equity can move like a rocket due to this shit. \n\nTSLA gamma squeezed itself til it cummed rockets last year. Everybody made fucking money. That ride doesn\u2019t last forever though and in 2021, we had a very special guy start talking a lot of shit.\n\nMichael Burry talks a lot of shit on TSLA. Grab a bowl of popcorn and read through his archived twitter posts.\n\n[https://twitter.com/burryarchive?lang=en](https://twitter.com/burryarchive?lang=en)\n\nWhy? Probably because he\u2019s a boomer who doesn\u2019t know that the world is leaving his old ass behind. He actually thinks Ford and VW have a chance at getting their knobs slobbed on the way these Tesla Bros do. What a nerd + Idiot.\n\n**OR**\n\nMichael Burry sees one of the greatest trades this year. He sees the opportunity for a gamma squeeze back down.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ich0c602ar371.png?width=403&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c8953793838a7735b5d7264259af02fa991a4371\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/avwkcew3ar371.png?width=627&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=14a6c9fb4c51020f616bb3a891e82cadff6d79f2\n\nCall premiums have become expensive and shorting this shit is deadly, but puts have become cheap. Enough puts and this big ball of gains could unwind pretty fucking quick. Those puts are already there. \n\n**Reverse Gamma Squeeze**\n\nMM and Institutions hedge puts like they do calls, except they sell shares or short shares in order to be delta neutral. The feedback loops are the same. FD OTM puts go ITM, MM sell to hedge causing more OTM puts to go ITM, MM sell to hedge, this causes hodlers to panic sell, more otm go itm. Endless feedback loop. Pretty fucking clear picture here, but what gets this ball rolling? First some of the current hedges need to be unwound. That starts happening on June 18th \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3wtcdte8ar371.png?width=628&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=137814c1e8fde342b39f118a2f5b8d7bd3caf127\n\nOver 1 million put/call contracts expiring. We are talking about deeeeeeep itm calls vanishing or being exercised. If they are exercised, then nothing changes. But if they are sold back to the MM which most probably will be, then those hedges will need to be unwound as they won\u2019t be needed anymore. This unwinding is going to cause the stock to slide massively as those hedges are sold and TSLA slides into those OTM puts expiring in September, January \u201822, March \u201922, and June \u201922. We are looking at 300K to 700K OTM and ITM puts for each one of those quarterly dates. PUT HEDGE Feedback loop. This is all due to the gamma squeezes in 2020. People bought wild OTM calls and they are all hedged for while leaving waaayyy more OTM puts sitting there to be discovered. Once OTM money puts hit the money, then we see our Reverse Gamma Squeeze. Check the OI on each of these expirations.\n\nSeptember of this year:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3kfyrav9ar371.png?width=628&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=409f8529930a66a0a27c8b78e2daa03a02e10667\n\nJanuary \u201922:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3jnf17ebar371.png?width=628&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=43fff1c1b385c7673569dd80efd58827e7c45cd2\n\nMarch \u201922:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c9pqekxcar371.png?width=628&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8be906ad3bf4e81c1ce476ce57ea0454f16017fe\n\nJune \u201922:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wfipdzrear371.png?width=628&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7dae6535d3f637ad146d225b2c5965c3cd448dbf\n\nThe OI numbers here are truly incredible,.  I\u2019ve compared this numbers to Ford, Apple, MU, GME, and other Nasdaq fam. It\u2019s incomparable. \n\n**How can Tesla be saved from this??**\n\nMoney \u2013 Tesla needs to get the fuck away from those OTM puts at least until June of next year. The only way this is accomplished is if they receive massive purchases along with massive call option buying to produce the squeeze effects they received last year. This is asking a lot as liquidity in the market often runs dry and everyone who is in it for the long haul already dropped all their cash in. I think they need a fucking miracle, personally.\n\n**How Fast does this go and how far down does it drop?**\n\nThis could happen slow af or this could happen fast af\u2026.especially if institutions hop in like they did with AMC and GME to drag this thing back to hell with dollar signs in their eyes. There\u2019s already some hints of the flow turning predatory if ya\u2019ll notice those high volume $1P - $50P open for 50k to 100k contracts.\n\n**Could I be wrong?**\n\nYes, but that\u2019s exactly why I\u2019m posting this. I need you to figure it out and tell me so I don\u2019t lose my ass putting the house on Elon sucking dick for double bubble in the coming years. I'm open to all data, suggestions, counter points, and clarity. \n\nI\u2019ll leave you this quote from one of our many gods.\n\n\"$TSLA below $100/share by later this year will not crash the system. There is no reflexivity in such a fall\u201d\n\n\\- Michael Burry\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR TSLA Earth Bound",

        "selftext": "Netlist vs Google 12 year Battle coming to an end and Billions at stake. For those who have never heard of Netlist I am attempting to provide Due Diligence on what will be an explosive opportunity in my opinion and a look into a small company who has been fighting the Largest Bullies in the tech world for 12 years. Google tried to steal Netlist IP in 2009 and the CEO has taken them to task and refused to fold. He is a \"Diamond Hands\" CEO fighting Google, Samsung, SK Hynix(we just won that one in April), INPHI, and Micron. The story and DD continues below. \n\nIn 2009 Netlist allowed Google to see their patent that made memory run faster. If you remember, in 2009 Google was trying to establish itself against stiff competition in the search engine wars for dominance. Netlist had the key. Problem was Google didn't want to pay for it so after signing an NDA and seeing what it could do they promptly stole the IP and bootlegged it through China. Netlist noticed they were using it and filed suit. In court Google stated they did not use it so the Judge ordered a cross section of their servers examined. They were caught with the IP of Netlist in their servers. At that point Googles next move was to claim that it was not a valid patent and a stay was placed by the court while the patent was validated through the USPTO. Netlist beat Google at every stage and in June of 2020 the PTAB in a rule 36 unanimous decision found in Netlists favor. Google waived their right to appeal to SCOTUS and in February the 912 patent was reissued with 78 claims upheld. \n\nSince June 15th of last year Netlist who was formerly a NASDAQ listed company and is now OTCQB saw their share price grow from .195 cents to a high of 3 dollars and has been consolidating just over $2.00. The stay was lifted and the trial has resumed. The court has ordered a schedule and Amended Infringement Contentions were due Friday. Google is attempting to delay Discovery so this week Magistrate Spero in Northern District of Ca ordereda discovery conference with him on June 25th next Friday with a requirement that after the meeting the parties must confer and hash out the discovery process. If they cant agree they are required to submit to the court by June 30th each parties position. \n\nWillful infringement is subject to Treble damages by the court. \n\nNetlist also has a breach of Contract suit against Samsung, Infringement suit against Micron, and INPHI. Every case is progressing nicely. We just keep winning. \n\nOn April 6 we Settled with SK Hynix. In that forward thinking agreement we locked up a supply agreement for 600 Million dollars, Received 40 million in cash up front, signed a collaboration agreement to develop our new Hybridimm product which is a jump on CXL market, and got totally free access to SK HYnix patent portfolio in a sharing agreement. \n\nGoogle is the main case but reddit links below are for many ongoing case related documents. All of them are recent. \n\nBrokers have been offering shareholders up to 17. 5 % percent to shareholders to lend shares because longs know what we got and we are holding. MM's are manipulating this daily with the biggest being CDEL. They have to be exposed. \n\nOne other point is that Google has requested mediation after Intervening rights but they are fighting Discovery like the Devil is after them? IMO they will settle first",
