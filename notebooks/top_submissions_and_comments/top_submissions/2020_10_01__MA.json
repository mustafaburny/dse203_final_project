        "selftext": "Hi all, \n\nI have been looking to diversify out of tech. ETFs make up 50% of my portfolio with SPY making up about 40% of it. I also have 10% in QQQ. Of my individual stocks, tech makes up about 60%. I currently have non-tech holdings in Disney, KO, ICLN, BABA, a small portion in NIO and SNE. I know SNE is tech but it does not move with the sector much and I really like this position. Any thoughts on good buys. I was really interested in BA but wanted to wait to see what happened after sept 15th and that wasn't great. Great buy but will take years so I am watching for now. Some others I have been following are V/MA, FDX (although getting pricey), J&amp;J and CVS. Another reasonable option I have been considering is putting more money into SPY and also ICLN to a lesser extent. Appreciate any input or other ideas. Thanks!",

        "selftext": "There's a huge amount of people in Crypto who think that Buy&amp;Hold is the best strategy. That might be true (especially when effort vs results are considered) for more mature markets, but I felt that in Crypto, simple Trend Following should be able to catch the bulk of the big moves and avoid most of the bear markets, so I ran some tests.\n\n# Strategies\n\nI picked some of the most basic Trend Following strategies with reasonable/round parameters:\n\n* **MA Crossover** (*rx\\_xma*)\u2014 when fast MA crosses over slow MA, go long. I will also use several different MAs for this \u2014 EMA, LRC (LinReg), HMA, WMA, KAMA, SuperSmoother, WVMA, TEMA, ZLEMA. `Parameters used: fast MA = 5d, slow MA = 40d`\n* **Supertrend** (*SupertrendXm*) \u2014 uses ATR to get band width, goes long if price over the band. `Parameters used: ATR period = 5d, band multiplier = 1.5/2/2.5`\n* **Bollinger Bands Breakout** (*rx\\_bb\\_bout*) \u2014 goes long when price over upper band. `Parameters used: BB period = 3d/5d, BB stddev = 2, MA = EMA/LRC/SuperSmoother`\n* **High/Low Breakout** (*hilo*) \u2014 goes long when price over previous X days high. Close position when under X days low. `Parameters used: period = 5d/10d`\n* **Linear Regression Slope** (*expreg\\_slope*) \u2014 goes long when slope of regression &gt; 0. `Parameters used: reg period = 5d/10d/15d`\n* **Single MA/Price Crossover** (*rx\\_xma\\_single*) \u2014 goes long when price crosses over MA. Same MAs as *rx\\_xma* will be used (EMA, LRC, etc). `Parameters used: reg period = 30d`\n* **Single MA Slope** (*rx\\_xma\\_slope*) \u2014 goes long when slope of MA &gt; 0. Same MAs as *rx\\_xma* will be used. `Parameters used: MA period = 20d, slope period = 1d`\n\n# Testing setup\n\n* Long only.\n* 0.10% commission.\n* Simple condition for entry (long), reverse for exit (close).\n* No stoplosses or take profits.\n* Use 100% of balance on each trade (will add position sizing in next post).\n* 60m candle size, except for *Supertrend* (1d to get daily ATR).\n\n# Coins and date ranges used\n\nI will use 25 of the \\~TOP50 coins and 3 different date ranges. Specific coins for each date range depend on data availability. Some will use partial range data (starting later), specified in parentheses.\n\n**Jan 2017 \u2014 July 2020**  \nCoins used: XBT, ETH, XRP (since May 18, 2017), LTC, BCH (since Aug 1, 2017), XMR, DASH (Apr 12, 2017), ETC, ZEC, GNO (since May 1, 2017), IOT (since Jun 12, 2017), REP\n\n**Jan 2018 \u2014 July 2020**  \nCoins used: all of the above + BNB, EOS, XLM, ADA, TRX, NEO, OMG\n\n**Jan 2019 \u2014 July 2020**  \nCoins used: all of the above + BSV, XTZ, LINK, ONT, QTUM, QSH\n\n# Results\n\nHere are the results, AVG profits over all tested assets.\n\n* [Jan2019 - Jul2020](https://i.postimg.cc/QCkJBGSK/1-med10-profit-Jan2019-Jul2020-2020-08-24-13-24.png)\n* [Jan2018 - Jul2020](https://i.postimg.cc/xT6LBPZQ/4-med10-profit-Jan2018-Jul2020-2020-08-24-13-31.png)\n* [Jan2017 - Jul2020](https://i.postimg.cc/3x6mxx7b/6-med10-profit-Jan2017-Jul2020-2020-08-24-13-36.png)\n\n# Conclusion\n\n* Charts seem pretty conclusive to me: Trend Following &gt; Buy&amp;Hold.\n* **You won't beat Buy&amp;Hold like this on each and every asset that you test or trade live. But, over multiple assets, chances are you will on average.**\n* Trade frequency is a bit low (0.5 - 2 per week).\n* Max drawdowns are still pretty big (60 - 80%). Need some filters, stoplosses and position/risk management.\n* **While it's highly unlikely to beat pure isolated BULL market (like 2017) with basic Trend Following, over longer periods with multiple big swings, strategies catch bulk of the moves and come out ahead.**",

PayPal is currently sitting around $15 below its ATH. There is probably no need to explain what PayPal is or what it does.\n\nTotal Payment Volume (TPV)\n\n\"Total  Payment Volume or \"TPV\" is the value of payments, net of payment  reversals, successfully completed through our Payments Platform,  excluding transactions processed through our gateway products.\"\n\n\\--&gt; *Fees on money transactions*\n\nThat means that PayPal makes more money when more transactions are being made.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n1iw3tt13dr51.png?width=554&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0c5711eda5ad1f0422692e74985c16820a43f0fe\n\n**Free Cashflow (FCF)**\n\n$2.19B in Q2 with an increase 112% y/y\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2tr61wt23dr51.png?width=550&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1f3f312a637670c54ebbd70fb223f49b60e5d4fc\n\n\\--&gt;  Now you are probably asking yourself what all those fucking images and  words mean. It\u00b4s simple. PayPal has seen a lot of new users due to the  pandemic and everyone ordering their shit from Jeff Bezos. We are still  in a pandemic and the second wave is about to come. This means that more  and more people are going to use services like PayPal and as I stated  above; more users means more transactions which means more money for PayPal. So more tendies for us.

TPV will rise due to more and more people using PayPal due to the Pandemic. This will lead the FCF to rise as well and this makes stonks go up for us to make some tendies.\n\n**New Customers**\n\nPayPal has seen a rise in new accounts of 21.3 million in Q2.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6xkjfind3dr51.png?width=414&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c1c34c732b58eb2c3daa5581dffaa5d0a5ba565b\n\n**So how are we making tendies on the upcoming earnings?**\n\nPayPal is expecting \"strong momentum from Q2 to continue into Q3\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1slqhmre3dr51.png?width=478&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c9fa90bc61c64cebfb38f1b4d565bd4ab7172632\n\n*They will be crushing earnings* [*again*](https://i.imgur.com/iBhZqrE.png) *like they did in Q2 (actual Growth: 22% and 25%)*\n\nAnalysts have set a *price target around $220.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img n0vw56pf3dr51...*\n\n**Recent News**\n\n\"PayPal and Mastercard will continue the global expansion of its PayPal Business Debit Mastercard.\" [Source](https://www.mobilepaymentstoday.com/news/paypal-business-debit-mastercard-expands-european-market-reach/)\n\nThey also announced to support black communities and businesses.

Rona Canadian customers will now have the option to purchase ToughBuilt products while they shop online at [www.rona.ca](http://www.rona.ca/).\n\nMichael Panosian , Chief Executive Officer of ToughBuilt, commented, \u201cWe are pleased to announce this new cooperation with Rona and look forward to adding more new items in fourth quarter. Rona\u2019s great distribution throughout  Canada  allows us to expand our brand awareness and increase our market share in this growing market.

The deal closed this week. Shares plummeted 24.5% to close at  $18.69  on Wednesday, the stock's first day of trading under its new symbol, VLDR. Investors might have overreacted. Baird analyst Tristan Gerra launched coverage of the company Thursday, rating shares the equivalent of Buy. His target for the stock price is $28, about 50% higher than recent trading levels.\n\nLidar is, essentially, laser-based radar and part of the suite of sensors auto makers use to achieve advanced safety features, as well as create self- driving cars. Gerra expects sales to grow 55% a year on average for the next four years, hitting  $684 million  by 2024. Velodyne Lidar is well positioned to maintain its position as the volume and cost leader --  $100  announced \\[selling prices\\] -- as the company continues to optimize performance and costs along with its proprietary manufacturing,\" wrote Gerra in a Wednesday evening report beginning coverage of the stock. Lidar is expensive. And driving down sensor costs is key to adoption. \" Lidars will become an integral part of autonomous vehicles' sensor systems, owing to camera limitations,\" he said. Cameras can't function in all conditions.\n\nVelodyne says it has more than 300 customers, including auto makers. Gerra writes the company has engaged with Tesla (TSLA). Gerra is the only analyst covering Velodyne at the moment. The average stock in the Dow Jones Industrial Average has about 30 analysts.\n\nDespite the relative lack of coverage, Velodyne isn't small. Its market capitalization, based on the pro-forma total of shares outstanding post merger, is about  $3.3 billion . At the stock's recent high, the market value was more than $5.5 billion.\n\nHidden opportunity here. This stock took one hell of a slide downward during the month of September after the deal with GRAF closed, with a high of $32.75/share and now just trading at $17. Things I like about this company:\n\n* Product that solves an issue and is necessary (autonomous safety)\n* Engaged with big name customers (including Tesla)\n* Under most people\u2019s radar\n* 50% fall in one month is a clear overreaction \n* Merger implies later catalysts\n\nLong $VLDR\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Rough September](https://preview.redd.it/t75p7rh4r9r51.png?width=1608&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0b79facf1a9249fe39d834ae22e5b8f91744888e)\n\n**Never forget to do your own DD; remember: For all you know, all the stocks that I mention here will dip 90% tomorrow; Do your own DD, I'm not some magic fairy. Trading will never come this easy to you. If all the stocks on here went up, I'd be chilling on my own Island.**",

As it rounded at the bottom (bullish) I didnt jump out the window thinking oh this is the bottom. That's incorrect way to execute this winning strategy. Even tho it's a cheaper price. The probability of it reversing is only slightly greater with just one point of confluence. It started to curl up and broke above the neckline(resistance of a specified trend pattern) and came back to it to test as support at 1.20. second point of confluence. Bought in anticipation of high probability of it continuing up after. It continues to give confirmation. Golden crossover 4hr third point of confluence. Inverted H&amp;S playing out 4hr fourth point of confluence. Ema/Ma fanning 4hr fifth point of confluence. Bullish pin bar 4hr sixth point of confluence. Shall I continue?

        "selftext": " **FAANGs, retail led market gainers while energy continued recent declines:**\n\n* **Consumer discretionary** was the best sector with department stores, apparel and AMZN-US among gainers. BBB-US rose sharply following earnings beat. **Communication services** were supported by FAANGS strength. **Tech** finished ahead with semis and software among the best segments. **Consumer staples** were in line as big box, grocers and cosmetics gained though drug stores were lower and foods mixed. **Financials** lagged with custody banks and P/C insurers lower. **Industrials** were behind with machinery and multis lower though airlines stronger. **Healthcare** was lower on hospital and large cap pharma declines and mixed performance in med tech. **Materials** were off with non-ferrous metals (copper prices down sharply), global miners and chemicals showing some weakness. **Energy** was broadly lower with all sectors down sharply.\n\n**White House boosts fiscal stimulus offer to $1.6T:**\n\n* [Roll Call](https://www.rollcall.com/2020/09/30/exclusive-mnuchin-coronavirus-relief-plan-includes-more-state-local-funds/) reported that in recent negotiations with House Speaker Pelosi about a fifth coronavirus relief bill, Treasury Secretary Mnuchin raised the White House's offer to just over $1.6T. This is up from an original proposal of $1T though Mnuchin has previously expressed a willingness to go up to $1.5T. The new offer includes $250B in funding for state and local governments, up from $100B, but below the nearly $400B+ sought by Democrats in their latest proposal. It also features $400 a week of additional unemployment benefits, up from their prior $300 a week offer but still below the $600 sought by Democrats. Talks expected to continue today and despite the favorable market reaction, still skepticism there will be enough additional movement to get something done. [Politico](https://www.politico.com/playbook) discussed how Senate Republicans present another big obstacle, even if Trump prods them to do a deal.\n\n**ISM manufacturing index lost a little strength in September:**\n\n* **ISM Manufacturing Index** for September of 55.4 missed 56.3 estimate, down from prior month 56. New orders index down 7.4 at 60.2, production index down 2.3 at 61, employment index up 3.2 at 49.6, new export orders index up 1 at 54.3. The report indicated expansion in the economy for the fifth month since contraction in April with manufacturers becoming better at maintaining output in reconfigured factories. Elsewhere, September **IHS Markit final manufacturing PMI** of 53.2 slightly lower than flash 53.5 and above 53.1 in August. New orders upticked while output (fastest in ten months) and employment (second fastest since Nov-19) growth increased sharply. August **construction spending** of 1.4% m/m beat consensus and prior reading of 0.7%.\n\n**Initial jobless claims and August personal consumption better:**\n\n* Weekly **initial jobless claims** at 837K in the week ending 26-Sep, versus consensus of 850K and below prior week reading of 873K (revised up 3k). Largest increases in NY, GA, MA, NJ; largest decreases in MA, MI. Four-week average was 867K, down 12K from last week. **Continuing claims** for the week ending 19-Sep were lower at 11.767M vs consensus 12.275M and prior week's 12.747M (revised up by 167K). Elsewhere, August monthly **personal consumption expenditures** of +1.0% m/m, above consensus 0.7% following July's 1.5% gain (revised down 0.4%); **personal income** fell 2.7% m/m versus expected -2.5% and July's +0.5% (revised up 0.1%) as federal unemployment benefits rolled off. **Core** **pce deflator** of 0.3% m/m (0.33% unrounded) met consensus though July revised up a tick to 0.4%. On a y/y basis, the inflation measure was 1.6%, two tenths above expected and prior reading.\n\n**Corporate layoffs raise more concerns about protracted crisis:**\n\n* [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-09-30/disney-shell-cuts-mark-warning-sign-for-global-economic-rebound?sref=L75TRUmI) discussed how the tens of thousands of job cuts announced by blue-chip companies in a 24-hour span is a warning sign for the global economic recovery. Recent layoff announcements have come from Disney (DIS-US ), Goldman Sachs (GS-US ), Allstate (ALL-US ), Marathon Petroleum (MPC-US ), Royal Dutch Shell (RDS-GB ), Elanco (ELAN-US ), and the airlines. The article highlighted concerns that job losses have begun to spill over the from the service sector that initially suffered the brunt of the layoffs from the coronavirus pandemic with more companies now looking to protect margins. Cost-cutting has been a key component of the earnings resilience theme. Back in late August, a [WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/new-covid-19-layoffs-make-job-reductions-permanent-11598654257) article flagged concerns that a wave of corporate layoffs could be permanent as companies increasingly see the coronavirus pandemic as the driver of a more protracted economic downturn\n\n**Auto sector remains a recovery bright spot:**\n\n* [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-autos-sales/u-s-auto-sales-stay-on-recovery-path-despite-tight-inventory-idUSKBN26M4XB) and [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-10-01/fiat-chrysler-toyota-beat-3q-forecasts-auto-sales-update?sref=L75TRUmI) both discussed the recovery in the auto market over the course of Q3. General Motors (GM-US ), Fiat Chrysler (FCAU-US ) and Toyota (TM-US ) all reported better than expected results. GM also mentioned that sales improved sequentially each month within Q3 and that both industry and GM sales rebounded significantly in October, finishing the month with y/y sales increases. The articles highlighted strong consumer demand for SUVs, trucks and hybrids. These groups were longstanding outperformers before the coronavirus pandemic as well. Demand underpinned by a combination of broader economic recovery and low rates. A number of other companies with leverage to autos have also highlighted the sector recovery in their recent updates. These include dealers, semis and electronics.\n\n**Fed extends dividend and buyback restrictions on banks:**\n\n* Fed [announced ](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20200930b.htm)Wednesday after the close that none of the 33 banks with more than $100B of assets would be allowed to resume share repurchases in Q4 and that it would also maintain a cap on dividend payments. Fed said move intended to ensure the banks maintain a high level of capital resilience. Added that the capital positions of the big banks have remained strong during Q3 while such restrictions were in place. Move was widely expected by the Street. A number of banks that presented at the Barclays Global Financial Services Conference last month expressed an interest in resuming buyback activity as soon as possible. Capital return uncertainty has been an overhang on the group. The other big headwind has been lower NII guidance from softer loan demand and an uptick in repayments. However, banks have been more upbeat on asset quality.\n\n**Senate panel votes to subpoena tech executives:**\n\n* [The Hill](https://thehill.com/policy/technology/519101-senate-panel-votes-to-subpoena-big-tech-executives) noted that the Senate Commerce Committee voted Thursday to subpoena the CEOs of Twitter (TWTR-US ), Google (GOOGL-US ) and Facebook (FB-US ). The vote compels the CEOs to testify at a hearing on Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act that will discuss social media's alleged conservative bias. The move was previewed last week. DOJ has already recommended that Congress pare back Section 230 laws, which give sites broad immunity from lawsuits for words, images, and videos. Back in May, President Trump signed an executive order to limit protections for online platforms. [Axios](https://www.axios.com/congress-looks-to-squeeze-big-tech-ahead-of-election-8deb407a-8e2a-4989-9682-dade915583a8.html) recently discussed how it's nearly certain that neither a Section 230 reform bill from the Senate nor the antitrust legislation that could come out of the House will pass anytime soon. Market has also tended to ignore the continued pickup in regulatory scrutiny in favor of secular growth and disruption themes.\n\n**Mixed vaccine headlines:**\n\n* [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-09-30/oxford-astra-covid-vaccine-review-said-to-start-in-europe?srnd=premium-asia&amp;sref=L75TRUmI) reported European regulators set to announce an accelerated review of the coronavirus candidate from AstraZeneca (AZN-US ) and the University of Oxford. This will allow them to see trial data while the study is ongoing and potentially speed up the approval process. However, [Reuters](https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-health-coronavirus-vaccine-astrazenec/exclusive-fda-widens-u-s-safety-inquiry-into-astrazeneca-coronavirus-vaccine-sources-idUKKBN26L3T8) reported the FDA has broadened its investigation of a serious illness in the AstraZeneca trial and will look at data from earlier trials developed by the same scientists. Noted this raises likelihood of further delays for what has been one of the most advanced vaccine candidates. CEO of Moderna (MRNA-US ) told the [FT](https://www.ft.com/content/9b242ecc-3dce-4534-9171-cdf624468a2a) that his company would not be able to apply to the FDA for emergency use authorization of its coronavirus vaccine until at least late November. Added that he did not expect to have full approval for broad distribution until next spring. Timelines more in line with those of public health officials than Trump.",

        "selftext": "Summarized to save you time.\n\n**Still chatter about a broader stimulus bill, but even airline-only deal could be tough:**\n\n* [Politico](https://twitter.com/JakeSherman/status/1314208911654678530) said Treasury Secretary Mnuchin floated possibility of restarting broader stimulus talks in call with Speaker Pelosi last night. Then Trump told [Fox Business](https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/pelosi-stimulus-checks-donald-trump-1200) this morning \"a bigger deal\" involving $1,200 stimulus checks was possible. Comments come after Trump talked about halting negotiations only to suggest yesterday he wanted Congress to pass funding for airlines, PPP and another round of stimulus checks. However, prospects for any deal remain dim, especially as Pelosi castigated Trump today for walking away from necessary relief. Some resistance within the GOP for more spending on stimulus, and Senate Majority Leader McConnell likely reluctant to bring up any measure his caucus is uncertain to back. Note GOP Sens. Toomey and Lee released a [statement](https://www.toomey.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/toomey-and-lee-issue-statement-regarding-an-additional-round-of-taxpayer-funded-grants-for-airlines) saying Congress should not make targeted grants to airlines. Other hurdles include Congress being out of session, focus on upcoming SCOTUS hearings, and short calendar before Election Day.\n\n**Pence and Harris square off in vice presidential debate:**\n\n* VP Pence and Democratic candidate Kamala Harris debated in Salt Lake City on Wednesday ([WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/trumps-covid-19-diagnosis-amps-up-spotlight-on-vice-presidential-debate-11602084013)). Pence defended administration's pandemic handling while touting strong economic stewardship and renegotiated trade deals. Harris zeroed in on Trump's poor management of the coronavirus. Harris demurred when asked whether Biden would push to add more justices to the Supreme Court. Also skirted question on presidential succession if her running mate becomes incapacitated. When pressed Harris said Biden would not ban fracking (though Harris said in 2019 said she would ban the practice). Meanwhile, Pence dodged a question about how Trump would protect pre-existing conditions if Affordable Care Act is struck down by Supreme Court. Debate was more civil than the Trump-Biden confrontation last week. Trump and Biden to debate again on 15-Oct. Organizers said debate now scheduled to be virtual, though Trump said that is not acceptable.\n\n**Continuing jobless claims fell significantly while initial claims in line:**\n\n* Weekly **initial jobless claims** at 840K in the week ending 3-Oct, versus consensus of 837K and prior week's reading 849k (revised up 12k). Largest increases in MA, IL, NJ; largest decreases in TX, FL, GA. Four-week average was 857K, down 13K from last week. **Continuing claims** for the week ending 26-Sep were well lower at 10.976M vs consensus 11.500M and prior week's 11.979M (revised up by 212K). Individuals filing initial claims in the federal **Pandemic Unemployment Assistance** program for week ending 3-Oct fell to 464K from 509K in prior week. Persons claiming benefits in **all programs** for week ending 19-Sep declined to 25.505M from 26.509M in the prior week.\n\n**Trump credits Regeneron's antibody cocktail for his recovery from coronavirus:**\n\n* In a [video](https://www.twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1313959702104023047), President Trump talked up Regeneron's (REGN-US ) experimental monoclonal antibody cocktail, saying it was \"key\" to his recovery from coronavirus ([Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-10-07/trump-hails-antibody-treatment-wants-all-patients-to-have-it?srnd=politics-vp&amp;sref=J9GPLx1B)). Added that he is working on getting the treatment authorized and that it should be made free to Americans. REGN said presence of antibodies in Trump's blood could be result of its treatment, and it will seek EUA ([Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-10-08/regeneron-seeks-fda-emergency-clearance-for-covid-19-treatment?srnd=premium-asia&amp;sref=J9GPLx1B)). Trump mentioned Eli Lilly (LLY-US ), which has also requested EUA of its experimental antibody-based treatment ([WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/eli-lilly-asks-fda-to-authorize-covid-19-antibody-drug-11602074998?mod=hp_lead_pos4)). Trump's physician, Sean Conley, noted detectable levels of coronavirus antibodies were found in Monday's blood sample that weren't detected on Thursday. In his video, Trump also said vaccines should be approved before election. He again faulted for China for the virus and said Beijing would pay a big price.\n\n**Bond market impact of a Blue Wave scenario under increasing scrutiny:**\n\n* [FT](https://www.ft.com/content/6369516f-d4d1-4a31-817c-417585b0c24a) said that investors are increasingly focusing on the risk of a decline in long-term US government bond prices in anticipation of a more robust economic recovery and hefty additional government spending after November's presidential election. Noted long-dated Treasury yields have risen sharply since the start of the month to highest levels since June, while some fund managers warn this may be the start of a sharper selloff in US debt, though magnitude of a move depends on results of elections. Article cited Goldman Sachs strategists said investors could pull forward expectations for US rate rises on stimulus and vaccine developments, while Morgan Stanley strategists described a \"rates scare\" of a sudden move higher in yields that could take market by surprise. However, some strategists said the Fed would show little tolerance for destabilizing increase in rates that upends efforts to support the economy.\n\n**Fed unlikely to change QE strategy, at least for now:**\n\n* [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-fed-evans/fed-has-capacity-to-amp-up-bond-buying-but-no-need-now-evans-says-idUSKBN26S3K4?il=0) reported that Fed officials said the bank could ramp up its bond purchasing program or weight its purchases at the long end of the curve to push down further on borrowing costs. However, officials including Chicago's Evans (voter) said any changes are unlikely to happen in the short-term, with Evans saying it would be the Spring until he has a better sense of whether the Fed will need to give explicit guidance on the future pace or type of asset purchases. Also comes after yesterday's [September FOMC minutes](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomcminutes20200916.htm) showed little discussion over whether to adjust the Fed's current $120B per month pace of bond purchases. Despite cautious approach to QE, a Fed paper this week said that bond purchases equal to 30% of US economic output, or \\~$6.5T, are required to offset the impact of the Fed's benchmark rate already being near zero ([Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-10-07/top-fed-economist-says-much-more-qe-needed-to-offset-zero-bound?sref=J9GPLx1B)).\n\n**Economists warn of impact on economic growth if stimulus negotiations fail:**\n\n* [NY Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/07/business/second-stimulus-bill-fails-impact.html?action=click&amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;pgtype=Homepage) the latest to note the economic impact of the the end of stimulus, with loss of momentum likely to grow unless more aid doesn't arrive soon. Noted near universal agreement from economists who say more aid is needed for individuals, businesses, and local governments, and that the amount is less important than how fast and where the money is deployed. Also discussed aid to state and local governments, which economists say could drive sizable reduction in economic activity if left without additional support, though was a key area of disagreement in latest round of stimulus negotiations. Moody's last month said state and local governments will have budget shortfalls of $500B through summer 2022, assuming pandemic does not get worse. Biggest cuts expected to be in education and healthcare. Also highlighted worries further state spending reductions could prolong the economic downturn ([NY Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/07/business/state-budgets-coronavirus-aid.html)).\n\n**WSJ survey shows 43% of economists not expecting full labor market recovery until 2023:**\n\n* A [WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/wsj-survey-43-of-economists-dont-see-u-s-gaining-back-lost-jobs-until-2023-11602165600) survey showed a slower timeline for a labor market recovery than predicted six months ago, particularly in travel and leisure because of continued high coronavirus infection rates. Cited a potential worsening of the COVID-19 crisis as the flu season approaches with no coronavirus vaccine, a lack of fresh fiscal stimulus, and uncertainty around the election as factors weighing on the labor market recovery. Around 80% of economists said the current election process is introducing more uncertainty into financial markets compared with elections of recent decades, and 73% saying it was creating more uncertainty than usual for the economy. However, the survey showed more optimism around a GDP rebound, with \\~58% of those surveyed expecting economic output to return to its prior peak in Q1-19 by 2021, while \\~19% expect it to recover by Q1-22. On average, the economists expect GDP to contract 3.6% this year, followed by growth of 3.7% in 2021 and 3% in 2022.\n\n**US explores restricting Ant Group and Tencent payment systems:**\n\n* People familiar with the matter told [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-10-07/u-s-explores-restrictions-on-ant-group-tencent-payment-systems?sref=J9GPLx1B) Trump administration is exploring restrictions on Ant Group and Tencent Holdings (700-HK ) over concerns their digital payment platforms threaten US national security and give Beijing access to banking and personal data of hundreds of millions of people. Restrictions could involve putting both companies on Treasury Department's national list, which effectively bars firms from doing business with them.

He reiterated that while he would like to see Britain and the EU retain equivalent standards on financial services, it would be wrong to follow EU rules if it had no control over.

It highlighted that appreciation of the euro had a material impact on inflation and market positioning was tilted to further gains. It noted that inflation expectations remained close to historic lows, amplifying risks to anchoring and there was broad agreement that there was no room for complacency. Two main FX drivers were identified: a reversal of dollar safe haven flows and the decisive action taken by EU governments on fiscal policy. It was thought that in the prevailing environment of uncertainty, the best course of action was to keep a steady hand on policy. Some made the point that with tensions in the market subsiding the pace of monthly asset purchases could be reduced. On the policy options available, it pointed to a further cut in the policy rate and changes to the TLTROs.",

AAPL -2.65% unveiled a new iPhone Tuesday capable of connecting to a much faster 5G cellular network, which investors are betting will spur strong demand.\n\nChief Executive Tim Cook stood at the company\u2019s Cupertino, Calif., headquarters to begin the webcast, streamed on Apple\u2019s website\u2014a visual reminder of how the tech giant\u2019s latest flagship-product introduction differs from previous ones because of the coronavirus pandemic, which closed businesses and left people sheltering at home around the world for much of this year.\n\nThe iPhone 12 offered a new physical appearance from last year\u2019s smartphone, moving from a rounded design to a flatter-edged look reminiscent of the iPhone 4. Apple revealed four versions of the phones ranging in sizes and starting in price from $699 for the iPhone 12 Mini with a 5.4-inch display. The iPhone 12 Pro Max has a 6.7-inch display, an increase from 6.5 inches; the higher-end versions emphasize the camera abilities.\n\n\nThe newest iPhone designs move away from the rounded shape of recent models toward a flatter-edged look akin to the iPhone 4. The iPhone 12 Pro and Pro Max, unveiled Tuesday.\nPHOTO: APPLE\nThe greatest hype going into the event, however, has been about the device\u2019s 5G capability. Apple\u2019s adoption of the next-generation wireless standard places intense focus on the new technology that has been years in the making. Cellular network carriers have been scrambling to roll out 5G service across the U.S., but coverage remains spotty in the country and it isn\u2019t clear yet whether customers will want it.\n\nWSJ NEWSLETTER\nNotes on the News\nThe news of the week in context, with Tyler Blint-Welsh.\n\nEnter your email\nSIGN UP\n\u201cToday is the beginning of a new era for iPhone,\u201d Mr. Cook said.\n\nShares slipped as the event took place, which has occurred with previous Apple events, before rebounding. With few people familiar with the new cellular service, Mr. Cook made an effort to describe why 5G technology would improve their experience. He cited improved downloads and uploads, higher-quality video streaming, better gaming and less network congestion. Apple also highlighted the integration with the company\u2019s new A14 Bionic microchip.\n\nThe presentation included demonstrations of how 5G iPhones could be helpful in downloading important medical images and for remotely designing factory spaces\u2014tacit acknowledgments that some of the most likely customers for the technology might be business users who can benefit from faster connections.\n\nHow Apple Became the World\u2019s Most Valuable Publicly Traded Company\nYOU MAY ALSO LIKE\n\nUP NEXT\n\nHow Apple Became the World\u2019s Most Valuable Publicly Traded Company\nHow Apple Became the World\u2019s Most Valuable Publicly Traded Company\nApple reached a staggering $2 trillion market valuation in August, despite years of doubt from critics over whether the tech giant could continue to succeed after the death of Steve Jobs. Here\u2019s a look at Apple\u2019s rise to the very top. Illustration: Jacob Reynolds/WSJ\n\u201cApple almost provides like the Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval,\u201d Mark Vena, a senior analyst for Moor Insights &amp; Strategy said. \u201cThey tend to validate the technology, which is unfair because you could go out today and buy a Samsung phone\u201d with 5G.\n\nThe emphasis on the guts of the iPhone marked a change from recent years where many new features involved cameras and other iterative updates. The lack of dramatic change has come as the smartphone market has matured more than a decade after Apple first introduced the iPhone.\n\nThe latest smartphone arrives five years after iPhone unit sales peaked. Mr. Cook has pushed the company to sell pricier versions of the device and to rely on software services and wearables, such as smartwatches and headphones, to boost revenue.\n\nIn a nod to those efforts, the company began its Tuesday event by introducing an updated HomePod that is smaller than its previous version of the speaker and is priced at $99.\n\n\nApple unveiled a new, smaller HomePod than its previous version of the speaker.\nPHOTO: APPLE\nApple began selling the HomePod in early 2018 after unspecified delays pushed back the rollout following its 2017 debut. The voice-activated device was Apple\u2019s attempt to catch up with the success of Amazon.com Inc. and its smart speakers in late 2014, though when the HomePod debuted at $349 it was considerably more expensive than its rivals.\n\nTo make the case for a pricier offering, Apple has previously emphasized its sound quality, especially when it comes to music. The device\u2019s price has fallen since it first went on the market.\n\nThe iPhone 12 has been hotly anticipated by investors who have driven up the company\u2019s shares 69% in 2020, partly because of excitement over the new phone. Those expectations and Apple\u2019s success in driving up services revenue helped it become the first U.S. public company to eclipse $2 trillion in market value earlier this year.\n\nAnalysts surveyed by FactSet, on average, predict iPhone revenue will rise 15% to $160 billion in the fiscal year that began Oct. 1. That is about $6 billion shy of the record set in fiscal 2018, when the $1,000 iPhone X helped bolster sales even as shipments failed to reach a new high.\n\nKaty Huberty, a veteran Apple analyst for Morgan Stanley, last week predicted the company could ship as many as 240 million iPhones this year, helped by customers who haven\u2019t upgraded in several years and excitement for 5G. That would set a record, beating the 231 million devices sold in fiscal 2015. Sales at that level could send the company\u2019s shares up 37% from Monday\u2019s close to a market value of almost $2.9 trillion, she said.\n\n\u201cWe expect this fall\u2019s launch to be the most significant iPhone event in years,\u201d she wrote in a note to investors.\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS\nWhat new products or updates are you hoping to see from Apple? Join the conversation below.\n\nIn recent years, Mr. Cook has been stretching the iPhone lineup to appeal to an array of pocketbooks. That was on display again Tuesday: A step up from the iPhone 12 Mini sits the iPhone 12, starting at $799 with a 6.1-inch display. On the higher end, the iPhone 12 Pro starts at $999, with the Pro Max offering the largest display and beginning at $1,099.\n\nThe iPhone 12 and 12 Pro are available for pre-order on Friday, and the iPhone 12 Mini and iPhone 12 Pro Max will be available Nov. 6, Apple said.\n\nSome analysts are skeptical that customers will flock to a 5G phone without a must-have application or service to help them see the appeal of the new technology. U.S. cellular networks are still being upgraded, and service might be disappointing in some spots for early adopters.\n\nIt is also uncertain how the coronavirus will affect sales of the new devices. The pandemic delayed production of the flagship phone earlier this year, which led Tuesday\u2019s unveiling to be rescheduled from its traditional September date.\n\nMr. Cook appeared publicly for the first time since a Democratic-led House subcommittee last week issued a report claiming Apple uses its control over software on its devices in an anticompetitive manner. Apple has rejected the report\u2019s conclusions and said it doesn\u2019t have a dominant market share in any area.",

        "selftext": "  \n\nPositions: BABA, TCHEY, BIDU, NIO, TSM, AVGO \n\nThesis: These companies still have a big growth potential and will have success in pretty much every situation I can think of. If the US continues to rip and has a real V-shaped recovery, Asia will rip with it. If the US crashes due to a financial crisis or reemergence of a public health crisis, Asia has pretty much completely reopened, has almost no community spread, and will be a safe haven while the US tries to recover. I don't know if the US is in a  bubble or not, but I think the multi-trillion market cap of the US tech giants limits upside regardless of how well they perform. I'm also convinced the US is about get fucked by a convergence of a second wave and a bad influenza season. Even if they don't the risk of a US economic crisis over the next year is objectively high.  \n\nBABA and TCHEY: Chinese megacaps that are still valued at under $1T and will definitely eventually get there. I wish I could buy options in Tencent. They are basically Facebook, PayPal, Activision Blizzard, and Softbank combined. Alibaba still has potential to expand into the rest of Asia including India if India-China relations improve. Both companies have virtual monopolies in their main areas of business in China and are not subject to anti-trust legislation going forward like their US counterparts. \n\nNIO and BIDU: Have tiny market caps compared to their US counterparts. Google\u2019s market cap is almost 30x higher than Baidu\u2019s and they trade at about the same P/E ratio. I\u2019ve already made a killing on Nio, which is valued at 30B compared to Tesla\u2019s nearly 500B. Chinese EV appetite is also way bigger than that of the US and the recent upgrade of Nio predicts the Chinese EV market to quadruple by 2025. I expect Nio to eventually break into US and European markets. They\u2019ve also successfully implemented battery swapping and won\u2019t need to invest in vertical integration the same way Tesla is in trying to overcome battery charge life obstacles. Both Baidu and Nio are investing heavily in fully autonomous vehicles. \n\nTSM and AVGO: Semiconductors will continue to see growth in the coming years and it\u2019s the only sector that I have confidence in right now. Another bonus if you choose to buy stock, both of these companies have generous dividends and can represent a decent hedge over the growth companies I listed. If the trade war heats up, they are located in Taiwan and Singapore respectively and will be beneficiaries of changes to US/EU supply chain. TSM is producing high quality chips cheaply and will be a big player in data center, autonomous driving, and AI. Broadcom just inked a deal with Apple for wireless components and will be a big 5G beneficiary. \n\nHow I\u2019m playing it: Long-dated calls that are way out of the money in each of these positions. I\u2019m counting on them to all at least double in the next two years. All of my calls are either Jan 2022 or Jan 2023. I also have sold out of all US stocks in my IRA and bought long positions in only in these names. The only one I\u2019m not holding calls in is TCHEY because I use Robinhood and am not aware of any way to buy options in it.",

        "selftext": "Note: saw I have a lot of messages yesterday on my old username, MiltDavis. This is where I've been posting now cuz mods, so message me here.\nI'm not an expert or anything, but I see a lot of people in the Daily Thread comments slanging VXX around, and a lot of weird information out there. Just trying to be helpful, so here ya go:\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n**The most basic thing to know is that VIX (so VXX and UVXY by extension) is a measurement of market volatility, not SPY performance.**\u00a0 Let's say you buy a bunch of AAPL options of one month expiry at an implied volatility (IV) of 50 and FB at an IV of 20, but you have them ending up the same percentage higher at the strike price of your one month expiry--let's say 5% higher.\u00a0 The logic is that, due to historical and current factors, AAPL is expected to bounce around in much higher and lower swings to reach that 5%--a wilder journey, but the same destination.\u00a0 The volatility of that journey is what VIX represents, on an extrapolated level, for SPY as a whole.\u00a0 Think of it like this--VIX is the measurement of IV for the market as a whole, rather than for an individual equity. Because of this...\n\n**VIX does not have to always directly inverse SPY, but instead just often does\u201480% of the time.** VIX can rise with SPY--or fall with SPY--it's just not as common as inversing SPY.\u00a0 It can also do it's own thing entirely.\u00a0 Certain sectors can be performing one way, and SPY another, and these performances factor into the underlying measurements to prevent a break with SPY due to weighting and a shitload of other factors.\u00a0 SPY can climb rapidly, and volatility can rise with it, because the sharp movement creates just as much variation chaos in the underlyings as a precipitous drop would.\n\n**VIX is represented as an annualized standard deviation number within SPY.**\u00a0 If VIX is 25, for example, it is estimating movement of 25% in price action in SPY over the course of the next year.\u00a0 It was above 50 during the March crash, which, when you think about it in those terms, is nuts.\n\n\u00a0 **VIX is a monthly price estimation based on SPY options premiums.**\u00a0 SPY trades on it's underlyings and is also tradeable in and of itself, whereas VIX is vessel for trading a bundle of spreads, for lack of a better term.\u00a0 This is a mathematical--even theoretical--estimate on future market movement based on how much premium people are willing to pay for S&amp;P options, or in other words, it is an estimate of market volatility based on how much money people are willing to pay for insurance on their stocks.\u00a0\u00a0Equity prices are ONLY as important here inasmuch as they effect the pricing of the equity options. The more people are willing to pay for options, the higher VIX goes.\n\n**VIX is NOT the in-the-moment measurement of the underlying SPY put/call option spread\u2014it is\u00a0forward looking to the monthy expiration**.\u00a0\u00a0In the case of VIX this is a minimum of 23 days and up to 37 days out, with weighting favored toward the one month expiration.\u00a0 The math is crazy and intricate, on some Rainman shit, but the important thing to know is that VIX isn't a prisoner of the moment, but instead a look at the coming one month landscape taking in all factors over that course in time.\n\n*Real life example*: Many people have been expecting VIX to be much higher as we head into an election, but if we think of it in forward-looking, weighted terms, this moment may have passed--at least as far as the election is concerned.\u00a0 VIX is taking into consideration, at the moment,\u00a0 the perceived calmer times beginning toward the end of November after the election.\u00a0 If you go back and look at VIX values about one month prior to the election date, you can see that VIX was at it's peak on October 5th and 6th, reaching appproximately $30.\u00a0 This would correlate with the expected movement weighted one month from that day, or in other words, peak fear a day or two after the election.\n\n**Volatility is volatile, and therefore not a buy and hold: **VIX associates VXX and UVXY are known for making people rich on days like June 11th, or in September, when they suddenly climb 10, 15, 20% in a single day or a two day stretch.\u00a0 Yes, this a large part of it's appeal.\u00a0 But the real reason people get rich is that VIX IV can climb high--fast--because it's price movements are not considered lasting and great fluctuation becomes priced in.\u00a0 IV shoots up on these things like crazy, which means that the value of your VIX options shoots up like crazy.\u00a0 BUT, value also falls like crazy too, and it has intense theta burn (cost appreciation of the asset over time). So, while you are sitting around waiting to make your million dollar play with a VXX monthly you are losing a lot of money in the process.\u00a0 The VIX knows this, and it smells your weakness, and the day after you've dumped it because you've bled 50% it will rocket to new heights.\u00a0 Because of this...\n\n**VIX, VXX, and UVXY are meant as loss strategies and hedges, but not as outright plays.**\u00a0 Unless you are some Burry level TA specialist, or maybe my guy /u/winnning007, and you can pinpoint when certain events are going to happen or the market response within a day or two, you're best to keep a smaller amount as a hedge rather than go all in.\u00a0 The road to bagholding is short and full of terrors with volatility plays. B**UY SPY PUTS INSTEAD IF YOU ARE BEARISH**\n\n**VIX VXX and UVXY\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-**\n\nSo all that is cool, but VIX is a futures instrument and not a daily tradeable ETF/ETN; *enter VXX and UVXY.*\u00a0 To keep it simple, I'm going to lump the two together and just say that UVXY is a more levered version of VXX.\u00a0 So UVXY can climb higher than VXX when it rises, and fall lower than VXX when it falls.\u00a0 For the purposes of this explanation, I'm going to focus on VXX, but bottom line--if you don't really know what you're doing/aren't confident in your volatility move, stick with VXX rather than UVXY.\u00a0 The money is still good, don't be a hero.\n\n**VXX tracks the performance of VIX, but offers different expirations **(weekly ETF settlement dates like Friday/Saturday rather than the Wednesday of monthly futures), and tracks it at about a 50% level.\u00a0 In other words, if the VIX monthly futures have an 8% jump, expect about 4% for VXX monthlies.\u00a0 VXX is also an ETN, not an ETF--this is important because it means that it must have a direct tracking of the VIX unlike a fund which isn't beholden to a certain rate of correlation.\u00a0 In other words, VXX MUST track that ~50% of the VIX for efficacy.\n\nWhat's important here: VIX is the futures estimate bundle, and VXX is not VIX, but it is a\u00a0very reliable tracker of VIX price movements with few notable exceptions.\u00a0 UVXY is kind of like a levered version of VXX, meant to track with higher returns. These two can and do at times move out of sync with VIX due to something called contango.\n\n*If you want to go in depth on the intricacies of their relationship and contango and shit, I won\u2019t do that here, but this is a good resource:* https://www.schaeffersresearch.com/content/news/2015/02/04/the-messy-relationship-between-vix-and-vxx\n\n**Manipulation**\n\nWhenever VXX doesn't move with SPY, I bitterly joke that it's illegal and manipulated.\u00a0 This wayward movement is actually more due to the natural variance I pointed out earlier, but there is some truth to it.\u00a0 CBOE--the VIX providers--have been sued a few times over the past few years due to alleged manipulation of VIX.\u00a0 Of note, the \"Father of VIX\" as one article called it's creator, was one of the whistleblowers alleging fraud.\u00a0 The case was recently thrown out again, but the accusations speak for themselves.\n\n&gt;\tThe plaintiffs, traders in VIX-based products, filed a lawsuit alleging that certain features of the settlement process made it especially susceptible to manipulation but that Cboe chose not to enforce its rules against manipulation so it could continue to profit from the VIX products. Specifically, the complaint alleged violations of the Exchange Act antifraud provisions and the CEA and brought claims against both Cboe and anonymous \"Doe\" defendants that allegedly manipulated the settlement values for VIX options and futures by manipulating the two-zero-bid rule and employing a process analogous to \"banging the close.\"\n\nSo, ya know, innocent until proven guilty, but there is a lot of info out there to suggest that a lot of people invested in--and involved in the creation of--VIX through CBOE think it's manipulated.\u00a0 That can't be ignored.\n\n**Other tidbits to note:**\nA lot of little things matter with VIX; Quad witching dates, portfolio rebalancing dates, Congressional hearings with the FED, release of beige books, stress tests, and FOMC are all catalysts for VXX/UVXY activity if you're searching for short dated FD plays.\u00a0 Just look at the financial calendar on the FED website or Marketwatch, etc., before you make any moves against volatility. You're one JPOW speech to congress away from the big GUH.\n\n**Positions**: This was meant to be informative more than predictive.\u00a0\n\nThat said, I don't have a phenomenal read on this market--I'm not a TA guy generally, and a lot of the fundamentals are out the window as we approach the election.\u00a0 BUT, I expect anticipation of lame-duck political activity should there be a Blue Wave, PLUS uncertainty around COVID second wave restriction regression, PLUS the unveiling of a variety of coming tax changes in a Biden win, will likely bring higher pricing in option premiums and thus higher VIX.\n\n**UVXY 11/6 20c VXX 10/30 24c VXX 11/6 26c**\n**Earnings I like: NTGR, NOW, PYPL, MSFT, CVNA**\n**General shit I like: LMND, JD, DDOG**\n\n**TLDR: VIX does not always move with SPY, it may be manipulated, it is not meant to be held long term, and is future looking not day-to-day.\u00a0 Trade it thinking of a bigger picture rather than expecting it to react to every daily market event. Never go all in on a monthly, you\u2019ll theta bleed.**\n\nYou can message me and comment and stuff and I\u2019ll get to it.\u00a0\n\nI AM NOT AN EXPERT.\u00a0 A lot of the technical terminology you can probably argue with. This is just my own research and experiences.\u00a0 Do your own research.",

        "selftext": "I like Square as a company and see a lot of people are bullish about it. However, a few things stop me from investing. Be interested to hear thoughts but at the moment I am a Square bear. \n\n**Management**\n\nJack Dorsey is a visionary. I don\u2019t think this is controversial. However, his track record at Twitter is worrying for shareholders. Be it daily active user growth, ambition with acquisitions but ultimately failure to monetise a fantastic platform where you have big corporations, celebrities and even the President reaching out to 200m daily active users for free. With Square, the closed loop business model of businesses and consumers is again a fantastic concept that could break the power of Visa/Mastercard. Execution remains to be seen, of course. \n\n**Competition**\n\nSquare operate in a highly competitive field for consumers and businesses. Let\u2019s take consumers based on Square\u2019s fast-growing Cash App. It offers things a normal bank does like deposits, ATM access, money transfer. If it becomes a fully-fledged bank offering loans, credit; it is competing against the likes of big incumbents (e.g. JP Morgan, Bank of America). Granted they\u2019re dinosaur firms but they already have a huge customer base that are older and, therefore, have more money and deposits. This means it is much easier for them to monetise their customers resulting in high ARPU. Why would these lucrative customers, en-masse, want to uproot their finances to Square when their existing providers will be providing the same service by copying Square, as JP Morgan have done this week? [Link](https://www.pymnts.com/smbs/2020/jpmorgan-takes-on-square-and-paypal-at-the-point-of-sale/) \n\nFor businesses, Square\u2019s provides software offering (invoicing, PoS, online store) but face strong competition from the likes of Shopify who are taking a fully integrated service approach to SMEs which allows them to take their business online but also manage all their backend processes, including payments. This is a highly convenient service for entrepreneurs. Shopify already has 6% share of the online retail market. Square also provides hardware products which make it easy for SMEs, in particular, to take payments. However, there is evidence that retail is facing a more permanent shift in the US vs. the rest of the world with 60% less footfall today than a year ago [Link](https://www.spring-board.info/benchmarks/benchmark/daily-footfall). 58% of Square\u2019s GPV is from food/drink, retail and professional services. Square may have good market share but it is a shrinking industry.\n\nAnd as a final piece, competitors in both spaces are generally in very healthy financial shape: Paypal, Shopify, Global Payments, Western Union and big banks are well-capitalised. \n\n**Valuation**\n\nPerhaps you can get over the above with the fact that Square has strong network effects and are able to win customers cheaply. However, in my opinion, Square is priced for perfection. Simply looking at a price/sales metric, it is trading 13x LTM. This is high but maybe relatively reasonable for a fast-growing business. However, 25% of Square\u2019s revenue is accounted by Bitcoin \u201crevenue\u201d. This brings little value to Square (2% gross profit) and even Square themselves discount this revenue in their KPIs because it is \u201cout of their control and not reflective of Square\u2019s performance\u201d. \n\nNow onto profits. It is not fair to be too hard on Square\u2019s profitability. After all, it is in high growth phase and its marketing costs were its highest opex line item at roughly 35% for YTD. However, a cursory look at it is Enterprise Value / EBITDA (forward look to Dec2020), it is 242x. If we give credit for Square\u2019s business plan for a further two years, today\u2019s Enterprise Value over broker consensus forecast EBITDA for 2022, it is still a heady 77x. This is when Square is supposed to have EBITDA of $1bn which is three times more than it is forecast for Dec 2020. Priced to perfection.\n\nIf you compare it to Paypal, it is trading at 39x and 27x EV / EBITDA for Dec 2020 and 2022.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nSquare has formidable backers like Ark Invest. I am also not a great believer in \u201cdumb retail\u201d overvaluing a stock for a prolonged period of time. But for reasons above, I am cautious with Square and yet it keeps climbing so please tell me what I am missing\u2026",

        "selftext": "What is your top convictions, where you feel as close to certain as you can about its future. Upside or downside. \n\nMine:\n\n\n1. Square ($SQ) is going to be a $1 trillion dollar company in my lifetime. I am honestly amazed how well this company is positioning themselves. They will move away from small business as they slowly replace the wallet and cash of the US. Similar things have already happened in Sweden, world leader in digital payments. Square is doing the same but in the US, while being the best trusted bitcoin handler and small business backend.\n\n2. Paypal ($PYPL) is slowly moving themselves into e commerce in a way they haven't before. They are light years ahead of anyone in ease of payment, and is rapidly spreading into a global power. If your country has a population, it takes PayPal for online purchases. On top of it, Venmo is the only threat to Squares cash app, so why not own both. \n\n3. Facebook ($FB) is going to be one of the solid heavy weights of the next 10 years, where some people vocally hate on them while they are raking in money hands over fists from the entire world. They have shown an almost disgusting ability of killing completion, and wouldn't be hurt much from a potential breakup (which I personally doubt will happen. Future post). Additionally, they just had a massive blow out success in VR, releasing the quest 2 incredibly successfully. VR will be mainstream and Facebook WILL be the king of it. \n\n:) \n\nAs you may notice from my picks, I am betting on the death of cash. And I really really do. No price targets as I plan holding these forever. My models to suggest overpriced fairly, but I belive their growth will accelerate as new services/monitazationa are released.\n\nWhat do you belive in?",

And it's 100% free since it's a [twitter account](https://twitter.com/TradyticsAIbot). Here are some alerts from today that I am keeping an eye on tomorrow and the next few days.\n\nBearish means the price of contract will go down while bullish means the price of contract will go up.\n\n# $PINS\n\nI believe both $PINS and [$SNAP](https://www.tradytics.com/bullseye-dashboard?alert=-Kw0NE-gbjJn-S7H2b-j6jZ7-1VL7D) are a bit overextended right now and need to dip. One of [SNAP](https://www.tradytics.com/bullseye-dashboard?alert=-Kw0NE-gbjJn-S7H2b-j6jZ7-1VL7D) alerts today had a gain of 85%. That is further confirmed by this alert. Bearish on CALL mean either Sell to Open the call or Buy to Open a put.\n\n[Track alert at: https:\\/\\/www.tradytics.com\\/bullseye-dashboard?alert=-U6wco-znVFx-RA167-DSU76-cvHSh](https://preview.redd.it/s138kigzbru51.png?width=587&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=de09683f91d49b720fc53a2db1be3d5e6176a690)\n\n# $SQ\n\nSQ had dipped quite nicely the last few days and it is about to be on a resistance line ([https://i.imgur.com/ow1F4vh.png](https://i.imgur.com/ow1F4vh.png)). This contract seems to have a long expiry and this looks like a good one. Maybe too costly so you can get in on a cheaper one.\n\n[Track alert at: https:\\/\\/www.tradytics.com\\/bullseye-dashboard?alert=-t1xlI-wzasX-Vsip8-sHlJz-eD7fx](https://preview.redd.it/8cb6589ycru51.png?width=591&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f1fb92211b9759b788b94db2ced908b0391f07f5)\n\n# $PYPL\n\nPYPL was about to break a good resistance level but failed ([https://i.imgur.com/NG02hoH.png](https://i.imgur.com/NG02hoH.png)). There is another support right below the current price so if we can somehow stay there, this is a good contract. Again, you can go a bit cheaper.\n\n[Track alert at: https:\\/\\/www.tradytics.com\\/bullseye-dashboard?alert=-lmRJF-bA5ZF-h5tE1-1tG13-cWlKf](https://preview.redd.it/v4sf93gddru51.png?width=594&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=acdca1c06d4f43f92eef21388c1008e41e28e775)\n\nThat's it - I just want to see if there's demand for these daily alerts in the community here. If you folks like this style of alerts, I'll post them on daily basis with my thoughts.\n\nComments?",

        "selftext": "With health care systems under intense scrutiny during the pandemic, Vancouver\u2019s Well Health Technologies Corp. has seen massive growth as it invests in digital tools to make care more efficient for clinicians and patients alike.\n\nWell\u2019s share price has risen nearly 350 per cent this year, to $6.98 on the Toronto Stock Exchange at the end of Friday, as the pandemic-dominated period has seen health care practitioners and clinics invest in telehealth and other digital health technologies. What began as a network of yoga studios has turned into a nimble medical-technology company with its sights set on improving how health clinics work.\n\nIn the past five weeks alone, Well has launched an app marketplace for clinic owners to find ways to manage aspects of their business such as online booking and workflow automation; announced a US$14-million controlling investment in the U.S. telehealth company Circle Medical, giving the company access to health care markets in 35 states; closed a $23-million private placement led by Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-shing; and revealed a $70-million bought-deal financing underwritten by Eight Capital and Stifel GMP.\n\nIn an interview, Well\u2019s founder and chief executive Hamed Shahbazi said the company wants to take a long-view approach seeking technology that improves health outcomes. \u201cIt was not too long ago that we didn\u2019t even know we needed to sanitize our operating tools,\" he said. \"Technology is responsibly for our life expectancies increasing. ... We can\u2019t take it for granted.\u201d\n\nTechnology wasn\u2019t really what Mr. Shahbazi had in mind when he first founded the company as a network of yoga studios licensing Deepak Chopra\u2019s eponymous yoga-studio brand in Canada. In 2017, it listed on the TSX Venture Exchange under the name Wellness Lifestyles with a reverse takeover. That same year, PayPal Holdings Inc. bought Mr. Shahbazi\u2019s payment-processing company, Tio Networks Corp., for US$304-million \u2013 although PayPal suspended Tio operations several months later after a data breach was found.\n\nMr. Shahbazi first had no intention of running Wellness Lifestyles day to day, but soon became curious about the state of primary care in Canada. Everything he studied about Canadian health care, he said, \u201cseemed to point at all this fragmentation in the system.\u201d\n\nTechnology adoption has been slower here than in other countries. The 2019 Commonwealth Fund International Health Policy Survey of Primary Care Physicians, for example, found that a low percentage of Canadian doctors were able to electronically share information with other clinical providers: Just 22 per cent could share patient clinical summaries, for example, versus 93 per cent in Norway.\n\nAlthough Canada\u2019s health care system is public, Mr. Shahbazi realized its many privately owned medical clinics could benefit from technology sold at scale \u2013 saving their already busy physicians from having to deal with issues such as network security on their own. With Tio sold, Mr. Shahbazi became Wellness Lifestyles\u2019 CEO in May, 2018. The company rebranded as Well Health Technologies two months later, refocusing on primary care.\n\nMr. Shahbazi is a consolidator at heart and looked up to Canadian software acquisition powerhouses such as Constellation Software Inc. and Enghouse Systems Ltd. as he built up Tio in the previous decade. He\u2019s building Well the same way.\n\nThe company now has a network of 20 physical clinics in British Columbia; a new subsidiary to expand its \u201callied health\u201d holdings, such as sleep, mental-health and physiotherapy clinics; and a network of digital services that the company says serves more than 2,000 clinics and more than 10,000 physicians, largely in B.C. and Ontario. The company now has 266 employees on top of its health care practitioners, who work as independent contractors.\n\nWell\u2019s growing cache of software and partnerships is largely based off of the McMaster University-founded Open Source Clinical Application and Resource (OSCAR) system for electronic medical records. Mr. Shahbazi said he hopes that centralizing much of this software in Well\u2019s new app marketplace, called apps.health, will encourage more medical clinics to invest in digitization.\n\nLaurentian Bank Securities analyst Nick Agostino said the company\u2019s acquisition-heavy approach was wise. \u201cHaving both physical and virtual clinics makes a lot of sense to grab hold of patients and capture recurring revenue,\" he said.\n\nIn Canada, Well\u2019s strategy most closely competes with blended virtual-physical health care investments by legacy companies such as Loblaw Cos. Ltd. and the growing health wing of Telus Corp., Mr. Agostino said.\n\nWell jumped from the Venture Exchange to the TSX this past January, and its strategy has since pushed its market capitalization to more than $1-billion \u2013 more than triple the value of Tio when it was sold to PayPal.\n\nAnalyst Doug Taylor of Canaccord Genuity raised his price target for Well to $8 from $6 last week as the company announced its app marketplace at a moment when investors are already interested in health care technology. \u201cWell stands to benefit from streamlined cross-selling of its growing stable of proprietary health care technology assets and revenue sharing from third-party software,\u201d he wrote in a research note.\n\nThe pandemic-driven shift to digital pushed Well\u2019s revenue for the quarter ending June 30 to $10.6-million, up 43 per cent from the year prior. Digital services accounted for $2.3-million of that \u2013 a 1,212-per-cent increase from the year earlier, owing to pandemic adoption and Well\u2019s acquisition spree.\n\nhttps://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-well-health-ceo-sees-canadas-health-clinic-market-as-ripe-for/",

        "selftext": "I think there is a big way to make consistent money similar to trade deals and corona virus hype that people are not exploiting yet.\n\nEverytime stimulus news is brought up, payment providers rally. You can see this inPaypal, Visa, and Square right now.\n\nThis is partially lead to SQ reaching all time highs and Paypal and Visa to be close as well. Even though in contact payments from SQ is down, they have converted successfully via cashapp to online movements.\n\nLooking at some flow, look at $SQ\u2019s run on Friday:\nhttps://gyazo.com/1eb2621dfb91c6e1e72b6380464e48cf\n\nThis is despite the news of a wavering stimulus. In fact, it looks like option flow is heading that way on [these payment providers](https://twitter.com/unusual_whales/status/1311683758735597569) with big movements happening earlier this month in anticipation of the stimulus.\n\nPaypal and Visa are looking a little beat up in comparison, but I think the flow will hit them too. I suspect Monday/Tuesday we get a lot of talk about the stimulus after the weekend and Trump\u2019s Friday offers. Plus pressure from the populace to make a deal happen.\n\nFor example, Trump may go bigger than [a 2.2 trillion COVID stimulus](https://twitter.com/samstein/status/1315306191178825735).\n\nAs result, some positions I have: PYPL $202 call 10/30 and SQ $220 call 10/23, and I am bullish on all payment companies as a result.

I work for a university and make good money, and over the acedemic breaks over the summer I joined Etsy to sell some homemade good, and it did extraordinarily well. Now that I have a good positive cash flow, I want to invest and try to grow my money. I don't know much about the stock market, except that March was a good time to buy in lol. I don't know what calls are, I looked at r/wallstreetbets and found too much shit posting, joined in the GME hype and didn't sell out this morning so I ended up losing money on it, but not much at least. I also didn't know that the markets were closed on Saturday. Are they closed Sunday too? Do stocks continue to move during closed times or do they remain stagnant?\n\nTo the point. I'm looking at ETSY, Microsoft, PayPal, shopify, GE. They seem to be doing good, especially etsy which went up like $100 this year. But I don't know what good beginners stocks would be. I already bought into etsy with 1 share and earned a few bucks. But just because they are doing really good at this time, does it seem like a good idea to buy in? Especially during this pandemic with no stimulus anytime soon (I'm in the US), I'm afraid of the stocks falling again, but not too worried, sound like if they fall just buy in maybe?\n\nWhat are good strategies to find out what stocks are best? Do I follow certain companies closely to find out what moves they will make? How do I know if what they will do is going to be beneficial?

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, October 21, 2020**\n\nStocks traded choppily today as market participants closely monitor development in Washington surrounding stimulus. Though Pelosi\u2019s self-imposed deadline of 48-hours to reach an agreement came and went, discussions continue.\n\nThe Nasdaq (QQQ) finished the day 0.08% down, the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) finished 0.21% down, and the Dow Jones (DIA) underperformed the most, ending the day 0.35% down.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi told Bloomberg TV that she was willing to keep stimulus discussions open past her Tuesday deadline and said she is \u201coptimistic\u201d about the progress being made. White House Chief of Staff Market Meadows said on CNBC that negotiators were working hard to get a deal done by the weekend, and that White House increased its offer by another $80 billion to $1.88 trillion.\n\nDespite support from the President and top government officials, questions remain over whether the Republican-controlled Senate, who have publicly disparaged the bill, would vote to advance any deal. Senate Republicans have so far baulked at the high price-tag the proposals. According to an article released by the New York Times, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell privately told Republican senators on Tuesday that he had warned the White House not to strike a pre-election deal with Speaker Nancy Pelosi on a new round of stimulus, moving to head off an agreement that President Trump has demanded but most in his party oppose. McConnell\u2019s remarks, which were confirmed by four Republicans familiar with them, threw cold water on Mr. Trump\u2019s increasingly urgent push to enact a new round of pandemic aid before Election Day and came just as Ms. Pelosi offered an upbeat assessment of her negotiations with Steven Mnuchin.\n\nIn other news, Senate Democrats successfully blocked the Republicans\u2019 attempt to pass a targeted $500 billion coronavirus bill, with Pelosi, Mnuchin, and the White House engaged in a desperate attempt to come to a much-needed agreement before the November election. The bill, similar to one the Republicans tried to pass some weeks ago, fell in a 51-44 vote, falling short of the 60 supermajority required. Republicans in Congress argue Democrats have reached for an expensive wish list filled with many provisions unrelated to the crisis. McConnell said the Democrats are engaging in \u201call-or-nothing obstruction\u201d as they hold out for a comprehensive deal worth about $2 trillion. In response, Democrats accuse the GOP of failing to recognize the magnitude of the economic and health crisis that is gripping the country. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (Democrat, New York) has called the Republican plan paltry, partisan, and emaciated. \n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi said she \u201chas a prospect for an agreement\u201d with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on a coronavirus stimulus package, but floated the possibility that it may not come together in time to pass both chambers before the Nov. 3 election. \u201cThere will be a bill. The question is: is it time to pay the November rent \u2014 my goal \u2014 or will it be shortly after. I want people to know that help is on its way. It will be bigger. It will be better. And it will be retroactive.\u201d It seems the chances for any sort of short-term stimulus before November 3 are slipping away.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Snapchat (SNAP) rocketed up today after posting better than expected quarterly earnings report. The Stock was up 30.88% at the time of writing.

        "selftext": "Just curious on a 2nd or 3rd opinion on a few stocks I've been eye balling. Would graciously appreciate someone with maybe some more knowledge opinion.\n\nWould love any insight you guys have on these tickers. Thanks again any constructive thoughts are GREATLY appreciated.  \n\n$NEE - Amazing Long term growth. Attempting to buyout other companies. Dividend has been rapidly increasing. Is the growth potentially done or near done?\n\n$AVGO - Amazing long term growth. Dividend has been RAPIDLY increasing. Can't imagine Broadcom getting smaller but just like NEE how much more growth is there still?\n\n$NVDA - INSANE long term growth. Big player in the market. Doubtful they are going anywhere in the future\n Trash dividend. And once again they have grown so much idk how much more they are likely to grow.\n\n$PYPL - Amazing long term growth. PayPal rumored to be moving into Ecommerence. Huge player for electronic transactions. I forsee them continuing to grow into the future.. No dividend \n\n$PENN - Amazing long term growth. Analysis put a $100 PT. I dont see gambling EVER going anywhere in the future. \n\n$COST - Decent long term growth. I feel like Costco is going to continue to grow as a super giant into the future. Dividend is slightly lacking. \n\n$U - New IPO. Unity is a huge player in the mobile app industry. If expect growth with them branching out. Not to mention I dont see mobile app using another company to this degree.\n\n$T - Mainly for the dividend. 10yr growth is a mere 2% on average. I feel like HBO MAX and the casual dividend increase will make up for this long term. \n\n$JPM - Decent long term growth. Bad PR recently but I dont see that holding it back. Dividend is pretty prime and the banking sector will grow once interest rates are settled. \n\n$CRSR - New IPO.HUGE player in the ESports community. Doesn't seem to be slowing down at all. Big on Twitch.tv with sponsorships and the streaming industry. Esport is a rapidly growing industry. Sadly no dividend as of now. \n\n$KIRK - There site is a overstock wayfair look alike. In the future I can see them rapidly growing just as those did. Even to some degree the growth potential would be massive.\n\n$JMIA - Essentially the amazon of Europe/Africa. Branching out into the African market. The growth on this seems like it could be exponential.\n\n$AGO - New IPO. Sells camping gear as well as GUNS and AMMO. Comparing it to camping world [$CWH] seems like there's alot of potential growth in the market.",

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, October 21, 2020**\n\nStocks traded choppily today as market participants closely monitor development in Washington surrounding stimulus. Though Pelosi\u2019s self-imposed deadline of 48-hours to reach an agreement came and went, discussions continue.\n\nThe Nasdaq (QQQ) finished the day 0.08% down, the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) finished 0.21% down, and the Dow Jones (DIA) underperformed the most, ending the day 0.35% down.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi told Bloomberg TV that she was willing to keep stimulus discussions open past her Tuesday deadline and said she is \u201coptimistic\u201d about the progress being made. White House Chief of Staff Market Meadows said on CNBC that negotiators were working hard to get a deal done by the weekend, and that White House increased its offer by another $80 billion to $1.88 trillion.\n\nDespite support from the President and top government officials, questions remain over whether the Republican-controlled Senate, who have publicly disparaged the bill, would vote to advance any deal. Senate Republicans have so far baulked at the high price-tag the proposals. According to an article released by the New York Times, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell privately told Republican senators on Tuesday that he had warned the White House not to strike a pre-election deal with Speaker Nancy Pelosi on a new round of stimulus, moving to head off an agreement that President Trump has demanded but most in his party oppose. McConnell\u2019s remarks, which were confirmed by four Republicans familiar with them, threw cold water on Mr. Trump\u2019s increasingly urgent push to enact a new round of pandemic aid before Election Day and came just as Ms. Pelosi offered an upbeat assessment of her negotiations with Steven Mnuchin.\n\nIn other news, Senate Democrats successfully blocked the Republicans\u2019 attempt to pass a targeted $500 billion coronavirus bill, with Pelosi, Mnuchin, and the White House engaged in a desperate attempt to come to a much-needed agreement before the November election. The bill, similar to one the Republicans tried to pass some weeks ago, fell in a 51-44 vote, falling short of the 60 supermajority required. Republicans in Congress argue Democrats have reached for an expensive wish list filled with many provisions unrelated to the crisis. McConnell said the Democrats are engaging in \u201call-or-nothing obstruction\u201d as they hold out for a comprehensive deal worth about $2 trillion. In response, Democrats accuse the GOP of failing to recognize the magnitude of the economic and health crisis that is gripping the country. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (Democrat, New York) has called the Republican plan paltry, partisan, and emaciated. \n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi said she \u201chas a prospect for an agreement\u201d with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on a coronavirus stimulus package, but floated the possibility that it may not come together in time to pass both chambers before the Nov. 3 election. \u201cThere will be a bill. The question is: is it time to pay the November rent \u2014 my goal \u2014 or will it be shortly after. I want people to know that help is on its way. It will be bigger. It will be better. And it will be retroactive.\u201d It seems the chances for any sort of short-term stimulus before November 3 are slipping away.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Snapchat (SNAP) rocketed up today after posting better than expected quarterly earnings report. The Stock was up 30.88% at the time of writing. Other social media stocks (FB, TWTR, an notably PINS) were up in sympathy\n   * EPS of $0.01 vs -$0.04 expected\n   * Revenue of  $678.7 million vs. $547.2 million expected\n* United Airlines (UAL) will on Wednesday test a digital health pass as part of a global pilot program designed to accelerate a safer opening of international borders and kick-start global travel.

They are one of the leading companies in contactless payments which has now strived under covid.  Since April they have added over 7million new users and don\u2019t forget its connection to the old dinosaur EBay which has been doing great since covid and also has ER end of month I believe. \n      All the 10/30 calls got iv crushed once the official ER date came out so it\u2019s a decent time to grab some strictly for the run up. Buy longer dated ones if you plan to hold thru ER. I just mentioned 10/30 options because they are at a discount right now.

Things like retro video games, Pokemon cards, etc seem to have a lot of value for those who want to relive their youth. So as someone in their 30s, looking 10-20 years down the road I can look at my kids and current trends to figure out what might be valuable in the future. \n\nI see a few challenges with this though, first who knows what will be popular just like who knows what stock will be worth 100x more 10-20 years from now. Second I think there is a lot more knowledge and availability than their used to be. Back in the 80s/90s there was no internet, eBay, PayPal, etc. As a result people just sold stuff at garage sales, threw away or didn't keep in good condition. I think the market in the future will have more inventory making for less profitable items.\n\nThat being said, what would you say are items that might be worth money in the future? Sealed PS4, Switch games, current generation Pokemon, trading cards?",

        "selftext": " ***PayPal (Nasdaq: PYPL) Q3 Earnings Play***\n\nPayPal earnings are coming up in october and the company has a lot of potential as they already crushed Q2 earnings.\n\n**General facts**\n\n* 73% YTD growth\n* $225B Market Cap\n* 2019 Revenue: $17.772B\n\nThe stock went down in [september](https://i.imgur.com/FHA4reY.png) and is now on for a earnings [run-up](https://i.imgur.com/uJ0M4QX.png). PayPal is currently sitting around $15 below its ATH. There is probably no need to explain what PayPal is or what it does.\n\nTotal Payment Volume (TPV)\n\n\"Total  Payment Volume or \"TPV\" is the value of payments, net of payment  reversals, successfully completed through our Payments Platform,  excluding transactions processed through our gateway products.\"\n\n\\--&gt; *Fees on money transactions*\n\nThat means that PayPal makes more money when more transactions are being made.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n1iw3tt13dr51.png?width=554&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0c5711eda5ad1f0422692e74985c16820a43f0fe\n\n**Free Cashflow (FCF)**\n\n$2.19B in Q2 with an increase 112% y/y\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2tr61wt23dr51.png?width=550&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1f3f312a637670c54ebbd70fb223f49b60e5d4fc\n\n\\--&gt;  Now you are probably asking yourself what all those fucking images and  words mean. It\u00b4s simple. PayPal has seen a lot of new users due to the  pandemic and everyone ordering their shit from Jeff Bezos. We are still  in a pandemic and the second wave is about to come. This means that more  and more people are going to use services like PayPal and as I stated  above; more users means more transactions which means more money for PayPal. So more tendies for us.

TPV will rise due to more and more people using PayPal due to the Pandemic. This will lead the FCF to rise as well and this makes stonks go up for us to make some tendies.\n\n**New Customers**\n\nPayPal has seen a rise in new accounts of 21.3 million in Q2.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6xkjfind3dr51.png?width=414&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c1c34c732b58eb2c3daa5581dffaa5d0a5ba565b\n\n**So how are we making tendies on the upcoming earnings?**\n\nPayPal is expecting \"strong momentum from Q2 to continue into Q3\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1slqhmre3dr51.png?width=478&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c9fa90bc61c64cebfb38f1b4d565bd4ab7172632\n\n*They will be crushing earnings* [*again*](https://i.imgur.com/iBhZqrE.png) *like they did in Q2 (actual Growth: 22% and 25%)*\n\nAnalysts have set a *price target around $220.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img n0vw56pf3dr51...*\n\n**Recent News**\n\n\"PayPal and Mastercard will continue the global expansion of its PayPal Business Debit Mastercard.\" [Source](https://www.mobilepaymentstoday.com/news/paypal-business-debit-mastercard-expands-european-market-reach/)\n\nThey also announced to support black communities and businesses.

        "selftext": "China might be the best hedge for U.S. stocks.\n\nKey Chinese indexes and stocks are outperforming their U.S. counterparts, and investor sentiment suggests that Asia might even emerge as an economic haven, as America and Europe are still struggling with the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nThe Xtrackers Harvest CSI 300 China A-Shares exchange-traded fund (ticker: ASHR), a proxy for mainland China\u2019s stocks, is up 18% this year, compared with 6% for the S&amp;P 500 index.\n\nShares of Alibaba Group Holding (BABA), one of China\u2019s most important companies, are up 36% this year. Alibaba, given its broad scope, might just help investors insulate their portfolios at a time of unusual duress in U.S. history\u2014acting in the role once occupied by fixed income when it was an effective offset to equity weakness.\n\nWhen President Donald Trump surprisingly ended stimulus negotiations with a Tuesday tweet, U.S. stocks sank. Many Chinese stocks, notably Alibaba, held up.\n\nHedging U.S. portfolios with Chinese stocks, particularly Alibaba, might seem outlandish, but Susquehanna Investment Group, a top options-trading firm that seeks out noncorrelated U.S. equity investments, has significant China exposure. The secretive trading company owns a huge piece of ByteDance, the parent company of TikTok, that could be worth more than $15 billion. The investment would probably dwarf anything the firm\u2019s partners have ever realized in a long history of extraordinary success.\n\nAlibaba will never protect a portfolio the way traditional hedges, such as S&amp;P 500 options, do, but Alibaba\u2019s options premiums and stock price aren\u2019t as distorted ahead of the bizarre U.S. presidential election. Trading volumes on the Cboe Volatility Index, or VIX, are stunningly anemic during the oddest trading year since the 2008-09 financial crisis, suggesting that investors have little faith that VIX derivatives will work as expected.\n\nBut adding China exposure, especially Alibaba, to a portfolio offers hedging through diversification.\n\nAlibaba will hold its annual Singles Day event on Nov. 11. For 24 hours, Alibaba will host an online sale and celebration that makes Amazon.com\u2019s (AMZN) Prime Day seem like a Rotary Club luncheon. The company will probably report quarterly earnings in early November.\n\nIn 2019, Singles Day sales totaled $38 billion, up from $31 billion in the previous year. This year\u2019s event will indicate how much Asian consumers have recovered from the coronavirus. Powerful sales results will intrigue investors who are worried about the sclerotic U.S. and European economies and concerned about political mishandling of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nWith Alibaba\u2019s stock at $296.50, investors can sell Alibaba\u2019s November $295 put for $18.20 and buy Alibaba\u2019s November $300 call for $17.60. The trade generates a credit of 60 cents. If Alibaba\u2019s stock is at $310 at expiration, the call is worth $10. Should the stock price be below the put strike price at expiration, investors are obligated to buy the stock at the strike price, or to cover the put at a higher prices.\n\nDuring the past 52 weeks, Alibaba\u2019s stock has ranged from $161.68 to $299. Shares are up 80% over the past year.\n\nAlibaba\u2019s attraction extends beyond hedging and diversification. The stock monetizes the rise of Asia\u2019s middle class, which is one of the world\u2019s greatest economic trends. Alibaba\u2019s scope is so broad that anyone who buys the stock essentially gets the Asian equivalent of a portfolio of companies similar to eBay (EBAY), PayPal Holdings (PYPL), Goldman Sachs Group (GS), FedEx (FDX), United Parcel Service (UPS), and the entertainment studios.\n\nReports indicate that China\u2019s economy is already recovering from the coronavirus. Goldman has even advised clients that Asia is well positioned compared with other areas because it has contained the virus. The irony is unpleasantly rich.",

        "selftext": "Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/smallstreetbets. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning October 12th, 2020.\n\n# **Earnings could be a positive force for stocks as Washington continues to wrangle over stimulus  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/09/earnings-could-be-a-positive-force-for-stocks-as-washington-continues-to-wrangle-over-stimulus.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Stock market optimism for a stimulus package has been rising, but the focus swings to earnings and that could be a positive for stocks in the week ahead.\n*****\n&gt; JPMorgan, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, Bank of America and Morgan Stanley all release earnings in the first big wave of corporate reports. There is also some important data, including CPI inflation data Tuesday and retail sales for September on Friday.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIt looks like earnings season might turn out better than expected, based on early reports,\u201d said Ed Keon, chief investment strategist at QMA. \u201cThe guidance looks pretty good. So, we have earnings season upon us, the stimulus talks go back and forth, and it looks like maybe there\u2019s a will to get something done.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; On Friday afternoon, the White House raised its offer for at stimulus package to $1.8 trillion but was still below the $2.2 trillion sought by Democrats. \u201cIt\u2019s really hard to read,\u201d said Keon.\n*****\n&gt; But he said even if there\u2019s no agreement on stimulus now, there should be a package after the election, regardless of who wins. \n*****\n&gt; \u201cI actually put some money to work in small caps on the belief if we get further stimulus either soon or a few months from now, you do want to own economically sensitive stocks,\u201d said Keon.\u201cWe\u2019re reasonably constructive on the market and valuations are not cheap, but compared to the 10-year [Treasury yield] at less than 80 basis points, stocks don\u2019t look that bad.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Stocks in the past week had their best performance since early July, with the S&amp;P 500 up 3.8% at 3,477. The small cap Russell 2000 was up 6.4%. The 10-year Treasury yield had a big move during the week from about 0.70% to as high as 0.79% Friday. Yields move opposite price, and the 10-year yield has now broken out of a range its been stuck in below 0.70%.\n*****\n&gt; Earnings could provide positive momentum for stocks, if companies continue to beat estimates at a healthy pace, like last quarter.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cQ2 reporting season saw S&amp;P 500 earnings beat at an unprecedented rate, both in terms of breadth (85%) and size (+20%), prompting historically rare, strong upgrades to forward estimates, especially for the cyclicals, and one of the strongest earnings season rallies on record,\u201d wrote Deutsche Bank strategists.\n*****\n&gt; The summer earnings rally came before the big September decline, which took the S&amp;P 500  down about 10%. The S&amp;P 500 is up more than 8% since Sept. 24.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWhile the bottom-up consensus for Q3 is for a sharp rebound in headline earnings, the bulk of it is being driven by reductions in loan loss provisions and Energy sector losses. Excluding these, underlying earnings growth is forecast to barely move up (-15% to -13%), despite rising Q3 GDP growth estimates pointing to a strong macro rebound,\u201d they noted.\n*****\n&gt; The Deutsche strategists said the question remains, however, whether the market will respond to earnings beats or election uncertainty.\n*****\n&gt; Keon said the market has been moving up as former vice president Joe Biden extended his lead in the polls because there\u2019s less chance of an uncertain outlook the more one candidate leads. According to RealClearPolitics, he was leading President Donald Trump by 9.7 percentage points, from just about  6 points at the beginning of the prior week.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think from the market\u2019s perspective, it doesn\u2019t really matter who wins, as long as we have a clear winner,\u201d said Keon. \u201cI think the direction of the polls are suggesting that we\u2019re going to have a clear winner either on election night or a few days after that. The risk of a messy contested election is going down, and the market is relieved by that.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Tom Block, Washington analyst at Fundstrat, said Trump appears to be hoping for a stimulus bill signing before the election to help his re-election effort.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThere are many moving parts here, and they\u2019re all moving in different directions,\u201d said Block. \u201cIt\u2019s not impossible a deal comes together but the pathway to a deal is not clear on Friday afternoon because of the mixed signals that have come out over the last seven days from the White House.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has opposed a large package, and the two sides have been stalemated. \u201cI think the president believes that he will be helped by having a signed ceremony at the White House approving the bill, that the optics of signing the bill that\u2019s going to send relief to people is an optic he desperately wants, and it can\u2019t hurt,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; The economic recovery is going on in the background, and some parts of the economy have shown real improvement, like housing.\n*****\n&gt; Retail sales on Friday is a good look at how the consumer has been faring, now that enhanced unemployment benefits have been gone for the past two months. Economists expect 0.6% gain in retail sales, the same as August.\n*****\n&gt; Keon said it is important to get some more help for the economy through stimulus. There is expected to be one-time payments to individuals and enhanced employment benefits.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThat would be good news for the market, if we could get more help where it is needed. We really just need to get a bridge for a more normal circumstances next year,\u201d said Keon.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/4K1MVFr.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/TogcA3z.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/LSeLvCN.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/ksFc8um.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/xCRPIpj.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/pbYmOWI.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/U3OyIJ0.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/qnhClbM.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/eD2gAHd.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/ow0caWu.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/nznrtfX.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/bm1ckAt.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Ten-Baggers Under Trump\n\n&gt; In our prior post we looked at the best and worst performing S&amp;P 500 stocks since Election Day 2016. In this post we've broadened our filter and looked at the Russell 3,000, which is an index that covers more than 98% of all publicly traded market cap in the US. Within the Russell 3,000, there are 32 stocks that are up more than 1,000% since Trump was elected. These 32 \"ten-baggers\" -- as Peter Lynch liked to call them -- are listed in the table below.\n\n&gt; At the top of the list is Enphase Energy (ENPH), which is up 8,892% since Election Day 2016. While Enphase has \"Energy\" in its company name, it's actually a Technology sector stock that \"manufactures software-driven home energy solutions that span solar generation, home energy storage and web-based monitoring and control.\" Next up is Zynex (ZYXI) with a gain of 7,211%, followed by Digital Turbine (APPS) up 5,320%. ZYXI markets itself as a \"better and safer way to manage pain\" than opiods using electrotherapy devices. APPS is an app marketing company that helps app developers get their product on as many devices as possible.\n\n&gt; Of the 16 best performing Russell 3,000 stocks since Election Day 2016, 15 come from either the Technology or Health Care sectors. XPEL is the only stock in the top ten that's not in either the Tech or Health Care sectors. Up 2,341% since Trump was elected, XPEL is a Consumer Discretionary stock whose main product is to provide auto-paint protection.\n\n&gt; Along with the names mentioned already, other notables on the list of ten-baggers under Trump include Jack Dorsey's Square (SQ), pet-food maker Freshpet (FRPT), digital health company Teladoc (TDOC), the arts and crafts social media company Etsy (ETSY), and of course, Tesla (TSLA). With a gain of 1,002% since November 8th, 2016, Tesla just barely makes the cut!\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/tenbaggers.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Best Performing Stocks Since Election Day 2016\n\n&gt; On Monday we published our asset class performance matrix showing total returns for key ETFs since Election Day 2016 (11/8/16). Today we wanted to highlight the individual stocks traded on US exchanges that have performed the best and the worst since President Trump surprised the world with a victory over Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. First off, below is a chart showing the average performance of stocks in each S&amp;P 500 sector since Election Day 2016. (These are based on stocks currently in the index and not as the index stood on 11/8/16.)\n\n&gt; As shown, the average stock in the broad S&amp;P 500 is up 67.3% since Trump was elected. Four sectors have posted stronger average returns than that -- Technology (+160.4%), Health Care (+100.3%), Consumer Discretionary (+74.6%), and Industrials (+69.9%).\n\n&gt; The Energy sector stands out like a sore thumb in the chart below. While every other sector has at least averaged double-digit percentage gains, the stocks in the Energy sector are down an average of 52.3% since Trump was elected! Other sectors that have been weaker than the broad market include Real Estate, Consumer Staples, and Financials.\n\n&gt; If you were to ask most people back in November 2016 which areas of the market should outperform under Trump and which should underperform, you'd likely see results that are the exact opposite of what has actually happened. Sectors like Energy, Real Estate, and Financials would have been expected to benefit from Trump since those are the industries he's most associated with, while Tech is a sector that's usually expected to benefit more when the Democratic party is in control.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/avgsector.png))**\n\n&gt; Looking at individual stocks, below we show the 46 stocks currently in the S&amp;P 500 that are up at least 200% since Election Day 2016. Two stocks -- Etsy (ETSY) and Advanced Micro (AMD) -- have been \"10-baggers\" with gains of more than 1,000%, while another three -- Paycom (PAYC), NVIDIA (NVDA) and DexCom (DXCM) -- are up more than 500%. Other names on the list are a who's who of the most popular stocks over the past few years, including Adobe (ADBE), Netflix (NFLX), Apple (AAPL), Amazon.com (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), salesforce.com (CRM), and PayPal (PYPL).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/bestsince16.png))**\n\n&gt; While there are 46 stocks in the S&amp;P 500 up more than 200% since Election Day 2016, there are 32 stocks that are down more than 50% over the same time frame. The Energy sector is the most represented on this list by far with 14 stocks overall and 10 of the worst 11! The only non-Energy stock in the top ten is General Electric (GE), which is down 76% since Trump was elected. Other notable losers include airlines and cruiselines like AAL, CCL, and NCLH, and consumer stocks like TAP, KHC, UAA, WBA, and LB.\n\n&gt; General Electric (GE) and Exxon Mobil (XOM) are the two names that stand out the most. Each of these stocks were at one point in time the largest company in the world, but they're both now shells of their former selves with huge losses over the last four years. Remember these two examples when you're looking at the largest companies in the world right now. Chances are a few of them will experience similar fates as GE and XOM over the next ten to twenty years.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/worstsince16.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # News High for Net New Highs\n\n&gt; Yesterday, the S&amp;P 500 closed at its highest level since only a few days after the early September high. While the index has yet to reach a new high, many individual stocks in the index have. As shown in the charts below, 11.71% of S&amp;P 500 stocks closed at a new 52-week high yesterday while no stocks closed at a new 52-week low. That makes for the second-highest net new highs reading of the pandemic with the only higher reading (17.62%) occurring just over a month ago at the last all-time high on September 2nd. Before that, the last time net new highs were as high as now was on February 19th: the last all-time high before the bear market began.\n\n&gt; As for the individual sectors, there has also been a significant pickup in the net percentage of new 52-week highs. Industrials currently has the highest reading of net new highs among the 11 sectors at 26%. Just like the broader S&amp;P 500, that is the highest since September 2nd when the net percentage of new highs rose above 30%. Consumer Discretionary is the runner up in being the sector with the highest percentage of net new highs. One distinguishing factor, though, is whereas every other sector has seen higher readings at some point since the bear market in the spring, Consumer Discretionary's current reading of 18% is tied with the reading from August 24th. On the other end of the spectrum, both Communication Services and the Energy sector have seen no new highs over the past few days. Granted, there have not been any new 52-week lows either. Meanwhile, Financials and Real Estate have both seen an uptick in net new highs, but it has been much more modest than other sectors.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/100920-Net-New-Highs.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Breadth Booming\n\n&gt; One of the most notable aspects of the rally off the late September lows has been broad participation. As shown below, breadth is very strong as the 10-day advance-decline lines for several sectors are at some of their highest levels of the past year. For the S&amp;P 500, the 10-day advance-decline line is at its highest level since June 8th. The same can be said for Communication Services, Consumer Discretionary, Financials, and Real Estate. For Consumer Staples, the sector's 10-day A/D line is at its highest level since June of 2019 and for Health Care it is at its highest level since May of 2019. In the case of Technology, it has been even longer as that sector's line is at its highest level since last April.\n\n&gt; While broad participation is healthy for the long-term prospects of a rally, these 10-Day A/D lines have gotten extremely overbought in the near term, suggesting a cool-down period is likely in the days ahead.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/100820-10-day.png))**\n\n&gt; With short term breadth running very hot, the cumulative A/D lines of several sectors are breaking out to new highs as well. Utilities and Materials are the only sectors to have seen prices reach a new high in the past few days alongside their cumulative A/D lines. As for the other sectors, Consumer Discretionary, Consumer Staples, Health Care, Materials, and Tech have also all seen new highs for cumulative breadth. The same applies to the S&amp;P 500, but again, none of these have yet to see price do the same.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/100820-cumulative-ad-f.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Election-Year October Market Performance Volatile since 1950\n\n&gt; October\u2019s history of volatility was recapped in the October Almanac as well as it being the worst performing month of election years since 1950. In the following chart we have plotted election-year October performance for DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ, Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 since 1950 (NASDAQ since 1972 and Russell indexes since 1980) alongside their historical performance excluding gruesome election-year October 2008.\n\n&gt; With or without October 2008, historical performance has been uninspiring in election years. Excluding 2008, October has generally started off on a positive note, but by around the fourth trading day, strength has tended to fade with weakness persisting until around the eighth trading day. Then a modest rally ensued through mid-month followed by more weakness and finally a rally to end the month. Grey shading highlights the two historical windows of weakness that could setup our Seasonal MACD indicators.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/9deab1b6431375946cf0104830334e3a/1b58acd0d015098f-cf/s500x750/1a07b8cea97519bcce57adae974614a0e426effb.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending October 9th, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED.)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 10.11.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED.)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/eD2gAHd.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/rotewK3.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 10.12.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 10.12.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday  10.13.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/2lSi1kT.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 10.13.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Wj80iaX.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 10.14.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ZY9TwgO.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 10.14.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/5LizPLJ.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 10.15.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/oIstn4O.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 10.15.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/uKfmmCC.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 10.16.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Q3isONG.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 10.16.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Swqo1ow.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. $101.20\n**JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, October 8, 2020**\n\nStocks rose again today, extending yesterday\u2019s frankly unexpected gains, with the major benchmarks opening at their highest levels in about a month. Market participants digested a new round of jobless claims, dimming hopes of stimulus, even for stand-alone bills, and progress in Covid-19 therapeutics following Pres. Trump\u2019s discharge from the hospital.\n\nThe Nasdaq (QQQ) finished the day 0.54% up. The S&amp;P (SPY) led the day, up 0.85% and the Dow (DIA) finished 0.48% up. \n\nToday, the Labor Department released their weekly jobless claims report. There were 840,000 additional first-time jobless claims this week, slightly above the 820,000 prediction of analysts. While 840,000 is the lowest level since March, jobless claims have stagnated the past month, a sign of slowing economic recovery. Continuing claims, which are the number of people who have already filed an initial claim and who have experienced a week of unemployment and then filed a continued claim to claim benefits for that week of unemployment, fell below 11 million, dropping almost 1 million compared to the week before. Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics said, \u201cThe decline in continuing claims is welcome, but initial claims offer a better read on the real-time state of the labor market, and the downward trend has stalled, more or less.\u201d\n\nAccording to CNBC, there are still 25.5 million workers claiming some form of unemployment benefits, according to totals through Sept. 19. More than half that total, or about 13.4 million, comes from those collecting under pandemic-related programs set up for those who normally wouldn\u2019t be eligible, showing the toll the pandemic has put on the labor market. \n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi further curbed expectations that any form of stimulus will be unleashed before the November election. Today, in response to a bill designed to provide relief to the airline industry, Pelosi said, \u201cThere is no stand-alone bill without a bigger bill.\u201d In other words, she opposes passing smaller, stand-alone stimulus bills in the absence of more comprehensive measures. Yesterday, after calling for his representatives to stop negotiations for overarching stimulus, Pres. Trump signaled he would support a smaller, targeted bill. In response to Trump\u2019s recent tweets about stimulus, Ed Mills, policy analyst at Raymond James said, \u201cIt\u2019s been the question of the day, as to why we got the tweets we got over the last 24 hours, the market reaction we got into \\[Tuesday\u2019s\\] close, and then the rally.\u201d Needless to say, the current market is hyper-responsive to the comments of Trump and other top officials.\n\nShares of Regeneron (REGN) jumped after the drugmaker said it had submitted a request to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for emergency use authorization of its Covid-19 antibody treatment, which had been taken by President Donald Trump after his Covid-19 diagnosis. In a video on Twitter today, Pres. Trump openly endorsed the move saying \u201cI took this medicine \\[during his stay at Walter Reed Hospital\\] and it was incredible.\u201d\n\nIn other nice news, the World Trade Organization (WTO) announced that South Korea\u2019s trade minister and the former Nigerian finance minister are the two finalists in the race to become the next director-general. This is the first time a woman will occupy the position of top leader in this organization. \n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Covid Relief pushes US deficit to a record $3.1T\n* AMD announced new desktop processors today that the company said will deliver significant improvements in gaming performance. The Ryzen 9 5950X chip delivers what the company described as the \u201chighest single-thread performance of any desktop gaming processor.\u201d\n* Gamestop (GME) announced that it has entered into a multi-year strategic partnership agreement with Microsoft (MSFT) to further advance its strategy to expand its physical and digital video game offerings, as well as enhance the Company\u2019s retail technology infrastructure. GME rocketed up 20% on the announcement.\n* Morgan Stanley (MS) said it is buying fund manager Eaton Vance (EV) Corp. for $7 billion, continuing the Wall Street firm's shift toward safer businesses like money management.

        "selftext": "Good Friday evening to all of you here on r/StockMarket. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning October 12th, 2020.\n\n# **Earnings could be a positive force for stocks as Washington continues to wrangle over stimulus  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/09/earnings-could-be-a-positive-force-for-stocks-as-washington-continues-to-wrangle-over-stimulus.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Stock market optimism for a stimulus package has been rising, but the focus swings to earnings and that could be a positive for stocks in the week ahead.\n*****\n&gt; JPMorgan, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, Bank of America and Morgan Stanley all release earnings in the first big wave of corporate reports. There is also some important data, including CPI inflation data Tuesday and retail sales for September on Friday.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIt looks like earnings season might turn out better than expected, based on early reports,\u201d said Ed Keon, chief investment strategist at QMA. \u201cThe guidance looks pretty good. So, we have earnings season upon us, the stimulus talks go back and forth, and it looks like maybe there\u2019s a will to get something done.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; On Friday afternoon, the White House raised its offer for at stimulus package to $1.8 trillion but was still below the $2.2 trillion sought by Democrats. \u201cIt\u2019s really hard to read,\u201d said Keon.\n*****\n&gt; But he said even if there\u2019s no agreement on stimulus now, there should be a package after the election, regardless of who wins. \n*****\n&gt; \u201cI actually put some money to work in small caps on the belief if we get further stimulus either soon or a few months from now, you do want to own economically sensitive stocks,\u201d said Keon.\u201cWe\u2019re reasonably constructive on the market and valuations are not cheap, but compared to the 10-year [Treasury yield] at less than 80 basis points, stocks don\u2019t look that bad.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Stocks in the past week had their best performance since early July, with the S&amp;P 500 up 3.8% at 3,477. The small cap Russell 2000 was up 6.4%. The 10-year Treasury yield had a big move during the week from about 0.70% to as high as 0.79% Friday. Yields move opposite price, and the 10-year yield has now broken out of a range its been stuck in below 0.70%.\n*****\n&gt; Earnings could provide positive momentum for stocks, if companies continue to beat estimates at a healthy pace, like last quarter.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cQ2 reporting season saw S&amp;P 500 earnings beat at an unprecedented rate, both in terms of breadth (85%) and size (+20%), prompting historically rare, strong upgrades to forward estimates, especially for the cyclicals, and one of the strongest earnings season rallies on record,\u201d wrote Deutsche Bank strategists.\n*****\n&gt; The summer earnings rally came before the big September decline, which took the S&amp;P 500  down about 10%. The S&amp;P 500 is up more than 8% since Sept. 24.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWhile the bottom-up consensus for Q3 is for a sharp rebound in headline earnings, the bulk of it is being driven by reductions in loan loss provisions and Energy sector losses. Excluding these, underlying earnings growth is forecast to barely move up (-15% to -13%), despite rising Q3 GDP growth estimates pointing to a strong macro rebound,\u201d they noted.\n*****\n&gt; The Deutsche strategists said the question remains, however, whether the market will respond to earnings beats or election uncertainty.\n*****\n&gt; Keon said the market has been moving up as former vice president Joe Biden extended his lead in the polls because there\u2019s less chance of an uncertain outlook the more one candidate leads. According to RealClearPolitics, he was leading President Donald Trump by 9.7 percentage points, from just about  6 points at the beginning of the prior week.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think from the market\u2019s perspective, it doesn\u2019t really matter who wins, as long as we have a clear winner,\u201d said Keon. \u201cI think the direction of the polls are suggesting that we\u2019re going to have a clear winner either on election night or a few days after that. The risk of a messy contested election is going down, and the market is relieved by that.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Tom Block, Washington analyst at Fundstrat, said Trump appears to be hoping for a stimulus bill signing before the election to help his re-election effort.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThere are many moving parts here, and they\u2019re all moving in different directions,\u201d said Block. \u201cIt\u2019s not impossible a deal comes together but the pathway to a deal is not clear on Friday afternoon because of the mixed signals that have come out over the last seven days from the White House.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has opposed a large package, and the two sides have been stalemated. \u201cI think the president believes that he will be helped by having a signed ceremony at the White House approving the bill, that the optics of signing the bill that\u2019s going to send relief to people is an optic he desperately wants, and it can\u2019t hurt,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; The economic recovery is going on in the background, and some parts of the economy have shown real improvement, like housing.\n*****\n&gt; Retail sales on Friday is a good look at how the consumer has been faring, now that enhanced unemployment benefits have been gone for the past two months. Economists expect 0.6% gain in retail sales, the same as August.\n*****\n&gt; Keon said it is important to get some more help for the economy through stimulus. There is expected to be one-time payments to individuals and enhanced employment benefits.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThat would be good news for the market, if we could get more help where it is needed. We really just need to get a bridge for a more normal circumstances next year,\u201d said Keon.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/4K1MVFr.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/TogcA3z.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/LSeLvCN.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/ksFc8um.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/xCRPIpj.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/pbYmOWI.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/U3OyIJ0.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/qnhClbM.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!]())**\n(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/ow0caWu.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/nznrtfX.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/bm1ckAt.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Ten-Baggers Under Trump\n\n&gt; In our prior post we looked at the best and worst performing S&amp;P 500 stocks since Election Day 2016. In this post we've broadened our filter and looked at the Russell 3,000, which is an index that covers more than 98% of all publicly traded market cap in the US. Within the Russell 3,000, there are 32 stocks that are up more than 1,000% since Trump was elected. These 32 \"ten-baggers\" -- as Peter Lynch liked to call them -- are listed in the table below.\n\n&gt; At the top of the list is Enphase Energy (ENPH), which is up 8,892% since Election Day 2016. While Enphase has \"Energy\" in its company name, it's actually a Technology sector stock that \"manufactures software-driven home energy solutions that span solar generation, home energy storage and web-based monitoring and control.\" Next up is Zynex (ZYXI) with a gain of 7,211%, followed by Digital Turbine (APPS) up 5,320%. ZYXI markets itself as a \"better and safer way to manage pain\" than opiods using electrotherapy devices. APPS is an app marketing company that helps app developers get their product on as many devices as possible.\n\n&gt; Of the 16 best performing Russell 3,000 stocks since Election Day 2016, 15 come from either the Technology or Health Care sectors. XPEL is the only stock in the top ten that's not in either the Tech or Health Care sectors. Up 2,341% since Trump was elected, XPEL is a Consumer Discretionary stock whose main product is to provide auto-paint protection.\n\n&gt; Along with the names mentioned already, other notables on the list of ten-baggers under Trump include Jack Dorsey's Square (SQ), pet-food maker Freshpet (FRPT), digital health company Teladoc (TDOC), the arts and crafts social media company Etsy (ETSY), and of course, Tesla (TSLA). With a gain of 1,002% since November 8th, 2016, Tesla just barely makes the cut!\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/tenbaggers.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Best Performing Stocks Since Election Day 2016\n\n&gt; On Monday we published our asset class performance matrix showing total returns for key ETFs since Election Day 2016 (11/8/16). Today we wanted to highlight the individual stocks traded on US exchanges that have performed the best and the worst since President Trump surprised the world with a victory over Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. First off, below is a chart showing the average performance of stocks in each S&amp;P 500 sector since Election Day 2016. (These are based on stocks currently in the index and not as the index stood on 11/8/16.)\n\n&gt; As shown, the average stock in the broad S&amp;P 500 is up 67.3% since Trump was elected. Four sectors have posted stronger average returns than that -- Technology (+160.4%), Health Care (+100.3%), Consumer Discretionary (+74.6%), and Industrials (+69.9%).\n\n&gt; The Energy sector stands out like a sore thumb in the chart below. While every other sector has at least averaged double-digit percentage gains, the stocks in the Energy sector are down an average of 52.3% since Trump was elected! Other sectors that have been weaker than the broad market include Real Estate, Consumer Staples, and Financials.\n\n&gt; If you were to ask most people back in November 2016 which areas of the market should outperform under Trump and which should underperform, you'd likely see results that are the exact opposite of what has actually happened. Sectors like Energy, Real Estate, and Financials would have been expected to benefit from Trump since those are the industries he's most associated with, while Tech is a sector that's usually expected to benefit more when the Democratic party is in control.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/avgsector.png))**\n\n&gt; Looking at individual stocks, below we show the 46 stocks currently in the S&amp;P 500 that are up at least 200% since Election Day 2016. Two stocks -- Etsy (ETSY) and Advanced Micro (AMD) -- have been \"10-baggers\" with gains of more than 1,000%, while another three -- Paycom (PAYC), NVIDIA (NVDA) and DexCom (DXCM) -- are up more than 500%. Other names on the list are a who's who of the most popular stocks over the past few years, including Adobe (ADBE), Netflix (NFLX), Apple (AAPL), Amazon.com (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), salesforce.com (CRM), and PayPal (PYPL).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/bestsince16.png))**\n\n&gt; While there are 46 stocks in the S&amp;P 500 up more than 200% since Election Day 2016, there are 32 stocks that are down more than 50% over the same time frame. The Energy sector is the most represented on this list by far with 14 stocks overall and 10 of the worst 11! The only non-Energy stock in the top ten is General Electric (GE), which is down 76% since Trump was elected. Other notable losers include airlines and cruiselines like AAL, CCL, and NCLH, and consumer stocks like TAP, KHC, UAA, WBA, and LB.\n\n&gt; General Electric (GE) and Exxon Mobil (XOM) are the two names that stand out the most. Each of these stocks were at one point in time the largest company in the world, but they're both now shells of their former selves with huge losses over the last four years. Remember these two examples when you're looking at the largest companies in the world right now. Chances are a few of them will experience similar fates as GE and XOM over the next ten to twenty years.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/worstsince16.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # News High for Net New Highs\n\n&gt; Yesterday, the S&amp;P 500 closed at its highest level since only a few days after the early September high. While the index has yet to reach a new high, many individual stocks in the index have. As shown in the charts below, 11.71% of S&amp;P 500 stocks closed at a new 52-week high yesterday while no stocks closed at a new 52-week low. That makes for the second-highest net new highs reading of the pandemic with the only higher reading (17.62%) occurring just over a month ago at the last all-time high on September 2nd. Before that, the last time net new highs were as high as now was on February 19th: the last all-time high before the bear market began.\n\n&gt; As for the individual sectors, there has also been a significant pickup in the net percentage of new 52-week highs. Industrials currently has the highest reading of net new highs among the 11 sectors at 26%. Just like the broader S&amp;P 500, that is the highest since September 2nd when the net percentage of new highs rose above 30%. Consumer Discretionary is the runner up in being the sector with the highest percentage of net new highs. One distinguishing factor, though, is whereas every other sector has seen higher readings at some point since the bear market in the spring, Consumer Discretionary's current reading of 18% is tied with the reading from August 24th. On the other end of the spectrum, both Communication Services and the Energy sector have seen no new highs over the past few days. Granted, there have not been any new 52-week lows either. Meanwhile, Financials and Real Estate have both seen an uptick in net new highs, but it has been much more modest than other sectors.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/100920-Net-New-Highs.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Breadth Booming\n\n&gt; One of the most notable aspects of the rally off the late September lows has been broad participation. As shown below, breadth is very strong as the 10-day advance-decline lines for several sectors are at some of their highest levels of the past year. For the S&amp;P 500, the 10-day advance-decline line is at its highest level since June 8th. The same can be said for Communication Services, Consumer Discretionary, Financials, and Real Estate. For Consumer Staples, the sector's 10-day A/D line is at its highest level since June of 2019 and for Health Care it is at its highest level since May of 2019. In the case of Technology, it has been even longer as that sector's line is at its highest level since last April.\n\n&gt; While broad participation is healthy for the long-term prospects of a rally, these 10-Day A/D lines have gotten extremely overbought in the near term, suggesting a cool-down period is likely in the days ahead.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/100820-10-day.png))**\n\n&gt; With short term breadth running very hot, the cumulative A/D lines of several sectors are breaking out to new highs as well. Utilities and Materials are the only sectors to have seen prices reach a new high in the past few days alongside their cumulative A/D lines. As for the other sectors, Consumer Discretionary, Consumer Staples, Health Care, Materials, and Tech have also all seen new highs for cumulative breadth. The same applies to the S&amp;P 500, but again, none of these have yet to see price do the same.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/100820-cumulative-ad-f.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Election-Year October Market Performance Volatile since 1950\n\n&gt; October\u2019s history of volatility was recapped in the October Almanac as well as it being the worst performing month of election years since 1950. In the following chart we have plotted election-year October performance for DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ, Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 since 1950 (NASDAQ since 1972 and Russell indexes since 1980) alongside their historical performance excluding gruesome election-year October 2008.\n\n&gt; With or without October 2008, historical performance has been uninspiring in election years. Excluding 2008, October has generally started off on a positive note, but by around the fourth trading day, strength has tended to fade with weakness persisting until around the eighth trading day. Then a modest rally ensued through mid-month followed by more weakness and finally a rally to end the month. Grey shading highlights the two historical windows of weakness that could setup our Seasonal MACD indicators.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/9deab1b6431375946cf0104830334e3a/1b58acd0d015098f-cf/s500x750/1a07b8cea97519bcce57adae974614a0e426effb.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending October 9th, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fw7sXu8pcPw))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 10.4.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED.)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!]())**\n(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/IIowf1B.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 10.12.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 10.12.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday  10.13.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/2lSi1kT.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 10.13.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Wj80iaX.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 10.14.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ZY9TwgO.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 10.14.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/5LizPLJ.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 10.15.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/oIstn4O.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 10.15.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/uKfmmCC.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 10.16.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Q3isONG.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 10.16.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Swqo1ow.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # (T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n**(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)** (T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n\n&gt; #([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](http://elite.finviz.com/chart.ashx?t=SPY&amp;ty=c&amp;ta=st_c,sch_200p,sma_50,sma_200,sma_20,sma_100,bb_20_2,rsi_b_14,macd_b_12_26_9,stofu_b_14_3_3&amp;p=d&amp;s=l))\n\n*****\n\n# DISCUSS!\n\nWhat are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?\n\n*****\n\nI hope you all have a wonderful weekend and a great trading week ahead r/StockMarket.",

I am 20, relatively risk-tolerant, and I am looking to invest a few thousand dollars to start. I plan to hold for at least 5 years. Are there any stocks in this list that seem particularly interesting to you? As a young person, Paypal (and Venmo which it owns) seems to have become a bit of a staple in my generation's life. I am seeing more and more people get Venmo cards as people seem to be putting off credit cards as there is already enough debt to worry about when it comes to the cost of college. Anyway, I would love to know your thoughts on them! \n\n1. PYPL ------&gt;\n2. SPGI ------ &gt;\n3. NVDA -----&gt;\n4. AVGO -----&gt;\n5. ABBV ------&gt;\n6. NKE -------&gt;",

The system uses its own currency, the Q, and to get people to start using the system once it's ready they are allocating Qs for free to people that sign up now (the amount drops as more people join - so better to join early). Signing up is free and they only ask for your name and an email address. There's nothing to lose but if this payment system becomes a world leading payment method your Qs can be worth a lot.

        "selftext": "LONDON \u2014 PayPal says it\u2019s launching a \u201cbuy now, pay later\u201d service in the U.K. that lets shoppers finance their purchases over three interest-free monthly instalments.\n\nThe U.S. tech giant is perhaps better known for its online payment tools, but it\u2019s been branching out into credit in the years since it acquired lending platform Bill Me Later.\n\nNow, the company is taking on the likes of Sweden\u2019s Klarna and Australia\u2019s Afterpay, whose point-of-sale loans have increased in popularity recently. It rolled out its \u201cPay in 4\u201d product in the U.S. just last month and is now following up with a separate offering for the U.K. called \u201cPay in 3.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen over last 6 months or so is a significant rise in the shift from physical to digital transactions across the whole of the U.K. retail base,\u201d Rob Harper, PayPal\u2019s U.K. director of enterprise accounts, told CNBC in an interview.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve also seen the rise of buy now, pay later solutions in the market; brands like Klarna, but also smaller brands that are entering into the market that are not as recognizable as PayPal.\u201d\n\nEurope\u2019s Top Fintech Unicorn: Klarna CEO on $10.6 billion valuation, fundraising mega-round\nPayPal is betting that brand recognition will give it an edge over competing services like Klarna, Clearpay and Laybuy. The company has grown customer accounts by 300% year-on-year in the second quarter and now has more than 24 million active users in the U.K., dwarfing Klarna\u2019s almost 10 million customers in the country.\n\nIn the U.K., PayPal\u2019s new product will offer three-month instalment plans for purchases of between \u00a345 and \u00a32,000. It\u2019s signed up a number of British retailers to offer the service, including Crew Clothing, French Connection, Robert Dyas and Ryman.\n\nHarper said the \u201cPay in 3\u201d option was chosen as Brits get paid monthly, as opposed to Americans who usually get their paychecks once a fortnight. He added that PayPal was a \u201cresponsible lender\u201d and would run \u201caffordability checks\u201d on transactions.\n\nThe move comes amid calls to regulate the fast-growing \u201cbuy now, pay later\u201d sector, with some critics concerned it could lead younger shoppers into a debt trap. But PayPal, Klarna and other such firms claim they have sufficient safeguards in place to prevent overspending.\n\n[Source](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/13/paypal-takes-aim-at-klarna-with-pay-in-3-service-for-uk-shoppers-.html)",

The slide was leaked and confirmed by [videocardz.com](https://videocardz.com) which is a very authentic source for tech news. A 16 core CPU that pulls 105w at a reasonable price will be GAME-CHANGING, and everyone will want to get their hands on it.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f4y8kvv3blq51.png?width=1569&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b0e772c7f4963cb569eb0024dcee84fb63b4697e\n\nAlong with this game-changing chip, 3 additional CPUs are rumored to be released.   \n\n\n\\#2\n\n**Big Navi having possibly better performance**  \nThere have been leaks off Newegg of Big Navi being better than the 3080. Even if the cards are neck in neck AMD will be able to paint the 6000 series cards as better due to minor discrepancies.\n\nRadeon RX 6900 XT\t5,120\t1,500\t16GB GDDR6\t512\t256-bit\t300  \n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRadeon RX 6800 XT\t3,840\t1,500\t12GB GDDR6\t384\t192-bit\t200  \n\\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRadeon RX 6700 XT\t2,560\t1,500\t6GB GDDR6\t384\t192-bit\t150  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x0zjsju2clq51.png?width=970&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=14551f974837dfc21662c24da268d5284287d169\n\n  \n\\#3\n\n**NVIDIA 3rd Party Card Catastrophe**\n\n*(this section is from my previous post)*\n\nSo most GPUs are made by a 3rd party. AMD and NVIDIA make the actual \"brain\" of the GPU but 3rd party partners add onto it for better performance (very basic explanation). Don't ask me why this is, it is just mainly because of logistical reasons.\n\nBut that is not the point, the point is that the great majority of GPUs are third-party cards meaning that they get to change around the design of the PCB. The issue here is that some of these third-party partners cheaped out on little capacitors.\n\nBy cheapening out it is leading to bad power delivery. The only way to fix this rn is to downclock the card which the normal person doesn't know how to do and doesn't expect is necessary when they are buying a 500$+ piece of hardware.\n\nI feel like if there is a mass callback that will be bad PR. NVIDIA could always release drivers that make the cards run below their listed spec but i'm not sure if people will really want that even if the performance loss is marginal.\n\nEVGA already confirmed the suspicions that these cards were crashing because of capacitor issues. It may be different for other companies but at least for EVGA this is what they are saying currently.\n\n**But why does this matter??**\n\nPeople who were looking to pick up a next-gen GPU right away are now hesitant and will wait for AMDS offerings. The people who did return their GPUs will also possibly wait. Faulty cards will most likely get a down clock which will make Big Navi look better. It supposedly already is better and this 3-5% difference could really change people's minds.  \n\n\n\\#4 \n\nLisa Su is an absolute unit. She will for sure talk about their timeline and plans for 5nm/3nm. I am guessing that this will rally investors to invest because they will see shinny 5nm/3nm while Intel is just getting to 10nm.  \n\n\n**POSITIONS:**  \n\\+95 call  (exp 12/18)  \n\\- 100 call (exp 12/18)\n\n(*call me a pussy for using a debit spread but I think its the best for my case)*  \n\n\nif you have something else you want to share comments below and I will add it!\n\nSources:\n\n[https://videocardz.com/newz/amd-ryzen-9-3950x-to-become-worlds-first-16-core-gaming-cpu](https://videocardz.com/newz/amd-ryzen-9-3950x-to-become-worlds-first-16-core-gaming-cpu)\n\n[https://www.igorslab.de/en/what-real-what-can-be-investigative-within-the-crashes-and-instabilities-of-the-force-rtx-3080-andrtx-3090/](https://www.igorslab.de/en/what-real-what-can-be-investigative-within-the-crashes-and-instabilities-of-the-force-rtx-3080-andrtx-3090/)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6bUUEEe-X8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6bUUEEe-X8)\n\n[https://www.tomshardware.com/news/evga-nvidia-rtx-3080-capacitor-caused-crashes](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/evga-nvidia-rtx-3080-capacitor-caused-crashes)\n\n[https://www.tomshardware.com/news/newegg-insider-reportedly-reveals-radeon-rx-6900-xt-rx-6800xt-rx-6700-xt-specifications](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/newegg-insider-reportedly-reveals-radeon-rx-6900-xt-rx-6800xt-rx-6700-xt-specifications)\n\n*This is not financial advice just me presenting the facts and the possibility of a callback.*  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b2ciqo9vdlq51.png?width=662&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=64d0fa79a87e74390c112a07e8d93a82c5a8476e",

        "selftext": "Hi all, \n\nI have been looking to diversify out of tech. ETFs make up 50% of my portfolio with SPY making up about 40% of it. I also have 10% in QQQ. Of my individual stocks, tech makes up about 60%. I currently have non-tech holdings in Disney, KO, ICLN, BABA, a small portion in NIO and SNE. I know SNE is tech but it does not move with the sector much and I really like this position. Any thoughts on good buys. I was really interested in BA but wanted to wait to see what happened after sept 15th and that wasn't great. Great buy but will take years so I am watching for now. Some others I have been following are V/MA, FDX (although getting pricey), J&amp;J and CVS. Another reasonable option I have been considering is putting more money into SPY and also ICLN to a lesser extent. Appreciate any input or other ideas. Thanks!",

        "selftext": "There are different ways to trade in a choppy environment. Here\u2019s a deep dive on how I attempted to use weekly options to trade a potential bounce in AMZN, and collected $.37 initially, for the possibility of making $50 more, even though the trade ended up being only an .$81 winner. \n\n# The Entry\n\nLast Thursday, 9/24, when $AMZN was trading at about $3000 a share, I was looking for a cheap way to play a bounce in the stock. During that time, my bias in the markets had begun to shift to a more bullish stance after seeing how the market had difficulty grinding lower. With that in mind, I wanted to play a potential bounce in tech. But I knew I didn\u2019t want to pay a debit at all to play for a bounce that might not even happen, given how uncertain and choppy the markets had been, but I still wanted to set myself up to capture some large gains if AMZN did indeed bounce. Therefore, the strategy that made the most sense to me, was a Call broken wing butterfly.\n\nGiven that I\u2019m a very short-term options trader who loves trading weeklies, I was trying to look for a cheap butterfly for the upcoming week that I could put on for a net credit. After exploring the options chain, I came across the +1/-2/+1 3300/3350/3450 call broken wing butterfly for the Oct 2 series. This fly, at the time (on Sept 24), was trading for a total of $.37 credit. Meaning, by putting on that butterfly, I would get paid $.37, and the following scenarios could happen:\n\n1. If AMZN decided to tank or hang out sideways and never get up close enough to the butterfly to expand the spread in my favor, then I\u2019d walk away pocketing the $.37 credit\n2. If AMZN slowly crept up to reach exactly 3350 by expiration, I\u2019d not only get to keep the credit, but also be able to sell the butterfly back out for $50. Of course, it doesn\u2019t need to reach exactly 3350 by expiration. If AMZN slowly worked its way up to near 3300, then the butterfly would expand very nicely as well.\n3. If AMZN blew past 3400 by expiration, I\u2019d see a loss, up to a maximum of $50 / spread (if $AMZN moves past 3450). That\u2019s because the 3300/3350 long call vertical of the fly provides 50 points of coverage before I essentially start losing money from the 3350/3450 short vertical, up until that 3450 kicks in to cap off further upside losses.\n\nSo that is a rough outline of the potential scenarios that would happen with this trade. \n\nGiven the choppy market conditions, I was ok with risking $50/spread (point #3), in order to not lose money if I\u2019m wrong on direction (point #1), while at the same time, keeping myself open to the possibility of the butterfly expanding in my favor (point #2) for some potentially very large gains. \n\nBut satisfying point #3 is tricky. I needed more data points suggesting that $AMZN wouldn\u2019t surge higher early on in the trade. Because if $AMZN did surge higher early on in the trade, then while the 3300 long call would rise in value, those two 3350 short calls would also rise in value, and because there\u2019d still be some time value left, they could be very juiced up and eat away at the profits of that 3300 long call, so much so that the 3450 long call won\u2019t even be able to offset those losses, especially given how far out of the money that 3450 call is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[AMZN on 9\\/24, daily timeframe](https://preview.redd.it/fvqvwaeh6xq51.png?width=4096&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=844361115e2cba2ef284b41c734751b7162c77fa)\n\nLooking at the chart above on 9/24, we can see that AMZN was trading at around $3000/share. In order to reach $3300 (where the first long call of the broken wing butterfly is), the stock would need to\n\n1. Breach the 38% fib retracement (\\~AMZN=3131) of the move from the 9/2 high to the 9/21 low, \n2. Breach the 20MA and 50MA\n3. Breach the 50% fib retracement (\\~AMZN=3211)\n4. Breach the 61.8% fib retracement (\\~AMZN=3292)\n\nbefore finally reaching the 3300 long call. All of these levels, I felt, should provide some resistance for AMZN to have to chew thru over the following week, before it even gets to the long call. And by that time, if AMZN did reach 3300, then the 3300 long call would still have a lot of extrinsic value left (somewhere around $20 on the last day), while the 3350 short calls would be very cheap (each around $5), so the entire spread could be roughly worth $10. Which would be great, because that means I\u2019d be getting paid $.37 to make another $10. \n\nSo with all of the above considered, I chose to take on that upside risk, for a chance to make potentially $50 (realistically I try to aim for just half of the max profit: $25, and start harvesting profits and peeling off the flies at around $5-$10), and that day on 9/24, entered the Oct2 3300/3350/3450 call broken wing butterfly for a $.37 credit. \n\nAfter entry, on Friday 9/25 and Monday 9/28, AMZN made steady progress upwards, from 3000 to 3175, breaching the 31.8% retracement and tagging the 20MA and 50MA from below.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[AMZN on 9\\/28, daily timeframe](https://preview.redd.it/qhbap1di6xq51.png?width=4096&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8dbb881ff54b0738a915407b66acc041292bf4af)\n\nbut this move wasn\u2019t large and fast enough to expand the value of the 3350 short calls. In fact, theta did a great job draining those short calls, while the 3300 long call did a good job retaining its premium, so the butterfly had already expanded a bit in my favor, and I was sitting at about a small $1.00 profit.\n\n# The Adjustment\n\nHowever, on Tuesday and Wednesday, AMZN began to stall out. By the end of Wednesday 9/30, when it looked like AMZN was putting in a topping tail, I decided that AMZN might not be able to make it near 3300 by expiration Friday, so I wanted to take in a bit more credit while I still could, before theta drained more of that 3300 long call. At the time, the spread was trading for almost $2.\n\nThat\u2019s when I made a slight adjustment to the spread and sold the 3300/3310 call vertical. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[AMZN on 9\\/30, daily timeframe](https://preview.redd.it/mvsrotaj6xq51.png?width=4096&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3c2642107f30c304964a59d5dc24ea636622e52a)\n\nThis essentially rolled the 3300 long call up to 3310, and I was able to collect a small $.44 credit for it. However, this adjustment did open me up to an additional $10 of risk to the upside, because now, the long call vertical portion of the butterfly is only $40 wide (instead of $50). Still, with only 2 days left for AMZN to go higher, I felt comfortable taking on a bit more upside risk knowing that theta is going to be working hard to drain those 3350 short calls if AMZN did decide to surge higher. And at that moment, I actually wanted AMZN to move more towards my fly. My deltas were still positive, and the risk graph showed that a move towards the short strikes of the fly would expand it by another $4-5 by Thursday. \n\nSo after this adjustment, the trade stood at a $.81 credit, and the profit potential on the fly was now $40 instead of $50. Which is still pretty good.\n\n# The Tease\n\nOn Thursday, AMZN showed some strength and closed above the 50% fib (3211), which meant that if on Friday, AMZN worked its way up to around 3300, the fly could potentially be worth $5-10. Things were looking good (on any continued bullishness, the next target for AMZN was the 61.8% fib retracement at \\~3300). So I left the trade alone without making any more adjustments. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[AMZN on 10\\/1, daily timeframe](https://preview.redd.it/lrtmt80k6xq51.png?width=4096&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8134eed2543798ec4ad22d88c8a0742f9ed4a011)\n\n# The Flop\n\nUnfortunately, on Thursday night, news broke out that Trump was diagnosed with Coronavirus, and the market fell lower. By the open, AMZN was already trading at around 3150, roughly 150 points below the fly. The spread had instantly lost all of its value, so I basically let it expire worthless and walked away pocketing the $.81 credit. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mpwrkjpk6xq51.png?width=4096&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8dd7f4da7b000b2266ab57a3c23c1863f9423704\n\nWhile the trade did not work out as well as I had liked, the important thing to note is that I was able to get paid even when the trade didn\u2019t go in my favor. With options, there are ways to trade an underlying to a certain target without ponying up a debit, albeit at the cost of introducing tail risk, while offering the possibility of very large upside. This may be a style of trading that one can consider employing when the outlook of the markets is uncertain, as long as the trader is willing to make the necessary adjustments to control risk. \n\nWhich leads me to the following section: \n\n# FAQ \n\n&gt;What if AMZN decided to surge very early on during the trade? What if AMZN had surged to 3300 with 4-5 DTE, hence juicing up the short calls and causing the butterfly to take on large negative deltas?\n\nEven though the position would be very theta positive, I would pony up the debit to cap off the upside risk by buying the 3400/3450 call vertical, hence turning the 3300/3350/3450 broken wing butterfly into the 3300/3350/3400 balanced butterfly. From there on out until expiration, I would look for ways to reduce the debit incurred from that adjustment. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;But what if AMZN tanked afterwards? You could end up getting whipsawed.\n\nI\u2019d rather be safe than sorry and make the necessary adjustments to avoid getting run over, because I don\u2019t like playing the hope card. I could always undo the adjustment and look for ways to collect back more credit (at the cost of introducing risk elsewhere), depending on my new directional bias on AMZN at the time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Your maximum loss is so large, $5000. I\u2019d never make that bet, I would never risk $5000 to make $5000. \n\nThis style of trading is not for everyone. There are different ways to perceive risk. I don't really think of risk as binary as \u201cmax gain vs max loss\u201d. If the trade goes against me, I\u2019m not going to open myself up to the possibility of eating the maximum loss. I\u2019m going to manage that risk and make sure that I don\u2019t lose any money at all on the trade. Basically, I\u2019m not going to just put on the trade, walk away to the prayer room, and come back at expiration and hope that AMZN expired at 3350.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Why not just join thetagang and slap on iron condors / credit spreads in this environment? You could\u2019ve collected more credit by selling a 50 point wide put vertical with your bounce thesis. \n\nDifferent traders have different styles. I personally don\u2019t like pure premium selling strategies. I\u2019d rather have long options in front of the shorts to open myself up for some large upside and convexity in the P/L curve, rather than limit myself to the concavity of pure premium selling strategies. Having long options in front of the shorts also helps me sleep better at night.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;It\u2019s hard to read this. Is there a more visual explanation? \n\nHere\u2019s a video on it: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uq76fZ3EME](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uq76fZ3EME)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*TL;DR - I used weekly options to trade a potential bounce in AMZN, and got paid $.37 initially to do so, for the possibility of making $50 more. While the trade did not pan out, I walked away pocketing $.81 for being wrong.*",

        "selftext": "The time for Hyliion's \"IPO\" (HYLN) has come.\n\n**About Hyliion**\n\nThe company description below comes from a recent Business Wire article.  I can't provide the link as a certain other company can't be mentioned in the link itself:\n\n&gt; Hyliion\u2019s mission is to be the leading provider of electrified powertrain solutions for the commercial vehicle industry. Hyliion\u2019s goal is to reduce the carbon intensity and GHG emissions of the transportation sector by providing electrified powertrain solutions for Class 8 commercial vehicles at the lowest total cost of ownership (TCO). Hyliion\u2019s solutions utilize its proprietary battery systems, control software and data analytics combined with fully integrated electric motors and power electronics, to produce electrified powertrain systems that either augment\u2014in the case of Hyliion\u2019s Hybrid systems\u2014or fully replace\u2014in the case of the fully electric Hypertruck ERX system\u2014traditional diesel or natural gas fueled powertrains and improve their performance. By reducing both GHG emissions and TCO, Hyliion\u2019s environmentally conscious solutions support its customers\u2019 pursuit of their sustainability and financial objectives.\n\n**Investor Presentation**\n\nAs someone else wrote here, [Hyliion (HYLN) is not the next Nikola.  This is a good thing.](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/j03etb/hyliion_hyln_is_not_the_next_nikola_this_is_a/)\n\nThe company's Investor Presentation can be found [here](https://rpn113p35qekzef7411kp2qt-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Hyliion-Tortoise-Overview-Presentation.pdf).\n\nAs can be shown in the presentation:\n\n1) HYLN has its defined niche: Class 8 trucks.  Not even Tesla will be competing in this field, for a decade or more.\n\n2) HYLN has a total addressable market of $800 billion in the US alone.  One customer, Agility, operates in 100 countries.\n\n3) HYLN won't play the capital-intensive game of setting up EV-related infrastructure.  They are not in the business of being a \"gas station.\"\n\n4) HYLN will first use renewable natural gas and natural gas generators for its Hypertruck electrified powertrain systems, yet is already developing them to be compatible with fully electric solutions such as hydrogen fuel cells.  They are being practical here in addressing the needs of original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) of trucks (for the trucking industry).\n\n5) HYLN already has operational prototypes.\n\n6) HYLN already has million-mileage logs for the first number of trucks already deployed.\n\n**Renewable Natural Gas**\n\n[An article on FreightWaves](https://www.freightwaves.com/news/nikola-hyliion-defend-divergent-paths-to-zero-emission-trucking) provides a brief summary of what renewable natural gas is:\n\n&gt; Renewable natural gas (RNG) starts as a biogas from the decomposition of organic matter, such as wastewater, food, green waste and farming. It is cleaned and processed into biomethane that is injected into the pipeline. When used as a transportation fuel, RNG has a negative carbon intensity, said Deanna Haines, director of Energy &amp; Environmental Policy at SoCalGas.\n\nRNG production is expected to [double in the near future](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WnTNJZTqo4&amp;feature=youtu.be).\n\nInfrastructure-wise, there are plenty of natural gas stations in Europe.  For example, Italy has over 1,400, while Germany has over 800.\n\n**Battery Management Supply Chain**\n\nTwo years ago, Hyliion [acquired Gentherm's battery division](https://www.freightwaves.com/news/equipment/hyliion-acquires-battery-producer) to have its battery management supply chain in-house.\n\n**Financials**\n\nFuture-oriented revenue data (projections), per the Investor Presentation, are as follows:\n\n2020: $1 million\n\n2021: $8 million\n\n2022: $344 million\n\n2023: $1.0 billion\n\n2024: $2.1 billion\n\nNot every target company in a reverse merger discloses current or historical financial information.  In this case, however, [such information can be found in an SEC filing](https://sec.report/Document/0001213900-20-022028/?__cf_chl_jschl_tk__=c38d42b8c68dad4fd4c816b5799dca4bdbe435aa-1601600373-0-Ae7hxOZAy6LXjWjw6G7Ra_bQuy3Ig2re0xzZ8HVp3NVtRg9gOZ5UW-0RpnGg7RMobRYDNgh92m3CLI6_6k-MCw37XKHDzhqXsb7mFT7iOpdy6MWA5MmZDeLPzdmwjftk-8c17hucybdmgOAOT2jSXkLq8EKx3JW11mzOSq1OdzbNrRlsDNo4PBbPshX1D7_0H_3jIyGFkesJQTFSKlqU5VgiVIsKYwGqGh0xUOpq9apt1EOGGQh4UPw7ZpYFYlJduNqSM48x8ZtJn3L4CTdkTRbBINYlTg0c4elHQXkcxtIQpP1bCLZ1aMTRwKqmtTNDSMhiMj0Tv0EMfU5lBYL_xHNul5htXHIinMHI7D2xxBGW8VfbbFp1gRuuUJoeZylFnw#ta_006).\n\n**Values and Governance**\n\nHyliion has just committed to its reverse merger while having a non-classified board.  It's one thing to assert that the company isn't conducive to fraud like Nikola has been (such as plastic model vehicles with no operating prototypes, or fake orders).  It's quite another to demonstrate this.\n\nOne of the problems Nikola has is having a classified board.  In the long run, a classified board isn't as effective as a non-classified board.  This comparison extends to fraud prevention.\n\n**Stock Price Disadvantages**\n\nBeing an engineer by background, Thomas Healy does not have the marketing skills of Trevor Milton.\n\nWhile Hyliion itself has the potential to break away from the Nikola drama, HYLN's price will likely remain quite dependent upon TSLA's price movements, just like all the other stocks in the EV space.  Any out-of-control tweet by Elon Musk, let alone any performance hiccup over at Tesla, could have adverse effects on HYLN.\n\n**Stock Price Advantages**\n\nEven I expected a second wave of COVID-19 to have a correction effect on tech stocks.  I was mistaken in this regard, as large institutional funds have rotated back into the tech sector, including that part of it which is future-tech oriented (TSLA, SHOP, FSLY, ZM, etc.).\n\n**Evaluation**\n\nHYLN is a solid hold for at least five years, maybe even ten.  It is definitely worth a starter position first thing in the morning, and an additional position or two later in the day, for DCA purposes.\n\n*Disclosure: Long on shares and warrants.*",

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning October 5th, 2020.\n\n# **Stocks fall following Trump\u2019s positive virus test, but close off the worst levels on stimulus hopes  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/01/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)**\n*****\n&gt; U.S. stocks fell in volatile trading on Friday after President Donald Trump\u2019s coronavirus diagnosis fueled concerns about the election and a worsening pandemic.\n*****\n&gt; Major averages clawed back some of the steep losses after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi signaled aid for the airline industry could be coming soon, perhaps even as part of a much-anticipated broad relief bill.\n*****\n&gt; The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 134.09 points, or 0.5%, lower at 27,682.81 after dropping 430 points at its session low. The S&amp;P 500 slid 1.0%, or 32.36 points, to 3,248.44 after falling as much as 1.7% earlier. The Nasdaq Composite declined 2.2%, or 251.49 points, to 11,075.02.\n*****\n&gt; Shares of airlines jumped higher in unison after Pelosi called on the industry to delay furloughs, saying relief for airline workers is \u201cimminent.\u201d American Airlines and United erased earlier losses and popped 3.3% and 2.4%, respectively.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe will either enact Chairman DeFazio\u2019s bipartisan stand-alone legislation or achieve this as part of a comprehensive negotiated relief bill, extending for another six months the Payroll Support Program,\u201d Pelosi said in a statement.\n*****\n&gt; Earlier Friday, Pelosi said Trump\u2019s illness changed the dynamic of stimulus talks, adding lawmakers will find the \u201cmiddle ground\u201d and will \u201cget the job done.\u201d The House passed the $2.2 trillion Democratic coronavirus stimulus bill Thursday night, while Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has offered a $1.6 trillion package.\n*****\n&gt; Still, the president\u2019s diagnosis added more uncertainty to the election, an event that was already weighing on the market and keeping traders on edge as they attempted to evaluate the possible outcomes. It also raised concerns about a second wave of the virus and a slower reopening.\n*****\n&gt; White House physician Dr. Sean Conley said in a memo, \u201cThe President and First Lady are both well at this time, and they plan to remain at home within the White House during their convalescence.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Conley also said he expects Trump to \u201ccontinue carrying out his duties without disruption while recovering.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; White House chief of staff Mark Meadows said Friday Trump was having \u201cmild\u201d symptoms after testing positive for the virus and that he and Melania are in \u201cgood spirits.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; The Trump campaign announced that all events involving the president\u2019s participation are going virtual or being temporarily postponed.\n*****\n&gt; Vice President Mike Pence and second lady Karen Pence have both tested negative for the coronavirus, Pence\u2019s spokesman said Friday. Mnuchin has also tested negative, the Treasury\u2019s assistant secretary for public affairs said Friday.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThis October surprise raises the already high level of political uncertainty markets are dealing with as Election Day approaches,\u201d said Jeff Buchbinder, equity strategist at LPL Financial. \u201cMarkets appear to be increasingly pricing Joe Biden in as the favorite, and this news may not change that, but Trump could gain support from a quick recovery.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; The Trump tweet initially knocked down Dow futures more than 500 points in overnight trading.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIt really brings into stark reality that we are potentially going into \u2026 a second wave,\u201d said Jeff Henriksen, co-founder and CEO of Thorpe Abbotts Capital, to CNBC\u2019s \u201cSquawk Box Europe.\u201d \u201cPresident Trump getting this really highlights that in a way that I think it will focus attention back on the virus and the effects it will have.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Technology shares led the declines on Friday with Apple, Amazon, Microsoft and Facebook all losing more than 2.5%. Tech stocks could come under pressure under a Democratic sweep scenario if it leads to higher tax rates and tighter regulations, many strategists have said. Investors also could rotate out of technology shares and into more cyclical stocks if a stimulus is passed.\n*****\n&gt; Also weighing on the sentiment was a worse-than-expected September jobs report. Nonfarm payroll rose by 661,000 in September, the Labor Department said Friday in the final jobs report before the November election. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones expected a jobs gain of 800,000. The unemployment rate fell to 7.9% last month.\n*****\n&gt; The sell-off in oil prices intensified as Trump\u2019s coronavirus news added to the industry\u2019s demand concerns. West Texas Intermediate crude, the U.S. oil benchmark, slid 4.3% to $37.05 per barrel on Friday.\n*****\n&gt; Some on Wall Street said the markets overreacted to Trump\u2019s medical condition.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cInvestors should not panic over the news,\u201d Sean Darby, global equity strategist at Jefferies, said in a note. \u201cIt was a tail risk since other global leaders have contracted the virus, but the forthcoming US election should not be delayed in any way... 2020 has seen many 2, 3, and even 4 sigma events, and this political tail risk is by no means as big.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Stocks have staged a historic rebound since the economic shutdown sent stocks tumbling in March. But the major averages all finished September lower, snapping a five-month win streak, as doubts emerge about the pace and breadth of the recovery.\n*****\n&gt; Despite Friday\u2019s weakness, major averages all posted modest gains for the week. The 30-stock Dow gained 1.9%, while the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq rose 1.5% each this week.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/3J0V6o1.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/TI8ImmZ.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/90v084y.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/Ne7m07y.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/0UZt0DJ.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/HA7KsPc.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/NzmRLPp.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/eqS3Lk4.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!]())**\n(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/k9v1hZX.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/UtkozzH.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/KNI9qkQ.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/OM44UFj.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Make Up Your !@#$%^&amp;* Mind!\n\n&gt; We've all had versions of this conversation where you or the person you were talking to just couldn't make up their mind. At the end of the day, it only causes trouble and plans are ruined.\n\n&gt; The market is having its own back and forth this year trying to decide between growth and value. Just today, growth stocks are getting slaughtered while value stocks are up marginally. As an example, the Russell 1000 Growth index is down 1.8% on the day while the Russell 1000 Value index has managed to rally 0.25%. The chart below shows the daily performance spread between the Russell 1000 Growth index and the Russell 1000 Value index for each day in 2020. Today's performance spread between the two indices marks the ninth time this year that value has outperformed growth by more than two percentage points. At the other extreme, there have also been eight trading days where growth outperformed value by more than two percentage points.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/010220-Value-Growth-2020.png))**\n\n&gt; So how does this year's frequency of days where the performance spread between the two indices was more than two percentage points stack up to other years? The chart below shows the daily performance spread between the two indices going all the way back to 1990. Over the last thirty years, the only two periods where we saw a frequency of these large daily dislocations was back in 2008 and the period spanning 2000 and 2001. In fact, with 17 days this year where the performance spread between the two indices was greater than two percentage points, the only other years that saw a higher frequency of large dislocations were 2000 (54) and 2001 (28). If you think the market has been indecisive this year, in 2000 we saw these types of daily dislocations an average of once per week.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/010220-Value-Growth-All-Years.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Election Anxiety Weighs on October Market Performance\n\n&gt; October often evokes fear on Wall Street as memories are stirred of crashes in 1929, 1987, the 554-point drop on October 27, 1997, back-to-back massacres in 1978 and 1979, Friday the 13th in 1989 and the 733-point drop on October 15, 2008. During the week ending October 10, 2008, Dow lost 1,874.19 points (18.2%), the worst weekly decline in our database going back to 1901, in percentage terms. March 2020 now holds the dubious honor of producing the worst, second and third worst DJIA weekly point declines. The term \u201cOctoberphobia\u201d has been used to describe the phenomenon of major market drops occurring during the month. Market calamities can become a self-fulfilling prophecy, so stay on the lookout and don\u2019t get whipsawed if it happens.\n\n&gt; But October has become a turnaround month\u2014a \u201cbear killer\u201d if you will. Twelve post-WWII bear markets have ended in October: 1946, 1957, 1960, 1962, 1966, 1974, 1987, 1990, 1998, 2001, 2002 and 2011 (S&amp;P 500 declined 19.4%). However, eight were midterm bottoms. Over the last 21 years, October\u2019s performance has been solid. Average gains over the last 21-years range from 1.3% by Russell 1000 to 2.4% by NASDAQ. Small caps have still struggled though with Russell 2000 gaining a modest 0.5%\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/aba6ebb2f208cb4b7a30b5ef83275d92/74b7a456a8bd8bcd-fc/s400x600/fb3400cc8b8054a896bd8e031be58ee2872d9e24.jpg))**\n\n&gt; Election-year Octobers rank dead last for Dow, S&amp;P 500 (since 1952), NASDAQ (since 1972), Russell 1000, and Russell 2000 (since 1980). Eliminating gruesome 2008 from the calculation provides a moderate amount of relief, as rankings climb to mid pack. Should a meaningful decline materialize in October it is likely to be an excellent buying opportunity, especially for any depressed technology and small-cap shares.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # What Have Democratic Sweeps Meant for the S&amp;P 500?\n\n&gt; Headed into the first presidential debate Tuesday night, betting markets (ElectionBettingOdds.com) placed Democratic candidate Joe Biden as the slight favorite to take the White House in November. The debate resulted in Biden gaining another 5 percentage point chance of winning the Presidency. As of this morning, Biden's odds to win are at 59.8% versus Trump's odds of 38.9%. Additionally, Democrats are slight favorites to win control of the Senate (58.4% to 41.5%) and big favorites to maintain the House (82.8% to 17.1%). Given these odds, in the chart below we show the average performance of the S&amp;P 500 from the three months before Election Day through three months after Election Day for all election years post-WWII that resulted in a sweep of the executive and legislative branch by the Democrats.\n\n&gt; As shown, on average the S&amp;P 500 has been on the decline in the weeks leading up to Election Day, though in the days just before the Election there has been a small rally that sharply reverses once the results come in. After the initial post-Election drop, the market has trended a bit higher, but by three months after the Election, it has only found itself around the same levels as Election Day; on average a 2.6% loss versus where the index stood three months prior.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/09/093020-Dem-Sweeps3.png))**\n\n&gt; The composite shown above is comprised of six different years: 1948, 1960, 1964, 1976, 1992, and 2008. While on average the S&amp;P 500 has traded lower, it is not necessarily a sure-fire thing. For example, 1948 and 2008 were the only years that saw the S&amp;P 500 trade and stay significantly lower in the wake of the election. In 1976, there was similarly a sell-off in the immediate aftermath of the election, but the index did make its way back up to the highs of that six-month time frame later on albeit no new high was put in place. Meanwhile, 1960, 1964, and 1992 all saw the S&amp;P 500 run higher after the election even despite some periods of consolidation after initial moves higher. In our B.I.G. Tips report from Tuesday, we show these same charts for all Presidential election years post WWII including a look at the average performance given every potential election outcome.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/09/093020-Dem-Sweeps.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # How Current Returns Stack Up to History\n\n&gt; Even after September's weakness, the S&amp;P 500's trailing 12-month total return stood at an impressive 14.9%. Given the events of the last 12 months, one could even say that performance is remarkable. What's even crazier is that the S&amp;P 500's performance over the last 12 months is more than three times stronger than the 12 month period before that (+4.25%). The chart below compares the S&amp;P 500's annualized total returns over the last one, two, five, ten, and twenty years and compares that performance to the historical average return of the index over those same time periods.\n\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500's historical average 12-month return is 11.7%, so the current 14.9% gain exceeds that average by more than three full percentage points. Over a two-year window, though, the S&amp;P 500's annualized return of 9.4% is more than a full percentage point below the historical average. Looking further out, the S&amp;P 500's trailing five and ten-year annualized return has been much stronger than average, which makes sense given the long bull market we were in. Over a 20 year window, though, the S&amp;P 500 is only just starting to work off some of the declines from the dot-com bust and as a result, the 6.4% annualized gain is a four and a half percentage points below the long-term average of 10.9%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/100120-Monthly-Returns.png))**\n\n&gt; Below we show how the current performance of the S&amp;P 500 in each of the time frames shown compares to all other periods on a percentile basis. The S&amp;P 500's performance over the last year, ranks just below 56th percentile of all other periods, while the two-year performance ranks just below the 42nd percentile. Even as the five and ten-year periods have seen well above average returns, they still rank in just the mid-60s on a percentile basis. The S&amp;P 500's ranking over a 20-year time period is a completely different story ranking in single-digits on a percentile basis. Even with the equity market right near record highs, the last two decades have been forgettable for US equities.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/100120-Monthly-Returns-Ranks.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Seasonals Are Back In Style Again\n\n&gt; There is no denying that market seasonality has not worked so well this year. But we have been here before and history is on our side. Over the long term, intermediate term and short term market seasonality has suffered brief periods when seasonality was overridden by more powerful forces. The COVID pandemic and economic shutdown certainly qualifies. But it is only a matter of time until repetitive human behavior patterns and people and institutions return to moving money around in the usual daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly and seasonal patterns.\n\n&gt; The return of perennial September weakness is emblematic of a return to normal market behavior and a reflection of the fact that despite the continuing concerns about surges in coronavirus cases life is beginning to return to normal. In our area, about 25-30 miles north of New York City, our kids are beginning hybrid learning, playing rugby, lacrosse and other sports (yes with some COVID protocols, but tackling and facing-off), golf outings are happening and people are going to restaurants and out and about.\n\n&gt; The chart here shows the historical One-Year Pattern of the S&amp;P 500 Since 1950 versus 2020. The black line shows the seasonal pattern since 1950. The blue represents the pattern since 1988. We use 1988 as it is the first year after the 1987 Crash when the market underwent a major systemic change with the implementation of downside protection circuit breakers and collars. It is noteworthy how the seasonal pattern persists during both the 70-year and 31-year timeframes.\n\n&gt; 2020 is plotted on the right axis due to the magnitude of the move this year. The yellow box highlights the rebirth of seasonality this September, especially during this notoriously negative Week After Triple Witching Week as detailed page 108 of the 2020 Almanac, indicated by the two black arrows\n\n&gt; Years like 1980, 1982, 2009 and 2016 with unseasonably early weakness and bear markets like 2020 returned to normal seasonal patterns in short order. And years like 1954, 1958, 1980, 1982, 1995 and 2009 that exhibited double-digit gains in the Worst Six Months still proceeded to deliver further sizable gains in the subsequent Best Six Months (page 52, STA 2020). We believe the return of market seasonality is upon us. So remain cautious through the end of September and be alert to Octoberophobia, but remain ready to pounce on our Best Months Seasonal MACD Buy Signal, when it triggers.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/0a4a6ba18e7d903b198c8fa7d6cf8bc4/9c2d30c4da9ff340-d7/s500x750/eb0c36b5ff7eec394f463ca8420054c22a88010f.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending October 2nd, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiTS26b5YO8))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 10.4.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED.)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!]())**\n(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/DuBcN1Z.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 10.5.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 10.5.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday  10.6.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/zy3ktow.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 10.6.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/pt0NiLh.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 10.7.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/yaviiRp.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 10.7.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Vdaqsaj.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 10.8.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ipdesH4.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 10.8.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 10.9.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 10.9.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # (T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n**(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)** (T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n\n&gt; #([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](http://elite.finviz.com/chart.ashx?t=SPY&amp;ty=c&amp;ta=st_c,sch_200p,sma_50,sma_200,sma_20,sma_100,bb_20_2,rsi_b_14,macd_b_12_26_9,stofu_b_14_3_3&amp;p=d&amp;s=l))\n\n*****\n\n# DISCUSS!\n\nWhat are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?\n\n*****\n\nI hope you all have a wonderful weekend and a great trading week ahead r/StockMarket.",

        "selftext": "Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/smallstreetbets. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning October 5th, 2020.\n\n# **Trump\u2019s health and fiscal stimulus fight will steer the markets in the week ahead  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/02/trumps-health-and-the-fiscal-s.html)**\n*****\n&gt; President Donald Trump\u2019s health and the state of a fiscal stimulus package will be the main focus for markets in the coming week.\n*****\n&gt; In the early morning hours Friday, President Donald Trump tweeted that he and the first lady tested positive for Covid. Stocks sold off hard, but the S&amp;P 500 came off its lows in Friday trading and closed down just under 1%. It was up 1.5% for the week.\n*****\n&gt; The market was helped by signs that a stimulus package is still a possibility, after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi asked airlines not to furlough workers. She promised either a stand alone aid bill, or a bigger negotiated relief legislation that would help the industry.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe market is going to watch health updates from the White House medical staff, and it\u2019s going to watch how the president communicates with the public,\u201d said Julian Emanuel, head of equities and derivatives at BTIG. \u201cWill we see him in person in the next week in any form? What\u2019s his volume of tweets? All as a way to first gauge the severity of the case.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Trump and Melania Trump are reported to have mild cases, but as time goes on the market will turn to how the illness could impact the presidential election.\n*****\n&gt; Former Vice President Joe Biden gained slightly in the polls after the first debate Tuesday night, and now the calendar for further debates is in question. The market has seemingly warmed to Biden, and even though he would raise taxes, it is assumed Democrats would quickly pass a major infrastructure package if there is a Democratic sweep of Congress.\n*****\n&gt; Trump, however, is widely seen on Wall Street as stronger on the economy and better for markets.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWhat you\u2019ve done from a campaign perspective, is you\u2019ve taken away the thing that gives him the most energy - his ability to interact with crowds,\u201d said Emanuel. \u201cThe president had wanted to paint the economic recovery of the last three or four months as the cornerstone, and this basically puts the virus back as topic number 1, number 2 and number 3. And it\u2019s all the more so because the data is coming in weaker than expected.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; The market is fixated on the prospect of stimulus to help business, the unemployed and state and local governments. The House passed a $2.2 trillion package this week, but there is still no agreement with Republicans. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has pushed for a $1.6 trillion package.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think there\u2019s an underlying bid under the market because nobody wants to be super short if we get a stimulus approved, but you can\u2019t be too long in case his mild symptoms turn into severe symptoms,\u201d said Scott Redler, partner with T3live.com. \u201cWe\u2019re in a tough spot but overall we\u2019re still pretty constructive.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Emanuel said the fact the president is now ill could hurt confidence and slow down some of the improvement in the economy.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe underlying tone is, again, whether its directly or later, there\u2019s going to be stimulus,\u201d Emanuel said. \u201d\u2019Whether it\u2019s this month or November, this reinforces the need for stimulus because the president falling ill signals to, at the margin, the person whose thinking about going out to dinner to think again. It\u2019s a significant economic and psychological hindrance.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Also coming up in the week ahead is a speech Tuesday by Fed Chairman Jerome Powell to the National Association of Business Economists.\n*****\n&gt; Powell is also expected to push for the stimulus package to boost the economy so the recovery does not stall.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think his whole objective is to try to get Congress and the Administration to sign onto a fiscal rescue package,\u201d said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics. \u201cHe\u2019ll all but come out and say [the recovery] is not a \u2018V.\u2019 Without additional support from lawmakers, risks are pretty high that we backtrack. I think that\u2019s the kind of outlook he\u2019s going to give. It\u2019s going to be full-throated.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; September\u2019s employment report, released Friday, was seen by some as a warning that the economy is not rebounding as expected. There were 661,000 jobs added in September, well below the 800,000 expected.\n*****\n&gt; Besides Powell, there are a half dozen other Fed speakers. There are also minutes from the Fed\u2019s last minute released Wednesday afternoon.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/3J0V6o1.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/TI8ImmZ.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/90v084y.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/Ne7m07y.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/0UZt0DJ.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/HA7KsPc.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/NzmRLPp.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/eqS3Lk4.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/UBfJMYm.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/k9v1hZX.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/UtkozzH.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/KNI9qkQ.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/OM44UFj.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Make Up Your !@#$%^&amp;* Mind!\n\n&gt; We've all had versions of this conversation where you or the person you were talking to just couldn't make up their mind. At the end of the day, it only causes trouble and plans are ruined.\n\n&gt; The market is having its own back and forth this year trying to decide between growth and value. Just today, growth stocks are getting slaughtered while value stocks are up marginally. As an example, the Russell 1000 Growth index is down 1.8% on the day while the Russell 1000 Value index has managed to rally 0.25%. The chart below shows the daily performance spread between the Russell 1000 Growth index and the Russell 1000 Value index for each day in 2020. Today's performance spread between the two indices marks the ninth time this year that value has outperformed growth by more than two percentage points. At the other extreme, there have also been eight trading days where growth outperformed value by more than two percentage points.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/010220-Value-Growth-2020.png))**\n\n&gt; So how does this year's frequency of days where the performance spread between the two indices was more than two percentage points stack up to other years? The chart below shows the daily performance spread between the two indices going all the way back to 1990. Over the last thirty years, the only two periods where we saw a frequency of these large daily dislocations was back in 2008 and the period spanning 2000 and 2001. In fact, with 17 days this year where the performance spread between the two indices was greater than two percentage points, the only other years that saw a higher frequency of large dislocations were 2000 (54) and 2001 (28). If you think the market has been indecisive this year, in 2000 we saw these types of daily dislocations an average of once per week.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/010220-Value-Growth-All-Years.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Election Anxiety Weighs on October Market Performance\n\n&gt; October often evokes fear on Wall Street as memories are stirred of crashes in 1929, 1987, the 554-point drop on October 27, 1997, back-to-back massacres in 1978 and 1979, Friday the 13th in 1989 and the 733-point drop on October 15, 2008. During the week ending October 10, 2008, Dow lost 1,874.19 points (18.2%), the worst weekly decline in our database going back to 1901, in percentage terms. March 2020 now holds the dubious honor of producing the worst, second and third worst DJIA weekly point declines. The term \u201cOctoberphobia\u201d has been used to describe the phenomenon of major market drops occurring during the month. Market calamities can become a self-fulfilling prophecy, so stay on the lookout and don\u2019t get whipsawed if it happens.\n\n&gt; But October has become a turnaround month\u2014a \u201cbear killer\u201d if you will. Twelve post-WWII bear markets have ended in October: 1946, 1957, 1960, 1962, 1966, 1974, 1987, 1990, 1998, 2001, 2002 and 2011 (S&amp;P 500 declined 19.4%). However, eight were midterm bottoms. Over the last 21 years, October\u2019s performance has been solid. Average gains over the last 21-years range from 1.3% by Russell 1000 to 2.4% by NASDAQ. Small caps have still struggled though with Russell 2000 gaining a modest 0.5%\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/aba6ebb2f208cb4b7a30b5ef83275d92/74b7a456a8bd8bcd-fc/s400x600/fb3400cc8b8054a896bd8e031be58ee2872d9e24.jpg))**\n\n&gt; Election-year Octobers rank dead last for Dow, S&amp;P 500 (since 1952), NASDAQ (since 1972), Russell 1000, and Russell 2000 (since 1980). Eliminating gruesome 2008 from the calculation provides a moderate amount of relief, as rankings climb to mid pack. Should a meaningful decline materialize in October it is likely to be an excellent buying opportunity, especially for any depressed technology and small-cap shares.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # What Have Democratic Sweeps Meant for the S&amp;P 500?\n\n&gt; Headed into the first presidential debate Tuesday night, betting markets (ElectionBettingOdds.com) placed Democratic candidate Joe Biden as the slight favorite to take the White House in November. The debate resulted in Biden gaining another 5 percentage point chance of winning the Presidency. As of this morning, Biden's odds to win are at 59.8% versus Trump's odds of 38.9%. Additionally, Democrats are slight favorites to win control of the Senate (58.4% to 41.5%) and big favorites to maintain the House (82.8% to 17.1%). Given these odds, in the chart below we show the average performance of the S&amp;P 500 from the three months before Election Day through three months after Election Day for all election years post-WWII that resulted in a sweep of the executive and legislative branch by the Democrats.\n\n&gt; As shown, on average the S&amp;P 500 has been on the decline in the weeks leading up to Election Day, though in the days just before the Election there has been a small rally that sharply reverses once the results come in. After the initial post-Election drop, the market has trended a bit higher, but by three months after the Election, it has only found itself around the same levels as Election Day; on average a 2.6% loss versus where the index stood three months prior.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/09/093020-Dem-Sweeps3.png))**\n\n&gt; The composite shown above is comprised of six different years: 1948, 1960, 1964, 1976, 1992, and 2008. While on average the S&amp;P 500 has traded lower, it is not necessarily a sure-fire thing. For example, 1948 and 2008 were the only years that saw the S&amp;P 500 trade and stay significantly lower in the wake of the election. In 1976, there was similarly a sell-off in the immediate aftermath of the election, but the index did make its way back up to the highs of that six-month time frame later on albeit no new high was put in place. Meanwhile, 1960, 1964, and 1992 all saw the S&amp;P 500 run higher after the election even despite some periods of consolidation after initial moves higher. In our B.I.G. Tips report from Tuesday, we show these same charts for all Presidential election years post WWII including a look at the average performance given every potential election outcome.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/09/093020-Dem-Sweeps.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # How Current Returns Stack Up to History\n\n&gt; Even after September's weakness, the S&amp;P 500's trailing 12-month total return stood at an impressive 14.9%. Given the events of the last 12 months, one could even say that performance is remarkable. What's even crazier is that the S&amp;P 500's performance over the last 12 months is more than three times stronger than the 12 month period before that (+4.25%). The chart below compares the S&amp;P 500's annualized total returns over the last one, two, five, ten, and twenty years and compares that performance to the historical average return of the index over those same time periods.\n\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500's historical average 12-month return is 11.7%, so the current 14.9% gain exceeds that average by more than three full percentage points. Over a two-year window, though, the S&amp;P 500's annualized return of 9.4% is more than a full percentage point below the historical average. Looking further out, the S&amp;P 500's trailing five and ten-year annualized return has been much stronger than average, which makes sense given the long bull market we were in. Over a 20 year window, though, the S&amp;P 500 is only just starting to work off some of the declines from the dot-com bust and as a result, the 6.4% annualized gain is a four and a half percentage points below the long-term average of 10.9%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/100120-Monthly-Returns.png))**\n\n&gt; Below we show how the current performance of the S&amp;P 500 in each of the time frames shown compares to all other periods on a percentile basis. The S&amp;P 500's performance over the last year, ranks just below 56th percentile of all other periods, while the two-year performance ranks just below the 42nd percentile. Even as the five and ten-year periods have seen well above average returns, they still rank in just the mid-60s on a percentile basis. The S&amp;P 500's ranking over a 20-year time period is a completely different story ranking in single-digits on a percentile basis. Even with the equity market right near record highs, the last two decades have been forgettable for US equities.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/100120-Monthly-Returns-Ranks.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Seasonals Are Back In Style Again\n\n&gt; There is no denying that market seasonality has not worked so well this year. But we have been here before and history is on our side. Over the long term, intermediate term and short term market seasonality has suffered brief periods when seasonality was overridden by more powerful forces. The COVID pandemic and economic shutdown certainly qualifies. But it is only a matter of time until repetitive human behavior patterns and people and institutions return to moving money around in the usual daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly and seasonal patterns.\n\n&gt; The return of perennial September weakness is emblematic of a return to normal market behavior and a reflection of the fact that despite the continuing concerns about surges in coronavirus cases life is beginning to return to normal. In our area, about 25-30 miles north of New York City, our kids are beginning hybrid learning, playing rugby, lacrosse and other sports (yes with some COVID protocols, but tackling and facing-off), golf outings are happening and people are going to restaurants and out and about.\n\n&gt; The chart here shows the historical One-Year Pattern of the S&amp;P 500 Since 1950 versus 2020. The black line shows the seasonal pattern since 1950. The blue represents the pattern since 1988. We use 1988 as it is the first year after the 1987 Crash when the market underwent a major systemic change with the implementation of downside protection circuit breakers and collars. It is noteworthy how the seasonal pattern persists during both the 70-year and 31-year timeframes.\n\n&gt; 2020 is plotted on the right axis due to the magnitude of the move this year. The yellow box highlights the rebirth of seasonality this September, especially during this notoriously negative Week After Triple Witching Week as detailed page 108 of the 2020 Almanac, indicated by the two black arrows\n\n&gt; Years like 1980, 1982, 2009 and 2016 with unseasonably early weakness and bear markets like 2020 returned to normal seasonal patterns in short order. And years like 1954, 1958, 1980, 1982, 1995 and 2009 that exhibited double-digit gains in the Worst Six Months still proceeded to deliver further sizable gains in the subsequent Best Six Months (page 52, STA 2020). We believe the return of market seasonality is upon us. So remain cautious through the end of September and be alert to Octoberophobia, but remain ready to pounce on our Best Months Seasonal MACD Buy Signal, when it triggers.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/0a4a6ba18e7d903b198c8fa7d6cf8bc4/9c2d30c4da9ff340-d7/s500x750/eb0c36b5ff7eec394f463ca8420054c22a88010f.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending October 2nd, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiTS26b5YO8))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 10.4.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED.)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$DPZ** \n&gt; * **$PAYX** \n&gt; * **$RPM** \n&gt; * **$HELE** \n&gt; * **$AYI** \n&gt; * **$LEVI** \n&gt; * **$LW** \n&gt; * **$LNDC** \n&gt; * **$SAR** \n&gt; * **$EXFO** \n&gt; * **$RGP**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/UBfJMYm.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/E7qqUjk.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 10.5.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 10.5.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday  10.6.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/zy3ktow.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 10.6.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/pt0NiLh.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 10.7.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/yaviiRp.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 10.7.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Vdaqsaj.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 10.8.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ipdesH4.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 10.8.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 10.9.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 10.9.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Domino's Pizza, Inc. $433.78\n**Domino's Pizza, Inc.

        "selftext": "Good Friday evening to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning October 5th, 2020.\n\n# **Trump\u2019s health and fiscal stimulus fight will steer the markets in the week ahead  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/02/trumps-health-and-the-fiscal-s.html)**\n*****\n&gt; President Donald Trump\u2019s health and the state of a fiscal stimulus package will be the main focus for markets in the coming week.\n*****\n&gt; In the early morning hours Friday, President Donald Trump tweeted that he and the first lady tested positive for Covid. Stocks sold off hard, but the S&amp;P 500 came off its lows in Friday trading and closed down just under 1%. It was up 1.5% for the week.\n*****\n&gt; The market was helped by signs that a stimulus package is still a possibility, after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi asked airlines not to furlough workers. She promised either a stand alone aid bill, or a bigger negotiated relief legislation that would help the industry.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe market is going to watch health updates from the White House medical staff, and it\u2019s going to watch how the president communicates with the public,\u201d said Julian Emanuel, head of equities and derivatives at BTIG. \u201cWill we see him in person in the next week in any form? What\u2019s his volume of tweets? All as a way to first gauge the severity of the case.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Trump and Melania Trump are reported to have mild cases, but as time goes on the market will turn to how the illness could impact the presidential election.\n*****\n&gt; Former Vice President Joe Biden gained slightly in the polls after the first debate Tuesday night, and now the calendar for further debates is in question. The market has seemingly warmed to Biden, and even though he would raise taxes, it is assumed Democrats would quickly pass a major infrastructure package if there is a Democratic sweep of Congress.\n*****\n&gt; Trump, however, is widely seen on Wall Street as stronger on the economy and better for markets.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWhat you\u2019ve done from a campaign perspective, is you\u2019ve taken away the thing that gives him the most energy - his ability to interact with crowds,\u201d said Emanuel. \u201cThe president had wanted to paint the economic recovery of the last three or four months as the cornerstone, and this basically puts the virus back as topic number 1, number 2 and number 3. And it\u2019s all the more so because the data is coming in weaker than expected.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; The market is fixated on the prospect of stimulus to help business, the unemployed and state and local governments. The House passed a $2.2 trillion package this week, but there is still no agreement with Republicans. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has pushed for a $1.6 trillion package.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think there\u2019s an underlying bid under the market because nobody wants to be super short if we get a stimulus approved, but you can\u2019t be too long in case his mild symptoms turn into severe symptoms,\u201d said Scott Redler, partner with T3live.com. \u201cWe\u2019re in a tough spot but overall we\u2019re still pretty constructive.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Emanuel said the fact the president is now ill could hurt confidence and slow down some of the improvement in the economy.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe underlying tone is, again, whether its directly or later, there\u2019s going to be stimulus,\u201d Emanuel said. \u201d\u2019Whether it\u2019s this month or November, this reinforces the need for stimulus because the president falling ill signals to, at the margin, the person whose thinking about going out to dinner to think again. It\u2019s a significant economic and psychological hindrance.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Also coming up in the week ahead is a speech Tuesday by Fed Chairman Jerome Powell to the National Association of Business Economists.\n*****\n&gt; Powell is also expected to push for the stimulus package to boost the economy so the recovery does not stall.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think his whole objective is to try to get Congress and the Administration to sign onto a fiscal rescue package,\u201d said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics. \u201cHe\u2019ll all but come out and say [the recovery] is not a \u2018V.\u2019 Without additional support from lawmakers, risks are pretty high that we backtrack. I think that\u2019s the kind of outlook he\u2019s going to give. It\u2019s going to be full-throated.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; September\u2019s employment report, released Friday, was seen by some as a warning that the economy is not rebounding as expected. There were 661,000 jobs added in September, well below the 800,000 expected.\n*****\n&gt; Besides Powell, there are a half dozen other Fed speakers. There are also minutes from the Fed\u2019s last minute released Wednesday afternoon.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/3J0V6o1.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/TI8ImmZ.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/90v084y.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/Ne7m07y.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/0UZt0DJ.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/HA7KsPc.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/NzmRLPp.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/eqS3Lk4.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/UBfJMYm.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/k9v1hZX.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/UtkozzH.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/KNI9qkQ.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/OM44UFj.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Make Up Your !@#$%^&amp;* Mind!\n\n&gt; We've all had versions of this conversation where you or the person you were talking to just couldn't make up their mind. At the end of the day, it only causes trouble and plans are ruined.\n\n&gt; The market is having its own back and forth this year trying to decide between growth and value. Just today, growth stocks are getting slaughtered while value stocks are up marginally. As an example, the Russell 1000 Growth index is down 1.8% on the day while the Russell 1000 Value index has managed to rally 0.25%. The chart below shows the daily performance spread between the Russell 1000 Growth index and the Russell 1000 Value index for each day in 2020. Today's performance spread between the two indices marks the ninth time this year that value has outperformed growth by more than two percentage points. At the other extreme, there have also been eight trading days where growth outperformed value by more than two percentage points.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/010220-Value-Growth-2020.png))**\n\n&gt; So how does this year's frequency of days where the performance spread between the two indices was more than two percentage points stack up to other years? The chart below shows the daily performance spread between the two indices going all the way back to 1990. Over the last thirty years, the only two periods where we saw a frequency of these large daily dislocations was back in 2008 and the period spanning 2000 and 2001. In fact, with 17 days this year where the performance spread between the two indices was greater than two percentage points, the only other years that saw a higher frequency of large dislocations were 2000 (54) and 2001 (28). If you think the market has been indecisive this year, in 2000 we saw these types of daily dislocations an average of once per week.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/010220-Value-Growth-All-Years.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Election Anxiety Weighs on October Market Performance\n\n&gt; October often evokes fear on Wall Street as memories are stirred of crashes in 1929, 1987, the 554-point drop on October 27, 1997, back-to-back massacres in 1978 and 1979, Friday the 13th in 1989 and the 733-point drop on October 15, 2008. During the week ending October 10, 2008, Dow lost 1,874.19 points (18.2%), the worst weekly decline in our database going back to 1901, in percentage terms. March 2020 now holds the dubious honor of producing the worst, second and third worst DJIA weekly point declines. The term \u201cOctoberphobia\u201d has been used to describe the phenomenon of major market drops occurring during the month. Market calamities can become a self-fulfilling prophecy, so stay on the lookout and don\u2019t get whipsawed if it happens.\n\n&gt; But October has become a turnaround month\u2014a \u201cbear killer\u201d if you will. Twelve post-WWII bear markets have ended in October: 1946, 1957, 1960, 1962, 1966, 1974, 1987, 1990, 1998, 2001, 2002 and 2011 (S&amp;P 500 declined 19.4%). However, eight were midterm bottoms. Over the last 21 years, October\u2019s performance has been solid. Average gains over the last 21-years range from 1.3% by Russell 1000 to 2.4% by NASDAQ. Small caps have still struggled though with Russell 2000 gaining a modest 0.5%\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/aba6ebb2f208cb4b7a30b5ef83275d92/74b7a456a8bd8bcd-fc/s400x600/fb3400cc8b8054a896bd8e031be58ee2872d9e24.jpg))**\n\n&gt; Election-year Octobers rank dead last for Dow, S&amp;P 500 (since 1952), NASDAQ (since 1972), Russell 1000, and Russell 2000 (since 1980). Eliminating gruesome 2008 from the calculation provides a moderate amount of relief, as rankings climb to mid pack. Should a meaningful decline materialize in October it is likely to be an excellent buying opportunity, especially for any depressed technology and small-cap shares.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # What Have Democratic Sweeps Meant for the S&amp;P 500?\n\n&gt; Headed into the first presidential debate Tuesday night, betting markets (ElectionBettingOdds.com) placed Democratic candidate Joe Biden as the slight favorite to take the White House in November. The debate resulted in Biden gaining another 5 percentage point chance of winning the Presidency. As of this morning, Biden's odds to win are at 59.8% versus Trump's odds of 38.9%. Additionally, Democrats are slight favorites to win control of the Senate (58.4% to 41.5%) and big favorites to maintain the House (82.8% to 17.1%). Given these odds, in the chart below we show the average performance of the S&amp;P 500 from the three months before Election Day through three months after Election Day for all election years post-WWII that resulted in a sweep of the executive and legislative branch by the Democrats.\n\n&gt; As shown, on average the S&amp;P 500 has been on the decline in the weeks leading up to Election Day, though in the days just before the Election there has been a small rally that sharply reverses once the results come in. After the initial post-Election drop, the market has trended a bit higher, but by three months after the Election, it has only found itself around the same levels as Election Day; on average a 2.6% loss versus where the index stood three months prior.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/09/093020-Dem-Sweeps3.png))**\n\n&gt; The composite shown above is comprised of six different years: 1948, 1960, 1964, 1976, 1992, and 2008. While on average the S&amp;P 500 has traded lower, it is not necessarily a sure-fire thing. For example, 1948 and 2008 were the only years that saw the S&amp;P 500 trade and stay significantly lower in the wake of the election. In 1976, there was similarly a sell-off in the immediate aftermath of the election, but the index did make its way back up to the highs of that six-month time frame later on albeit no new high was put in place. Meanwhile, 1960, 1964, and 1992 all saw the S&amp;P 500 run higher after the election even despite some periods of consolidation after initial moves higher. In our B.I.G. Tips report from Tuesday, we show these same charts for all Presidential election years post WWII including a look at the average performance given every potential election outcome.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/09/093020-Dem-Sweeps.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # How Current Returns Stack Up to History\n\n&gt; Even after September's weakness, the S&amp;P 500's trailing 12-month total return stood at an impressive 14.9%. Given the events of the last 12 months, one could even say that performance is remarkable. What's even crazier is that the S&amp;P 500's performance over the last 12 months is more than three times stronger than the 12 month period before that (+4.25%). The chart below compares the S&amp;P 500's annualized total returns over the last one, two, five, ten, and twenty years and compares that performance to the historical average return of the index over those same time periods.\n\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500's historical average 12-month return is 11.7%, so the current 14.9% gain exceeds that average by more than three full percentage points. Over a two-year window, though, the S&amp;P 500's annualized return of 9.4% is more than a full percentage point below the historical average. Looking further out, the S&amp;P 500's trailing five and ten-year annualized return has been much stronger than average, which makes sense given the long bull market we were in. Over a 20 year window, though, the S&amp;P 500 is only just starting to work off some of the declines from the dot-com bust and as a result, the 6.4% annualized gain is a four and a half percentage points below the long-term average of 10.9%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/100120-Monthly-Returns.png))**\n\n&gt; Below we show how the current performance of the S&amp;P 500 in each of the time frames shown compares to all other periods on a percentile basis. The S&amp;P 500's performance over the last year, ranks just below 56th percentile of all other periods, while the two-year performance ranks just below the 42nd percentile. Even as the five and ten-year periods have seen well above average returns, they still rank in just the mid-60s on a percentile basis. The S&amp;P 500's ranking over a 20-year time period is a completely different story ranking in single-digits on a percentile basis. Even with the equity market right near record highs, the last two decades have been forgettable for US equities.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/100120-Monthly-Returns-Ranks.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Seasonals Are Back In Style Again\n\n&gt; There is no denying that market seasonality has not worked so well this year. But we have been here before and history is on our side. Over the long term, intermediate term and short term market seasonality has suffered brief periods when seasonality was overridden by more powerful forces. The COVID pandemic and economic shutdown certainly qualifies. But it is only a matter of time until repetitive human behavior patterns and people and institutions return to moving money around in the usual daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly and seasonal patterns.\n\n&gt; The return of perennial September weakness is emblematic of a return to normal market behavior and a reflection of the fact that despite the continuing concerns about surges in coronavirus cases life is beginning to return to normal. In our area, about 25-30 miles north of New York City, our kids are beginning hybrid learning, playing rugby, lacrosse and other sports (yes with some COVID protocols, but tackling and facing-off), golf outings are happening and people are going to restaurants and out and about.\n\n&gt; The chart here shows the historical One-Year Pattern of the S&amp;P 500 Since 1950 versus 2020. The black line shows the seasonal pattern since 1950. The blue represents the pattern since 1988. We use 1988 as it is the first year after the 1987 Crash when the market underwent a major systemic change with the implementation of downside protection circuit breakers and collars. It is noteworthy how the seasonal pattern persists during both the 70-year and 31-year timeframes.\n\n&gt; 2020 is plotted on the right axis due to the magnitude of the move this year. The yellow box highlights the rebirth of seasonality this September, especially during this notoriously negative Week After Triple Witching Week as detailed page 108 of the 2020 Almanac, indicated by the two black arrows\n\n&gt; Years like 1980, 1982, 2009 and 2016 with unseasonably early weakness and bear markets like 2020 returned to normal seasonal patterns in short order. And years like 1954, 1958, 1980, 1982, 1995 and 2009 that exhibited double-digit gains in the Worst Six Months still proceeded to deliver further sizable gains in the subsequent Best Six Months (page 52, STA 2020). We believe the return of market seasonality is upon us. So remain cautious through the end of September and be alert to Octoberophobia, but remain ready to pounce on our Best Months Seasonal MACD Buy Signal, when it triggers.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/0a4a6ba18e7d903b198c8fa7d6cf8bc4/9c2d30c4da9ff340-d7/s500x750/eb0c36b5ff7eec394f463ca8420054c22a88010f.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending October 2nd, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED.)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 10.4.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED.)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$DPZ** \n&gt; * **$PAYX** \n&gt; * **$RPM** \n&gt; * **$HELE** \n&gt; * **$AYI** \n&gt; * **$LEVI** \n&gt; * **$LW** \n&gt; * **$LNDC** \n&gt; * **$SAR** \n&gt; * **$EXFO** \n&gt; * **$RGP**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/UBfJMYm.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/E7qqUjk.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 10.5.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 10.5.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday  10.6.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/zy3ktow.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 10.6.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/pt0NiLh.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 10.7.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/yaviiRp.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 10.7.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Vdaqsaj.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 10.8.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ipdesH4.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 10.8.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 10.9.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 10.9.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Domino's Pizza, Inc. $433.78\n**Domino's Pizza, Inc.

        "selftext": "**PART 1/4 - FREE MARKET?**\n\nFirst off, let's set the scene.\n\nThe stock market is telling you nothing about the real economy anymore.\n\nEconomic fundamentals have never mattered as little for the stock market as has been the case during this 11-year bull market.\n\nThe correlation between gross-domestic-product growth and the direction of the S&amp;P 500 Index has only been 7% in this cycle - historically it has been 30% to 70%.\n\nWhy?\n\nWell, it is the Central\u00a0Banks, led by the Fed, who printed their way out of the Recession in '08.\n\nIn doing so, they have papered over the cracks, and we have seen the longest economic expansion in US history.\n\nHowever, this is not a particularly\u00a0meritocratic process: money creation itself increases inequality via the [Cantillon Effect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv5xl1AEeQs), as money printing leads to asset price inflation, which disproportionately benefits the rich and hurts the poor.\n\nFormer Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker told the New York Times in 2018:\n\n*\u201cThe central issue is we\u2019re developing into a plutocracy. We\u2019ve got an enormous number of enormously rich people that have convinced themselves that they\u2019re rich because they\u2019re smart and constructive.\"*\n\nThe reality of course is that this is largely not the case - it is because the game is rigged in their favour.\n\nNow, it is important to emphasise the fact that the path we have taken has resulted in the highest living standards we have seen in human history.\n\n*However*, the issue, particularly since the US completely abandoned the gold standard in 1971, is that debt has exploded to obscene levels.\n\nWe are not operating in a free market if it takes $185 trillion of debt over the last 20 years to create 'growth'.\n\nIn fact, the global debt to GDP ratio hit an all-time high of 322% in the third quarter of 2019.\n\nInflation means that your dollar loses value and thus your purchasing power goes down.\n\nDeflation means that the value of your dollar goes up and your purchasing power goes up.\n\nThat's a good thing right? You get more goods and services for less.\n\nWell, no.\n\nIf you have deflation, debt explodes in real terms and you can never pay it back.\n\nAs the economy is based on debt, if you allow deflation, then you have to reset the debt.\u00a0\n\nThis is why central banks fear deflation so much.\n\nHowever, the major force driving the human race is technological progress - and this stops for no mortal...\n\n**PART 2/4 - TECHNOLOGICAL DEFLATION:**\n\nThe increased abundance created by technology will result in massive job losses.\n\n[Throughout history](https://timeline.com/robots-have-been-about-to-take-all-the-jobs-for-more-than-200-years-5c9c08a2f41d), doom porn enthusiasts have screamed that the machines are coming for jobs. This is *not* a new phenomenon.\n\nAll technological revolutions are deflationary - since they create \"supply side shocks\", meaning that they allow for more intensive\u00a0use of resources\u00a0and thus higher production. With more goods being produced, all other things being equal, the price of those goods will fall.\u00a0\n\nIn the last 20 years or so, software has disrupted and replaced many established goods and services.\n\nIt is in the *next 20 years* that another disruptive technology is set to take the stage: AI\n\nAccording to Steve Schwarzman, the co-founder and CEO of The Blackstone Group who has a net worth of $17.6BN:\n\n*\"This is going to touch everyone's life....you're not going to be able to get away from this technology\"*\n\nMoreover, this virus will only accelerate this trend towards tech. [Zoom is a fantastic example](https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-zoom/zoom-pulls-in-more-than-200-million-daily-video-users-during-worldwide-lockdowns-idUKKBN21K1C7) of exactly this.\n\nOld legacy economic systems were not built for this tech deflation, and the thing about exponential growth is that we humans do not intuitively understand it.\u00a0\n\nAs an example, if you folded a piece of paper 51 times, of course you can only fold it seven times, but if you could fold it 51 times, it would reach the Sun!\n\n**PART 3/4 - IMPLICATIONS FOR SOCIETY:**\n\nThe question is: how does this play out?\n\nIn the long term, it is the fundamental structure of the economic system that has a significant impact on people's lives, not\u00a0who is President for 4 to 8 years.\n\nIn reality, politicians have limited power and are effectively all puppets. We have seen [what happens when a President doesn't stay in their lane](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q91RZko5Gw)...\n\nOne could argue that the two main mechanisms of control are:\n\n1. Divide and Conquer and\n2. [Order from Chaos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfx7PnMtCeY)\n\nAs we have seen many times in the past, herd psychology is [worryingly easy to manipulate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M26-B44qQIs)...\n\nSpeaking of the censorship, in his book Antifragile, Nassim Taleb discusses the anti fragility of information.\u00a0\n\nInformation feeds more on attempts to harm it than it does on efforts to promote it.\n\nA fantastic example of this process is what has happened with London Real: they were banned on LinkedIn and David Icke's interview was censored. Now, regardless of what you think of this particular channel or your thoughts on David Icke and the theories provided, censoring information in this way *actually spreads it more virally*.\n\nIt's fascinating to observe how many views the videos regarding the bans and censorship have relative to the others. And the [impact this has had on subscribers](https://socialblade.com/youtube/user/londonrealtv).\n\nIt is always easier to blame a bigger enemy (or create a new one) rather than to admit it's a structural problem.\n\nTherefore, you avoid short term pain...whatever the cost.\n\nThe real question is [if and when this situation will lead to social unrest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4GMUamUjT8)...\n\n**PART 4/4 - INTELLECTUAL CAPITALISM:**\n\nThe depth and width of jobs impacted by AI will continue to increase in the future.\n\nNow this will not necessarily happen straight away.\n\nHowever, our transition from commodity capitalism to intellectual capitalism is inevitable and the people and nations who fight against this trend will be on the wrong side of history.\n\nFrom a practical investment perspective, and disclaimer this is not investment advice, network effects are a crucial aspect to consider moving forwards.\n\nEssentially, this means that the value of the network\u00a0increases with each additional user - all of the tech monopolies have exhibited this property.\n\nAn asset which could in time demonstrate very strong network effects is Bitcoin.\n\n[Looking at the market cap relative to other asset classes](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/worlds-money-markets-one-visualization-2017/), Bitcoin provides an asymmetric investment opportunity.\n\nOnly time will tell...\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nFbKzt-uwE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nFbKzt-uwE)",

        "selftext": "Lou Pai was a recluse.\n\nExtremely introverted.\n\nVery reserved.\n\nThat is...inside the office.\n\nOutside the office...\n\nPai symbolised the legendary lavishness and excesses of Enron's corporate culture.\n\nEven though he was married, he would spend inordinate amounts of time during and after working hours at the strip club.\n\nHe would use the Enron corporate jet for personal commuting.\n\nAnd he would charge several hundred dollars worth of lunches for himself and friends to the corporate expense account (i.e. he was living the so called American Dream).\n\nThe Enron Scandal surfaced in October 2001 when it was revealed that America's seventh largest company was involved in corporate corruption and accounting fraud. \n\nThe scandal surrounding the Enron energy company had political implications due to Enron's close links with the White House. The Deregulation of Enron allowed the corporation to operate largely free from US government scrutiny. There was also misrepresentation in earnings reports, a fraudulent 'energy crisis' and embezzlement by Enron Executives. \n\n***The Enron scandal eventually led to the bankruptcy of the company, and Enron shareholders lost $74 billion leading up to its bankruptcy, and Enron's employees lost their jobs and billions of dollars in pension benefits.*** \n\n***Enron CEO Jeff Skilling was sentenced to 24 years in prison, former CEO Kenneth Lay died from a massive heart attack before serving time. Another Enron executive, Clifford Baxter, committed suicide in 2002 shortly before he was due to testify before Congress.***\n\n***But what about Lou Pai?***\n\nPai joined Enron in 1987, when it was just a regional energy supplier.\n\nHe became one of future CEO Jeff Skilling's top lieutenants, primarily tasked with detailing and implementing Skilling's vision of transforming Enron into a de facto energy commodities-trading firm.\n\nDuring his Enron career, Skilling put Pai in charge of multiple Enron subsidiaries.\n\nPai was CEO of the EES (Enron Energy Services) subsidiary from March 1997 until May 2001.\n\n***Pai's frequent strip club visits during his time at Enron proved to be a blessing in disguise.***\n\nIt led to an affair with stripper Melanie Fewell (who was also married) and resulted in a pregnancy.\n\nUpon learning of the affair, Pai's then-wife of over 20 years Lanna, with whom he has two children, filed for divorce.\n\nThis is the crazy part:\n\n***To satisfy the financial terms of his divorce settlement, Pai cashed out $250 million of his Enron stock, just months before the company's stock price collapsed.***\n\nPai's early sell-off shielded him from the insider trading charges levelled against other Enron executives who had also secretly sold-off large amounts of stock before the company's financial situation was publicly known.\n\nSomehow, through sheer luck (or was it!), Pai had managed to secure a win for himself, his ex-wife and his new wife, Melanie Pai.\n\n***While his colleagues were in jail or dead, Pai was using his new found wealth to become the second-largest land owner in Colorado after he purchased the 77500-acre Taylor Ranch for $23 million in 1999. He sold the property in June 2004 for $60 million.***\n\nPai did have to cough up some cash though:\n\nIn 2008, he agreed to resolve civil insider trading charges against him with an out-of-court settlement of $31.5 million.\n\nPai was not charged with any *criminal* wrongdoing in the Enron scandal and exercised his 5th Amendment rights in the subsequent Enron class action lawsuits.\n\n***But still, it's fair to say that the tale of Lou Pai offers a lesson for corporate executives looking to use divorce as a hustle to liquidate their stock holdings without upsetting regulators or shareholders.***\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3UOuhRXys8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3UOuhRXys8)",
