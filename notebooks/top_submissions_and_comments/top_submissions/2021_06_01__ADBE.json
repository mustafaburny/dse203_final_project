My perpetual growth rate of 2.5% is close to the economy as a whole. \n\nI found terminal value using  $13,568,000(1+0.025) / 0.0754-0.025 to get  $275,936,507. \n\nMy discount factor was (1+0.0754)\\^t, where t = 1,2,3 depending on if it's for 2021, 2022, or the terminal value respectively. I divided FCF estimates by the discount factors to get PV of future FCF values, which I then added up and divided by the 435,000 (in thousands) shares outstanding to get a fair value of $435 a share. \n\nAdobe is currently trading at $504 a share, so it seems to be modestly overvalued.

        "selftext": "While bulls continue to lead the markets forward, investor focus will likely shift to macro indicators, such as interest rates and inflation, as the Federal Reserve begins its two-day meeting this week.\n\nAlthough the central bank is unlikely to make any moves on rates, it could provide some insights into how it sees the economic rebound progressing and whether the need to remove some monetary stimulus has indeed arrived.  \n\nSo far, stocks investors don\u2019t see any danger to their favorable views on the market. The S&amp;P 500 finished on Friday at a new high, posting a 0.4% gain for the week. Keeping this macro picture in mind, following are three stocks we'll be monitoring in the coming week.\n\n1. Oracle\nOracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) will release its fiscal 2021, fourth-quarter earnings report on Tuesday, June 15, after the market close. Analysts are projecting $1.31 a share profit on sales of $11.02 billion.\n\nThe shares of the software company are surging this year on improving demand for the tech giant\u2019s cloud computing services after years of stagnant sales. Its stock closed on Friday at $82.90 after climbing 28% this year, more than three times the return produced by the benchmark NASDAQ 100 Index.\n\n\nGrowth prospects are improving as the company focuses on cloud computing services in an effort to accelerate revenue growth at the world\u2019s second-largest software maker. Customer interest in the firm\u2019s internet-based applications has finally offset declining demand for its legacy tools.\n\n\n2. Adobe Systems\nAnother stock that will come under investor scrutiny this coming week is Adobe Systems (NASDAQ:ADBE). The software manufacturer, whose product lineup includes Photoshop, will release its fiscal 2021, second quarter earnings on Thursday, June 17 after the close. Wall Street expects $2.81 EPS and $3.73 billion of revenue.\n\n\nAdobe\u2019s earnings during the pandemic showed that the software maker\u2019s cloud-based creative tools are in great demand. Chief Executive Officer Shantanu Narayen has offered new creative software tools to clients to accelerate Adobe\u2019s revenue growth. \n\nIn March, the company raised its 2021 fiscal year revenue forecast to $15.45 billion from $15.15 billion and said sales in its main digital media segment would increase 22% after earlier projecting 19% growth. Adjusted earnings will be about $11.85 a share, an increase from $11.20 previously forecast.\n\nThe company introduced a version of its popular app\u2014Illustrator\u2014for Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPad, back in October, as part of an effort to expand its products' footprint to include more devices used by professionals and hobbyists.\n\nConsumers of Document Cloud products\u2014including Adobe Acrobat PDF and electronic signature software\u2014have surged with millions working from home.  Adobe shares closed on Friday at $541.26 after rising 8% this year.\n\n3. Kroger\nSupermarket behemoth, Kroger Company (NYSE:KR) will report its Q1, 2021 earnings on Thursday before the market opens. Analysts are expecting $0.98 a share profit on sales of $39.56 billion.\n\nKroger's stock has gained 22% this year on the grocer\u2019s surging sales and its participation in the U.S. vaccination campaign against COVID-19. The company is delivering millions of vaccinations to people nationwide, creating more repeat customers for its pharmacies and supermarket offerings. Kroger generated record sales of $132.5 billion in the year ended Jan. 30.\n\nKroger is betting that its in-store pharmacies and clinics can keep its supermarkets central to consumers\u2019 lives even as the coronavirus recedes. Next week\u2019s earnings could provide some insight to investors regarding the path it intends to take once the pandemic is contained.\n\n\u201cCOVID has taught us that pharmacy is always really important and will be important as we go forward,\u201d Rodney McMullen, Kroger\u2019s chief executive, told WSJ.com in March.",

Options premium tends to spike when the stocks are squeezing higher and compress when the stocks have down days, or begin to go in either direction day to day. This is a dynamic traders should be watchful of when positioning directionally. It is not uncommon for out fo the money puts to lose money on down days in the stock, if vol is compressing.

        "selftext": "Hello Everybody! \\[Echo- Hello Doctor Nick!\\]\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt\u2019s me, HewhoSleepsNot, here with another fantastic product for you and I have a question for you all at the end of the post from The infamous TeB!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, disclaimer, this is not financial advice, we are not financial advisors, and we are certainly not YOUR financial advisors. This is a labor of love and a thought experiment. I am hoping that you all will push me further in my analysis so that I become better over time!  These are just our personal thoughts and views based upon news shared out in the world. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis information is not groundbreaking but more us gathering from various sources some interesting stories, news, and tickers to share with the community! I will note where I found the material from when I can remember or when my notes include it but some are just from memory and came from places like Twitter, emails, reddit, etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow lets get into it, shall we?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSome upcoming events this week to keep an eye on: Earnings from **COUP, MRVL, MTN** on Monday, followed by **CPB, GME, RH** Wednesday, and **ADBE, CHWY, PLUG**, on Thursday.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso happening are key reports on core inflation, consumer sentiment/expectations, job turnover rate, and G7! Will proposals to tax multinational persons/corporations make any big changes in the market? Long term- I do not believe it will have any significant effect on valuations of these companies.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPlayer 3,297 has entered the EV game.  **Rivian** is working with advisors to set up their IPO and have reportedly selected their underwriters.  This will be very interesting to me. I have a close friend who is working for them and they have been giving him great opportunities which gives me a lot of optimism because he is 1 of 2 people I have met over the last 3 decades that I would trust to work for me, regardless of the industry, just because of what a solid and smart person he is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nConservative Investing News, who I have spamming me constantly, is shilling Kraft Heinz **KHC** as the number 1 income stock of 2021. They cite the dividend of 5% at current valuations and the stock decline of 50% since 2017. I\u2019ve been holding **KHC** since pre-merger so I have seen this decline and not sure I agree with them that this stock is ready for a major comeback. May be a decent dividend play but then again so is **AT&amp;T**.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo it\u2019s been a wild week of meme stock pops and dips.  I will admit I am still holding some **GME** but prematurely sold my **AMC**. Thought double was good enough but this week proved me wrong considering could have done 7x. Oh well, if you look at my massive loss from last year I have learned to make my peace with taking profits, even if they aren\u2019t as maximized as they could be.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI just wasn\u2019t as convinced for the **AMC** thesis as I am for the **GME**. I like to look at them both and think about them as if there is no MOASS in the wings and when I look at them like that **GME** is a good value buy for me even at the current market cap.  It\u2019s got a great digital transition team lead by RC and others that are the top of their game.  The amount of publicity they have received is also beyond what anyone could have paid for and they have capitalized on it wonderfully.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did enjoy **AMC** CEO showing us his naked shorts, and have been selling cash covered puts on **AMC** in the 15-20 strike range earning 30-60+% APY when projected out for a year.  He is doing a great job of harnessing the movement and keeping shareholders interested and engaged.  Will see if he continues to roll out things like the AMC Investor Connect, but if he does I think the shareholders will reward him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy cash covered puts and stock secured calls I have been doing for about two months have been doing well.  I stick with what I know and only sell puts on stocks at prices I wouldn\u2019t mind being long in, and then I sell calls to continue generating current income on the blocks.  Averaging about 30% interest last I checked a few weeks ago.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TSLA** jumped 4.6% on news that it was looking to expand to India. Don\u2019t know if that alone is good enough news to justify a pop like this alone, especially with rivals coming from every direction.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**American Airlines** dropped 2.4% when it released a lack luster 2Q revenue forecast this week.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TGT** continues to attract attention of hedge funds and investors with an impressive target of 211$ from Credit Suisse and a total of 78 hedge funds holding.  It has a 1.23% dividend as well so huzzah.  Wish I had held more of the shares I bought in the mid to high 60s a few years back! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**OPEN** and **SPNV** \\[taking **Offerpad** public via SPAC\\] both came on my radar and bought \\~200$ of each.  Found them in a stock gum shoe article deducing them as the likely two teased stocks from MF\u2019s new real estate trailblazer big bucks subscription. Both seem like very interesting real estate disrupters. The market is ripe for disruption as buying/selling a house is far too cumbersome given all the technical tools at humanities fingertips.  Both of these companies make cash offers on houses, do necessary renovations, and resell them. Instant gratification is the Achilles heel of modern Americans so this type of business that scratches that itch I think will go far. Just a matter of what companies take the space first and service the customer the best.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLong **Disney** until the IP laws change in this country. The amount of IP they own, from Marvel to Star Wars is just insane.  And they are continuing to churn new content in these hot spaces.  The Star Wars Disney+ offerings have proved popular, and Loki is right around the corner!  Consensus 1 yr target avg from Yahoo Finance is $207 which presents decent upside from current levels.  Wish they would bring the dividend back but they are sufficiently pushing growth initiatives that I won\u2019t complain too much at this time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLet\u2019s end with the question, what do you guys think of **Upstart**, a fin tech company? Are they sufficiently unique to distinguish themselves in the crowded market and get ahead of the primary players? Seems like loans are ripe for disruption given the archaic roots of the industry players, but will **Upstart** be a lead disruptor, or will it fall behind?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks for reading.",

        "selftext": "I created a brokerage account last year around the time of the market crash and snagged up quite a few stocks for (what I think is) a bargain price: F @ 5, XOM @ 38, CVX @ 67, AMZN @ 1800, MRNA @ 55 and a few others\n\nMy portfolio, right now, looks like this: 4 shares REGN @ 450, 30 shares NVDA @ 475, 30 shares ABBV @ 90, 10 shares GOOG @ 1800, 10 shares XLK @ 123, 100 shares XLF @ 30, 10 shares LULU @ 285, 5 shares GS @ 300, 100 shares CELH @ 45, 100 shares NUE @ 53, 3 shares ADBE @ 460, 50 shares DOCU @ 200, and 50 shares U @ 83. I also have some other ETFs including the QQQ, VTI, and SPY.\n\nTo me, my portfolio seems very tech/bio heavy - NVDA, GOOG, ADBE, U, XLK, ABBV, REGN. I also held short positions on QS and AI and recently bought to cover. I also held AMZN, SNOW, SQ, MU, CHWY, CVX, XOM, MRNA, TWLO, VUZI, and MKC, which I sold for a nice profit. I did buy 1000 shares of AMC at 10 and sold at 70, 1000 shares of CLOV at 13 and sold at 23, and GME at 50 and sold at 330 - possibly a bit unwise of me. I just sold my F at $16.\n\nI don't know whether I should get back into some of my previous holdings or buy some more of my current holdings? Also, what are the best ways to find good stocks? Are there any that should be on my radar? What stocks perform well and are pretty good buys? I am looking to diversify my portfolio a bit, it seems to tech heavy.\n\nThank you in advance!",

        "selftext": "Hello Everybody! \\[Echo- Hello Doctor Nick!\\]\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt\u2019s me, HewhoSleepsNot, here with another fantastic product for you and I have a question for you all at the end of the post from The infamous TeB!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, disclaimer, this is not financial advice, we are not financial advisors, and we are certainly not YOUR financial advisors. This is a labor of love and a thought experiment. I am hoping that you all will push me further in my analysis so that I become better over time!  These are just our personal thoughts and views based upon news shared out in the world. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis information is not groundbreaking but more us gathering from various sources some interesting stories, news, and tickers to share with the community! I will note where I found the material from when I can remember or when my notes include it but some are just from memory and came from places like Twitter, emails, reddit, etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow lets get into it, shall we?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSome upcoming events this week to keep an eye on: Earnings from **COUP, MRVL, MTN** on Monday, followed by **CPB, GME, RH** Wednesday, and **ADBE, CHWY, PLUG**, on Thursday.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso happening are key reports on core inflation, consumer sentiment/expectations, job turnover rate, and G7! Will proposals to tax multinational persons/corporations make any big changes in the market? Long term- I do not believe it will have any significant effect on valuations of these companies.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPlayer 3,297 has entered the EV game.  **Rivian** is working with advisors to set up their IPO and have reportedly selected their underwriters.  This will be very interesting to me. I have a close friend who is working for them and they have been giving him great opportunities which gives me a lot of optimism because he is 1 of 2 people I have met over the last 3 decades that I would trust to work for me, regardless of the industry, just because of what a solid and smart person he is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nConservative Investing News, who I have spamming me constantly, is shilling Kraft Heinz **KHC** as the number 1 income stock of 2021. They cite the dividend of 5% at current valuations and the stock decline of 50% since 2017. I\u2019ve been holding **KHC** since pre-merger so I have seen this decline and not sure I agree with them that this stock is ready for a major comeback. May be a decent dividend play but then again so is **AT&amp;T**.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo it\u2019s been a wild week of meme stock pops and dips.  I will admit I am still holding some **GME** but prematurely sold my **AMC**. Thought double was good enough but this week proved me wrong considering could have done 7x. Oh well, if you look at my massive loss from last year I have learned to make my peace with taking profits, even if they aren\u2019t as maximized as they could be.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI just wasn\u2019t as convinced for the **AMC** thesis as I am for the **GME**. I like to look at them both and think about them as if there is no MOASS in the wings and when I look at them like that **GME** is a good value buy for me even at the current market cap.  It\u2019s got a great digital transition team lead by RC and others that are the top of their game.  The amount of publicity they have received is also beyond what anyone could have paid for and they have capitalized on it wonderfully.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did enjoy **AMC** CEO showing us his naked shorts, and have been selling cash covered puts on **AMC** in the 15-20 strike range earning 30-60+% APY when projected out for a year.  He is doing a great job of harnessing the movement and keeping shareholders interested and engaged.  Will see if he continues to roll out things like the AMC Investor Connect, but if he does I think the shareholders will reward him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy cash covered puts and stock secured calls I have been doing for about two months have been doing well.  I stick with what I know and only sell puts on stocks at prices I wouldn\u2019t mind being long in, and then I sell calls to continue generating current income on the blocks.  Averaging about 30% interest last I checked a few weeks ago.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TSLA** jumped 4.6% on news that it was looking to expand to India. Don\u2019t know if that alone is good enough news to justify a pop like this alone, especially with rivals coming from every direction.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**American Airlines** dropped 2.4% when it released a lack luster 2Q revenue forecast this week.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TGT** continues to attract attention of hedge funds and investors with an impressive target of 211$ from Credit Suisse and a total of 78 hedge funds holding.  It has a 1.23% dividend as well so huzzah.  Wish I had held more of the shares I bought in the mid to high 60s a few years back! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**OPEN** came on my radar and bought \\~200$ of each.  Found it in a stock gum shoe article deducing it as the likely teased stock from MF\u2019s new real estate trailblazer big bucks subscription. Seems like a very interesting real estate disrupter. The market is ripe for disruption as buying/selling a house is far too cumbersome given all the technical tools at humanities fingertips.  This company makes cash offers on houses, do necessary renovations, and resell them. Instant gratification is the Achilles heel of modern Americans so this type of business that scratches that itch I think will go far. Just a matter of what companies take the space first and service the customer the best.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLong **Disney** until the IP laws change in this country. The amount of IP they own, from Marvel to Star Wars is just insane.  And they are continuing to churn new content in these hot spaces.  The Star Wars Disney+ offerings have proved popular, and Loki is right around the corner!  Consensus 1 yr target avg from Yahoo Finance is $207 which presents decent upside from current levels.  Wish they would bring the dividend back but they are sufficiently pushing growth initiatives that I won\u2019t complain too much at this time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLet\u2019s end with the question, what do you guys think of **Upstart**, a fin tech company? Are they sufficiently unique to distinguish themselves in the crowded market and get ahead of the primary players? Seems like loans are ripe for disruption given the archaic roots of the industry players, but will **Upstart** be a lead disruptor, or will it fall behind?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks for reading.",

        "selftext": "Sup apes. In my first [DD last week](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nxhh7d/crsr_dd_or_why_you_should_park_all_your_cash_in/), I gave a short rundown of why Corsair is incredibly undervalued, and how it should be in **everyone\u2019s portfolio**. With Part 2, I\u2019m addressing a lot of the comments I got as well as going a bit deeper into how Corsair will make this industry their bitch and reach ATH in 2021.  \n\n-\n\n\n**Why is Corsair in a strong position to leverage the gaming and streaming industry?**\n-\nCorsair didn\u2019t snooze, but rather spend the last years hunting for good companies to acquire. Being well funded, profitable and raking in cash every year allowed them to expand in all directions with a core focus on the fastest growing niche: Streaming. Have a look at their investor relations page:\n\n-\n\n*\u201cCorsair is a leading global provider and innovator of high-performance gear for gamers and content creators. Our industry-leading gaming gear helps digital athletes, from casual gamers to committed professionals, to perform at their peak across PC or console platforms, and our streaming gear enables creators to produce studio-quality content to share with friends or to broadcast to millions of fans.* \n\n*CORSAIR also includes subsidiary brands Elgato, which provides premium studio equipment and accessories for content creators, SCUF Gaming, which builds custom-designed controllers for competitive gamers, and **ORIGIN PC**, a builder of custom gaming and workstation desktop PCs and laptops.**\n\n-\nWith Elgato they positioned themselves years ago already to capitalize on one of the fastest growing entertainment subsegments (Streaming). While acquiring SCUF Gaming and ORIGIN PC allowed them to also expand and play in the console market as well as Pre Build PCs and laptops. **They basically moved up the ladder from RGB fans, keyboards, RAM sticks and Cases to EVERYTHING you need to play, stream or game properly.**\n\n**How much faster is Corsair really expanding?**\n-\n\nI cannot stress this enough, but their last quarter results really blew it completely out of the water. Seeing how they raised guidance, I think August will be even more brutal. One for value:\n\n* **$529.4 million** in net revenue, an increase of **71.6%** year-over-year. \n* **$175.9 million** net revenue for Gamer and creator peripherals segment, an increase of **131.9%** year-over-year.\n* Gross profit was **$160.3 million**, an increase of **103.9%** year-over-year, with a gross margin of 30.3%, an improvement of 480 basis points year-over-year. \n* Operating income was **$67.3 million**, an increase of **404.5%** year-over-year.\n* Adjusted operating income was **$80.4 million**, an increase of **221.4%** year-over-year.\n\n\n-\nDo yourself a favor and whip up a site like FinViz, punch in your favorite meme stock and have a look at their revenue number vs market cap. There\u2019s a reason why GME got picked up by DFV. Sales is still king and undervalued companies with aggressive growth have insane potential short and long term.\n\n-\n**Why hasn\u2019t it blown up yet to +100?**\n-\n\nThere is a good amount of chatter about two things. One being market manipulation, the other is that there is very little retail investor interest, compared to the amount of net sellers. The second point actually holds up, the stock never really got picked up by retail investors (or apes) and a lot of the commenters that did buy it up, mentioned how they were perfectly content with amassing shares every month while the price is still low. Pure but selfish value investing. \n\n-\n**Eagle What?**\n-\n\nThis one was also pointed out a lot. Corsair is owned by a private equity firm called EagleTree. They purchased the majority stake back in 2017 (which in turn allowed Corsair to expand much more aggressively) and now is obligated to reduce their share position over the next years until they only hold 10% of the company. \n\nThey currently hold 61.9%. The shares sold are mostly picked up by **Vanguard**, **Blackrock** and a few other small institutions, plus retail of course. Looking at insider transactions we can see that EagleTree usually sells shares twice a year with the last transaction happening **June 3rd 2021**. \n\nThis point doesn\u2019t concern me too much personally, as it\u2019s normal for private equity firms to reduce their stake after IPOs and Corsair is barely dipping $2 even with EagleTree selling 5 million shares. Now having sold their shares just now, it will probably be quiet for the next 6 months. \n\n-\n**Back to 2021 and how you can make money**\n-\n\nThey have a strong customer base which they've built up over the last 20 years, and thought f+ck it, let\u2019s go all in on this market. Tits and streaming? Amazing! Controllers for consoles? Let\u2019s do it. RGB Spinners on your lambo? Fuuckyea.\n\n-\n\nInstead of focusing on boring office peripherals that every Chinese company provides, they instead decided to slap RGB on everything and are loved for it. \n\n-\n\n**Now EagleTree is gonna continue doing what eagles do, and we will continue doing what apes do. I\u2019ll continue buying this company and watching their ER like a hawk while analysts jack themselves off over the sort of numbers Corsair hits out every quarter.**\n\n-\nI said it once, and I\u2019ll say it again. If you don\u2019t hold Corsair shares, you are pretty retarded. But since that\u2019s half the sub already, just do your wife\u2019s boyfriend a favour and pick up some shares while they are still dirt cheap. He will thank you for it once they hit **$70** or even blow through the stratosphere with **+$100.**\n\n-\n\n**TL:DR**\n\nCorsair CEO Smart. Put this in your boomer dad\u2019s portfolio (shares) and If you like gambling, buy some calls. \n\n-\n\nPosition: 100 shares at $33 and 12x 40$ Nov Calls. (yes I\u2019m poor, and you can do better).",

        "selftext": "You can see it all over reddit, twitter, youtube and any other social media.\n\nThere are people that have been trading for a few months that don't even know how to read an income statement or what is market cap, that suddenly sell themselves as experts and do what they believe to be sohisticated securities and market analysis, when in reality they are just glancing at a few lines on a chart or some text they don't understand and using it to confirm their bias. They live in this populist made-up reality where the world owes them something because they are oppressed and they are convinced that they predicted a global financial collapse when in reality they are just being played by market makers and heavily indebted companies that are trying to save themselves raising capital by issuing new shares. \n\nThen there's the crypto blokes, that know blockchain so well they probably never actually used it. They can't even recognize that all these coins including the big ones have almost zero use cases. You think these tokens are really going to become money, even with scalability problems that have remained unsolved for decades and a market that is easily maniuplated by falsely backed stablecoins issuers and a few exchanges? Do you actually believe these  charlatans  when no serious economist has ever said anything good about it?\n\nEven the guys and gals that are supposed to teach the average user personal finance just follow this mantra of buying and holding NASDAQ ETFs like they're the holy grail of investing, even if we are almost at an historic all time high in terms of valuations, even if everybody has forgotten that stocks are risky: I would like to see these people deal with crashes like 2000, 2009  or even with something similar to Japan. But of course, intrinsic value doesn't matter, right? Trying to value a stock like a bond is for boomers, we'll have endless growth. Let's price in the next centuries of earnings into every EV company.\n\nI honestly have to think that there is a good part of people that don't actually believe the narrative and just goes along with it to speculate and sell his bags to a more naive investor. That's why everyone, -and I say EVERYONE **including institutions**\\- scouts this website everyday just to find out what the next meme is going to be. \"What's the next worthless thing retail's going to pump this week? Just so I can get quickly in and out before it collapses\" ... since it's backed by zero fundamentals. It's a toxic and disgusting and opportunistic behaviour and it's a clear symptom of the presence of specuative fever in the markets. I'm not saying everything's necessairly a bubble, because prices could keep going up for years. But you have to recognize that animal spirits are through the roof.

I wouldn't be surprised if most of it came from hedge funds, trying to get people to buy in so they can drop the bag somewhere along the way. I have a theory, that banning the word \"Squeeze\" would remove the shit quality DD, in hopes of seeing some good, retarded plays, based on shit that may, or may not happen in the future.\n\nLike for example, SPCE is a retarded YOLO play, but there's an idea about its future. Gun stocks would be another retarded play if you were betting that CPI numbers will lead to raiding of stores, as people become desperate for supplies. However, most of the shit on it is \"bUY sHorT SqUeezE IncOmINg!!1!\" when the reality is that they want the price pumped up because now they have their position opened so they can make a quick buck. The amount of scrapers running over this reddit is so crazy that I could probably say \"Buy PLTR shares, short squeeze incoming\", and scrapers would be bought in within seconds, even if PLTR had 0% short interest.\n\nThus, I petition a temp ban of the word \"Squeeze\" in discussion, except for exceptional cases, where short interest is at 80%+ (This number can be negotiated). My bet is that DD quality will skyrocket, and if I could buy calls on it, I would be YOLOing on OTM ones, as far out as they go, because right now, DD is at an all-time low, so much so that I just skip the post.",

Did you try to get a huge infrastructure plan going for the US which includes streets, bridges, buildings and what not all built with steel? anything to do with steel **GOT FUCKING EXPENSIVE.**\n\n**Because Steel is in huge demand, because now that covid is falling back, people want to buy stuff, build stuff and all needs steel.

Do you see the problem?? CLF should AT LEAST be trading at 50% more than in january, but obviously, because a company has basic costs (running a furnace, personnel et cetera) - but at some point, with EVERY DOLLAR MORE THE PRODUCT COSTS, THE COMPANY WILL EARN DIRECTLY.\n\n\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\n\nLet's say producing a ton of steel costs 500$ in total.

Now if the steel price goes to 1500!, the company could make 1000$ profit. **Price doubled from 750$ per tonne, but PROFIT QUADRUPLED!**\n\nObviously there's a bit more to that, but that's the gist.\n\nWHY CLF - A CHAD CEO \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 :\n\nCEO LOURENCO GONCALVES is a fucking stud.

        "selftext": "Let me start by saying I've invested nearly $6MM in what I believe to be a generational investment opportunity brought about by significant cost disruption in satellite launch costs, innovations in marrying satellite technology to low-earth orbit (\"LEO\") applications, and advances in LTE network architecture.  We are early in the commercialization of LEO and $ASTS is at the vanguard.\n\nInside of SpaceX, most investors rest their hat on the value of Starlink, which will provide FIXED-POINT broadband to customers, albeit at very high costs and with unclear quality.  They value is at $40bn+.  This equates to $200 per share for $ASTS, by way of comparison.  So there \"is a there, there\" in terms of what we are playing for here.\n\nJust like Facebook found out after it's IPO, the real market is and always will be in **MOBILE**. Starlink cannot translate to mobile unless you intend to haul a trailer behind you with a satellite dish.  See below for an artist rendition of Starlink's mobile solution vs. ASTS' actual mobile solution - your existing handset\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Haha - let's get back to business...read on](https://preview.redd.it/g1qny0og6k571.png?width=918&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a6899104fbe13f6bf1e69417ade25940a9aee38b)\n\n$ASTS AST Spacemobile has re-imagined what's possible after the significant cost disruption in satellite launch, which has allowed it to marry two key innovations to provide satellite connectivity to A REGULAR MOBILE DEVICE:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. Because launch costs are just a fraction of what they used to be, $ASTS is launching satellites 10x as large as those of traditional satellite phone satellites. This allows the satellite to do the work, not the phone\n2. By innovating with software, $ASTS can make the satellite connection work with existing LTE      networks by only working with the carriers' ground terminals to compensate for the Doppler effect; importantly, ASTS works with any normal phone without requiring any modifications\n\nHere is the overview of the **FACTS**\n\n**PRODUCT:**\n\n\u2022 ASTS is building the first-of-a kind and **only** space-based cellular broadband network that is **direct-to-device**; a consumer\u2019s existing handset will work with ASTS\u2019s service in tandem with traditional terrestrial mobile service - ASTS also works with IoT enabled devices\n\n\u2022 The constellation utilizes low and mid-band frequencies shared with partners on a non-interference basis; ASTS does not use mobile satellite spectrum but instead delivers service over spectrum allocated for terrestrial mobile use\n\n\u2022 ASTS utilizes high throughput backhaul to terrestrial networks\n\n\u2022 The service will eliminate coverage gaps, is compatible with all phones, provides broadband data speeds, and is accessible via one-click on a user\u2019s device\n\n**MARKET:**\n\n\u2022 ASTS is targeting the large mobile 5G market, specifically in markets where terrestrial infrastructure (e.g. towers) is less developed\n\n\u2022 ASTS is a beneficiary of the following secular trends: i) falling launch costs, ii) high smartphone penetration, iii) broadband demand iv) 5G IoT proliferation\n\n\u2022 ASTS cites 3.3BN people who are covered but not connected to cellular broadband and another 700MM people who are not covered by existing networks and not connected\n\n\u2022 Key regional opportunities include India, Africa, and Equatorial regions\n\n\u2022 The service is well-suited for low/medium density sites as well as for emergency back-up during natural disasters\n\n**MANAGEMENT:**\n\n\u2022 CEO Avellan holds 18 patents and was the founder of Emerging Markets Communications (sold for $550MM in 2016)\n\n\u2022 The deep executive ranks include executives from Orbital ATK, Globecomm, NASA, and Maxar \u2022 The team has 161 scientists and engineers, 34 of whom are PhDs\n\n**COMPETITION:**\n\n\u2022 ASTS competes with high-cost legacy providers, including Iridium \u2022 Legacy satellite providers require unique handsets for users to connect\n\n\u2022 ASTS also competes with the build-out of standard terrestrial 5G mobile equipment \u2022 Competitor Lynk advertises a similar product but appears significantly behind both with respect to commercial, financial and technical milestones\n\n**OTHER:** Investors include Vodafone, Rakuten, American Tower, and Samsung; all of whom recently invested in the Company's latest financing.  The Company's own coverage banker at Barclays QUIT his job to join ASTS.  The dogs are eating the dog food.\n\n**TIMELINE:**\n\n\u2022 April 2019 \u2013 BW 1 was launched (the test satellite), validating system architecture and proving they could connect a mobile phone to a satellite and connect to an LTE system  \u2022 2H 2021E will launch BW3, which is a scaled version of the constellation satellite \u2022 2H 2022E/1H 2023E first commercial launches of 20 satellites for Equatorial coverage, with 110 satellites by YE 2023 and 168 satellites by YE 2024\n\n**ANALYSIS - THIS IS MY OPINION, AND SUBJECT TO DISCUSSION AND DISAGREEMENT**\n\n\u2022 ASTS is an exciting event-driven story stock with open-ended upside that is cemented in reality by proven entrepreneurs, significant industry backing, and *bone fide* strategic agreements in place that address key commercial aspects of the business\n\n\u2022 Management funded the seed capital for the business, highlighting their confidence and \u2018skin in the game\u2019\n\n\u2022 Targeting mobile 5G is a \u2018**big idea**\u2019 that augments that excitement generated by fixed-broadband players such as Starlink while addressing the cost accessibility issues that are likely to be present in developing markets\n\n\u2022 The stock benefits from a dynamic where it cannot be disproven, leaving investors free to speculate and discount key assumptions, including service penetration among partner carriers and ARPU\n\n\u2022 The investment set-up is favorable since a high capital intensity space venture is poorly suited for private markets, yet requires the capital available in the SPAC market \u2013 the set-up is not a \u2018foist\u2019 by private market investors onto unsuspecting retail investors but instead a legitimate capital raising exercise to fully-fund the project and remove financing risk\n\n\u2022 With 1-year lock-ups on existing investors and PIPE investors, there will be limited free float in what amounted to a \u201cpublic Series C\u201d financing\n\n\u2022 Given future CAPEX, Wall Street banks will see a large future banking opportunity and likely initiate favorable coverage on the Company\n\n**RISKS:**\n\n\u2022 While the *BlueWalker* satellite provided proof-of-concept, there are questions around whether ASTS will work at scale when the constellation is deployed\n\n\u2022 Users might experience significant battery drain on their devices when using the service, reducing appeal for full tower placement\n\n\u2022 Realized user penetration and ARPU remain uncertain as well as the ability to raise future capital for full system deployment at prices that avoid excessive dilution\n\n\u2022 ASTS will depend on capital markets to fully fund its growth and is susceptible to potential funding risk\n\n**INVESTMENT CHECKLIST:  Good hygiene to make sure something can make money as an investment**\n\n***BUSINESS MODEL***:  ASTS will receive a 50/50 revenue split with its carrier partners including Vodafone and AT\\&amp;T; given its large, fixed cost base, the Company expects to generate 90% asset-level EBITDA margins that provide significant operating leverage and cash flow\n\n***GO-TO-MARKET:***  In-place binding agreements with carriers provide ASTS with access to &gt;1.3BN existing customers without having to independently market to or acquire customers (or directly bear the cost of churn) \u2022 Phase 1 will target key Equatorial regions and cover 1.6BN people; subsequent phases expand into Europe and N. America \u2013 the total system will require 168 satellites by 2024\n\n***DEFENSIBILITY***: ASTS has 750+ patents as well as a first-mover advantage \u2022 Commercial progress reinforces the Company\u2019s technical lead in the market\n\n***CAPITAL***: ASTS is capital intensive and subject to capital availability to complete its full system \u2022 Once the constellation is complete, the Company benefits from extreme operating leverage and should have extremely high cash flow conversation\n\n***TRACTION***: ASTS appears to have extraordinary commercial partnership traction, however, it is yet unclear what end-user uptake the usage will be \u2022 Technical traction was \u2018proved\u2019 by the April 2019 launch of the *Bluewalker 1* test satellite\n\n***FINANCIALS***:  With a market cap of \\~$1.8bn, the company is expected to generate &gt;$1bn of EBITDA by 2024 based on 168 satellites launched, 27MM total subscribers, with an ARPU of $2.50 per user\n\nBelow are projections:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/q78k3rkk6k571.png?width=878&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7d03a94e2c9ae9c58e278e62d613cbf19d02dee8\n\nWhen thinking about a hypothetical valuation, I pro-forma the numbers and apply a multiple in-line with the tower companies.  I treat depreciation as a real cash expense\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xp15x4om6k571.png?width=488&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8fb6a1526b293fc54c82ed510c351f8288b69a1b\n\n**TECHNOLOGY DETAILS**\n\n***OVERVIEW***: AST &amp; Science (\u201cASTS\u201d) has designed a large aperture satellite system to provide \u2018direct-to-device\u2019 service to normal phones\n\n***BOOMBOX IN SPACE:***  ASTS\u2019 satellites are \\~10x bigger than the norm because they are essentially cell-phone towers in space. With a 900-square meter array, the system is a large **\u201cloud\u201d** system that can connect with a regular mobile phone. Traditional satellite phones \u201clisten hard\u201d whereas ASTS simply produces a loud signal to connect to regular mobile phones\n\n***SOFTWARE:***  ASTS\u2019 system does not require a special chipset on the phone because of its proprietary back-end software system that allows for interconnection to existing terrestrial spectrum and telecom networks. The \u201cmagic\u201d of the technology is the back-end software that allows the system to utilize terrestrial spectrum, seamlessly interconnect over existing networks, and talk directly to an LTE system; ASTS is 6G forward compatible\n\n***BACKHAUL***:  Once the signal is collected from a handset, ASTS sends the data back on B-Band satellite spectrum to a ground gateway system. The phone-satellite connection is native to the carrier\u2019s terrestrial spectrum\n\n***CAPACITY***:  Each satellite can handle 1.2MM GB per month; extra capacity can be added by directing additional satellites at an area\n\n***WHAT DO WE KNOW***:  What has ASTS done to prove its system?\n\no *Bluewalker1* proved the RF could close (e.g. the power was sufficient to connect a normal phone) and that an LTE connection was achievable utilizing ASTS\u2019 \u2018magic\u2019 software; ASTS launched a handset into space with the satellite on the ground to cost-effectively check an important element of technical diligence. *Bluewalker1* allowed for end-to-end connectivity testing, which has been reviewed over the last 1.5 years\n\no *Bluewalker3* (2H 2021 launch) will be a scaled version of the system, which will de-risk components and demonstrate the full technology. BW3 will allow for software debugging to tune the full system\n\n***RISKS***:  Most of the risks are timing risks. For instance, *Bluewalker3* could spur the need to tune microns, which could delay the system deployment by months. The troubleshooting required will be the beam forming in patterns to maintain a connection while managing handoffs\n\nA launch vehicle delay could delay the testing by 60 to 90 days\n\n***BENT PIPE***:  The satellite itself is not complex \u2013 it is bent pipe in the sky; most of the design relates to distributing power. The satellite itself is not involved with processing or routing\n\nDISCLOSURE: I own 500,401 shares of common. Yes, this is a huge position.

        "selftext": "Ok, first off. The volume on UWMC today was just fucking pathetic. I mean just fucking embarrassing. Let me tell you why we are missing a simple, straight forward, trip to tendie town.\n\nUWMC has had a nice run over the last month, up about 25% over that time and up 10% over the last week. This has run the share price to over $10 per share making the potential for us to get a little sweet gamma action with the 6/18 contracts looming.\n\nOpen interest on ITM calls is getting interesting. Already over 100k contracts are in the money, mostly between 9c and 10c. You could see the price action today as they try to beat the price down to 10.00 one last time (and the piss poor volume is making it easy for them) before hedging some of these positions. If we were to get over 11.00 by EOW, that's another 60k open interest on the 11c alone!! and this will force more buying to cover these contracts. You know what happens from here. This is why we are here.\n\nThe problem is the lack of volume. Again, 10 million volume today, for fuck sake people. With a float of 90m shares (I don't want to start a pissing match, but much smaller than CLOV and CLNE), this thing is not hard to move. With 25m volume on 6/9 we had an 8% move. With volume of 13m on 6/11 another 6% jump. After today the share price is sitting just above 10. I am a retard, and not a mathematician, but another 10% by EOW and then we party. Hookers, blow, whatever you want.\n\nIll cover this just cuz I know you retards get hard over the potential. &gt;15% short float. Not why I am here, but you never know once this things gets moving.\n\nNextly, the calls because this is a casino after all. 7/16 calls are very reasonable, fuck, I'd call them a god damn bargain for the potential we are looking at here. This thing has yet to lift off and the IV is still reasonable enough to jump on this gamma rocket.\n\nLast point I will make. UWMC is actually a solid company. I am not covering the fundamentals a ton, but holding a $10 UWMC bag is a lot more attractive than others I have seen gain steam recently. 4% dividend, upcoming 300m in share buy back, Revenue and EPS doubled from Q1 2020 to Q1 2021. Not even you can fuck this up. You make money now, you make money later, your kids make money in 20 years from your wise decision this week. Get a forward from your wife's bf on this weeks allowance and get you some of this action.\n\nPositions: 150 shares at 8.20 average, (24) 7/16 calls at various strike.\n\nTLDR: UWMC on the launch pad, needs a little more fuel.",

Not WallStreet-Down-with-Hedge-Funds.\n\nIt is WallStreet**BETS**. This sub was started to discuss and trade FD\u2019s. If you don\u2019t know what that means, then you probably don\u2019t belong here. This sub was dedicated to 0dte puts &amp; calls. Again, if that term is unfamiliar to you, then you probably shouldn't be here. This sub discusses strategies and plays on high-risk, short-duration, option contracts on stocks, stock indexes, ETF\u2019s, and related securities, namely **dailies**. This sub\u2019s idea of a long-term investment strategy is buying weeklies. This sub is most likely made up of people with ADHD, who can\u2019t see past tomorrow, and have already forgotten what they had for breakfast.\n\nOccasionally, the play may be to buy and hold a stock for a short duration, but that is an exception, not the rule. \n\nIf you want to buy and hold a security to effect change, or to stick it to the hedge funds, or to shake your fist at the Wall Street elite, then there are other subreddits for that. That is not **THIS** subreddit\u2019s mantra.\n\nThis sub has only one mantra: that is to make money daily. Period. We measure wins &amp; losses in 24-hr increments. And the only thing that counts is the amount in your account at the end of the day.\n\nThis sub is not a \u201cget-rich-quick\u201d scheme. That kind of thinking leads to \u201cget-poor-quick\u201d results. \n\nThis sub views the stock market as a casino. Like any casino, there are strategies you can employ to improve your odds. And that is what is (or should be) discussed here.\n\nAnd like a casino, there is a high degree of risk; including risk of total loss. Do not be fooled, you should expect losses. The stock market is a \u201czero-sum-game\u201d. For every winner, there must be a loser. It takes two (2) people to effect a trade. For every buyer, there is a seller. For every \u201c+\u201d, there is a \u201c-\u201c.\n\nThis sub is **NOT** a collective. Collective action is tantamount to collusion, which can lead to market manipulation, and that is **NOT** what this sub is about. That shit will get you 10 years in ClubFed.\n\nAnd lastly, for God\u2019s sake, we are **NOT** apes. If anything, we are **nerds**. Math nerds. Numbers nerds. And damn proud of it. We discuss the Greek\u2019s. And if you don\u2019t know what that means, then really, **REALLY**, you don\u2019t belong here.\n\nIf you want to lurk here and learn, then by all means, please do. Ask questions. We will most likely make fun of you, but ask. Someone nice will answer your question. \n\n**EDITORS NOTE**: Please excuse my very short account life. I am not an OG WSB, but I do get what the intention of this sub was, and I\u2019m getting tired of reading off-topic posts and comments. I came here to make money, not to rise up against the establishment.\n\n**TL;DR** : This is **NOT** a collective, this is a **CASINO**.",

Go look at the level 2 data.  The reason they've been able to short it so well and kill its price is because there just aren't many shares sold. It's the mother of all gamma squeezes.  It's literally buy calls for a penny, buy shares, get stinking rich. The increase in volatility alone would make it a big winner.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd the  best part?  You can buy more of these $13 calls for $0.01 before buying the shares to shoot it to  \ud83e\ude90  because volatility is basically 0 right now, which will make it even bigger. Not that it even matters, but the company itself is really cool too.

        "selftext": "You guys need some re-assurance or a reason to buy more AMC? Here's some dd. Last week and today AMC has had a very good rally, but this is just the beginning, now let me tell you why. (I know finance can be dense and complicated so i'll try to keep it simple)\n\n# TLDR\n\n\\- There's a lot of options between 30 and 40 being placed which causes market makers to buy more shares causing a Gamma Squeeze today and after hours. If more large option volume is placed tomorrow between 40-50 the Gamma Squeeze will keep going. \n\n\\- Short holders will lose a lot of money as share price continues up, forcing them to buy more AMC to close their position sometime through the week. \n\n\\- \ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf11\ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf11\ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf11\n\n# DD\n\nThe past few weeks have been great for meme stocks, but AMC is leading at the frontline of this rally outperforming the others like GME, BB, etc, boasting a 112% increase the past week. One of the reasons i've been able to hold confidence in, is AMC's option volume. A call is a promise to sell you 100 shares of a stock at a certain price. Behind this contract, are people called Market Makers. These are people sitting at Wallstreet, writing contracts for people to buy options if there is a lack of supply. Now let's look at the option chain for today expiring next week\n\n[Weekly call options from yahoo finance](https://preview.redd.it/4k3vjjb70r271.jpg?width=1327&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0358dcc16a0a79ffbb1bbc292969a0c4f035494b)\n\nIf we look at the 3rd column from the right, that's the current volume of call options. Whenever people buy options, in order for market makers to minimize as much risk as possible, they buy stock in order to stay \"delta neutral\". Fancy phrase I know. A very basic explanation is that no matter where the stock moves, the market makers don't lose money. Their goal isn't to bet against you, their goal is to scalp the bid/ask margins. Now notice how the option volume is particularly high at 30, 35, and 40. As the price moves closer to these strike prices, market makers got to buy more shares in order to stay delta neutral. Now with this high volume, market makers need to buy **A LOT** more shares everytime the price goes up, which then snowballs larger and larger causing something called a \"Gamma squeeze\", which basically means STONK GO UP. Last week a similar phenomenon occured, now we can see it will especially rally up at the 30 (which it did), 35(which it did), and 40 mark (soon to come). Once we get closer to 40 hopefully tomorrow there will be more options being placed in order for the Gamma squeeze to continue, but until then we have the next phase.... the famous.... short squeeze...\n\nGamma squeeze is caused by an incrementation of options being placed which causes market makers to buy more shares to minimize their risk. Now that we've hit this point, the price has gone up a lot. Today alone AMC went up 40%. And. that. is. big. oh. no. to. short holders. Short holders are holding AMC to profit off of AMC to go down, luckily for us, these guys have not learnt their lesson! With AMC mooning from the Gamma squeezes, short holders will be hard red and and are **forced** to close out of their short position, requiring them to buy AMC driving the price up even further! This is what brought GME to it's peak of 400$/share. If we look at the short interest a month ago. \n\n[Last month short interest from Ortex](https://preview.redd.it/2k2ey4k64r271.jpg?width=1180&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1ab47fb7e917b0fb861253378e6f95c613cf080a)\n\nWe can see here AMC was 20% shorted. Through the month short holders continued to close more and more causing AMC to go up and up. This drove the value higher and higher, and now AMC is busting 38$/share. Now notice that cute little tick at the bottom. \n\n[Two week ago short interest from Ortex](https://preview.redd.it/a1uk4ca35r271.png?width=1428&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8aee30112fd867588b91a90a2870ac60bf3bb619)\n\nWe can see here AMC short interest dropped to 16% but it looks like these short holders are doubling down and are increasing their short position. Today alone we busted 40% increase in AMC, if we can keep going we can make short holders force to close and climb even higher heights. 16-20% doesn't seem like much, but doing the math.... \n\nTotal shares in circulation = 448m ([taken from yahoo finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMC/key-statistics/))\n\nFloat % = 18% (paid ortex subscription as shown above)\n\nShares shorted = 80.6million\n\n80.6 \\* 37$ (current AMC share value at the time of writing) = $2.983b\n\n.... needed to buy AMC. And that's before the AMC rocket takes off, it'll be even more while the rocket flies. So if any of you need any extra re-assurance, or a reason to put more money in, here ya go. If you guys want to continue the Gamma Squeeze, keep in mind the price needs momentum to carry up. Don't buy ridiculously far out call options like 70s or 80s because that won't give the stock an opportunity to climb up the 40s-60s range. It needs to be an incremental climb. \n\nThis is not financial advice, do your own research, and if you got any corrections for me please let me know! I'll edit my post or remove it completely if i missed/did something wrong\n\n# Reversal\n\nI'd be bs'ing you if i didn't say that this could go horribly wrong. The narrative i explained isn't **guaranteed to work**. In the case of bad news, or a large sell off, this can cause the price to fall or halt. Then the Gamma squeeze can't be sqoze which will then prevent the Short squeeze. Another point to keep in mind is we don't know **exactly** when the short holders will cover. They can double down and wait us out, but if we can keep the Gamma squeeze going, they'll have to close. To hold shorts you must pay a premium of [10%](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/AMC) every year to hold onto the shorts. This fee can increase though, and it has been steadily increasing as the price continues to go up. Please don't bet more than you can lose in case of these events. As for me, i'm waking up at market open tomorrow and yolo'ing the rest of my 10k into more call options before the rocket blasts.  \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf11\ud83c\udf11\ud83c\udf11",

        "selftext": "Hello, \"Apes\".  it is I...also....ape.  Yes, ape.  Here to bless you with lots of rocket emojis and bananas as I am clearly one of you.  Or something.  We still say on fleek, right? I mean, I totally know, but I'm not sure if you, too, are...you know, fellow ape....\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHmm, it seems as though my emoji keyboard has been replaced with a regular Boomer keyboard.  This makes fellow ape very angry, and I will certainly go out in seek of a real keyboard after this, ape honor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyhow, I've seen an enormous amount of confusion from the, you know, \"non-apes\", about what $CLNE's contract with $AMZN is.  So this will all be review to you because you guys CLEARLY are savvy and intelligent investors who don't get led by the nose by bots, but for the non-apes, this will be good information.  So let's talk about it:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# What's the deal:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn late April, $CLNE entered into an agreement with $AMZN to provide their carbon-negative RNG fuel to $AMZN trucks nationwide.  This deal called for $CLNE to construct an additional 19 Clean Energy fueling stations in addition to the 27 stations $CLNE had astutely built right next to $AMZN's warehouse as part of the long game to get out of the friend zone with them.  In exchange for this consideration, $AMZN will be buying a fleet of RNG capable vehicles and purchasing, at a minimum to complete the arrangement, over 200 million gallons of RNG as part of their goal to become carbon neutral by 2025 - and as the most green fuel in the world, RNG represents a big chunk of being able to fudge some carbon footprint in other areas by overcompensating in fuel.  To make this deal attractive to Bezos, ape-in-training Andrew Littlefair worked a deal to issue up to 53,141,755 shares of $CLNE stock via warrants at a cost basis of $13.49,  to be executed at various gates over the next 10 years.  That represents about 27% of the company.  But you smart and intellectual apes already knew that.  I mean, obviously.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe first 13,283,445 shares are fully vested upon the execution of the agreement and an affirmative vote by the shareholders, many of which are you apes because you were so smart as to buy $CLNE without having to be beaten over the head with picking a decent company for once.  That happened today.  The remaining 39,858,310 are only able to be executed by Amazon if they buy fuel - a lot of it.  Half a billion dollars of it by today's value, which most people estimate will be worth 1.5 billion over the next 10 years as prices rise.   Again, you smart apes already knew this and know that, with a present market cap of only 2.23 billion dollars, this 1.5 billion represents almost the entire value of the company as it sits today.  I don't know why I keep telling you things you clearly already know.  It must be because I am not a smart ape like you.  Amazon, of course, only signed this deal because they figure that 13.49 they'll pay per share is a bargain compared to what the company will be worth as they stepdaughter swap $CLNE out to all their buddies for corporate porn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Now, the part the less intelligent \"non-apes\" don't seem to grasp, but the most important part:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLess discussed is the fact that $AMZN, under terms of the deal, will never be permitted to own more than 5% of the company at any given point.  If they ever go over, they've got to give up some shares of the company.  This is the most important part of that entire deal, and it's the part most people don't seem to understand or one they disregard as irrelevant.  Basically, no more situations like CLNE is in with $TOT right now where that company owned 20% of $CLNE at one-fucking-penny per share, and has been fucking the stock price for almost 2 months as they de-leveraged with their 800 baggers.  Obviously, $AMZN is going to want more than the $13.49 a share they're paying, which means it's in their best interests to see to it that $CLNE is worth as much as possible.  Which very likely means buying more fuel than required as well as \"gently nudging\" their distribution partners to go RNG, as well.  And by gently nudging, obviously I mean \"waterboarding until they comply\".  You're already starting to see some of the results of this, with a deal being worked out between $UPS and $CLNE, completely of their own free will of course, to partner up for RNG contracts.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Why does any of this matter?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAgain, all you apes that are clearly more smart than me, \"fellow ape\", but clearly not as clever as the ape collective, you know this, but it's this:  If $AMZN's \"win\" in this deal is acquisition of diluted shares which they will not be able to actually keep, then in order for $AMZN to \"win\", they have to be able to sell those shares for more than $13.49 as they keep at their 5% ownership ceiling.  The floor on $CLNE's price should not be 13.49 because that's what $AMZN is paying, that's wrong, and everybody who's been saying that has had it backwards.  The floor should be 13.49 because that's what $AMZN's cost basis for compulsory  SELLING is.  And I guarantee you $AMZN didn't agree to pay $13.49 a share on top of 3-something a gallon for cow farts to break even or lose money.  Confusing, I know.  I mean, my 6 year old would probably figure it out if she had an extra chromosome, but I failed as a genetic donor and she only has the standard 46.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo there the \"non apes\" have it, because I know all you real apes not only already had this figured out, but definitely didn't get suckered into buying $WOOF because a botnet told you to today or paperhanded shares in $CLNE when it dipped 10 cents rather than shooting straight up during the investor meeting after all the non-apes got distracted and FOMO'd into some losses and started creating confusion about what this $AMZN deal actually was by displaying they didn't understand it.  Damn non-apes, am I right, um...fellow...ape?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL:DR:  Bezos is smart ape.  And you are clearly smart ape.  Smart apes hang out with each other.  This is just like being Bezos.  Except better than Bezos, because you smart apes can keep buying more shares.  Poor Jeff can't.  Jeff's not as wise an ape as a WSB ape.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFear and Loathing,\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-CD",

The site, which requires stockholders to self-identify and sign-up for the chain\u2019s loyalty program, contains \u201cspecial offers\u201d and company updates.**\n\nOne of those special offers is a free tub of popcorn.\n\nAMC\u2019s retail investors have [propped up company since January](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/01/amcs-ceo-wants-to-use-the-meme-frenzy-as-a-springboard-for-growth.html), sending the stock up more than 1,400% in the last five months. Shares were up more than 20% in premarket trading Wednesday. \n\nThe company said it had 3.2 million individual shareholders as of March 11, who own about 80% of the 450 million shares outstanding. Many of them were inspired by the r/wallstreetbets Reddit page to purchase the stock. The forum selected several companies that were being shorted by large hedge fund groups and decided to take action.\n\nCEO Adam Aron has praised these investors for their support. The company delayed its annual shareholders meeting by more than a month in order to give these investors an opportunity to attend the event and \u201cmake their important voices heard.\u201d\n\nAron and AMC both plan to [donate $50,000 to the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/07/amc-ceo-adam-aron-raved-about-its-reddit-investors-on-an-earnings-call.html) \u2014 a clear nod to these new investors, who call themselves apes and refer to Aron as \u201cSilverback.\u201d AMC also has shifted its communication style to speak directly with shareholders via social media, including YouTube. Aron has even taken a renewed interest in Twitter, \u201cfollowing\u201d hundreds of accounts tied to the \u201cape army.\u201d\n\nAMC Investor Connect is the next step in the company\u2019s strategy of connecting with these investors. The platform provides shareholders with exclusive promotions, like free or discounted items and invitations to special screenings, as well as direct communications with Aron.\n\n\u201cDuring my five-plus year tenure as CEO at AMC, I\u2019ve taken great pride in the relationships I have forged with AMC\u2019s owners,\u201d Aron said in a statement Wednesday**. \u201cWith AMC Investor Connect, that effort in relationship building will continue apace even if our shareholders now number in the millions.

        "selftext": "Wood is crazy expensive right now. and most seem to believe that the cost is driven by the demand for wood. But financial statements from 4 of the top 5 companies argues another excuse. According to [Sawmill DB](https://www.sawmilldatabase.com/productiontoplist.php?continent_id=998), the top 5 production mills in the US are: West Fraser, Canfor, Weyerhaeuser, Georgia Pacific (Not PT), and Resolute forests. Since GP is not publicly traded everything I share will not include them. \n\nOne thing I noticed with all of these companies is that in the past year their stock price has sky rocketed. \n\n* West Fraser: 130% \n\n* Canfor 180%\n\n* Weyerhaeuser 80%\n\n* Resolute Forest **500%**\n\nWhy is their price doing this? it isn't like wsb is simping over it. \n\nLooking at all of their filings for the SEC tells you exactly why their price has jumped. it will also tell you why the price of wood has also skyrocketed. and it isnt a jump in demand that caused their price to raise or the price of wood to raise. These companies are just selling them for higher prices and pocketing the excess profit.\n\nThere are 4 data points that support the artificial jump in prices. Inventories, Sales, COGS, and New Earnings. below is the data for all 4 companies. \n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**West Fraser**\n\n\n:) | Q1.2021 | Q1.2020 | increase of\n---|-------|-------|-----------\nInventories | 1,137,000,000 | 735,000,000 | 21%\nSales | 2,343,000,000* | 890,000,000 | 163%\nCOGS | 1,039,000,000 | 630,000,000 | 65%\nSelling, G and A | 78,000,000 | 41,000,000 | 90%\nNet Earnings | 665,000,000 | 9,000,000(no this is not a typo) | **7289%**\n\n*their acquisition of norbord was 707,000,000 of that unfortunately COGS for it isn't available. \n\nWest Fraser has seen a jump in net earnings of over 7k percent. In one year they grew their net earnings by over 72x. COGS only increased by 65% which means the price of lumber or getting the lumber hasn't changed. This jump in COGS is likely due to Norbord. So even taking that out of the equation would mean they doubled their sales in a year. That is absolutely nuts. That is a profit margin that went from 2.4% to 66%. that is not normal, either. but we aren't done lets look at the other companies.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n**Canfor**\n\n\n:) | Q4.2020 | Q4.2019 | Increase of\n--|-------|-------|-----------\nInventories | 867,500,000 | 803,900,000 | 8%\nSales | 5,454,400,000 | 4,658,300,000 | 17%\nCOGS | 3,538,800,000 | 3,618,600,00 | -2%\nSelling, G and A | 127,900,000 | 124,900,000 | 2.4%\nNet Earnings | 559,900,000 | -269,700,000 | WTF?\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n**Weyerhaeuser**\n\n\n:) | Q1.2021 | Q1.2020 | Increase Of\n--|-------|-------|-----------\nInventories | 505,000,000 | 443,000,000 | 14%\nSales | 2,506,000,000 | 1,728,000,000 | 45%\nCOGS | 1,430,000,000 | 1,382,000,000 | 3%\nSelling, G and A | 90,000,000 | 74,000,000 | 22%\nNet Earnings | 681,000,000 | 150,000,000 | 354%\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n**Resolute Forest Products**\n\n\n\n3 months ending March 31st | 2021 | 2020 | Increase Of\n--------------------------|----|----|-----------\ninventories | 512,000,000 | 462,000,000 | 11%\nSales | 873,000,000 | 689,000,000 | 27%\nCOGS | 522,000,000 | 524,000,000 | ~\nSelling, G and A | 46,000,000 | 34,000,000 | 35%\nNet Earnings | 87,000,000 | -1,000,000 | another one turning things around\n\n\nSome interesting things to point out:\n\n* all these companies have a significant increase in profit margin. 2 of them were able to reverse their position and get positive earnings, while the other 2 were able to increase their net earnings by significant amounts. \n\n* in 3 of these cases, the increase in sale revenue was something to brag about. while the remaining company looks like they're geniuses for the growth they had. All of them did this with out having a huge jump in COGS. I include West Fraser in this because they acquired a company in Q1 of this year. for this reason I bet their COGS would like the same withholding their new acquisition. \n\n* Although \"Selling, G&amp;A\" is not nearly as important or necessary as the others it is still necessary to show that any increase in lumber is due to labor. I assume labor is incorporated in COGS but I want to provide this for anyone reading this and wondering if they may be putting labor into a different classification. That was my first though when I saw COGS didnt jump as high as sales.\n\n* Inventories for all companies were marginally impacted. The growth they experienced I'd say is probably just volatility due to seasonal reasons. but an interesting tidbit I want to share is that all of these companies blame the increase in prices on the pandemic claiming that it had a negative impact on the supply side. but as you can tell all companies have a growth in their inventories. All but Resolute Forest value their inventories using the lower of costs. meaning that discounting the growth in inventories should be done to a minimum. They also blame an increase of demand from people working at home for the increase in business. This makes sense. But when you include the fact that the price of wood has doubled since last year it's a little bit unreasonable to say that the massive increase in revenue is due strictly to demand side. More than likely they increased wood prices is to make up for any lack in profits they would have gotten and now they don't want to lower them because they see how much more money they're making. \n\nEverything I shared with you is because a friend at work noticed this with west fraser. I wanted to confirm that this was a market wide phenomenon. I think it is safe to say that the increase in wood isnt market force related but rather artificially inflated reasons. Let me know what you think in the comments. This is my first time ever sharing research I did and If I missed a crucial step I would love the critique. If I get good at doing this I will probably submit more findings I have in the future. Thank you.",

        "selftext": "As the Fed caused a bit of a ripple in the market today and I considered vacating a position (but ultimately didn't).  I thought a little bit about my journey over the years and thought I'd share a story and a few things I've learned.\n\nBack in 2003, I made my first move in the stock market by taking an $1800 tax return and buying 200 shares of a coal company called Consol.  At the time it traded under the symbol CNX.  I bought it with almost no DD simply because it paid a pretty good dividend.  (Around .50/share if I recall correctly.)  This is back when internet trading really wasn't a thing.  I bought it through my bank and the trade cost me **$40**!  (I actually had to call a broker at my bank and place the trade over the phone.  Ancient times, right?)  lol  I figured, win lose or draw, eventually this stock will pay for itself with the dividend.  I didn't follow the market much after that because I was really holding for the dividend, but realized a couple of years later, it had climbed into the 30s.  Around 2007 it had hit 55 and I decided to sell.  Still with my bank, the trade cost me another forty bucks!  I took the money and put it in a basic savings account where it basically sat doing nothing until 2016.  (I missed the crash of 08, by being liquid at the time, but this was pure luck.  Nobody saw that coming.)\n\nIn 2016, after some reading I decided I had more confidence in trading so I took the money and opened an investor's checking/trading account with Charles Schwab.  *I was amazed at trades costing $4.99 and done on my laptop*!  lol  After quite a bit of DD I decided to buy 300 shares of NVIDIA.  At around $24 a share, it cost me about $7200.  (I took the rest and made a down payment on a new (*used*) car and an AK-47.)  lol...\n\nAfter that, I just held the stock.  Diamond handed it as the kids say.  I've bought and sold quite a few other stocks over the years, but those two trades are where I started.  Two trades over the course of 17 years turned an $1800 tax return into a nice safety net worth over $200,000 with almost no effort on my part.\n\nWhat have I learned?\n\nEven a small amount of money in the stock market can lead to a big return.  But don't invest more than you can afford.  For me, a tax return one year was about all I could throw at it in my 20s.  \"YOLOing\" your rent check is never a good idea.\n\nBe PATIENT.  You're not going to get rich overnight.  That type of thing is rare and risky.  Do your DD and hold onto what you're confident in.\n\nWhen the market takes a downturn, **BUY!**  One of my biggest regrets is not investing heavily in 2008 when I was very liquid and the market had taken a nose dive.  I did not repeat this mistake last April/May when the pandemic caused another crash.  I bought everything I could.  Particularly old giants like Ford, and GE which were no brainer bargains at &gt;$5.  The worst thing you can do is panic sell.  The market will come back.  Hold on and accumulate.  (I actually figured it might take 2 years for a comeback this time, but we bounced back much earlier.)  This thinking is what got me to hold the position I was thinking of bailing on today, when I realized I would just be panic selling in advance of some Fed news.  Regardless of the news, the market would bounce back.\n\nNever let savings sit in a traditional savings account. (*like I did for 8 years from 2007-2016...lol)*  Even if compound interest is all you're after, there are much better rates with other financial products.\n\nBe patient, *but don't be afraid to take profits*.  Don't fall in love.  Have an exit plan.  I sold Consol around 55 with a 9 entry.  Pretty good...  Later that same year, it climbed into the 90s.  Made me wince, but I didn't regret it.  *Unless you have a crystal ball, you're never going to enter at a historic low and exit at an all time high and that's ok.*  I realized at the time that coal was cyclical and was most likely going to decline in value in the coming years.  I stuck to the plan.  When I saw a spike, I sold.  For perspective, that high in the 90s in 08 hasn't been repeated since.  Consol trades in the high teens now and offers no dividend. (New ticker CEIX)  So in hindight I exited on a bubble that could have been better, but if I waited too long, it could have been much worse.\n\nIt's never too late to start.  If you look at those two simple trades over the span of 17 years, you could potentially do the same thing in your late 40s with a small amount of money (*remember nothing you can't afford to lose)* and have a decent nest egg by the time you hit 100% retirement in your 60s.\n\nI hope to have given a little insight here.  I thought it was worth sharing.  If you disagree, don't be too hard on me.  I'm not a financial professional...  :D\n\nHave a good'un!",

        "selftext": "This post is in continuation of a series of posts I made in the previous weeks. The response I received was amazing and a lot of you were asking for continued weekly updates. I have also added the Week-on-Week stock price change due to popular requests. \n\nThe market, in general, has continued to rally strongly and it has been a pretty good week for investors. The top growing stocks I [shared last week](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ntlyqy/i_built_a_program_that_tracks_mentions_and/) had made an average return of 6.6% with Workhorse Group making a whopping 19% return in one week! Now, let\u2019s jump right into this week\u2019s list!\n\n**Most Discussed Stocks of the Week**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p9znai9z91571.png?width=1042&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=064000d3d54a7e847dc1bec4905f9380db5e05c8\n\nAMC and BB are now the top 2 most discussed stock! Both generated almost the same amount of discussion, but investors, in general, were more bullish about Blackberry as reflected in the sentiment. The returns on both the stocks were muted with AMC and BB returning just 3% and 2% respectively. ECommerce platform ContextLogic(WISH) had a wild ride with the stock rising 90% and then dropping 46% over the next two days. Investor returns wise, Clover health is the front runner returning an insane 67% in one week. Also, Tesla dropped out of the top 10 list for the first time in 2021!\n\n**Top Growing Stocks of the Week**\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/s5j78yn0a1571.png?width=1233&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=241763eda48057740436f648ba342b56a7999cd4)\n\nAbove is the list of stocks that have exploded in the number of mentions throughout social media.\n\n**Wendys($WEN):**\u00a0This was definitely a long time coming. Wendys shares soared more than 19% on Tuesday after the company became a meme stock in Reddit. There was no new fundamental news from the company that changed the investment perspective other than an announcement that the company will bring back its popular Summer Strawberry Chicken Salad.\n\n**Clover Health($CLOV):**\u00a0had its best week yet since inception with the stock returning 67% in just one week. Reddit investors sparked another rally with the stock price soaring more than 200% and then fell sharply! The stock was trading at 6 times the normal volume. Even though the company has an optimistic business model, the current rally was predominantly driven by CLOV\u2019s high short interest (43%)!\n\n**Senseonics Holdings($SENS):**\u00a0$SENS exploded in mentions and the stock jumped 22% during intraday trading without any new news from the company. Its a small Maryland-based pharma company, which specializes in the development of products made to ease the burden of diabetes monitoring. The company had announced news of a promising trial but that was long back. The current rally was majorly based on its short interest (25%) and increasing chatter!\n\n**Clean Energy Fuels($CLNE):**\u00a0$CLNE had a wild week with the stock shooting up 31% on Wednesday due to the retail crowd but then promptly tumbled 17% in Thursday afternoon trading. The drop was due to the information that its largest shareholder reduced their stake in the company by 1.25 Million shares. The retail crowd is still extremely bullish on the stock as seen by the sentiment.\n\n**Invesco Mortgage($IVR):** The company had a spectacular crash at the beginning of the pandemic with the shares losing almost 90% of its value. It has been growing slowly over the past few months. The stock was trending in relation to the current uncertainty regarding inflation rates and how Fed is going to adjust its rates.\n\n**Honorable Mentions:**\u00a0ContextLogic($WISH) chatter grew by 487% and UWM Holdings($UWMC) by 373% but were not high enough to make the top 5 list. Another interesting finding from my program is that mentions of CPI (Consumer Price Index) grew by more than 900% last week showcasing the rising discussion about inflation and its impact among investors.\n\nHope you enjoyed this week\u2019s top stocks issue! \u00a0\n\n*Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor.*",

        "selftext": "Hey All,\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I'm brand new to WSB but bear with me. Once upon a time, when I was very down on my luck, I walked into a temp agency and asked for any job they could give me. What they had was a factory assembly worker on the line at Blackberry in my hometown of Waterloo, Canada (yep...Canadian alert!). It was a 12hr job with day/night swapping shifts. It was a repetative, monotonous job putting screws into things and doing it all in style in a zero static white suit and blue boots. It was most definitely NOT what I had envisioned for myself for the rest of my life. However, that job would turn out to be one of the most rewarding short-term jobs I've ever had because I sat next to some truly wonderful people on the assembly line. \n\nWith nothing to do for 12hrs but shoot the sh\\*t, I soon discovered that I was sitting next to doctors from Iran, lawyers from Indonesia, CEOs from Pakistan. Each of them had come to this job out of desperation just like me. Each of them were deemed \"overqualified\" by most other jobs just like me. Each of them had worked hard, invested in company shares (BB had an amazing employee share program) and had made more money there than they could have dreamed. BB had given them the promise of a real future in Canada and you could see the passion they had for this company in their faces. Also, BB once a year rented out the Air Canada Centre (or Rogers or whatever the hell its called now...) and rented a rock band for their employees! Like...ALL of their employees...not just management. I saw ACDC, Steven Tyler, Van Halen and the Tragically Hip. All thanks to BB. They wanted to spread the love. \n\nSo I got over myself and how I wasn't where I wanted to be, and I used this job to give myself a crash-course on global politics from the amazing people I worked with. I learned about the so-called \"scary\" parts of the world and how beautiful they actually were. When the time came to leave that job and move on to other things, I left with a profound appreciation for hard-working immigrants and just how much dedication it takes to sit down at a factory bench with a $200k salary potential education, and screw things together for $14/hr. I'll never forget those people. And I'll never forget that company. Blackberry gave life, employment, education grants, city improvements and other amazing opportunities to my hometown of Waterloo. When the time came that Apple overtook them and Blackberry faltered, my hometown and the rest of Canada turned its back on them, and that disgusted me. \n\nTHAT is why I am investing in BB today. Not for a get-rich-quick scheme, but because I genuinely hold a special place in my heart for that company and can find way more emotional attachment to it than a TV channel I used to watch, and a place where I used to buy Ace Combat as a kid. \n\nTLDR; BB was once the bright future of Canadian tech industry, it carried me through tough times as an employee, and I respect it.",

Based on this comparison analysis it's a **massively undervalued** company that's leading charge in EV, iot, connected cars, ai cybersecurity. Rest of these companies only provide a small component of Unified Endpoint Security (UES), only Blackberry provides all components you need for **UES (next gen security architecture)!**! Meaning, an enterprise or government only needs to use a single platform **blackberry spark** to enable UES across their network of iot (computer, laptop, servers, phones, drones, cars, etc). The other companies only provide small part of UES, so it's more expensive for enterprise to go with other companies because then they have to deal with multiple companies to enable UES. Example, crowdstrike only provides Cybersecurity and does not provide Unified Endpoint Management (UEM) or Car operating system. **To enabled smart and connected future you need UES, UEM, Car Operating system and ai security and only blackberry has all these under a single platform!!!!**\n\n**Blackberry Spark has UES and UEM**. No other companies listed in this table provides both solution. \n\nBlackberry leads in car security and operating system...none of these other companies have car software. \n\nBlackbery owns 70% of ai cybersecurity patents and has the most advanced and mature machine learning model. the model prevents cyber attacks before they happen...meaning it prevents the attack from executing!! All together blackberry has **40,000 patents**!! \n\nSo at this moment the company's leadership in EV and iot and cybersecurity should value it around 70-80 Billion or at MINIMUM $140 a stock!!\n\nThis is just my analysis and DD. Please invest after doing your own DD. This is not a financial advice. \n\n**Wish you all apes Godspeed**!!! you all have found a true diamond!!",

        "selftext": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/federal-reserve-meeting-interest-rates-bond-purchases-june-2021-11623777582\n\nWASHINGTON\u2014Federal Reserve officials signaled they expect to raise interest rates by late 2023, sooner than they anticipated in March, as the economy recovers rapidly from the effects of the pandemic and inflation heats up.\n\nTheir median projection showed they anticipate lifting their benchmark rate to 0.6% from near zero by the end of 2023. In March they had expected to hold it steady through that year.\nPrompting the policy shift is a much\u00a0stronger economic rebound\u00a0and\u00a0hotter inflation\u00a0than the Fed anticipated just a few months ago.\n\n\u201cProgress on vaccinations has reduced the spread of Covid-19 in the United States,\u201d the Fed said in a statement following a two-day policy meeting. \u201cAmid this progress and strong policy support, indicators of economic activity and employment have strengthened.\u201d\n\nIn updated projections released Wednesday 13 of 18 officials indicated they expect to lift short-term rates by the end of 2023, up from seven who expected that outcome in March. In March, most of them anticipated holding rates steady through 2023.\n\nThe Fed has held overnight interest rates steady since March 2020, when the effects of the pandemic caused the sharpest economic contraction in generations. The central bank also has been purchasing at least $120 billion a month of Treasury and mortgage bonds since June 2020 to hold down longer-term borrowing costs, providing further support to the recovery.\n\nThe Fed reiterated that it expects to continue bond purchases until \u201csubstantial further progress\u201d has been made in the recovery.\n\nFed officials want the economy to get closer to their goals of \u201cmaximum employment\u201d and sustained, 2% inflation before reducing the bond purchases. They have said they want to fully achieve those objectives before they raise interest rates.\n\nSince officials\u2019 previous meeting, in April, the labor market\u2019s progress has been somewhat slower than they had anticipated. Employers added 837,000 jobs in April and May, leaving total employment 7.6 million jobs shy of pre-pandemic levels.\n\nPolicy makers have become less confident\u00a0in recent weeks the economy can recover all the jobs lost amid the pandemic without spurring inflation. Some 2.6 million people retired between February 2020 and April, according to estimates from the Dallas Fed. A steadily aging U.S. population suggests limited scope for reversing that trend, some economists say.\n\nIn contrast, inflation has been higher than expected. The Labor Department\u2019s consumer-price index\u00a0rose 5% in May\u00a0from a year earlier.\n\nThat inflation rate, the highest since 2008, makes the Fed uncomfortable, even if officials believe it reflects mostly temporary factors that should fade later this year. They worry that if inflation exceeds 2% too much or for too long, it might lead businesses and consumers to anticipate more inflation in the future, which can become self-fulfilling. Evidence of rising inflation expectations would likely require the Fed to tighten policy sooner or more aggressively than planned to re-anchor those expectations around 2%.",

So what? What's the problem? Since naked shorting is so transparently an opportunity for market manipulation and fraud, there must be some rationale for why it exists, right?\n\nWhat's the worst that could happen if market makers were not able to nakedly short?",

        "selftext": "So I\u2019m not gonna dive really deep into this but there is a good possibility that we\u2019re looking full face into another recession/market crash. Even Michael Burry is predicting it\u2026(SEC made him shut down his Twitter account)\n\nThe first and best thing you can do to position yourself for being financially stable after a rocket ride to the moon is PAY OFF all of your debt. House, cars, cards, loans, etc\u2026then you are slave to no man, woman, corporation etc\u2026\n\nNext i would strongly recommend establishing an emergency fund of 6-12 months of expenses\u2026or more. If you have NO DEBT then this will be easier to accomplish. Choose what you want, Gold, cr$pto, silver, ammo, whatever will help pay the bills and protect you and yours.\n\nThen (and I\u2019m still doing my own DD) find some funds that are low risk, and increase with inflation. Also remember that interest rates are at an all time low right now! The ONLY place for them to go is UP!! So find some funds that give you gains as interest rates rise. \n\nFinally if you are able, wisely help others with your newfound wealth and abilities and NEVER NEVER NEVER forget where you came from and the sacrifices made for you, and by you on the way to the moon!\n\nPlease comment with any helpful info especially if you have DD on good funds that protect / help as mentioned above.\n\nThis is NOT financial advice it is life advice, from one crayon eating dumb money APE \ud83e\udd8d to another. Peace and may the odds be ever in your favor!\n\nEdit: I should have titled it \u201cone way \u201cThanks everyone for the comments! After hearing from some of you about the value of debt in a recession I wanted to say I understand where your coming from as Apgar as paying off your mortgage with a less valued dollar is like paying less money for your original loan. It makes sense! The position I was coming from is specific calls related to owning something totally. Whether I lose my Job or have a huge pay decrease The house would still be mine with nothing more to pay. I\u2019m tired of running on the hamster wheel where The bank owns me and I pay them. So I closing I stand by my original post and respect the opinions of everyone. There are many ways to do something the right way, some more efficient than others, but the relativity lies in different and diverse cogs that make up each persons individual variables.",

This does not include Failure to Delivers (FTD) \u2014 otherwise known as \u201cNaked Shorts.\u201d\n\nFrom Fintel, we can see that from the May data that there were over 1MM shares that \u201cFailed to Deliver\u201d on any given day.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/oran9rvjyg571.png?width=1422&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=19041cb865d8f59e891050daef534311c02690cf\n\n \n\nIf we look at the borrow rate for the stock, it is extremely high. In fact, it\u2019s been (at times) the second highest in the market. \n\nThis makes sense because there are almost no shares left to short (or borrow), which results in a very high interest rate to borrow shares to short. Today it topped 270% borrow rate. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/co42erslyg571.png?width=512&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2e898cb8ddf16cfdcdeeaf95e977858e27462376\n\n It ranked #2 on Fintels \u201chighest borrow rate\u201d list today!  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hft2ez5nyg571.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=55e728df6a3700793c3500dc1aac00e1eed36c5d\n\n The borrow rate on ETRADE is 120% and listed as hard to borrow. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5oet5c8qyg571.png?width=1435&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f509ec43eca277fb8bcf69f6f07643f2bc621a41\n\n On Iborrowdesk, it\u2019s the same story:  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2ctdh0bryg571.png?width=763&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=58a311b851005695d39c0d20a3eeade442c46775\n\n When we look at the daily trading data (source: Fintel), we can see something doesn't add up: **a stock with almost no shares to short and a very high borrow rate\u2026. yet, the table below shows an average of 60-70% of the daily volume is being sold short.  EVERY DAY.** \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8abtdw1tyg571.png?width=666&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fd2fb4cd6f4a2ebfad55cd0ef25f5f4f0915a786\n\n \n\nHow on Earth is someone shorting millions of shares per day? Where are they finding these shares when three separate brokers have no shares available to short? \n\n**Section 2: Failure to Deliver and Suspicious Options Activity**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/56r7k0juyg571.png?width=1358&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=820e3de51e21ce9d0dd3feab11084929374a1bb8\n\n It looks like they have been shorting this stock for months. Let\u2019s see who is disclosing some (not all) of their short positions:  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dft3upnvyg571.png?width=1424&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=11a98750efcb5af5c7e9bf9f4258f48c6f2b298a\n\nQuestions: How are they still shorting with such a high borrow rate? How many shares are actually naked short and waiting for the unlock of more shares?  Is this from the PIPE which would cause selling pressure? It seems like someone is waiting for these shares to unlock so they can cover. \n\nThe answer is in the options flow: \n\nThe chart below is for the $10.00 June 18 (in the money) call options. Notice something? 6,000 Contracts purchased every day. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dp2hro7xyg571.png?width=512&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=020a34d9f0d07f01729cb4428b8f9338173f91d5\n\n And this chart is for the $15.00 June 18 calls:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3osoqdmyyg571.png?width=702&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2003e1ee5e6ddab55815387d1f997f96ed4b4e6a\n\n **Added together (both June strikes)** someone is buying (or shorting) 14,000 contracts PER DAY, and the open interest is reset each day, which means they are being exercised. \n\nFor proof of the instant exercising of the calls, here are some calls bought on June 11th, showing 6.81k calls purchased, and the corresponding volume of 681k at the exact same date and time. (You can see the small volume bar at the bottom of the arrow on this minute candle chart) \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4bw1gc80zg571.png?width=1444&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ca20e4af362f4152e17eb4e7d4394557751e243b\n\n[share volume corresponds perfectly with the options contract volume](https://preview.redd.it/g0felo73zg571.png?width=958&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a20176ef26c50d93d3c6d6babb435cac1d1b7641)\n\n \n\n**Chapter 3: The Buy-Write Delay Strategy**\n\nThis \u201cBuy-Write\u201d Strategy is discussed in an SEC article on detecting illegal options trading strategies to reset close-out obligations:\n\n[Strengthening Practices for Preventing and Detecting Illegal Options Trading Used to Reset Reg SHO Close-out Obligations (sec.gov)](https://www.sec.gov/about/offices/ocie/options-trading-risk-alert.pdf)\n\nThis can be a complex process that we can go into in another post, but the gist of this is that when the fund shorting the stock needs to make a delivery on a hard to borrow security (like $ARVL), they give the appearance of satisfying the brokers-dealer\u2019s close-out requirement \u2014 all the while MAINTAINING their short position) by engaging in these \u201creset transactions!\u201d \n\nProof of the nefarious activity can be found by running through the checklist of SEC observations for these strategies and noting all which apply to ARVL (highlighted below)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/svuhhm08zg571.png?width=653&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5297b9a988a9bcb6a0ee00a38e8827378a8319df\n\nThe implications of this don\u2019t lead to easy conclusions, but it looks like the shorts are going all out in their attempts to maintain their positions. Likely, there are two or more funds engaging in this strategy, which is outlined in these highlighted sentences below:\n\n![img](d9zb1sv9zg571 \"\n\")\n\nWe can perform a rough calculation of how much the shorting fund will pay to buy time by using the call option and share price at the time of purchase and exercise.\n\n**Reverse Engineering** \n\n* June 18th $10 call contract @ 9.30$ per contract\n* Share price = $19.34\n* Quantity 10,000 contracts\n\nTherefore they are paying a $0.04 premium on the stock. \n\nWe can reverse engineer the equivalent borrow rate : $0.04 / $19.34 x 100% x 365 = 76% equivalent yearly  interest (or borrow rate)  they are paying on every transaction with the calls contracts.\n\nAs per the SEC document noted above, it seems like they are using the strategy called  \u201cThe Second Transaction to \u201cReset the Clock\u201d\n\nParty A ( with large short interest)\n\nBalance -1,000,000 shares short\n\nParty B\n\nShorts 10,000 options contracts \n\nParty A buys and exercises contracts\n\nBalance 0 shares\n\nParty B\n\nBalance -1,000,000 shares\n\nParty A\n\nShort sells 1,000,000 shares\n\nBalance -1,000,000 shares\n\nParty B \n\nBuys 1,000,000 shares from party A\n\nBalance 0\n\nBoth parties have the same amount of shares they started with. Party A benefits from buying time and paying a reduced borrow rate \n\nThis explains why there is such high short interest every day. The party with the large short position is refusing to cover their position because they are waiting for the shares to unlock, which would create downward selling pressure. \n\n \n\n**Section 4: Conclusion**\n\n\u2611 Massive borrow rate (2nd largest) indicating a decrease in supply or vigorous short sale activity (or both)\n\n\u2611 Huge daily short volume over the past month\n\n\u2611 Failure to delivers (FTDs) caused by low float and massive short selling\n\n\u2611 Questionable buy-write activity indicating massive stuck short positions\n\n\u2611 Super tight float allowing for a large pump\n\n\u2611 Low IV allowing for call-option gamma squeeze further trapping the shorts\n\nTL;DR - short interest on $ARVL is massive, and interested parties seem to be betting on a PIPE unlock soon. They are paying over 100% for their borrow fee and could be forced to cover if the stock gains upward momentum. They appear to be manipulating the price and buying time through options contracts. \n\nHow much time they have is the salient question. Feel free to weigh in. \n\n*Disclaimer:*  *this is all public available data and we have no idea If we are deciphering it correctly*",

        "selftext": "People underestimate Blackberry's QNX operating system as a secure RTOS (Real Time Operating System) based off of microkernel architecture. \ud83d\ude80\n\nFor those who don't know how a RTOS microkernel operates let's explain with minor detail. QNX is one of the most adopted embedded OS's in the world installed in defense systems, power plants and municipal grids, robotics, rockets, rail and 120 million vehicles and rising.\ud83d\ude80\n\nThe reason for it's adoption is because of the way a QNX Neutrino RTOS operates compared to what we consider typical everyday operating systems. Most operating systems including IOS, Windows, Linux(Android) and MacOS to name the most apparent run on monolithic designs or hybrid kernels.\ud83d\ude80 \n\nA true microkernel architecture like QNX Neutrino RTOS has full memory protection which is built in meaning that any component can fail and be restarted without corrupting the microkernel or other components in the system. If failure does occur, QNX has the ability to rectify the problem without affecting any other part of the system through process monitoring and recovery components. This feature and ability equals extreme reliability and security and being a microkernel the OS is also modular.\ud83d\ude80\n\nSo what is the big deal your probably asking, Apple, ABC, and Microsoft might enter the space? Not exactly, in fact there has been work in this space from all three companies. Apple opened a facility across from QNX in Kanata and hired the ex creator of the OS Dan Dodge in 2016 to work with Mansfield on the autonomous car project called project Titan. The need for a secure and stable software is where Dodge and his decades of experience from QNX come into play.\ud83d\ude80\n\nThe need for a software system as reliable and secure as QNX should be a big flag to the shear potential of QNX. It is clearly a threat and tough competition for even the biggest software companies. Not only this but project Titan continues to be illusive revealing possible setbacks and interference in trying to compete but also Apple lost several top managers from it's Apple Car project causing a potential setback to the launch revealing some attrition in the project.\ud83d\ude80\n\nQNX version (7.1) is years ahead and analysts predict the next competitor is still 5 years away from anything even remotely close.  QNX hypervisor 2.0 is 61508 SIL 3 certified and\u00a0has been recognized as ISO 26262 ASIL D compliant making it the world's first ASIL D safety-certified commercial hypervisor. \ud83d\ude80\n\nAs other's race to catch up BlackBerry has been filing patents on it's system.\ud83d\ude80\n\nThe QNX Hypervisor utilizes patented and patent-pending technologies that simplifies how elements are shared on the system. Multiple OS's can use 1 display controller to render content onto multiple displays, aka digital instrument cluster and infotainment.\ud83d\ude80",

        "selftext": "Dear Apes, I'm writing to you today to tell you a few things. I see many people not understanding and wanting to. A lot of people spreading misinformation, etc. I want to clear the air and inform you crayon eaters.\n\nWelcome to WSB (Wall Street Bets) Reddit, the home of the Apes. We are collectively we are considered one of the largest hedge funds in the world. There are many baby crayon eating apes whom are eager to eat some tasty banana's. Many of you question how any of us make money, so please feel free to ask questions in the comments as I will be answering as many as possible, although keep in mind I am not a financial advisor, I simply love the stonks.\n\nThe main topic and example today is $CLOV. You've most likely been hearing a lot about it. Let me explain the hype behind our four leaf clover and what you need to expect and do to make some crispy chicken tendies (currency).\n\n$CLOV is a very shorted stock currently with an approximate short float of 50% (please correct me if I'm wrong). A short in simple terms is when someone bets on the stonk going down in value. They 'borrow' the stonk at $50, and give it back to the lender at the lower price of $20. Profiting $30. But here's the catch. If they 'borrow' the stonk at $50 and it going up to $100, they must buy the stonk at $100. Which will raise the price of the stonk. Make sense?\n\nGood. Now, what causes the short squeeze? Truth is, many factors. WSB as a whole usually rallys around certain (meme) stonks that are either undervalued and/or highly shorted. Once we do it causes a jump in price. The shorts wet themselves from a gamma squeeze (high volume trading from Apes dumping all tendies into a stonk). This causes them to eventually have to pay back their shorts at a ridiculous price and I'm turn causes the stock to go up. \n\nWhat is the perfect recipe? Well, because it's so highly shorted and we have a ton of Apes hoping on the stonk going to the moon, they've bet on it. Opening many contracts on the four leaf clover. Once the price reaches above a certain value, many will 'exercise' their contracts (which means actually purchase their shares at the 'strike' price they set it to. Causing a huge influx of shares to be taken at once. \n\nIs it too late to purchase $CLOV? No, it's not. Is it going to go up? It depends on us. If you hold, the shorts will need to pay those banana's back to us at the higher price. Did you get it too late? If you purchased below $25 so far, you will profit if you hold. $CLOV isnt as much of a meme stonk as you think. They have great fundamentals and actually is a great business. So everyone that has purchased, don't worry. You'll profit if you hold. What you're seeing now is only a gamma squeeze caused by us, and everything is going to plan. \n\nWhat will the price hit? When do I sell? Good question, no one ever knows. But I can tell you personally, this will hit $50 no problem if we just work together.

        "selftext": "**Alright, before half of you get triggered about \"oH nO tHis Is A pUmp &amp; dUmP\", please take the time to actually read this. I spent a lot of time finding this information and I do think $WOOF is a good value play that is being HEAVILY shorted.  Also I'm not the other guy who posted about $WOOF earlier.**\n\n**So ,with that,**\n\n**From the degenerate behind** [**$TX - Latin America's Balls of Steel**](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nx74mo/tx_dd_ternium_it_up_latin_americas_balls_of_steel/)**, I introduce to you The $WOOF of Wallstreet - A Doggystyle DD.**\n\n# What is WOOF (PetCo)?\n\n[This is their building, its nice I guess.](https://preview.redd.it/wozz1n4269571.png?width=485&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b88457d937c3f0e0f705601b3299ca1216c001eb)\n\nSo now that half of America got all sad and pouty during COVID and bought themselves pandemic pets to cure that hole that permanently exists, pet goods are becoming more and more profitable. On top of this, most of you tards probably don\u2019t realize that just like people who have yearly physicals, your pets need to go to the vet. This is where the new Petco comes in.\n\nPetco defines itself as a \u201chealth and wellness company focused on improving the lives of pets, pet parents, and Petco partners\u201d. They sell various products including pet food, toys, health products, and live animals. Most importantly, they have started rapid expansion into veterinary services through their **Thrive &amp; Vital Care** brand**s**. I will bring this up later in the DD and highlight why it is extremely important as a case against popular competitor Chewy.\n\nPetco is also one of the only stores that actually takes a \u201cThink Adoption First\u201d philosophy. They have never sold dogs or cats and ended the sale of birds several years back. This adoption approach helps promote a more ethical way of bringing companions into people\u2019s lives.\n\n# Vets, Expansions, &amp; More:\n\nAlright, so you\u2019re probably wondering, why the fuck would I want to go into Petco when Chewy is already booming and has a unhealthy cult like following. Several reasons, all of which will make your wife's boyfriend let you watch them go doggystyle.\n\nPandemic pet business exploded, reaching a peak high near the end of 2020 in terms of ownership. \u2018Muricans were buying dogs, cats, hamsters, sex dolls, pocket pussies, and basically anything that could temporarily cure loneliness. In 2020, the pet industry posted a record $103.6 billion in sales, per the American Pet Products Association. However, this boom is not going aways anytime soon. Your pet isn\u2019t just going to disappear once you\u2019re back in the office, and no way in hell is Petco taking back that dog you just dressed up for fAmIlY pHoTos.\n\n[Recent discounts and shipment options](https://preview.redd.it/yngwxqxq69571.png?width=901&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=83c73b477d92c6d7e8f5c4e0dfde8fc00c111732)\n\nThis means Petco is about to make **BANK** over the next two to three years solely on food and care supplies. By having physical stores, Petco is able to fulfill **83%** of its online orders through both store-shipment and curbside pickup. This has allowed for same day delivery as well, with many customers reporting deliveries within 3-4 hours.\n\nMany pet owners also prefer getting fresh food, which is much more expensive for Chewy to ship from distribution centers. Petco gets to avoid extra packaging and costs by shipping directly from local stores that keep products en bulk.\n\nTheir CEO, Ron Coughlin, states \u201cGiving a personal example, when my order of Just Food for Dogs, fish and sweet potatoes comes from one of our Pet Care Centers two miles from my house, it comes in a simple bag versus a pack box with cardboard with dry ice with foam packaging that online pure-play competitors use for comparable products,\u201d said Mr. Coughlin. \u201cClearly, we have an advantage here.\u201d\n\nOn top of training and grooming services in stores, Petco is overwhelmed by the demand for these services as their CEO reports 11 million new pet adoptions in the past year. In general, pets are considered a **recession-proof** industry since they need to be fed and kept healthy regardless of economic conditions (to some extent).\n\n[ \\\\\"Hahaha we're about to take away your balls dude\\\\\" \\~ Petco Vet Center ](https://preview.redd.it/r7dqe27379571.png?width=577&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4701682e5849ee599ad3466a001e1c4c1fac4d89)\n\n**Vet Business:** The Petco brand Vital Care is their main veterinary business and added nearly **70,000** new members since its launch in October, with each of these customers spending **2.5x more than the average customer.** Overall, these services grew **63% year over year** with another 40% increase over the next year. All of these signs point towards a strengthening business model that competes in a space, other companies like PetSmart and Chewy have not expanded into.\n\n**Petco\u2019s Vital Care** offers an annual plan that includes vet services and grooming discounts, for $19/m. This comes out to about $228 a year. On average, appointments, pet insurance, and other emergencies raise traditional vet costs into the thousands. Petco\u2019s plans show that even as a poor, you can continue to live with your 12 cats without going broke. **They also just opened their 100th in-store veterinary hospital with no signs of stopping expansion.**\n\nThere have also been reports of some PetCo stores being **renovated** due the the company\u2019s rebranding as a pet health and wellness store. **The reason I find this very bullish is that only a company expecting future growth and having the funds to do so would invest in large renovation projects.**\n\n**Essentially, Petco has transformed itself to become a one stop shop for pet supplies, grooming, training, and vet health services, all while providing a digital platform to access these services. This business model beats nearly every other pet company out there right now.**\n\nThis serves **extremely well for both short and long term investors** looking for a possible run-up in the next few weeks and those seeking to capture large gains across several months.\n\n# The S.H.A.R.T Play:\n\n[Self Explanatory](https://preview.redd.it/cvjizmj679571.png?width=738&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=76a63b0e33b4bf8ea6f659cba15ce15e0455cc86)\n\n**This is what S.H.A.R.T stands for:**\n\nS - Short Interest\n\nH - Hype\n\nA - Availability (Demand)\n\nR - Really Memeable\n\nT - Timing\n\n# Shart Interest:\n\n[SHART INTEREST @ 36&amp;#37; 6th Most Shorted Stock](https://preview.redd.it/se8qmn2u69571.jpg?width=828&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=41b575fb9e21966c8655e4688e2e57d6478bda53)\n\nSeveral different sources are reporting different shart interest numbers on $WOOF, ranging from 9% to 100%. Ideally, I want to go with the 100% shart rate, but I think it is around 36% since this is a fucking Bloomberg Terminal lol. The float is low as well at around 16M.\n\n**Therefore, shart interest is around 36% which is still significantly high.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Hype:**\n\nWe can see that $WOOF already gained traction once before and continues to do so. There are some reddit whales who have already bought into $WOOF this past week as well. IV is moderately high across the options chain, hovering between 60-80%, indicating that right now is still an okay time to buy in if this DD is convincing you of Petco's potential.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Availability:**\n\nWhen I say availability, it is meant to measure the demand of the goods and services provided by said company. In the case of Petco, I see demand sustaining throughout 2021 and into 2022, because as mentioned before, pets aren\u2019t going anywhere. If Petco is able to capitalize on this by continuing to bring better service features and different vet plans, it could target niche pet markets such as salon care as well for more wealthy clients. Currently, demand is severely outpacing the availability of their services, and as a result, I believe they will have very strong earnings again.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Really Memeable:**\n\nI think this one is self explanatory. Petco memed itself because\n\na) It IPOd right when GME gaped up everyone\u2019s mom\u2019s buttholes\n\nb) Its ticker is a fucking sound. It\u2019s not even a real word lol.\n\nWith WSB already having some knowledge of this ticker and the fundamentals indicating it is a good value play for the year, I have full confidence in this trade regardless of it being memed or not even more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Timing:**\n\nSomewhat covered in the previous points, but this is the perfect entry point. Looking at the price graph over the past 6 months, even after beating the estimated Q1 EPS of $0.09 by nearly 100% (Actual EPS of $0.17), the stock has continued to trade sideways for a majority of the year. You could have bought in February and made $0 to date. For this reason, I think the timing for the play is great. \n\n# Financials:\n\nAs mentioned earlier the predicted EPS for Q1 of 2021 was $0.09 while the actual EPS ended up being $0.17, a **89% beat**. Meanwhile, the stock tanked lower and has stayed bound between the $20 and $24 range for 5 months.\n\nWithin this quarter alone, Petco got an additional **1.2 million customers and 28% increase in YoY sales.** Through DoorDash, they are able to increase expected revenue up to **$5.58B** by continuously providing same day shipping. (I find this partnership a bit sketchy just because of how overvalued and trash DoorDash is).\n\nRegarding its competitor $CHEWY, we can see that it leads with a forward P/E of nearly 245 while Petco is \u201conly\u201d at 29. Although this is relatively high, within its sector, Petco is trading at a massive discount. Petco is able to target those who want an in-store experience or simply cheaper services, but also caters to the online crowd in an easy to manage fashion. The same cannot be said for Chewy. Chewy did expand into telehealth services but so far, these do not replace a traditional vet appointment.\n\nIn terms of debt, $WOOF just payed off nearly **$1.7B of debt, and is left with just $1.8B**, all due to the IPO funds they secured. With a much more positive balance sheet, I find this to be another reason that right now is a the right time to enter Petco.\n\n# Given all of this data, future growth, and the expansion of Petco as much more than a pet supply store, it makes zero sense for this stock to have a 36% short interest rate or trade sideways for so long.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Analyst ANALysis:\n\nAs of last week, Citi brought back a **Buy rating** on $WOOF with a price target of $31, indicating **upside of nearly 30%** from its current price point of $23.80. Bank of America jumped on this as well (lol), and is giving it a new Buy rating with **increased EBITDA forecasts through 2023.**\n\nOn Nasdaq\u2019s overview, based on 3 analysts, **$WOOF is a strong buy with a PT of $29.40. Although ANALysts can be quite wrong, the signs of it being a strong buy are evident across many firms, making this seem like an even better play.**\n\n# \ufe0f\u200d\ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b Case:\n\nI think the main issues Petco faces is its customer service issues. From accounts I\u2019ve read on grooming and vet experiences, people either have an extremely good appointment or a very bad one. Petco needs to fix this by bringing consistency in training across their stores before expanding too much and getting overwhelmed by growth without accounting for quality.\n\nI also think that with the lockup period expiring around Mid-July (180 days after Jan 14th), there could be a small dip if the price runs up in the next few weeks.\n\nOne final thing I thought of is if Chewy manages to utilize a healthcare company\u2019s coaching and vet networks to tie into its telehealth services. This is the biggest competitive move they could make as they would only be paying for a network plan as a single client and simply offset the costs across all of their customers. Additionally, many of the networks provided by big names like United Healthcare are multinational and include thousands of providers. This would allow Chewy to give cheaper vet access to all of its customers in almost any location, unlike Petco which is still in the expansion process in its limited stores.\n\n# Conclusion / TL;DR:\n\nDespite the \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b case above, **I strongly believe that $WOOF is a very undervalued company with strong financials that get better each day. Combining the 36% shart interest, lower share value, and high PTs, I am convinced that $WOOF is a great play. If you want your wife to let you do it doggystyle, then $WOOF is the perfect play to make money and get turnt.**\n\n**I am in already for 5 contracts of 9/17 30Cs and will continue to add to my position this week. I may also play FDs in case this gains traction this week.**\n\nPlease make trades responsibly and with your own understanding of the stock as I\u2019m not responsible for you being retarded or complaining that this is P&amp;D!",

Experts are already stating that this salad is the salad of the summer. See attached citation for review.  ([https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/wendys-brings-back-seasonal-summer-strawberry-chicken-salad-301306465.html](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/wendys-brings-back-seasonal-summer-strawberry-chicken-salad-301306465.html))\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Second,** Wendys social media profile is no stranger to memes. Everyone has seen the \"Roast Me\" thing that Wendys has been doing. Well this will only increase with fellow autists supporting it. Academics have called this term \"metapragmatic roasting\" and its incredibly effective with the younger generation. Here is a chart demonstrating the breakdown of their tweets. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https:\\/\\/www.sciencedirect.com\\/science\\/article\\/pii\\/S0378216620301120#fig3](https://preview.redd.it/loppdub5mu371.png?width=357&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d8c5b8485a2ab060d6c7f2a8585230fbd11dd707)\n\nHere is another article from business daily demonstrating the effectiveness of Wendys perceived social media presence. [https://journal.businesstoday.org/bt-online/2018/wendys-twitter-presence-the-art-of-creating-beef-over-beef](https://journal.businesstoday.org/bt-online/2018/wendys-twitter-presence-the-art-of-creating-beef-over-beef)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Third**, Both Gamestop and Wendys have been sharing in this Social Media \"Beef\" or \"Metapragmatic Roasting\" of each other. Their Twitter profiles are actively following each other and going off each others posts. See the below image for an example. ([https://twitter.com/gamestop/status/1224739308013309952?lang=en](https://twitter.com/gamestop/status/1224739308013309952?lang=en))\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Coincidence? ](https://preview.redd.it/zug6vms5nu371.png?width=607&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2144efe81af5d11abfd7702386aa5301defef822)\n\n**Forth, well this one is obvious but Wendys Chicken Tendies. Literally the perfect stock for this sub.** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo lets talk technical. Supposedly $WEN (Wendy's) has a low public float of around 17 million shares. It has between a 4-10$ float which will increase as the stock increases because fast food retail is a relatively predictable stock (Same reason why Utility Companies will get shorted to shit when they rise look at $NEE earlier this year).  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWith an average volume of around 1 Million per day there is a huge amount of Alpha to be had in investing in Wendys. Right now the Implied Volatility on options is tiny (29-34%) which means that you can get a position for pennies on the dollar. Further, buying shares is small as well as its currently not a volatile company. Either way its a good investment because of the Salad. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIm in at $22.97 and calls expiring on January of next year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is not financial advice, I am not a financial advisor. I just really like the stock, and Wendys.",

That being said, I really hope some of you take the time to read this and potential save yourselves money and stress. \n\nIf you believe in these stocks; GME, AMC, BB, etc... you should be buying the stock itself and not options contracts. The Implied Volatility is at absurd levels, and if you don\u2019t know what that is, then you shouldn\u2019t be buying options contracts without looking it up. Because IV is so high, it makes it much much harder to profit off of buying options contracts because they become way overpriced.

        "selftext": "Inside of SpaceX, most investors rest their hat on the value of Starlink, which will provide FIXED-POINT broadband to customers, albeit at very high costs and with unclear quality.\n\nJust like Facebook found out after it's IPO, the real market is and always will be in MOBILE.  Starlink cannot translate to mobile unless you intend to haul a trailer behind you with a satellite dish.\n\n$ASTS AST Spacemobile has re-imagined what's possible after the significant cost disruption in satellite launch, which has allowed it to marry two key innovations to provide satellite connectivity to A REGULAR MOBILE DEVICE:\n\n1. Because launch costs are just a fraction of what they used to be, $ASTS is launching satellites 10x as large as those of traditional satellite phone satellites.  This allows the satellite to do the work, not the phone\n2. By innovating with software, $ASTS can make the satellite connection work with existing LTE networks by only working with the carriers' ground terminals to compensate for the Doppler effect; importantly, ASTS works with any normal phone without requiring any modifications\n\nHere is the overview:\n\n**PRODUCT:**\n\n\u2022 ASTS is building the first-of-a kind and **only** space-based cellular broadband network that is **direct-to-device**; a consumer\u2019s existing handset will work with ASTS\u2019s service in tandem with traditional terrestrial mobile service - ASTS also works with IoT enabled devices\n\n\u2022 The constellation utilizes low and mid-band frequencies shared with partners on a non-interference basis; ASTS does not use mobile satellite spectrum but instead delivers service over spectrum allocated for terrestrial mobile use\n\n\u2022 ASTS utilizes high throughput backhaul to terrestrial networks\n\n\u2022 The service will eliminate coverage gaps, is compatible with all phones, provides broadband data speeds, and is accessible via one-click on a user\u2019s device\n\n**MARKET:**\n\n\u2022 ASTS is targeting the large mobile 5G   market, specifically in markets where terrestrial infrastructure (e.g.   towers) is less developed\n\n\u2022 ASTS is a beneficiary of the following secular   trends: i) falling launch costs, ii) high smartphone penetration, iii)   broadband demand iv) 5G IoT proliferation\n\n\u2022 ASTS cites 3.3BN people who are covered but not connected to cellular broadband   and another 700MM people who are not covered by existing networks and not   connected\n\n\u2022 Key regional opportunities include India,   Africa, and Equatorial regions\n\n\u2022 The service is well-suited for low/medium   density sites as well as for emergency back-up during natural disasters\n\n**MANAGEMENT:**\n\n\u2022 CEO Avellan holds 18 patents and was the founder of Emerging Markets Communications (sold for $550MM in 2016)\n\n\u2022 The deep executive ranks include executives from Orbital ATK,   Globecomm, NASA, and Maxar \u2022 The team has 161 scientists and engineers, 34 of whom are PhDs\n\n**COMPETITION:**\n\n\u2022 ASTS competes with high-cost legacy   providers, including Iridium \u2022 Legacy satellite providers require unique  handsets for users to connect\n\n\u2022 ASTS also competes with the build-out of   standard terrestrial 5G mobile equipment \u2022 Competitor Lynk advertises a   similar product but appears significantly behind both with respect to   commercial, financial and technical milestones\n\n**OTHER:**   Investors include Vodafone, Rakuten, American Tower, and Samsung; all of whom recently invested in the Company's latest financing\n\n**TIMELINE:**\n\n\u2022 April 2019 \u2013 BW 1 was launched, validating system architecture \u2022 2H   2021E will launch BW3 \u2022 2H 2022E/1H 2023E first commercial launches   of 20 satellites for Equatorial coverage, with 110 satellites by YE 2023 and   168 satellites by YE 2024\n\n**ANALYSIS:**\n\n\u2022 ASTS is an exciting event-driven story  stock with open-ended upside that is cemented in reality by proven   entrepreneurs, significant industry backing, and *bone fide* strategic agreements in place that address key commercial aspects of the business\n\n\u2022 Management funded the seed capital for the business, highlighting their confidence and \u2018skin in the game\u2019\n\n\u2022 Targeting mobile 5G is a \u2018**big idea**\u2019 that augments that excitement generated by fixed-broadband players  such as Starlink while addressing the cost accessibility issues that are   likely to be present in developing markets\n\n\u2022 The stock benefits from a dynamic where it cannot be disproven, leaving investors free to speculate and  discount key assumptions, including service penetration among partner carriers and ARPU\n\n\u2022 The investment set-up is favorable since a   high capital intensity space venture is poorly suited for private markets,  yet requires the capital available in the SPAC market \u2013 the set-up is not a   \u2018foist\u2019 by private market investors onto unsuspecting retail investors but   instead a legitimate capital raising exercise that harnessed the SPAC market   instead of exploiting it\n\n\u2022 With 1-year lock-ups on existing investors and PIPE investors, there will be limited free float on account of the small   trust size ($232MM) coupled with the statement of confidence from pre-deal   and PIPE investors that rolled over in what amounted to a \u201cpublic Series C\u201d   financing\n\n\u2022 Given future CAPEX, Wall Street banks will   see a large future banking opportunity and likely initiate favorable coverage on the Company\n\n**RISKS:**\n\n\u2022 While the *BlueWalker* satellite provided proof-of-concept, there are questions around whether ASTS will work at scale when the constellation is deployed\n\n\u2022 Users might experience significant battery drain on their devices when using the service, reducing appeal for full tower placement\n\n\u2022 Realized user penetration and ARPU remain   uncertain as well as the ability to raise future capital for full system deployment at prices that avoid excessive dilution\n\n\u2022 ASTS will depend on capital markets to fully fund its growth and is   susceptible to potential funding risk\n\n**INVESTMENT CHECKLIST:**\n\n***BUSINESS MODEL***:  \u2022 ASTS will receive a 50/50 revenue split   with its carrier partners including Vodafone and AT\\&amp;T; given its large,   fixed cost base, the Company expects to generate 90% asset-level EBITDA   margins that provide significant operating leverage and cash flow\n\n***GO-TO-MARKET***:  \u2022 In-place binding agreements with carriers provide   ASTS with access to &gt;1.3BN existing customers without having to   independently market to or acquire customers (or directly bear the cost of   churn) \u2022 Phase 1 will target key Equatorial regions   and cover 1.6BN people; subsequent phases expand into Europe and N. America \u2013   the total system will require 168 satellites by 2024\n\n***DEFENSIBILITY***:  \u2022 ASTS has 750+ patents as well as a   first-mover advantage \u2022 Commercial progress reinforces the   Company\u2019s technical lead in the market\n\n***CAPITAL***:  \u2022 ASTS is capital intensive and subject to   capital availability to complete its full system \u2022 Once the constellation is complete, the Company benefits from extreme   operating leverage and should have extremely high cash flow conversation\n\n***TRACTION***:  \u2022 ASTS appears to have extraordinary   commercial partnership traction, however, it is yet unclear what end-user   uptake the usage will be \u2022 Technical traction was \u2018proved\u2019 by the   April 2019 launch of the *Bluewalker 1* test satellite\n\n***FINANCIALS***:  With a market cap of \\~$1.8bn, the company is expected to generate &gt;$1bn of EBITDA by 2024 based on 168 satellites launched, 27MM total subscribers, with an ARPU of $2.50 per user\n\n**TECHNOLOGY DETAILS**\n\n***OVERVIEW***: AST &amp; Science (\u201cASTS\u201d) has designed a large aperture satellite system to provide \u2018direct-to-device\u2019 service to normal phones\n\n***BOOMBOX IN SPACE***: ASTS\u2019 satellites are \\~10x bigger than the norm because they are essentially cell-phone towers in space. With a 900-square meter array, the system is a large **\u201cloud\u201d** system that can connect with a regular mobile phone. Traditional satellite phones \u201clisten hard\u201d whereas ASTS simply produces a loud signal to connect to regular mobile phones\n\n***SOFTWARE***\\*\\*:\\*\\* ASTS\u2019 system does not require a special chipset on the phone because of its proprietary back-end software system that allows for interconnection to existing terrestrial spectrum and telecom networks. The \u201cmagic\u201d of the technology is the back-end software that allows the system to utilize terrestrial spectrum, seamlessly interconnect over existing networks, and talk directly to an LTE system; ASTS is 6G forward compatible\n\n***BACKHAUL***: Once the signal is collected from a handset, ASTS sends the data back on B-Band satellite spectrum to a ground gateway system. The phone-satellite connection is native to the carrier\u2019s terrestrial spectrum\n\n***CAPACITY***:   Each satellite can handle 1.2MM GB per month; extra capacity can be added by directing additional satellites at an area\n\n***WHAT DO WE KNOW:***  What has ASTS done to prove its system?\n\no *Bluewalker1* proved the RF could close (e.g. the power was sufficient to connect a normal phone) and that an LTE connection was achievable utilizing ASTS\u2019 \u2018magic\u2019 software; ASTS launched a handset into space with the satellite on the ground to cost-effectively check an important element of technical diligence. *Bluewalker1* allowed for end-to-end connectivity testing, which has been reviewed over the last 1.5 years\n\no *Bluewalker3* (2H 2021 launch) will be a scaled version of the system, which will de-risk components and demonstrate the full technology. BW3 will allow for software debugging to tune the full system\n\n***ENABLEMENT***:  The fundamentals of closing an RF connection are known technology. Previously, the launch costs were prohibitive, but the technology was otherwise available for ASTS\u2019 system\n\n***RISKS***:  Most of the risks are timing risks. For instance, *Bluewalker3* could spur the need to tune microns, which could delay the system deployment by months. The troubleshooting required will be the beam forming in patterns to maintain a connection while managing handoffs\n\nA launch vehicle delay could delay the testing by 60 to 90 days\n\n***BENT PIPE***: The satellite itself is not complex \u2013 it is bent pipe in the sky; most of the design relates to distributing power. The satellite itself is not involved with processing or routing\n\n**DISCLOSURE**:  I own 500,401 shares of common.  Yes, this is a huge position.  You only live once...invest carefully and with great vision",

        "selftext": "There are many stocks being discussed right now and I thought I would share some of my observations of the trends of these stocks. Trends are obviously not always reliable, but they do give us some idea as to what is happening and what may happen in the near future. Timing is key to everything. This is not to say these are bad stocks. All stocks have ups and downs.  \n\nThis is not professional or financial advice. These are just my personal observations. \n\n#**Some technical terminology:**\n\n**Bullish** = share prices rising\n\n**Bearish** = share prices falling\n\n**1. Exponential moving average (EMA)**\n\n*What is what in the chart of share prices*:\n\n* **Purple** line is EMA over past 20 blocks (EMA 20) - this shows a tighter trend since it averages over a shorter amount of time\n* **Light blue** line is EMA over past 50 blocks (EMA 50)\n* **Green line** is EMA over past 200 blocks (EMA 200) - this shows a more general trend since it averages over a longer amount of time\n\n*Significance*:\n\n* **Purple (EMA 20)** above **blue (EMA 50)** which is above **green (EMA 200)** = bullish\n* stock crossing or bouncing off an EMA line in UPwards direction = bullish\n* stock crossing or bouncing off an EMA line in DOWNwards direction = bearish\n* EMA lines can be good references for support and resistance. \n\n\n**2. Trading volume**\n\nThese are the vertical bars lined up below the stock chart\n\n* taller bar = higher trading volume (this is good for generating momentum)\n\n\n**3. Relative Strength Index (RSI)**\n\nThis is the middle graph consisting below the main chart consisting of a blue squiggly line. It signifies price momentum. \n\nBasically:\n\n* closer to the top bar = stock is more overbought\n* closer to the bottom bar = stock is more oversold\n\n**4. Moving average convergence divergence (MACD)**\nThis is the bottom most graph consisting of green bars, red bars, and 2 interweaving lines of blue and orange. This graph also signifies momentum. The two interweaving lines show the relationship between two moving averages of a share price\n\nBasically:\n\n* orange line ABOVE the blue line = bullish momentum\n* orange line UNDER the blue line = bearish momentum\n\n\n#**Now applying these concepts to the following stocks:**\n\n\n#**SENS**\nIncreased 29.3% in past 5 days\n\nShort Volume Ratio: 27%\n\n[image](https://i.postimg.cc/85Rs2Tz3/Screen-Shot-2021-06-13-at-12-22-29-AM.png)\n\n1. The EMA lines on chart are aligned in *bullish* order (purple over blue over green)\n2. There is relatively *very high* trading volume\n3. RSI is not above the top bar indicating oversold, which is great given the dramatic rise over the past several days\n4. In the MACD, the orange line is above the blue line = **bullish**\n\nI drew a horizontal line at around 4.2. This has been a point of resistance a couple times in the past few days but the broke above it Friday and seems to have converted it into a point of support. This appears bullish.\n\n#**CLF** \nIncreased 23.9% in past 5 days\n\nShort Volume Ratio: 33%\n\n[image](https://i.postimg.cc/ZYLCjYgv/Screen-Shot-2021-06-13-at-12-23-54-AM.png)\n\n1. The EMA lines on chart are aligned in *bullish* order (purple over blue over green)\n2. There is relatively high trading volume = good for momentum\n3. There is momentum on the RSI towards selling but it is not above the top bar indicating being way oversold\n4. In the MACD, the orange line is over the blue line (*bullish*)\n\nI drew a horizontal golden line around 24.5 which was previously a point of resistance where the stock was rejected twice. On Friday, it looks like the stock had bullish momentum back to that line and may be able to consolidate and convert that line from resistance to support. \n\n#**Vinco ventures**\nIncreased 13.5% in past 5 days\n\nShort Volume Ratio: 23%\n\n[image](https://i.postimg.cc/zvq354Lf/Screen-Shot-2021-06-13-at-12-23-18-AM.png)\n\n1. The EMA lines on chart are aligned in bullish order (purple over blue over green)\n2. There is relatively high trading volume\n3. RSI is in the middle meaning not oversold, which is good given the recent uptrend\n4. In the MACD, the orange line is right on the blue line\n\nI drew a horizontal golden line around 4.7 which has been a point of resistance x2, then support, then resistance. It appears the stock just broke above the line which is bullish.\n\n#**CLNE**\nIncreased 4.0% in past 5 days\n\nShort Volume Ratio: 24%\n\n[image](https://i.postimg.cc/pLS980S0/Screen-Shot-2021-06-13-at-12-24-48-AM.png)\n\n1. It looks like the stock and purple EMA line (EMA 20) is crossing the green EMA line (EMA 200). This suggests bearish movement.\n2. Trading volume is less than previously in the week, seems to be about its normal amount before the hype started.\n3. RSI is closer to the lower bar, suggesting it may be somewhat undersold. \n4. In the MACD, the orange line and blue lines are overlapping, no upward or downward. \n\nI drew a horizontal line golden line around 11.1 which was initially a point of support and now appears to be a point of resistance. This is not convincingly bullish.\n\n#**CLOV**\nIncreased 58.8% in past 5 days\n\nShort Volume Ratio\t24%\n\n[image](https://i.postimg.cc/Gmt840X8/Screen-Shot-2021-06-13-at-12-25-02-AM.png)\n\n1. The stock and purple EMA line (20) are descending towards the green EMA line (EMA 200). This is hard to determine since it has not crossed, but does not suggest bullish movement. \n2. Trading volume is still relatively higher than normal\n3. RSI is in the middle, not oversold or undersold\n4. In the MACD, the orange line and blue lines are overlapping, hard to interpret. \n\nI drew a horizontal golden line around 16. This has been a line of support in the past few days, but now seems to be a point of resistance since the stock is now below it. This is not convincingly bullish.\n\n#**TLRY**\nIncreased 4.27% in past 5 days\n\nShort Volume Ratio: 29%\n\n[image](https://i.postimg.cc/FzGzKGcV/Screen-Shot-2021-06-13-at-12-25-17-AM.png)\n\n1. The stock and purple EMA line (20) are descending towards the green EMA line (EMA 200). This does not suggest bullish movement. Hard to determine since it is not crossed.\n2. Trading volume on Friday about the same as earlier in the week \n3. RSI is in the middle, not oversold or undersold\n4. In the MACD, the orange line is slightly above the blue lines suggesting some upwards momentum.\n\nIt appears a critical point is around 19.8 (defined by the green EMA 200 line!). This was previously support the previous day but has become a point of resistance on Friday. If it can break past this upwards, that could suggest upwards movement. \n\n#**WKHS**\nIncreased 12.27% in past 5 days\n\nShort volume: 22%\n\n[image](https://i.postimg.cc/qRVzDN4y/Screen-Shot-2021-06-13-at-12-25-22-AM.png)\n\n1. The purple EMA 20 line is below the light blue EMA 50 line, which is somewhat unfavorable. However, both are still above the green EMA 200 line.\n2. Trading volume is low\n3. RSI is in the middle, not oversold or undersold\n4. In the MACD, the orange line is slightly above the blue lines suggesting some upwards momentum.\n\nIt looks like there is currently support right at the purple EMA 20 line around 15.4. I drew a horizontal golden line at 16.2 which has been a point of resistance. If the stock can break above that, that would indicate bullish momentum to me. \n\n#**WEN**\nIncreased 5.09% in past 5 days\n\nShort Volume Ratio: 14%\n\n[image](https://i.postimg.cc/TPWKcVMT/Screen-Shot-2021-06-13-at-12-25-30-AM.png)\n\n1. The stock, the purple EMA 20 line, and the light blue EMA 50 line are all below the green EMA 200 line. Bearish.\n2. Trading volume is low\n3. RSI is in the middle, not oversold or undersold\n4. In the MACD, the orange line is slightly above the blue lines suggesting some upwards momentum.\n\nI drew a horizontal golden line at around 24.5. This is a point that the stock would need to break above.\n\n#**WISH**\nIncreased 30.38% in past 5 days\n\nShort Volume Ratio: 30%\n\n[image](https://i.postimg.cc/mZ3FqycD/Screen-Shot-2021-06-13-at-1-21-36-AM.png)\n\n1. The stock and purple EMA line (20) are descending towards the green EMA line (EMA 200). This does not suggest bullish movement. \n2. trading volume is okay\n3. RSI is in the middle, not oversold or undersold\n4. In the MACD, the orange line and blue lines are overlapping, momentum can go up or down. \n\n\ntl:dr: SENS, CLF, look promising. WKHS, WISH, CLOV, TLRY, CLNE, WEN do not look quite as promising. Again, these only give us a sense of the momentum and are very very short term. Momentum can change in one day. Come Monday, momentums can change. Again, I am not a professional or financial advisor. These are my personal observations.\n\n\n\n#**EDIT:** Added these per people's request\n#**FUBO**\n\nIncreased 7.04% in past 5 days\n\nShort Volume Ratio: 17%\n\n[image](https://i.postimg.cc/XJFhb7mw/Screen-Shot-2021-06-13-at-1-24-16-PM.png)\n\n1. The EMA lines on chart are aligned in *bullish* order (purple over blue over green)\n2. There is relatively high trading volume\n3. RSI is high, may come back down\n4. In the MACD, the orange line is above the blue line = **bullish**\n\nIt looks like it broke through its point of resistance -- suggests bullish\n\n#**UWMC**\n\nIncreased 15.35% in past 5 days\n\nShort Volume Ratio: 31%\n\n[image](https://i.postimg.cc/QNQPYCpD/Screen-Shot-2021-06-13-at-1-24-41-PM.png)\n\n1. The EMA lines on chart are aligned in *bullish* order (purple over blue over green)\n2. There is relatively high trading volume\n3. RSI is in middle\n4. In the MACD, the orange line is above the blue line = **bullish**\n\nIt looks like it broke through its point of resistance -- suggests bullish\n\n*edited: EMA = exponential moving average and RSI directionality, thanks folks. Probably should have proofread better. \n\nAnother comment: \nI know some don't think technicals apply to \"meme stocks\". However, I think they do still apply to \"meme stocks\" and give a better understanding of the current momentum and short term trends. I would not personally buy shares of a stock without considering its current momentum, past performance, and trends. We all know to \"buy the dip\", but these analyses can better inform us on what level of a dip would be a good buy. These analyses are how day traders decide their entry and exit points. I think a lot of traders would agree that technicals certainly apply to \"meme stocks\" and they use these to profit from the volatility and trade volume of these stocks. I agree that technical analysis is less applicable for the long term. Again, all stocks, even the best stocks, have their ups and downs. Again these are all very very short term predictions. Things can certainly change within a day. Come Monday, any of these can start to look more bullish or bearish. One thing you can do for your own confirmation is look back over the last few weeks of one of these stocks and look at the EMAs, RSI, and MACD and see how it correlates with the way the stock moves. Or you're welcome to look elsewhere on the internet because many people are doing technical analyses for these stocks. There are plenty on youtube. I'm certainly not a professional trader, but I like to be objective and I thought it would be nice to provide some objective data and analyses in this subreddit. A big reason GME was successful in January was because of the objective data and analyses put into it. I do love the hype and enthusiasm, but at the end of the day we should be making informed decisions for our money that are based on objective reasons--not just subjectively based on how many posts or comments mention a certain stock. Obviously feel free to disregard if you think technical analyses are irrelevant. And thanks for the corrections! Best of luck to all!",

        "selftext": "I've been reading up on Blackberry for a couple days now and found out some interesting things about the company that I don't think most people know. Obviously it is a lot to unpack but here are the important aspects of my findings thus far:\n\nBlackberry (ticker BB) provides intelligent security software and services to enterprises and governments around the world. **Blackberry secures more than 500 million endpoints including more than 175 million cars on the road today**. Changes to data privacy laws in the United States, Europe and other jurisdictions are compounding the challenges faced by organizations by increasing their responsibilities for securing their data as well as that of their customers. This is where Blackberry fills the void; there is no technology that has been exclusively or commercially adopted as the industry standard for many of the products and services offered by blackberry.\n\nBlackberry\u2019s go-to-market strategy focuses principally on generating revenue from enterprise software, services and licensing. The company intends to drive revenue growth and to achieve margins that are consistent with those of other enterprise software companies. \u00a0\n\n**Blackberry owns 38,000 worldwide patents**. It owns rights to an array of patented and patent pending technologies which include operating systems, networking infrastructure, acoustics, messaging, enterprise software, automotive subsystems, cybersecurity and wireless communications. Blackberry knows the value behind its patents and as such has a team of in-house patent attorneys ready to put pen to paper should any company infringe on its intellectual property. Blackberry believes that its patent portfolio continues to provide a competitive advantage in its core product areas as well as provide leverage in the development of future technologies.\n\nOther interesting facts:\n\nBlackberry QNX is a preferred supplier of embedded systems for companies building medical devices, train-control systems, industrial robots, hardware security modules, building automation systems, green energy solutions, and other mission critical applications. Blackberry QNX technology is embedded in over 175 million cars.\n\nBlackberry AtHoc has received FedRAMP certification and is the leading provider of network-centric, interactive crisis communication to the U.S. Department of Defense and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, among other governmental bodies. Blackberry AtHoc helps to protect more than 70% of U.S. government personnel.\n\n*Disclaimer: Not financial advice, please do your own DD.*",

        "selftext": "I'd really like to have a discussion here about GME. Everytime it seems I see anyone suggest it as a viable investment, it gets downvoted to oblivion. I hear some of the same arguments against its volatility but exposure to volatility is ok in a balanced portfolio, you dont need to be strictly ETF's. Know your limit, play within it, when it comes to speculative investments. Another argument is that its a dead business, that is far from the fact imo. It was on a downward path and would have gone the way of blockbuster but at this point, I see it as more of a Netflix. It is a debt free company, great new management team, proven to care about investors and care about the quality of service that customers receive. The fact it's been labelled a \"meme\" stock is insulting at this point, it's not a \"meme\" company with a bunch of \"meme\" employees. It's a company transitioning from its antiquated business model into a hopefully ecommerce powerhouse with at this point a global brand. The craze around this stock has made GME more of a household name then it has ever been. \nI'd love to have a good constructive discussion about it and see what exactly it is that makes some people so bearish on this and maybe we can take it a little more seriously then the label it's been given by CNBC and other MSM.",

I just wanted to to point out that the average analyst price target is  over $18 a share so I picked up a bunch under $10 and I will likely pick up more on Monday\n\nI've seen less talk about wish lately and more emphasis on uwmc. I have no problem with this as I've had a ton of shares in that turd for the last 8 months. However, I just wanted to point out to people that despite the current meme status of WISH, there is a lot of real potential and value in the stock. You can buy shares with the hopes of a short cover and still be glad you did long term regardless of what happens in the next few weeks\n\nSomeone please correct me if I'm wrong, but the general consensus seems to be that people like getting counterfeit Chinese garbage delivered slowly...I'm not usually their target demographic but after all the feedback from wsb members, there's actually a lot of crap I want to try ordering now...specifically fishing gear.\n\nAt this point I don't have that many shares and I bought low so I have no reason to pump the stock, so someone please let me know if there is something I'm not seeing.

Brief description of my last post - it was about the stock reaching its bottom at $6.80 and only going up from there (which was correct).\n\n**TL;DR - Currently, the highest number of options purchased have a strike price between $7-18 for every single month. The goal is to stay above $12 to create a snowball of options being executed, thereby causing a gamma squeeze - the higher the strike price, the higher the limit to execute and the hedges are worse off.**\n\n**What Is Clover Health?**\n\nClover Health is not just another insurance company. They have combined Medicare insurance services with new patient-centered technology aimed at facilitating the ease and effectiveness of diagnosis, treatment, and most importantly, prevention. This company should not be classified as a health insurance company, but a tech company. Their AI learning and database, Clover Assistant, make it easier for providers to eliminate unnecessary and repetitive lab testing, repetitive diagnoses, and it consolidates a patient\u2019s medical history into one platform. This not only saves the patient headaches from navigating our decentralized healthcare system, but it also saves both patients and insurance companies an enormous amount of money by avoiding duplicated efforts. \n\nCurrently, CLOV covers 66,300 customers across 8 states out of the 61,212,247 Medicare beneficiaries nationwide, which equates to .0011% of the beneficiary population. As you can tell, this number is extremely low, which makes sense since they are a brand new company. When they reach even 1% of the beneficiaries, this company\u2019s stock price would be $100+ based on fundamentals alone. But I expect these numbers to skyrocket as they gain more members and their AI learning database improves more and more.\n\n[CLOV Medicare Advantage Plan by &amp;#37; of growth compared to competitors \\(cloverhealth.com\\)](https://preview.redd.it/wuoalim07q371.png?width=3297&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b38cba4adeb4fcbbeae5d53ea93751964480113a)\n\nCLOV has huge long-term growth potential, so the risk to reward is extremely favorable towards getting into the squeeze. Let me explain why.\n\n**Positive Catalysts**\n\nAll the negative catalysts are out of the way and everything is priced in. Here are some positives I\u2019m keeping an eye on: \n\n* DOJ/SEC case dropping or settling (even if CLOV is found guilty of taking advantage of Medicare, it will still be positive because at max they\u2019ll pay a fine and that\u2019ll be over with). I highly doubt CLOV will be found guilty though because the Hindenburg claims are rather baseless and the DOJ were forced to inquire about this only because it\u2019s related to Medicare. \n* Biden\u2019s health care proposal reducing the Medicare qualifying age below 65 would create millions of new beneficiaries. The hype around the proposal alone will create a huge stock price increase in all healthcare-related stocks, so CLOV will definitely benefit.\n* CLOV is officially added to the Russell 3000, who will have to purchase a ton of CLOV shares.\n* PR of any new partnership, expanding to further states, and increasing current partnerships. They\u2019re growing rapidly as is, so news like this is bound to come out in the near future.\n\n**The Dark Clouds Surrounding CLOV**\n\n* As previously mentioned, the DOJ inquiry is still lingering and it\u2019s unclear when it will be settled. Although it\u2019s priced in, it is still something to watch out for.\n* Hindenturd\u2019s constant attacks despite insisting they don\u2019t have any positions. Why would Hindenburg attack Chamath Palihapitiya even though they aren\u2019t benefiting from it, according to themselves? This relates to the GME/AMC squeeze; Chamath was a big proponent of the push against the hedges. He was outspoken about the squeeze on several occasions and gave GME his validation, which in turn hurt Citadel and other hedges shorting GME immensely. Hindenburg\u2019s report was created to hurt all of Chamath\u2019s IPOs, especially CLOV. Basically, this is retaliation against Chamath for standing with the retail investors, and if I had to take a wild guess, Citadel has paid Hindenburg to write this baseless report. I\u2019ve added a link at the bottom of this post about the Hindenburg allegations and the counter from CLOV for those who were not aware of all the allegations. (PS - Despite all the negative press surrounding Chamath, his track record is stellar.)\n* The constant manipulation by short sellers to create negative incentive. For instance, the fake lawsuits by Lifshitz that are shady at best; if you go to their website, you\u2019ll find the phone number listed goes straight to voicemail. All their social media lead to Wix.com platforms instead of their own. And, **THEIR PHYSICAL LOCATION DOES NOT EXIST** as shown in Google Maps. Lots of red flags.\n\n**Let\u2019s get down to the nitty gritty - The Daddy of all Short Squeezes**\n\nCLOV is currently over 42.58% as of Friday, making it the highest shorted stock on paper (and it\u2019s unclear how many naked shorts there are, which could easily be 70-100%+; it\u2019s impossible to know since those shares are shorted illegally). THE SQUEEZE IS INEVITABLE, it\u2019s just a matter of how much more the short interest increases, which will correlate to a bigger squeeze. Furthermore, the borrowed interest on CLOV stock has more than doubled to 3.7%, meaning those who are shorting have to pay much higher interest on borrowing the stocks, and that number will only continue to increase as demand increases. Soon, they won\u2019t be able to borrow anymore stocks and will have to short it naked in order to suppress the price further, essentially digging a gargantuan hole in which to bury themselves.\n\n[CLOV S\\/I&amp;#37; as reported by Ortex](https://preview.redd.it/yem0laz57q371.jpg?width=1125&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d0602994d6bc0ddc1305c2737a8b1d70de3f7c58)\n\nNo need to fear the company dumping their shares or diluting it because the Class B shares are locked up - the directors aren\u2019t able to sell any shares until the stock price stays above $30 for 90 consecutive days or more. The company is $700 million cash flow positive and no debt, therefore there won\u2019t be any dilution.\n\nThe P/S ratio is considered a particularly good metric for evaluating young, potentially high growth companies or companies in cyclical industries that may not show an actual net profit every year. Let\u2019s talk about CLOV\u2019s P/S ratio for a moment. \n\nCLOV\u2019s 2020 revenue was $672.9 million compared to $462.3 million in 2019, which puts it at 45.6% increase in growth. They beat their own expectations and those of analysts by a wide margin. In 2018 and 2019, the market valued tech companies with IPOs at an average of 11.7 and 10.4 times (respectively) their previous 12 month earnings. Conservatively, that would put CLOV at $7 billion market cap, which is around $20+ fair value. But in 2020, that number doubled, which would increase CLOV\u2019s market cap significantly. However, for this consideration, I\u2019m using the 2018/19 valuation to be conservative.\n\n**Bottom Line**\n\nThe fair value of CLOV is anywhere from $20-30 fundamentally, which makes it a very risk-free, undervalued stock that has been suppressed by short sellers. But this post is not about the fundamentals - this is about exposing the short sellers\u2019 manipulation of CLOV. On paper, this company is shorted 42.58% (though this is MUCH higher when you include the illegal naked shorts that aren\u2019t reported), making it the highest shorted stock as of Friday. This number could go much higher as short sellers continue to borrow stocks and suppress the price further, which only hurts them more the longer this is shorted. As is common knowledge from previous squeezes, hedge funds are not going to cover anytime soon; they have to be forced by triggering their margins. As the Fed hinted recently, hedge funds are the most leveraged they\u2019ve ever been in the last 20 years, which means retail investors can take advantage of them just like they\u2019ve been taking advantage of retail investors for 100s of years.\n\nI don\u2019t know how much it could squeeze, from $50-150 or much higher, and there\u2019s no telling where the ceiling will end up. The squeeze is inevitable, whether you or I buy it or not, but the process of how long it will take is up to the retail investing community.\n\nCLOV\u2019s Response to Hindenburg Allegations: [https://www.streetinsider.com/Corporate+News/Clover+Health+Investments+%28CLOV%29+Issues+Response+to+Short+Seller+Hindenburg+Research/17921324.html](https://www.streetinsider.com/Corporate+News/Clover+Health+Investments+%28CLOV%29+Issues+Response+to+Short+Seller+Hindenburg+Research/17921324.html)",

I\u2019ll try to make this as simple as possible. \ud83d\udcdd \n\nDD will primarily focus on stock technicals and updated SI numbers for WKHS. \n\nQuick facts I want to share: \n\n\u2022 WKHS will be on S S R (Short Sale Restriction) today (Friday) \n\n\u2022 WKHS hit a record high of short float yesterday (Details later) \n\nFor reference, last time WKHS was on S S R (June 7) it had a green close + rally. \n\nWKHS along with the most popular WSB tickers had a rough day yesterday, but it seems Pre Market is optimistic for today! \ud83d\udcc8 \n\nNow what encouraged me write this DD is Ortex\u2019s \u201cShort Squeeze\u201d signal issued on WKHS earlier. \n\n\nhttps://twitter.com/ortex/status/1403013046335905794?s=21 \n\nAs a subscriber, I further looked into the SI numbers on the Ortex site. \n\nHere\u2019s the updated SI stats as of Yesterday: \n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/H9NumbN \n\nAnd yep... Took me a while to soak those numbers in also... \ud83e\udd2f\n\nRecently WKHS has been creating \u201chigher lows\u201d closing positive 3 of the last 4 trading days. \n\nYesterday, it showed major support at the $15 line.\n\nWith rising trading volume + mentions across social media platforms it truly seems like this could be the prime stock for a legitimate \u201csqueeze\u201d \n\nSo far it\u2019s just gone up on momentum alone. \n\nI also believe bears have run low on excuses to short \n\n\u2022 Last week: WKHS got a downgrade from Cowen \n\n\u2022 Earlier this week: RIDE flash crashed and bears expected it to ripple into WKHS \n\n\u2022 Yesterday was probably their best bet for downside movement (CPI data fears) \n\nAnd yet, all in all, WKHS has held steady (+5% week over week) \n\nUpside potential is just TOO great for me.  \n\nI am personally loaded with 30k shares and averaging!\n\nAnyway, I should stop now as I\u2019m on mobile and it\u2019s getting late so if that seemed quick I apologize! \n\nTo make up for it I looked up the SI stats for the \u201cDaily Popular Tickers\u201d (via Ortex) \n$CLOV $CLNE $BB \n\nHere: https://imgur.com/a/M7ykBQC \n\nEnjoy!!! \ud83e\udd8d",

Your favourite fruit is back for some sweet DD ($CRSR) that will catapult your shitty portfolio into the stratosphere. \n  \n\n\n  Ever heard of Corsair?\n-\nThey are the boys that fill your neat gaming PC full of dope parts. Not only are they a giant in this industry since their inception in 1994, they also got publicly listed last October for a measly **$15.**\n\n-\n\nNow, why should you care?\n-\n\nCorsair has all the properties that can make it THE stock of the decade for WSB - think AMD before they went from $4 to $80, now this time it's from $30 to $300.\n\n-\n\n**1.DeepF#ckingValue**\n-\n\nTheir current market cap stands at **3.12B** on **1.92B sales** and **148m profit.** That\u2019s insane in itself, their current market cap is minuscule and should be at least 5x their revenue. They are making cash hand over fist every quarter and are already a crazy growth rocket. \n\n\n \n\n-\nAs per recent earnings article: *\u201cMajor industry tailwinds seem to be helping Corsair achieve strong growth rates. In the first quarter, its overall revenue grew 72% year over year to $529 million. The company also continues to see improved profitability, as gross margin jumped from 25.5% a year ago to 30.3%.\u201d*\n\n\n-\n**2.Tiny float**\n-\n\nThey IPO\u2019d with only 91.95 million shares outstanding and a float of 88.4 million. This entire sub could outright buy the company out. Jokes aside, this isn't moving a 500m share giant like NOKIA, but rather like your beer filled kiddiepool.\n**3.Cheap Options**\n-\nFlat movement for the last months meaning LOW IV and CHEAP option prices. $40 Calls on November are $2. And long term leaps at $50 barely cost $1.40. Since inception last year, their shares went from $15 to $54 in the span of a couple months. This rally died off when people finally decided to take profits after the IPO. But if options are too rich for you, it's still an excellent time to buy shares and park your cash there while the run up to $50 happens.\n\n**4.Low Risk** \n-\nAlways arguable, but This company just IPOed, is healthy and makes tons of cash. No risk of bankruptcy looming around the corner, or shares being diluted if it his 50$ or 100$. YOU CAN SAFELY PARK YOUR YOLO'd CASH without the company blowing up any second.\n\n**What else?**\n\nAnalysts on SA have a big raging one for CRSR. (link in comments) and there is a very possible breakout about to happen + earnings coming up in August.\n\n\n\nNow what company fits better for millions of Gamestop apes? A Gaming company that will fill every GameStop with little ram sticks and gaming gear. \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\n\n\n**TL:DR** $CRSR is a good bet that could safely triple your money... Or blow your brains out with 3-6 months calls.\n\nObligatory: I LIKE THE STOCK. In for 5k and adding more this month.\n  \n[More notable DD from last week.](reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nsc45n/crsr_huge_volume_breakout_buy_wall_stalemate/)",

        "selftext": "Across the many invest/stock subs there is a lot of meme stock posting going around.  I am not against this by itself, as there is money to be made, but be smart, especially those who are new to this.  \n\nWe have all been there, bought a stock at $10 it goes up to $20 and you're like, it will never fall, then it goes to $15 and you say, when it is back to $20, then I'll sell.  You end up selling at $7 for a loss.  \n\nWhen stocks have these crazy runs, just 'stop-loss limit sell orders.  For example, I'm currently in $CLOV, bought in at $11.65.  It's currently trading at $16.10 at the time of post.  I have a 'stop-loss limit' order at $15.  Meaning, if the stock drops to that level, it sells automatically.  \n\nOf course, it could drop to that level, I sell, and then it rockets to $25, but ignore those.  This will guarantee I can ONLY make a profit.  I HIGHLY recommend you use these automatic sell triggers to prevent yourself from believing STONKS can ONLY go up.  Guarantee you make a profit and while you may be sad when you sell a little early, you will love it when you don't take a loss which I guarantee most of these meme stocks will turn out to be in the long run.  \n\ntl:dr Use stop-loss limit orders to not get screwed over when the bubble burst.

        "selftext": "I found this DD originally posted by /twenty98 5 months ago. I've been following this company ever since. This was before the Amazon partnership I believe but check this out... \n\n**What and who is Clean Energy Fuels Corp?**\n\nThe company is THE leading provide of the cleanest fuel, Natural Gas, for the transportation market in the United States and Canada. They primarily focus in on:\n\n1. Regional Fleets of Trucks\n2. Heavy Duty Trucking\n3. Airport Transit\n4. Public Transit\n5. Construction Vehicles\n6. Waste Management Vehicles (Dump trucks)\n\nIt\u2019s products consist of Compressed Natural Gas (CNG), Renewable Natural Gas (RNG), and Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG). One of its leading products is something called Redeem, which is a form of renewable natural gas (RNG), won\u2019t bother getting into how it\u2019s composed, but know that it provides up to 70% reduction in greenhouse gasses versus diesel and gasoline. Redeem itself is made from organic waste from landfills and farms.\n\n**Natural Gas**\n\nThere has been a lot of stigma around what it really means to be \u201cclean\u201d or \u201cgreen\u201d when it comes to transportation; most of us think that Electric Vehicles seem to be the most green product for transportation out there. EV\u2019s are definitely the future, I just want to state that before getting started spewing out more information, but RNG has huge demand and can definitely lead the way for clean energy. The company itself reduced 745,000 metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions and more than 401,000,000 gallons were sold in 2019.\n\nThis may come as a surprise, but how clean is natural gas? Based only minimal research, it looks to be cleaner than the \u201celectric truck\u201d provided by companies like $HYLN.\n\n**Emission Comparison:**\n\n1. Natural Gas Truck - Produces 0.02g/bhp/hr of NO\n2. Electric Truck - Produces 0.07g/bhp/hr of NO\n3. Diesel Truck - Produces 0.2g/bhp/hr of NO\n\n**Financials &amp; Valuations (as of 9/30/2020):**\n\n* Current Market Capitalization (as of 1/8/2021) - $2.032B\n* Total Revenue (3 months): $70,886,000\n* Total Revenue (9 months): $216,766,000\n* Net Profit (Loss) \u2013 3 months: ($2,539,000) \u2013 Down from ($5,375,000)\n* Net Profit (Loss) \u2013 9 months: ($8,677,000) \u2013 Down from ($25,964,000)\n* Cash on Hand: $91,605,000\n\nThe financials of Clean Energy are not very special, yes they have a high PE ratio, but in this market, really anything is possible. The point is the opportunity, with Biden supplementing a lot of stimulus into the clean energy market, Clean Energy Fuels Corp is poised to get a large piece with it being such a staple within the Natural Gas industry.\n\n**Partnerships &amp; Programs:**\n\n**1.** **Chevron**\n\nChevron partnered with CLNE on July 8th, 2020 with the announcement of the **Adopt-a-Port program**. This will allow fleets across North America to subsidize costs transitioning into a greener product for transportation with cost advantages. Chevron will provide funding for Adopt-a-Port and supply RNG to Clean Energy stations near the ports. Chevron\u2019s funding will allow truck operators to subsidize the cost of buying new RNG-powered trucks. Clean Energy, meanwhile, will manage the program, including offering fueling services for qualified truck operators.\n\n**2.** **Total SE**\n\nTotal is a very large company focusing in refining petroleum. They are the largest shareholder of CLNE @ 26% of outstanding shares. Again, a large company partnering with CLNE to produce revenues in the current year and future years. With Total SE, they\u2019ve partnered with CLNE in a joint venture (valued at around $145 million) to launch the Zero Now Program. The **Zero Now Program** allows companies to purchase a natural gas truck for the same price as they could buy a diesel truck; in the combined deal, they would also offer a discount for fuel up until an agreed time to help persuade the companies to go greener.\n\n**3.** **BP**\n\nThe third partner is BP, CLNE recently announced that it will work with BP to develop, own, and operate RNG facilities at dairies and other agriculture facilities that will produce Redeem. The deal is quite small but could mean big things if the partnership were to be progressed through time.\n\n**4.** **Waste Connections**\n\nWaste connections is the 3rd largest waste collections company in North America, based on market cap, they\u2019re currently worth around $40B. They\u2019ve been a partner with CLNE for years, and have recently promoted one of their regional fleets of dump trucks to RNG vehicles, and will begin operating with Redeem as soon as possible. The fleet consists of 110 trucks in the San Jose area. The deal itself isn\u2019t that great, I must admit, but this could mean big things as if the trial goes well in the San Jose area, this could mean upgrades to their regional fleets across the United States and possibly into Canada.\n\n**5.** **Republic Services**\n\nAnother large company with a long partnership history with Clean Energy Fuels Corp. In February 2019, they announced that they will utilize increasing amounts of Redeem fuel across 21 states over the next 5 years, and this is in process. This transition to cleaner fuel will represent 250,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide emission reduction each year, which translates to around 53,000 passenger vehicles to be taken off the road.\n\n**Summary of Partnerships &amp; Programs**\n\nThese partnerships will continue to provide Clean Energy Fuels Corp. with recurring revenues to drive growth across North America. Their recent and past partnerships continue to give rise to increasing demand of natural gas in one of the largest industries that demands fuel of this nature. The programs in place: Zero Now &amp; Adopt-a-Port program were introduced and will drive growth in the industry by providing incentives to adopting RNG vehicles instead of gasoline or diesel-powered vehicles. There are a lot of advantages to adopting Redeem:\n\n* 70% reudction in greenhouse gases\n* Cost efficient - offered at $1.00/gallon.\n* Renewable\n* Domestic - Moving North America towards energy independence.\n\n**Growth &amp; Opportunities**\n\nWith most of the world in lockdown, and the rise of eCommerce and the need for shipping and delivery services, this will drive the demand for their Redeem product. Companies like UPS, Kroger, FedEx and Republic Services have already signed up for large deals to use the product as a substantially lower cost then Diesel or Gas. The cost of Redeem is $1.00/gallon to give you perspective. Volume growth for their Redeem Product in the past 3 years averaged 34.67% growth; and this was before the Pandemic.\n\nThe Heavy-Duty Truck industry is one of the largest markets for fuel consumption, and so the opportunities are endless to gain more market share as governments are demanding for greener transportation. The Heavy-Duty trucing industry demands 35 billion gallons of fuel, 30 billion over any other market in the big-rig industries.\n\nThere are a lot of opportunities for future advancement throughout the space by making partnerships that will be mutually beneficial for both the world, CLNE, and the company involved. Companies that currently use Natural Gas for their national fleets include: Honda, FritoLay, FedEx, Anheuser Busch, Verizon, Bimbo, J&amp;J, Waste Management, Republic Services, Home Depot, Lowes, AT&amp;TT, Costco, Colgate-Palmolive, PepsiCo, UPS, HP, Unilever, Starbucks, Amazon, Kraft, Kroger, and McDonalds. These companies are large, and there is huge potential for future partnerships with them.\n\n**Other Notes**\n\nYou may be asking yourself: \u201cthat\u2019s not really that impressive, why should I invest?\u201d Well, the recent hype and growth of the opportunities in Clean Energy are very apparent with the large stimulus packages including a lot of subsidies for clean energy companies. Government\u2019s are transitioning to non-gas related vehicles and this will continue to be progressed for years to come. The company itself has recently been partnering with well-known industry leaders that want to be first-movers in the space to transition to greener consumption of transportation.\n\nThe CEO owns 0.7% of shares outstanding. Current shares outstanding are 198M, and of this, the CEO himself owns approximately 1.38 million shares. He definitely believes in the company!\n\n**Price Targets**\n\nSome people may be curious of my price targets for CLNE. It\u2019s been on an absolute tear recently, so I apologize for the late post, but this is just the beginning! My conservative price target is $20 by June 2021, $40 by end of 2022; this is pretty much guessing lol, so take it with a grain of salt.\n\n**Disclosure:**\n\nDo your own due diligence before investing, this is just my personal opinion on the company, and this is not financial advice of any kind! I\u2019m not liable for any losses that you guys might incur! But I do believe in this company!",

        "selftext": "Electric-truck startup Lordstown Motors Corp. RIDE 4.25% disclosed in a new regulatory filing Tuesday that it doesn\u2019t have sufficient cash to start commercial production and has doubts about whether it can continue as a going concern through the end of the year.\n\nThe company amended its annual report to include the going-concern notice, which can flag survival problems for businesses within the next 12 months. The warning comes as new challenges emerge for the two-year-old firm that is trying to convert a former General Motors Co. plant in Ohio to produce electric pickup trucks. It has said its first model, the Endurance, will start production in September.\n\nLordstown Motors Chief Executive Steve Burns said on a call with analysts in late May that the startup would need to raise more capital to hit its target of building 2,200 pickup trucks by year-end. The company said at the time that higher-than-expected costs were accelerating its cash burn and that it would finish the year with between $50 million and $75 million on hand.\n\nThe company was among a number of new electric-vehicle startups that went public last year through reverse mergers with special-purpose acquisition companies, or SPACs. Lordstown raised $675 million from its reverse merger last fall, a deal that valued the aspiring truck maker at about $1.6 billion.\n\nThe company didn\u2019t immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/articles/lordstown-motors-amends-annual-filing-with-going-concern-notice-11623181411",

        "selftext": "Pembina  Pipeline Corp. has struck a  friendly deal to acquire Inter Pipeline  Ltd. for $8.3 billion in an  all-share deal after the midstream company  was put in play earlier this  year.\n\nUnder  the terms of the deal, shareholders of Inter Pipeline will  receive  half a share of Pembina for each share held, valuing the deal at  $19.45  per share based on the most recent closing price. That trumps  the  unsolicited $16.50 offer from Brookfield Infrastructure Partners LP   that Inter Pipeline rebuffed earlier this year. According to the release   issued Tuesday, Pembina\u2019s executive team will lead the combined  entity,  while Inter Pipeline will have representation on the board of   directors.\n\nInter Pipeline Chair  Margaret McKenzie said the deal with Pembina  represented the best value  for shareholders after the company launched a  strategic review in  February.\n\n\u201cIt was evident that a  combination with Pembina offered compelling  value for Inter Pipeline  shareholders in the short-term, as well as the  opportunity to  participate in the upside of \\[the Heartland Petrochemical  Complex\\] and  the combined business longer-term,\u201d she said in the  release.\n\n\u201cThe  creation of a more highly integrated business across the energy   infrastructure value chain results in a combined entity that is greater   than the sum of its parts.\u201d\n\nThat  Heartland Petrochemical Complex has been key to Inter Pipeline\u2019s  path  forward, with the project outside Edmonton slated to produce  525,000  tonnes of polypropylene per year upon completion.

        "selftext": "As a sequel to \"10 interesting and useful ETFs with less than $1b AUM\", I'm back with 10 more ETFs that have less than $1b AUM but that I think are interesting and possibly useful and some comments on each.  Too often only the biggest ETFs, or most popular, get people's attention. I think it's worth looking further to see what's out there.\n\nStarting with a Peter Lynch inspired strategy (Lynch popularized the price/earnings-to-growth ratio),\n\n1. SPGP: Invesco S&amp;P 500 GARP ETF, [https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&amp;ticker=SPGP](https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&amp;ticker=SPGP) . \"Growth at a Reasonable Price\" (GARP).  This ETF is an interesting combination factor screener.  It only selects from S&amp;P 500 stocks, and screens them first for 3-year earnings and sales growth, and second for financial leverage (debt), return on equity, and earnings yield (trailing-twelve-month or \"TTM\" net income / market cap).  Holdings are weighted by growth score, not market cap.  GARP's historical performance is surprisingly good; it beat the S&amp;P 500 since January 2020 and beats both the S&amp;P and traditional CRSP growth/value factors YTD.  It also outperforms the S&amp;P on some longer timeframes.  Index rebalanced semiannually (3rd Friday June/Dec), and it costs a moderate 0.34% ER.  It's designed to hold 75 stocks.  Check SPGP out when it rebalances later in the month!\n\nMoving on to Factor ETFs,\n\n2.  FVAL: Fidelity Value Factor ETF, [https://screener.fidelity.com/ftgw/etf/snapshot/snapshot.jhtml?symbols=FVAL](https://screener.fidelity.com/ftgw/etf/snapshot/snapshot.jhtml?symbols=FVAL) .  This ETF tracks and index that calculates scores for: free cash flow yield, EBITDA to enterprise value, book value to price, and forward earnings to price. The first two factors result in it having some tech giants such as FB, GOOGL, AMZN, and AAPL in the index. But not some others, such as TSLA, which scores very poorly on... well, every factor. Banks are just scored on book to price and forward earnings to price, as their business model is not comparable to most other stocks. FVAL provides an interesting way to get exposure to possibly-not-overpriced intellectual property-heavy companies, as well as traditional value stocks.  Currently holds about 130 stocks.\n\n3.  FIVA: Fidelity International Value Factor ETF, [https://screener.fidelity.com/ftgw/etf/goto/snapshot/snapshot.jhtml?symbols=FIVA](https://screener.fidelity.com/ftgw/etf/goto/snapshot/snapshot.jhtml?symbols=FIVA) .  The international (mostly developed markets) counterpart to FVAL, this ETF fills a great niche since forward-looking international value ETFs are few and far between.  Most value ETFs are heavy on book value, and rely on backward looking metrics or ignore free cash flow.  FIVA (and FVAL) take a different approach.  Currently holds about 120 stocks.  FIVA is perhaps the single most overlooked ETF in this entire list -- it provides a unique type of international exposure, and at only 0.39% ER. International factor funds often have slightly higher ERs than total market funds, but may provide much greater total return given desirable macro-economic conditions.  For example, since the first vaccine was proven effective (which kicked off the value rally), FIVA has outperformed VEA by about 6 percent.\n\n4.  JVAL: JPMorgan U.S. Value Factor ETF, [https://am.jpmorgan.com/us/en/asset-management/adv/products/jpmorgan-us-value-factor-etf-46641q753](https://am.jpmorgan.com/us/en/asset-management/adv/products/jpmorgan-us-value-factor-etf-46641q753) .  JVAL's index is also a value screen. It scores via four metrics: earnings yield, book to price, free cash flow yield, and TTM dividend yield. Pretty well-rounded in that it includes earnings, book, and yield measures. It does not include forward earnings metrics. Due to the cash flow and earnings metrics, it ends up including some big tech companies like FB, GOOGL, and MSFT. While it includes a dividend metric, the JVAL ETF has a lower 30-day SEC yield than VTV or dividend-focused ETFs such as SCHD, so I would not consider it as a dividend fund.  Holds about 350 stocks.  \n\n5. FQAL: Fidelity Quality Factor ETF, [https://screener.fidelity.com/ftgw/etf/goto/snapshot/snapshot.jhtml?symbols=fqal](https://screener.fidelity.com/ftgw/etf/goto/snapshot/snapshot.jhtml?symbols=fqal) .  Quality ETFs depart from value ETFs in that they're less concerned about price/earnings metrics.   Fidelity's offering in the space weights stocks on free cash flow margin, return on invested capital (one of Charlie Munger's favorite metrics), and free cash flow stability.  For banks, it looks at return on equity and debt to assets.  This ends up having a lot of overlap with the S&amp;P 500, but it ends up filtering out companies like TSLA and as per its goal, only has about 130 companies overall.  Like FVAL, this costs 0.29% ER.  Fairly common for US factor funds.\n\n6. JQUA: JPMorgan U.S. Quality Factor ETF, [https://am.jpmorgan.com/us/en/asset-management/adv/products/jpmorgan-us-quality-factor-etf-46641q761](https://am.jpmorgan.com/us/en/asset-management/adv/products/jpmorgan-us-quality-factor-etf-46641q761) .  JPMorgan handles \"quality\" a bit differently.  They have 10, yes ten, different metrics that go into measuring quality.  They're grouped into categories for \"profitability\", \"solvency and financial risk\", and \"earnings quality\".  Loosely stated, they're looking for companies making reliable cold hard cash hand over fist that are not too indebted.  Like the Fidelity offering, it ends up looking a lot like the S&amp;P 500 but with slightly different weights.  GOOGL currently sits at the top of its holdings.\n\nLet us not forget commodities,\n\n7. COM: Direxion Auspice Broad Commodity Strategy ETF, [https://www.direxion.com/product/auspice-broad-commodity-strategy-etf](https://www.direxion.com/product/auspice-broad-commodity-strategy-etf) .  A fascinating ETF, it covers 12 different commodity futures in categories for metals, agriculture, and energy.  Different from most other commodity ETFs, it's almost like a commodity trend advisor (CTA) fund because it can take both long and \"flat\" (neutral/no) position in each commodity.  This helped COM wonderfully during the commodity crash in 2Q20 because they were able to go flat and preserve value, avoiding the oil crash.  If inflation comes back big time, commodities will benefit.  And if a commodity bubble bursts, this fund may be able to avoid some of the downside.  No K-1 form.  Might be my go-to outside of GUNR (equity ETF) for commodity exposure.\n\n8. CMDY: iShares Bloomberg Roll Select Commodity Strategy ETF, [https://www.ishares.com/us/products/292741/ishares-bloomberg-roll-select-commodity-strategy-etf-fund](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/292741/ishares-bloomberg-roll-select-commodity-strategy-etf-fund) .  A somewhat newer offering from Blackrock, this broad commodity fund systematically positions itself to best handle carry cost in the futures curve (and thus adjusts for contango / backwardation curves).  It has generally outperformed other popular long-only commodity funds, and avoid being overweight on oil/energy futures.\n\nSeeking dividends?\n\n9. SCHY: Schwab International Dividend Equity ETF, [https://www.schwabassetmanagement.com/products/schy](https://www.schwabassetmanagement.com/products/schy) . A new offering from Schwab, it's the international counterpart to SCHD.  Its index filters for companies that have made 10 consecutive years of dividend payments, and ranks them by cash flow to total debt, return on equity, dividend yield, and 5-year dividend growth rate.  After a volatility screen, the results are weighted by a capped market capitalization approach.  A wonderful mirror to SCHD for those seeking reliable income, but who also want to diversify outside of US markets.  I predict its AUM will go up by 10x in less than 2 years.  Also quite inexpensive at 0.14% ER -- Schwab is likely subsidizing this, in order to help it grow.\n\nFinally, like it or not, blockchain is here to stay,\n\n10. BLOK: Amplify Transformational Data Sharing ETF, [https://amplifyetfs.com/blok.html](https://amplifyetfs.com/blok.html) .  The AUM of this ETF is right around the $1b mark, but I'm including it anyway.  It seems to be the best-of-breed actively managed ETF for exposure to stocks benefiting from bitcoin mania and blockchain tech.  Clearly, it's volatile.  And it's not a pure bitcoin/ethereum play -- some small amounts of Samsung, IBM, and so on sneak in due to them having a connection to the space.  But it does hit all the big names, including recently listed Coinbase ($COIN).  If you can't be bothered to follow or deal with crypto in general but want something that will remain correlated to it, this is the ETF.  Pricey at 0.71% ER, but, it's actively managed and still has a lower ER than ARK's funds.\n\nDisclaimers: this is not financial advice. I currently have a position in FVAL, but no position in any of the other ETFs at time of posting.  That may change at any point in the future.  I am not predicting future performance for any of these funds.  Do your own due diligence (and please post in reply with what you find!).\n\nWhat do you guys think? Any of those look like something you might invest in? Anyone else want to comment on a personal favorite small/medium sized fund?",

        "selftext": " **What is MLFB?**\n\nMLFB (Major League Football) is seeking to be the premier developmental league for the NFL.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Why they will succeed**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The business plan**\n\nThe recent ventures of the AAF and XFL have proved proof of concept as far as the interest, ticket sales, and TV viewership. MLFB is working off of their realized revenue figures but cutting expenses down from roughly $20M/week to $30M/year. They have an advantage in having a realistic expected revenue to base their spending off of. This is huge for long term success.\n\nMLFB is NOT trying to compete with the NFL but has structured everything in coordination with the NFL to best develop talent. The rules will be the same. The referees will be the same. NFL teams will have access to all of the game and practice tape and will be allowed to sign players at any point. Full seasons will run from the beginning of May through the 4th of July weekend so that players will be down in time for the start of NFL training camps. Once the NFL starts signing players from the league that do well, it will give validity to the league, increase viewership, and motivate players to be play in the league even more.\n\nThe league will be run with the same organizational structure that the MLS currently has and has been successful with. All teams will be owned by the league to ensure parody and to ensure that teams do not go bankrupt trying to outspend each other. Partial individual ownership of teams can be introduced once the league is successful as MLS has done. Players in the league will play for the team closest to their region as much as possible to save on expenses and to align former college players most closely with their old fan base. The cities in which these teams will be located are teams without a current professional major league team in any sport. This allows for a greater chance for the local fan base to be loyal and support the team through ticket sales and merchandise sales.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The people to know**\n\nFrank Murtha \u2013 CEO \u2013 Frank is a former sports agent, law professor (taught for more than 10 years Sports Labor Relations and Negotiations at Northwestern University\u2019s Graduate School), and federal financial crimes prosecutor. His work as an agent includes negotiating contracts for NFL players in the past like Olandis Gary, Al Del Greco, Akiem Hicks, etc. And in baseball, he has represented Wade Boggs, Randy Johnson, Craig Counsel, Joe Girardi, Cecil Fielder, and Bobby Thigpen.  He has the contacts in the sports industry to give this league the boost it needs.\n\nBritt Jennings \u2013 Board Member - Fund manager for The Bedrock Fund and large shareholder. More than the money investment, his time investment as a board member shows that he sees real value here. Also gives credibility to the organization because there is no reason to risk doing anything shady with such a small company with the position he has.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Catalysts**\n\nMLFB has stated in numerous filing this year that due to the pandemic, they will be following through on plans for a shortened demonstration season. As of the last filing on May 19th, \u201cthe MLFB Board of Directors also announced that they are continuing with plans to play a short Demonstration season in the summer of 2021.\u201d\n\nThis demonstration season has a high likelihood of being played between the conclusion of The Spring League and the beginning of the NFL preseason which would correlate to the end of June through beginning of August. This means that another filing and PR with details of the season should be expected within the next week or so.\n\nIn January, hope of this announcement around the Superbowl pushed the stock price to just under .07. The actual announcement should send the price many multiples higher.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Valuation**\n\nMLFB currently holds a $12M valuation. Projected revenue for year 1 is roughly $20M. MLS teams (same organizational structure as MLFB) trade at 7x revenue. That alone puts year 1 value at $140M (11-12x of current value). Factor in the high upside potential and the fact that every fan will want to own stock in the league they are watching on TV and this could fly much higher than expected by this time next year. It is difficult to accurately predict how big of a factor this could be as no other league has ever been launched with a large number of public shareholders already invested as fans to promote the league and encourage others to watch.\n\nCurrent share price is .03 and I am expecting .15-.25 off of initial PR with .50 by end of July. Details of the TV contract, coverage by major sports networks and publications, and the meme-ability of a football stock leave the upside potential with an enormous roof. \n\nIt is important to note that in the last filing, warrants were given to 14 key employees and consultants at a price of .07 showing the faith of insiders to surpass this price.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Links:**\n\nFor ongoing DD and updates, there is a dedicated sub that is updated regularly.\n\nTo get up to the minute SEC filing updates go here:\n\nGo to http://www.mlfb.com and click \u201cfollow MLFB\u201d to be emailed with any SEC filings or official PR\n\nAbout 30 minutes in they start talking about MLFB:\n\nhttps://xflnewsroom.com/podcast/what-to-know-about-major-league-football-mlfb-featuring-josh-davis/\n\nhttp://investingbulletin.com/2020/12/major-league-football-inc-otcmlfb-announces-preparations-for-a-2021-season-with-training-camp-in-florida-headquarters/\n\nHow does MLFB compare with XFL and CFL?\n\nhttps://xflnewshub.com/xfl-news/major-league-football-mlfb-announces-plans-for-spring-2021-season/\n\nFrank\u2019s interview in 2015 about dealing with high pressure situations.\n\nhttps://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/cubs/ct-steve-bartman-20151010-story.html\n\nhttps://pigskinnut.com/xfl-decision-to-play-in-2022-leaves-door-open-for-the-mlfb/\n\nhttps://dd7pmep5szm19.cloudfront.net/2245/0001640334-20-001884.htm\n\nhttps://www.buffalobills.com/audio/frank-murtha-mlfb-professional-spring-football-16841044\n\nhttps://talkingotc.com/https-www-talkingotc-com-blog-google-com-pub-4421096629830534-direct-f08c47fec0942fa0/post/114066/mlfb-major-league-football-2021\n\nhttps://www.thescore.com/xfl/news/1921673/the-dream-that-wont-die-will-a-new-alternative-football-league-ever-last\n\nhttps://talkingotc.com/https-www-talkingotc-com-blog-google-com-pub-4421096629830534-direct-f08c47fec0942fa0/post/120351/mlfb-major-league-football\n\nhttps://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2019/07/08/former-arena-league-commissioner-buys-aaf-equipment-at-auction/\n\nDisclaimer that stocks go up and down and you need to do your own research and not trust a random person on the internet.

        "selftext": "Hello degenerates. \n\nI've been looking into the EV market and everyone always says you late to the party or missed the train when buying EV shares (Missing the boat with TESLA etc). Its like the California gold rush in the old times! People rushed out to make money and find gold but the real entrepreneurs made money selling them their shovels, buckets, food and clothes. Electric Vehicles need charging bays, its a  no brainier?!? SO how on gods green earth can BLNK Shares be heavily shorted to 30% and \"Experts\" say this sector should see nothing but growth! \n\nI've done some very basic DD on BLNK. I've always been quite optimistic in this space for electric vehicles and for those that dont know BLNK provides charging solutions for Electric Vehicles. As of December 2020 they had 16, 617 charging stations around the USA but they are one of the most heavily shorted stocks on the NYSE. Over 30% short interest. I would hate to know what the outstanding naked short value is. \n\nNow when you look at expected Electric vehicle sales forecasts below:\n\n*\"The US electric vehicles market is expected to reach 6.9 million unit sales by 2025, up from 1.4 million unit sales forecast for 2020\"*\n\n[https://www.spglobal.com/platts/en/market-insights/latest-news/electric-power/111920-us-ev-market-sales-to-rise-to-69-million-units-by-2025-frost-amp-sullivan](https://www.spglobal.com/platts/en/market-insights/latest-news/electric-power/111920-us-ev-market-sales-to-rise-to-69-million-units-by-2025-frost-amp-sullivan)\n\nDeloitte even say this sector will continue to boom for the next 10 years.  \"Our global *EV forecast* is for a compound annual growth rate of 29 per cent achieved over the next ten years\"\n\n[https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/focus/future-of-mobility/electric-vehicle-trends-2030.html](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/focus/future-of-mobility/electric-vehicle-trends-2030.html)\n\nAND EVEN FORBES SAYS IT!!! I know Forbes hasn't always been on our apes side for the GME battle and AMC war but they seem to contradicting what is currently going on in EV charging! \n\n[https://www.forbes.com/sites/neilwinton/2021/03/09/electric-cars-are-coming-and-if-you-dont-like-it-tough/?sh=6f8be1c5698f](https://www.forbes.com/sites/neilwinton/2021/03/09/electric-cars-are-coming-and-if-you-dont-like-it-tough/?sh=6f8be1c5698f) \n\n*\u201cWith the prospect of sticker price parity even without subsidies by  2025, we take a strong positive view on EV penetration. We raise our  global EV sales forecasts again, this time mainly driven by higher  estimates for the U.S. market. We expect the Biden administration to  increase direct support for EV purchases,\u201d the UBS report said.*\n\n*The Biden plan for 500,000 charging stations would more than double  the current count, while it could impose tougher fuel economy standards  to curb ICE car sales. The ban on ICE sales by governments like  Britain\u2019s will also give a powerful signal to buyers to embrace  electric. .\"*\n\n They also out shot analyst expectations for revenue for the previous quarter see below.\n\n## Blink Charging (NASDAQ:BLNK) Earnings Information\n\nBlink  Charging last announced its quarterly earnings data on May 12th, 2021.  The reported ($0.18) EPS for the quarter, missing analysts' consensus  estimates of ($0.17) by $0.01. **The company had revenue of $2.23 million  for the quarter, compared to analysts' expectations of $1.71 million.**  Blink Charging has generated ($0.59) earnings per share over the last  year. Blink Charging has not formally confirmed its next earnings  publication date, but the company's estimated earnings date is Thursday,  August 12th, 2021 based off prior year's report dates.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8zncmbtdsm271.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ad2848ae0b193b360ddf5f727fe8b0e051c1b480\n\nI also cant explain how BLNK had a share price above 3600 in 2010. Maybe some wrinkled brains can help explain.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ucgewxa3um271.png?width=1610&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d8bf33e2f66e875cd6ec05d96c78450366962c42\n\nSo in ending for now I cant help but wonder what the hell is going on in the EV charging scene. With all this talk about the future Being EV, Biden backing the electric F150 and international markets across the scene being so bullish. How can one stock like BLNK be so heavily shorted. I would love to know how many Naked shorts have been placed against a company like this. \n\nI'm No financial advisor nor am I calling for people to load up on BLNK to squeeze the hell out of these hedge funds and their short positions. And just to clarify I am holding shares in BLNK and have been for some time.",

Full seasons will run from the beginning of May through the 4th of July weekend so that players will be down in time for the start of NFL training camps. Once the NFL starts signing players from the league that do well, it will give validity to the league, increase viewership, and motivate players to be play in the league even more.\n\nThe league will be run with the same organizational structure that the MLS currently has and has been successful with. All teams will be owned by the league to ensure parody and to ensure that teams do not go bankrupt trying to outspend each other. Partial individual ownership of teams can be introduced once the league is successful as MLS has done. Players in the league will play for the team closest to their region as much as possible to save on expenses and to align former college players most closely with their old fan base. The cities in which these teams will be located are teams without a current professional major league team in any sport. This allows for a greater chance for the local fan base to be loyal and support the team through ticket sales and merchandise sales.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The people to know**\n\nFrank Murtha \u2013 CEO \u2013 Frank is a former sports agent, law professor (taught for more than 10 years Sports Labor Relations and Negotiations at Northwestern University\u2019s Graduate School), and federal financial crimes prosecutor. His work as an agent includes negotiating contracts for NFL players in the past like Olandis Gary, Al Del Greco, Akiem Hicks, etc. And in baseball, he has represented Wade Boggs, Randy Johnson, Craig Counsel, Joe Girardi, Cecil Fielder, and Bobby Thigpen.  He has the contacts in the sports industry to give this league the boost it needs.\n\nBritt Jennings \u2013 Board Member - Fund manager for The Bedrock Fund and large shareholder. More than the money investment, his time investment as a board member shows that he sees real value here. Also gives credibility to the organization because there is no reason to risk doing anything shady with such a small company with the position he has.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Catalysts**\n\nMLFB has stated in numerous filing this year that due to the pandemic, they will be following through on plans for a shortened demonstration season. As of the last filing on May 19th, \u201cthe MLFB Board of Directors also announced that they are continuing with plans to play a short Demonstration season in the summer of 2021.\u201d\n\nThis demonstration season has a high likelihood of being played between the conclusion of The Spring League and the beginning of the NFL preseason which would correlate to the end of June through beginning of August. This means that another filing and PR with details of the season should be expected within the next week or so.\n\nIn January, hope of this announcement around the Superbowl pushed the stock price to just under .07. The actual announcement should send the price many multiples higher.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Valuation**\n\nMLFB currently holds a $12M valuation. Projected revenue for year 1 is roughly $20M. MLS teams (same organizational structure as MLFB) trade at 7x revenue. That alone puts year 1 value at $140M (11-12x of current value). Factor in the high upside potential and the fact that every fan will want to own stock in the league they are watching on TV and this could fly much higher than expected by this time next year. It is difficult to accurately predict how big of a factor this could be as no other league has ever been launched with a large number of public shareholders already invested as fans to promote the league and encourage others to watch.\n\nCurrent share price is .03 and I am expecting .15-.25 off of initial PR with .50 by end of July. Details of the TV contract, coverage by major sports networks and publications, and the meme-ability of a football stock leave the upside potential with an enormous roof. \n\nIt is important to note that in the last filing, warrants were given to 14 key employees and consultants at a price of .07 showing the faith of insiders to surpass this price.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Links:**\n\nFor ongoing DD and updates, there is a dedicated sub that is updated regularly.\n\nTo get up to the minute SEC filing updates go here:\n\nGo to http://www.mlfb.com and click \u201cfollow MLFB\u201d to be emailed with any SEC filings or official PR\n\nAbout 30 minutes in they start talking about MLFB:\n\nhttps://xflnewsroom.com/podcast/what-to-know-about-major-league-football-mlfb-featuring-josh-davis/\n\nhttp://investingbulletin.com/2020/12/major-league-football-inc-otcmlfb-announces-preparations-for-a-2021-season-with-training-camp-in-florida-headquarters/\n\nHow does MLFB compare with XFL and CFL?\n\nhttps://xflnewshub.com/xfl-news/major-league-football-mlfb-announces-plans-for-spring-2021-season/\n\nFrank\u2019s interview in 2015 about dealing with high pressure situations.\n\nhttps://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/cubs/ct-steve-bartman-20151010-story.html\n\nhttps://pigskinnut.com/xfl-decision-to-play-in-2022-leaves-door-open-for-the-mlfb/\n\nhttps://dd7pmep5szm19.cloudfront.net/2245/0001640334-20-001884.htm\n\nhttps://www.buffalobills.com/audio/frank-murtha-mlfb-professional-spring-football-16841044\n\nhttps://talkingotc.com/https-www-talkingotc-com-blog-google-com-pub-4421096629830534-direct-f08c47fec0942fa0/post/114066/mlfb-major-league-football-2021\n\nhttps://www.thescore.com/xfl/news/1921673/the-dream-that-wont-die-will-a-new-alternative-football-league-ever-last\n\nhttps://talkingotc.com/https-www-talkingotc-com-blog-google-com-pub-4421096629830534-direct-f08c47fec0942fa0/post/120351/mlfb-major-league-football\n\nhttps://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2019/07/08/former-arena-league-commissioner-buys-aaf-equipment-at-auction/\n\nDisclaimer that stocks go up and down and you need to do your own research and not trust a random person on the internet.

        "selftext": " If your looking to play AMC using options, you will find out how expensive even the far out of the money strikes are going for. Once you analysis the risk/reward. You will find that playing AMC options is not a great way to make money. The way you go around this is by playing correlated stocks. If you trade spy, you know that as an index, it moves with the market, especially tech, as it comprises 30% or higher of the index. What you might not know is that stocks are also correlated to other similar stocks. For example, if you trade tech, you will find that FB leads the way for alot of the tech stock. The highestcorrelation is FB to MSFT. MSFT will literally mirror FB by a nano second. Stocks such as SNAP and TWTR will also follow FB, but its not as strongly correlated to FB, but is more informed by the moves of FB. I tried out a theory that meme stocks can also be correlated. I took the most recent hype train stocks for my play over AMC. I traded MVIS, SPCE to prove out my theory and also checked other meme stocks such as expr, nok, bb, etc. They all played out similar to amc, however with much lower gains. If your wondering why i choose mvis and spce over the others. Its due to how much air space they had over the others and also the amount of price movement in dollar amounts and not % amounts.",

        "selftext": "Hear me out on this one as we are on the brink of theScore's BIGGEST catalyst.\n\nPosition: 1K shares at an avg of $CAD 12.18.\n\nThe stock is traded on the NASDAQ &amp; TSX under ticker: SCR\n\n**Some context on the company and it\u2019s industries (Sports Media/Sports Betting):**\n\nTheScore mobile is the number 1 most used sports app in Canada with 10 times more users than ESPN. It\u2019s one of the most used sports mobile apps in all of North America citing almost 4 BILLION user sessions over the last year. They have industry leading rates of user engagement at an average of 130 minutes per visitor with each user opening the app an average of 125 times a month.\n\nThis engagement is due to the many features in the app including: real-time sports news, live scores, in-game highlights, a social ecosystem where fans can chat and discuss live games, add friends, send private messages, etc. They have original media content, in-game odds, sports betting content and even personalized promos for bettors based on their in-app media interests. They\u2019ve reported close to 4 million unique users per month.\n\nTheScore achieved this success despite being a small company against industry titans. They\u2019re no stranger to being an underdog which now follows them in the mobile sports betting industry. PASPA was repealed in 2018 allowing individual states to offer legalized, regulated sports betting. The North American opportunity for this industry is estimated to represent a $US 22 billion opportunity by 2025.\n\ntheScore made the decision in 2019 to enter the market as an operator in [NJ through a partnership with Darby Development](https://mobile.thescore.com/2019/09/introducing-thescore-bet-thescores-mobile-sportsbook-launches-in-new-jersey/) with their Score Bet app. They have since expanded operations to a total of 4 betting states (NJ, CO, IN, IO) and have acquired market access agreements across 14 states via a [partnership with Penn National](https://mobile.thescore.com/2019/07/thescore-and-penn-national-gaming-enter-into-strategic-multi-state-market-access-partnership/) and other market access deals ([CZR deal](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210329005427/en/theScore-Secures-Market-Access-for-Mobile-Sports-Betting-in-Illinois-Through-Agreement-with-Caesars-Entertainment)) which represent more than 30% of the U.S. population and a $US 8.2 billion opportunity for them. The CEO and founder, John Levy, has stated that by next year they will be operating in at least double the amount of states and that they\u2019ll be active in 35 States within 3 to 5 years.\n\nTheScore recently rebuilt their media app completely in-house to increase its performance, stability, and scalability, likely related to continued user growth and future betting integrations. They\u2019ve built their \u201cFuse\u201d and \u201cBet Section\u201d as a fully integrated approach to link their gaming and media apps. Users of both apps can now build their bet slip while benefiting from all of theScore\u2019s features. When they\u2019re ready to finalize their bet, they\u2019ll be taken to the [Score Bet app](https://www.thescore.bet/) to place their bet or cash out. This is a defining feature that their highly engaged userbase will remember and one that will lead to higher rates of retention vs competitors that treat the bet as just a transaction. This approach not only increases retention rates but also greatly reduces their customer acquisition costs in an industry that is renowned for not having brand loyalty.\n\nThe New Jersey handle (Percentage of the total amount of bets taken in the State) rose 195% versus the prior year, validating that their unique combination of media and betting remains a powerful differentiating factor against competitors in their oldest operating State. Total gaming handle also grew 46% overall compared to the previous quarter. They are the only media company to be operating their own book and they\u2019ve been seeing these early signs of success. Other companies have started to take notice as they\u2019ve been buying or partnering with media companies via expensive deals (ex: [DKNG 1](https://www.sportico.com/business/sports-betting/2021/draftkings-buys-vsin-1234625970/), [DKNG 2](https://www.draftkings.com/about/news/2020/09/draftkings-and-espn-enter-into-co-exclusive-content-integration-agreement/?wpsrc=Organic%20Search&amp;wpaffn=Google&amp;wpkw=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.draftkings.com%2Fabout%2Fnews%2F2020%2F09%2Fdraftkings-and-espn-enter-into-co-exclusive-content-integration-agreement%2F&amp;wpcn=about&amp;wpscn=news%2F2020%2F09%2Fdraftkings-and-espn-enter-into-co-exclusive-content-integration-agreement%2F), [PENN](https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/1/29/21113130/barstool-sports-penn-national-deal-dave-portnoy-chernin), [FOX](https://www.starsgroup.com/press-center/the-stars-group-news/the-stars-group-and-fox-sports-announce-historic-u-s-media-and-sports-wagering-partnership)). However, they have not been able to develop the same seamless approach that theScore has attained internally.\n\ntheScore, like all other sports betting companies is currently sitting at a negative EBITDA. They reported a loss of (17.5 M) in the last quarter. This is because we are still in the early days of a high-growth industry. Companies have to get passed all of the free promotions and incentives that are offered, Market entry costs, etc and then they have to retain their users to start seeing profits. They reported a handle of 81,6 million, a 491% YoY increase, with Net gaming revenue being ($2.4M) and a media revenue of $8.0 M, a 17% increase.\n\ntheScore is not the loudest nor the flashiest betting operator. You won\u2019t see Score ads like you do with some other companies because they\u2019re targeting their existing userbase in a way that is financially responsible. They aren't aiming to do flashy deals. They won\u2019t win by trying to outspend the big guys, but they already know this, as it\u2019s a situation that they've already been through. Instead they're growing their numbers organically with their customer focus.\n\n**So, what\u2019s this huge catalyst that I spoke of?**\n\nThe Legalization of Mobile Sports Betting in Canada, where theScore Media app is a household name will [likely take place](https://nationalpost.com/news/politics/here-are-the-liberal-bills-likely-to-pass-this-spring-and-others-that-could-be-doomed-by-an-election) within the next 3 weeks or earlier.\n\nLast week, bill C-218 passed its 2nd reading in the Senate, this is often where the biggest risk lies.\n\nTomorrow, it will be studied by a Standing Committee. After passing that stage it will then move to 3rd reading before becoming law.\n\nThe bill is supported by provincial bodies, [by every major sports league](https://www.gamblingnews.com/news/cga-major-sports-leagues-support-the-push-for-single-event-wagering/), and even sports broadcast companies as their viewership numbers continue to decline. It just so happens that the [Deputy Chair of the reviewing committee](https://sencanada.ca/en/senators/smith-larry-w/) also served as [Commissioner of the Canadian Football League (CFL)](https://www.tsn.ca/cfl/video/cfl-hopes-for-the-pass-of-bill-c-218-in-order-to-boost-future-revenue~2205144).\n\nThe opportunity presented by this bill passing is forecasted to be US$4 to US$5+ billion at maturity. TheScore is actively preparing for this opportunity and extremely well-positioned to benefit long-term as Canada\u2019s leading mobile sports media brand.\n\n10% penetration of the Canadian Market = $US 400 Million15% penetration of the Canadian Market = $US 625 Million20% penetration of the Canadian Market = $US 850 Million\n\nThe current market cap is valued at $US 843.647M which indicates that this legalization is not currently priced in, as it wouldn't take into consideration everything else that theScore has built. The stock\u2019s technicals have bottomed out and we can finally see that the trend is reversing. All of this, combined with SCR\u2019s low float will mean an explosive next few weeks.\n\n**Bonus info about eSports:**\n\n\\- Gen Z is half as likely as millennials to watch live sports and 2x more likely to never watch\n\n\\- 35% of Gen Z identify as eSports fans, a higher percentage than NASCAR, MLB and NHL\n\n\\- There\u2019s a potential for \\~6 million new bettors with an outsized affinity for eSports over the next five years\n\n\\- 495 million people watched eSports online or on television in 2020, worldwide and viewers are projected to grow to 646 million by 2023.\n\neSports betting will be one of the biggest categories of sports betting over the long term, if not the biggest. theScore eSports has the #1 esports media following with 186.5 million reported video views in their most recent quarter, which represents a 139% YoY growth and an average social media reach of 88 million a month. Guess who\u2019s actively seeking and preparing opportunities to enter this space?\n\n**TLDR:** PEOPLE LIKE GAMBLING ON SPORTS AND ESPORTS. SCR, the #1 Canadian Sports Media app entered Sports Betting and is seeing encouraging results. They\u2019re also the leading eSports media brand and are actively seeking to enter esports betting which will eventually become one of the biggest betting categories.\n\nLegalization of Canadian Sports betting is expected in the next weeks + US Sports betting expansion means that this company is extremely undervalued for its future potential in a $US 22 Billion industry. \ud83d\ude80",

They report 139x greater intracellular AUC of dFdCTP. \n\n**The CEO:**\n\nHugh Griffith (Founder, CEO &amp; Board Member): \n\n28 years in biopharmaceuticals. Chief operating officer of a company bought by Genzyme, now Sanofi. Graduated honours. Inventor of 80 patents, 135 patents pending. Plus held senior positions at AbbVie and Pfizer.\n\n**Other drugs in pipeline:**\n\nI wont go to far into these as these are just icing for longer term potential. You're realistically investing in Acelerin at the moment. \n\nNUC-3373: In Phase 1. Cancer treatment intended to replace 5-FU\n\nNUC-7738 In Phase 1. Another cancer treament in pipeline.\n\nBoth have had results worth looking deeper into. But as I said, I'm currently investing in the potential of Acelerin.\n\n**PRICE:**\n\nAt a 5 year low. $2.93 is it's low point, it is currently 3.06 as I type this.\n\n**Analysts:**\n\n57% Strong Buy\n\n43% Buy\n\nHigh: $22.05, Average: 16.03, Low, 8.02\n\n**Institutions:**\n\nOn the high side. 78.75% ownership, increased 4.60%\n\n**Why is it so low?**\n\nThere was a big share dilution in sept 2020 is my best guess. \n\nCash: 78.6m with a net income of around -35 mil last year.\n\n**Bull Argument:**\n\nIn Phase 3 of a potential game changer for chemotherapy. Had good results in Phase 2.\n\nExcellent, proven leadership.\n\nOther drugs in pipeline are in the same wheelhouse as their current flagship drug Acelerin, so if Acelerin becomes a winner, you may have 2 more winners on your hands.\n\nCost is way down. Perhaps a 5 year low.\n\nHigh institutional ownership.\n\nHigh analyist ratings.\n\nI think that further dilution(if it happens) will easily be offset by general gains, because of the significant improvement it promises over current treatments.\n\nHuge market. 150 billion spent on cancer a year.\n\nVery little short interest.\n\nNot a meme stock, yet.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Bear Argument:**\n\nDiluted shares by around 50% recently.\n\nNo revenue yet\n\nMax 2 years of cash. May need to do share dilutions again.\n\nCancer treatment is a common market for bio companies. Lot of competition.\n\nIf Acelerin fails, the company will be in a really bad spot, with low cash on hand and no solid prospects.",

        "selftext": " We all like tendies, so from one ape to another, hear me out on this one as we are on the brink of this company's BIGGEST catalyst.   \n\n\n**Some context on the company and it\u2019s industries (Sports Media/Sports Betting):**\n\nTheScore mobile is the number 1 most used sports app in Canada with 10 times more users than ESPN. It\u2019s one of the most used sports mobile apps in all of North America citing almost 4 BILLION user sessions over the last year. They have industry leading rates of user engagement at an average of 130 minutes per visitor with each user opening the app an average of 125 times a month.\n\nThis engagement is due to the many features in the app including: real-time sports news, live scores, in-game highlights, a social ecosystem where fans can chat and discuss live games, add friends, send private messages, etc. They have original media content, in-game odds, sports betting content and even personalized promos for bettors based on their in-app media interests. They\u2019ve reported close to 4 million unique users per month.\n\nTheScore achieved this success despite being a small company against industry titans. They\u2019re no stranger to being an underdog which now follows them in the mobile sports betting industry. PASPA was repealed in 2018 allowing individual states to offer legalized, regulated sports betting. The North American opportunity for this industry is estimated to represent a $US 22 billion opportunity by 2025.\n\ntheScore made the decision in 2019 to enter the market as an operator in [NJ through a partnership with Darby Development](https://mobile.thescore.com/2019/09/introducing-thescore-bet-thescores-mobile-sportsbook-launches-in-new-jersey/) with their Score Bet app. They have since expanded operations to a total of 4 betting states (NJ, CO, IN, IO) and have acquired market access agreements across 14 states via a [partnership with Penn National](https://mobile.thescore.com/2019/07/thescore-and-penn-national-gaming-enter-into-strategic-multi-state-market-access-partnership/) and other market access deals ([CZR deal](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210329005427/en/theScore-Secures-Market-Access-for-Mobile-Sports-Betting-in-Illinois-Through-Agreement-with-Caesars-Entertainment)) which represent more than 30% of the U.S. population and a $US 8.2 billion opportunity for them. The CEO and founder, John Levy, has stated that by next year they will be operating in at least double the amount of states and that they\u2019ll be active in 35 States within 3 to 5 years.\n\nTheScore recently rebuilt their media app completely in-house to increase its performance, stability, and scalability, likely related to continued user growth and future betting integrations. They\u2019ve built their \u201cFuse\u201d and \u201cBet Section\u201d as a fully integrated approach to link their gaming and media apps. Users of both apps can now build their bet slip while benefiting from all of theScore\u2019s features. When they\u2019re ready to finalize their bet, they\u2019ll be taken to the [Score Bet app](https://www.thescore.bet/) to place their bet or cash out. This is a defining feature that their highly engaged userbase will remember and one that will lead to higher rates of retention vs competitors that treat the bet as just a transaction. This approach not only increases retention rates but also greatly reduces their customer acquisition costs in an industry that is renowned for not having brand loyalty.\n\nThe New Jersey handle (Percentage of the total amount of bets taken in the State) rose 195% versus the prior year, validating that their unique combination of media and betting remains a powerful differentiating factor against competitors in their oldest operating State. Total gaming handle also grew 46% overall compared to the previous quarter. They are the only media company to be operating their own book and they\u2019ve been seeing these early signs of success. Other companies have started to take notice as they\u2019ve been buying or partnering with media companies via expensive deals (ex: [DKNG 1](https://www.sportico.com/business/sports-betting/2021/draftkings-buys-vsin-1234625970/), [DKNG 2](https://www.draftkings.com/about/news/2020/09/draftkings-and-espn-enter-into-co-exclusive-content-integration-agreement/?wpsrc=Organic%20Search&amp;wpaffn=Google&amp;wpkw=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.draftkings.com%2Fabout%2Fnews%2F2020%2F09%2Fdraftkings-and-espn-enter-into-co-exclusive-content-integration-agreement%2F&amp;wpcn=about&amp;wpscn=news%2F2020%2F09%2Fdraftkings-and-espn-enter-into-co-exclusive-content-integration-agreement%2F), [PENN](https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/1/29/21113130/barstool-sports-penn-national-deal-dave-portnoy-chernin), [FOX](https://www.starsgroup.com/press-center/the-stars-group-news/the-stars-group-and-fox-sports-announce-historic-u-s-media-and-sports-wagering-partnership)). However, they have not been able to develop the same seamless approach that theScore has attained internally.\n\ntheScore is not the loudest nor the flashiest betting operator. You won\u2019t see Score ads like you do with some other companies because they\u2019re targeting their existing userbase in a way that is financially responsible. They aren't aiming to do flashy deals. They won\u2019t win by trying to outspend the big guys, but they already know this, as it\u2019s a situation that they've already been through. Instead they're growing their numbers organically with their customer focus.\n\n**So, what\u2019s this huge catalyst that I spoke of?**\n\nThe Legalization of Mobile Sports Betting in Canada, where theScore Media app is a household name will [likely take place](https://nationalpost.com/news/politics/here-are-the-liberal-bills-likely-to-pass-this-spring-and-others-that-could-be-doomed-by-an-election) within the next 3 weeks or earlier.\n\nLast week, bill C-218 passed its 2nd reading in the Senate, this is often where the biggest risk lies.\n\nTomorrow, it will be studied by a Standing Committee. After passing that stage it will then move to 3rd reading before becoming law.\n\nThe bill is supported by provincial bodies, [by every major sports league](https://www.gamblingnews.com/news/cga-major-sports-leagues-support-the-push-for-single-event-wagering/), and even sports broadcast companies as their viewership numbers continue to decline. It just so happens that the [Deputy Chair of the reviewing committee](https://sencanada.ca/en/senators/smith-larry-w/) also served as [Commissioner of the Canadian Football League (CFL)](https://www.tsn.ca/cfl/video/cfl-hopes-for-the-pass-of-bill-c-218-in-order-to-boost-future-revenue~2205144).\n\nThe opportunity presented by this bill passing is forecasted to be US$4 to US$5+ billion at maturity. TheScore is actively preparing for this opportunity and extremely well-positioned to benefit long-term as Canada\u2019s leading mobile sports media brand.\n\n10% penetration of the Canadian Market = $US 400 Million15% penetration of the Canadian Market = $US 625 Million20% penetration of the Canadian Market = $US 850 Million\n\nThe current market cap is valued at $US 843.647M which indicates that this legalization is not currently priced in, as it wouldn't take into consideration everything else that theScore has built. The stock\u2019s technicals have bottomed out and we can finally see that the trend is reversing. All of this, combined with SCR\u2019s low float will mean an explosive next few weeks.\n\n**Bonus info about eSports:**\n\n\\- Gen Z is half as likely as millennials to watch live sports and 2x more likely to never watch\n\n\\- 35% of Gen Z identify as eSports fans, a higher percentage than NASCAR, MLB and NHL\n\n\\- There\u2019s a potential for \\~6 million new bettors with an outsized affinity for eSports over the next five years\n\n\\- 495 million people watched eSports online or on television in 2020, worldwide and viewers are projected to grow to 646 million by 2023.\n\neSports betting will be one of the biggest categories of sports betting over the long term, if not the biggest. theScore eSports has the #1 esports media following with 186.5 million reported video views in their most recent quarter, which represents a 139% YoY growth and an average social media reach of 88 million a month. Guess who\u2019s actively seeking and preparing opportunities to enter this space?\n\n**TLDR:** APES &amp; DEGENERATES LIKE GAMBLING ON SPORTS AND ESPORTS. SCR, the #1 Canadian Sports Media app entered Sports Betting and is seeing encouraging results. They\u2019re also the leading eSports media brand and are actively seeking to enter esports betting which will eventually become one of the biggest betting categories. Legalization of Canadian Sports betting in the next weeks + US Sports betting expansion means that this company is extremely undervalued for its future potential in a $US 22 Billion industry. \ud83d\ude80",

Share-price declines and a ticking clock to take companies public are ratcheting up the pressure.\n\nThe new challenges for creators of special-purpose acquisition companies, or SPACs, result in part from the abundance of the deals that raised money early in 2021. Looming over these firms is a two-year deadline to do a deal or hand back cash to investors. \n\nNow that shares of many SPAC-related companies have fallen, fewer startups are interested in going public through a SPAC. That mismatch is intensifying competition between some blank-check firms for the same private firms, known by some on Wall Street as a \u201cSPAC-off.\u201d\n\nSPACs are shell companies that raise money and list on an exchange with the sole intent of merging with a private firm to take it public. The private company, often a startup, then gets the SPAC\u2019s place in the stock market. Blank-check mergers let companies going public make future business projections\u2014which aren\u2019t allowed in regular IPOs\u2014one reason they took Wall Street by storm this winter and have raised a record $105 billion this year, according to SPAC Research. \n\nBut with SPAC shares in retreat, many blank-check firms now trade below their debut price. Many companies in recent months have said that several different SPACs have asked them about mergers, a trend that contributed to the frenzy in the sector.\n\nThe pressure to execute deals at realistic valuations could get even more intense in the months ahead because nearly 260 blank-check companies with about $87 billion on hand face merger deadlines in the first three months of 2023, according to a Methuselah Advisors analysis of SPAC Research figures. \n\nWhile such deadlines can be extended, they can pressure SPAC teams that often need several months to finish deals and now face turbulent market conditions.\u00a0\n\n\u201cThere is an awful lot of capital sitting there that has to find a home,\u201d said John Chachas, co-managing principal at Methuselah, a boutique investment bank. \u201cYou\u2019re going to see a fair number of less-than-desirable deals done just because they have to get done.\u201d\n\nPrivate companies open to SPAC mergers should focus on their business, then begin exploring blank-check options next year, Mr. Chachas said. By then, many SPAC teams could be desperate to finish deals before their deadlines and make generous offers.\u00a0\n\nWith investors retreating in recent weeks from early-stage investments, shares of many companies tied to SPACs\u2014including those taking genetic-testing firm 23andMe Inc., electric-vehicle battery maker Microvast Inc. and flying-taxi startup Joby Aviation public\u2014have fallen about 30% or more since mid-February.  \n\nSigns that regulators are taking a stricter stance on the once-hot sector also have pressured the stocks. Regulatory questions have slowed the timeline for finishing mergers and cut new issuance of blank-check companies to a fraction of the record levels from earlier this year. Just two of the 23 SPACs that announced deals in May are trading above their initial public offering price, figures from data provider SPAC Research show.  \n\nIf no deal is done by the final date\u2014after any extensions\u2014the SPAC creators have to return money to investors and lose what they put in up front to create the shell companies, typically several million dollars for underwriting fees and other expenses. In that scenario, they also don\u2019t get the deeply discounted shares that let them make several times their initial investment, on average.\n\nThose incentives explain why many blank-check mergers will still get done in the months ahead\u2014even if they are completed at lower valuations or the SPAC teams have to give away some of the discounted shares to complete the deals. \n\nBecause of the market reversal, some analysts now expect private companies and investors in SPAC mergers to have more leverage when negotiating deal terms with blank-check firms. The shift shows how many on Wall Street and in Silicon Valley are grappling with the unprecedented market environment created by SPACs, which were a rarely used alternative to traditional initial public offerings before late 2020 and are now evolving quickly. \n\n\u201cPeople are getting a lot more choosy,\u201d said Kristi Marvin, founder of data and research provider SPACInsider.\n\nMany investors say smaller SPACs will likely face the most pressure, while the most well known backers such as venture capitalist Chamath Palihapitiya continue to churn out deals.\n\nBecause investors can typically withdraw at that low IPO price per share, plus a tiny bit of interest, before SPAC mergers are completed, low share prices mean many are likely to do so to eliminate the possibility of taking a loss. That can leave the SPAC with much less money, potentially forcing executives to find other sources of cash or renegotiate some terms of the deal.\n\n\u201cThey are going to have to be more careful with what the valuation is and what they are agreeing to,\u201d said Patrick Galley, a SPAC investor and CEO of RiverNorth Capital Management.\n\nInvestors who put money into SPAC mergers through a fundraising round called a private investment in public equity, or PIPE, could particularly benefit. Large PIPE investors include funds managed by asset management giants BlackRock Inc. and Fidelity Investments Inc. Their money is critical to deals and is added to the cash held by the blank-check company to complete a merger several times as large as the SPAC itself. \n\nIn one sign that PIPE investors could now get better terms, mobile entertainment firm Jam City recently said PIPE investors bought into the company at $8.42 a share in its roughly $1.2 billion SPAC merger, including debt. That is a discounted price unavailable to other investors. \n\nStill, some analysts say momentum in the market could quickly change once again, particularly if some strong deals draw investors back into the space.  \n\n\u201cThree months from now, the market could look very different,\u201d Ms. Marvin said. \u201cIt could be game on again.\u201d",

To me, it seems like it will neither be transitory, nor small. Given the recent government stimulus, commodity price hikes, supply shortages, labour shortages, etc., this inflation will probably last a while! At least 12 months, probably longer. Unless, of course, we enter another crisis similar to 2008 or, God forbid, the Great Depression. A lot of people are facing the prospect of being evicted in June, but we do have the unemployment benefit and the Child Tax Credits so that's a plus.

Rapid and sudden increase in the value of the contracts as the underlying security increase in price at a rate previously unmatched within 5 years but prior to then this rate of change was a common or repeating occurrence.\n2. A sudden change in the availability of a crucial commodity that is produced by the company when generating profit\n3. The value of the company should be reflected by the reserves that are profitable to extract at prices higher than current commodity prices but lower that previous highs.\n4. Storage of the raw and refined commodity is both impractical and expensive on a large scale\n5. Regulatory, Tax and Consumer Preferences have a major impact on the availability of the good\n6. A shortage of the good would result in widespread economic and financial losses but is hard to predict and impossible to prevent\n7.

No/unreasonably small increase in the cost of similar options with longer durations and or closer to the money strike prices\n12. Contracts that cost less than $0.10 that could be exercised for a profit in less than a week of steady gains equal to 1/3 the average daily price move\n13.

A high barrier to entry and limited number of quality companies in the industry.\n\n**Current Examples: BTE July and June Calls 1.5 Strike picked up at 15 cents.**\n\nLook at my post history:  The numbers don't lie and **BIR**, TK, DBA calls have been major gains.\n\nI studied energy infrastructure in China and spoke to officials in the government overseeing energy legislation. I interviewed the top commentators and public + private fund managers. I have 5 papers and a ton of reports to back up my FA. Empirical evidence mounting and market validation up the wazooo.\n\n**Spoiler Alert**: Natural Gas and Condensate producers are priced as if they will rise in a linear and predictable way that mirrors their 5 year downward trend caused by an event that cannot be replicated to the extent it was 5 years ago.\n\nI have waited until a significant number of these experimental trades have been executed and studied by myself in an open and transparent process involving me making posts in communities on the internet including this forum outlining the opportunity and specific rational for that contract. So far the average position size of $122.5 USD has returned $660.00 dollars net of tcosts and borrowing fees over a period of 1 year.\n\n2 contracts have expired worthless and only one of them was never ITM. Why do electricity and nat gas prices SPIKE when expressed as the share price of ETPs employing a VIX like rolling of  (constant maturity futures)? The inability to store the physical commodity in order to offset the risk of delivering a future contract at a price many times higher than both spot and long dated contracts cannot be mitigated for volatility, gas and electricity  like with other commodities.\n\nIn a 2018 study by Avellaneda and Papanicolaou the VIX volatility skew and tail size compared to that only of other commodities that can not be stored and distributed easily (electricity and nat gas).\n\nPartial backwardation periods for Nat Gas are common during severe weather events and create periods where the spot price rises well above the long term average price. A temporary rise in commodity price is enough to generate a slightly delayed and less significant, but both in absolute/relative terms large enough to cause the intrinsic and extrinsic value of the calls to more than double in addition to premiums for hedges to increase as well.\n\nBecause the lower liquidity of natural gas derivatives, hedging using longer dated futures as opposed to options is far more common and retail investors can take advantage by needing less liquidity to hedge long positions in small cap stocks and realize gains by exercising or selling the calls.\n\nThe time decay is offset by several unique characteristics. The first consideration is the ability of the natural gas producer to lock in sales at peak prices due to the extreme social and economic cost of forgoing electricity generation using gas turbines and diverting residential heating fuel. This means selling cash secured puts and exercising some calls with the residual risk capital left over from subtracting the cost of buying the calls from the return. The long term change in retained earnings and book value of the company will prevent a mean reversion in the stock price following the spot prices rapid correction. The common shares left over then become ideal for CC writing and selling cash secured puts while IV is high but new earnings and sticky commodity prices help prop up share prices.\n\nThe importance lies in timing of buying of options contracts designed to cost small amounts of premium over time, in exchange for a return on investment that is many times the value of expired contracts. During periods of very low volatility, purchasing the majority of OTM and longer dated contracts gives the ability to max the return on capital due to gamma and the lower marginal cost increases when buying longer dated contracts.",

The IPO consisted of 3,731,344 common shares and warrants. The common shares were sold at $4.15 each and the warrants are exercisable at $4.57 each for up to five years.  \n   \nALF shares are trading at a 49% discount from the IPO price. While it\u2019s not unusual for IPO shares to contract after the event, there usually comes an inflection point where the shares begin to gain. We believe ALF shares have reached that point and with a tiny float, these shares could move quickly.  \n   \n**The scope of the AI driven Alfi SaaS product is awe inspiring and may have you saying, \u201cwhat the heck? I didn\u2019t even know that was possible.\u201d**  \n   \nAlfi is developing an AI enterprise SaaS platform powering computer vision with machine learning models, and deep learning to deliver the right content, to the right person at the right time. When a consumer interacts with an ALFI Tablet, Kiosk, or internet content, the software begins a sophisticated AI assisted data capture. The digital device then displays content/advertising relevant to its analysis of the viewer.  \n   \nThe company has provided a\u00a0[brief overview video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7XTQqUEN2U)\u00a0of the firm's SaaS platform. This video may be a critical part of your due diligence.  \n   \nDigital advertising isn\u2019t new, but Digital out of Home (DOOH) advertising, utilizing AI to generate and report data from consumer interactions is still in its infancy. This niche in advertising is where ALF lives right now.  \n   \nThe market for tracking and reporting on DOOH advertising activity is expected to grow at a double-digit CAGR through 2023. Imagine getting into a taxi or a ride share vehicle and there\u2019s an interactive pad on the back of the headrest or going to a mall and interacting with kiosk. This kind of technology will become ubiquitous in the near term, and ALF is one of the leaders and innovators in the sector.  \n   \n**The overall market for digital advertising is $614 billion.**  \n   \nAlf is already reporting positive results in more than 12 separate pilot programs deploying over 1,000 devices and expects to start generating revenues in Q2 and be profitable by Q421. The company plans to have tablets installed in 100,000 ride share vehicles within 4-5 years.  \n   \nThese are the applications ALF wants to deploy both to brands and to businesses to generate revenues:  \n   \nAirports and Malls \u2013 Kiosks  \nTaxis and Rideshares \u2013 Tablets  \nEnterprise Software \u2013 SaaS  \nData Analytics \u2013 Subscriptions  \n   \nAlfi plans to woo ride share drivers and taxis and others with participation in the revenues generated by placing a tablet in their vehicles or locations.  \n   \nUnderstanding the sophistication of the Alfi software may best be understood by their disclaimer statements:  \n   \nALF is compliant with all GDPR, CCPA, and HIPAA standards. Alfi\u2019s proprietary Ai algorithm understands small facial cues and perceptual details. The automation works in a way that respects user privacy; without tracking, storing cookies, or using identifiable personal information. The company states it will not store facial images.  \n   \nWe look at ALF as a rare opportunity to get involved in a new IPO with the technology of the future, a future that is starting right now. There may be the potential for a triple digit increase in value here.  \n   \nStay tuned for our full report on ALF.  \n[Disclaimer](https://mailchi.mp/tradersnewssource/recent-ipo-providing-ai-assisted-brand-building?e=[UNIQID])\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Catch me if you can!](https://preview.redd.it/6agncoisqn271.jpg?width=203&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=40ecbc53ac8b28d3596f164085001d6c2fd877cd)",

        "selftext": "&gt; Hey there /r/PennyStocks! I'm a YouTuber with ~45k subscribers and I run a research-based stock DD channel. **In observance of the self-promotion etiquette &amp; rules of this subreddit, and out of respect to the moderators and community here, I am *not* going to include a link to my channel.** I'm covering $BBI in a 40-minute feature this week on my channel, and I have included a synopsis of the video here, including my SWOT Analysis. Let's have a good discussion!\n\n**Brickell Biotech Inc**\n\n**$MNMD (*trades on the NASDAQ*)**\n\n**Price Per Share** $0.82\n\n**Market Cap** $54.77M\n\n**Shares Outstanding** 67.18M\n\n**Shares Float** 65.92M\n\n(*Source: Webull, 2021/06/01 @0300EST*)\n\n&gt;Superficially and at first glance, **Brickell Biotech** looks like a *terrible* investment. The company is pre-clinical and only receives minimal revenue from royalties, it\u2019s in the middle of a $50M dilution and has a shelf filed for another $100M, and just recently in 2019 it carried out a 1-for-7 reverse split for the sake of listing compliance while the company was conducting its 48-week-long Phase 2b trial for its flagship product, a proprietary **Sofpironium Bromide Gel** used to treat Axillary Hyperhidrosis (uncontrollable and excessive underarm sweat production). **However, it\u2019s important to remember that investing is not always about blindly *HODLing*, and that there\u2019s predictable money to be made in short-term trades when there are pending catalysts on the horizon, and this is one such instance.**\n\n&gt;The company\u2019s **Sofpironium Bromide Gel** is wrapping its two Phase-3 safety trials (aptly named Cardigan I and Cardigan II\u2026get it? *sweater*?), with Cardigan I already having achieved full enrollment and being scheduled to wrap on July 1st, 2021 and Cardigan II having reached 70% enrollment per the company\u2019s last relevant PR and being scheduled to wrap on September 1st, 2021. The company has been releasing PR all along the way, and small share price jumps have been seen each time. Predictable PR announcements with these studies wrapping and initial assessments from the company about their results can be seen as **Catalysts #1 and #2**. The company stated in its last ER two weeks ago that the studies are on track to complete as scheduled and the company will announce the aggregated results of Cardigan I &amp; II sometime in Q4 2021. This is **Catalyst #3**, the big one.\n\n&gt;However, you might say, betting on successful Phase-3 results is at best a gamble, and normally you\u2019d be correct. In this case, though, we have evidence that the trials are likely to be successful. Brickell\u2019s proprietary Sofpironium Bromide Gel was licensed out to the Japanese pharmaceutical company, **Kaken**, which has already put to market their version of this clinical-strength antiperspirant called **ECCLOCK**, which has already been fully covered by the Japanese National Health Insurance, and Kaken just recently began paying royalties to Brickell (only $17K to this point, which is admittedly nothing, though we do not know how the contract is structured). Kaken\u2019s internal estimates are that ECCLOCK will reach ~$18M in sales in Japan this year. For comparison, Brickell\u2019s primary competing product in America, a Glycopyrronium Bromide cloth wipe called Qbrexza (Dermira), racked up $24M in sales in 2020. Japan\u2019s population is ~33% that of America and the company is forecasting ~75% of Qbrexza\u2019s sales with ECCLOCK in Japan. Obviously it\u2019s tough to make a direct comparison here (Qbrexza is not sold in Japan), but you get the idea. The product has been well-received.\n\n&gt;**My point from the section above is not that this is some amazing company with a mind-blowing product. Rather, my point is that successful results from the Phase-3 study are probable since the formulation has already been approved in Japan and has hit the market there.** Japan also has strict approval standards for pharmaceutical products. Personally, I have no desire to hold this stock long term because following the Phase-3 news, there\u2019s going to be a 10+ month dry spell of no catalysts after Brickell files the NDA with the FDA and the FDA reviews it. *It\u2019s not like there\u2019s going to be expedited approval granted to a clinical-strength antiperspirant to help super sweaty people in the middle of a global pandemic lol.* During that time, to be frank, it is likely that Brickell will continue to dilute their shares to fund operations with the remaining $100M on their filed shelf offering (in the last ER, the CEO stated the company does not need to tap that $100M until 2022). I have no interest in maintaining a position through that storm and will have closed my position before that point.\n\n&gt;During the last few quarters, **institutions** have been making net additions to their positions, **and insiders have been buying.** It\u2019s particularly noteworthy that in May, the co-founder of the company and the company\u2019s Chief Research Officer both made large purchases around the $0.80 range. This $0.80 price has demonstrated that it is a strong support level since July, and even while we\u2019re in the middle of the $50M offering, which has a price-depressing effect on shares, the price is holding strong at $0.80 or slightly above.\n\n&gt;It is my intention to enter a position today, and slowly and entirely bleed off that position during **Catalysts #1, #2, and #3** above.\n\n&gt;*NOTE: Brickell also has a partnership with another Japanese company, AnGen, for the development of a COVID-19 vaccine, but that vaccine is **not likely to finish testing until 2022 at the earliest**, and there\u2019s no guarantee it gains approval at all. For the purposes of my investment thesis here, this partnership is irrelevant, but it is worth noting for people who may want to hold shares of $BBI longer (for whatever masochistic reason that may be).*\n\n\n***SWOT Analysis:***\n\n\n**Strengths**\n\n\n* Axillary Hyperhidrosis is an underserved medical issue; there are no other clinical-strength gels that address this effectively.\n\n* Brickell\u2019s gel-type product is a familiar antiperspirant delivery system (unlike Qbrexza wipes). \n\n* The company believes current cash will support operations into 2022.\n\n* The company is receiving a small amount of revenue, which will help offset R&amp;D expenses, from royalty and sales-based milestone payments of ECCLOCK from Kaken in Japan.\n\n* There are 2 medium and 1 large catalysts before the end of 2021 (I know the words medium and large are subjective, but I\u2019m unsure how else to describe them accurately).\n\n* Institutions have been increasing their positions &amp; insiders have been recently buying.\n\n* $0.80/share has been a strong support level since July 2020 (being breached once on news of a dilution in October 2020) and we are likely at or near the bottom.\n\n\n**Weaknesses**\n\n\n* A $150M shelf offering was filed in March, and of that total, $50M worth of sales is currently in progress, which is depressing the stock price.\n\n* Because of the low trading volume, this will likely continue to depress the price for a while longer, perhaps making **Catalyst #1** smaller than I anticipate (average daily trading volume is ~1M shares, but it\u2019s impossible for me to guess how many of those are new shares being trickled into the market to determine when the offering will end).\n\n* The company has minimal current revenue; it is almost wholly dependent on cash reserves and income from the ongoing offering.\n\n* Brickell\u2019s Sofpironium Bromide Gel will be the second such bromide anticholinergic antiperspirant to market (Qbrexza).\n\n* The company\u2019s previous reverse split in 2019 sets a precedent for the **merciless and total destruction of shareholder value**.\n\n\n**Opportunities**\n\n\n* Kaken is licensed to sell products beyond Japan and throughout East Asia. This is likely irrelevant to this thesis, but it could create another PR catalyst during the term of this investment.\n\n* ~5% of US population suffers from Hyperhidrosis and around two-thirds of that group suffer from Axillary Hyperhidrosis, setting the TAM fairly high. \n\n* Insurance price coverage for ECCLOCK has been already achieved (Japanese NHI) and would likely be granted by Medicare in the States in the distant future (again, another catalyst for long-term holders).\n\n* **This is pure speculation my part.** There is a possible buyout by Eli Lilly here. Brickell\u2019s CEO previously served as the CMO with Eli Lilly and was with that company for 20+ years. In 2020 Eli Lilly acquired Dermira for $1.1B and gained with it the rights to Qbrexza. Eli Lilly just recently divested Qbrexza and is in need of a new Axillary Hyperhidrosis treatment option.\n\n* The partnership with AnGes for a COVID vaccine could, possibly, lead to some PR (but there is no actual vaccine until 2022 at the earliest, so temper your expectations here).\n\n\n**Threats**\n\n\n* The company cannot file its NDA until ~Q1 2022 (possibly a little earlier, but unlikely), and it takes ~10 months for approval.\n\n* There is, of course, no guarantee NDA is even approved and the company has little else in the pipeline.\n\n* It is unclear why the company opted to go with the 15% Sofpironium Bromide Gel in the U.S. when the 5% Sofpironium Bromide Gel formulation was approved in Japan. This seems potentially risky.\n\n* More dilution is inevitable with 2/3 of the March shelf offering price still available for sale. The company claims it has enough cash to last into 2022, but how often have we seen claims like this with pre-clinical biotech companies?\n\n* A reverse stock split is always possible. We\u2019re currently under $1 per share. NASDAQ will likely send a letter to the company soon informing Brickell they have 6 months to regain compliance. If the Phase-3 data is bad in Q4, then a reverse split becomes probable.\n\n\n&gt;**TL;DR** Brickell Biotech has 3 upcoming catalysts stemming from soon-to-be concluding Phase-3 trials for its flagship product, a proprietary clinical antiperspirant gel called Sofpironium Bromide. Based on available evidence, positive results from the trials are a likely outcome. I am not viewing this as a long-term hold, but rather a strategic position to enter and exit, taking advantage of the catalysts and closing out the position before additional share dilution hits in 2022. ***Don\u2019t sweat it!***\n\n\n&gt;Good luck investing, everyone! This one is all about *timing*. Please remember- ***bulls make money, bears make money, pigs get slaughtered***.",

        "selftext": " \n\n80% in own of retail investors Currently,\n\nall real stocks (not naked shorts) are counted, and on June 2nd you will know how many naked shorts are in roughly real terms.\n\nRumor has it in the US that it should be between 1 and 2 billion pieces, which would be an empty catastrophe for the hedge funds. If the retail traders keep buying and do not let themselves be unsettled by the massive \"negative\" interference from media such as CNBC, Motley Fool, Fox News as well as moderators such as Jim Cramer or hedge fund manager Rich Greenfield and hold their shares (HODL) , it is possible that the share, as in the VW Shortqueeze 2008 ($ 1,000 per share), will also skyrocket. This is because the hedgies have to cover their short positions.\n\n!!The longer the retail traders hold their shares instead of selling them during the squeeze, the higher the price can rise. At Reddit, where the \"Apes\" exchange ideas, the mood was such that a few months ago they spoke of a possible floor of $ 1,000.!! ((this floor is rly possibre? xD))\n\nDue to the many phenomenal reports from brilliant analysts in the forum, there is now talk of a floor of 10,000 or even 100,000 dollars per share.\n\nThis all sounds completely crazy, but it is not impossible if the investors do not sell too early during a short squeeze. This is exactly what the Hedgies in the USA are terrified of. For a few weeks now, bots have been flooding in, which are intended to unsettle investors and encourage them to sell - via Reddit, Twitter and Youtube.\n\nHardly ever seen on this scale. The trouble is that this doesn't work because the community sticks together so well that the numerous \"ladder attacks\" have no consequences. Now the SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) comes into play with its new chairman, Gary Gensler, who had closely observed the game stop process and is now introducing the first changes to the rules of the game for the hedgies, which are supposed to make shorting a lot more difficult . At the recent conference hearing, Gensler mentioned that he wanted to create more fairness and transparency for small investors.\n\nThis is roughly the opposite of what the hedge funds want.\n\nCopied from [https://insideparadeplatz.ch/](https://insideparadeplatz.ch/)",

        "selftext": "Good morning everyone, make sure to check out the Patreon for the daily posts throughout the week.\n\n*This list is geared towards day trading. With the momentum watchlist especially, I am typically in and out very quickly, only occasionally longer than a couple minutes, usually faster scalps.* Always have a plan when you enter a trade (for profit taking and for taking a loss), and use proper risk management for your account.\n\n**Main Watchlist:**\n\nGapping UP: BABA, NIO, AMD, BA, UAL, CLDR, AMC\n\nGapping DOWN: XIM, CVAC, LEDS\n\n**Momentum Watchlist**\n\n* VTNR (+25%): Up on momentum from past couple days of trading, as well as another price target upgrade. Seeing good volume and price action in premarket. Could see more upwards movement today with the momentum, but I'll be cautious, as this could get over-extended.\u00a0\n* OEG (+45%): Up after announcing its recently acquired subsidiary reached an agreement for a 700-mile construction project in Mississippi. Seeing strong volume and price action at the moment, I'll be watching to see if the momentum continues.\n* LCTX (+10%): Up after reporting additional cases of retinal tissue restoration in patients treated with their drug. Seeing okay volume and price action in premarket. Daily chart looks bullish so I'll be keeping an eye on this one.\u00a0\n* AKBA (+8%):\u00a0Up after FDA set action date for their anemia drug. Seeing decent price action and volume in premarket.\u00a0\n* APOP (+13%): Couldn't find a relevant catalyst. Daily chart looks bullish, so I'll be keeping an eye on this one.\n\n**Market Outlook:**\n\nThe market is showing strength this morning, and stocks are looking to open higher after the long weekend. SPY\u00a0is trading just over 422, and we should finally see that push to new ATH. DIA\u00a0is a bit further off from ATH levels, trading just above 348. Tech stocks\u00a0are up in premarket, but lagging a bit behind the overall market. Gold\u00a0and silver are green at the moment, and crude oil is up quite a bit this morning. Bitcoin is currently trading around 36,400, and most cryptos look pretty bearish at the moment. Crypto-related stocks\u00a0are somewhat mixed in premarket trading. Marijuana stocks\u00a0are showing some strength in premarket trading and are worth following with some potential upcoming catalysts. HITID (new ticker HITI) is being uplisted to Nasdaq today, so it will be one to watch in the near future. Meme stocks\u00a0are also showing signs of continued strength, and will be worth following this week.\n\nRemember to use proper risk management, by making sure you size appropriately for your account and have a plan for every trade you enter (both for taking profits and cutting losses).

        "selftext": " \n\nVale(Ticker:Vale)\n\nI bet you heard of China and Australia trade war.Both of them are big trading partner.By 2019 almost two-third of China\u2019s iron ore came from Australia,more than Brazil,South Africa and included India combined.Despite the tension between two nations, China\u2019s economy grow 18.3% In Q1 2021 amid the corona pandemic,China demand for iron ore is booming while Iron ore price hit all time high.\n\nBeside from the politics,it is also crucial to point out the disruption is EV(Electric Vehicle).In this article I will explain which public company will benefit the most from this commodity supercycle as well as politics tension between Australia and China.Furthermore,playing as a keyrole in EV manufacturing by supplying Nickel and other commodity and give a valuation whether company is trading at a discount or overvalue\n\nVale is a iron ore giant miners as well as remain the largest miner of Nickel.In addition,they also provided others raw material such as copper, cobalt, platinum, rhodium, ruthenium, iridium, gold, and silver.\n\nNeedlessly to say,Metals and Mining is capital-intensive business,especially during Covid 19,Low-cost operator will withstand the disprution in global suppluy chain as well as sustaining the liquidity and cash flow to fund its operation ,and Vale is one of them.\n\nAmong their compatitors which is Rio Tinto (Ticker:Rio), BHP Groups (Ticker:BHP) FSUGY Metal Groups (Ticker: FSUGY) I found their competitor comparable in term of magnitude and revenue,asset value also include Credit availability.\n\nThese Miners are all low-cost operator,my measurement for low-cost is their pross profit on total revenue,in other words,their profit margin.As following:\n\nVale:52.82%\n\nRio:43.04%\n\nBHP:47.68%\n\nFSUGY:54.60%\n\n(Source:Marketwatch)\n\nAs can be observed,these all miners benefit the most from inflationary when almost every nations have to \u201cprint money\u201d to aid their economy.Commodity always benefit the most,especially they may enter supercyle in demand.Thus political tension as I have mentioned above,providing etreme favourable environment for miners.\n\nHowever,when choosing to invest in various industry,investor must acquire stakes as a sensible price to achieve a decent return rate while mitigating risk.I will provide a comprehensive analysis company which I found most promising and undervalued compare to their peers(This is not financial advice,please do your research)\n\nTo begin with, I have to mention a few bacckgroung story about Vale:\n\nIn 2019,one of Vale\u2019s dam collapsed,killing almost 259 and 11 remain missing,it was in Brumadinho.In 2015,Mariana dam killed 270 people.Just these two tragic really a red flag for me.I really doubt their code of ethics and profession standard in over cutting-cost too much by building tailing dam.\n\nVale agree to pay 7B dollars to compensate for the damage it did to nature and people.\n\nIn Addition,Vale\u2019s former CEO and other 15 people faced homicide and additional envirometal charge.\n\nDespite company effort to improve its image,I think it will remain notorious for a long time.This should be a risk factor every investor consider before invest in their business.Their CEO recently announced to make Vale \u201cinvestible\u201d,also strenthen their safety standard.Honestly,I am not likely to hold their stock for long-term, \u201cFool me once shame on you,fool me twice shame one me\u201d.Vale truly fooled them self twice to commence such an incident.But that ethics is not the case to be discussed here,shall we take a dive into their business.\n\nVale remain one of the biggest Iron Ore miners.After the collapse of the dam,they lost their lead to their peers Rio Tito in term of Iron Ore production.At the dawn of Covid,sending all miners into a staggering global economic.\n\nSince Iron ore reach all time high,its help sustaining a tremendously strong cash flow to balancesheet.\n\nVale own many strategic mines,I wont get too deep on reserves and grade on each ton,since this analysis mainly focus on valuation and prospect of Iron ore. Caraj\u00e1s is Vale\u00b4s biggest operation, located in the Amazon region in northern Brazil. Caraj\u00e1s\u2019s iron ore is considered the highest quality in the world,they claim on average the rocks found in Caraj\u00e1s contain 67% iron ore (the highest level on the planet).,and countless Nickel and Iron mines across China(Joint Venture),Brazil and Oman.\n\nThe key here is Vale is well-concentrated on Iron Ore while others is more diversified toward coopers and other material,this can be assumed both a blessing as well as a cursed.If Iron Ore adversely decline in price can materially affect company revenue.However,the fear for inflation as well as robust demand of commodity is undeniable,despite the effort to bring down Iron Ore in China,Iron Ore price still remain extravagant for many enterprise.As long as tension between two nations,and inflation cope with demand still risisng,I believe there are no doubt the Raw commodity price will remain expensive.\n\nThis is not the case to discuss whether there are supercylce in commodity,to keep my valuation conservative and maintaining a sensible Margin of safety leaving enough for sizable miscalculation enough not to cause a substantial gap in Price.\n\nFurthermore,I would like to mention the need for raw material for EV,Since their battery is made from various metal which include Cobalt,Nickel and Cooper,\u2026Plus in 2050,it is estimated that half of car will be electric.I remain conservative in EV since the price tag may be to expensive and the prospect of chip shortage is making the production decline.But since Nickel is also one of Vale largest production,I would also predict and project company cashflow based on conservative projection.\n\nIron Ore take up almost 85% revenue\n\n15% left are others commodity\n\nManagement planning to produce 350.000 Mt(Thousand Million Tons) of Iron ore.However,I assume only 310Mt in 2021,and slowly increase up to the next 9 years of projection\n\nI read the cost of operation,Freight cost,cost purchase from third-party and coutless other financial liability,the cost in Q1 2021 of Iron ore can be up to 50$ a ton.\n\nTo make my valuation more sensible toward future-proof,I pick up 70$ cost.\n\nAlso at the end of my valuation,we also apply 10% discount rate as well 20% Margin of safety since we may be biased.\n\nSo the Iron Ore price will be kept from 120$(despite on average should be 190$ and 170% depend on iron ore type,and it will be 0.12 in calculation) a ton,and 80$(0.08 in calculation) cost,and 10% discount rate\n\nAlso subtract another 20% from income to reflect tax\n\nIron Business\n\nDiscoun rate:10%\n\nYears 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\n\nCash Generate 12.4 12.8 13.2 13.6 14 14.4 14.8 15.2 15.6 16\n\nNPV:85.3\n\nOutstandding shares:5(they commited buy back in 2021,otherwise it should be 5.1)\n\nValue presented pershare:17.07$\n\nApplied 20% Margin of safety:13.66$ per shares\n\nI gradually increase production 10Mt each years,starting from 2021 will be 310.000Mt as mentioned above,at the end of 2030,it will be 400.000Mt,this will also apply a hedge against any shortage or below average production.\n\nHowever,my valuation is biased toward cost and price.But my main concern is cost per ton.If you apply a small changed to 80$ a ton in term of cost,the valuation immediately lower to approx 11$ a shares.another facts is I stereotyped all the iron ore prices into one,there are many types of them,vary from 160$ to 190$ depend on concetration of Fe.Please bear in mind this.\n\nNickel Business\n\nVale own 3 operations,these mine produce various grade of Nickel,The Best grade will obviously have lower operating expenses,while poorer grade Nickel will have higher operating cost\n\nNorth Atlantic Operation:3.774B\n\nPTVI:7.836B\n\nOnca Puma:7.763B\n\nThe current Nickel price is 17570$/t,from my valuation it will be deducted to 13000$(will be 1.3 in calculation),production epected to be 2.5 in calculation\n\nOperating cost will expected to be higher,7000$/ton (will be 0.7 in calculation) as i assumed to group all operation into one cost. Subtract 20% as tax\n\nDiscount rate:10%\n\nYears 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\n\nCash Generate 1.008 1.056 1.104 1.152 1.2 1.248 1.296 1.344 1.392 1.44\n\nNPV:7.3B\n\nOutstanding Shares:5\n\nValue presented pershare:1.46$\n\nApply Margin Of Safety 20%:1.17$\n\nAt first.management temp to bring Nickel production to 250Mt,but I started first at 210Mt then at the end of 2030,it will be 300Mt.\n\nTo prove my point,Vale management in company\u2019s presentation said will spend more Cash to invest in Second Furnace to boost production plus Cristalino,VBME,Cooper Cliff Mine.But I prefer apply smaller production to provide better hedge against biased calculation.\n\nCooper Business\n\nCurrently,Vale have 2 operations,Salobo which have a lower cost and Sossego which have higher expenses.Beside Cooper,they also produce gold and silver.But I take Cooper as main stream of income rather than Gold and Silver,Please bear that in mind.\n\nCurrent Cooper price sitting around 10000$/t,but I take in to account only 5000$/ton and 2000$ in cost per ton(will be presented 0.5 in term of price, and 0.2 in term of cost) and subtract 20% in term of tax\n\nVale annual production of Cooper is 250Mt,with various project to invest in capital expenditure in new mines such as: Alem\u00e3o, Salobo III,\u2026\n\nYears 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\n\nCash Generate: 0.504 0.528 0.552 0.576 0.6 0.624 0.628 0.672 0.696 0.72\n\nNPV:3.6B\n\nOutstanding shares:5\n\nValue per share :0.73$\n\nApplied 20% Margin of safety:0.58$\n\nIn total:15.7$ per shares as fair value.\n\nFianacial prospect of company\n\nFrom their recent Annual Report,their Operating Income readily to paid their financial expense is 3 times.10.843B to 3.283B respectively.already compensate already paid for 5.257B,leaving net income to 4.531B\n\nLong-term debt sitting at 13.891B,Management planning to deleverage to 10B in the near future(from company presentation)\n\nAnother positive thing to shareholder is that they paid nearly 3.327B in term of dividend to shareholder in 2020,and commited to buy back share,maximum number of 270Mil shares\n\nStrong Operating Income ,in 2020,they generate 14,322B and spend 4.43B in Capital expenditure to expand their Business,which means left 9.892B in term of Free Cash Flow.\n\nCash on hand after Financing activity and Investing activities is whooping 13.437B\n\nEnough with the green picture,let get to the real risk here.\n\nMy valuation is biased toward Iron ore production in many terms,firstly is cost,if you slight changes cost another 10$,it will left only 11$,same happen if you lower Iron Ore price.\n\nPlus havent valued asset as well ,you are overpaying for their bookvalue\n\nI havent accounted for other operation such as Gold,silver as well\n\nMy valuation is right if Cost in line with price,any fluctuation which Iron Ore drop below 120$/t will cause tremendous gap in price.\n\nSame happen with Nickel and Cooper\n\nI haven\u2019t accounted for depreciation and amortization in asset,as well as impairment of asset in the future.\n\nUltimately,company may endure another accident I dam failure again if they over cutting cost.\n\nChina may cut down production in steel,the price may crash along side with steel.\n\nAll in all,from my risk tolerance and current prospect of the world economy are being fearful toward inflation.I would love to own Vale as a part of my portfolio.\n\nIf there are any grammatical mistakes,Pardon me.\n\nHaving read this far,I am sincerely grateful for you reader to read my analysis.\n\nSincerely thank !!!\n\nSource:Company presentation from 2021,AGM,ESG\n\nCompany Quarter report as well as Annual report from 2019,2020 to 2021.",

(TSXV: JNH, OTCQB: JNHMF) (\"Jack Nathan Health\", \"JNH\" or the \"Company\"), a provider of primary care medical clinics located in Walmart\u00ae Supercentres under the Jack Nathan Health\u00ae brand announced the acquisition of a 1,394 square foot medical clinic at 1477 Island Highway, in Campbell River, British Columbia.\n\nOnce the clinic in Campbell River becomes fully integrated with Jack Nathan Health\u2019s standardized medical care services, it will become the Company\u2019s sixth corporate-owned clinic, resulting in a significant increase in revenue potential. Jack Nathan Health expects to add high-margin additional service offerings at this location in the future, enabling the Company to generate additional streams of income.\n\n\"This announcement is another reflection of our ability to execute on our growth strategy and expand our presence into all regions of Canada,\" said Mike Marchelletta, Co-founder and Interim Chief Executive Officer of Jack Nathan Health. \"Our goal is to continue converting all of our remaining licensed clinics in this country into corporate-owned medical centres for which we will be able to capture topline revenue and provide Canadians with access to standardized, high quality healthcare services.\"\n\nThe acquisition represents an advancement of Jack Nathan Health\u2019s strategic growth initiative in practice management and clinic operations. In-clinic and virtual consultations are available at this location as are a range of other services including (not limited to) Medical Walk-In Option. As with all Jack Nathan Health clinics located inside Walmart stores, patients visiting this clinic will have access to ample parking, on-site pharmacy, grocery, and other retail services.",

        "selftext": "Hello there like minded village folk. ;)\n\nI've been looking into the EV market and everyone always says you late to the party or missed the train when buying EV shares (Missing the boat with TESLA etc). Its like the California gold rush in the old times! People rushed out to make money and find gold but the real entrepreneurs made money selling them their shovels, buckets, food and clothes. Electric Vehicles need charging bays, its a  no brainier?!? SO how on gods green earth can BLNK Shares be heavily shorted to 30% and \"Experts\" say this sector should see nothing but growth! \n\nI've done some very basic DD on BLNK. I've always been quite optimistic in this space for electric vehicles and for those that dont know BLNK provides charging solutions for Electric Vehicles. As of December 2020 they had 16, 617 charging stations around the USA but they are one of the most heavily shorted stocks on the NYSE. Over 30% short interest. I would hate to know what the outstanding naked short value is. \n\nNow when you look at expected Electric vehicle sales forecasts below:\n\n*\"The US electric vehicles market is expected to reach 6.9 million unit sales by 2025, up from 1.4 million unit sales forecast for 2020\"*\n\n[https://www.spglobal.com/platts/en/market-insights/latest-news/electric-power/111920-us-ev-market-sales-to-rise-to-69-million-units-by-2025-frost-amp-sullivan](https://www.spglobal.com/platts/en/market-insights/latest-news/electric-power/111920-us-ev-market-sales-to-rise-to-69-million-units-by-2025-frost-amp-sullivan)\n\nDeloitte even say this sector will continue to boom for the next 10 years.  \"Our global *EV forecast* is for a compound annual growth rate of 29 per cent achieved over the next ten years\"\n\n[https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/focus/future-of-mobility/electric-vehicle-trends-2030.html](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/focus/future-of-mobility/electric-vehicle-trends-2030.html)\n\nAND EVEN FORBES SAYS IT!!! I know Forbes hasn't always been on our apes side for the GME battle and AMC war but they seem to contradicting what is currently going on in EV charging! \n\n[https://www.forbes.com/sites/neilwinton/2021/03/09/electric-cars-are-coming-and-if-you-dont-like-it-tough/?sh=6f8be1c5698f](https://www.forbes.com/sites/neilwinton/2021/03/09/electric-cars-are-coming-and-if-you-dont-like-it-tough/?sh=6f8be1c5698f) \n\n*\u201cWith the prospect of sticker price parity even without subsidies by  2025, we take a strong positive view on EV penetration. We raise our  global EV sales forecasts again, this time mainly driven by higher  estimates for the U.S. market. We expect the Biden administration to  increase direct support for EV purchases,\u201d the UBS report said.*\n\n*The Biden plan for 500,000 charging stations would more than double  the current count, while it could impose tougher fuel economy standards  to curb ICE car sales. The ban on ICE sales by governments like  Britain\u2019s will also give a powerful signal to buyers to embrace  electric. .\"*\n\n They also out shot analyst expectations for revenue for the previous quarter see below.\n\n## Blink Charging (NASDAQ:BLNK) Earnings Information\n\nBlink  Charging last announced its quarterly earnings data on May 12th, 2021.  The reported ($0.18) EPS for the quarter, missing analysts' consensus  estimates of ($0.17) by $0.01. **The company had revenue of $2.23 million  for the quarter, compared to analysts' expectations of $1.71 million.**  Blink Charging has generated ($0.59) earnings per share over the last  year. Blink Charging has not formally confirmed its next earnings  publication date, but the company's estimated earnings date is Thursday,  August 12th, 2021 based off prior year's report dates.\n\nSo in ending for now I cant help but wonder what the hell is going on in the EV charging scene. With all this talk about the future Being EV, Biden backing the electric F150 and international markets across the scene being so bullish. How can one stock like BLNK be so heavily shorted. I would love to know how many Naked shorts have been placed against a company like this. \n\nI'm No financial advisor nor am I calling for people to load up on BLNK to squeeze the hell out of these hedge funds and their short positions. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJust want to see if anyone else can give better insight than me on why this stock is so heavily shorted.",

        "selftext": "Good morning everyone.\n\n*This list is geared towards day trading. With the momentum watchlist especially, I am typically in and out very quickly, only occasionally longer than a couple minutes, usually faster scalps.* Always have a plan when you enter a trade (for profit taking and for taking a loss), and use proper risk management for your account.\n\n**Main Watchlist:**\n\nGapping UP: BABA, NIO, AMD, BA, UAL, CLDR, AMC\n\nGapping DOWN: XIM, CVAC, LEDS\n\n**Momentum Watchlist**\n\n* VTNR (+25%): Up on momentum from past couple days of trading, as well as another price target upgrade. Seeing good volume and price action in premarket. Could see more upwards movement today with the momentum, but I'll be cautious, as this could get over-extended.\u00a0\n* OEG (+45%): Up after announcing its recently acquired subsidiary reached an agreement for a 700-mile construction project in Mississippi. Seeing strong volume and price action at the moment, I'll be watching to see if the momentum continues.\n* LCTX (+10%): Up after reporting additional cases of retinal tissue restoration in patients treated with their drug. Seeing okay volume and price action in premarket. Daily chart looks bullish so I'll be keeping an eye on this one.\u00a0\n* AKBA (+8%):\u00a0Up after FDA set action date for their anemia drug. Seeing decent price action and volume in premarket.\u00a0\n* APOP (+13%): Couldn't find a relevant catalyst. Daily chart looks bullish, so I'll be keeping an eye on this one.\n\n**Market Outlook:**\n\nThe market is showing strength this morning, and stocks are looking to open higher after the long weekend. SPY\u00a0is trading just over 422, and we should finally see that push to new ATH. DIA\u00a0is a bit further off from ATH levels, trading just above 348. Tech stocks\u00a0are up in premarket, but lagging a bit behind the overall market. Gold\u00a0and silver are green at the moment, and crude oil is up quite a bit this morning. Bitcoin is currently trading around 36,400, and most cryptos look pretty bearish at the moment. Crypto-related stocks\u00a0are somewhat mixed in premarket trading. Marijuana stocks\u00a0are showing some strength in premarket trading and are worth following with some potential upcoming catalysts. HITID (new ticker HITI) is being uplisted to Nasdaq today, so it will be one to watch in the near future. Meme stocks\u00a0are also showing signs of continued strength, and will be worth following this week.\n\nRemember to use proper risk management, by making sure you size appropriately for your account and have a plan for every trade you enter (both for taking profits and cutting losses). Happy trading everyone :)",

ET has struggled in recent years, mainly due to the Dakota Access Pipeline (owning 36.4% interest), leading to costly delays and legal fees which in turn have weighed on its valuation. Based on the metrics and news I have investigated; I believe this stock is undervalued and could see a 100% gain within the next 6-12 months.\n\n**Price History:**\n\nEnergy Transfer started gaining attention and increase in volume throughout the year, it\u2019s low being $5.20 per share in November 2020 and its peak being $10.50 per share earlier this month. ET has gained 23.9% over the past 12 weeks with an average volume of 21,587,830. Although the price is close to the 52-week high, ET financials and growth from Q1 are impressive and suggest the stock still has much more gain. \n\n**Financials and Growth: Q1 2021**\n\nRevenue : 16,995M (up 46% from Q4 2020) Gross Profit: (up % from Q4 2020)\n\nNet Income: 3,716M (up 497% from Q4 2020)\n\nMarch 31 Distributive Cash Flow = 1,836M (up 131% from Q4 2020)\n\nMarket Cap = $26.76B\n\n\\- During the first quarter of 2021, the Partnership used cash from operations to reduce outstanding debt by approximately $3.7 billion.\n\n\\- Another recent piece of excellent news for the company was the D.C. District Court\u2019s decision to allow the Dakota Access Pipeline to remain open while the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers conducts their Environmental Impact Study. The study is expected to be completed in the Spring of 2022.\n\n**Valuation to its Peers:**\n\n**ET (Energy Transfer): $9.91/share**\n\nYoY Revenue Growth: 46%\n\nPE Ratio: 7.98 (Lowest compared to competitors)\n\nAnnual Sales: $38.95 billion (Highest sales compared to competitors)\n\nPrice / Sales: 0.69 (Bargain, trading at 0.69 times its sales, in other words, investors need to pay only 70 cents for each dollar of sales)\n\nPrice / Cash Flow: 8.50 (Middle of competitors)\n\nBook Value: $12.67 per share (Higher than actual stock price = Undervalued stock)\n\nPrice / Book: 0.78 (Bargain) \n\nDebt-to-Equity Ratio: 1.39 (Value)\n\n**KMI (Kinder Morgan Inc.): $18.34/share**\n\nYoY Revenue Growth: 103%\n\nPE Ratio: 22.64\n\nAnnual Sales: $11.70 billion\n\nPrice / Sales: 3.55\n\nPrice / Cash Flow: 9.63\n\nBook Value: $14.40 per share\n\nPrice / Book: 1.27\n\nDebt-to-Equity Ratio: 0.95\n\n**EPD (Enterprise Products Partners): $23.61/share**\n\nYoY Revenue Growth: 22%\n\nPE Ratio: 13.81\n\nAnnual Sales: $27.20 billion\n\nPrice / Sales: 1.90\n\nPrice / Cash Flow: 7.31\n\nBook Value: $11.93 per share\n\nPrice / Book: 1.98\n\nDebt-to-Equity Ratio: 1.04\n\n**WMB (Williams Cos): $26.34/share**\n\nYoY Revenue Growth: 36.5%\n\nPE Ratio: 28.02\n\nAnnual Sales: $7.72 billion\n\nPrice / Sales: 4.15\n\nPrice / Cash Flow: 9.77\n\nBook Value: $11.89 per share\n\nPrice / Book: 2.22\n\nDebt-to-Equity Ratio: 1.46\n\n**Discount:**\n\nET is trading at a 59.4% discount to its peers on a PE standpoint.\n\n**Insider Trading:**\n\nInsider Ownership Percentage: 3.28%\n\nInsider Buying (Last 12 Months): $1,956,700.00\n\nInsider Selling (Last 12 Months): $0.00\n\n**Institutional Trading:** \n\nQ1: $115M Bought / $89M Sold\n\nQ2: $490M Bought / $307M Sold\n\n**Price Target:**\n\nMy expected price target for Energy Transfer is $23-$27 range over the next 6-12months. This stock is considerably undervalued compared to its peers in a in many aspects based off the following metrics: Price / Sales,\n\nPrice / Cash Flow, Book Value, Price / Book, and Debt-to-Equity Ratio. I believe we will see Energy Transfer trading closer to its competitors in the near future, another thing I love about this stock is the dividend which is currently at 6.09%. \n\n**Extra:**\n\nWith all the talk about the infrastructure bill and injected spending, energy is expensive and although going green is the new hype, we are simply not there yet and will need to rely on fossil fuels for much of the infrastructure bill.",

The permit provides exceptions from shipping papers and employee training when shipping lithium batteries exceeds 300 Watt-Hours. The permit authorizes the exceptions based on using KULR's specially designed thermally protective packaging which incorporates the Company's patented thermal runaway shield (TRS) technology.\n\nThe permit issuance comes at a crucial time for the general public since lithium batteries used by consumers and companies such as outdoor power equipment manufacturers are increasingly larger and more energy dense, such as batteries for lawn mowers, snow blowers and power tools. These batteries require shipment for recycling when they reach end of life. Of particular interest to regulatory bodies are KULR's passive propagation resistant (PPR) design and proprietary [internal short circuit (ISC)](https://pr.report/nqcCINkH) battery safety testing technology. As a provider of [space-proven](https://pr.report/d3PsGJMi) expertise in the design, manufacturing, testing and development of innovative risk mitigation solutions to enhance lithium battery safety, KULR continues to [support](https://pr.report/Zxvz5cdM) regulatory initiatives that promote the development and safe transportation of [lithium batteries](https://pr.report/zarECgsp), especially in end of life and recycling applications.\n\n\"Sound battery design, testing and packaging play a critical role in reducing the likelihood of cells and batteries experiencing thermal events. These factors are also crucial in reducing the hazards when a cell or battery experiences a thermal event,\" said Michael Mo, CEO of KULR Technology Group. \"Our product strategy is to provide a suite of products to address the battery safety issue from testing, transportation, application, second life, and to end of life. The recent issuance of this special permit from the Department of Transportation is a continuation of that strategy. We firmly believe the rising safety regulations in the renewable energy market will be a strong catalyst for KULR's products and testing services going forward.\"\n\nThe permit, issued as [SP21139](https://pr.report/4ilaZj68), was awarded on May 28th, 2021.\n\n**About KULR Technology Group Inc.**\n\nKULR Technology Group Inc. (OTCQB: KULR) develops, manufactures and licenses next-generation carbon fiber thermal management technologies for batteries and electronic systems. Leveraging the company's roots in developing breakthrough cooling solutions for NASA space missions and backed by a strong intellectual property portfolio, KULR enables leading aerospace, electronics, energy storage, 5G infrastructure, and electric vehicle manufacturers to make their products cooler, lighter and safer for the consumer.

        "selftext": "It's a question that has been bothering me since it happened, I tried to dig some information, but didn't find anything.\n\nRecently (I believe after the acquisition of Borsa Italiana on 29th of April, the sites I know started showing wrong history of this stock's prices. For example, here is the current graph.\n\n[https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/EURONEXT-ENX/](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/EURONEXT-ENX/)\n\nTake a look at points between August 2020 and March 2021: The maximum value, according to this graph, is about 97-98, then it declines and reaches about 86 at the end of February, then falls to about 73 and is currently at 88.25 (at the moment of me writing this).\n\nHowever, if we take a look at some past screenshots/analytics/predictions (I've seen it with my own eyes, but it is anecdotic evidence, so I'm giving some proofs), so here is a link from the 6th of February\n\n[https://www.tradingview.com/chart/ENX/9d7Sy6RK-ENX-is-in-a-beautiful-uptrend-channel/](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/ENX/9d7Sy6RK-ENX-is-in-a-beautiful-uptrend-channel/)\n\nwe clearly see that the graph as a whole was 10 EUR higher.\n\nAnd it's not just this site's problem - I've just taken this as an example, feel free to look on other platforms.\n\nMy question is - what is going on? Is this deliberate or do you think it is a technical error? I find this extremely misleading, false past data may affect decisions on buying/selling stocks. I will go as far as to say that I question legitimacy of all other stocks information available.",

        "selftext": "**What is MLFB?**\n\nMLFB (Major League Football) is seeking to be the premier developmental league for the NFL.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Why they will succeed**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The business plan**\n\nThe recent ventures of the AAF and XFL have proved proof of concept as far as the interest, ticket sales, and TV viewership. MLFB is working off of their realized revenue figures but cutting expenses down from roughly $20M/week to $30M/year. They have an advantage in having a realistic expected revenue to base their spending off of. This is huge for long term success.\n\nMLFB is NOT trying to compete with the NFL but has structured everything in coordination with the NFL to best develop talent. The rules will be the same. The referees will be the same. NFL teams will have access to all of the game and practice tape and will be allowed to sign players at any point. Full seasons will run from the beginning of May through the 4th of July weekend so that players will be down in time for the start of NFL training camps. Once the NFL starts signing players from the league that do well, it will give validity to the league, increase viewership, and motivate players to be play in the league even more.\n\nThe league will be run with the same organizational structure that the MLS currently has and has been successful with. All teams will be owned by the league to ensure parody and to ensure that teams do not go bankrupt trying to outspend each other. Partial individual ownership of teams can be introduced once the league is successful as MLS has done. Players in the league will play for the team closest to their region as much as possible to save on expenses and to align former college players most closely with their old fan base. The cities in which these teams will be located are teams without a current professional major league team in any sport. This allows for a greater chance for the local fan base to be loyal and support the team through ticket sales and merchandise sales.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The people to know**\n\nFrank Murtha \u2013 CEO \u2013 Frank is a former sports agent, law professor (taught for more than 10 years Sports Labor Relations and Negotiations at Northwestern University\u2019s Graduate School), and federal financial crimes prosecutor. His work as an agent includes negotiating contracts for NFL players in the past like Olandis Gary, Al Del Greco, Akiem Hicks, etc. And in baseball, he has represented Wade Boggs, Randy Johnson, Craig Counsel, Joe Girardi, Cecil Fielder, and Bobby Thigpen.  He has the contacts in the sports industry to give this league the boost it needs.\n\nBritt Jennings \u2013 Board Member - Fund manager for The Bedrock Fund and large shareholder. More than the money investment, his time investment as a board member shows that he sees real value here. Also gives credibility to the organization because there is no reason to risk doing anything shady with such a small company with the position he has.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Catalysts**\n\nMLFB has stated in numerous filing this year that due to the pandemic, they will be following through on plans for a shortened demonstration season. As of the last filing on May 19th, \u201cthe MLFB Board of Directors also announced that they are continuing with plans to play a short Demonstration season in the summer of 2021.\u201d\n\nThis demonstration season has a high likelihood of being played between the conclusion of The Spring League and the beginning of the NFL preseason which would correlate to the end of June through beginning of August. This means that another filing and PR with details of the season should be expected within the next week or so.\n\nIn January, hope of this announcement around the Superbowl pushed the stock price to just under .07. The actual announcement should send the price many multiples higher.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Valuation**\n\nMLFB currently holds a $12M valuation. Projected revenue for year 1 is roughly $20M. MLS teams (same organizational structure as MLFB) trade at 7x revenue. That alone puts year 1 value at $140M (11-12x of current value). Factor in the high upside potential and the fact that every fan will want to own stock in the league they are watching on TV and this could fly much higher than expected by this time next year. It is difficult to accurately predict how big of a factor this could be as no other league has ever been launched with a large number of public shareholders already invested as fans to promote the league and encourage others to watch.\n\nCurrent share price is .03 and I am expecting .15-.25 off of initial PR with .50 by end of July. Details of the TV contract, coverage by major sports networks and publications, and the meme-ability of a football stock leave the upside potential with an enormous roof. \n\nIt is important to note that in the last filing, warrants were given to 14 key employees and consultants at a price of .07 showing the faith of insiders to surpass this price.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Links:**\n\nFor ongoing DD and updates, there is a dedicated sub that is updated regularly.\n\nTo get up to the minute SEC filing updates go here:\n\nGo to http://www.mlfb.com and click \u201cfollow MLFB\u201d to be emailed with any SEC filings or official PR\n\nAbout 30 minutes in they start talking about MLFB:\n\nhttps://xflnewsroom.com/podcast/what-to-know-about-major-league-football-mlfb-featuring-josh-davis/\n\nhttp://investingbulletin.com/2020/12/major-league-football-inc-otcmlfb-announces-preparations-for-a-2021-season-with-training-camp-in-florida-headquarters/\n\nHow does MLFB compare with XFL and CFL?\n\nhttps://xflnewshub.com/xfl-news/major-league-football-mlfb-announces-plans-for-spring-2021-season/\n\nFrank\u2019s interview in 2015 about dealing with high pressure situations.\n\nhttps://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/cubs/ct-steve-bartman-20151010-story.html\n\nhttps://pigskinnut.com/xfl-decision-to-play-in-2022-leaves-door-open-for-the-mlfb/\n\nhttps://dd7pmep5szm19.cloudfront.net/2245/0001640334-20-001884.htm\n\nhttps://www.buffalobills.com/audio/frank-murtha-mlfb-professional-spring-football-16841044\n\nhttps://talkingotc.com/https-www-talkingotc-com-blog-google-com-pub-4421096629830534-direct-f08c47fec0942fa0/post/114066/mlfb-major-league-football-2021\n\nhttps://www.thescore.com/xfl/news/1921673/the-dream-that-wont-die-will-a-new-alternative-football-league-ever-last\n\nhttps://talkingotc.com/https-www-talkingotc-com-blog-google-com-pub-4421096629830534-direct-f08c47fec0942fa0/post/120351/mlfb-major-league-football\n\nhttps://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2019/07/08/former-arena-league-commissioner-buys-aaf-equipment-at-auction/\n\nDisclaimer that stocks go up and down and you need to do your own research and not trust a random person on the internet.
