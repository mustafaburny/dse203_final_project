        "selftext": "I've got 5 $AMD $35 June 2021 contracts that had already gone deep ITM that was purchased back in April. They're currently worth $5,288. I'm looking to sell those and repurchase a couple of cheaper contracts further dated such as January 2022. I'm extremely bullish on $AMD but with some planned caveats:\n\n1. $AMD will not have too many catalysts in the next two months until the release of their new CPUs, GPUs, and gaming consoles. Thus, $AMD share price will likely level out in the next few weeks, possibly move up slightly in the low $90s.\n2. Once the news start rolling in regarding product reviews and third party sales numbers, it'll lead to share price speculation and then eventually next year post-holidays will confirm whether there will be success. As such, share price will soar to new all time highs. I'm predicting for it to reach a minimum of $100.\n\nWith these assumptions in place, I'm looking at selling all 5 contracts for an approximate $26,440 total. and then using that capital for some new strategies:\n\n1. Don't sell contracts now to take advantage of low theta decay (currently @ -0.007). Keep it all the way until next year May (month before expiration) to take advantage of long term capital gains savings. I'd be saving approximately 7% in tax losses but theta is going to eat away gains here.\n2. Simply move up / roll out by purchasing 7 $AMD $60 January 2022 contracts @ $3,643 for an $25,500. Delta is at .80 and theta is at -.016. I typically negate theta by selling 30-45 DTE OTM calls.\n3. Purchase 10 $AMD $80 January 2022 contracts @ $2,663 for an approximate total of $26,630 (I'll fork over the extra $200 to make it happen). Theta decay is at an aggressive -0.02 and as per my usual strategy, I can negate this by selling 30-45 DTE OTM calls.\n4. Go synthetically long by going to January 2022 and selling 3 contracts of near ATM $90 puts for $2,550 credit and buying $90 calls for $2,245 debit. This leaves me about $900 credit across 3 contracts. However, I need to hold $27,000 as collateral for the whole period of time.\n5. Go synthetically long with a slight twist / risk still with January 2022 expiry. Sell $110 ITM put for $3,900 credit. Buy $60 ITM call for $3,643. Total credit of $2.58 with $22,000 as collateral. This is probably the stupidest play ever but other than the assignment risk, I can't figure out why it would be stupid. \n6. Do a ZEBRA (zero extrinsic back ratio strategy) trade by going short 1 OTM call @ .70 delta and 2 ITM Call @ .50 delta. However, this doesn't seem to work with LEAP calls, only short term calls at 45\\~ DTE. I think this would work quite well in the next few months.\n\nWith that said, I think for the next few months, I could apply strategies 1, 4, and 6. Before the holidays, switch over to strategies 2, 3, and 5. The goal is to preserve gains in the short term and aggressively gain in the long term.\n\nAny thoughts?",

        "selftext": "This is a list of the top 20 companies that experienced the largest change in insider shares in the last seven (7) days.\nThe SEC defines an insider as any officer, director or 10% shareholder. It is not illegal for these people to buy or sell their own shares.\nIn fact, since most of them get paid in stock options, it is expected. However, it is illegal for them to trade on inside information\nthat has not been made public. So for example if there are drug trial results that are bad and not public,\ninsiders cannot dump shares. That said, many people have observed that insiders - in general - seem to have a good\ntrack record at timing their purchases.  All trades that are marked as part of a 10b5 plan are excluded from this report.\n\n## Largest Insider Buying (Last 7 Days)\nCompany|Count|Shares Changed|Avg.
