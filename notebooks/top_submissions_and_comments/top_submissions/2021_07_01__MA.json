        "selftext": "Chinese  stocks, especially tech stocks now has unprecedented policy /  regulation risk. BABA's anti-trust investigation was met with little  resistance from BABA. Jack Ma and BABA pretty much admitted guilt and  gladly paid whatever fine to get over it. A similar anti-trust case in  US will be met with fierce resistance from big corporations and  litigation will last for years or maybe decades. Just think about  Microsoft, AAPL, and FB's anti-trust cases.\n\nAlso DIDI, the rumor that Chinese government is going to give them unprecedented punishment dropped their stock 20% today.\n\nOvernight  while all tards are sleeping tightly in the freedom country, Bloomberg  reported that Chinese government is planning to turn education, online  tutoring sector into **nonprofit** dropped the entire Chinese education section by 50% - 60%. RIP for any of the EDU and  TAL bagholders...\n\nWell,  the scary thing is the public opinion in China always align with what  the Chinese government wants to do. If you have friends in China, look  up their comments on WeChat or WeiBo, they are cheering for turning  education sector into non-profit.\n\nThe  honeymoon with Chinese tech stocks are way over and the price Chinese  stocks, even now for some, had priced in a friendly, laissez faire  regulation and CONTROL from the Chinese government.\n\nIt  might be the time to be greedy while the market is fearful. Chinese  market is huge and with tons of growth potential for anything and  everything. But maybe in the short-term until this muddy policy /  attitude shift is over, it's better to stay away from the Chinese stock  to not have that gut wrenching feeling when one of your holding is  dropped 50% overnight without fundamental change in its business.",

        "selftext": "# INTRO - I have a feeling this week is going to be another good week for the major indices and tech. I do believe most inflation fears are priced in, have been for some time, and for the most part this is an ordinary summer. The 10 year bond has dropped right around 1.35% which will indicate what sectors we should be investing in. It seems like the lower it goes, the better tech and growth do. Traditionally cheaper money benefits these companies that carry a lot of paper. I'm not expecting any major changes on this front. Yet, I am getting ready to take profits on longer term positions and move somethings around in preparation for a bigger dip in September or August that I've been writing about for some time now.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TODAY** \\- Good start to the week as the markets across the board set fresh all time highs! My portfolio is up over $10k. \n\nYear-to-date gains in the S&amp;P and NASDAQ are at 18% and 15% respectively and even though I am expecting a pull back after the summer, there is still more room to run towards the end of the year.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qyshhp5qhva71.png?width=1121&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3083deb40b7fda498d29d0a0210c0fae1727e8f2\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nI do think that $**AAPL** will pull back, unfortunately for my LEAPS, however if it does getting into another position closer to the 180 MA is beneficial. There is no real guarantee that **AAPL** will recede all the way back down, giving up all the gains from the last couple weeks, however September is usually a horrible month for **AAPL**. In case, I will be prepared.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2hueebk7gva71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=041dbab8f67ee16ac8a4f70f33077a0da02f66fe\n\nNext on the list of new alerts is $**ROKU**. I am not that bullish on **ROKU** and agree with Morgan Stanley giving it a sell rating. If it does rise up to the resistance trend line, it will be almost all time high. I like puts at this point.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zluyryg9gva71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=438bd1a0b0657f12fa519bbfcca854a7037cf609\n\n **MSFT,** like AAPL, has ran up a great bit the last few weeks. Currently most indicators are showing levels of over bought. I don't want to buy puts or short **MSFT**, but if it does pull back toward the support, which it has bounce many times before, I'm a buyer.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/eizxl02bgva71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dafe6828303bbb45e245d62ce41b5e3b96fddebc\n\n \n\n$**X** is an interesting play that I would consider pretty safe. Of course everyone has heard of lumber and the inflation that is kicking up prices. Housing prices are skyrocketing around the country and possible rents will be too. If **X** can pull back to the 180 MA I believe that is a very good level of support to buy at. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8gfx26ocgva71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e1182f1a0fe2cb4c0b178b0c7d12dced37615662\n\n**ArcelorMittal,** together with its subsidiaries, owns and operates steel manufacturing and mining facilities in Europe, North and South America, Asia, and Africa. This is another steel and mining play for me. Over the past 10 years August has been the worst month of the year for $**MT**. I'll wait for a dip and hopefully buy mid to long term calls around the strong support, and if that breaks maybe the 180ma.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zj34ylcegva71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8a5bfcef576a2b806338bcb9c02450be11de0a50\n\n**Vertiv Holdings Co**, together with its subsidiaries, designs, manufactures, and services critical digital infrastructure technologies and life cycle services for data centers, communication networks, and commercial and industrial environments in the Americas, the Asia Pacific, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. $**VRT** is essentially a data center and tech infrastructure play that I believe is overbought currently. **VRT** seems to be riding up towards the key resistance that it cant seem to cross, dating back to last year, 2020. I prefer puts here and take profit around the 50ma.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zsypjnrfgva71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f33a77fe41d1a3e7dbd7dd023eb713799d92c732\n\n $**AI** is a company that, you guessed it, develops AI products. I think the ticker is really, really cool, but that's about it. I believe most of the hype probably comes from that and we can see that it sold off enormously earlier this year. Once it is up to the resistance, let's play puts back down to the big volume shelf that is providing support.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8mcbb9zggva71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=77e515bbde6d723ae5393c1744951a6cf5198818\n\n $**TNA** is a leveraged 3X ETF that follows the Russell 2000 small cap index. Small caps are more risky that large caps, of course, but usually out perform them as well. I would like to add this to my portfolio, most likely, in September to set up for a run into the holiday months. Shares are fine with me since it is leveraged.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m2yx6z0igva71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0e335354f9e074313436e30d2ad0e0a28f955aaf\n\n $**BIDU** alert that triggered late Friday. If $**BIDU** continues an upward push, through the support, I'll pick up some calls a couple months out. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lwtjr5njgva71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9bbe7a38958435b63b0b7ceb1e43d8bd514936bd\n\n $**COIN** is my favorite BTC/Crypto stock play. It is the most reliable and regulated crypto exchange in the US. I think all the institutional investors will be using **COIN** for crypto exposure. I also don't think that the stock price should follow that of BTC. Even if BTC is down for the month, there is still selling volume taking place on **Coinbase**, there fore incoming revenue. Overall, I like this stock. If it pulls back to the MA, I think its a good entry and addition to your portfolio if you want crypto exposure.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ymaldxhlgva71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=289f1e4d9130c1134ea952d51fa06158bd9c0d54\n\n If you are like me and waiting of a bigger pull back/correction before situating your portfolio for a bigger run toward the end of 2021, I'll be taking profits in some of my positions and needing a place to park the money in the interim. I've identified a few that could be good for this. First is **VTV,** Vanguard Value ETF. It is a ETF that is focused on Value stock play and has a Dividend yield of more than 2%. It is usually considered a 'safe' place to park money. Some top holdings include, BERK, JPM, XOM, JNJ, UNH, and PG.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2dcxclpmgva71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=03de8f2f07a832d6042fbbff5c6b5298ad3438b0\n\n Another one is **SCHD**, also has a Dividend yield of over 2%. Some of Schwab Div Yields top holdings are MRK, TXN, HD, PEP, and VZ.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f5o5q8nngva71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f597984b4adabd4f6417c313c57576644024f6ee\n\n Another interesting addition to your portfolio could be **XHB**. It is a homebuilders ETF. There has been huge demand for new SF homes in the US, and **XHB** and NAIL have done very well this year with the inflation trade. I don't expect demand to considerably change anytime soon. I always buy on support, so patience is key until **XHB** pulls back a little bit more.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g8vck4xogva71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b9dd3c23232ccdc439a93b7dd9f2d20c7a808955\n\n **DIS** just released Black Widow and did very very well this weekend. Overall I like what the company is doing with **Disney**\\+ and in Shanghai they are raising the ticket prices for the newest Disney theme park. Be careful when buying this for two reasons. One, a lot of good news could already be priced in - and probably is. Two, August through October have been horrible months for **DIS** over the past 10 years. If you are a **DIS** bull, buying on the 180MA is your best bet for now.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6lorao9qgva71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3dc8230c7f288c8d06b14df0d824a8b18bb69346\n\n \n\n**$TASK** provides outsourcing services to Internet companies worldwide. It offers digital customer experience that consists of omni-channel customer care services primarily delivered through digital channels; and other solutions, including customer care services for new product or market launches, trust and safety solutions, and customer acquisition solutions.\n\nAll of the major analysts, except Morgan Stanley have a 'buy' rating for the stock. I personally like their vision and what they are doing. Their IPO wasn't long ago and there isn't much data out so far, however I think there is upside toward $40+. Currently I want to buy commons sub $30 if the opportunity comes, or sell puts if options are enabled on Webull. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8nyyk4gxgva71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=34c0a89f71fe2bc1ecd0fb7aad3ddd8bd81e7574\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n# Current Weekly Positions\n\n$NAIL \\-6.8% (Ongoing Swing Trade)\n\n$DIDI \\+$550 Sell $10.5p (+45%) (Ongoing)\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nDisclaimer: The comments opinions and analysis expressed herein are for informational and educational purpose only and should not be considered as individual advice or recommendations.",

        "selftext": "Coinbase ($COIN) will be a cash cow for years to come.\n\nIn Q1 alone they had $1.8B of revenue and $771M of profit (\\~43% margins). Q2 earnings are coming up the 8/20 expiry is looking juicy. My guess is that with an extremely volatile quarter for internet money, they will blow Q1 out of the water and we'll be above $300 by the end of July.\n\n**This is what I like about the stock:**\n\n1. Their trading commissions blow traditional brokerage houses out of the water\n2. Bid/ask spreads are wider than Strahan's gap tooth\n3. Fees are fat (and scale with transaction size)\n4. They just [unveiled](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-25/coinbase-expands-prime-brokerage-services-to-institutional-users) an institutional \"Prime\" service on 5/25 catering to corporations looking to diversify their balance sheets\n5. In addition to the \"exchange\" business, they're now lending, offering debit/credit card products, and soon will allow you to generate passive income by \"staking\" your assets (FYI this bullet alone encompasses the entire banking industry, Visa, Mastercard, JPM, BAML, etc.)\n6. Despite the big internet money dump, the key driver to trading activity is VOLATILITY - which causes lots of buying/selling, and we definitely had that in Q2\n\nTheir total addressable market is also massive and faux asset / internet money adoption is beating the trend of the *internet* when it came out.\n\n**This is what I hate about this stock:**\n\n1. There's an existential threat of fake assets flaming out like in 2017, even though this seems less likely with each passing day as more and more institutions hold internet money on their balance sheets and incorporate it into their remittance / payments infrastructure\n2. It's weird that Sat-oshi is unknown and still holds $35B of the core asset, making him the greatest hero but also the greatest threat if he/she/they/zir were to dump\n\nSo it's not necessarily a slam dunk but I'm betting fake assets continue to evolve from meme dog coins to real utility providers in the DeFi ecosystem. Also, this an ancillary business to the trading / brokerage side of the house: which is displacing business from Fidelity, Charles Schwab, CBOE, stock exchanges, etc. as people go digital.\n\nIn my opinion, DeFi is going to completely disrupt the banking system, and CB can take a leading role in monetizing that ecosystem. It simply doesn't make sense to store cash deposits yielding 0.01% at Chase when you can be earning 7-10% on cash in stable coins.\n\nTLDR: 7/16 250c's and 8/20 300c's\n\nOppenheimer [raises $COIN PT](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwig2_mfyNvxAhWYVc0KHTSoAjEQFnoECBcQAA&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Ffinance.yahoo.com%2Fnews%2Foppenheimer-more-bullish-coinbase-151305656.html&amp;usg=AOvVaw1zFv8zwtd97D8KzLc33yk4) to $444\n\n2Q ER is August 12th\n\nClosing price 7/9: $253.88\n\n52W High: $429.54\n\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80",

        "selftext": "Starting with the obvious - NKLA is a fraud and is absolutely nothing more than a smoke and mirrors show. Let's take a look at the indictment on Trevor Milton:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\" 1)  Federal prosecutors accused Milton, who resigned as chairman in September, of making deceptive and false claims regarding \u201c**nearly all aspects of the business,**\u201d \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2)  Prosecutors say that when Milton unveiled their tractor trailer truck it had to be plugged into the wall, the headlamps were activated by remote by a staffer, and air had to be pumped in because there was a slow leak in the air lines of the truck;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n3)  Prosecutors do say part of Milton's conduct was video of the Nikola truck in the Super Bowl ad was not in fact of a working truck but was towed to the top of a hill. Breaks were released and it rolled downhill. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n4)  Prosecutors say in February of 2020 Milton made statements that his pickup truck -- called the Badger -- would be built with its own parts and frames.  Meanwhile they were using Ford F-150 trucks for chassis and frames on their prototypes \"\n\n(From Tom Winters NBC news on Twitter)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, not only NKLA used parts from other automakers but couldn't even make a working prototype. It had to be plugged to a fucking wall. Who's backing them now and partner after this? EV competitive landscape just keeps increasing and there isn't shortage of startups to partner.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo with no revenue, no product, a fraud indictment of the founder, I'm afraid NKLA  is nothing more but what's on the balance sheet:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n$760M of cash\n\n$120M of PPE\n\nminus $70M of liabilities\n\nTotal $810M as of Q1\n\nDuring Q2 the company raised $300M from Tumin, invested $50M in an hydrogen biz and assuming the same cash burn rate of $85M, total cash stands at \\~$1billion.\n\nCash burn is $240M for the last twelves months - which is not a lot - but that doesn't include stock based compensation of $200M. So either NKLA does another capital raise - and it will be dillutive as hell in the current environment - or they have some sort of breakthrough - which would actually be a first. Current market cap is $5bn. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTechnicals also point towards a massive decrease in share price:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[One thing NKLA can do is lower lows](https://preview.redd.it/q9r4jtttn5e71.png?width=2387&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f1cf3560d92719dc3a8be8a4dda00a044b0e3c6a)\n\nA close-up: double top (lower high) at $19.54 marking the new downtrend. Currently below all MA and RSI with room to go deeper.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4sqevssgo5e71.png?width=2427&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eae7e1876d63bb44fc38a506c80a9fd576419a51\n\nWhat about insider buying?

I'm sure I'm not gonna be the only one seeing it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR - NKLA on it's way to fair book value of $2.50.

Would love to hear other people's system as well!*\n\nHello friends!\n\nYou may know me as the guy who writes the Daily Market Recaps on here. Today, I wanted to share a small article I wrote about trading systems. I remember when I was first getting started in the market and beginning my education, I would always hear people say \"you need a trading system in order to be successful\", but didn't know what that meant or how to get started. Fast forward a few years, I have been blessed enough to make a living as a trader and investor, so I wanted to share some of the things I have learned.\n\nBasically, a trading system is a set of parameters designed to remove as much emotion from trading as possible (can't count how many mistakes I have made by getting too emotional during a trade). Today I wanted to share a very simple swing-trading system I use that only uses two indicators: Fibonacci retracements and moving averages (50, 200-day)\n\n**Enter the trade with a plan** \\- Before we enter any swing trade, we use technical analysis to find entry levels, price targets, and stop losses. Entering a trade without a plan leaves you ill-prepared to both profit if the trade works or cut your losses before the bag becomes too heavy.\n\n**Find High Probability Entry Using Technical Analysis** \\- As discussed above, I technical analysis to determine high probability levels of entry during a pullback. As a rule of thumb, always wait for confirmation that a support holds before entering a trade. I want to see either the stock bounce off the support with conviction or begin to consolidate, forming a new base near the new support.\n\n* In an uptrend, the 50 day moving average (MA) or 23.6% and 38.2%  Fibonacci retracement are usually strong supports\n* In a downtrend, the 200MA or 50% and 61.8% Fibonacci retracement are usually strong supports\n* If a stock breaks below all these supports, wait for it to establish a new base for itself. The 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level and 200MA are the last lines of defense, do not try and catch a falling knife. Wait for the stock to begin building a new base, patience is key.\n\n**Adhere to a 2:1 Risk/Reward ratio** \\- When entering a trade, always make sure the reward is at least double the potential risk. This way, the profit from winners is always bigger than the potential loss from the losers. I do this by setting the stop loss at 50% of the potential profit we are targeting. For example, if I am targeting a 10% gain from a trade, the stop loss will be set 5% below entry. Of course, not all trades will work out but in this way, we maximize our wins while minimizing our losses\n\n**Stick to your Stop Losses** \\-  In trading stop losses are your friend. They protect your capital in case the trade goes sour. Even the best trader\u2019s in the world don\u2019t get it right anytime, protecting your capital is very important. While it might be tempting to \u201cdiamond hand\u201d and wait for recovery, the goal of trading is not to become an investor. Cut your losses quickly before they become unmanageable and move on. There is opportunity every day in the market.\n\n**If the trade works out, set stops to entry** \\- If the trade starts working out, it is very important to then raise your stop loss and set it at your original entry price. This guarantees the trade will become risk-free, meaning you will either profit or, worst-case scenario, break even. If the trade is really working out and is up a good amount from entry, I will keep raising the stop loss to protect the profit. While trading, it is imperative never to let your gains become losses, at the worst we want to walk away from a trade breaking even.",

        "selftext": "Hello everyone,\n\nfinally I'm blesssed with the opportunity to afford investing $1000 per month. This opportunity has been here for around 5-6 months. But I have the issue of not being able to decide where to invest this money.  Everytime I set up a savings plan in my brokerage account, I start hesitating and cancel it  a few weeks later.\n\nMy troubled thoughts:\n\n1.Any WORLD ETF: \"Hmm, maybe I'm too diversified and won't profit much more than the average investor. Additionally, this might be boring, because everybody else is doing it.\". \n\n2.S&amp;P 500 ETF: everytime I set up a savings plan for this ETF, I start thinking \"Hmm, investing only in the US would make me miss on other opportunities worldwide\". Cancelling.\n\n3.Any actively managed fund: \"Hmm, they've outperformed the market in the last 5-10 years, what's the guarantee that they will manage this in the future? Additionally, I don't want to give them my money, I can pick up the stocks myself\". Cancelling.\n\n4.Picking stocks by miyself: \"Hmm, SQ, MASTERCARD, MSFT and ALPHABET are amazing. But what IF they stop being amazing or what if I miss on other great picks? Cancelling.\n\n5.Back to step 1. And it goes on like this for 6 months already.\n\nHow to \"solve\" this problem? How could I be at rest finally? I WANT to invest $1000 monthly, but keep overthinking every possible choice.\n\nHave you ever been in a similar situation? What would you do?",

Blake Moore violated federal transparency law by failing to properly disclose stock transactions worth up to $1.1 million - newsbinding](https://newsbinding.com/banking/republican-rep-blake-moore-violated-federal-transparency-law-by-failing-to-properly-disclose-stock-transactions-worth-up-to-1-1-million/)\n\n[**newsbinding**](https://newsbinding.com/author/bnp-news-team/)  **July27,2021**\n\n* The Utah congressman filed more than 70 of his stock disclosures weeks or months late.\n* He\u2019s a member of the House Armed Services Committee and invested in defense contractor Raytheon.\n* Moore also invested in Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba despite his criticism of China.\n\nMembers of Congress routinely trade stocks, buying and selling shares of companies that often have significant business before the federal government \u2014 and sometimes spend a lot of money to lobby lawmakers.\n\nEach week, Insider digs through congressional financial-disclosure records and asks lawmakers questions about their personal finances. Here are the latest highlights from what we\u2019ve discovered.\n\nUtah congressman violates STOCK Act\n\nFreshman Rep. **Blake Moore**, a Republican from Utah, failed to properly disclose dozens of stock and stock-option trades together worth at least $70,000 and as much as $1.1 million, according to an Insider analysis of [newly filed congressional records](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21015534-rep-blake-moore-disclosure).\n\nMoore was weeks or months late in disclosing more than 70 separate trades he made between mid-January and mid-May. US House lawmakers violate the [STOCK Act](https://www.congress.gov/112/plaws/publ105/PLAW-112publ105.pdf)\u2018s transparency provision if they don\u2019t formally disclose a trade in a certified report to the clerk of the House of Representatives within 45 days of a stock trade.\n\nMoore\u2019s tardy trade disclosures include seven transactions involving stock or stock-option purchases and sales of Alibaba Group Holding Limited, a Chinese e-commerce company with [reported ties](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-alibaba-government/alibaba-is-the-force-behind-hit-chinese-communist-party-app-sources-idUSKCN1Q70Y7) to the Chinese Communist Party, including the [creation](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/chinese-app-on-xis-ideology-allows-data-access-to-100-million-users-phones-report-says/2019/10/11/2d53bbae-eb4d-11e9-bafb-da248f8d5734_story.html) of a propaganda app. Alibaba [shares are down](https://markets.businessinsider.com/stocks/baba-stock) from highs this year in February.\n\nThe congressman is an outspoken critic of China\u2019s government. In a March [opinion article](https://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/foreign-policy/545477-confronting-made-in-china-is-crucial-to-americas) published in The Hill, Moore wrote that the Chinese Communist Party is a \u201cstrategic adversary\u201d that is \u201cchallenging our political, economic, industrial, and educational systems\u201d and \u201cexpertly subverts the international rules-based order.\u201d\n\nIn four separate purchases from February to May, Moore also bought up to $60,000 worth of stock shares in Raytheon Technologies Corporation, a major [US government defense contractor](https://www.businessinsider.com/ratheyon-fears-biden-cancel-arms-sale-to-saudi-arabia-2021-1) that produces missile systems, weapons platforms, and sensors, among other military products. Raytheon stock has [steadily increased](https://markets.businessinsider.com/stocks/rtx-stock) in value this year.\n\nMoore is a [member](https://blakemoore.house.gov/about/committees-and-caucuses) of the House Committee on Armed Services, which has jurisdiction over US military affairs. He is also a member of several military-related congressional caucuses, including the F-35 Caucus, Hypersonics Caucus, Military Depot and Industrial Facilities Caucus, National Guard Caucus, and Navy and Marine Corps Caucus.\u00a0\n\nIn a statement to Insider, Moore\u2019s office acknowledged the late filings and said Moore has already consulted the House Committee on Ethics and paid a fine \u2014 it did not say how much \u2014 for filing late. Fines for a first-time STOCK Act violator begin at $200.\n\nMoore\u2019s office said that the congressman earlier this year transferred funds from a 401(k) retirement account to a financial-management firm in Utah that now buys and sells \u201ccommonly traded stocks on his behalf.\u201d The firm, which Moore\u2019s office did not name, \u201ctrained a compliance advisor to submit reports on trades, and a system has now been set up to ensure that periodic transaction reports are filed on time,\u201d the statement said.\n\n\u201cUpon entering Congress, Congressman Moore made an intentional effort to learn the new financial requirements and simplify and consolidate his financial investments,\u201d the statement reads. \u201cNow that Congressman Moore has fully established a financial compliance process with his firm and the Ethics Committee, he will continue to ensure all future filing deadlines are met in accordance with Ethics rules.\u201d\n\nMoore\u2019s office did not answer Insider\u2019s questions about why the lawmaker personally invests in Alibaba and Raytheon and whether he gives his financial-management company direction \u2014 and if so, to what degree \u2014 on the kinds of investments it should make.\n\nMoore\u2019s office also did not say whether the congressman and his staff completed required congressional ethics training where financial-disclosure rules are routinely covered.\u00a0\n\nOfficials for the House Ethics Committee declined to comment.\n\nMembers of Congress are required to report stock-trade values only in broad ranges. All of Moore\u2019s reported trades fell within the range of $1,001 to $15,000.\n\nOther stocks or stock options that Moore bought or sold this year include those of the Google parent company Alphabet Inc., Amazon.com Inc., American Express Company, Apple Inc., Bank of America Corp., Berkshire Hathaway Inc., Dollar General Corp., Facebook Inc., the health savings account company HealthEquity Inc., the pharmaceutical company Johnson &amp; Johnson, Mastercard Inc., Microsoft Corp., and the computer chip and systems company Nvidia Corp.\n\nSeveral other members of Congress have this year run into trouble disclosing various stock trades as federal law requires.\u00a0\n\nThey include Sen. [**Dianne Feinstein**](https://www.businessinsider.com/dianne-feinstein-senate-california-stock-purchase-disclosure-2021-1), a Democrat of California; Rep. [**Tom Malinowski**](https://www.businessinsider.com/tom-malinowski-stock-trades-congress-transparency-new-jersey-2021-3), a Democrat of New Jersey; Rep. [**Pat Fallon**](https://www.businessinsider.com/pat-fallon-congress-texas-stock-trades-boeing-2021-6), a Republican of Texas; and [**Sean Patrick Maloney**](https://www.businessinsider.com/sean-patrick-maloney-dccc-congress-stock-sale-ethics-complaint-2021-4), a Democrat of New York.\u00a0\n\nFormer Rep. **Harley Rouda**, a Democrat of California who\u2019s attempting a comeback, also [failed to properly disclose](https://www.businessinsider.com/transparency-group-files-complaint-against-harley-rouda-for-tardy-disclosures-2021-7) stock trades.\n\nSen. [**Elizabeth Warren**](https://www.businessinsider.com/elizabeth-warren-ban-congress-trading-stocks-investing-tom-malinowski-nhofe-2021-5), a Massachusetts Democrat, and Rep. [**Pramila Jayapal**](https://www.businessinsider.com/pramila-jayapal-washington-elizabeth-warren-stock-ban-congress-2021-6), a Washington Democrat, told Insider they\u2019ll soon introduce companion legislation barring members of Congress from trading individual stocks.\u00a0\n\nBut other similar efforts have failed in recent years, most notably in 2012, when the [STOCK Act](https://www.cnn.com/2012/04/04/politics/stock-act-signing/index.html), which established current congressional stock-disclosure rules, did not outright prohibit members from trading stocks.\n\nMoore\u2019s office did not answer a question about whether the congressmen would support or oppose such legislation.",

Almost 90% from the top 250 companies.\n* S&amp;P500 adds and removes companies all the time. If a company is performing poorly and finds a company that is doing well over the past few quarters, it will consider swapping them.\n* Valuations in these companies don't reflect what's going on the economy. All indices are near record highs yet there's a lot going on in the economy (unemployment, inflation, real estate, etc.) that at any moment could create FUD.\n* Stock picking isn't easy. It's a lot more difficult to find the losers than to pick the winners. Make sure you have a strategy. Reddit is known for choosing small caps. If you're going to invest in small caps, don't let emotion get to you. They usually see wild swings 10-20% days up and down.\n* Hopefully some insight what the overall market looks like. Large caps are carrying the market, we're at all-time highs, and earnings are coming up. Expect some profit taking next week and the weeks after during earnings season.\n\nHope ya'll find this useful. Good luck to all.",

Investors include Uber which has 12.5% stake in $DIDI ([https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/23/uber-lost-2-billion-in-didi-stake-this-week-on-china-crackdown-threat.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/23/uber-lost-2-billion-in-didi-stake-this-week-on-china-crackdown-threat.html)). It\u2019s IPO in the US markets was an immense failure. It reached a high of $16 within this month before being pummeled to around $8 by threats from the Chinese government and bans  from app stores \n\n([https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonathanponciano/2021/07/04/china-bans-didi-from-app-stores-just-days-after-massive-us-ipo/?sh=23d571231202](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonathanponciano/2021/07/04/china-bans-didi-from-app-stores-just-days-after-massive-us-ipo/?sh=23d571231202)).\n\nI think this godsend for a good asymmetric return via call options. This company is going nowhere. It is China\u2019s largest ride sharing company. China is a smart country that wants to grow its industries while keeping the CEO\u2019s in line. This is a power move by China and DIDI will make concessions to the communist government and the stock will rocket to its price target of \\~$25 by Q4 2024. My hypothesis is based on China\u2019s power move with Jack Ma and Alibaba. They paid their $2.8 Billion fine and now they are back to signing record deals\n\n([https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-30/alibaba-nears-first-big-deal-since-record-antitrust-fine](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-30/alibaba-nears-first-big-deal-since-record-antitrust-fine))\n\n$BABA is currently trading around $206\n\nI believe $7-8 is the bottom for this sell off. I expect to see a rapid return to \\~15-16 in the next few weeks.\n\n**Recommendation 1:**\n\n$DIDI 11/19/2021 15.00 C\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**PART 2: $REE**\n\n[Figure 2.

        "selftext": "Greetings retards, autists and apes. Here to share my outlook and some very simple TA in way too many words that you don't know how to read which may have already been invalidated in after hours trading with the vanilla NFLX news. This is a fictional account and not investment advice.\n\n# Preface\n\nToday is Wednesday July 14th, 2021. As you can see, GME has been selling off on very low volume and really accelerated today, along with many other caca stocks that are starting to make their way back down to hell after a nice consolation bounce out of the May lows. Many will break May lows and never recover, FYI.\n\nGME is special, though, as it is the Queen of caca stocks standing steadfast beside King TSLA who retired from greatness after the SPX add and has a date with 400. For both, many would say they are not caca and have fundamental upside. Maybe they do, maybe they don't. What we do know is GME low float, high SI and is subject to gamma squeezes (helped by short covering) and that is what we are looking for come August to September as we watch for a pattern to repeat itself.\n\n# Where we are at\n\nToday just before close, GME found a potential bottom at 165 with huge volume which is peculiarly right where we have several supports: \n\n7) The positive trendline running from the extremely bullish engulfing candle just after the earnings gap down in March to the beginning of the breakout in May heading into Q2 ER. \n\n2) The all-time-highs AVWAP which basically encapsulates the average of volume and price since the day GME sent Gabe home crying. Like moving averages, above is bullish ( \ud83d\ude80 ) and below it is bearish (\ud83c\udf08). \n\n4) Thicc volume shelves from $100-150 where most volume has traded since January, indicating where traders have been interested in buying in the past, and where those who sold at highs or missed the boat the first time may find value in entering.\n\n6) 151 is a pivotal level related to some gamma/greek mysticism. As we saw after hours today, price hit 151.01 and bounced for 9 pts. Below 151 is certain death, or possibly a 200-day MA test around 110 (orange line)\n\nNot just are we at these multiple areas of support, we are in the midst of oversold territory with daily RSI at 33, its lowest reading since before most of you were born (April 3, 2020, $2.80 close). *An aside: What a long way GME has come to be knocking at the year-to-date RSI lows and closing at almost $168, OG GME bull* /u/Uberkikz11 *and the GMEdd team's bull case fair value target released on 1/20/21. Market weighing machine well at work. Cheers, Rod.*\n\nBut wait! There's more: While GME is in oversold territory, SPX and especially NQ/FAGMAN are well overbought and starting to show weakness here at monthly OpEx. We've seen money flow to the safe haven of GME in times of hedging need. Should the indexes pull back starting as soon as tomorrow (Thursday 7/15), the money that was made dumping tech on retail at ATHs will find its way somewhere, and in the past it has been GME (and boomer value stocks).\n\nAll this being said, today I would put us at or around 3/24 in the quarterly cycle. Especially with the NFLX news knocking us down even lower into oversold territory with support at 151, our capitulation may be in.\n\n# Where we are going\n\nAll these factors are indicating that, should patterns repeat, GME is ripe for a bounce in the near future, and it could be a nice 40-60 pt ripper up to resistance levels at the 20 or 50 day MAs around 200, or one of the other two swing high AVWAPs above (207, 235).\n\nAt the very least, from the after hours action we will open gapped-down with gap to fill at 167. Could fill now, could fill next week, could fill never.\n\nNow, I don't think we are going to see a breakout with continuation until we get to mid August, for another \\~4 week run up into earnings. As you can see between Q1-Q2 ER, we caught a 64 pt dragon dong oversold bounce out of the 3/24 capitulation candle, and after that came two months of consolidation where GME was pinned in a relatively tight range in order to let IV die down, cheapen OTM calls for large in scale buying, and let shorts get comfy enough to catch them off guard. \n\n# GamePlan\n\n**Immediate term:** Watch price action tomorrow AM for a rip out of open which dips may be bought, or a sell at open to re-test 151, followed by a reversal on increased volume if 151 holds and shit starts hitting the fan on NQ/SPX. If it doesn't reverse strongly but holds 151, look for basing to occur with more volume to come in possibly in the afternoon, eventually bringing volatile movements to the upside. The basing could take a while, might not start getting interesting until Friday afternoon into close. \n\nIF we don't get a strong reversal by end of this week, but hold 151, look for a dip-to-moon or rip straight out of the gates on Monday.\n\nTargets are the upper resistance levels 198, 209, 235. Don't be greedy.\n\nIF we lose 151, let it die some more. If you liked GME at 483, you'll love it in the low 100s. Don't try to catch the falling knife, you will get cut.\n\n**Earnings play:** Watch for price to consolidate for a few weeks after any bounce, identify the consolidation range and look for entries at the low end of the range around August OpEx 8/20. \n\n# Footnotes\n\nPositions: 7/16 170c, 180c, 190c, 7/23 190c. Be realistic with OTM calls. 800c will not print.\n\nObligatory rockets: \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nDisclaimer: Headline risk is real and any bad or good news can send the stock in any direction fast. All of this can go to shit and the stock can limit down to 0 in 5 minutes if it wants. Expect 0. Risk only what you can afford to lose. Don't let gains turn to reverse gains. This is not investment advice. GL HF  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/byxbp4qkmab71.png?width=1613&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f62be83e24ac41f9141b6b353ddfeddbee52e09d",

Nice gain for SPRT on Friday, up almost 13% before giving back a little AH. Call options more than double puts in open interest. IV is so elevated that even deep out of the money calls are stupid expensive. I've seen a lot of people throwing out crazy numbers for stock valuations. Call option buying could be what's driving the price right now. For market makers, when they sell call options, they buy stock to hedge, remaining delta neutral via the Black-Scholes model. Or they could be long other call options. The caveat with this is with elevated volume on out-of-the-money call options, if the stock price stalls and there is no gamma pressure, market makers can unwind their hedges (sell the stock they bought to protect their ass from selling naked calls), putting further downward pressure on the share price. Premiums are crazy right now, so MMs are more than willing to sell these options. Things to keep in mind: IV crush and the potential that this merger may already be priced in. I closed my $4.5 calls for over 100% gains.\n\n\\- **EDU** \\- I expect this to be the next ~~stock~~ falling knife about posted with a bunch of \"but look at what it was valued at before!\" or \"available at a huge discount!\" Well, there's a reason. The CCP is probably going to make private tutoring companies non-profi7t. In the last 3 months, this stock has lost 80% of its value. It's not trading a discount, it's going down in flames. Let it find a bottom first.\n\n**- ATOS** \\- welcome back, old friend. The set up is starting to become eerily similar to last month. MM's making a TON of money selling options on this.\n\n\\- **GOTU** \\- see: EDU above.\n\n\\- **BBIG** \\- hype, run up, completes acquisition aaaaaand price tumbles. Not a ton, but a bit. Keep this in mind SPRT holders.\n\n\\- RLX - being sued for securities fraud following its IPO. Chinese companies are toxic AF right now. The big put volume was either a long hedging their bet OR closing their hedged bet.\n\n\\- **CEMI** \\- another gap-down day for CEMI after exploding earlier in the week. Ouch.\n\n\\- **IGC** \\- are we seeing a pattern here yet? IGC was juiced to the tits on Thursday and came back to Earth on Friday. [I wrote about this company 4 months ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/mh9to5/no_position_dd_igc_dont_get_burned/). This stock rocketed off news of a patent for Alzheimer's treatment with THC. The company has been claiming this product would be on shelves since 2018! Their revenue is \\~$900K for fiscal 2021. Lots of red flags with this company.\n\n\\- **ACOR** \\- big gap-up for ACOR on new of commercializing one of their drugs in Spain. Gap-down Monday? We will see.\n\n\\- **ADVM** \\- big loss after the company announced one of they're drugs sucks in clinical trials, basically. In April the stock dropped over 60% in one day because one of they're drugs sucked in clinical trials. Will probably keep falling.\n\n\\- **XSPA** \\- the ticker name always makes me imagine a spa specifically for X-Men. No news, looks like algos picking up discounted options.\n\n**- NMTR** \\- considering the $1 put is the most active, and stock price is over $1, I can infer that most likely this a long hedging their position through buying puts.\n\n\\- **WISA** \\- when you fly too close to the sun, sometimes your wings melt, right Icarus? This company did investors DIRTY. After two positive days, which drove up the share price, WISA announced an offering. Way to kneecap your investors. This is one of the scummiest moves, IMO. What a gift for call sellers, though.\n\n**- CYCN** \\- gap-up on announcing that it will announce results of a clinical study soon.\n\n**- ARDX** \\- the stock price tumble continues. It seems to be slowing, but this stock still has not found bottom. Open interest continues to rise on call options, which is just goofy. High IV means people are overpaying for these options. Just wait for this to find bottom and calm down. If it has a dead cat bounce, don't rush in.\n\n\\- **CBIO** \\- the company announced they screened their first patient for a study, which is necessary before starting phase 1 of trials next year. I think this news is reflected in the Dec call buying.\n\n\\- **ADTX** \\- looks like credit call spreads establish for February. Bearish move\n\n\\- **IMV** \\- no real news, just looks like the stock finally got a bit of volume. Maybe its the purchases brought on by a public offering that was recently offered at a 16% discount to the market.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhew. Lot going on there.

In an interview with Joe Tsai (Alibaba Co-founder), Mr. Tsai explains that Jack Ma stepped down as CEO from Alibaba two years ago and also handed over the chairmanship to current CEO Daniel Zhang. Joe Tsai continues to explain that, \"the idea that Jack has this enormous amount of power is not quite right.\" When Jack Ma stepped down, he relinquished his responsibility for handling the company. Jack Ma has stepped away from his success to pursue other opportunities such as creating a business school and hobbies like painting. \"He is living a normal life after business\" - Joe Tsai. Watch the full interview \\[here\\](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KveMLJNhwkc)\n\n\tBefore becoming the current CEO of Alibaba, Daniel Zhang was CEO of Taobao and president of Tmall which is now owned by Alibaba. Zhang is credited with creating the Chinese shopping holiday \"Singles' Day\" which grosses three times as many sales as Black Friday and Cyber Monday combined.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Technical Analysis** \n\n[https://imgur.com/6BecSgs](https://imgur.com/6BecSgs)\n\n\tI believe that a descending wedge is forming. If true, then this would indicate that an uptrend is going to occur. However, we won't be able to confirm this pattern until months later. My estimations indicate that the breakout will occur somewhere between the $198-208 range. I want to make it clear that this is based on MY analysis. I am by no means a professional. Made using tradingview.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Stock Price History**\n\n* 2016- $87\n* 2017- $172\n* 2018- $139\n* 2019- $215\n* 2020- $222\n* Current- $211\n\n\\*Stock Price has increased by 143% in five years\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**BABA Vs. AMZN**\n\n\tAlibaba acts as a marketplace that connects sellers to buyers. In other words, Alibaba does not own any of the products/merchandise. Amazon is a re-seller that owns the inventory and supply chain of its merchandise and sells directly to customers. One feature that I like about Alibaba is that most sellers offer discounts on bulk orders which is something that Amazon does not currently offer. Alibaba dominates the Asian market while Amazon dominates the U.S market. Alibaba owns an 8.4% market share of all global retail e-commerce in 2020. Amazon owns a 13.7% market share of all global retail e-commerce in 2020. I know there has been some heated discussion involving Amazon's private label brands. AMZN has been accused of creating products and removing competitor products to make more money. In retrospect to Amazon, Alibaba is a much cheaper buy. Read the full article \\[here\\]([https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/amazon-quietly-removes-promotions-its-own-products-calls-tech-regulation-n990666](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/amazon-quietly-removes-promotions-its-own-products-calls-tech-regulation-n990666)).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n\tIMO, Alibaba is a strong buy. The financial statement and balance sheet numbers are some of the best I've seen compared to other companies I've done due diligence on. I like the fact that Alibaba doesn't own the products themselves. Instead, they connect the sellers to the buyers.  Alibaba makes money off of commissions and advertising storefronts instead of buying and selling the products themselves. Alibaba owns a wide range of subsidiaries making it a more stable company. If one market goes down, they stand to lose less by diversifying their assets.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Disclaimer:*\n\n*\\*\\*This is not investment advice\\*\\**\n\n*\\*\\*Do your own research\\*\\**",

        "selftext": " After a strong year in 2020, Chinese stocks have been among the worst-performers in 2021, and they constitute a sizable chunk of many emerging markets indices.\n\nThe country continues to go through a declining credit impulse (which is typical every three years or so), while regulators crack down on tech stocks and other industries (which is not typical; it\u2019s been a more aggressive crackdown than any of their prior ones). It started in late 2020 when regulators went after Ant Financial and Jack Ma in particular. They then broadened that crackdown to the whole ecommerce space. Earlier this month, they forced ride-hailing app Didi (DIDI) to delist from app stores until they regulate user data differently. This week, they went hard after for-profit education companies, and made it so that companies wishing to IPO in a foreign market have to announce it to Chinese regulators ahead of time.\n\nValuations and investor sentiment on Chinese stocks is nearly rock-bottom at this point. Investors have to contend with the tail risk possibility of the United States forcing some Chinese companies to delist from US exchanges if relations between the countries weakens, and China itself cracking down on its own companies and taking steps to make it harder for them to list on US exchanges.\n\nWhen things appear uninvestable, it is often when they are ironically the most investable, or at least the most speculate-able with cautious position-sizing.",

        "selftext": " Payoneer is a payment platform that offers a way for businesses to pay and receive money, for a low fee. Payoneer believes that the total addressable market (defined as global e-commerce volume) is $26 trillion a year. Payoneer processed over $44 billion in 2020 alone.\n\nPayoneer also offers:\n\n* Accounting integrations\n* Capital to small businesses\n* Regulatory and compliance infrastructure\n* Physical debit cards\n* Tax solutions\n\n**Management Team**\n\nScott Galit - CEO of Payoneer, previously a senior VP at MasterCard. Serious financial services pedigree.\n\nMichael G Levine - CFO of Payoneer, ex-City VP and ex-CFO of Maler Technologies. MBA from Wharton.\n\nBetsy Cohen - Tons of finance related experience, including founding Bancorp. Should be able to give Payoneer great advice for future growth.\n\n**Customers**\n\nPayoneer has some big name clients, including but not limited to:\n\n* Amazon Europe\n* Google\n* eBay\n* Walmart\n* Upwork\n* Fiverr\n* AirBnB\n* Booking.com\n\nPayoneer works with 9 of the top 20 most valuable companies. Alongside these big names, Payoneer also has 5 million+ marketplaces and businesses, across over 190 countries.\n\n**Switching Costs**\n\nIntegrating, setting up, and teaching staff how to use a new payment platform can be time-consuming and expensive for businesses. Therefore, when a client is set up on Payoneer, it is unlikely that they will switch to another provider. This is best seen by the &gt;100% volume retention that Payoneer has (i.e. customers stay and increase their payment volume).\n\n**Brand**\n\nPayoneer, from what I have seen, has a strong brand (though this is obviously a subjective factor). This idea is reinforced by the presence of their big name clients. Branding is really important in FinTech, businesses need 100% confidence when money and payments are involved. This offers not only stops entrants into their market, but should also facilitate future growth and customer acquisition.\n\n**Network Effect**\n\nImagine company A is on Payoneer and wants to pay company B. Company A suggests payment through their usual payment processor, Payoneer. Company B now signs up to Payoneer and decides to do all their payments through it etc. This is the network effect that Payoneer enjoys. This is a very powerful barrier to entry - very difficult to overcome, while also hard to create yourself.\n\n**Geographies**\n\nUNSUBSTANTIATED: Conversations on Reddit leads me to believe that Payoneer has a strong presence in Asia. If anyone has evidence, please put it in the comments.\n\nIf this is true, it should give Payoneer an edge in capitalising on the future growth of the emerging markets.\n\nSome evidence:\n\n* The CEO has gone on record saying Korea is one of their big market focuses.\n* Achieved triple digit growth each year in the asian markets from 2012-2016.\n\n**Valuation and Financials**\n\nEnterprise Value: $3.29 billion\n\nProjected 2021 revenue: $432 million\n\nEV/2021 revenue multiple: 7.6x\n\n2019-2020 revenue growth: 8.8%\n\n**Institutional Ownership**\n\nPayoneer has some institutional giants already invested, including Wellington Management, Dragoneer Investment Group, Fidelity Management and Research, Temasek, and Franklin Templeton.\n\n**Speculative Catalyst**\n\nIn ARK\u2019s Big Ideas 2021, FinTech was mentioned as a big theme that will prevail in 2021. If ARK were to add this cheap, promising FinTech firm to one of their funds, Payoneer will get the respect it deserves and will rocket upwards.\n\n**Risks**\n\n* There are many entrants in the payment processing industry, potentially driving down fees and increasing competition for customers\n* Revenue did not increase very much during 2020, despite a huge e-commerce boom\n* Big clients (which could be a large percentage of revenues) may drop Payoneer for some (hypothetical) reason\n\n**Personal Note**\n\n**Price Target**\n\nBull Case: $26\n\nMain Case: $21\n\nBear Case: $16\n\nHow did I get these numbers? Just educated guesses.\n\nAs always DYOR, I have linked the investor presentation in the sources, 100% worth a read.",

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, July 15, 2021**\n\nStocks broadly fell today as market participants continued digesting Q2 earning reports, reassurances from the Federal Reserve that current inflationary pressures is temporary and new economic reports that suggest a slowdown in the global growth rate. After recording several new intraday highs this week, the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) slipped, closing 0.34% and 0.7% down respectively. The Russell 2000 (IWM) fell for the third straight day this week, closing 0.54% down.\n\nMarkets seem to have become jittery following the release of the June Consumer and Producer Price Index (CPI &amp; PPI). (CPI), which measures changes in the prices of consumer goods, rose 0.9% in June, accelerating from May\u2019s 0.6%. Year-on-year, the CPI is up 5.4%, exceeding the 4.9% expected by economists and the fastest rate of growth since 2008. Core CPI, which excludes the volatile price energy and food and is therefore considered a more accurate representation of general price inflation, was up 4.5% year-on-year as prices bounced from last year\u2019s pandemic-era lows. PPI, which measures the average changes in prices received by domestic producers for their output rose 1% in June, accelerating to a 7.3% rise year-on-year, while still reflecting base effects. Core PPI rse 5.5%. This is the fastest rate of increase since 2009.\n\nYesterday, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell gave his semi-annual monetary policy testimony before Congress, where he largely reiterated the same thing he has been saying for months. Powell said \u201cinflation will likely remain elevated in the coming months before moderating\u201d and that the US economy was \u201cstill a ways\u201d off from reaching the threshold of \u201csubstantial further progress\u201d that would trigger the Central Bank to roll-back pandemic-era policies. In short, Powell basically said while he expects higher inflation prints in the coming months, pressures are transitory and due to pandemic era disruptions and the Fed\u2019s goal for economic recovery have not been met. [Here is Powell\u2019s complete testimony, but here are two of his most important quotes.](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/testimony/powell20210714a.htm)\n\n**On the labor market:** \u201cConditions in the labor market have continued to improve, but there is still a long way to go. Labor demand appears to be very strong; job openings are at a record high, hiring is robust, and many workers are leaving their current jobs to search for better ones. Indeed, employers added 1.7 million workers from April through June. However, the unemployment rate remained elevated in June at 5.9 percent, and this figure understates the shortfall in employment, particularly as participation in the labor market has not moved up from the low rates that have prevailed for most of the past year. Job gains should be strong in coming months as public health conditions continue to improve and as some of the other pandemic-related factors currently weighing them down diminish.\u201d\n\n**On inflation:** \u201cInflation has increased notably and will likely remain elevated in coming months before moderating. Inflation is being temporarily boosted by base effects, as the sharp pandemic-related price declines from last spring drop out of the 12-month calculation. In addition, strong demand in sectors where production bottlenecks or other supply constraints have limited production has led to especially rapid price increases for some goods and services, which should partially reverse as the effects of the bottlenecks unwind. Prices for services that were hard hit by the pandemic have also jumped in recent months as demand for these services has surged with the reopening of the economy\u201d.\n\nIn other news, new economic data coming out of China, the first country to experience and begin recovering from the virus, is showing a marked slowdown in economic growth. The world's second largest economy expanded at a 7.9% rate in the second quarter from a year ago, according to the National Bureau of Statistics, missing consensus estimates for an 8.0% rise and decelerating sharply from the first quarter's 18.3% increase. In response, the People\u2019s Bank of China signalled it was cutting the amount of cash that banks must hold in reserve, a move that suggests the economic recovery in China may be slowing down. The People\u2019s Bank of China (PBOC) will reduce the reserve requirement ratio by 0.5 percentage point for most banks, according to a [statement](http://www.pbc.gov.cn/goutongjiaoliu/113456/113469/4287599/index.html) published Friday. That will unleash about 1 trillion yuan ($154 billion) of long-term liquidity into the economy and will be effective on July 15, the central bank said. The reduction was signaled earlier this week, when the State Council, China\u2019s equivalent of a cabinet, hinted the central bank would make more liquidity available to banks so they could lend to smaller firms hurt by rising costs. The timing and magnitude of the move, coming a week before second-quarter growth data, suggests worries about the economy\u2019s outlook and was a decisive shift away from policy tightening, which most, if not all, recovering economies are pursuing.  Just to put into more familiar terms, this would be like if the Federal Reserve suddenly turned around and said rather than discussing tapering quantitative easing, it would instead propose pumping more money into the economy.\n\nIn good news, the Weekly Unemployment Report showed new jobless claims fall to pandemic-era lows. \n\n* **Initial jobless claims, week ended July 10:** 360,000 vs. 350,000 expected and a revised 386,000 during prior week \n* **Continuing claims, week ended July 3:** 3.241 million vs. 3.300 million expected and a revised 3.367 million during prior week\n\n**Highlights** \n\n* Import prices were up 1% in June over May, adding to a 1.4% increase the month prior. This marks the eighth straight month import prices have risen and brings the annual price increase to 11.2%\n* Netflix (NFLX) has announced it plans to eventually stream video games on its platform and hired a former Electronic Arts (EA) executive to lead the push. \n* As earnings season continues, big bank stocks continue falling despite, in most cases, posting great earnings. \n* Square (SQ) announced it has acquired Crew, and app that enables real-time access to communicate with frontline hourly workers and assist with scheduling and other managerial services.\n* According to Facebook (FB), the company is pledging $1 billion to support content creators on its platforms through the end of 2022. Content creators will receive a monthly bonus if they hit milestones for earnings Stars, a form of digital tipping that fans can use to pay their favorite creators during live-streamed videos. Instagram's bonus programs will include incentives to use Reels, its copycat TikTok feature that showcases short-form video clips. Creators will earn money based on how their Reels videos perform, the company said.\n* Microsoft (MSFT) is betting hybrid work will provide an opening to make its Windows operating system more widespread, launching a new service aimed at getting users of Apple (AAPL) and Android products to use the software. Windows 365, the company said, will be accessible on any device running any operating system that has a web browser, such as Apple Mac computers, iPhones and iPads, or those running Android software made by Alphabet (GOOGL)\n* **\\*\\*Please note that current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect closing prices\\*\\***\n* Apple (AAPL) target raised by Morgan Stanley from $162 to $166 at Overweight.

        "selftext": " $GTII PRIMED:\n\nWith  all things considered relating to the naked-short and stock  manipulation \u2013 you can only hold the floodgates for so long. Interest  and online chatter has been growing exponentially over recent months  right along with the anger within retail investors seeking revenge  against the criminals who have killed so many companies and got away  with it \u2013 until now.\n\nFINALLY, we  have a company and management team FIGHTING the corruption on Wall  Street and absolutely unloading ammunition against the short sellers.  Simply by strengthening the business and taking steps to ensure their  shareholders are not only protected but also rewarded for their  investments and dedication to the cause. The company awarded a special  dividend to shareholders as of record date April 1, 2021 \u2013 How can a  naked short deliver this dividend if they don\u2019t actually own the real  shares? The only way out (in theory) would be to BUY REAL SHARES from  the open market (Potentially driving prices much, much, higher).\n\nThe  Company certainly didn\u2019t stop with the special dividend to squeeze  these crooks and stop the manipulation/suppression of their share price.  They have been adding a gatling gun of press releases consisting of  joint ventures, plans to enter the blockchain &amp; crypto currency  markets, acquiring NFT\u2019s in the fine arts space, launching crypto  wallets and platforms, and even the possibility of a complete business  merger with [www.alt5sigma.com](https://www.alt5sigma.com/)  \u2013 Now I thought we already had this short running scared, but if $GTII  with a market cap of just $399M merges with a company such as [www.alt5sigma.com](https://www.alt5sigma.com/) \u2013 I\u2019d say we are in for some astronomical upside in share price.\n\nTake a look for yourself at [www.alt5sigma.com/](https://www.alt5sigma.com/) and [https://alt5sigma.com/investors/news/](https://alt5sigma.com/investors/news/)  and make up your own mind. Is this a $2B company? A $10B company? The  details/date on that is vague \u2013 but I have my general suspicions.\n\nWhat would happen to a $399M market capped stock if it merged with a $10B blockchain technology company?\n\nLeaving  all of the fundamentals aside. There has been rapidly growing HYPE  online and some BIG investors have clearly been coming on board and  fighting the BLATANT price manipulation while accumulating massive  positions of their own.\n\nThis is a  volatile stock \u2013 No doubt \u2013 but the upside potential is absolutely too  great to ignore for us at Slinger Money. In technical terms we are  trading way above the \u2018200 Day Moving Average\u2019 MA(200) and smashed  through the MA(50) and MA(7) on the upside bullishness in the last days  of trading.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mh3va225prd71.png?width=700&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4f48405160f595d547cf69233cff7e3c0f3767d3\n\nCould  this be the RUN that so many $GTII investors have been waiting for? The  chart set up is absolutely PRIMED on a number of fronts. Notice the  volume spike, the price hammering through the moving averages, and on  Monday July 26, 2021 the stock price closed WAY above the MA(50) and  MA(7).\n\nAdditionally, the RSI and MACD have flipped positive and have plenty of room to go.\n\nBased,  on the above information, catalyst or not, we at Slinger Money believe  there is a strong probability of an epic run \u2013 with or without a short  squeeze. 100%+ would be child\u2019s play, add in a short squeeze and the sky  is truly the limit 1,000%+ could end up being a conservative estimate.\n\nLet\u2019s  see what the upcoming sessions bring. Slinger Money and its affiliates  have taken sizeable LONG bets on $GTII and for the most part will be  holding with \u2018diamond hands\u2019 for the BIG move we have all be waiting  for.\n\nDISCLAIMER: To be clear - the  curators, writers, and editors at Slinger money are NOT financial  advisors, and this report should NOT be taken as a solicitation to buy  or sell securities.

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, July 30, 2021**\n\nStocks fell Friday, reversing after yesterday\u2019s gains to cap off one of the choppier weeks we\u2019ve had in the market all year. The choppiness largely seems to stem from very erratic movements after-hours after companies report earnings. In my humble opinion, a lot of these movements seem like overreactions to me and represent nice opportunities. Moreover, this week market participants digested a weaker-than-expected print in GDP growth and the Federal Reserve\u2019s July Monetary Policy Report. \n\nDespite the volatility, all three major indexes closed the month higher, capping the six consecutive month of gains. As of today\u2019s close, the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) is up 18.04% year-to-date. Absolutely insane. On the other hand, the Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, continued it\u2019s streak of underperformance, closing the month 3.77% lower. \n\nCore personal consumption expenditures (PCE) grew at a faster year-on-year rate in June than in May, reflecting ongoing upward price pressures as demand surges during the recovery. The Bureau of Economic Analysis reported that core PCE grew 3.5% in June over last year, topping May's 3.4% rate. Still, however, this was less hot than the 3.7% pace consensus economists expected.\n\nYesterday, the US Bureau of Economic Analysis released its advanced estimate of second-quarter gross-domestic-product (GDP) growth. Despite accelerating from the first-quarter, economists were largely expecting a higher jump, despite consumer spending, the largest component of US economic activity, beating expectations. However, it seems market participants were not fazed. Here are the numbers:\n\n* **Q2 GDP, seasonally adjusted annualized quarter-over-quarter:** 6.5% vs. 8.4% expected and a downwardly revised 6.3% in Q1\n* **Personal consumption:** 11.8% vs. 10.5% expected and 11.4% in Q1\n* **Core personal consumption expenditures, quarter-over-quarter:** 6.0% vs. 6.1% expected and an upwardly revised 2.7% in Q1\n\nThe July Monetary Policy Report was largely reiterated the same thing it has been for the last 3-4 months, but did include did include some new language hinting that the economic recovery is getting closer to the Fed\u2019s stated goals. The statement read, \u201cLast December, the Committee indicated that it would continue to increase its holdings of Treasury securities by at least $80 billion per month and of agency mortgage\u2011backed securities by at least $40 billion per month until substantial further progress has been made toward its maximum employment and price stability goals. Since then, the economy has made progress toward these goals, and the Committee will continue to assess progress in coming meetings.\u201d\n\nMoreover, the Fed athe report did acknowledge potential risks and stated the Fed was ready to act if \u201cappropriate risks arise\u201d. The statement read, \u201cIn assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee's goals. The Committee's assessments will take into account a wide range of information, including readings on public health, labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments.\u201d\n\nRead the entire July FOMC statement here: [https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20210728a.htm](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20210728a.htm)\n\nThis week, the five largest companies in the market, Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), and Facebook (FB) all reported earnings. Despite all of them handily beating top-line estimates, a lot of them actually pulled back. Let\u2019s recap the numbers.\n\n**Microsoft (MSFT)**\n\n* **Revenue:** $46.15 billion versus $44.25 billion expected\n* **Earnings per share:** $2.17 versus $1.92 expected\n* **Productivity and Business Processes:** $14.69 billion versus $13.9 billion expected\n* **Intelligent Cloud:** $17.38 billion versus $16.4 billion expected\n* **More Personal Computing:** $14.09 billion versus $13.8 billion expected\n\n**Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL)**\n\n* **Earnings per share (EPS):** $27.26 vs $19.34 per share\n* **Revenue:** $61.88 billion vs $56.16 billion\n* **YouTube advertising revenue:** $7.00 billion vs $6.37 billion expected\n* **Google Cloud revenue:** $4.63 billion vs $4.40 billion expected, \n* **Traffic acquisition costs (TAC):** $10.93 billion vs $9.74 billion expected\n\n**Apple (AAPL)**\n\n* **EPS**: $1.30 vs. $1.01 estimated \n* **Revenue**: $81.41 billion vs. $73.30 billion estimated, up 36% year-over-year \n* **iPhone revenue**: $39.57 billion vs. $34.01 billion estimated, up 49.78% year-over-year \n* **Services revenue**: $17.48 billion vs. $16.33 billion estimated, up 33% year-over-year \n* **Other Products revenue**: $8.76 billion vs. $7.80 billion estimated, up 40% year-over-year \n* **Mac revenue**:$8.24 billion vs. $8.07 billion estimated, up 16% year-over-year \n* **iPad revenue**: $7.37 billion vs. $7.15 billion estimated, up 12% year-over-year \n* **Gross margin**: 43.3% vs. 41.9% estimated \n\n**Facebook (FB)**\n\n* **Earnings:** $3.61 per share, adjusted, vs. $3.03 per share expected\n* **Revenue:** $29.08 billion, vs. $27.89 billion expected\n* **Daily active users (DAUs):** 1.91 billion, vs. 1.91 billion expected\n* **Monthly active users (MAUs):** 2.90 billion, vs. 2.91 billion expected\n* **Average revenue per user (ARPU):** $10.12, vs. $9.66 expected \n\n**Amazon (AMZN)** \n\n* **Revenue:** $113.08 billion versus $115.06 billion expected\n* **EPS:** $15.12 versus $12.22 expected\n* **AWS revenue:** $14.81 billion versus $14.18 billion expected\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* This earning season is shaping to be another record-breaking quarter. As of Friday, 88% of S&amp;P 500 companies topped consensus earnings per share estimates, according to FactSet data. \n* As many as 125,000 people reported suffering Snapchat outages Thursday evening, as per industry tracker Downdetector.\n* Yesterday, was the highly anticipated IPO of Robinhood (HOOD), popular brokerage that has garnered a horrendous reputation among many retail traders, particularly those who invest in \u201cmeme stocks\u201d. Probably not the IPO they were hoping for, with the stock down almost 7% since it began trading\n* Personal income rose 0.1% in June month-on-month, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis' monthly report. Consensus economists were looking for a 0.3% monthly decline, according to Bloomberg data. In May, personal income fell 2.2%.\n* Boeing (BA) target raised by Wells Fargo from $244 to $254 at Equal-Weight. Stock currently around $226\n* Bio-Rad Laboratories (BIO) target raised by Wells Fargo from $735 to $930 at Overweight. Stock currently around $740\n* Comcast (CMCSA) with a host of target raises. Consensus price target $70 at Buy. Stock currently around $59\n* Deckers Outdoor (DECK) with a host of target raises. Consensus price target $500 at Buy. Stock currently around $411\n* Gilead Sciences (GILD) with two target raises. Stock currently around $68\n   * SVB Leerink from $74 to $77 at Outperform\n   * Royal bank of Canada from $81 to $84 at Outperform\n* Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) target raised by Raymond James from $136 to $140 at Buy. Stock currently around $120\n* LPL Financial (LPLA) target raised by Morgan Stanley from $195 to $202 at Overweight. Stock currently around $141\n* MasterCard (MA) with a host of target raises. Consensus price target $450 at Buy. Stock currently around $385\n* ArcelorMittal (MT) target raised by Deutsche Bank from $43 to $47 at Buy. Stock currently around $35\n* O\u2019Reilly Automotive (ORLY) target raised by Oppenheimer from $590 to $690 at Outperform. Stock currently around $603\n* STMicroelectronics (STM) target raised by Cowen from $49 to $52 at Outperform. Stock currently around $41\n* Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) with two target raises. Stock currently around $184\n   * B. Riley from $235 to $245 at Buy\n   * Needham &amp; Co. from $245 to $255\n\n\u201cIn my view, the biggest investment risk is not the volatility of prices, but whether you will suffer a permanent loss of capital. Not only is the mere drop in stock prices not risk, but it is an opportunity. Where else do you look for cheap stocks?\u201d - Li Lu",

        "selftext": "Okay apes, listen up. This will be a long one. I, being the retard and masochist that I am, read the ENTIRE 10-K for you filthy degenerates to get a better grasp of the actual fundamental value of CLOV \u2013 not some random price someone pulled out of their ass and decided to throw at you (I can\u2019t blame them, it is what apes do after all). \n\nLet\u2019s start with their market. \n\n\u00b7 Over **60 million** Americans were enrolled in Medicare in 2020.\n\n\u00b7 The company believes this number will continue to rise and equate to $**1 trillion** in expenses by 2025.\n\n\u00b7 The Medicare Advantage market (the market CLOV operates in), made up about **$270 Billion** of annual spend in 2020 and is expected to grow to **$590 billion** by 2025. \n\n\u00b7 At the time of them writing this 10K, they operated in 108 counties across 7 states \u2013 this represents **4.3 million** available Medicare-eligible beneficiaries. \n\no As we all know, they just announced they will be expanding into another 101 counties. To get a rough estimate of the new number available Medicare-eligible beneficiaries, let\u2019s assume each county represents 39,815 of them (4.3M/108 counties). That would get you to a total of approx. **8.321M** Medicare-Eligible beneficiaries after the announced expansion. \n\no They also plan to expand beyond Medicare Advantage \u2013 explaining how they will do this is beyond the scope of this post.\n\nSo, apes, what have we learned so far? MARKET BIG. MARKET VERY BIG. APE LIKE. \n\nWe\u2019ve all probably heard about Clover Assistant by now, but who actually knows what the fuck it is? I for sure didn\u2019t before I read the 10-K, so let me break it down for you. \n\n\u00b7 At a high level, Clover Assistant is a machine learning AI. Every day, it sucks up claims data, medical charts, medication data, diagnostic data, and electronic health records data into its black box and spits out rich insights that doctors can use to make better decisions at the point of care. \n\n\u00b7 On top of that, Clover Assistant is also the portal through which all administrative tasks are done on the physician side (and through which they get paid). Way less headaches. There is some other cool stuff that it does, but you can read that portion of the 10-K if you want. \n\nSince their entire business is structured on software, they can scale rapidly and into any market in the states, provided Clover Assistant is adopted by physicians. Additionally, being asset-light they can shovel a lot of that money they generate into plan benefits (as we have already seen with the Walmart grocery news). \n\nIn terms of risk factors, there are the obvious ones \u2013 it\u2019s a growth stock and currently neither profitable or cash flow positive \u2013 and it is heavily reliant on adoption of Clover Assistant \u2013 and since the vast majority of the revenue the company currently generates is from premiums, it needs a strong sales force (which costs money). I skip a lot here. It\u2019s kind of funny, the vast majority of their 10-K is the risk factors section, think of that what you will. \n\nThe rest of the 10-K doesn\u2019t really give you any info. I use the most recent 10-Q for the next part. \n\nAs others have said in their own posts, Medicare Advantage membership was 66,300 in Q1, with this number we can derive incremental revenue per member (200M Rev in Q1/ 66.3k Members = 3k per quarter or 12K per year). Their total lives under management are now over 130,000 with the new Direct Contracting Entity (expect a small bump in maybe Q2 or Q3 rev they don\u2019t give a timeline on how this will roll out and it doesn\u2019t generate nearly as much revenue as MA). \n\nGuidance for the year is 17% growth in MA members so 66300\\*.17 = 11,271\\*12,000 = 135.2M incremental revenue generated. They\u2019re generating this kind of incremental on .007% market share. Yes, you read that right. .007% market share. This thing can be a money printer if scaled effectively. \n\nIn short, CLOV to andromeda.\n\nPOS: 1.9K shares and adding.",

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, July 15, 2021**\n\nStocks broadly fell today as market participants continued digesting Q2 earning reports, reassurances from the Federal Reserve that current inflationary pressures is temporary and new economic reports that suggest a slowdown in the global growth rate. After recording several new intraday highs this week, the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) slipped, closing 0.34% and 0.7% down respectively. The Russell 2000 (IWM) fell for the third straight day this week, closing 0.54% down.\n\nMarkets seem to have become jittery following the release of the June Consumer and Producer Price Index (CPI &amp; PPI). (CPI), which measures changes in the prices of consumer goods, rose 0.9% in June, accelerating from May\u2019s 0.6%. Year-on-year, the CPI is up 5.4%, exceeding the 4.9% expected by economists and the fastest rate of growth since 2008. Core CPI, which excludes the volatile price energy and food and is therefore considered a more accurate representation of general price inflation, was up 4.5% year-on-year as prices bounced from last year\u2019s pandemic-era lows. PPI, which measures the average changes in prices received by domestic producers for their output rose 1% in June, accelerating to a 7.3% rise year-on-year, while still reflecting base effects. Core PPI rse 5.5%. This is the fastest rate of increase since 2009.\n\nYesterday, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell gave his semi-annual monetary policy testimony before Congress, where he largely reiterated the same thing he has been saying for months. Powell said \u201cinflation will likely remain elevated in the coming months before moderating\u201d and that the US economy was \u201cstill a ways\u201d off from reaching the threshold of \u201csubstantial further progress\u201d that would trigger the Central Bank to roll-back pandemic-era policies. In short, Powell basically said while he expects higher inflation prints in the coming months, pressures are transitory and due to pandemic era disruptions and the Fed\u2019s goal for economic recovery have not been met. [Here is Powell\u2019s complete testimony, but here are two of his most important quotes.](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/testimony/powell20210714a.htm)\n\n**On the labor market:** \u201cConditions in the labor market have continued to improve, but there is still a long way to go. Labor demand appears to be very strong; job openings are at a record high, hiring is robust, and many workers are leaving their current jobs to search for better ones. Indeed, employers added 1.7 million workers from April through June. However, the unemployment rate remained elevated in June at 5.9 percent, and this figure understates the shortfall in employment, particularly as participation in the labor market has not moved up from the low rates that have prevailed for most of the past year. Job gains should be strong in coming months as public health conditions continue to improve and as some of the other pandemic-related factors currently weighing them down diminish.\u201d\n\n**On inflation:** \u201cInflation has increased notably and will likely remain elevated in coming months before moderating. Inflation is being temporarily boosted by base effects, as the sharp pandemic-related price declines from last spring drop out of the 12-month calculation. In addition, strong demand in sectors where production bottlenecks or other supply constraints have limited production has led to especially rapid price increases for some goods and services, which should partially reverse as the effects of the bottlenecks unwind. Prices for services that were hard hit by the pandemic have also jumped in recent months as demand for these services has surged with the reopening of the economy\u201d.\n\nIn other news, new economic data coming out of China, the first country to experience and begin recovering from the virus, is showing a marked slowdown in economic growth. The world's second largest economy expanded at a 7.9% rate in the second quarter from a year ago, according to the National Bureau of Statistics, missing consensus estimates for an 8.0% rise and decelerating sharply from the first quarter's 18.3% increase. In response, the People\u2019s Bank of China signalled it was cutting the amount of cash that banks must hold in reserve, a move that suggests the economic recovery in China may be slowing down. The People\u2019s Bank of China (PBOC) will reduce the reserve requirement ratio by 0.5 percentage point for most banks, according to a [statement](http://www.pbc.gov.cn/goutongjiaoliu/113456/113469/4287599/index.html) published Friday. That will unleash about 1 trillion yuan ($154 billion) of long-term liquidity into the economy and will be effective on July 15, the central bank said. The reduction was signaled earlier this week, when the State Council, China\u2019s equivalent of a cabinet, hinted the central bank would make more liquidity available to banks so they could lend to smaller firms hurt by rising costs. The timing and magnitude of the move, coming a week before second-quarter growth data, suggests worries about the economy\u2019s outlook and was a decisive shift away from policy tightening, which most, if not all, recovering economies are pursuing.  Just to put into more familiar terms, this would be like if the Federal Reserve suddenly turned around and said rather than discussing tapering quantitative easing, it would instead propose pumping more money into the economy.\n\nIn good news, the Weekly Unemployment Report showed new jobless claims fall to pandemic-era lows. \n\n* **Initial jobless claims, week ended July 10:** 360,000 vs. 350,000 expected and a revised 386,000 during prior week \n* **Continuing claims, week ended July 3:** 3.241 million vs. 3.300 million expected and a revised 3.367 million during prior week\n\n**Highlights** \n\n* Import prices were up 1% in June over May, adding to a 1.4% increase the month prior. This marks the eighth straight month import prices have risen and brings the annual price increase to 11.2%\n* Netflix (NFLX) has announced it plans to eventually stream video games on its platform and hired a former Electronic Arts (EA) executive to lead the push. \n* As earnings season continues, big bank stocks continue falling despite, in most cases, posting great earnings. \n* Square (SQ) announced it has acquired Crew, and app that enables real-time access to communicate with frontline hourly workers and assist with scheduling and other managerial services.\n* According to Facebook (FB), the company is pledging $1 billion to support content creators on its platforms through the end of 2022. Content creators will receive a monthly bonus if they hit milestones for earnings Stars, a form of digital tipping that fans can use to pay their favorite creators during live-streamed videos. Instagram's bonus programs will include incentives to use Reels, its copycat TikTok feature that showcases short-form video clips. Creators will earn money based on how their Reels videos perform, the company said.\n* Microsoft (MSFT) is betting hybrid work will provide an opening to make its Windows operating system more widespread, launching a new service aimed at getting users of Apple (AAPL) and Android products to use the software. Windows 365, the company said, will be accessible on any device running any operating system that has a web browser, such as Apple Mac computers, iPhones and iPads, or those running Android software made by Alphabet (GOOGL)\n* **\\*\\*Please note that current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect closing prices\\*\\***\n* Apple (AAPL) target raised by Morgan Stanley from $162 to $166 at Overweight.

        "selftext": "Okay apes, listen up. This will be a long one. I, being the retard and masochist that I am, read the ENTIRE 10-K for you filthy degenerates to get a better grasp of the actual fundamental value of CLOV \u2013 not some random price someone pulled out of their ass and decided to throw at you (I can\u2019t blame them, it is what apes do after all). \n\nLet\u2019s start with their market. \n\n\u00b7 Over **60 million** Americans were enrolled in Medicare in 2020.\n\n\u00b7 The company believes this number will continue to rise and equate to $**1 trillion** in expenses by 2025.\n\n\u00b7 The Medicare Advantage market (the market CLOV operates in), made up about **$270 Billion** of annual spend in 2020 and is expected to grow to **$590 billion** by 2025. \n\n\u00b7 At the time of them writing this 10K, they operated in 108 counties across 7 states \u2013 this represents **4.3 million** available Medicare-eligible beneficiaries. \n\no As we all know, they just announced they will be expanding into another 101 counties. To get a rough estimate of the new number available Medicare-eligible beneficiaries, let\u2019s assume each county represents 39,815 of them (4.3M/108 counties). That would get you to a total of approx. **8.321M** Medicare-Eligible beneficiaries after the announced expansion. \n\no They also plan to expand beyond Medicare Advantage \u2013 explaining how they will do this is beyond the scope of this post.\n\nSo, apes, what have we learned so far? MARKET BIG. MARKET VERY BIG. APE LIKE. \n\nWe\u2019ve all probably heard about Clover Assistant by now, but who actually knows what the fuck it is? I for sure didn\u2019t before I read the 10-K, so let me break it down for you. \n\n\u00b7 At a high level, Clover Assistant is a machine learning AI. Every day, it sucks up claims data, medical charts, medication data, diagnostic data, and electronic health records data into its black box and spits out rich insights that doctors can use to make better decisions at the point of care. \n\n\u00b7 On top of that, Clover Assistant is also the portal through which all administrative tasks are done on the physician side (and through which they get paid). Way less headaches. There is some other cool stuff that it does, but you can read that portion of the 10-K if you want. \n\nSince their entire business is structured on software, they can scale rapidly and into any market in the states, provided Clover Assistant is adopted by physicians. Additionally, being asset-light they can shovel a lot of that money they generate into plan benefits (as we have already seen with the Walmart grocery news). \n\nIn terms of risk factors, there are the obvious ones \u2013 it\u2019s a growth stock and currently neither profitable or cash flow positive \u2013 and it is heavily reliant on adoption of Clover Assistant \u2013 and since the vast majority of the revenue the company currently generates is from premiums, it needs a strong sales force (which costs money). I skip a lot here. It\u2019s kind of funny, the vast majority of their 10-K is the risk factors section, think of that what you will. \n\nThe rest of the 10-K doesn\u2019t really give you any info. I use the most recent 10-Q for the next part. \n\nAs others have said in their own posts, Medicare Advantage membership was 66,300 in Q1, with this number we can derive incremental revenue per member (200M Rev in Q1/ 66.3k Members = 3k per quarter or 12K per year). Their total lives under management are now over 130,000 with the new Direct Contracting Entity (expect a small bump in maybe Q2 or Q3 rev they don\u2019t give a timeline on how this will roll out and it doesn\u2019t generate nearly as much revenue as MA). \n\nGuidance for the year is 17% growth in MA members so 66300\\*.17 = 11,271\\*12,000 = 135.2M incremental revenue generated. They\u2019re generating this kind of incremental on .007% market share. Yes, you read that right. .007% market share. This thing can be a money printer if scaled effectively. \n\nIn short, CLOV to andromeda.\n\nPOS: 1.9K shares and adding.",

        "selftext": "How about an stock that has $300M+ in revenues, \\~$80M of adjusted Trailing Twelve Month EBITDA, a real management team with Fortune 500 senior executive experience, just refinanced debt in Q1 2021 (and has 5 years on the debt before maturity) that grew EBITDA 78% last quarter.  It could go up 3-5x.  Crazy part is this is a deep value stock where the earnings more than justify the increase in the valuation... so, it's not on the come, but here today!\n\nCatalysts?  They've applied to go on the NASDAQ and meet minimum requirements - meaning mutual funds can buy the stock now (see page 32 of 10K dated 2/25/2021).  Management about to have their first earnings call in August 2021 after not having one since March 2020.  I think analysts are going to cover the stock.  When they report Q2 2021, they'll cycle through the horrible Q2 2020 numbers due to pandemic... meaning the trailing twelve month EBITDA will go up 33% (if my projections of Q2 2021 that is at minimum on par with Q1 2021 is true... changing my adjusted TTM EBITDA to actual TTM EBITDA) and that'll get picked up by the quant trading machines.  And management could start going on the road to market the stock after focusing on debt refinancing over the course of the last year or two after their first earnings call in August 2021.  \n\n***CPI Card Group.  Ticker: PMTS.***  \\~$200M market cap.  $300M+ revenues.  Adjusted EBITDA of \\~$80M (adjusted meaning stripping out impact of Q2 2020 when everyone had a crap quarter - Q3 20 $17M, Q4 20 $17.5M, Q1 21 $22M and if you assume trend is new normal, then Q2 21 is $20M or so).  Last quarter, revenues up 20%, EBITDA up 78%, Op Inc up 137%, adj net income up 337% (adjusted for one-time refinancing costs of debt).  Refinanced their debt 3/2021 and have 5 years on their net $300M of debt.  While debt looks like a lot, remember Debt/EBITDA is only 3.75x - which will continue to down as EBITDA continues growing.  \n\nThey make plastic credit cards.  In 2015/2016, the industry moved to EMV (Europay, Mastercard, and Visa) chips - the little chips you see on the right side of all your credit cards.  Manufacturers ramped up capacity.  Industry pulled forward demand and bought a ton of cards.  EMV chips lasted longer than magnetic stripes and expiration of cards went from 3 years to 5 years - reducing demand for cards significantly.  Industry was destroyed due to reduction of demand while supply went up.  #1 and #2 players Thales/Gemalto and Idemia both converted a bunch of their capacity to make drivers licenses and other forms of ID and took capacity out of the credit card industry.  CPI was weakened because they had debt from a dividend recap.  In 2017, CPI interest expense was higher than their EBITDA.  Company is hurtling towards bankruptcy.  \n\nIn late 2017, one of their board members who had retired as CFO of Western Union (and before that First Data - so CFO of two Fortune 500 companies and a real exec...) comes out of retirement and jumps in as CEO.  So what happens?  CPI is hurtling towards bankruptcy and probably would have gone under except for the pandemic.  Why?  \n\nPricing on EMV chip cards had gone to crap and there was little profitability.  Prior CEO had tried to tell people that contactless cards was going to save the company's hide, but reality was that NO ONE wanted to pay for contactless cards or the terminals.  Most of the merchants had credit card readers / terminals that could read contactless, but it cost $150-200 in software to turn on the functionality.  Only maybe 30-40% of the terminals in late 2019 had the software installed.  \n\nWhat changed?  The pandemic!  Now getting out of the store quickly and making consumers comfortable with going into stores is important.  Not only does going contactless mean that you don't have to stick the card in that little slot and have to stand next to the cashier, but contactless transactions also go faster.  That's why retailers now are paying for the terminals.  By mid-2021, I've seen estimates that say 80% of retailers now have contactless readers.  \n\nFor the card issuers, contactless and the pandemic is a chance to get people to shift from cash to credit / debit cards.  Read the Visa and Mastercard Q2 transcripts and earnings releases.  The CEO of Visa says that $18T of transactions can go to credit cards because of contactless.  And in the US, there's a coin shortage that forces everyone to use credit cards.  2% of $18T of what were once cash transactions will pay for a ton of contactless cards!  Contactless is king and is here to stay whether or not the pandemic remains.  Oh and the pandemic is still here.  \n\nWhen issuers buy contactless cards, the average selling prices and gross profit doubles.  The company's business model has a very fixed cost.  If you look at the sales, general &amp; administrative expenses, they were actually DOWN in Q1 2021 even though gross profit went up.  That's how you end up with a 78% increase in EBITDA while revenues only increase by 20%.  Does that mean the end of it?  Nope.  Here's the really fun part.\n\nCPI's business has a mix of large issuers (JPMorgan Chase, BofA, USBancorp, etc - may not be actual customers, but type of customers) and small issuers (fintechs, credit unions, small issuers, etc).  If you read the Q4 2020 earnings letter, you'll see a large percentage (I think 70%) of large issuers have moved to contactless.  Small issuers as of Q4 2020 had only moved maybe 10% over to contactless.  It took small issuers 3-4 years to move to EMV from magnetic stripe and if this trend repeats, then the earnings for the company will go up for 3-4 years at a rapid clip as small issuers adopt contactless.  The increase in the earnings haven't stopped yet and have a long tail!  If you read the Q4 2020 letter, you'll see that small issuers made up 66% of the company's revenues - meaning that the business is weighted towards the part of the business that is going to grow as small issuers adopt contactless.  \n\nSo, what's the valuation for all I'm writing about - the answer is CHEAP.  Market cap is $200M.  Net debt is about $300M (actually less, but let's keep the math easy).  $500M enterprise value.  Adjusted EBITDA of \\~$80M.  EV/Adj EBITDA is about 6.25x.  This again is on a company whose EBITDA grew 78% last quarter.  Prior two quarters also had explosive EBITDA growth of north of 50%.  Basically EBITDA has exploded since the pandemic hit and adoption of contactless increased rapidly.  \n\nAssuming a not outrageous 10x EV/EBITDA, then you get an enterprise value of $800M.  Back out the debt of $300M, then the market cap is $500M.  that's about a 3x return on current earnings power.  This isn't a pie in the sky if XYZ happens, but using CURRENT economic earnings.  \n\nWhere the valuation gets more interesting is if the earnings continue growing due to increased  adoption of contactless that's HERE TO STAY.  If EBITDA goes to $100M and EV/EBITDA goes to 15x, then one can get to a $1.5B enterprise value.  Again, back out $200M of debt and market cap is now $1.2B.  With 11.6M shares outstanding, it's possible to get to $100 stock price.  \n\nDon't take my word for it.  It isn't on the come.  Go read the company's Q3 2020 - Q1 2021 earnings letters.  Go read the company's 10Q and 10K.  On page 32 of the 10K dated 2/25/2021, you'll see this beauty \" We are evaluating our ability to return to listing on Nasdaq and intend to ***apply for listing on The Nasdaq Global Market as we are able and eligible to do so***.\"  They have already applied to go on the NASDAQ.  Just a matter of time.  \n\nWhen was the last time you read a stock pitch that said to go read the earnings and run your own numbers?  \n\nTo recap:\n\n1. Real business... manufacturing business that makes real revenues and real profits\n2. Former CFO of two fortune 500 companies that came out of retirement to turn around the business\n3. Fast growing business with long tail from continued adoption of contactless credit cards from their majority small issuer (66% of revenues per Q4 2020 earnings letter) customers.\n4. Exposure to the fast growing fintech market (customers include oxygen and other fintechs)\n5. Fixed cost business model with explosive earnings growth as revenues continue growing.\n6. Cheap valuation due to being on the OTC and being currently ignored by all the fund screens and quantitative traders\n7. Cheap valuation (again just adjusting out Q2 2020 pandemic quarter that hurt the business temporarily) of ***6.25x EV/EBITDA*** while revenues and EBITDA exploding.\n8. Catalysts of NASDAQ listing, first earnings call since March 2020, potential analyst coverage, mutual buying due to re-listing, quantitative trader buying from stock showing up on screens with re-listing and continued adoption of contactless\n\nHappy to answer any questions.  Cheap valuation with earnings TODAY that is overlooked by the market.  This is the definition of deep value.",

If true, then this would indicate that an uptrend is going to occur. However, we won't be able to confirm this pattern until months later. My estimations indicate that the breakout will occur somewhere between the $198-208 range. I want to make it clear that this is based on MY analysis. I am by no means a professional.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Stock Price History**\n\n* 2016- $87\n* 2017- $172\n* 2018- $139\n* 2019- $215\n* 2020- $222\n* Current- $211\n\n\\*Stock Price has increased by 143% in five years\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**BABA Vs. AMZN**\n\n\tAlibaba acts as a marketplace that connects sellers to buyers. In other words, Alibaba does not own any of the products/merchandise. Amazon is a re-seller that owns the inventory and supply chain of its merchandise and sells directly to customers. One feature that I like about Alibaba is that most sellers offer discounts on bulk orders which is something that Amazon does not currently offer. Alibaba dominates the Asian market while Amazon dominates the U.S market. Alibaba owns an 8.4% market share of all global retail e-commerce in 2020. Amazon owns a 13.7% market share of all global retail e-commerce in 2020. I know there has been some heated discussion involving Amazon's private label brands. AMZN has been accused of creating products and removing competitor products to make more money. In retrospect to Amazon, Alibaba is a much cheaper buy.

The financial statement and balance sheet numbers are some of the best I've seen compared to other companies I've done due diligence on. I like the fact that Alibaba doesn't own the products themselves. Instead, they connect the sellers to the buyers.  Alibaba makes money off of commissions and advertising storefronts instead of buying and selling the products themselves. Alibaba owns a wide range of subsidiaries making it a more stable company. If one market goes down, they stand to lose less by diversifying their assets.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Disclaimer:*\n\n*\\*\\*This is not investment advice\\*\\**\n\n*\\*\\*Do your own research\\*\\**",

Yesterday was \"Why the increase after hours?\" and today is \"Why the drop?\" Can't say for sure, definitely some profit taking going on. Growing number of puts in the OI. I would imagine the call volume on the higher strikes is calls being sold to take advantage of elevated premiums, however, there were large market sweep orders at the $18 call strike. Call volumes obliterated put volumes, will be interesting to see with tomorrow's OI numbers (they only get updated once per day, in the morning before the market opens, there's no such thing as live OI data) if IV drops on the calls, which would signify selling or positions being closed out. As of this morning, 137K calls in OI vs 64K puts. Yesterday in this post I discussed the use of stop losses to ensure that at least a minimum of gains is captured. If your position is still positive, it would be prudent to do so. Remember, just as gamma can ramp share prices up swiftly, it can unwind the share price just as fast. I know I sound annoyingly pessimistic, I just don't want to see people lose out on profit unnecessarily.\n\n\\- **UXIN** \\- nice gap up the day before earnings, signs of good news? I'm still super skeptical with China stocks.\n\n\\- **TELL** \\- nice pop on news of finalizing an agreement to sell liquid natural gas to Shell. \n\n\\- **SGLB** \\- good sized gap up today from ~~Ligma~~ Sigma Labs, with nearly all of the volume at the $5 strike for August. Low, low revenue numbers from earnings last week, but the company has cash in hand after two offerings and warrant exercises.\n\n\\- **SWN** \\- SWN reported earnings and fell a bit. This company has $3 billion in total debt! Yikes. That's almost their market cap. No update to forward guidance. For an earnings drop, less than 7% isn't *that* bad. Option activity seems to be algos and sweeps picking up discounted options.\n\n\\- **INFI** \\- small give back in the price today after yesterday's monster gain after the day before that's nosedive. This stock would make a great roller coaster. \n\n\\- **ABUS** \\- small drop saw big money scooping up options on the cheap. Boring, I know.\n\n\\- **IGC** \\- finished lower than yesterday's small bounce back. Call option numbers still rising in OI, but put percentage up over 250% in the last 5 trading days.\n\n\\- **ABEV** \\- high volume on call options were mostly just outright buys. Bullish.\n\n\\- **GSS** \\- Big 25% gain after releasing relatively poor earnings. Production fell 25%, costs were flat, 15% decline in revenue and EPS fell by 50%. BUT the company has enough cash on hand to pay off some huge debt, which should really help the balance sheet.\n\n\\- **BCEL** \\- announced clinical trial results that seemed fine...and the stock dropped over 40%. Big buy orders for cheap calls.\n\n\\- **LODE** \\- minor share gain on acquisition news. One entity loaded the boats with well over 3,000 calls.\n\n\\- **PFMT** \\- this stock has been laddering up since early July. Analysts think PFMT is about the breakeven on earnings soon. The small rise must have caught some algo's eye.\n\n\\- **ARDX** \\- after a minor loss on the day, this stock is up a couple percent after hours. Yesterday had me wondering if this stock has found it's floor. I would need to look at the chart, but the fact that it's no longer free falling is a positive sign of at least stability. \n\n\\- **APRN** \\- nearly 9% daily gain after announcing a new box with Partnership for a Healthier America. I'm all for people eating better and learning to cook but wowzers is Blue Apron so much more than just going grocery shopping. The January 2023 $22 call is a bit of a stretch, IMO.\n\n\\- **ABIO** \\- nice gain the day after announcing some phase 2 results. Tutes buying in? You would think the big gain would come the day of the announcement. \n\n\\- **BTCM** \\- little pullback today after a gaining 16% yesterday. Folks taking profits.\n\n\\- **ELYS** \\- nothing special besides an almost 4% share gain for the day. People do love to gamba tho.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI imagine this list will be much bigger tomorrow with weekly opex. Anyway, thx for reading, happy trading, and holler if you have any questions",

But here\u2019s the rub: Heretofore each downturn has been followed by the price of the coin recovering and then going on to greatly exceed its previous high.\n\nDoesn\u2019t that scream long term buy and hold? (Or trader bait if that\u2019s what floats your boat.) Shouldn\u2019t you therefore own a piece? Maybe just a little piece?\n\nHow do we know crypto will continue to go up? No one knows. Apple ([AAPL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL?p=AAPL&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch)), Tesla ([TSLA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA?p=TSLA&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch)) and Nvidia ([NVDA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NVDA?p=NVDA&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch)) seem like obvious bets now, but five or 10 years ago they looked risky, or overpriced or both. And with Bitcoin you add a whole other layer of uncertainty, which is to say crypto currency itself. Crypto is way more complex and speculative than iPhones or EVs or chips.\n\nI\u2019ll get into the issue of defining crypto later, but I want to be clear that what I\u2019m really trying to address here is, should you have some exposure to crypto in your investment portfolio, and if so, what kind and how much?\n\nThat question comes from this fact: It\u2019s entirely possible the only thing riskier than owning crypto, is not owning crypto. Meaning that 50 years from now, your grandchildren might shake their heads in disgust for you not buying Bitcoin at $32,000, (or $25,000 next week.)\n\nA dilemma, no?\n\nLet me briefly address the word \"new\" in my lead, which I used because for the past 25 years, I've called tech the trade of our lifetime. Just like with what we\u2019ve seen so far with crypto, tech stocks would go up and would go down, but they would always go higher. The chart for the NASDAQ 100 Technology Sector ([\\^NDXT](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5ENDXT?p=^NDXT&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch)) goes from bottom left to top right. And it makes sense, doesn\u2019t it, as tech becomes a bigger and bigger part of our economy.\n\nAnd now? Well, I\u2019m not saying tech is finished by any means, but it could be that after two and a half decades, the sweetest part of that trade has run its course, especially for the big FAAN/MG (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Microsoft, Google) names. Two strong winds now blow in the faces of those companies.\n\nThe first is the tyranny of large numbers, meaning it becomes increasingly difficult for a company to grow 30% a year when its annual revenue is closing in on $200 billion (as is the case with Google, which also sports a market valuation of $1.7 trillion.) How can a company sustain that and how much bigger can it grow? The second wind is potential government regulation addressing the massive market power of these giants, (though breaking up these companies may be a boon to shareholders and consumers.) And of course these two headwinds are intertwined.\n\nA segue back to crypto. I know it seems like all you hear these days is \"Bitcoin, Bitcoin Bitcoin,\" right? Celebrities, CEOs, and heads of state are either investing in it, setting up endeavors or commenting on it. But here\u2019s the thing, the total value of all Bitcoins right now is $605 billion, or about half of a single FAAN/MG. That also equals only about 1.7% of the world's supply of money (and about 5.3% of the world's gold supply, according to Investopedia.)\n\nIn fact all crypto coins combined now account for less than 5% of the world's money supply. Imagine the hype if crypto gets to be equal to 25% or 50% of what they call fiat (or traditional) currency. So maybe crypto has room to grow. On the other hand [tulip bulbs were worth a bunch too, back in the day.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulip_mania#/media/File:Tulip_price_index1.svg)\n\nWhat exactly is cryptocurrency? (Forgive me if this part is familiar.) Crypto is a type of digital, usually non-government issued, currency that is encrypted, which protects it from being counterfeited. (So-called stablecoins are crypto pegged to traditional currency like the dollar.)\n\nThese currencies exist on distributed computer networks which use blockchain technology, a special kind of database really, which creates a permanent record of transactions that can be viewed by all.\n\n[Bitcoin](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BTC-USD?p=BTC-USD), launched in 2009 by someone or some people under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto, is the king of the coins, but there are thousands of them, [(Yahoo Finance tracks over 300)](https://finance.yahoo.com/cryptocurrencies), including biggies like [Ethereum](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ETH-USD?p=ETH-USD), used for instance to buy and sell NFTs (non fungible tokens, [which I wrote about here](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/69-million-reasons-why-you-should-care-about-nf-ts-121858223.html)), [Ripple, or XRP](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/XRP-USD?p=XRP-USD), which is used for banking transactions and the infamous [Dogecoin](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/DOGE-USD?p=DOGE-USD), a satirical coin (replete with its Shiba Inu dog meme), which has a very no joke market value of $25 billion.\n\nYes, it's kind of crazy. Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger don\u2019t like crypto. Munger calls it \u201crat poison\u201d and says it aids and abets criminals. That certainly has been true (along with all the legit use), but it ignores the obvious point that a vast majority of all the crime in the world is facilitated by traditional currencies and systems, (Exhibit A: [The FinCEN Files investigations. ](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/jasonleopold/fincen-files-financial-scandal-criminal-networks)Crypto is never mentioned here. JPMorgan, HSBC and Deutsche Bank and dollars are often.) It\u2019s still very much the case that the $100 bill is the criminal\u2019s currency and denomination of choice.\n\nOthers point to additional issues with Bitcoin. Elon Musk for instance, generally a crypto bull, helped juice the run-up in Bitcoin earlier this year when Tesla announced it would accept Bitcoin as payment. But Musk then created a crypto downdraft in May when he suspended that program due to environmental concerns, as creating Bitcoin, (or mining), requires copious amounts of energy consumption. (Musk said this week he will reconsider as mining processes improve.)\n\nOthers note Bitcoin isn\u2019t actually accomplishing what many hoped it would do. \u201cBitcoin was designed as a digitally anonymous medium of exchange that did not involve a trusted third party, such as a central bank, but Bitcoin has failed abjectly at its stated objective,\u201d says Eswar Prasad, a professor at Cornell University and author of a forthcoming book called, \"The Future of Money: How the Digital Revolution Is Transforming Currencies and Finance.\"\u00a0\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very volatile currency in terms of value, so it is not a reliable medium of exchange. Moreover, it\u2019s slow, expensive, and cumbersome to use,\" he said. \"Despite a lack of intrinsic value, Bitcoin began to be adopted mainly as a speculative asset.\u201d\n\nRic Edelman, executive chairman of Edelman Financial Engine, doesn\u2019t necessarily disagree but says \u201cwhere bitcoin is not succeeding as a digital currency it is succeeding as a digital asset.\u201d Furthermore Musk and others believe that entrepreneurs will build \u201clayers\u201d on top of Bitcoin that will render it more utility.\n\nMainstream bankers like Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase, have also mostly been critical, though Dimon\u2019s view is evolving. Initially he savaged crypto, but said that blockchain technology was legit (a common stance by mainstream financial folks), and green lit blockchain projects at the bank. Then in congressional testimony to the U.S. House Financial Services Committee in late May, he [said he wouldn\u2019t steer clients away from crypto.](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jp-morgans-jamie-dimon-buyer-beware-on-cryptocurrencies-200700048.html)\n\n*\u201cMy own personal advice to people is: stay away from it. That does not mean the clients don't want it,\u201d Dimon said. \u201cThis goes back to how you have to run a business. I don't smoke marijuana but if you make it nationally legal, I'm not going to stop our people from banking it.\"*\n\nJust this week, [JPMorgan became the major bank to give its customers access to crypto funds.](https://www.businessinsider.com/jpmorgan-financial-advisors-crypto-bitcoin-products-retail-wealth-management-2021-7)\n\nI tend to think that Bitcoin and its ilk are to money what the internet is to information \u2014 a digital, low cost, less fettered variation. As such, cryptocurrency and blockchain are a parallel universe to the legacy world of finance, soon to mirror every facet of what came before and perhaps one day to subsume it. What does that mean for JPMorgan, the Fed, the NYSE and the dollar? Lots, though who knows what exactly. It may not kill any of them though. For instance, all those newfangled mobile payment businesses like PayPal and Square haven\u2019t slowed Visa and Mastercard much.\n\nThen there\u2019s regulation. At some point lawmakers will wrap their brains around crypto, but they haven\u2019t yet. \u201cRight now we\u2019re past the wild west phase where we were living in a fairly unregulated environment. We\u2019re in what I would characterize as an awkward phase,\u201d says Daniel Tramel Stabile, a partner in the Miami office of Shutts &amp; Bowen LLP\u200b\u200b and a professor at University of Miami Law School, who specializes in legal issues surrounding digital assets. \u201cI think in the long run regulation will be a very positive thing for the industry as it continues to mature.\u201d\n\nI could write a zillion more paragraphs about crypto, it touches every corner of our lives now and there are a flood of news stories every day, but I\u2019m going to leave it at that. Except to refer you to a pretty incredible, somewhat under-the-radar conversation[ at The B-Word Conference ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTESiH2zPB8)this week between Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, Jack Dorsey, CEO of Twitter ([TWTR](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TWTR?p=TWTR&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch)) and Square ([SQ](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SQ?p=SQ&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch)), and Cathie Wood, head of ARK Invest, entitled \u201cDemystifying Bitcoin.\u201d It really bears watching but here are a few choice nuggets salient to this story.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve thought about money for quite a while,\u201d says Musk. \u201cI especially think about money as an information system. It makes sense to support something that improves the quality of information with which we conduct the economy. Bitcoin is a candidate for that.\"\n\n\u201cMy hope for crypto in general is that it can improve the efficiency of the information that we call money. So if the core efficiency of money is improved and money has less error, error as in any kind of government interference or fraud. This will lead to a better standard of living and more power to the individual, which I very much agree with.\u201d\n\nDorsey said he likes crypto because of \u201cthe network and the community. It\u2019s deeply principled, it\u2019s weird as hell, it\u2019s always evolving. It just reminded me of the internet when I was a kid. The amount of cost and distraction that comes from our monetary system today is real and it takes away attention from the bigger problems.\u201d\n\nCathie Wood sees crypto as \u201csolving even more problems but also creating even more opportunities as well, which is the history of technology and disruptive innovation.\u201d\n\nSome visionary advocates there, all three of whom are oh-so-familiar with wild swings in valuation. Speaking of which, the price action of Bitcoin has not been for the faint of heart. From October 2013 to April 2014, for instance, BTC went from $100 to $1,000 and back to $400. But that\u2019s ancient history. In 2017, BTC went from $900 in March to (famously) almost $20,000 in December, and then down to $3,500 a year later. And now over the past 12 months or so, Bitcoin went from $5,000 to $60,000 and now halved again.\n\nDespite that, or really because of that, more and more want to take the plunge.

(Funny I don\u2019t see any crypto billionaires popping up on [Bloomberg\u2019s Billionaires List.](https://www.bloomberg.com/billionaires/?sref=eeq6exxF)..yet.)\n\nWe checked in with Eric Jansen, founder and CIO of investment management firm Finivi, and asked him for his crypto investing thesis. \u201cIt\u2019s an alternative investment that doesn't seem to be correlated with the stock market,\u201d he says. \u201cThe holy grail of investing is to have a basket of investments that don\u2019t react the same way to events\u2014interest rates going up or down or the stock market up or down. You could potentially be in a scenario where crypto markets are doing well and the stock market is not. It could be like the early days of the internet,\" Jansen says. \u201cYou have to expect Pets.com type stocks that go to zero, the same in crypto world, but there are going to be Amazons, Google and Facebooks that eventually come out of it.\"\n\n\u201cMoney is becoming a form of expression,\u201d Jansen continues. \u201cIn the U.S. I use dollars, in China I use the yuan. I believe in Dogecoin, buy stuff in Doge, believe in Dash, I\u2019ll buy in Dash. You\u2019ll use cryptocurrency because it defines you. That\u2019s where currency is going. Not country by country but more individualistic.\u201d\n\nWell that\u2019s different.\n\n\u201cI began highly skeptical, thinking it was a very dubious proposition that this was legitimate,\u201d says Ric Edelman. \u201cThe more I learned, the more I discovered that this is a revolutionary technology that will change commerce on a global scale. I\u2019m confident anyone who goes through a similar exploration will reach a similar conclusion. Don\u2019t allow your biases or assumptions to prevent you from making investment decisions that you may regret.\u201d\n\nOK, if you\u2019re buying any of this then, well, how much do you buy?\n\n\u201cI generally advise investors to allocate 1% of the portfolio to digital assets because of the volatility and because of the price potential,\u201d says Edelman. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to have a significant allocation to have a material improvement in your portfolio. One percent is plenty. If it fails, it\u2019s only 1%. Won\u2019t cause financial harm. If it improves, as it has historically, it will deliver significant returns.\u201d\n\nSo where do you put this mad money? \u201cTwo choices,\u201d says Edelman. \u201cSimply stick with the largest, most established digital assets. That\u2019s Bitcoin and Ether. Together they comprise about 80% of the marketplace. It\u2019s like saying \u2018if you're going to invest in soft drinks, buy Coke and Pepsi.\u2019\u201d\u00a0\n\nOnce you [decide to take the plunge ](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/investing/how-to-invest-in-bitcoin)you then have to decide whether to buy coins directly from an exchange like CoinDesk or Gemini, (not so straightforward still), from a broker dealer like Robinhood, from a Bitcoin ATM (true!), through futures, a peer-to-peer network or through a fund like Grayscale\u2019s GBTC at brokers like Fidelity, Schwab or E-Trade. (The latter is really the easiest.)\n\nBottom line: There\u2019s a whole (parallel) universe to explore here. Take it slow, be careful, learn and make up your own mind. Just know the whole thing could implode one day \u2014 or devour the world of money and finance as we know it. Or perhaps most likely, something in between.",

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of these hedge funds, go directly to the [**5 Biggest Hedge Fund Casualties of Reddit WallStreetBets' Short Squeezes**](https://www.insidermonkey.com/blog/5-biggest-hedge-fund-casualties-of-reddit-wallstreetbets-short-squeezes-958146/)**.**\n\nHedge funds have suffered billions in losses this year in a fierce stock market showdown with retail investors on internet platforms like Reddit and Twitter over the past six months. These battles have usually centered around stocks that the hedge funds attempted to short-sell, inviting the wrath of users on Reddit forums like WallStreetBets, mostly comprising young investors, who bought up stakes in these companies to drive up the share price, initiating a short squeeze and making handsome profits in the process.\n\nSome of the firms involved in this saga include GameStop Corp. (NYSE: [GME](https://www.insidermonkey.com/insider-trading/company/gamestop%20corp/1326380/)), AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: [AMC](https://www.insidermonkey.com/insider-trading/company/amc%20entertainment%20holdings%20inc/1411579/)), ContextLogic Inc. (NASDAQ: [WISH](https://www.insidermonkey.com/insider-trading/company/contextlogic%20inc/1822250/)), and Clover Health Investments, Corp. (NASDAQ: [CLOV](https://www.insidermonkey.com/insider-trading/company/clover%20health%20investments%20corp%20de/1801170/)), among others. According to some media reports, hedge funds have suffered a total of $12 billion in losses in these short-selling schemes. Investment bank Goldman Sachs last year compiled an index of stocks that these retail investors favored. That index has doubled in value over the past few months.\n\nIn an analysis, released to clients earlier this month, the investment bank [highlighted](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/stock-market-analysis-retail-investors-plowing-400-billion-into-stocks-2021-6) that the retail favorites index had beaten the overall market by three percentage points this month. The analysis also underlined that retail investor spending into equities was poised to rise to $400 billion this year, an increase of $50 billion from a previous estimate of $350 billion. Perhaps this is one reason why hedge funds have been actively monitoring the hype around certain companies on Reddit in order to better manage their risk profiles.\n\nThe battle, though, still looks to be far from over. According to Goldman Sachs, the retail investor boom in equities is just beginning. Hedge funds managers, like Andrew Left, who expected retail investors to jump ship and drive the price of shorted stocks down, have been left red-faced as the prices of these stocks \u2014 referred to as meme stocks \u2014 continues to soar higher. However, in addition to being active, these stocks have been some of the most volatile ones on the market, adding to the overall chaos in the market.\n\nThe entire hedge fund industry is feeling the reverberations of the changing financial landscape. Its reputation has been tarnished in the last decade, during which its hedged returns couldn\u2019t keep up with the unhedged returns of the market indices. On the other hand, Insider Monkey\u2019s research was able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that outperformed the S&amp;P 500 ETFs by more than 124 percentage points since March 2017. Between March 2017 and February 26th 2021 our monthly newsletter\u2019s stock picks returned 197.2%, vs. 72.4% for the SPY. Our stock picks outperformed the market by more than 124 percentage points (see the details here). We were also able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that significantly underperformed the market. We have been tracking and sharing the list of these stocks since February 2017 and they lost 13% through November 16th. That\u2019s why we believe hedge fund sentiment is an extremely useful indicator that investors should pay attention to.

These were ranked keeping in mind the overall losses, size of the hedge fund, and the market credence of the hedge fund manager. The hedge funds that suffered losses, either directly or indirectly, as a result of the short squeezes but did not shutter completely have also been included in this list.\n\n**Biggest Hedge Fund Casualties of Reddit WallStreetBets' Short Squeezes**\n\n**10. Citron Capital**\n\nAndrew Left, the editor of investment newsletter *Citron Research*, is one of the most famous short-sellers on the market. His hedge fund was one of the biggest losers in the GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME) short squeeze. Citron is placed tenth on our list of 10 biggest hedge fund casualties of Reddit WallStreetBets' short squeezes. Left took to video sharing website YouTube in January to [assure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yS4yPsmaDDQ) investors in Citron Capital that he had made a mistake in predicting that GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME) stock would lower in price.\n\nLeft clarified that Citron had managed to cover the short positions on GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME) at a 100% loss, learning important lessons in the process. However, Left, in the video, said that he expected the stock of the video game retailer to return back to normal levels within a short span of time. This prediction has not aged well, as the stock is still trading at a high price, despite pulling back from record highs registered in January.\n\n**9.** [**Maverick Capital**](https://www.insidermonkey.com/hedge-fund/maverick-capital/17/)\n\nMaverick Capital is an investment firm run from Texas. It is placed ninth on our list of 10 biggest hedge fund casualties of Reddit WallStreetBets' short squeezes. The hedge fund is run by Lee Ainslie and manages over $10 billion in assets. Earlier this month, *Financial Times* [reported](https://www.ft.com/content/dcd86860-09ed-420e-a5cc-d6d281863c03) that Maverick Capital was keeping track of the hype around certain stocks on Reddit forums in order to protect itself from short squeezes, lending credence to earlier reports that the hedge fund had suffered losses in the GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME) saga at the turn of the year.\n\nMaverick Capital holds a large stake in Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN), the ecommerce retailer based in Washington.

The company has executed amazingly well over this tenure, with revenues up \\~3.3x and since our initial purchase, and reported operating income up \\~30x over that period.*  \n*Generally, I believe there are three reasons to sell an investment: 1) we recognize our initial thesis is wrong (sell out as quick as possible), 2) we have a significantly higher returning opportunity to redeploy the capital into (sell-down to fund the new investment), or 3) the company is maturing and hitting the top part of it\u2019s S-curve / business lifecycle, so the business has fewer places to reinvest its capital internally. As such, the future returns will likely be lower than the past.

The hedge fund is run by billionaire Ken Griffin and has a portfolio value of over $400 billion, one of the biggest in the world.

The stock fell during the quarter as a result of general market dynamics and a potential production slowdown due to parts shortages. A refreshed S/X and China Model Y ramp could also have a negative impact on margins in early 2021. We anticipate strong growth and improved margins driven by new production capacity, manufacturing efficiencies, localization of its manufacturing and supply chain, and maturation of Tesla\u2019s full self-driving technology.*\n\n**7.** [**Candlestick Capital Management**](https://www.insidermonkey.com/hedge-fund/candlestick-capital-management/1231/)\n\nCandlestick Capital Management is a hedge fund headquartered in Connecticut. It is placed seventh on our list of 10 biggest hedge fund casualties of Reddit WallStreetBets' short squeezes. The fund is run by Jack Woodruff and manages more than $4 billion in assets, according to latest filings. The fund was a big gainer in 2020, gaining a handsome 26% over the pandemic period, but suffered low to midteen percentage losses in the Reddit-backed short squeeze earlier this year, per a [report](https://www.wsj.com/articles/several-hedge-funds-stung-by-market-turmoil-11611842693) in business news publication *The Wall Street Journal*.\n\nCandlestick Capital Management has invested heavily in Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE: MA), the New York-based payments processing firm.

[Here](https://www.insidermonkey.com/blog/should-you-buy-these-2-financial-services-stocks-before-its-too-late-922927/) is what the fund said:\n\n&gt;*\u201cWhile consumers resumed much of their spending by summer, what and how they used their Visas and Mastercards changed. For obvious reasons, people shifted to contactless payments\u2014one of the Covid-era changes we think is permanent\u2014and replaced travel purchases with online shopping and food delivery. Consumers spent more on their debit cards and less on their credit cards; Visa and Mastercard make more per transaction on the latter. They also make more on cross-border transactions that come mostly from international travel, which ground to a halt early in the pandemic. Visa\u2019s and Mastercard\u2019s earnings per share fell by 7% and 16%, respectively, compared to their usual mid-teens growth. We\u2019re not too worried, and we think they\u2019ll catch up nicely in the post-vaccine world.

It is ranked sixth on our list of 10 biggest hedge fund casualties of Reddit WallStreetBets' short squeezes. The fund is managed by Steven Cohen and is one of the biggest in the US, managing more than $21 billion in assets at the end of March, according to latest filings. *The New York Times* [reported](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/01/27/business/us-economy-coronavirus/point72-gamestop) in February that the fund lost 15% during the GameStop Corp.

The fund also helped finance a multi-billion dollar bailout for Melvin Capital this year.\n\nOne of the premier holdings of Point72 Asset Management is Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ: BIDU), the Chinese technology company. At the end of the first quarter of 2021, 89 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $6.5 billion in Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ: BIDU), up from 51 in the preceding quarter worth $4.6 billion.\n\nJust like GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME), AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: AMC), ContextLogic Inc.

During this period, we have seen very high volatility in its share price, which we have taken advantage of to make significant rebalancing moves in our position (in fact, we even sold our entire position once, when we thought the stock\u2019s upside potential was exhausted). After several years of instability, market sentiment turned very positive, putting an end to the historical advertising problems in the healthcare sector, the divestments in O2O (Online-to-Offline) businesses that continued to weigh on the company\u2019s margins, the IPO of part of the iQiyi streaming business (which hid Baidu\u2019s underlying cash generation capacity) and the tough competition from other industry giants such as Tencent and Alibaba, as well as the entry of new players with disruptive business models (ByteDance). At the same time, the company\u2019s recent commitment to electric vehicles contributed even more to this change of narrative. Baidu\u2019s share price rose almost fourfold from the March 2020 lows to all-time highs and reached a valuation where the margin of safety, in our view, was too narrow.\u201d*\n\n **5.** [**D1 Capital Partners**](https://www.insidermonkey.com/hedge-fund/d1-capital-partners/1063/)\n\nD1 Capital Partners is a hedge fund managed from New York.

It was our leading contributor last year and one of our largest weightings within the Portfolio. It continues to experience business momentum through several dominant, essential, and competitively advantaged businesses, like Office 365 and Azure. The markets it competes for are enormous, which gives the company the ability to compound at scale. In the past quarter alone, the company generated over $40 billion in revenue, representing a 17% growth rate. The inherent operating leverage in Microsoft\u2019s business model continues and led to 34% earnings growth this past quarter. Despite the broad rotation we saw in the first quarter and Microsoft\u2019s robust performance in 2020, we think its business fundamentals continue to exhibit strength, and the stock continues to reflect the fundamentals.\u201d\n\n **4.** [**Maplelane Capital**](https://www.insidermonkey.com/hedge-fund/maplelane-capital/546/)\n\nMaplelane Capital is an investment firm run from New York.

It is placed third on our list of 10 biggest hedge fund casualties of Reddit WallStreetBets\u2019 short squeezes. The hedge fund is a high-profile casualty to the GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME) short-selling scheme that failed as Redditors squeezed short-sellers. Light Street Capital, according to *Financial Times*, [managed](https://www.ft.com/content/ca1090ba-c3aa-446c-8406-7ce0e01bb510) over $3 billion in assets at the start of the year. This figure has since fallen to $1.8 billion, with losses primarily driven by short-selling attempts in January and May.\n\nOne of the biggest holdings of Light Street Capital is Facebook, Inc. (NASDAQ: FB), the California-based technology company that just crossed $1 trillion in market cap. At the end of the first quarter of 2021, 257 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $40 billion in Facebook, Inc. (NASDAQ: FB), up from 242 in the preceding quarter worth $38 billion.\u00a0\n\nIn its Q1 2021 investor letter, [ClearBridge Investments](https://www.insidermonkey.com/institutional-investor/clearbridge-investments-llc/44201/), an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Facebook, Inc. (NASDAQ: [FB](https://www.insidermonkey.com/insider-trading/company/facebook%20inc/1326801/)) was one of them. [Here](https://www.insidermonkey.com/blog/is-facebook-fb-a-good-stock-to-invest-in-947954/) is what the fund said:\n\n&gt;\u201cWe continued to keep our learnings from 2020 in mind during the quarter as we sought to increase the up capture of the portfolio. We also made adjustments to the portfolio\u2019s top 10 holdings to increase the participation of select stocks, including Facebook, while trimming our weighting to stable names, which now represent 47% of the portfolio. Our repositioning has been encouraging so far with the portfolio performing better on up days in the market while maintaining good down capture during more turbulent sessions.\u201d\n\n **2.** [**Melvin Capital Management**](https://www.insidermonkey.com/hedge-fund/melvin-capital-management/804/)\n\nMelvin Capital Management is a hedge fund that operates from New York. It is ranked second on our list of 10 biggest hedge fund casualties of Reddit WallStreetBets\u2019 short squeezes. The fund took heavy losses as it tried to short-sell GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME) in January. According to a [report](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/27/hedge-fund-targeted-by-reddit-board-melvin-capital-closed-out-of-gamestop-short-position-tuesday.html) by news publication *CNBC*, the fund, managed by Gabriel Plotkin, and with more than $17 billion in assets under management at the end of the first quarter of 2021, was given a bailout worth $3 billion by billionaires Ken Griffin and Steve Cohen in January. \n\nA top holding of Melvin Capital Management is Expedia Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: EXPE), the Wasington-based online travel firm. At the end of the first quarter of 2021, 86 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $6.1 billion in Expedia Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: EXPE), up from 76 in the previous quarter worth $6.5 billion.\n\nIn its Q1 2021 investor letter, [ClearBridge Investments](https://www.insidermonkey.com/institutional-investor/clearbridge-investments-llc/44201/), an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Expedia Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: [EXPE](https://www.insidermonkey.com/insider-trading/company/expedia%20group%20inc/1324424/)) was one of them. [Here](https://www.insidermonkey.com/blog/should-you-consider-investing-in-expedia-expe-946679/) is what the fund said:\n\n&gt;\u201cSeveral of our better performers in the first quarter were purchased while their business models were under stress from COVID restrictions or the macro environment the pandemic created. What gave us confidence in purchasing Expedia were the actions the company took to extend out their balance sheets until travel resumed. It should benefit as a broader vaccination rollout prompts cruise lines to resume operations and consumers to start traveling again and are positioned to deliver better margins and gain pricing power as the economy normalizes due to the cost controls implemented during the downturn.\u201d\n\n **1.** [**White Square Capita**l](https://www.insidermonkey.com/hedge-fund/white-square-capital/1020/)\n\nWhite Square Capital is a London-based investment management firm. It is placed first on our list of 10 biggest hedge fund casualties of Reddit WallStreetBets\u2019 short squeezes. The firm recently announced that it was closing the main fund and would return capital to investors, according to a [report](https://www.ft.com/content/397bdbe9-f257-4ca6-b600-1756804517b6) published by news publication *Financial Times*. This follows the firm taking in double-digit percentage losses in a short-selling attempt involving GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME) at the beginning of this year. The fund managed more than $400 million in assets at peak.\n\nOne of the top holdings of White Square Capital is The Walt Disney Company (NYSE: DIS), the mass media and entertainment firm based in California. At the end of the first quarter of 2021, 134 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $12.5 billion in The Walt Disney Company (NYSE: DIS), down from 144 in the preceding quarter worth $16.4 billion.\u00a0\n\nIn its Q4 2020 investor letter, [Harding Loevner](https://www.insidermonkey.com/institutional-investor/harding-loevner-lp/331/), an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and The Walt Disney Company (NYSE: [DIS](https://www.insidermonkey.com/insider-trading/company/walt%20disney%20co/1744489/)) was one of them. [Here](https://www.insidermonkey.com/blog/harding-loevner-on-walt-disney-dis-theres-fight-left-in-this-old-dog-929397/) is what the fund said:\n\n&gt;\u201cOne of the original constituents of the Nifty Fifty holds a place in our portfolio today. When we bought Disney three years ago, we wrote that \u201cwe view Disney theme parks in the US, Europe, and China as resistant to online substitution.\u201d We did not reckon on a pandemic, which closed all of them, and sent all of usto our couches. Disney, however, wasready for us, brilliantly illustrating the importance of management foresight and change management. Or, as Louis Pasteur said, \u201cchance favors the prepared mind.  \nA century after its founding in 1923, Disney is in the middle of a bold shift from its legacy media networks &amp; entertainment model\u2014with cable TV, theme parks, and theater films dominating its earnings\u2014to a direct-to-consumer streaming media model. The keys to Disney\u2019s transition: matchless storytelling, coupled with financial strength. The company reliably creates content that people all over the world are eager to consume. It also hastened spending on original content to attract subscribers to its new streaming platform. These factors have allowed Disney to weather the pandemic having expanded its direct engagement with customers. Such connections yield a rich harvest of insights used to customize offerings on a mass scale, reinforcing that engagement in a virtuous circle and thereby raising the lifetime value of each customer. Subscribers to Disney+ reached 86.8 million one year after launch, compared to the 60 \u2013 90 million management projected to reach in 2024. To be sure, Netflix, Apple, and Amazon remain formidable competitors in new-era streaming entertainment (mind what we said about everyone standing up at once), but there\u2019s fight left in this old dog.\u201d\u00a0",

        "selftext": "Strange day on the market, yet somehow was still able to build on all time highs. It seems like investor confidence is there for the time being as we head into probably the most impactful week of earnings season. I'll update the calendar below as the week progresses and we'll see how the market reacts. \n\n Obligatory these aren't stock recommendations, this does not constitute financial advice - if you need that advice contact your broker, I'm just analyzing data, do your own DD, would you rather have cheeto fingers the rest of your life or have a popcorn kernel stuck in the back of your throat for the rest of your life , no position DD will return I just need some time, etc. etc. etc. \n\nEarnings Calendar (*now with updates!)*:\n\n Monday: Tesla (EPS +19.42%, Revenue +1.09%), Lockheed Martin (EPS -0.05%, Revenue +0.56%)\n\nTuesday: Apple, Microsoft, Google, Visa, UPS, Starbuck, Raytheon, 3M, AMD, GE\n\nWednesday: Facebook, Paypal, Pfizer, Qualcomm, Shopify\n\nThursday: Amazon, Mastercard\n\nFriday: Abbvie, Exxon, Chevron\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm still not sold, this feels like a bear trap to me. FOMC is Wednesday. I'm still mostly cash on the sidelines waiting to see which way the wave will crash. The positions I *do* have are speculative (aka cheap) SPY puts and calls, TECS (3x inverse leveraged ETF against the XLK) calls, and VXX (volatility index) calls. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n|STOCK|PRICE|VOLUME (AVG)|CALLS% - PUTS%|MOST ACTIVE (#)|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|SPRT\\*|6.61|50,258 (7,637)|82 - 18|Aug calls|\n|EDU|1.94|205,604 (42,290)|74 - 26|Aug $2.5 c&amp;p|\n|TAL|4.40|199,549 (54,772)|62 - 38|Aug $5p (21,579), Nov $20c (20,381), Aug $10c (19,165)|\n|TYME |1.38|53,461 (1,117)|78 - 22|Aug calls, Aug $1p (6,452)|\n|HUT|4.94|48,531 (11,744)|98 - 2|Calls|\n|NXTD|0.90|32,068 (2,159)|94 - 6|Aug calls|\n|BITF|4.32|15,469 (2,398)|93 - 7|Calls|\n|ATIP|4.72|13,877 (1,560)|66 - 34|Aug calls|\n|CEMI|2.97|12,245 (3,409)|48 - 52|Aug $2.5p (4,140)|\n|IMV|2.05|8,812 (106)|95 - 5|Aug $2.5c (2,872)|\n|ARDX|1.52|8,088 (2,248)|93 - 7|Aug $2.5c (3,159), Jan $2.5c (2,749)|\n|BTCM|4.92|6,304 (1,219)|95 - 5|Calls|\n|IGC|1.81|5,289 (2,650)|67 - 33|Aug calls for some reason|\n|INFI|2.22|4,287 (923)|86 - 14|Aug $3c (1,557)|\n|ADVM|2.43|3,959 (2,134)|60 - 40|Sept $2.5c (1,008)|\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNotes:\n\n**- SPRT** \\- I've noticed this stock has been following a fairly consistent trend of opening super strong and kind of fading. After being up nearly 30% in premarket, SPRT ended the day with a 9% gain. Over 120K calls to over 47K puts in the OI. Today's volume saw 41K calls and 9K puts. Ton of action, ton of OI, volatile stock. Fun fun fun! OTM call action continues to force MMs to delta hedge. There was a wonderful post yesterday regarding the similarities between SPRT and ATOS as they approached monthly OPEX. If the stock or option activity slows down, MMs can begin to unwind their hedges. I've been asking this question the whole time: Is the merger priced in? Prudent traders would set stop losses to manage their risk. Don't buy the old \"the shorts are hunting stop losses\" BS. Manage YOUR risk. This isn't a team sport.\n\n**- EDU** \\-the decline continues for China education stocks. From the last edition of this post: \" It's not trading a discount, it's going down in flames. Let it find a bottom first.\" Elevated option activity generally increases implied volatility, which increases option prices. There's no rush here, as it still hasn't found a bottom.\n\n**- TAL** \\- See EDU above. \n\n\\- **TYME** \\- TYME had a monster day, rocketing nearly 30% after receiving a patent for their cancer treatment. This stock closed yesterday at $1.08 and at one point today was at $2 before retreating. The $1 puts were had dirt cheap and could prove worthwhile if the stock retreats tomorrow after the big gap-up.\n\n**- HUT** \\- crypto is on a run, so mining stocks took off today. A stock like this will be tied to the hip with the crypto market, so a return to Earth may be a little less likely than the big gappers can be. \n\n\\- **NXTD** \\- no real news, this micro cap just finally got some volume. Average volume is a smidge over 2 million shares traded - today that number was over 75 million. Will the trend continue? I suspect this will be another one of those big gainers that gives a little back the next day.\n\n\\- **BITF** \\- See HUT above. As crypto goes, so goes mining stocks.\n\n\\- **ATIP -** This stock sold off after disappointing Q2 results. What's crucial to understand about earnings is that it's not just the EPS and revenue that drives post-earnings price action. It's guidance - how the company expects to perform in the future. In this case, ATIP revised guidance downward, and investors revised ATIP's share price down as well. \n\n**- CEMI** \\- The selloff continues after blowing up earlier in the week. At least it seems to be slowing. \n\n\\- **IMV -** yuge gap-up day for IMV after receiving a price target upgrade yesterday. Will the run continue or is this too large of a gap to not sell off a bit tomorrow?\n\n\\- **ARDX** \\- I can actually just C&amp;P from the last one of these posts because it all still applies:  the stock price tumble continues. It seems to be slowing, but this stock still has not found bottom. Open interest continues to rise on call options, which is just goofy. High IV means people are overpaying for these options. Just wait for this to find bottom and calm down. If it has a dead cat bounce, don't rush in. \n\n\\- **BTCM** \\- See HUT and BITF above\n\n\\- **IGC** \\- IGC gave back even more today from Thursday's gain. I'll keep quoting myself until I'm wrong or option traders listen. From the last post:  are we seeing a pattern here yet? IGC was juiced to the tits on Thursday and came back to Earth on Friday. [I wrote about this company 4 months ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/mh9to5/no_position_dd_igc_dont_get_burned/). This stock rocketed off news of a patent for Alzheimer's treatment with THC. The company has been claiming this product would be on shelves since 2018! Their revenue is \\~$900K for fiscal 2021. Lots of red flags with this company. \n\n\\- **INFI** \\- looks the stock slipped ahead of its earnings report. Confident investors loaded up on discounted call options. It all depends on the earnings.\n\n\\- **ADVM** \\- after a huge loss Friday from one of their drugs sucking in a clinical trial, option traders appear willing to kick the tires. Here, I can admit I was wrong, because I thought this one would continue to drop.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHMU if you have any questions! I'll be writing earnings articles aaaaallllll night!",

        "selftext": "# INTRO- Markets pulled back late last week, finally, after a long bull run. Going into this week, I expect more of the same before a possible couple of final good week until we see the major summer cool off. This isn't the best time to be getting into new positions and traders should be more defensive going forward. With most everything close to all time highs, my strategy of buying on support won't provide a lot of entries for the time being. Pulling back through the next couple of months will though.  \n\nTesla is now offering drivers an FSD subscription, charging $199 a month instead of a flat $10,000 fee. That could open a big, steady revenue stream for the EV giant. In China, **Tesla** also introduced the Standard Range Model Y and it is a huge hit. In days of being released, it was fully booked until October. I still like $**TSLA** up to $900-$1200.\n\nLast week was another good week of trading, although some positions that I have are a little behind. Next week should provide some catch up. If you feel the need to get into new positions, make them small for now. We will have a better opportunity in a couple months. \n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nI really like $**UPS** for two major reasons. One, there is a major increase in demand around the world. Two, going into the holiday season should naturally see the major shipping providers to see an increase in revenue. I like $210 monthly calls here, but prefer to buy at support and have an alert set.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xpd30m60s2c71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=71354d5a143ae7908f601af3161fcc4b672a3c46\n\n I'm adjusting the **ROKU** alert down to the 180 MA and will be waiting on a pull back. Still most analysts that I see are bullish on **ROKU**, but seeing how we are likely to pull back market wide I can be more patient. Once it does hit my entry zone, I'm interested in $400 EOY calls.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u6llvmv1s2c71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5f628b8783d58e183b545248af5f4582b9bc637b\n\n $**EBON** is probably the stock I feel most confident in a long term put. For those of you that don't know, they are a Chinese manufacturer of Cryptocurrency mining equipment, such as ASIC Bitcoin hardware. I've personally been to their factory near Shanghai, and was shocked at how dirty it was. Being a computer/asic chip maker, one would expect the factory floor to be in better shape. That being said, I've had luck shorting this stock before. I think it is a sinking ship. Ride puts into the ground here.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gyv2x903s2c71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c6fdf7351c2b937401d17af2a6ecb9c83dd8a61d\n\n Oil got hit last week, and **CVX** sold off Thursday and Friday. Overall I am bullish on **Chevron**, however I will be adjusting the alert trigger down to a lower support that dates back to the lowest low of Covid. There is also a big volume shelf here. Let's see if we can pick up some $100 calls a couple months out in expiration at this support.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qradn204s2c71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fca77db16efb387aff6dd184ad556b1a3eb661ad\n\n$**PYPL** has just come off of its resistance and is heading down. I might be a little late to the **PYPL** put party, but if it does test this major resistance again I've got my alert ready and will right down puts to the 50MA. Make note that **PYPL** usually has bad months in August and September. I'm thinking around $280p, couple months out.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/77ssiow4s2c71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c35fe805bfc56c24d086a4d08683f43d70ae5f91\n\n $**SQ**, another mobile payment provider, could really change the way we think of banking, transactions, and QR paying. I personally think that Paypal is ahead in these regards, but Square is up and coming for sure. Having lived in China for a decade and have witnessed the rise of mobile QR payment apps, such as Alipay and Wechat, I can tell you they are great. I don't carry a wallet anymore. I believe that **SQ** will eventually offer other products such as insurance, Investments and there is a lot of opportunity for advertisements and data collection. The price of this stock is approaching the 180 and 50MA. If you think like I do, you might want to take this chance to pick up some LEAPS on **SQ**.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yy84oru5s2c71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=48194be225d293ad730daf14635f6619363647c1\n\n I've set an alert for $**EMKR** pulling back all the way to the 180MA and then settling into LEAPS around a $10 strike. **EMCORE Corporation**, together with its subsidiaries, provides advanced mixed-signal optics products in the United States, Canada, Asia, Europe, and internationally.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0l9gsfw6s2c71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fa0e1fd32aa6647dfd2b8544b27e745231b75d74\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n **DG, Dollar General** usually does well in August and September while other indices, tech and growth are pulling back. Overall, I like this play for transitioning out of some tech stocks and setting up for a winter run. $**DG** has excellent management and has done a really good job with expanding its business in rural America. \n\nHowever in the short term it looks as if we can score on puts when the price reaches resistance. It would be ideal if we can ride them back down to the 20/50MA, or even lower support. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/003y8h48s2c71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d02ebd0b169fbbb8ef2964f4e59f1d5c4de44803\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n Disclaimer: The comments opinions and analysis expressed herein are for informational and educational purpose only and should not be considered as individual advice or recommendations.",

        "selftext": "**What it do?**\n\nAnother down day for most of the market, with Amazon's earnings cuck reverberating across the SPY, QQQ and many others. I personally played the VXX (volatility index) *again* this week, which is insane. It *almost* always goes up Friday with options expiring. Played both calls and puts on the SPY for profit.

The market as a whole had a rough day after Amazon's earnings miss. Puts percentage dropped in OI, but that might have been traders exercising during yesterday's drop. Looks like calls at $2.5, $3, and $4 OI dropped, as traders closed out of their positions once they started seeing profits dwindle. OI numbers suggest that there are quite a bit of calls being sold by traders at the $11 and $12 strikes, and puts being sold at $7 and $8. Premiums are so high these might end up being profitable, but with such a volatile stock, these positions can turn on you at the drop of a hat. OI numbers on Monday will be very telling if the mostly negative day shook out some call holders. I'll keep asking - Is the merger priced in?\n\n\\- **ATOS** \\- oh how the mighty have fallen. Pay attention, SPRT holders, as this was the last stock that ran up and tip-toed before falling back to Earth. ATOS wants to dilute, which, in the long run will probably be good for company since they have a big fat bagel as far as revenue goes. \n\n\\- **ARDX** \\- maybe this is the new floor for ARDX, as the free fall has subsided. As far as options go, the fact that the lowest strike is $2.50 just doesn't do it for me. Maybe as a LEAPS.\n\n\\- **ITP** \\- $0.5 calls here are cheap as dirt. Still, China stocks don't exactly put the tingle in my dingle.\n\n\\- **INFI** \\- another down day for INFI, yet the open interest sentiment is increasingly bullish, even with the 5-day put percent over 250.\n\n\\- **APRN** \\- sweet little 10% bump, continuing the move from yesterday. It's weird that a company with as big of a name as Blue Apron did an offering in June, but then again, they don't make money. When it comes to penny stocks, I'm not a huge fan of biopharmas - I want something that has a product. This company *does* but their financials aren't great.\n\n\\- **ATIP** \\- Seems like they are getting sued because their earnings report stunk and the stock dropped? Ooh boy, this kinda dumpster fire just ain't my cup of tea.\n\n\\- **WATT -** the company reported earnings yesterday after the bell. EPS -$0.18, $185K in revenue. They have $38 million in cash/equivalents and spent $11.2 million in operating expenses for the quarter. Either pump those revenue numbers up, or expect some kind of capital raise soon. You know what that means...most likely dilution.\n\n\\- **MNKD** \\- long investor hedging their position with the $3 put. This company just always reminds me of Attitude Era wrestling. Foley is God.\n\n\\- **LLNW** \\- Most of the option action was calls for September, which are still pretty cheap. This stock was up 10% at one point before fading to only a 5% gain. Penny earnings are hilarious, man. LLNW missed on revenue, EPS and the stock rose. Why? Guidance, lowering of costs, and improved service quality. \n\n\\- **CRNT** \\- Just under a 7% gain for the stock today. A lot of algos bought the dip on options around 11:30 EST. \n\n\\- **CBIO** \\- small drop today, right to the 52-week low. This may be leading some to buy into weakness, with the thesis that the share price could rebound at least a little. Also led to 1300+ call credit spreads with March 2022 expiration. Bearish.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCan SPRT reclaim its momentum? Is it advisable to buy puts on stocks that rocket out of nowhere? Are the markets prepped for new all time highs next week, or are we teetering on knife's edge? Find this out, and more, next time, on Dragonball Z!\n\nHollerrrrr if you wanna discuss. Shout out to \"random ticker with rocket emoji\" gang! I'll be glued to my computer writing all weekend if anyone need any help with stuff. \n\nHave a great weekend!",

        "selftext": "Hey gang, sorry for the missed post yesterday. Had a *ton* of work to do before the big earnings day after hours, then had to drive to a fancy pants business meeting/dinner in LA that was literally all about options trading. I'll make it up to you with a beefy post. Mmm....beef.\n\nObligatory these aren't stock recommendations, **this does not constitute financial advice - if you need that advice contact your broker**, I'm just analyzing data, do your own DD, I love my new job,  etc. etc. etc. \n\n Earnings Calendar (*now with updates!)*:\n\nMonday: Tesla (BIG BEAT), Lockheed Martin (miss EPS, beat revs)\n\nTuesday: Apple (beat), Microsoft (beat), Google (BIG BEAT), Visa (beat), UPS (beat), Starbucks (beat), Raytheon (beat), 3M (beat), AMD (beat), GE (beat)\n\nWednesday: Facebook (beat), Paypal (beat EPS, miss revs), Pfizer (beat), Qualcomm (beat), Shopify (beat)\n\nThursday: Amazon, Mastercard\n\nFriday: Abbvie, Exxon, Chevron\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo Tesla and Google both had monster earnings beats and the stocks drifted higher. Some of these companies beat analysts expectations but still dropped, Facebook for example. Why? Because of *how* they beat earnings and forward guidance. Let's stick with the Facebook example.  They beat analysts' expectations, but warned of significant growth slowdown. At this level, expectations are pretty high, but guidance is probably the most important factor in earnings for all stocks.\n\nSo my FOMC fearmongering was pretty much a total dud. I did close my VXX (volatility index) calls for a very healthy gain Tuesday. The TECS calls are probably a washout, but they were very cheap, and they don't expire until Friday. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n|STOCK|PRICE|VOLUME (AVG)|CALLS% - PUTS%|MOST ACTIVE (#)|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|SPRT\\*|8.97|99,567 (8,522)|86 - 14|Call options|\n|EDU|2.36|90,087 (45,902)|80 - 20|Aug $2.5 &amp; $5 calls|\n|INFI|2.45|59,570 (908)|77 - 23|Aug calls and puts|\n|RLX|4.38|23,566 (11,679)|86 - 14|Oct $7.5c (2.7K), Sept $5c (2.6K)|\n|OPK|3.89 (|12,110 (5,304)|45 - 55|Jan 23 $3p (5K), July 30 $4c (2.3K)|\n|ADVM|2.37,|10,306 (2,219)|100 - 0|Calls (Curiously all $2.5 calls spread across Dec, Mar 22, Jan 22)|\n|IGC|1.87|8,784 (2,731)|93 - 7|Aug $2c (4.6K)|\n|BTG|4.09|8,556 (1,912)|99 - 1|Sept $5c (7.5K)|\n|BITF|3.94|7,269 (3,990)|94 - 6|Aug $5c (1.5K), Feb 22 $5c (1.3K)|\n|ARDX|1.73|6,867 (2,435)|95 - 5|Aug $2.5c (2.8K)|\n|ATIP|3.85|6,182 (2,342)|83 - 17|Dec $5c (1.1K), Sept $10c (1.1K)|\n|NXTD|0.79|6,161 (2,515)|94 - 6|Aug $1c (3.8K)|\n|YQ|1.22|5,313 (418)|97 - 3|Aug $2.5c (4K)|\n|UAMY|1.03|5,269 (1,087)|96  - 4|Aug $1c (1K), Feb 22 $1c (1K)|\n|ASMB|3.54|4,625 (340)|35 - 65|Nov $5c (1.5K), Aug $5p (1.5K), Nov $5p (1.5K)|\n|TYME|1.22|4,012 (1,823)|73 - 27|Aug $2c (1.3K)|\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNotes:\n\n\\- **SPRT** \\- I *wish* I could have broke this down yesterday when SPRT was mooning AH. I'm glad it didn't give it all back throughout the day. Why the increase yesterday? Most likely a combination of short covering and increased delta hedging. 134K calls vs 55K puts in OI as of this morning, with 85K calls and \\~14K puts in today's volume. Saw some chatter about folks not using stop losses on this one. If you're glued to your broker, I guess that's fine. However, if you've ever cried about RH locking you out of trading, maybe a *trailing* stop wouldn't be such a bad idea. If you set a trailing stop and it gets triggered, at least gains were secured. As much as stock gurus talk about entry points, traders should take care of managing their EXITS. I'm not saying to sell, but I am saying that no one knows where this thing can or will go, so manage your risk. Have an exit in mind. I closed calls several days ago that would be worth WAY more now. Am I bummed? Sure, a little bit. But I secured my gains and there's literally always another trade.\n\n\\- **EDU** \\- a nice rebound today and yesterday for the beleaguered Chinese private tutoring company. Call volume has increased, but implied volatility is starting to drop, signaling that the majority of this call activity is short. Earnings are coming up, can EDU regain it's lost glory? Not any time soon, in my opinion.\n\n\\- **INFI** \\- INFI's price movement made me double-take today. What a wild ride. Stock slipped Monday ahead of earnings, then Wells Fargo upgrades it's price target to $14 and INFI comes roaring back. \n\n\\- **RLX** \\- no big news I can find, except their being sued a bunch for misstatements regarding its business prospects. Maybe don't claim you're #1 in something when you're not. I thought maybe the volumes were saying calendar spread, but it seems that algorithms were picking up these options.\n\n\\- **OPK** \\- I can't see any direct news for the increase besides perhaps some pre-earnings hype. Jan 2023 puts are a long protecting their position. The $4 weeklies are a pure earnings play. Dicey.\n\n\\- **ADVM** \\- some mild gains on the day after this stock fell off a cliff, just months after falling off a higher cliff. Must have caught the attention of some bullish hedgie algos.\n\n\\- **IGC** \\- a small bounce back up after bleeding back all of it's gains from a single day last week. I still see lots of red flags with this company.\n\n\\- **BTG** \\- Is this mineral mining company seeing an increase in price because it shares the same ticker as Bitcoin Gold? Probably not, but that was my first thought. No real news here, perhaps there were some folks afraid of inflation talk from the FOMC? Almost all of the action came from a single source.\n\n\\- **BITF** \\- another nice little day for the bitcoin mining stock. I'm actually writing an article on technical analysis of recent crypto movement for \\[redacted\\], and so far I'm most surprised at the fact that the excuse for the recent run-up was Amazon rumors and that the price hasn't fallen since Amazon denied the rumors. Of the most active options here, the most prudent is probably the LEAPS.\n\n\\- **ARDX** \\- is this the floor that I've been oh so annoying about? Uncertain. On Monday I said if it has a dead cat bounce, don't rush in. There for sure is money to be made buying into weakness, but I personally would like to see a stable level. The fact that the lowest option is at the $2.5 strike is a real turn off.\n\n\\- **ATIP** \\- some modest gains for ATIP after the selloff on Monday. Those September calls at $10 are very confusing, but at least they were cheap.\n\n\\- **NXTD** \\- no news, but a very modest gain of a few cents. OI for the $1 call is rising, and the put/call ratio is dropping. Probably some speculative attempts to hit a home run at $0.12 per contract.\n\n\\- **YQ** \\- very similar sort of setup to EDU. \n\n\\- **UAMY** \\- decent gain today from an \"operational update\" from the company. \n\n\\- **ASMB** \\- Looks like we got a put calendar spread (s) going on. Sell the near term put, buy the longer dated expiry.\n\n\\- **TYME** \\- wild ride for TYME. Took off on Monday, came back a little bit but was technically \"up\" Tuesday, then fell today. Put open interest has dropped off a cliff - I imagine when the price tanked traders closed their positions to take profits. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyways, my bad for missing yesterday, but there's big things brewing in the background on a personal level. Considering this forum is where I started writing about this kind of stuff in the first place, I'm very grateful for this sub and will continue to contribute as much as I can.\n\nIf you have any questions about options or trading in general, don't hesitate to reach out, either here or by DM.",

        "selftext": "Hello fellow autists, this is my first time posting DD so I wanted to make it a good one.\n\nChina's communist party has really been driving $BABA down since October 2020 due to antitrust politics and other hogwash reasons.  It has fallen from a peak of $319 all the way down to $198 last week, around 38% which is an extreme over reaction if you just look at the fundamentals.\n\nTechnicals and Fundamentals scream trend reversal soon.\n\nTechnicals:\n\n* [6 Year Trendline with weekly candles](https://imgur.com/PlVMKwd) - As you can see, we just bounced off a major support trendline dating back over 6 years AND the 200-week moving average.  Big money institutions get hard ons when growth stocks hit the 200 MA since it's the holy grail to go long on a long term up-trending stock.\n\n* [Falling Wedge Pattern w/ Bullish Divergence on RSI](https://imgur.com/ZG6C588) - Despite $BABA's price steadily going down, you can CLEARLY see the momentum on the RSI on Dec 24th, 2020, May 13th, 2021, and July 8th, 2021 to be trending up.  We call that bullish divergence since price is going down, but the momentum continues to go up.\n\n* It has at least 4 huge gaps to fill on the way back up\n\n\nFundamentals:\n\n* [CRAZYILY undervalued - Trailing P/E and Forward P/E is historically low](https://imgur.com/9yjdQes) - With a forward P/E of 21.74, I don't think you can find a bargain on a stock.\n\n* [Annual Balance Sheet Growth](https://imgur.com/VR4AEdX) - BABA is currently trading at the same price TODAY as in 2018, but have more than an extra $140 BILLION, over 200% increase on their balance sheet.\n\n* [Look at their annual growth YoY](https://imgur.com/aCiQzWv) - Their YoY revenue growth is not stopping.  They are more than just an eCommerce platform, but have so many other businesses like cloud storage, payment services, e-mail, and the mammoth eCommerce business.\n\n\nIf you don't believe me, even [Warren Buffet's bro, another value investor god, Charlie Munger publicly disclosed his position in BABA](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/04/08/charlie-munger-just-bought-alibaba-stock-should-yo/) when $BABA was around $220-$230.  It's currently even cheaper.\n\n***Think about this for a second.  Amazon's success is actually Alibaba's success.***  For the uninitiated, more than 60% of all products sold on Amazon are through third party sellers called Amazon Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA).  Do you know where they all source their products from? AliExpress.  When you buy something on Amazon, you are indirectly supporting AliExpress's parent company, $BABA.  Do you think Amazon is going up? well, that means Alibaba is going up too.\n\nDisclosure: This is not financial advice and I don't know what i'm talking about\n\ntl;dr: $BABA had an overreaction sell since the end of last year.  technicals &amp; fundamentals are indicating a trend reversal is imminent.",

Today's recap will focus on **ROKU** and showcases the mindset into what this trader was doing.

Knowing how ROKU performs, she entered nearly at the bottom of the candlestick where she presumed that it will reverse off the 50 MA on the 5 minute chart. ROKU is a volatile ticker and premiums are known to rise and fall extremely fast per candlestick so entering on a solid red candle off a potential support would have a high chance of reward.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Timestamp: 8:58 AM - 9:05 AM](https://preview.redd.it/c39bcw4llke71.png?width=1619&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e3a2f5d302ccf26a3b84442cc074c5a1a5edc834)\n\nThe trader outlined a target in mind from a prior support level in the first image. 463 was her first target for this trade as she **patiently** waited for the candles to reverse alongside QQQ and SPY. If it did not reverse, her stop was a close under the 50 MA. Daytrades, especially ones dealing with options, often move quickly. If you see a setup often enough, you can trade it successfully more times than not.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Timestamp: End](https://preview.redd.it/3mvneaemlke71.png?width=1622&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d2f411dfa795ba27115e9b6bcaed997c5ca22a1b)\n\nThere we have it. Two targets planned and it worked out as intended. Some cases it will not work but you have to take a leap of faith and believe in the trade. Trades will fail but have a plan and keep emotions out of this game of ~~gambling~~ trading.",

        "selftext": "Chinese stocks, especially tech stocks now has unprecedented policy / regulation risk. BABA's anti-trust investigation was met with little resistance from BABA. Jack Ma and BABA pretty much admitted guilt and gladly paid whatever fine to get over it. A similar anti-trust case in US will be met with fierce resistance from big corporations and litigation will last for years or maybe decades. Just think about Microsoft, AAPL, and FB's anti-trust cases. \n\nAlso DIDI, the rumor that Chinese government is going to give them unprecedented punishment dropped their stock 20% today.\n\nOvernight while all tards are sleeping tightly in the freedom country, Bloomberg reported that Chinese government is planning to turn education, online tutoring sector into **nonprofit** dropped the entire Chinese education section by 50% - 60%. RIP for any of the EDU, TAL, GOTU, COE bagholders... \n\nWell, the scary thing is the public opinion in China always align with what the Chinese government wants to do. If you have friends in China, look up their comments on WeChat or WeiBo, they are cheering for turning education sector into non-profit.\n\nThe honeymoon with Chinese tech stocks are way over and the price Chinese stocks, even now for some, had priced in a friendly, laissez faire regulation and CONTROL from the Chinese government.\n\nIt might be the time to be greedy while the market is fearful. Chinese market is huge and with tons of growth potential for anything and everything. But maybe in the short-term until this muddy policy / attitude shift is over, it's better to stay away from the Chinese stock to not have that gut wrenching feeling when one of your holding is dropped 50% overnight without fundamental change in its business.",

        "selftext": " [China extends probe into US-listed tech firms after Didi blow (yahoo.com)](https://news.yahoo.com/china-extends-probe-us-listed-081331075.html) \n\n**Beiyi SEOW**\n\nMon, July 5, 2021, 2:13 AM\n\nBeijing widened a crackdown on its embattled technology sector Monday by announcing probes into two more US-listed Chinese companies, a day after banning ride-hailing giant Didi Chuxing from app stores following its huge New York initial public offering.\n\nThe country's major internet firms wield massive influence among its army of consumers, but have in recent months had their wings clipped in a regulatory crackdown that has scuppered listings and hit business as the government seeks to rein in their influence.\n\nThe latest targets are newly listed companies Full Truck Alliance -- a merger between truck-hailing platforms Yunmanman and Huochebang -- and Kanzhun, which owns online recruitment platform Boss Zhipin.\n\n\"The overarching message here from regulators is, you need to have your house in order domestically before listing abroad,\" said Kendra Schaefer, head of tech policy research at Beijing-based consultancy Trivium China.\n\nThe three platforms have been told to stop new user registrations during the investigation \"to prevent security risks to national data, safeguard national security and protect public interest\", the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) said.\n\nHours earlier, the watchdog ordered the removal of Didi from app stores following a similar probe, which it said found the firm's user data collection and use in \"serious violation\" of regulations. It also cited national security for the probe, an unusual move against a domestic tech firm.\n\nHowever, there were few details on the probe or Didi's alleged violations.\n\nDidi has pledged to rectify any problems, and said that the takedown \"may have an adverse impact on its revenue in China\".\n\nThe move does not prevent existing users from booking through Didi, but throws a wrench in the company's growth plans after its bumper New York IPO last week raised $4.4 billion, one of the biggest in the US over the past decade.\n\nThe investigation was announced just after China wrapped up tightly-choreographed celebrations for the centenary of its ruling Communist Party.\n\nIt also comes at a time of heightened tensions between Beijing and Washington with the tech sector a key issue of disagreement.\n\nDubbed China's Uber, Didi was founded just nine years ago by former Alibaba executive Cheng Wei. It has gone on to dominate the country's ride-hailing market after winning a costly turf war against the US titan in 2016 and taking over Uber's local unit.\n\n\\- Shifting landscape -\n\nIt now claims more than 15 million drivers and nearly 500 million users, with services available in 16 countries, including Russia and Australia.\n\nBut its rise also comes amid what Kevin Kwek, senior analyst on Asian financials at Bernstein, called a clear \"trend towards tightening on tech\".\n\nChinese tech companies fell in Hong Kong Monday as investors assessed the situation, with e-commerce platform Meituan down 5.6 percent, Alibaba dropping nearly three percent and Tencent -- which has a stake in Didi -- sliding 3.6 percent.\n\nTokyo-listed SoftBank, which has a 21.5 percent stake in the firm, plunged 5.4 percent.\n\nDidi, with a near monopoly on ride-hailing, is \"the most high profile cyber security case\" of its kind, University of Hong Kong law professor Angela Zhang told AFP.\n\nBut the action was lauded by state-run Global Times, which said the country must not allow \"any internet giant to become a super database of Chinese personal information even more detailed than the state\".\n\nA top Didi executive took to social media over the weekend to rebuff rumours the firm had been sharing domestic data with the United States, calling it \"absolutely impossible\".\n\nLast year, authorities pulled the plug on a planned record $34 billion IPO by Alibaba's financial arm Ant Group, before launching an anti-monopoly probe into the tech behemoth.\n\nThat marked a dramatic fall from grace for Alibaba's founder Jack Ma, who has gone from being the darling of China's internet entrepreneurs to becoming virtually silent.\n\nAnd the rapidly shifting landscape for tech is fuelling uncertainty, with recent moves \"very damaging for perceptions of the predictability and stability of China's regulations\", said Martin Chorzempa, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a Washington-based think tank.\n\n\"They also illustrate that IPOs are dangerous in China, drawing regulator scrutiny to a successful firm,\" he added.\n\n\"Disclosures in IPOs give a sense of the scale of these firms in ways that otherwise would never be known to the public and much of the bureaucracy.\"",

        "selftext": "Payoneer is a payment platform that offers a way for businesses to pay and receive money, for a low fee. Payoneer believes that the total addressable market (defined as global e-commerce volume) is $26 trillion a year. Payoneer processed over $44 billion in 2020 alone.\n\nPayoneer works with 9 of the top 20 most valuable companies. Alongside these big names, Payoneer also has 5 million+ marketplaces and businesses, across over 190 countries.\n\nPayoneer also offers:\n\n* Accounting integrations\n* Capital to small businesses\n* Regulatory and compliance infrastructure\n* Physical debit cards\n* Tax solutions\n\nSo, it is basically a bank that includes an accountant to help meet a business\u2019 needs. The one product or feature that is missing is digital coins and no doubt they will be offering that soon, if anything they should make that a major priority.\n\n**Management Team**\n\nScott Galit - CEO of Payoneer, previously a senior VP at MasterCard. Serious financial services pedigree.\n\nMichael G Levine - CFO of Payoneer, ex-City VP and ex-CFO of Maler Technologies. MBA from Wharton.\n\nBetsy Cohen - Tons of finance related experience, including founding Bancorp. Should be able to give Payoneer great advice for future growth.\n\n**Customers**\n\nPayoneer has some big name clients, including but not limited to:\n\n* Amazon Europe\n* Google\n* eBay\n* Walmart\n* Upwork\n* Fiverr\n* AirBnB\n* Booking.com\n\nWeird right, they work with Ebay given Paypal does too. This is because they work with countries and specific clients that Paypal not accept into their platform. Investors need to understand that sometimes people have to use other platforms because they the Paypal\u2019s or banks are NOT willing to take the risk. Sure the risk is probably higher but the amount of people that need access to capital or payment process is high when many banks in many countries do not approve people for such type of access.\n\n**Switching Costs**\n\nIntegrating, setting up, and teaching staff how to use a new payment platform can be time-consuming and expensive for businesses. Therefore, when a client is set up on Payoneer, it is unlikely that they will switch to another provider. This is best seen by the &gt;100% volume retention that Payoneer has (i.e. customers stay and increase their payment volume).\n\n**Brand**\n\nPayoneer, from what I have seen, has a strong brand (though this is obviously a subjective factor). This idea is reinforced by the presence of their big name clients. Branding is really important in FinTech, businesses need 100% confidence when money and payments are involved. This offers not only stops entrants into their market, but should also facilitate future growth and customer acquisition.\n\n**Network Effect**\n\nImagine company A is on Payoneer and wants to pay company B. Company A suggests payment through their usual payment processor, Payoneer. Company B now signs up to Payoneer and decides to do all their payments through it etc. This is the network effect that Payoneer enjoys. This is a very powerful barrier to entry - very difficult to overcome, while also hard to create yourself.\n\n**Geographies**\n\nUNSUBSTANTIATED: Conversations on Reddit leads me to believe that Payoneer has a strong presence in Asia. If anyone has evidence, please put it in the comments.\n\nIf this is true, it should give Payoneer an edge in capitalising on the future growth of the emerging markets.\n\nSome evidence:\n\n* The CEO has gone on record saying Korea is one of their big market focuses.\n* Achieved triple digit growth each year in the asian markets from 2012-2016.\n\n# Valuation and Financials\n\n# Enterprise Value: $3.29 billion\n\n# Projected 2021 revenue: $432 million\n\n# EV/2021 revenue multiple: 7.6x\n\n# 2019-2020 revenue growth: 8.8%\n\n**Institutional Ownership**\n\nPayoneer has some institutional giants already invested, including Wellington Management, Dragoneer Investment Group, Fidelity Management and Research, Temasek, and Franklin Templeton.\n\n**What do I think the future holds for Payoneer? I actually think there are several exits for this company.**\n\n1. **Growth**: The company continues to grow and eventually reach billions of revenue within 5 to 10  years.\n2. **Consolidation**: Large international payments processer buys them. Could be Paypal, Square,      Stripe, First Data, etc. consolidation WILL happen in this space and I  think short-term Payoneer will acquire some companies and then be sold to a bigger company. Think of this as how banks in the USA were allowed to merge in 1995 given the law that passed. Before you had 100,000 banks then it was 50,000 banks, then 10,000 banks, and now like 5,000 banks but the top 10 banks make up a large % of the business/volume.\n3. **Wildcard**: CRM business buys them. What many people do not realize is that CRM\u2019s have been changing the game. First, it was to help you sell with marketing tools, then it is to improve communication within the team, then it will be stored, and legal transactions then it will be a financial transaction.      They are literally going to control the beginning to the end of the customer relationship and all of that data they possess is very valuable to help their customers grow.\n\nPersonal Note\n\n**Price Target**\n\nBull Case: $26\n\nMain Case: $21\n\nBear Case: $16\n\nHow did I get these numbers? Just educated guesses.\n\nDisclosure I am long on the company  (LEAP's and Shares)",

        "selftext": "TL;DR: Miners are experiencing increased profits as a result of the China ban and have begun to retain the coins that are minted, resulting a strong macro outlook for higher prices going forward, in addition the ~~GTC~~ NAV premium is capturing a lot of the institutional demand due to the NAV premium.\n\nI know the Sub's stance on 'Magic Internet Money' that being said to properly evaluate HUT (or any of the other miners for that matter) as an opportunity this will necessitate a brief discussion around some of the fundamentals at play (mining migration and ~~GTC~~ NAV in particular, sources will be listed below).\n\nI hope the Mods understand my intention and have mercy on my soul.\n\nThat being said, let's take a look at a nice opportunity (IMO) in HUT (Hut8 Mining).\n\n# Firstly I will touch on what the TA(rrot cards) is telling us.\n\n1. Bullish MACD divergence has been present since the recent low in mid/late June, this has been present in both the shorter-term MACD (yellow) and the longer-term MACD (teal). Divergences are my favorite signal, bar-none (particularly for exits with bearish divergence).\n2. Short-term MACD is above the zero line, whilst of little consequence on it's own, this does highlight the attempt to get a rally going.\n3. Strong volume following the up-listing to the NASDAQ, I would hazard a guess that there will be some decent support between the $3-$4 range from investors who were on the sidelines until the US listing. This coupled with the nice rebound above the 200 MA (dotted white line) hints at some accumulation. \n4. Overall the TA is leaning more towards at an attempt to enter accumulation/ consolidation i.e. there is little to suggest a strong breakout is imminent, that being said the signs of accumulation are present (strong uptick in volume, divergences on momentum despite falling price and a rounding/ horizontal support/ resistance pattern).\n\n# I WOULD NOT RECCOMEND THIS STOCK PURELY ON A TA SETUP.\n\n[HUT Price Basic Overview](https://preview.redd.it/xa8tzy8nxha71.png?width=1867&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b16abd3bf1756f7f6c95203d1cd7e7402e0d79c3)\n\n# What the on-chain data is telling us.\n\nWe have all heard that China is cracking down on mining in the country, this has lead to a large contingent of the Hash rate to drop off and relocate to more favorable jurisdictions, this has a two-fold impact for the remaining miners, such as HUT. As on chain analytics Glassnode notes (link below)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;\" Hash-rate has since recovered and stabilized around the 88 to 110 EH/s range, reflecting an overall decline of 38% to 49% of hash-power. This provides a gauge on the proportion of the network that is currently offline and affected by the ban in China.\" \n\n \n\n&gt;\"When \\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* was trading in the $50k to $60k range in April, hash-rate was at its peak, and the aggregate mining industry saw incomes of $50M to $60M per day. Whilst prices have since declined by around 50%, the miners who remain operational have just seen an estimated 38% to 49% of their competition switch off in the short-term.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;\"The daily aggregate revenue now around $25M to $30M per day, but is shared amongst a smaller pool of miners. Same daily ~~TC~~ issuance, fewer competitors to share the spoils.\"\n\nWhat this translates to is a decrease in competition for the miners and an uptick in the % of coins minted from each block that go to the few remaining miners (increased revenue, DESPITE the 50% price correction.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;\"This implies that following the latest difficulty adjustment, operational miners are incurring the same OPEX expense, but are seeing profitability rise almost 2x, approaching similar profitability levels to back in April.\"\n\n# The Most Important Factor\n\nDespite this uptick in profitability, the China rigs will at some point come back online and negate the short-term sugar high that Miners like HUT are enjoying, what this does do however is help to reinforce the cash reserves of the remaining miners, also allowing them to expand operations and increase hash rate and therefore share of the block rewards (and revenue).\n\nBut what is truly the major catalyst for future price movement is highlighted in the chart below.\n\n# Miners Are No-longer NET Sellers Into The Market\n\n&gt;\"In fact since early 2020, the macro spending behavior of miners has changed dramatically. For almost all of \\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* trading history, miners have consistently spent more coins than they accumulated such that unspent supply was in a structural downtrend.\"\n\nAs noted in the Glassnode report (highly recommend reading) one of the fundamental drivers of this shift in sentiment is the ease(ing) of access to finance to fund their ongoing operations, rather than selling the mined coins they are able to pledge them as collateral and go into the traditional financing market to fund their operational expenses.\n\nIn effect miners are accumulating their mined rewards to benefit shareholders (MARA for example, amongst others, including HUT, have spoken about the benefit to shareholders of keeping the mined rewards on balance sheet, akin to MSTR).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mcxgpx038ia71.jpg?width=1041&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6614b1d7308ffddd87f9b17270c19ef3e19ddd36\n\n# Finally The Elephant In The Room\n\nSo now to address the elephant in the room, the recent decline in ~~TC,~~ aside from the pressures in China, the tweets of a particular CEO and the natural process of profit-taking during a bull run the other fundamental driver of demand is GTC and the institutional demand that comes with that.\n\nBelow is the GTC NAV premium plotted against the price of ~~TC~~ (in effect whether GTC is trading at par with the assets under management (AUM) or whether it is trading in excess, or at a discount to those assets under management).\n\n1. As you can see the GTC premium has been negative for quite sometime, this means that the holdings are trading for LESS than what the spot value of those holdings are (arbitrage opportunity)\n2. This is one of the major drivers for the lackluster institutional demand for ~~TC~~ as of late, why would you pay spot price when you can buy at a steep discount to spot with the view that the NAV will return to par (or even a premium) to the AUM.\n3. The other driver is of course the forced selling of coins from China, whereby market makers and institutional players will realize that miners forced to relocate will have to sell to raise capital for the logistical moves needed to survive, therefore walking the bids down is a natural way to capture these forced sellers.\n\n[G-TC NAV Premium](https://preview.redd.it/9pxz1590wha71.png?width=1820&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=44765ac03de8e9d2dbf5ac95eadea1551ae9abfb)\n\n# So Why HUT?\n\nThe obvious question after reading this DD is \"Ok, but why HUT in particular?\"\n\nThe answer is simple, it has favorable technicals for accumulation (MARA has already had a nice pop) and it is not prohibitively expensive to allow for volume, the above macros outlooks (IMO) will serve to benefit the mining sector as a whole, that being said MARA or RIOT are equally valid plays on these drivers (albeit they are a little more extended IMO from a technical side).\n\nP.S. If the mods decide to remove this post, so be it, that being said this DD was done in good faith and to discuss these stock plays it is necessary to discus the underlying product they produce. If anyone has any questions or comments let me know, as this was not as in depth as I would have liked, but I think it is a good jumping off point for the discussion around HUT and others as a viable trade opportunity.\n\n\\*I own 300 shares of HUT and 100 shares of MARA for those wondering, currently running CCs on them to lower cost basis (r/thetagang represent)\n\nP.S. Had to remove letters to avoid Cypto filter, which is a little silly\n\n***Sources:***\n\nOn-Chain Data (Mining, profitability data and Institutional inflows/outflows etc.)\n\n[https://insights.glassnode.com/the-week-on-chain-week-27-2021/](https://insights.glassnode.com/the-week-on-chain-week-27-2021/)",

        "selftext": "Coinbase ($COIN) will be a cash cow for years to come.\n\nIn Q1 alone they had $1.8B of revenue and $771M of profit (\\~43% margins). Q2 earnings are coming up the 8/20 expiry is looking juicy. My guess is that with an extremely volatile quarter for internet money, they will blow Q1 out of the water and we'll be above $300 by the end of July.\n\n**This is what I like about the stock:** \n\n1. Their trading commissions blow traditional brokerage houses out of the water\n2. Bid/ask spreads are wider than Strahan's gap tooth\n3. Fees are fat (and scale with transaction size)\n4. They just [unveiled](https://blog.coinbase.com/coinbase-institutional-is-proud-to-announce-the-unveiling-of-our-new-prime-offering-9790e068f0a9) an institutional \"Prime\" service catering to corporations looking to diversify their balance sheets\n5. In addition to the \"exchange\" business, they're now lending, offering debit/credit card products, and soon will allow you to generate passive income by \"staking\" your assets (FYI this bullet alone encompasses the entire banking industry, Visa, Mastercard, JPM, BAML, etc.)\n6. Despite the big internet money dump, the key driver to trading activity is VOLATILITY - which causes lots of buying/selling, and we definitely had that in Q2\n\nTheir total addressable market is also massive and faux asset / internet money adoption is beating the trend of the *internet* when it came out.\n\n**This is what I hate about this stock:**\n\n1. There's an existential threat of fake assets flaming out like in 2017, even though this seems less likely with each passing day as more and more institutions hold internet money on their balance sheets and incorporate it into their remittance / payments infrastructure\n2. It's weird that Sat-oshi is unknown and still holds $35B of the core asset, making him the greatest hero but also the greatest threat if he/she/they/zir were to dump\n\nSo it's not necessarily a slam dunk but I'm betting fake assets continue to evolve from meme dog coins to real utility providers in the DeFi ecosystem. Also, this an ancillary business to the trading / brokerage side of the house: which is displacing business from Fidelity, Charles Schwab, CBOE, stock exchanges, etc. as people go digital.\n\nIn my opinion, DeFi is going to completely disrupt the banking system, and CB can take a leading role in monetizing that ecosystem. It simply doesn't make sense to store cash deposits yielding 0.01% at Chase when you can be earning 7-10% on cash in stable coins. \n\nTLDR: 7/16 250c's and 8/20 300c's\n\n[Oppenheimer raises $COIN PT to $444](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/coinbase-stock-gains-after-oppenheimer-analyst-gets-a-little-more-bullish-2021-07-07)\n\n2Q ER is August 12th\n\nClosing price 7/9: $253.88\n\n52W High: $429.54\n\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80",

        "selftext": "Hello fellow autists, this is my first time posting DD so I wanted to make it a good one.\n\nChina's communist party has really been driving $BABA down since October 2020 due to antitrust politics and other hogwash reasons. It has fallen from a peak of $319 all the way down to $198 last week, around 38% which is an extreme over reaction if you just look at the fundamentals.\n\nTechnicals and Fundamentals scream trend reversal soon.\n\nTechnicals:\n\n[6 Year Trendline](https://i.imgur.com/v59ExSi.png)- As you can see, we just bounced off a major support trendline dating back over 6 years AND the 200-week moving average. Big money institutions get hard ons when growth stocks hit the 200 MA since it's the holy grail to go long on a long term up-trending stock.\n\n[Falling Wedge Pattern w/ Bullish Divergence on RSI](https://i.imgur.com/Lt8qlVc.png) - Despite $BABA's price steadily going down, you can CLEARLY see the momentum on the RSI on Dec 24th, 2020, May 13th, 2021, and July 8th, 2021 to be trending up. We call that bullish divergence since price is going down, but the momentum continues to go up.\n\nIt has at least 4 huge gaps to fill on the way back up\n\nFundamentals:\n\n[CRAZYILY undervalued - Trailing P/E and Forward P/E is historically low](https://i.imgur.com/ESiyjzD.png) - With a forward P/E of 21.74, you rarely see something that low compared to all the big tech companies in the US. \n\n[Annual Balance Sheet Growth](https://i.imgur.com/6yY66qh.png) - BABA is currently trading at the same price TODAY as in 2018, but have more than an extra $140 BILLION, over 200% increase on their balance sheet.\n\n[Over 50% YoY from last year WTF](https://i.imgur.com/ALZnJ60.png) - Their YoY revenue growth is not stopping. They are more than just an eCommerce platform, but have so many other businesses like cloud storage, payment services, e-mail, and the mammoth eCommerce business.\n\nIf you don't believe me, even Warren Buffet's bro, another value investor god, [Charlie Munger publicly disclosed his position in BABA when $BABA was around $220-$230](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/04/08/charlie-munger-just-bought-alibaba-stock-should-yo/). It's currently even cheaper.\n\n**Think about this for a second.** Amazon's success is actually Alibaba's success. For the uninitiated, more than 60% of all products sold on Amazon are through third party sellers called Amazon Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA). Do you know where they all source their products from? AliExpress. When you buy something on Amazon, you are indirectly supporting AliExpress's parent company, $BABA. Do you think Amazon is going up? well, that means Alibaba is going up too.\n\nDisclosure: This is not financial advice and I don't know what i'm talking about\n\ntl;dr: $BABA had an overreaction selloff since the end of last year. technicals &amp; fundamentals are indicating a trend reversal is imminent to head back to the moon.",

        "selftext": "I'm relatively new to options trading. I know that a common metric to determine whether options are overpriced is to compare historical volatility to implied volatility (with higher HV meaning underpriced and vice versa). The first graph below shows INTC's IV and 252-day HV MA, with a higher HV indicating options are underpriced. The second graph shows the IV 20-day HV MA, this time with a lower HV. Should I be using the 252 or 20-day averages when evaluating price, or does it depend on the situation? Alternatively, should I be using the moving average for IV here?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ytd17uu9xsd71.png?width=1590&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3e90e476ffe955f8031f0e19b9dadfc685fd74a5\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1kiz1i2hysd71.png?width=1435&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c6a34342d62269d0cb2a55f038b51203b15cb5ce",

        "selftext": "Fuck wsb\n\nHere is a Market Recap for today Friday, July 30, 2021\n\n**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, July 30, 2021**\n\nStocks fell Friday, reversing after yesterday\u2019s gains to cap off one of the choppier weeks we\u2019ve had in the market all year. The choppiness largely seems to stem from very erratic movements after-hours after companies report earnings. In my humble opinion, a lot of these movements seem like overreactions to me and represent nice opportunities. Moreover, this week market participants digested a weaker-than-expected print in GDP growth and the Federal Reserve\u2019s July Monetary Policy Report. \n\nDespite the volatility, all three major indexes closed the month higher, capping the six consecutive month of gains. As of today\u2019s close, the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) is up 18.04% year-to-date. Absolutely insane. On the other hand, the Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, continued it\u2019s streak of underperformance, closing the month 3.77% lower. \n\nCore personal consumption expenditures (PCE) grew at a faster year-on-year rate in June than in May, reflecting ongoing upward price pressures as demand surges during the recovery. The Bureau of Economic Analysis reported that core PCE grew 3.5% in June over last year, topping May's 3.4% rate. Still, however, this was less hot than the 3.7% pace consensus economists expected.\n\nYesterday, the US Bureau of Economic Analysis released its advanced estimate of second-quarter gross-domestic-product (GDP) growth. Despite accelerating from the first-quarter, economists were largely expecting a higher jump, despite consumer spending, the largest component of US economic activity, beating expectations. However, it seems market participants were not fazed. Here are the numbers:\n\n* **Q2 GDP, seasonally adjusted annualized quarter-over-quarter:** 6.5% vs. 8.4% expected and a downwardly revised 6.3% in Q1\n* **Personal consumption:** 11.8% vs. 10.5% expected and 11.4% in Q1\n* **Core personal consumption expenditures, quarter-over-quarter:** 6.0% vs. 6.1% expected and an upwardly revised 2.7% in Q1\n\nThe July Monetary Policy Report was largely reiterated the same thing it has been for the last 3-4 months, but did include did include some new language hinting that the economic recovery is getting closer to the Fed\u2019s stated goals. The statement read, \u201cLast December, the Committee indicated that it would continue to increase its holdings of Treasury securities by at least $80 billion per month and of agency mortgage\u2011backed securities by at least $40 billion per month until substantial further progress has been made toward its maximum employment and price stability goals. Since then, the economy has made progress toward these goals, and the Committee will continue to assess progress in coming meetings.\u201d\n\nMoreover, the Fed athe report did acknowledge potential risks and stated the Fed was ready to act if \u201cappropriate risks arise\u201d. The statement read, \u201cIn assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee's goals. The Committee's assessments will take into account a wide range of information, including readings on public health, labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments.\u201d\n\nRead the entire July FOMC statement here: [https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20210728a.htm](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20210728a.htm)\n\nThis week, the five largest companies in the market, Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), and Facebook (FB) all reported earnings. Despite all of them handily beating top-line estimates, a lot of them actually pulled back. Let\u2019s recap the numbers.\n\n**Microsoft (MSFT)**\n\n* **Revenue:** $46.15 billion versus $44.25 billion expected\n* **Earnings per share:** $2.17 versus $1.92 expected\n* **Productivity and Business Processes:** $14.69 billion versus $13.9 billion expected\n* **Intelligent Cloud:** $17.38 billion versus $16.4 billion expected\n* **More Personal Computing:** $14.09 billion versus $13.8 billion expected\n\n**Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL)**\n\n* **Earnings per share (EPS):** $27.26 vs $19.34 per share\n* **Revenue:** $61.88 billion vs $56.16 billion\n* **YouTube advertising revenue:** $7.00 billion vs $6.37 billion expected\n* **Google Cloud revenue:** $4.63 billion vs $4.40 billion expected, \n* **Traffic acquisition costs (TAC):** $10.93 billion vs $9.74 billion expected\n\n**Apple (AAPL)**\n\n* **EPS**: $1.30 vs. $1.01 estimated \n* **Revenue**: $81.41 billion vs. $73.30 billion estimated, up 36% year-over-year \n* **iPhone revenue**: $39.57 billion vs. $34.01 billion estimated, up 49.78% year-over-year \n* **Services revenue**: $17.48 billion vs. $16.33 billion estimated, up 33% year-over-year \n* **Other Products revenue**: $8.76 billion vs. $7.80 billion estimated, up 40% year-over-year \n* **Mac revenue**:$8.24 billion vs. $8.07 billion estimated, up 16% year-over-year \n* **iPad revenue**: $7.37 billion vs. $7.15 billion estimated, up 12% year-over-year \n* **Gross margin**: 43.3% vs. 41.9% estimated \n\n**Facebook (FB)**\n\n* **Earnings:** $3.61 per share, adjusted, vs. $3.03 per share expected\n* **Revenue:** $29.08 billion, vs. $27.89 billion expected\n* **Daily active users (DAUs):** 1.91 billion, vs. 1.91 billion expected\n* **Monthly active users (MAUs):** 2.90 billion, vs. 2.91 billion expected\n* **Average revenue per user (ARPU):** $10.12, vs. $9.66 expected \n\n**Amazon (AMZN)** \n\n* **Revenue:** $113.08 billion versus $115.06 billion expected\n* **EPS:** $15.12 versus $12.22 expected\n* **AWS revenue:** $14.81 billion versus $14.18 billion expected\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* This earning season is shaping to be another record-breaking quarter. As of Friday, 88% of S&amp;P 500 companies topped consensus earnings per share estimates, according to FactSet data. \n* As many as 125,000 people reported suffering Snapchat outages Thursday evening, as per industry tracker Downdetector.\n* Yesterday, was the highly anticipated IPO of Robinhood (HOOD), popular brokerage that has garnered a horrendous reputation among many retail traders, particularly those who invest in \u201cmeme stocks\u201d. Probably not the IPO they were hoping for, with the stock down almost 7% since it began trading\n* Personal income rose 0.1% in June month-on-month, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis' monthly report. Consensus economists were looking for a 0.3% monthly decline, according to Bloomberg data. In May, personal income fell 2.2%.\n* Boeing (BA) target raised by Wells Fargo from $244 to $254 at Equal-Weight. Stock currently around $226\n* Bio-Rad Laboratories (BIO) target raised by Wells Fargo from $735 to $930 at Overweight. Stock currently around $740\n* Comcast (CMCSA) with a host of target raises. Consensus price target $70 at Buy. Stock currently around $59\n* Deckers Outdoor (DECK) with a host of target raises. Consensus price target $500 at Buy. Stock currently around $411\n* Gilead Sciences (GILD) with two target raises. Stock currently around $68\n   * SVB Leerink from $74 to $77 at Outperform\n   * Royal bank of Canada from $81 to $84 at Outperform\n* Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) target raised by Raymond James from $136 to $140 at Buy. Stock currently around $120\n* LPL Financial (LPLA) target raised by Morgan Stanley from $195 to $202 at Overweight. Stock currently around $141\n* MasterCard (MA) with a host of target raises. Consensus price target $450 at Buy. Stock currently around $385\n* ArcelorMittal (MT) target raised by Deutsche Bank from $43 to $47 at Buy. Stock currently around $35\n* O\u2019Reilly Automotive (ORLY) target raised by Oppenheimer from $590 to $690 at Outperform. Stock currently around $603\n* STMicroelectronics (STM) target raised by Cowen from $49 to $52 at Outperform. Stock currently around $41\n* Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) with two target raises. Stock currently around $184\n   * B. Riley from $235 to $245 at Buy\n   * Needham &amp; Co. from $245 to $255\n\n\u201cIn my view, the biggest investment risk is not the volatility of prices, but whether you will suffer a permanent loss of capital. Not only is the mere drop in stock prices not risk, but it is an opportunity. Where else do you look for cheap stocks?\u201d - Li Lu",

        "selftext": "Coinbase ($COIN) will be a cash cow for years to come.\n\nIn Q1 alone they had $1.8B of revenue and $771M of profit (\\~43% margins). Q2 earnings are coming up the 8/20 expiry is looking juicy. My guess is that with an extremely volatile quarter for internet money, they will blow Q1 out of the water and we'll be above $300 by the end of July.\n\n**This is what I like about the stock:**\n\n1. Their trading commissions blow traditional brokerage houses out of the water\n2. Bid/ask spreads are wider than Strahan's gap tooth\n3. Fees are fat (and scale with transaction size)\n4. They just [unveiled](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-25/coinbase-expands-prime-brokerage-services-to-institutional-users) an institutional \"Prime\" service on 5/25 catering to corporations looking to diversify their balance sheets\n5. In addition to the \"exchange\" business, they're now lending, offering debit/credit card products, and soon will allow you to generate passive income by \"staking\" your assets (FYI this bullet alone encompasses the entire banking industry, Visa, Mastercard, JPM, BAML, etc.)\n6. Despite the big internet money dump, the key driver to trading activity is VOLATILITY - which causes lots of buying/selling, and we definitely had that in Q2\n\nTheir total addressable market is also massive and faux asset / internet money adoption is beating the trend of the *internet* when it came out.\n\n**This is what I hate about this stock:**\n\n1. There's an existential threat of fake assets flaming out like in 2017, even though this seems less likely with each passing day as more and more institutions hold internet money on their balance sheets and incorporate it into their remittance / payments infrastructure\n2. It's weird that Sat-oshi is unknown and still holds $35B of the core asset, making him the greatest hero but also the greatest threat if he/she/they/zir were to dump\n\nSo it's not necessarily a slam dunk but I'm betting fake assets continue to evolve from meme dog coins to real utility providers in the DeFi ecosystem. Also, this an ancillary business to the trading / brokerage side of the house: which is displacing business from Fidelity, Charles Schwab, CBOE, stock exchanges, etc. as people go digital.\n\nIn my opinion, DeFi is going to completely disrupt the banking system, and CB can take a leading role in monetizing that ecosystem. It simply doesn't make sense to store cash deposits yielding 0.01% at Chase when you can be earning 7-10% on cash in stable coins.\n\nTLDR: 7/16 250c's and 8/20 300c's\n\n[Oppenheimer raises $COIN PT to $444](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/coinbase-stock-gains-after-oppenheimer-analyst-gets-a-little-more-bullish-2021-07-07)\n\n2Q ER is August 12th\n\nClosing price 7/9: $253.88\n\n52W High: $429.54\n\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80",

        "selftext": " Payoneer is a payment platform that offers a way for businesses to pay and receive money, for a low fee. Payoneer believes that the total addressable market (defined as global e-commerce volume) is $26 trillion a year. Payoneer processed over $44 billion in 2020 alone.\n\nPayoneer also offers:\n\n* Accounting integrations\n* Capital to small businesses\n* Regulatory and compliance infrastructure\n* Physical debit cards\n* Tax solutions\n\n**Management Team**\n\nScott Galit - CEO of Payoneer, previously a senior VP at MasterCard. Serious financial services pedigree.\n\nMichael G Levine - CFO of Payoneer, ex-City VP and ex-CFO of Maler Technologies. MBA from Wharton.\n\nBetsy Cohen - CEO of FTOC. Tons of finance related experience, including founding Bancorp. Should be able to give Payoneer great advice for future growth.\n\n**Customers**\n\nPayoneer has some big name clients, including but not limited to:\n\n* Amazon Europe\n* Google\n* eBay\n* Walmart\n* Upwork\n* Fiverr\n\nPayoneer works with 9 of the top 20 most valuable companies. Alongside these big names, Payoneer also has 5 million+ marketplaces and businesses, across over 190 countries.\n\n**Switching Costs**\n\nIntegrating, setting up, and teaching staff how to use a new payment platform can be time-consuming and expensive for businesses. Therefore, when a client is set up on Payoneer, it is unlikely that they will switch to another provider. This is best seen by the &gt;100% volume retention that Payoneer has (i.e. customers stay and increase their payment volume).\n\n**Brand**\n\nPayoneer, from what I have seen, has a strong brand (though this is obviously a subjective factor). This idea is reinforced by the presence of their big name clients. Branding is really important in FinTech, businesses need 100% confidence when money and payments are involved. This offers not only stops entrants into their market, but should also facilitate future growth and customer acquisition.\n\n**Network Effect**\n\nImagine company A is on Payoneer and wants to pay company B. Company A suggests payment through their usual payment processor, Payoneer. Company B now signs up to Payoneer and decides to do all their payments through it etc. This is the network effect that Payoneer enjoys. This is a very powerful barrier to entry - very difficult to overcome, while also hard to create yourself.\n\n**Geographies**\n\nUNSUBSTANTIATED: Conversations on Reddit leads me to believe that Payoneer has a strong presence in Asia. If anyone has evidence, please put it in the comments.\n\nIf this is true, it should give Payoneer an edge in capitalising on the future growth of the emerging markets.\n\nSome evidence:\n\n* The CEO has gone on record saying Korea is one of their big market focuses.\n* Achieved triple digit growth each year in the asian markets from 2012-2016.\n\n**Valuation and Financials**\n\nAll numbers are based on original deal multiples (i.e based on when FTOC was $10 a share).\n\nEnterprise Value: $3.27 billion\n\nProjected 2021 revenue: $432 million\n\nEV/2021 revenue multiple: 7.6x\n\n2019-2020 revenue growth: 8.8%\n\n **Institutional Ownership**\n\nPayoneer has some institutional giants already invested, including Wellington Management, Dragoneer Investment Group, Fidelity Management and Research, Temasek, and Franklin Templeton.\n\n**Speculative Catalyst**\n\nIn ARK\u2019s Big Ideas 2021, FinTech was mentioned as a big theme that will prevail in 2021. If ARK were to add this cheap, promising FinTech firm to one of their funds, Payoneer will get the respect it deserves and will rocket upwards.\n\n**Risks**\n\n* There are many entrants in the payment processing industry, potentially driving down fees and increasing competition for customers\n* Revenue did not increase very much during 2020, despite a huge e-commerce boom\n* Big clients (which could be a large percentage of revenues) may drop Payoneer for some (hypothetical) reason\n\n**Personal Note**\n\n**Price Target**\n\nBull Case: $26\n\nMain Case: $21\n\nBear Case: $16\n\nHow did I get these numbers? Just educated guesses.\n\nAs always DYOR, I have linked the investor presentation in the sources, 100% worth a read.",

You should carefully consider the foregoing factors and the other risks and uncertainties described in the \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus (as defined below) and other documents filed by RAAC from time to time with the SEC. These filings identify and address other important risks and uncertainties that could cause actual events and results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. If any of these risks materialize or our assumptions prove incorrect, actual events and results could differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. There may be additional risks that neither RAAC nor Berkshire Grey presently know or that RAAC and Berkshire Grey currently believe are immaterial that could also cause actual events and results to differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements. In addition, forward-looking statements reflect RAAC\u2019s and Berkshire Grey\u2019s expectations, plans or forecasts of future events and views as of the date of this communication.

While RAAC and Berkshire Grey may elect to update these forward-looking statements at some point in the future, RAAC and Berkshire Grey specifically disclaim any obligation to do so, unless required by applicable law. These forward-looking statements should not be relied upon as representing RAAC\u2019s and Berkshire Grey\u2019s assessments as of any date subsequent to the date of this communication. Accordingly, undue reliance should not be placed upon the forward-looking statements.

        "selftext": "  \n\n1) Not only is Workhorse an innovative American technology company with outstanding growth (projected by analysts to be over 5000% year over year with the upcoming earnings report) but \n\n2) as the only last mile delivery electric vehicle, it is the only viable choice to meet President Biden's executive order which \"directs the federal agencies to procure carbon pollution-free electricity and clean, zero-emission vehicles\" for government fleets. Recall that the order states \"the Postal Service shall ensure that at least 75 percent of the total number of vehicles purchased using such funds shall be electric or zero-emission vehicles.\"\n\n3) It was unfairly removed from consideration in the USPS contract in favor of a defense contractor that \n\na) has never made a last mile delivery vehicle let alone an electric one \n\nb) was awarded the contract based on a prototype that was not subjected to required testing as Workhorses models were \n\nc) only promises to deliver \"up to 10%\" conversion of their combustion engine vehicles at some unspecified time \n\nd) had a $54 million insider stock buy (equal to their average trading volume for an entire day) in the after-market trading session the night prior to their surprise award of the contract\n\n4) **Workhorse's legal challenge to the likely fraudulent USPS award has now provided the Biden administration the legal path to remove Postmaster General DeJoy who has been in suspicion of fraud and is now a target of an FBI investigation. Workhorse argues that DeJoy's appointment violated the constitution as outlined in this video.** [USPS Violates Constitution? Workhorse Argues Yes! - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNsryX9mSr8)  \n\nIf there wasn\u2019t already enough reasons for me to pile into Workhorse stock on the future of this innovative American tech company with projected over 5000% year over year growth for this quarter\u2019s earnings call in a week or so, with one of the highest short interest IMO unfairly depressing this stock price and causing Ortex and other services to list $WKHS as the highest short squeeze alert category, **but now they are exposing government corruption and are providing the legal path to remove the corrupt Postmaster General DeJoy.** \n\nThis is not investment advice. \n\nBut I see an American innovator, electric vehicle and drone maker, fighting hedge fund shorts, fighting government corruption, and still achieving outstanding growth. So, I have gotten behind them as my largest holding. See below, I am holding 5400 $WKHS shares now at a $14.26 cost basis.  \n\n[My $WKHS position](https://imgur.com/a/tWykcOv)\n\nAdditional due diligence below. I believe in the long term prospects of what appears to me to be a great American technology innovator in an emerging market with huge upside growth possible.  \n \n\nTo be balanced, the stock has been beaten up badly this past month with short interest in the stock currently the 2nd highest reported according to Ortex and the decline in stock price the last few weeks has been accompanied by anywhere from 30% to 60% of the daily volume being short selling trying to drive away interest from the stock. This makes it one of the highest short squeeze targets in the market (highest short squeeze rating by Ortex and noted as such by several other financial services as well).  \n \n\nI like both that it could be an extremely explosive short squeeze AND that it is a very promising long term play with very exciting technologies being the only last-mile delivery EV in the market and has a patent and orders for their Horsefly delivery drone which is the only vehicle mounted drone launch and return.  \n \n\n* WKHS is clearly growing as it is hiring a ton of engineers.

        "selftext": "Recently, Bright Health Group landed on the New York Stock Exchange and made $924 million in its initial public offering. The IPO pricing values Bright Health at $11.23 billion, according to\u00a0[a report](https://www.reuters.com/legal/transactional/tiger-global-backed-bright-health-raises-924-mln-us-ipo-2021-06-24/)\u00a0from Reuters. The startup insurer initially priced its IPO at $18 per share, and issued 51.3 million shares. At present, Bright Health's stock price is $16.7 and the market value is $10.277 billion.\n\nFounded in 2015, Bright Health is a medical health insurance and technology company. Through cooperation with top suppliers in the medical system, it establishes connections between medical consumers and suppliers, and is committed to providing users with reasonable medical insurance solutions\u00a0and high-quality medical services through advanced technology.\n\nThe company raised $500 million in a late-stage funding round in September last year from investors such as Tiger Global Management, T. Rowe Price Associates and Blackstone Group Inc\u00a0[(BX.N)](https://www.reuters.com/companies/BX.N), bringing total equity raised to over $1.5 billion.\n\nIn 2020, Bright Health generated more than 1.2 billion U.S. dollars in revenue, an increase of more than three times compared with the 280 million U.S. dollars in 2019. The total revenue for the first quarter of 2021 was US$874.6 million. While revenue has increased, the company's losses have been expanding. From 2018 to 2020, the company lost 62.6 million U.S. dollars, 125.3 million U.S. dollars and 248.4 million U.S. dollars, respectively, and its net loss almost doubled.\n\n**Business Model: 2C+2B**\n\nBright Health runs two businesses, NeueHealth(2B)\u00a0and Bright HealthCare(2C). In particular, Bright HealthCare sells Medicare and commercial health insurance to about 623,000 consumers in\u00a014 states of\u00a0the United States. NeueHealth offers virtual and in-person clinical care to patients through affiliated primary care clinics.\n\n**Bright HealthCare: diverse strategies serve different groups of people**\n\nBright HealthCare offers health plans for individuals and families, small businesses and employees, and Medicare Advantage plans for seniors.\u00a0Five years ago, Bright Healthcare only offered a single product in one state, and the number of users was only 10,765. As of now, this department operates in 14 states across the United States, and plans to expand to more states by 2022.\n\nCurrently, Bright HealthCare provides health care benefits to approximately 623,000 consumers. Customers include: 1) Commercial customers. Bright HealthCare provides commercial health plans in 11 states, including personal and family plans and employer plans, serving approximately 515,000 people; 2) Medicare Advantage users. Bright HealthCare provides Medicare Advantage products in 11 states, serving approximately 108,000 people, usually focusing on high-risk groups with special needs.\n\nIn addition, Bright Healthcare operates a small Managed Medicaid business in California. Regarding self-funded employer support, Bright Healthcare is currently establishing ASO business (ASO, administrative services only) for self-paying employers through multiple strategic partners. Administrative services only (ASO) refers to an agreement that companies use when they fund their\u00a0[employee benefit plan](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/employer_sponsored_plan.asp)\u00a0but hire an outside vendor to administrate it. Bright Healthcare\u00a0believes that to continue expanding self-insurance market is\u00a0an important part of its diversification strategy. Bright HealthCare also participates in a number of specialized plans and is the nation\u2019s third largest provider of Chronic Condition Special Needs Plans (C-SNPs).\n\nFrom 2018 to 2020, Bright Healthcare\u2019s total premiums were US$127 million, US$272 million, and US$1.18 billion, with growth rates of 114.17% and 333.82%, respectively. The growth rate was tripled.\u00a0Its commercial insurance premium income was 111 million U.S. dollars, 236 million U.S. dollars, and 692 million U.S. dollars, with growth rates of 112.61% and 193.22%, respectively. Commercial premiums accounted for 87.64%, 86.77%, and 58.66% of total premiums, respectively, and their proportions dropped to about half in 2020. Medicare Advantage\u00a0premium income was 15.71 million U.S. dollars, 36.03 million U.S. dollars and 480 million U.S. dollars, with growth rates of 129.34% and 1232.42%, respectively. The growth rate in 2020 is particularly astonishing. MA premiums accounted for 12.36%, 13.23% and 41.34% of total premiums, respectively, and their proportions increased to nearly half in 2020.\n\nIn terms of users, the number of commercial users in 2020 was 145,000, and this number soared to 482,000 in the first quarter of 2021, an increase of 232.41%. The number of MA users was\u00a062,000, and reached 67,000\u00a0in the first quarter of 2021. Although Bright Health has achieved amazing growth in both premiums and the number of users, combined with its acquisitions, both the surge in users and the increase in premiums were driven by Bright Healthcare's acquisition of Brand New Day.  \n\n**NeueHealth: Healthcare services empower 2C business**\n\nNeueHealth is a comprehensive medical institution that provides local and personalized care services in a variety of ways. Its services include: \n\nIntegrated Care Delivery \u2014 Operating clinics that provide comprehensive care to all populations.\n\nBright Health Network \u2014Ecosystem of Care Partners.\n\nValue Services Organization \u2014 Empowering high-performing primary care practices and care delivery organizations to succeed in their evolution towards risk-bearing care delivery.\n\nIts income consists of two parts, namely service fees and premium income. Service fees\u00a0mainly refer to NeueHealth affiliated medical group\u2019s pay-for-service\u00a0income and\u00a0the network service income generated by Bright Health Network under NeueHealth; the premium income refers to NeueHealth\u2019s value service organization and its affiliated medical group\u2019s income from taking charge of patients\u2019\u00a0medical care.\n\nIn 2020, NeueHealth's service fee income was 29.35 million U.S. dollars, and premium income was 7.79 million U.S. dollars.\u00a0In the first quarter of 2021, service fee income increased by US$8.1 million year-on-year, reaching US$15.6 million, mainly due to the increase in revenue from the inter-company network contract service of the Bright HealthCare division. Premium income increased by US$26.7 million year-on-year, an increase of 1,330.8% to US$28.7 million. Similarly, the increase in revenue was driven by the acquisition of PMA.\n\nAs of April 2021, NeueHealth works with over 200,000 care provider partners and operates 28 managed and affiliated risk-bearing clinics within its integrated care delivery system. Through those risk-bearing clinics, NeueHealth maintains nearly 75,000 unique patient relationships as of April 2021, approximately\u00a030,000 of which are served through value-based arrangements, across multiple payors. In addition to the\u00a0directly managed and affiliated clinics, NeueHealth manages care for an additional 33 clinics through its Value Services Organization.\n\n**Competitive advantages: technology empowerment + extensive customer base + full chain**\n\nAfter summarizing Bright Health's business model, we found that the company's competitive advantages include: extensive customer base coverage, technological empowerment, and full-chain services.\n\nOn the customer side, Bright Healthcare offers plans covering all groups\u00a0of people. In particular, the currently developing Managed Medicaid business covers children and low-income groups; the personal and family plans in the business plan section cover self-employed and part-time groups; Medicare Advantage covers groups over 65 years old; and Employer ASO covers self-financing employer groups. At the same time, many of Bright Healthcare's professional programs target the chronically ill population.\u00a0In other words, regardless of customers\u2019\u00a0income, age, work or the way to obtain insurance, Bright Health can provide products or services in a direct or indirect manner.\n\nHowever, at present, Bright Healthcare\u2019s two largest customer groups are business plans and MA groups. Both in premium income and customer groups, business plans make up the most part. Products and services for other groups are still in their infancy, and the development of these product lines in the future will still require a lot of effort.\n\nIn technology, Bright Health\u00a0has developed\u00a0\u201cBright Health Intelligent Operating System\u201d or \u201cBiOS\u201d. It \u00a0refers to Bright Health\u2019s end-to-end intelligent technology platform comprised of consumer, care delivery, and administrative solutions, all designed to enable an integrated, aligned, and consumer-focused healthcare ecosystem.  \n\nBiOS uses the powerful data generated by Care Partner model to achieve integration of the healthcare system, including smart data center Consumer360 and the solution DocSquad for consumers and suppliers. \u201cConsumer360\u201d refers to Bright Health\u2019s proprietary intelligent data hub, which aggregates clinical and administrative data, as well as information derived from the consumer experience (i.e., from call center and other consumer interactions) and data relating to Social Determinants of Health. It could create a personalized digital care plan to empower DocSquad.  \n\n\n\u201cDocSquad\u201d refers to Bright Health\u2019s consumer and care provider solution, comprised of a purpose-built set of tools and experiences connecting consumers with the organizations responsible for their care, while giving providers a 360-degree view of a consumer to better manage their healthcare needs. Its services include virtual care, personalized care team, smart warning, and other healthcare services.\n\nAnother advantage of Bright Health is that\u00a0it both provides 2C and 2B services. On the one hand, it provides customers with Bright Healthcare\u00a0products, as well as customized and market-specific nursing services through NeueHealth's network and other healthcare providers. On the other hand, for business clients, NeueHealth helps healthcare providers gather consumers and provide care partners with multiple value propositions, while providing innovative tools and solutions to support population health management and development of value-based care. For payers, NeueHealth allows Bright HealthCare and other third-party payers to participate in value-based payment arrangements, while managing risk-bearing care delivery. It\u00a0provides payers with predictability of medical expenses, allowing them to focus more on benefit design and management.\n\nIn sum, Bright Health integrates financing and delivery of healthcare through the division and collaboration of the two departments, covering both payers\u00a0and suppliers. The payer\u2019s funding not only focuses on preventing losses, but also on creating overall consumer value and increasing access to medical care through effective resource allocation. Suppliers construct value-based arrangements that aim to reward the quality of care provided, rather than the number of services. It could\u00a0reduce the total cost of care and\u00a0improve\u00a0clinical outcomes.\n\n**Future challenges: loss doubles, and medical cost ratio increases**\n\nApart from\u00a0advantages, Bright Health is also facing some challenges. To achieve future development and even profitability, these challenges need to be overcome.\n\nFirst, the problem of customer groups. At present, the company's main customer base is divided into commercial\u00a0users and MA users. Commercial users\u2019,or personal insurance\u2019s\u00a0market share is relatively small, and the number of users in this market has grown rapidly after the enactment of Affordable Care Act. But in the later stage, the user group who cannot receive premium subsidies will have adverse selection.\u00a0The data shows that the total number of monthly registrations in the personal market increased from 10.6 million in 2013 to 17.4 million in 2015, reaching a peak, and then fell to 13.8 million in 2018. One reason is that from 2017 to 2018, insurance premiums rose sharply, and many people were unable to receive premium subsidies, so adverse selection occurred. Consistent with the number of users, operators that provide individual insurance plans have also seen a general trend of growth first and then decline, which also means that this market is very difficult for insurance companies.\n\nIn addition, there are many other participants in the personal insurance market, including Oscar Health, which went public not long ago. Although Bright Health claims to be able to compete with the former in terms of healthcare\u00a0networks, Oscar has 400,000 individual insurance members, just slightly less than that of Bright Health in personal insurance market.\n\nOn the other hand, the MA market is full of giants, and leading insurance companies occupy a large part of the market share, leaving Bright Health only a small part. Whether it is in personal\u00a0insurance or MA, customer acquisition\u00a0is quite\u00a0difficult, which is why Bright Health has adopted mergers and acquisitions to grow its customer base.\n\nAlthough Bright Health said it would expand to other customer groups, including self-funding\u00a0employer market and small business market, the development of these strategies is still in the early stages and has not been reflected in the company's financial data. In the future, much\u00a0resources must be invested, and even mergers and acquisitions and other means\u00a0will be necessary\u00a0to seize market share and customer base.\n\nIn addition, although Bright Health has both an insurance supply department and a medical service department, its medical cost ratio(MCR)\u00a0has been growing. From 2018 to 2020, the company's MCR\u00a0were 75.8%, 82.4% and 88.7%, which did not have any advantages compared with other companies. In other words, the company's efforts to control medical expenses through NeueHealth do not seem to have worked.\n\nThe company's operating costs have also been increasing. From 2018 to 2020, operating costs were US$95.83 million, US$180 million and US$410 million, respectively, with growth rates of 88% and 127%. With high medical expenses, coupled with increasing operating costs, the company still has a long way to go to achieve profitability.\n\nNevertheless, Bright Health is committed to controlling the entire value chain including users, payers and suppliers. This model is still a core competitiveness, which distinguishes it from competitors such as Oscar, and also reminds people\u00a0of United Health.\n\nWhat we can learn from Bright Health is its practice of complementing business through acquisitions. Bright Health turned NeueHealth into an independent department and constantly emphasizes the possibility of its future development. This differentiated department is built through continuous acquisitions. At present, 3% of the revenue contributed by this department is contributed by the acquisition department. Furthermore, the success of UnitedHealth Group is also on the basis of continuous acquisitions.\n\nAnother lesson\u00a0is the construction and integration of technology platforms. The intelligent\u00a0platform built by Bright Health integrates users, payers, and suppliers, and its solutions for suppliers or patients, such as applications, are based on this\u00a0platform. It aggregates\u00a0all user data and claims data to achieve transparent exchange and empowerment of data.\n\nBright Health\u2019s future is worth looking forward to.",

        "selftext": "**\u201cSpeed\u201d\u00a0in Sci-tech Area**\n\nIn the field of science and technology, Ping An has taken \"speed\" to the extreme. Several figures in the 2019 annual report also illustrated\u00a0this point. As of the end of December 2019, Ping An\u2019s number of technology patent applications increased by 9,112 from the beginning of the year, reaching a total of 21,383, ranking it among the forefront of international financial institutions. In particular, the number of invention patent applications accounted for nearly 96%, and the cumulative number of PCT and overseas patent applications reached 4,845.\n\nAt the beginning of 2019, Ping An changed its original logo \"Insurance\u00b7Bank\u00b7Investment\" to \"Finance + Technology\", and technology was more clearly defined as the core business that paralleled finance. \"Finance + Technology\" and \"Finance + Ecology\" have now become two words closely related to Ping An of China. While technology helps Ping An's financial business improve service efficiency, risk control, and reduce operating costs, it will also be applied to the creation of five ecosystems of \u201cfinancial services, medical and health care, auto services, real estate services, and smart cities\u201d.\n\nThrough the comprehensive financial business model of \"one customer, multiple products, one-stop service\", relying on localization advantages, Ping An implements international standard corporate governance and operation management, and will continue to promote the\u00a0concept of \u201ctechnology empowers finance, technology empowers ecology, and ecology empowers finance\u201d.\n\nWhen talking about the motivation for\u00a0Ping An\u2019s transformation, Chen Xinying, the co-CEO of Ping An Group, said: \u201cAt that time, we felt that technology might have a huge impact on the financial industry itself, and we also saw the rise of technology companies. So we decided to establish Ping An Technology, using technology to empower Ping An\u2019s main business.\u201d\u00a0Since then, Ping An has invested 1% of its annual revenue in technological innovation\u00a0each year, which will be\u00a0a long-term planning.\n\n\u201cTechnology empowers finance, technology empowers ecology, and ecology empowers finance\u201d\u00a0are precisely the three links of Ping An's technological development. In the first link,\u00a0technology empowers Ping An\u2019s core business finance; in the second link,\u00a0technology empowers ecosystems. The ecosystems\u00a0mentioned here are\u00a0that Ping An provides financial technology, medical technology, and smart cities to the entire market. In the\u00a0third link,\u00a0ecosystems\u00a0empower Ping An's financial business.\n\nObviously Ping An today\u2019s technological achievements are not made overnight\n\n**Technology empowers finance**\n\nGrowing from an insurance company into a giant, Ping An\u00a0spent the first ten years in insurance, the second in comprehensive finance, and the third in finance + technology.\n\nThe total revenue of Ping An's technology business in 2019 reached 82.1 billion yuan, a year-on-year increase of 27.1%. It can be seen that\u00a0its\u00a0strategy of \u201ctechnology empowers finance and ecology\u201d\u00a0has achieved remarkable results. Speaking of Ping An\u2019s future, Ma Mingzhe stated that in the new year, Ping An\u2019s determination to actively\u00a0research\u00a0cutting-edge technology would not be changed, and Ping An would\u00a0continue to promote technological innovation and firmly adopt intelligent and data-based operations.\n\n**AI empowers major business - finance**\n\nPing An's technology has developed rapidly, and its achievements have naturally been applied to the main business of finance. According to the recently released annual report, we can see that technology has enabled life insurance business to achieve remarkable results.\n\nIn terms of agent interviews, the coverage rate of AI interviews for agents reaches 100%. Big data technology could describe\u00a0agents\u00a0accurately and match personalized training. AskBob, an intelligent personal assistant dedicated to agents, has served 340 million people since its launch, helping improve agents\u2019 conversion efficiency.\n\nIn terms of risk control, Ping An uses cutting-edge technology to empower analysis engines and\u00a0improve the quality and efficiency of risk control. In particular, AI post-loan management covers 100% of non-overdue customers\u2019\u00a0reminding, with per capita loan scale reaching 54 million yuan, an increase of 32% from the beginning of the year. Enterprise intelligent early warning system can dynamically monitor corporate credit risks, with more than 3000 early warnings throughout the year, reaching\u00a0an accuracy rate of 92%. The amount of risk exposure involved is nearly 20 billion yuan.\n\nIn addition, Ping An Property\u00a0Insurance\u00a0uses leading AI image loss assessment technology and accurate customer profile technology to launch a \u201ctrust claim\u201d\u00a0service for car owners with good safe driving behaviors, providing trust credits to 45 million car owners. Technology has helped Ping An\u2019s business to maintain excellent quality, achieving operating profit of 20.952 billion yuan, a year-on-year increase of 70.7%, and a comprehensive cost ratio of 96.4%.\n\n**Technology empowers ecology**\n\nNow that Ping An of China has entered\u00a0its fourth ten years, in addition to its\u00a0amazing technological development, another strategy of Ping An - Finance + Ecology is also being practiced in an orderly manner. The above\u00a0mentioned that apart from\u00a0financial services, Ping An\u2019s five ecosystems also include healthcare, real estate, automobiles, and smart cities.\n\nSo why ecosystems? About\u00a0this question, Chen Xinying replied that the biggest reason should be customer needs. Finance is only part\u00a0of life, and finance itself has to be embedded into life scenes. The reason for choosing these five ecosystems is because they\u00a0are very important to customers and the economy as a whole. They are all part of our lives.\n\n**Medical ecosystem**\n\nIn fact, China\u2019s\u00a0current population aging is serious, and the number of doctors is far from enough. In order to increase the productivity of doctors, Ping An has developed AI intelligent aid\u00a0diagnostic doctors. This \"little assistant\" has learned all medical textbooks and can read cases based on the experience of domestic clinicians, greatly improving the efficiency of diagnosis and treatment.\n\nIn addition, Ping An Health Cloud, as an online health consultation and management APP under Ping An, relying\u00a0on its own medical team and self-developed AI-aided\u00a0diagnosis and treatment system, covers\u00a07\u00d724 online consultation, health management, prescription, referral, making appointment,\u00a0second diagnosis and treatment opinions,\u00a01-hour delivery of medicines, and other full-process services.\n\nAs of December 31, 2019, Ping An Health Cloud\u00a0has accumulated more than 315 million registered users. In December, the number of active users reached 66.9 million, making it China's largest Internet medical and health service platform. During the pandemic, the number of new registered users of its APP increased by 10 times, and the average daily consultation volume of new users reached 9 times the usual.\n\nIn December 2019, Ping An Health Cloud established\u00a0cooperation with Fuzhou Municipal Health Commission of Fujian Province, and would\u00a0be responsible for construction and operation of the Fuzhou Internet Hospital Service Platform. The platform would include five modules: online diagnosis and treatment, prescription circulation, health management, data management and back end\u00a0management. After its launch, it would\u00a0serve local citizens, and the model could\u00a0also be replicated and promoted to other parts of the country.\n\nAs a leading company in the industry, Ping An Health Cloud\u00a0uses\u00a0AI\u00a0technology to empower government, and thereby to promote\u00a0construction of China's Internet medical industry.\n\n**Car ecosystem**\n\nAs the second largest auto insurance company, Ping An has worked hard in the auto ecosystem.\n\nIn 2005, the Autohome under Ping An of China was established. As one of the most visited auto websites in the world, Autohome provides consumers with one-stop services such as car selection, car purchase, and car use.\n\nAs to why Autohome was established, Chen Xinying said that on the one hand, Ping An hoped\u00a0to provide more comprehensive services. On the other hand, Autohome is not only an online information platform, but\u00a0also needs to be integrated with offline\u00a0business.\n\nTherefore, in recent years, Ping An has made use of its own advantages and is committed to empowering the cloud platform of 4S stores and OEMs through technical data analysis. In 2019, more than 17,000 dealers purchased the data products of Autohome. This on the one hand deepens the user-side scenario, and on the other hand it brings offline participants closer together, which greatly promotes development of the automotive ecosystem.\n\nIn 2019, Autohome achieved operating income of 8.421 billion yuan, a year-on-year increase of 16.4%. In particular, online marketing business revenue was 1.491 billion yuan, accounting for 17.7%, and the proportion increased by 5.9% year-on-year. Net profit was 3.409 billion yuan, a year-on-year increase of 10.7%.\n\n**Smart city ecosystem**\n\nCompared with earlier domestic smart cities, Ping An\u2019s strength lies in software. Therefore, Ping An pays more attention to how to use technology to help cities improve the efficiency of government management and how to provide residents with more convenient and efficient services.\n\nIn January 2019, Shenzhen's unified government service app \"iShenzhen\", built by Ping An Smart City, was officially launched. As the contractor, Ping An Smart City team organically combined\u00a0Ping An\u2019s leading blockchain technology with citizen services to provide citizens with a full range of government and life services such as government affairs services, transportation, medical and health\u00a0care. It is intended to create a four-in-one mobile service platform for government, society, enterprises and citizens. Not only in Shenzhen, Ping An now provides smart city services to 115 cities, involving more than 200 projects.\n\nPing An now operates technology businesses through Lufax Holdings, OneConnect, Ping An Health Cloud, Ping An HealthKonnect, Autohome and other companies. As of December 31, 2019, OneConnect, Ping An Health Cloud\u00a0and Autohome have\u00a0been listed.\u00a0Lufax Holdings and Ping An HealthKonnect\u00a0have completed external financing. The total valuation of Ping An\u2019s technology companies reached US$69.1 billion.\n\nPing An continues to explore new business models in the fields of finance and healthcare, and is committed to achieving the goals\u00a0of feeding back the main financial business, empowering industry upgrades, and serving the real economy.",

Katapult is the only pure-play financing platform dedicated to Ecommerce, as shown below:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rjuc35coft871.png?width=640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d22f897955d25ad8dd93d1f1a66fa226c08cba32\n\nSource: Initial Investor Presentation\n\nAccording to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, 38% of US consumers are considered nonprime, making it difficult for these consumers to access financing options. Additionally, 67% of consumers with a FICO score below 700 need a BNPL option for large purchases. Katapult provides this solution for online customers. Katapult's platform integrates seamlessly to merchant sites, so customers can choose the financing option as they check out.\u00a0\n\nConsumers are given three payment options through Katapult:\n\n* **First 90 Days**  \n\n   * Customers only pay the cash price + a 5% fee.\n* **After 90 Days**  \n\n   * Customers can complete the purchase at a significant discount to the full lease-to-own cost.\n* **Full Lease Term**  \n\n   * Payment is \\~2x the lease origination amount over the life of the lease.\n\nKatapult is partnered with merchants such as Wayfair, Lenovo, Purple, and Motorola. The company also has partner integrations with Ecommerce platforms like Shopify, BigCommerce, and OpenCart. Katapult gives online platforms access to larger customer bases and higher repeat purchase rates (45%).\u00a0\n\nKatapult also uses a \"waterfall\" method to gain customers that failed prime lending applications. When consumers fail to get financing from prime lenders like Affirm, they are passed on to Katapult.\u00a0\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jpcbpo9pft871.png?width=640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c8b4791b3ff9896f31abd9590288794f9c2d320f\n\n*Source: Investor Presentation*\n\nAs you can see from the graph above, Katapult approves \\~60% of consumers who failed prime lender applications. These \"waterfall\" applicants generate $117M incremental originations per 1M applications.\n\nKatapult's risk model reviews over 100 attributes, including lease history, prior payment behavior, and behavioral biometrics, to approve or deny applicants in under five seconds. The company has a sub-3% fraud rate across its portfolio, and it recovers 80- 90% of lease costs of charge offs.\n\nKatapult has also gotten more efficient as its platform has grown.\u00a0\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/unnh0l7qft871.png?width=640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fac474589c2380cb0938e7b0d46ad8e78a8a1103\n\n*Source: Investor Presentation*\n\nIndexed return on leases have increased each year as Katapult's customer base has expanded.\n\nQ1 Performance\n\nAs mentioned earlier, Katapult went public through a reverse merger. Reverse mergers are notorious for providing and falling short of aggressive revenue projections. Here are Katapult's projections from December.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5m7ntn9rft871.png?width=640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=903d916097cfb87bb9fe6a28bdf4d3410d322aa6\n\n*Source: Investor Presentation*\n\nNow let's see how the company performed. Katapult released Q1 earnings yesterday. The company did $82M in revenue, up 88% year over year. Net income was $8.1M, or a 120% increase from Q1 last year. Adjusted EBITDA was $14.7M, good for a 122% increase over last year too.\n\nHow about forward guidance?\u00a0\n\n* Gross Originations: $375-$425 million\n* Revenue: $425-$475 million\n* Adjusted EBITDA: $50-$60 million\n\nWhile the EBITDA target dropped slightly, revenue and originations are in line with December's projections.\n\nRelationship with Wayfair\n\nOne metric that stood out to me was the acceleration of originations from non-Wayfair merchants. 58% of Katapult's revenue came from Wayfair in 2020. However, in Q1 2021, Non-Wayfair originations were up 87.4%. This is compared to a 66% increase in Q4 2020 and 46.1% for FY 2020. Meanwhile, Wayfair originations were up 57.7%. Recent execution suggests that Katapult is making great strides to diversify its revenue streams.\n\nWhile Wayfair is still the company's largest source of income, Katapult CEO Orlando Zayas is not concerned. In a recent interview, he said this about their parternship with Wayfair:\n\n\"*I\u2019m not worried about it because if you\u2019re going to have a partner to have high concentration right now, Wayfair is a great partner to have. So we\u2019re really thrilled with their relationship. And the relationship is pretty deep too. We\u2019re actually in the process of doing a direct integration with them so that, you know, the tentacles, if you will, within the company are a lot tighter, and then we have a two year agreement with them. \\[\u2026.\\] So, you know, am I worried about it? No, because it\u2019s a great retailer. And I think our relationship is very strong, but, you know, I would like to minimize it and have, you know, five or six Wayfairs and a bunch of other smaller ones.*\"\n\nWith Katapult hinting at a deeper partnership with the furniture retailer, and the company showing accelerated growth in its non-Wayfair base, I am not too concerned with the heavy revenue concentration.\n\nValuation Gap\n\nValuation is the driving factor in my Katapult bull thesis. The stock is dirt cheap. While several reverse mergers have priced deals at sky-high valuations, KPLT went public at a $1B valuation with $450M in 2021 revenue.\u00a0\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s8wz8gbtft871.png?width=640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=db269053f7e8e661f0efe2bb871059e8feca8158\n\n*Source: Investor Presentation*\n\nThe graphic above comes from the December investor presentation. 14x EBITDA for a company growing sales, net income, and EBITDA at \\~100% for the last three years is great value by itself. When you compare this to other companies in the sector, Katapult looks criminally undervalued.\u00a0\n\nLet's look at the valuation gap now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kft0oa7uft871.png?width=640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=14b451c5c8afc295d37c65b25e5328b7cf53f536\n\nAt Tuesday's $11.37 price, Katapult was trading at 2.7x sales and 22.3x EBITDA. That's less than 1/3 of PayPal's (PYPL) revenue multiple and 1/2 of Paypal's EBITDA multiple, despite growing revenue 3x faster. When compared to Affirm (AFRM), a more direct competitor, the valuation gap is even larger. Push that valuation out to 2022, and KPLT is 8x EBITDA and 1.5x revenue. That's a value-stock price for a hypergrowth company.\n\n22.4x revenue for an unprofitable company growing at 40%, vs. 2.7x revenue for a profitable company growing at 65%. If Katapult went public through a traditional IPO, it would be worth over $2B right now. Because it used a reverse merger, sentiment around the stock has been poor.\n\nGrowth Prospects\n\nA study from Juniper Research suggests that BNPL transactions will grow from $226B in 2021 to $995B by 2026. 55% of Americans used a BNPL option as of March 2021, vs. just 37% in July 2020. There will be room for a lot of winners in this market, and Katapult will be one of them.\n\nKatapult is forecasting over $1B in revenue by 2023, and the company could beat this number if it keeps aggressively expanding to include new merchants. Katapult added 26 new retail partners in Q1 alone. Additionally, Katapult will benefit from the growth of its current partners like Wayfair.\n\nHere's the deal: there has been no sell-side coverage on this stock yet. When IBs start initiating coverage, it's going to moon. \"Price target $35 based on XYZ estimates\". You want to front run those releases. This a millionaire-making stock. When valuation is expensive, execution has to be perfect. When valuation is cheap? Any good news is a catalyst. I am giving you a $30 stock for $11. Don't miss it.\n\nRisks\n\nLike any investment, Katapult has its fair share of risks. The primary risk factors are:\n\n* Customer concentration\n* Credit risk from nonprime consumers\n* Competitors entering the nonprime market\n\nWhile Wayfair is still the company's largest customer, Katapult has been growing its non-Wayfair revenue base at an accelerating rate. Management assured investors that Wayfair would be a partner for a long time, so I don't foresee this risk causing any issues with business in the short term. Katapult has also been able to post consistent profits while dealing with nonprime customers, and its risk model has proven to be more accurate as the customer base expands. Finally, I don't see Affirm or another competitor taking market share from Katapult. KPLT has a multi-year head start in this market niche, and it has been able to scale its operations profitably. While other companies could enter this sector in the future, the total addressable market is large enough to accommodate multiple players.\u00a0\n\nConclusion\n\nStop chasing stocks that already peaked, and get in early for once. Katapult is a criminally undervalued stock given its growth rate and competitors' valuations, and I think it should be trading around $25 per share at the minimum. As we move further away from the reverse merger, Katapult will trade on its own merit, and I think the stock will appreciate accordingly. Assuming Katapult continues to scale its revenue and expand its customer base, I think the stock has a massive growth runway. I'm long shares, and I plan to hold them for a while.",
