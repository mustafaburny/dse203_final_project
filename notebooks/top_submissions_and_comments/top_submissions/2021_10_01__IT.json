        "selftext": "So I was completely unaware of the issues with Southwest Airlines until late Sunday night. If you don't know what's going on, Southwest cancelled 1,800 flights over the weekend leaving their customers in chaos.\n\nThe company narrative is that this was due to weather and air traffic control issues. However, some quick googling revealed [this little gem](https://onemileatatime.com/news/southwest-airlines-operational-meltdown/) of an article. In summary, on Friday the pilot's union asked a court to block Southwest from enforcing the vaccine mandate and an unusual number of pilots called in sick over the weekend. Coincidence? Looks mighty suspicious to me.\n\nThere's also recently been a story of [hundreds of LA firefighters threatening to sue over the mandate](https://ktla.com/news/local-news/hundreds-of-l-a-city-firefighters-file-notice-of-intent-to-sue-over-covid-vaccine-mandate/) and [New York expecting to have to call in the National Guard over nursing shortages](https://www.npr.org/2021/09/26/1040780961/new-york-health-care-worker-vaccine-mandate-staffing-shortages-national-guard). Without giving away too much personal information, I also happen to work for a large employer that would fall under the federal mandate. I can personally attest that there are enough employees refusing to take the vaccine that it will result in the shutting down of some critical operations.\n\nThe market is already looking weak going into winter, and maybe economic disruption from vaccine protests will be what pushes it over the edge.",

        "selftext": "How I plan to **Short Tesla ($TSLA)** with a max of **$1,000,000.** Then, walk away with roughly +$300K-$500K in profits. Or, I will walk away with lower profits if Tesla crashes before any of the next steps shared below.\n\nHere is my current short position: **Step 1:**  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i1z93h9xffw71.jpg?width=1242&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=47b828402fbf3b681459a963182519ea7729ae87\n\n\u2705 **Step 1/Position Started:**   \nCurrent Average: $1,070.14  \nCurrent Cost Basis: -$200,117.03\n\n\u2705 **Step 2**  \nShort at: $1,200\\~  \nAmount: $200K\\~   \nShares to buy: 166\\~  \nNew Cost Basis: $400,117.03\\~  \nNew Average: $1,131.20\\~\n\n\u2705 **Step 3:**  \nShort at: $1,500\\~  \nAmount: $400K\\~  \nShares to buy: 266\\~  \nNew Cost Basis: $800,117.03\\~  \nNew Average: $1,289.68\\~\n\n\u2705 **Step 4/Optional:**  \nShort at: $1,700\\~  \nAmount: $200K\\~  \nShares to buy: 117\\~  \nNew Cost Basis: $1,000,117.03\\~  \nNew Average: $1,354.91\\~\n\nI plan to cash out after a -30% drop, maybe ill aim for a 50% drop which means Tesla would be either at $949.44 for a -30%. Or, $677.45 for the -50%. This leaves Tesla with room to run from its current position of $1,100 a 23% gain to the final breakeven point or, 54% to the final optional step.   \n\n\n**Worst Case:**   \nTesla runs up from my even price of $1,354.91 to $2,100 a $2.1 Trillion Market Cap. I'll take a half a million dollar loss which I can afford all day, any day. Won't kill me. (-50%).  \n\n\n\u270d\ufe0f**Note:**  \nIf Tesla doubles from its current price, it will be worth more than Apple and Microsoft by $1 Trillion Dollars.  I strongly believe the ROI for new buyers is dramatically decreasing. In other words, the Greater Fool is running low/near the end. There is too much risk, too many emotions, and greed flowing around. Be fearful when others are greedy. In this case, ill profit from their beyond delusional greed. Or, Tesla is currently at peak levels and I don't even get to the next steps. Still a win.   \n\n\n\\- Charlie",

They\u2019ll be paying you even more for owning their shares because they have such great cash flow. The market opens today, they\u2019re down over 5%. MA, which reports tomorrow morning, is down 6% with it. One could assume they\u2019ll have pretty similar earnings and revenue. Maybe even up their dividend too (don\u2019t hold your breath for that one, but who knows). But Tesla, a company who has sold patents, licensing, and Bitcoin to pad their balance sheet for specific quarters, so that their earnings look better to the common shareholder, went up 12% because a company that was on the brink of  bankruptcy pulled a publicity stunt saying they\u2019d buy 100K cars. \n\nThese are just examples of what is happening as a whole in our market.

The top 1% gained over $6.5 trillion in corporate equities and mutual fund wealth during the Covid-19 pandemic, while the bottom 90% added $1.2 trillion, according to the latest data from the Federal Reserve. The share of corporate equities and mutual funds owned by the top 10% reached the record high in the second quarter, while the bottom 90% of Americans held about 11% of stocks, down from 12% before the pandemic. The stock market, which has nearly doubled since the March 2020 drop and is up nearly 40% since January 2020, was the main source of wealth creation in America during the pandemic \u2014 as well as the main driver of inequality. The total wealth of the top 1% now tops 32%, a record, according to the Fed data. Nearly 70% of their wealth gains over the past year and a half \u2014 one of the fastest wealth booms in recent history \u2014 came from stocks.\n\n\u201cThe top 1% own a lot of stock, the rest of us own a little,\u201d said Steven Rosenthal, senior fellow, Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center. The growing concentration of wealth comes despite millions of new investors coming into the stock market for the first time during the pandemic, leading to what many have labeled \u201cthe democratization\u201d of stocks. Robinhood added more than 10 million new accounts over the past two years and now has more than 22 million \u2014 many of them held by younger, first-time investors. Yet while the market may be owned more broadly, the gains and wealth it creates are not being more widely distributed. Rosenthal said that while the army of new investors may be numerous, they are also still small, with the average account size at Robinhood at about $4,500. When markets rise, they will have far smaller dollar gains than wealthier investors with hundreds of thousands or even millions in stock holdings.\n\n\u201cMany of the younger investors also bought in at higher prices, compared to bigger investors who have been in the market for years and see larger gains,\u201d Rosenthal said. What\u2019s more, many of the new investors have more of a trading mentality \u2014 buying and selling stocks rapidly, with leverage, in hopes of quick gains. While the strategy can create big winners, others may see lower returns than those of investors who simply buy and hold for the long term. The top 10% saw the value of their stocks gain 43% between January 2020 and June of 2021, according to the Fed. The bottom 90% saw stock wealth rise at a lower rate \u2014 33%. \u201cThey might account for a larger share of trading activity, but that\u2019s different from ownership and wealth,\u201d Rosenthal said.",

You subconsciously believe 100% runups in 15 months is fairly normal. \n\nEvergrande is not a fucking joke we should sit across the globe from and laugh about. Evergrande is the tip of the iceberg, and the housing market in China will collapse. In China, housing is 33% of GDP. In the U.S., it's 6.2%. You can't put 2 and 2 together? Tens, maybe hundreds of millions of workers in China will lose their jobs as the economy tries to adapt to the fact that housing is worth half of what they thought. Those with capital in the property market (90% of the pop) will realize their paper wealth is (again) worth half of what they thought, and stop spending as much on their iPhones and French designer apparel and Model S's, causing a global recession. Those who lent to China corporations, probably aren't getting their money back, they are fucked too. Contagion is real. \n\nAssuming they don't pay their offshore bond payment, Evergrande will become in default on September 23 (9 days). Probably mid-next week the media will finally start talking about it again. Fear will finally kick in in the markets and we will see more blood. \n\nWhy isn't the market pricing this in yet? Guess what, this same thing happened in the 2008 housing crash. Half of the smart money kept the price up while they slowly dumped their bags and even shorted the housing market. Just watch the Big Short again, there is a substantial period where swaps are not priced properly even as defaults skyrocket, as various investment banks try to get ahead of the crisis and \"head for the exit in a crowded theater.\"\n\nIMO, the people who are going to hurt the most are the thetards who have been selling naked puts and making bank for the past year and don't realize how exposed they really are. Are you fucking kidding me? Retail selling options in masse is a recipe for disaster. I hope they at least used spreads. Volatility is way undervalued given all the near-term concerns and it's entirely possible for some of the big ticker names out there to drop 50% over the next 3-12 months. Margin calls will fuel the downward spiral. This time, the public isn't going as supportive of JPOW's money printer because they'll be sick of inflation.\n\nLet me put this in a way for you to understand. \n\nSeptemBEAR. OctoBEAR. NovemBEAR. DecemBEAR.\n\nSome of my positions: \n\nPUTS on HSBC, ARKK, TSLA, SPX  \nCALLS on YANG and COIN  \nLong PFE, DISCK, XOM, FB\n\nComing to you on a green day.

        "selftext": "Note: This is a DD for Peloton\u2019s earnings report next week. I\u2019m posting it today since I already typed it up, but I can\u2019t predict how Peloton will move in the next week. Take your positions early at your own risk.\n\nNote on quarters: Peloton\u2019s financial quarter differs from our calendar. Their upcoming report will be for Q1 2022, covering July \u2013 September 2021. When I refer to their \u201cfull-year guidance\u201d, this covers the months July 2021 \u2013 June 2022.\n\n**Situation:**\n\nPeloton is a Covid stock darling that has retraced significantly from its ATH. Their report for Q4 2021 (covering April \u2013 June 2021) could be considered their first post-Covid earnings report, and disappointed the market. Based on the guidance they provided, I think they will also underperform the lowered expectations in this quarter, and cut full-year guidance.\n\n**Peloton business:**\n\nPeloton earns money in two main ways: Selling low-margin hardware like their Bike and Tread (70% of revenue) and selling high-margin subscriptions to their library of workout videos (30% of revenue).\n\nPeloton has two types of subscribers: Connected Fitness (CF) subscribers (those who own a Bike or Tread) who pay USD \\~40 per month, and digital subscribers (those who only use the app) who pay \\~USD 10 per month. The former type is far more important for their revenue and profits, although the digital subscribers are considered an important acquisition funnel for future CF subscribers.\n\n**Peloton gives optimistic guidance for 2022:**\n\nOn their most recent earnings call, Peloton gave a few pointers to their expected full year performance. I\u2019m going to use these to triangulate expectations for subscription revenue and hardware revenue for the full year.\n\nHere are the cold hard expectations we know from management: full-year revenue of 5.4 billion (800 million in Q1), 3.63 million Connected Fitness subscribers (2.47m in Q1). On the call they indicated that they expect Q2 and Q3 combined to be 60% of their annual revenue.\n\nBased on this I constructed the following table. Numbers in black are given by management, numbers in blue are my deductions/triangulations.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/chsqcr80buv71.png?width=942&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bb493cb01e016d0ae1ef3931b3da5bb1b2fff046\n\nIn this context I think it\u2019s interesting to look at Hardware revenue over time, starting January 2020, their last \u201cpre-covid\u201d quarter.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3jdg1ry0buv71.png?width=735&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3deb66ef8cd6734b4bb6e885719b3ac80b5c8483\n\nOrange: upcoming quarter; green: future FY 2022 quarters\n\nThis chart reveals something interesting: while Peloton expects relatively weak sales in the upcoming quarter (17% y-o-y decrease) they assume that ALL THREE future quarters will significantly outperform the respective quarter from 2020 (covid year) in order to hit their full-year guidance. In total, they expect hardware revenue from October 2021 \u2013 June 2022 to increase 34% compared to the period from October 2020 \u2013 June 2021. Considering the they just decreased the price of their flagship Bike by 20%, this implies that they will sell **40-50% MORE** units this upcoming year than they did during the Covid year. I\u2019m not a scientist but I find this staggeringly unlikely. In the next chapter I\u2019m going to show a few data points that bolster my disbelief in this bold guidance.\n\n**I don\u2019t think they\u2019re going to hit these guidance numbers, guys**\n\nApp downloads\n\nPeloton\u2019s app downloads show a tale of two cities. On the \u201ctop grossing\u201d chart (= how many people sign up for Peloton subscriptions through Apple), Peloton has been extremely steady for 1 year. This is a proxy for existing subscribers. The numbers reflect the extremely high satisfaction of existing subscribers and their fantastically low churn (significantly below 1% per month). People who signed up for Peloton during Covid don\u2019t seem to be quitting. So far so good.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sttxplq5buv71.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fe07fa4a0436ef1ee69927bc337a39d2999786f2\n\nThe \u201cfree chart\u201d (how many people download the app) shows a very different picture. This is a proxy for  new subscribers and new hardware sales. This number unsurprisingly peaked in April 2020 and was strong through 2020 due to Covid. It absolutely nosedived in April 2021 (right around the time vaccines became widely available in NY and California, two of Peloton\u2019s biggest markets). Since then, Peloton has almost completely dropped off the app charts, meaning that they are acquiring very few new users. Everyone who buys Peloton hardware is all but required to also download the app on their phone. Remember how they expect future hardware sales to be much higher than they were during 2020? Hmmmm.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fmkx1qa6buv71.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=af062a2beeeefde43cf57d185f5ec9fcadf16992\n\nSubscriber additions\n\nNet Digital subscriber additions (those who use the app but don\u2019t own hardware) were negative in the most recent quarter, for the first time since Peloton went public. Peloton considers this an important funnel for customer acquisition \u2013 if the number of people trying out their digital subscription decreases, you\u2019d logically also expect the number of people buying hardware to decrease.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3gk2riw6buv71.png?width=724&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=95e55ebca10db52d32990a7d782c0a190d1f8872\n\nReddit follower additions\n\nThe biggest Peloton subreddit is adding fewer and fewer subscribers this year, compared to 2020. Kind of the opposite of what you\u2019d expect from a company that wants to sell more hardware than ever before.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lye47ui7buv71.png?width=716&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=69a5b3391b2eb76488b0360854ebe4901aac9223\n\nTread popularity\n\nDespite the infamous safety incidents in 2021, Peloton has been pushing the Tread very hard, acting as if it will become as popular as their Bike and even claiming that many people who already own a bike would buy a Tread \\*in addition\\*. The numbers speak a different language. The share of running classes (black color) taken decreased significantly in FY 2021 \u2013 this despite the fact that anyone can take a running class, even if they don't own the hardware.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xfmg0038buv71.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3b6631cce03f7f19f6a9deae946ab6e517cea538\n\nHigh inventory, low customer deposits\n\nDuring 2020, Peloton sold essentially every singe bike they were able to produce, and customers had to wait up to 3 months for delivery. This has moderated \\*significantly\\* in the most recent quarter. Customer deposits (money received from customers for hardware that wasn\u2019t delivered yet) was at an all-time low. This indicates a significant relaxation in demand. Peloton significantly increased their supply chain ability during Covid, and it looks to me like they overinvested. In 2020 there was a huge rush to grab one of their products. In 2021, you can basically order one and get it delivered almost immediately. Given this relaxation in demand, I find it very unlikely that they would be able to actually deliver more product than last year\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/16fmynebbuv71.png?width=722&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bfd45634f2586cd7fb9b281fb80838a40672bd12\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Summary**\n\nPeloton has lofty goals for 2022 and I don\u2019t think they can fulfill them. Existing subscribers are clearly extremely happy and stick with them (I\u2019m one of them), but they are having big trouble expanding to new customers outside of the coastal elites. Even in other \u201crich\u201d countries like Australia and Germany, Google Trends and app download data point towards significant demand decrease after an initial period of hype, despite costly marketing campaigns (including TV ads during prime time).\n\nWhile Peloton is still valued like a growth stock (\\~6 P/S ratio, despite not expecting to be profitable until 2023), I think expectations are too high. I expect them to cut full-year guidance during the next earnings call, leading the stock to tank.\n\n**Positions**\n\n\\~20k put YOLO, expiring the week of their earnings.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ynh4y9hdbuv71.png?width=500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6e82ac4dc0a44720ebf1e2f2a59f93b8d79bdeaa\n\n**Risk factors:**\n\n\u00b7 I\u2019ve been known to be wrong before",

        "selftext": "Tesla's valuation is probably one of the most hotly debated topics in the stock market these past few years. Tesla is certainly richly valued, and sentiments like \"Tesla has a higher market cap than all other automakers combined\" or \"Tesla has decades of growth priced in\" are very prevalent, especially on this sub.\n\nThat said, I noticed a trend where - although lots of different people are saying this and people defending Tesla's market cap are often downvoted - the people who make this argument never use any numbers to back up their claims. So I figured it might be nice to have an objective look at Tesla's trends and projections, run the numbers, and see how richly valued Tesla really is.\n\n**For those who don't like reading, I will now explain how I got to my numbers. If you don't like reading, skip straight to \"The Numbers\"**\n\n----------------------------\n\n**The method**\n\nWhile trailing P/E numbers are generally quite meaningless for companies that are growing as fast as Tesla, we can extrapolate their current growth to determine what their trailing P/E would be in the next couple of years should their market cap not rise any further. Although their market cap has risen slightly higher, let's use a market cap of $1T to determine if Tesla really deserves to be a trillion dollar company.\n\n--------------------------------\n\n**The trends**\n\nIn terms of revenue (LTM), Tesla has grown from $28,176M at the end of Q3 2020 to $46,848M at the end of Q3 2021. A 66% growth YoY.\n\nIn terms of operating margin, Tesla has grown from 9.2% in Q3 2020 to 14.6% in Q3 2021.\n\nIn terms of net income (LTM), Tesla has grown from $556M after Q3 2020 to $3,468M after Q3 2021. A 524% growth YoY.\n\n---------------------------------\n\n**The future**\n\nObviously Tesla won't be able to maintain such a high growth rate in terms of margins and net income. The net income figure is heavily distorted by their low profitability in 2020, and their margins may suffer somewhat as they start to ramp up the two new factories that they are building.\n\nThat said, these two new factories are each larger than their two current factories combined and are much more efficiently spaced. Additionally, they will be using new technologies like the front and rear underbody gigacasting which should increase margins by quite a bit. On top of that, the percentage of sales that are Model 3's (their cheapest car) will decline as they scale up Model Y at these new factories and reintroduce the refreshed Model S and X, so ASPs should increase.\n\nIn terms of future sales, Tesla produced 237,823 cars in Q3. Annualized that gives a current run rate of 950,000 cars. Tesla has announced that they will scale up both their existing factories and start to ramp up both new factories by end of this year. Giga Shanghai ramped up with 300,000 units per year, so assuming Giga Texas and Berlin will ramp up with at least an equal amount, they should be doing 600,000 in 2022, 1,200,000 in 2023 and 1,800,000 in 2024.\n\n----------------------------\n\n**The numbers**\n\nPutting all of the information from the previous section together, I have create a worst and a best case scenario for Tesla's numbers through 2024. In the worst case I assume there are significant unforeseen setbacks that cause them to fall short of those numbers, in the best case I expect them to meet or even slightly exceed them. This brings us to the following projection:\n\n**Sales**\n\n||Worst Case|Best Case|\n:--|:--|:--|\n|**2022**|1,400,000|1,700,000|\n|**2023**|2,000,000|2,700,000|\n|**2024**|2,600,000|3,300,000|\n\n**ASP**\n\nWhile I mentioned ASPs will likely increase, I have chosen to keep them the same as in Q3 2022 at $50,000 because it's too difficult to predict. This should make sure the final numbers remain conservative.\n\n**Revenue**\n\n||Worst Case|Best Case|\n:--|:--|:--|\n|**2022**|$70B|$85B|\n|**2023**|$100B|$135B|\n|**2024**|$130B|$165B|\n\n**Operating Margin**\n\nBecause of the mix of positive and negative effects on margins while ramping up the two factories, I will keep margins the same in 2022 and restart the increasing trend from 2023.\n\n||Worst Case|Best Case|\n:--|:--|:--|\n|**2022**|14%|14%|\n|**2023**|15%|18%|\n|**2024**|16%|20%|\n\n**Net Income**\n\nMultiplying the total revenue by the operating margin gives us the following Net Income:\n\n||Worst Case|Best Case|\n:--|:--|:--|\n|**2022**|$9,8B|$11,9B|\n|**2023**|$15,0B|$24,3B|\n|**2024**|$20,8B|$33,0B|\n\n**P/E**\n\nDividing our $1T market cap by the projected net income gives us the following trailing P/E values should the stock stay flat around this market cap:\n\n||Worst Case|Best Case|\n:--|:--|:--|\n|**2022**|102|84|\n|**2023**|67|41|\n|**2024**|48|30|\n\n---------------------------\n\n**The conclusion**\n\nShould Tesla trade flat at around a $1T market cap and they continue on their current expected trajectory, they will be trading at a trailing P/E of between 30 and 48 by the end of 2024. Depending on which scenario plays out (best or worst case) and what you think is a fair valuation for a company growing revenue and margins as quickly as Tesla is, the stock has between 1 and 2 years of growth priced in.\n\nSo to conclude, the popular sentiment that \"Tesla has decades of growth priced in\" is false.\n\n**Important side note**\n\nFor simplicity sake I have only looked at Tesla's automotive bussiness, as it makes up the vast majority of their revenue and almost all of their Net Income as of this writing. Obviously all of Tesla's future business models, most notably energy and software (FSD and Autobidder), deserve to be taken into account when assigned a valuation to the company. But to avoid \"FSD doesn't exist\" and \"energy is a scam\" kind of comments, I have left these out of the analysis entirely.\n\n**TL;DR: Based on Tesla's current trends, they have between 1 and 2 years of growth priced in when looking purely at their automotive sales.**",

        "selftext": "Not every fucking stock that you like has a potential for a squeeze. I\u2019ll repeat, not every stock has a potential for a squeeze!\n\n90% of people joined this sub with very little to none investing experience in 2020-21 when GME squeeze was happening, and now people think that achieving a short squeeze is an easy thing. Well, it simply isn\u2019t, and any stock that gets a DD here which includes \u201cwell citadel is short and the float is 40%\u201d might as well be thrown out of the window.\n\nInvest in ideas on why the company might intrinsically grow. Is it a good business, is it cash flowing, is it growing revenues organically, is there a lot of dilution, how strong is the balance sheet, what unique problems is the business solving. There are the questions that every investor should be asking, no matter if they are a growth or value investors.\n\nStop trying to become the next DFV - this was a very rare opportunity in which he capitalized, it most likely won\u2019t happen again in the near term future. \n\nThere is a reason why WSB was a very good predictor of good plays prior to the meme mania, and why it is not anymore. There are no original ideas popping up, everyone is recycling the same bullshit DD built up in nothing more than \u201chey this company is partnering with this company\u201d, \u201chey shitadel and mevlin are short this, let\u2019s fuck them one more time\u201d, \u201clook at the **pattern**, it has to go up\u201d. \n\nIf you don\u2019t think that funds adjusted their risk models to account for potential short squeezes and hedge accordingly, you should not be in the finance markets, especially trying to go toe to toe with the big boys. \nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/04/ken-griffins-citadel-flagship-hedge-fund-returns-8percent-in-september-during-market-sell-off.html\n\nThere is a reason why in the past half a year majority of people here lost money, the same strategy that worked once might not work again - the ability to constantly adapt and create unique opportunities based on research you do yourself is what makes you rich, not ganging up on a stock that is shorted and trying to pump it. \n\nI frankly just want to help out new investors who are still passionate in the markets - I\u2019ve been here since 2017, and back then people would have original perspectives based on proprietary research and unique strategies, not the same strategy recycled 1000 times.",

        "selftext": "I failed a lot while trading before, during, and after succeeding. I haven\u2019t counted it up, but it\u2019s likely I encountered losses in excess of $150,000 from making mistakes that were easily avoided, rash decisions, and not giving myself enough time to test out strategies. Net net, I\u2019m up $500,000, but I was asked to share some of what worked for me over IM quite a bit after my last post and figured I\u2019d lay it for others who may not want to waste money learning the hard way, as I did. \n\nThese are tactics and strategies that worked for me and my situation - someone trying to increase net worth, not increase income - and they may not be suitable for everyone.\n\n**Understand the Trading Environment**\n\nOne mistake I made more than a few times was not understanding or paying attention to the trading environment I was in before picking out a strategy. What do I mean? I need to know where things are in the year, in relation to earnings season, and in relation to sector rotations. I need to pay attention to the macroeconomic indicators and I need to watch the VIX.\n\n**Mind the Gap Between Earnings Seasons**. I can\u2019t stress this enough. When earnings are strong and earnings data is coming in, investors watch those like hawks. Good earnings reports bring confidence to the market which yields a rising market. \n\nIn between earnings seasons, there is less data from companies to review and investors pay closer attention to macroeconomic indicators like inflation, 10-year bond yields, and what the Fed is doing. This makes for a much jumpier market that\u2019s more likely to pull back.  It\u2019s also a time when the large asset managers rebalance their portfolios. They manage billions, so this can cause large movements to stocks and indexes as they shift to be overweight in one asset class (e.g. value stocks, energy) and underweight in other asset classes (e.g. growth stocks, technology).\n\nI try not to get caught by these patterns. I anticipate they are coming and invest accordingly. Simply put, I buy the pullback after the rotations have occurred and before earnings seasons begin as a general rule. Of course, I don\u2019t do this if I expect a terrible earnings season. \n\n**Take Advantage of Sector Rotations**\n\nThe sector rotations are pretty predictable if you track the performance of the different sectors over the year. I do this by plotting sector ETFs on a graph and noting when one begins to gain that was flat while others that were up a lot begin to flatten or pull back. Professional investors tend to sell off sectors that have been hot the last quarter or two and replace them with underperforming sectors that represent a better value or opportunity for upside. If I run the P/E ratios for the sector ETFs, I can get a quick sense of the sectors that have had a hot run up over 30 P/E vs other sectors that are more modestly valued. Just keep in mind that certain sectors, like Tech, will always be valued more richly given their growth. So looking at P/E ratios is not apples to apples - it\u2019s just a way to note if historically that sector is at the high end of its own typical valuation range.\n\nLast year\u2019s worst performing sector tends to be one of the best performing sectors the following year. This is because investors prefer to buy low and sell high. I don\u2019t bet against this trend, it\u2019s been around longer than I have and will continue to be around long after I\u2019m dirt. \n\nLast year you couldn\u2019t give away a barrel of oil. Last week, oil reached $80 a barrel. \n\nOne of my favorite options strategies is to buy long dated calls at the money for sector ETFs that underperformed the previous year. I buy calls with expirations in 6-9 months, knowing that I will sell at my exit point which for me is a 100% gain. Sometimes this happens 6 weeks into the year; other times it takes 9 months. So long as I don\u2019t overpay for the options, it works. I don\u2019t like to pay more than the average price return of the sector. For example, if the sector ETF averages a 10% annual return and the ETF price is $100, I\u2019m not going to buy a call for more than $10. That way, if the sector only moves 5%, I can still make money provided the price increase moves quickly enough.\n\n**Make The VIX Your Friend**\n\nThe VIX is an easy way to gauge fear in the marketplace and is a hedge used widely against market pullbacks. If the VIX goes up, the market is worried. If it goes down, the market is getting bullish. If it stays up, everyone is on edge. It\u2019s hard to make good trades in an environment where everyone is on edge and ready to hit the sell button. So be careful buying during times when the VIX is high. On the flip side, if the market has pulled back and the VIX starts to retreat away from its highs, that makes for a good entry point. \n\nAnother interesting phenomenon is when the VIX is higher than normal, there tends to be a selloff the Friday before a long weekend. This happens because investors don\u2019t want to sit through a long weekend that might hold worse news out of fear they will start their Tuesday with losses piling up. I\u2019ve found this is a nice time to get some discounts at the end of the day Friday, or to run some weekly puts on Thursday afternoon before the dips. \n\n**Selecting Trades &amp; Investments**\n\n**Have an Allocation Plan**\n\nThe first thing I recommend is determining, in advance, the amount of money you want to invest longer term vs the amount you want to invest short term vs the amount of money you might actually need to have available for life emergencies. Anything shorter term is higher risk, higher reward. I break my portfolio in the following buckets:\n\n* 25% long-term market investment using equity ETFs that largely track the SPX or do a breakdown between bonds and the market. I use Vanguard funds and a small cap value fund called CALF. I will not touch this money for 15+ years.\n* 25% cash. I like to be ready to buy the dips and have enough to spare. This way if a black swan event happens, I not only have money to invest, I have money to live on should things go bad for a while. This philosophy enabled me to buy options when COVID hit in 2020 without worrying if I could continue paying a mortgage for a year without a job. It\u2019s also very useful if I have to roll covered calls to offset taxes and buy back expensive positions. I took this from Buffet FWIW.\n* 30% options, mostly in tax advantaged accounts (IRAs). I aim for a 50% annual return overall with this portfolio, though it fluctuates a lot year to year.\n* 10% long term blue chips stocks like Visa, Apple, MSFT, etc. I defend these positions when the stocks get overheated by selling calls on them and/or buying puts out of the money that expire after a typical sector rotation would occur. That can generate some additional income or help lessen the sting if the stock falls. \n* 6% long-term bets in a Roth IRA. These are equities I think all have a chance at a 10X return but that will take 5-10 years. It\u2019s a lot of IPOs, small tech companies, and biotechs. I have to stomach pullbacks in this portfolio of 40-50% on the belief that a few of the 30 in here will more than compensate for it. This is a new strategy for me so I\u2019ll let you know in 10 years if it works.\n* 3% leveraged hedges.These are puts on my own positions, stocks, or the market at large. Generally I use VIX calls, buy puts, occasionally buy calls on the SPXS, and run strangles on investments (betting both up and down on the same stock using calls and puts).  \n* 1% in other things I can\u2019t mention due to the bots in here but they rhyme with tiptoe.\n\n**Use Technologies to Find Ideas**\n\nUnless you want to spend 8 hours a day reading news or are OK getting all your ideas from meme stocks and friends, you need to use tools to help you locate investment/trade ideas and be willing to pay for them. I value my time and am willing to pay .5% of my portfolio a year if it saves me time, and more if it generates higher returns. \n\nI\u2019ve tried about a dozen or so services, including stock picking services like Fool and Investorsplace. Ultimately I decided the stock picking sites were not working for me because I did not want to wait 5 years to find out if they were the right recommendations and lost a lot of money learning that lesson on their pump and dumps. So I switched to analytics tools and my Fidelity platform. \n\nMy favorite tools to use are Zack\u2019s VGM score, Levelfields, and Fidelity. The Zack\u2019s VGM measures a stock\u2019s value, growth rate, and momentum. It\u2019s an easy screen I can run off the basic level subscription to get a list of companies to look at. The caveat is that you need to run this screen often because sometimes the companies on the list get stale and have already moved 99% of the way they are going to move. So you need to keep an eye on what\u2019s new to the list to avoid losing money. That part is crucial. \n\nThe list usually represents companies that are well valued and poised to move up over the next 6-9 months. Warning: they can move very slowly so be patient and set your target exit to automatically exit. I use Fidelity to do my own due diligence on the stocks from there, examining their actual growth and earnings rates and ensuring there is no negative news against them which could drive down the price.\n\nA friend recently turned me on to an AI tool called Levelfields. They have a lot of news alerts but only for the types of events that matter and are organized thematically. It helps me find trades on news events with high returns or get in early on the small to mid-cap companies you don\u2019t usually hear about which fall between the cracks in the penny stock discussions and cnbc favorites. They often send alerts on company events before there\u2019s any news out, which is really helpful. The interface shows you how stocks perform when these events happen, so it\u2019s easy to figure out my entry and exit points and statistical likelihood of success.   \nI use it a lot for pinpointing entry/exit points from options trades and have bought stock in a few companies I hadn\u2019t ever heard of before that were absolutely crushing it on revenue and earnings. Not sure why, but they never came up in any of my Fidelity stock screens. I suspect it\u2019s because there\u2019s a lag in the data Fidelity is getting from S&amp;P but haven\u2019t confirmed this. They send a lot of high quality alerts and my only wish is that they\u2019d have a better way to rank the stocks in the alerts so I didn\u2019t have to look up the stocks on Fidelity.\n\nI use Fidelity for basic news reading, running stock screens for high growth stocks at decent valuations, looking deeply at the history of earnings results, actually trading options, and for their options scanner which tracks abnormal option activity.  I sell puts when I see abnormal call volume and run strangles if the stock is at a mid-point in its 52-week price range in case it shoots up and then down. I always set an automated exit.\n\nFidelity also has a cool probability calculator for options I use when selling puts. It tells you the probability of a stock falling below a certain range. I use that number to determine where to sell puts without a lot of risk. I do two standard deviations out and still buy a put with a lower strike price as insurance and sell weekly puts on high vol companies like GME and TSLA. My typical goal is to make 800 a week from these plays which I use to fund new call positions.\n\n**Be Wary of Analyst Opinions**\n\nIf you\u2019ve invested actively for a while, you\u2019ve likely noticed a peculiar trend: as a stock is cratering, analysts are increasing their target purchase price on it. This is not for your benefit. Brokerages often make investment recommendations based on the research provided by their analysts, so there is inherent bias in the system. \n\nI\u2019ve also found that few analysts recommend sell ratings. They are much more likely to issue calls to buy stocks. One study found less than 1% issued sell recommendations. What\u2019s more, the track records of these analysts are usually about the same as coin flipping. CNBC has gotten very into pushing analyst views from big name firms (e.g. \u201cGoldman Sachs says these 3 stocks are ready to explode\u201d), but if you look at the actual analyst behind the headline, they are often inexperienced or wrong more than right. \n\nI am embarrassed to say I lost a lot of money listening to analyst opinions and believing their price targets were rooted in reality. It\u2019s easy to get caught up in the excitement of an upgrade and if 4 analysts are all touting the stock at the same time it can create a bit of a ponzi effect, which is tradable. But it boils down to needing to do your own research.\n\n**Good Things Come in Pairs**\n\nJust about every stock has a peer or competitor. Most have several. I stopped trying to pick the winner and now place bets on multiple leaders. I\u2019ve owned Visa and Mastercard. I own OLO and TOST. I have a handful of, um, herbal medicine providers. I like ETSY and AMZN. If you bet on a small group of competitors, it\u2019s likely one will pull ahead and your odds of success will increase substantially. \n\nSimilarly, it enables you to monitor the news of competitors which many investors use as a proxy. What do I mean? If Mastercard reports low cross border transactions, it\u2019s highly probable Visa will be experiencing the same thing. So you can use the information from Mastercard to alter your position on Visa.\n\n**Exercise Financial Discipline**\n\nEven when I\u2019ve been successful picking investments, I\u2019ve run into problems with how to handle my successes. We\u2019ve all experienced the thrill of being up huge and wondering how much higher it will go. That\u2019s usually the moment I\u2019ve learned I should be taking some gains. A few rules I try hard to follow but still screw up:\n\n1. Take Profits Often.   \nWhen an option or stock hits 100% return, I look to take some profit. It may not seem possible if you only bought 1 call, but it is. Just roll the call to a higher strike price and ensure the credit to your account equals your original investment plus substantial return. You can let the new call ride in case the stock gets going up. This ensures you cannot lose money. My rationale here is simple: at a 100% gain, I now have more to lose than I have to gain. You will be surprised how much this adds up when you trade often and how often you can be up 150% then down to -50% on the same positions, which makes me want to break things.  \nIf you find yourself up huge on an equity investment, switch to options. I did this for my BABA position and it saved me. When it hit 300, I was up 200%. I sold all the stock and bought options for the same number of shares. I had about 60K in stock and switched to something like 6K in options. When BABA crashed down to 150 I really didn\u2019t care much. I was only down 4.5K instead of 30K. I had my profit of 40K locked in, so being down 4.5K was no big deal.  \n\n2. Fail Fast.   \nIf the option price sinks to -50% in value, it\u2019s likely time to call it quits unless you have a solid reason not to (praying is not a strategy). The other half of the value left can easily be eaten up by the time decay in the value of the option as I wait for the turnaround and it gets closer to the expiration date. If there\u2019s negative news driving this, I\u2019m out. I want to fail quickly. That allows me time to take the remaining 50% and generate gains with it on a better investment. I think this is the hardest rule for me to stick to as I tend to be an optimist.  \n\n3. Profit Both Ways.   \nIf a stock I hold hits an all-time high in price or valuation, I look for a way to profit from the downside by selling covered calls or buying cheap puts. This enables you to stash some cash while riding the volatility wave. I hold Visa and when it hit 235 headed into earnings, I sold 3 calls and bought 10 puts. This offset a paper loss for me of \\~20K yesterday alone by 7.5K in gains, which I secured as real profits. Assuming Visa will recover, that 7K adds 9% to this year\u2019s returns for Visa.  \n\n4. Be Patient but Not Greedy.   \nI have learned the hard way from selling positions days before they pop that it can take a while before the market catches on to my investment idea, especially if using good tools. Asset managers, wealth managers, and passive investors are usually looking for new investments every 3 months, not daily, so stocks can stay stuck in a channel for some time before the world catches on to its awesomeness. Example, I held Upstart from April to August this year and sold it because it was running flat. A couple weeks later the stock tripled. FML were the only words I could think of at the time. The second thought I had was that I should\u2019ve bought just one call option to replace the stock I sold.  \nOn the flip side, once a stock does move a lot higher, don\u2019t be greedy. What goes up fast can come down just as fast. I feel a lot worse watching a stock/option go up 200% then come down all the way or more than I do exiting with a 100% gain watching the stock go up more. Don\u2019t chase the perfect trade. It\u2019s a white whale. Just make money.  \n\n5. Everyone Has a Plan Until You Get Punched in the Mouth.   \nThis is as true in boxing (thanks Mike) as it is investing. That\u2019s why it\u2019s essential to have a plan A and a plan B should plan A not work out as you thought. Waiting through it can work, but it isn\u2019t a very effective strategy for navigating a changing environment.   \nSo if my thesis is that the stock will do well with rising COVID rates and COVID rates stop rising, I try to have plan B ready. I keep a lot of notes. I track every trade. I review what went wrong with trades quarterly. I learn. I avoid the pity party as much as possible and drink vodka for the rest. I try not to fall in love with any stock. And I know that even if I lose 100K, there\u2019s more money to be made in the coming years and decades if I stick it out.",

The four day increase alone is worth more than Ford, GM, Nissan, and Honda total market caps combined ($67B, $79B, $22B, &amp; $54B respectively).  Four days....it increased by the size of some of the largest car producers in the US combined.  All of that for a company that has less than $4b in operational income YTD, which by the way is about 8X less than the combined income generated by the aforementioned car producers.  \n\n\nI'm not a bear or a bull, I'm just watching this from the sidelines at this point.

        "selftext": "I'll get straight to the point. **Everyone,** and I mean **EVERYONE**, is hunting down that next 'GME/AMC' style squeeze.\n\nThey want to be in it 'early'. They want to be on the cusp of the 'next big squeeze', and join the ranks of those who 'HODL'd GME and AMC over the past year.\n\nThis is easy to see. Flocks of people move from stock to stock as soon as it gets mentioned. They want to match the 'ape monicker' and get creative marketing names 'Spartans, Progs, etc.. to match the 'ape community' that was formed.\n\nWhen in reality, these squeezes are far and few between.\n\nNow don't get me wrong, I have made money off these constant rotations. That aside, this is my FAVORITE play and the one I have put the most effort into... $SDC.\n\n**Here are my thoughts on why I believe $SDC has what it takes to take on the Meme title and join GME and AMC as a true meme-style rally/squeeze.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**1.** **SDC has been well known:**\n\n**$SDC** already has a huge amount of exposure. When it comes to short squeezes, exposure is EVERYTHING. You NEED people to **actually know** about the company. On top of that, you need volume and price action to work in your favor to apply pressure (via increased share price, margin requirements, and cost to borrow) against the opposing short positions. $SDC **has** this exposure. It's highly talked about, and you have tons of eyes on the sidelines. A simple 5+% move like today can suddenly cause a MASSIVE shot in upwards sentiment. It gets everyone to FOMO in and turns what was a 5% day into a 15% day almost immediately.\n\n**2. Management Favors Retail:**\n\nManagement is in RETAILS FAVOR. I will say this OVER and OVER again. BECAUSE GME's management favored retail and because AMC's management favored retail, that is the TRUE reason these stocks had the momentum they did. These companies put RETAIL FIRST. Yes, AMC had to raise capital, but they did that WITH transparency to retail. AND, they did that AFTER MOST RETAIL made a KILLING riding the stock to almost $40. If you haven't been paying attention $SDC is on retails side. Just like Adam Aron, SDC's CFO is making constant retail appearances and inviting retail to ask questions to get them involved. Retail only wins, if, AND ONLY IF, the company works WITH retail; not against.\n\nOn top of that we, DON'T want dilution when we have the momentum of a squeeze. SDC has made it clear they don't plan to dilute on retail. Even when they had to do a dilution round in the past they made sure there was a clause that the stock had to go up 100% from that current price before the dilution could be realized. THAT IS WHAT WE NEED. We need a stock/management team that puts retail first, and I believe SDC has that checked as well.\n\n**3. Fundamentals Matter on Psychology**\n\nFUNDAMENTALS. Now, don't tell me fundamentals don't matter in a squeeze. They do. At the very least, the COMPANY/STOCK behind the squeeze does. There is a psychological play in every squeeze. As the price goes up, more and more people are making profits. On the flip side, as the price goes down, more and more people are losing money. Why did AMC and GME squeeze? **THEY DIDN'T SELL**.\n\nYou can't tell me the fact that there was nostalgia for your childhood GameStop, or the fact that people were excited to get out of these pandemic lockdowns, and go back to the movies, didn't have a HUGE effect on the psychological sentiment behind these stocks? You **knew** the companies you were buying and trying to squeeze, and they gave you/them confidence.\n\nWhen stock is down, your **CONVICTION** is what keeps you from selling. You have to know **WHAT YOU OWN**. If you're playing a squeeze on some penny stock you have never heard of before now, **YOU CAN'T TELL ME** you will have a high conviction when things go south. **NO-ONE** wants to be the one holding a bag of a no-name company if a squeeze doesn't turn out and the stock drops.\n\nThis is another reason I love $SDC. **PEOPLE KNOW WHO THEY ARE.** Unless you are living under a rock or didn't watch any tv AT ALL during the pandemic these past 2 years, you have seen a Smile Direct Club ad. I'm not saying Smile Direct has the nostalgia, GME or AMC have/had. But they for sure have more retail confidence and or more well know (as as company) than any of the most recent 'brand new' squeeze plays of late.\n\nYou cant tell me you had ANY idea what/who some of these random squeeze companies were prior to the squeeze play being called out. And this is VERY important. Have you noticed SDC has had a cult-like following DESPITE dropping 20% over the past few weeks? People are dropping hundreds of thousands if not MILLIONS into this company with the conviction that it's going up because **THEY KNOW** what/who the company actually is.\n\nLong story short, the better a company is known, the more confident the average trader will feel when it dips. The more confident = less selling. less selling on a short squeeze = \ud83c\udf19.\n\n4. **Fundamentals are debatable (fundamentals continued)...**\n\nThe fundamentals are debatable. This is a follow up to number 3.\n\nAMC and GME had 'debatable fundamental value. They didn't have 100% of people thinking AMC and GME were going to turn the boat around and make a profitable company (hence why they were so shorted). It took VISION, vision that they COULD have a future. And that 'potential' allowed people to speculate, and in turn, allowed them to confidently buy the stock.\n\nSDC has that same 'speculative' future. 50% of people see its potential... how it has SO MUCH growth potential for SO MUCH more, especially when compared to ALGN. On the flip side, you have 'every dentist and their dog' bashing the company and saying why it's going to fail. The similarities to that of GME and AMC (when they were trading in the $5's) isn't lost on me. People also said they were going **NOWHERE** and that people on this sub were throwing money in the garbage. Look at them now.\n\n**5. Stats**\n\n**The float, short interest etc...:**\n\nOne thing I have seen said over and over \"the float is too big to move\". That is a **BUNCH OF SH$\\*.**\n\nThe float is around **100M**. AMC's was **NEAR 500M**. You give $SDC 1/5 of the volume and attention that $AMC had and your golden. That aside, you **DONT WANT A LOW FLOAT STOCK**. If a company has a float of say 20M and has 50% short interest. That means there are only 10 million shares on loan/shorted.\n\nIf a stock has having 100M+ in volume a day, shorts could cover in literally an hour if they wanted (not days) and no one would even know from the buying pressure. On top of that, you cant tell me shorts are '**really sweating**' when there are only 10 million shares of stock (lets say its trading at say $2), and the CTB is going up. That's only 20 million dollars to be short 50% of this hypothetical penny stocks float.\n\nThey have less capital at risk, '*less skin in the game*', on these low float stocks. Yes, they can pop fast, but they can be shorted down JUST AS FAST. The risk just isn't there, and the momentum DIES FAST AS WELL.\n\nWhy do you think it has been SO HARD to bring down AMC and GME once they FINALLY started to have MAJOR momentum. **THE BIG FLOAT!** A big float will make it **HARDER** to bring a squeeze down once the squeeze is in motion. On top of that, they have **WAYYYY** more money at risk. In the case of $SDC 45.86 MILLION Shares. At $6 a share, that's **229 million dollars** on the line. **OVER** **1/4 BILLION dollars** they are having to pay over 250% CTB on. Now that, **THAT**, can make shorts think twice. That can actually make a dent in their hedge funds bankroll. **That is what we NEED.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ghndfe38cqr71.png?width=2880&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f7719dbe2c935c68213bff6d1d0eb1cbfe10040f\n\nAnyway, all in all, these are just a FEW the reasons I think $SDC can join the ranks of $GME and $AMC. I have made other posts going over the companies fundamentals, future outlook as a 'long play' etc.. But this is about its *MEME-ability*. It has all the potential, now it just needs the retail movement. Are you going to be on the right side of this play? Are you going to 'get in early',? just like you wished you did with AMC and GME? If we play our cards right we have the control here. Just BTFD and hold on tight! \ud83d\udc8e \ud83e\udd1a\n\n**tl;dr: $SDC has management that is on the side of retail. The company is well known and has all the components of becoming the next big meme rally next to AMC and GME. So BTFD (but this isn't financial advice) \ud83d\ude09**\n\n.....\n\n**EDIT:**\n\n**IF YOU DON'T WANT TO READ JUST, BUY AND HODL TO THE MOON \ud83c\udf19!!! WE DESERVE OUR TENDIES!** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n.... (again not financial advice) \ud83d\ude09!\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

        "selftext": "https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/hertz-orders-100000-tesla-cars-bloomberg-news-2021-10-25/\n\n&gt;Oct 25 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) surpassed $1 trillion in market value on Monday after landing its biggest-ever order from rental car company Hertz, a deal that reinforced the electric car leader's ambitions to top the entire auto industry in sales over the next decade.\n\n&gt;Tesla shares surged as much as 14.9% to $1,045.02, making it the world's most valuable automaker according to Reuters calculations based on its latest filing.\n\n&gt;Even Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk expressed surprise at the velocity of the surge. \"Strange that moved valuation, as Tesla is very much a production ramp problem, not a demand problem,\" Musk tweeted in reply to a comment by Ross Gerber, co-founder of the investment fund Gerber Kawasaki and a Tesla shareholder.\n\n&gt;\"Wild $T1mes!\" Musk wrote in a separate tweet.\n\n&gt;Tesla is the first carmaker to join the elite club of trillion-dollar companies that includes Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O).\n\n&gt;Most automakers do not boast about sales to rental car companies, often made at discounts to unload slow-selling models. But for Tesla and its investors, Hertz's decision to order 100,000 Tesla vehicles by the end of 2022 showed electric vehicles are no longer a niche product, but will dominate the mass car market in the near future.\n\n&gt;\"Electric vehicles are now mainstream, and we've only just begun to see rising global demand and interest,\" Hertz interim Chief Executive Officer Mark Fields told Reuters.\n\n&gt;Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk has set an annual sales growth target of 50%, on average, eventually reaching 20 million vehicles a year. That would be more than twice the volume of current sales leaders Volkswagen AG and Toyota Motor Corp (7203.T).\n\n&gt;Consumer demand for electric vehicles is turning a corner in some major markets. The Tesla Model 3 was the best-selling vehicle of any kind in Europe last month, consulting firm JATO Dynamics reported Monday. read more\n\n&gt;Tesla also appeared on Monday to be making progress resolving regulatory problems that threatened its business in China. The company said it had opened a new data and research center in Shanghai to comply with government requirements that data collected from vehicles in China stay in the country. read more\n\n&gt;However, Tesla faced new U.S. regulatory pressure on Monday. The National Transportation Safety Board's new chief sent Musk a letter questioning why Tesla was rolling out its \"Full Self Driving\" software even though the company has not officially responded to the NTSB's questions about the automated driving system's safety.\n\n&gt;\"It (the Hertz order) puts an exclamation point under guidance for 50%+ growth in deliveries,\" Roth Capital analyst Craig Irwin said. \"Another solid piece of evidence EVs are going mainstream.\"\n\n&gt;Tesla now faces the daunting day-to-day challenge of becoming a high-volume automaker growing at a rate not seen since the early 1900s when demand exploded for Henry Ford's Model T.\n\n&gt;Tesla is coping with an order backlog for its vehicles and extended supply chain disruptions. Tesla Chief Financial Officer Zachary Kirkhorn cautioned investors during a call last week that Tesla's near-term production goals will hinge on resolving those disruptions and ramping up two new, huge assembly and battery plants in Austin and Berlin. read more\n\n&gt;\"There is quite an execution journey ahead of us,\" Kirkhorn said.\n\n&gt;Rivals are not sitting still. Daimler AG's (DAIGn.DE) Mercedes-Benz brand, General Motors Co (GM.N), Ford Motor Co (F.N), and startups such as Lucid (LCID.O) and China's Xpeng (9868.HK) are all battling Tesla with new electric cars or trucks.\n\n&gt;Investors and analysts, for now, are looking past the near-term challenges. Morgan Stanley boosted its Tesla price target by 33% to $1,200 as the brokerage expects the electric carmaker to surpass 8 million deliveries in 2030.\n\n&gt;The Hertz deal also underscored the power of the Tesla brand, as the rental car company emerges from bankruptcy and aims to revive its once-dominant brand. Hertz's rescue is led by a group of investors including Knighthead Capital Management, Certares Opportunities and Apollo Capital Management.\n\n&gt;\"We absolutely believe that this is going to be competitive advantage for us,\" interim Hertz CEO Mark Fields said of the Tesla order, due to be delivered by the end of 2022.\n\n&gt;\"We want to be a leader in mobility. ... Getting customers experience with electrified vehicles is an absolute priority for us.\"\n\n&gt;Tesla's cheapest Model 3 sedan starts at about $44,000, making this order worth about $4.4 billion, if the entire order were for its mass-market sedan.\n\n&gt;Fields declined to say how much Hertz was paying for the order. Tesla was not immediately available for comment.\n\n&gt;With the current order, Hertz said EVs will make up more than 20% of its global fleet. Fields cited the rising number of EVs for sale and consumer interest in electrified vehicles.\n\n&gt;Hertz also said it was installing thousands of chargers throughout its network. Customers who rent a Tesla Model 3 will have access to 3,000 Tesla supercharging stations throughout the United States and Europe.\n\n&gt;Tesla shares closed up 12.7% at $1,024.86.",

It\u2019s the most Tesla has ever sold in a quarter (and for some added perspective, the company [sold 367,500 in all of 2019](https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/3/21047233/tesla-2019-deliveries-q4-record-model-3-sales)).\n\nThe company managed to deliver more vehicles once again despite the fact that major automakers saw huge drops this past quarter.

        "selftext": "Hello. Homeless here. I live in my car and I am looking to stocks to solve my problems. Ready to harass me with unkind things?\n\nBefore you do here are some facts:\n\nI make $11 an hour and work 40 hours a week.\n\nI make enough to invest over $1000 a month.\n\nI only spend $400 a month out of my $1500 - $2000 monthly pay.\n\nI plan on getting an apartment in 2022 at some point as well as a better job.\n\nI want to invest for the long term. My ideal minimum goal would be 10 percent profit every year and take out 4 percent per year when I retire.\n\nI have looked at many stocks past 5 year history and many of them are skyrocket. The ones that seem to go up up up and never really go down in the long term would be the ones I think I would invest in.\n\nI have at least a year of savings at $400 a month meaning my savings is at least $5000.\n\nHaving finally looked into stocks and looking up videos for about 100 hours and still having no real true 100 percent plan I know a few things. First: Stock market seems better than a savings account. Second: If I had invested 5 years ago I would have so much more money. Third: It seems some stocks will almost always profit over the long term. Forth: Inflation means stocks are a decent option instead of a bank.\n\nI did put a very small amount of money into stocks and so far have a 2.5 percent return. I put the money in 3 stocks and it increased. That was 24 hours ago.\n\nI have a decent savings account and I was wondering if I should put it all into stocks. The truth is if I put $5000 into stocks and lost it all I would not lose my life and could make it back but it would hurt my heart and make me want to stay in my car a bit longer.\n\nI currently am trying to better myself and I have come a long way. I won't get into that so try not to judge me to harshly. Right now I am at a point where I can invest a bit more at a low paying job, but I do intend on getting a better job when I can and then get an apartment so I can have a home and invest more money as well. But I also have no friends and no family. I am all on my own with the grace of God and perhaps your input here...\n\nBut currently $1000 is completely able to put into the stock market  every month.\n\nWhere do YOU personally put your money and where would YOU personally put your money if you were in my situation?\n\nWith inflation is it okay to start investing or is it too late now?\n\nWould it be best to stick with the stocks that seem to have a history of doing well or would they be overvalued due to the inflation lately?\n\nIn the long term what stocks do you feel will stand the test of time and keep raising even in times of trouble?\n\nPlease provide your thoughts and hope I am not too much of a loser. Thanks.",

Recent events suggest their suspicion that the decks are stacked against them is justified \u2013 which is a terrible look for capitalism.\n\nDaniel Taylor, a professor at the Wharton School, has amassed evidence of widespread insider trading by company executives, Bloomberg Businessweek reported this week. An investigation by the Wall Street Journal found that more than 130 U.S. federal judges failed to recuse themselves from 685 court cases involving companies in which they or their families had investments. And at the Federal Reserve, two policymakers have resigned amid a probe into their personal trading activity.  \n\nWharton professor Taylor\u2019s research has shown that corporate insiders consistently dumped holdings before official legal probes hurt their company\u2019s shares, Businessweek reported. They also increased their buying and selling in the gaps between audit reports being produced for company boards and being made publicly available, and exploited rules governing scheduled trading schedules for profit.\n\nHis analysis suggests the existing regulations governing insider trading are inadequate. It also implies that the Securities and Exchange Commission is asleep at the wheel: The watchdog instigated only 33 insider trading cases last year and just 32 in 2019, the fewest in more than two decades, according to Businessweek.\n\nSince 1974, federal law has explicitly prohibited U.S. judges from overseeing cases in which they or their immediate family have a \u201clegal or equitable interest, however small,\u201d the Journal reported earlier this week. But the newspaper found that in two-thirds of the cases in which judiciary members had a stake, the rulings would have benefited their finances.  \n\nAt the U.S. central bank, Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren and Dallas Fed chief Robert Kaplan both resigned within hours of each other on Monday. Both had revealed questionable investing activity in their annual financial disclosures. And while they said the trades were within the central bank\u2019s rules, both are being scrutinized further. \u201cWe\u2019re looking carefully at the trading that was done to make sure that it\u2019s in compliance with our rules and with the law,\u201d Fed Chairman Jerome Powell told the Senate Banking Committee.\n\nIn light of those embarrassing events in the U.S., you\u2019d hope that every central bank in the world is currently getting busy reviewing the protocols governing what policy makers are allowed to do with their personal portfolios while in office. You\u2019d also hope that every central banker in the world is examining their investment activities and tappity-tapping a resignation letter if their pursuit of personal profit is at odds with the probity of their position.\n\nCapitalism is still tarnished by the aftershocks of the global financial crisis, when the risks taken by private capital had to be bailed out by public funds. And the growing prevalence of the fastest-growing companies staying off public markets and funding their expansion instead with private capital keeps them out of the portfolios of retail buyers, further stoking suspicion that the covenant between capitalism and society is asymmetrical and biased against individual investors.\n\nWhen corporate executives, judges and policy makers line their own pockets by either bending or breaking rules designed to avoid even the appearance of impropriety, they do a disservice to society as a whole. \u201cMost Americans today believe the stock market is rigged, and they\u2019re right,\u201d Wharton\u2019s Taylor told Businessweek.\n\nSure, public officials have the same right to set aside income for their retirement or to pay school fees or even to buy sport cars or boats. But they can achieve those goals by putting their money into blind trusts or index funds or other financial products that don\u2019t involve them selecting specific individual stocks of companies.

        "selftext": "I understand 90% of people are pouring into DWAC right now just to try and get some tendies before they dump their shares onto a bag holder. So maybe there will be a better entry point in a few weeks as the mania subsides. However, I believe that regardless of short and medium term volatility and price manipulation, DWAC is a long term hold. \n\nAt a valuation of 3 billion, that's absolutely nothing for a social media platform. Facebook is worth 907 billion. Snap is worth 88 billion. Now you might ask yourself, \"Yea I get successful social media platforms are valued at crazy levels, but who on Earth is going to make a profile on Truth Social?\" well, for better or for worse depending on your political affiliation and beliefs:\n\n [Poll: Two-thirds of Republicans still think the 2020 election was rigged (yahoo.com)](https://news.yahoo.com/poll-two-thirds-of-republicans-still-think-the-2020-election-was-rigged-165934695.html) \n\nApproximately 240 million people are eligible to vote in this country. Of that 240 million, 40% identify as Republican. That's 96 million. Now of that 96 million, about 63.6 million believe that the election was rigged by Democrats and that Trump is the real President. That's who makes an account at Truth Social. \n\nIn addition to this, a lot of people's favorite thing to do on the internet is get into insufferable political arguments. It will not only be MAGA Qanon people on this thing, people from the left will make accounts there to troll and argue. \n\nFurthermore, there are numerous talk show hosts, and media personalities who will follow suit and make accounts. Jordan Peterson, Charlie Kirk, Candace Owens and the rest of peanut gallery. Tucker Carlson, Thomas Sowell, there are a lot of political figures who will end up on there and bringing a strong follower base. Celebrities who like Trump, are indifferent to him, or who are exhausted by what they view as opaque rule enforcement from youtube and facebook would likely join, such as the Nelk Boys, gun youtubers like Garand Thumb, I would imagine the Paul brothers would make accounts just to kick the hornets nest and get attention. \n\nAt that point, there would be millions of accounts already, which would start to attract non political personalities. People who are hungry for clout and aspiring content creators would see an app with millions of users and not that many creators crowding it and jump in. \n\nI believe there could be 250 million users in Truth Social in over the course of a few years and that's a conservative (pun intended) estimate. Depending then on ad revenue, whether or not the company decides to sell data (That would be a tough thing for them to navigate), I can't imagine this thing not having at least a 20 billion dollar market cap in the near future. And then there's also the streaming service and news broadcast which I haven't even mentioned.  \n\nAnd let's not forget the Catalysts: \n\nDonald Trump running for President.\n\nDonald Trump WINNING the Presidency in 2024. \n\nAnytime a major celebrity or personality joins. \n\nTL:DR:\n\nMay the God-Emperor, Donald Pump, first of his name, bringer of tendies and golden showers, take all holders to Mars on a Falcon X Rocket. \n\nPosition: 10 shares at $98.

It has obviously been a stellar few years, did covid even happen?\n\nI have a close relationship with an old professor of mine who teaches investments at the college level, we often chat. He was a derivatives trader for 20 years back in the 80s and 90s.\n\nHe swears and insists that when rates begin to rise the market is going to absolutely eat shit, and most if not all valuations will drop. He says that the market has been hooked on the feds liquidity since \u201808 and the withdrawals will be severe. He has been slowly divesting the past few months.\n\nI see where he is coming from, and he is obviously much wiser than me. In class he would always preach about if a stock falls 50% you need 100% gain to make your money back, therefore avoiding downside is much better than missing a little upside, which I also agree with.\n\nWhat I am not so sure of is that rising rates will spell doom for the markets. The most I could see is maybe slowed growth? But if rates steadily climb to around 4% on the 10 year that would actually be GOOD For the economy.\n\nThoughts on this?

        "selftext": "Hi everyone, I currently work in the shipping industry and would like to give you some insight about what's going on in Long Beach right now, and how Biden's imposed \"emergency fee\" to alleviate congestion is actually making things worse. I hope this provides some of you with useful information. \n\nHere's some background for those of you unfamiliar with ocean imports. When vessels come to Long Beach port, the containers are unloaded and delivered to the terminal. From there, containers are either delivered to CFS (container freight station) for unloading, or the entire container is delivered to the customer that purchased the goods. \n\nRight now, containers are stuck in the terminal unable to be delivered to CFS or to the customer's warehouse. This is due to a lack of truck drivers and chassis (equipment used to transport containers). Not only is this bad because customers can't get their equipment, but there is also something called a \"last free date\" which is the date by which the importer has to get the container out of the terminal. If the importer is unable to get the container out by the last free date, shipping lines will charge importers significant extra charges (called demurrage charges) for each day that the container isn't picked up (usually $200-350 per day, depending on the shipping line). Well, since there is a lack of truck drivers and equipment, there is literally no way to get the containers out of the terminal. Every day that goes by, charges are being added onto shipments, which ultimately ends up on an invoice billed to the customer. Some demurrage charges are able to be contested and refunded, but a refund does not always happen. \n\nThat isn't the worst part. Biden recently began imposing an \"emergency fee\" onto shipping lines to help combat port congestion. But guess what? Shipping lines are recently announced that they are going to start billing importers somewhere around $150 per cubic meter in additional fees. To put this into perspective, a 40 foot container, lets say has 60cbm of goods, will be charged an extra $9000 by shipping lines. Biden's emergency fee literally does nothing to address port congestion, and actually makes things WORSE.\n\nHere's what I'm afraid of. When demurrage charges get so high, customers could simply choose abandon their goods at the terminal. The cost of demurrage and other stupid fees could EASILY surpass the value of the actual goods. Why would a customer want to pay more than the goods of the shipment to have the shipment released to them? This poses a huge risk to shipping lines, importers, and everyone involved in the shipping industry right now. Also, don't get me started on per diem (for those of you interested, just Google it, it's an additional fee resulting in customers being unable to return their containers back to the terminal in time)\n\nThe amount of fees piling on that will ultimately land on consumers, combined with the demand for goods, is honestly kind of scary, and I have no idea how this is going to end if we don't get some kind of divine intervention ASAP.\n\ntldr; bad things are brewing in the shipping industry right now, and it has only been getting worse.",

        "selftext": "First off, I want to thank the WSB community. I'm not a trader. My time-consuming job makes it challenging to find spare time to research stocks. So my trading philosophy has been simple: keep my cash in ETFs, usually 50% in an S&amp;P 500 ETF and 50% in an investment grade fixed income ETF (depending on the market I will re-weight those allocations), and once I see a clear opportunity to buy, I buy. And WSB has helped me find those opportunities. I've maybe made 6-7 buys over the past 2 years, including:\n\n* Snowflake @ the dip (bought around $200)\n*  Luckin coffee @ about $2\n* Tesla @ $200\n* Shopify @ $350\n\nGranted, I haven't held all of these stocks to their peaks because of my paper thin hands, but have nonetheless made some good profits. And I owe that to the collective information on this forum.\n\nNow, I want to survey the forum here. What stocks do you think will flourish in 2021 and 2022? Where can I turn my $$ into $$$$?

        "selftext": "Disclaimer: This is not dd. This is opening a discussion for a certain factor of the gme report that is causing controversy\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere is a lot of speculation about whether the GME report suggests that shorts have not closed. The core of this comes down to the seeming disparity between this figure 5 and figure 6 of the report.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x2pvs79nfdu71.png?width=645&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=acd07db860fbef8fa7ca174479e2292812df46b3\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ssomo32zfdu71.png?width=618&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=24fd26f5e629a2e944ecac2ae22c4a937b1263b9\n\nThe figure 5 graph suggests that short interest fell by as much a 30% pre-new year which corresponds to a necessary buy volume of 21 million shares. Yet, when we look at figure 6, the cumulative buy volume by short-sellers doesn't seem to come close. Additionally, by feb 12 the short interest was reported around 30% (according to marketbeat) which translates to an almost 100% drop in si. A drop that big would require an average short buy volume of 4.4 million per day (70 mil/16 days). Yet figure 6 shows data not even close to that figure. This would imply extremely high levels of covering between febuary 5th and febuary 12th which doesn't seem reflected in the price action over that period.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat do the 'apes' say: Many individuals who are bullish on gme believe that this is evidence that the short interest data being reported is faulty in some manner. They believe that the low penalties for misrepresenting short interest are causing short hedge funds to underreport their positions. We all know that the short interest heavily affects the price movement of GameStop so this has some plausibility. Others suggest that the positions are being hidden through ftds or option tomfoolery. This is potentially less plausible because the reports specifically talks about ftds and it seems like they would have mentioned options if they could hide shorts.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat do the gay bears say: Many gay bears have generally responded by arguing that the 'apes' are seeing largely what they want to see. The report clearly states that the shorts covered and that the short interest is low (relatively speaking). Why would the SEC do something convoluted like make conflicting graphs? 'Apes' are being conspiratorial and are interpreting it wrong if they are getting such a bizarre result.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat are your interpretations of this data? I want to move the dialogue from unhelpful comment fights to here. (Any math I do is meant to be generally illustrative not 100% accurate)",

        "selftext": "Zillow\u2019s unexpected announcement this week that it\u2019s putting a temporary stop to its home-buying activities raised many analysts\u2019 eyebrows. And some argue that more concerning trends could be on the way. The service, Zillow Offers, is what\u2019s known as an \u201ciBuyer\u201d \u2014 it purchases and sells homes directly to consumers, typically renovating them in between. \n\nFollowing a report from Bloomberg, Zillow Z, +1.85% ZG, +3.98% confirmed that its Zillow Offers division would not be signing any additional new contracts to purchase homes through the end of 2021. In explaining the move, Zillow said the company was facing a backlog of renovations and dealing with operational-capacity issues. \n\n**Labor and material shortages-**\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re operating within a labor- and supply-constrained economy \u2014 inside a competitive real estate market, especially in the construction, renovation and closing spaces,\u201d Jeremy Wacksman, Zillow\u2019s chief operating officer, said in the announcement. She added that the pause would enable the company \u201cto focus on sellers already under contract\u201d and the company\u2019s existing inventory of homes. Other iBuyers have not followed suit, as of now. In fact, it\u2019s just the opposite \u2014 most of Zillow\u2019s competitors re-emphasized their expansion plans in response to the announcement.\n\n[https://www.marketwatch.com/story/zillow-pauses-home-buying-raising-red-flags-about-the-real-estate-market-11634678311?mod=mw\\_latestnews](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/zillow-pauses-home-buying-raising-red-flags-about-the-real-estate-market-11634678311?mod=mw_latestnews)",

        "selftext": "&gt; Netflix estimates that its latest megahit, [\u201cSquid Game,\u201d](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-13/netflix-says-squid-game-is-its-biggest-series-launch-ever)\u00a0will create almost\u00a0$900 million in value for the company, according to figures\u00a0seen by Bloomberg, underscoring the windfall that one megahit can generate in the streaming era.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Netflix differs from movie studios and TV networks in that it doesn\u2019t generate sales based on specific titles, instead using\u00a0its catalog and a steady drumbeat of new releases to entice customers every week. But the company does have a wealth of\u00a0data concerning what its customers watch, which the company uses to determine the value derived from individual programs.  \n&gt;  \n&gt; \u201cSquid Game\u201d stands out both for its popularity, and its relatively low cost. The South Korean show, about indebted people in a deadly contest for a cash prize,\u00a0generated $891.1 million in impact value, a\u00a0metric the company uses to assess the performance from individual shows. The show cost just $21.4 million to produce -- about $2.4 million an episode. Those figures are just for the first season, and stem from a document that details Netflix\u2019s performance metrics for the show. \n\n  [Netflix, Inc.

        "selftext": "CRSR probably draws the attention of the Reddit crowd due to its very high short interest of 37% of the float, along with cheap valuations. Partly for these reasons, Wall Street analysts have been calling for significant upside potential in Corsair stock, as we detail below.\n\nThe last year delivered an exceptional 130% gain to the company's bottom line. Although, its longer-term performance hasn't been as strong with three-year EPS growth being relatively non-existent overall. Therefore, it's fair to say that earnings growth has been inconsistent recently for the company.\n\nWith earnings growth that's superior to most other companies of late, Corsair Gaming has been doing relatively well. It might be that many expect the strong earnings performance to wane, which has kept the P/E from rising. If you like the company, you'd be hoping this isn't the case so that you could potentially pick up some stock while it's not quite in favor. Corsair Gaming (CRSR) reported 2nd Quarter June 2021 earnings of $0.33 per share on revenue of $472.9 million. This represents about a 22% increase from last year despite the economy reopening!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n7remyci72s71.png?width=692&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3fed04d4cfb054c4b320f94e8dfc92c4c772c785\n\n\\-Estimates expect earnings of $1.82 per share and revenue of $2.08 billion. These totals would mark changes of +13.75% and +22.19%, respectively, from last year.\n\n\\-CRSR recently refinanced their debt, meaning they will pay a lower interest rate increasing their earnings per share.\n\n\\-CRSR has also commited to paying down its debt strengthening its balance sheet.\n\n\\-The company said it continues to expect 2021 revenue of $1.90 billion to $2.10 billion. The current consensus revenue estimate is $2.02 billion for the year ending December 31, 2021.\n\nLooking ahead now, EPS is anticipated to climb by 12% per annum during the coming three years according to the eight analysts following the company. That's shaping up to be similar to the 12% each year growth forecast for the broader market.\n\nWith this information, we can see why Corsair Gaming is trading at a fairly similar P/E to the market. Apparently shareholders are comfortable to simply hold on while the company is keeping a low profile.\n\nI have 6,700 shares at 27.74",

        "selftext": "Hello everyone. I know most of you are idiots who managed to lose money during the greatest bull run in the history, but I have the need to share my thoughts, help the community and at least get you to start thinking about what if scenarios. Let me get straight to the point.\n\n# I think we will experience some headwinds over the next 12 months.\n\nThere. I said it. Now for those of you with higher IQ, let me explain why I think that.\n\n**1. Inflation is at the highest level it has been in the past 13 years (since 2008)**\n\nDespite what some of you may think, we cannot print money forever. Printer cannot go brrrr always. We had fun with the printer since March 2020, but the effects are starting to show. Food, gas, real estate, stocks, digital currencies, wage subsidies, unemployment benefits - the society is flooded with cash. We are literally swimming in it. Sure it's fun when SPY goes up **31.6%** over the past 12 months, but this leads to inflation and inflation is bad. Why? Because high inflation puts pressure on a government to increase the value of the state pension and unemployment benefits and other welfare payments as the cost of living climbs higher. Inflation expectations -&gt; wage demands -&gt; rise labour costs -&gt; lower  profits for businesses. This is why at some point, our saviour J Pow will need to address this. In fact, he already announced it, which leads to my second point.\n\n**2. FED announced tapering will start in November**\n\nTapering means the gradual slowing down of purchases of securities and bonds. Simply put - printer will slow down. Most of you have never seen the stock market without the printer. You think 31.6% a year for SPY is normal. You are not aware that SPY was flat for 13 years (*0% between Mar 2000 and Jan 2013*). Most of you are not reading the news. You did not read the news in Jan 2020. You though corona was a Chinese problem. You did not read the news in Mar 2020. You were buying puts, when J Pow publicly said he's going to turn on the printer. Even if you read that, you had no clue what that meant. You held your puts and watched them melt as printer did its thing. Now, we are in a similar situation. J Pow announced he will slow down the printer, you don't know what that means, you are still holding calls and looking to buy more because \"stocks always go up\".\n\nIn conclusion:  \nprinter brrrrrrrrrrrrrrr -&gt; stocks brrrrrrrrrrrrrrr  \nprinter brrr -&gt; stocks brrr\n\n**3. Interest rates will need to go up**\n\nOne way to curb inflation is to raise interest rates. Higher interest rates means it'll be harder to borrow money. Less borrowing, leads to less liquidity to buy houses and stocks. Less buying, prices cool down. I'm not calling for a crash, but a 10-20% cool-down will be enough to wipe out most of you with your clueless strategies, if we can even call them strategies.\n\n**4. China is slowing down**\n\nI know Evergrande paid its bills this month, but they did it by waiting until the last day before announcing bankruptcy. This is not normal. If they had so much trouble this month, who can guarantee they'll be able to pay them next month? On top of that, an average Chinese citizen realized that real estate does not always go up. This change in mindset will cause slight fear, which leads to lower demand for real estate which will eventually show who is over-leveraged. (*hint: It's Evergrande*) You might wonder, how would a slowdown in Chinese real estate affect us in North America? American corporations generate significant profits by selling stuff to Chinese people. If Chinese people are not happy about their houses and apartments going up in value, the last thing on their minds would be to buy new iPhones, purchase Teslas, and buy commodities to build more real estate.  \nWe are more connected that you think. When something happens in China, it affects everyone. Don't believe me? Go back to January 2020.\n\n**What should you do?**\n\nSlow down a bit. Relax. Think. Take it easy with calls. Take the foot of the gas pedal. I'm not calling for a crash. I'm not telling you to short the market. Just don't be caught off guard, when big boys cash their chips and go home. You don't won't be the last ones to leave the casino. That's all.",

        "selftext": "I sold a company I created, and after the press release went out, I was inundated with very gracious offers to take and manage my new found money for fees. At the time, I presumed these wealth managers, after managing hundreds of millions - if not billions - of other people\u2019s money for decades, would have developed advanced strategies and tactics for ensuring success. Surely, they would have teams of analysts scouring the markets for opportunities, technical indicators, news events, macroeconomic data and breakthrough innovations at all times to stay a step ahead of the pack. I was dead wrong.  \n\nWhat I discovered was an antiquated industry that relied heavily on the belief that they knew better and were on top of things. In fact, there was very little effort that went into managing OPM (other people\u2019s money), and that most of the energy went to finding and onboarding new clients. \n\nI\u2019m not saying that their strategies were bad or didn\u2019t work. I am only stating that they were neither complicated nor impressive. In short, anyone here could repeat the same strategies and save 1% of their money a year in perpetuity. Without further ado, here\u2019s what I learned:\n\n**Goldman Sachs**\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that there are various divisions within GS wealth management that handle money differently. I break it down into low net worth, mid-net worth, and high net worth offerings. The low net worth folks are given Marcus, an automated investment system that simply relies on ETFs paired with some basic bond funds. It\u2019s the same as buying Vanguard Target Retirement funds. \n\nThe mid-net worth offering is where I spent the bulk of time understanding. They find 30 stocks to invest in from different sectors with an attempt to represent the sector weighting of the S&amp;P 500. As the SPX is largely tech, they are overweight technology. Basically, they take the SPY and cut it down from 500 companies to 30 companies. \n\nWhy would they offer a less diverse array of stocks? \n\nThey state as the reason that they are better able to manage 30 investments than 500, and since they are not trying to beat the returns of the index - their words - they\u2019d rather find stocks with lower beta (volatility) and thus likely lower returns. \n\nThey locate these stocks by running basic stock screens within the S&amp;P 500 once per quarter to ensure solid performance and find better investments. They target a 6% annual return after accounting for their 1% fee on your money and they offer some financial planning services if you have over a certain amount of money invested with them.  This amounts to $10,000 per year for a $1M portfolio for many years - a lot of money to part with.\n\nDid I mention, you have to liquidate your entire portfolio prior to working with them, unless you happen to already own one of the 30 stocks they pick? So there are tax consequences of getting involved.\n\nFor the HNW folks, the above offering is available and they offer additional products, such as the ability to invest in private equity, REITs and hedge funds. As you might imagine, the more money they manage, the more \u201cfree\u201d accounting services they include.\n\n**Personal Capital**\n\nThis may actually be my favorite, given the simplicity of it. They take the main sector ETFs and eliminate any stocks that are losing money, to recreate their own ETFs by sector. They charge you a fee to use their ETFs. \n\nThey start with an equal amount of capital going to each sector ETF, but allocate more money to the sectors with the worst performance record from the year before. They do this annually. They do nothing all year. \n\nThey charge a fee for managing your money. I recall it being 25 or 35 basis points, but you have to also pay to use their ETFs so it creeps towards the better part of a percentage point very quickly and is much more expensive than simply buying a Vanguard S&amp;P 500  fund or a group of the sector ETFs calling it quits.\n\n**Ritholtz Wealth Management**\n\nIf you\u2019ve watched CNBC regularly, you\u2019d recognize the commentator Josh Brown - a partner of Ritholtz Wealth Management. He\u2019s the one with the thick New York City accent. When I found out I may have the chance to have his insights managing my money, I was excited as he always seemed so knowledgeable. But the wealth management shop was not impressive. \n\nIn fact, their model was exactly the same as that of Goldman Sachs: they pick about 30 stocks, stick your money in them, rotate them every quarter, and keep volatility low on the stocks they pick. They target 5-6% annually, net of fees. Yes, you heard that correctly, 5-6%. \n\nThe next group of wealth management shops all fell into one of three other categories: SPY collars, ETF aggregators, or tactical investors\n\n**SPY Collars**\n\nThis strategy involved putting all of your money into the SPY ETF then selling call options on that investment out of the money a few months out at a time. They take the income from the sale of these options and purchase out of the money puts on the SPY for similar expiration dates. This strategy enables them to control your target return while limiting downside. For those who are not used to options, here\u2019s how it works.\n\nLet\u2019s say the SPY is trading at $400. You own it. You sell someone else the right to buy it from you for $440 for $40 per call. So long as the SPY stays under 480 (440 + the call premium value), the other person will not execute the call and you get to keep the money for the call premium. If the SPY goes above 480, you have to either sell your shares at $440 (plus pocket the 40 per call, making this a sale at 480) or buy the call back at a higher price than what you sold it for. You\u2019d lose money on it, but the SPY shares have gained in value, so you still come out ahead. You are just not as ahead as you would be had you simply bought and held the SPY all the way to $490. This creates a ceiling in terms of the max amount you can obtain on the upside of your investment. \n\nThe option puts work the other way, protecting your investment on the way down. Since you used the premium collected on the sale of the call to buy the puts, you haven\u2019t spent any money but have bought yourself insurance. If the SPY drops, the value of your put option (a short on your own investment) increases. This increase offsets your losses, protecting you, especially in the case of extreme correction. \n\nIf the SPY rises, you lose the value of your put, so you have to account for that in your net income for the investment.\n\nIf you don\u2019t follow this, don\u2019t worry, the net effect is they use options to prevent a major loss but in doing so, they also prevent you from having any major gains. You are trapped or collared within an acceptable range of returns. Over time, you will not beat the S&amp;P 500 index with this strategy and they say this. \n\nSo there is only value to this strategy if you simply are unwilling to trade a really bad year once in a while for a great year once in a while. It\u2019s mostly about your investment time horizon and whether you need regular access to the money. \n\n**ETF and Mutual Fund Aggregators**\n\nAbout 7 firms I interviewed used this strategy. I heard the same thing so often, I thought maybe they were dumbing it down for me. Essentially, they just bought all sector ETFs or a basket of mutual funds for you. A few of the firms would use the collars I spoke of above if the market got a little choppy, but most did not. \n\nThis strategy was most common with smaller wealth management shops - under $250M AUM - which tried to differentiate themselves as financial planners that happen to look after your money. The bulk of them did very very little to watch the market and most flat out stated they only looked at these quarterly. \n\nI could not understand what they did all day until one referred to himself as a market psychologist because his job was to calm clients down when the market shits itself. I have vodka for that, so this strategy was not for me.\n\n**Tactical Firms**\n\nThese firms were harder to find and their DNA was more similar to day traders in terms of their mentality. They invested in a basket of stocks they thought represented a blend of value, growth, and good dividends. They chose them annually but were much more likely to liquidate and go to cash if they thought a correction was coming so they had cash to buy the dip. \n\nOne thing I did learn from them though was tax loss harvesting - a term for specifically taking losses on investments to offset gains on others. \n\nThe best way they did this was by rolling calls on equities that had risen in value. Imagine holding Apple stock and selling a call on it. If Apple goes up, you must then choose to sell the stock or buy the call back at a higher price for a loss. If you do the latter, in year 1 and sell a second option in year 2 at the same price or more than the call you bought back, you can write off the loss in year 1 while avoiding actual losses. \n\nYou can roll calls like this forever, amassing paper losses while you actually gain in the value of the underlying equity. It was a nice trick I\u2019ve used many times now, especially when I want to sell something I\u2019ve held for years with significant gains. \n\nTheir desire to protect the portfolio, I felt, prevented them from participating in the quick rebounds in the market. In 2019, when I spoke to them, they felt a crash was imminent and had gone to 60% cash in their portfolio. I never reached back out to see how they did, but I suspect they were buying the dips in March 2020. \n\nTheir overall returns were around 10% but not as good as simply buying the SPY and holding. But they did seem to be able to minimize the downside of some on major events. \n\n**In the end, I never hired any of them.** I decided instead to use what I learned and what I knew and manage my own money. In case you read this far and are curious, yes, my returns have beaten all these firms\u2019 average returns and I\u2019ve actually learned a lot in the process. Sharing in case anyone could use the strategies.",

I have a neurotic obsession with finding stocks the market has unfairly beaten down, and it has rewarded me handsomely.\n\nNIO and BNGO were high conviction stocks and still are. They are both in spaces I know well as a gearhead and physician. However, conviction doesn\u2019t describe how strongly I feel about SAVA SAVA is a once in a generation opportunity. Why?\n\n**TLDR: IMHO, SAVA will announce early FDA approval as it has shown promise across thirty-eight measures. When the approval is announced SAVA\u2019s market cap will explode. History says the stock will 8.5x in one trading day. I believe, long-term SAVA will increase 75x based on a 500 billion TAM. Proof below. Drop your crayons yet?**\n\n**History Lesson For You Retards**:\n\nOn Monday, June 7th, $BIIB announced FDA Accelerated Approval of its Alzheimer's medication. The market cap increased by **$17 billion**!\n\nOn June 24th, $LLY announced FDA Breakthrough Therapy Designation of Their Alzheimer's medication. The market cap increased by **$15 billion**.\n\nLast Friday, Roche announced the FDA Breakthrough Therapy Designation of its Alzheimer's medication. Its market cap increased by **$13 billion**.\n\nSAVA's Market cap sits at $2 billion. If the market cap increases by the Median ($15 billion), the **SP will 8.5x**. Oh, did I mention the above changes happened on ONE trading day? It did.\n\nCredit to [https://www.reddit.com/user/Eddie\\_from\\_Torrance/](https://www.reddit.com/user/Eddie_from_Torrance/)\n\nAllow me to depict a trend you smooth-brained apes probably missed above.\n\nBIIB's market cap is 42 billion\n\nLLY's market cap is 223 billion\n\nRoche's market cap is 337 billion\n\nSmaller market caps move more than larger market caps. Further, LLY and RHHBY did not get \\*full\\* approval. They earned breakthrough therapy designation, which means the FDA will rush the process for approval. The FDA requires more testing and review. Put another way; there is still uncertainty around FDA approval, but the market cap blew its top. Lastly, SAVA's data is far superior to BIIB, LLY, and Roche. There is no comparison. Since SAVA has the smallest market cap of the bunch and the best medication, I won't be surprised if our SP has a more dramatic rise.\n\nWhy is the market valuing Alzheimer's medications so opulently? Because the market is massive and desperate for treatment. Currently, half of all elderly hospitalizations are related to Alzheimer's. If we continue at the current rate, every single hospital bed in the US will be full with Alzheimer's patients.Biden stated, that this will balloon to a trillion dollar problem. Alzheimiers has political backing (Biden has plenty of reason to fund dementia research :)). To better understand the market and valuation (and FUD that created this buying opportunity), please see my earlier posts on SAVA.\n\nPost #1 [https://www.reddit.com/r/SAVA\\_stock/comments/pmy1uz/calling\\_all\\_savage\\_apes/?utm\\_source=share&amp;utm\\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/SAVA_stock/comments/pmy1uz/calling_all_savage_apes/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)\n\nPost #2\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pz6w8h/sava\\_cause\\_more\\_wrinkle/?utm\\_source=share&amp;utm\\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pz6w8h/sava_cause_more_wrinkle/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)\n\nIn this post, I will be concentrate on the odds of FDA approval. A more dry subject, but nonetheless critical, so focus.\n\n**FDA Approval Process:**\n\nFirst, let us take a quick look at the process of FDA approval. Generally, A drug like Simufilam (SAVA\u2019s Alzheimer\u2019s medication) goes through the following stages. Scientists gather anecdotal information and generate a hypothesis. Scientists then test the theory in a Petri dish or flask (Im dumbing it down, dont take me literally). If the lab data supports the mechanism of action, then we move to animal testing. If animal testing has positive results, then on to human trials. The FDA splits human trials into Phase 1,2,3. Phase 1 tests how the drug interacts in the human body, followed by phase 2 trials, which is meant to evaluate safety and in some cases potential efficacy. Positive results here advance the medication to phase 3. Phase 3 is the big one. Passing phase 3 equals FDA approval. Finally, we have the NDA and Phase 4, which is outside the scope of this post, but essentially almost all drugs get through this part. Require. More. Wrinkle.\n\nWhat stage is SAVA at in the FDA approval process? SAVA initiated phase 3 this month! We already made it through all the other testing (most medications do not make it this far into testing).\n\nWhat are our chances of phase three success (FDA approval)?\n\nIf you haven't already googled it, the possibility of success is a disappointing 50%! A very binary 50%. $0 or hundreds of billions of dollars of revenue. If thats all there were to consider, then this would be a simple gamble. Put what you are willing to lose and check on it next year. Either your $1000 will go to 100k or $0. Most of you apes would take that chance, but there is so much more to consider, and it's ALL in our favor. In the following paragraph, I will explain why the odds of FDA approval are much higher for us, like over 90%.\n\n**Consistency of Data:**\n\nRemi stated that people are underestimating how \\*consistent\\* our data has been. What does he mean? Let's tally up the data that shows Simufilam \"consistently\" works.\n\nA 28 day multi-center, placebo-controlled, randomized trial with 64 patients. This trial measured:\n\n1. Abeta42\n2. Total Tau\n3. P-tau181\n4. Neurogranin\n5. Neurofilament Light Chain\n6. YKL-40\n7. Paired Associates Learning Test\n8. Spatial Working Memory Test\n9. IL-6\n10. sTREM2\n11. HMGB1\n12. Albumin\n13. IgG\n14. Filamin A Linkages to alpha7 Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptor\n15. Toll-like Receptor 4 in Subject Lymphocytes\n16. Plasma P-tau181\n17. SavaDx (A proprietary and very exciting biomarker that we will discuss in future posts. Hint: It could potentially be worth more than Simufilam).\n\nSo how many of these measures showed improvement with Simufilam? EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM! Fifteen of them are spinal fluid tests or blood tests. Two of them are cognitive tests.\n\nCassava Sciences stated in their slide deck:\n\n\"98% of patients treated with Sumifilam 50 mg or 100 mg b.i.d. for 28 days showed improvements in validated biomarkers of AD pathology; neuroinflammation; and neurodegeneration; with no safety issues.\"\n\nA quick point about valid concerns that FUDsters have blown out of proportion: all studies have limitations and valuable criticisms. This study is no exception. We can discuss regression to the mean in one of the cognitive tests (1 of the 17 measures), why the N varied (Research gate commentator SAVAge explained the variance of N), the significance of the unpowered tests (applies to two of the secondary endpoints out of 17 tests), the short duration, etc. Here is the overarching theme; All studies have useful criticisms which scientists examine and modify the following test and retest their hypothesis. So a balanced and correct perspective is that Simufilam (SAVA's Medication) showed promise with SEVENTEEN different measures, which is dramatic (epic); there is no other way to put it. Moving on, how do we retest to continue to verify the data! What did SAVA do? They retested data, and they continued to stun (we will review that data soon).\n\n**More Consistent Results:**\n\nThis study was followed by more Open label data over 12 months. This study measured the following:\n\n1. P-tau\n2. Total Tau\n3. Abeta42\n4. Neurofilament light chain\n5. Neurogranin\n6. YKL-40\n7. Soluble TREM2\n8. HMGB1\n9. ADAS cog-11 (reported at 6, 9, and 12 months)\n10. NPI (reported at 6, 9, and 12 months)\n11. SavaDx\n\nWhich of the 11 measures improved in this trial (three of them repeated multiple times over months)? EVERY SINGLE ONE. Eight biomarkers improved at six months, and SAVA will be reporting more biomarker data soon. The cognition data (the gold standard by the FDA called ADAS cog) showed the best Phase 2 OL data for Alzheimer's EVER for a US-based trial.\n\n1. It is historical, literally.\n2. You should be excited. There are results, and then there are SAVA's results (see post #2).\n3. It is also the most crucial data point from all the measures discussed.\n\nYes, the data is single-arm, open-label, which is a legitimate limitation (as is expected in all trials, but blown out of proportion by shorts), meaning the data is more likely to be susceptible to bias. However, SAVA took steps to address bias (placebo effect), and several other factors make bias unlikely. I'll state what negates bias and translate it to \u201cape\u201d for you degenerates.\n\n1. SAVA compared the cognition data to a cohort of 20,000 patients, meaning SAVA correlated the data to a group of twenty thousand patients with Alzheimer's. If Simufilam works, you will see a difference between twenty thousand patients and the group treated. The group treated had a marked benefit over the twenty thousand patients.\n2. The data was robust for twelve months. How does this make the placebo effect less likely? There is no way the placebo effect is that pronounced. Further, The placebo effect in Alzheimer's (AD) patients wears off and is usually subtle. Placebo can not explain the degree and duration of improvement (a little more on this later).\n3. It correlated well with thirty-eight (thats right, thirty-eight. I\u2019m not done tallying up) other measures, including biomarkers which make placebo even less likely.\n4. Duration of cognitive improvement also makes placebo less likely. (discussed above)\n5. Some disease criteria have heavy bias. Said another way, they lack objectivity. Examples of symptoms that are prone to bias include pain or energy. Society of Interdisciplinary Placebo Studies has studied and documented this well. ADAS cog measured does not contain as much bias. The data is more objective (as mentioned above, it is considered the gold standard by the FDA). Finally, the biomarkers have no bias. Biomarkers measure a quanitiy of something in numbers. In this case they are measuring substances in the spinal fluid and blood. Our biomarkers data is excellent and supports the thesis.\n6. The post below is an MD, P.hD. with &gt; one hundred fifty associated publications discussing the open-label data. Worth reading if you\u2019re still concerned about OL data.\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/SAVA\\_stock/comments/px943f/musings\\_of\\_an\\_academic\\_surgeon/?utm\\_source=share&amp;utm\\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/SAVA_stock/comments/px943f/musings_of_an_academic_surgeon/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)\n\nBack to the topic of using historical data as a control arm (described in #1) has limitations. Mainly because Alzheimer's disease changes over time, it is treated and diagnosed differently. Alzheimer's today may not be the same as Alzheimer's 30 years ago. One neurologist stated that we should use the data from a more recent trial. (See post number two). Comparing SAVA's data to LLY's shows a continued robust medication effect (credit to Jones trading).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j3x127lar7t71.png?width=735&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d923ea5d9c3f63b2b1b10405c660ebb1c2647200\n\nI will put a slide up of the preclinical data that I haven\u2019t mentioned. It also supports FDA approval. The Simufilam effects were reproduced.\n\n* Brain tissue and measured in two separate ways\n* Mice and checked in two separate ways.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ard5czcir7t71.png?width=1450&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7262951bee78e0308ce87407974766cc94a7b6c9\n\nLastly, these limitations and criticisms would carry much more weight if we were talking about one criterion. We aren't talking about one criterion; we are talking about thirty-eight of them. Let me give you an example. If you are looking for a park, and thirty-eight people point you in the same direction, there is almost no chance that all thirty-eight people are wrong. Yes, one of the dudes was a retarded ape, another had no wrinkles, and one was sniffing crayons in an alley. However, taken together (the crayon sniffing and all), everyone is \\*consistently\\* telling you to go in the same direction. There is almost no chance all thirty-eight of them are wrong as a whole. The same is true for Simufilam's data. If thirty-eight measures say the drug works, then the drug works. We are looking at AD twenty-two distinct ways (Dont ask what the difference between measures and views is. You dont have enough wrinkles), and all of them show improvement.\n\nSo to summarize Simufilam has shown improvement in thirty-eight different measures, safely. Most importantly, the best results were from the most critical measure, ADAS cog. That is what Remi meant when he said people are missing how \\*consistent\\* the data is.\n\nSo does consistent data, robust in degree and duration, increase our chances of Phase 3 success? You bet it does, and there is more.\n\n**The Design:**\n\nLet us analyze the trial's design and discuss how that affects the odds of phase 3 success.\n\nRemi said:\n\n\"I believe these special protocol assessments (SPA) mark a meaningful and encouraging milestone for Cassava Sciences...The SPAs underscore our alignment with FDA on key scientific, clinical, and regulatory requirements of our Phase 3 program of simufilam in Alzheimer's disease.\"\n\nSAVA earned a SPA from the FDA. It is fundamentally an agreement in which the FDA specifies how to get approval. There is no subjectivity in the decision. Cassava and the FDA designed the trial together, and Cassava knows precisely what it needs for the said approval. How does this make phase three success more probable? There is no guesswork involved. SAVA and the FDA are on the same page, and each knows precisely what the other expects. That is why Remi considers it a milestone.\n\nFor phase 3, the primary endpoint (goal) is improvement in cognition and function. Wait, didn't we already accomplish that? Why yes, we did. How well did we do it? Spectacularly well! Better than has ever been done before. If SAVA can reproduce phase 2 data in phase 3, then bingo! Even better, though, we don't have to show actual improvement; that would be sensational, but if we can deliver a slowing in the \\*rate\\* of decline (as opposed to substantial improvement), then also, bingo! Wait, all SAVA has to do is show much less effect to get approval than we already did, TWICE? Yes. For a better understanding of why the FDA set the bar so low, please see post #1.\n\nThis point is so critical; I'm going to drive it home again. Redline is our data, Greenline is LLY's data, and Grayline is expected decline in AD patients.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m5gd626cr7t71.png?width=735&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f26a13823c928b25ad9e006cc45863f3ce53c552\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3x8h6h0lh4t71.png?width=720&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7b2a7ee03af771\n\nThe FDA was impressed enough with LLY's data that the FDA granted breakthrough therapy. If we can accomplish what LLY did, we can get approval! One last time, if the redline were to come ALLLL the way down to the green line (show a fraction of the benefit that Simufilam has already shown), that's still enough for approval! (Graph above).\n\nThe single most significant reason for phase 3 trials to fail is, the medication was unable to show efficacy. To be exact, in one study, 57% of trials fail for this reason. For all the reasons pointed out above (and more to follow), proving efficacy is a walk in the park for SAVA. No sweat.\n\nSince we are discussing reproducing the data, let's see how close the phase 3 design is to phase 2. The more alike the trails, the more likely we will get the same results. Phase 3 closely mirrors phase 2 in design, as all we need to do is show cognitive benefit as we already have multiple times.\n\nIn addition, one key characteristic of the phase two design is the multi-center nature of the trial. Multi-center means that SAVA collected the data from centers and patients across multiple sites in the US. The opposite of multi-center is gathering data at a single location. A single location phase 2 means that the biotech is collecting the data and could unconsciously introduce bias because they want the trial to succeed. Further, the patient population is more homogeneous (at a single location), so results may not apply to the general population. It is a set up to fail phase 3, which pretty much requires the trial to be multi-center.\n\nSAVA is not likely to fall victim to these two biases (like other biotechs) as they had two separate phase 2 trials. One was at nine centers, and the other was at 16 different clinical sites. Both times the centers were independent of SAVA and across the US and Canada. The doctors and SAVA were not affiliated. As a tangent, this is also a vital point to understand if you think Remi cooking numbers in his basement. This isn't a small sus operation in someone's garage.\n\nP-hacking is a more nefarious (and shortsightedness by Admin) reason for Phase two success followed by Phase three failure. P-hacking is essentially throwing the kitchen sink at the wall and seeing what sticks. If you throw enough things at the wall, something will stick, by pure chance-not because it\u2019s sticky. Then the company proclaims victory stating our phase two trials show that X substance is sticky. Because substance X is not sticky, when our nefarious biotech tests the said sticky substance in phase three, it doesn\u2019t stick. The easiest way to tell if a Biotech is p-hacking is when they only report one measure of success. SAVA reported thirty-eight. To say that SAVA\u2019s thirty-eight measures correlated by chance or luck are not logical. If you want to bet on that lack of logic, you might as well go to Vegas.\n\nAn often-quoted predictor of success is a history of success. While SAVA has not gotten FDA approval, itself, its current leadership has fourteen FDA drug approvals in neuroscience and other areas of clinical medicine.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r29dddvmr7t71.png?width=1476&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d8b741c5e8bddfd251de7a10c04f5eb680f44503\n\n**Other Reasons for the Failure of Phase 3:**\n\nThe second most common reason to fail phase 3 trials is safety issues. Simufilam has had no problems with safety. Phase 1 tested 12 patients, Phase 2 tested 64, and Phase 2 OL is testing 200 patients. So 276 patients have taken the medication safely with no serious adverse events. Also, to highlight one point. Trials have protocols. If there is a serious safety even, then it must be reported to the FDA immediately. No one is waiting for the 12-month data release or some other prespecified date. That is why I started the OL safety data includes 200 patients, not the 50 patients we have data.\n\nTrials also fail because patients keep dropping out. SAVA's lack of patient dropout is an excellent sign. Less than 10% of patients have dropped out. (Ape feel good, ape keep taking medication). Compare this to BIIB's Alzheimer's trial in which the dropout rate was almost 50%. What causes patients to drop out? Patients and families don't see a benefit, and the treatment has a lot of side effects. SAVA's quit rate is a good indicator that patients are tolerating the medication well (Simufilam is safe), and the patients/and their families are seeing a benefit.\n\nFDA has set the bar for passing phase 3 in Alzheimer's very low. Why? Because 6 million patients are without any treatment. Something is better than nothing. For a more detailed explanation of the extent of the problem, please see post #1.\n\nSummary: SAVA only needs to show a fraction of the benefit they have already demonstrated in two multi-center trials. The only material difference between Phase 2 and Phase 3 is that phase 3 has more patients. The more similar phase 2 is to phase 3, the higher the probability of reproducing results. The trials are certainly very similar. The previous and ongoing trials have a meager dropout rate which is a good sign.\n\n**Even More Reasons to Phase 3 Trials Fail:**\n\nNone of the following reasons even remotely apply to SAVA; I only included it to be complete.\n\n22% of trials fail due to a lack of funding. In August 2021, SAVA had over 270 million in cash, 20 million annual cash burn, and no debt. Further, Remi announced a partnership with nondebt and non-dilutive funding within \"weeks to months.\" All that to say, funding isn't a reason we will fail phase 3.\n\nFailing to maintain suitable manufacturing protocols has been cited as a reason to fail phase 3. SAVA announced it has partnered with Evonik, one of the world's largest drug manufacturers in the world, to produce its supply of Simufilam. We shouldn't have an issue here.\n\nSome trials have difficulty recruiting. Anecdotally, several investors have stated that they called to have their loved ones enrolled, and they shared their experience. The research sites reported heavy call volumes and a lot of interest in enrolling. In addition, there are 6 million Alzheimer's patients in the US with no effective treatment. Enrolling patients is not a problem for SAVA, as demand isn't an issue.\n\nCollaboration between Industry and Academics increases the odds of success. Check!\n\nEconomic viability is a reason trials fail. We have already discussed the TAM. SAVA is viable and thriving.\n\nI struggled to keep this post short. There is so much more I wanted to say and data I wanted to present, but I removed it\u2014due to length, I decided to discuss the pending partnership announcement and chances of EARLY (keyword being \\*early\\*) approval for a future post. In that one, I will also discuss why SavaDx is worth billions of dollars and no one is talking about it.\n\nLastly, if I sound cheesy or preachy, apologies, but it must be said. I hate f\\*cking shorts. If you hate them, spread this message, and pitch in to help the cause.\n\nRead this post to understand how badly these families need help.\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/q5c5jx/dad\\_has\\_alzheimers\\_and\\_is\\_being\\_treated\\_with/?utm\\_source=share&amp;utm\\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/Alzheimers/comments/q5c5jx/dad_has_alzheimers_and_is_being_treated_with/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)\n\nSources:\n\n[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6092479/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6092479/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6092479/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6092479/)\n\n[https://www.nuventra.com/resources/blog/why-do-clinical-trials-fail/](https://www.nuventra.com/resources/blog/why-do-clinical-trials-fail/)\n\n[https://www.nuventra.com/resources/blog/placebo-response-phase-3-failures/](https://www.nuventra.com/resources/blog/placebo-response-phase-3-failures/)\n\n[https://www.cassavasciences.com/static-files/9e8933b4-b67f-4e9c-b701-250d9b4d5868](https://www.cassavasciences.com/static-files/9e8933b4-b67f-4e9c-b701-250d9b4d5868)\n\nNot medical or financial advice.

        "selftext": "This post is a summary of comments on threads and blog posts comparing traditional IRAs to Roths. In particular, I wanted to comment on and offer some arguments against 5 major points that find their way into many of the comparison threads.\n\n**1st sentiment to dispute: low income earners who expect to make more later should do Roths, high income earners who expect to make less later should do traditional.**\n\nI have seen this point a few times:\n\n&gt;If you\u2019re in a high bracket and expect little or no income in retirement take traditional. Otherwise if you\u2019re in a low bracket now and expect more income in retirement take Roth. Or just do both.\n\nThis is how I used to think and on the surface, it is an accurate statement. I myself am currently in a high earning tax bracket, and have favored traditional IRAs historically assuming that I'll be making less in retirement. And that is true, I will have more available cash at the current time and will be paying a lower effective tax rate at the time of withdrawal.\n\nThere's one major problem: while it is true that for high income earners using a Roth you are paying a higher current tax rate, *you are paying a 0% tax rate on your gains.* This 0% tax on capital gains usually outweighs the taxes saved at time of deposit with a traditional IRA. What's even worse is that this money is taxed as ordinary income instead of as capital gains.\n\n\\-\n\n**2nd point to dispute: the investment accounts work out to be the same over time.**\n\nThis leads me to the next sleight-of-hand that a lot of traditional IRA advocates try to pull. Take a look at [this Excel sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kZ7Qnwh1lsi87to4LpgBbVHDb3iJ7nH1-7pONCzU3yo/edit) that calculates gains for traditional vs Roth.\n\nNow it's tempting to look at these numbers and think \"Oh see, there you go. It doesn't matter, you end up with the same money either way.\" But look at the assumptions this sheet is making: Instead of having you max out your Roth, it assumes that the 5k you were going to put into your traditional IRA is reduced to 3.5k with your Roth. This is not what happens and is such a dramatic error that I think it's intentional -- who doesn't max out their Roth if they can? You're not depositing less, you're depositing the maximum and paying more in taxes (ie. losing available cash). Then, you make the same gains but with a Roth they're not taxed.\n\nUsing the scenario in the linked Excel chart we can more accurately reflect what happens for most people: you have $1250 of extra available cash each year with a traditional. 1250 x 12 = $15k over 12 years that you would have had at the cost of of $18.3k of additional taxes at retirement (with a Roth paying 37% taxes now vs with a traditional IRA paying 22% at retirement).\n\nIf you want to do the numbers again, here is another example taken from a comment comparing IRAs to Roths with the following math:\n\n&gt;assuming 30% tax  \n&gt;  \n&gt;10,000 = 7,000 after tax going into roth = $122,145.82 after 30years @ 10%  \n&gt;  \n&gt;10,000 full going into trad/401k = $174,494 after 30years @ 10% = $122,145.82 after paying 30% tax.\n\nThis is disingenuous. Remember, a Roth is not \"tax free\" but *post-tax*. The numbers evolve differently if you are maxing your IRA out.\n\n* *Roth investment*: 15,900 = 10,000 after tax going into Roth at 37% tax rate = $175k after 30 years at 10% - $5,900 of less available cash at the time of deposit (with a higher tax rate and principal) + $54k gained (\"tax free\" or post-tax gains) at the time of withdrawal = **$49.7k overall gains.**\n* *Traditional investment*: 10,000 pre-tax going into traditional IRA with $5.9k more available cash at time of deposit, in exchange for 22% tax rate at retirement instead of 37% at time of deposit as would have occurred with a Roth = $175k after 30 years; 54k gained but taxed at 22% instead of 37% = **42k overall gains.** In most of the scenarios I calculated, Roths came out ahead in the long run.\n\nSo, taking into account the different expected tax rates, with a traditional IRA you are giving up 7k of long term gains for an additional 5.9k of available cash at the current time. What you do with this money determines its *opportunity cost*.\n\nThis is a stronger [retirement tool](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VZ4wKbUXdc8VA0mG4ri2wP9VuZCwae7b9MvA4u2HT7w/copy) developed by u/jeff_varszegi from [this recent post](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/owf0zi/spreadsheet_roth_vs_traditional_401ks_and_iras/) if any of you are familiar. There are some aspects that caught my attention as needing refinement (discussed [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/owf0zi/spreadsheet_roth_vs_traditional_401ks_and_iras/hhdvbrq/?context=3)), but my understanding is very basic and I could be missing something.\n\n\\-\n\n**3rd point to dispute: An anti-Roth post at Go Curry Cracker**\n\nThere is a well known anti-Roth post at Go Curry Cracker entitled \"The Great Roth Controversy\" (I can't link the url as it is not allowed in the subreddit). The amount of mental gymnastics that the post undergoes to make its points is staggering:\n\n&gt;Dollars saved in a Traditional 401k / IRA are pre-tax.\u00a0 We pay no income tax on dollars going in, an immediate savings of up to 39.6%, the highest marginal rate.\u00a0 The invested funds are allowed to grow **tax free**, so all interest, dividends, and capital gains are untaxed until withdrawn from the account.\u00a0 Upon withdrawal, all funds are treated as ordinary income, similar to a paycheck.\n\nThis is very inaccurate wording. The invested funds in an IRA don't grow \"tax free\". As said by the author themselves in the first sentence, they grow **pre-tax**. The invested funds in a Roth also don't grow \"tax free\" but **post-tax**. This is the major benefit of a Roth over traditional.\n\nThen the post starts talking about theoretical scenarios where a family would be paying 40% taxes with a Roth but would be reduced to poverty level income in retirement -- the so called \"first and last dollar\" argument. This is incredibly misleading. Instead it should be a \"last and last dollar\" argument. What are you paying as far as a marginal tax rate on the Traditional vs the Roth -- ie. what would an individual have been making otherwise. You have to take into account other income streams to know your base income and effective/marginal tax rates.\n\nAnother point made in this blog is that the greater available cash with a traditional IRA can then be used to invest in an index fund anyways, functionally becoming a Roth at annual capital gains tax rates. First off, why wouldn't you want post-tax gains? The point they leave unspoken is you're paying a premium for more available cash at the current time with a traditional IRA. And that's assuming an individual invests this money -- the average person is actually just redistributing savings.\n\nFor high earners that will earn less at retirement, a Roth requires a higher initial investment, but with the benefit of greater long term cash gains. With a traditional IRA, on the other hand, you are functionally increasing *available cash* because you're paying the lower tax rate that will exist when you retire. This is at the expense of *post-tax gains*.\n\nFor low earners that expect to earn *more* at retirement than they are currently, a Roth will have a lower tax rate fixed at the time of deposit as well as the \"tax-free\" gains. This is a double-win scenario with a Roth. If they had invested in a traditional IRA, it would have been a double loss.\n\n\\-\n\n**4th point to dispute: It's pointless to try to predict the future.**\n\nAnother argument I've heard is that tax rates are difficult to predict in the future. While researching this idea I came across the following charts:\n\nI'm not a tax expert, but from these it appears fairly reasonable to guess that incremental tax brackets won't be changing dramatically in the next few decades. If I am understanding trends shown in the linked charts, if I'm in a higher income tax bracket at retirement, then I will be paying lower taxes than now and if I'm in a lower income tax bracket at retirement (which is more likely if I haven't developed passive income) I will be paying higher taxes than now.\n\nThe more important point, as shown in the math above, is that for the average person, *tax rates* matter less than *post-tax ('tax-free') gains.* That is to say: the amount you gain in a post-tax retirement account will usually be more than the amount you save by a lower effective tax rate in a pre-tax retirement account, even in a top tax bracket.\n\nOf course this is not a guarantee. Your Roths could be invested poorly, there could be a revolution and the entire tax structure we've had for the last century could be changed to a universal standard tax rate, you could win the lottery, etc. but at some point we have to accept that we're dealing with probabilities. If you haven't developed a cumulatively progressive source of passive income *and* you're not in a defined hierarchy (ie. a partnership track in a law firm or medical group, a path to senior management at a large corporation, etc) or you sell a product that can be leveraged to economies of scale (ie. a brand-name app), you will probably be in an eat-what-you-kill situation at retirement and so be making less in retirement than you are in middle age.\n\n\\-\n\n**5th point to dispute: That there are universal solutions. Remember:** ***one size fits all is a size that fits none.***\n\n**A comment I've come across is that having both a traditional IRA and a Roth is good because you're \"diversifying\".** The reasoning behind this is that a traditional IRA will be counted as part of taxable income in retirement and a Roth can be used for additional tax-free withdrawals that would put one out of their desired tax bracket.\n\nThis doesn't make sense as a general rule and must be calculated for your individual circumstances. By my own personal math, for example, it is a bad idea for me to do a traditional IRA because the lower tax rate at retirement would not compensate for the tax-free gains of a Roth. This is an example of where something that sounds like good advice (ie. \"It's always good to diversify.\") actually takes you down a less financially successful path.\n\nAnother point to keep in mind is that your year to year tax situation matters a great deal. Let's say you retire early, get laid off or have a year where you are transitioning jobs so your income is low. This is a great opportunity for a Roth IRA conversion ladder -- ie. moving your pre-tax (IRA/401k) money into to post tax (Roth) accounts. Use this year as an opportunity to pay the lower effective tax rate at deposit *and* get the benefits of post-tax gains. A double-whammy of tax gains.\n\nLooking at your specific life circumstances make it more likely that you will pick the retirement portfolio that applies to your particular path. Barring extreme examples, however, a Roth will be the better choice for most.",

        "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nI did put a lot of research into the current situation for quite some time and finally build a portfolio I am 100% behind long-term. However, the more I learned, the more sure I am that we will experience a market crash rather soon, than late.\n\nI am not here to debate whether or not you think this is true, but the situation for this thought game is that we might see a crash similar in numbers, not principle like 2008' all over again.In general, during times of high inflation, most businesses will not come out well. The earnings will go up, but they need to put more money into their own business to even stay in the same place. A hedge for this are companies that can easily scale their business without needed money flow. I am looking at you Facebook, who can place 10% more ads, Adobe who can increase their product price without fear of losing customers, Apple, Microsoft...\n\nThe theory behind this discussion would assume that GameStop is a good hedge and to some degree AMC as well, I even heard that from the high ups in a very big, german bank, which is incredibly weird since they were against it months ago and did not even want to talk about it in the first place. This assumes that the crash is happening because of said theory I explained below in short in an edit. It does not mean that a high percentage of the entire portfolio should persist of them, but a chunk just in case might be a very good idea. The market is more complex than many think.\n\nAnother hedge and long term hold can not be mentioned in this sub, but you might guess what it is. Sadly, we cant debate this here. Has to do with weird blocks and tokens, latter of which might change the whole gaming industry and I am thankfully in the position where I can take constant profits from it in percentages that sound absolutely insane.\n\nSo, in case of this **theoretical** scenario, I would like to get everyone's opinion on this. I want to be clear, I value every single opinion and would love the most input possible. In case of no crash, my investments should grow steadily, but in case of a crash due to named circumstance, they would skyrocket. Again, this is purely theoretical, I do not want to discuss whether or not it is happening, but what you would do in case it will happen in the near future.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TLDR: How would you hedge against a potential market crash ala 2008 due to Evergrande + GameStop and the overall situation?**\n\n*Since I got downvoted to hell on a different subreddit for even mentioning GME and spreading the word, I will add the theory behind GameStop again, even though most of you might know this already.*\n\n*The theory: The most part of the stock is traded in Dark Pools and all the shorting Hedge Funds are telling us that they closed their position, which is mathematically impossible. Do the research yourself. So, what I think is happening, is that all the shorts are actually synthetic and not real shares. There is tons and tons of proof of it, too much to even deny at this point. They exercise and sell deep ITM calls in order to get the FTDs. So basically, they are passing them from one to another, to another.*\n\n*Think of it like this, a good analogy I found: You get a credit card with 10.000$ on it, max it out and have to repay next month. However, you have endless credit cards, so you can get another credit card and \"pay\" the 10.000$ with that. The debt is still there, its just getting passed. You can do that forever. Now you need more money, so you do this all over again and keep digging the grave deeper and deeper. In this theory, multiple times the float and continuing. In order to stop that, you have to lock the float entirely, which is why everyone is currently directly registering their shares. IF this is true, I do not have to explain the potential outcome. There is simply too much proof as that I can deny that at all.*\n\n*Computershare confirmed this:Quote from their Twitter: \"Shares held directly on the books of US companies through a transfer agent are not held at DTCC. As such, shares are not available to be loaned for any means within the security markets. Computershare is a registered transfer agent &amp; therefore does not lend shares in any capacity\"*\n\n*I need to admit I am a bit disappointed by the negative response from a lot of people, but I would like to keep this open and come back one year later, I will simply take all the downvotes from here. I will still read everything and appreciate any opinion on the topic.*\n\n*Cheers, have a nice week everyone!*",

The vast majority of the union rejected a contract offer earlier this week that would have delivered 5% raises to some workers and 6% raises to others.\n\n\u201cThe almost one million UAW retirees and active members who stand in solidarity with the striking UAW members at John Deere,\" UAW President Ray Curry said.\n\nBrad Morris, vice president of labor relations for Deere, said in a statement that the company is \"committed to a favorable outcome for our employees, our communities and everyone involved.\u201d He said Deere wants an agreement that would improve the economic position of all employees.\n\n\u201cWe will keep working day and night to understand our employees\u2019 priorities and resolve this strike, while also keeping our operations running for the benefit of all those we serve,\u201d Morris said.\n\nThirty-five years have passed since the last major Deere strike, but workers were emboldened to demand more this year after working long hours throughout the pandemic and because companies are facing worker shortages.\n\n\u201cOur members at John Deere strike for the ability to earn a decent living, retire with dignity and establish fair work rules,\u201d said Chuck Browning, vice president and director of the UAW\u2019s Agricultural Implement Department. \u201cWe stay committed to bargaining until our members\u2019 goals are achieved.\u201d\n\nChris Laursen, who works as a painter at Deere, told the Des Moines Register before the strike that it could make a significant difference.\n\n\u201cThe whole nation\u2019s going to be watching us,\u201d Laursen said to the newspaper. \u201cIf we take a stand here for ourselves, our families, for basic human prosperity, it\u2019s going to make a difference for the whole manufacturing industry. Let\u2019s do it. Let\u2019s not be intimidated.\u201d\n\nEarlier this year, another group of UAW-represented workers went on strike at a Volvo Trucks plant in Virginia and wound up with better pay and lower-cost health benefits after rejecting three tentative contract offers.\n\n\nThe contracts under negotiation covered 14 Deere plants across the United States, including seven in Iowa, four in Illinois and one each in Kansas, Colorado and Georgia.\n\nThe contract talks at the Moline, Illinois-based company were unfolding as Deere is expecting to report record profits between $5.7 billion and $5.9 billion this year. The company has been reporting strong sales of its agricultural and construction equipment this year.\n\nThe Deere production plants are an important contributors to the economy, so local officials hope any strike will be short-lived.\n\n\u201cWe definitely want to see our economy stabilize and grow after the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic,\u201d Moline Mayor Sangeetha Rayapati said to the Quad-Cities Times. \u201cHopefully, these parties can come to a resolution soon.\u201d",

What could have been a mortgage payment, a weekend vacation or down payment on a new car instead went poof due to the invisible tax known as inflation.\"  \n\n\nHow are we supposed to not get all doom and gloomy about this?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Full Read](https://channelchek.com/news-channel/Inflation_is_No_Baloney)",

        "selftext": "Hi, gang. Non-ape here. Never been in GME, never posted about it. Mostly hate ape culture and rhetoric and have largely abandoned WSB for greener pastures because of it. \n\nHOWEVER. Was looking at the GME chart today, wanting to see how it held up during the current downturn. That's when I noticed something interesting. Whenever GME gets beaten down, it tends to spend a couple of months fighting a descending-triangle-shaped downtrend. It eventually battles out of that trend, and initially the progress is slow. BUT...once it recaptures a major DMA support, it RUNS LIKE HELL at some point in the  next 1-5 days. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[IT'S COMING \\(?\\)](https://preview.redd.it/b5bvcut0hgt71.png?width=4187&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4fa893791f975f6b0e9e922964bc3c509f23597d)\n\nWhy am I telling you this? Well, because today it broke out above both the 20 and the 50 DMAs. Could be nothing. But, this is WSB. So, I'm going to buy some fucking 1dte options and see what happens. \n\nPositions: 50 195c 10/15",

        "selftext": "So gold is getting closer to $1,750 again, and since gold recently experienced a dip I\u2019m looking on investing on some gold stocks since I feel like they\u2019ll do well in the current high inflationary environment.\n\nI am currently holding Barrick Gold whose total preliminary gold production[ rose to 1.09 million ounces](https://www.reuters.com/business/barrick-third-quarter-gold-output-rises-nearly-5-sequentially-2021-10-14/) and Newmont, which is another big company that generates massive production of precious metals. The latter was recently among stocks that can possibly beat inflation.\n\nRight now I\u2019m looking into going for some [First Majestic](https://www.firstmajestic.com/) not just for the gold but also since they have the most expensive silver stock out there. Another one would be Equinox Gold since they are showing a lot of potential too. Their operations are not deterred by the pandemic, so they are constantly producing and is possibly headed for a breakout.\n\nFor explorations, I think [Collective Mining](https://collectivemining.com/) has a lot of room to grow. They already started drilling and have released good results in the recent months. The cash burn is so low and the company is set up for a long timeline. So far that\u2019s the only one I\u2019m going to look into since they\u2019re already showing promise in their drilling results. I also want to be safe so I\u2019m more focused on the bigger ones since they\u2019re more certain and I don\u2019t think I\u2019d lose that much on them.\n\nRight now I have only invested on the bigger producers and is still looking into the others that i have mentioned. I need your thoughts. Is it smart to invest on gold right now since there\u2019s a lot going on with the prices?",

The stock is down 12.3% over the past  month. Facebook (FB) didn't  immediately respond to a request for comment.",
