        "selftext": "  \n\n *Disclaimer: Not a financial advice; just my view and interpretations.* \n\n**Paysafe** is a fintech company founded in the UK in 1996 focused on specialized and high-risk verticals including iGaming and Cry\\*to among other payment segments. In the trailing twelve months (TTM) the Company made \\~$1.5 Bn in Revenues, adjusted EBITDA of $434 Mn and net loss of $200 Mn. \n\n**Paysafe is currently at a dirt-cheap valuation.** \n\nAbout 75% of the revenue\u2019s are from the high-risk verticals of iGaming and Emerging Markets (which include stock, FX and cry\\*to trading, direct marketing, which can include nutraceuticals and multi-level marketing, travel and entertainment, integrated payments and digital goods). These are high-growth areas and Paysafe is well among the first-movers in this space. Going in first comes with its own set of problems and benefits. Regulation is still in the nascent stage and that is what is currently troubling the business. Once the business gets going and the governments and businesses agree on how to do their business this very well looks like a money-maker.\n\n**Key Managerial Personnel**  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cjsqpydo3o281.png?width=695&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=23b4b5aa9cd3f2f4fd507717918388fad372d7a1\n\n**Lines of Business**  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/msmidt0s3o281.png?width=708&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=81db02c2a408e99d43fd8c649308ed5f396480b5\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Revenue and Cost of services**  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vabwcn8v3o281.png?width=710&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a286f0a03141cf328440a55ec998dabd6653f2a9\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Regulatory Restrictions:**\n\nIn Europe there has been a wave of new regulations coming through. The regulations that have affected the Company the most are (as mentioned in the Q3 \u201921 earnings call)\n\n1. In Germany, there is a cap on how much a single person can bet. So, when the Company caters to higer-end betters, this cap has a pretty high impact.\n\n2. Again, in Germany, the tax on many casino and poker games have made games frankly unprofitable for the Operators.\n\n3. The Operators in Germany are getting adjusted to the new regulations and getting locally licensed.\n\n4. Given the market size of Germany, it is a pretty large market for PaySafe and they took a big hit here. (The company did not provide the exact numbers/split-up of Europe\u2019s market)\n\n5. In Holland, only a very small number of operators are going to be given license and the payment types are also limited. There is a lot activity there to get this reversed.\n\n**Debt Concern:**\n\nOne another concern for Paysafe is their high debt position in their Balance Sheet. They are made to cough up about $180 Mn during the TTM in Interest Expenses. The management is cognizant of this issue and is focused on reducing this. They generated an impressive **Free Cash Flow of $350 Mn** in the trailing twelve months period and using the excess cash flow to reduce debt. The management is focusing on reducing the debt and has a stated objective of bringing it down to 3.5 times of EBITDA; it is currently at 4.5 times. \n\nThe Company\u2019s free cash flow conversion is pretty high and they are committed to pay down debt as fast as they can with the excess cash flow.\n\n**Growth Opportunities:**\n\nThe global iGaming payments market is projected to grow at a 12% CAGR (excluding North America and China) from $77 Bn (2020) to $135 Bn (2025) while the U.S. is projected to grow at a CAGR of 50%+ from 2019 to 2025 (as per EDC and H2 Gambling Capital) and a potential to reach $50 Bn in volume by 2025 in North America. The market is only now opening up and Paysafe\u2019s iGaming services are already live in 14 states and used by over 34 operators\u2014representing approximately 75% of all iGaming operators in the U.S. market. The operators served in the US include DraftKings and the state lotteries of Pennsylvania, Michigan, Virginia, New Hampshire, North Carolina and North Dakota. \n\nPaySafe has great opportunities for growth in the disruptive areas of iGaming and Cry\\*to. The new regulations and opening up of the markets in these areas are creating some new and mostly likely temporary hurdles for the growth of the Company. But being a very big player with backers like BlackStone and William Foley, Paysafe is definitely a good candidate for turning their business around and get on the high growth opportunities of their disruptive business segments in which they operate.\n\nThe bottom-line is Paysafe is betting big on iGaming and Cry\\*to and that is a bet to buy-in. \n\n**Valuation:**\n\nThe current share price puts the Company\u2019s valuation at $2.7 Bn and the Enterprise Value at $4.7 Bn. The Company\u2019s TTM revenue is \\~$1.5 Bn and Adjusted EBITDA is $434 Mn. While the valuation during their SPAC listing might have been high, they have come down by more than 60% since those time and more than 80% from its all-time high of $19.5/Share. To buy the fintech play in the iGaming and Cry\\*to (Emerging markets) space, Paysafe is at the right price to buy and play the long term game.",

        "selftext": "Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/wallstreetbets. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and are ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning November 15th, 2021.\n\n# **Inflation remains the hot topic in week ahead as Walmart and other key retailers report - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/12/inflation-remains-the-hot-topic-in-week-ahead-as-walmart-and-other-key-retailers-report.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Consumers are in the spotlight in the week ahead, with the imminent release of retail sales for October and earnings from major chain stores.\n*****\n&gt; Retail sales is the big economic report for the week, when the Census Bureau releases October data on Tuesday.\n*****\n&gt; Bleakley Advisory Group chief investment officer Peter Boockvar said he\u2019s also looking at the New York Federal Reserve\u2019s Empire state manufacturing survey Monday for updates on prices paid. The Philadelphia Fed manufacturing survey, a measure of growth in that region, is released Thursday.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThat\u2019s going to be key, outside of that it\u2019s retail sales,\u201d Boockvar said. \u201cI think the inflation story will continue to dominate the headlines and the news flow in markets and what the Fed does.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Investors will also be watching the outcome of the virtual meeting between President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping on Monday evening.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think it\u2019s good that they would be on a talking basis,\u201d Boockvar said. \u201cI don\u2019t think anything would come out of it unless there\u2019s some shocking change in the tariff situation, but I doubt anything will happen.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # Chain store earnings\n&gt; The earnings season is winding down, but the big-box stores have yet to report. Walmart and Home Depot release results Tuesday, and Target reports Wednesday.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWalmart is a pretty big barometer for the health of the consumer for sure, and it will be interesting to see how they handle margins,\u201d National Securities chief market strategist Art Hogan said. Rising costs have been pressuring companies across industries, and many have raised prices in response.\n*****\n&gt; Based on the latest sentiment data Friday, consumers are getting worried about rising prices. The University of Michigan\u2019 consumer sentiment index dropped to a 10-year low of 66.8 in the preliminary November report, from 71.7 in October.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIt\u2019s so important to look at what consumers do, versus what they say,\u201d Hogan said. He said retail sales are expected to be up 1.1%, compared to a 0.7% gain in September.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe trend that we\u2019re looking for in the next week is sequential improvement in economic data,\u201d Hogan said. \u201cThat\u2019s the important thing to focus on.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Other data in the coming week includes industrial production Tuesday. Housing starts and building permits data will be released Wednesday.\n*****\n&gt; Inflation also proved to be a problem in the stock market this past week, after both producer prices and consumer prices increased more than expected. The consumer price index jumped 6.2%, a three-decade high.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks snapped a five-week winning streak, and all major indices were lower in the past week. The S&amp;P 500 was down 0.3% for the week, at 4,682. The Nasdaq and Russell 2000 saw the biggest declines, falling 0.7% and 1% respectively.\n*****\n&gt; Treasury yields rose, as investors bet the Federal Reserve may be forced to raise interest rates sooner to combat inflation.\n*****\n&gt; The 10-year Treasury yield was at 1.57% on Friday afternoon, and the 2-year yield traded at 0.52%. Yields move opposite price.\n*****\n&gt; The best performing major S&amp;P equities sector was materials, an inflation play that gained more than 2.5%. The worst performer was the consumer discretionary sector, which includes retailers: It declined nearly 3.2%.\n*****\n&gt; Hogan said even with inflation fears, he expects stocks to continue to rise.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think we continue to grind higher. We did the larger reset that we needed, which was six weeks - in September and two weeks of October,\u201d he said. \u201cThe good news is demand hasn\u2019t been destroyed. It\u2019s been delayed.\u201d Hogan said supply chain issues should get sorted out. He noted that some components of CPI, like higher used car prices, show that the inflation should be temporary.\n*****\n&gt; Trivariate Research founder Adam Parker said he expects the market to continue its march higher. \u201cWhat would make me call for a correction in the market would be two things \u2014 hubris and debt,\u201d he said. Neither of those are currently a problem, since he does not see signs of \u201cmanagement gone awry\u201d and many companies restructured their debt.\n*****\n&gt; Managements are not engaging in arrogant behavior that would be more common at a market top, like excessive spending, he said.\n*****\n&gt; Parker said he expects mid-single digit earnings growth. \u201cI think we could be pretty constructive for the next couple of quarters,\u201d he said.\n\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/8rAJUHO.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE S&amp;P SECTORS FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/dhxVRcM.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/oHCQ5zT.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/NocMP7O.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/rHLkf6i.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/SRRbBhh.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/68bpNyW.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/lF2TUFo.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/YuhpIuh.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/45es3q2.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/nhff0sq.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/1xc0qaI.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/7FUnt2B.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Best and Worst S&amp;P 500 Stocks Since September 30th\n\n&gt; The past month has seen the S&amp;P 500 pivot and rally higher after declines throughout the month of September. Since the end of Q3, the S&amp;P has now gained 8.6%, which is slightly off the highs from earlier this month. Earnings season has been in full swing over the past few weeks meaning there have been plenty of stocks with catalysts for big moves since the end of September. Below we show the stocks that have risen and fallen the most since September 30th.\n\n&gt; Topping the list is Enphase Energy (ENPH) having rallied 67.77% in the past month and a half. The bulk of that gain came after earnings as the stock leaped 24.65% the day after reporting and plenty of follow-through in the days after. Arista Networks (ANET) is also up over 50%. Like ENPH, a large portion of ANET's move came from an over 20% gain on earnings in response to a triple play. There are 18 other stocks in the S&amp;P 500 that have risen by more than 25% since the end of September. The largest of those are NVIDIA (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA).\n\n&gt; Only 18% of the S&amp;P 500 has traded lower since September 30th, and by far the biggest decliner has been Moderna (MRNA). Although it has fallen a dramatic 41% in a short span, that eats into what have been very strong gains this year. Even after its decline so far in Q4, MRNA has still more than doubled year to date. The only other biggest decliners since September that are still up year to date are Garmin (GRMN), Allstate (ALL), Carnival (CCL), and Dish Network (DISH).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/111221-930.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Week Before Thanksgiving, DJIA up 19 of 28, but weaker lately\n\n&gt; Next week is not only November\u2019s monthly option expiration week, but it is also the last full week of trading before Thanksgiving. DJIA has a reasonably solid track record over the last 28 years, rising 19 times the week before Thanksgiving with a median gain of 0.41%. But the other major U.S. stock market benchmarks have not been as strong and there has been more weakness across the board recently. Since 2003 DJIA is up only 9 out of the last 18 years with a median loss of 0.09%.\n\n&gt; S&amp;P is up 16 of the last 28 years with a median gain of 0.24% and down 10 of the last 18, \u20130.16% median loss. NASDAQ is up 16 of the last 28 years with a median gain of 0.28% and down 9 of the last 18, +0.07% median gain. Russell 2000 is up 15 of the last 28 years with a median gain of 0.54% and down 10 of the last 18, \u20130.20% median loss. If weakness does manifest next week, it may be a good set up for the Thanksgiving trade of buying into weakness the week before Thanksgiving and selling into strength around the holiday and typical November end-of-month strength.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/680c740a2fcf7b877a85ecba425f6bda/3d24fe398b06ac0c-55/s500x750/1ee3ab95c65a7c99a01105d66f8864bc7cdac8a7.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Reasons To Be Thankful\n\n&gt; As we reach the home stretch of 2021, there is a lot to be thankful for. Stocks are having an amazing year, the economy is improving, and COVID-19 trends are going the right direction. Let\u2019s look at some reasons to be thankful.\n\n&gt; What an amazing year and incredible recent run in stocks. The S&amp;P 500 Index just made 8 consecutive all-time highs for the first time since 1997 and it was up 17 out of 19 days for the first time since 1971. Along the way, the S&amp;P 500 was up more than 25% year-to-date in the month of November, making it one of the best years ever.\n\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 has made 65 new all-time highs this year, tied for the second most in any year ever (tied with 1964), with only 77 in 1995 higher. Although it is still a longshot, there\u2019s a chance we could see 13 more new highs and break the record, something to be thankful for indeed.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Blog-11.10.21.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; \u201cAlthough the economy did slow in the third quarter, it looks like that was a one-off event due to supply chain issues and the Delta variant,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cWe fully expect growth to pick up over the coming quarters as the economy continues to rebound thanks to a very healthy and strong U.S. consumer.\u201d\n\n&gt; From the best services number ever, to job growth beating expectations, to inflation and supply chain issues showing signs of peaking, to consumers with trillions of dollars in savings, there are many reasons to expect the economy to remain strong as we head into 2022.\n\n&gt; At the end of the day, though, it is all about earnings. So, while the economy might have slowed in the third quarter, earnings once again came in much better than expected, showing how agile corporate America can be. S&amp;P 500 earnings are tracking to a 39% year-over-year increase in the third quarter, more than 12 percentage points above expectations with still more than 40 index constituents left to report. As our Earnings Season Dashboard shows below, there is a lot to be thankful for as it pertains to earnings.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Chart-11.10.21-.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Lastly, the trends in COVID-19 are going the right way, with the number of hospitalizations down more than 50% from the September peak. With booster shots on the way and kids allowed to get vaccinated, there are many tailwinds to a continuation of the reopening we\u2019ve been seeing. This is definitely something to be thankful for.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Sentiment Steadily Moving Higher\n\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 has encountered some selling pressure this week, but that hasn't stopped sentiment from continuing its grind higher. The weekly AAII sentiment survey saw 48.0% of respondents report as bullish this week up from 41.5% last week. That puts bullish sentiment at the highest level since the first week of July when it was 0.6 percentage points higher than it is now.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/111121-AAII-Bull.png))**\n\n&gt; The increase in bullish sentiment borrowed from bears as less than a quarter of respondents reported having negative sentiment for the first time since the last week of July. Similar to bullish sentiment, bearish sentiment is now at the lowest level since the first week of July when it came in at 22.2%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/111121-AAII-Bear.png))**\n\n&gt; Overall, sentiment continues to favor bulls to a wide margin. As a result of the inverse moves in sentiment, the bull-bear spread rose to 24 from 15.5 last week. Again, that is levels not seen since early July.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/111121-AAII-Spread.png))**\n\n&gt; Neutral sentiment also declined this week falling by 4.5 percentage points to 28%. Unlike bullish and bearish sentiment, that reading is basically in the middle of the past several months' range as the reading has generally hovered around the 30% level.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/111121-AAII-Neutral.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Small Business Economic Outlook Dour\n\n&gt; This morning the NFIB released the results of their October survey of small business sentiment. The report saw small business sentiment fall for the second month in a row. At 98.2, the index is now back to the same level it was at this past March.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/110921-NFIB-HL.png))**\n\n&gt; With the decline in the headline reading, breadth was terrible with only one index that is an input to the optimism index\u2014Plans to Make Capital Outlays\u2014moving higher month over month. The various indices are now all over the place with regards to their own historical ranges. For example, Higher Prices, Compensation, and Compensation Plans all hit a record high while Expectations for the Economy to Improve and Credit Conditions for Regular Borrowers are just off of record lows.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/110921-NFIB-Table.png))**\n\n&gt; Sales and earnings-related topics weighed on optimism in October. A net negative percentage of responding firms reported weaker actual and earnings changes. Meanwhile, the weakest percentage of respondents reported now as a good time to expand since February. Alongside that weaker reading, Outlook for General Business Conditions continues to collapse and is now at the second-lowest level on record; only slightly above the low from nine years ago. One potential factor playing into that weak sentiment is higher prices as that index hit another record.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/110921-NFIB-Sales.png))**\n\n&gt; While the headline Small Business Optimism index has declined, it has held up considerably well relative to the massive drop in the Outlook for General Business Conditions. As shown below, the spread between the two is now at a record high dating back to 1986.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/110921-NFIB-Spread.png))**\n\n&gt; While there were some signs of cooling in October, overall the employment metrics in the report continue to be historically strong. Hiring Plans were unchanged at 26 which is off the late summer peak but still above any pre-pandemic level. While firms do not plan to take on as many workers as they had planned a few months ago, they are at least paying them better. Both Compensation and Compensation Plans continue to surge to new record highs. That has appeared to have some effect as the number of firms reporting Job Openings as Hard to Fill fell modestly. Additionally, as we noted in today's Morning Lineup, fewer businesses are reporting labor problems as their biggest concern.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/110921-NFIB-Emp.png))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/45es3q2.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/EKBM7mR.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE MONDAY'S OPEN!](https://i.imgur.com/9je3wSW.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 11.15.21 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/pviG7w8.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 11.15.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/hADm01O.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/peAqPvP.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday  11.16.21 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/EP2afcX.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 11.16.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/AJnWJ7J.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 11.17.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Ev2lXWy.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 11.17.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Ep2sGdL.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 11.18.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/SYzRwze.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 11.18.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ruo795N.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 11.19.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/nzonZUm.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 11.19.21 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. $166.81\n&gt; **Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.

        "selftext": "**The Companies** \nMAXN - Maxeon is a spin off from SunPower that focuses only on manufacturing solar panels.\n\nSPWR - SunPower is a solar solution provider and installer, that is primarily focused on the service installation and operation of solar solutions. Prior to October 2020, SPWR made their own solar panels. After October 2020, MAXN makes the solar panels and is owned as a partnership of TZS, SPWR and Total.\n\nENPH - Enphase makes batteries, microinverters and software that is used to convert the energy generated by solar panels into usable electricity for your home.\n\n**The Relationships**\n\nSPWR used to manufacture their own panels, but then spun off MAXN so they can have two lines of business with different expenses and revenue streams. ENPH partners with MAXN and SPWR to integrate microinverters into solar panels: https://enphase.com/installers/acm/sunpower\n\nMAXN is primarily sold and installed by SPWR. So if SPWR has a bad quarter, expect MAXN to hurt. And similarly, ENPH is a canary in a coal mine. When ENPH has bad news, it will take MAXN and SPWR with them.\n\n**Historical performance**\n\nBack in April, MAXN put out an awful Q1 and lowered year long estimates. They also coupled this by putting out an offering redeemable at $18. Overall, it was a triple beatdown that saw MAXN drop from $40 to $15. Also, during that drop, there were regular price cuts by Raymond James, a bullish analyst.\n\nIn Q3, we have a real interesting mix of sentiment. SPWR had a bad quarter with earnings despite revenue being up. This hurt the stock price by 8%. MAXN had a sympathy slide of about 15% in reaction. ENPH on the other hand blew out investor expectations and jumped 25% and is holding strong.\n\nMAXN in Q2: https://corp.maxeon.com/static-files/16f85525-3954-42f9-9109-b8e4d5003af2\n\nRevenue was only up 5% both QoQ and YoY for Q2.\n\n**Projections and Valuation**\n\nMAXN has Q3 revenue projections of $220M, which is 20% higher than their Q2 revenue of $175. SPWR was targeted for $329M in revenue but only hit $323M.\n\nIf MAXN hits $220M, and closes the year at $700M in revenue, their P/S ratio would be 1.35. Both CSIQ and JKS operate at P/S ratios of 0.55. SEDG operates at a P/S of 10, but SEDG offers more products in a higher margin space.\n\nI think unless MAXN blows it out of the water, we can expect a price slide back to $18.\n\n**The company catalysts**\n\nThe biggest bet on MAXN is the end of the polysilicon contract that they current have which was obtained above market:\nhttps://stockspinoffinvesting.com/spin-offs/maxeon-solar-technologies-deep-dive/\n\nThe catalyst for MAXN is that the contract for their above market polysilicon supply is going to expire in 2022. Using their Q2 numbers (https://corp.maxeon.com/static-files/16f85525-3954-42f9-9109-b8e4d5003af2) We can see that MAXN has an additional expense of $12M in Q2 because of above market polysilicon. This means that once the contract ends, they will immediately have $12M in savings, which is about 10% of their current revenue per quarter. Unfortunately, this $12M doesn't make them profitable, but it decreases their operating loss by almost 25%. It doesn't affect their P/S ratios, but it helps their EPS and cash flows, which could give them some runway.\n\nOverall, I think MAXN is going to provide middling numbers and coupled with SPWR's lower results, the polysilicon offset won't be enough to pump MAXN beyond $25.",

The Philadelphia Fed manufacturing survey, a measure of growth in that region, is released Thursday.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThat\u2019s going to be key, outside of that it\u2019s retail sales,\u201d Boockvar said. \u201cI think the inflation story will continue to dominate the headlines and the news flow in markets and what the Fed does.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Investors will also be watching the outcome of the virtual meeting between President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping on Monday evening.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think it\u2019s good that they would be on a talking basis,\u201d Boockvar said. \u201cI don\u2019t think anything would come out of it unless there\u2019s some shocking change in the tariff situation, but I doubt anything will happen.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # Chain store earnings\n&gt; The earnings season is winding down, but the big-box stores have yet to report. Walmart and Home Depot release results Tuesday, and Target reports Wednesday.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWalmart is a pretty big barometer for the health of the consumer for sure, and it will be interesting to see how they handle margins,\u201d National Securities chief market strategist Art Hogan said. Rising costs have been pressuring companies across industries, and many have raised prices in response.\n*****\n&gt; Based on the latest sentiment data Friday, consumers are getting worried about rising prices. The University of Michigan\u2019 consumer sentiment index dropped to a 10-year low of 66.8 in the preliminary November report, from 71.7 in October.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIt\u2019s so important to look at what consumers do, versus what they say,\u201d Hogan said. He said retail sales are expected to be up 1.1%, compared to a 0.7% gain in September.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe trend that we\u2019re looking for in the next week is sequential improvement in economic data,\u201d Hogan said. \u201cThat\u2019s the important thing to focus on.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Other data in the coming week includes industrial production Tuesday. Housing starts and building permits data will be released Wednesday.\n*****\n&gt; Inflation also proved to be a problem in the stock market this past week, after both producer prices and consumer prices increased more than expected. The consumer price index jumped 6.2%, a three-decade high.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks snapped a five-week winning streak, and all major indices were lower in the past week. The S&amp;P 500 was down 0.3% for the week, at 4,682. The Nasdaq and Russell 2000 saw the biggest declines, falling 0.7% and 1% respectively.\n*****\n&gt; Treasury yields rose, as investors bet the Federal Reserve may be forced to raise interest rates sooner to combat inflation.\n*****\n&gt; The 10-year Treasury yield was at 1.57% on Friday afternoon, and the 2-year yield traded at 0.52%. Yields move opposite price.\n*****\n&gt; The best performing major S&amp;P equities sector was materials, an inflation play that gained more than 2.5%. The worst performer was the consumer discretionary sector, which includes retailers: It declined nearly 3.2%.\n*****\n&gt; Hogan said even with inflation fears, he expects stocks to continue to rise.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think we continue to grind higher. We did the larger reset that we needed, which was six weeks - in September and two weeks of October,\u201d he said. \u201cThe good news is demand hasn\u2019t been destroyed. It\u2019s been delayed.\u201d Hogan said supply chain issues should get sorted out. He noted that some components of CPI, like higher used car prices, show that the inflation should be temporary.\n*****\n&gt; Trivariate Research founder Adam Parker said he expects the market to continue its march higher. \u201cWhat would make me call for a correction in the market would be two things \u2014 hubris and debt,\u201d he said. Neither of those are currently a problem, since he does not see signs of \u201cmanagement gone awry\u201d and many companies restructured their debt.\n*****\n&gt; Managements are not engaging in arrogant behavior that would be more common at a market top, like excessive spending, he said.\n*****\n&gt; Parker said he expects mid-single digit earnings growth. \u201cI think we could be pretty constructive for the next couple of quarters,\u201d he said.\n\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/8rAJUHO.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE S&amp;P SECTORS FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/dhxVRcM.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/oHCQ5zT.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/NocMP7O.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/rHLkf6i.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/SRRbBhh.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/68bpNyW.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/lF2TUFo.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/YuhpIuh.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/KQOTTn6.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/nhff0sq.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/1xc0qaI.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/7FUnt2B.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Best and Worst S&amp;P 500 Stocks Since September 30th\n\n&gt; The past month has seen the S&amp;P 500 pivot and rally higher after declines throughout the month of September. Since the end of Q3, the S&amp;P has now gained 8.6%, which is slightly off the highs from earlier this month. Earnings season has been in full swing over the past few weeks meaning there have been plenty of stocks with catalysts for big moves since the end of September. Below we show the stocks that have risen and fallen the most since September 30th.\n\n&gt; Topping the list is Enphase Energy (ENPH) having rallied 67.77% in the past month and a half. The bulk of that gain came after earnings as the stock leaped 24.65% the day after reporting and plenty of follow-through in the days after. Arista Networks (ANET) is also up over 50%. Like ENPH, a large portion of ANET's move came from an over 20% gain on earnings in response to a triple play. There are 18 other stocks in the S&amp;P 500 that have risen by more than 25% since the end of September. The largest of those are NVIDIA (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA).\n\n&gt; Only 18% of the S&amp;P 500 has traded lower since September 30th, and by far the biggest decliner has been Moderna (MRNA). Although it has fallen a dramatic 41% in a short span, that eats into what have been very strong gains this year. Even after its decline so far in Q4, MRNA has still more than doubled year to date. The only other biggest decliners since September that are still up year to date are Garmin (GRMN), Allstate (ALL), Carnival (CCL), and Dish Network (DISH).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/111221-930.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Week Before Thanksgiving, DJIA up 19 of 28, but weaker lately\n\n&gt; Next week is not only November\u2019s monthly option expiration week, but it is also the last full week of trading before Thanksgiving. DJIA has a reasonably solid track record over the last 28 years, rising 19 times the week before Thanksgiving with a median gain of 0.41%. But the other major U.S. stock market benchmarks have not been as strong and there has been more weakness across the board recently. Since 2003 DJIA is up only 9 out of the last 18 years with a median loss of 0.09%.\n\n&gt; S&amp;P is up 16 of the last 28 years with a median gain of 0.24% and down 10 of the last 18, \u20130.16% median loss. NASDAQ is up 16 of the last 28 years with a median gain of 0.28% and down 9 of the last 18, +0.07% median gain. Russell 2000 is up 15 of the last 28 years with a median gain of 0.54% and down 10 of the last 18, \u20130.20% median loss. If weakness does manifest next week, it may be a good set up for the Thanksgiving trade of buying into weakness the week before Thanksgiving and selling into strength around the holiday and typical November end-of-month strength.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/680c740a2fcf7b877a85ecba425f6bda/3d24fe398b06ac0c-55/s500x750/1ee3ab95c65a7c99a01105d66f8864bc7cdac8a7.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Reasons To Be Thankful\n\n&gt; As we reach the home stretch of 2021, there is a lot to be thankful for. Stocks are having an amazing year, the economy is improving, and COVID-19 trends are going the right direction. Let\u2019s look at some reasons to be thankful.\n\n&gt; What an amazing year and incredible recent run in stocks. The S&amp;P 500 Index just made 8 consecutive all-time highs for the first time since 1997 and it was up 17 out of 19 days for the first time since 1971. Along the way, the S&amp;P 500 was up more than 25% year-to-date in the month of November, making it one of the best years ever.\n\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 has made 65 new all-time highs this year, tied for the second most in any year ever (tied with 1964), with only 77 in 1995 higher. Although it is still a longshot, there\u2019s a chance we could see 13 more new highs and break the record, something to be thankful for indeed.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Blog-11.10.21.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; \u201cAlthough the economy did slow in the third quarter, it looks like that was a one-off event due to supply chain issues and the Delta variant,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cWe fully expect growth to pick up over the coming quarters as the economy continues to rebound thanks to a very healthy and strong U.S. consumer.\u201d\n\n&gt; From the best services number ever, to job growth beating expectations, to inflation and supply chain issues showing signs of peaking, to consumers with trillions of dollars in savings, there are many reasons to expect the economy to remain strong as we head into 2022.\n\n&gt; At the end of the day, though, it is all about earnings. So, while the economy might have slowed in the third quarter, earnings once again came in much better than expected, showing how agile corporate America can be. S&amp;P 500 earnings are tracking to a 39% year-over-year increase in the third quarter, more than 12 percentage points above expectations with still more than 40 index constituents left to report. As our Earnings Season Dashboard shows below, there is a lot to be thankful for as it pertains to earnings.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Chart-11.10.21-.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Lastly, the trends in COVID-19 are going the right way, with the number of hospitalizations down more than 50% from the September peak. With booster shots on the way and kids allowed to get vaccinated, there are many tailwinds to a continuation of the reopening we\u2019ve been seeing. This is definitely something to be thankful for.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Sentiment Steadily Moving Higher\n\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 has encountered some selling pressure this week, but that hasn't stopped sentiment from continuing its grind higher. The weekly AAII sentiment survey saw 48.0% of respondents report as bullish this week up from 41.5% last week. That puts bullish sentiment at the highest level since the first week of July when it was 0.6 percentage points higher than it is now.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/111121-AAII-Bull.png))**\n\n&gt; The increase in bullish sentiment borrowed from bears as less than a quarter of respondents reported having negative sentiment for the first time since the last week of July. Similar to bullish sentiment, bearish sentiment is now at the lowest level since the first week of July when it came in at 22.2%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/111121-AAII-Bear.png))**\n\n&gt; Overall, sentiment continues to favor bulls to a wide margin. As a result of the inverse moves in sentiment, the bull-bear spread rose to 24 from 15.5 last week. Again, that is levels not seen since early July.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/111121-AAII-Spread.png))**\n\n&gt; Neutral sentiment also declined this week falling by 4.5 percentage points to 28%. Unlike bullish and bearish sentiment, that reading is basically in the middle of the past several months' range as the reading has generally hovered around the 30% level.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/111121-AAII-Neutral.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Small Business Economic Outlook Dour\n\n&gt; This morning the NFIB released the results of their October survey of small business sentiment. The report saw small business sentiment fall for the second month in a row. At 98.2, the index is now back to the same level it was at this past March.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/110921-NFIB-HL.png))**\n\n&gt; With the decline in the headline reading, breadth was terrible with only one index that is an input to the optimism index\u2014Plans to Make Capital Outlays\u2014moving higher month over month. The various indices are now all over the place with regards to their own historical ranges. For example, Higher Prices, Compensation, and Compensation Plans all hit a record high while Expectations for the Economy to Improve and Credit Conditions for Regular Borrowers are just off of record lows.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/110921-NFIB-Table.png))**\n\n&gt; Sales and earnings-related topics weighed on optimism in October. A net negative percentage of responding firms reported weaker actual and earnings changes. Meanwhile, the weakest percentage of respondents reported now as a good time to expand since February. Alongside that weaker reading, Outlook for General Business Conditions continues to collapse and is now at the second-lowest level on record; only slightly above the low from nine years ago. One potential factor playing into that weak sentiment is higher prices as that index hit another record.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/110921-NFIB-Sales.png))**\n\n&gt; While the headline Small Business Optimism index has declined, it has held up considerably well relative to the massive drop in the Outlook for General Business Conditions. As shown below, the spread between the two is now at a record high dating back to 1986.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/110921-NFIB-Spread.png))**\n\n&gt; While there were some signs of cooling in October, overall the employment metrics in the report continue to be historically strong. Hiring Plans were unchanged at 26 which is off the late summer peak but still above any pre-pandemic level. While firms do not plan to take on as many workers as they had planned a few months ago, they are at least paying them better. Both Compensation and Compensation Plans continue to surge to new record highs. That has appeared to have some effect as the number of firms reporting Job Openings as Hard to Fill fell modestly. Additionally, as we noted in today's Morning Lineup, fewer businesses are reporting labor problems as their biggest concern.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/110921-NFIB-Emp.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending November 12th, 2021** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmulEWE-T6Q))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 11.14.21**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED.)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * (**$TSN $OEG $OTLY $AAP $IDEX $CSPR $WMT $HD $SE $STNE $LZB $DLO $TGT $BIDU $LOW $TJX $BILI $NNOX $NVDA $CSCO $VSCO $BABA $JD $M $BJ $WOOF $AMAT $WDAY $INTU $PANW $WSM $FL**)\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/KQOTTn6.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/MrpShLB.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE MONDAY'S OPEN!](https://i.imgur.com/9je3wSW.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 11.15.21 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/pviG7w8.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 11.15.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/hADm01O.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/peAqPvP.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday  11.16.21 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/EP2afcX.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 11.16.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/AJnWJ7J.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 11.17.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Ev2lXWy.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 11.17.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Ep2sGdL.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 11.18.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/SYzRwze.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 11.18.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ruo795N.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 11.19.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/nzonZUm.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 11.19.21 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # (T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n&gt; **(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)** (T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.).\n\n&gt; #([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://charts.finviz.com/chart.ashx?t=SPY&amp;ty=c&amp;ta=st_c,sch_200p,sma_50,sma_200,sma_20,sma_100,bb_20_2,rsi_b_14,macd_b_12_26_9,stofu_b_14_3_3&amp;p=d&amp;s=l))\n\n*****\n\n# DISCUSS!\n\nWhat are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?\n\n*****\n\nI hope you all have a wonderful weekend and a great trading week ahead r/smallstreetbets. :)",

Since the end of Q3, the S&amp;P has now gained 8.6%, which is slightly off the highs from earlier this month. Earnings season has been in full swing over the past few weeks meaning there have been plenty of stocks with catalysts for big moves since the end of September. Below we show the stocks that have risen and fallen the most since September 30th.\n\n&gt; Topping the list is Enphase Energy (ENPH) having rallied 67.77% in the past month and a half. The bulk of that gain came after earnings as the stock leaped 24.65% the day after reporting and plenty of follow-through in the days after. Arista Networks (ANET) is also up over 50%. Like ENPH, a large portion of ANET's move came from an over 20% gain on earnings in response to a triple play. There are 18 other stocks in the S&amp;P 500 that have risen by more than 25% since the end of September. The largest of those are NVIDIA (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA).\n\n&gt; Only 18% of the S&amp;P 500 has traded lower since September 30th, and by far the biggest decliner has been Moderna (MRNA). Although it has fallen a dramatic 41% in a short span, that eats into what have been very strong gains this year. Even after its decline so far in Q4, MRNA has still more than doubled year to date. The only other biggest decliners since September that are still up year to date are Garmin (GRMN), Allstate (ALL), Carnival (CCL), and Dish Network (DISH).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/111221-930.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Week Before Thanksgiving, DJIA up 19 of 28, but weaker lately\n\n&gt; Next week is not only November\u2019s monthly option expiration week, but it is also the last full week of trading before Thanksgiving. DJIA has a reasonably solid track record over the last 28 years, rising 19 times the week before Thanksgiving with a median gain of 0.41%. But the other major U.S. stock market benchmarks have not been as strong and there has been more weakness across the board recently. Since 2003 DJIA is up only 9 out of the last 18 years with a median loss of 0.09%.\n\n&gt; S&amp;P is up 16 of the last 28 years with a median gain of 0.24% and down 10 of the last 18, \u20130.16% median loss. NASDAQ is up 16 of the last 28 years with a median gain of 0.28% and down 9 of the last 18, +0.07% median gain. Russell 2000 is up 15 of the last 28 years with a median gain of 0.54% and down 10 of the last 18, \u20130.20% median loss. If weakness does manifest next week, it may be a good set up for the Thanksgiving trade of buying into weakness the week before Thanksgiving and selling into strength around the holiday and typical November end-of-month strength.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/680c740a2fcf7b877a85ecba425f6bda/3d24fe398b06ac0c-55/s500x750/1ee3ab95c65a7c99a01105d66f8864bc7cdac8a7.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Reasons To Be Thankful\n\n&gt; As we reach the home stretch of 2021, there is a lot to be thankful for. Stocks are having an amazing year, the economy is improving, and COVID-19 trends are going the right direction. Let\u2019s look at some reasons to be thankful.\n\n&gt; What an amazing year and incredible recent run in stocks. The S&amp;P 500 Index just made 8 consecutive all-time highs for the first time since 1997 and it was up 17 out of 19 days for the first time since 1971. Along the way, the S&amp;P 500 was up more than 25% year-to-date in the month of November, making it one of the best years ever.\n\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 has made 65 new all-time highs this year, tied for the second most in any year ever (tied with 1964), with only 77 in 1995 higher. Although it is still a longshot, there\u2019s a chance we could see 13 more new highs and break the record, something to be thankful for indeed.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Blog-11.10.21.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; \u201cAlthough the economy did slow in the third quarter, it looks like that was a one-off event due to supply chain issues and the Delta variant,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cWe fully expect growth to pick up over the coming quarters as the economy continues to rebound thanks to a very healthy and strong U.S. consumer.\u201d\n\n&gt; From the best services number ever, to job growth beating expectations, to inflation and supply chain issues showing signs of peaking, to consumers with trillions of dollars in savings, there are many reasons to expect the economy to remain strong as we head into 2022.\n\n&gt; At the end of the day, though, it is all about earnings. So, while the economy might have slowed in the third quarter, earnings once again came in much better than expected, showing how agile corporate America can be. S&amp;P 500 earnings are tracking to a 39% year-over-year increase in the third quarter, more than 12 percentage points above expectations with still more than 40 index constituents left to report. As our Earnings Season Dashboard shows below, there is a lot to be thankful for as it pertains to earnings.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Chart-11.10.21-.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Lastly, the trends in COVID-19 are going the right way, with the number of hospitalizations down more than 50% from the September peak. With booster shots on the way and kids allowed to get vaccinated, there are many tailwinds to a continuation of the reopening we\u2019ve been seeing. This is definitely something to be thankful for.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Sentiment Steadily Moving Higher\n\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 has encountered some selling pressure this week, but that hasn't stopped sentiment from continuing its grind higher. The weekly AAII sentiment survey saw 48.0% of respondents report as bullish this week up from 41.5% last week. That puts bullish sentiment at the highest level since the first week of July when it was 0.6 percentage points higher than it is now.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/111121-AAII-Bull.png))**\n\n&gt; The increase in bullish sentiment borrowed from bears as less than a quarter of respondents reported having negative sentiment for the first time since the last week of July. Similar to bullish sentiment, bearish sentiment is now at the lowest level since the first week of July when it came in at 22.2%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/111121-AAII-Bear.png))**\n\n&gt; Overall, sentiment continues to favor bulls to a wide margin. As a result of the inverse moves in sentiment, the bull-bear spread rose to 24 from 15.5 last week. Again, that is levels not seen since early July.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/111121-AAII-Spread.png))**\n\n&gt; Neutral sentiment also declined this week falling by 4.5 percentage points to 28%. Unlike bullish and bearish sentiment, that reading is basically in the middle of the past several months' range as the reading has generally hovered around the 30% level.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/111121-AAII-Neutral.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Small Business Economic Outlook Dour\n\n&gt; This morning the NFIB released the results of their October survey of small business sentiment. The report saw small business sentiment fall for the second month in a row. At 98.2, the index is now back to the same level it was at this past March.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/110921-NFIB-HL.png))**\n\n&gt; With the decline in the headline reading, breadth was terrible with only one index that is an input to the optimism index\u2014Plans to Make Capital Outlays\u2014moving higher month over month. The various indices are now all over the place with regards to their own historical ranges. For example, Higher Prices, Compensation, and Compensation Plans all hit a record high while Expectations for the Economy to Improve and Credit Conditions for Regular Borrowers are just off of record lows.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/110921-NFIB-Table.png))**\n\n&gt; Sales and earnings-related topics weighed on optimism in October. A net negative percentage of responding firms reported weaker actual and earnings changes. Meanwhile, the weakest percentage of respondents reported now as a good time to expand since February. Alongside that weaker reading, Outlook for General Business Conditions continues to collapse and is now at the second-lowest level on record; only slightly above the low from nine years ago. One potential factor playing into that weak sentiment is higher prices as that index hit another record.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/110921-NFIB-Sales.png))**\n\n&gt; While the headline Small Business Optimism index has declined, it has held up considerably well relative to the massive drop in the Outlook for General Business Conditions. As shown below, the spread between the two is now at a record high dating back to 1986.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/110921-NFIB-Spread.png))**\n\n&gt; While there were some signs of cooling in October, overall the employment metrics in the report continue to be historically strong. Hiring Plans were unchanged at 26 which is off the late summer peak but still above any pre-pandemic level. While firms do not plan to take on as many workers as they had planned a few months ago, they are at least paying them better. Both Compensation and Compensation Plans continue to surge to new record highs. That has appeared to have some effect as the number of firms reporting Job Openings as Hard to Fill fell modestly. Additionally, as we noted in today's Morning Lineup, fewer businesses are reporting labor problems as their biggest concern.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/110921-NFIB-Emp.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending November 12th, 2021** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmulEWE-T6Q))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 11.14.21**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED.)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * (**$TSN $OEG $OTLY $AAP $IDEX $CSPR $WMT $HD $SE $STNE $LZB $DLO $TGT $BIDU $LOW $TJX $BILI $NNOX $NVDA $CSCO $VSCO $BABA $JD $M $BJ $WOOF $AMAT $WDAY $INTU $PANW $WSM $FL**)\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/KQOTTn6.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/MrpShLB.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE MONDAY'S OPEN!](https://i.imgur.com/9je3wSW.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 11.15.21 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/pviG7w8.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 11.15.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/hADm01O.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/peAqPvP.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday  11.16.21 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/EP2afcX.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 11.16.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/AJnWJ7J.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 11.17.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Ev2lXWy.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 11.17.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Ep2sGdL.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 11.18.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/SYzRwze.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 11.18.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ruo795N.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 11.19.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/nzonZUm.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 11.19.21 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # (T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n&gt; **(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)** (T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.).\n\n&gt; #([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://charts.finviz.com/chart.ashx?t=SPY&amp;ty=c&amp;ta=st_c,sch_200p,sma_50,sma_200,sma_20,sma_100,bb_20_2,rsi_b_14,macd_b_12_26_9,stofu_b_14_3_3&amp;p=d&amp;s=l))\n\n*****\n\n# DISCUSS!\n\nWhat are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?\n\n*****\n\nI hope you all have a wonderful weekend and a great trading week ahead r/StockMarket. :)",

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and are ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning November 15th, 2021.\n\n# **Inflation remains the hot topic in week ahead as Walmart and other key retailers report - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/12/inflation-remains-the-hot-topic-in-week-ahead-as-walmart-and-other-key-retailers-report.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Consumers are in the spotlight in the week ahead, with the imminent release of retail sales for October and earnings from major chain stores.\n*****\n&gt; Retail sales is the big economic report for the week, when the Census Bureau releases October data on Tuesday.\n*****\n&gt; Bleakley Advisory Group chief investment officer Peter Boockvar said he\u2019s also looking at the New York Federal Reserve\u2019s Empire state manufacturing survey Monday for updates on prices paid. The Philadelphia Fed manufacturing survey, a measure of growth in that region, is released Thursday.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThat\u2019s going to be key, outside of that it\u2019s retail sales,\u201d Boockvar said. \u201cI think the inflation story will continue to dominate the headlines and the news flow in markets and what the Fed does.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Investors will also be watching the outcome of the virtual meeting between President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping on Monday evening.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think it\u2019s good that they would be on a talking basis,\u201d Boockvar said. \u201cI don\u2019t think anything would come out of it unless there\u2019s some shocking change in the tariff situation, but I doubt anything will happen.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # Chain store earnings\n&gt; The earnings season is winding down, but the big-box stores have yet to report. Walmart and Home Depot release results Tuesday, and Target reports Wednesday.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWalmart is a pretty big barometer for the health of the consumer for sure, and it will be interesting to see how they handle margins,\u201d National Securities chief market strategist Art Hogan said. Rising costs have been pressuring companies across industries, and many have raised prices in response.\n*****\n&gt; Based on the latest sentiment data Friday, consumers are getting worried about rising prices. The University of Michigan\u2019 consumer sentiment index dropped to a 10-year low of 66.8 in the preliminary November report, from 71.7 in October.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIt\u2019s so important to look at what consumers do, versus what they say,\u201d Hogan said. He said retail sales are expected to be up 1.1%, compared to a 0.7% gain in September.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe trend that we\u2019re looking for in the next week is sequential improvement in economic data,\u201d Hogan said. \u201cThat\u2019s the important thing to focus on.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Other data in the coming week includes industrial production Tuesday. Housing starts and building permits data will be released Wednesday.\n*****\n&gt; Inflation also proved to be a problem in the stock market this past week, after both producer prices and consumer prices increased more than expected. The consumer price index jumped 6.2%, a three-decade high.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks snapped a five-week winning streak, and all major indices were lower in the past week. The S&amp;P 500 was down 0.3% for the week, at 4,682. The Nasdaq and Russell 2000 saw the biggest declines, falling 0.7% and 1% respectively.\n*****\n&gt; Treasury yields rose, as investors bet the Federal Reserve may be forced to raise interest rates sooner to combat inflation.\n*****\n&gt; The 10-year Treasury yield was at 1.57% on Friday afternoon, and the 2-year yield traded at 0.52%. Yields move opposite price.\n*****\n&gt; The best performing major S&amp;P equities sector was materials, an inflation play that gained more than 2.5%. The worst performer was the consumer discretionary sector, which includes retailers: It declined nearly 3.2%.\n*****\n&gt; Hogan said even with inflation fears, he expects stocks to continue to rise.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think we continue to grind higher. We did the larger reset that we needed, which was six weeks - in September and two weeks of October,\u201d he said. \u201cThe good news is demand hasn\u2019t been destroyed. It\u2019s been delayed.\u201d Hogan said supply chain issues should get sorted out. He noted that some components of CPI, like higher used car prices, show that the inflation should be temporary.\n*****\n&gt; Trivariate Research founder Adam Parker said he expects the market to continue its march higher. \u201cWhat would make me call for a correction in the market would be two things \u2014 hubris and debt,\u201d he said. Neither of those are currently a problem, since he does not see signs of \u201cmanagement gone awry\u201d and many companies restructured their debt.\n*****\n&gt; Managements are not engaging in arrogant behavior that would be more common at a market top, like excessive spending, he said.\n*****\n&gt; Parker said he expects mid-single digit earnings growth. \u201cI think we could be pretty constructive for the next couple of quarters,\u201d he said.\n\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/8rAJUHO.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE S&amp;P SECTORS FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/dhxVRcM.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/oHCQ5zT.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/NocMP7O.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/rHLkf6i.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/SRRbBhh.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/68bpNyW.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/lF2TUFo.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/YuhpIuh.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/45es3q2.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/nhff0sq.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/1xc0qaI.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/7FUnt2B.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Best and Worst S&amp;P 500 Stocks Since September 30th\n\n&gt; The past month has seen the S&amp;P 500 pivot and rally higher after declines throughout the month of September.

Below we show the stocks that have risen and fallen the most since September 30th.\n\n&gt; Topping the list is Enphase Energy (ENPH) having rallied 67.77% in the past month and a half. The bulk of that gain came after earnings as the stock leaped 24.65% the day after reporting and plenty of follow-through in the days after. Arista Networks (ANET) is also up over 50%.

Although it has fallen a dramatic 41% in a short span, that eats into what have been very strong gains this year. Even after its decline so far in Q4, MRNA has still more than doubled year to date. The only other biggest decliners since September that are still up year to date are Garmin (GRMN), Allstate (ALL), Carnival (CCL), and Dish Network (DISH).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/111221-930.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Week Before Thanksgiving, DJIA up 19 of 28, but weaker lately\n\n&gt; Next week is not only November\u2019s monthly option expiration week, but it is also the last full week of trading before Thanksgiving. DJIA has a reasonably solid track record over the last 28 years, rising 19 times the week before Thanksgiving with a median gain of 0.41%. But the other major U.S. stock market benchmarks have not been as strong and there has been more weakness across the board recently. Since 2003 DJIA is up only 9 out of the last 18 years with a median loss of 0.09%.\n\n&gt; S&amp;P is up 16 of the last 28 years with a median gain of 0.24% and down 10 of the last 18, \u20130.16% median loss. NASDAQ is up 16 of the last 28 years with a median gain of 0.28% and down 9 of the last 18, +0.07% median gain. Russell 2000 is up 15 of the last 28 years with a median gain of 0.54% and down 10 of the last 18, \u20130.20% median loss. If weakness does manifest next week, it may be a good set up for the Thanksgiving trade of buying into weakness the week before Thanksgiving and selling into strength around the holiday and typical November end-of-month strength.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/680c740a2fcf7b877a85ecba425f6bda/3d24fe398b06ac0c-55/s500x750/1ee3ab95c65a7c99a01105d66f8864bc7cdac8a7.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Reasons To Be Thankful\n\n&gt; As we reach the home stretch of 2021, there is a lot to be thankful for. Stocks are having an amazing year, the economy is improving, and COVID-19 trends are going the right direction. Let\u2019s look at some reasons to be thankful.\n\n&gt; What an amazing year and incredible recent run in stocks. The S&amp;P 500 Index just made 8 consecutive all-time highs for the first time since 1997 and it was up 17 out of 19 days for the first time since 1971. Along the way, the S&amp;P 500 was up more than 25% year-to-date in the month of November, making it one of the best years ever.\n\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 has made 65 new all-time highs this year, tied for the second most in any year ever (tied with 1964), with only 77 in 1995 higher. Although it is still a longshot, there\u2019s a chance we could see 13 more new highs and break the record, something to be thankful for indeed.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Blog-11.10.21.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; \u201cAlthough the economy did slow in the third quarter, it looks like that was a one-off event due to supply chain issues and the Delta variant,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cWe fully expect growth to pick up over the coming quarters as the economy continues to rebound thanks to a very healthy and strong U.S. consumer.\u201d\n\n&gt; From the best services number ever, to job growth beating expectations, to inflation and supply chain issues showing signs of peaking, to consumers with trillions of dollars in savings, there are many reasons to expect the economy to remain strong as we head into 2022.\n\n&gt; At the end of the day, though, it is all about earnings. So, while the economy might have slowed in the third quarter, earnings once again came in much better than expected, showing how agile corporate America can be. S&amp;P 500 earnings are tracking to a 39% year-over-year increase in the third quarter, more than 12 percentage points above expectations with still more than 40 index constituents left to report. As our Earnings Season Dashboard shows below, there is a lot to be thankful for as it pertains to earnings.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Chart-11.10.21-.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Lastly, the trends in COVID-19 are going the right way, with the number of hospitalizations down more than 50% from the September peak. With booster shots on the way and kids allowed to get vaccinated, there are many tailwinds to a continuation of the reopening we\u2019ve been seeing. This is definitely something to be thankful for.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Sentiment Steadily Moving Higher\n\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 has encountered some selling pressure this week, but that hasn't stopped sentiment from continuing its grind higher. The weekly AAII sentiment survey saw 48.0% of respondents report as bullish this week up from 41.5% last week. That puts bullish sentiment at the highest level since the first week of July when it was 0.6 percentage points higher than it is now.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/111121-AAII-Bull.png))**\n\n&gt; The increase in bullish sentiment borrowed from bears as less than a quarter of respondents reported having negative sentiment for the first time since the last week of July. Similar to bullish sentiment, bearish sentiment is now at the lowest level since the first week of July when it came in at 22.2%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/111121-AAII-Bear.png))**\n\n&gt; Overall, sentiment continues to favor bulls to a wide margin. As a result of the inverse moves in sentiment, the bull-bear spread rose to 24 from 15.5 last week. Again, that is levels not seen since early July.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/111121-AAII-Spread.png))**\n\n&gt; Neutral sentiment also declined this week falling by 4.5 percentage points to 28%. Unlike bullish and bearish sentiment, that reading is basically in the middle of the past several months' range as the reading has generally hovered around the 30% level.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/111121-AAII-Neutral.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Small Business Economic Outlook Dour\n\n&gt; This morning the NFIB released the results of their October survey of small business sentiment. The report saw small business sentiment fall for the second month in a row. At 98.2, the index is now back to the same level it was at this past March.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/110921-NFIB-HL.png))**\n\n&gt; With the decline in the headline reading, breadth was terrible with only one index that is an input to the optimism index\u2014Plans to Make Capital Outlays\u2014moving higher month over month. The various indices are now all over the place with regards to their own historical ranges. For example, Higher Prices, Compensation, and Compensation Plans all hit a record high while Expectations for the Economy to Improve and Credit Conditions for Regular Borrowers are just off of record lows.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/110921-NFIB-Table.png))**\n\n&gt; Sales and earnings-related topics weighed on optimism in October. A net negative percentage of responding firms reported weaker actual and earnings changes. Meanwhile, the weakest percentage of respondents reported now as a good time to expand since February. Alongside that weaker reading, Outlook for General Business Conditions continues to collapse and is now at the second-lowest level on record; only slightly above the low from nine years ago. One potential factor playing into that weak sentiment is higher prices as that index hit another record.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/110921-NFIB-Sales.png))**\n\n&gt; While the headline Small Business Optimism index has declined, it has held up considerably well relative to the massive drop in the Outlook for General Business Conditions. As shown below, the spread between the two is now at a record high dating back to 1986.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/110921-NFIB-Spread.png))**\n\n&gt; While there were some signs of cooling in October, overall the employment metrics in the report continue to be historically strong. Hiring Plans were unchanged at 26 which is off the late summer peak but still above any pre-pandemic level. While firms do not plan to take on as many workers as they had planned a few months ago, they are at least paying them better. Both Compensation and Compensation Plans continue to surge to new record highs. That has appeared to have some effect as the number of firms reporting Job Openings as Hard to Fill fell modestly. Additionally, as we noted in today's Morning Lineup, fewer businesses are reporting labor problems as their biggest concern.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/110921-NFIB-Emp.png))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/45es3q2.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/EKBM7mR.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE MONDAY'S OPEN!](https://i.imgur.com/9je3wSW.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 11.15.21 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/pviG7w8.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 11.15.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/hADm01O.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/peAqPvP.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday  11.16.21 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/EP2afcX.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 11.16.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/AJnWJ7J.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 11.17.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Ev2lXWy.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 11.17.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Ep2sGdL.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 11.18.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/SYzRwze.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 11.18.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ruo795N.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 11.19.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/nzonZUm.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 11.19.21 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. $166.81\n&gt; **Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.

Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp; news on this Tuesday, November 2nd, 2021-\n\n*****\n\n# [Stock futures are little changed as major averages hover near records; Tesla shares slide](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/01/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)\n\n*****\n&gt; Stock futures were basically flat in early morning trading on Tuesday after the S&amp;P 500 eked out a fresh record close on Monday to kick off November.\n*****\n&gt; Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average were up by 38 points. S&amp;P 500 futures were flat and Nasdaq 100 futures was lower by 0.15%\n*****\n&gt; All three major U.S. stock indexes hit new intraday highs and closed at records during Monday\u2019s regular session as investors continue to bet on a year-end rally despite supply chain issues, Covid risk and a Federal Reserve that\u2019s about to indicate it\u2019s going to pull back on some stimulus. The Fed\u2019s two-day meeting begins Tuesday.\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 has averaged gains of 1.1% in November and 2.3% in December since 1936, notes Bank of America. The final month of the year is in the green 79% of the time, the firm notes.

Shares of the electric automaker tumbled 5% premarket, though they are up 55% over just the past month.

It also raised its 2021 revenue and EPS outlook.\n*****\n&gt; Shares of materials giant DuPont de Nemours fell nearly 4% after the company said it is buying engineering materials technology maker Rogers Corp for $5.2 billion. DuPont also reported a 33% increase in adjusted third-quarter earnings.\n*****\n&gt; Under Armour shares soared nearly 10% after the athletic retailer hiked its annual outlook.\n*****\n&gt; On Monday, the Dow rose 94.3 points. The S&amp;P 500 rose nearly 0.2%. The Nasdaq Composite added 0.6%. The small-cap Russell 2000 gained 2.7%, its best daily performance since August.\n*****\n&gt; The Fed at the conclusion of its two-day meeting on Wednesday is expected to announce it will begin unwinding its $120 billion in monthly bond purchases implemented during the pandemic.\n*****\n&gt; The October jobs report is on Friday.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe November FOMC meeting, October payrolls ... and a host of earnings updates sets up a catalyst heavy week of trading ahead,\u201d Goldman Sachs\u2019 Chris Hussey said in a note.\n*****\n&gt; Better-than-expected corporate earnings results boosted the U.S. stock averages to finish October at record highs, with the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq posting their best months since November 2020.\n*****\n&gt; As of Monday evening according to FactSet, 55.8% of S&amp;P 500 companies have reported quarterly financial results, with 82% beating earnings estimates.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/mbQdPjs.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/vaORLAk.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/9Rrbjyg.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/uaTjkhx.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/bKWDopV.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n($SQ $PFE $ROKU $MRNA $PINS $ON $DKNG $UBER $APPS $QCOM $CRSR $PENN $SKLZ $PCG $CVS $TRVG $CRNT $ABNB $ATVI $MRO $MELI $DVN $FANG $BP $PTON $CGC $VIAC $AMG $FSLY $UAA $EPD $ET $NET $AKTS $ZG $GNRC $ALX $CNA $TMUS $SKC $RIG)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/HovAdxl.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n($PFE $CRSR $BP $UAA $COP $GNRC $EPD $RACE $EL $MPC $LPX $ARCB $GPN $CTLT $RL $BLMN $MPLX $IDXX $NRZ $CMI $BHC $ZBRA $IT $MGY $ESPR $DD $KKR $APO $ETN $AME $MIME $ADCT $ROK $TECH $INCY $LIND $BCC $SAGE $LGIH $IEP $LEA)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/53VLxUW.jpg)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/LP69zIw.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/IWaFYUR.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/IA1HwBL.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/n7GayLd.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/h4f5OtE.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/ysSbo0i.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/ycH9aVx.png)**)\n\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/zKN9CD3.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/Mm0cU5s.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/M0Y7bN5.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/poUGTRm.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/gE6O83n.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S MOST ACTIVE TRENDING TICKERS ON STOCKTWITS:\n\n* TSLA\n* LRC.X\n* PFE\n* FSR\n* FCEL\n* CRSR\n* CHGG\n* DOT.X\n* VUZI\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/02/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-in-the-premarket-pfizer-under-armour-generac-and-more.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; **Pfizer (PFE)** \u2013 Pfizer jumped 4% in the premarket after the drugmaker reported better-than-expected profit and revenue for the third quarter.
