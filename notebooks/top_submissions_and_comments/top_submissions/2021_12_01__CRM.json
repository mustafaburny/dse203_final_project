        "selftext": "#Good morning traders and investors of the r/smallstreetbets sub! Welcome to the first trading day of December! Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp; news on this Wednesday, December 1st, 2021-\n\n*****\n\n# [Stock futures jump ahead of first trading day of December after omicron fears dent markets](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/30/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)\n\n*****\n&gt; U.S. stock futures were higher in early trading Wednesday, as companies that benefit from the economic reopening gained along with big energy and pharma.\n*****\n&gt; Dow futures rose 305 points. S&amp;P 500 futures gained 1.2% and Nasdaq 100 futures rose 1.4%.\n*****\n&gt; The gains follow a Tuesday sell-off on Wall Street over fears about the new omicron Covid variant and the Federal Reserve mulling a quicker-than-planned exit from its easy monetary policy.\n*****\n&gt; Treasury yields also moved notably higher, with the benchmark 10-year Treasury note most recently back near 1.5% after falling 8 basis points Tuesday to 1.45% on fears that the pandemic would stifle economic growth.\n*****\n&gt; Merck led gainers on the S&amp;P 500, rising 4% in premarket trading a day after its Covid treatment pill received approval from the Food and Drug Administration, though by a narrow 13-10 margin.\n*****\n&gt; Energy shares also posted sharp gains, with Occidental Petroleum up 3.4% as West Texas Intermediate prices climbed more than 4% to nearly $69 a barrel.\n*****\n&gt; Elsewhere in early trading, stocks associated with the economic reopening also posted strong gains. Carnival was up 2.9%, Wynn Resorts gained 2.6% and Hilton Worldwide saw a 2.8% gain.\n*****\n&gt; The moves came a day after the Dow lost more than 650 points, the S&amp;P 500 shed 1.9% and the tech-focused Nasdaq Composite dipped 1.6%. The small-cap benchmark Russell 2000 tumbled 1.9% as cyclical names dragged on the markets.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cOur sense is that the recent selloff is a longer-term buying opportunity. However, investors that want to avoid a potential big drawdown (while giving up some potential upside) may want to wait until the [Fed\u2019s] Dec. 15 meeting,\u201d Wolfe Research strategist Chris Senyek said in a note to clients.\n*****\n&gt; Fed Chairman Jerome Powell jolted markets after he said the central bank is expected to discuss speeding up the taper of its minimum $120 billion a month bond-buying program. Despite the potential disruption of omicron, the Fed chief said he thinks reducing the pace of monthly bond buys can move quicker than the $15 billion-a-month schedule announced earlier this month.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cAt this point, the economy is very strong and inflationary pressures are higher, and it is therefore appropriate in my view to consider wrapping up the taper of our asset purchases ... perhaps a few months sooner,\u201d Powell said. \u201cI expect that we will discuss that at our upcoming meeting.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Goldman Sachs said it projects the Fed will double the pace to $30 billion a month and enact its first rate hike of the pandemic era in June.\n*****\n&gt; The major averages have seen several volatile sessions, starting last Friday when the Dow Jones Industrial Average experienced its worst day since October 2020. Stocks rebounded on Monday, only to turn downward again on Tuesday.\n*****\n&gt; Wednesday marks the first trading day of the final month of 2021.\n*****\n&gt; Expediting the removal of the Fed\u2019s easy policies tells investors that the central bank is focusing on addressing inflation, instead of new threats from the pandemic.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cMarkets appear to be having trouble digesting the combo of elevated uncertainty around the impact of the Omicron variant and a hawkish Fed pivot in the context of persistently elevated inflation,\u201d said Gregory Daco, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics.\n*****\n&gt; The new Covid variant, first detected in South Africa, has now been identified in more than a dozen countries, causing many to restrict travel. Denting sentiment on Tuesday, the Moderna CEO told the Financial Times that he expects existing vaccines to be less effective against the new variant.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks wrapped up a volatile month of trading on Tuesday. The Dow lost 3.7% for its second month of losses in three. The S&amp;P 500 fell 0.8%, while the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.25% in November. The Russell 2000 shed 4.3% in November, its worst month since March 2020.\n*****\n&gt; Still, the major averages are up solidly for the year. The Dow is up 12.7% and the S&amp;P 500 is up 21.6% in 2021. The Nasdaq Composite is up an impressive 20.6% this year.\n*****\n&gt; ADP\u2019s private payroll data for November showed 534,000 jobs added in November, above expectations of 506,000\n*****\n&gt; On Wednesday, investors will be evaluating updates on the omicron variant, as well as some key economic reports. November\u2019s Manufacturing PMI, ISM Manufacturing print and October\u2019s construction spending are set to release on Wednesday morning.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/8Kedb0c.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/CZnVYrP.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/XAbNcjb.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/Jml9Z5I.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/5KwRD2M.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n($LI $CRM $CRWD $DOCU $SNOW $AI $DG $MRVL $ZS $ASAN $OKTA $ULTA $AMBA $NTAP $SIG $EXPR $HPE $BBW $BQ $BNS $JKS $FRO $MOMO $HIBB $SPLK $SWBI $QH $RY $CHS $BZUN $FIVE $BOX $VERU $YJ $KR $CTRN $TD $VEEV $BIG $GMS $DOOO $CM $EMKR $PVH)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/5ocvp67.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n($CRM $ZS $AMBA $NTAP $HPE $BBW $BOX $RY $EMKR $DOOO $GIII $REX $DCI $PDCO $GFS $AIP $VBNK $SDIG)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/lCtopUt.jpg)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/o7ET4fR.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/odyatZm.png)**)\n\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/rIUTfTU.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/X0CaSOZ.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/paTa9DS.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/6LhmSMe.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/NQh0VqW.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/lNszsgs.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/TQK2vhS.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/kZvQYzi.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #5!](https://i.imgur.com/m6LPOsg.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S MOST ACTIVE TRENDING TICKERS ON STOCKTWITS:\n\n* BYSI\n* REQ.X\n* VXRT\n* NIO\n* AAPL\n* MATIC.X\n* ATNF\n* AERC\n* OP\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/01/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-premarket-salesforce-allbirds-doordash-and-more.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; **Salesforce** \u2014 Shares of the software giant dropped more than 6% in premarket trading despite a better-than-expected third-quarter earnings report.

S&amp;P 500 futures were flat and Nasdaq 100 futures dipped 0.4%.\n*****\n&gt; The Biden administration reacted to the news that an omicron case had been reported in California by asking businesses to proceed with vaccination requirements, even though the administration\u2019s mandate was halted in courts pending review. The White House also tightened travel rules, requiring inbound passengers to be tested within 24 hours prior to departure.\n*****\n&gt; Airline, casino and energy stocks led the gainers in premarket trading.\n*****\n&gt; Dow component Boeing\u2019s shares jumped 3.6%, cruise line Royal Caribbean was up 3.6% while MGM Resorts International moved 2.7% higher, with Covid-sensitive companies benefitting amid early evidence showing the new strain may be less severe than earlier versions.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe remain cautious on S&amp;P 500 amid a hawkish Fed tightening into an overvalued market,\u201d said Savita Subramanian, Bank of America Securities head of U.S. equity &amp; quantitative strategy.\n*****\n&gt; Still, Bank of America noted that December has historically been the strongest month for the S&amp;P 500, with the average gaining 2.3% on average since 1936 and positive 79% of the time. However, December has not always been immune to sell-offs, Subramanian added.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cAnother risk is an inflation-led consumption hit, especially as fiscal/monetary stimulus run out. Fed Chair Powell\u2019s comments on accelerated tapering and retiring the word \u2018transitory\u2019 indicate that the Fed\u2019s focus is now inflation rather than employment.\n*****\n&gt; During regular trading on Wednesday, stocks posted strong gains earlier in the session, but fell on news that the first omicron case had been reported in California. The Dow fell about 460 points, after the 30-stock benchmark had advanced 521 points. The S&amp;P dipped 1.18%, giving back an earlier gain of about 1.9%. The Nasdaq Composite slid 1.83%, after earlier trading 1.8% higher.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cInvestors are increasingly cautious about the Omicron variant as well as the likelihood of faster tapering,\u201d TD Securities said in a note to clients.\n*****\n&gt; Wednesday\u2019s whipsaw continues a highly volatile streak for stocks as the market digests what the new variant means.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe\u2019ve seen this movie before and Wall Street will likely remain COVID-variant headline driven until a clear assessment over this wave can be made,\u201d said Ed Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda. \u201cThe next couple of weeks will likely see risk appetite take a cue from incremental Omicron updates, supply chain issues, and every inflation reading,\u201d he added.\n*****\n&gt; On the data front, weekly initial jobless claims numbers will be released Thursday at 8:30 a.m. ET. Economists are expecting a print of 240,000, according to estimates from Dow Jones. The prior reading showed 199,000 first-time filers, which was the lowest since November 1969.

Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp; news on this Wednesday, December 1st, 2021-\n\n*****\n\n# [Stock futures jump ahead of first trading day of December after omicron fears dent markets](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/30/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)\n\n*****\n&gt; U.S. stock futures were higher in early trading Wednesday, as companies that benefit from the economic reopening gained along with big energy and pharma.\n*****\n&gt; Dow futures rose 305 points. S&amp;P 500 futures gained 1.2% and Nasdaq 100 futures rose 1.4%.\n*****\n&gt; The gains follow a Tuesday sell-off on Wall Street over fears about the new omicron Covid variant and the Federal Reserve mulling a quicker-than-planned exit from its easy monetary policy.\n*****\n&gt; Treasury yields also moved notably higher, with the benchmark 10-year Treasury note most recently back near 1.5% after falling 8 basis points Tuesday to 1.45% on fears that the pandemic would stifle economic growth.\n*****\n&gt; Merck led gainers on the S&amp;P 500, rising 4% in premarket trading a day after its Covid treatment pill received approval from the Food and Drug Administration, though by a narrow 13-10 margin.\n*****\n&gt; Energy shares also posted sharp gains, with Occidental Petroleum up 3.4% as West Texas Intermediate prices climbed more than 4% to nearly $69 a barrel.\n*****\n&gt; Elsewhere in early trading, stocks associated with the economic reopening also posted strong gains. Carnival was up 2.9%, Wynn Resorts gained 2.6% and Hilton Worldwide saw a 2.8% gain.\n*****\n&gt; The moves came a day after the Dow lost more than 650 points, the S&amp;P 500 shed 1.9% and the tech-focused Nasdaq Composite dipped 1.6%. The small-cap benchmark Russell 2000 tumbled 1.9% as cyclical names dragged on the markets.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cOur sense is that the recent selloff is a longer-term buying opportunity. However, investors that want to avoid a potential big drawdown (while giving up some potential upside) may want to wait until the [Fed\u2019s] Dec. 15 meeting,\u201d Wolfe Research strategist Chris Senyek said in a note to clients.\n*****\n&gt; Fed Chairman Jerome Powell jolted markets after he said the central bank is expected to discuss speeding up the taper of its minimum $120 billion a month bond-buying program. Despite the potential disruption of omicron, the Fed chief said he thinks reducing the pace of monthly bond buys can move quicker than the $15 billion-a-month schedule announced earlier this month.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cAt this point, the economy is very strong and inflationary pressures are higher, and it is therefore appropriate in my view to consider wrapping up the taper of our asset purchases ... perhaps a few months sooner,\u201d Powell said. \u201cI expect that we will discuss that at our upcoming meeting.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Goldman Sachs said it projects the Fed will double the pace to $30 billion a month and enact its first rate hike of the pandemic era in June.\n*****\n&gt; The major averages have seen several volatile sessions, starting last Friday when the Dow Jones Industrial Average experienced its worst day since October 2020. Stocks rebounded on Monday, only to turn downward again on Tuesday.\n*****\n&gt; Wednesday marks the first trading day of the final month of 2021.\n*****\n&gt; Expediting the removal of the Fed\u2019s easy policies tells investors that the central bank is focusing on addressing inflation, instead of new threats from the pandemic.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cMarkets appear to be having trouble digesting the combo of elevated uncertainty around the impact of the Omicron variant and a hawkish Fed pivot in the context of persistently elevated inflation,\u201d said Gregory Daco, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics.\n*****\n&gt; The new Covid variant, first detected in South Africa, has now been identified in more than a dozen countries, causing many to restrict travel. Denting sentiment on Tuesday, the Moderna CEO told the Financial Times that he expects existing vaccines to be less effective against the new variant.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks wrapped up a volatile month of trading on Tuesday. The Dow lost 3.7% for its second month of losses in three. The S&amp;P 500 fell 0.8%, while the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.25% in November. The Russell 2000 shed 4.3% in November, its worst month since March 2020.\n*****\n&gt; Still, the major averages are up solidly for the year. The Dow is up 12.7% and the S&amp;P 500 is up 21.6% in 2021. The Nasdaq Composite is up an impressive 20.6% this year.\n*****\n&gt; ADP\u2019s private payroll data for November showed 534,000 jobs added in November, above expectations of 506,000\n*****\n&gt; On Wednesday, investors will be evaluating updates on the omicron variant, as well as some key economic reports. November\u2019s Manufacturing PMI, ISM Manufacturing print and October\u2019s construction spending are set to release on Wednesday morning.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/8Kedb0c.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/CZnVYrP.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/XAbNcjb.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/Jml9Z5I.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/5KwRD2M.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/5ocvp67.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/lCtopUt.jpg)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/o7ET4fR.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/odyatZm.png)**)\n\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/rIUTfTU.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/X0CaSOZ.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/paTa9DS.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/6LhmSMe.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/NQh0VqW.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/lNszsgs.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/TQK2vhS.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/kZvQYzi.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #5!](https://i.imgur.com/m6LPOsg.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/01/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-premarket-salesforce-allbirds-doordash-and-more.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; **Salesforce** \u2014 Shares of the software giant dropped more than 6% in premarket trading despite a better-than-expected third-quarter earnings report.

Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp; news on this Thursday, December 2nd, 2021-\n\n*****\n\n# [Dow futures rise 100 points as travel stocks get boost following omicron sell-off](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/01/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)\n\n*****\n&gt; Dow futures rose in early trading Thursday despite the arrival of the latest Covid variant on U.S. shores and as the White House tightened travel restrictions.\n*****\n&gt; Futures contracts tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 120 points. S&amp;P 500 futures were flat and Nasdaq 100 futures dipped 0.4%.\n*****\n&gt; The Biden administration reacted to the news that an omicron case had been reported in California by asking businesses to proceed with vaccination requirements, even though the administration\u2019s mandate was halted in courts pending review. The White House also tightened travel rules, requiring inbound passengers to be tested within 24 hours prior to departure.\n*****\n&gt; Airline, casino and energy stocks led the gainers in premarket trading.\n*****\n&gt; Dow component Boeing\u2019s shares jumped 3.6%, cruise line Royal Caribbean was up 3.6% while MGM Resorts International moved 2.7% higher, with Covid-sensitive companies benefitting amid early evidence showing the new strain may be less severe than earlier versions.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe remain cautious on S&amp;P 500 amid a hawkish Fed tightening into an overvalued market,\u201d said Savita Subramanian, Bank of America Securities head of U.S. equity &amp; quantitative strategy.\n*****\n&gt; Still, Bank of America noted that December has historically been the strongest month for the S&amp;P 500, with the average gaining 2.3% on average since 1936 and positive 79% of the time. However, December has not always been immune to sell-offs, Subramanian added.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cAnother risk is an inflation-led consumption hit, especially as fiscal/monetary stimulus run out. Fed Chair Powell\u2019s comments on accelerated tapering and retiring the word \u2018transitory\u2019 indicate that the Fed\u2019s focus is now inflation rather than employment.\n*****\n&gt; During regular trading on Wednesday, stocks posted strong gains earlier in the session, but fell on news that the first omicron case had been reported in California. The Dow fell about 460 points, after the 30-stock benchmark had advanced 521 points. The S&amp;P dipped 1.18%, giving back an earlier gain of about 1.9%. The Nasdaq Composite slid 1.83%, after earlier trading 1.8% higher.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cInvestors are increasingly cautious about the Omicron variant as well as the likelihood of faster tapering,\u201d TD Securities said in a note to clients.\n*****\n&gt; Wednesday\u2019s whipsaw continues a highly volatile streak for stocks as the market digests what the new variant means.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe\u2019ve seen this movie before and Wall Street will likely remain COVID-variant headline driven until a clear assessment over this wave can be made,\u201d said Ed Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda. \u201cThe next couple of weeks will likely see risk appetite take a cue from incremental Omicron updates, supply chain issues, and every inflation reading,\u201d he added.\n*****\n&gt; On the data front, weekly initial jobless claims numbers will be released Thursday at 8:30 a.m. ET. Economists are expecting a print of 240,000, according to estimates from Dow Jones. The prior reading showed 199,000 first-time filers, which was the lowest since November 1969. The November jobs report will be released on Friday.\n*****\n&gt; Thursday\u2019s reading follows a better-than-expected ADP report on Wednesday. Private payrolls increased by 534,000 in November, ahead of the expected 506,000.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/lcmXJqv.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/s3ioTNr.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/p6nFjhw.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/Jml9Z5I.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/5KwRD2M.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n($LI $CRM $CRWD $DOCU $SNOW $AI $DG $MRVL $ZS $ASAN $OKTA $ULTA $AMBA $NTAP $SIG $EXPR $HPE $BBW $BQ $BNS $JKS $FRO $MOMO $HIBB $SPLK $SWBI $QH $RY $CHS $BZUN $FIVE $BOX $VERU $YJ $KR $CTRN $TD $VEEV $BIG $GMS $DOOO $CM $EMKR $PVH)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/5ocvp67.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n($DG $KR $EXPR $SIG $TD $VERU $GMS $DLTH $CM $LE $SCWX $EH $MEI)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/C4kn8oK.jpg)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/XAPdoyp.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/P3xLOTx.png)**)\n\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/G1tGjkp.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/8154yxP.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/830rtCF.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/5SsP6hb.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/Vwv5b34.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/21JATCM.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S MOST ACTIVE TRENDING TICKERS ON STOCKTWITS:\n\n* AAPL\n* DWAC\n* BA\n* ABUS\n* AMC\n* ADA.X\n* CFVI\n* CMMB\n* AGC\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/02/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-premarket-snowflake-boeing-apple-and-more.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; **Snowflake** \u2014 The cloud data company\u2019s shares jumped more than 13% after the company reported quarterly results that beat revenue estimates.

        "selftext": "#Good morning traders and investors of the r/StockMarket sub! Welcome to the first trading day of December! Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp; news on this Wednesday, December 1st, 2021-\n\n*****\n\n# [Stock futures jump ahead of first trading day of December after omicron fears dent markets](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/30/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)\n\n*****\n&gt; U.S. stock futures were higher in early trading Wednesday, as companies that benefit from the economic reopening gained along with big energy and pharma.\n*****\n&gt; Dow futures rose 305 points. S&amp;P 500 futures gained 1.2% and Nasdaq 100 futures rose 1.4%.\n*****\n&gt; The gains follow a Tuesday sell-off on Wall Street over fears about the new omicron Covid variant and the Federal Reserve mulling a quicker-than-planned exit from its easy monetary policy.\n*****\n&gt; Treasury yields also moved notably higher, with the benchmark 10-year Treasury note most recently back near 1.5% after falling 8 basis points Tuesday to 1.45% on fears that the pandemic would stifle economic growth.\n*****\n&gt; Merck led gainers on the S&amp;P 500, rising 4% in premarket trading a day after its Covid treatment pill received approval from the Food and Drug Administration, though by a narrow 13-10 margin.\n*****\n&gt; Energy shares also posted sharp gains, with Occidental Petroleum up 3.4% as West Texas Intermediate prices climbed more than 4% to nearly $69 a barrel.\n*****\n&gt; Elsewhere in early trading, stocks associated with the economic reopening also posted strong gains. Carnival was up 2.9%, Wynn Resorts gained 2.6% and Hilton Worldwide saw a 2.8% gain.\n*****\n&gt; The moves came a day after the Dow lost more than 650 points, the S&amp;P 500 shed 1.9% and the tech-focused Nasdaq Composite dipped 1.6%. The small-cap benchmark Russell 2000 tumbled 1.9% as cyclical names dragged on the markets.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cOur sense is that the recent selloff is a longer-term buying opportunity. However, investors that want to avoid a potential big drawdown (while giving up some potential upside) may want to wait until the [Fed\u2019s] Dec. 15 meeting,\u201d Wolfe Research strategist Chris Senyek said in a note to clients.\n*****\n&gt; Fed Chairman Jerome Powell jolted markets after he said the central bank is expected to discuss speeding up the taper of its minimum $120 billion a month bond-buying program. Despite the potential disruption of omicron, the Fed chief said he thinks reducing the pace of monthly bond buys can move quicker than the $15 billion-a-month schedule announced earlier this month.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cAt this point, the economy is very strong and inflationary pressures are higher, and it is therefore appropriate in my view to consider wrapping up the taper of our asset purchases ... perhaps a few months sooner,\u201d Powell said. \u201cI expect that we will discuss that at our upcoming meeting.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Goldman Sachs said it projects the Fed will double the pace to $30 billion a month and enact its first rate hike of the pandemic era in June.\n*****\n&gt; The major averages have seen several volatile sessions, starting last Friday when the Dow Jones Industrial Average experienced its worst day since October 2020. Stocks rebounded on Monday, only to turn downward again on Tuesday.\n*****\n&gt; Wednesday marks the first trading day of the final month of 2021.\n*****\n&gt; Expediting the removal of the Fed\u2019s easy policies tells investors that the central bank is focusing on addressing inflation, instead of new threats from the pandemic.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cMarkets appear to be having trouble digesting the combo of elevated uncertainty around the impact of the Omicron variant and a hawkish Fed pivot in the context of persistently elevated inflation,\u201d said Gregory Daco, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics.\n*****\n&gt; The new Covid variant, first detected in South Africa, has now been identified in more than a dozen countries, causing many to restrict travel. Denting sentiment on Tuesday, the Moderna CEO told the Financial Times that he expects existing vaccines to be less effective against the new variant.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks wrapped up a volatile month of trading on Tuesday. The Dow lost 3.7% for its second month of losses in three. The S&amp;P 500 fell 0.8%, while the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.25% in November. The Russell 2000 shed 4.3% in November, its worst month since March 2020.\n*****\n&gt; Still, the major averages are up solidly for the year. The Dow is up 12.7% and the S&amp;P 500 is up 21.6% in 2021. The Nasdaq Composite is up an impressive 20.6% this year.\n*****\n&gt; ADP\u2019s private payroll data for November showed 534,000 jobs added in November, above expectations of 506,000\n*****\n&gt; On Wednesday, investors will be evaluating updates on the omicron variant, as well as some key economic reports. November\u2019s Manufacturing PMI, ISM Manufacturing print and October\u2019s construction spending are set to release on Wednesday morning.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/8Kedb0c.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/CZnVYrP.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/XAbNcjb.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/Jml9Z5I.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/5KwRD2M.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n($LI $CRM $CRWD $DOCU $SNOW $AI $DG $MRVL $ZS $ASAN $OKTA $ULTA $AMBA $NTAP $SIG $EXPR $HPE $BBW $BQ $BNS $JKS $FRO $MOMO $HIBB $SPLK $SWBI $QH $RY $CHS $BZUN $FIVE $BOX $VERU $YJ $KR $CTRN $TD $VEEV $BIG $GMS $DOOO $CM $EMKR $PVH)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/5ocvp67.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n($CRM $ZS $AMBA $NTAP $HPE $BBW $BOX $RY $EMKR $DOOO $GIII $REX $DCI $PDCO $GFS $AIP $VBNK $SDIG)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/lCtopUt.jpg)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/o7ET4fR.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/odyatZm.png)**)\n\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/rIUTfTU.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/X0CaSOZ.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/paTa9DS.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/6LhmSMe.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/NQh0VqW.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/lNszsgs.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/TQK2vhS.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/kZvQYzi.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #5!](https://i.imgur.com/m6LPOsg.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S MOST ACTIVE TRENDING TICKERS ON STOCKTWITS:\n\n* BYSI\n* REQ.X\n* VXRT\n* NIO\n* AAPL\n* MATIC.X\n* ATNF\n* AERC\n* OP\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/01/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-premarket-salesforce-allbirds-doordash-and-more.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; **Salesforce** \u2014 Shares of the software giant dropped more than 6% in premarket trading despite a better-than-expected third-quarter earnings report.

By the way, they can recoup a years subscription on one sponsored tweet.\n\n also charge corporations and politicians a fee , this is not a pivot podcast idea\n\nanyway, with Jack out and Silverlake in control, i am guessing something will happen either good or bad, but it seems like a special situation to me, and someone smarter than me, will probably figure it out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\na side note, i think MSFT looked at it, to combine with linked in, and Salesforce look at them.  \n\nGOOG, Facebook, and Amazon are out, as they are probably going to run into anti trust or something with the DOJ",

        "selftext": "#Good morning traders and investors of the r/stocks sub! Welcome to the first trading day of December! Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp; news on this Wednesday, December 1st, 2021-\n\n*****\n\n# [Stock futures jump ahead of first trading day of December after omicron fears dent markets](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/30/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)\n\n*****\n&gt; U.S. stock futures were higher in early trading Wednesday, as companies that benefit from the economic reopening gained along with big energy and pharma.\n*****\n&gt; Dow futures rose 305 points. S&amp;P 500 futures gained 1.2% and Nasdaq 100 futures rose 1.4%.\n*****\n&gt; The gains follow a Tuesday sell-off on Wall Street over fears about the new omicron Covid variant and the Federal Reserve mulling a quicker-than-planned exit from its easy monetary policy.\n*****\n&gt; Treasury yields also moved notably higher, with the benchmark 10-year Treasury note most recently back near 1.5% after falling 8 basis points Tuesday to 1.45% on fears that the pandemic would stifle economic growth.\n*****\n&gt; Merck led gainers on the S&amp;P 500, rising 4% in premarket trading a day after its Covid treatment pill received approval from the Food and Drug Administration, though by a narrow 13-10 margin.\n*****\n&gt; Energy shares also posted sharp gains, with Occidental Petroleum up 3.4% as West Texas Intermediate prices climbed more than 4% to nearly $69 a barrel.\n*****\n&gt; Elsewhere in early trading, stocks associated with the economic reopening also posted strong gains. Carnival was up 2.9%, Wynn Resorts gained 2.6% and Hilton Worldwide saw a 2.8% gain.\n*****\n&gt; The moves came a day after the Dow lost more than 650 points, the S&amp;P 500 shed 1.9% and the tech-focused Nasdaq Composite dipped 1.6%. The small-cap benchmark Russell 2000 tumbled 1.9% as cyclical names dragged on the markets.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cOur sense is that the recent selloff is a longer-term buying opportunity. However, investors that want to avoid a potential big drawdown (while giving up some potential upside) may want to wait until the [Fed\u2019s] Dec. 15 meeting,\u201d Wolfe Research strategist Chris Senyek said in a note to clients.\n*****\n&gt; Fed Chairman Jerome Powell jolted markets after he said the central bank is expected to discuss speeding up the taper of its minimum $120 billion a month bond-buying program. Despite the potential disruption of omicron, the Fed chief said he thinks reducing the pace of monthly bond buys can move quicker than the $15 billion-a-month schedule announced earlier this month.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cAt this point, the economy is very strong and inflationary pressures are higher, and it is therefore appropriate in my view to consider wrapping up the taper of our asset purchases ... perhaps a few months sooner,\u201d Powell said. \u201cI expect that we will discuss that at our upcoming meeting.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Goldman Sachs said it projects the Fed will double the pace to $30 billion a month and enact its first rate hike of the pandemic era in June.\n*****\n&gt; The major averages have seen several volatile sessions, starting last Friday when the Dow Jones Industrial Average experienced its worst day since October 2020. Stocks rebounded on Monday, only to turn downward again on Tuesday.\n*****\n&gt; Wednesday marks the first trading day of the final month of 2021.\n*****\n&gt; Expediting the removal of the Fed\u2019s easy policies tells investors that the central bank is focusing on addressing inflation, instead of new threats from the pandemic.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cMarkets appear to be having trouble digesting the combo of elevated uncertainty around the impact of the Omicron variant and a hawkish Fed pivot in the context of persistently elevated inflation,\u201d said Gregory Daco, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics.\n*****\n&gt; The new Covid variant, first detected in South Africa, has now been identified in more than a dozen countries, causing many to restrict travel. Denting sentiment on Tuesday, the Moderna CEO told the Financial Times that he expects existing vaccines to be less effective against the new variant.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks wrapped up a volatile month of trading on Tuesday. The Dow lost 3.7% for its second month of losses in three. The S&amp;P 500 fell 0.8%, while the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.25% in November. The Russell 2000 shed 4.3% in November, its worst month since March 2020.\n*****\n&gt; Still, the major averages are up solidly for the year. The Dow is up 12.7% and the S&amp;P 500 is up 21.6% in 2021. The Nasdaq Composite is up an impressive 20.6% this year.\n*****\n&gt; ADP\u2019s private payroll data for November showed 534,000 jobs added in November, above expectations of 506,000\n*****\n&gt; On Wednesday, investors will be evaluating updates on the omicron variant, as well as some key economic reports. November\u2019s Manufacturing PMI, ISM Manufacturing print and October\u2019s construction spending are set to release on Wednesday morning.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/8Kedb0c.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/CZnVYrP.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/XAbNcjb.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/Jml9Z5I.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/5KwRD2M.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/5ocvp67.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/lCtopUt.jpg)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/o7ET4fR.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/odyatZm.png)**)\n\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/rIUTfTU.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/X0CaSOZ.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/paTa9DS.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/6LhmSMe.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/NQh0VqW.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/lNszsgs.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/TQK2vhS.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/kZvQYzi.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #5!](https://i.imgur.com/m6LPOsg.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/01/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-premarket-salesforce-allbirds-doordash-and-more.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; **Salesforce** \u2014 Shares of the software giant dropped more than 6% in premarket trading despite a better-than-expected third-quarter earnings report.
