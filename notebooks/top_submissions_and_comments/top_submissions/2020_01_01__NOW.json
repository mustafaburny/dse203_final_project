        "selftext": "**Disclamer**: This isn\u2019t a fear mongering post about the virus itself. To put it into perspective the Swine Flu epidemic of 2009 has over 110k confirmed cases and close to 4000 deaths in the US alone yet many people don\u2019t even remember that. But that\u2019s for a different discussion in a different sub.\n\nI\u2019m currently in Shanghai now, from my observation people in the West are not spending enough time talking about how devastating this virus has been to the Chinese economy and its certain global ramifications.\n\nLet\u2019s take the city of Shanghai for example. It\u2019s not one of the more heavily impacted cities, it\u2019s not quarantined and people can mostly come and go freely. Many businesses are still open, from restaurants to malls.\n\nHowever for the first time ever I saw an Apple store with more employees than customers, and an open Starbucks with absolutely zero customers inside. The streets on a Saturday afternoon were about as empty as it would be at midnight on a regular weekday. All of this is happening during what\u2019s supposed to be the  busiest week for consumer spendings in China.\n\nThe worst part is this doesn\u2019t seem like it will change any time soon. Shanghai just announced that they will extend the CNY holidays by another week and people will like remain fearful for the coming weeks, if not months if we don\u2019t see a dramatic turnaround of the virus situation.\n\nWhat this means is that any Western company that relies significantly on China for revenue would see their first quarter earning absolutely *crushed*, especially considering their forecasts were done with the assumption of this quarter being the best quarter of the year. For example I\u2019m foreseeing Apple miss their Greater China\u2019s revenue by as much as 50% this quarter, and it would be even worse for companies like GM, Ford and the airlines.\n\nFurther more this will impact the global manufacturing and supply chain significantly. I don\u2019t know enough to model out a detailed scenario but my gut feeling tells me a prolonged manufacturing shutdown across major Chinese cities would be more than a little disruptive in that regard.\n\nI\u2019m discounting the impact of the virus if it were spread to other countries in any significant numbers, but even considering the situation in China alone it\u2019s extremely worrying.",

        "selftext": "The year is 2017, my parents had a successful real estate business with over a dozen rental properties and several fix and flip projects in production. Our assets totaled a million and a half after paying off all loans if we ever liquidated everything. Which we did, and that\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg.\n\nMy oldest brother made the brilliant decision that because he lost his job, he should start day trading. He quickly made $30k on Apple by yoloing his saving in shares before an Apple products release event. Excited by this, he made an entire PowerPoint presentation convincing the family to get into day trading. We were reluctant at first, and I wish it stayed that way.\n\nIn the background he worked with my parents in setting up a family company and opening trading accounts and buying courses. Keep in mind my parents will do anything he says, completely wrapped around his finger. During this time I was getting into the house flipping business in full swing. Working on my parents properties and going to auctions for future projects. I had already set up in my mind that I was going to be a real estate investor because it was the only work I actually enjoyed doing, my parents were very profitable, and even after the 2008 housing market crash, when we lost everything, they were able to bounce back.\nThen one day everything stopped, my parents stopped working real estate and with no capital of my own I couldn\u2019t continue doing it myself. \n\nThey liquidated most of their assets and set up trading accounts with TD. They tried setting up weekly quotas and profit targets, which looking back, were really unrealistic. We needed 20k per month and sometimes more to cover loans from the very last rentals that hadn\u2019t sold just yet. So naturally while they were on the market the quota for the month was 20k...for inexperienced day traders. It dawned on me that money is easy to make every month when a tenant gives it to you rather than we ourselves have to endure risk to make it, but my parents didn\u2019t listen to me, it had to be my brothers way.\n\nYou can probably guess what happened. Loss after loss made our account grow smaller and smaller; and the smaller it got the more we had to risk to make bigger profits. Which only happened once where I made nearly 50k trading Netflix on its highest volume day in 2018. That quickly gotten absorbed by bills. But. By 2018 we were already down some 200k and our bills had been quickly eating up our saving. All the way to the point we starting taking loans just cover expenses and continue trading. Then one day I lost 80k on netflix when it\u2019s earnings made it drop nearly a hundred dollars. If it went up well I\u2019d be into real estate again. I nearly had a heart attack and stayed in bed for I don\u2019t even know how long. If it weren\u2019t for my girlfriend I think I might have killed myself.\n\nWe were forced to live in our last property for a few months before selling it to avoid foreclosure and then my entire family moved into a 1 bedroom apartment my brother still had in Pasadena. Which is an urban city so the rent was 3k. Which was nearly impossible to pay. We did Uber Eats deliveries every single day to just try to make enough money to eat and did some trading with money we borrowed from our extended family. All of our credit scores were shot and there was nothing left to borrow on. Then we sold our very last property and made 100k on the sale. Which we lost.\n\nNearly all of our losses were on options, and they were a direct result of our trading strategy, which was laughable. They set guidelines for the option expiration, loss tolerance, and investment amount(no swing trading). Which hey sounds great why not. Except that when our expenses were so great, the low risk meant we were burning more than we were making, the stress made me make some good and bad trades in an attempt to save my family from ruin. On some trades I would have made literal hundreds of thousands if my parents and older brother didn\u2019t force sell my positions because they couldn\u2019t stomach swing a loss(16k in HD $215 strike bought at $201 and it reached $215 a day before expiration which would have been a $170k profit because instead was forced to be a $2k loss). It really kills your heart to see how much money you could have made, not because you took profits too early, because no one believed you and took a loss on your behalf.\n\nWith no more options we packed up and moved to Maryland were my older brother got a 100k plus job coding websites. Things were good for a while and with no rush to cover rent or bills I was actually able to grow a small account from 4K to 17k. All good things must come to end sadly. He developed MS because of the stress of losing hundreds of thousands in a few years and his relationship was failing as well. These things affected his ability to learn new programing languages or work efficiently so his job fired him. Then it was up to me to make enough to cover the expenses and slowly I saw the account cannibalized to 0. They blame me almost exclusively for losing all the money by the way.\n\nWe moved back to California being forced to stay within the same apartment complex company because no where else will accept us. Now my brother is suicidal, he\u2019s also diabetic and he\u2019s tried killing himself by overdosing on insulin. His hope is at 0. I\u2019ve matured more than any young adult should have from this ordeal so I feel like I can keep going. But moral is low. My parents work nearly 14 hours a day driving for Uber eats. I can\u2019t really help because I had my ankle fused back in July. My other brother doesn\u2019t live with us anymore because of all the chaos that happened. My parents have real estate licenses and they are trying really hard to find clients. I wish there was more I can do. I learned I should have fought more for our family to continue real estate investing. Nothing made us happier than flipping houses. If I had the opportunity to flip a house I\u2019m sure we could jumpstart that career with my parents\u2019 experience. I\u2019m not against trading even after losing everything, sadly it took that much for me to do it half decently. I\u2019m sticking to vertical spreads on etfs and precious metals, which brings in some profits every few weeks but not enough to make living. Sometimes I\u2019ll use around $50 on near expiration out of the money calls of puts to try to get lucky. Sometimes the temptation to let my whole account ride on naked options is strong. Not because I want to be rich, but because I just want my parents to stop working so hard in something they don\u2019t even enjoy doing at their age. I wanted to share my story because I saw how some of you guys shared similar experiences, and some of you were the exceptions that won in the end. Invest in real estate, it\u2019s profitable if you work with someone who has experience and the market hasn\u2019t tanked. I\u2019m going to Texas in a few days to propose to my girlfriend and bring her back to California. If she says yes it\u2019ll be the highlight of my life.\n\nTLDR; Stocks bad, Real Estate good",

        "selftext": "I've been watching this site for forever and started trading in October with $5,000 and turned it into $40,000 trading earnings and Dis in Nov. It was awesome and I felt badass. \n\nAround Dec 1st I told my gf I would stop trading since I was having sleepless nights, stress headaches, and was somewhat obsessed with this shit. I had to get back in.... and that bad karma made me lose on almost every trade and added $30,000 of real money (to get above $25k) which I lost as well and am down currently $32,000 of real money in additions to all the gains from November. \n\nHere are some highlights: \n\nLulu earnings Dec 11th: I felt it would do well on earnings and lost $22,050 on a $25,000 yolo 10 minutes after purchasing. (My first big guh moment and I f'ing KNEW not to do this) \n\nNVDA Dec 23rd: Bought $25,000 of 1/10 calls that dipped 30 minutes after buying... got weak hands... and lost $13,384. (I bought at the ATH at the time and felt it would just keep going up) \n\nAMD Dec 26th: Bought $15,000 of AMD $50 calls at $47.10 (1/3 and 1/10)... dipped immediately after buying... got weak hands a couple days ago on Dec 30th... and sold around $45.80 for a $11,800 loss. Now I see that fucker is up around $49 today and figured it might since $50 seems doable next week. Fuck me and my shitty decisions... I knew I should have held until today with CES next week but Trump bombing Iraq got me twitchy and I just wanted out. (My $3k would be worth $18k if I would have stayed in one more day) \n\nThe highlight of November was selling my $28k of DIS fd's... 2 hours prior to the stock rocketing up once subscriber numbers were released. I took a $9,000 loss instead of a $150k+ gain. I still got in afterwards and it went up $40k.... which I held until it was a $12k gain and sold. (Selling 368 contracts 2 hours before subscriber numbers came out still makes my heart want to explode) \n\nWell that's my story. Not sure why I am posting but it kinda feels therapeutic in a way to let this shit out. I haven't told anyone since 1. Most my friends wouldn't understand 2. My gf would probably be pissed I lied to her. I have $3,200 left in my restricted from purchasing Robinhood account that I am transferring over to WeBull and the funds should be there in 2 days. I am thinking with earnings this month I can turn this $3,200 around with some smart purchases instead of yolo'ing stupidly. But maybe fucking not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n [https://imgur.com/gallery/4kVnfVS](https://imgur.com/gallery/4kVnfVS)",

        "selftext": "Hey everyone, I appreciate the welfare checks after TSLA went up today. I had previously only posted about TSLA plays a few times, so it's flattering that you guys associate and know me for TSLA plays. I wasn't going to post this since I'm really embarrassed and ashamed that I let things get out of control. I feel like I let myself and everyone down.\n\nYes, I got screwed very hard. As I have been the past several weeks or so as it has been continuing up. I previously made over $65k at the peak of selling options (both puts and calls) on TSLA in 2019 in just eight or nine months, but that may or may not be gone now with TSLA's surge to the upside.\n\nI fucked up pretty badly and did not manage the trades like I should have. As with a lot of people here, I'm shocked and in disbelief that it hit $498.49. It'll probably break over $500 this week to reach another milestone.\n\nA couple months ago I did talk shit about how TSLA would not get above $400 or even $420 anytime soon. Boy was I dead wrong. You guys are more than welcome to talk shit to me now if you like. I'm happy that a lot of you were able to make massive gains. It did have to come at the expense of people on the other side of the trade.\n\nYou might be wondering if I still have short calls on TSLA. The answer is yes, and I'm not quite sure why. Stubbornness, inability to take a loss at the high even though it keeps making new highs, etc. Basically the opposite of bagholding a long position. Nobody wants to sell for a loss at the bottom similar to not wanting to sell for a loss at the top.\n\nEven the \"no way it will reach this point\" call strikes that I have sold ended up becoming deep in the money. If you'd like to capitalize on this information, some of the \"no way it will reach this point\" strikes that I have are in the $500s.\n\nThe really annoying part is having to pay taxes on gains that may or may not have all been lost and more in the first five trading days of 2020. Even though I did say to myself that I wouldn't sell naked calls as a new year's resolution, I ended up doing so anyways and I paid the consequences.\n\nIf others are in a similar boat after selling calls, I hope you're doing okay and that you didn't put yourself in a really bad situation. Taking a loss is tough. By the time we do, it gets way out of control and ends up being an even bigger one.\n\nDon't worry about me, I'll be fine and will continue trading. My trading confidence took a huge hit and the entire experience has been humbling. This was not how I was hoping 2020 would start. I guess you could let this post/update be a cautionary tale to manage risk better and not take on positions with potentially unlimited risk. More pain will probably come as I still have short calls that I have yet to close.\n\nI do still plan on messing with TSLA once the dust settles from the current positions. Best of luck to everyone out there. Might not post/comment as often since I want to focus on trading and getting on the right track first. Will still answer PMs and mod when I can though. Thank you again for everyone's concerns.",

And single handedly ended the Bull market...  Im sorry.  Im very sorry guys.\n\nEdit3: On the bright side, Cramer said its a bad time to buy so inverse Cramer and I might get lucky lol.  But really.  Cramer, the ultimate hype man extraordinaire turns bearish the day I buy Calls.  Literally insane I actually single handedly ended the bull market and started a war.  \n\nWent from up 25% two days ago to down 60% today. Im optimistic. Afterall, money is just paper anyway.  \n\n Final Edit 4: ok.  So.  Rode some dailies all the way up till just now.  Ended up selling on this spike down because I made like 20-30% and it dropped so I decided to take profits instead of holding while this dumpster fire unfolds.  Currently sitting at about down 40% overall, compared to my 2 days ago up 25-30% so not great, but better than my -60% earlier today.  Not gonna lie.  Its been a wild ride, prolly gonna do it again next week, I havent learned shit.  Im either going broke or gonna be rich.  Prolly broke.  But hey, its just paper anyway.  To the idiot that said \"this is on you for buying at ATH\" Its been at ATH for like 10 years bud.  \n\nFinal edit #2:  its my post, I can make as many edits as I want.  Fuck you.   Im dumbfounded I missed that massive drop right there.  Somehow sold my dailies for a gain and bought puts after to spiked down then back up, I bought puts at that top there.  So gonna ride these puts over the weekend as this dumpster fire political environment unfolds.  I assume theres just gonna be a massive cuckfest about to unfold over the weekend thatll give this atleast 1 more red day.  Who knows. Earnings season will turn it all green again im sure and I can cause the recession then too.",

        "selftext": "So I just recently started trading options, and like most noob retards I just bought calls and puts because everything else was too confusing and hard.  Credit spreads, iron condors, butterflies?  What the fuck does that mean?  Stock going up= Calls, stock going down= Puts.  I thought that was so simple and easy.  Turns out it was simple and easy except my win percentage was like 20%, and I was losing a bunch of money.  I started to get pissed off, but then I realized that if buying calls and puts only won like 20% of the time, then selling them must win 80% of the time.  So I switched strategies and looked into selling calls/puts.  I learned ( I know learning might be too difficult a concept for some of you retards) that selling calls/puts had a much higher probability of success, but also had basically unlimited loss potential if you're wrong.  Now since I'm a huge pussy and don't like unlimited losses, I learned about credit spreads, which not only have a massively high probability of winning, but also cap your losses at a certain amount.  These things literally CAN'T go tits up.  I'm now trading credit spreads and holy shit these things are literally free money.  Like just pick a number you know the stock isn't going to go past and sell that call/put. Then just buy a call/put and little further out of the money, just in case shit goes bad, and you get to keep all that juicy premium you collected when you sold.  FREE FUCKING MONEY.  Check it out.  AMD is a fucking bull train running harder than the train your friend's ran on your sister last night.  No way that shit drops below $47 again.  Sell the $47 put, buy the $45 because I'm a huge pussy and don't like unlimited losses, and the difference premium is all yours when the options expire, mine are 1/10s.  Free fucking money.  This shit is so easy.  I will trade nothing but credit spreads for the rest of my life.",

They had no capital in their business. The story was that they had no profits (I question that now) but they had no capital in their business for a long time. Invested capital was negative for a long time until 2012 when they got into the cloud systems they're known for (and AWS is the massive cash flow machine it is). Chanos pointed this out in a fireside chat he had with Dan Gilbert (which ultimately created my interest in looking into the statements now). \"The money followed the investment\". \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nII. They only had two years where they were shrinking more than they were growing (I see this as Capex&lt;D&amp;A) and those two years were 2007 and 2009. They shrank by a very small amount. No business grows continually forever so this comes as no surprise. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIII. For the years chosen here they were free cash flow positive, net revenue positive, and EBITDA positive. They had negative net income in 2014. An amazing run. Consistent gross margins also with very little fluctuation. They had negative book value in 2004. Their return on net tangible equity also was fantastic with one negative year in 2004.",

There are only a handful of major IaaS providers: Microsoft, Google, IBM. Microsoft has greater IaaS market share than every other remaining hyperspace cloud player combined.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n|Player|2018 IaaS Market Share / Year Prior +/-|\n|:-|:-|\n|Amazon Web Services $AMZN|47.8% (-1.6)|\n|Microsoft Azure $MSFT|15.5% (+2.8)|\n|Alibaba Cloud $BABA|7.7% (+2.4)|\n|Google Cloud Platform $GOOG|4% (+0.7)|\n|IBM Cloud $IBM|1.8% (-0.1)|\n\nSource:  [https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2019-07-29-gartner-says-worldwide-iaas-public-cloud-services-market-grew-31point3-percent-in-2018](https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2019-07-29-gartner-says-worldwide-iaas-public-cloud-services-market-grew-31point3-percent-in-2018) \n\nFor the time being, $BABA and $MSFT have culturally different clientele, providing a favorable moat to $MSFT in the US and with allies (UK, EU, AU, NZ) and the Western hemisphere neighborhood (LATAM). Of course, that's before we get to PaaS, which $MSFT serves as a leader in some of the most cutting edge (AI/ML, IoT), and as the uncontested king of on premise and hybrid cloud in enterprises.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **THE MILITARY-INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX HATH SPOKEN:** Unless you're living under a rock, you've probably heard about JEDI and DEOS. The monopoly that $AMZN once enjoyed in the cleared space  is now in the crosshairs of big blue. This opens the door for Microsoft to gain all types of opportunities in the highly profitable federal space, and some of which it is uniquely positioned for with it's Azure Stack Hub and array of edge devices. Microsoft, with it's already deeply established sales and relationships with the DoD, will have no problems capitalizing on this opportunity. It's only just beginning. Microsoft can leverage a huge partner base, and don't forget that US defense companies can increase that leverage too.\n* **O365, DYNAMICS, LINKEDIN, AND GITHUB ARE EASY MONEY:** $MSFT is enjoying the fruits of its acquisition(al) labors on one hand, and the easiest inflows of cash via O365, which will see increased growth as more cleared / defense onboard into O365 and dog-whistle Teams.\n* **ENJOYS THE TAILWINDS OF A RECORD YEAR**: $MSFT and Azure are coming along from record highs, with yearly gains between the 50-60% respectively. If you're bullish on the S&amp;P 500/DOW, you can be bullish on Microsoft - and expect it to outperform.

Run the City?\n\nAlright, so let's start with the first one.\n\nElections for local officials are in November, so we must get registered there before then. Detroit has around  479,267  registered voters. Meaning it only takes just above half that to infiltrate the city offices. If we abuse the gerrymandered counties we could do it with even less. Now let's look at offices, we can ignore all senate and house positions which leaves us with the Mayor, Attorney General, and Secretary of State. Once we hold these positions we expand programs helping us and boosting investment from outside who in turn ensure our re-election.\n\nNext, we have to buy cheap real estate.\n\n   As another user pointed out we can buy real estate at  [https://buildingdetroit.org/](https://buildingdetroit.org/) . But as others pointed out people could move in an cause many liabilities. To circumvent this we must become the ruling gang. If all of us arm then we can become the main gang running the city from the government from the offices and streets. Via transferring all your assets to a hospitality company whose sole customer is you we can qualify for property tax exemption as seen here. [https://detroitmi.gov/government/boards/property-assessment-board-review/homeowners-property-tax-assistance-program-hptap](https://detroitmi.gov/government/boards/property-assessment-board-review/homeowners-property-tax-assistance-program-hptap). This surge in investment, as well as the renovations for even more tax exemptions prices for real estate, will go up as long as enough of us do it.\n\nFinally, We will have taken over Detroit we now have to figure out what to do here. Any suggestions? Also because several things I mentioned are illegal I would like to tell the SEC, FBI, NSA, that all of this is an exaggerated theoretical joke and I am not responsible for the actions of those who cannot differentiate a joke from reality.",

        "selftext": "Hey Fuckers.\n\nI'm real new to this but I've made about +$6,000 in January so far (including my $4k Telsa loss, GUH). I've been looking for a way out of my job for awhile now (tech sales) and I think this could be the way. I've also got a little ecomm business on the side to fall back on if this turns out to not be the way.\n\nStarting Feb 1st, I'm going to put 3-4 hours into day trading options everyday with the goal of making 500-1000 daily. I work remote so I'm lucky I have some flexibility here. If I can make at least 10k before the end of February, I quit my job and go full time blow and hookers. \n\nWhat I'm looking to do here is post either daily or weekly my positions, gains and losses, and rationale behind everything. I think a lot of people ask if people on here make money so I'd like to be a case study. If I fail and go 100k in debt, I will give out discounted blowjobs to everyone on the thread to recoup my losses.\n\nIs gay to post the journey daily, is not gay?",

        "selftext": "Germany, the country full of people who think work is superior to mindless gambling, but then wonder why their pensions are so small, essentially kills what this sub stands for. How, you ask?\n\nWell, our beloved Minister of Finance Olaf Scholz (who proudly admitted all his private money sits in a 0% interest bank account because everything else would be far too risky) really is determined to kill off trading. After he got backlash for his ideas to abolish the capital gains tax (to tax financial gains under the almost always higher personal income tax) and introduce a 0.2% tax on stock transactions (yes, just stocks, not derivatives, because he is dumb), now actually managed to slip something into a law that no one seemed to notice.\n\nActive from 2021, the maximum loss from derivatives you can deduct from your taxes will be 10.000 EUR. I know, I know, taxes and shit is too complicated fo you guys here. So I will give you an example.\n\nSuppose its January 2019, TSLA is at 300$, and you bought 420$ TSLA Calls expiring in August for 50.000 EUR, because you believe in mighty Elon and he surely won't fail you. Except he does, and as a true bagholder you clinch to the sunken ship until it hits the ground, and all your money is gone. You post your losses here and everyone calls you a True Hero, so you can somehow live with it, but you swear you will never gamble like this again. Except two months later with TSLA at 220$ you do it anyway and throw the 10.000 EUR you have left at Calls again. You watch the stock rise and rise and rightfully think you are the goddamn smartest person to ever have existed on earth. You cash out and celebrate that you came back and now have 70.000 EUR. \n\nNow its tax season and you expect to pay 25% capital gains tax on your gains, which surely should be 0.25\\*(-50.000+60.000) = 2.500. So instead of 60.000 EUR you now have 67.500 EUR, paid 2500 EUR in taxes and everyone is happy, right?\n\nExcept with this law change the losses you can deduct per year are now kept at 10.000 EUR. That means you pay 0.25\\*(-10.000+60.000) = 12.500 EUR in taxes and are left with...57.500 EUR? Less than you started with? You are telling me I just risked 60.000 EUR to make 10.000 EUR and then the taxes I have to pay on that are bigger than my gains?\n\nYep, thats entirely correct.",

        "selftext": "Here's some real DD for you all. SPCE has more than doubled in the past month and everyone is hype for it. Do you know why it's up? Speculation alone. Their operating income is $0 as they have never recorded a sale and their only profits from Q4 2018 to Q3 2019 came from issuance of common stock, more commonly known as dilution. Now, the latest filings we have from SPCE are from November 12th, 2019 where their market cap was under $900 million and their stock price was just over $10. Now as we know their stock closed at almost $20 today, January 22nd, but their market cap has skyrocketed to over $3.8 billion. How has this happened? Dilution which means that the company is just pumping shares into the market. Per the November 12th filings SPCE had under 83 million shares outstanding, which includes insider shares and the float shares. Today though that amount is 196 million, which means they have more than doubled their total amount of shares on the market. Keep in mind that the only reliable guess of their cash balance is $0-$100 million, which is not nearly enough to really roll operations forward. If you're long for tendies be careful for the secondary offering to come out of nowhere and screw you hard. Best of luck betters.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf anyone wants to validate this go ahead and do so its all in their filings and accounting.

Every bit of advice I've followed from t hem has made me money. \n\nBut you don't want to pay $20 a month for stock tips? \n\nWell, that's good, because you don't have to, as I'm going to share it. \n\nThe Fool recommends the fice following stocks; APPN, HUBS, TSLA, TDD and ZM.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI look at this way, If I invest $100 and make $20, and you invest $100 and make $50, what have I lost?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEverything that follows is taken straight from the email they sent yesterday.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n **CURRENT PRICE:** [APPN](https://www.fool.com/premium/company/339157/) $\u00a045.26  $\u00a02.37 (5.5%) *Price as of* *January 10, 9:59 a.m.*\n\n**Appian** [(NASDAQ: APPN)](https://www.fool.com/premium/company/339157)\u00a0is making its fourth Best Buys Now appearance in the past six months as it pursues a better way to create apps. If you don't own shares or if you've been thinking about adding, consider this a nudge.\n\nAppian's solutions are sometimes called \"low-code,\" but this is a misnomer; the company offers large, complex integrations for its clients' work forces, featuring elegant programming tools allowing them to build their own solutions. (Hence the term \"low-code\" \u2014 you don't need to be an engineer to use Appian's products.)\n\nAfter seeing sluggish growth rates in the first half of 2019, Appian bounced back in the third quarter, with total sales climbing 26% year over year on an encouraging 38% jump in subscription revenue. Subscription revenue retention rates remained strong at 119%, an impressive display of customer loyalty.\n\nWe're still impressed with founder and CEO Matt Calkins and his long-term strategy in tapping what he sees as an addressable market that's growing toward $50 billion. Even as Appian goes up against some much larger players in the technology sector, the company's strong internal culture gives it a big competitive advantage. Enterprise customers need solid software solutions, and that will keep Appian's services in demand for the long run.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n \n\n**HubSpot** [(NYSE: HUBS)](https://www.fool.com/premium/company/317364) joins our Best Buys Now for the second time since Tom recommended it in [December](https://www.fool.com/premium/stock-advisor/coverage/18/coverage/updates/2019/12/05/buy-hubspot.aspx). The \"inbound marketing\" pioneer is helping more than 68,000 clients, including 28,000 multi-solution clients, build better sales and marketing channels than traditional advertising can offer. The results show up in the company's top-line subscription growth of more than 30%.\n\nTo drive those kinds of results, HubSpot's co-founders, CEO Brian Halligan and CTO Dharmesh Shah, are investing heavily in people and development. The latest addition to the C-suite is Yamini Rangan as the company's first-ever chief customer officer. She is formerly of **Dropbox** [(NASDAQ: DBX)](https://www.fool.com/premium/company/339953) and fellow *Stock Advisor* recommendation **Workday** [(NASDAQ: WDAY)](https://www.fool.com/premium/company/273717). In a \"physician heal thyself\" way, HubSpot's marketing, sales, and customer services team will fall under Rangan's leadership to help improve the company's own [flywheel](https://www.hubspot.com/flywheel) model, just as the company does for its clients.\n\nCompanies are becoming more focused on customers and friendly marketing than ever before (or at least, they should). HubSpot is here to help them. Halligan and Shah have built a superior culture that shows up in exceptional Glassdoor ratings that list HubSpot as the [top tech company](https://venturebeat.com/2019/12/10/glassdoor-hubspot-dethrones-zoom-as-the-best-tech-company-to-work-for-in-the-u-s/) to work for (topping fellow Best Buy Now **Zoom Video Communications** [(NASDAQ: ZM)](https://www.fool.com/premium/company/341090)). And after a rough patch in mid-2019, HubSpot's stock has been rallying, but it's still well off its all-time highs. With a market cap just over $7.4 billion and annual sales of $630 million, HubSpot has plenty of room to run in a dynamic market. If you haven't yet added it to your own portfolio, take a closer look today.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n **CURRENT PRICE:** [TSLA](https://www.fool.com/premium/company/224257/) $\u00a0479.50  -$\u00a01.84 (-0.4%) *Price as of* *January 10, 10:18 a.m.*\n\nTom recommended **Tesla** [(NASDAQ: TSLA)](https://www.fool.com/premium/company/224257) just last week, and if you haven't bought shares yet, we think it's still a great time. Under visionary CEO Elon Musk, the company has zoomed from\u00a01,500 deliveries of high-end Tesla Roadsters in 2010 to 367,500 vehicles overall in 2019. The mass-market Model 3 has been a big success, and Tesla remains committed to innovation with future electric models including its Cybertruck pickup and its Semi tractor-trailer.\n\nYet we don't see Tesla staying solely within the electric vehicle niche for long. We think there's more than a little Jeff Bezos in Musk; just Bezos took\u00a0**Amazon.com** [(NASDAQ: AMZN)](https://www.fool.com/premium/company/202816)\u00a0far beyond selling books into e-commerce and cloud computing, Tesla has the potential to make big waves in autonomous driving, renewable-energy building materials, artificial intelligence, and ride-sharing.\n\nMusk has his haters, but Tesla is succeeding. We're reminded of the doubters Bezos faced for years even as Amazon's stock soared \u2014 and Musk has a reputation among key players in technology as one of the smartest visionaries alive. He also has a fiercely loyal customer base supporting him in all of his efforts. Good things are happening at Tesla, and we're happy to be along for the ride.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n **CURRENT PRICE:** [TTD](https://www.fool.com/premium/company/338635/) $\u00a0281.92  -$\u00a04.72 (-1.6%) *Price as of* *January 10, 10:18 a.m.*\n\nWe've been beating the drum for **The Trade Desk** [(NASDAQ: TTD)](https://www.fool.com/premium/company/338635) for quite a while. Today marks the eighth\u00a0 time we've named it a Best Buy Now since the start of 2019, and that's on top of Tom's latest recommendation just [two months ago](https://www.fool.com/premium/stock-advisor/coverage/18/coverage/updates/2019/11/07/buy-the-trade-desk.aspx). Why do we bring it to your attention so often? Because we believe this remains one of the best opportunities in the market.\n\nFace it, advertising isn't going away any time soon. What The Trade Desk is doing is disrupting the industry. Basically, it offers transparency to ad buyers (those who want to advertise to us) and helps those companies place the ads where they do the most good. When their ads work, buyers come back (the company's had greater than 95% customer retention for the past 24 quarters) and more buyers try it out.\n\nAs a result, The Trade Desk's revenue has been growing by leaps and bounds. In the third quarter of 2019, revenue grew by 38%.\u00a0Admittedly, that's down from the 50% growth from the same period in 2018, but look at it this way: In absolute dollars, the most recent quarter's 38% increase represented revenue growth of $45.4 million, while Q3 2018's 50% increase was just $32.4 million of revenue growth.\u00a0And for the just-ended fourth quarter of 2019, the company is expecting $52.5 million more in revenue than it brought in during Q4 2018.\u00a0That's a bigger dollar increase than last quarter, meaning even more advertisers are using the platform.\n\nThe Trade Desk's share price is volatile. For example, it fell hard last fall before rising again to new highs. We expect more of that going forward, too. But with the large opportunity we believe is still ahead of it (and a dedicated CEO who owns 11%\u00a0of the company), we're willing to make it a Best Buy once again, even at these prices, expecting it to be much higher down the road.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n **CURRENT PRICE:** [ZM](https://www.fool.com/premium/company/341090/) $\u00a072.95  $\u00a00.33 (0.5%) *Price as of* *January 10, 10:18 a.m.*\n\nVideo conferencing platform provider **Zoom Video Communications** [(NASDAQ: ZM)](https://www.fool.com/premium/company/341090)\u00a0makes its fourth consecutive Best Buys Now appearance today because the stock price remains attractively inexpensive even as the fundamental business has kept picking up momentum.\n\nIn the third quarter of Zoom's fiscal 2020, revenue jumped 85% year over year, and the company nearly doubled the number of customers paying $100,000 or more in annualized revenue for its services. We're particularly excited about Zoom's net dollar expansion rate, which stayed above 130% for the sixth straight quarter (this metric measures how much more existing customers are spending now than they were a year ago). With new clients coming in and existing customers committing more to the platform, we see Zoom's growth staying strong well into the future.\u00a0The company now counts more than 74,000 customers with more than 10 employees.\n\nWe can't help but make the **Shopify** [(NYSE: SHOP)](https://www.fool.com/premium/company/335227) comparison when we look at Zoom. Both are founder-led, with Eric Yuan at Zoom and Tobi Lutke at Shopify each driving thriving cultures at the companies they founded. Both companies have built far better tools than the ones they replaced. Both are becoming more integral and important to their clients' lives, providing newer and better solutions. And Zoom offers all this at a $20 billion market cap.\n\nZoom still hasn't been publicly traded for a full year, and if you buy, it's wise to prepare for more volatility. But there's a lot we like about its future, and we think today is a good time to buy.",

        "selftext": "Other than the fact that Tesla is a great company and will undoubtedly do well worldwide in the coming years, I think NIO will give them a run for their money in China and hopefully the rest of the world.\n\nNIO has the opportunity to stand on the shoulder of a giant and do what Tesla has done, but do it better. Let me list off a few points of what's made me bullish as fuck on them:\n\n- Gone from concept to mass production faster than Tesla\n- CEO and founder William Li believes they will turn a profit faster than Tesla\n- Has NIO Formula E Team, a professional European sports car racing team that has set multiple records at world-reknown racetracks\n- Backed by the Chinese fucking government\n- First production car to have an interactive proprietary artificial intelligence, NOMI\n- Has their own clothing collection, NIO Life\n- Fucking in-seat massagers\n- 5 minute battery swap stations\n- NIO house, a showroom on the first floor with 3 more floors of community center space, look it up!\n- 200 planned NIO House/NIO Space showroom openings in 2020\n- Developed a driverless car while waiting for driverless tech\n- Can literally use Tesla's shared IP to get a competitive edge \n- Shared environmental preservation sentiment as Tesla, their name in Chinese literally means Blue Sky Ahead \n- NIO Service, can charge your car/swap the battery for you while you sleep if your home does not have a charging station\n- Cheap as fuck right now because people think they're going to run out of money\n\nThey're about to be even more heavily discounted over the next few weeks due to some hick ass bat soup disease. Gettin my money ready to wade deeper into the communist waters of China. You should to! Imagine being able to get into Tesla when it was this cheap. \n\nTesla is more than a car company you say? So will NIO be I believe. They, like China, have a far future in mind. They're looking to the horizon while others are looking at today. It's a company I have come to love and will stand by.\n\nGodspeed rewtards.",

        "selftext": "Ok, so we all know there's the Coronavirus going around. Here's my unsolicited advice:\n\n*What to do right now*\nIf you own any Chinese stock, get out of your position right now. If you have any calls that expire within the next few weeks, I would strongly advise you exit those as well. Protect yourself from further losses immediately. \n\n*What to watch for*\nKeep your eyes and ears peeled for the apex of viral infection. When numbers of infected peak and level off, you may want to consider getting back into the market. \n\n*What to buy right now*\nRight now buying puts on most individual Chinese stocks and indexes should prove to be fruitful. Better to get them now rather than later.\n\n*What to buy later*\nAny stock that was heavily depressed by the news, that you believe is undervalued and will rebound quickly. You may want to also keep an eye on American companies that manufacture in China. If this goes on longer than a week, their production lines will be affected and they will be ripe for buying opportunities later as well.\n\nSome of my favorite stocks at the moment are Chinese. The big three I am most interested in are Luckin' Coffee, NIO and Alibaba. All are in and will continue to be driven into bargain territory this week due to the extended Chinese New Years Holiday and likely even further beyond that.\n\n*What's the buy point*\nThis is hugely speculative, but here are my predictions on the best buying points for my three mentioned stocks above:\n\nLK:\nAttractive - $30\nGet In Now - $24\nMust Buy - $18 and below\n\nNIO:\nAttractive - $3\nBuy Now - $2.50\nThrow Your Money At It - $2 and below\n\nBABA:\nAttractive: $200\nBuy Now: $160\nMortgage your home: $135 and below\n\n*What does all of this mean*\nIt means you have the buying opportunity of the year or possibly even years in these stocks. As long as the virus doesnt kill off too many people, the Chinese economy will bounce back even stronger and your profits will swell along with it. \n\n*Final Thoughts*\nKeep your cool and focus on profiting in these market conditions. Many opportunities are presenting themselves, have the calm sense to realize what they are. I have already eaten losses myself. If you have too, pick yourselves up, pat yourself on the back and get your ass back in the game\n\nBest of luck to all my WSBros and well-wishes to all those who are suffering in China from the direct and indirect effects of the coronavirus.",

It wasn\u2019t consistent, I was making something like \u00a350 a month. \n\nI had just turned 16 and I had a few friends who did this online sales thing with me. We used to do everything to keep our little business a secret from people because we knew that, these sites (amazon and eBay) were going to be very popular in the future and we wanted to keep the opportunity to ourselves. \n\nLooking back now, one can see that we were pretty much sold on both platforms and my much older self would have gladly invested in these companies based on our little success selling online. \n\nHowever, when I look at the historical balance sheets of these businesses, especially amazon , I realise that I would have hesitated to invest in the company because they had 0 earnings, PE ratio was ridiculously high etc. \n\nToday I wonder if that fundamental analysis can sometimes be a hinderance when it comes to picking obvious (amazon was a gold mine for anyone with spare stuff lying around) growth companies. \n\nI wonder if there was a very clever adult (retail investor without Bloomberg terminal and all that fancy stuff) who figured (10yrs ago) that the internet was going to be the future and aggressively bought shares in some of the trendy public companies back then (Fbook, amazon, eBay, Netflix)\n\n\nAny thoughts on this?",

        "selftext": "God this sub really is retarded. The last couple of days I've been reading that people don't understand what a put credit spread is or don't understand how spreads work. Just yesterday I read a post where op was clearly bullish on spy and did put credit spreads and calls but people called him retarded cause they only read \"put\" and think \"he want market down\"\n\nAlright retards this is how it works. \n\nYou sell a put that's out of the money. You buy a put that's one strike below the put you sell. The difference between the two strikes is your collat. If you sell a put at 315, and buy a put at 314, your max lose is 100 dollars. The difference for you retards is 314-315=1. 1x100= 100.(if your really dumb, we multiply by 100 because options are contracts that move 100 shares per option) 100 is your max lose. You collect the premium that is the difference between the two strikes. If the premium for the 315 strike is 10 bucks, and the premium for the 314 is 5 bucks, your risking 100 dollars to make 5 dollars. \n\nHope your still following along retards. \n\nAt exp you collect your 5 dollar premium. The put you sold becomes worthless, as does the put you bought. The put you sold is worth more than the put you bought. Which is why you make 5 dollars. \n\n\"oh but I'm scared and too stupid to understand this stuff, what if I get assigned\" \n\nThat's alright retard, the put you bought is insurance that your ok if the stock goes into free fall. Once you get assigned, your exercise the put you bought to sell the shares back into the market. Your brokerage understands whats happening. You receive negative buying power for the meantime til you exercise your long leg. \n\n\"oh but I'm still really dumb and can't critically think, what happens if the put I bought doesn't end up in the money, am I fuckkkkedddd? \n\nNo retard just think about it for a second. If the put you bought can't be exercised, you just sell the 100 shares back into the market. Let's do some simple math (which I failed in 12th grade). You get assigned on your 315 put sell. You receive the 100 shares. The stock drops to 314.50. You can't exercise your long leg. You sell the shares back at 314.50. The difference between 315 and 314.50 is 50 cents. Multiply .50x100. It equals 50 dollars. Your lose is 50 dollars. \n\nSame goes for call credit spreads. Congrats your now less retarded. If your really too dumb to understand this, keep reading this post til it clicks.",

        "selftext": " Joel Tillinghast, a once-legendary portfolio fund manager and colleague at Fidelity, sometimes describes retail apparel investing as \"momentum-based\". After all, when it works, you look like a genius: people throw $20 bills at you in exchange for flimsy cotton shifts that cost $3.50 to manufacture and $5 to market. Every appareler is convinced they have the Midas touch, and [when it stops working](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forever_21), the public reacts to the your brand as if they'd awakened in some haze: \"Why did we buy this stuff to begin with?\" consumers wonder. \"Why did we give this thing such a high multiple?\" investors wonder. Somehow, we never learn the lesson with apparel, and so the cycle continues.  \n\n\nThere's a subtle distinction I'd like to make, though. While \"momentum\" is a good first-order approximation, it doesn't really describe what's actually going on: a realization gradient. Consumers over time realize the social capital that's being conveyed through apparel, and buy it because they come to an understanding. The realization gradient works both ways: some consumers are less quick to realize the death of a brand, but they eventually catch on and stop buying as well. The belief that apparel is a random walk down human preferences isn't accurate: rather, the social-capital zeitgeist shifts over time, and brands that are well-positioned to trade on that social capital do well.  \n\n\nVictoria's Secret (owned by publicly traded Limited Brands) is entering the negative realization death spiral. The clothing is now perceived as uncomfortable, overpriced vs alternatives, and promoting unhealthy expectations. Les Wexner's [Epstein connection](https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2019/7/10/20689134/jeffrey-epstein-les-wexner-l-brands-victoria-secret-limited) is certainly not helping. The optics are horrendous. What was once sexy is now complicit. Worse, there are far, far too many competent competitors. Let's review.  \n\n\nGap Body has been exceptionally successful at targeting lingerie \"basics\", Journelle and Nordstrom round out the midtier, and Agent Provocateur and La Perla round out the high end.\n\n[Link to lots of women in lingerie.  For science.](http://theyieldblog.com/l_brands)\n\nDon't even get me started on the infinity of online competitors -- Adore Me, Panache, Hanky Panky, Heidi Klum Intimates, Mapale, Yummie, Addiction Nouvelle, Parfait, Le Mystere, Montelle Intimates, Giapenta, and Cosabella turn up with a few seconds of searching. Victoria's Secret is deader-than-dead, and worse yet, has massive operating leases and a fleet of retail sales associates that will accelerate its demise. To be honest, I've never understood how lingerie at Victoria's Secret became such a dominant in-store purchasing phenomenon to begin with: the shopping experience for men is at best awkward, and for women the brand is currently perceived as regressive, uncomfortable, and sexist. I'd also argue that the competition is broader than we realize: various athleisure brands fulfill a similar body-positivity drive while mitigating any feelings of being [complicit](https://www.forbes.com/sites/pamdanziger/2018/11/25/thirdlove-tells-john-mehas-how-to-fix-victorias-secret-in-full-page-new-york-times-ad/#292449f72285). Limited Brands will of course cut non-performing VS stores, but the question is how fast?  \n\n\nThere's an inherent tension between bondholders and equity holders here: Les Wexner owns 17% of the outstanding equity, his wife owns another 5%, and will issue dividends until it becomes [fraudulent conveyance](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fraudulentconveyance.asp) to continue to do so. The fact that any dividends are being issued while a). the company needs to cut leases b). the company holds &gt;$5bn in debt yielding 6%+ and c). sales are imploding demonstrates either incompetent corporate finance or denial on the part of Les Wexner. If US creditor protection were stronger, bondholders might be able to fire off warning letters now asking Limited Brands leadership to start cutting leases, paying down debt, and halting dividend issuance. As it stands now, the only thing bondholders can do is sit back and record grievances until Chapter 11 gets filed.  \n\n\nI see only one way Limited Brands can pull itself out of this mess: Grow Bath &amp; Body Works fast enough to offset Victoria's Secret losses, and cut VS costs rather than trying to save a dead brand on the wrong side of the realization gradient. On Bath &amp; Body Works:\n\n*\"Their target is what we call the mastige segment,\" she continues. \"It's not prestige and it's not mass\u2014it's really about figuring out this niche of very American-centric shoppers that wants a notch above drugstore brands, but are still quite conscious. They don't want the prestige segment, which is where the Est\u00e9e Lauders and the L'Oreals of the world play.\" A compelling factor here is the price point. The largest size room spray (5.3 ounces) is only $9.50; foam soaps are $5.50; fragrance mists are $14. You can buy one item from every major category and barely spend $100. Kang confirms that's a huge part of the appeal. She says the diehard fan \"is someone who just absolutely loves fragrances, and sees fragrance as an essential part of her lifestyle.\" She adds, \"A lot of our customers actually own multiple fragrances, and they engage in fragrance the way that they do other fashion items in their life. It's a way to accessorize their style. It's not this sort of serious, deep-commitment kind of purchase that you see with a more traditional model in a department store.\"*\n\n1. I once mistakenly stayed in the AirBnB of what I at the time could only describe as a \"crazy candle lady\" who burned a different scent every 6 hours. It's a little bit sad that corporate marketing accords more nuance and empathy to their customers than anyone else ever would.  \n\n\n2. Bath &amp; Bodyworks' product is defensible: most \"nice things\" are expensive for most Americans, whereas Bath and Body Works offers an affordable, guiltless, if synthetic form of self-care. The guiltlessness of the brand is the ultimate growth driver: its products are sweets-adjacent (notice how many of the candles below are food-oriented), and inexpensive. Most activities I personally enjoy are either expensive enough to induce some amount of guilt, or unhealthy enough to do the same. There are almost no \"free pleasures\" -- an inexpensive scent from Bath &amp; Body Works might be one of the few. I think this is ultimately what's giving Bath &amp; Body Works its incredible comps, and being scent-based, it's of course naturally resistant to online competition.\n\n[Limited Brands Financial Model](http://theyieldblog.com/l_brands)  (Link to financial model)\n\nHere's a model of my best guess of what will happen (click on the image so you don't have to squint). There are a couple noteworthy things here:\n\n1). VS has not yet signficiantly cut non-lease SG&amp;A -- in fact it appears to still be growing in the low-single digits. This is totally unacceptable and honestly shows that LB management is either delusional or incompetent: if your revenues are declining 8% a year and you somehow find a way to grow SG&amp;A, you are either flailing, an imbecile, or a flailing imbecile. My guess, after having worked at many companies, is that Limited Brands management never set up the kind of performance-attribution tracking necessary to intelligently allocate capital. Their internal planning is likely just budget-based departmental fights. What's worse, new CEO Mehas is likely ride-or-die on Victoria's Secret: so long as he continues to describe his job as \"listening to the consumer\", rather than \"tying a tourniquet\", I expect SG&amp;A to be flat at best. There's also the \"stubborn founder\" angle -- for Les Wexner to order Mehas to cut VS would be a repudiation of his life's work. Old billionaires tend to get very sticky, and given Wexner's affiliations with Epstein, doubly so.  \n\n\n2). Various gross margins have been adjusted -- many non-cash impairments are negatively impacting earnings in a way that is irrelevant to the business.  \n\n\n3). Store leases are typically around 10 years long and non-cancellable, but management is only cutting total VS store square footage by around 3% a year, which means it's only closing around 30% of available \"closeable\" stores. This is not remotely aggressive enough. Management should be aggressively negotiating subleases and taking lease break restructuring impairments on their worst-performing stores. They should also avoid opening new stores, especially not ones in [nearly-Brexit](https://tietheknot.scot/the-first-victorias-secret-store-in-scotland-opens-today/) Scotland. I mean really, what is Les Wexner thinking?  \n\n\n4). While I continue to model growth in Bath &amp; Body Works, I think we are close to hitting a wall on growth: most women I know consider the brand to be for tweens and low-income young mothers. There's also minimal international appeal -- this is a niche brand for middle American women that is nearing saturation. Even if we assume 50m American women buy $100 a year of the stuff, that still only gets us $5bn of annual revenues. I think we are very close to hitting a wall in overall appetite unless Bath and Body Works can find some new realization gradient with very different demographics.  \n\n\n5). VS sales and gross margin decline comes almost completely from promotions, aka price cuts. VS will likely struggle to keep gross margins above 30% in the future.  \n\n\n6). I really want to emphasize how much the core of this conflict is fundamentally about capital structure ownership: equity performance via leveraged SG&amp;A, versus debt de-leveraging via decreased SG&amp;A. Non-rent SG&amp;A is the single largest controllable driver of VS operating profits. Yes, the [fashion show was cancelled](https://variety.com/2019/tv/news/victorias-secret-fashion-show-canceled-why-1203413186/), but it's not enough: literally the entire company hinges on whether it can cut SG&amp;A or not -- by 2025 VS will be 0% operating margins from VS declines, even if they manage to reverse SG&amp;A growth and cut it by 3%. Dramatic restructuring will be necessary to save Limited Brands.  \n\n\nPersonally, I am going to own a small holding of LBrands bonds: it doesn't look like the company as a whole will become insolvent by 2027, whereas the stock will almost certainly be unable to avoid a complete implosion in a few years, so I am planning on shorting 1/3 of the amount of my bond holdings amount in equity. The goal here is to target a very narrow, carefully modeled valuation range of stub equity value mismanaged by thumb-sucking leadership that will pull themselves out of a crisis only when things get dire.",

        "selftext": " Alright you Autist,\n\nMy first post on WSB, long live bull gang.\n\nLet\u2019s get to options trading using cool shit like MACD, RSI, and GAP so we can go all in and lose our money together, head to the \u201cWinchester, have a nice cold pint, and wait for 2020 to blow over.\u201d Note: I\u2019m not a pro or a financial advisor, use at your own risk. What I am is a 300lb neckbeard that loves the show Billions, cries at the end of Wolf of Wallstreet, and comments on Pornhub videos. But anyway\u2026I\u2019ll be using AMD due to the bull gang love and CGC cause some autist is giving out wrong info, don\u2019t buy that shit.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**RSI:**\n\nDafuq is RSI? Well\u2026it stands for Relative Strength Index\u2026and Wikipedia says it\u2019s \u201ca momentum indicator that measures the magnitude of recent price changes to evaluate overbought or oversold conditions in the price of a stock.\u201d For our purposes here, think of it as just one word, **Momentum**. We can look at the momentum of a stock based on specific criteria, 250 days and 10 days and select times to buy and sell contracts of said stock. This generally works on a 1day \u2013 5minute chart. I like to day trade options, scalp, take my tendies, hit up Wendy\u2019s\u2026dat baconator nawmean. *Find what works best for your trading style*.\n\n\\*RSI | 250-day Indicator\\*\n\nThink of this as the \u201coverall\u201d momentum of the stock.  RSI is used for overbought/oversold positions and floats between 30-70. For our trading, think of 50 as our indicator line. Anything above is a \u201cbullish\u201d stock and anything below is a \u201cbearish\u201d stock.\n\nBullish: AMD \u2013  [https://imgur.com/a/sbTXDb7](https://imgur.com/a/sbTXDb7) \n\nBearshit: CGC \u2013 [https://imgur.com/a/nI2BTpd](https://imgur.com/a/nI2BTpd) \n\nThis shows the long-term trend of the stock, rather it\u2019s on fire or crashing like Pier 1 imports. As you can see AMD is bullish and well, I will repeat don\u2019t by that shit CGC yet options wise (until it hits the below stuff, the call the fuck out of it).\n\n\\*RSI | 10-day Indicator\\*\n\nThe 10-day chart shows your entry and exist points (look to call / look to put) for potentially gaining max profit.\n\nSimilar to the 50 line for the 250-day indicator, we\u2019re looking at the 30 and 60 lines for the 10-day chart.\n\nTreasure Map: AMD - [https://imgur.com/a/K12HIkG](https://imgur.com/a/K12HIkG) \n\nAs you can see, usually charts come around after the 30 and 6 levels. So for buying calls, watch for the stock to drop below 30 and then place a put on the loop-around back once it crosses 30 again. Ride it up as long as you want, but once it crosses 60, I sell the option, rather ITM, ATM, or OTM.\n\nSame for puts, but inverse, put at the 2nd 60 line , exist at the first 30 line break.\n\nHopefully you\u2019ll profit. I even added in some puts to show the bear gang some luv. &lt;3 fap n nap\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**MACD:**\n\nNow that you\u2019re an expert options ~~trader~~ autist at RSI, let\u2019s move to MACD\u2026I like to call it the MacDaddy. But really, MACD stands for Moving Average Convergence Divergence and it\u2019s a trend-following momentum indicator that shows the relationship between two moving averages of a security's price. For our purposes, none of that shit matters, we\u2019re looking for X marks the spot on calls or puts.\n\nThis one is simple, use the 50 line as your baseline (similar to RSI 250) with 12 and 26 as your settings. Anytime the moving averages cross (make an X) above the 50 line, that\u2019s usually a sign to put, if below the 50 line, that\u2019s usually a call option.\n\nExample: [https://imgur.com/a/C9KdtDm](https://imgur.com/a/C9KdtDm) \n\nMake sure you review the chart overall, look at the amount of time it took to move $X amount. Based on your dollar movement estimate for either calls or puts, always multiple by 10. For example, if a stock is $11, and I put a call for $13, I wouldn\u2019t want to cut myself short, so I\u2019d get a call that\u2019s about 20 days out ($2 x 10 = 20) Jesus titty fucking Christ break out the calculator already and do your own math.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**GAP:** \n\nMy personal favorite and I\u2019m not talking about the GAP between my eyebrows either, thanks genetics. Fucking 2020 caveman over here. Anyway\u2026\n\nI like it cause it\u2019s easy and narrows down my choices for what to call or put. I look at stocks that gapped up or down and use the above RSI and MacDaddy to see if it\u2019s at a good entry point. If all 3 stars align, viola, you\u2019ll be driving a cybertruck in no time.\n\nExample GAP: [https://imgur.com/a/peLJBTk](https://imgur.com/a/peLJBTk) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Parting words of wisdom:**\n\n\\- It\u2019s a marathon, not a race\n\n\\- No one went broke locking in profits\n\n\\- Don\u2019t be greedy, build you stack once option at a time\n\n\\- F for the Bear gang\n\nLuv, \n\nFap-n-Nap",

They are companies similar to Berskshire.  I asked what about my current stocks, are they transferable in kind to these funds.  He said no, they would be sold.  I brought up the fact that between a group of stocks that I own, I counted capital gain of 300k and with a few loser stocks that I lost about 40k.  So I have to pay tax on that now, which would put me in the highest tax bracket.  I could not believe he had no answer for that and did not even think about that.  I am not that smart but even I knew that.  He was proud that last year my portfolio did 15%, which is a mix of stocks, bonds, GIC.  Well on my own side, I did 15 % as well with some basic TD bank mutual funds, VTI and a few good stocks.  A lot of you guys on here are well versed in trading, I know enough to be dangerous and the dangerous part got me in trouble.  Face it, the last 8 years, anyone could have made money.  When I first started in the late 90's, it was like now.  I would buy 5k of stocks, in a few months, it was worth 7k, I would sell and go on vacation. Then the tech crash came  and i lost a ton. I am getting older, so you don't want to lose it all and that is what rbs is supposed to do but to sell all my stuff and hand me a huge capital gain bill was insane.",

The introduction of coronavirus into the most bullish stock market and economy of all time presents an interesting opportunity where I feel that we can predict a market downturn as well as the timing of said downturn, with just a little old fashioned psychology, and publicly available facts.\n\n\n\n#Predicting the future is hard\n\nI do not know how many people will die from Coronavirus. I do not know the eventual death rate. I do not know the probability of a full scale pandemic. Neither does anybody else, really. So this point does not stand against me. \n\n#Predicting the mob is easy.\n\nPeople read the news, still. This news seeps into their mind and subtly changes the way their fingers interact with their big swinging hedge fund dicks, and Robinhood portfolios. Hedge fund managers definitely still read the news, even if you autists don't. What's my point? The news media is wildly misrepresenting the current situation with the Coronavirus. Dipshit journalists will cite things like \"the flu infects more people than corona\" or \"death rate of only 3%\" as if these are not wildly naive statistical calculations. What's my point? When corona has infected more people than SARS(should be the case in just 2-3 days), you will see very panicky headlines stating that fact. When the US shuts all travel to China, journalists will likewise create a broad sense of panic. People will take to social media and become aware of the scale. This will create an atmosphere of panic. When the virus starts to slow down, and things are actually getting better, in a twist of irony, the sample mortality rate will creep up. This is a basic statistical fact -- as the growth remains high, the mortality rate will be understated as the population is predominated by relatively more healthy recently infected persons, and as the growth rate slows, the mortality rate will approach reality. \n\nAs these facts become more widely known, optimism will turn to panic. Future surprises with Coronavirus to be negative! That is the nature of this kind of thing. Dr. Taleb has done some great work on this subject which I recommend.\n\n#Coronavirus will have some impact on S&amp;P 500. \n\nThe fed is pumping money to all time highs. We are in the most bullish stock market of all time. All we need is a little fear, and the change in animal spirits will be self-reinforcing. The economy is slowing despite the roaring stock market. In addition we have the real economic impact of shutting down large parts of China, cancelling travel between countries, etc. Even a small change to absolute GDP can mean a  relatively significant change to a quarterly growth rate figure, which is what moves the markets.\n\n#Will Coronavirus spread to Europe and the USA in a significant way?\n\nI hope not. I don't think my thesis depends on it. I'm not here to fearmonger. However, I absolutely recommend taking minor medical precautions with some awareness that this is a possibility. For instance, if you are a gross person who does not wash their hands, maybe now is the time to learn. (don't sell your 401ks people!!)\n\n#What is the timing of these puts?\n\nSeeing as how the virus has to slow down in the next 40 days or infection rates will be higher than the entire world population, you are safe with puts that far out. I am going a little earlier, because I feel that surpassing SARS will be a critical psychological point. What strike? Fuck if I know. Go with something that's not too hot, not too cold, just right. The baby bear amount. (whose name has been unrightfully stolen by that human bitch Goldilocks who steals from innocent bears!!)\n\n#Should I listen to you?\n\nAbsolutely not.

        "selftext": "The author Bill Dudley is a senior research scholar at Princeton University\u2019s Center for Economic Policy Studies. He served as president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York from 2009 to 2018, and as vice chairman of the Federal Open Market Committee. He was previously chief U.S. economist at Goldman Sachs.\n\nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-01-29/fed-s-repo-response-isn-t-fueling-the-stock-market\n\nDuring the past few months, the U.S. stock market has surged as the the Federal Reserve bought hundreds of billions dollars of Treasury bills to add reserves to the banking system and calm the repo market. Are the two connected? Or is the stock market going up for other reasons? The answer is important because the Fed\u2019s large T-bill purchases will end  soon. If the central bank\u2019s balance-sheet expansion is truly lifting stocks, then the market is vulnerable when these purchases cease. \n\nI am skeptical that the Fed\u2019s balance-sheet expansion is having a major effect on U.S. stock prices. First, of course, correlation isn't the same as causation. Just because two things are moving together doesn\u2019t mean that one causes the other. Second, and more importantly, the notion that the Fed\u2019s actions are fueling a stock market bubble isn\u2019t supported by how the Fed\u2019s T-bill purchases are affecting short-term interest rates or how the Fed\u2019s actions are increasing liquidity in the financial system. Third, there is a more obvious explanation behind the stock market\u2019s rise: the prospect of a sustained economic expansion and a Fed that is likely to stay on the sidelines and not raise its federal funds rate target in 2020. \n\n\nTurning first to the impact of the Fed\u2019s purchases on short-term interest rates -- it has been trivial. At the beginning of September, before the upward pressure on repo rates and the Fed\u2019s decision to buy $60 billion of T-bills per month, the spread between the effective fed funds rate and the rate that the Fed pays on reserve balances was about three basis points, or three-hundredths of a percentage point. Today, that spread has fallen to roughly zero. When the supply of bank reserves increases substantially, this puts modest downward pressure on the fed funds rate because more of the trading activity occurs between banks and the government-sponsored enterprises that cannot earn interest on their cash balances at the Fed, rather than trading among banks. \n\nSimilarly, the Fed\u2019s T-bill purchases have had only a small impact on the level of T-bill rates relative to the fed funds rate and the interest rate that the Fed pays on reserves. This is a bit harder to sort out because the longer maturity of T-bills means that expectations of Fed rate cuts affect T-bill rates but not overnight rates. But even here it is hard to discern much impact from the Fed\u2019s asset purchases. At the beginning of November, after the Fed\u2019s last rate cut, the spread between the four-week T-bill and the effective fed funds rate was three basis points. That spread now is close to zero.\n\nSo it isn\u2019t rates. But couldn\u2019t it be that the rise in bank reserves is increasing liquidity, fueling the equity market? The problem with this argument is that when the Fed buys T-bills and increases the amount of reserves in the banking system, that liquidity can\u2019t go elsewhere. It can move from bank to bank as households and businesses shift where they hold their bank balances. The only exception is if bank customers decide to increase their holdings of currency. But if they do that, that reduces the amount of excess reserves in the banking system. \n\nThe Fed\u2019s T-bill purchases substitute a bank reserve (essentially equivalent to a one-day T-bill) for a slightly longer risk-free asset (a T-bill) that the Fed now holds in its portfolio. But that\u2019s it. There are no funds created to purchase equities. \n\nIn contrast, the quantitative easing by the Fed from 2009 to 2013 removed long-duration, fixed-income assets from the market. This pushed down long-term bond yields significantly and made equities relatively more attractive.    \n\nThere are much better explanations for the recent rise in the U.S. stock market than the Fed\u2019s T-bill purchases. I would put three developments front and center: \n\nThe Fed cut its fed funds rate target by 75 basis points in 2019 to a range of 1.5% to 1.75%. Monetary policy is more accommodative now than a year ago. Longer-dated yields are also lower as a consequence. \nThe Fed has signaled that it is unlikely to raise rates until inflation climbs meaningfully above the central bank's 2% inflation target. As a result, both the Fed and market participants believe that monetary policy will remain on hold in 2020. \nThe risk of a U.S. economic slowdown seems to have subsided. Most notable is the abatement of trade tensions with China and the expectation that in an election year, they will remain subdued this year. \n\nThe Fed\u2019s expansion of its balance sheet and the increase in bank reserves have stabilized U.S. money markets. As a result, the Fed is likely to gradually taper its repo-market interventions and significantly slow its T-bill purchases after the April tax season. The end of this aggressive provision of bank reserves, however, is unlikely to create major problems for the U.S. equity market. Instead, what will matter is the economic outlook, the risk of a U.S. economic downturn, whether inflation rises and whether the Fed will stay accommodative.",

This is probably the wrong place to post this but I know a lot of you actually have a good idea of whats going on.

How can a private bank, designed to make profit, be so interconnected to government.  The video mentions that they have literally never been audited.

        "selftext": "This time last year, Slack Technologies, the popular workplace chat provider, was one of the most eagerly anticipated public tech debuts of 2019. That seems like a long time ago. Since Slack went public in June, its stock has dropped about 40%.\n\n\nThe reason for the slump: Revenue growth at Slack is slowing and competition is intensifying, especially from Microsoft. The tech giant is relying on a familiar tactic\u2014bundling a Slack killer with a widely used existing product, its Office 365 suite of apps. Given that competitive pressure, I predict 2020 will be the year that\u2014after years of acquisition speculation\u2014a larger tech company will finally buy Slack.\n\n\nPotential suitors could include Amazon\u2014which has reportedly eyed Slack in the past\u2014and Google. Both companies are top providers of cloud computing services and could plug Slack into their cloud units to increase the revenue they generate from online applications. \n\n\nAlready a big Amazon cloud customer, Slack has committed to spending a minimum of $250 million with the Amazon Web Services division between 2018 and 2023, according to regulatory filings. Becoming part of Amazon could help Slack\u2014which is currently unprofitable\u2014trim some costs.    \n\n\nCisco Systems and Salesforce, both of which could use a spark to fire up their collaboration software businesses, might also make sense as acquirers. Both companies have relationships with corporate chief information officers that could open the door to customers in the Fortune 500. \n\n\nA Slack purchase would be a sizable deal. Slack has a market capitalization of just over $12 billion, although its management would likely push for a higher price. One benchmark they might point to: A few weeks before it went public, Slack was valued in private market trades at about $19 billion. At that price, Slack would be the largest acquisition ever for the likes of Amazon, Google, Cisco, and Salesforce.  \n\n\nOne company that likely won\u2019t buy Slack is the company that would arguably be most responsible for its sale: Microsoft. Owning Slack, along with its in-house Slack competitor, Teams, would give Microsoft a dominant position in workplace collaboration software. Microsoft reportedly considered offering an $8 billion bid for Slack in 2016 before deciding to funnel more investment into building out Teams. \n\n\nBut I\u2019m skeptical that Microsoft could pull off such a deal. Gaining regulatory approval would be an ordeal, if not impossible, because Microsoft already offers a directly competitive product. Microsoft went through the antitrust wringer two decades ago and is happy to avoid joining other big tech companies in the regulatory spotlight now. \n\n\nSpokespeople from AWS and Salesforce declined to comment. A Microsoft spokesperson didn\u2019t have a comment. Spokespeople from Cisco and Google didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment. \n\n\nIf Slack CEO and co-founder Stewart Butterfield doesn\u2019t want to sell, he will have to find a way to win back investor confidence. Clearly what is worrying Wall Street is Slack\u2019s slowing revenue growth and increasing losses. \n\n\nThe company\u2019s annual sales grew 110% in fiscal 2018, which ended last Jan. 31, from the prior year. In fiscal 2019, that figure fell to 82%. In its most recent earnings report, Slack forecast that revenue growth for fiscal 2020 will fall even further to around 55%. Meanwhile, its net loss rose to about $88 million in the third quarter, from nearly $48 million a year earlier.\n\n\nSlack has spread like wildfire as a business tool largely through a free version of its product. To continue to grow, it must find ways to convince these users to become paying ones. During its recent earnings call, for the quarter ended Oct. 31, the company said it had 105,000 paying customers, up 30% from the same period a year earlier. \n\n\nIn an interview, Daniel Newman, founder and principal analyst at Futurum Research, said Slack\u2019s early growth was partly due to developers\u2019 frustration with the limitations of older products like Microsoft\u2019s Skype and Cisco\u2019s Webex. Now, with Microsoft pouring money into Teams and making improvements to the product to entice large companies, Slack has to work much harder to attract customers, he said. And a host of younger companies, such as Zoom and Asana, and open source startups, including Mattermost and Rocket.Chat, also offer workplace collaboration tools. \n\n\n\u201cThere is a lot of competition in the collaboration space right now,\u201d Newman said. \n\n\nThe growing competition highlights another issue for Slack. Having captured a loyal following of developers and technical users through word of mouth, it is now spending heavily on sales and marketing to show how its software can help companies be more productive. During the third quarter, its sales and marketing expenses jumped 42% to over $96 million. \n\n\nMicrosoft appears to have gotten into Butterfield\u2019s head. This first became apparent in 2016 when Slack took out a full-page ad in The New York Times to \u201cwelcome\u201d Microsoft to the market around the time it introduced Teams. More recently, Butterfield has sounded a defensive note on earnings calls, pointing out that Slack has to earn every customer and can\u2019t rely on bundling its product with other business applications, as Microsoft does. \n\n\nHe often pushes back on Microsoft\u2019s framing of its daily active user numbers for Teams, claiming that the company muddies the waters by counting people who make voice calls using Skype. Slack\u2019s usage figures more accurately reflect the deep level of engagement its users have with the service, according to Butterfield. \u201cThe confusion is deliberately created,\u201d Butterfield said on Slack\u2019s recent fiscal third quarter earnings call with investors. \n\n\nWhatever the reason, Butterfield faces a choice: Keep fighting or surrender by selling.",

        "selftext": "Within the next month we're going to get the final decision from a judge about whether or not the merge will happen. There's a ton of doubt about this merger, but I for one can't fathom it not going through. It would make no logical sense for a judge to deny a merger under the grounds that it would create less competition (which is what the states are suing over) for the following reasons:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* If the deal falls through, Sprint wouldn't survive independently anyway\n   * It could potentially be bought out by a number of other companies in this case\n* In exchange for the deal, Sprint has a deal to sell off Boost mobile to Dish networks which would maintain a cheaper cellular service alternative\n* T-Mobile has made an agreement not to raise any prices on any of their plans for a number of years after the deal\n* This plan would allow T-Mobile to make custom deals with varying degrees of connection once they combine Sprint's bandwidth with their own\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf and when this merger is accepted in the following weeks, the price is bound to rise past $7.83 which is the value that the merger offer places Sprint stock at. The last time it was believed the merger was going through, $S jumped to over $8.50. It currently sits at $4.37 as I type this. \n\nThe new T-Mobile will immediately become a powerhouse player and start eating away at Verizon and AT&amp;T's market share. It will position them to have the best 5G in existence due to Sprint's investments in the technology over the years. \n\nAnother motive for this merger is to beat Huawei at 5G coverage in the states. It would be a serious injustice for us to stop this kind of technological race from completing over a bunch of district attorneys trying to act virtuous for political points. \n\nIt's unlikely that a failure to merge would really destroy Sprint as a whole. They've just set up a round of a billion dollars in funding to helpcover their debts. I can't imagine $S falling below $3.40 if this fails.\n\nLet's say there's a 40% chance of this merger going through. In poker, if you have a 40% chance of winning a hand with a promise of 200% return on your investment, and the risk is only a 25% loss if you're wrong, you gamble. No brainer.\n\nI'm long on $S and please feel free to set your !RemindMe for a month to check back on this one.",
