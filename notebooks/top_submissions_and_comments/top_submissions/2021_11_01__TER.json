Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp; news on this Tuesday, November 2nd, 2021-\n\n*****\n\n# [Stock futures are little changed as major averages hover near records; Tesla shares slide](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/01/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)\n\n*****\n&gt; Stock futures were basically flat in early morning trading on Tuesday after the S&amp;P 500 eked out a fresh record close on Monday to kick off November.\n*****\n&gt; Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average were up by 38 points. S&amp;P 500 futures were flat and Nasdaq 100 futures was lower by 0.15%\n*****\n&gt; All three major U.S. stock indexes hit new intraday highs and closed at records during Monday\u2019s regular session as investors continue to bet on a year-end rally despite supply chain issues, Covid risk and a Federal Reserve that\u2019s about to indicate it\u2019s going to pull back on some stimulus. The Fed\u2019s two-day meeting begins Tuesday.\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 has averaged gains of 1.1% in November and 2.3% in December since 1936, notes Bank of America. The final month of the year is in the green 79% of the time, the firm notes. However, Bank of America is cautious.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe continue to see downside risks ahead,\u201d wrote Savita Subramanian, the bank\u2019s head of U.S. equity and quantitative strategy. \u201cDespite a strong 7% beat, 2021-22 EPS remains largely unchanged, suggesting the upward revision cycle has likely peaked.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Tesla shares cooled off Tuesday after popping during the end of October. Shares of the electric automaker tumbled 5% premarket, though they are up 55% over just the past month. The drop follows a report that the carmaker is recalling 11,700 of its vehicles due to a communications error, and a tweet from company founder Elon Musk that Tesla has yet to sign a contract with rental giant Hertz.\n*****\n&gt; Pfizer shares were up 1.8% in premarket trading after the drug maker\u2019s third-quarter profit topped expectations. It also raised its 2021 revenue and EPS outlook.\n*****\n&gt; Shares of materials giant DuPont de Nemours fell nearly 4% after the company said it is buying engineering materials technology maker Rogers Corp for $5.2 billion. DuPont also reported a 33% increase in adjusted third-quarter earnings.\n*****\n&gt; Under Armour shares soared nearly 10% after the athletic retailer hiked its annual outlook.\n*****\n&gt; On Monday, the Dow rose 94.3 points. The S&amp;P 500 rose nearly 0.2%. The Nasdaq Composite added 0.6%. The small-cap Russell 2000 gained 2.7%, its best daily performance since August.\n*****\n&gt; The Fed at the conclusion of its two-day meeting on Wednesday is expected to announce it will begin unwinding its $120 billion in monthly bond purchases implemented during the pandemic.\n*****\n&gt; The October jobs report is on Friday.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe November FOMC meeting, October payrolls ... and a host of earnings updates sets up a catalyst heavy week of trading ahead,\u201d Goldman Sachs\u2019 Chris Hussey said in a note.\n*****\n&gt; Better-than-expected corporate earnings results boosted the U.S. stock averages to finish October at record highs, with the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq posting their best months since November 2020.\n*****\n&gt; As of Monday evening according to FactSet, 55.8% of S&amp;P 500 companies have reported quarterly financial results, with 82% beating earnings estimates.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/mbQdPjs.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/vaORLAk.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/9Rrbjyg.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/uaTjkhx.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/bKWDopV.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n($SQ $PFE $ROKU $MRNA $PINS $ON $DKNG $UBER $APPS $QCOM $CRSR $PENN $SKLZ $PCG $CVS $TRVG $CRNT $ABNB $ATVI $MRO $MELI $DVN $FANG $BP $PTON $CGC $VIAC $AMG $FSLY $UAA $EPD $ET $NET $AKTS $ZG $GNRC $ALX $CNA $TMUS $SKC $RIG)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/HovAdxl.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n($PFE $CRSR $BP $UAA $COP $GNRC $EPD $RACE $EL $MPC $LPX $ARCB $GPN $CTLT $RL $BLMN $MPLX $IDXX $NRZ $CMI $BHC $ZBRA $IT $MGY $ESPR $DD $KKR $APO $ETN $AME $MIME $ADCT $ROK $TECH $INCY $LIND $BCC $SAGE $LGIH $IEP $LEA)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/53VLxUW.jpg)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/LP69zIw.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/IWaFYUR.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/IA1HwBL.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/n7GayLd.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/h4f5OtE.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/ysSbo0i.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/ycH9aVx.png)**)\n\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/zKN9CD3.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/Mm0cU5s.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/M0Y7bN5.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/poUGTRm.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/gE6O83n.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S MOST ACTIVE TRENDING TICKERS ON STOCKTWITS:\n\n* TSLA\n* LRC.X\n* PFE\n* FSR\n* FCEL\n* CRSR\n* CHGG\n* DOT.X\n* VUZI\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/02/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-in-the-premarket-pfizer-under-armour-generac-and-more.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; **Pfizer (PFE)** \u2013 Pfizer jumped 4% in the premarket after the drugmaker reported better-than-expected profit and revenue for the third quarter.
