        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, May 5, 2021**\n\nStocks reversed from yesterday\u2019s technology-led selloff, with the Dow Jones (DIA) reaching a new intraday record high. Continuing the recent bout of volatility, the three major indexes sold off in the last few hours of the market session, with the Nasdaq (QQQ) turning negative.   Market participants continue to look towards the slew of corporate earnings, new economic data, and commentary from key monetary policymakers. \n\nThe sharp move lower in stock yesterday came, ostensibly, after Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen suggested that interest rates may need to rise in the near-term to prevent the economy from overheating, with the recent economic data and corporate earnings showing economic activity recovering much faster than expected as effective distribution of the vaccine in the US allows states to gradually reopen. Yellen said, \u201cIt may be that interest rates will have to rise somewhat to make sure that our economy doesn't overheat, even though the additional spending is relatively small relative to the size of the economy. It could cause some very modest increases in interest rates to get that reallocation, but these are investments our economy needs to be competitive and to be productive. I think our economy will grow faster because of them.\" In later remarks, she added that raising rates was not something she was predicting or recommending and that the decision ultimately rests with the Federal Reserve. She said, \u201cLet me be clear, that\u2019s not something I\u2019m predicting or recommending. If anybody appreciates the independence of the Fed, I think that person is me.\u201d\n\nWith the major indexes hovering near record levels for many consecutive days, equities were due for a pullback at the slightest mention of bad news. Kevin Mahm, chief investment officer at Hennion and Walsh Investment Management said, \u201cI do think there's a potential for a short-term bounce in volatility due to those excessive valuations and all of the uncertainty that currently stands with respect to the infrastructure spending bill, ultimately how it\u2019s going to be funded, and certain taxation policies. But, beyond the short-term bouts of volatility, there is continued reason for optimism, whether it\u2019s consumer confidence, whether it\u2019s the strength in earnings, recognizing that thus far we have an 86% beat rate for the companies that have reported.\u201d\n\nThe Labor Department will release its April jobs report on Friday, which is expected to show a staggering nearly 1 million payrolls came back last month, accelerating March\u2019s gain. As a reminder, in March, the Department of Labor reported nonfarm payrolls increased by 916,000 for the month while the unemployment rate fell to 6% (unemployment rate was 14.6% in April 2020). Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been looking for an increase of 675,000 and an unemployment rate of 6%.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* As a reminder, the April Labor Report will be released on Friday. Will be important in gauging how the labor market is doing\n* Shares of Peloton (PTON) sold off sharply after the company issued a recall of its Tread+ and Tread treadmills following a slew of accidents, including the death of a child. A few weeks ago, John Foley, CEO of Peloton, resisted calls from the US Consumer Product Safety, something he called a \u201cmistake\u201d. He said, \u201cPeloton made a mistake in our initial response to the Consumer Product Safety Commission\u2019s request that we recall the Tread+. We should have engaged more productively with them from the outset. For that, I apologize.\u201d\n* Tomorrow, May 6, EV maker NIO will hold a news conference where the company is expected to talk about its plans to expand to the European markets.\n* Virgin Galactic (SPCE) shares drop after Blue Origin, Jeff Bezos space company, announced plans for first New Shepard suborbital flight in July of this year.

        "selftext": "Hello all,  \n\n\nI have a small stake (50 Shares) in a up and coming Cybersecurity company called Fortinet (FTNT). I nibbled here and there during the March 2020 crisis eventually having a cost basis of approximately 6800 dollars. The shares are now valued at just 10,300, up 55 percent.   \n\n\nI recently re-balanced my portfolio away from re-opening stocks and play and consolidated to an VT index fund (215 shares) , Coinbase (25 Shares), FTNT and Churchill Capital (CCIV - 150 Shares). I have a stable job, ten thousand in savings, no debt other than a car note. The only area I would reinvest the profits would most likley be crypto or CCIV for the Lucid play. I'm curious to hear other's opinion who may be in a similar situation. Thanks.",
