        "selftext": "Institutional ownership in this company went from 1% to almost 8% within a week(because it was a Direct Listing) and looking at the price charts, their average purchase range should be around $13-15.\n\nThis gives a floor for us retail investors and speculators out there. Price is UNLIKELY to go below this floor.\n\nMore institutional ownership is quite probably coming soon. This means money.\n\nARK, Soros sold a stake in JPM(probably, I forgot) to jump in PLTR.\n\nMorgan Stanley raised the price target yet downgraded the stock, I don't know if it\u2019s a dick move from their part to try to buy it at a lower price or maybe I am just over thinking.\n\nLong term considerations:\nThis company is structured in a way in which the founders would gain insane amount of money if this stock prints(KINDA like how Musk benefitted from TSLA stock price)\n\nPlus the total control of the founders(much like lizard man Zuck have over FB) mean shareholders cannot pull any funny business. This is significantly advantageous for PLTR for the business that it is in and the groupthink prevalent among tech workers.\n\nThey still don't have any direct competitor(not that I know of) and will have a revenue of $1B+ whereas their total addressable market size is $120B(somewhere near that ballpark, I read the SEC filings when they IPOed, but forgot the numbers and since they are building more and more products could increase TAM further).\n\nTheir software is infinitely adjustable and boy have you seen their customer retention and horizontal growth rate when they make a company Palantir's customer.\n\nIf you go to their Investors Relations website, you will see the numerous ways they are helping clients. One example, an oil major would save $1B annually for using Palantir's software.\n\nThey have an almost 10+ years head start in the business and the fact that it\u2019s so deeply entrenched with the government means it ain't gonna become bankrupt.\n\nI mean this shit can surpass NFLX or TSLA valuations if Karp's vision and various statements are realised.\n\nAlso remember, Peter Thiel and Alex Karp do not just work for money, they already have had a boatload(literally) of money and for them to stick to a product for nearly 17 years is definitely telling.\n\nThis company probably wouldn\u2019t enter the Chinese market or more likely wouldn\u2019t take any Chinese government contract.\n\nTheir margins are insane(forget NFLX, AAPL, TSLA etc) when their customers enter the scaling phase and their products are sticky as hell.\n\nShort term considerations:\nThere's around 80% shares that COULD be unloaded in the market in the near future in 2021(again I forgot the exact date), surrounding this event, there could be significant price volatility, but we all know no one's mad enough to suddenly sell 80% of the shares.\n\nRegardless, a lot of employees could exercise options constantly that they received as compensations as they didn\u2019t get the chance to do so earlier at a fair price.\n\nThey raised their guidance. And do you know what market loves the most? Raised guidance. That's why even though market sold off by retail profit takers at first then it quickly went back to where it was. Monday could be higher.\n\nThis stock probably hasn\u2019t really discovered its true pricing because of the still low institutional ownership and employees stock options activity.\n\nThe market(by market I mean some journos and analysts) still seems to misunderstand their product and think they are a data mining company, a consultant company, a fancy government contractor for specialist software etc. It is not any of them. I will let you discover yourself what this company is. It's kind of like how some boomer analysts still think a certain company is just a car company.\n\nHow to play this shit?\nI think leaps or outright buying shares(then selling puts to generate income and buy more) is the best way, regardless, this is a matter I don't want to comment too much, I have given you some insight, now you do your own thing.\n\nRemember, this isn\u2019t NIO, it\u2019s a much more bigger fish than that(if they can realise their long term goals).\n\nSome resources for you to dive slightly deep.\n\n[Third quarter earnings presentation(pdf)](https://s26.q4cdn.com/381064750/files/doc_financials/2020/q3/Palantir-Q3-2020-Earnings-Presentation-1.pdf)\n\n[Palantir S-1 Filing(SEC)](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1321655/000119312520230013/d904406ds1.htm)\n\n[STILL low institutional ownership](https://money.cnn.com/quote/shareholders/shareholders.html?symb=PLTR&amp;subView=institutional)",

        "selftext": "Earlier this year, Apple announced a new policy for their IDFA (Identifier for Advertisers) which is basically your unique identifier so ad companies can impact you with ads. \n\nNow, instead of being shared by default, ad companies will need apps to implement permission requests that will ask the following question: \n\n\u201cExample App would like to track you across apps and websites owned by other companies. \nButton 1-&gt; Allow Tracking\nButton 2-&gt;Ask App Not to Track\u201d\n(Sorry, I didn\u2019t manage to post a screenshot)\n\nEarly testing by different companies showed that Allow Tracking gets between 0% and 20% conversion rate. \n\nSo what happens with the rest of users? They don\u2019t share their identifier, and that is a massive deal. Ad companies (like Facebook) are completely blind and can\u2019t offer personalized ads based on behavior and can\u2019t attribute installs (meaning, Facebook doesn\u2019t know if it has provided you with an installation, so how is it going to charge you for the ad?). \n\nThe full scope of the implications excedes my knowledge (and I know a thing or two about this topic), but a whole bunch of technology, revenue models, advertising strategies and a long and unknown etcetera is going to be effectively useless for 58% of the US market in 2021. \n\nLearned a lot from this sub, so I thought it was fair to give you guys this clue.

        "selftext": "December and January aren't typically busy months for initial public stock offerings, but this time around, they'll be an exception. Almost a half dozen well-known tech startups, each already valued privately at over $1 billion, have recently filed for IPOs, including Airbnb, DoorDash, and Roblox.\n\nThey're hoping to take advantage of strong investor appetite for tech stocks, despite the pandemic, and to catch the coat tails of other tech companies that have recently made [successful debuts](https://fortune.com/2020/08/29/2020-ipos-palantir-tech-ipo-asana-snowflake-predictions/). Shares in cloud database company Snowflake are up 129% since its September IPO and those of data mining company Palantir are up 215% since its September listing.\n\nHere are key details to consider in weighing whether to invest in the latest batch of would-be public tech companies. Financial data is from the first nine months of 2020 unless otherwise indicated.\n\n## Affirm\n\nSymbol: AFRM  \nFiscal 2020 revenue: $510 million (fiscal year ended June 30)  \nRevenue growth: 93%  \nGross margin: n/a  \nNet loss: $113 million\n\n[Affirm\u2019s S-1 filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1820953/000110465920126927/tm2026663-4_s1.htm)\n\nFounded in 2012 by PayPal co-founder Max Levchin, Affirm aims to [bring credit and lending to customers of all kinds of online retailers](https://fortune.com/2020/02/05/credit-cards-levchin-affirm-ceo-daily/). Those hard-to-miss layaway offers for a pair of shoes from Cole Haan or that cute coffee table on West Elm\u2019s website? Affirm works behind the scenes to process the loans and often covers the cost of the item (in some cases, partner banks fund the loans). So far, Affirm has signed up over 6,500 retailer and helped consumers pay for almost $11 billion worth of products over the past three years.\n\n**Pros**: Affirm says its \u201cbuy now, pay later\u201d system is superior to credit cards, with no hidden fees or high interest rates (most Affirm offers are zero interest rate). Like other hot consumer companies, Affirm also touts its net promoter score of 78, suggesting more than three-quarters of customers would recommend the company.\u00a0 As e-commerce grows, there\u2019s plenty of room for growth in the market\u2014less than 1% of e-commerce transactions in North America relied on \u201cbuy now pay later\u201d deals. And Affirm says its data analysis of consumers\u2019 ability to pay lets it avoid major losses.\n\n**Cons**: The largest e-commerce sites, like [Amazon](https://fortune.com/company/amazon-com/) and [Walmart](https://fortune.com/company/walmart/), have no need for Affirm and could even launch their own lending services. So could big banks or other financial institutions that can borrow money more cheaply than Affirm can. And more than one-quarter of all of Affirm\u2019s lending has so far come from customers of a single retail partner: Peloton.\n\n## Airbnb\n\nSymbol: ABNB  \nFirst nine months of 2020 revenue: $2.52 billion  \nRevenue growth: -32%  \nGross margin: 74%  \nNet loss: $697 million\n\n[Airbnb\u2019s S-1 filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1559720/000119312520294801/d81668ds1.htm)\n\nAs the now-famous story goes, Airbnb co-founders Brian Chesky and Joe Gebbia decided to rent some airbeds in their San Francisco apartment after a big design conference caused local hotels to be fully booked. Their little web site, AirBedandBreakfast.com, eventually grew into the titan that has rented space to 825 million customers cumulatively across 220 countries.\n\n**Pros**: The fast-growing startup took a huge hit when COVID-19 curbed travel, but has since [almost bounced back](https://fortune.com/2020/06/30/airbnbceo-brian-chesky-bookings-rentals-recovery-2020-ipo-coronavirus-pandemic/). Bookings were down 72% in April compared to the same month in 2019, but for June through September, the declined narrowed to 19% to 23%. The company also brags in its regulatory filing that pandemic-related spending cuts, including slashing headcount by 25%, make it more efficient going forward.\n\n**Cons**: The pandemic showed that the travel industry is subject to sharp downturns that cut into Airbnb\u2019s sales, and infections are on the rise again worldwide. The company has also battled restrictive rules in many cities and countries seeking to ban short-term rentals. Airbnb's filing disclosed it\u2019s also in a battle with the Internal Revenue Service that could cost it $1.4 billion if it loses. And even after being in business for more than a decade, Airbnb is still on pace to lose around $1 billion this year.\n\n## DoorDash\n\nSymbol: DASH  \nFirst nine months of 2020 revenue: $1.92 billion  \nRevenue growth: 226%  \nGross margin: 53%  \nNet loss: $149 million\n\n[DoorDash S-1 filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1792789/000119312520292381/d752207ds1.htm)\n\nAfter moving to the U.S. as a child, DoorDash co-founder and CEO Tony Xu worked as a dishwasher in a Chinese restaurant to help make ends meet.

        "selftext": "# PLTR OVER $30 USD IN EUROPE. FREE TOYS AT THE BOTTOM.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWelp my friends. Like 2 days ago I said if Palantir made it to $30 by the end of the year, I\u2019d give out a PS5 to someone in this subreddit.\n\nWhile a 50% gain over 6 weeks sounded aggressive, turns out things are moving a tad faster around here.\n\nLooks like we are over $30 in Europe. Fuck it. Let\u2019s do this draw now. It\u2019s American Thanksgiving after all.\n\n\\--\n\nBut before I live up to my promise and get into the details of how you enter this draw, I think I would be remiss if I didn\u2019t use this opportunity to get my thoughts in about Palantir.\n\n**First and foremost, will everyone who is calling PLTR a quote \u201cmeme stock\u201d shut the hell up?**\n\nJust because a bunch of gorilla IQ memers happen to be buying something, does not mean that the thing they are buying is stupid. All those dingleberries also own Androids and iPhones, does that doesn\u2019t mean Google and Apple are \u201cmeme companies\u201d? No.\n\nUnlike actual meme stocks such as: unprofitable weed companies, camera companies gone pharma, car rental companies gone bankrupt, and little airlines living off corporate welfare - Palantir is actually a ROCK SOLID COMPANY with an extremely promising future.\n\nThis rally was predictable and **it will keep on going in the long run.**\n\nMyself and many others in WSB, r/investing and r/stocks got in on day one - not out of chance - but because we did our due diligence and we could see the writing on the wall: Palantir has the potential to possibly become one of the most important tech companies in the world, and it is being led by people with a track record to back it up.\n\nThis stock isn\u2019t mooning because we have posted 10,000 memes and shit posts. I'm sorry kiddos and Cramer, but our TikTok videos with a few thousand views aren't powerful enough to create $25B of stock market value.\n\nThere is something much larger at play here, and we in WSB are lucky enough to be along for the ride.\n\nPLTR is heading to Mars because the financial institutions didn\u2019t have the opportunity to get in before the IPO and now they are racing to catch up. Moreover, now that **Palantir\u2019s first quarterly report has proven they are the real deal,** and everyone has started googling this pandora\u2019s box of a company - the market is going \u201choly shit\u201d.\n\nThe only question mark that was in Palantir\u2019s path was the impact Joe Biden\u2019s administration might have on the company's relationship with the US government.\n\nWith a former Palantir consultant Avril Haines at the helm of the entire US intelligence community as of this week, the risk of the new administration working against Palantir has been all but removed.\n\nThat\u2019s why we are up bigly this week.\n\nBut more importantly, **you need to consider the global technological context of this company, to truly understand its future potential.**\n\n1. In the 90\u2019s PC\u2019s took over. \n2. In the 2000\u2019s it was all about the .coms.\n3. The 2010\u2019s was the era of wireless and mobile platforms.\n4. 2020 WILL be the decade of smart automation through a global wifi network.\n\nAnd because of that, there is now an information and technology cold war brewing. China and USA are racing to get control of the global internet infrastructure, and they are doing everything they can to invent true AI. \n\nOnce the entire world and everything in your home goes \u201csmart\u201d and becomes connected to Starlink\u2019s grid, someone or some*thing* is going to need to sift through the quintillions of zeroes and ones, to make sense of it all in real time. Guess who is **the only company in the world that has the know-how and business/political connections to fill that void?**\n\nAt the risk of getting too deep in the weeds here, I need to mention one last detail: You all need to read up on Project Maven.\n\nFor those of you who don't know, Project Maven is an AI drone project that Google was originally supposed to fulfill for the US Airforce. Google walked from the contract citing \"ethical\" concerns, and then Palantir picked up the pieces. Imagine how pissed the US Airforce was when Google called them unethical and embarrassed them?\n\nThis has a **very** important underlying implication. If you accept the premise that the American government is going ham in this technological revolution, there still remains the question as to who will be the primary benefactor. \n\nCommon sense would suggest that companies like Google, Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Microsoft will be working with the US government to create AI. However, Project Maven changed all that. \n\nGoogle's refusal to fulfill their top secret contract taught the government that they cannot trust the trillion dollar megacaps to be unequivocally and unapologetically pro-USA. Those companies are so big, that they don't need to choose a side in geopolitics, and they will almost certainly continue to offer their products to everyone around the world. \n\nWhen it comes to matters of national cybersecurity, the odds are that **the US government is going to put all it's eggs in a company that is unquestionably loyal and patriotic.** When the pentagon is creating a trillion dollar AI behemoth, they know they need to work with someone they can trust when push comes to shove. Palantir is the only AI company that is bold enough to do so, and **their founders have created a special the corporate share structure to ensure they will never lose control**.\n\nSo again, this is not a fucking \"meme stock\".\n\nPLTR is mooning like your pubescent boner on viagra because everyone is starting to realize that this **magnificent titan the CIA created** (*see In-Q-Tel*) has gone public and will probably be at the forefront of the next global technological revolution.\n\nSo: \n\n* Stop worrying about a dip next week. (*Yes it might happen. So what?*)\n* Stop worrying about a price crash post lock up. (*This will happen. But from what price to what price? Who cares?*)\n* Stop trying to time the market to squeeze out an extra $1000. (*We aren\u2019t smart enough or fast enough to win that game.*)\n* Stop viewing Palantir like it\u2019s a penny stock. It\u2019s not.\n\n**Start** looking at the year 2030 and imagine what you will do with your money then, if you grow the man balls (or lady balls) required to hold that long.\n\nHow you handle your positions over the next 6-12 months may be the most important decision of your life: do... not... sell\u2026\n\nThere are only a handful of times in your life when a person should truly go all in. 1) When you meet the person you know you want to marry. When you decide to change your career. And when a company like Palantir goes public.\n\nIn 10 years, you can thank me. Today, I would like to thank you for your time and consideration.\n\nGod speed.\n\n\\--\n\nNow for the fun stuff.\n\n# RULES:\n\n* You must be 18 or older to enter.\n* You must be in a country where you are able to receive shipments from Walmart, Amazon, Bestbuy and/or Gamestop.\n* Your reddit account must be at least 1 week old to claim the prize.\n* There are no financial or trading requirements for this draw.

        "selftext": " December and January aren't typically busy months for initial public stock offerings, but this time around, they'll be an exception. Almost a half dozen well-known tech startups, each already valued privately at over $1 billion, have recently filed for IPOs, including Airbnb, DoorDash, and Roblox.\n\n They're hoping to take advantage of strong investor appetite for tech stocks, despite the pandemic, and to catch the coat tails of other tech companies that have recently made [successful debuts](https://fortune.com/2020/08/29/2020-ipos-palantir-tech-ipo-asana-snowflake-predictions/). Shares in cloud database company Snowflake are up 129% since its September IPO and those of data mining company Palantir are up 215% since its September listing.\n\nHere are key details to consider in weighing whether to invest in the latest batch of would-be public tech companies. Financial data is from the first nine months of 2020 unless otherwise indicated.\n\n## Affirm\n\nSymbol: AFRM  \nFiscal 2020 revenue: $510 million (fiscal year ended June 30)  \nRevenue growth: 93%  \nGross margin: n/a  \nNet loss: $113 million\n\n[Affirm\u2019s S-1 filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1820953/000110465920126927/tm2026663-4_s1.htm)\n\nFounded in 2012 by PayPal co-founder Max Levchin, Affirm aims to [bring credit and lending to customers of all kinds of online retailers](https://fortune.com/2020/02/05/credit-cards-levchin-affirm-ceo-daily/). Those hard-to-miss layaway offers for a pair of shoes from Cole Haan or that cute coffee table on West Elm\u2019s website? Affirm works behind the scenes to process the loans and often covers the cost of the item (in some cases, partner banks fund the loans). So far, Affirm has signed up over 6,500 retailer and helped consumers pay for almost $11 billion worth of products over the past three years.\n\n**Pros**: Affirm says its \u201cbuy now, pay later\u201d system is superior to credit cards, with no hidden fees or high interest rates (most Affirm offers are zero interest rate). Like other hot consumer companies, Affirm also touts its net promoter score of 78, suggesting more than three-quarters of customers would recommend the company.\u00a0 As e-commerce grows, there\u2019s plenty of room for growth in the market\u2014less than 1% of e-commerce transactions in North America relied on \u201cbuy now pay later\u201d deals. And Affirm says its data analysis of consumers\u2019 ability to pay lets it avoid major losses.\n\n**Cons**: The largest e-commerce sites, like [Amazon](https://fortune.com/company/amazon-com/) and [Walmart](https://fortune.com/company/walmart/), have no need for Affirm and could even launch their own lending services. So could big banks or other financial institutions that can borrow money more cheaply than Affirm can. And more than one-quarter of all of Affirm\u2019s lending has so far come from customers of a single retail partner: Peloton.\n\n## Airbnb\n\nSymbol: ABNB  \nFirst nine months of 2020 revenue: $2.52 billion  \nRevenue growth: -32%  \nGross margin: 74%  \nNet loss: $697 million\n\n[Airbnb\u2019s S-1 filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1559720/000119312520294801/d81668ds1.htm)\n\nAs the now-famous story goes, Airbnb co-founders Brian Chesky and Joe Gebbia decided to rent some airbeds in their San Francisco apartment after a big design conference caused local hotels to be fully booked. Their little web site, AirBedandBreakfast.com, eventually grew into the titan that has rented space to 825 million customers cumulatively across 220 countries.\n\n**Pros**: The fast-growing startup took a huge hit when COVID-19 curbed travel, but has since [almost bounced back](https://fortune.com/2020/06/30/airbnbceo-brian-chesky-bookings-rentals-recovery-2020-ipo-coronavirus-pandemic/). Bookings were down 72% in April compared to the same month in 2019, but for June through September, the declined narrowed to 19% to 23%. The company also brags in its regulatory filing that pandemic-related spending cuts, including slashing headcount by 25%, make it more efficient going forward.\n\n**Cons**: The pandemic showed that the travel industry is subject to sharp downturns that cut into Airbnb\u2019s sales, and infections are on the rise again worldwide. The company has also battled restrictive rules in many cities and countries seeking to ban short-term rentals. Airbnb's filing disclosed it\u2019s also in a battle with the Internal Revenue Service that could cost it $1.4 billion if it loses. And even after being in business for more than a decade, Airbnb is still on pace to lose around $1 billion this year.\n\n## DoorDash\n\nSymbol: DASH  \nFirst nine months of 2020 revenue: $1.92 billion  \nRevenue growth: 226%  \nGross margin: 53%  \nNet loss: $149 million\n\n[DoorDash S-1 filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1792789/000119312520292381/d752207ds1.htm)\n\nAfter moving to the U.S. as a child, DoorDash co-founder and CEO Tony Xu worked as a dishwasher in a Chinese restaurant to help make ends meet. The point of DoorDash, he says, is to help strivers and small businesses thrive. Now in business for seven years, DoorDash \u201cdashers\u201d deliver food and other items from almost 400,000 businesses to 18 million consumers per month as of September.\n\n**Pros**: DoorDash is the leading provider of delivery with over twice the market share of runner up Uber Eats as of October 2020. The pandemic has [ignited much faster growth](https://fortune.com/2020/05/25/coronavirus-jobs-food-delivery-doordash/) in food delivery as people avoid going out to eat. Some smaller players have already sold out (DoorDash bought Square\u2019s Caviar service for $410 million last year), but further consolidation could let DoorDash charge more for its services.\n\n**Cons**: Once the pandemic passes, many DoorDash customers [may return to eating](https://fortune.com/2020/11/16/can-doordash-maintain-its-pandemic-boost/) in restaurants. Although California voters approved a measure to continue to classify gig workers like DoorDash\u2019s dashers as independent contractors, other governments still are trying to classify gig workers as employees, which could wreck DoorDash\u2019s business model.\n\n## Roblox\n\nSymbol: RBLX  \nFirst nine months of 2020 revenue: $589 million  \nRevenue growth: 68%  \nGross margin: 74%  \nNet loss: $206 million\n\n[Roblox S-1 filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1315098/000119312520298230/d87104ds1.htm)\n\nMuch more than a video game, Roblox has become a virtual environment for millions of people and companies [to create their own games](https://fortune.com/2019/07/16/roblox-100-million-monthly-active-users/). Co-founders David Baszucki and Erik Cassel went from making software simulations for physics labs to creating Roblox in 2004.

        "selftext": "Back in September 2019, Michael Burry predicted an index fund bubble. Since I invest index funds and write about them with relish, I was intrigued. But I quickly moved on.\n\nThen another headline caught my eye. It was an episode of Odd Lots podcast titled,  [**\u201cWhy Passive Investing Might Be Distorting the Market.\u201d**](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/audio/2020-02-07/why-passive-investing-might-be-distorting-the-market-podcast)   I immediately listened to the episode, featuring investor and fund manager Mike Green. And then I listened again. Considering a lot of my net worth is currently tied up in index funds, I want to understand why some people think index funds are fools\u2019 gold.\n\nSo today, I\u2019m going to play devil\u2019s advocate and talk about both sides of the conversation. Is there an index fund bubble? A market crash around the corner? Or is passive investing still the winning strategy it\u2019s always been?\n\nBelow, you\u2019ll find compelling arguments from investors Mike Green and Michael Burry, who both say there is a bubble. Then I\u2019ll follow up with comments from financial analyst Ben Carlson and portfolio manager Ben Felix, both of whom see no bubble . It\u2019s #TeamMike vs. #TeamBen. I\u2019ll also pull some soundbites from Raoul Pal, a former hedge fund manager who now produces financial videos with a silky British accent. And then I\u2019ll add in my own thoughts at the end.\n\n# Quick reminder: what\u2019s an index fund?\n\nAn index fund owns a wide assortment of assets (e.g. stocks), and owns those assets in proportion to their market share. Uh\u2026that\u2019s a lot of FinSpeak. Let\u2019s break it down.\n\nFor an example, let\u2019s look at an S&amp;P 500 index fund. An S&amp;P 500 index fund would own all of the stocks in the S&amp;P 500. Since Apple and Microsoft each make up about 5% of the S&amp;P 500, this index fund would be comprised of about 5% Apple and 5% Microsoft. But Chipotle would only compose about 0.08% of the index, because it\u2019s 0.08% of the S&amp;P. In this way, the index fund is benchmarked to the S&amp;P, like a shadow that follows all of the body\u2019s movements.\n\nSimilarly, a \u201ctotal stock market fund\u201d would own every stock in the market. There are tons of options in the index fund world.\n\nLet\u2019s get into the arguments that claim indexing is now in a bubble.\n\n# Part I \u2013 Bubble! \u2013 \u201cThe tail is now wagging the dog\u201d\n\nOne of Mike Green\u2019s first points on Odd Lots is this: the original idea behind indexing is that active traders and actively managed funds will dictate how the market behaves, and that a small number of passive investors (e.g. index funds) can simply go along for the ride. The large majority active traders are the dog; the minority passive investors are the tail. The dog does what it wants. The tail only follows.\n\nIf dogs don\u2019t do it for you, I like the boat analogy. Think of actively managed funds and active traders as large cruise liners and passive investors as a small canoe. The cruise liner picks its course. The canoe ropes onto the cruise liner and gets a free ride. The cruise liner doesn\u2019t notice the small canoe\u2019s drag whatsoever; its course is unaffected. This big-small relationship is the original assumption behind passive investing. Market behavior is dictated by the active majority, and the passive minority gets a free ride.\n\nHowever, asserts Green, we now live in a paradigm where active and passive investing are too close in size. Therefore, the fundamental assumption no longer rings true.\n\nMillions of Average Janes and Joes\u2013individual investors\u2013are using index funds to invest huge portions of their income and savings. After all, that\u2019s how many 401(k)s and their non-American equivalents are set up. Green points out how recent U.S. legislation changes are pushing 401(k)s and passive investing even further into the mainstream.\n\nPassive investing is no longer the \u201csmall tail.\u201d It\u2019s no longer the canoe. It\u2019s now a fairly large boat, and the active management cruise liner is impacted by towing such a large passive boat.\n\nThe past 30 years have seen index funds grow and grow. Index fund inflows are the \u201csingle largest transactors in the market by far\u201d Therefore, by definition, they are not passive. Index funds have to be influencing the market. What might this influence look like?\n\n# Passive investing influences the market\n\nLet\u2019s go back to our S&amp;P 500 index fund from before. The S&amp;P 500 went up \\~30% in 2019. Where does this gain come from?\n\nSome of it probably comes from fundamental growth in the S&amp;P companies. They\u2019re doing better! Active investors respond by saying, \u201cIf the company is better, then these stocks are now worth more!\u201d\n\nAlternatively, what happens when millions of individual investors put their retirement savings into S&amp;P 500 index funds? It\u2019s simple supply and demand. Joe and Jane are increasing the demand for S&amp;P stocks, therefore the price will increase.\n\nWhen Joe and Jane were the \u201csmall canoe,\u201d their demand didn\u2019t affect the market. But these passive investors are no longer \u201cjust along for the ride.\u201d They are actively impacting the ride. Last year\u2019s 30% price increase is not based only on fundamental growth. Instead, the Average Janes and Joes are artificially increasing the price of the S&amp;P 500 via their demand for index funds.\n\n# The effects of \u201cindex inclusion\u201d\n\nWhat about \u201cCompany 501;\u201d that is, the first company not in the S&amp;P 500? Well, it does not receive the benefits of being a part of the S&amp;P 500 index funds. It does not receive the demand that occurs from inclusion in that index fund, and this exclusion affects Company 501\u2019s price.\n\nMike Green says that historical data clearly shows this growing impact on asset values\u2013it\u2019s called \u201cindex inclusion.\u201d This is true for all sorts of index funds. They include some stocks, exclude others, and there\u2019s a recognizable delineation between those included and excluded.\n\nGreen says there\u2019s a \u201cdistinct and permanent shift in the valuation and price levels associated with these securities\u201d when they are included or ejected from an index. Companies inside of indices are receiving more attention than they fundamentally deserve. Companies outside of indices, therefore, are getting the cold shoulder. This lack of true valuation is one of the formative factors of a bubble.\n\n# \u201cFire!\u201d in a theater\n\nIn the past 40 years, passive investing has done nothing but grow. But eventually, that growth will end. Individual investors will retire. Withdrawals will take place. What happens when you take the money out?\n\nAt that point, Green states that the artificial inflation of index funds will cease, and quickly turn south. As more retail investors sell, prices will drop. When investors see prices dropping, they\u2019ll get scared and sell more. The vicious cycle will continue\u2013sell, drop, sell more, drop more\u2013into a index fund crash. It\u2019ll be an old-fashioned bank run.\n\nOr, as Nicholas Nassim Taleb has written, \u201cthe market is like a large movie theater with a small door.\u201d If everyone is looking to get out, the only way to do so is to offer the doorman a better price than the other people. Prices will plummet. Pop goes the index fund bubble.\n\n# Is it the British accent?\n\nRaoul Pal looks the part, sounds the part, and produces his videos while sitting in front of monitors chock full of financial data. My bulls\\*\\*\\* detector is whirring to life, but something about that accent is just so factual.\n\nPal\u2019s argument is that baby boomers\u2013through no fault of their own\u2013have been dumping too much money into passive funds (pensions, 401(k)\u2019s, etc). When they start selling en masse\u2013which will happen soon!\u2013then pop goes the index fund bubble.\n\nThere are 76 million baby boomers in the U.S., and their average age is now 65 years old. The wave of retirees is about to crest. And when they start to pull money out for retirement, we will see the large theater/small door issue. Prices will plummet.\n\nBut, says Pal, index funds aren\u2019t the only issue. Boomers will also face issues trying to sell their houses. They\u2019ll have issues trying to sell their material goods. Baby Boomers were such prolific consumers that the economy will be overwrought will all their stuff, and prices everywhere will fall. Growth will cease as markets are flooded with goods. A vicious cycle will ensue.\n\nAnd then \u201cthe doom loop of corporate debt will get ignited.\u201d Oh no, not a doom loop! In short, says Pal, corporations have recently gotten into the habit of:\n\n1. Borrowing money (this is the corporate debt)\n\n2. Buying shares of their own stock\u2014a.k.a \u201cstock buy backs\u201d\n\n3. \u2026which drives the price of their stock higher (P.S. this is an artificial price increase)\n\n4. \u2026which makes the company appear more valuable, and usually lets the biggest stockholders (e.g. the executives) get extra rich\n\nAnd Pal\u2019s right. Corporations have been gluttons for their own stocks in recent years. Just read about Apple\u2019s buyback tactics.\n\nEventually, these corporations will have to pay back their debts. And their artificial valuations will come back to Earth. Stock prices will plummet. Indexes and pension funds will plummet. And Baby Boomers\u2019 selling will cause further pricing drops.\n\nAnd thus, claims Pal, the third Baby Boomer crash will occur. And every good story has the symmetry of threes.\n\n# Problems with Pal\n\nMy core issue with Pal is that he\u2019s as much a story teller as he is fact teller. And therefore, it\u2019s hard to tell if he\u2019s selling olive oil or snake oil.\n\nFor example, this sounds impressive: \u201cThe baby boomers accumulated the greatest concentration of wealth the world has ever seen. And they\u2019ll destroy it too.\u201d Whoa! Rise and fall. The double-edged sword. The boomer giveth, and the boomer taketh away.\n\nPal provides facts to back up his claims. But most of his facts are arguable at best.\n\nThe 2000 Dot Com bubble? It happened because Boomers flooded the stock market with their investments, says Pal. And then \u201ceverything got dashed on the rocks, as those markets collapsed.\u201d\n\nThe Baby Boomers\u2013then age 45 on average\u2013turned to real estate, says Pal. Can you guess what happened next? The 2008 Subprime Mortgage and Financial Crisis! Baby Boomers are so many in number, says Pal, that their sum-total behavior can\u2019t help but create bubbles.\n\nAfter 2000 and 2008, the Boomers were worried about their retirement savings, goes Pal\u2019s argument. So now they\u2019ve got to take risk, and they were forced to do so in the stock market. Well, what\u2019s the easiest way to invest in stocks? Through passive investing! And as we\u2019ve now learned twice\u2013according the Pal\u2013where the Boomer money goes, a bubble will soon follow.\n\nIt\u2019s a nice story. It has symmetry. It has foreshadowing. It\u2019s narrated with a silky British accent.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean it has an iota of truth. Euphoric day-trading of \u201c.com\u201d companies led to the 2000 Dot Com bubble. Passive investing is the exact opposite of that kind of behavior! Perhaps the money is coming from some of the same people, but that\u2019s not evidence for the existence of an index fund bubble. Pal is grasping at straws.\n\n# Michael Burry: Big Short to Big Bubble\n\nMichael Burry is an investor and hedge fund manager who correctly foresaw the 2008 financial crisis, and managed to make a boat-load of money for himself and his customers through his correct prediction. If you\u2019ve seen the movie The Big Short, Michael Burry is played by Christian Bale.\n\nBurry\u2019s argument for an index fund bubble is a less scary than Green\u2019s, and certainly less apocalyptic than Pal\u2019s.\n\nBurry\u2019s claim is that indexing has caused an artificial bubble that\u2019s inflating stocks inside the index, and thus leaving stocks outside the index ripe for the picking. It\u2019s the \u201cindex inclusion\u201d argument again.\n\nBut where Green sees a dangerous bubble, Burry sees more of an opportunity. Ready for another metaphor?\n\nImagine a pair of identical twin basketball all-stars. Everything about them is the same, including their skills. Except that one twin plays college ball for Duke\u2013he\u2019s always on TV\u2013while the other plays for Harvard\u2013a good academic school, but not a basketball Mecca.\n\nThe average basketball fan would be biased towards the Duke player. He\u2019s on a better team, he gets more media coverage, and has more post-season success. The average fan would certainly believe that the Duke twin has better long-term prospects, and therefore would deserve a bigger professional contract.\n\nBut since I built this strawman hypothetical, you and I know the truth! The two twins have the same exact skill set. Therefore, signing the Harvard twin at his lower price would actually be quite the financially efficient move.\n\nMichael Burry\u2019s claim is that this is what\u2019s happening with passive investing. Near-identical companies are being over- or under-valued due to their index inclusion or exclusion.\n\nStocks that are inside of index funds are like the Duke twin\u2013they are being over-valued simply because of where they are. While stocks not in the index are like Harvard twin\u2013they are under-valued, and therefore should be targeted by smart people looking to make more money.\n\nIn my opinion, this is less of a \u201cindex fund bubble\u201d and more of an \u201canti-index opportunity.\u201d\n\nBurry is simply saying, \u201cThere\u2019s an inefficiency here, I\u2019ve discovered it, and I plan on making money off it. P.S.\u2013come invest with me so we can both make money together.\u201d\n\nGood work, Mike! Go exploit that inefficiency!\n\n# Price Discovery is becoming fragile\n\nBurry\u2019s second claim is that price discovery is becoming fragile. \u201cPrice discovery\u201d is a fancy term for \u201cbuyers and sellers determining a price where they\u2019re willing to make a deal.\u201d\n\nThink about Craigslist. Someone wants $200 for a used snowblower. Snow?! Yes, in Rochester it helps to have a snowblower. So, you take a look at the snowblower and counteroffer $150. The owner haggles back to $175\u2026and you have a deal! That\u2019s price discovery.\n\nTypically, stock market price discovery involves many buyers and sellers conducting detailed analyses of a company\u2019s holdings and profits and cash flows\u2013all of the fundamental business metrics.\n\nBut passive investing doesn\u2019t care about those fundamental metrics. Instead, passive investing simply follows the leader. It assumes that others in the market have already done the fundamental research, and that the current price of a stock is \u201cright.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a little bit like saying, \u201cThe last Craigslist used snowblower went for $200, so I\u2019ll buy the next one for $200 sight unseen.\u201d Are you sure you want to trust the last buyer and seller? What if they were dopes? Don\u2019t you want to look at the snowblower and make a decision for yourself?\n\nSince passive investing doesn\u2019t rely on price discovery, Burry argues that prices are now dangerously skewed from what traditional price discovery would suggest. This cannot go on forever, and eventually the prices will snap back to where they fundamentally belong.\n\nOr, you could say, the index fund bubble will pop. This, Burry says, is very similar to how housing and CDO pricing behavior malfunctioned before the 2008 crisis. It will be a painful, painful snap.\n\n# Part II \u2013 The other side: Index funds are fine\n\nWhile I appreciate the logic behind Misters Green and Burry and Pal, there\u2019s plenty of good money still betting on index funds\u2019 future success. Let\u2019s start with [**Ben Carlson**](https://awealthofcommonsense.com/2019/09/debunking-the-silly-passive-is-a-bubble-myth/). . Ben is financial analyst, author and blogger (nice!), and podcast host. I\u2019m a big fan of A Wealth of Common Sense (the blog) and Animal Spirits (the podcast). Thanks for sharing all the good work, Ben.\n\nAnyway, what does Ben have to say about the index fund bubble and passive investing?\n\n# The tail is not wagging the dog.\n\nFirst, let\u2019s get back to dogs and tails and boats. Carlson writes, \u201cIndex funds hold less than 15% of shares in public companies.\u201d While this is a growing number\u2013it was 3.3% in 2002 and 6.8% in 2009\u2013passive investing is neither a majority nor plurality.\n\nIf we combine all exchange traded funds and all mutual funds, that percentage rises to about 35% ownership of all shares. That means that active investors\u2013the dog\u2013own at least 65% of the equity market, and therefore are still wagging the tail. All is well in the dog/boat metaphor universe, says Carlson.\n\n# Bias! Bias! Read all about it!\n\nAnother of Carlson\u2019s arguments is that active investing, by nature, is biased against passive investing. Passive is stealing active\u2019s business share, and now active is biting back.\n\nPassive investing shadows what the active investors are doing. But rather than spending money on research and trades, passive investing keeps expenses\u2013and fees\u2013to a minimum. Passive has all the profits of active investing, but none of the costs: ipso facto, passive investing is better. And the active investors don\u2019t like it! The \u201cindex fund bubble\u201d is their propaganda technique.\n\nBesides, let\u2019s consider any and all claims that passive investing is doing something \u201cwrong.\u201d Logically speaking, anything that passive investing is \u201cdoing wrong\u201d first has to be done by active investors.\n\nYou can\u2019t blame your shadow for flipping you the middle finger\u2013the shadow only copies the source. Similarly, passive investing only copies what active investors are doing. It\u2019s a simple argument in logic.\n\n# The price discovery argument\n\nPrice discovery is a cop-out, says Carlson. There is way more trading occurring today than most times in the stock market\u2019s history. In the book Index Revolution, author Charley Ellis writes that about 95% of all trades today are done by active managers\u2013there\u2019s plenty of opportunity for price discovery. It\u2019s all about trading volume.\n\nThis means that the prices aren\u2019t skewed. The prices aren\u2019t a stretched rubber band, ready to snap back. There\u2019s no index fund bubble, waiting to pop. Instead, the active investors are setting the prices and price discovery is healthy.\n\n# So what\u2019s Michael Burry worried about?\n\nBesides, Carlson says, when else in life do we expect individuals to actively partake in price discovery? Do you haggle with the grocery cashier about the cost of oranges? No! All over our economy, prices are set and individual consumers simply choose to buy, or not. They don\u2019t barter or bargain.\n\nI\u2019m not sure I agree with Ben\u2019s point here. It\u2019s true: we don\u2019t haggle at grocery stores. Instead we\u2019re presented with Hobson\u2019s choice\u2013we either take it, or leave it. If you don\u2019t want to pay $12 for a bag of oranges, you don\u2019t have to.\n\nBut are people thinking about Hobson\u2019s choice when they passively invest in index funds? I don\u2019t think so. I think a lot of people are \u201cblindly\u201d putting their bi-weekly 401(k) contributions into index funds, regardless of the price. There\u2019s not much \u201ctake it, or leave it\u201d going on. It\u2019s just \u201ctake it.\u201d\n\nMy conclusion: index investors might be blindly buying in, but they\u2019re still buying at a price that was intelligently discovered through the fundamental analyses of active investors.\n\n# Ben Felix from YouTube\n\n [**Ben Felix**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wv0pJh8mFk0) is a portfolio manager at PWL Capital, and popular creator of YouTube financial/investment videos.\n\nI really like one of Felix\u2019s foundational arguments against the idea of the bubble. That idea is: assets under management do not set prices; instead, trading sets prices.\n\nSo Green and Burry should not be asking, \u201cHow much money is in indexes?\u201d Instead, the question should be, \u201cHow much trading is done by indexing?\u201d This means that the size of the boats doesn\u2019t matter. In fact, it means the boat metaphor doesn\u2019t really make sense.\n\nSo let\u2019s relate it back to the quote from Charley Ellis: 95% of all trades today are done by active managers. That means that price discovery is dominated by active trading. And it means that there shouldn\u2019t be any bubble driven by price discovery.\n\nBlackrock, another investment management firm, estimates that for every $1 of passive trades, there are $22 of active trades. Again, this points to the same conclusion: there is no issue with price discovery.\n\n# Some ideas from the academics\n\n Felix quotes a couple serious economics papers\u2013one by [**Fama/French**](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=502605), another from [**Palia/Sokolinksi.**](https://www.law.nyu.edu/sites/default/files/Paper_P%26S_Darius.pdf) \n\nFama &amp; French came to the conclusion that it doesn\u2019t take much active investing to create an efficient (i.e. non-bubble) market. Passive investing, they say, is pushing bad active managers out of the market. And those who remain? Only the skilled active managers. It\u2019s survival of the fittest. Culling the weak should only make the market more efficient. More efficient = better price discovery = no bubble.\n\nPalia and Sokolinski have a really interesting theory. In brief, they claim that index funds drive down the cost of short selling, which makes short selling more efficient, and that leads to better price discovery.\n\nThey start with the simple truth that index funds hold onto lots of stocks. And since the supply of stocks is high, index funds can easily lend out those stocks to short sellers (people betting that a stock will go down). The short seller pays the index fund a small fee, which gets passed onto the passive investor in the form of low costs.\n\nHowever, since there are so many index funds out there, the short sellers have many different options of where they borrow stocks from. With high supply comes low prices. They can find their short sources very cheaply. This makes the cost of shorting go down.\n\nAnd thus, conclude Palia and Sokolinski, passive investing is creating a more efficient market for short sellers, and a more efficient market leads to better price discovery.\n\n# Part III \u2013 Home-grown arguments and takeaways\n\nNow that you\u2019ve heard the smart people talk, let me bless you with my pro-index ideas.\n\nFirst, index investing is self-corrective.\n\nTo wit, let\u2019s take another look at Michael Burry\u2019s argument: \u201cpassive investing has an inefficiency in undervaluing non-indexed companies, and I plan on taking advantage of that.\u201d\n\nIf Burry is correct, then more active managers will follow his lead and make their money. And right behind them will be their shadow a.k.a. passive investing. The market is a self-correcting system, where money flows towards the best values. Passive investing simply follows that flow of money.\n\nIf passive gets too influential, then the smart active managers will exploit the problem. Inefficiencies will balance themselves out in the long-term. And passive investing is a long-term technique.\n\nSecond, it\u2019s easy to avoid the pitfalls of index inclusion.\n\nIndex funds don\u2019t have to exclude stocks. Many investment managers (like Fidelity and Vanguard) offer total market index funds. They include high and mighty S&amp;P companies and all of the \u201ccompany 501\u2019s\u201d out there that might be excluded from other index funds.\n\nTherefore\u2013if there is an index inclusion bubble\u2013the total market index funds own both sides of that bubble.\n\nA total market fund would only be exposed to a bubble that includes entire asset classes. For example, one could claim that stocks in their entirety are overvalued, but that commodities are undervalued. Therefore, a total U.S. stock market index fund would still expose you the bad outcomes of bursting bubble!\n\nIf this concerns you, then diversify your index investing via a lazy portfolio. There are indexes that track bond markets, international markets, different sized companies, commodities, REITs, etc. You can spread out your investments across multiple asset classes to reduce your risk.\n\n# Takeaways\n\nGreen and Burry both make good points. Pal tells a nice story. I\u2019m really glad I took some time to understand those ideas. Carlson and Felix support the ideas I\u2019ve always heard: the wisdom of people like Jack Bogle and Burton Malkiel. What actions am I taking after all this conversation?\n\nReading. Lots more reading. I want to learn more about Mike Green, Michael Burry, and their anti-passive compatriots. After all\u2013they did compel me to type up 4000 words of arguments that go against my investing strategy. But I also want to remind myself of the reasons why I started indexing in the first place: Malkiel, Bogle, and people like Ben Carlson and Ben Felix.\n\nBut I will be staying my course, at least for now. I have not been convinced to move away from indexing, or that there\u2019s an index fund bubble. Indexes still float my boat, and I think the bubble argument has more bark than bite. I\u2019m in it for the long run. I do not think hand-picking individual stocks is the way to go.",

        "selftext": " I posted this last week just before ALPP popped 53%.  Also, since I've posted this the CEO said in an interview that they were working with Apple on prototypes.  This is just the beginning of this meteoric rise.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**COPY &amp; PASTE FROM PREVIOUS POST**\n\nAlpine 4 Technologies is expected to complete their merger with Impossible Aerospace on December 10th.\n\n(About Us from their website): \"Impossible Aerospace builds high performance electric aircraft that save lives. Founded in 2016 by former Tesla engineer **Spencer Gore**, the company unveiled its US-1 aircraft in 2018, unique for its long endurance and US origin. The company is backed by Bessemer Venture Partners, Eclipse Venture, and Airbus Ventures.\"\n\nOur Mission\n\n\"We are committed to serving the needs of government agencies, first responders, private security providers, and those working to keep our critical infrastructure working at full potential.\n\nOur team consists of experts in aviation, engineering, advanced imaging and law enforcement and come from some of the most progressive companies in the US including SpaceX, Tesla, NASA, FLIR Systems and Icon Aircraft.\"\n\nCEO and Founder Spencer Gore has an impressive resume:\n\n* Forbes 30 Under 30\n* Tesla Battery Designer\n* NASA Astrophysics Directorate\n* Space X Falcon 9\n\nHe has also surrounded himself with a team of former Tesla, Space X, Boeing, FLIR employees to aid him in his expansion.\n\n[https://impossible.aero/about/](https://impossible.aero/about/)\n\nI've been reading up on comments from UAV pilots, drone racing officials, first responders etc. and it's apparent the primary issue with drones is the limited battery life. Only having an average of 20-30 minute battery life eliminates a wide range of efficient uses for this new technology. IA (Impossible Aerospace) has a drone that can fly for 70-75 minutes...DOUBLE or TRIPLE what competitors can do. Their drones also use FLIR thermal scanning which can be extremely beneficial for..\n\n* fire departments (28,000 in the US): think wildfire prevention as well as assessing buildings at different levels\n* police departments (18,000 in the US): assessing potentially dangerous situations before officers ever arrive.  \n\n   * It's estimated that a mere 70 of these policing counties can afford to have a helicopter. The use of drone and thermal imaging could replicate the benefits of a helicopter at a fraction of the price.\n* military: obvious applications\n\nThey recently completed a $1.5 million dollar deal with the US Army as well. The CEO of Alpine says he is very confident in this experiment of drone usage to procure future contracts.\n\n[https://stockdaymedia.com/alpine-4-technologies-ltd-alpp-and-impossible-aerospace-corporation-ia-announce-that-ia-has-completed-the-final-milestone-of-their-1-5-million-us-air-force-contract/](https://stockdaymedia.com/alpine-4-technologies-ltd-alpp-and-impossible-aerospace-corporation-ia-announce-that-ia-has-completed-the-final-milestone-of-their-1-5-million-us-air-force-contract/)\n\nThere has also been a lot of talk about foreign made drone models/equipment being a threat to national security so a US made drone is of highest priority to the military. If they see an effective use for these drones we could see them expanded across other branches and used more widely $$$$.\n\nFunding:\n\nThey've secured funding from two notable names in my opinion.\n\n1. Bessemer Venture Partners (known for being early investors in LinkedIn, Pinterest, Shopify, Docusign, Skype etc.)\n2. Airbus Ventures (venture arm of Airbus)\n\n[https://www.cbinsights.com/company/impossible-aerospace-corp-funding](https://www.cbinsights.com/company/impossible-aerospace-corp-funding)\n\nAnother interesting thing to look at on another tab at the link above...is the patents. They have 2 patents pending which appear to really lock down the whole \"build from the battery\" concept that IA has developed. If they're able to safeguard this technology it could be huge for future growth.\n\nMOVING FORWARD:\n\nThe company is moving in the direction of commercial drone usage as well. If they're able to retain their competitive edge on flight time and payload, they will be a clear cut choice for the likes of Amazon of other e-commerce platforms to deliver packages from warehouse to doorstep.\n\nI'm having trouble finding the link right now but I've read they recently gained approval to construct buildings and operate in 7 other US states. I'm not entirely positive what this means but I'm sure the expansion is good.\n\nEventually Spencer Gore aims to create passenger electric planes which I know is definitely far in the future...but I feel that if anyone can get it done, it's this team.\n\nAnyways, there's my first real DD post...don't tear me up too bad but let me know your thoughts/comments/concerns.

        "selftext": "&amp;#x200B;\n\n## Palantir Direct Listing\n\nContrary to what many investors think, Palantir did not do an Initial Public Offering, \"IPO,\" when it started trading on the New York Stock Exchange on September 30th, 2020. Instead, it did a Direct Listing.\n\nFirst, here's how an IPO generally works:\n\n&gt;In an IPO, new shares of the company are created, and are underwritten by an intermediary. The underwriter works closely with the company throughout the IPO process, including deciding the initial offer price of the shares, helping with regulatory requirements, buying the available shares from the company and then selling them to investors via their distribution networks.  \nSource: [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/investing/difference-between-ipo-and-direct-listing/)\n\nIn short, Wall Street gets involved. It's very lucrative for it, and it makes most of its money when the stock hits the exchange. It \"buys\" a pile of low-price shares - or gets an allocation - and then profits handsomely when shares are offered to the public.\n\nIn contrast, here's how a Direct Listing works:\n\n&gt;\"...the business sells shares directly to the public without the help of any intermediaries. It does not involve any underwriters or other intermediaries, there are no new shares issued...\"  \nSource: [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/investing/difference-between-ipo-and-direct-listing/)\n\nIn other words, owners sell directly without much Wall Street involvement. Typically, with direct listings, there is no lock-up period. This is important and I promise I'll come back to this since it's a critical point.\n\nI won't get too far into the weeds about how direct listings work because it's distracting and not needed here. Instead, if you're overly interested in why a company might want to do a Direct Listing versus an IPO, then you can spend time reviewing this [Pros and Cons](https://assets.fenwick.com/legacy/FenwickDocuments/The-Pros-and-Cons-of-a-Direct-Listing.pdf) material:\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\nAt this point, we can almost dive into the key question about the PLTR lock-up. However, I want to emphasize that IPOs generally have lock-up periods. Here's how [Andreessen Horowitz explains it](https://a16z.com/2019/07/02/direct-listings/) (skip down to my summary if you wish):\n\n&gt;In a traditional IPO, existing company shareholders agree to a period, typically 180 days from the date of the IPO pricing, where they are restricted from selling, hedging, or distributing shares. While they are not mandated to do so by the SEC, investment banks usually ask for this because it allows for a set period of time for the company's shares to trade and establish a track record. Having a set amount of stock (the float) available for trading theoretically provides more predictability, allowing the stock to stabilize a bit before more share volume comes onto the market. On the other hand, the float in a typical IPO is such a small amount - usually \\~10% of the company's total stock - that this artificial restriction also forces distortions for both investors buying large amounts (who have to build up their position gradually and typically have to wait until after the lock-up expires) as well as for others seeking the stock's true price (not enough volume in the true market of sellers and buyers to determine it).\n\nMy apologies for the wall of text, but there are several important points if you care about PLTR's lock-up, and what it could mean for PLTR's stock price.\n\nHere's a quick summary.\n\n1. There's typically a 180-day lock-up period with IPOs but not direct listings.\n2. This is done to help the market establish a price track record.\n3. Typically about 10% of the entire float is available.\n\nIf you read between the lines, this causes a certain level of scarcity or \"pop!\" when the stock starts trading, which insiders love. Furthermore, this creates a cliff because - in theory - when the lock-up period expires, shares flood the market and prices die off.\n\nWe will come back to IPO lock-up expiration price adjustments in a short while. Before that, please allow me to explain more about how PLTR is not like other direct listings, but instead, it's far more like an IPO for our purposes here.\n\n## Do Not Compare SPOT and WORK to PLTR\n\nBoth Spotify (NYSE:SPOT) and Slack (NYSE:WORK) went public through direct listings. However, to be perfectly clear, SPOT had no lock-up period for employees. Similarly, WORK had no lock-up period.\n\nTherefore, we cannot compare the price action of SPOT or WORK to PLTR in relation to any kind of lock-up period. It's literally impossible as far as I know. Perhaps there is some model we could use, but it would be oddly lubricated by theory, not practice or real-world data.\n\nI'm going to circle back to an earlier point about IPOs, namely that lock-ups are all about liquidity.\n\n&gt;Since the actual float in a typical IPO is too small of an allocation to be a \"full position\" for very large mutual funds with multibillion dollar holdings, it's only when more shares come on the market through releasing the lock-up (the overhang) that these investors can build a larger and more substantial position with more liquidity.  \nSource: Andreessen Horowitz\n\nIn other words, since the float is low, it's hard for whales, elephants and institutional investors to gobble up shares without driving prices up. Therefore, they often wait until the lock-up period is over. They are constrained, but this is also a source of buying power at a later time - a fact that most investors gloss over, but which helps to create a balance in the force after a lock-up.\n\n## Back Door Pressure Release Valve\n\nPLTR really is a different animal. Here's a curveball because it's something most retail investors simply don't know.\n\n&gt;The company is 17 years old, so there may be pent-up demand to sell, although as the company had an active secondary market, anyone desperate to sell could have already unloaded.  \nSource: [The Information](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/palantirs-direct-listing-lockup-the-informations-tech-briefing)\n\nThat's right. Although the company is \"17 years old,\" its employees have had a financial safety valve of sorts through back channels.\n\nFor example, I know from personal and direct experience that EquityZen offered deals to prospective PLTR investors. In fact, I almost took a bite.\n\nIn other words, if you were a PLTR employee, and you wanted cash instead of your PLTR shares, you could have sold out before the direct listing.\n\nTherefore, that's a liquidation opportunity for cash poor employees. More importantly, PLTR had back doors open. Even if only marginal, I feel that helped shake loose the weak hands; price volatility stabilizer.\n\nNow we can shift over into exploring the real skin in the game. Here's where exposure and opportunity get most interesting.\n\n## Typical IPO Lock-Up Expiration Behavior\n\nHow many shares of PLTR are available to trade? [Per MarketWatch](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-palantir-non-ipo-5-things-to-know-about-the-formerly-secretive-software-companys-direct-listing-11601351442):\n\n&gt;For Palantir, though, years of venture-capital investments have created more than enough shares to launch public trading: roughly 1.64 billion, though that grows to 2.17 billion in a fully diluted formula that includes vesting options.\n\nAs I write this, about 497 million shares are outstanding. So, my quick math tells me that about 23% of all shares fully diluted are currently outstanding. About 1.7 billion shares could potentially hit the market after the lock-up.\n\nI indicated above that with an IPO, you'll see 10% of the shares released. Here, with PLTR, we're already seeing over 20% of shares trading. It's over double the typical number of a newly listed company, so keep that in mind as well. Once again, there's less pressure on prices after lock-up.\n\nWith all this as background, [here's how to put this in perspective](https://www.ig.com/en/trading-strategies/what-is-an-ipo-lockup-period-and-how-do-you-trade-it--191018):\n\n&gt;A flood of new shares can come onto the market if the owners of those shares decide to sell. If the share price has soared since the IPO, then early investors may want to reap the rewards by selling some of their investments, or if the price has tanked, then they may look to reduce their exposure. However, it does not mean they will sell either way as they could look to retain shares in the hope of prices heading even higher, or because they believe shares could recover any value lost in the early days as a public company.\n\nFurthermore...\n\n&gt;...if there is a sharp increase in the number of available shares available in a company then this pushes the price of a stock down. It is not unusual to see a stock's share price fall on the first day that the lock-up shares can be traded. In fact, if other investors (not subject to the lock-up period) begin to sell in the days before the lock-up expires, then this is a sign that they expect the share price to fall.\n\nSo, price action alone won't exactly tell us what's going on. Current buyers might sell out of fear, or greed. And insiders might do exactly the same. It comes down to expectations about future prospects for the company since we don't know if selling is profit taking or hedging against the fear of a big loss.\n\n## Insights From Real World Data\n\nIG recently looked at [15 stocks with lock-up periods expiring in October](https://www.ig.com/en/trading-strategies/what-is-an-ipo-lockup-period-and-how-do-you-trade-it--191018). The majority of these stocks saw their prices fall before the lock-up expiration. This is quite logical. Yet, the good news is many stocks saw their prices bounce back three to five days later. A few of them saw no selling pressure at all. In fact, share price immediately went higher once the lock-up expired.\n\nI'll point out that you can expect volatility from traders who are cashing out or just making guesses ahead of time. But, if the company is strong and growing, the price will come back quickly with support. I'm speculating this would be from all those non-insider institutional investors who are finally able to take a bite of the apple.\n\nHere's how to put this together:\n\n* If share prices have skyrocketed since the IPO, some percentage of insiders will want to cash out, or sell some portion of their shares.\n* If share prices have fallen since the IPO, some insiders might want to wait for sunshine so they'll hold.\n* If share prices have fallen since the IPO, some insiders might want to sell to cut their loss.\n\nAlso keep in mind that many insiders have free or very low-cost shares they've been holding for years. That could mean they don't need to sell as much to profit in a big way. Or they might wish to finally sell and move onward.\n\n## What To Do With PLTR\n\nAccording to BusinessWire, [the lock-up period](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200929006146/en/Palantir-Announces-Additional-Update-Regarding-Outstanding-Shares-of-Common-Stock-and-Shares-Permitted-to-Be-Sold-Under-Lock-Up-Agreements):\n\n&gt;\"...is expected to continue until the start of the third trading day following the date of public disclosure of Palantir's financial results for the year ending December 31, 2020 (the 'lock-up period').\"\n\nSo, depending on the exact timing of the reporting of results, traders can start to play with the potential dips and the price stabilization shortly after.\n\nIn theory, investors could short PLTR perhaps 7-10 days before the lock-up expiration. Or, traders could use short-term options - especially puts - to play the downside opportunity. It's unclear if there's enough downside potential to make this work. Then again, even a small dip could magnify profits because of option leverage. Please note that I'm talking here about short-term trades.\n\nLong-term investors who are bullish are probably going to see some kind of dip, but then reasonable price discovery and a lift back into a similar price range.\n\nIn the grand scheme, there's probably not much to worry about as long as PLTR continues to grow like a weed. Small dips could actually be an opportunity to nibble, or back up the truck. Also consider the forces at play. Namely, insiders might be selling thereby increasing downside pressure. But outsiders - such as hedge funds, institutions, and even banks - might be inclined to load up on shares thereby increasing upside pressure. It can go both ways in a tug of war.\n\nHere's yet another thing to consider. If an investor is worried about PLTR's price right now, which is below $20, but waits to invest, there is the potential of a price run to $25 or even $30, or higher. If the price hits $30, but the lock-up expiration drives the price down, will it drop to $28, $25, $22, $20, $18, or much lower? In other words, the future \"lock-up expiration dip\" might still be well above the current price of about $18. In effect, a long investor might be forced to pay way more in an effort to hedge a drop in price caused by the lock-up expiration. Fear and uncertainty *appear* to keep investors safe whereas what could really happen is the opposite. Indeed, the price could run up so high that no dip big enough will ever manifest. It'll be the one that got away.\n\nI'll wrap up by saying that my research currently indicates that PLTR will likely see some downward price pressure from the lock-up expiration. However, I am not convinced the drop in price will be significant enough to warrant a delay in investing for the long term. At the same time, there will almost certainly be an opportunity for traders and speculators to use options to play in short time periods as we get closer to PLTR's lock-up expiration. Therefore, like so many things in life, it ultimately depends on the wants, needs and goals of individual investors to weigh the risks and rewards.\n\nI'm a long-term investor and I'm not worried. In fact, even if there is a rather large dip, it could encourage me to invest more. I'll determine my best path forward based on the growth of PLTR with respect to the value I see. In other words, as a net buyer and PLTR long, the ideal situation would be a huge price drop with a radical increase in growth and profits. I love discounts. But again, to be crystal clear, I don't expect a huge gap like this to appear. That's why I've gone long and continue to use LEAPS to play a long-term, forward game.\n\n\\-From Seeking Alpha's John Rhodes",

The last direct offering dropped the stock's price down significantly which is understandable because they offered the shares at $4. However, it did not take long for the stock's price to sky rocket shortly after big name investors bought up those shares. This is predicted to happen again.

        "selftext": "I posted this a few days ago, but you may have missed it. It has gone up 20% the last two days, but this is a 10 bagger, tons of runway still.\n\nIn South Korea, out of the country's 51.6 million population, 29 million play video games. If the U.S. has the NBA and NFL, South Korea has esports. It's that popular.\n\nThe country's most popular video-game developer is **Gravity (Nasdaq: GRVY)**. And for a few reasons, its shares could jump as much as 10-fold in the coming years...\n\nThe company's revenues have grown an average of 91% a year over the past three years.\n\nNow, the company is introducing four new online games this year...\n\nOne is Ragnarok Origin, which launched in South Korea in July. It immediately became the fourth-top-grossing game in both Google Play and Apple's App Store.\n\nAnother is Ragnarok X: Next Generation, which recently launched in Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macau, and the rest of Southeast Asia.\n\nThat means business is going to dramatically pick up the pace, and then bulldoze right on to record levels in 2021, as these new games fully contribute to the bottom line.\n\n**The Most Undervalued Gaming Stock**\n\nThe words \"gaming stock\" and \"undervalued\" rarely go together.\n\nThat's because most gaming stocks are either, 1) small, unprofitable newcomers hoping to score that one hit game that turns it into an overnight sensation... or 2) large, expensive enterprises like Tencent or Activision Blizzard (ATVI).\n\nGravity has been in the video-gaming business longer than both of these industry giants, though. And in that time, it has managed to build up a franchise potentially worth many times more than what investors are valuing the company at today.\n\nThe result is a company much cheaper than its competitors... and honestly, much cheaper than it ever should be, given its growth potential.\n\nGravity is cheaper on a price-to-earnings (P/E) basis than any of the top four video-game companies.\n\nThe games already in the market are topping the charts in Google Play and the Apple App Store. And because this is a successful, long-running franchise, odds are heavily in its favor of sustaining that level of growth in the coming year.\n\nMoreover, Gravity is doing this in the world's fastest-growing video-gaming market \u2013 Southeast Asia... where gaming is more than doubling the rate of growth in the rest of the world.\n\nWhile global gaming revenues grew 5% in 2019, Southeast Asia witnessed a 16% jump. And Gravity is deeply entrenched in these emerging markets... the Next Chinas of the 21st century.\n\nRight now, with a market cap of just $900 million, Gravity is an unpolished gem just waiting to be noticed by investors. It just hasn't yet had its time to shine.\n\nJust as an example, NetEase \u2013 a major Chinese gaming company \u2013 is worth $65 billion alone today.\n\nWhen you consider that NetEase started out as a sub-$500 million company when it first listed in the U.S., 10x is not only possible but likely.

        "selftext": "**Biden wins the election, what does this mean for the economy and the stock market, what Buffen\u2019s Berkshire has done in the last quarter and more, let\u2019s talk about everything** \n\nHey everyone and welcome, I am going to react to the latest news from the election, the economy and in the stock market from last week and what to expect next\n\nSo late Saturday the victory of Biden was announced as networks finally started to predict that he won the election. I have no partisan view as i am not a resident or citizen of the US, but i believe that the results of this election (the Biden win and the Republicans keeping the Senate) is the best the stock market could have hoped for, as many experts were predicting a Blue Sweep. There still will be two important runoff elections in Georgia at the beggining of 2021, where the Democrats could still end up winning the Senate. Biden currently has a projected 290 electoras votes but i believe he will also keep the lead in Georgia and end up with 306 electoral votes, the same number as Trump had 4 years ago [VOTE MAP](https://ibb.co/LZ5dnzt) . Important leaders like the German Chancellor, Uk\u2019s prime minister, Canada\u2019s prime minister, France\u2019s president and many more welcomed and congratuled the win of Biden, which seems to be favored internationaly by the world leaders as they were tired of the whipsaw that came with Trump tweeting non-stop. So this probable grid-lock in Congress is loved by the stock market, as there are no iminent tax raises and a stimulus bill is far more likely if not by the end of the Trump mandate surely at the very start of Biden\u2019s.\n\nSo this scenario that is playing out seems to be the most profitable one for wall street as the average annual return since 1933 is about 14% with a Democractic President and a split Congress [Historical CHART](https://ibb.co/SJGP97P)\n\nYesterday Biden also announced how they will try to combat the illness with Better testing and tracing, a increase in PPE production, National guidance for schools, business and families, Investments of 25 bilion in vaccine development and distribution and mask mandates. While also trying to make the higher risk individuals more safe.\n\nP.S. Here\u2019s a funny meme that LeBron James posted with a throwback to his big block of an opponent. [MEME](https://ibb.co/2hmQk6R)\n\nSo all 3 big indices had the best week since early April with the Nasdaq composite being up just over 9% [NASDAQ CHART](https://ibb.co/rpgWtJH), the SP500 was up 7,32% [S&amp;P CHART](https://ibb.co/Ss7FWVN) and the DOW gained almost 7%.[DOW CHART](https://ibb.co/j3bB0P8) The Nasdaq and Sp were flat for the day, pairing loses from the begining of the day while the down fell 0,23% mostly based on profit taking in my opinion.\n\nThere were more companies that were declining on Friday with over 60% of the companies in the red but with a disproportional number of almost 90% of new highs while the volume fell again way below average [MARKET CHART](https://ibb.co/k0kY7Z1) . There weren\u2019t any significant leaders in the market on Friday but energy traield again being more than 2% down [SECTOR CHART](https://ibb.co/VDFksR8) while small caps under-performed the market especialy the value plays.  [CHART](https://ibb.co/9ndqFLC)\n\nThe fear in the market seems to have completly gone away as we have seen another 10% decline in the VIX indicator to drop below 25. [VIX CHART](https://ibb.co/8MjSd1f)\n\nHere is a heat map of Friday, you can see this was quite a slow day, not to many green companies but not that big of a red day either. [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/nsCvwVz)\n\nThe US economy added more than 638 thousand jobs [NEWS](https://ibb.co/hDrrTXs) more than 503 thousand that were expected [CHART](https://ibb.co/C6fD3Sh), while the unemployment rate fell to 6,9% way better than the 7,7% expected this is the sixt straight month of jobs recovery.[CHART](https://ibb.co/RBZzdVG) As they seem to be in a big V shape recovery, overall  [V- SHAPE](https://ibb.co/HN6n9dH)\n\nThe market should now turn they\u2019re attention to the samshing of the earnings season amid the election with 2 thirds of the SP500 beating the estimates both the top and bottom line, that is almost double the 38% historical average. \n\nBank of American release a chart for q3 earnings and as you can see earnings have increased 6,7% in the SP500 year over year and 21,5% quarter over quarter. [EARNINGS CHART](https://ibb.co/C6zfWZR)\n\nAnd as the fed announced that it will keep the benchmark rate between 0 and 0,25% [FED NEWS](https://ibb.co/vjNy43D)this continues to stimulate the economy of the US, with the fed beeing probably more responsible for the recovery in the last months as stimulus has been staled in congress. Also they continue to have a target of a running inflation of 2% and will continue to buy assests worth around 120 billion dollars montly to pump money in the economy  [FED NEWS](https://ibb.co/wBxn56S). If a stimulus bill will eventualy pass, households will probably continue to use the money the same way as last time with over 70% of the money being used for savings and debt payments. But thay may go down a little as people may tend to spend a little more on essentials and non essentials with a better outlook in the near future than last time. [HOUSEHOLD SPENDING](https://ibb.co/dbbKCj6)\n\nHere are some interesting economic events for next weeks as we continue to closely watch how to recovery is going. [CALENDAR](https://ibb.co/gMX5XH5)\n\nNvidia saw a pop in the stock finally as they announced that Fornite will join the GeForce gaming cliud, that could mean a return for the game in ios devices with GeForce currently available on Mac,Windows,Android and Chromebooks. The company has almost reteurn to it all time highs after this weeks strong gains. [NVIDIA CHART](https://ibb.co/1qxmphB)\n\nBuffets Berkshire announced on Saturday that they bought back around 9 billion of the company\u2019s stock,bringing the total to around 16 bilion for the year so far.[BUYBACK CHART](https://ibb.co/ysw5bkx) That was around 4 billion more than in the second quarter. the operating earnings also decrease a little since last quarter and are almost 3 billion or 32% less then last year. [BUYBACK NEWS](https://ibb.co/fSWCvdQ)The only segment that improved since last year was Railroad,utilities and enegery, while insurance was the biggest loser.\n\nThe company has almost the same amount of cash and short term investemtns like the previos quarter at around 146 billion dollars with 70% of the investments concentrated in 4 big companies (Apple , Bank of America, Coca-Cola and American Express) up from the 60% these company represented at the end of 2019. [INVESTMENTS](https://ibb.co/Dps2f95)\n\nThe buybacks of the company exced any full year amount in Berkhsire\u2019s history and far exeded the analysts expectation of around 3,2 billion in buybacks. As the strategy for Buffet and Charlie Munger is to buyback the company\u2019s stock as long as they believe it\u2019s undervalued and they will still have ample cash after the buybacks. AS the only other major investments made last quarter were about 6 billion invested in the five big Japenese trading houses and the data storage company Snowflake.\n\nI just saw some interesting news as NetFlix announced they will launch a offering named NetFlix Direct in France that will come with a linear feed of content from Netflix\u2019s library, so the company that is the biggest reasons for the decline of old TV programming made quite a twist as they seek to expand more and more.  [NETFLIX NEWS](https://ibb.co/gWzmKKs)\n\nHere is a list with some of the most important earnings next week, some companies that i like that are reporting are: McDonalds, Datadog, Tencent, Corsair, Purple, Lemonade and DraftKings. [EARNINGS NEXT WEEKS](https://ibb.co/JFKh6kN)\n\nThank you everyone for reading!  Be sure to leave a comment down below!\n\nHave a great day and see you next time!",

This is my **$347K bet** on the next EV company to blow up. In fact, its the only American EV company (besides TSLA) that's worth investing in. \\*\\*Flame suit on\\*\\* These are the reasons why this [Bangbus EV](https://i.imgur.com/2kzVCux.jpg) will absolutely dominate.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**$18/$25/$30** **price targets for management to get paid** \\- From the [recent SEC filings](https://imgur.com/gallery/OY7LYMl), management will unlock their shares at those price targets.

With the common's $30 price target, warrants would be worth $18.50 (**10-baggers with no theta burn**). With my combination of commons and warrants (positions below), at $30, this play would be worth **$1.5mm**. If you sat out on the other EV plays, don't miss out on this one.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis company **made more money this year than FSR, WKHS, RIDE and NKLA, combined**. Unlike any other EV SPAC, this company is already making money as they have engineering contracts with Hyundai and [earning $34mm this year, and $120mm next year](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1750153/000121390020022608/ex99-2_051.jpg) (+258%). This revenue both validates their product, and is a solid revenue stream prior to releasing their vehicles.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Miles ahead of all EV competition** \\- This company has built 13 driving prototypes and **completed 50+ crash tests**. [Fisker and Lordstown have built one prototype each](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1750153/000121390020022608/ex99-2_064.jpg), and have completed zero crash tests. This is the only company that's on-track to deliver vehicles on-time (2022). They've also engineered their own [skateboard platform](https://www.reddit.com/r/SPACs/comments/jxk3rm/canoo_unseen_video/) completely in-house (unlike others who are relying on their manufacturing partners). In fact, they've built their platform in a record breaking 19 months, and the platform alone is worth over a billion dollars (cost for someone else to develop it). You can see the skateboard being thrown around like how your wife's boyfriend does to her in this [inspiring video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8m3fRujSlW0&amp;ab_channel=Canoo). They're **engineers first (like Tesla)**, not dreamer designers coming up with a sketch and wanting someone else to build it \\*\\*cough\\*\\* Nikola/Fisker \\*\\*cough\\*\\*. The amazing thing with the modular skateboard is that any type of body can be quickly and cheaply adapted to it (e.g. bus/van, SUV, car, truck, parcel delivery van and etc) like [these](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1750153/000121390020022608/ex99-2_020.jpg) and [these](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1750153/000121390020022608/ex99-2_059.jpg).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Ridiculously low bar** \\- Other companies have created unrealistic projections which will become their ultimate demise. Fisker ($17) plans to sell 250K units in 2025, when his last company sold a measly 2500 units before shuttering in a year.  **Yes he plans to sell 100x his last failed company,** *because it's different this time*. This company set a low bar of projecting a paltry 10K units on it's first year to hit its price targets. **They've already hit 10K members on the waitlist in California alone.** This company **under-promises and over-delivers**. I'd much rather invest in a company with management I can trust, rather than another Trevor Milton-like hype man.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Synthetic QS play ($20)** \\- For those who couldn't get into QuantumScape/KCAC in time, the [Director of Battery Systems of QuantumScape](https://www.linkedin.com/in/phillip-weicker-p-e-a9998a2/) (you know, what the company is known for), **left to co-found this company**.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Synthetic ARVL play ($17)** \\- For those who couldn't get into Arrival/CIIC, Hyundai invested in **both** Arrival and this company. Hyundai first announced it's investment in Arrival in January, yet, it still invested in this company just a month later in February. Why else would Hyundai invest in this company so soon after already investing in Arrival, unless it believes this company will be a winner? \ud83e\udd14\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Workhorse killer ($25)** \\- From last week's Barclay's presentation, this company will officially unveil the parcel delivery vehicle next month. [This company's EV](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1750153/000121390020022608/ex99-2_032.jpg) has the wheelbase/footprint and nimbleness of a Class 1 vehicle (e.g. Ford Transit Connect), but the cargo capacity of a Class 2 vehicle (e.g. Mercedes Sprinter). This company's EV would be the best solution for a parcel delivery vehicle in cities where it's difficult to navigate/park and you'd want a compact vehicle, but also need large volume to haul a lot of packages.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Turo/Hertz/U-Haul alternative** \\- In this [presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7tXveBvnt4&amp;ab_channel=fullychargedshow) (5:00 mark), the Chief Product Officer indicated that the app would determine when the vehicle is not being used and **would allow (with your permission) sub-leasing/sub-subscription of the vehicle. This is HUGE.** Imagine having a money printer on your driveway. The vehicle is built around sharing/subscription (e.g. [Phone as Key](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201103005663/en/Kudelski-IoT-Enables-Secure-%E2%80%9CPhone-as-Key%E2%80%9D-Solution-for-Management-of-Shared-Vehicle-Access)) and it would be extremely difficult for other manufacturers to implement this in their current line-up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**I'M rEtArDeD aNd DoN't uNdErStAnD sUbScRiPtIoNs** \\- This company plans to offer these vehicles as a subscription only. The **subscription is simply the evolution of a lease**. A subscription includes the lease, insurance, maintenance, DMV bullshit and etc all in one monthly flat-fee. The new vehicle lease market is huge, considering there are **4 million new vehicle leases a year**. The subscription is ingenious because similar to any other asset-backed security, this company can easily securitize the recurring subscription cash flow and essentially *sell* the vehicles to investors, clearing up capital from their balance sheet. Rather than a one-time vehicle sale, the subscription model earns [4x the revenue as opposed to just selling it](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1750153/000121390020022608/ex99-2_045.jpg). Furthermore, the subscription model generates consistent cash flow and more resilient than one-time vehicle sales. Imagine if the market saw this company as a subscription company like Netflix and it got their 78x P/E, it would have a $26B market cap in 2022, $65B market cap in 2023, $111B market cap in 2024, $182B market cap in 2025 and **$321B market cap in 2026**.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Subscriptions make sense for Uber/Lyft drivers** \\- In my area, [leasing an Uber vehicle](https://www.uber.com/us/en/drive/vehicle-solutions/) is $150/week (standard) or [$229/week (premium, like this EV)](https://imgur.com/gallery/hQbo72a). $229 x 52 weeks / 12 months = $992/month. At $600/month including the insurance, maintenance, charging credits and so on, this is a NO BRAINER for Uber/Lyft drivers and will be wildly popular. Furthermore, the $229/week vehicle only has 5-seatbelts, whereas this has 7-seatbelts, so one could fetch the UberXL fares (+37% more over UberX) while paying the same amount per month *or less* for a better vehicle. I'm confident there will be a partnership announcement with either Uber or Lyft soon, especially since [Uber pledged to transition to 100% by 2020](https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/8/21427196/uber-promise-100-percent-electric-vehicle-ev-2030). I'm betting on the side of Uber, since there's deep connections to them like [this person](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lucy-ross-863306bb/) and [this person](https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-evans-69383b98/). This was even featured in the [Lido music video as a robotaxi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6m4kDMfNqg).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**ThIs CaR iS uGlY** \\- Yeah, tell that to [SOLO](https://i2.wp.com/electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/05/solo-header2.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=82&amp;strip=all&amp;ssl=1) investors and their single-seater death traps. New EV SUVs are in an overcrowded market. Why would you wait years for the Fisker Ocean, when you can already get a Tesla Model Y today? Every legacy manufacturer will be releasing an EV SUV soon, along with NIO's ES8 and Xpeng's G3. **The bangbus carves a niche in the market, where no-one has yet to go.** They're also making dope wraps to go with the car like [this collab with JGOLDCROWN](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80VvvIbVU00&amp;ab_channel=Canoo) as well as the [design company Off-White^(TM)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SPACs/comments/jxr338/canoo_x_off_white_confirmed/). Jay Leno, a car guy who can sniff out bullshit, [met with the folks from this company](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FIViMSeigM&amp;ab_channel=JayLeno%27sGarage). It's what made me invest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Steer-by-wire** \\- This is the first company to use steer-by-wire. Check out [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8m3fRujSlW0&amp;ab_channel=Canoo) (0:23 mark) where they have the steering column in different locations. This means that it would be easy to adapt this vehicle to both left-hand-drive and right-hand-drive and opening to a global market. Most vehicles (especially ICE) it's difficult to convert because the steering rack needs to move over, which could interfere with other components under the hood. The HVAC in the vehicle would also need to be re-engineered. However, the HVAC in this EV is built right into the skateboard that's shared among all the platforms, making it very easy to adapt to new body styles.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Speculative Apple acquisition** \\- Everyone knows about Apple's Project Titan EV car. This vehicle centers the driver around their phone, ***commence*** ***the Apple salivation***. Rather than one-time hardware purchases, Apple has been pushing recurring subscription cash flow like Apple TV+, Apple Music, Apple News+ and etc, and this company's revenue model is exactly what Apple wants. This company is also located in California, and logistically the best company to acquire. It also doesn't have a retarded egotistical CEO. In fact, the CEO, Dr. Kranz, led BMW's EV division to [build gorgeous cars like this.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/nargessbanks/2018/08/20/bmw-i8-roadster/?sh=27768ba31932) He also looks like [Doc Brown from Back to the Future](https://imgur.com/gallery/9X7k6av), so that's hella meme worthy. You see that big ass head? You know he's got big brains in it.\n\nAlso, here's some rumblings about the Apple Car-\n\n&gt;*the Apple Car could come in the form of an electric van.* *Apple\u2019s engineers have designed specimens with black and silver paint, designed in the typical industrial design of the iPhone group.* *Apple also researches on its own batteries, electric motors, special seats and interior components.*\n\nNow look at the [Apple's EV rendering and this company's EV](https://imgur.com/gallery/qgMkjLP). **I'll eat my dick on national television if you find another EV closer to Apple's than this company's.**[https://imgur.com/gallery/qgMkjLP](https://imgur.com/gallery/qgMkjLP)\n\n**Positions**\n\n**HCAC** \\- 26,000 shares @ $10.57 =&gt; $30 | $275K =&gt; $780K\n\n**HCACW** \\- 40,000 warrants @ $1.75 =&gt; $18.50 ($30 - $11.50) | $70K =&gt; $740K\n\n[Proof here](https://imgur.com/gallery/aurHRXq), sorry it's not Robinhood so fellow autists might not be able to read it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TLDR: If you made it this far without clicking a single link, buy Canoo (HCAC/HCACW).**",

        "selftext": "&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn South Korea, out of the country's 51.6 million population, 29 million play video games. If the U.S. has the NBA and NFL, South Korea has esports. It's that popular.\n\nThe country's most popular video-game developer is **Gravity (Nasdaq: GRVY)**. And for a few reasons, its shares could jump as much as 10-fold in the coming years...\n\nThe company's revenues have grown an average of 91% a year over the past three years.\n\nNow, the company is introducing four new online games this year...\n\nOne is Ragnarok Origin, which launched in South Korea in July. It immediately became the fourth-top-grossing game in both Google Play and Apple's App Store.\n\nAnother is Ragnarok X: Next Generation, which is launching in Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macau, and the rest of Southeast Asia in the second half of 2020.\n\nThat means business is going to dramatically pick up the pace, and then bulldoze right on to record levels in 2021, as these new games fully contribute to the bottom line.\n\n**The Most Undervalued Gaming Stock**\n\nThe words \"gaming stock\" and \"undervalued\" rarely go together.\n\nThat's because most gaming stocks are either, 1) small, unprofitable newcomers hoping to score that one hit game that turns it into an overnight sensation... or 2) large, expensive enterprises like Tencent or Activision Blizzard (ATVI).\n\nGravity has been in the video-gaming business longer than both of these industry giants, though. And in that time, it has managed to build up a franchise potentially worth many times more than what investors are valuing the company at today.\n\nThe result is a company much cheaper than its competitors... and honestly, much cheaper than it ever should be, given its growth potential.\n\nGravity is cheaper on a price-to-earnings (P/E) basis than any of the top four video-game companies.  \n\nThe games already in the market are topping the charts in Google Play and the Apple App Store. And because this is a successful, long-running franchise, odds are heavily in its favor of sustaining that level of growth in the coming year.\n\nMoreover, Gravity is doing this in the world's fastest-growing video-gaming market \u2013 Southeast Asia... where gaming is more than doubling the rate of growth in the rest of the world.\n\nWhile global gaming revenues grew 5% in 2019, Southeast Asia witnessed a 16% jump. And Gravity is deeply entrenched in these emerging markets... the Next Chinas of the 21st century.\n\nRight now, with a market cap of just $900 million, Gravity is an unpolished gem just waiting to be noticed by investors. It just hasn't yet had its time to shine.\n\nJust as an example, NetEase \u2013 a major Chinese gaming company \u2013 is worth $65 billion alone today.\n\nWhen you consider that NetEase started out as a sub-$500 million company when it first listed in the U.S., 10x is not only possible but likely.

        "selftext": "So, I\u2019m quite new to investing, but I think that I have a pretty solid-ish level of knowledge in this already. I\u2019m probably going to delete this, since this is pretty dumb, but let\u2019s get in to it...\n\nAlright. My latest post discussed about what are people\u2019s reasons why they are invested in the big-shot stocks like Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Google etc. OR should I say those people who are in it for the long run, why do you think they\u2019ll grow even more? \n\nI know, that many people didn\u2019t comment on it, but I was still somewhat surprised that people weren\u2019t THAT Apple friendly. Sure, people weren\u2019t disliking Apple, but they weren\u2019t that optimistic about it, which made me a bit uncertain about it. Don\u2019t get me wrong I think Microsoft &amp; the others (Amazon and Google) might have a bit more potential/room to grow than Apple, but they (Apple) aren\u2019t gonna dissappear, are they? \n\nBut I get it, the biggest companies change all the time etc, etc. But Apple is still like a good investment right? Have I just overreacted or some sort? My original plans where that $MSFT and $AAPL would hold a decent amount in my portfolio. That\u2019s still a good strategy, IF I diversify in other areas and I\u2019m not going to change these plans based on other people\u2019s opinions, BUT I shouldn\u2019t get too sentimental about it, which I mean by you should NEVER get attached to any stocks. If Apple starts to go south as a company then of course I\u2019ll get rid.\n\nMy point is: Apple is a good investment, which you can trust in, isn\u2019t it?\n\nThanks in advance.",

I never checked my portfolio, cause people told me checking would cause stress.  So I just didn't check for weeks but I found in real life I was a lot more uptight, getting more angry at people for no reason, irrational moods of despair or sadness.  Constantly worrying if I was losing money.  I couldn't advance in my career or even grow in my personal life because I felt like I was trapped in a prison and stuck to my portfolio.  5 months later I said screw it, and just sold everything.  And it was almost immediately that I felt like a normal human being again.  Happier, more free and motivated to do things in life.  How do people do this without feeling messed up?",

        "selftext": "Dell has earnings on the morning of Tuesday November 24th. Dell is a computer manufacturer along with other technology such as projectors, notebooks, printers, and headphones. You know what this means, at home working. Along with this part of business, it has a CLOUD portion. Yes this boomer stonk has a cloud business by the name of VMW. This allows them not only to sell computers but have a steady cloud business. VMW ware has shown consistent growth, with an average of 12ish % yoy. Cloud has obvious boomed during Covid-19, so you can assume VMW will have great returns this earnings. In addition for VMW, it has partnered with NVDA to make AI chips better.\n\n[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/vmware-nvidia-partner-ai-chips-120728435.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/vmware-nvidia-partner-ai-chips-120728435.html)\n\nNow the PC  sales will be fantastic as shown CSCO, LOGI, and Target. If you did not know all of these companies massively beat earnings. All of them sell computers, headphones, etc. Target is a massive provider for Dell's computers. \n\nNow I know some people will say Dell = Apple! It will miss!\n\nBut, Dell does not sell Iphones and laptops just for money. In addition, Dell is cheaper than Apple. Why would you spend 2k for a new laptop when you have a old one? With Dell, laptops can be under 1000 dollars, and people would want to upgrade for better ones/\n\nThey have a 3 sections.\n\nVMW and computer which I covered but they have storage portion too.\n\nI believe that because school came back, many people brought Dell computers and products for stay-at-home. In addition to VMW and storage revenue. Dell's earnings estimates have barely moved since Q2 and it provides for a great beat.\n\n[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pc-sales-continue-benefiting-covid-102110153.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pc-sales-continue-benefiting-covid-102110153.html)\n\nAlso NVDA and AMD's new CPU's and GPU's are in Dell's products. If you wanted a new rtx 3070 or rtx 3080, or rtx 3090, you can buy it in a Dell PC. If you just look at AMD's and NVDA's sales you can tell there is great demand for their chips.\n\nNow onto technicals, Dell broke their march uptrend line but has bounced off the lows and created a new uptrend. It is just below ATH which it failed to break 3 months ago. If earnings beats, it could fucking moon 10% or more. Keep in mind that Dell has gone up on past 3-4 earnings.\n\nNow Dell's IV is low , with just 47%. So you will not get IV crushed that badly. Also, it is not a volatile stock, and max moves down are rarely greater than 4%\n\nAlso there has been lots of buying for Dell calls, on Friday 1750 12/18c were traded\n\nYou want links? here you go\n\n[https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/8/21508481/alienware-rtx-3080-3090-aurora-r11-r10-area-51-monitor-360hz](https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/8/21508481/alienware-rtx-3080-3090-aurora-r11-r10-area-51-monitor-360hz)\n\n[https://www.forbes.com/sites/barrycollins/2020/07/10/pc-sales-surge-during-coronavirus-crisisand-hps-the-big-winner/?sh=654c20455227](https://www.forbes.com/sites/barrycollins/2020/07/10/pc-sales-surge-during-coronavirus-crisisand-hps-the-big-winner/?sh=654c20455227)\n\n[https://gadgets.ndtv.com/laptops/news/pc-sales-climb-as-covid-19-pandemic-keeps-consumers-at-home-idc-gartner-2261022](https://gadgets.ndtv.com/laptops/news/pc-sales-climb-as-covid-19-pandemic-keeps-consumers-at-home-idc-gartner-2261022)\n\n[https://www.marketwatch.com/story/target-earnings-beat-expectations-11605699139#:\\~:text=Target%20reported%20TKTK&amp;text=Revenue%20of%20%2422.63%20billion%20was,FactSet%20consensus%20of%20%2420.77%20billion.&amp;text=Comparable%20sales%20jumped%2020.7%25%20with,sales%20were%20filled%20by%20stores](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/target-earnings-beat-expectations-11605699139#:~:text=Target%20reported%20TKTK&amp;text=Revenue%20of%20%2422.63%20billion%20was,FactSet%20consensus%20of%20%2420.77%20billion.&amp;text=Comparable%20sales%20jumped%2020.7%25%20with,sales%20were%20filled%20by%20stores).\n\nTLDR: Buy Dell because it's fucking mooning.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n12/18 68c and 12/18 70c",

Full article below: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt is now more than 20 years since the Nasdaq, an index of technology shares, crashed after a spectacular rise during the late 1990s. The peak in March 2000 marked the end of the internet bubble. The bust that followed was a vindication of the stringent valuation methods pioneered in the 1930s by Benjamin Graham, the father of \u201cvalue\u201d investing, and popularised by Warren Buffett. For this school, value means a low price relative to recent profits or the accounting (\u201cbook\u201d) value of assets. Sober method and rigour were not features of the dotcom era. Analysts used vaguer measures, such as \u201ceyeballs\u201d or \u201cengagement\u201d. If that was too much effort, they simply talked up \u201cthe opportunity\u201d.\n\nPlenty of people sense a replay of the dotcom madness today. For much of the past decade a boom in America\u2019s stockmarket has been powered by an elite of technology (or technology-enabled) shares, including Apple, Alphabet, Facebook, Microsoft and Amazon. The value stocks favoured by disciples of Graham have generally languished. But change may be afoot. In the past week or so, fortunes have reversed. Technology stocks have sold off. Value stocks have rallied, as prospects for a coronavirus vaccine raise hopes of a quick return to a normal economy. This might be the start of a long-heralded rotation from overpriced tech to far cheaper cyclicals\u2014stocks that do well in a strong economy. Perhaps value is back.\n\nThis would be comforting. It would validate a particular approach to valuing companies that has been relied upon for the best part of a century by some of the most successful investors. But the uncomfortable truth is that some features of value investing are ill-suited to today\u2019s economy. As the industrial age gives way to the digital age, the intrinsic worth of businesses is not well captured by old-style valuation methods, according to a recent essay by Michael Mauboussin and Dan Callahan of Morgan Stanley Investment Management.\n\nThe job of stockpicking remains to take advantage of the gap between expectations and fundamentals, between a stock\u2019s price and its true worth. But the job has been complicated by a shift from tangible to intangible capital\u2014from an economy where factories, office buildings and machinery were key to one where software, ideas, brands and general know-how matter most. The way intangible capital is accounted for (or rather, not accounted for) distorts measures of earnings and book value, which makes them less reliable metrics on which to base a company\u2019s worth. A different approach is required\u2014not the flaky practice of the dotcom era but a serious method, grounded in logic and financial theory. However, the vaunted heritage of old-school value investing has made it hard for a fresher approach to gain traction.\n\n## Graham\u2019s cracker\n\nTo understand how this investment philosophy became so dominant, go back a century or so to when equity markets were still immature. Prices were noisy. Ideas about value were nascent. The decision to buy shares in a particular company might by based on a tip, on inside information, on a prejudice, or gut feel. A new class of equity investors was emerging. It included far-sighted managers of the endowment funds of universities. They saw that equities had advantages over bonds\u2014notably those backed by mortgages, railroads or public utilities\u2014which had been the preferred asset of long-term investors, such as insurance firms.\n\nThis new church soon had two doctrinal texts. In 1934 Graham published \u201cSecurity Analysis\u201d (with co-author David Dodd), a dense exposition of number-crunching techniques for stockpickers. Another of Graham\u2019s books is easier to read and perhaps more influential. \u201cThe Intelligent Investor\u201d, first published in 1949, ran in revised editions right up until (and indeed beyond) Graham\u2019s death in 1976. The first edition is packed with sage analysis, which is as relevant today as it was 70 years ago.\n\nUnderpinning it all is an important distinction\u2014between the price and value of a stock. Price is a creature of fickle sentiment, of greed and fear. Intrinsic value, by contrast, depends on a firm\u2019s earnings power. This in turn derives from the capital assets on its books: its factories, machines, office buildings and so on.\n\nThe approach leans heavily on company accounts. The valuation of a stock should be based on a conservative multiple of future profits, which are themselves based on a sober projection of recent trends. The book value of the firm\u2019s assets provides a cross-check. The past might be a crude guide to the future. But as Graham argued, it is a \u201cmore reliable basis of valuation than some other future plucked out of the air of either optimism or pessimism\u201d. As an extra precaution, investors should seek a margin of safety between the price paid for a stock and its intrinsic value, to allow for any errors in the reckoning. The tenets of value investing were thus established. Be conservative. Seek shares with a low price-earnings or price-to-book ratio.\n\nThe enduring status of his approach owes more to Graham as tutor than the reputation he enjoyed as an investor. Graham taught a class on stockpicking at Columbia University. His most famous student was Mr Buffett, who took Graham\u2019s investment creed, added his own twists and became one of the world\u2019s richest men. Yet the stories surrounding Mr Buffett\u2019s success are as important as the numbers, argued Aswath Damodaran of New York University\u2019s Stern School of Business in a recent series of YouTube lectures on value investing. The bold purchase of shares in troubled American Express in 1964; the decision to dissolve his partnership in 1969, because stocks were too dear; the way he stoically sat out the dotcom mania decades later. These stories are part of the Buffett legend. The philosophy of value investing has been burnished by association.\n\nIt helped also that academic finance gave a back-handed blessing to value investing. An empirical study in 1992 by Eugene Fama, a Nobel-prize-winning finance theorist, and Kenneth French found that volatility, a measure of risk, did not explain stock returns between 1963 and 1990, as academic theory suggested it should. Instead they found that low price-to-book shares earned much higher returns over the long run than high price-to-book shares. One school of finance, which includes these authors, concluded that price-to-book might be a proxy for risk. For another school, including value investors, the Fama-French result was evidence of market inefficiency\u2014and a validation of the value approach.\n\nAll this has had a lasting impact. Most investors \u201calmost reflexively describe themselves as value investors, because it sounds like the right thing to say\u201d, says Mr Damodaran. Why would they not? Every investor is a value investor, even if they are not attached to book value or trailing earnings as the way to select stocks. No sane person wants to overpay for stocks. The problem is that \u201cvalue\u201d has become a label for a narrow kind of analysis that often confuses means with ends. The approach has not worked well for a while. For much of the past decade, value stocks have lagged behind the general market and a long way behind \u201cgrowth\u201d stocks, their antithesis (see chart 1). Old-style value investing looks increasingly at odds with how the economy operates.\n\nIn Graham\u2019s day the backbone of the economy was tangible capital. But things have changed. What makes companies distinctive, and therefore valuable, is not primarily their ownership of physical assets. The spread of manufacturing technology beyond the rich world has taken care of that. Any new design for a gadget, or garment, can be assembled to order by contract manufacturers from components made by any number of third-party factories. The value in a smartphone or a pair of fancy athletic shoes is mostly in the design, not the production.\n\nIn service-led economies the value of a business is increasingly in intangibles\u2014assets you cannot touch, see or count easily. It might be software; think of Google\u2019s search algorithm or Microsoft\u2019s Windows operating system. It might be a consumer brand like Coca-Cola. It might be a drug patent or a publishing copyright. A lot of intangible wealth is even more nebulous than that. Complex supply chains or a set of distribution channels, neither of which is easily replicable, are intangible assets. So are the skills of a company\u2019s workforce. In some cases the most valuable asset of all is a company\u2019s culture: a set of routines, priorities and commitments that have been internalised by the workforce. It can\u2019t always be written down. You cannot easily enter a number for it into a spreadsheet. But it can be of huge value all the same.\n\n## A beancounter\u2019s nightmare\n\nThere are three important aspects to consider with respect to intangibles, says Mr Mauboussin: their measurement, their characteristics, and their implications for the way companies are valued. Start with measurement. Accounting for intangibles is notoriously tricky. The national accounts in America and elsewhere have made a certain amount of progress in grappling with the challenge. Some kinds of expenditure that used to be treated as a cost of production, such as r&amp;d and software development, are now treated as capital spending in gdp figures. The effect on measured investment rates is quite marked (see chart 2). But intangibles\u2019 treatment in company accounts is a bit of a mess. By their nature, they have unclear boundaries. They make accountants queasy. The more leeway a company has to turn day-to-day costs into capital assets, the more scope there is to fiddle with reported earnings. And not every dollar of r&amp;d or advertising spending can be ascribed to a patent or a brand. This is why, with a few exceptions, such spending is treated in company accounts as a running cost, like rent or electricity.\n\nThe treatment of intangibles in mergers makes a mockery of this. If, say, one firm pays $2bn for another that has $1bn of tangible assets, the residual $1bn is counted as an intangible asset\u2014either as brand value, if that can be appraised, or as \u201cgoodwill\u201d. That distorts comparisons. A firm that has acquired brands by merger will have those reflected in its book value. A firm that has developed its own brands will not.\n\nThe second important aspect of intangibles is their unique characteristics. A business whose assets are mostly intangible will behave differently from one whose assets are mostly tangible. Intangible assets are \u201cnon-rival\u201d goods: they can be used by lots of people simultaneously. Think of the recipe for a generic drug or the design of a semiconductor. That makes them unlike physical assets, whose use by one person or for one kind of manufacture precludes their use by or for another.\n\nIn their book \u201cCapitalism Without Capital\u201d Jonathan Haskel and Stian Westlake provided a useful taxonomy, which they call the four Ss: scalability, sunkenness, spillovers and synergies. Of these, scalability is the most salient. Intangibles can be used again and again without decay or constraint. Scalability becomes turbo-charged with network effects. The more people use a firm\u2019s services, the more useful they are to other customers. They enjoy increasing returns to scale; the bigger they get, the cheaper it is to serve another customer. The big business successes of the past decade\u2014Google, Amazon and Facebook in America; and Alibaba and Tencent in China\u2014have grown to a size that was not widely predicted. But there are plenty of older asset-light businesses that were built on such network effects\u2014think of Visa and Mastercard. The result is that industries become dominated by one or a few big players. The same goes for capital spending. A small number of leading firms now account for a large share of overall investment (see chart 3).\n\nPhysical assets usually have some second-hand value. Intangibles are different. Some are tradable: you can sell a well-known brand or license a patent. But many are not. You cannot (or cannot easily) sell a set of relationships with suppliers. That means the costs incurred in creating the asset are not recoverable\u2014hence sunkenness. Business and product ideas can easily be copied by others, unless there is some legal means, such as a patent or copyright, to prevent it. This characteristic gives rise to spillovers from one company to another. And ideas often multiply in value when they are combined with other ideas. So intangibles tend to generate bigger synergies than tangible assets.\n\nThe third aspect of intangibles to consider is their implications for investors. A big one is that earnings and accounting book value have become less useful in gauging the value of a company. Profits are revenues minus costs. If a chunk of those costs are not running expenses but are instead spending on intangible assets that will generate future cashflows, then earnings are understated. And so, of course, is book value. The more a firm spends on advertising, r&amp;d, workforce training, software development and so on, the more distorted the picture is.\n\nThe distinction between a running expense and investment is crucial for securities analysis. An important part of the stock analyst\u2019s job is to understand both the magnitude of investment and the returns on it. This is not a particularly novel argument, as Messrs Mauboussin and Callahan point out. It was made nearly 60 years ago in a seminal paper by Merton Miller and Francesco Modigliani, two Nobel-prize-winning economists. They divided the value of a company into two parts. The first\u2014call it the \u201csteady state\u201d\u2014assumes that that the company can sustain its current profits into the future. The second is the present value of future growth opportunities\u2014essentially what the firm might become. The second part depends on the firm\u2019s investment: how much it does, the returns on that investment and how long the opportunity lasts. To begin to estimate this you have to work out the true rate of investment and the true returns on that investment.\n\nThe nature of intangible assets makes this a tricky calculation. But worthwhile analysis is usually difficult. \u201cYou can\u2019t abdicate your responsibility to understand the magnitude of investment and the returns to it,\u201d says Mr Mauboussin. Old-style value investors emphasise the steady state but largely ignore the growth-opportunities part. But for a youngish company able to grow at an exponential rate by exploiting increasing returns to scale, the future opportunity will account for the bulk of valuation. For such a firm with a high return on investment, it makes sense to plough profits back into the firm\u2014and indeed to borrow to finance further investment.\n\nPicking winners in an intangible economy\u2014and paying a price for stocks commensurate with their chances of success\u2014is not for the faint-hearted. Some investments will be a washout; sunkenness means some costs cannot be recovered. Network effects give rise to winner-takes-all or winner-takes-most markets, in which the second-best firm is worth a fraction of the best. Value investing seems safer. But the trouble with screening for stocks with a low price-to-book or price-to-earnings ratio is that it is likelier to select businesses whose best times are behind them than it is to identify future success.\n\n## Up, up and away\n\nProperly understood, the idea of fundamental value has not changed. Graham\u2019s key insight was that price will sometimes fall below intrinsic value (in which case, buy) and sometimes will rise above it (in which case, sell). In an economy mostly made up of tangible assets you could perhaps rely on a growth stock that had got ahead of itself to be pulled back to earth, and a value stock that got left behind to eventually catch up. Reversion to the mean was the order of the day. But in a world of increasing returns to scale, a firm that rises quickly will often keep on rising.\n\nThe economy has changed. The way investors think about valuation has to change, too. This is a case that\u2019s harder to make when the valuation differential between tech and value stocks is so stark. A correction at some stage would not be a great surprise. The appeal of old-style value investing is that it is tethered to something concrete. In contrast, forward-looking valuations are by their nature more speculative. Bubbles are perhaps unavoidable; some people will extrapolate too far. Nevertheless, were Ben Graham alive today he would probably be revising his thinking. No one, least of all the father of value investing, said stockpicking was easy.",

        "selftext": "Guys, I started learning about investing in high school. As any precocious teenager, I decided to follow the example of investment heros Warren Buffet and Charlie Munger. I read Security Analysis by Graham and Dodd. I devoured any book that purported to explain Buffet's strategy. Any book that described fundamental analysis. I read Berkshire's Annual reports, etc. I bought in, hook, line, and sinker. I was a total value and moat nerd.\n\nHere's what an obsession over value investing did: when I had the opportunities to do so, I completely rejected investing in Amazon at $40/sh, Netflix $6/sh, Tesla $5/sh, Google $60/sh, and Apple $1.50/sh (all prices are post splits and prices listed were around the early 2000s). Instead I invested in companies in industries like insurance, banking, and transportation/logistics. Sure, I earned annual average return of 11%. But my opportunity costs have been astronomical. Thousands of percent of aggregate return on investment.\n\nThe underlying principle of value investment isn't wrong. All successful investments are in essence value investments in the sense that value is a function of mispricing. However, how one determines whether a mispricing has occurred is what led to me missing enormous opportunities. I myopically focused on financials, i.e. net earnings and primarily free cash flow, rather than focusing on innovation.\n\nIf there is a single lesson to learned from my experience is this: innovation &gt; financials. In hindsight, all the models I created using DCF analysis turned out to be useless and a complete waste of time.\n\nI have since completely changed my strategies and I couldn't be happier with the results of my portfolio. Here's a piece of advice I learned from a professor whose main job was a wealth advisor and portfolio manager: If you are not earning 40% or more in annual returns from investing in stocks (including diversified options like ETFs and Index Funds) than your returns are not commensurate with the inherent risks of equity investing. You might as well not be invested in stocks at all. If you think 11% avg. annual returns is good enough, you are not accounting for risks and your actual risk-adjusted rate of return is negative. \n\nAnyways, good luck and learn from my mistakes young padwan.",

Outrageous levels of debt now by Canada and US.\n\nParts of Europe are devastated and will definitely not gain any much needed tourist dollars.\n\nBusinesses are still closing in my area.\n\nWe all know a ton of money flooded into the US markets and in particular Tech because of the safety factor during COVID.  I think the next correction will be as COVID gets under control and this last massive pump finishes.\n\nThen institutionals and the big market makers will move to more growth orienated areas and back into their home country indexes.  As this happens the retail buyers will freak as they see the prices going down and overreact and pull more out causing a bigger than expected dip.\n\nI am not saying this in a doomsdayer voice just saying my theory.\n\nWhat do you guys all see as going forward and how it will all play out?  I think Biden is going to inherit a market that has a sizable correct but thankfully will be in his first year sometime.",

        "selftext": "Warning: Post contains voodoo and magic line faggotry. Not Safe For Retards\n\nSo I was bored. Wife is out with her boyfriend, Cyberpunk was supposed to be out, NNN means I can't pull out my JPOW anime body pillow, etc. So with nothing to do and TSLA memes still fresh in the one crease on my silky smooth brain, I decided to read up on the dark arts (Investopedia) and this is what I unveiled.\n\nAAPL is the next TSLA.\n\nTSLA blasted off Monday after hours into new atmospheric highs. Could the voodoo have predicted this? Well let's take a [look](https://imgur.com/a/kHx0SI4). Tesla was consolidating within a pennant. Low [ADX](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/trading/07/adx-trend-indicator.asp) (lack of clear trend) and low implied volatility also suggested Tesla was laying dormant and ready to erupt. Volume was declining since the September highs verifying bullish consolidation. During the days before takeoff, volume was dead quiet, as quiet as it was in July, where it also consolidated within a astrology triangle before a bullish breakout. Then Elon launched astronauts to the ISS on Sunday, stockholders to the moon on Monday, and call holders to Mars on Tuesday. The green dildo volume spikes this week confirmed the breakout. The rise in ADX and IV confirmed this as well. Finally, [Andrew's Pitchfork](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/forex/05/andrewspitchfork.asp) (pink lines) is valid due to multiple reactions on the median and bottom line, which some autist named Andrew claims price will have an 80% chance of reaching the median of the pitchfork. In short, more magic lines screaming TSLA is going bigly up. \n\n\"Oh look now you bring up this hocus pocus bullshit after its muuned. Your retard ass could only stitch this mumbo jimbo wizardry together after the breakout.\" \n\n\"If this is legit, then why the fuck didn't you say anything earlier - you busy sucking dicks at the gloryhole?\" (they meet COVID safety standards btw)\n\n\"This is bullshit, if you knew this where are your gains? You don't earn enough flipping burgers to where you can't afford a tier 3 Pokimane sub and TSLA fds?\n\n\"This is a waste of time, you're such a gay cucktard that you make the bull on Wall Street, who's had its balls fondled everyday for decades look straight.\"\n\nOnly one of these is true. And is why I present to you all \ud83c\udf4e.\n\nApple is the girl you start dating, where after a few dates you find out she has a twin. Damn two hot girls that look exactly alike? You're a lucky man you think in your head. Then she takes you to her home for Thanksgiving and there you meet her sister, a celebrity. Her name's Tesla and she is S3XY. However, she doesn't look like the sister you're dating. She is the hottest girl you've seen and with curves all in the right places; it is no wonder why her assets bring her a massive cult following. This is when you realized you dated the wrong sister. But it's not like Apple isn't hot. Tesla is way out of your league anyways. With her beauty (stock) reaching new all time highs and her fame (IV) skyrocketing, perhaps you shouldn't chase. After all [Apple](https://imgur.com/a/bt0mJC6) is still hot right? They are twins and share [similar](https://imgur.com/a/ZaghU7R) features. \n\nApple is consolidating in a pennant. AAPL has declining volume since the September highs confirming bullish consolidation. ADX is low as well as IV. Low IV is when options (calls and puts) are typically cheap, so preferably you want to be on the buy side of option premium. Volume last week was noticeably silent marking some of the lowest traded volume this year. Simply put, AAPL looks just like TSLA two weeks ago, ready to go bigly up or bigly down.\n\nLet me tell you why Tim Apple is most likely polishing his rocket and not his drill. First, declining volume displays bullish consolidation. Second, AAPL has a valid Andrew's Pitchfork with reactions on the median and lower bound, so it has a higher likelihood of reaching the median. Third, the QQQ will print a new all time high. If SPY and IWM have printed a new all time high, whats the likelihood the monster that is Tech (up 36% YTD) would not go past its September high? Already large holdings in the Nasdaq are past the September high. For example, QCOM and particularly GOOGL. If Google can do it, why can't the rest of FANG?\n\n\"I'm scared. There's an autist here spewing shit about demonic triangles and pitchforks. All of a sudden dude starts a creepy cringe tandem about twin girls. This dipshit probably summoned a succubus with his voodoo bullshit, and gave up his soul for this shitpost\"\n\nShrooms are fucking amazing.\n\nBack to the topic. Don't forget Tim Apple and Papa Musk are basically [butt buddies](https://oracleoftime.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Elon-Musk-vs-Tim-Cook-2.jpg). When Apple said they were gonna split their stock this summer, who decided to throw his own tendie party weeks later? Now that Tesla is leaving the atmosphere to Mars, do you think Tim Apple will want to miss out?\n\n\"What will be the catalyst?\" Fuck would I know what Tim Apple is cooking. But this voodoo astrology can smell the tendies he's about to serve.\n\n\"But but the rising cases, the winter lock down, the fundament-\" Shut the fuck up. When was the last time fundamentals mattered? You gay bears like it up the ass so much, you fur fags can't shut up. Fuck the news, we'll only crash if JPOW runs out of ink and we have another liquidity crisis.\n\nI can't guarantee AAPL will be as explosive as TSLA. It's already a 2 trillion dollar company. I can't guarantee AAPL will even go up. This post is simply an argument why it is probable it will muun. But with 3 months of consolidation and eerily silent volume, Apple is gearing up for a big move that will move the markets with it.\n\nIf you actually got this far (wtf?), thank you for letting me waste your time. \n \nPositions: Well I'm fucking balls deep in GME, so this is all I could cough up. AAPL 11/27 125C. Will probably go for December/January expirations once I can get another paycheck from Wendy's.\n\nTL;DR: Yall autists clambering about those commie ass EVs being the next Tesla are missing the iRocket Tim Apple is building to join Elon on Mars. Buy calls. Or just do what you want. At the end of the day it's just magic lines right? It's fugazi. It's a whazy. It's a woozie. It's fairy dust.",

        "selftext": "Roblox Corp. is planning an initial public offering amid strong momentum as millions of tweens and teenagers are glued to their mobile devices during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe San Mateo, Calif.-based gaming platform features a variety of \u201c3-D digital worlds\u201d that are built by users and developers, providing virtual communities where users can play with friends. Roblox RBLX acknowledged in its official paperwork with the Securities and Exchange Commission that it is experiencing a huge boost from users isolated during shelter-in-place policies related to coronavirus, but seeks to appeal to a wider, and older, audience to continue growing when things go back to \u201cnormal.\u201d\n\nRoblox originally filed for an IPO on Nov. 19, after disclosing a month before that it was beginning the process. Roblox said in the original filing that it sought to raise up to $1 billion; this figure is typically a placeholder that will be updated in later filings, but suggests a larger fundraising goal than the typical large IPO, which uses a $100 million target.\n\nRoblox expects to trade under the ticker \u201cRBLX\u201d on the New York Stock Exchange. There are six banks underwriting the deal, led by Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and J.P. Morgan. 2020 has been a good year for IPOs with the Renaissance IPO ETF IPO up 94% for the year to date, compared with a 12% gain in the S&amp;P 500 index SPX , and a 35% rise in the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index COMP .\n\nHere are five things to know about Roblox as it becomes a public company.\n\n1. If you don\u2019t have tweens, you\u2019ve probably never heard of it\n\nIf you haven\u2019t heard of Roblox, you probably haven\u2019t been around a pre-teen much in recent years. The company said that more than half of its 31.1 million daily users are younger than 13 years old. Back in 2018, the service claimed about 12 million daily users.\n\nSince most online accounts require users to be at least 13, the company has faced criticism for inappropriate content on its service. In the prospectus, Roblox said it uses a human review team to screen content and has reviewed more than 68 million \u201cassets\u201d in the first nine months, and has \u201chad a human respond\u201d to more than 9 million customer inquiries within 10 minutes on average. The company hopes to appeal to older users and to retain current users as they grow up.\n\n\u201cWe ultimately aim to be a brand that serves all ages,\u201d the company said in its SEC filing. \u201cAn early sign of what is possible: our 17 to 24-year-old user age group grew faster than our core under 13 age group in the nine months ended September 30, 2020.\u201d\n\n2. COVID-19 generated a huge boost of traffic\n\nWhen the pandemic hit, Roblox growth exploded as tweens and others who were sheltering in place flocked to the online community. The number of daily users surged 82% over the past 12 months and the average user was on the service for more than two-and-a-half hours a day.\n\n\u201cWe have experienced rapid growth \u2026 given our users have been online more as a result of global COVID-19 shelter-in-place policies,\u201d the company said.\n\nIn the first nine months of 2020, Roblox said DAUs, or daily average users, grew to 31.1 million from 17.1 million in the same period during 2019. Year-over-year, Roblox reported 17.6 million DAUs in 2019, compared with 12 million in 2018.\n\nSimilarly, total hours spent on Roblox more than doubled to 22.2 billion in the first nine months of 2020, compared with 10 billion in the same period in 2019. Year-over-year, users spent 13.7 billion hours on Roblox in 2019, versus 9.4 billion in 2018.\n\n3. Its revenue is derived from the model that has Epic Games fighting Apple\n\nRoblox makes money by using a virtual currency called \u201cRobux\u201d that users buy to upgrade avatar and make purchases, but that developers also use within the platform. That means Roblox pays a lot of money to third-party distributors like Apple Inc. and Alphabet Inc. at a time when those practices are being disputed by others.\n\nBack in August, the popular videogame \u201cFortnite,\u201d made by Epic Games, was banned from Apple\u2019s AAPL App Store and Alphabet\u2019s GOOG GOOGL Google Play stores because Epic tried to work around the 30% cuts the companies were getting from in-game purchases, and loudly disputed the practice.\n\nRoblox said it also pays 30% of its one-time purchases to both Apple and Google when they are made on the respective stores. The company said for the first nine months of 2020, 34% of its revenue came from Apple store purchases and 18% from Google store purchases. That\u2019s compared with 30% of revenue from Apple store purchases and 18% from Google store purchases in 2019.\n\nThe company said its bookings surged 171% to $1.24 billion in the first nine months of 2020, compared with $458 million in the same period in 2019. From 2018 to 2019, bookings grew 39%. If defines bookings as \u201csales of our virtual currency which we record as deferred revenue and then recognize that revenue over the estimated average lifetime of a paying user.\u201d\n\nBooking per DAU rose to $39.93 in the first nine months of 2020 from $26.75 in the year-earlier period.\n\nIn a nod to COVID-19\u2019s part in the surge, the company said: \u201cWe do not expect these activity levels to be sustained, and in future periods we expect growth rates for our revenue to decline.\u201d\n\n4. As revenue has soared, losses have widened\n\nWhile Roblox reported a 68% surge in revenue for the first nine months of 2020, losses for the period more than quadrupled.\n\nRoblox reported revenue of $588.7 million and a loss of $203.2 million in the period, compared with $349.9 million in revenue and a loss of $46.3 million for the first nine months of 2019. Roblox reported revenue of$488.2 million and a narrower loss of $86 million in 2019, compared with revenue of $312.8 million and a loss of $97.2 million in 2018.\n\nThe biggest culprits in 2020\u2019s widening loss were payments to content developers and administration fees connected with the run up to the IPO.\n\n\u201cDeveloper exchange fees track closely with our overall bookings performance as more users on the platform and Robux purchased by our users drives more Robux earned by developers and creators,\u201d the company said in its filing.\n\nThose fees soared 190% to $209.2 million in the first nine months of 2020 compared with the same period a year ago.\n\nIn the same period, general and administrative fees soared 125% to $64.9 million. While $27.7 million of that increase was due to higher personnel costs including stock-based compensation expenses, the company also cited \u201can increase in headcount in our finance, accounting, people, IT and legal functions associated with our anticipated public offering.\u201d\n\n5. Early investors get a big upper hand\n\nThe IPO is for Class A shares, which get one vote per share, as opposed to Class B shares that get 20 votes per share and are convertible to Class A shares.\n\nThose Class B shares belong mostly to early investors, the first of which were Altos Ventures and First Round Capital. Altos has a 23.9% stake in the company with 114.3 million shares and First Round has a 7% stake with 33.6 million shares.\n\nLater investors include Meritech Capital Partners and Index Ventures. Meritech owns an 11.6% stake at 55.3 million shares, while Index has an 11.1% stake at 53.1 million shares.\n\nTiger Global Management, which entered the picture in 2018, has an 8.2% stake at 39.3 million shares.\n\nEarlier in the year, Andreessen Horowitz led a $150 million investment round in the company but doesn\u2019t even break into the list of \u201cgreater than 5%\u201d stockholders. \n\n[Source](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/roblox-ipo-5-things-to-know-about-the-tween-centric-gaming-platform-11606499231)",

        "selftext": "Apple last week released the following new Macs.\n\n\\- MacBook Air\n\n\\- MacBook Pro 13 inch\n\n\\- Mac mini\n\nThese 3 Macs all share same chip, [Apple M1](https://www.apple.com/mac/m1/). So Apple is no longer putting Intel CPU in their new Mac product lines.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo you might wonder, how good is this chip?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBased on the leak (and official ones will be released in 2 days when people start receiving their macs), it appears that the new MacBook **Air** destroys the last year's top of the line MacBook **Pro** 16 inch's performance in benchmark, according to what is listed on Geekbench. It also means that Mac mini, which costs ($699) stumps all previous MBP's performances.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n||[2020 MacBook Air ($999)](https://browser.geekbench.com/macs/macbook-air-late-2020) , 2020 Mac mini ($699), 2020 MacBook Pro 13inch ($1299)|[2019 Macbook Pro 16inch &amp; CPU upgraded ($2999)](https://browser.geekbench.com/macs/macbook-pro-16-inch-late-2019)|[2019 MacBook Air ($999)](https://browser.geekbench.com/macs/macbook-air-early-2020-intel-core-i7-1060ng7-1-2-ghz-4-cores)|[i7-9700k](https://browser.geekbench.com/processors/intel-core-i7-9700k)|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Single-core Score (Geekbench5)|**1717**|1095|1138|1289|\n|Multi-core Score (Geekbench5)|**7380**|6869|3072|7267|\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI see that this leap in performance is far greater than what AMD did when they first announced their Ryzen1,2,3 product lines in past few years, and I dare to say that we might be observing start of new era where Apple silicon for laptop computer will be dominating over Intel/AMD going forward for next few years, similar to how their *A* series silicon in iPhone started dominating over all other mobile chips in smartphones, and the gap has not been closing.\n\nThe new M1 chip's single core score of 1717 [outshines](https://browser.geekbench.com/processor-benchmarks) all of consumer level CPUs, and its multicore performance is similar to that of i7-9700k. You need to understand that TDP difference between these M1 and i7-9700k chips are huge. M1 runs with 10watt\\~20watt TDP while i7-9700k has 95watt TDP .\n\nIn short, laptop processor M1 is doing much work with much less energy (less heat) than i7-9700k, which is a desktop processor, and that is how Apple was able to release new MacBook Air this year without any cooling fans. You can't imagine running Intel i7 cpu without cooling fan. This just shows tech level differences and how much Apple was able to achieve by spending on research with billions in their cash reserve.\n\nThe M1 chip, without need of any separate graphic card offers GPU performance similar to RX 570 or GTX 1060. The intel's counterpart onboard graphic chip, Intel UHD630, has much worse GPU performance than M1, and they are incomparable.\n\nApple will be working on improved version of M1 chip, (possibly known as M1X), so that they can put them into MacBook Pro 16inch product lines, and higher end version of Mac mini, and I foresee that to be much faster than any other laptop CPUs out in the wild today, and on par with high end desktop processors.\n\nOf course, the shift in momentum in userbase or AAPL's stock price won't happen in a single day or in single month, just like how release of the first iPhone or Apple's first SoC A4 (which were great innovations at the time but were incomprehensible for many fund managers, as well as to Warren Buffet) at that time of release didn't pop AAPL's stock price 10x times in one day or one month.\n\nHowever, I think AAPL will be gradually increase market share in laptop computer markets over time, and also be able to make more profits due to simpler logistic (They now only need to produce/maintain one M1 line compared to having to embed 11 different intel chips, and having to work with Intel), and possibly expand their influence over to the desktop computer as well in the future.\n\nTL DR:\n\n\\- Apple M1 chip dominates.\n\n\\- Buy $AAPL stocks in your IRA/401k.\n\n\\- Buy $AAPL LEAP call options 2022-09-16 at $120 strike price, and don't look back.",

        "selftext": "So this is my first post on the subreddit but I have been a member for a few months now. I sort of stay on the side and read everyone else's posts and try to get some ideas. I actually just started investing back in September, and I have been slowly learning the ins and outs of investing. I see a lot of posts about stocks and their values and a lot of useful information but one topic I don't see come up often is dividends (maybe there are tons of posts and I am just missing them all). I see people get excited about jumps in prices but not dividend payout dates. Before I ask my question I want to just give a short story of this guy I know. I call him the \"Dividend guy\", mostly to protect his identity.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo about a year ago, I started thinking of my future at 21 years old, and I met this guy at work who is about 5 years older than me. I saw him one day looking at stocks on his computer and I sparked up a conversation with him telling him how I am trying to get into investing for my future. He gave me some tips and it seemed to be a common interest we shared so every time we saw each other we brought it up.  This guy has been investing since he was 18, and he was telling me about some of the stocks he owns. However, one thing I noticed was that after every stock name he told me he also told me the dividend yield % which was impressive he knew them offhand. Fast forward to yesterday and we sat down at the lunch table and he wanted to show me something, he gave a huge talk about why he loved dividends and then showed me a picture of his portfolio. More specifically it was the last 3 stocks that paid him dividends and I was kind of shocked.  One was a payout of around $300 CAD dollars for AT&amp;T dividends, another was around $250 CAD for oracle dividend payouts, finally around $75 dollars CAD for apple dividends, total that up, and within a few days, he made $650 dollars. Also, that's apparently quarterly payments so he gets around $650 dollars every 3 months or so (if that's how it works). I was impressed but then he told me his and plan and this plan is what got me to write this post. He told me he puts all the money he makes from dividends back into purchasing more stocks for now (I know people do this and I do the same). However, he told me his goal is to earn enough money from quarterly dividends and retire by the time he is in his 40's eventually he wants to have enough money coming from dividends to retire and just live his life off of dividend payments. He told me he would need somewhere between $15,000 to $20,000 CAD coming in quarterly for him to meet his goal.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, this got me thinking, I thought this was a cool idea, however, I wanted some opinions from people who know more than me. Is this guy's thinking normal or not normal? I have never heard of someone banking this much off of dividend payments. I mean I just got my first dividend payments from Apple and I made around 6 dollars CAD from 24 shares. I can see taking the hundreds of dollars you can make from dividends and putting back into your portfolio but not living off of them.  But I am worried I am too new to investing to be questioning anybody's methods. So I would love to get some opinions and see if maybe this is a strategy I should look into for the longterm.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you!",

        "selftext": "Tech stocks have soared this year as the pandemic rapidly shifted people to remote work and school. Still, according to strategists at Goldman Sachs, the five largest U.S. tech companies actually aren\u2019t overvalued.\n\nFirst off, these stocks\u2014Facebook \ufffc (ticker: FB), Apple \ufffc (AAPL), Amazon \ufffc (AMZN) Alphabet (GOOGL), and Microsoft \ufffc (MSFT)\u2014are up about 49% year-to-date on average. In comparison, the S&amp;P 500 is up just under 12% for the year. Before Sept. 2, these five stocks had an average multiple on the next two years of earnings of roughly 35 times, against 12 times for the other 495 stocks on the S&amp;P 500, according to Goldman Sachs data. That was the widest valuation gap between the group and the broader market since 2000\u2014before the tech bubble burst.\n\nLately, investors have taken note of the drastic surge in the five stocks\u2019 valuations. Since September 2, the group is down about 3% on average. Meanwhile, large-cap value stocks, judging by the Vanguard S&amp;P 500 Value ETF (VOOV), have climbed 5.2%. Now, the so-called FAAMG group is trading at roughly 31 times earnings, compared with 20 times for the other 495 stocks.\n\nMany on Wall Street are wary of big tech as these multiples would seem bound to continue falling after their meteoric rise this year, and as interest rates rise when the economy starts to see a more solid recovery. Tech stocks, after all, would see less of a benefit from a firming economy. Mostly, growth stocks such as these five tend to have idiosyncratic revenue drivers that aren\u2019t affected by changes in the economy\u2014while the revenues of value stocks like consumer discretionary are very much tied to consumer spending trends and economic growth.\n\nEvercore strategists recently said they only see S&amp;P 500 gains of roughly 5% in the next year or so because they don\u2019t expect big tech to outperform the way it has in recent history.\n\nBut David Kostin, Goldman Sachs\u2019 chief US equity strategist, argues in a note that \u201cfundamentals support higher valuation for FAAMG.\u201d\n\nKostin noted that the near-term earnings outlook for FAAMG stocks supports the current valuations. Goldman is looking for S&amp;P 500 companies to post a median annual earnings per share growth of 8% for the next few years. The tech group is expected to see EPS growth of about 17%.\n\nComparing these companies\u2019 earnings multiples to their near-term earnings growth rates\u2014which many analysts do to determine how fair a valuation is\u2014further justifies Kostin\u2019s point. Facebook\u2019s PEG ratio\u2014calculated by taking the stock\u2019s forward price-to-earnings ratio and dividing by its projected earnings growth rate\u2014is 1.2 times, roughly in line with in its five-year average of 1.1, according to data from FactSet. Amazon\u2019s PEG ratio is 1.6 times, notably lower than its five-year average of 2.4. Alphabet\u2019s PEG is at 1.9 against an average of 1.5, although its five-year high is above 2. Microsoft\u2019s PEG is 2, in line with its average. Apple is the most overvalued by the metric, with a PEG of 2.6 against an average of 1.5.\n\nWith the exception of Apple, these companies are expected to see EPS compound an annual rate between the midteens in percentage terms to above 30%. If investors are willing to pay top dollar for these stocks, earnings growth could continue to take them higher.\n\nAll five have dominant platforms that create seemingly endless synergies. Amazon\u2019s new online drug business, for example, offers perks to their roughly 70 million Prime members. This can drive adoption of the new offering, but can also drive new prime customers.\n\nThe point is tech stocks are pricey for good reason\u2014don\u2019t count them out.\n\nSource: Barron's",

        "selftext": "The 8-core chip is \"by far the highest performance\" processor the company has ever created, Apple says.\n\nApple's next-generation Macs will use a new chip called the M1, a big brother to the A-series chips in its iPhone 12, that Apple says will bring new power and battery life to its personal computers.\n\nThe company's goal with the chip was to achieve \"industry leading performance and features while relentlessly focusing on performance efficiency,\" Apple's senior vice president of hardware technologies, Johny Srouji, said at an\u00a0[Apple launch event Tuesday](https://www.cnet.com/news/apple-silicon-mac-event-one-more-thing-announcement-how-to-watch-livestream-today/).\n\nIn the MacBook Air, the M1 helps provide battery life that's good for \"up to\" 15 hours of web browsing and 18 hours of video. Processor speed is 3.5 times faster than that of the previous Intel-based model, while graphics are 5 times faster, Apple said. The new 13-inch MacBook Pro is up to 3 times faster than the best-selling Intel machine, Apple said. The company didn't detail the testing behind its performance claims.\n\nThe processor has 16 billion transistors, a substantial increase from the 11.8 billion used in the iPhone 12's A14 Bionic. That lets Apple increase the number of central processing cores from six to eight. The M1 has four high-performance cores for heavy-duty work and four high-efficiency cores for low-priority tasks.\n\nLike the iPhone and iPad chips, the M1 also has dedicated circuitry for graphics and and [artificial intelligence](https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-is-ai-everything-you-need-to-know-about-artificial-intelligence/) processing.\n\nIntel didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nPerformance is crucial to the Mac chip transition, influencing whether Mac buyers embrace the new models enthusiastically, sit things out for a while, or even buy a Windows machine powered by [Intel's new Tiger Lake chips](https://www.cnet.com/news/intel-tiger-lake-chip-delivers-long-awaited-laptop-speed-boost/). With [the coronavirus pandemic](https://www.cnet.com/how-to/covid-white-house-hot-spot-vaccine-progress-flu-season-fears-coronavirus-pandemic-update/) triggering a PC sales surge, it's prime time for Apple to try to lure as many customers as possible.\n\nGood performance also means that Apple's Rosetta technology, for running Intel Mac software on Apple silicon machines, is more useful during the chip transition.\n\nApple Chief Executive [Tim Cook announced the Apple silicon change](https://www.cnet.com/news/apple-gives-macs-brain-transplant-new-arm-chips-starting-this-year-wwdc-2020/) at Apple's WWDC developer event in June. But it's been in the works for years, with rumors of [Arm-based Macs extending back to 2012](https://www.cnet.com/news/will-apples-silicon-be-good-enough-for-a-mac/).\n\n[Source](https://www.cnet.com/news/apple-says-its-new-m1-mac-chip-delivers-better-speed-battery-life/)",

        "selftext": " So Friday we saw the stock market down again as the dow fell almost 0,6% percent while the s&amp;p fell over 1% and the nasdaq was crushed being down almost 2and a half percent as This last week we saw the dow fell 6,5% the s&amp;p 5,6% and the nasdaq 5,5% as all 3 ended the month of october down more than 2,3%\n\nOne good thing for the US economy is that the retail stores sales has recovered and consumers are still spending excess cash especially with the holidays and black Friday up next. I believe that as much as Tuesday is important for the economy, the events that will come later in the week as the FED holds two important meatings and the latest jobs report comes in at the end of the week far outweight that\n\nAs you can see the New York Federal bank economic index is still rising, that sugests a V-Shaped recovery is continuing in the US. This index takes into consideration lots of important data from the economy.\n\nThe unemployment in the US has been decling but that rate has sharply slowed down in the last months as it\u2019s still more than double the 3,5% at the start of the year as the latest number from September was almost 8% rate of unemployment.\n\nAs you can see the most affected people are still the middle and low wage under 60k/year. As the high wage jobs unemployment rate is barely down 0,5% since January.\n\nSo the fear in the stock market saw a huge pop in the last week as the VIX (the volatility index) rose from 27,55 more than 10 points to close at over 38 this last week. This next week is probably the last with such high volatility as the upcoming big events will pass and more certainty will be in front of us . The volatility was so high as we retested the June highs and have seen a pullback 3 times after hiting those levels.\n\nDespite strong earnings last week from all big tech companies (Alphabet,Amazon,Apple, facebook and Microsoft) the companies stocks dropped amid the broader stock market sell-off with the exception of Google which posted terrific numbers to crush analysts expectation.\n\nApple is down almost 19% since the highs of September and has lost 450 billion dollars in market cap since then.\n\nThis dropped in the company has been caused by a broader stock market sell off as well as missed iphone revenues. I do believe that iphone revenues will see a huge spike in the next coming quarters as apple customers as myself will finally upgrade from older iphone to this next generation iphone which is the first to have 5G technology as well as other great improvements in capability as well as camera.\n\nA couple analysts have recently changed they\u2019re target to between 132-140 which is over 20$ from where it sit\u2019s today. That is quite good upside for the company.\n\nAs you can see they are barely down 2,7% year over year in product revenue despite not having the new iphone launch included in this financials, and overall the company still saw a 1% increase in revenue due to the huge spike in services revenue that I believe will continue especially with the Apple One bundle just being launched at the end of last week. The Total Gross margin also increase slightly but I expect this to be just a small drawback in the short-term.\n\nAlso I believe that Amazon was dragged down because of the next quarter predictions of huge costs while they only forecasted a operating income of 1 to 4 point 5 billion dollars which is below what was anticipated despite amazon web services continuing to be the largest player in cloud spending. With a 32% share of total market and a revenue of 11,6 billion dollars which Is up 29% year over year, while Azure from Microsoft comes in second and google cloud in third. There is still a lot of room to grow for all of this companies as there is still over 37% of the market provided by other companies. Also this is a great company to own for the long term as digitazation and online commerce will continue to grow, some are estimating that by 2030 amazon could have annual revenues of 1 trillion dollars $ while using conservative projections of compound annual growth for e-commerce of 10%, for the cloud services of 15% and for ad revenue of 20%, amazon could hit that mark by then. But I believe this is possible even faster than that.\n\nFacebook is the one company that I will have to analyze more in this group. They will be hit with privacy issues do to the regulatory risk and Apple\u2019s announced privacy changes. But I still do believe this to be a great company as they also own Instagram, and I really like how that part of the company is innovating and growing.\n\nWhile google seems to be back on track as the company was the laggard in the group. They have become less reliant on the search ad revenue as growth in Youtube ads and Google cloud will push the company to renewed growth in the future.\n\nAlibaba will see two big events this week as they will kick off the singles day event next week, extending the event with 3 more days rather than the usual 24-hour event, in which they will also double the products on offer. Also another big event will be the IPO of ant Group in which Alibaba will still have a big stake. I believe they are a great company the forward revenue growth estimates of 31% are higher than other tech companies like amazon, google and Microsoft while the P/E for the company is the most attractive of the group also.\n\nFord just announced that late next year they will introduce a lower priced competitor for Tesla AutoPilot and GM\u2019s super cruise, this is great news for the company as they seem to be improving the company continuasly.\n\nSome important earnings coming this week are :\n\nPaypal on Monday, which I believe is the greatest fin-tech company, on\n\nWednesday Qualcomm will announce that will be a great insight to see what Apple\u2019s iphone 12 is doing as Qualcomm is the biggest supplier for apple and on Thursday Alibaba (with ant group ipo) coming also on the same day this stock could see a surge in value.",

        "selftext": " \n\nThe news that the COVID-19 vaccine from drugmaker Pfizer (PFE) and its partner  BioNTech  (BNTX) is 90% effective, according to  Bernstein Research  strategist  Inigo Fraser Jenkins , has sent stocks scurrying like \"tracks left in a cloud chamber from particles scattering in an accelerator.\"\n\nGoldman Sachs strategists, led by  David Kostin , say the vaccine is a more important development for the economy and markets than the prospective policies of a Biden presidency. \"The divisive  U.S.  presidential campaign was actually a backdrop to the main event: a public health crisis that has tragically claimed 240,000 lives in the  U.S.  since it began. However, within less than a year, a vaccine has been discovered,\" they say.\n\nThe Goldman team boosted its year-end price target on the S&amp;P 500 to 3700 from 3600, which isn't so far away from Tuesday's closing level of 3545.53. Goldman is also targeting 4300 by the end of 2021 and 4600 by the end of 2022.\n\nThe strategists expect the Pfizer vaccine, and possibly others, will receive emergency use authorization by the end of January, and sufficient doses will be available for the  U.S.  population during the first half of 2021. They increased earnings estimates, mostly reflecting the better-than-expected results for the third quarter. They also are expecting better growth in the  U.S.  next year than the market does, at 5.3% versus the consensus forecast of 3.8%. A weakening  U.S.  dollar and slack in the labor market should support S&amp;P 500 sales and margins, they add.\n\nThey are not too worried about the weight of the technology giants -- Facebook (FB), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT) and  Google  owner Alphabet (GOOGL). The S&amp;P 500 would rise 9% if the FAAMG stocks trade sideways and the remaining 495 stocks rise by the historical median 12-month rise of 12%. And the S&amp;P 500 would rise 16% if the FAAMG stocks rise 5% and the remaining 495 climb 20%, which would represent an 80th percentile move based on historical distribution since 1990.\n\nAs for the debate about value or growth, the Goldman team likes both. For value stocks, the team noted that Monday was the largest single-day increase in the factor's history since 1980, while they say growth stocks should continue to benefit from weak trend economic growth and low interest rates.\n\n\"When thinking about the potential resolution of today's record valuation dispersion, investors often recall the unwind of the tech bubble, which was characterized by a two-year bear market and large negative absolute returns of the previous market leaders. More often than not, however, value rallies tend to occur in rising markets during which high valuation stocks also rise but are outpaced by the lowest valuation firms. This 'catch up' dynamic is what we expect will take place in coming months as a vaccine is approved and distributed,\" the strategists say.",

        "selftext": "Before getting to short squeeze consider this scenario:\n\nAssume you have a long position in Amazon: meaning that you're holding AMZN shares hoping the price will increase in the future and you can make a profit by selling the share. Let's say you bought at $3000 and are hoping to sell at $4000. One morning you wake up and open your Robinhood, and to your dismay, the price of AMZN has fallen to $2000. You freak out and decide to sell quickly to minimize your losses. The highest bid you find is $1998 and you sell at that price. You decreased the price by 2 extra dollars. So by increasing the supply of AMZN, you (and millions of other scared AMZN holders) add to the momentum of the price falling.\n\nA short squeeze is kinda similar but in the opposite direction:\n\nFirst, let's see how a short position works. You short a stock when you expect its price to fall and you want to profit from the decline. Assume the current price of AAPL is $120 and you expect it to fall to $100. So you go to a bank and say can I borrow 1 share of AAPL in exchange for some interest? They give you the share. You immediately sell it at $120. Later when the price of AAPL falls to $100, you buy 1 AAPL and return it to the bank. You are left with a $20 profit (minus the interest you paid).\n\nNow, what if you have a short position (you borrowed 1 AAPL from the bank when the price was $120 and sold it at $120 immediately) and one day you wake up and see the price is $150. You freak out and decide to close your short position, meaning that you want to buy an AAPL as soon as possible and return it to the bank. The lowest ask price you find is $152. You buy at that price, thereby increasing the price of the stock by 2 more dollars. So you, and many other scared shorters, increase the demand for the share, adding momentum to the rise in price.\n\nWhat if there are many many short positions, even more than the shares that are available to be sold? Then the many shorters who want to close their short position face a limited number of ask prices. A shorter buys at $151. Then the lowest available ask is $155. That is bought in a second too. Next one is $160.. and so on. Very quickly, the ask prices are going to be eaten out and the price will rise to levels unimaginable before. This is what we call a short squeeze.\n\nTLDR: buy GME.",

        "selftext": "Alright fellow retards here is some actual DD since you are all too retard to figure out how to watch the fireside chat Barclays just had with Henrik Fisker.\n\nFSR is using the Apple business model for bringing their first suv to market. Magma (ie their Foxconn) will be responsible for the manufacturing of the vehicle using existing facilities already in place (ie if there is a problem manufacturing, it\u2019s not their problem or financial responsibility to fix it, it\u2019s theirs.) Tesla has had several issues throughout the years trying to manage their own manufacturing. FSR won\u2019t have this problem.\n\nOnce the Ocean is out on the market, other models that Henrik is designing now will be able to put on the market in months, not years like manufacturers take to bring something to market. So that means a lifestyle pickup, sedan, or whatever the hell Henrik thinks will sell and get people excited. \n\nThe leasing plans favor Fisker financially. Customers can return the Ocean at any time. The down payment and cheap oem parts will help put the suv back out on the market where the next customer will put another down payment towards the slightly used vehicle. Every time Fisker sells a lease to a customer they get that down payment that secures their financial upside instead of a dealer that would take commission. The Ocean is ripe to be a profit machine so Fisker can then go on to develop more exciting vehicles. \n\nThe Ocean will be in US and Europe in Q4 2022. China(!) will start getting it shortly after in 2023 using existing manufacturing plants in China already owned by Magna. This is a stupid simple play to be everywhere by 2024. \n\nFSR already has the money to put the first vehicle on the market without taking an offering from stock (no surprise offerings needed so you don\u2019t have to worry about the stock suddenly tanking due to investor fear of a sell off.) It would take a massive run on this stock before some stupid analyst would say it\u2019s overvalued for the stock to actually fall to a realistic valuation. Right now it\u2019s completed undervalued. \n\nFSR is at sub 17 dollars right now with a sub 5billion market cap while NKLA has a fake partnership with GM, no solid plans to bring a vehicle to market and you retards value it at like 10 billion. First price target was 22 and second high price target is 40. \n\ntldr FSR 22.5C 12/18 and buy this stock before MM finally figure out how much this is actually worth.",

Although they didn\u2019t give any fundamental reasoning behind their short(other than saying it\u2019s a casino, whatever that means), this inevitably lead to some traders selling their stocks to secure profits.\nCitron has been proven wrong almost all of the times. Very recently with NIO. But also with TSLA, SHOP etc.\n\n2. Traders securing profits. Some traders don't like to hold over the weekends and given that PLTR has runup so much in this week, it is very natural for them to secure profits.\n\n3. Healthy correction. This is pretty obvious. As much as the sub likes to pump this stock. Without a healthy correction, a stock will not really moon. AAPL, AMZN, TSLA etc all saw their corrections in their days.\n\n4. Shorter trading day and being the day after thanksgiving. This is an anecdotal reason, but generally there has been a pattern of correction in this day.\n\nThat's all their is really. Even if there was no reason, you should all have expected a pullback after such a huge runup.\nSaying that it will go to moon without some bumps would be obviously acting like a shill.\n\nThough I must say there is one note of caution in the options market. The numbers are not really in favour of options buyer any more in this stock.\n\nI would recommend buying PLTR shares directly FOR NOW.",

        "selftext": "~@FrankPeelen (Not me, but DD checks out.)\n\nBased on data I gathered from 13F filings, a large number of TSLA shares seem to have gone missing during Q3, to the tune of 50M shares. \n\nThis is a large number of shares that can't be explained away by retail buying, delta hedging, and smaller institutional investors increasing their stakes.\n@s17_scott and Thekiwi on TMC pointed out to me that $BRK omitted one company from its 13F, and instead disclosed this newly acquired stake separately in a confidential filing, because it was worried that making the position public would move the market too much.\n\nAccording to this BI article: https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/warren-buffett-berkshire-hathaway-buying-secret-stock-revealed-coming-weeks-2020-11-1029813523, there is a $25B difference between the value of the portfolio $BRK declared in its 13F and its 10-Q ($220B vs $245B). In actuality, they declared $245.5B in their 10-Q and $229B in their 13F, a difference of $16.5B.\n\nThe BI article also mentions a $6B investment into 5 big Japanese trading companies made over a 12 month period, which was made public in early August, and which supposedly explains part of the disparity between the 13F and 10-Q.\n\nIndeed, there is also a disparity of $5B between $BRK's Q2 13F and 10-Q. In other recent quarters, the differences were:\n\nQ2'20: $202.5B vs $207.5B = $5B\nQ1'20: $175.5B vs $180.5B = $5B\nQ4'19: $242B vs $248B = $6B\n\nSo the current $16.5B difference is not normal.\nThe BI article also mentions this has happened once before in Q2'15, when $BRK reported $110.5B in equity holdings in its 10-Q vs $107B in its 13F, a difference of $3.5B, only to file an amendment 3 weeks later, worth $2.5B.\n\nAssuming that $5-6B of the current $16.5B disparity is due to the investment in the Japanese trading giants, what can the other $11B be attributed to? Could $BRK's currently confidential new investment be $TSLA?\n\nAnother important piece of information is the size of this position, and implications it has on 13D/13G filings. Companies have to disclose an acquisition of a 5%+ stake in a company within 10 days to the SEC. So unless $BRK was also allowed to keep this confidential...this means the $11B must be less than 5% of the company in which it was invested. That means the company's market cap must be &gt;$220B, which really limits the options. There are only 25 such companies listed on US exchanges: https://www.dogsofthedow.com/largest-companies-by-market-cap.htm\n\nFurthermore, $BRK already owns stock in 9 of them, and is 1 of them:\n\n1) $AAPL\n2) $AMZN\n3) $BRK\n4) $V\n5) $JNJ\n6) $JPM\n7) $PG\n8) $MA\n9) $BAC\n10) $KO\n\nThere are only 15 other $220B+ companies listed on the NYSE and NASDAQ\n\nNone of this proves anything, but when combined with the ~50M $TSLA shares that went missing in Q3, there are some strong signs showing $BRK's mystery new investment could be $TSLA.\n\nIf it is $TSLA, this $11B would amount to ~25M shares at the stock price at the end of Q3 ($429), and would go a long way towards explaining the ~50M missing $TSLA shares. 50M shares can't be explained away by retails, small institutions, and delta hedging, but...\n25M can, especially with 25M shares worth of buying pressure pushing up the stock price as much as it did in Q3, because a rising stock price requires a lot of shares to be bought for delta hedging purposes, as I've explained in my blog previously:\n\nhttps://teslainvestor.blogspot.com/2020/04/the-mechanisms-that-fueled-tslas.html\n\nSo did $BRK acquire a large stake in $TSLA? There's no proof, but it seems very plausible. We should find out for sure what $BRK's mystery new acquisition is over the next few weeks or months.",

        "selftext": "Let me start this off by saying I am just an engineer not a finance guy and my only reason to invest in stocks is to secure my future not looking to be a quick millionaire which is why I am posting this question here since the folks here are better at doing all the financial analysis required. \n\nThat being said. Apple recently introduced their M1 chip on their laptops which is based on the ARM architecture, previously they used intel's chips which used x86 architecture. As someone who personally worked with both architecture back in college, i definitely preferred the ARM architecture over x86. All of the bench marks performed on the new Apple chips seem to blow every other laptop out of the water which I believe will be noticed by all the laptop makers. I think more and more laptop makers will start introducing chips based on ARM architecture into their laptops to compete with what Apple is offering, I am sure samsung probably has something in the works. \n\nSo my question is has anyone here ever done any analysis on ARM chips and would they be able to comment on which company most of these laptops would be turning to to buy these ARM based chips? I think ARM was just bought by NVIDIA or may be are in the process of buying? \n\nI think which ever company is on top of this ARM chip manufacturing is going to become very valuable in the next decade. I am just not sure how to find out who that would be. I would love to hear everyones opinion on this.",

If you are not familiar with Razer laptops, they are considered the \"Apple\" of gaming PCs. At the moment, their stocks are hovering at around $0.30. To give you context, Acer stock is at around $2.70, Lenovo at around $13.5, Dell at $65 and Apple at around $115. If this company is worth a 1/10th of apple stocks, then my investment of $3000 would multiply to $100k.

In terms of build quality, I'd be confident in calling them the best. \n\nMy question is, how viable is this stock. At $0.30, it seems like a steal and about the perfect time to invest but the company as we know it has been around since 2005. Thats 15 years.

        "selftext": "The SPAC FEAC and mobile gaming company Skillz announced a merger agreement on Sep. 1, 2020. Merger date is slated for end of this quarter, so should be coming up soon. **I hope that FEAC will be 2021's DKNG**. Here's why...\n\n**What do we know about FEAC?** They're the *same team that brought Draftkings public* (via DEAC), which you may recognize as the [single most successful post-merger company](https://www.reddit.com/r/SPACs/comments/k2qrcw/i_looked_at_the_last_30_spac_mergers_and_compared/) of the last 30 SPACs.\n\n**What do we know about Skillz?** From the [company website](https://games.skillz.com/): \n\n&gt; Skillz is the leading mobile games platform that connects players in fair, fun, and meaningful competition. The Skillz platform helps developers build multi-million dollar franchises by enabling social competition in their games. Leveraging its patented technology, Skillz hosts billions of casual esports tournaments for millions of mobile players worldwide, and distributes millions in prizes each month. Skillz has earned recognition as one of Fast Company\u2019s Most Innovative Companies, CNBC\u2019s Disruptor 50, Forbes\u2019 Next Billion-Dollar Startups, and the #1 fastest-growing company in America on the Inc. 5000.\n\nBasically, they host approx. 30 games on their mobile platform, users pay \\~$0.60 to enter and winners collect prize money. Revenue for Skillz comes in the form of a \"take rate\" (i.e. rake in casino terms), but basically just a percentage of the prize money.  Currently their take rate is 14%, increasing to 15% in 2020, and planning on increasing to 20% by 2024.\n\n**Some valuation numbers:** The merges implies a **valuation for Skillz of** [**$3.6 billion**, or 6.3x projected 2022 revenue](https://eagleequityptnrs.com/skillz-set-to-go-public-to-bring-competitive-mobile-gaming-to-everyone/). Total PIPE is [$159 million](https://www.streetinsider.com/Corporate+News/Skillz+Set+to+Go+Public+Following+Merger+with+SPAC%2C+Flying+Eagle+Acquisition+%28FEAC%29/17316544.html), representing **just 4.3%** of the company valuation. Share terms: \"Paradise, Chafkin, substantially all of the existing Skillz stockholders as well as Flying Eagle\u2019s sponsor have agreed to a 24-month lock-up, subject to quarterly releases of 1.5 million shares per holder commencing 180 days following the closing\".\n\n**The** [**investor presentation**](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1801661/000110465920101665/tm2029912d1_ex99-2.htm) **provides some truly mindboggling numbers, summarized here:**\n\n* **80% YOY Revenue Growth**\n* 2020E Revenue = **$225 million** (confirmed in Nov.)\n* 2021E Revenue = **$366 million**\n* 2022E Revenue = **$555 million**\n* 2020E-2022E CAGR = **57%!!** Compare this to DKNG (45%), SHOP (40%), MELI (38%), SNAP (35%), ROKU (35%).\n* Under expected revenue assumptions, Skillz trades at a **Enterprise Value/2022E Revenue multiple of just 6.2x**. Compare this to SHOP (27.9x), DKNG (12.4x), SNAP (9.5x), MELI (8.9x). Assuming the market prices in a Skillz EV/2022ER multiple comparable to DKNG, this would amount to a valuation of closer to $6.9 billion, \\~2x the current valuation of $3.6 billion\n* Skillz revenue growth in 2021E is expected to be 63%, almost double the expected revenue growth of 33% of comparable companies (calculated as the median).\n* **GROSS MARGIN: 96%!** \"Close competitors\" are WIX (72%),  PINS (68%), and ETSY (67%). Even DKNG only yields 49%.\n\n**Ok, so the games are stupid, right?** Of course they are, they're mobile games. But you know what else is stupid? *Candy Crush* and that crap averages 37 minutes of user interaction per day. What does Skillz get? **62 MINUTES**. The games are like crack.  Even the Chinese superhack TikTok only gets 52 min/day, democracy-destroying **Facebook gets 41 min/day**, compilation fails/ASMR/diy tutorial/pseudo-porn website **Youtube gets 30 min/day**.  Mobile gaming accounts for \\~45% of the entire gaming industry (in 2019) and is estimated to be **$68 billion**, with a CAGR of **20%.**\n\n**Why I like FEAC/Skillz:** With interest rates at all time lows (and not expected to change until *at least* 2023), cash is cheap and companies can borrow basically unlimited money to fuel exponential growth (and then probably just inflate away debt). Combine this with a complete paradigm shift in international business and industry driven by the tech sector, **we are in the golden age** (also probably bubble) **of hypergrowth companies**.   IMO, **Skillz is an incredibly rare opportunity** in terms of early entry into a potentially explosive stock that is already in YOY hypergrowth.  Many SPACs are incredibly speculative, dependent on highly theoretical FY2021 and FY2022 revenue growth. With Skillz, although definitely still speculative, you have the opportunity to invest in a relatively overlooked SPAC that is already in hypergrowth with EV/R multiples well below similar peers.\n\nIMO, FEAC/Skillz is the white whale of the current SPAC crop.  Skillz games have a crack-like addiction, they're in hypergrowth **NOW**, have absolutely insane margins (**96%**), and don't require a massive shift in an entire industry.\n\n**How to play it:** This could be a little tricky.  I'm not sure if there will actually be a significant pump riding up to the ticker change given retail's focus on EV/cloud/SaaS these days. Plus, mobile gaming doesn't have the same allure that sports betting does. Everyone and their mom has heard of DraftKings and Fan Duel, helped out by the Last Week Tonight segment and tons of Youtube ads. However, the growth numbers + revenue margins should be extremely enticing to fund managers, so I hope that large-block buying will increase heading towards the merger.\n\nThat being said, it might take until the merger or even early 2021 to get some traction. In any case, I don't think FEAC is a good place to just park cash in hopes of a pop.  For that, probably just better to either flip other SPACs on announcement or buy into growth companies. For FEAC, I think it's best to buy in with the plan of holding until *at least* the first ER, and then decide where to go from there. I'm not going to tell you \"THis Is deFInitLey thE NexxT apPLE\" \\*rocketemojirocketemoji\\*.  However, I think that FEAC/Skillz will either have a strong multi-year run after merger, or it will flounder in the sub-$20 range in which case I'll move on. The major catalyst for determining what we can expect from the stock is what happens when the merger date is announced (supposed to be in the next few weeks). If there's a BIG pop (like, +25%), then I'll be very confident the post-merger stock will go on a tear.  If reaction is more muted, then we'll have to wait until after the ticker change to see if the market prices in expected revenue growth. If any significant negative press comes out similar to NKLA, I'll trim my position by \\~80% immediately.\n\n**My positions:**\n\n* Units (FEAC/U) - 568; Commons (FEAC) - 2,500; MV \\~ $35k. Will buy in another 1000-2000 shares if momentum begins to pick up when the merger date is announced.\n* Will add some options if the price drops a bit, but they're pretty expensive right now due to recent high volatility in both FEAC price and SPACs overall. Debating getting some deep OTM Feb calls as lotto tickets.\n* Will plan on trimming the position by at least \\~50% if the stock price stagnates around the first ER.\n\n*Disclaimer: Do your own DD. Skillz numbers look amazing, but at the end of the day they're still just a mobile game company so investing in FEAC definitely has the potential to backfire.*",

        "selftext": "Don't think I've seen too many discussions on here about Apple's new M1 based Macs - maybe i missed them when the M1 was first released.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTech reviewers are unanimously orgasming and drooling over this new ARM based Apple-designed chip because it fucking destroys Intel/AMD chips in both performance, efficiency and cost.\n\nSeriously, as a life long PC Gamer + MacBook Pro user, the stats on these new chips are amazing and I'm genuinely concerned about Intel's future in the consumer segment. How will beefier desktop versions of these chips perform with superior cooling. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe M1 chips are first generation, 'low-end' chipsets which are the first offerings from Apple for it's Mac. I think we will be blown away once again once they release their 'pro' chips for higher end machines (MBP high end, Mac Pro, iMac, etc).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCould licensing this chip technology and design out to PC manufacturers in the future be a viable new vertical for Apple (would this make sense for them to do? It's a solid XX-XXX digit $Billion TAM) Most other PCs can't fully utilize ARM chips because Windows is a POS. Apple is in the unique position to control every aspect of product design so it make sense that they've been able to come out with a laptop generation which is the largest leap in price/performance in recent history.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJust some anecdotal tweets I read\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/56g6n19tzb061.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1cf4e0f6d0e794ce9e1c800a31ad5987e87b1d26\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gvnhc9gv0c061.png?width=596&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f7bd74f8ec1da9a72a0813c9ddcef121213ec67f\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ln7u0mpa1c061.png?width=619&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=465d7fa8926293c426ad533a00dce0a0caf21baa\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSeriously wtf, this chip out performs the top spec Intel chip from last year in REAL WORLD APPLICATIONS to an insane degree. When a sub $1400 M1 MacBook Air can run laps around a $6000 2019 16inch Intel MacBook Pro, you know Intel is truly fucked.\n\nNow in terms of $AAPL, obviously this hasn't affected the stock at all because Macs are now such a small % of their business. I think that the Mac/iPad segment is going to start to see growth once again when the true potential of the new chipset is realized and discovered by the market. Potentially they can start selling these chips to OEMs in a few years time? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso where are all the Windows peasants who spam comments about how Apple hardware is overpriced and doesn't perform as well as similarly priced Windows machines.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLinks:\n\n[https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21574057/apple-m1-chips-laptop-performance-intel-qualcomm-competition](https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21574057/apple-m1-chips-laptop-performance-intel-qualcomm-competition)\n\n[https://www.theverge.com/21570497/apple-macbook-pro-2020-m1-review](https://www.theverge.com/21570497/apple-macbook-pro-2020-m1-review)\n\n[https://www.anandtech.com/tag/apple-m1](https://www.anandtech.com/tag/apple-m1)\n\n[https://9to5mac.com/2020/11/11/macbook-air-with-m1-chip-beats-16-inch-macbook-pro-performance-in-benchmark-test/](https://9to5mac.com/2020/11/11/macbook-air-with-m1-chip-beats-16-inch-macbook-pro-performance-in-benchmark-test/)\n\n[https://twitter.com/twostraws/status/1328704598962565122](https://twitter.com/twostraws/status/1328704598962565122)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPositions: long AF AAPL for life, INTEL AMD NVIDIA WATCHOUT",

With the upcoming catalyst that the FDA will approve their vaccine for emergency use (dec 10-11), that should rocket the price at least to 40+, or 45. The calls have a portentik to be 20x baggers. Anyone have any reasoning the volume is so low on these calls? Im surprised That PFE isn\u2019t trending here. I am holding 250 calls for expiration 12/31 40$. Anyone have any input? Also I know free float is 5.5b so it\u2019ll take a lot of volume to move it, but Apple moves 3-4% on news and it has 4x the amount of float. Am I missing anything?",

        "selftext": "**TLDR:**\n\nIn one sentence a TML is an institutional quality stock in a leading industry group with superior fundamentals and technicals. These are monster stocks which over the course of weeks and months increase +100% to +5,000% . These stocks are disruptors which change how we work, live, or play.\n\nTMLs are popular with traders/investors whose methodology is based on the CANSLIM system developed by William O'Neil. He called them Model Book Stocks. Huge winners worth studying to identify common characteristics that they all share  O'Neil studied over 1000 model book stocks going back to the 1880s. Many are shown and discussed in these must read books\n\n* How To Make Money in Stocks, William O'Neil\n*  Monster Stocks: How They Set Up, Run Up, Top and Make You Money , John Boik\n* The Lifecycle Trade: How to Win at Trading IPOs and Super Growth Stocks, Eric Krull, Kathy Donnelly, and Kurt Dail \n\n**A few Historical Examples** from William O'Neil's How To Find &amp; Own America's Greatest Opportunities\n\nApple 2003  [https://imgur.com/2Egn9z5](https://imgur.com/2Egn9z5)\n\nNetflix 2009 [https://imgur.com/BHCtJpo](https://imgur.com/BHCtJpo)\n\nHome Depot 1982 [https://imgur.com/tBU3JgU](https://imgur.com/tBU3JgU)\n\nQualcomm 1997 [https://imgur.com/oYPItOW](https://imgur.com/oYPItOW)\n\nYahoo 1996 [https://imgur.com/ToOxnQJ](https://imgur.com/ToOxnQJ)\n\n**So what are the Fundamental characteristics of a TML? You want to see superior:**\n\n* Quarterly Sales Growth &gt; 25% YoY\n* Quarterly Earnings Growth &gt; 25% YoY\n* Pre+After Tax Margins &gt;20% Recent Quarters\n* ROE &gt;17%\n* Annual Earnings Ests for the next year &gt; 25%\n\nAnd above all else you want the stock to have a great story- A new and innovative product or service  that changes how we work live or play. Not every TML will have all of these criteria, but in general their record should be outstanding with regards to most of them. The higher these values the better. Earnings and Sales growth over 100% YoY is ideal. Annual Estimates for next year over 100% would be exceptional.\n\nTMLs are also often in the Top 20 Industry groups at the times of their runs. The TML is the leader of an overall top group which is riding the tailwinds of changing environments. Recent examples $SE $SHOP $AMZN Retail-Internet and $TSLA $NIO Electric Vehicles (Auto Manufacturers)\n\nAdditionally base liquidity is required for these stocks to be institutional quality. Dollar Volume &gt; $30 Million is essential and most should have DV much higher than that. Accumulation by big hedge funds and mutual funds like Fidelity Contrafund are what move the markets. They won't touch a promising stock unless it has liquidity.\n\n**Now for Technical (Price Action) Characteristics of TMLs.**\n\nThey should be:\n\n* Above a Rising 30 Week Moving Average\n* Breaking out of a Stage 1 or Stage 2 Base\n* Trending above Key Moving Averages (10, 21ema, 50sma)\n* Volume and Price contractions within bases\n* Up/Down Vol&gt; 1.2\n* Huge gaps up on volume after Earning Beat\n* And most importantly they must be showing Relative Strength, meaning they are outperforming the vast majority of stocks in the market. This. is. vital.\n\nDuring corrections and overall market weakness they should be near all time highs, above their longer term moving averages.  They should be standing out like a sore thumb and yelling \"Buy me\".  And during Market Uptrends they should be trending above the shorter term moving averages, forming sideways price shelfs during small pullbacks and then breaking out again. Most stay above their 50 SMAs and even 21 emas for extended periods of time.\n\n**So how to scan for them:**\n\nUse MarketSmith, the IBD Stock Screener, Finviz, or another screener and screen for the fundamental criteria mentioned above combined with the stock over the 200+50 SMA.  It's helpful to have multiple screens splitting up the criteria for instance one scan for the earnings and one for sales.\n\nHere is an example Finviz TML Scan: [https://imgur.com/a/CzwHdM8](https://imgur.com/a/CzwHdM8)\n\n**Recent examples to study**\n\n$LVGO 2020  \n$TSLA 2019-2020  \n$DOCU 2019-2020  \n$PTON 2020  \n$SHOP 2016-2020  \n$AMD 2018  \n$ZM 2020",

Let\u2019s talk about this and other stock market news** [BANNER](https://ibb.co/Y2M1dQ8)\n\nHey everyone and Welcome, let\u2019s start with a recap of the stock markets yesterday \n\nAs we saw a continuing of the same market trading as Monday as the Dow gained almost 1% [CHART](https://ibb.co/1z2DXMT), while the Nasdaq was punished again down more than 1,3% [CHART](https://ibb.co/k8hJGQf) while the broader stock market in the SP finished flat for the day. [CHART](https://ibb.co/bR3yw5L)\n\nWe saw 2 thirds of the market advancing with 77 new highs and 15 new lows while the volume continued to be above average for the second straight day [CHART](https://ibb.co/jfMb5G8) as investors are shifting portfolios more to the value plays. As we saw energy lead the way with 61% of energy companies advancing more than 2% as well as more than 50% of companies from consumer staples and industrials also advancing more than 2% for the day while the laggards were consumer discretionary and technology with more than 20% of the companies being down more than 2% for the day [CHART](https://ibb.co/LhjWFR0)  with many internet retails companies selling off again like fiver jd.com , Etsy eBay, Shopify and others including Amazon. [NEWS](https://ibb.co/fxzG9m5)\n\nThe market was led again by small caps as well as value and high dividend plays while growth and momentum companies were down again. [CHART](https://ibb.co/9HcqktG)\n\nHere is the heat map for the S&amp;P500  [MAP](https://ibb.co/DG8f1JW) where you can see most of the big tech companies as well of most of the credit services were down. While the broader market map shows the transition to energy plays as well as industrials [MAP](https://ibb.co/vz48M8g). Whereas tech companies like Netflix, Amazon, Facebook and Microsoft extended losses from Monday this dragged the Nasdaq Index down.\n\nThe volatility index maintained steady at the 25 level slightly lower than yesterday but keeping that support line that will be maintained for a period in my opinion [VIX](https://ibb.co/3MmwnjF) with the VIX withstanding the huge market volume from Monday, as early data from Reuters shows that there were nearly 2 trillion $ being exchanged [NEWS](https://ibb.co/xMNCPNz) as value stocks had the best one-day performance against growth stocks ever in the US as brokers worldwide had problems handling this huge volume of trading with companies like TD Ameritrade, Fidelity, Charles Schwab experiencing issues. [NEWS](https://ibb.co/Xx1dwpG)\n\nSo, democrats have clinched House control but they really disappointed expectations as they were expecting to gain even more seats as much as 15 but this has moved to a loss of seats that stand at 6 and counting at the moment. This has completed 2 thirds of the best results the stock market was expecting with only the Senate being up for grabs at the beginning of January. [NEWS](https://ibb.co/qCkzY3x)\n\nToday there are not many events in the economic calendar as only Mortgage Applications number are expected, as the bond markets are also closed for Veterans day, stocks will see most of the trading today.\n\nYesterday Apple launched the first MacBook laptops with the in-house built processor, this will move closer the Mac and iPhone as they will both have the Apple processors from now, cutting they tie the company had with Intel that bad provided them for almost 15 years. The new Macs seem to have huge improvements in performance and battery life. This will likely be a boost to the addressable market of the Macs as they will address the people who need big performance in they\u2019re computers as well as people who are looking for good cheap computer as the new Mac Mini desktop is 100$ cheaper than the previous version. This will be a more than 15 billion addressable market for Apple as they continue to improve products and services all the time. [APPLE NEWS](https://ibb.co/RHsDQx6)\n\nBoeing announced that they have lost another 12 orders for the 737 MAX and delivered just 13 aircrafts, the delivery number is down from 20 aircrafts in the same month from a year ago. So they have only delivered 111 aircrafts this year a huge decrease from 321 just a year ago in the same period. [BOEING NEWS](https://ibb.co/HTZSB94)\n\nThe stock has seen a surge of more than 30% as people are rushing back to own the stocks after positive news on the ending of the 737 max grounding as well as the vaccine news.\n\nThis was also helped by the fact that the just secured worth almost 10 billion $ with the Air Force. [BOEING CONTRACT](https://ibb.co/6vRFGjF)\n\nAlibaba just announced that orders made on its e-commerce platform during the Singles Day event have exceeded 56 billion $ by today as consumers are still splashing out money on buying products online. Singles day is the world\u2019s biggest sales event eclipsing both Black Friday and Cyber Monday in the US combined as it stretches over 4 main days this year. They have received more than 16 times the orders that Amazon received last month in its two-day Prime event. This are finally some good news for the company as it has lost almost 76 billion $ of it\u2019s market value after the suspension of Ant Group IPO which they own about a third of. I believe this will be a great opportunity to buy the stocks as it is way down from its highs. Ant Group will eventually file and have they\u2019re IPO in the next year which will boost the stock up once again even if it will be at a much lower valuation for the company. [ALIBABA NEWS](https://ibb.co/JFBvPV7)\n\nSome other news interesting news is that Airbnb has delayed the documents release for the IPO, as they decided to delay these more from the US elections. [NEWS](https://ibb.co/0JKW0wD)\n\nAlso, Uber is expected to close a deal worth more than 2,5 billion $ after the DOJ has cleared the way [NEWS](https://ibb.co/Tkbx1FN) \n\nWhile Ford is moving more and more to address the EV market as they are expected to release a lot of EV models starting next year.  [NEWS](https://ibb.co/qxNmdyT)\n\nWhile the jobs openings from September has seen a revision that moves it closer to the 6,5 million that where expected as the job openings rate was more than double the quits rate. [NEWS](https://ibb.co/zFrrpsZ)\n\nThis as the small business optimism was flat last month a lower value than was expected but the same as September [NEWS](https://ibb.co/RjgKNLw) pretty much in line with TD\u2019s Investor movement that was flat also in the last month. [INVESTOR SENTIMENT](https://ibb.co/X2fv359)\n\nSo, I believe great times are ahead as do many of the investors as a post-election poll shows that over 60% expect a positive return next year. But be aware any derailments or delays of the vaccines may bring more volatility to the stock market. [POLL](https://ibb.co/SxqtQSL)\n\nThank you everyone for reading!

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, November 16, 2020**\n\nThe stock market rallied today, with the Dow Jones reaching record highs, after Moderna (MRNA) announced promising data for its COVID-19 vaccine candidate, adding to hopes that an effective vaccine may soon be available. Remember Pfizer (PFE) also announced positive vaccine data last week.\n\nThe S&amp;P 500 (SPY) finished the day 1.19% up, the Nasdaq (QQQ) finished the day 0.78% up, and the Dow Jones (DIA) performed the best, finishing the day 1.67% up.\n\nEarly Monday, Moderna (MRNA) announced that preliminary data from its late-stage clinical trial showed its vaccine candidate was 94.5% effective in preventing COVID-19 in participants. This study, known as the COVE study, enrolled more than 30,000 participants in the U.S. Based on the data, the company said it \u201c intends to submit for an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the coming weeks.\u201d The company reported they expect to have prepared 20 million doses of the vaccine by the end of the year and between 500 million to 1 billion doses globally in 2021. The company is working with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Operation Warp Speed, McKesson (MCK), and governments across the globe to plan for distribution. Moderna\u2019s vaccine candidate is a lot easier to ship than Pfizer\u2019s candidate, which requires super cold temperatures. The company said, \u201cvaccine candidate now expected to remain stable at standard refrigerator temperatures of 2\u00b0 to 8\u00b0C (36\u00b0 to 46\u00b0F) for 30 days, up from the previous estimate of 7 days. Shipping and long-term storage conditions at standard freezer temperatures of -20\u00b0C (-4\u00b0F) for 6 months. mRNA-1273 is to be distributed using widely available vaccine delivery and storage infrastructure. However, it is important to note that setting up a global distribution network for the vaccine is likely to take months. Here is the link to the Company\u2019s press release: [https://investors.modernatx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/modernas-covid-19-vaccine-candidate-meets-its-primary-efficacy](https://investors.modernatx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/modernas-covid-19-vaccine-candidate-meets-its-primary-efficacy))\n\nOver the weekend, the United States topped 11 million coronavirus cases, with 250,000 people tragically dead, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. The US is nearly averaging 150,000 new infections per day, the most since the pandemic started by a wide margin, with the number still growing. Around four weeks ago, the US first crossed the 100,000 cases per day mark for the first time. In recent days, more cities and states have added curfews and tightened their restrictions on daily activities as case counts soar. New Jersey\u2019s new daily COVID-19 cases hit a record high on Saturday, and Illinois and Ohio both saw record numbers of new cases on Friday. Chicago posted a stay-at-home advisory late last week, and New York state had a new 10 p.m. curfew on bars, restaurants and gyms go into effect Friday. Oregon ordered a two-week \u201cfreeze\u201d on non-essential business activity and large social gatherings. The recent surge in case is once again straining hospital capacity, with around 70,000 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 across the US. This number is also growing at a record rate. Therefore, during the next weeks we expect a gradual tightening of restrictions nationwide. While it is highly unlikely we return a lockdown like earlier in the year, we expect states to enact restrictions to combat the recent surge in cases. \n\n**Highlights**\n\n* President-elect Joe Biden consulted the CEOs of top U.S. companies and labor leaders on Monday before a planned speech on fixing the pandemic-battered economy and welcomed further progress in COVID-19 vaccine development.\n* After the positive vaccine study, reopening stocks like cruise lines, airlines, hotels, and others once again spiked. Stay-at-home stocks like Peleton (PTON), Zoom (ZM) were under pressure.\n* Shares of Pfizer (PFE) and BioNTech (BNTX) fell today after Moderna (MRNA) new data showed their vaccine to be more effective and easier to store. \n* Lordstown Motors (RIDE) says it's \"on-track\" to being making electric pickups by September 2021 called the Endurance. \n* Xencor (XNCR) target raised by Cantor Fitzgerald from $40 to $46 at OUTPERFORM. Stock currently around $40.\n* Twilio (TWLO) with extremely bullish target raise by Oppenheimer from $350 to $550 at OUTPERFORM. Stock currently around $280. Stock has been under pressure recently, maybe a good opportunity.\n* Square (SQ) with very bullish target raise by Keycorp from $215 to $250. Stock currently around $180.\n* SunRun[ ](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24RUN&amp;src=cashtag_click)(RUN) target increased by Barckalys from $57 to $68 at OVERWEIGHT. Stock currently around $55.\n* ON Semiconductor (ON) target raised by Needham &amp; Co. from $30 to $33. Stock currently $28. \n* Moderna (MRNA) target raised by Piper Sandler from $136 to $166 after positive vaccine news and to $105 by Bank of America (BAC)\n* Installed Building Products (IBP) target raised by Deutsche Bank (DB) from $110 to $114.

        "selftext": "I'm back r/stocks with my plays this week. Last week I closed out half my positions and left a few on the table waiting for them to hit my targets. Since I still have some of my positions open from last week I made my watchlist longer for this week to keep an eye out on plays that become within my level. I've also had a lot of DMs asking for plays that can be used on a smaller account so I've included some tickers that require less capital to sell cash-secured-puts. These are simply positions I might be entering based on my own due diligence and analysis.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**What am I doing?**\n\nI do technical analysis and selling cash-secured-puts 1 to 4 weeks out on stocks that are nearing key levels of support. My goal is to collect premium, but should I get assigned I have absolutely zero problem running the wheel on stocks I want to own. As a backstory I nearly blew up my account doing WSB-style plays in March but have regained all of my account and then some running this strategy since April. What I do now is basically wheeling on weekly puts.\n\nI watch over 200 stocks, I would say its 90% waiting game and 10% true technical analysis. My levels work, but it's normally because I am patiently waiting for an entry point. Yes that's a lot of tickers to watch, but I research my stocks on weekends and then monitor additional plays &amp; levels during the weekday to see if there is an obvious setup I want to participate in.\n\n# Here's a few things regarding my strategy\n\n**1.** I don't over-leverage with spreads because if the stock price blows past your long strike and you assume max loss you need a lot of capital to actually be assigned the shares. For that reason I don't really see selling multiple spreads as a \"Theta Gang\" play and is still very high risk. If I do open a spread it will be a protective put for $1-5 just to protect myself should the company randomly announce bankruptcy.\n\n**2.** I only sell cash-secured puts with the capability to be assigned if need be. My goal is to never take a loss on a position and always wheel it back to profitability. If something has changed fundamentally with the stock then yes I will close the position and realize the loss.\n\n**3.** If IV on a ticker is very low, then yes I will outright buy shares instead.\n\n**4.** I only aim for 1-4% per week collecting on theta and an occasional earnings theta yolo. No call-buying, no spreads, only put-selling and shares!\n\nHonestly, that's about it. I'll go through some tickers on my watchlist this weekend and what I currently have open.\n\n# Open Positions From Last Week\n\n**FB:** 1x 18 Dec, 2020 $260 put sold to open. Up 50% on this option I sold, looking to sell early this week if we get a good pop and close it out at 60-70%.\n\n**MSFT:** Holding 100 shares. Up 1.75% on the position. Stock sitting at $215, my short-term price target is around $218-220 before I look into selling the position.\n\n**NVDA:** 30 shares. Up 0.24% on the position. Looking for $550 here.\n\n**PTON:** 1x 11 Dec 2020 $101 put sold to open. Up 25% here will look to close at around 50-70% profit range.\n\n# Chart Rules\n\n**Pink Lines** = Trading range &amp; channel. I find stocks typically trade within certain channels until an event, such as earnings or some news which changes the fundamentals of the stock price changes the trend and a new channel is formed.\n\n**Blue Lines** = Key areas of support/resistance. I don't like focusing on supp/res levels every $2 down like some people do. I look at the bigger picture and find where where key levels of buyers come in to grab the stock. I'll try to sell puts there.\n\n# Master Plays This Week (Stock price in parenthesis)\n\n**CRM Salesforce ($248) - Earnings theta yolo**\n\n[CRM CHART](https://imgur.com/uTjMgNF)\n\nCRM has been the powerhouse is customer relations management throughout covid. High quality product that is converting more and more businesses into clients. Earnings are coming up this week so premiums will be juicy. The stock has been consolidating in a volatile range for about 2 months now. Uptrend still intact and close to the $240 support level where we will find some buyers. I'll be looking to enter a position here.\n\n**Positions I'm watching:**\n\n**1.** 1x Dec 11 2020, $240 strike put, sold to open for $7.60 or $760 premium. Return: 3% in 2 weeks. \\*I'm selling the 0.33 delta put here. You can go to a lower strike and lower delta, maybe even $235 here and still get decent return.\n\n**2.** Shares with PT to $280.\n\n**TDOC Teladoc ($196)**\n\n[TDOC CHART](https://imgur.com/NC6WSKs)\n\nI entered TDOC a couple weeks ago and made a quick 2-3% return on my play in just 2 or 3 days after the stock price shot up. It's trading a little higher than when I entered my position last time, but still near the bottom of the trend channel (pink lines). I think anything close to $190 is a good entry point. I'll be keeping an on it and look to sell a 0.30 delta put option 4 weeks out if the timing is right.\n\n**Positions I'm watching:**\n\n**1.** 1x Dec 24 2020, $185 strike put, sold to open for $7.00 or $700 premium. Return: 3.7% in 4 weeks.\n\n**2.** Shares with PT to $210-$215\n\n**PTON Peloton ($109)**\n\n[PTON CHART](https://imgur.com/Rl0L7pJ)\n\nI already have a position in PTON open. I sold a put when it was down 6% in a single day last week. I think anywhere sub-$100 level there will be buying pressure to keep it up. When it broke out to $140 it quickly reversed back to the mean stock price and into the channel. Weird how that works ;) Looking at the chart would you buy the stock when it the stock price was going vertically up from $100 to $140? I try to avoid buying on vertical lines unless it's a vertical line down on a stock ticker I like. The trend is still up here even though it has wild swings. Eventually this ticker will lose it's juicy premiums when volatility goes down. I'll try to capture some theta in the mean time.\n\n**Positions I'm watching:**\n\n**1.** 1x Dec 24 2020, $101 strike put, sold to open for $4.45 or $445 premium. Return: 4.4% in 4 weeks.\n\n**2.** Shares with PT back to $120.\n\n**FSLY Fastly ($85)**\n\n[FSLY CHART](https://imgur.com/x0QFpVj)\n\nFSLY also trading in a range approaching that $85 resistance level. It might take off, but if it doesn't I will look to sell a put option around the $78 strike where I think we can find some buyers for the stock. This is another ticker that has volatile swings, but also has been trading steady in a range. Looking at charts like this helps me see where the stock is going and what it is doing. If you look at the daily or intraday you lose sight of these things because it has such wide swings. This will lead you to easily being spooked out of your positions or selling too soon.\n\n**Positions I'm watching:**\n\n**1.** 1x Dec 24 2020, $78 strike put, sold to open for $3.75 or $375 premium. Return: 4.8% in 4 weeks.\n\n**2.** Shares with PT up to $95.\n\n**PRPL Purple Mattress ($30)**\n\n[PRPL CHART](https://imgur.com/ccdQhGV)\n\nPRPL is outside the trend lines and outperforming and also right at the resistance line. Sounds cliche, but the stock will either continue up and outside the range, where I will not touch it, or come back down to the $26-28 range where I will look to sell some puts. IV is still high on this ticker and makes premiums good to sell on. Will need to see where the stock goes this week before any decisions are made.\n\n**Positions I'm watching:**\n\nWaiting for a dip and for the stock price to come back into the channel. Waiting.\n\n**GME Gamestop ($16)**\n\n[GME CHART](https://imgur.com/LjpQ9Ie)\n\nThe possibilities where this stock can go are infinite. Premiums sky high. Strong support at $11 and we have some at the $14 range. If we get another up day of 10% tomorrow I won't touch this stock, otherwise I might sell some puts 4-6 weeks out and try to capitalize on the crazy IV this ticker has. This is a higher risk, higher reward play that I am willing to take. Why? Short interest is sky high. When the stock price increases, shorts will cover their losses which will squeeze the stock higher. If the stock price goes down, we will see some dip buyers and also potentially some shorts closing positions for break-even.\n\n**Positions I'm watching:**\n\n**1.** I will look to sell puts at an appropriate strike when the time comes. If the stock is up 10% Monday I won't chase it.\n\n# Long-term holds I am watching\n\nPLTR (Palantir) and AAPL (Apple Inc). Unfortunately AAPL has terrible premiums so I can't collect any theta on it, but I do like the pricing point going into the holidays. Some of the main tech stocks have been under-performing for some time. I think there is a good opportunity to get some before they begin to take-off again.\n\nI did some research on Palantir stock this weekend and I gotta say I like it. The stock has almost tripled in just a few weeks, but I will be looking to enter some long-term positions in shares if or when the stock dips.",

They have two titles under a synergistic umbrella in Warfare.\n\nCall of Duty Black Ops came out yesterday night and it\u2019s getting solid reviews. Regardless of what you think of the game, it has the same old time feel unlike the realistic brother in modern warfare.\n\nIt\u2019s the number 1 game on twitch naturally right now, and it\u2019s all under the Warzone umbrella.\n\nFor those who do not know, Call of Duty\u2019s Warzone (Battle Royale version) is now allowing both games to access the feature. What once was a cannibalizing hedge, releasing two games at the same time, similar to Apple releasing the same dumb shit every year with Animoji\u2019s.\n\nActivision can churn two titles and incentivize player usage under the Warzone umbrella. There will be a pay to play feature, new maps, new decals and skins. Everything now will be under one umbrella.\n\nAdditionally, Blops has Zombs. So go buy it right now.
