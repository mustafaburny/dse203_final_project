        "selftext": "Hey gang!\n\nMarkets were cruising for a good portion of the day before pulling back a bit. Really kind of a muted day for the markets as a whole, with the exception of the IWM charging nearly a full percent. That's good for our small caps! With markets stagnating and the VIX rising, tomorrow's market movement will depend on the nonfarm payroll numbers, which are released before the market opens. \n\nSome analysts are expecting the ending of expanded federal unemployment benefits to surge job numbers. If this month's payroll numbers disappoint, I expect next months to obliterate expectations as people will go back to work in some capacity and seasonal hiring will start picking up. \n\nObligatory: these are not stock recommendations, **this does not constitute financial advice - if you need that kind of advice contact your broker**, I'm just analyzing unusual option data, (so if you don't see your favorite stonk, don't take it personally) please do you own DD, replaying the best Star Wars game ever made Knights of the Old Republic (someone commented about this yesterday but it got swept away), etc. etc. etc. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n|STOCK|PRICE|VOLUME (AVG)|CALLS% - PUTS%|MOST ACTIVE|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|BBIG|7.99|458.3K (74K)|89 - 11|Sept 20c (33.7K)|\n|RAAS\\*|5.68|28.4K (681)|86 - 14|Sept 7.5c (11.3K), Sept 5p (2.8K)|\n|KPLT\\*|5.53|96.2K (7.1K)|94 - 6|Sept 7.5c (20K)|\n|NXE\\*|5.44|3.7K (933)|91 - 9|Sept 5c (471)|\n|MMAT\\*|5.76|71.7K (30.1K)|89 - 11|Sept 5c (12.6K)|\n|GSAT|2.08|146.5K (24.1K)|89 - 11|Sept 2.5c (40.4K)|\n|MILE|4.44|43K (3.2K)|96 - 4|Sept 5c (14.6K)|\n|DNN|1.40|37.9K (7.7K)|95 - 5|Oct 2c (8K), Jan 23 2c (6.1K)|\n|INFI|3.82|30.5K (2.8K)|99 - 1|Oct 5c (16.5K)|\n|SWN|4.89|25.2K (7.6K)|89 - 11|Sept 4.5c (9.7K)|\n|PROG|1.05|21.8K (2.5K)|95 - 5|Sept 1c (4.8K), Jan 1.5c (2.9K)|\n|HIPO|4.39|16.1K (2.3K)|57 - 43|Oct 6c (3.1K), Sept 4p (1.9K)|\n|YVR|2.05|12.5K (1.2K)|100 - 0|Sept 2.5c (8.8K)|\n|CRVS|2.72|10.6K (84)|100 - 0|Sept 2.5c (5.3K), Sept 5c (5K)|\n|WTRH|1.28|9.6K (2.5K)|97 - 3|Sept 1.5c (2.2K)|\n|UEC|2.84|8.1K (3.3K)|96 - 4|Sept 2.5c (1.1K)|\n|HMY|3.53|4.9K (1.3K)|88 - 12|Jan 4c (3.7K)|\n|ADTX|1.80|3.8K (1K)|96 - 4|Oct 2.5c (1.5K)|\n|ALZN|3.35|3.7K (1K)|98 - 2|Sept 5c (2.4K)|\n|AMPE|1.73|3.4K (1.5K)|84 - 16|Sept 2c (987)|\n|CBIO|4.75|3.3K (614)|92 - 8|Oct 5c (780)|\n|WWR|3.92|3.1K (1.7K)|95 - 5|Feb 5c (1K)|\n|CRTD|3.37|3K (765)|97 - 3|Sept 5c (1.9K)|\n|JG|2.36|3K (375)|79 - 21|Oct 5c (762)|\n|REPH|2.45|2.9K (569)|99 - 1|Apr 2.5c (1.4K), Apr 7.5c (872), Apr 5c (600)|\n\n\\* denotes the stock started the day below $5/share\n\nNotes:\n\n**BBIG -15%** Experienced the inverse of yesterday, as there wasn't enough gas to keep on the upward pressure. 781.7K calls vs 173.5K puts in the OI heading into the trading session. 407.9K calls, 50.4K puts, and over 105 million shares traded today. BBIG just opened up weekly options, which I'm sure is going to blow up several people's accounts. If you're in the play for the \"proxy\", I wouldn't go with short term options, as theta will eat you alive. OI numbers are starting to shift heavily toward September expiration. \n\n**RAAS +21.8%** Was trading at $5.91 in the mid-day report. No news for the cloud-based communications company from China. Interesting that with a super bullish day, the second most active option are puts. Will they print tomorrow?\n\n**KPLT +15.8%** Was trading at $5.43 in the mid-day report. No news. Very popular stocks across social media right now. \n\n**NXE +10.3%** No news. Apparently uranium demand has been rising for months, according to u/Epraksemet_Nalej**.** Always interesting when a stock has elevated option activity, but one option hardly stands out from the rest. \n\n**MMAT +16%** In the mid-day report, MMAT was trading at $5.18. No news. \n\n**GSAT +11.1%** Was trading at $2.27 in the earlier report.  GSAT filed an 8-K update describing receipt of \"an additional advance payment of $37.5 million from a customer...\". The company will use the funds to repay some debt. Saw some saying \"Is this coming from Apple?\" Most likely no, as Apple isn't a customer of theirs. The Apple news was tied to the iPhone having Qualcomm chips. QCOM is a GSAT customer. \n\n**MILE +6.2%** Traded at $4.41 in the early report. I hate the amount of mail this company sends me. I don't want your pay-per-mile auto insurance, thx.  Big sweeps for ATM calls. \n\n**DNN +8.5%** Was trading at $1.36 in the early report. Again, apparently uranium is entering a super cycle. Multiple large (2,000+) orders for options at the $2 strike in both October and January 2023.\n\n**INFI +6.4%** In the mid-day edition, was trading at $3.80.  Announced they will participate in Wells Fargo's Healthcare Conference and H.C. Wainwright's 23rd Annual Global Investment Conference, both virtually. Notable that the most activity is for October calls. \n\n**SWN +4%** In the mid-day edition, was trading at $4.88. Completed acquisition of Indigo Natural Resources and updated 2021 free cash flow guidance. \n\n**PROG +7.4%** Traded at $1.02 in the early report. No news that I could find. Large sweeps for LEAPS. \n\n**HIPO -14.7%.** Traded at $4.38 in the early report. Has fallen 60% since it's SPAC-based IPO in January. Today marks the day private investment in public equity investors are able to unload their shares as per the merger agreement. Still a lot of call traders. \n\n**YVR +12%** Traded at $2.12 in the early report. Has given back 4.8% AH. Signed an agreement to acquire iNDIEFLIX, an \"edutainment\" company. \n\n**CRVS +16.7%** No news that I could find. Half of the unusual volume came from 5,000 bear call spreads with September options - sell the $2.50 call, buy the $5 call for upside protection. \n\n**WTRH -7.25%** Traded at $1.33 in the early report.  Supposedly one of the most shorted penny stocks, but these rumors are unsubstantiated. Perhaps someone can dig up the ortex numbers. \n\n**UEC +10.94%** Traded at $2.78 in the early report. Uranium stocks getting a lot of love today. Through UEC's finviz page I did find an interesting write up about uranium stocks that cited GLJ Research raised its price target on uranium mining company Cameco. The analyst for GLJ sees massive upside for uranium spot prices. Hmm if all of these uranium stocks hopped one one analysts recommendation, will the gains hold/continue or revert back a little bit? Worthwhile to note that the article I pulled this information from was published by notorious hedge fund The Motley Fool, who very well could be short uranium. \n\n**HMY -4.34%** Traded at $3.47 in the early report.  Released earnings either yesterday or the day before, I can't tell (conflicting sources). Two orders each for 1,750 Jan $4 calls under the \"Stock Contingent\" condition. \n\n**ADTX -1.64%** Back on the list after a brief absence. No news. \n\n**ALZN +5.68%** Traded at $3.32 in the early report. No news that I could find. Single order for 1,061 September $5 calls. \n\n**AMPE +6.13%** No news driving option/price movement that I could find. \n\n**CBIO -1.45%** Finally some different stocks other than the March bear call spreads as the most active. No news.  \n\n**WWR +1.29%** No news, and I don't think I've ever heard of this company before. They hold interests in a graphite project in Alabama. Formerly known as Uranium Resources, Inc, so potential Uranium sympathy play? Most popular options are pretty far out, could be a big short hedging their position. \n\n**CRTD -0.59% (+2% AH).** No news that I could find. \n\n**JG +15.12%** I couldn't find a direct reason for JG's big gain today. First time hearing about this Chinese mobile developer service provider. Always interesting when there's elevated option activity but not a single one stands out. \n\n**REPH -0.81%** Traded at $2.55 in the early report.  Apr ratio spreads continue to be the most active. \n\nIf anyone has any questions about anything, by all means, don't hesitate to reach out either here or by DM. I float the DM option out there because you might think something is too embarrassing to ask about, or you're new or whatever, but please just ask someone. Knowledge is the best weapon. \n\n*To reiterate - I DON'T PICK THESE STOCKS. They qualify by having elevated (at least 1.4x) option activity compared to normal. I'll be more than happy to check a stock's option activity for you, but save the \"wHaT aBoUt mY sToNk iTs gOiNg mOoN!\" type comments.* \n\nShout out to \"random ticker comment with no context\" gang!\n\nboom",

The original version can be found [here](https://babbl.substack.com/p/labor-day-weekend-and-more-bullish)\n\n**TLDR:** stock market news sentiment remains significantly bullish for yet another week in a row, driven by optimistic monthly reports released for the month of August and continued upward trends from the SP500 and global cryptocurrency market.\n\n# 1. This Week\u2019s News Sentiment \ud83d\udcf0\n\nAs we commence our first week of Autumn 2021, stock market news remains just as bullish as it was to end the summer. News coverage this week was relatively unchanged in terms of sentiment compared to last week. Overall, the average finance article written this week scored a 0.35 in terms of sentiment (meaning that just over 1-in-3 sentences written about the markets this week leaned optimistically) and a 0.63 in terms of time-sense expressed (meaning that almost 2-in-3 sentences published this week were written in future tense). Here\u2019s a look at the major news events driving the continued all-time high bullish sentiment this past week:\n\n\ud83d\udcc8 Stocks: The major U.S. stock indexes traded in a narrow range all week, but the S&amp;P 500 managed to post a modest gain for the second week in a row.1 The NASDAQ outperformed its peers for the second consecutive week while the Dow fell slightly. Despite sustaining a mid-month decline, the S&amp;P 500 recovered to record its seventh positive month in a row, posting a return of about 3% in August. The index reached 12 record closing highs in the month versus 7 in July.\n\n\u20bf Cryptos: Much of this week\u2019s news optimism can be attributed to the continued meteoric rise in cryptocurrency prices. Global cryptocurrency market capitalization grew 11.5% this week to $2.4T dollars to cap off the largest month in history in terms of cryptocurrency trading volume. The majority of crypto-related headlines this week came on the back of Ethereum ($ETH) which rose more than 20% to $3,935.17 per coin this week at the time of this writing; other big crypto movers this week include Solana ($SOL) and Bitcoin ($BTC) as it eyes its first \u201cgolden cross\u201d since May 2020.\n\n\ud83e\udd85 Economy: While news optimism remains relatively high overall, time-sense fell slightly this week as a slew of monthly economic reports were released for the month of August. A private report showed that the U.S. economy recorded its 15th consecutive monthly gain in manufacturing activity in August. The Institute for Supply Management\u2019s manufacturing index rose 0.4% to 59.9. Any reading above 50 indicates growth in manufacturing activity. We also saw August\u2019s monthly job report this week. The economy generated 235,000 new jobs last month, far short of economists\u2019 expectations and trailing gains of nearly 1.1 million in July and 962,000 in June. The unemployment rate fell to 5.2% from 5.4% in July.\n\n# 2. Most Mentioned Tickers \ud83d\udcca\n\nEach week we analyze the number of headlines written about each stock and cryptocurrency. The most mentioned tickers in this week\u2019s news and the tickers with the biggest volume increase compared to last week are shown here: [most mentioned tickers 8/30-9/3](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8d976bee-76fb-40f8-b7b7-1a97515e6ff3_1230x753.png)\n\n\ud83c\udf4e Apple ($AAPL): For the second consecutive week, $AAPL was mentioned more in news coverage than any other ticker in finance articles scraped this week. A mainstay of our weekly most-mentioned list, Apple Inc. churns news headlines, whether or not there\u2019s actually significant news to report about the company or its stock. Following the 10-year anniversary of Tim Cook\u2019s tenure as Apple CEO last week \u2014 as part of which he received $750M in $AAPL share value under the terms of his contract \u2014 headlines this week centered around an open letter written to Cook by Apple employees presenting a litany of grievances including concerns about privacy and diversity within the company. Apple also saw headlines from outside the workplace this week, as regulators from around the world mount pressure on the company\u2019s current App Store policy, accusing Apple of exerting too much control (ex. a 30% commission on in-app purchases) on developers who use it to sell products.\n\n\u201cWhat is Apple Thinking?\u201d | The New York Times\n\n\ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83d\udd27 Automatic Data Processing Inc. ($ADP): The ticker with the biggest increase in news headlines this week compared to last week was $ADP. The stock fell a slight -0.86% last week and has now dropped nearly 3% over the past month to $207.38 per share as the company plans to go ex-dividend on September 9th. This means investors who purchase and settle shares of $ADP before this upcoming Thursday will be eligible to receive the company\u2019s $0.93 dividend payment per share, which will be paid out on October 1st. Automatic Data Processing\u2019s previous dividend payment consumed approximately 61% of the company\u2019s free cash flow last year, and while this is in the normal range for most dividend-paying organizations, analysts seem to agree that the decision bodes well for the company\u2019s long-term strategy by freeing up some space on their margins during a relatively lean period in its history as a business. Overall news sentiment for $ADP scored a +41.05% on a scale from -100% to +100%, signaling relatively bullish sentiment to boot over the past week.\n\n\u201cAutomatic Data Processing, Inc.

Sentiment Winners and Losers \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4e\n\nEach week we summarize the most extreme sentiment scores in the news for each ticker to help you decide where to focus your attention. Here\u2019s a look at which tickers scored the highest (and lowest) in terms of optimism, pessimism, speculation, and reaction expressed in this past week\u2019s news: [most optimistic and pessimistic tickers 8/30-9/3](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F29ce2ff0-9cf0-4d9e-b630-893857f80eee_2181x1305.png)\n\n# Sentiment: Most Optimistic\ud83d\ude00 and Pessimistic\ud83d\ude12 Tickers\n\n\ud83d\udcf6 Motorola Solutions Inc. ($MSI): This week\u2019s most optimistic stock in news coverage was Motorola Solutions Inc. (optimism score: 58.9%). $MSI stock rose a mere 0.76% on the week to build on 46.7% growth so far in 2021. Motorola Solutions \u2014 which succeeded Motorola, Inc., following the spinoff of the mobile phone division into Motorola Mobility in 2011 \u2014 has been spoken of with relatively good cheer compared to industry competitors like Qualcomm ($QCOM) and Verizon ($VZ). Much of the optimism has come as a revelation following the company\u2019s Q2 earnings released nearly a month ago on August 5th, in which the company revealed stratospheric annual earnings per share growth of 41% compound. While some may call it an old-fashioned investment in today\u2019s age of \u201ctech-stock blue sky investing\u201d, it\u2019s hard to argue with bonafide profitability like this if you\u2019re investing for the long-term. This week\u2019s most optimistic $MSI article:\n\n\u201cHere's Why I Think Motorola Solutions Is An Interesting Stock\u201d | Simply Wall St.\n\n\ud83d\udc15 Shiba Inu Coin ($SHIB): This week\u2019s most pessimistic (and reactive) ticker in news coverage was Shiba Inu Coin (pessimism score: 29.3%). Even though we saw relatively low amounts of pessimism in this week\u2019s news coverage across the board, $SHIB saw more pessimism expressed in articles this week than any other ticker, as the fringe cryptocurrency reached its lowest price of the past month on Tuesday (a whopping $0.000006735 per coin \u2014 yes, that\u2019s five zeroes after the decimal) as its developers announced that they\u2019d be removing a portion of the existing $SHIB supply from circulation. Though $SHIB price rose considerably heading into the weekend and continues to trend upwards at the time of this writing, it\u2019s still down 11% in value over the past month. Keep in mind that the coin \u2014 which was created in April as a blatant meme and borderline Ponzi scheme in response to the meteoric rise in the price of Dogecoin early this year \u2014 has grown 45x in value since its inception four months ago. In other words: a $1,000 investment in Shiba Inu Coin back in April is now worth somewhere around $42,000.

($FE): The stock with the most speculative (ie. future-tense) sentiment measured in the news coverage this week was FirstEnergy (speculation score: 95.4%). $FE stock 2.86% this week to $39.59 to cap a 34.16% run in share price year-to-date as the energy utility company has benefited from improving electricity demand in recent months. Per the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), U.S. retail electricity sales are likely to inch up 2.7% in 2021 after sliding 3.9% in 2020. Given the growth in demand, coupled with FirstEnergy\u2019s 96.5% earnings growth this year and given that its stock is still trading 52.8% below its estimated fair value (according to Simply Wall St.), analysts speculate that its stock is set to remain a handsome mid- to long-term investment. Analysts also cite $FE\u2019s 14% return on equity (ROE) as a reassuring sign that the company is growing in value and effectively managing investors\u2019 money.

Presented below are the tickers that saw the biggest change in each of our four sentiment metrics this week compared to last: [image](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F68ffb0c2-1e95-4b38-b913-cf5a9e81061e_2038x769.png)\n\n\ud83d\udcbd Advanced Micro Devices ($AMD) saw the largest increase in optimism expressed this week compared to last week after $AMD stock broke resistance above $109 per share early in the week; analysts at Benzinga say the stock has now settled into its second bullish pattern of the past month. On Wednesday, it was reported the U.S. Department of Energy was nearing a deal worth $500 million to purchase a supercomputer made with AMD and NVIDIA Corp.\n\n\ud83d\udcb0 Coinbase Inc. ($COIN) recorded the largest increase in pessimism expressed this week despite the stock rallying 8.62% to $278.44 per share. This increase in pessimism can be widely attributed to a handful of contrarian, negative articles published by the likes of the Motley Fool and SeekingAlpha arguing that the underlying volatility of digital assets makes Coinbase an inherently risky stock to invest in.\n\n\ud83d\udcbb Hewlett Packard Enterprises Co. ($HPE) posted the biggest increase in speculative language expressed this week compared to last as the stock remained relatively flat over the trading period, rising just 0.06% to $15.67 per share. Much of the speculation surrounding the company\u2019s lackluster earnings report released early in the week, in which the company\u2019s continued supply chain issues showed through. Analysts wonder if HP\u2019s component supply concerns will continue.\n\n\ud83d\udc89 Moderna Inc. ($MRNA) received the biggest increase in reactive language expressed after increasing in stock price by more than 13% to $416.70 per share on strong trading volume and new research released this week suggesting that the company\u2019s COVID-19 shot may offer longer-lasting protection that Pfizer\u2019s amid growing conversation about the importance (or lack thereof) of booster shots.\n\n# 4. Market Mood Outlook \ud83c\udf21\ufe0f\ud83d\udd2d\n\nThis past week brought a close to the month of August and commenced the unofficial start of Fall 2021. In terms of market action, August was the 7th consecutive month of stock market growth, and the largest month in history in terms of cryptocurrency trade volume. This past week was no exception to the tremendous momentum in both realms, and news sentiment reflected this: stock market news articles published this week saw more optimism expressed on average than any other week this year except for one (the first week of August, the height of Q2 earnings).\n\nLooking ahead into September and October, the extreme optimism is showing no signs of slowing down as Wall Street expectations for the next stock market earnings season continue to rise. Over July and August, forecasts for third-quarter earnings of companies in the S&amp;P 500 rose 3.8%, according to FactSet. That\u2019s the fourth-largest such increase during the first two months of a quarter since 2009.\n\nWhile market bulls are currently reveling in the continued outperforms of stocks, market bears may be quick to point out that we are growing more and more due for some sort of correction. The S&amp;P 500 hasn\u2019t suffered a 5% pullback since October 2020. The last time the index experienced such a long period without a big drop was from June 2016 to early February 2018. With that in mind, we will continue to watch the progression of international economic factors like the COVID-19 Delta variant and the transition to Taliban rule in Afghanistan for any inkling of adverse impact on the U.S. stock market. That\u2019s all for today\u2019s report; good luck this week everyone, and thanks for reading. \ud83d\ude4f",

The CRM stock was from the result of Slack acquisition. \n\nFor Intel, I'm waiting to see how their big.Little CPUs and ARC GPUs will perform in reviews. If the reviews are good, I'm going big in Intel. There is usually a huge lag between a reviews of CPUs/GPUs to Wallstreet reacting. For example, AMD Zen2 was going to be a massive success if you read the reviews. Wallstreet didn't react until many months later. In addition, the government will keep Intel alive no matter what because they need a domestic chip manufacturer. Lookout for a ton of government subsidies to Intel.\n\nFor Qualcomm, I'm betting that their Nuvia acquisition will allow them to move into the laptop/desktop market but it's a small bet right now. Again, I will wait for reviews of their first Nuvia product before deciding if I want to buy more because of the lag between reviews and Wallstreet reacting.\n\nSo far, I've beaten S&amp;P500 last year and this year so far.",
