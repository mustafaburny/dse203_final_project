        "selftext": "I'm a new investor. Here's what I plan to buy. I have long term and short-term strategies mixed in. I have missed the optimal buying times for a few stocks but I wasn't aware of them at the time. I know I could buy my long-term stocks now but I want to see how well they will survive over the next months, especially the airlines so I want to wait. I'm still trying to decide on what to buy. I don't have FOMO. I will take what I can get.\n\nBudget: 50k+ (as I earn more money, it will increase. The more money I have, the more stocks I can hold long-term)\n\nLength of time: 2-3 years and 10+ years. 2-3 years is not a set time frame. It is a general time I would like to pull out for short-term gains but I can keep it in there longer if it needs more time.\n\nI'm trying to learn as much as I can. I know the market will rally during crashes and bear markets can last 1-3 years. I have bought stocks in the past two months but I'm not used to holding stocks during a volatile market so I prefer to stay out so I don't have to worry about them Some of the stocks I want aren't going to move much in price anyway so I'm not in a hurry to buy them. Any suggestions for stocks or objections to the ones I currently have are welcomed.\n\nVZ 1k\nJPM 1k\nPYPL 1k\nLUV 2K\nUAL 2k\nDAL 4K\nSAVE 4k\nSPG 5k\nAirbus 5k\nCSCO 3k \nIMAX 3k \nPRU and/or AFL 5k (want AFL more than PRU)\n$36k so far\n\nOther stocks I was considering\nMA, V, WM, HON, TSLA, SPCE, JNJ, FLIR, TER",

I\u2019ve been wanting to add biotech companies to my portfolio, but I read that its all highly speculative with them and couldn\u2019t settle on a specific one.\n\nI found the iShares NASDAQ Biotech ETF (WKN: A2DWAW), but I\u2019m not sure if I should jump in, since TER is a bit high (0.35%) and hasn\u2019t really performed that well. \n\nAny thoughts about this ETF? Or about the Biotech sector as a whole?",

Off the top of my head I'd like:\n\n- a properly customisable ticker widget for my phone;\n- a SENS announcement service, and notifications of important company dates (eg AGM date, dividend announcement and distribution dates etc);\n- a tool to show my portfolio balance (eg % local, foreign, equity, bonds, prop, etc) \n- a tool to show the weighing of constituents within ETFs, and importantly, overlap of constituents between different etfs\n- a tool to sort TER, performance, (further metrics?) of etfs\n- \n\nWhat about you folks?",
