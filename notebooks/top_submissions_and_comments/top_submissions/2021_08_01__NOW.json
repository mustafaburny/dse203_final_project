        "selftext": "Here it is, I got lucky.  I took a few loans in different ways to daytrade stocks:\n\n- $20k\n- $10k\n- $6k from my girlfriend\n- $4k from credit cards\n- some savings from my regular job\n\nThe reason I took so many loans is that I was constantly making little money and losing (the loans were not taken all at once). At one point, I decided to put together as much money as possible and went all in on GameStop after the first squeeze.\n\nWhen GameStop hit $340 the second time, I sold it all literally 5 minutes before it dipped, and made $65k.\n\nSince that moment, I've been trading with $50k+ and it's been really easy to make money, so I decided to quit my job. After quitting, I got my hand into $25k that they had to pay me as severance.\n\nBottom line: I extinguished all my loans BUT $27k I owe the bank, and right now I'm trading with $65k. I figured that, considering taxes, I have to make $1500 monthly to break even (monthly expenses + loan rate). If I pay off the bank, that amount is reduced to $700 monthly expenses.\n\nHowever, if I pay off the bank, my trading power will be reduced to $35k, which is insufficient, in my experience, to make money just trading stocks. So what do I do? Keep trading until those $65k become, lets say, $100k, and then pay off the bank? Or just extinguish debt and go back to trade with under $50k?\n\nThanks!",

        "selftext": "Okay fellow apes.Hurricane Ida is mere hours away from hitting the coast of Louisiana. It surprisingly strengthened as it neared landfall and is now a Cat 5 hurricane, expected to be the \"strongest storm\" since 1850, even worse than Katrina.  \nHere's how to play it.\n\n1- A bunch of offshore drilling takes place in the gulf and with a storm this destructive, production will take a hit, oil futures are already up. You can play this by buying calls on SPDR S&amp;P Oil &amp; Gas Exploration &amp; Production ETF $XOP or playing the levered oil ETF $GUSH.\n\n  \n2- People run out to buy a whole lotta stuff from generators to basic homebuilding materials like plywood, sandbags, flashlights etc. You can play this by buying calls on Home Depot $HD,  Lowe's $LOW and Generac Holdings $GNRC which sells generators.\n\n  \n3- People tend to rent cars to run away from the storm or as a short-term replacement for the cars that they lost in the storm. You can play this by buying calls on the AVIS Budget group $CAR.United Rentals $URI which rents out all sorts of equipment gets a boost from every hurricane season as well.\n\nMy favorite play will probably be oil, as \\~90% of oil and gas production in the gulf of Mexico has already shut down and storm damage will inevitably limit future production as well. I'll be looking to buy $XOP &amp; $GUSH call spreads.  \n\n\nNOTE: Spambot kept deleting my post for \"spam domains\" even though they were all legit local news sources, so I removed all links.",

        "selftext": "What's up retards, I have spent the past 2 WEEKS finding the best stock play to make YOU RICH, and it looks like CRSR is ready to go to the MOON!\n\nNO MORE will your wife\u2019s boyfriend bully you for your micro-penis! After CRSR you will be rich enough to get penis-enlargement surgery and FINALLY have a dong BIGGER than his!!!\n\nNow before you retards go gamble all your life savings on the chance to get penis-enlargement surgery, let me explain why CRSR will go TO THE MOOON\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**First, the Fundamentals:**\n\nNow bare with me, I know you retards don\u2019t like fundamentals\u2026 So I will make it as short and colorful as possible!\n\nFundamentally, this company is one of the MOST undervalued companies I have EVER seen\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mznix9b2uhk71.png?width=1380&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c29960c932cbd9af0f993eaaf0b124f918960fac\n\nCRSR has grown at 24.3% Y/Y despite chip shortages, re-openings, supply-chain shocks, commodity inflation, and last year being especially good for them cause of lockdowns\n\nThey also own Elgato which specializes in studio equipment for streamers, and Origin PC which builds custom pc\u2019s\n\nThese two additional companies have been growing rapidly and allow CRSR to capture the whole gaming peripheral market\n\nDespite being a well run, profitable company in a growing industry, they are priced at HALF the S&amp;P 500's P/E!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/izz273f4uhk71.png?width=825&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=efe189f52a2c6e4b7afd394465e64fb915cc0320\n\nAdditionally the float is only around 88M... so unlike some plays on here, WSB could LITERALLY buy the ENTIRE FLOAT\n\nI could go on for SO much longer about why CRSR is a Deep F\\*cking Value play... But since you retards have an attention-span worse than a goldfish, I will move on...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Option Chains:**\n\nCorsair has an insanely bullish options market which is primed for a Gamma Squeeze\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3778p8t6uhk71.png?width=1290&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0c9838491bb87c9d27bdacb7759ff9fe87f37ae5\n\nIf CRSR gets above $35.00 by 9/17, up to 2,037,800 shares will need to be purchased! This is even before WSB has gotten their greasy hands on it. I\u2019m sure by 9/17 the open interest will be MUCH higher\n\nHaving so many options sold just OTM is PERFECT for a gamma squeeze\n\nAdditionally due to delta hedging, the more IV on options and options that go ITM, the more stocks MM's will need to buy to hedge against the options that they sold\n\nHaving so many options contracts sold on a smaller market cap stock is perfect for a gamma squeeze. IV will go through the roof once WSB buys in causing MM's to hedge creating a feedback loop\n\nCRSR options are SUPER cheap which gives a good entry point for WSB retards, and makes it much easier to increase the open interest\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Short sellers:**\n\nOver the past month, short sellers have been getting TOO greedy and have been adding a shit ton of positions around 26$. This means shorts will be underwater if the stock price increases AT ALL\n\nCRSR has a short interest of around 24% which, albeit still large, would not be a huge issue on its own... but because most of these short positions were opened at the literal bottom, those short sellers will be much more likely to close their positions and/or be margin called\n\nFor the past few weeks, around 40% of the volume has been sold short\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/e9foib1cuhk71.png?width=768&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cd43fab041475611218d946812efb0dc47a2d786\n\nAt the same time as shorts have been adding positions, large institutional investors have been buying in HEAVILY\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a7284jjduhk71.png?width=820&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=22a94571d7c932f4439a5587301cbcfca8fc41ff\n\nThis high of a short interest combined with strong financials, a bullish options market, and large institutional investors being on our side means shorts are absolutely fucked and this stock is going TO THE MOON\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**How to Profit:**\n\nI recommend buying a mix of 9/17 ITM/OTM calls, leaps, and shares\n\nBuy 9/17 calls if you believe this has a chance to squeeze\n\nBuy leaps/shares if you believe in the underlying company\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Positions:**\n\n10 $27.5 C 9/17, 13 $30 C 9/17, 50 $32.5 C 9/17, 20 $35 C 9/17, 106 shares, 2 $25 2/18/22 C\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TLDR:**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u1dcgm1iuhk71.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=15cd932f87fe52287b37262ec396341363afc910",

        "selftext": "As the beginning of next year, California will enforce new animal welfare law for breeding pigs and other farm animals. But only 4% the hog operations currently can comply. According to one farmer, to meet the new standard, he needs 3 million for the upgrade to raise just 250 hogs. Restaurants owners are worried because bacon is one of the most popular breakfast items and bacon helped their business survive the pandemic. ([https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-31/bacon-may-disappear-in-california-as-pig-rules-take-effect](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-31/bacon-may-disappear-in-california-as-pig-rules-take-effect?srnd=premium)).  People love bacon from all backgrounds. \"You know, I work and live with a lot of Asian and Hispanic populations in the city and their diet consists of pork bacon. Pork bacon is huge,\" Kim said. \"It\u2019s almost like bread and butter.\"\n\nBacon love is ingrained into our soul and genetics and therefore an inelastic demand. Therefore a small change in bacon supply can lead to a drastic change in price, as explained by graph below. \n\n[Inelastic Demand Price Action](https://preview.redd.it/huc5pz6xoue71.jpg?width=570&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fcea15c61d5e19157c1cfb07d1e9684142bf67c2)\n\nAccording to consulting firm Hitamiya Group, if half of the pork supply was lost, bacon price would jump 60% which means a $6 package could rise to $9.60 cents ([https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-31/bacon-may-disappear-in-california-as-pig-rules-take-effect?srnd=premium](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-31/bacon-may-disappear-in-california-as-pig-rules-take-effect?srnd=premium)). If 90% - 95% of the supplies are gone, the fair price should be at least 2.5 times the current market value. And that means **1 package of bacon is $15 per package.** \n\nYou must wonder, how do I profit from this? A very ancient trade technique - BUY LOW SELL HIGH\n\nI am not talking about buying 10 packs of bacon from Costco and resale them later. I am talking about doing it at scale. Go big or go home. \n\n**Step 1 - Install Freezers in Your Garage**\n\nLet\u2019s figure out how many freezers you can potentially have. First park your cars on the street and empty the garage. The average garage size is 12 feet \\* 22 feet \\* 8 feet. So 12 \\* 22 \\* 8 = 2112 cubic feet. \n\nThe below fridge dimension is 37.25 x 20.75 x 33.25 inches and can storage up to 7 cubic feet items. \n\n[ Ideal Fridge to Keep Bacon](https://preview.redd.it/yfk3jbp3que71.jpg?width=1282&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=731f5da26e2187ec37b1dbd4fbabc5b7789ebd15)\n\nLet\u2019s do more math to see how many fridges your garage can potentially store. \n\n2112 (volume of garage) \\* 1728 (1 cubic feet is 1728 cubic inch) / 37.25 \\* 20.75 \\* 33.25 (volume of fridge) = **142 fridges**\n\nObviously you can\u2019t just stack all of those fridges in the garage. Let\u2019s say we can achieve 80% of that. And that means you can have around **110 fridges.** \n\nRemember to use Amazon FREE SHIPPING. Very important to save cost. \n\n**Fridge Cost with Tax**: 110 \\* 229 \\* 1.1 (Uncle Sam wants the tax) = **$27709**\n\n|**Item**|Cost|\n|:-|:-|\n|110 Fridges|$27709|\n\n**Step 2 - Buy Bacon in Bulk and use FREE SHIPPING**\n\nAccording to USDA ([https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/meat-price-spreads/](https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/meat-price-spreads/)), one package (1 pound) of bacon in  June 2021 is about $6.67. We can get this much lower by buying from Costco in BULK. As you can see below, **our one package cost is $4.53** AFTER tax including delivery. Again, very important to use free shipping to save cost.\n\n[Bacon Price From Costco](https://preview.redd.it/4a12382erue71.png?width=1840&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=48f5dacba1eb055847e3b266aef24fb5abcee393)\n\nIt's time to calculate how much to buy. The size of one package of bacon is about 10 inch \\* 4 inch \\* 1 inch so 40 cubic inch. And the volume of our fridge is 7 cubic feet which is 12096 cubic inch. So one fridge can store around 300 packages or pounds of bacon. With 110 fridges, we can store 33000 packages or pounds of bacon. Each pound of bacon is $4.53, so the total cost of bacon is $149,490\n\nTotal Cost So Far\n\n|**Item**|Cost|\n|:-|:-|\n|110 Fridges|$27709|\n|33000 packages or 2200 cases of bacon|$149,490|\n\n**Step 3 - Factor In the Electricity Cost**\n\nRunning 110 freezers in the garage is apparently very energy consuming and electricity is expensive in California, at about 20 cents / kWh. \n\nThe freezer is 150 watts so running 110 freezers for let's say 6 months will cost $14256. You can check my math below:\n\n150 watts \\* 6 (month) \\* 30 (days) \\* 24 (hours) / 1000 = 648 kWh (one fridge running a year energy consumption)\n\n648 kWh \\* 0.2 cents / kWh \\* 110 = $14256\n\nTotal Cost So Far\n\n|**Item**|Cost|\n|:-|:-|\n|110 Fridges|$27709|\n|33000 packages or 2200 cases of bacon|$149,490|\n|Electricity|$14256|\n\nStep 4 - Sell High And Take Profits\n\nDon't diamond hand bacon, you are in 2022 and it's time to sell for a profit! \n\nThe cost of bacon per package factoring in everything so far is **$5.8.** And we unload each package for $15. So that means each package profit is $9.2. \n\n# The total profit is $9.2 * 33000 = $303,600\n\nIf you too lazy to contact customers or answer phone calls yourself, just hire someone for like 20K a month to the work for you. I expect the inventory goes to zero in a month so at the end of the day, you pocket close to $280,000 profits. \n\nAnd you can figure out the tax part and probably can resell those freezers for half the price.\n\nTLDR: Buy Bacon Now and Get Rich Later",

        "selftext": " \n\nHey retards, here's another special dividend play for a special boy. \n\nMcAfee may have made your wife\u2019s boyfriend hard, but Ecovyst will make you SO RICH you can finally fuck some strippers to satisfy yourself since your wife won\u2019t. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEcovyst (ECVT) just announced a special dividend of $3.2/share, which at a share price of $16.2 is OVER a 20% return! Now I am not here to talk about a boomer 20% return, but more so how this news has not been priced into the stock/options and provides a perfect short-term options play \n\nOver the past few days ECVT has traded relatively flat, only really increasing over the past day or so. News of this insane dividend has barely made any headlines and no one seems to know about it. Once more people find out about this stock and buy in for that 20% return, the price will EXPLODE\n\nSince the announcement of the dividend, the stock has ONLY increased by 8 cents\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rxekeqrr6jg71.png?width=812&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aec7b419466a891ac768925d3195b2bc86953adc\n\nThe stock \u2018should\u2019 drop around $3.2 after the ex. dividend date (efficient market hypothesis) which \u2018should\u2019 mean people won\u2019t buy in just for the dividend, but people (and the market in general) are irrational and greedy so stocks generally have run-ups prior to special dividends (see price action on RKT, MCFE, AFG, SUTL ect.)\n\nSpecial dividends also signify to the market that the company is being successful \n\nIn addition to this, the stock has low liquidity with an average trading volume of only around 223,000 shares and an institutional ownership of OVER 69%. This means the stock will MOON if only a small amount of people buy in \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBesides the whole special dividend play, ECVT is actually a decent, profitable growth company. Y/Y revenues were up 47% and they posted a profitable quarter of $0.11/share. They manufacture and catalyze chemicals for green tech, which will be a growing industry in the future. I know this play is not about the viability of the company, but this being a decent company takes some of the risk away\n\nAdditionally, options have not priced in ANY pre-dividend volatility, the 8/20 $15C only needs to have the stock go up 0.92% to make money\n\nThe ex. Dividend date for the special dividend is aftermarket 8/11 so I would sell before then\n\nThe record date is on the 12th, so if you are feeling risky you could hold until 8/12 \n\nMy positions: \n\n10 8/20 $15 C, 10 8/20 $17.5 C\n\nTLDR:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/95xleam07jg71.png?width=977&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=00b7ae4a817068e02f300f4602643382f8a22239",

        "selftext": "**TL;DR at bottom.**\n\nHere's your obligatory bear post for the day/week/whatever.\n\nI'm not an expert but I do have some qualifications that lead me to believe that the global economy is in for some trouble.  I could be wrong, of course, and actually my entire theory is predicated on that fact.  Still, I feel I am sure enough in my convictions to the point where this statement is worth making.  You may disagree with the worthiness of this post, and of course, the premise behind it.  That's fine;  I'm just here to share the way I see things.\n\nWhat's certain is that, even if one may see the warning signs of a looming crisis, it's near impossible to tell when that crisis might be.  I have no idea.  All I know is I see some precariousness and warning signs right now.  So, without further ado:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The Uncertain Nature of the World**\n\nThe world is uncertain.  Black swan events happen, and they happen frequently.  Again, some people may have some inkling of them, but it's hard if not impossible to predict these things with any degree of certainty.  Some examples that come to mind (please excuse the lack of chronological ordering): the Covid-19 pandemic, September 11th, the Global Financial Crisis, the John F. Kennedy assassination, Columbus discovering America, the Challenger/Colombia space shuttle disasters, the assassination of Franz Ferdinand leading to WW1, the Great Depression, the Black Death, the storm that destroyed the Spanish Armada, the Wehrmacht crossing the Ardennes, the smart phone / internet revolution, etc.  The last one is interesting if you ever saw *Back to the Future: Pt. 2.*  The most they predicted were flying cars, but not smart phones or internet.\n\nBut I digress.  These events are part and parcel of life, and the major events of history do not happen in a linear fashion.  Sure, we may be able to connect the dots after the fact, but when they happen it's almost unbelievable; we seem to be taken utterly by surprise.  Just think: apart from Bill Gates or someone like that, which one of us normal folk thought we'd be dealing with a pandemic this time 2 years ago?  I certainly didn't imagine it.\n\nAnd it happens in our personal lives too.  You meet someone.  You have a break up.  You get injured.  You get sick.  You lose a loved one.  You fall in love.  Who knows.  Life is very, very unpredictable.\n\nDon't get me wrong; that doesn't mean I don't think we should try.  Science helps. We can form hypotheses and test them.  This adds a lot of certainty to a world that is very uncertain.  But even Einstein would admit that some things are simply out of our grasp:\n\n\"What I see in Nature is a magnificent structure that we can comprehend only very imperfectly, and that must fill a thinking person with a feeling of humility.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The Folly of Economics**\n\nI studied economics.  I was very interested in Econ 101 and decided to make that my major.  Later, however, I was disappointed in what I learned.  I don't know.  There was just too much mathematical formulating and analysis.  I didn't feel, really, that I had learned much of anything that was actually relevant and applicable to the real world.  To be honest, at the time I just thought I was an idiot and bad at math - blaming myself rather than the field, as a young, lost kid might be prone to do.  Looking back, however, I think there were serious shortcomings that I had picked up on but did not have the tools to express.\n\nI'm not saying that there isn't a place for that sort of analysis in the study of economics: I imagine there is.  I just don't think that it should be the singular focus of the whole field.  Indeed, while mathematical equations are imperative for pure math and even for practical applications like physics and chemistry, can they really be applied with the same rigorous veracity to the study of something so complex and changeable as the economy?\n\nFormer economic advisor at the Bank of International Settlements William White argues that instead of looking at the economy through equations and equilibria, we should be viewing the economy as a [complex adaptive system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_adaptive_system#:~:text=A%20complex%20adaptive%20system%20is,the%20behavior%20of%20the%20components.&amp;text=The%20Complex%20Adaptive%20Systems%20approach%20builds%20on%20replicator%20dynamics).  You know, like a garden.  You have an idea in mind of what you want to plant and where, but some plants die, some don't, weeds pop up, there might be an infestation.  The whole thing is quite unpredictable because it depends on an enormous amount of variables interacting with each other.  Well, that's a lot like the economy.  (Read more here: [Recognizing the Economy as a Complex, Adaptive System: Implications for Central Banks](https://williamwhite.ca/2018/04/22/recognizing-the-economy-as-a-complex-adaptive-system-implications-for-central-banks/))\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The Folly of Modern Central Banking**\n\nThe folly here follows naturally from the aforementioned ontological error in the field of economics: we think the economy is predictable and controlable.  Cut interest rates here, buy assets there, and we're good to go.  If only it were that simple.\n\nLook at the data we're looking at right now.  Despite absolutely unprecedented amounts of liquidity being pumped by the Federal Reserve (and by other central banks around the world), we're still unable to get people back to work.  Check out the [ADP numbers](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/04/private-companies-added-330000-jobs-in-july-according-to-adp-far-short-of-the-653000-estimate.html) today: 653,000 new positions were expected in July, but the actual result was a miss of just over half (330,000).  If you've been paying attention to the data in past months as well, you've noticed consistent misses in employment.  And how about inflation?  YoY inflation hikes are expected due to base effects from the pandemic last year, but MoM inflation has been coming in consistently higher than expected.  All of this makes you wonder: does the Fed really have things under control?  *Could* they have things under control?\n\nI would argue that you can't solve structural employment issues by throwing the liquidity at the markets.  The problem is not liquidity, there's plenty of it: the problem is structural mismatches, as well as other factors like people preferring to take extended unemployment rather than working.  You can't fix that with more liquidity.  One of the most respected modern economists, Paul Krugman, would probably say \"well, it can't hurt\".  And according to their models, it can't.  Unfortunately economists and central bankers seem to do be doing their absolute best to turn their blind eye to clear asset bubbles.  SPX is up nearly 48% since pandemic lows less than 18 months ago, while the Nasdaq is up nearly 58% in the same period. Meanwhile the real economy has been absolutely hammered.  The [Shiller PE ratio](https://www.multpl.com/shiller-pe) is at 38.25 at time of writing - a level unseen since prior to the bursting of the dot-cum bubble.  It is clear that there is a severe disconnect between fundamentals and asset prices due to excessive liquidity system.\n\nIf the Fed manages a controlled walk down of interest rates, and earnings continue to grow into current valuations, then no problem, right?  Right.  It's possible.  But that would be hoping for the best.  William White argues that it's more rational to prepare for the worst rather than naively hoping for the best.  A long series of things would have to go according to plan for this bubble to be \"defused\", and any number of unforeseen events could arise in order to knock the whole plan off track.  Some examples come to mind (and these are just the ones that we can fathom... the whole point is that there are more that we probably can't): Delta variant or other Covid-related scares, geopolitical tensions with China/USA/Taiwan, inflation running hotter than expected, etc.\n\nAnd speaking of inflation, why in the world is the Federal Reserve so confident that inflation is transitory?  As I mentioned above, YoY and MoM inflation expectations have come in consistently higher than expectations over the course of the last few months, oftentimes to the tune of 70-80%.  If whoever is making these predictions is getting it so wrong in regards to the numbers, who's to say that they aren't getting it wrong in regards to it being transitory?\n\nLook, it very well may be; the supply chain disruption argument is a valid and strong one.  But nobody has a crystal ball. The Fed is not an all-seeing eye where they can simply predict exactly what is going to happen.  One might hope that the Fed would be more prudent and humble in their analysis of the situation.\n\nAnd certainly the Fed has a long history of getting things wrong.  In early 2007 Ben Bernanke famously declared that subprime was \"contained\".  Just a few months later, when the crisis did begin to arise, Jim Cramer called out Bernanke for \"being an academic\" and for being out of touch with the situation on the ground.  Look, I don't really like Cramer, but I do believe he was in the right at this particular moment.  This sub won't allow me to link it here, but I recommend looking up \"Cramer tells Bernanke to wake up\" on YouTube.  It's worth a watch.\n\nLet's not forget that, even before either of these two events, the Fed absolutely failed to anticipate the crisis in the first place.  Later they would say that such a crisis was unpredictable, and totally based on panic.  But they forget the fact that people like Dr. Michael Burry, of Big Short book and film fam, did see it coming.  All of the people in that book saw it coming.  Even [William White saw it coming, and warned Alan Greenspan of it at Jackson Hole in 2003.](https://www.spiegel.de/international/business/the-man-nobody-wanted-to-hear-global-banking-economist-warned-of-coming-crisis-a-635051.html) The Fed, however, did not see it coming.  Bernanke would also claim that the crisis was nothing more than old-fashioned financial panic, and that if not for the panic it would have been the equivalent of nothing more than \"a bad day in the stock market\".  This is a convenient view for him to take, as it alleviates him of all responsibility for completely bungling the situation.  Even [Paul Krugman challenges Bernanke's assertion that it was all related to financial panic and not at all tied to fundamentals in the housing market](https://www.google.com/search?q=Paul+Krugman+Great+recession+bernanke&amp;oq=paul+krugman+&amp;aqs=chrome.1.69i57j69i59l3j35i39j69i60l3.2811j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8).\n\nOf course, Bernanke and those around him would hold on to their view that nobody could have seen the crisis coming, and go on to congratulate themselves for rescuing the country and the world from a crisis that they themselves had failed to prevent.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Where We Are Today**\n\nAnd that brings us to where we are today, with massive monetary stimulus coming from the Fed and all major central banks as a response to the Covid-19 crisis.  The response to 2008 was seen, rightfully in many ways, as a success.  By injecting liquidity into markets when they needed it most, the Fed and other central banks were able to stave off the next Great Depression.  Unfortunately, however, apart from taking into the account their failure to prevent the crisis in the first place, central banks have also failed to take into account the limitations of their policies.  Not only have their policies become less effective, but they've also opened the door for a dangerous array of unintended consequences (William White talks about both issues [here](https://www.dallasfed.org/~/media/documents/institute/wpapers/2012/0126.pdf)).  William White also says that, contrary to what the Fed seems to believe, monetary policy \"is no free lunch\".\n\nRecovery since 2008 has been asymmetric: we seem to be trying to fix deep, structural problems via simple injections of liquidity. Meanwhile, inequality grows, the poor get poorer, and political and social unrest continue to grow as a result.  It's a dangerous path to go down, and rather than try to explain it myself , I would recommend reading the White paper I linked above.  One clear and present danger I see today, which White mentioned in the paper, is the presence of serial bubbles: the dot-com bubble led to the housing bubble, and the housing bubble has led to the current stock market bubble, only to be aggravated by the Covid crisis and the Fed's response to it (ironically causing a new bubble in the housing market as well).  If something unforeseen were to happen, these bubbles could pop, causing lasting damage to Main Street.\n\nOne issue that I see now is that, if we were to have another crisis, what more could be done?  How much higher can the Fed expand their balance sheet?  How much more deficit spending can the federal government engage in?  I believe that we are dangerously close to exhausting our policy options.\n\nIf everything goes according to plan, it's possible that everything works out just fine.  The issue, however, may be in assuming that everything will go according to plan.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**What To Do as an Investor**\n\nI'm not an expert at this, but I would not tell anyone to go cash right now.  I would say, however, that it may be wise to hold a larger cash percentage than you're normally accustomed to.  If you normally hold 5% in your portfolio, for example, then maybe you'd consider holding 10-15%.  This will provide for buying opportunities in the event that we do have a major correction, and it will also help to preserve capital.  That said, full cash does not seem to be the way to go.  If you're waiting for a crash, you may be waiting forever.\n\nWhat I would recommend, and this seems pertinent to a lot of what I see on this subreddit, is diversification.  I see people with dangerous allocations into overvalued tech stocks (\"buy Microsoft at any valuation\"), holding 3-4 tech stocks as their whole portfolio, a 2-fund portfolio with levered funds UPRO and TQQQ, etc.  I see people holding ARK funds and other \"disruptive\" tech with unproven track records.  I see people recommending lump sums right now, because, \"on average\", they do better.\n\nIf it were me, I would diversify and play it more conservatively.  VOO would be infinitely better than UPRO, for example.  A diversified portfolio of blue-chips which very well may (and should) include stocks like Microsoft would be infinitely better than *only* holding Microsoft.  Patient dollar cost averaging would probably be more wise than dumping one's life savings into an S+P 500 index fund at the moment.\n\nI would also encourage people to look at fundamentals.  One should never, IMO, feel the urge to pay for a stock 30, 35, or 50+ times earnings just because of \"future growth potential\".  It's a gamble.\n\nIn the end, all of these strategies that I am opposed to may end up working out and may even end up doing better than my conservative approach.  The problem, however, is what happens if they don't.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR, Summary, and Final Thoughts**\n\nAs humans we seem to have a problem with humility.  In some ways I think it's painful for us to accept our limitations and fragility.  Thus, it's easier for us to pretend that the world is predictable, orderly, and within our control.  This fallacy has made it's way into the field of economics and by extension into central banks and the Federal Reserve.  Current policies, encouraged by the \"success\" of 2008, operate under the fallacy that the economy is orderly and able to be controlled surgically, rather than admitting the unpredictability of the economy as a complex adaptive system and taking measures to be ready for when black swan events can and do occur.\n\nAs a society and as investors, we can certainly hope for the best, and sometimes the best does manifest itself and such optimism does lead to better outcomes for those who profess it.  However, perhaps a more prudent, realistic approach would be to prepare for the worst, or at the very least recognize our limitations and put measures in place in order to mitigate any potential disruptive events.\n\nGood luck and best wishes to all.",

        "selftext": "This might be a good time to write about this since there is a major sell off and lot of you might think you can buy Chinese stocks for a low price. Cramer might say whatever but it\u2019s your job to research into the stock you buy. \n\nYou don\u2019t actually own the stock of the Chinese company shares that are bought via American or any other world exchanges. CCP laws do now allow foreigners to own shares in a Chinese entity. You actually own shares of a shell company located in the Cayman Islands that has the same name as the Chinese stock you own. This shell company has certain economic agreements with the Chinese company so that the share holders of the shell company get economic benefits. You can read more in the below link. \n\nThis kind of a structure leads to a lot of issues. One of them is low blowing American investors after the Chinese companies becomes profitable. Basically Chinese companies are listed in the US and use US investors capital to become profitable and then are taken private at a low price before re-listing in China for a far higher price. \n\nThen there are risks of the CCP out right invalidating your shell company shares if CCP considers your shares as foreign ownership. This depends on how the shell company shares are related to the Chinese company. Most of the shell companies are shown as a subsidiary of the Chinese company. So the CCP can consider owning shares of a shell company of a Chinese company subsidiary as foreign ownership and invalidate those shares. The below Bloomberg link has more about this as well. \n\nAnd then there are accounting issues. The standards of listed Chinese and American company accounting requirements are different. We already have an example for this - luckin coffee. \n\nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-07-07/owning-chinese-companies-is-complicated",

        "selftext": "Listen up retards, this won't be short.\n\nThis was not meant for you apes; Seek ing alpha denied my article because they don't want recent SPACs merger on their website.\n\nSo instead of earning cash to spend it on stupid shit, I'm here wasting my time for you all because I don't want 50 hours and 4000 words of research to go to waste, let me tell you gamblers why Microvast ($MVST) is a Hidden gem.\n\nFirst of all, you retards probably came for the short squeeze potential, rumor has it, there's not many shares left to short sell and Microvast is down 60% from its peak (even after yesterday's 20%+ run), but I could not care less about that, MVST will trade significantly higher once decent analysts start coverage on it and this post will tell you why. You guys are so lucky to have found this now, I've been holding since November when it was $11, so the price right now is still dirt cheap (it was $15 two weeks ago...).\n\nQuick introduction for those of you who don\u2019t know what Microvast is and what it does. Microvast is a technology innovator for Li-ion batteries that designs, develops and manufactures battery systems for commercial electric vehicles and energy storage that feature ultra-fast charging capabilities, long life and superior safety. Microvast believes the ultra-fast charging capabilities of its battery systems make charging electric vehicles as convenient as fueling conventional vehicles and believes the long battery life of its battery systems reduces the total cost of ownership of electric vehicles.\n\nMicrovast is expected to grow at a compounded annual growth rate of 87%, their estimates are justified by the growing desire for electrification as well as the growing demand for clean energy and the zero-carbon revolution.\n\nThe forecasted battery components revenues (see picture below) come from Microvast being vertically integrated. Their battery components are world-class, significantly differentiating and they are going to sell those parts to some key cell manufacturers in the passenger EV market (specifically their aramid separator and their gradient cathode). They currently ship to passenger vehicle applications (SAIC) but are also engaging with passenger OEMs that have made the announcement that they will manufacture their own batteries (with battery components)\\[1\\]. They also plan to do the same thing with consumer electronics.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/alqqdfwu0qf71.png?width=359&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f607dd17a8b1c6817205d2e9b561ca0c22eb26dc\n\nMicrovast's projected revenues\n\nWhile their projections may seem optimistic, they were able to secure partnerships with industry leaders representing over $1.5 Bn in contracted revenue through 2027. $44 millions, $125 millions, $172 millions, $250 millions, and $355 millions for 2021, 2022, 2023, 2024, and 2025 respectively. Those numbers were before they recently announced a partnership with eVersum, a high-tech vehicle OEM, specialized in the design, development, and build of the most purposely engineered electric commercial vehicles for passenger transport. The deal has a potential volume forecasted to be more than 100 million \u20ac.\n\nThere\u2019s a great interview on [cheddar news](https://cheddar.com/media/microvast-goes-public-on-nasdaq-via-spac) with Shane Smith, COO of Microvast, where he talks about why Microvast went public and raised more than $800 million: \u201cWe raised capital to support orders we already had in place. We\u2019ve won more business than we\u2019ve had capacity for\u201d. It seems like Microvast has a great problem; the demand is bigger than the supply at the moment, which is great news as they may not need to spend a lot on marketing if customers are coming to them directly.\n\n\\- Microvast has over a decade of expertise in designing and manufacturing battery components (Cells, electrolytes, packs, separators). That differentiates them from most of the other battery makers who source their components from the vendors. It is important to note the cell makers do not have the right to produce the material that they did not invent or have the license for. \u201cMicrovast invented and manufactures the key battery materials to ensure unique performance and by also guaranteeing the leading time because the material patents are the strongest patents, legally protected and our success is founded on our deep technology portfolio which is wholly owned and protected by over 550 patents (and patent applications)\u201d, said Dr. Mattis, Chief Technology Officer of the company.\n\n\\- They have more than 1800 employees including more than 500 employees in the R&amp;D division.\n\n\\- They have 28000+ Battery systems in operation in 19 different countries.\n\n\\- More than 3.8Bn Miles of operational distance was covered with no major safety incidents.\n\n\\- Their Batteries can run at a high temperature for a long time and they won\u2019t explode. They have this proprietary way for their Batteries to be 90% as efficient as brand-new ones after 10,000 charges.\n\n\\- Among all of Microvast\u2019s products, two stands out that no one else in the world has: the 100% Aramid separator and the full concentration of the grading of the material.\n\no \u201cOne of the perks for the solid-state battery is on shrinking separators and with our Aramid separator, we are there\u201d, Dr Wenjuan Mattis said in the Wedbush conference held on April 8th2021. For the fans of solid-state batteries, this could be a major catalyst incoming. Their Aramid separator has higher thermal stability than charged cathode material; 2X the temperature resistance of traditional poly-ethylene separators, enhancing safety and charging time.\n\no \u201cWe have almost 15 patents in solid-state batteries, it\u2019s one of the three advanced technologies that we\u2019re working on\u201d, said COO Shane Smith. 15 might not look like a lot compared to QuantumScape, which holds over 200 patents and patent applications related to solid-state battery technology, but they operate in different markets, MVST in commercial vehicle batteries and QS more in the passenger EV batteries. Also, it\u2019s important to mention that they are not really competitors at the moment, Microvast generated about $ 107 million in sales in 2020 and is expecting to generate more than $2 billion in sales in 2025 compared to QuantumScape, which will not generate meaningful revenues until 2026, according to the website \u201c[barrons.com](https://barrons.com/)\u201d.\n\n\\- The other material, the full concentration grid in the cathode, is a unique material made by Microvast. With this technology, they can tune the distribution of the transition metals across the particles, which allows them to maximize the capacity and maintain safety and at the same time minimize the cost and the risk by reducing the cobalt content. The material has a capacity 20% higher than the best material in the market and is 10% lower in cost. They have a production line that has been making 600 tons per year (for the past 3 years).\n\n**Partnership/Customers**\n\n\\- They have solid partnerships, including FPT (the global powertrain brand of CNH Industrial Group), Oshkosh (leading global innovator of mission-critical vehicles and essential equipment), Porsche, SAIC, and many more. Oshkosh also made a $25MM strategic investment in the PIPE, and signed joint development agreement highlighting future battery collaboration and integration. It is worth mentioning that Oshkosh received the USPS contract to replace its mail delivery trucks (the initial contract is. worth $482 million). Also, it is an open contract, meaning USPS will be able to order more vehicles throughout the 10-year contract ([they will order between 50,000 and 165,000 vehicles](https://www.oshkoshcorp.com/en/news/2-23-21-usps)). This is a lot of potential business for Microvast and could represent a serious catalyst in the future once more information is available. Oshkosh expects to start production in 2023, right when Microvast\u2019s factory in Tennessee will be up and running. Remember, MVST went from $14 to $23 the day Oskosh got the USPS contract, this will definitely be a HUGE catalyst once we know more about it.\n\n\\- They can count as their customers some of the leading global bus OEMs including Yutong, Higer, Foton, King Long, VDL, and Wright Bus. Their batteries are being deployed across a broad range of commercial vehicles, including automated guided vehicles, port equipment, mining trucks, fork-lift\u00a0trucks. They also have customer relationships with the likes of Kion, Kalmar, KoneCranes, Linde, PSA Singapore, and Gaussin. All of these names are recognized as leading OEMs in their particular area of focus.\n\n**Key advantages over its competitors**\n\nMicrovast is very unique in itself and it is hard to compare them with other public companies; some are fairly young compared to them and others are well established but operate in the passenger EV battery market and it is unclear when/if they will shift towards the manufacturing of commercial EV batteries.\n\nTheir closest competitor is probably \\*\\*\\* had to get rid of this competitor (market cap under 1bill) but the short answer is that MVST is 10 times better...\n\nIf we do a quick head-to-head comparison, we can see Microvast seems to have a clearer path to achieve its Revenue goals.\n\n\\*\\*\\* is headquartered in Los Angeles with a factory of 113K sq.ft compared to Microvast with its biggest factory in China (1.72MM sq.ft.), another one in Germany (170K sq.ft.), and one in the United States in 2022 (577K sq.ft.). In contrast, \\*\\*\\* has more than 200 employees and Microvast is expected to hire around 300 employees only for their new factory in Tennessee and they also have more than 500 employees working in the R&amp;D division as mentioned before.\n\nIt looks like Microvast is better positioned to profit from global electrification with their factories established in three different parts of the world.\n\nThe picture below shows both their year-over-year revenues growth, which could be a bit misleading as they are not in the same business stage and operate in different continents for now. China and Europe lead the United States in electric commercial vehicles on the road, which could explain the difference.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/e6wzhoey0qf71.png?width=297&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=77984dcaac9f5762f2edc3dd7fc971418dfa0ed7\n\nBut the point I want to make here is that they rely on different things, \\*\\*\\* miss on revenues is due to the short-term limited number of battery cell providers, producing safe, high-performance cells suitable for the commercial electric vehicle market. \u201cWe know, we, and the whole industry, need more cells\u201d, said the CEO of \\*\\*\\* in their latest earnings call. Whereas Microvast produces their own cells, relying more on the primary resources. See the picture below for Microvast 2021 projected Revenues as well as \\*\\*\\* forecasted and revised revenues.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hbp0ee4x0qf71.png?width=253&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=23295bd6c127a150fb07bdfec94a2a814a5fc752\n\nOn the other hand, it is true that Microvast did not have earnings call yet to discuss their 2021 outlook but I believe they are in line to achieve their projected revenues. They had \\~ $107 MM in revenues in 2020 and if they keep the same YoY growth rate of 115% (Q1 2020 \u00e0 Q1 2021), they will get to $230 MM by the end of the year. The key differentiator here is that Microvast manufactures their own cells, which ensures high quality, faster product development, greater customization to client needs, and tighter cost control as well as higher margins. The fact that Microvast has its own in-house manufacturing capacity is a clear competitive advantage to my eyes (see picture below, found on Microvast website).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nkrsbv1r0qf71.png?width=468&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a77943b9313e8bdb0ce659885fc94ab870543332\n\nBoth of these companies are currently highly valued based on their potential and future expected revenues. At their current market cap, \\*\\*\\* is selling at an estimated 2021 P/S ratio between 23 and 51 and MVST with an estimated 2021 P/S ratio of about 12. Once again, these two companies are not at the same business stage and I believe they will both succeed and grow at an impressive pace, however, MVST\u2019s growth perspective and business model seem less risky and more predictable.\n\nI have a conservative 2023 Price target on MVST of $25 (that was for Seeking Alpha, let's be real here $25 is legit fair value for Microvast, it should trade at a premium for all its potential not a discount), which is more than a 200% increase from its current price of about 8$ and $25 also happens to be their 52 week-high. My price target is based on discounted 2023 revenues and a P/S ratio of 12 (85% of forecasted 2023 revenues (85%\\*751MM) \\* 12 = \\~$7,5 billion market cap). Considering their direct competitor is currently more expensive (P/S between 23-51) and other companies operating in a similar sector are trading at high valuations: Tesla (\\~20 P/S), Pro terra (\\~11 P/S), QuantumScape (Market cap of 9.5B without revenues yet), and Nikola (Market cap of \\~4B without revenues yet), Microvast can be considered as fairly cheap and this price target of $25 as conservative. It could easily go to $40 is what I meant.\n\n**TAM is estimated to be $30Bn + in 2025**\n\n\u00b7 Battery providers are expected to play a pivotal role in the EV value chain: \\~ 30-40% of EV value resides in the battery.\n\n\u00b7 The rotation from gas-powered commercial vehicles to electric-powered commercial vehicles might happen quicker than the rotation from gas passenger cars to electric passenger cars because of government funding. Also, with the lithium shortage, the world will have to mine more lithium but it would not make sense to use powered-gas trucks to mine to then build electric batteries for a greener future, I believe the U.S government as well as the other governments, will make sure we use clean energy to mine lithium or any other natural resources, which would benefit Microvast.\n\n\u00b7 The demand is bigger than the supply at the moment with battery cell production in the U.S. just below 40 GWh in 2020, while battery demand exceeded 42 GWh. For context, achieving President Biden\u2019s goal of a 100% electric fleet of U.S. government vehicles will require 69 GWh of battery cells. I believe Microvast is well-positioned to become a giant in the industry with their new factories; they planned ahead, which could give them a competitive advantage over their competitors.\n\n\u00b7 EV Battery market is believed to be at a key inflection point (EV is 1.5% of 2020 sales \u2013 8.5% by. 2025), which equals to an expected CAGR of 55% (based on sales in key markets: U.S, Europe, China, Japan &amp; South Korea). Source: [Microvast investors presentation](https://microvast.com/app/uploads/2021/07/investor-presentation.pdf).\n\n\u00d8 There is a profound energy transition toward renewable energy driven by governmental policies that are synchronized for the first time, according to Frederique Carrier in the [RBC Global insight May 2021](https://www.rbcinsight.com/WM/Share/ResearchViewer/?SSS_550F5749FFF0E40F2A81B69264610173).\n\no The European Green Deal refocused the EU\u2019s COVID-19 stimulus package onto renewables -charging infrastructure, power generation, and green hydrogen projects (allocating up to $600 billion to green projects).\n\no China\u2019s 14th Five-Year Plan called for electric vehicles to constitute 20 percent of overall new car sales in China by 2021 from just 5% now (spending up to $1.5 trillion).\n\no Joe Biden won the U.S presidential election with a sweeping infrastructure program (up to $2 trillion).\n\no Microvast is well diversified in these three growing markets with its biggest factory in China (1.72MM sq.ft.), one in Germany (170K sq.ft.), and another one in production in the United States (577K sq.ft., expected to start production in 2022).\n\n\\- According to Shelby Tucker, RBC Capital Markets, LLC Utilities Analyst, the global market for batteries has the potential to grow 100 times by 2050.\n\nAlso, great find by [u/Little\\_Objective\\_683/](https://www.reddit.com/user/Little_Objective_683/) : The U.S department of energy (DOE) asked Microvast in 2019 to build a Li-ion battery facility in the United States to fulfill Microvast's biggest order to date, which will make Microvast the largest American Li-ion Manufacturer.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7n6py2q11qf71.jpg?width=315&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3e40ba583ed4d5027fcb52d24d696a9eda469102\n\n**Global market presence**\n\nAfter primarily being focused on the PRC and Asia-Pacific regions, they are expanding their presence and product promotion to Europe and the United States to capitalize on the rapidly growing electrification markets. In 2021, they will be launching a marketing campaign to introduce Microvast to more potential customers in regions outside the Asia Pacific region and adding more headcounts to support business development ([source: Sec.gov; DEF14 form](https://sec.report/Document/0001213900-21-035581/defm14a_tuscanholdings.htm)).\n\nThe European market presents enormous growth opportunities for electric vehicles, driven by higher emission standards, reduced total cost of ownership compared to gas-based combustion engines, and growing environmental awareness. In the United States, they believe a new political administration is likely to push the electrification revolution through regulation. In pursuing contract opportunities with industry-leading companies in the United States, they have seen how their potential customers recognize the lower total cost of ownership for commercial vehicles and are seeking alternative forms of energy for energy storage applications.\n\nAs they expand their presence globally, they will continue to invest in their existing partnerships in the PRC and the Asia Pacific region and continue to grow their business there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/00irgk431qf71.png?width=468&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=49bb262a01b29c15a45b58813e286e382434220e\n\n\\- Revenues in Europe decreased by about 22% while Revenues in PRC increased by more than 260%\n\n\\- I believe the decrease in Europe is temporary and was caused by the pandemic, since it affected the whole industry, as Panasonic mentioned in their latest earnings report. and with the new factory in Germany, it will become more convenient for European companies to try and buy Microvast\u2019s products. According to the website [iea.org](https://www.iea.org/), new electric car registrations were about 3 million globally in 2020 and for the first time, Europe led with 1.4 million new registrations followed by China with 1.2 million and the United States with 295 000 new electric cars.\n\n**Bear Case**\n\nI could not find solid bear cases anywhere on Microvast other than \u201cit\u2019s a Chinese company, stay away\u201d or \u201cinsiders are dumping shares on you, get out\u201d.\n\nLet\u2019s talk about the latter quickly.

The Registration Rights and Lock-Up\u00a0Agreement further provides that the shares owned by the Sponsor Group will be subject to a lock-up. Specifically, with respect to 75% of the shares owned by the Sponsor Group, (a) 2/3rds\u00a0of such shares are subject to a one-year\u00a0lock-up\u00a0unless the shares trade at $12.50 or above for any 20 trading days within a 30-trading\u00a0day period and (b) the remaining 1/3rd\u00a0of such shares are subject to a one-year\u00a0lock-up. With respect to the remaining 25% of the shares owned by the Sponsor Group, (a) 50% of such shares are locked-up\u00a0until the later of the one-year\u00a0anniversary of the Closing and the date on which the shares trade at $12.00 or above for any 20 trading days within a 30-trading\u00a0day period, (b) the remaining 50% of such shares are locked-up\u00a0until the later of the one-year\u00a0anniversary of the Closing and the date on which the shares trade at $15.00 or above for any 20 trading days within a 30-trading\u00a0day period and (c) all of such shares are subject to forfeiture if such trading targets are not met by the fifth anniversary of the Closing.\u201d.\n\nIn other words, insiders are not \u201cdumping shares on us\u201d at a price of about $8 (now $10) because of their lock-up agreement.\n\nShould you fear Microvast because it is a Chinese company? Perma bulls will tell you it is not a Chinese company as it is headquartered and founded in Houston, Texas. In reality, it really is a Chinese battery maker coming public through an American SPAC, [according to Dana Blankenhorn](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/tuscan-holdings-is-gaining-traction-but-where-is-microvast-coming-from-2021-02-10) (let's not argue about this fellow retards, it doesn't really matter; China is years ahead of the U.S in EV). If you were on vacation the past couple of weeks, here\u2019s what happened with the Chinese stocks:\n\n\\- A crackdown on education has spread to Chinese tech stocks and the whole Chinese market (MSCI China index delivered negative returns of -14% in July).\n\n\\- Investors fear the unpredictability of the Chinese government, which could explain the 40% drop in MVST share price in a month.\n\nSo, the question is, should you be greedy when others are fearful as Warren Buffet said? Or should you panic sell after a 40% drop in a month?\n\nHere\u2019s what UBS Chief Investment Officer Mark Haefel had to say on China:\n\n\u201cFor the tech sector, Beijing remains focused on its long-term goal of technological self-sufficiency and leadership on the global stage. We believe the regulatory risk will continue in the socially sensitive sectors of property. And healthcare, we don\u2019t expect the government will push these sectors to non-profit either\u201d. Another important part that Mark Haefel discussed is directly related to Microvast: \u201cOffshore equities are pricing in a higher risk premium. This is likely to linger in the near term. However, we think Future returns will be largely driven by earnings growth (mainly from cyclical and value sectors) this year. We recommend investors cherry-pick stocks across sectors that are supported by earnings growth but have limited regulatory risk exposure. Our preferred sectors include consumer durables and services, energy, and Greentech.\u201d\n\nIn the short term, who knows where the stock price can go, however, if Microvast delivers on their promises, we will most likely see abnormal returns. I understand the risk of companies operating in China, but what I particularly like about Microvast is that they are diversifying away from China with their factory in Germany and one incoming in the United States, they will be on three different continents, which is worth something to my eyes.\n\nLet\u2019s summarize what has been said before with a SWOT Analysis\n\nSWOT AnalysisStrengths:\n\n\u00d8 Unlike competitors who redesign existing batteries to fit them in EVs, Microvast has designed its batteries from the ground up specifically to address the problems facing EV batteries. Every step of the manufacturing process is controlled by Microvast, leading to higher quality and lower-cost products.\n\n\u00d8 Researchers from Microvast have developed a novel high-power battery technology that has a higher energy density, longer life, and safer operation than any other state-of-the-art lithium-ion battery on the market. The system is built from four breakthrough technologies and could potentially be used in plug-in hybrid electric vehicle and fully electric vehicle markets. Because of its many benefits, the technology has the potential to also enhance the performance of lithium-ion batteries used in cell phones and other smaller-scale applications, as well as in electric grid applications.\n\n\u00d8 $ 1.5B total contracted revenue in Pipeline through 2027, which will help Microvast to grow revenue at an expected CAGR of 87% from 2020-2025E\n\nWeaknesses:\n\n\u00d8 Being a \u201cChinese company\u201d, U.S investors might not like it as much as a U.S company.\n\n\u00d8 Portfolio Managers being scared of investing in SPACs or even the \u201cdeSPACs phase \u201cafter the SPACs controversy in the beginning of 2021.\n\nOpportunities:\n\n\u00d8 There is three substantial untapped markets that Microvast plans on expanding their products offering to; Passenger Vehicles (PV), Energy Storage Solutions (ESS), and Battery Components (Consumer Electronics), which could expand their TAM by $45B.\n\n\u00d8 2021: Begin Battery Production in the area of Berlin, Germany\n\n\u00d8 2022: Begin Battery Production in Clarksville, TN\n\nThreats:\n\n\u00d8 Susceptible to disruption, many companies are trying to improve EV batteries and might not need Microvast in the foreseeable future.\n\n\u00d8 The Prices of Lithium-ion batteries have been plummeting over the past decade, and that trend is expected to continue in the coming years, which could impact Microvast\u2019s profit margin.\n\n\u00d8 Other companies are working hard on lowering EV battery costs, one or more of them could make a battery substantially cheaper than Microvast.\n\nTo conclude, I believe the growth opportunity in the commercial EV battery sector is impressive as well as somewhat predictable as it makes sense for companies to go electric economically, financially, and environmentally. Microvast is well-positioned to capture a great portion of the total addressable market of $30 Bn and has the opportunity to dramatically increase their TAM if they expand their business to consumer electronics, passenger EV batteries, and energy storage solutions market. The fact that Microvast went public through a SPAC merger less than a week ago gives retail investors an edge to generate alpha as analysts have not started to cover the company yet. Microvast also fits the criteria of sustainable investing, a trend that is not about to die anytime soon. Overall, Microvast has everything it needs to become a successful company; it now just needs to deliver on its promises.\n\nSo, the real question is: does the upside outweigh the downside?\n\nYou tell me.\n\n\\*\\*Disclaimer\n\nI own shares and warrants of MVST.\n\nI am not a financial advisor, this should not be used as financial advice.\n\n\\[1\\] Wedbush presentation 4/8/2021",

It's August already, GME is still in lower hundreds, and I feel obliged to make my next move. After several weeks of thoughtful consideration and research, I have finally made a decision to...\n\n\\[Double down\\](https://imgur.com/a/zlXWOOh) on my bet, like any decent retard residing in this cozy place would do.\n\nBut first things first, let's revise the original bet, \\[the underlying post and analysis\\](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nc6qi3/lets\\_revive\\_the\\_buried\\_wsb\\_culture\\_gme\\_to/).\n\n(I\u2019m not a financial advisor, just a retard who enjoys writing big texts and making risky bets)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Chapter I. The short, the squeeze, and the ugly manipulation\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOk, so a couple(ish) of moths ago I handcrafted that TA thesis (on which the beard bet is based) for GME price action and its potential move to lower thousands as the short squeeze progresses:\n\n*Processing img 5sldutzq33j71...*\n\nThe thesis above was not a generic 'you are here' type of posts you got used to seeing occasionally here and there through the last half a year. Rather, it was a fair attempt to critically assess the stonk's technical setup through the prism of the two most famous SS historical examples:\n\n*Processing img h7b6sm9t43j71...*\n\n*Processing img iz041qtv43j71...*\n\n  \n\\[The OC post and analysis\\](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nc6qi3/lets\\_revive\\_the\\_buried\\_wsb\\_culture\\_gme\\_to/) (which is still worth your reading, especially if you want to grasp this chapter of the post in greater detail) took me a lot of effort to produce, and I am still proud to have done this work, distilling the essential components of a short squeeze structure, and creating at least some sort of a framework to apply in cases like the current one. However, GME price during the summer did not follow the pattern, and particularly its most anticipated triangular 'Squieezluminati Confirmed' stage.\n\n*Processing img ncwwuqz253j71...*\n\n  \nDoes it render the whole thing void? Well, that's what I've been thinking in August while morally preparing myself for the beard apostasy. But something didn't quiet fit, and I kept digging. Just to stumble upon this:\n\n*Processing img 58sg96eg53j71...*\n\nLooks familiar, doesn't it? Ladies and apemen, with a great pleasure I present you AMCSS, the timing of which is really similar to what I was betting my beard on in relation to GME. What happened to AMC during the summer actually proves almost every single point from my SS thesis. Firstly, the 'Purple Haze' level ($14.38) is the main resistance on the chart, and only when the breakout occurs, the SS unfolds. Secondly, 'Squeezy Grail' (the cup shaped consolidation) and the 'Runway' (rectangle) phases precede the squeeze impulse - that's where the buying pressure accumulates, to the point when it can no longer be suppressed. Next, interestingly enough, trend based Fibonacci periods grid allows to predict the peak date (vertical line marked as 1) extremely accurately, if the preliminary trend + the 'Squeezy Grail' phase are used as its core measurement (red dashed line). But wait, there's more! The 'Purple Haze' resistance is in between 1 and 0.786 Fibo levels (horizontal), while the retracement itself measures the amplitude of the SS impulse perfectly - e.g. take a look at how the price action retraces to 0.5 Fibo after the peak, or how the price consolidates in the channel of 0.236-0.382 after that. Well, the thesis fits almost perfectly to AMC - I hope you're now sitting like\n\n*Processing img nltp4a1l53j71...*\n\nThere are several minor deviations from the SS frameworks which should be mentioned too, though: the PH breakout occurs during 0.618 Fibo period, rather than 0.382, as it was in historical examples; the triangular phase doesn't really resemble a triangle. Notwithstanding those minor factors, original SS thesis is more than alive with the AMC example.\n\nYou might be thinking now: what defuq is this crazy dude is talking about, where is the video of the beard shaved? Well, I'm providing the AMCSS analysis here in order to prove that my thesis is legitimate, and GME price action had to follow the pattern. GME and AMC are like brothers in arms, with 'similar' fundamentals, and through the major part of 2021 those two have been moving in tandem, strongly following linear correlation principle. The thesis structure (built upon TSLA and VW historical examples) indicates that there is the strong buying pressure accumulating, and in AMC example the lid was opened for a bit to let the steam out; while GME is still being suppressed even further during the current consolidation, and in my opinion - it is done artificially and purposely.\n\nFurthermore, take a look at this:\n\n*Processing img 44m2qp2q53j71...*\n\n  \nWhat you see above is the screenshot from \\[my other post\\](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nwub7d/gme\\_to\\_amc\\_and\\_bb\\_last\\_week\\_ladies\\_go\\_first\\_gme/), where I explained that two stonks had extremely similar technical setups: both have long-ass triangular consolidation at the core, which is subsequently broken out to the upside. Next, take a look at MACDs or TSIs from both examples, and particularly at what is highlighted by rectangles - zoom in and see for yourself, the structures are close to being identical. So, the question arises: why if two stocks have very similar fundamental and technical backgrounds, one is allowed to moon a little bit, while the other one is being knocked out each time right before the lift off should occur? The answer if fairly obvious, and it's because some big financial boys want things to go this way. AMC is something they can control, or maybe they even benefit from it\u2019s price fluctuations. While GME is a Pandora box, and they try to keep its lid close for as long as possible, soothed by an illusion of a controllable chaos. And those suckers are ready to use any method to suppress the price, especially \\*\\*insert Aliens Guy meme here\\*\\*: manipulation.\n\nApes from a friendly sub uncovered many such methods, like good old FTDs, married puts, OTC trades, wash sales, darkpools... I'm not going to discuss those things in this post, because there is a plenty of outstanding DD on reddit. I'm just going to borrow this picture from u/AutoDrafter2020 because it speaks for itself, in my opinion:\n\n*Processing img klztgzo563j71...*\n\nAs you can see yourself, every major piece of fundamentally good news for GME has resulted in price suppression, and each of the dirty play instruments mentioned above played a role in this shitshow to one degree or another. The manipulation is so blatantly obvious that it makes me sick. Manipulating the market is not cheap, and probably costs fuckers on the other side of the trade millions, if not billions every month. Why would there be so much effort and resources put into the war over a \u2018memestonk\u2019? Is it so that they want some random noname reddit retard to lose his precious beard? The actual answer is shocking, and in my opinion it should be sought in two Greek letters, **\u03c3 (sigma)** and **\u03b2 (beta**).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Chapter II. How 1987 and 2008 are reincarnating into 2021\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPepperidge apes should remember that during one of the Gamestop congressional hearings Vlad 'the Stock Implaler' Tenev mentioned something about late January events falling into five-sigma category, which scientifically speaking corresponds to a p-value, or probability, of 3x10-7, or about 1 in 3.5 million. He also used such a hackneyed expression as a 'black swan' event. Quote from a \\[Bloomberg article\\](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-02-19/gamestop-hearing-robinhood-is-cool-but-is-it-out-of-its-depth):  \n\n\n&gt;A \u201cblack swan\u201d event \u2014 made famous by Nassim Nicholas Taleb in a best seller that parsed the role of randomness in finance and life \u2014 comes as a surprise, has great impact and later becomes rationalized away as easily explained or predicted. *Many things that appear to be black swans, however, aren\u2019t unforeseeable and are merely classified as such to avoid responsibility for not spotting them ahead of time in the first place*. A \u201cfive-sigma event\u201d is a statistical descriptor of something that occurs five standard deviations away from and on either side of the mean in a data set. It describes the odds of something happening, and in five-sigma territory the odds are long.\n\n  \nCategorizing January craze as five sigma is debatable to say the least, because Gamestop shares started to skyrocket and multiply in price long before late January, and it doesn't take a lot of wrinkles to understand that the volatility should likely increase further, requiring additional collateral and somewhat decent risk management. However, I'm not going to discuss Vlad's choice of sacrificing Robbinhood users (disabling buy button) in order to protect the solvency of Robbinhood customers (Citadel and co), because that has been done enough times already, and the North remembers. Rather, Robbinhood example and Vlad's interpretation are provided here as a vivid illustration of the fact which we all feel deep inside: there is just too much risk in the market, it is being too much fucking over-leveraged so that even a fucking retail stock broker may easily get margin-called in a matter of hours. It is especially hilarious, considering the fact that unsophisticated actions of buying and holding a particular stock is enough to fuck the system, making the entire house of cards fall apart. The problem is that when you dive deeper, 2008 seem to be a blessing.  \n\n\nFor example, let's start from the easy difficulty, take a look at this chart:\n\n*Processing img 47plfcth63j71...*\n\nOne of the major indicators of how the leverage is utilized is FINRA's margin statistics from its members (who carry margin accounts for customers), which FINRA publishes every month. There are several points of interest for us on the chart above. The first and the most important one is that margin dept has tripled after previous major bottom in 2009, from about $300 billions to almost $900 bn in 2021. Furthermore, take a look at how MD reaches the peak of $500 bn both in 2000 and 2007, and it's sufficient to send S&amp;P into several years bear market with 50% retrace, as soon as the leveraging trend reverses. Currently, MD is on its way to trilly, the figure has almost doubled compared to 2000 and 2007. Sounds a bit GUHy, doesn't it? Also, looking at the margin debt before the .com bubble, 2007 financial crisis and Covid crash it can be seen that, each time, the margin contraction starts before the crash itself, making MD a leading indicator. And guess what? MD is down 4.3% in July, which is the first major decline in 15 months. Deleveraging is a painful process, but is necessary for markets\u2019 health, and it seem to have already begun.\n\nHowever, this time it is going to be so much fucking worse. To quote a brilliant mind, u/Criand:  \n\n\n&gt;2008 never finished. It was can-kicked and the same people who caused the crash have still been running rampant doing the same bullshit in the derivatives market as that market continues to be unregulated. They're profiting off of short-term gains at the risk of killing their institutions and potentially the global economy.\n\nI strongly recommend you reading his informative 2008 post in full, because it is a fascinating financial journey, through which you will learn a lot about how fuk the financial system really is right now, largely because of leverage. Imagine if r/WallStreetBets was a central bank. Fuck, this must be the most spot on metaphor I came up with in my entire life. Actually, it seems now that the entire financial world is one fucking giant WSB right now. And not in the good sense of its reputation.\n\nTo quote another brilliant mind, u/peruvian_bull, whose series of posts has been peer-reviewed by an economics professor:  \n\n\n&gt;The entire derivatives market is HUGE. The BIS estimated the total notional value of the OTC derivatives market to be $640 Trillion in 2019! And that doesn't even include exchange-listed derivatives like most common option contracts. More sober estimates put it somewhere north of $1 Quadrillion. Numbers of this size are hard to wrap your head around - this is equivalent to a million billion, or a thousand trillion- for reference, the US economy is around $22 Trillion and the world economy is estimated to be $88 Trillion - thus the entire world economy could fit into the notional derivatives market 11x over and STILL not reach it. Every single bank is exposed, either directly or indirectly, to this market. For example, Deutsche Bank ALONE has over $47 Trillion in Notional gross exposure - TWICE the size of the entire US Economy!\n\n*Processing img enhgxe0773j71...*\n\n*Intermediate TL;DR: the financial market is sufficiently levered according to its risk tolerance, and we all know what comes after that:*\n\n*Processing img 2pb2k9qv63j71...*\n\nThis represents what Buffet called \u201cA Time Bomb\u201d in the market - as long as money flows in, the party continues. Once it stops, the Weapons of Financial Destruction are unleashed. As you may remember, something like that happened in 2008, when predatory lending targeting low-income homebuyers, excessive risk-taking by global financial institutions,\n\n*Processing img xct7amb273j71...*\n\nand the burst of the US housing bubble culminated in a perfect shitstorm. MBSs (Mortgage Backed Securities) tied to American real estate, as well as a vast web of linked to those MBSs CDOs, collapsed in value. As a result, financial institutions worldwide suffered severe damage, the GDP contracted sharply, the unemployment rates rose significantly, pushing millions of people into poverty - largely because some greedy bastards who had too much of financial power based on over-abused leverage and close to zero risk management made all the wrong decisions they could.\n\nThanks God, they promised not to do that again!\n\n*Processing video 1rflh5jy33j71...*\n\n  \n\\*\\*In Tyler\u2019s voice\\*\\* So that was a fucking lie:\n\n*Processing img f9xgxitt73j71...*\n\nThe figures above provide the relatively up-to-date exposure of the the biggest commercial banks towards derivatives. Although, we shouldn\u2019t expect that those numbers allow to calculate somewhat precise leverage ratios, inasmuch as many of these derivative obligations net each other out, rendering the real value of the debt to be a bit more modest (or maybe not, who knows what\u2019s really going on OTC). What is safe to assume, however, is that based on the numbers above, the leverage ratio is still in double digits at least for the biggest and most systemically important banks. From the recent infamous Archegos example, we saw that playing with leverage-amplifying synthetic market instruments (total return swaps in Bill Hwang\u2019s case) is like playing with matches - and it will almost certainly lead to dire consequences at some point in time. Poor Bill just was the first one to run out of luck.\n\nAnother important factor to bear in mind, is that those professional financial ANALysts seem to follow a similar risks assessment approach that is used by an average WSB retard buying FDs. No, I\u2019m not kidding, they literally stick to a bit more sophisticated version of a famous postulate: \u2018Stonks only go up\u2019. We are talking about VaR, or Value at Risk models. u/peruvian_bull managed to explain this complex stuff in a brilliant way in his series of posts dedicated to the highly probable upcoming financial market fiasco (fascinating reading - in this part of the series, 1987 famous crash is discussed and how derivatives and improper risks assessment exacerbated it):\n\n*Processing img zfh3tjyk83j71...*\n\n&gt;Even to this day, Regulators, and indeed even financial industry insiders, are completely blind to the risk. OTC Derivatives are essentially unregulated - NO ONE knows the true size of this market. Worse yet, the traders inside the bank are using optimistic versions of the Efficient Market Hypothesis and VaR models to estimate their risk, which comes out to essentially 0 due to the risk models and net exposure hedging. Thus, they pile on more risk every day, ensuring that this problem continues to grow - until the entire system explodes.\n\n  \nNo wonder, that in such a financial environment as described above, cases like GME would be given a five-sigma label. The best analogy to describe current financial market conditions would be a castle made of sand, when one sea wave of a higher magnitude can easily crash the whole thing into the dirt; or a house of cards, when just one stronger blow of the wind will trigger a chain reaction and demolish it to the fundament. The current status quo is not self-sustainable, and very soon it will become also a not FED-sustainable. The markets have been artificially supported by the money supply expansion for too long, currently resembling a drugs addict, who can\u2019t live without the always following stimulus \u201cdose\u201d. As soon as liquidity dries up for a brief moment (sucked in by some negative beta bad boy), or the FED blinks... I guess, we\u2019ll find out really soon what happens then.\n\nTo conclude and sum up the second chapter, quoting u/peruvian_bull again:  \n\n\n&gt;**As long as money keeps flowing into the Casino, the gamblers feel little risk, so no one pulls out. The Fed continues to print money, equity/bond prices continue to rise, and since there\u2019s \u201cno risk\u201d of the underlying falling in value, everyone keeps their money in the pot, and the poker game continues.**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**The profits made from derivatives trading are enormous, and any bank that stopped doing this would quickly lose investors, because they would instantly take their capital out and take it to another bank that actually is profitable. It's all a confidence game - as long as everyone is confident, prices keep rising, and the cash keeps pumping in, the party will continue.**\n\n# Chapter III. The Sword of Damocles (and the bet)\n\n  \nWell, here comes the party pooper, or it\u2019s more appropriate to say, the party shitter:\n\n*Processing img nw7vw0dk93j71...*\n\n*Processing img ebo8be5r93j71...*\n\n*Processing img kqwqmy9t93j71...*\n\nConnecting the dots: when there is too much risk in the system, it becomes less and less sustainable, so that potentially even a short but sudden and intense surge in volatility may demolish the whole house of ~~leverage~~cards. Anything may cause a fatal error in such a system, even an old man\u2019s fart with the sigma of five. In our example however, it\u2019s when crazy retail jumps on the hype train, and buys over-shorted stonk like there\u2019s no tomorrow, things look like this:\n\n* GME shares added more than 500% in less than two days, showing off its negative beta in all glory,\n* making VIX volatility index explode more than 60% in a day,\n* and injuring SPY badly (sharp decline of about 4% in 21 hours).\n\nThat was just a preview.\n\nLate January events are extraordinary, that\u2019s for sure. But, you know, extraordinary things happen too, and it\u2019s plainly stupid not to hedge in such circumstances, as Robbinhood did in this story. That was a vivid example of an extremely poor risk management, prevalent on the financial markets currently. This factor, coupled with the excessive margin exploitation (e.g. a fucking reported triple digits SI, dafuq?), will consequently result in the financial crisis, which is currently on its way (remember, crises love September and October).\n\nAfter a rather fascinating set of circumstances, GME situation seems to have become the needle to burst the bubble, that\u2019s why big financial boys use all of their dirty tricks, flirting with an illusion of a controllable chaos. However, any manipulation has its end, and it is a double edged sword (of Damocles). The market will punish the bad actors, as it has always done so in the past - and the good guys will be remunerated. Again, GME is not the reason of the upcoming market crash, but rather a trigger, and in the current financial environment anything could work as a substitute. What was that quote from the \u2018Butterfly Effect\u2019 movie? Oh,  \n\n\n&gt;It has been said that something as insignificant as the gases emitted from an anus of an old man can ultimately cause a financial typhoon all around the world...\n\n  \n**Enough words and quotes. This is my bet: GME to thousands in a couple of months, while the new financial crisis unveiling, or I\u2019m not only shaving off my beard (which I wasn\u2019t really afraid of loosing, tbh, as it would grow back in a couple of months) but also this, my real treasure:**\n\n*Processing video m0gwzvob43j71...*\n\n**And here is why I\u2019m so confident in my bet and its timing:**  \n\n\n*Processing img w51ks5l2b3j71...*\n\nI mean, SPY is cooked. What's outlined on the TA above is a massive bearish formation, ready to push the market off the cliff it has been climbing all this time. In my opinion, that's going to be just the first wave of the nasty downside movement, and a very sharp and painful one. Considering the longer term setup, explained \\[here\\](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mwevzz/the\\_big\\_short\\_20\\_why\\_bears\\_may\\_soon\\_reconsider/), and \\[here\\](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o0fjdb/this\\_time\\_its\\_different/), the technical (as well as fundamentals, as discussed above) conditions resemble the perfect storm brewing. Now, while it's all calm before that storm, enjoy the last sunny and warm days (and, maybe, it's a good idea to fix some profits, dunno). September and October will be fun. Especially for GME with its negative beta.\n\n*Processing img mcg9etbeh3j71...*\n\n*Processing img xbskfzdkh3j71...*\n\n**TL;DR: My SS thesis and its core idea is more than alive with GME (proven by AMC example), and even though any major price action movement has been suppressed in an attempt to keep things under control by big financial players, the buying pressure is there and it's as strong as it has ever been. The financial system is over-levereged, way more than it was in 2008, and coupled with the industry poor risk assessment standarts ('average WSB retard'-like or worse), it is heading to the next financial crisis (and crashes love autumn). This factor, considering GME's negative beta, will likely trigger the next powerful bull run for GME, sucking in the liquidity from the fearful and already-illiquid markets, resulting in colossal volatility typhoon. Either that, or I'mma be completely bold this winter.**",

        "selftext": "President Biden is set to announce his aim for 50% electric vehicles by 2030. Yahoo Finance\u2019s Rick Newman shares the details.\n\n### Video Transcript\n\nAKIKO FUJITA: The Biden administration is setting ambitious targets to reduce the country's carbon footprint, calling for electric vehicles to make up half of all new US car sales by the end of this decade. Some climate activists, though, saying the goal doesn't address the urgency of the crisis. Let's bring in Yahoo Finance's Rick Newman, who is following this story for us.\n\nAnd Rick, you know, we're talking about 50% by the end of the decade. And yet, today, EVs only make up about 3% of new car sales. So how realistic is this?\n\nRICK NEWMAN: It depends on what the government does, honestly. If the industry were just left to itself, I don't think there's any way we would get to 50% of new vehicle market share by 2030. The cars are still more expensive than gas-powered cars. There's still range issues. But the Biden administration plans to do a lot to incentivize people to buy these vehicles.\n\nSo there's going to be billions of dollars for new charging stations. So there will be charging stations, in theory, wherever you might need one. That's in the bipartisan infrastructure bill that's now in Congress. Biden wants about $170 billion in addition to that. He wants new subsidies for anybody buying an electric vehicle, electrify school buses. He wants subsidies for building battery plants in the United States and all this kind of stuff.\n\nSo this-- these are the reasons that the auto industry really seems quite happy to go along with this. Because they're going to-- they think they're going to get so much funding from the federal government to help them reach this target. By the way, we should point out to everybody watching, this is a target not a requirement. There's no penalty for any automaker that does not get to 50% of all new vehicle sales being electric by 2030. That's just the goal.\n\nAKIKO FUJITA: And Rick, you've also got some additional measures here laid out in that plan, including limits on tailpipe emissions. I mean, walk me through how significant of a bump that is. Because we all - there were standards set under the Obama administration. The Trump administration rolled that back. Where do things stand now?\n\nRICK NEWMAN: We don't know exactly. Because Biden has not yet said what he plans to do on that. I mean, just the very briefest history here, Obama, in 2012, raised fuel efficiency standards really aggressively. That would have required about a 5% improvement in fuel economy every year. And then Trump came in, and he slashed that down to about a 1.5% improvement in fuel economy every year.\n\nNow the reporting is that Biden is going to split the difference basically. He's going to raise fuel economy standards above where Trump left them to what would amount to about 3.7% increase in fuel economy every year. But that- they have not announced that yet. And that takes a long time. That is the-- that's changing a federal regulation, which has to go through months and months of review and things like that.\n\nAnd I think one of the things we're probably going to hear the Biden administration say, well, yeah, his guideline for fuel economy is not as aggressive as Obama's was back in 2012. But if we have all these new electric vehicles on the road, that is something that we didn't have really back in 2012. So that should make it easier to reach the 3.7% annual increase, or whatever it turns out to be. But that is down the road still.\n\nAKIKO FUJITA: OK. Rick Newman, staying on top of the details. Of course, you can read his story on YahooFinance.com as well. Thanks so much for that, Rick.",

TTCF (Tattooed Chef) is a wildly asymmetric bet with an options IV that is drastically underpricing the risk of trapped shorts closing one another out with a fun catch: the higher IV goes, the more shorts lose.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5dlslsp7jjk71.png?width=500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=03c0ffec247a290c1704833f7b5a76e008e3acbf\n\nI\u2019ve been watching this the past 2 weeks, and now have some hard examples of shorts using illegal methods of delaying the inevitable: an explosive move up from broker close outs and spiking short constraints.

My theory is shorts were happening for a much larger drop, but also turns out the market didn\u2019t care since the company is reporting solid growth and will continue to.\u00a0\n\nEven after insiders were allowed to sell in April, the CEO only dropped 2.5% of his entire stake.\u00a0\n\nCue: buy the fucking dip and tightening of the float.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[High frequency also price levels based on gaps\\/hedging\\/stops](https://preview.redd.it/7grbkn4djjk71.jpg?width=2732&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6c936ba8d85ab9e9138345ac6e926e0a3a396c94)\n\nHere\u2019s where it gets fun, during the small rally last week back to balance, cost to borrow increased x3 fold.

Let\u2019s have a primer. What is an FTD (Fail-To-Deliver) and resetting the clock?\n\n&gt;Periodically, securities become hard to borrow, and, where there are large and persistent fails to deliver in the security, end up on the threshold security list. These situations give rise to pricing differentials in the options of these securities, and the Put/Call equation may appear out of balance, which is, in part, a reflection of higher borrowing rates on these securities\u2026. Reg SHO requires FTD positions resulting from short sale transactions to be closed out by a specific date (T+3).\n\n\\- [SEC Illegal Reset Report](https://www.sec.gov/about/offices/ocie/options-trading-risk-alert.pdf), page 6 (2013)\n\nOkay in English, FTD\u2019s are when brokers can\u2019t deliver short sales. They normally have to close them on T+3. In order to avoid closing, Short Bears are doing something called \u2018Resetting the Clock\u2019 to kick the ball down the road before closing out and paying 340% borrow fees.\u00a0\n\nHere\u2019s a walk-thru on the reset playbook.\n\n1. Short Bear shorts TTCF at 340% cost to borrow to try for a 5% gain. Yolo.\n2. Crooked Broker can\u2019t deliver the borrowed shares.\n3. Crooked Broker is required to close out Short Bear on the third day (T+3).\n4. Short Bear doesn\u2019t like this so they do a sneaky deal selling calls and buying puts on non-OI options with Crooked Broker so they assign them making it look like they closed out for another 3 days.\u00a0\n5. Short Bear hopes price goes down before he has to pay the 340% cost to borrow + take the loss, so keeps doing this.\n\nWhat Short Bear is doing is illegal, so in the off chance the SEC ever does anything, here\u2019s your proof (cc: SEC)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Thursday Order, 12:18pm CST](https://preview.redd.it/tfwyt4bkjjk71.png?width=3542&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6d356e27430acd795e9d237e3d18a0ba3d1e8adc)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Friday OI \u2013 options have all been exercised](https://preview.redd.it/pral284njjk71.png?width=1858&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7049084b5df1b7d8521adce965ecf186ae9aea3d)\n\nThese resets have been happening literally every day for the past week. So, why should you care? Well, the SEC tells us why.\n\n&gt;Trade A continues to execute a buy-write reset transaction whenever necessary, and by the time of expiration of its original Reversal, it may have given up some of the profits in the form of premiums paid, but it has maintained its short position without paying the higher cost to borrow or purchase shares to make delivery.\n\n\\- [SEC Illegal Reset Report](https://www.sec.gov/about/offices/ocie/options-trading-risk-alert.pdf), page 9\n\nRead: the longer shorts do this, the higher IV goes = the longer shorts do this, the more and more unprofitable it becomes. Not only does A) this clock reset point to severe short constraints, but B) this represents severe vulnerability if the powder keg goes off and mass calls get bought, jacking IV/premium, making the FTD reset dramatically more expensive and complex to complete while sparking off a short squeeze.\n\nEnter: vicious cycle\n\n1. Price goes higher, forcing high borrow rates\n2. Shorts with high borrow rates try to reset the clock\n3. Reset the clock jacks IV higher, making it more unprofitable\n4. Shorts start closing\n5. Price goes higher\n6. Repeat\n\n# Part 4 the play\n\nThe run should start imminently.\u00a0\n\nRepeated tests of the $20 - $20.5 range result in huge panic short sells. On Thurs, shorts responded to attempted breakout by purchasing thousands of deep ITM puts and selling thousands of deep ITM calls for a stupid amount of premium. Didn\u2019t work. On Fri, massive share sells tried to defend against another breakout.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Short attacks on price Thurs-Fri](https://preview.redd.it/4osklbyojjk71.png?width=3506&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b2e94c58a1e32eadccf63c64e78606b9159743ee)\n\nIV is low enough to make substantial returns. It would be lower if not for shorts resetting transactions, but it\u2019s all good because there\u2019s ample ability to profit off their mistake.\u00a0\n\nIt you want to see what short panic looks like, look no further than the walls of bought puts and sold calls shorts placed on Thurs to prevent a breakout.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Thursday Order, 8:56am CST](https://preview.redd.it/4e9z9imqjjk71.png?width=1960&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=051b05106221d1b73976a6176cfa2e8b0aef9d2e)\n\nMy move is on all time highs.\u00a0\n\n9/17 22.5c @ 0.6 = 800% returns by exp. at 28\n\n9/17 25c @ 0.4 = 1150% returns by exp. at 30\n\n10/15 25c $ .65 = 1400% returns by exp. at 35\n\nCheers",

        "selftext": "^(I'm  not a financial advisor, nor am I giving any financial advise. This is  an entertainment/comedy-nonfactual post. I'm a retard  posting on WSB  with a bias due to having a position of my portfolio in $ASTS.  So, Don't act on anything posted in here and proceed on your own risk...)\n\nRoughly 40-47% of the world doesn't have access to online Porn or the internet, a **Trillion** dollar market untapped. Imagine more than **3 Billion** horny people limited to only masturbating to their imagination!!\n\nASTS is a potentially once in a decade investment, one to the likes of Tesla at it's beginnings... A service which has no competitors, not even StarLink(as per the CEO). The one investment which could offset all the previous losses...\n\nASTS is developing the **First and Only** Space based Cellular Broadband network, **SpaceMobile.** SpaceMobile will be **compatible** with all currently existing 5G and LTE smartphones without the need to do any modifications to your phones hardware. It will provide connectivity **at 4G/5G speeds** **everywhere on the planet \u2013 on land, at sea and in flight.** In addition, 5 Billion phones move in and out of coverage all the time, SpaceMobile is planning to bridge the gap of connection loss without the need of specialized equipment!\n\n# The Technology (Too Technical and can be skipped):\n\n**TLDR;  The tech has been proven to work on smaller scales but has yet to be done at the scale ASTS is aiming for. Additionally, it's 6G forward compatible!**\n\n***OVERVIEW***:  AST &amp; Science (\u201cASTS\u201d) has designed a large aperture satellite system to provide \u2018direct-to-device\u2019 service to normal phones using a low earth orbit satellite array to directly connect to mobile phones anywhere on Earth.\n\n***Hardware***\\*\\*\\*:\\*\\*\\*   ASTS\u2019 satellites are \\~10x bigger than the norm because they are essentially cell-phone towers in space. With a [900-square meter array](https://preview.redd.it/sk0cpuxbfnd71.png?width=1158&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f57703695f83ed465a1912b1ae546a4c04c4852c), the system is a large **\u201cloud\u201d**  system that can connect with a regular mobile phone. Traditional satellite phones are just \u201clisten hard\u201d whereas ASTS simply produces a loud signal to connect to regular mobile phones.\n\n***SOFTWARE:***   ASTS\u2019 system does not require a special chipset on the phone because of its proprietary back-end software system that allows for interconnection to existing terrestrial(on Earth) spectrum and telecom networks. The \u201cmagic\u201d of the technology is the back-end software that allows the system to utilize terrestrial spectrum, seamlessly interconnect over existing networks, and talk directly to an LTE system; ASTS is 6G forward compatible.\n\n***BACKHAUL***:   Once the signal is collected from a handset, ASTS sends the data back  on B-Band satellite spectrum to a ground gateway system. The phone-satellite connection is native to the carrier\u2019s terrestrial spectrum.\n\n***CAPACITY***:  Each satellite can handle 1.2MM GB per month; extra capacity can be added by directing additional satellites at an area.\n\n# Business Model(Can be skipped):\n\n**TLDR; ASTS brings the satellites and execution while their partners bring the customers.**\n\n***The Model:*** ASTS has chosen to partner with preexisting telecom giants to acquire a large customer base with essentially 0 acquisition costs per customer for ASTS. They have agreed to a 50/50 revenue split with its partners who are going to provide the customers. The 5g connection will be offered as an add-on to preexisting data plans provided by their partners or as a standalone purchase.\n\n***How Does it generate Money? :***  With its current carrier partners, Vodafone and AT\\&amp;T; given its large, fixed cost base, the Company expects to generate 90% asset-level EBITDA margins that provide  significant operating leverage and cash flow.\n\nIn-place there are binding agreements with carriers to provide ASTS with access to  &gt;1.3BN existing customers without having to independently market to or acquire customers (or directly bear the cost of churn). Phase 1 will  target key Equatorial regions and cover 1.6BN people. In subsequent phases, it's planning to expand into Europe and N. America by 2024.\n\nThe company is expected to generate &gt;$1bn of EBITDA by 2024 based on 168 satellites launched, 27MM total subscribers, with an ARPU of $2.50 per user.\n\n***ASSets:***  ASTS has 750+ patents as well as a first-mover advantage(no competitors yet). Moreover, Commercial progress reinforces the Company\u2019s technical lead in the market having ATT, Vodafone, American Towers and Rakuten in it's pocket.\n\n# Timeline(can be skipped):\n\n**TLDR;** **They have broken up their plan into 5 different phases spanning multiple  years with the intent of slowly expanding their satellite constellation until full global coverage is achieved.**\n\n* Phase 1 - Equatorial constellation, 20 satellites by 2022\n   * Cash flow from phase 1 will support the following phases\n* Phase 2 - NA/Europe/Asia, 45 satellites by 2022\n* Phase 3 - Full global coverage, 45 satellites by 2023\n   * At this point ASTS expects to start turning a profit\n* Phase 4 - Full global MIMO coverage (increased data capacity), 58 satellites by 2023\n* Phase 5 - Scaling network globally, 16 satellites by 2028\n\n# Management(Can be skipped):\n\n* CEO Abel Avellan\n   * 25+ years of space industry experience\n   * Track record of building a successful global satellite communications company\n      * EMC Emerging Markets Communications\n* CFO Tom Severson\n   * Former CFO of EMC\n* CTO Huiwen Yao\n   * 30+ years of experience in satcom\n* CCO Chris Ivory\n   * 25+ years of experience in satcom\n\nEmployees:\n\n* 236 full-time employees\n* 13 part-time employees\n* 161 scientists and engineers\n   * 24 of whom are PhDs\n\n**The deep executive ranks include executives from Orbital ATK, Globecomm,  NASA, and Maxar \u2022 The team has 161 scientists and engineers, 34 of whom  are PhDs.**\n\n# Catalysts(can be skipped):\n\n**The most important catalyst is the BlueWalker 3 satellite launch which will be taking place sometime in Q4  2021.**\n\nThis will be a bigger satellite than any previous ones created but it still is not the biggest they plan to make. However, a successful launch and connection to BW3 would definitively prove that the tech works at larger scales.\n\nOther smaller but still significant catalysts include:\n\n* Government approvals for servicing in each country\n* The launch date for BW3\n* Acquisition of a portion of the federal 5g fund\n\n# Risks(Can be skipped):\n\nEvery play ranging from 0dte to year long investments come with some amount of risk and this is no exception.  While some may simply be setbacks they are still worth knowing.\n\n* Delays\n   * Satellite construction and launch delays.\n* Execution\n   * Building, launching and deploying the satellites.\n* Regulators\n   * Need governmental approval for satellite operations from each country they wish to provide before they can service them.\n* Tech\n   * Satellite to phone connection still unproven on a large scale.\n* Funding\n   * Not fully funded (Need to raise \\~1.5 bn) however phase 1 is fully funded and is planned to help pay for the subsequent phases.\n\n# Valuation(Most important part):\n\nThe current market cap of ASTS is only 1.71 Billion for a stock with an extremely high potential, endless possibilities, and no competitors.\n\nSpaceX's Starlink(If we want to compare apples to oranges), will provide **FIXED-POINT(Doesn't connect to mobile)** broadband to customers at very high costs with unclear quality. Moreover Starlink cannot translate to mobile devices. It depends on Dish Satellites.\n\nStarLink is valuated between 40-50Billion Dollars! **Which equals around 222$-277$ of ASTS!!**\n\nJust like Facebook found out after it's IPO, the real market is and always will be in **MOBILE** and Starlink cannot translate to mobile devices.\n\n***Deutsche Bank most recent coverage:*** Their price target was set on 35$ and they added this nice comment **\u201cIf management executes on plan over the next five years, the company's intrinsic value should ultimately be \"significantly higher\"** than the $35  price target.\"\n\n***Barclays Most recent coverage:*** Their price target was set on 29$.\n\n**And Most importantly my coverage:** Well, you cannot really valuate this rare breed, because it's like trying to valuate $TSLA in the early days when it was just 50$(post split). ASTS is in a very similar situation right now having no competitors with a massive lead in the industry(A proven product on a small scale with well established partnerships with Vodafone, ATT, American Towers and Rakuten).\n\nRight now, it should atleast have a market cap of 10 Billion, which is 1/4 Starlink, and there's actually no competition.\n\nPrice target will be illustrated with crayons bellow:\n\n[ASTS Price Target illustrated with Crayons](https://preview.redd.it/cew62pdeqjj71.png?width=651&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=43c5882e02595f60ed2d0f59646ad1e58605c2bf)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n^(Special thanks to /oceanice and /thekookreport for their great DD)",

        "selftext": "Hello. On August 12th, something very strange happened. The url amazon.com/affirm no longer led to an error message. In fact, it redirects to a link that says \"Pay over time with Affirm\" in the tab title, and, if you're on the app it says \"Search in Pay over time with Affirm\" in the search bar. ipad view: https://imgur.com/rGLmrwy\n\nIf you do a \"view page source\" you can ctrl+F and see the \"08-12\" that verifies that this url was set up on 8/12.\n\nNow let's explore the url it redirects to. It has a specific \"node ID\" in it. https://www.amazon.com/b?node=23376591011\n\nUpon reviewing what this means, a node ID is set up for a specific category of product. For instance, this is what the url for their Kindle overview page looks like: https://www.amazon.com/b?node=17717476011 An identical URL with a different node ID.\n\nIt seems very unlikely they set up a specific node ID url if something wasn't brewing.\n\nNow lets look at other evidence. A few months ago, someone noticed during checkout the word \"option\" that had not been there before, yet there was only one pay over time option. See the third line down: https://imgur.com/g0jqN4c\n\nSomeone also noticed that when you used to search for \"Amazon Affirm\" on google it used to come up with a robo-generated search result mentioning Affirm. They do this with basically anything you search to generate clicks. But, a couple months ago, this robo-generated search result removed as if they were trying to hide something. Here is what used to come up: https://imgur.com/3uE52wt\n\nSo what could all this mean? It could be something as simple as Amazon will promote Affirm's upcoming debit card on their website, but why would they promote a competing card? At the moment Amazon only offers their own cards. Or.. it could be a full-blown partnership or buyout. We don't know, but something is going on.\n\nAlso, don't question why I was routinely visiting error message URLs. I have no life and was hoping one day I'd find something and I did.",

It's in business since 1994\n\n\\- It's growing revenue every year. 2018: $937M, 2019: $1,097M, 2020: $1,700M and TTM: $2,015M\n\n\\- It's profitable, with a profit margin of 8%\n\n\\- It's growing income every year: 2018: $22M, 2019: $24M, 2020: $158M and TTM: $211M\n\n\\- They have positive cash flow and are sitting on $136M of cash. TTM free cash flow is $138M.\n\n\\- With 91M shares outstanding, this means that they could, theoretically, start paying a dividend of $1 per share without running in debt (which many other companies do). That's a 4% dividend yield for a growing company.\n\nIn short, many money, good money \ud83d\udcb5 \ud83d\udcb5 \ud83d\udcb5\n\n**Share price:**\n\nat time of writing, price is hovering around 25,6, that's more than 40% lower from ATHs.Their P/E ratio is 16. Current S&amp;P 500 P/E ratio is 34.\n\nLook at this beautiful graph and be amazed by my paint skills: there was a strong $30 support until WSB came in with a short pump, after that the price has been regularly falling.\n\n[CRSR Stock Price Chart](https://preview.redd.it/5bgknz7eshi71.jpg?width=1489&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=14dac94257d5650bae110fea236e05c225097151)\n\nMy take on this is:\n\n\\- Some boring cuck institutional investors are pulling back and waiting to add more shares. They don't like owning volatile stocks subjects to pumps etc. I will be inserting myself in this sweet stock while they watch from the corner of the room, like the good cucks that they are.\n\n\\- Employees and Eagle Tree Capital are selling their shares. They got in pre-ipo, so they are still making a good profit at the price of $25. Some of them are paper-handing it and taking profit. Pathetic.\n\nI know we hate GME comparisons but let's just fantasize for a second:look how after the squeeze, the price kept falling for a while, until it found some volume and skyrocketed back up, to never fall to those levels again.\n\n[GME Stock Price Chart](https://preview.redd.it/q8d15vmhshi71.jpg?width=1507&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ce317857fab1e769558fb80562eb72f3c12b556d)\n\nIn short, apes go to moon \ud83e\udd8d \ud83e\udd8d \ud83e\udd8d \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\n\n**Other catalysts:**\n\n\\- Gaming industry is booming and in case of another lockdown you know what happens\n\n\\- Chip shortage means that the sales that we are seeing now are not at full potential- Institutions buying in. At the moment Eagle Tree Capital is still the majority shareholder, after cutting it's position from 92% to 58%. Most other institutions have just a small position (see picture below).\n\n\\- Acquisitions. Turtle beach company ($HEAR) was priced around $25 when one of their shareholders proposed acquiring the full stake at $36,5 per share. That's a 46% premium.

I figured I'd be able to just roll them out into higher strike prices and wait for the IV to revert back to the mean, ultimately making a profit. My initial position consisted of 50x 18 Jun 21 $40 Calls at an avg price of  around $2.00. My Reg T margin requirements were around $24K at the time and AMC was around $22 at the time.\n\nOn 5/28/2021 AMC increased by 40% overnight to 36.72 and then dropped to 26.6 intraday, so I rolled out my call options to 9 Jul 21 $50 for a small profit. My Reg T margin requirement was now at 33K, and I had over 200K in my account.\n\non 6/2/2021 AMC increased in price by 27% overnight and was around $41 intraday. I again rolled my calls out for a small profit to 20 AUG 21 $70. My Reg T margin requirement was not at 72K, with enough money in my account to cover.\n\nBut that's when things escalated. The same day, as AMC started to rise to $55 I received two phone calls from an unknown number at noon and a minute later 30 of my contracts were liquidated. During that time, TD had changed their margin requirements to now be at 300% regular rates, and when AMC hit 55, even though my margin requirements would have been 150K, TD wanted me to have over 350K, which I didn't have and was liquidated.\n\nAt around 1pm the initial 30 contracts were liquidated at a premium of $24.5 as opposed to the $2 I originally sold them for, losing me around 66K on that trade. A few hours later, another 10 were liquidated at $35.7 when AMC hit $65, hitting me with another 33K loss. I wish they left a voicemail or at least emailed me, because I didn't hear my phone ring and the liquidation began a minute later. The next day, fearing more margin requirements, I liquidated the rest of the 10 contracts at a $28 premium, when AMC started to drop hitting me with my last loss of around 26K.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Margin Change](https://preview.redd.it/516fwur737g71.png?width=1071&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e42394069c1213db33b52bf40b0f46a8bdfd22f0)\n\nThis was a loss of over 50% of my portfolio and will obviously sting for quiet some time. I hope that sharing this story will help some of you fellow apes avoid this situation. For one, brokers can change margin requirements at any time and liquidate your account whenever, without any notice. I didn't know the full details at the time, as it's the fine print in the terms and condition, and I honestly missed it. I would have took a smaller position and hedged with vertical spreads or bought shares if I knew my margin requirements can jump 3x all of a sudden and totally cripple my account, which honestly just seemed a bit excessive, given that my position was still OTM and I had enough money in my account to cover.\n\nObviously brokers do this to cover themselves in case things get worse and you're not able to cover your losses, but at the same time I'm not sure their risk models properly calculated this increase because at the end, I would have been profitable in my investment and it just ends up hurting the little guy when they cripple your account and buy back your call options at almost a 1600% increase. I doubt they would raise margin rates to such excessive levels without any notice, without any time to respond, if the client is ultra wealthy and would just pull their money out. I wish the little guy would be given the same consideration.\n\nI have actually reached out to some lawyers and filed a FINRA report, but the feedback I have received so far is that brokers are allowed to do whatever they want when margin is involved. Be safe out there apes. If anyone knows if it's worth going to a FINRA arbitration for this to recover some cash, please let me know!\n\n[Timeline of Events](https://preview.redd.it/z933k2fa37g71.png?width=1593&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=38473f6c111f56794d6781bf79d283ed76fde683)",

        "selftext": "# I. Introduction\n\nSorry for the wall of text - but if you are serious about trading **please read through this -** I think you all could really benefit from a bit of intermarket analysis - and I see way too many victims of ignorance here who could prevent their losses by understanding these relatively simply concepts.\n\nThis sub is primarily focused on IWM names (Russell 2000/Small Caps). If you look at that stock - **it's been sideways for almost a year**. No secret you all have been losing tons of money as of late on your favorite stocks (Except MVST - nice one there).\n\nIn my eyes - for the best probability of success - you always want to be playing the names that are within the strongest index at the time (or simply playing the strongest index itself). I determine which is the strongest via charting plus some simple intermarket relationships. \n\nLast year during the recovery we got a huge **everything rally** \\- that is not usually the case. Money constantly rotates from sector to sector - this is how it usually is - and how it's been for most of 2021. For instance - notice today (8/102021) tech is dropping while financials, materials and other inflation camp names are pumping. This is one of many useful correlations.\n\n# II. The Indices\n\nThe indices are large groups of stocks lumped in together that usually move in unison. Most of you probably already know this. I'm just going to list out what each index is and what it focuses on.\n\n**S&amp;P 500 (SPY, SPX, ES)**\n\n*from Wikipedia*\n\n\"The Standard and Poor's 500, or simply the S&amp;P 500, is a stock market index that tracks 500 large companies listed on stock exchanges in the United States. It is one of the most commonly followed equity indices.\"\n\nBasically a compilation of most large caps in the United States. Great gage of overall market health - and sort of a cross between the other two large cap indexes (Nasdaq 100, Dow Jones).\n\n**Nasdaq 100 (QQQ, NDX, NQ)**\n\n*from Wikipedia*\n\n\"The Nasdaq-100 is a stock market index made up of 102 equity securities issued by 100 of the largest non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq stock market. It is a modified capitalization-weighted index. \"\n\nThese are going to be mostly your large cap growth names (tech stocks) - but there are a few boomer names in there. Just more heavy on the growth side than the other indexes.\n\n**Dow Jones Industrial Average (DIA, DJIA, YM)**\n\n*from Wikipedia*\n\n\"The Dow Jones Industrial Average, Dow Jones, or simply the Dow, is a price-weighted measurement stock market index of 30 prominent companies listed on stock exchanges in the United States.\"\n\nThese are going to be your \"boomer\" names - I like to call it the boomer index. Value, materials, healthcare etc. Not really any growth names in there (except AAPL, CRM I guess). One thing I like to note is that **all the names in Dow Jones are present in the S&amp;P 500 - the Dow is the most closely correlated index to the S&amp;P** (about a 0.92 correlation iirc).\n\n**Russell 2000 Index (IWM, RUT, RTY)**\n\n*from Wikipedia*\n\n\"The Russell 2000 Index is a small-cap stock market index of the smallest 2,000 stocks in the Russell 3000 Index. It was started by the Frank Russell Company in 1984. The index is maintained by FTSE Russell, a subsidiary of the London Stock Exchange Group.\"\n\nThese are all your small cap names. There is also a Russell 1000 and Russell 3000. Notice how many more companies are in here than the other indexes. This one isn't going to be moved by one or two stocks. Small caps usually benefit from risk on environments (they are perceived to be riskier) - but note the more speculative growth ones will lag in those situations. \n\nThese are also **meme stocks - pretty much every single one is in a Russell Index.** If you are someone who likes to play memes - you always want to watch IWM. When this one is popping off is when they will be making a run.\n\n# III. Risk On vs Risk Off (Inflation vs Deflation Camp)\n\nMoving onto more practical applications of this information. I could do a section on Forex, Bonds, etc. - but honestly you only need to know what they are to apply the analysis that I do.\n\nThe primary narrative driving the market in recent times is whether we are getting inflation or deflation - and this has dictated the flow of money.\n\n**Risk On (Inflation Camp)**\n\nRisk on is when you are going to see a rotation into \"risk assets\". People predicting inflation believe the Fed will raise rates and that inflation will continue to rise - so they are flowing into banks, energy, materials, value stocks and some Forex pairs - things that will benefit from more inflation, and things that perform better in a high interest rate environment.\n\nBanks make an interest rate spread on deposits received versus money lent out. In a rising rate environment, banks benefit because they are still paying a lower interest on deposits, but making a greater spread on money lent out. \n\nCommodities and materials (energy) benefit from inflation for obvious reasons - they will scale as inflation increases.\n\nValue stocks benefit here because people are **hunting for yield** \\- this is the main point in a risk on environment. Value stocks **make money** and often pay it out via **dividends or share buybacks** which create value for shareholders. They also generally **aren't** **dependent on debt.** When rates rise - money becomes more expensive to borrow - and companies that depend on it will generally perform worse.\n\nAUD/JPY is the main forex pair I watch for risk on moves. Basically - AUD = riskier currency, JPY = safe haven currency. As a result - when AUD/JPY is going up - money is likely flowing into risk assets.\n\nSmall caps generally perform well here because they are perceived to be riskier. Remember, risk on = money flowing to risk assets.\n\nIn a risk on environment **Dow Jones** will usually outperform. Remember that's where you find your boomer value names.\n\nEquities as a whole will generally do well in a risk on environment. This gets a bit tricky when we are expecting a rate raise at any moment - but stocks in general are considered a hedge for inflation.\n\n**Risk Off (Deflation Camp)**\n\nThis is the exact opposite of risk on. Money flows out of risk assets and into safe assets. People predicting deflation believe current inflation expectations are overblown and the increase is transitory. They also think the Fed won't raise rates for a while. In general - **the fed lowers rates to stimulate economic activity and stave off deflation. Subsequently - money flows into safe haven assets and things that benefit from low interest rates and protect from deflation.** These are going to be your growth names, bonds, the dollar and the VIX.\n\nGrowth performs well here because when interest rates are low - money is cheaper to borrow. **Growth depends on debt to continue it's operations. Most of them also don't make money and so they have** **no yield.**  An increase in interest rates will raise the cost of capital making it harder for companies to generate higher returns. With rising rates, a company has to pay a higher interest expense that lowers their overall profitability. Lower profits lead to lower cash flows, which lead to a higher required rate of return for investors, all of which lead to a lower valuation for the company's share price. \n\nBonds perform well because remember - investors are expecting **rates to fall** in this situation. If your coupon will be lower in the future - why wouldn't you buy now while it's still as high as it is. Not only that - but bonds are **safe haven assets -** they provide a fixed rate of return (unlike equities) - and so they are perceived to be much safer.\n\nThe dollar performs well because it is **the safe haven currency.** It's the worlds primary reserve currency - so in times of economic hardship people put their money there to protect it. Also - if we are **deflating** \\- the dollar is gaining value.\n\nThe VIX performs well because it's **essentially a measure of how hedged SPX players are**. If you are expecting deflation in assets - you are expecting prices to drop for the most part - and so you want to be hedged on your long positions (or make straight bear bets).\n\n**In Summary**\n\n&lt; *Risk On &gt;*\n\n* Financials\n* Commodities\n* Value\n* Materials\n* AUD/JPY\n* **Russell 2000**\n* **Dow Jones**\n\n&lt; *Risk Off &gt;*\n\n* Bonds\n* Growth\n* Dollar\n* VIX\n* **Nasdaq 100**\n\n# IV. Practical Applications\n\nFirst let me go over the tickers I watch for each rotation -\n\n&lt; *Risk On &gt;*\n\n* YM (DIA)\n* RTY (IWM)\n* CL (Crude Oil Futures)\n* ZC (Corn Futures)\n* AUD/JPY\n\n*&lt; Risk Off &gt;*\n\n* DXY (Dollar Index)\n* ZB (30 Year Treasury Bonds)\n* TNX (10 Year Treasury Index)\n* VIX (The \"Fear Index\")\n* NQ (QQQ)\n* ARKK (This is a bit newer and less common - but I find it useful to track speculative growth names that perform quite well in a deflationary environment)\n\nGlancing at a watchlist of these will give you a quick picture of where money is flowing at the moment - but in order to predict the odds of future movements (and more profitable ones) - I perform technical analysis on all of these names.\n\nBasically - I analyze all the indices and only play the one that is the strongest from a technical standpoint. I further filter these signals and determine position sizing by analyzing their correlated assets.\n\nFor instance - if **DIA** is breaking out - and **ZB** is breaking down - this is confluence for a risk on rotation. The more confluence - the higher probability you have of success in any play.\n\nOn the contrary, if **DIA** is breaking out - and **ZB** is rallying - this is a sign one of the moves is likely fake - and a signal I have lower odds of success. Subsequently, I want to size smaller.\n\n***Let's take a look at one example in which QQQ (Growth, Risk Off) caught the rotation this past May. This is a perfect example of Bonds and Growth moving in unison to provide a high probability long trade in QQQ and TLT. Note: I just use trendlines and volume for my technical analysis. No indicators.***\n\n[NQ \\(QQQ\\)](https://preview.redd.it/fdtd97r9fkg71.png?width=1696&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2e7c58fa94c018f4d6fb5b38585a4d474f77b5c6)\n\nThe red circle is Nasdaq on **5/13.** You can see that is the day it bottomed - and every day since then pretty much Nasdaq, tech, and risk off assets have been leading. Not only that - but on **6/22** it broke a huge technical setup (the big red line) - which triggered a ton more upside.\n\n[TLT \\(ZB\\)](https://preview.redd.it/cuq89v4hfkg71.png?width=1456&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=836d02a7fc13c175aebc93f080d705679b0b2f7c)\n\nThe red circle here is also **5/13.** You can see that is also the day that TLT (ZB or Bonds) bottomed - and every day since then except for the past three days - it's held the same uptrend. Not only that - but on **6/22** it also broke that big red line - which was a downtrend stemming from last year - triggering more upside here as well. We also broke out of that teal symmetrical triangle, which provided more confluence for the move.\n\nI try to assign a signal strength to each move in order to make it easier for my monkey brain to understand.\n\n* **Indexes:** 3\n* **Bonds:** 2\n* **Everything Else:** 1\n\nYou will see a lot of people say bonds are everything - and in my experience that is very true. Last year we had an extremely odd situation where risk parity was fucked - but in recent times it has come back. Correlations almost always revert to the mean at **some point**. Subsequently - you could watch just bonds and the indices and efficiently track the flow of money. The others are just if you want to filter your signals further or are unsure about a move.\n\n# V. Divergences\n\nCorrelations are not perfect. If they were - everyone would be a billionaire. There are times when we get divergences and things move opposite of the way they usually do. Like I said - they **almost** **always revert to the mean** at some point - but the catch is the divergence could blow your account before it reverts back. If you are good with technicals you can easily spot when a setup you are trying to play breaks down and stop loss accordingly - but the key point here is **always have a stop loss when playing correlations.** Lots of people think they can average down infinitely and eventually profit off the arbitrage that comes with assets reverting to the mean - but **the market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent.**\n\n# IV. TL;DR\n\nThe main thing to takeaway here is the indices. If QQQ is weak - maybe you want to take a look at DIA. If IWM is sideways - maybe you want to take a look at QQQ. Keep your head on a swivel and don't be too biased towards one sector. **If you can effectively track the flow of money - you can theoretically catch every rotation.**\n\nAlso - you don't have to apply the technicals I do to track it. That's just my method. Lot's of people use complex macroeconomic analysis to assess these sorts of things, among other methods. I'm just too smooth brained for that.\n\nI hope this helped you all - and if anyone has questions drop it in the comments.",

        "selftext": "# A case study in the meme market\u2019s Epileptic Squeezures and why the market is ready for another.\n\n**Alright folks! So you've heard CLOV looks good for an epic run... and oh boy does it!**\n\n**I have a full write up broken into multiple parts and I\u2019m spending quite a bit of time on this, I hope you find it useful! If there is any organizational changes I can make to allow reading it easier, please let me know. If you find any piece of information wrong, please point it out but also explain. I\u2019ve spent a lot of time learning about the market since the meme stocks started what they\u2019ve been doing. It\u2019s fascinating, and I\u2019ve learned so much. Lost money, made money, but am overall better for the education! I don\u2019t know everything and I am open to counter arguments and more details where I may have missed some. Thanks!**\n\n***The brief summary of data:*** *CLOV option open interest on 8/20 (the number of contracts open for calls/puts) is absolutely enormous. For perspective, this Friday has a typical number of contracts for the stock. We see 77,006 calls and 31,986 puts (0.42 ratio) expiring, 8/13.*\n\n*FRIDAY 08/20 HOWEVER, we have jaw dropping 306,424 calls, and 72,752 puts (0.24 ratio). This puts us right on track for a GAMMA SQUEEZE (details further down).*\n\n*Earnings report showed a surprise beat on revenue (+100%), critical for growth stocks. We are at a local minimum value on the stock, so with a great earnings report, investors are eager to buy the stock. We saw this on 08/12 after earnings with the insane amount of volume (147.4million, vs the avg. of 29.22 million) fighting for the price around $9 a share.*\n\n*These factors, plus 25% short interest (who doesn't love hearing that), mean that CLOV is ripe for a major mind melting squeeze beginning the week of the Futures contract rollover dates beginning on the Futures First Notice Day, August 26. The futures contracts are a key piece of this meme stock puzzle that many have been trying to solve.*\n\n*This will likely peak before Sept. 9 due to futures rollover dates. Unless we see insane price action reaching margin call levels, which considering the DTCC's updated Uncleared Margin Rules (phase 5) going into effect on Sept 1st. is expected to cause a spike in margin calls.*\n\n***TLDR: CLOV go moon before Sept 9, buy shares. Buy calls 09/03 @ $10 and 9/10 @ whatever strike suits you.***\n\nFor the long version, read on!\n\n**Table of Contents:**\n\n1. What the hell is a gamma squeeze?\n2. How will we recognize a gamma squeeze? How long can it take to play out?\n3. FTDS\n4. **Futures Contracts Rollover Dates \u2013  Triple Witching Rollover Edition and we're in a Ford Bronco**\n\n***What the hell is a gamma squeeze and how do you predict one is going to happen?***\n\nA gamma squeeze is a product of the derivatives (calls/puts) market. Usually this is a rare event, but with growing accessibility to the markets by retail investors, it is becoming more common. (*Tin foil hat*: this will not last forever, they will nerf this feature at some point).\n\n***What causes the gamma squeeze?*** Unusually high call option open interest + Rise in share price + Market Maker Delta hedging.\n\nDelta hedging is when market makers buy and sell shares in a stock to remain delta neutral. See, a Hedge fund (market maker) is intended to provide liquidity, and help you buy and sell shares. But they don't want to be on the bad side of a trade, so they remain delta neutral.\n\nDelta is a value that affects the option price on calls and puts. It is directly related to the rate of change in stock price. So if you have a call option with a delta of 0.1, a market maker needs to buy 10 shares to hedge. A delta of 0.5 would be 50 shares, and the max delta is 1.0 or 100 shares (this would be deep in the money) The more call options open (open interest), the more market makers have to do this.\n\nAs you might be figuring out, if the market makers have to buy shares to delta hedge, and there are an immense amount of call options open, then the buying action from market makers to delta hedge can and WILL drive up the price. As retail investors continue to buy shares and the price climbs, market makers must also buy shares to delta hedge. This causes a snowballing effect called the gamma squeeze. We saw this happen with so many stocks now (AMC in June, CLOV in June).\n\nGamma is the value that measures the rate of change in delta. So the faster the price changes, the higher the delta, and gamma runs higher as delta changes faster. Hence why it is termed a gamma squeeze.\n\n***How will we recognize a gamma squeeze happening? How long can it take to play out?***\n\nThe timeline for a gamma squeeze can be longer than you think. It is driven by multiple factors, and the intensity of each of these factors adds pressure to the overall squeeze. It can be broken into a few parts:\n\n***Share buying***\n\nAs shares are bought causing a rise in the stock price, market makers must hedge by buying shares as delta rises. The faster the rise in stock price due to buying pressure, the faster delta increases and the more shares need to be purchased by market makers. This is due to the need to deliver these shares the following week as more calls become in the money. More on this below.\n\n***Call Buying***\n\nThe more calls bought, the more shares must be purchased to delta hedge. If I purchase the $8 strike for 08/20 expiration, that call has a delta right now of 0.6. This means the market maker will purchase 60 shares to hedge against this.\n\nIn one respect, I think you can view buying calls as a way to effectively move the market as though you purchased that many shares, for a fraction of the price \u2013 hence the fact it is a leveraged bet. The current value of the call option is $59, however it would cost you $492.6 to buy $60 shares to have the same effect. (That said, please do not just YOLO call options, I\u2019m doing a mix of calls and shares).\n\n***Call Options Expiring ITM and their delivery***\n\nThe more calls that expire ITM on Friday, the more this impacts the price of the stock the following week. If you weren\u2019t aware, options expiring ITM must have their shares delivered to the exerciser of the contract by T+2. If the call writer is short the stock, they must buy the stock on the market. As a result, we usually see a surge in stock price following options expiration if a large number of calls expire ITM. This surge in stock price causes a surge in delta, which further compounds the rise in price as market makers buy shares to hedge delta. It\u2019s this T+2 option delivery, combined with futures rollover dates, that I believe is going to help catalyze the next run.\n\nIn the case of CLOV, there are absolutely staggering numbers of calls at various strikes on 08/20. See the following table from Barchart to see the numbers yourself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Open Interest on 08\\/20 for CLOV strikes $1-$17.50](https://preview.redd.it/2z331r8mjqh71.jpg?width=1160&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=124414fbc8a6314411691481a022d9df3185cfac)\n\n***Closing Short Sales***\n\nAs share price increases and borrowable shares dwindle, the borrow fee for short positions rises. Eventually this becomes untenable for short sellers and they must purchase shares to close their positions. We\u2019ve beaten the short squeeze scenario to death in this subreddit, so I won\u2019t go into more details. Just for data, the most recently reported (08/10) short interest on fintel shows 22.48% of the float is short, though Ortex estimates this has increased as of Friday 08/13 to 25.58% (go figure after that price action we saw on Friday). Short sales have likely been used to suppress price prior to the massive buy up necessary due to futures contracts (see below).\n\n***FTDS \u2013 Failures-to-deliver***\n\nCLOV shares that failed to deliver in the first two weeks of July is a staggering number. There were 46 million shares that failed to deliver. Compare to the 22million in June, vs the 6 million in May. These shares must be delivered. FTD data for the second half of July should be available on 08/16.\n\n46 million shares out of the public float of 133.76 million = 34.3% of the entire stocks\u2019 float failed to deliver in the first two weeks of July.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[FTDs for CLOV. Massive Spike in early July during the consistent drop in stock value](https://preview.redd.it/jo34i1g2kqh71.jpg?width=1830&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4433d9ee3994dcbd16e6ac84951894a8fa099204)\n\nHigh number of shares that fail to deliver usually indicates high amounts of short selling. Additionally, after the 30th of June, it appears that skyrocketing FTDs is correlated to a consistently falling share price that sees no Tuesday recovery due to options delivery. You can see a spike each Tuesday in June due to this, followed by a drop in share value.\n\n***READ! Futures Contracts Rollover \u2013 THIS IS ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL!***\n\nFor me, this was the last piece of the puzzle on figuring out what is going on with the meme stocks. The Triple Witching day is well known, and happens when futures expiration meets quarterly option expirations, but the timeframe for equity rollover was completely unknown to me.\n\nOn 9/9 the next futures contract rollover date happens. There is evidence that much of the meme stock activity is due to someone on the bad end of a futures basket that included many of the \"meme\" stocks we love so much today.\n\nEach major run up has been just before the futures rollover date on many more stocks than CLOV. Some of those companies show movies, other sell stuff to gamers. I don\u2019t want to name them and get flagged for removal.\n\nThe last futures rollover date was 6/10, the week that was the peak of our last meme circus. CLOV\u2019s peak was seen on 6/9, and the futures rollover happened the following day. CLOV stock never recovered.\n\nFurthermore, if you look at the following table I stole from /u/criand without permission (the futures info is his DD, thanks dude, you\u2019re a fucking hero)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0qtzon9pjqh71.png?width=679&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c066103e8c7bf7ea71274f397bb33a7d57923dfc\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Critical dates in the June 2nd - June 9th Squeeze](https://preview.redd.it/mllu0qaqjqh71.png?width=1547&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6da4572dbed718075d9ad28ebce7b9b195f6bb90)\n\nWe can see that the beginning of rollovers started on May 25th, the same day we started to see CLOV climb up from $7.01/share. The following week it closed on Friday, 6/4 at $9.12/share\n\nThe next Monday 06/7, it rips up to $11.92 by close, followed by a run to a close of $22.15 on Tuesday the 06/08. Wednesday 06/09 saw a high of $28.85 and a close of $16.92, ending the squeeze. You may ask yourself why it took so long for it to run up like this? The objective is to cover at the very last minute and avoid retail traders piling on to make the problem worse. If retail traders were to push the value of the stock higher each week allowing more calls to end ITM, through the buying of shares and ITM and ATM call options, then this run will end up moving sooner and moving higher. This is the exact scenario they want to avoid, and why you have never heard this information until now.\n\n**What to look for in confirmation?**\n\nMarket maker algorithms generally move prices to max-pain. This is where option writers are hurt the most and the least impact is placed on the market maker. When we end above the max pain level (which for 08/20 is $9.00) it puts more calls ITM, which usually leads to increased price action the following week as shares are bought to deliver for options contracts.\n\nIf it closes over $9 a share this Friday, that puts an additional 20,952 call options ITM. If we go over $10, this adds another 32,382 calls ITM. The more shares purchased this week by retail, plus the more AT THE MONEY AND IN THE MONEY CALLS will put pressure on this gamma squeeze to get started. The higher the price ends this Friday, the higher this event goes.\n\n**How to cause the most impact on the stock price:**\n\nIf you plan to participate, I suggest buying shares and ITM or ATM call options. One method of acquiring shares is buying a call option. If you by a call option for 8/20, the $8 strike is $59. The current share price is $8.21. If you purchase the option and choose to exercise it, you can have the effect of the call\u2019s delta forcing market makers to buy shares to hedge, plus when you exercise you can acquire 100 shares and force a higher price on Tuesday during options delivery.\n\nMy strategy involves deep ITM calls this week which I will exercise on Friday. I have the $6 strike call which will allow me to call away 100 shares for $6 each. I chose this as the shares did manage to reach $7.01 in May before the run, and I want to make sure I don\u2019t end up OTM. I also have the 09/03 call for the $10 strike, and the 09/10 call for the $11 strike. I do not plan to exercise these calls, and instead sell them during a bullish run up during their week of expiration.\n\nGood luck, have fun, and set yourself up to get out of this 9-5 bullshit, we deserve better!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'll leave you with one last bullish bit of sentiment, straight from the DTCC:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vl3d8cwsjqh71.jpg?width=750&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b818ae75767a341f2512a2324ddc68455eb0ae72",

        "selftext": "  \n\nAlibaba stock has been on a sharp downtrend since November even as the former China leader continues to deliver strong earnings and sales growth. Increased regulatory scrutiny has weighed on Alibaba stock in recent months and the stock has fallen almost than 50% off its high. BABA stock looks like it's on sale now, but is Alibaba stock a buy now?\n\nChina stocks sold off hard on July 23 after Beijing cracked down on education stocks like **TAL Education (TAL)** and **New Oriental Education (EDU)** fell more than 50%.\n\nAlibaba on Aug. 3 reported a 22% rise in quarterly profit. Revenue increased 44% to $31.9 billion. Alibaba said it had 1.18 billion annual active customers during the 12 months that ended June 30, up 45 million from the previous quarter. It reported 939 million mobile active users, up 14 million. The company also increased its share buyback program by $5 billion to $15 billion.\n\nCloud computing revenue increased 29% to $2.49 billion.\n\n**Alibaba** gapped down on May 13 after the company missed expectations, but revenue growth accelerated for the fourth straight quarter, soaring 77% to $28.6 billion.\n\n**Strong Results**\n\nAlibaba's Q3 earnings report in February revealed another quarter of strong bottom-line and top-line growth.\n\nAdjusted earnings rose 30% to $3.38 a share. Revenue growth accelerated for the third straight quarter, jumping 46% to $33.87 billion. Revenue for the company's cloud computing business grew 50% year over year to $2.47 billion.\n\nOne day after its earnings report, Alibaba stock jumped 3.5% on Feb. 3 after the company's fintech arm, Ant Group, struck a deal with Chinese regulators to restructure and become a financial holding company. Ant Group operates a suite of financial products, including the widely used Alipay digital wallet in China.\n\n**Sellers Hit BABA Stock**\n\nSellers knocked Alibaba stock lower on Nov. 3 after the $34.5 billion Ant Group IPO, the fintech arm of Alibaba, was suspended in Shanghai and Hong Kong. The decision to suspend the IPO came after Shanghai exchange officials said the exchange would halt the listing due to the company's inability to fulfill conditions amid changes in the regulatory environment.\n\nBABA stock crashed another 8% on Nov. 10 after Chinese regulators announced new draft antimonopoly rules for China online platforms like Alibaba and **JD.com** (JD), among others.\n\n**Alibaba Stock Fundamental Analysis**\n\nIt's hard to find a company with a more impressive track record of growth than Alibaba. The company has a five-year annualized earnings growth rate of 29%.\n\nExpectations were high for Alibaba's Singles Day annual shopping event in November, China's biggest shopping day. The company didn't disappoint as sales nearly doubled from the year-ago period to $74 billion.\n\nThe company has been able to stay in growth mode despite a slowdown in its core e-commerce business.\n\nAlibaba's business in China looks a lot like Amazon's in the U.S. Alibaba\u2019s cloud-computing business is showing solid growth, just like Amazon's booming web services business.\n\nFor its current fiscal year 2022, Alibaba is expected to earn $9.58 a share, down 4% compared to 2021. But growth is expected to ramp higher in 2023, up 23% to $11.79.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TLDR:**\n\nAlibaba keeps having an astonishing growth while the price declined from the previous high. Regulation will weigh on future performance but long-term growth will remain and the current price looks like a bargain.",

JPOW continues his reign of printing and the FED is ded. SPY will reach 600 this year and this guy\u2019s (I can't find said user lol) calls will go ITM. Everyone wants a correction, so naturally, it will never happen (at least in the near future). \n\nYou may have heard of theta gang before, but the lesser-known Vega Gang is not only more cost-effective, less time-consuming, but works perfectly in the current low volatility, ultra degenerate economy we have today.\n\nIf you don\u2019t already know, the vega value on your options shows how much your call or put increases in value for every 1% increase in IV. High Vega in an option means when volatility jumps (like during a crash) in the overall market (see VIX) and IV jumps massively across the board, your option will increase MASSIVELY in price regardless of the direction it moves in. \n\nNow, what options generally have the highest vega? Far dated ones, specifically LEAPS. Now, if we are using this to hedge a crash, we expect a sudden and large movement, so going FAR OTM is the big brain play. Basically, we want **cheap, Far OTM LEAPS**, to hedge our portfolios. \n\nUpon running all the calculations, I have concluded that I have ***no money at risk***. These puts are already **worthless (20 cents)** and it is **unlikely they can become even more worthless**.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[ Just like our autistic savant Michael Burry once said, \u201cThou puts are risk free, eventually.\u201d ](https://preview.redd.it/9hgo2s72kxh71.png?width=580&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=27f445da9d39cdc1fe3ce3160b590f19a92d52cf)\n\n\\---\n\nFor those of you who don\u2019t know how to read and only trade SPY calls:\n\n**WHY SPY JUNE 17 2022 100 PUTS is the ULTIMATE 100 bagger trade:**\n\n* You have an **entire year** for this trade to work out (although move to 2023 ones by January).\n* Delta is almost 0 so price movement barely effects the currently worthless puts\n* **Vega is juicy** and the puts are **dirt cheap**. \n* **Options calculator is showing some massive theoretical returns that may even be an underestimate.**\n* **Over the next year you just need one spike in IV for MASSIVE TENDIES. I know you\u2019re terrible at timing the market, but this gives you a chance to be a \ufe0f\u200d\ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b without actually needing the market to tank immediately. You just need IV to increase and that can happen if SPY goes up faster as well, to 690.**\n\nBased on options calculator, **and a 50% IV increase** (during the corona crash it hit nearly 150% to 200% on some SPY options), this is the profit chart over the next **5 months**: \n\n[You can go to optionsprofitcalculator to see the rest of the dates.](https://preview.redd.it/zs7nx5qakxh71.png?width=420&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e26b2da355b985f3c5d0876f8aa71e8cf9b9e3d6)\n\n**With a 100% IV increase**, this is the profit chart if there is a correciton in the next **5 months**: \n\n[You can go to optionsprofitcalculator to see the rest of the dates.](https://preview.redd.it/l482u44hkxh71.png?width=409&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b6f1fd16d3a70378dd88ac18d8620ccb85b93dee)\n\nCurrently these are worth around 20 cents and a 20% correction (SPY $360) with 50% IV increase would mean these would each be worth $5.05 even if said correction happened by end of year, or about a **25 bagger**. With a 100% IV increase, these would be worth about $20.00, or a **100 bagger**. Even if the correction took a year, or SPY goes to 600 by the beginning of next year, this would be a multi bagger play. The only way you lose is if SPY stays flat for half a year, which we all know is not happening.\n\nBasically, unless SPY reaches 600 by next year and IV never increases or it stays flat, these puts will at a minimum keep the same value. Which is why I consider this a **risk free hedge**. Having 2% of the port in these puts acts as free insurance against the rest of your money. \n\n**I am also doing the same thing with TSLA 50P JAN 2023. However, I only have a few of these and because it\u2019s not as liquid, this is a pretty retarded play that nobody should be doing. However, I am sure almost all of you will be doing this exact same play. My reasoning behind this is that if there were a crash, TSLA would tank the most due to having an extremely inflated stock price with numbers that don\u2019t justify its current market cap.** \n\nAlso, **this does not mean I think SPY will go to $100 or TSLA will go to $50 lol**, FAR OTM just maximizes profit. If these puts went ITM, we all have far bigger issues to worry about. \n\n**# I\u2019M AN IDIOT, WHAT\u2019S THE PLAY?**\n\n**SPY JUNE 17 2022 100P**\n\n**TSLA JAN 2023 50P (please don\u2019t do this\ud83e\udd21)**\n\n **I plan to hold these puts until they print. Not financial advice.**  I will be listening to [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTTUKejngiw) on repeat until then. I would also like to credit u/Duke_Shambles for the original idea. I was in TSLA 50P before his callout**\ud83e\udd21.**",

        "selftext": "Autist are you ready? Retard are you ready? Lets get it on!!! Welcome ya bunch of filthy degenerates. I have in my painstakingly long research come across a company that everyone is sure to love for all the right reasons. Raise your hands if you turn off the television when there's a fight during a sports event (\\**crickets\\*)*. Unless your name is Cletis and you are the product of seven generations of inbreeding, chances are that you tune in more when there's a fight going on than you would for any sports event. Now let me add to this enticing recipe another layer, women. Not salivating yet? ok, fine, women fighting. Here we have the greatest and oldest sport of all time. **$EDR is the parent company of the Ultimate Fighting Championship.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[\u201cAnd NOWWWW the moment all you retards have been waiting for\u2026\u201d  ](https://preview.redd.it/4gjsmlxy94i71.jpg?width=1200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=033f0d6fca2d272074e7da1511cc5263f578f2dc)\n\nI know what you guys are thinking, \"But Prest, our lord and savior Benjamin Graham advised us not to invest in companies that haven\u2019t had a 20 year record of dividend payments.\u201d Fear not, for $EDR (I will be referring to the Ultimate Fighting Championship as $EDR from here on out) has been around since the 90's and has a proven track record of continual growth year after year. It all started in the jungle of Botswana in the year 1982 when you mother and I first met.... oh wait, sorry wrong story.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[\u201cFundamentals? \u2026\u2026 Jamie pull up that video of Hitler going all in on options\u201d](https://preview.redd.it/11jbakm1a4i71.jpg?width=2037&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8444b43cab4da1a96791903e58c3f0f9351ca53a)\n\n  \n\nThe year was 1993; a struggling new company called the Ultimate Fighting Championship was a tiny unsanctioned mixed martial arts organization on the cusp of bankruptcy. Cage fighting was not something people were accustomed to watching at that time. The closest thing to it was boxing, but boxing was a sport on the decline. Gone are the days of Muhammad Ali and Mike Tyson, now you have boxers represented by different promotions each with their own agendas and rules for how and when their fighters will fight.\n\nThis is why it took so long for the Mayweather vs Pacquiao fight to occur. And what did we get when that fight finally happened? An absolute snooze fest of two fighters point fighting and putting the crowd to sleep. Some people paid top dollar to watch that card, some upwards of $100 for the pay-per-view (luckily, I found my neighbors credit card on the pavement so I paid nothing).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Khabib Nurmagomedov: \u201cWhy you no buy $EDR? you know its great investment\u201d  ](https://preview.redd.it/5bgan924a4i71.jpg?width=640&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d07d6b9b67921e4adcb92454c487f38ccdd9fae3)\n\nEnter $EDR; all the top fighters in the world fighting under the same promotion with none of the politics that boxing brings with it. Now here's the kicker, the fighters don't get paid what they should and are bound by an iron clad contract. These contracts are tighter than the pre-nup Jeff Bezos' new wife is going to have to sign.\n\nThe fighters are not allowed to fight under any other banner and must obtain consent from $EDR if they want to do anything else that may harm their ability to fight. Now I know some of you have the attention spans of gold fish so I\u2019m going to break down the rest of this DD into four categories:\n\n**1.** **Competition? What\u2019s that?**\n\n**2.** **Papa White**\n\n**3.** **Fighter pay or lack thereof**\n\n**4.** **Five letters G-R-O-W-T-H**\n\n**1)** **Competition? What\u2019s that?**\n\n$EDR has no competition. There are other promotions out there but none of them come in as a close second. **No one tunes in to watch Bellator instead of watching the $EDR.** $EDR is like your wife, she\u2019s reliable, she\u2019s not going anywhere and even though she has a boyfriend neither of you have any illusions of separating.\n\nEnter your side piece, Bellator, you give her attention only when your lady isn\u2019t around. You text her at times \u201cI love you baby\u201d or \u201cYou\u2019re so beautiful,\u201d anything to give her that false sense of hope that you might actually care about who she is as a person, LMAO. Not happening Bellator, I thoroughly enjoy our times in the back seat of the car but what I already see of you is all I ever want to see of you.\n\n\u201cBut Prest, what happens if you run into your side piece while you\u2019re with your lady?\u201d Exactly the same thing that happens when Bellator comes on at the same time $EDR is on, at that moment you\u2019ve never heard of Bellator and act completely oblivious.\n\nIn the early days of $EDR, the fighting landscape was very different than what it is today. All of the best fighters in the world were spread out on different continents and belonged to different promotions. Promotions such as Strikeforce, Pride Fighting Championship and the WEC were all great standard bearers for the sport in the early days.\n\n$EDR bought out all of these organizations. Their fighters were (for the most part) absorbed into the $EDR, which now houses the greatest concentration of world class mixed martial artists in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[\u201cthat right there ith the rocket thhip Dana White ith going to take uth to the moon in\u201d  ](https://preview.redd.it/blel2nr7a4i71.jpg?width=640&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=30d94e5a1872ecc024ce0df26d17b50279d78763)\n\n**2) Papa White**\n\n**No one person has had more of an impact on the sport than $EDR President Dana White.** Often brash and speaking straight from the gut, Dana White is the reason why this once struggling company is now valued at over $10 billion. The role of management speaks a great deal about how a company is guided and its future aspirations. First and foremost, Dana is an avid fight fan, you can see his shiny bald head seated cage side at almost every event. His name is synonymous with $EDR, which is why when Endeavor purchased the company, it insisted Dana White remain as the promotions president.\n\nHate him or love him, the MMA community acknowledges that the sport would not be where it is today without Dana. I believe this kind of work ethic cannot be fostered and can only exist in someone that is truly passionate about their work.\n\nWhen asked recently about his plans for retirement, Dana stated \u201c*I love this sport, and* *I love this company. I love all the people that I\u2019m working with every day.* *I can\u2019t imagine doing anything else.*\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[\u201cFight of the Night goes to Jon Jones, he gets a 15&amp;#37; off coupon\u201d](https://preview.redd.it/ryyy44kaa4i71.jpg?width=1000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e6f9f3688de5af7a506f9738d4f661897e1933c9)\n\n  \n\n**3) Fighter pay or lack thereof**\n\nFighter pay is not a subject the promotion likes to discuss. **A large majority of the revenue generated by $EDR goes directly to the promotion and not to the fighters.** Although the **fighters are signed as** **independent contractors**, many restrictions are placed on them that prevent them from achieving their full earnings potential. Fighters are not represented by any union so there are no collective bargaining agreements to help them strengthen their position during negotiations.\n\nThis is the reason why I believe $EDR has been so successful and why it will continue to thrive in the future. While other sports pay 50% of their revenue to the athletes, $EDR pays only 15-20%. Simply put, **the $EDR is a money-making machine that is taking advantage of the significant position it holds over the sport as well as the fighters.**\n\n**4)** **Five letters G-R-O-W-T-H**\n\n**Analysts have ignored $EDR**. On Monday, the company blew past earnings because the expectations did not take into account the resiliency with which Dana White continues to push the envelope during the pandemic. The reason $EDR\u2019s guidance was raised and it blew past earnings per share is because the analysts did not think $EDR would be selling out stadiums this early into the reopening.\n\n**My research leads me to conclude that $EDR is the best reopening play in 2021.** The company\u2019s introduction into the market has only seen an economy in which stadiums are closed and public attendance is restricted. **With the reopening of the economy underway, I expect $EDR to blow past earnings for the remainder of the year.** Live gate and attendance will continue to rise for the company and they will beat expectations because the company is new to the market and the **analysts are not familiar with $EDR management.**\n\nDuring the early days of the pandemic, restrictions were placed on public gatherings. Arenas and stadiums were closed to $EDR events. So the company must have shut down, right? Wrong, $EDR shifted operations to Abu Dhabi and declared that the show must go on; this was a year before the company\u2019s IPO. **Analysts were not looking at the company then and are largely ignoring it now.**\n\nThe analysts are not familiar with $EDR management and more specifically Dana White. When asked recently whether the company would be going back to no audience shows if the pandemic once again forces closures of public venues, Dana White replied, \u201cNever, we\u2019ll alternate between Florida, Texas, and Abu Dhabi if we have to.\u201d\n\nTLDR: The Ultimate Fighting Championship ($EDR) is the premier mixed martial arts promotion in the world. It is a highly profitable organization that, unlike other sports organizations, does not pay its fighters an equal share of revenue generated from its business. It is the best reopening play for the remainder of 2021 because analysts are unfamiliar with the work ethic behind $EDR management and more specifically president Dana White. This highly successful business model combined with the position the company holds as a monopoly in the sport, all but ensures that continual growth can be projected from $EDR.\n\nPosition:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pk2f8o2da4i71.png?width=1125&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4b04dc19a51b6e9f35396f309603dfb6de096543\n\n*Disclaimer: This is not financial advice, I am not a financial advisor, Please do your own research.*",

        "selftext": "There are three fairly basic ways that new traders lose money in 2021:\n\n**1)** They read some elaborate post about how some piece of garbage stock is the next MEME explosion.  To their newbie eyes the extensive DD looked convincing, and the stock is *only* $10 a share right now, so they they buy 1,000 shares.  And then they average down another 1,000. Two months later they are being told by the same people that were wrong about their DD to begin with,  to hold on to the now, $8 stock.  Even worse, they now believe that selling that stock is \"exactly what the evil hedge funds want you to do!\".  A few months after that they are questioning their life choices and stuck with a useless $4 stock.\n\n**2)** Most YouTube videos are geared towards trying to sell you a method of Day Trading that is based on *Gap n Go* strategies.  These methods, while real, are far more difficult than they are made to appear, but yet they are very marketable (i.e. \"how to turn $5,000 into $50,000!\").  Instead what happens is new traders become singularly focused on finding low float, highly shorted stocks that jump up after the open, convinced they are moments away from the next big score.  Once again, months later they are questioning their life choices and stuck with an account that has dropped far below the PDT requirements\n\nAnd finally that brings us to OTM options:\n\n**3)** Slightly more sophisticated than the first two methods of losing your money, this one requires actual thought and analysis.  \n\nThe appeal is obvious - they are cheap.  And if the stock explodes those options can double, triple, etc in value.  \n\nHere's why they don't work - The options themselves have no real value other than the pure premium you are paying.  When *buying* options, your goal should always be to pay as little premium as possible.  Ideally you would have options at total parity (i.e. Stock is at $100 and the $99 Call Option is worth - $1).  \n\nSimple formula here for ITM Options - (Strike Price + Option Price) - Stock Price = Premium you are paying.\n\nSimpler formula for OTM Options - Option Price = Premium you are paying.\n\nSo let's take an example -\n\nYou like **CSCO,** it is smart pick, the daily chart looks good, it is past earnings (and seriously, please stop holding options over earnings) and looks like clear skies ahead.  Two choices:\n\n56 Strike Call, Expires Aug 27th for $2.35\n\n59 Strike Call, Expires Aug 27th for .30 cents\n\nLet's say you are going to spend $500 - so you can get 2 of the 56 Calls or 16 of the 59 Calls.  \n\nIf next week CSCO hardly moves at all (current at $58.22), your 56 calls will be worth $2.22 - a loss of only 13 cents per call or $26.  \n\nHowever, in that same scenario, your 59 calls will expire worthless, a loss of $480.  \n\nOK, let's say CSCO goes up $1 next week, it is now at $59.22 - \n\nYour 56 Calls are now worth $3.22 (at expiration), a profit of .87 per call or $174.\n\nYour 59 calls are now worth .22 a loss of .08 per Call or -$128.\n\n**OTM Options place heavy lifting on the stock to get you to profitability.  You are betting on a huge move in the stock that pull your options ITM faster than Theta strips away their value.**    \n\n***You are almost always better off going with ITM options, that have a Delta of .6 or higher and are at least a week out, if not more.***  \n\nIn fact, if you just stuck to these three rules it would increase you likelihood of success a great deal:\n\n**1) Do not trade Options over earnings, trade them before, trade them after, but do not hold them** ***over*** **the earnings announcement.**\n\n**2) Do not go for the cheaper OTM options, instead choose Calls or Puts that have a higher Delta and are farther out in time.**\n\n**3) Do not trade Option Spreads unless you know how to leg out of them if they do not go your way.**\n\n(the 3rd one may seem like a small issue, but the number of people that get stuck in spreads they do not know how to exit is alarmingly high).\n\nThis advice may seem basic to some traders here, but if you look at the posts on this forum you will quickly see that the foundational rules you may have been following as a trader aren't as obvious as you think.  New traders clearly do not know these basic principles and we should stop assuming they do.",

So brrrrrrrrr it keeps going; at least for six more months. \n\n**Summary of Speech:**\n\nHe talked for a while and basically rehashed the same stuff he\u2019s been saying. Let me save you your time:\n\n*  Inflation is transitory. Nothing to see here.\n*  Inflation should get back to 2%\n*  Covid could still pose a problem, even though the recovery is moving right along. \n\nJPow said nothing about when QE might slow down; only that he ***might do it if*** the economy gets stronger. Which is what\u2019s he\u2019s said for a year? This is a very weaksauce indicator. \n\n**Economic Metrics:**\n\nStocks? All time highs.\n\nHousing prices? All time highs.\n\nUnemployment? 5%? Companies are begging for workers and $15/hr is the defacto minimum wage. \n\nInflation? It is also roaring. \n\nThere is no economic case to keep QE running at $120 billion per year.  The market can stay irrational longer than bears can stay solvent, especially when the market is pumped up by brrrrrrrr.\n\nSo what happened and how can we make money?\n\nThe $USD nose-dived on Powell\u2019s speech. Various US dollar ETFs (DXY, UUP, USDU, UDN) are now hitting their 50 day moving averages or moving in that direction.  Just pick one of those ETFs and look at their chart.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4sc0069ej3k71.jpg?width=1589&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=74daa04d179749b165fc625310bd69be8309ccaa\n\nHere is another example from another US Dollar ETF. Both show their 200 day and 50 day moving averages coming together, and now they are hitting or crashing through their 50 day. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/88eh38ggj3k71.jpg?width=1592&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=07b1d395c0abde85105304307628df90298027c8\n\nGLD and other gold etfs also broke above their long term moving averages after JPow\u2019s speech. Here is GLD. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pi49fxxij3k71.jpg?width=1588&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0be5686a41e5ebfdb7121e7370f059276f84aab2\n\nThe fall in the Dollar and sharp rise in gold are both an important signal. If the US Dollar holds here, its strengthening is over and it is time to go (stay?) whole hog into inflationary stocks, precious metals, etc.   And that\u2019s what most of us are holding, so that\u2019s good news. \n\nOne final note: When you see tables like this on CNBC, ignore them (more than you already do)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/32mybqwlj3k71.jpg?width=1206&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=589b532bd025f329aae3fe1244a6d43870d5fc9b\n\nIn every textbook or old investing book, for like 100 years, bonds were a good indicator of inflation and deflation. Bond traders were very savvy, the markets were deep and liquid, etc. But with years of QE, the Fed now owns trillions of dollars of bonds, and is still spending nearly $1 trillion per year buying more Treasury bonds. For certain US treasury bonds, the Fed owns more than 50% of the outstanding bonds. So, the bond market is not going to react as accurately as in the past, when the biggest whale in the pond only buys bonds, and never sells them, and buys \\~$80 billion of Treasury bonds per month.  And JPow has committed to keep buying them for at least 6 months.\n\nBull market continues, inflation will rip. \n\nBuy 3 and 6 month out SPY calls. Other inflationary plays are stuff like GLD, Rio Tinto (RTNTF), Freeport McMoRan (FCX), and individual gold and silver mining companies and ETFs, but each of these asset types can have individual risks and are not purely driven by inflation.",

        "selftext": "\nJPow\u2019s time at the Fed is coming to an end with his term expiring in February 2022. Biden will not renominate him as Chair and instead will nominate Lael Brainard. Lael Brainard is a current Fed Governor and was nominated as a Governor in 2012 along with JPow. Since many of you enjoyed my post on China, I thought I may share my thoughts on the Fed. \n\n1. Spending is politically popular. Politicians are only focused on the next election, whether it be a House or Senate seat, or even the Presidency. The level of deficit spending the US currently engages in would not be possible unless the Fed agrees to purchase the issuance by Treasury. While the Fed may call this QE, it is not. This is monetizing deficits (or money printing) because the Fed is buying new Treasury issuance from a broker dealer immediately after it buy them from Treasury auctions (for those who don\u2019t know broker deals are required to bid on Treasury auctions). Janet Yellen wants JPow to buy as much Treasury bonds as possible as the market does not want this negative yielding asset (it is negative yielding because of high inflation currently). This is seen through the 120Bn in monthly purchases (80Bn treasury bonds, 40Bn MBS). \n\n2. Biden has said publicly he wishes to elevate women or people of color. JPow is neither of those. He is a 68 year old white dude with years of Wall Street experience as MP at the Carlyle Group. The Carlyle Group is a private equity firm founded by David Rubenstein in the mid 1980s. \n\n3. JPow is trying to simp for the job. I have watched JPow for many years and have noticed recently he has changed his tune. He now seems to care about regulating Wall Street, climate change, and income inequality. These views were absent during the Trump administration. JPow has also expressed an interest in running the economy hot (with high inflation) to ensure a full job recovery. This directly contradicts his actions in 2018 where he was only interested in raising interest rates at the first sign of inflation. \n\n4. Lael Brainard, a Fed governor, shares many of the same views as Progressives. She is a woman and a Democrat, where JPow is a Republican. Most importantly, she is publicly calling for the Fed to adopt a digital Dollar, which is in direct conflict with her colleagues. Brainard joined the Fed in 2012 (the same time as JPow) and has a good relationship with Janet Yellen. Under Brainard\u2019s leadership the Fed would be less likely to taper, if at all. This would allow the Fed to continue to monetize deficits which would allow for more politically popular spending.\n\nI have no positions in the market other than a SPAC I am going to redeem. The rest of my assets are in cash. JPow will be told whether he has the job in September, although I am still staying on the sidelines after being burned in Chinese stocks.",

        "selftext": "Background:  The eviction moratorium began as part of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act)\u00a0signed into law in March 2020 as a 120-day eviction moratorium for rental properties that are part of **federal assistance programs** or are subject to federally backed loans. Some, but not all, states adopted their own temporary eviction moratorium as well. The CARES Act eviction moratorium expired in July 2020. The CDC then imposed its own eviction moratorium halting residential evictions.\u00a0Congress temporarily extended the CDC order once, and then the CDC extended it several more times to 30 June 2021.  Source 1: [https://www.bizjournals.com/jacksonville/news/2021/07/30/foreclosure-moratorium-ending-july-31.html](https://www.bizjournals.com/jacksonville/news/2021/07/30/foreclosure-moratorium-ending-july-31.html) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, you are probably thinking that what happens next is an enlightening conversation on government intervention and clear overstepping of authority by the centers for disease and control.  You, like everyone else, is wondering if the power is going to go out while your tendies are still cooking in the microwave by the great depression 2.  Do you sense a disturbance in the force?  Millions of voices crying out as the door hits their ass on the way out?  Well my fellow retard, you just clicked on a Slut\\_Spoiler shitpost discussion, and it's too late now.  The synthesizer is riffing and you have to wait at least until Rick Astley starts singing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have been searching for a while online how I can live that \"not much but honest life\" of a dairy farmer that milks the government.  I was raised to be a contributing member of society and still trying to break the habit.  You probably noticed I bolded text in the first paragraph.  It's important to note that this moratorium only affects those with less than 99k in gross income or twice that for a family.  Further, to be eligble for that, you have to show you have been actively seeking employment.  Wow, 99k gross income!  That's a lotta fucking people! and everyone with a friend named Reggie can verify, committing fraud by showing that you are actively looking for employment is easy to do.  Almost as easy as making an ineligible resume on a napkin. This is the classic unemployment benefits hustle.  \n\nOne time I got a resume from a guy.  It was an e-mail.  Said  \"I am electrician\".  That was it.  That was this guys Resume, Cover Letter, and Curriculum Vitae, but his Modus Operandi was being able to show the unemployment office that he had contacted us and put his best foot forward to get a job.  Well, that's another month of making more money than you would get working (California).  According to the GOV, he has made an effort to get employment.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, there are a few more bylaws in there to protect you.  The wording is very lose.  \"If you **may** become homeless or be forced to live in a more crowded space\" you are eligible for the federal program.  Not sure how they plan on enforcing that, but it's beside the point.  As long as you aren't being violent or destructive you can't be kicked out. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis word \"may\" is a problem for me.  As in:  \"You **may** have an enormous back rent bill when the moratorium terminates.  If so, you **may** want to consider using the federal aid to help\".  Even after not paying rent for months and getting unemployment, the federal government still has programs to help those in need.  There isn't going to be a crisis. there isn't going to be global crash in the housing market.  There isn't going to be a bunch of people on vacation getting called back to reality.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo let's throw out some scenarios.  Scenario Alpha: What we have is tennant A who hasn't paid his rent for a year and 4 months, and we have tennant B across the street who has done the same thing.  How much money have they saved? to just put a rent number out there (I'll use $1,000) and multiplying it by 16 months is going to give you an impressive cushion: $16,000.  These guys making 99k and under, with $16,000 savings aren't worried about being kicked out, because they are just going to move across the street.  Tennant A and Tennant B will do an apartment swap, the landlords gets fucked over and the crisis is averted.  The landlords of these tennants just want someone to come in who will pay, and guess who's been building up a nice nest egg?  Obviously, these tennants have to leave.  The bridge is burned.  Would you let some guy who's been pennyfarthing about with your money stay?  At a certain point, this shit gets personal.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nScenario Omega: Landlord finally is able to remove his tennant.  He jumps for joy that he can start collecting rent again from an actively employed tennant.  The last guy leaves, looks for a house, and puts down a down payment.  Thanks to his savings.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnother thing to think about is that this is giving people OPPURTUNITY.  They are out of work, everywhere is hiring.  Always wanted to live in New York? the Governor is begging for people to come and get mugged.  Want to go to anywhere in the US and start your life over?  It's totally possible when there aren't any strings attached to you like job and rent, and you can afford the cost of starting over.  \n\nFinally, I think that the real DD will be in the comments, which is a common theme with you animals.  As for me, I've paid rent this whole time LIKE AN IDIOT.  However, being honest is kind of the only thing that helps me sleep at night.  That and not jeopardizing the roof over my head.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr invest in $UHAL.  I'm sure business will be booming even more than it already has.\n\n\ud83c\udfb6We're no strangers to love\ud83c\udfb6",

        "selftext": "So already as of March 2021, [passive funds have gained a majority share of the U.S. fund market](https://www.bloomberg.com/professional/blog/passive-likely-overtakes-active-by-2026-earlier-if-bear-market/).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/si6thz5vr6k71.png?width=622&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=39e138185ca3c645ff34418253624af42530ec89\n\nThis means that passive funds that track the S&amp;P 500 and other diverse markets are now larger in market share than actively managed funds in domestic markets. This graph also shows the massive growth in fund market share by passive funds compared to active funds over the last 6 years.\n\nThis growth I think is being caused by widespread support for index investing. Nearly every news article, informational paper, and online forum are all repeating the same message of investing into passive growth funds/ETFs and just holding them no matter what happens, even during large downturns. Historical data supports this and many well known investing figures also share this message. Even most new investors it seems after small losses from active trading or trying to time the market are converted to this philosophy.\n\nWhich leads me to the question: how does it ever go down here? People are being indoctrinated to keep holding during every crash and even buy dips with excess money. Historically selling at the bottom is the worst possible situation and everyone seems to know this. The rise in 401k usage and passive tax advantaged funds with penalties for withdrawing from the market also supports this. So if retail investors make up [77% of the market](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/who-counts-as-a-retail-investor-2020-12-17), who is left that actually sells their equities?\n\nI guess market makers with HFT bots are the only answer. These bots will attempt to sell at the instant sign of bad news in order to try to shake out weak hands, start a crash, and buy at the bottom. The recent March 2020 crash is an example of how this sell then buy cycle is getting shorter and shorter as less retail gets shaken off. The more market confidence grows and the more people hold through the dips, the shorter and less severe these crashes get.\n\nI also ate crayons for breakfast so do others have better insights into how crashes happen?\n\nPositions:\n\nTQQQ Jan 20 2023 70c\n\nTL;DR: This post marks the top, inverse accordingly.",

I'm sure everyone's aware of the general situation so I won't go into detail, but just wanted to preface this half-arsed DD with a nice sentiment so that I don't feel like a wanker for trying to profit off the Taliban.. Anyways.\n\nIt's estimated by the UNODC that Afghanistan supply more than 80% of global opium and heroin (and as high as 95% in Europe) - yep, those Taliban bastards just love plantin poppy's. Just last year, poppy cultivation in the region soared by 37%. Given that the Taliban have recently gained control of the whole country we can assume these production levels are only going to increase significantly as more land is utilised for poppy farming.\n\nMy retard logic is thinking the following - Greater supply = cheaper prices for consumers, and more drug users. This will ultimately lead to an increase in people who will need to seek treatment. \n\nBasically - right now I'd be looking into Pharmaceutical companies who specialise in medication used to help those who abuse substances (Methodone, Naloxone etc.). I've got my eyes on $ALK - mainly because they're not some penny stock pharmacuetical company that I might get shafted on, and because one of their main focuses is around substance misuse treatment. I'm not going to go fully into the details though because no body will read it anyway - so I wouldn't even call this DD, more of a 'open your eyes' post for those that want to look into it further.",

Important bits bolded and tldr at the bottom if you can\u2019t read too well.\n\n**Table of Contents:**\n\nI. Introduction\n\nII. Overview\n\nIII. Partnerships\n\nIV. Sales\n\nV. Advantage\n\nVI. Connections\n\nVII. The Plunge\n\nVIII. Financials\n\nIX. Growth and Long Term Strategy\n\nX. Conclusion\n\n**I. Introduction:**\n\nProterra designs and manufactures zero-emission electric transit vehicles and EV technology solutions for commercial applications. Founded in 2004, Proterra is a monster in electric bus manufacturing in the United States, with over 600 busses delivered, 750 million in backlog, and over 20 million miles of service[ already bagged.](https://www.proterra.com/) The company has a very bright future no matter what, but the Infrastructure bill makes that future a whole lot brighter.\n\nThe bipartisan Infrastructure Bill has about 1 trillion dollars for various projects and initiatives with WSJ reporting that it is expected to include \u201c**$39 billion in new funding** to modernize public transit and[ replace thousands of buses](https://www.wsj.com/articles/infrastructure-agreement-on-major-issues-reached-by-bipartisan-group-gop-negotiator-says-11627487459) with zero-emission vehicles\u201d.\n\nNow, the specific language of the bill has not been written yet, but even a fraction of this $39 billion would represent an **absolutely massive, and I mean truly gargantuan, increase in funding for electric busses**. Right now, the main way electric busses get funded is through the Federal Transit Administration\u2019s Low or No Emission Vehicle Program (\u201cLow-No\u201d) [which has only given about $600m over the last six years](https://www.atlasevhub.com/data_story/more-than-2-6-billion-in-public-funding-for-evs/). No, that's not $600m per year, t**hat's $600m overall**. That means that funding for electric transit busses is about to jump from around an average of $100m per year to having access to a potential $39 billion. Even just $1 billion of this would represent a **1000% increase in funding**. This legislation represents a seismic shift in the electric bus market that would supercharge any companies in this particular sector, with analysts predicting this new money will balloon the US ebus market[ five-fold to $2.7 Billion by 2024 alone.](https://www.reuters.com/business/sustainable-business/five-facts-why-electric-buses-are-key-bidens-green-agenda-2021-07-14/)\n\nTwo companies stand out in this regard: Proterra, and BYD.\n\nBYD is a Chinese manufacturing company that, among other things, manufactures a shit ton of electric busses. In China, they fill contracts ranging in the [tens of thousands](https://insideevs.com/news/521895/china-byd-plugin-sales-june2021/). In the US, their subsidiary has completed some of the largest electric bus contracts in the US and is aggressively moving to expand production, technical capacity, and acquire more contracts.\n\nThey have one big problem though. Politicians in both the Republican and Democratic parties have acknowledged the rise of China linked energy companies as a threat to US national security. Nobody wants to move from having OPEC hold us by the balls by controlling oil supplies to China suddenly having an undue influence on the very means of public transportation in our streets.\n\nDue to this, at the end of 2019[ Congress passed language](https://www.wsj.com/articles/congress-wants-to-ban-chinese-buses-railcars-in-defense-bill-11575927925) in the National Defense Authorization Act that bars use of federal funds to purchase Chinese busses. In fact, they [explicitly called out BYD by name](https://www.freightwaves.com/news/lawmakers-slam-china-controlled-truck-maker-byd-as-threat-to-u-s) as a national security threat and prime target for blacklisting from taxpayer money.\n\nThis means that there is a relatively good chance that BYD will struggle to receive much of the proposed funding for bus electrification in the upcoming Infrastructure Bill. Even with them having a unionized, American workforce in 99% American factories, they still have not been able to convince politicians that they match the requirements for \u201cBuy American\u201d initiatives.\n\nTherefore, a sizable amount of the remaining money designated for electric bus adoption will fall to the other top electric transit bus maker in the United States: Proterra.\n\n**II. Overview:**\n\nBased in deep blue California with a factory in red South Carolina, Proterra is the ideal vehicle to advance Democrats' vision of enacting deep climate change fighting policies as well as providing good, well paying American jobs to boost local manufacturing industries. Indeed, Proterra has already been recognized by the current administration as vital to future Democratic political ambitions, with President Joe Biden[ touring their plant virtually](https://www.greenvilleonline.com/story/news/local/greenville/2021/04/20/joe-biden-visit-greenville-sc-virtual-local-electric-bus-manufacturing/7300675002/) and Vice president Kamala[ touring their partner](https://www.schoolbusfleet.com/10141979/thomas-built-buses-gets-visit-from-vice-president-harris-during-earth-week) Thomas Built Busses in person.\n\nTransportation in the US currently accounts for[ 29% of all US emissions](https://www.epa.gov/greenvehicles/fast-facts-transportation-greenhouse-gas-emissions), making it the highest contributing sector to CO2 levels. A strengthening of public transit and an increase in electric bus adoption[ would make more of a difference than almost any other policy](https://mobile.reuters.com/video/watch/why-electric-buses-are-key-to-bidens-gre-id732925804) the White House could enact.\n\nDespite this though, only[ 2% of US busses currently are electric](https://electricvehicles.in/electric-bus-revolution/). Comparatively, China, at the end of 2017, was hitting at least[ 17% of busses being electric](https://www.sustainable-bus.com/electric-bus/electric-bus-public-transport-main-fleets-projects-around-world/) while, overall, [99% of electric busses world wide](https://content.sierraclub.org/evguide/blog/2018/05/when-it-comes-electric-buses-china-killing-it) are being produced in and for China. This is not even mentioning huge electric bus orders in both India and throughout Europe that easily outpace America's own efforts. The United States is badly losing the Green tech race, by almost every measure.\n\nThe Infrastructure Bill, however, promises to turn that all around. And a land where no one wears shoes is a prime opportunity for a shoe manufacturer.\n\nDue to this, there are many companies that will inevitably benefit. New Flyer, Lion Electric company, Vicinity Motors and other electric bus makers will most likely see significant upside from upcoming government subsidies and contracts. However, Proterra stands out as the number one domestic pure electric bus maker in the United States with extensive recognition by the US government.\n\nMore significant than any of this though, is that the main advantage Proterra has over other electric transit bus companies is that **PROTERRA IS NOT AN ELECTRIC BUS COMPANY**. Though most people, including the government, recognize Proterra as a leader in the US ebus market, their true potential and current market strategy is so, so much more.\n\nProterra has three modes of revenue: Powered, Transit, and Energy.\n\n* **Transit:** designs and builds the busses\n* **Powered:** develops and distributes electric powertrains and battery system for various commercial vehicle partners\n* **Energy:** offers full scale electric support infrastructure in terms of design, build, financing, operations, maintenance and energy optimization.\n\nThis means that while building electric busses is currently their bread and butter, their business is increasingly having to do with **Proterra Powered** and being more of a pick and shovel play: providing complete battery packs, technology, and powertrains to other companies looking to go electric. To simplify this, it means that instead of trying to build a whole new electric vehicle and market it to potential customers, Proterras strategy is instead just focus on the battery and electric parts while partnering with already established big name brands to let them build the actual vehicle. This allows for them to straighten profit margins and avoid competition with older companies.\n\nIn essence, this massively expands their potential market penetration and enables them to surmount being pigeonholed into one particular sector, like how many of their competitors are in the commercial transit bus market.\n\n**III. Partnerships:**\n\nAnd before you think this is some pie in the sky vision they have, the reality is that Proterra is already the #1 leader in electric commercial vehicles with a ton of key partnerships with established blue chip companies. These partnerships are the foundation to Proterras long term strategy, allowing them to expand into new markets for vehicles to electrify. As of now, they are involved with powering.\n\n* Thomas school busses\n* Van hool coach busses\n* FCCC stepvans\n* Optimal shuttle busses\n* Komatsu excavators\n* Volta delivery trucks\n* Bustech transit busses\n* Lightening commercial vans\n* And just recently announced partnerships with ROUSH CleanTech and Penske Truck Leasing to develop Ford Motor Co's F-650 all-electric commercial truck, as well as a new partnership with Taylor Machine Works Inc. to develop an all-electric material forklift handler.\n\nAnd of course, this isn\u2019t even getting into how Daimler Trucks, which is the **leading heavy-duty truck manufacturer** in North America, is a[ major Proterra investor](https://www.freightwaves.com/news/daimler-trucks-invests-in-proterra-electrification-spac) and technology partner. This particular connection gives Proterra credibility with larger, more established corporations, giving increased opportunities for expansion such as how Proterra works through Daimler subsidiary Freightliner Custom Chassis Corporation to build delivery trucks for companies such as **Fedex, UPS, and Amazon**. This massively expands their source of revenue, as yearly sales for this type of vehicle[ measure 200,000 compared to just 8,000 for transit busses](https://www.forbes.com/sites/alanohnsman/2020/02/28/electric-busmaker-proterra-using-its-silicon-valley-tech-to-make-green-freightliner-trucks/?sh=511c1e06351c). In fact, they estimate that by 2025, the bulk of their revenue will actually come from these \u201csecondary\u201d sources of income as opposed to their so far main business of electric transit busses.\n\n**IV. Sales:**\n\nBusses are only the tip of the iceberg of what Proterra is aiming to be. Beyond just electrifying just about every other vehicle offered in the commercial market, Proterra offers something that I personally have never seen from any other bus company: end-to-end electric vehicle solutions including charging stations and Proterra developed management software.\n\nThe main appeal of Proterra is that they have developed an integrated technology ecosystem of different products that promotes sales that they describe as being \u201csticky\u201d. **What this means is that once you buy one Proterra product, you're incredibly likely to buy something else as well**. Buy a bus - might as well buy their chargers - buy their charges - might as well buy their software system, and so on.\n\nImpressed with their transit busses? Well lucky for you your yellow school bus fleet is about to expire and the company you already have good relations with and have [a positive view of also makes that product](https://thomasbuiltbuses.com/bus-news-and-events/news/montgomery-county-public-schools-approves-the-2021-02-25/). Repeat business is a big plank of how Proterra operates. Currently, [80%](https://www.proterra.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/PTRA-ACTC-Analyst-Day-Presentation-4.8.21-FINAL-1.pdf) of Proterras Transit customers end up making an additional purchase from their Proterra Energy division. A perfect example of this is how Miami recently upped its Proterra bus fleet from 33 to a total of 75 busses, and then went ahead and[ hired Proterra to install one of the largest fleet charging systems in the U.S](https://www.proterra.com/press-release/miami-fleet-electrification/). Reputation is king with emerging technologies, and Proterra has deep networks with almost every transit agency in the US.\n\nIt's also important to note, circling back to the infrastructure bill, that on top of whatever money ends up being designated for transit busses, that there is also **$7.5 Billion** **for developing charging stations** and $**2.5 billion for school busses**, both areas that Proterra can take advantage of, as they offer full scale fleet charging stations and their partnership with Thomas Built busses means they are[ actively working with the number one school bus maker in the United States](https://www.greencarcongress.com/2021/05/20210506-tbb.html).\n\nGoing even farther, Proterra is fully **vertically integrated** almost all the way down their supply chain, with battery cells as one of the only third party components that is not built in house. However, they have secured around 2 GW of cells through 2022 through LG Chem, and are **currently planning their own battery facility**. That means that not only can they tap into government money meant for EV producers, but they can also take advantage of any funds allocated towards American battery producers, [a part which most likely will make up](https://www.hklaw.com/en/insights/publications/2021/07/climate-and-clean-energy-policy-state-of-play) a sizable portion of the 3.5 trillion dollar reconciliation bill that is currently being worked on.\n\n**V. Advantage:**\n\nProterras main advantage over other competitors is their head start on research in this sector and data obtained that you can only get from over a decade of real world experience. Proterra is currently on their 5th generation battery design and their 5th generation bus, with a combined over 20 million miles driven over their various vehicles. Furthermore, the partnerships and connections they have (both business and political) already established emphasize their first mover advantage.\n\nProterra also holds over **81 patents** and offers unique services such as their **APEX Connected Vehicle Intelligence System**, which is a cloud based data platform that helps customers manage and monitor their fleets, allowing them to optimize ownership and operations as well as providing state of the art analytics. Working this **SaaS** approach into their overall business model is pivotal in differentiating Proterra from other companies. Additionally, there is also potential to use programs like APEX to **transform Proterra Vehicle charging stations into Utility Grid Assets** which would offer another avenue for revenue and make their systems more attractive to prospective buyers. Proterra is the leading competitor for this necessary next step for all electric vehicle makers and[ is leagues ahead of any rivals](https://www.altenergymag.com/article/2020/12/the-promise-of-v2g-technology-%E2%80%94-and-how-it-could-accelerate-the-clean-energy-revolution/34214).\n\n**VI. Connections: It\u2019s all about who you know**\n\nI believe Proterras connections are **unparalleled** by any company and have established them as a preeminent force in both the **business and political world** that most other companies would be hard pressed to match. I won\u2019t go through all of them, but to highlight a few:\n\nJack Allen: Chief Executive Officer and Board Chairman\n\n* Over three decades of experience in the driving core businesses at Navistar International Corporation (**one of the largest trucking companies in the world**) serving as Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer President of their North America truck and parts division, President of Navistar\u2019s engine group, and has also has served as Vice President and General Manager of the company\u2019s parts organization.\n\nJennifer Granholm: Former Proterra board member (resigned to take cabinet job)\n\n* Current **Secretary of Energy** for Biden admin (the DoE is responsible for dealing out loans, contracts, and grants relating to electric busses and other vehicles.)\n* CNN political contributor (media connections)\n* Former Michigan Governor (deep ties with auto industry and championed auto bailout in 2008)\n\nRyan Popple: Co-founder and Executive Director\n\n* **Early employee of Tesla**, served as senior director of finance with a focus on strategic planning, technology cost reduction and corporate finance.\n\nDustin Grace: Chief Technology Officer\n\n* Nine years of powertrain development expertise from **Tesla Motors**\n* Worked R&amp;D at Honda for four years.\n\nJosh Ensign: Chief Operating Officer\n\n* Vice President of Manufacturing at **Tesla Motors**\n* Led global operations in Honeywell International\u2019s automotive and aerospace businesses\n\nJochen Goetz: Board member\n\n* 30 years experience and currently serving as Head of Finance &amp; Controlling at **Daimler Trucks &amp; Buses**\n* Lead positions at Mercedes-Benz Trucks, Powertrain, and Daimler Trucks North America divisions. He was the head of Planning and Reporting for **Mercedes-Benz Cars** and the Daimler Group. Since April 2016, Goetz has served on the board of directors of Mitsubishi Fuso Truck and Bus Corporation.\n\nAudrey Lee: Director of Arclight (entity that took Proterra public)\n\n* Clean Energy for Biden co-founder. This council has been described as Biden's **bridge to the private green energy sector**, and has undoubtedly been the driving force behind Bides tour of Proterra and continued close cooperation between the company and government contacts.\n\nIn addition to all this, Proterra has also hired two Obama-Biden white house officials to lobby the government on Proterras behalf: Pete Gould who was associate director of government affairs for the Department of Transportation, and Christine Turner who held numerous trade-related positions throughout the administration, including on the White House National Security Council. Their lobby firm is also helmed by Brandon Hurlbut, who was chief of staff at the Department of Energy, a top energy adviser to Obama at the White House, and co-chaired Clean Energy for Biden.\n\nAnd lastly, notable investors in Proterra include the Generation Investment Management, (a fund partly managed by **Al Gore**), Tao Capital Partners (run by the Democratic megadoner, including the current governor of Illinois, Pritzkers clan), and BlackRock (which **current National Economic Council Director Brian Deese** previously worked at and who also just so happened to join Biden for his Proterra factory tour.)\n\nSafe to stay, Proterras leadership and connections are absolutely stacked with heavy hitters in the electric battery implementation sector, trucking and vehicle development industry, and in the highest echelons of our government. I have personally never seen a company so well managed with experienced professionals that is as tightly ensconced with government officials as this one. In fact, these connections make Proterra resemble Lockheed Martin or Boeing more so than just your average bus manufacturer.\n\nAnd when those billions of dollars start being dispersed from the Infrastructure Bill, it will be these connections, connections none of Proterras competitors can boast of, that will make a key difference in levels of funding and access to further opportunities.\n\n**VII. The Plunge:**\n\nDespite all this though, Proterra stock has cratered almost 40% the last month.\n\nWhy? There are four primary reasons for this.\n\nPipe dumping\n\n* Pipe stands for Private Investment in Public Equity, and essentially means that after a company files an S-1, the lockup period ends and these investors are free to sell their shares.\n* Proterra filed its S-1 around July 12th and the share price quickly started sliding downward.\n* While PIPE investors chose to capture a 70% profit in the sixth months, this does not reflect a wider feeling about the future prospects of the company.\n* As of now the PIPE selling is over and the stock just needs something to juice it back up into a positive direction (something like, idk, billions of new funding suddenly becoming available)\n\nSpac name being tarnished\n\n* Proterra went public via a special purpose acquisition company this year, and thus is often associated with other companies that went public through a SPAC\n* SPAC companies like Lordstown have been a fiasco, and Nikola,[ well we all know how that is turning out](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/us-charges-nikola-founder-trevor-milton-with-lying-investors-2021-07-29/).\n* This has really put a damper on any company even remotely associated in this space, and similar to Microvast, Proterra seems to be getting lumped in with more vaporware companies.\n\nToo many ipos\n\n* An incredible amount of companies are going public at the same time, and investors just can\u2019t seem to settle on which ones to invest in. There have been[ over 400 ipos this year alone](https://www.statista.com/statistics/270290/number-of-ipos-in-the-us-since-1999/#:~:text=In%202020%2C%20there%20were%20407,as%20in%20the%20previous%20year.), twice as much as last year, and there's still five more months to go before the year ends.\n* \u201cWhen you see a lot of companies coming public ... then that is a very bad sign for the averages because it means the stock market is getting flooded with new supply,\u201d[ Mad Money](http://www.cnbc.com/mad-money/) host Jim Cramer explains.\n* Supply exceeds demand = low prices and dispersed attention\n* Big advantage of Tesla was that they were the only \u201cshiny object\u201d for EV on the market for a long time, which consolidated all interested in this sector into one single company. [That's no longer the case](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/06/14/tesla-wants-everyone-drive-an-electric-car-now-it-risks-becoming-niche-brand/).\n\nBad Press\n\n* There were a few articles either released or dug up last week that questioned the reliability of Proterras products. I won\u2019t go too far into the specific issues though, as most if not all problems listed were with Proterras 1st generation busses. They are currently on their 5th generation of electric busses.\n* There was a singular issue with the bus chassis showing cracking in Philadelphia, but these issues are superficial and specific to one custom made model on a specific route that [does not affect Proterras overall designs](https://delawarebusinessnow.com/2021/07/dart-not-seeing-the-problems-that-idled-septas-electric-buses/).\n* Additionally, much of this bad press has spawned from conservative media sources, due to the fact that this is such a closely Democrat associated company.\n\nWhile detrimental to the stock in the very short run, these issues are thankfully not due to any inherent weakness of Proterras product or marketing strategy and thus, do not represent an undue threat to its future potential. I fully believe Proterra will rebound soon as it gets more attention and mainstream name recognition.\n\nAs for the specific issues raised by the conservative articles, [here is Proterras response](https://www.proterra.com/americas-transition-to-electric-buses/), as they can give a better rundown on how meritless these articles are then I can.\n\n**VIII. Financials: Significant Numbers**\n\nHere's a link to Proterras[ full financial breakdown](https://www.proterra.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ACTC-Proterra-Investor-Presentation.pdf): I won\u2019t put it all here but here are some highlights.\n\n* Current market cap: $2.22B\n* Current stock price: 10.70\n* 2017-2025 CAGR is 50%\n* 800m cash on hand\n* No debt\n\nProjections:\n\n* 2021E Rev: $246M\n* 2022E Rev: $439M\n* 2023E Rev: $838M\n* 2025E Rev: $2566M\n\nThe biggest thing to note here is that these projections were done before the infrastructure was even beginning to be considered, which means **it is highly unlikely that the insane amount of funds in the current Infrastructure Bill were factored into specifically in the early year projections**. The implementation of the bill will juice these projections to a degree I don\u2019t think anyone can really expect.\n\nI do know for a fact that the partnerships announced in the last few months are not currently priced in, as they constitute more of the 2023-25 revenue. These moves being made recently, such as the partnership with Rouch and Taylor Machine Works  Inc. (**a partnership which by the way Proterra stole from BYD**) this early, will most likely move the projections up a bit.\n\nPart of the reason I won\u2019t go too far into financials is that the passage of the Infrastructure Bill in its current form will **flip Proterras potential on its head.** It's already been steaming full ahead but new funds like this will of course change things.\n\nThe Infrastructure Bill passing and their first quarterly report as a public company on **August 11** is the prime catalyst for what I see as whether the potential for this company is real or not. August 11th will really give us a good look into whether the company is holding up to its projections and how the financials are looking going forward. More news on their battery factory development and announcements on more corporate/government partnerships are all possible, with the forward guidance going to be of critical importance.\n\nNow Citigroup does have a **PT of $16** for them, but as of yet the stock hasn\u2019t gained much attention from Wall Street. I believe this is due to the fact hedge funds are **too busy looking at where the puck is, not where it's going to be**. Very similar to how the Morgan Stanley analyst for some idiotic reason only used Microvasts current factory output stead of including their factories under construction, most hedge funds are **too caught up in Proterras past that they are incapable of seeing where it is going.** The Infrastructure bill will supercharge Proterras bus business while Proterras Powered market strategy and big name partners have the ability to ride the infrastructure wave into unimaginable heights, a position few other companies are in a similar position to do so clearly and obviously.\n\n**IX. Growth and Long Term Strategy**\n\nProterra currently has a battery and transit factory in Industry, California and another transit facility in Greenville, South Carolina. Backlog dating to their initial January 2021 presentation will keep their factories going until early 2022. This does not take into account the multiple contracts and research partnerships they have announced since.\n\nThey currently have capacity to **produce about 680 busses per year** and are aggressively working to hire more technicians and engineers to reach this potential as soon as possible. They\u2019re[ recruiting like crazy](https://recruiting2.ultipro.com/PRO1047PROTI/JobBoard/e33a1c2e-8d7a-4008-851e-f7bd1d7bf788/?q=&amp;o=postedDateDesc&amp;w=&amp;wc=&amp;we=&amp;wpst=), with many positions being graveyard shifts, which reinforces their past statements of moving to a system where they\u2019re pushing out busses 24/7.\n\nThis will allow Proterra to capture even more market share of emerging electric sectors while maintaining their dominance in the electric bus field, of which they already have **50% US market share.**\n\nSpeaking of their busses, **75% of total materials in the busses are sourced from the US**. This is significant as the Biden administration has[ just recently announced a proposal](https://www.detroitnews.com/story/business/autos/2021/07/28/biden-moves-increase-buy-american-requirement-75-2029/5395360001/) to raise the Buy American standard immediately from its current level of 55% to 60%, to 65% by 2024, and to 75% by 2029. The fact that Proterra is already operating at the 2029 level means that this will not affect their financials but will potentially cause disruption in other manufactures, forcing them to revise their financial forecasts.\n\n**How are they trying to Grow?**\n\nProterra, which went public just recently like Microvast, is using their current war chest of about $800 million to grow in three ways: **Research and development, Growth Capex, and Domestic Cell Capacity and co-investment**. R&amp;D on battery tech and creating more efficient systems is easily the most important direction Proterra needs to double down on, so it's good to see them devoting significant resources (200-300m) to further developing their battery designs and energy storage devices. And as I\u2019ve already said, developing a strong, steady, and hopefully fully in-house battery production chain will be key to bringing Proterra to the next level, an objective they seem to already acknowledge and are moving forward to.\n\nFrom this, it's helpful to view Proterra as not an electric bus company that does research to further that goal, but more of a research company that happens to build very good electric busses in order to support more research. **43% of their workforce is apprised of engineers and technicians and it shows**. This research will assist in continuing to streamline their production and build on their already lowering cost, such as how the **cost of batteries has fallen 85% since 2010**. The research has also instigated other developments that make their busses world leading in terms of technology and also in consistently[ breaking records](https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/proterras-electric-bus-breaks-a-world-record-for-range).\n\nProterra is very forward thinking and is consistently looking for new ways to grow and expand. The **TAM of the electric commercial vehicle market is 260 billion** and the **charging market is 37 billion**, and Proterra so far hasn\u2019t even come close to scratching the surface of what they can do. Construction diggers, dumptrucks, airport shuttles, forklifts, flatbeds, bucket trucks, cement mixers, mining transports and so much more are all prime targets for electrification and there just straight up isn't any other companies that are moving as aggressively as Proterra to capture this market. Leveraging their connections, reputation and capital derived from their eclectic transit bus foundation, Proterra can **outmaneuver** and **outcompete** any single competitor in a particular commercial vehicle sector through their holistic end-to-end full cycle product catalogue.\n\nAnd when I say Proterra is forward thinking, I mean really forward thinking. Back in 2017 (when most other bus makers were just beginning to shift to electric or hadn\u2019t even made a prototype yet) Proterra initiated the [world's first autonomous bus program](https://www.masstransitmag.com/alt-mobility/autonomous-vehicles/article/21073560/autonomous-vehicle-technology-preparing-for-the-next-wave-of-innovation-in-public-transit). This tech will eventually allow them to increase safety, lower costs, and make every step of public bus transit more efficient. The fact that they are already actively working on such a revolutionary concept when most other players are still struggling to go all-electric demonstrates that Proterra not only thinks years ahead, but acts as the market leader in ebus technology\n\nAnd besides AI, Proterra also has their eye on another pretty futuristic goal, going so far as to engage in talks with the Pentagon about [\u200b\u200belectrifying military vehicles](https://freebeacon.com/biden-administration/proterra-founder-gets-one-on-one-interview-with-biden-pentagon-official/). Non-frontline vehicles, such as construction trucks, diggers and movers used by the Army's Corps of Engineers for domestic American infrastructure projects don\u2019t run the risk of having to compensate for battlefield conditions and are **prime targets for electrification**. When these vehicles inevitably go electric, the fact that Proterra is already having these conversations with DoD officials puts them in a prime spot to secure future contracts. It also doesn\u2019t hurt that Proterra has already partnered with Komatsu (who not only build construction equipment but has **years of experience building military vehicles**), its co-founder Ryan Popple is **ex-military**, AND that CEO Jack Allen formerly helmed Navistar who just so happens to **make a ton of vehicles for the military**. If any company is going to get military contracts, these guys are right up there able to compete with legacy players like Oshkosh, except Proterra actually has the required electric experience and is ready to hit the ground running.\n\nAnd of course, Proterra is also looking towards the environmental sustainability of its product down the line. This past spring, Proterra partnered with Nevada based Redwood Materials, created by **Tesla co-founder JB Straudel** to recycle its used batteries, [becoming the first publicly announced partnership between Redwood and an automaker](https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/29/recycling-startup-redwood-materials-is-partnering-with-proterra-to-supply-ev-battery-materials-sustainably/?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAJzLFjFV-sVe4ZnZ_436pmkCz6pU7XtluBu607V1mJrh4rnlhtJbbnivUORpzzNYAeTn6vntRnjUdAatXHojjJRjae0WLrU7xigLai7ki40aUFuEGi5Ce2cAm361wdTyI79zueSnH2j6NC8zUd8Jyi5UMkUSfXPpUive2TMSYv5x). This not only further reinforces their Tesla connection, but also again demonstrates how Proterra is looking years down the road to ensure the wild profitability and success of their company.\n\n**X. Conclusion:**\n\nThere is a huge gap in the EV market as well as in how we are strategizing to fight climate change, and Proterra is the only company that can meet both needs simultaneously. While most attention is being paid to the potential of the consumer electric vehicle space, few are considering just how we are going to electrify all those other vehicles that make up our society. You can\u2019t just take a battery built for a sedan and stick it into a bus or a tractor and call it a day. The process takes time, money, failures, and, yes, even more time.\n\nWhile the legacy automakers are each racing to develop their own battery tech and specific innovative technology for consumer cars, Proterra is positioning itself to leverage its almost 2 decades of battery research and powertrain experience to partner with almost every commercial vehicle sector to provide the real world tested technology they need before they even have a thought to develop it themselves. The potential of Proterra is absolutely massive and so far, few have truly realized this.\n\ntldr: Proterra has been able to leverage their position as an early pioneer in the electric transit bus market into partnering with the leading companies in each commercial vehicle sector -Thomas built school busses, Daimler stepvans, etc- to circumvent trying to outcompete legacy players and instead combine their technical, patented breakthrough technology with well established reputations to become the #1 commercial vehicle developer over the next few years. Coinciding with the release of the Infrastructure Bill, they are set to dominate this market and become a behemoth of industry with billions of dollars in revenue in only a few short years.\n\nPositions: August, September, and November 12.5 and 15 calls, as well as 300 PTRAW, and adding more every paycheck I get.

        "selftext": " \n\nI fully expect PLTR to be the next trillion dollar market cap stock. It\u2019s got Peter Thiel (ROTH IRA gang) and Karp at the helm, two really smart and patriotic guys, who know what they\u2019re doing. The IBM partnership was huge in expanding the private sector growth, adding almost 3000 to the sales team. There\u2019s an ever growing log of government contracts meaning they have steady revenue.\n\nPalantir\u2019s retail investors are also a class of their own and Karp recognizes this as noted in one of his recent interviews. This I think is huge in cultivating an investor base that will buy, hold, and believe for years to come. It\u2019s currently my largest holding and I only expect to be that way for the foreseeable 5-10 years. I have no intention of letting a single share go no matter how long boomers keeps it down.\n\nEvery other day there\u2019s news of a new or renewed contract. One day it will be too much to ignore. Wall Street has either been too lazy to understand the company or, if they have done the research, they\u2019re too stupid to act on it. At least Cathie Woods knows what she sees, currently owning over $872M of it...This is going to be her next Tesla call. \n\nConstantly, being bashed by analysts but being scooped up by the same banks? Come on now, once these jamokes are done loading the boat and the upgrades come out its game over. \n\nKarp and Thiel added over $57m in gold and they are pro digital currencies so that's a plus. No debt and \\~2.4B cash on hand. \n\nThey are aiming to be Skynet...make of that what you will. \n\nOn the TA side of things, it's forming higher bases but bases none the less. The longer the base the longer the explosion to the upside. Once this gets hot the lid is coming off and this is gonna blow. \n\n**Partnerships/Customers include the following**:\n\n\\-\tAbbvie\n\n\\-\tAmazon\n\n\\-      Airbus\n\n\\-\tIBM\n\n\\-\tCIA\n\n\\-\tU.S. Navy\n\n\\-\tU.S. Army\n\n\\-\tSEC (Up for Bid)\n\n\\-\tDoD\n\n\\-\tMarines\n\n\\-\tNSA\n\n\\-\tDHS\n\n\\-\tAir Force\n\n\\-\tICE\n\n\\-\tBritish National Health Service\n\n\\-\tMerck\n\n\\-\tFerrari\n\n\\-\tCDC\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Recent Earnings Highlights**\n\n* Total revenue grew 49% year-over-year to $376 million\n* US commercial revenue grew 90% year-over-year\n* Closed 62 deals of $1 million or more, of which:\n   * 30 deals are $5 million or more\n   * 21 deals are $10 million or more\n* 20 net new customers added in Q2 2021, total customers up 13% quarter-over-quarter\n* Commercial customer count increased 32% quarter-over-quarter\n\n**H1 2021 Highlights**\n\n* Total revenue grew 49% year-over-year to $717 million\n* Commercial customer count increased 61% since December 31, 2020\n* Cash flow from operations of $140 million, representing a 19% margin\n* Adjusted free cash flow of $201 million, representing a 28% margin\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: I'm stoned so was probably all over the place but Palantir is gonna be the next early Amazon or Apple or Tesla or Microsoft. Endless government contracts and partnerships and an ever growing private contracts list and clients as well. Two patriotic fellas leading the way. \n\nPLTR and Papa Karp to the \ud83c\udf19\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*This is not financial advice it is just my own opinion as a Palantard\\*",

So if we expect some kind of vaccine booster do you think that will skyrocket the stocks or crash the market? or is it priced in?\n\nreasons for skyrocket:\n\nit means that the vaccines still work for the most part and this is the way, instead of shutdowns and job losses and too much social distancing, the vaccine will be free and all we have to do is we export less, but still have enough production.\n\nreasons for crash:\n\nit means that they think the pandemic will go on longer than expected, and much of 3rd world countries still not close to vaccinated, they will have to delay some shipments to those countries. also it can make some people refuse to take the boosters.\n\nreasons it will be priced in:\n\nthis is because i think it depends on how urgent they think it is. if they expand approval for 12 yr old and under first i think its just priced in because we know its going to be around that time anyway. also i think most people dont care so thats why it's priced in.",

        "selftext": "\u201cThat juggernaut needs to be investigated more by me\u201d - Jim Cramer\n\nToday on Mad Money, a caller phoned in asking Cramer what his thoughts were on the vertically integrated battery manufacturing juggernaut Microvast. Shockingly, he had never heard of them or didn\u2019t know enough about them to form an opinion. So, he left the question unanswered. Now, Cramer LOVES fellow EV battery competitor QuantumScape. In fact he\u2019s even had their CEO on his show several times! So just for you Cramer, and anyone else unfamiliar with the company, here's a little comparison of the two companies:\n\nMicrovast is a leading global provider of next-generation battery technologies for commercial and specialty electric vehicles. They supply fast charging power systems capable of 0-100% charge in 10-30 minutes, with the highest margin of safety in the industry (have never had a battery fire). \n\nMarket Cap:\nMicrovast: $2.6 billion ($800 million being cash)\nQuantumScape: $9.1 billion\n\nMicrovast is currently trading at a 4 times discount to QuantumScape, despite already having actual clients, revenue, and production. I\u2019m not arguing QS should be worth less. I\u2019m just saying if MVST is an already established company, and the market likes QS at 10 billion, shouldn't it love MVST at 2.5 billion?\n\nRevenue:\nMicrovast: \n2021 - $230 million \n2022 - $448 million\n2023 - $751 million\n2024 - $1,080 million\n2025 - $1,500 million\nQuantumScape: \n2021-2024 \u2026. No revenue\n2024 - $14 million..?\n2026 - $275 million!\n\nBy the time QS makes $275 million, Microvast will be making billions of dollars yearly. Again I'm not saying this makes QS overvalued, I\u2019m just arguing this makes Microvast SEVERELY undervalued.\n\nProduction Facilities:\nMicrovast: \nChina - Factory located in Huzhou (operational)\nGermany - Factory located in Berlin (operational)\nUnited States - Factory in Clarksville, Tennessee (being built not yet in production)\nR&amp;D plant in Orlando Florida (I'll get more into this later as this is where things get interesting)\nQuantumScape: \nUnited States - Plant in San Jose, California \n\nAs you can see Microvast is an established multinational corporation with production all over the globe. Coincidentally, the two largest automotive manufacturing countries in the world are China and the United States, Germany being the 4th. All countries Microvast operates out of. \n\nSolid State\nThis is where I think it gets interesting for Microvast. Everyone already knows that QuantumScape is supposed to change the world with their solid state battery technology that should hopefully be developed by 2024. But QS aren't the only ones working towards this new technology. That brand new research and development plant, opening in Orlando, Florida, I mentioned earlier is being made to develop solid state for Microvast as well. That's right, QS isn\u2019t the only company developing solid state.  An already established battery juggernaut going at it against a Silicon Valley startup for a revolutionary technology where the winner will take a large amount of the market. Microvast, who is staffed with Nobel prize winning chemists could be a real dark horse if they develop it first. \n\nUSPS NGDV\nOne of Microvast\u2019s largest customers to date is undoubtedly Oshkosh. Maybe you\u2019ve heard of them if you were a Workhorse investor, because these are the guys who won the bid for the USPS Next Generation Delivery Vehicle contract. They're also one of Microvast\u2019s PIPE investors, and Microvast is their electric vehicle battery supplier. Now this may be a bit speculative, but does it not make sense that Oshkosh would have their EV battery supplier supply the batteries for this new multi billion dollar EV contract? Could this be the reason the US Department of Energy requested Microvast to build a factory in Clarksville, Tennessee to meet the demand of such a large contract? If Microvast is the battery supplier for this contract, say hello to additional billions in contracted revenue. \n \n\nFull disclosure, I'm heavily invested in Microvast shares and have been adding 10 dollar calls every week for the last 3 weeks. I plan to hold this stock for the next 3-5 years as the world is on the brink of an EV industrial revolution and MVST has positioned itself as the pick and shovel to this goldrush. \n\nTLDR: Microvast should be worth more than Quantumscape and QS is currently worth 4 times Microvast",

Extremely strong support at \\~$8. Volume has been fading hard (usually implies sellers and bagholders) - 50m 90day avg. and 15m 10day avg. Yet despite this, support has kept it even thru the red days above $8. Today, the trading volume is sitting at just under 6m with less than 2 hours left on the trading week. It's actually rising as I write this lmao.\n\nBut more than technical, my research into big dog rival in $CI - Cigna Corporation's earnings after talking to that dude in my history makes me very bullish for $CLOV next week. [They just posted earnings and beat with raised guidance, though with elevated costs.](https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/payer/cigna-beats-street-1-5b-profit-for-q2)\n\n\\- Clover is well poised for earnings. Since the beatdowns of the recent past not exclusive to - Hindenburg report, Chamath snake oil salesman, market pullbacks, delta concerns, past earnings userbase growth miss etc., markets been pricing CLOV like complete dogshit. So why am I bullish?\n\n\\- Cigna Corporation, the rival big-boy boomer health insurance company, just had a positive earnings with huge growth in revenue but projected more claims costs which hit profit margins along with a slowdown of userbase growth. Why is that, in a time where the CEO says health services / biotech are booming? It's simple, boomers be losing market share to growth. \\*Bah gawd that's CLOV's MUSIC\\*\n\n\\- CLOV is constantly working to automate and expand their tech. [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/clover-health-launches-florida-partnership-130000166.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/clover-health-launches-florida-partnership-130000166.html) boomers won't be keeping up with this company aimed at growth with millions of new subscribers.\n\n\\- CLOV CEO went and explained his case to dissolve some of the claims against the business from Hindenburg report / lawsuits a few weeks ago, caused a stock spike [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/clover-health-ceo-speaks-out-for-first-time-on-hospital-controversies-142320948.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/clover-health-ceo-speaks-out-for-first-time-on-hospital-controversies-142320948.html)\n\n\\- CLOV earnings are priced in to miss again, which I am not sure if that's accurate. Over the last few months of recovery and people going out, more people are going on Medicare and/or health insurance plans, including travel and all. The number of people in need of health services certainly didn't DECREASE thru COVID. America don't give a damn about COVID anymore, that's $ for business.\n\n\\- And yet, it makes me more bullish that Cigna, the household name for such health services, blamed COVID for the potential upcoming cost deficits as well as lowering guidance of user growth. I am sure they don't want to mention losing market share to competitors, a la Clover Health among others.\n\n\\- IV for CLOV is at/below 100 for the first time in a long ass time. Options are cheap and there's a lot of room for the upside.\n\n\\-  I'm expecting CLOV to beat/meet EPS estimates, but CRUSH Revenue as they continue their M&amp;A and R&amp;D expenses. Again, CLOV is growth. But even with the last Q, it's pretty clear they are growing despite missing initial subscriber growth estimates. They won't miss new targets. They are growing.\n\n\\- Cigna dipped 10% pre-market and since has begun to rally up, sitting at 2.5% gain today after an overall [Earnings Beat and Raised Guidance](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/cigna-ci-q2-earnings-and-revenues-surpass-estimates-2021-08-05). Their guidance dropped not simply due to COVID, but competitors such as CLOV coming in to fight on the big stage, and I'm here to catch that ride.\n\n\\- I did not check short interest as I normally don't care but I assume this stock is forever shorted and with IV near all-time lows, gamma is cheap enough to pressure some degree of squeeze I imagine. Vanna is also cheap, considering IV usually rises before earnings. Likely it will all rise next week.\n\nTL;DR - CLOV looks cheap at 8 dollars and will likely have bullish guidance and growth with its' earnings report on August 11 due to factors listed above.\n\nI am not a financial advisor, I don't hold a position.

        "selftext": "I think after the last earnings call there is a lot of incorrect information or straight out distortion of facts being put out by people and analysts alike here and would like to set the record straight with what I believe the facts are.\n\n**Production:**\n\nThe company in their earnings call said they are on track to start production at the end of Sep 2021. If you actually listened to what they said, they said this is for test-builds that they hope to validate in Q4 and to deliver a few to some special early customers in Q1' 2022. They further said or implied that they expect regular commercial deliveries to start in Q2' 2022. Previously, they said on the Q1' 2021 call they had enough cash to ramp production to produce and deliver 1,000 vehicles this year. Now delivery (ignoring their special test-builds delivered to early customers) is pushed back to Q2' 2022. Maybe the word PRODUCTION is being misused to imply something other than what they are doing. I would suggest the correct term for what they are doing now is PRE-PRODUCTION. In any case this is semantics as revenue requires deliveries, not production.\n\n**Equity Line of Credit (ELOC):**\n\nThere have been claims that there is a \"Line of Credit\" providing up to $400M in financing in place. In fact this is a complete misrepresentation. Below is the link to an SEC filing describing the agreement between RIDE and YA. Here are some key points and how the $400M is computed and why it does not mean anything.\n\nOn 7/23/2021 they entered into the agreement with YA to purchase up to $400M of their Class A Common Stock over a 36 month period at RIDE's discretion (that should be a red flag there. As why would YA agree to this... well all will be explained). Per that filing, \" The net proceeds that we may receive under the Purchase Agreement cannot be determined at this time...\", which means that while RIDE can potentially receive up to $400M, they might receive far less but can't predict that amount, as it depends on the stock price.\n\nThe agreement says that RIDE can only sell YA, up to 35,144,690 in shares, UNLESS, (1) they obtain shareholder approval to sell more or (2) the average price they sell the shares to YA at is over $7.48 per share. The price of the shares is 3% less than the \"simple average of the daily VWAP's for the three trading days following notice to YA\" There are also daily limits on how many shares RIDE can sell to YA at any time.\n\nSo assuming 35M shares, at a current share price of about $5.8 that is about $204M before the 3% discount to market price that RIDE nets. For RIDE to net 400M, with selling 35M shares they need a share price of $11.4. Alternatively they need shareholders to approve selling much more than 35M shares (so just more dilution) or they need the average price to be over $7.48, which will allow them to increase the shares they sell, so also more dilution.\n\nIn sum, at current market prices they net about $200M under this \"Equity Line of Credit\" or share offering. However, as selling shares will likely depress the price, they should net far less.\n\n[https://sec.report/Document/0001558370-21-009222/](https://sec.report/Document/0001558370-21-009222/)\n\n**Further Dilution:**\n\nPer the SEC filing below, it says that Mr. Burns can sell 50% of his shares by 10/23/2021. Steve Burns owns 46.4 million shares, so assuming he sells when his shares are unlocked he can sell 23.2M shares end of Oct 2021. While in theory not \"dilutive\" the end of lock-ups tend to have a similar impact by flooding the market with more shares than demand for them.\n\n[https://sec.report/Document/0001104659-21-090313/#tSTTR](https://sec.report/Document/0001104659-21-090313/#tSTTR)\n\n**Cash Position:**\n\nPer their Q2 earnings call and reports they have about 366M in cash on hand at 6/30/2021. In their earnings report they suggested about 200M in operating expenses for the rest of 2021 and about 215M in CAPEX. While they suggested they can time some of the payments in Q3, this comes to about 415M in cash needed to get through the year. That is about 50M cash short.\n\nGoing back to their ELOC, at current share price they can raise about 200M, so assuming they raise the funds without dropping the share price that leaves them  with 150M at year end. It is reasonable to assume that their quarterly cash needs will only increase as they attempt to get to production (this has been the case so far for them and has been the case by every other auto maker as far as I can tell) means that for Q1' 2022 they will need over 200M.  The conclusion is obvious, that on top of the current share offering, if the share price does not go up, they must issue more shares. Further, they project regular commercial deliveries in Q2' 2022 so the money they need will not be insignificant.\n\n**Other Sources of Funds:**\n\nThe Company suggested that they are getting a valuation on their plant and equipment in order to possibly borrow funds against that. They suggested that the value is much more than the book value of about $300M. The fact is, a lot of their equipment will be installed and modified to their specs and will not be suitable without additional cost to another manufacturer. This means that fire sale value, or what someone might actually lend against it, will likely be far less than the book value. Perhaps to Lordstown, the value is higher, but to a third party that is a very doubtful assumption. As to the factory itself, it was an old plant that GM shut down. This is not something people are looking to buy. For EV's, you see with Tesla, Lucid, and others they are looking or building new factories with layouts designed for EV's and not ICE vehicles. I would again doubt the factory has much value for a lender. Hard to know what they can borrow using their plant and equipment as collateral, but it clearly will not be much.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nGiven the dilution and share unlocks coming and their downward pressure on share price, as it stands now the company will have difficult raising sufficient funds to get to production. For the company to be viable, it must have its share price go up first to enable them to raise funds favorably. As evidenced by today's price action, this company is not attracting substantial shareholder inflows, so it remains unclear how the share price increases first to enable them to raise sufficient funds. So based on the current share price, I don't understand how this company, even if they do everything right going forward, can succeed.\n\n**Some Other Thoughts:**\n\nNone of the above analysis is dependent on whether the in-wheel tech works or not or is a good candidate for a commercially viable electric truck. I have for several months expressed substantial doubts about the tech and RIDE's ability to execute and have no reason to assume otherwise. In any case, even if it could work, structurally RIDE is not in a position anymore to commercialize it.\n\nI actually also have an issue with Price Targets analysts are setting here. Either you have to have a high price target or a near-zero one. An in-between target makes no sense as current share price means they are headed to insolvency before they can produce anything. This company is either a $10+ investment or a &lt;$1 investment, there is no in-between.\n\n**TL,DR price-target &lt;$1 and bankruptcy in Q4' 2021 or Q1' 2022 (if they are lucky they push it off till Q2' 2022).**\n\nPositions: a bunch of $5 Puts for Jan 2022 that are currently up about 20%.",

The founders pioneered blockbuster anti-inflammatory drugs Remicade and Humira. Primary Active ingredient for Dupuytren\u2019s Contracture is same drug already approved for another indication\u2014 Rheumatoid Arthritis the single largest market in pharmaceuticals. Read that last sentence again the founders discovered the biology behind anti TNF and are world famous academics including a winner of The Lasker Prize. Because the research was done on this P2B/ P3 on diseased human Dupuytren\u2019s tissue the move straight to FDA drug submission upon proof of concept. Other indications being targeted in future in order are Frozen shoulder, POST Operative Cognitive Decline, NonAlcoholic Steatohepatitis (Fatty Liver Disease) and Ulcerative Colitis brought on by smoking cessation. Another pathway being targeted is pain and inflammation using SCA\u2019s\u2014 synthetic cannabinol diet analogues. You see a founder is the Israeli scientist who first isolated THC and discovered the human endocannabinoid system. Known as godfather of cannabis. Some of you apes might be familiar with the stuff. But it\u2019s synthetic and pure now think about pairing pain relief for musculoskeletal pain with the anti TNF meds proven effective on rheumatoid arthritis and consider that market. Get the picture. Now the CEO has a history of allowing data on patented medication to be released in academic setting. By the way current patents are worth more than stock price. So the catalyst of a keynote address at Oxford to the royal society of hand surgeons is the very stage for release if data. Oxford is also home to founder Sir Ralph Winner of Lasker prize. So do you think Anyone at FDA is denying a NDA for a medication already wildly successful for new indications for which there are no treatments. I don\u2019t think so. It\u2019s like telling Einstein E=MC squared is wrong. There is no one at FDA who can challenge the science.    \n\nScientific team and founders are pioneers with proven track record in drug discovery from the University of Oxford, Hebrew University and Stanford University.  \n\n\n[Stellar team](https://preview.redd.it/tkxat6k8orf71.png?width=605&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4e64fa6971fb479a1c40586d64641f6785d544ba)\n\n[Blockbuster pipeline](https://preview.redd.it/q45rtttborf71.png?width=605&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=91c083c5f49998cc05c39ba6e2f7bd8a0ed683c6)\n\n[Market size](https://preview.redd.it/lmwoodckorf71.png?width=605&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e1cc8309f230736336ac94854e7dfde912177cff)\n\n[  ](https://preview.redd.it/wpv4clsmorf71.png?width=604&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=319ad878d0957acdbb61e30e4c8d40370e7c3448)\n\n**Fibrosis and Anti-TNF**  \nThe fibrosis and anti-TNF program is based at the Kennedy Institute, at the University of Oxford in the UK.   \nThe team is led by Professor Jagdeep Nanchahal, a surgeon-scientist who has been running the phase 2b/3 trials, and Professor Sir Marc Feldmann, a renowned immunologist and one of the pioneers of anti-TNF therapy.

By developing SCAs, 180 Life Sciences will create a pure compound (&gt;99.5%) which offers accurate consistency across batches.

        "selftext": "Hey y\u2019all I\u2019m looking for some inspiration. I\u2019m at the verge of giving up after loosing 150k of my own money this year. Let\u2019s not get into the specific of how it happened, for now. It can be summed up by that I am an emotional trader. \n\nI don\u2019t want to give up. I want to be disciplined. I want to figure this out. \n\nMoney is relative. This represents a sizable chunk of money to me but not catastrophic. It would take me about 3 years of being a smart saver to save up 150k again. That\u2019s a significant setback. \n\nAnyway has anyone been on the brink of quitting but hung in there?\n\nIt\u2019s been the typical steps up and massive elevators down for me. I would say the vast majority of my losses happened on crazy days where I just could not control what was happening. \n\nRisk management, sizing and being able to take a small loss is the most challenging area for me. \n\nWell anyway I don\u2019t have much more to loose. Not much liquid assets left. \n\nI really really don\u2019t want to give up. Anyone been in even remotely similar situation and was able to rise from the ashes?",

        "selftext": "First of all, I am a massive fan of nuclear and believe it should have been a key part of the worlds energy mix much sooner.\n\nRelevant positions: 50% of my portfolio is ICLN, 12% of my portfolio is RR who manufacture small modular nuclear reactors.\n\n**Nuclear is the stepping stone to net zero:**\n\nI see a lot of comments on here and articles which state we must use nuclear to complement renewables as their usage/production increases to ensure a net-zero power mix while renewable use grows. Nuclear is also heralded as a solution to the issue a lot of renewables (solar and wind) have with providing a constant baseline of energy. However, this could also be solved by battery technology or hydrogen power not just nuclear. \n\nFor example:\n\n\\- [Ambitious EU emissions target needs nuclear](https://www.world-nuclear-news.org/Articles/Ambitious-EU-emissions-target-needs-nuclear-says) \\- September 2020 - World Nuclear News (Bias)\n\n\\- [Stepping stones: the slippery path to a clean energy future](https://theconversation.com/stepping-stones-the-slippery-path-to-a-clean-energy-future-3375) \\- September 2011 - Australian calls to replace coal.\n\n\\-[A UK Nuclear solution for Net Zero](https://innovateuk.blog.gov.uk/2020/11/24/a-uk-nuclear-solution-for-net-zero/) \\- November 2020 - GOV.UK \n\nSo as you can see there have been and still are calls for nuclear to supplement our path to net zero.\n\n**The Issue with Nuclear:**\n\n[The UN states we need to halve our global emissions by 2030 and achieve net zero by 2050](https://www.un.org/press/en/2020/sgsm20411.doc.htm). \n\nFrom now that leaves us with around 29 years achieve global net zero issues. Which to me doesn't seem long enough to implement nuclear with the current process of building nuclear plants.\n\nFor example:\n\n\\- In 2010 the UK announced 8 new nuclear plants to be built. In October 2020 Hinkley Point C is the only one of the eight sites to have begun construction with total cost of \u00a322bn. [Hinkley Point C is due to open in mid-2026](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hinkley_Point_C_nuclear_power_station). \n\n\\- The [site for Belarusian Astravets Nuclear Site was chosen in December 2008](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astravets_Nuclear_Power_Plant), construction began in June 2012 and it was opened in June 2021.\n\n\\- Finnish Olkiluoto 3 [began construction in 2005](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olkiluoto_Nuclear_Power_Plant#Unit_3), expected to begin operations in 2010. Currently still under construction after [facing another delay TODAY](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/finlands-olkiluoto-3-nuclear-reactor-faces-another-delay-2021-08-23/).\n\nSo for Hinkley Point C it will have taken 16 years to construct site from once it was announced as a site. Astravets took 13 years. Olkiluoto 3 is still being built after 16 years. There are many more examples of these lengthy construction and development times which are often increased due to lack of public support for projects and heavy government red tape surrounding nuclear power. \n\nIf we start constructing nuclear power plants TODAY it will take 5 years to be allowed to choose a site and another 10 to build the plant! Bringing us up to the year 2036 - and that's if we start choosing nuclear today.\n\nSome countries I believe will do this for example the UK government is very pro-nuclear. However, we still have major companies such as Germany and Italy. Germany shutting all nuclear plants by 2022 with no plans for more and replacing them with coal, Italy phased out all nuclear power in 2018 with no plans for more.\n\n**Summary:**\n\nSo how will nuclear support us reaching net zero emissions when plants seem to take 15 years to plan and build and we have major economies ignoring nuclear? \n\n**A Solution? Small Modular Reactors:**\n\nSmall Modular Reactors are currently being developed by a number of companies such as Rolls Royce in the UK, Chinese ACP-100, US/Japanese Hitachi-GE BWRX-300 for some names.\n\nAdvantages ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small\\_modular\\_reactor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_modular_reactor#Waste)):\n\n\\- Much smaller - Rolls Royce's SMR takes up 40,000m2 which is 10% of that needed for a traditional plant. I think this could sway public opinion as well as current nuclear plants are huge eye-sores.\n\n\\- Licensing - Once the first unit is designed and approved, licensing subsequent units should be much simpler as all units operate the same. This will reduce roll-out times drastically.\n\n\\- Scalability - One site can begin with one module, however modular design will allow more SMRs to be added to any individual site to increase capacity.\n\n\\- Reduced waste - Most SMRs are fast reactors with higher fuel burn up reducing the amount of waste.\n\n\\- Economies of scale/manufacturing - SMRs aim to be standardised to allow for mass production due to their smaller size. This will allow for mass-rollouts and cheaper costs. \n\nObviously, most of these projects are also in design stages and will require approval and then constructions which I don't believe will be quick. However, I do believe in the ability of these SMRs to be rolled out relatively quickly once approved. \n\n**Further Reading and Sources:**\n\n\\- [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small\\_modular\\_reactor#Waste](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_modular_reactor#Waste)\n\n\\- [https://www.rolls-royce.com/innovation/small-modular-reactors.aspx#/](https://www.rolls-royce.com/innovation/small-modular-reactors.aspx#/)\n\n\\- [https://www.energy.gov/ne/articles/3-reasons-why-nuclear-clean-and-sustainable](https://www.energy.gov/ne/articles/3-reasons-why-nuclear-clean-and-sustainable)\n\n\\- [https://e360.yale.edu/features/why-nuclear-power-must-be-part-of-the-energy-solution-environmentalists-climate](https://e360.yale.edu/features/why-nuclear-power-must-be-part-of-the-energy-solution-environmentalists-climate)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat are your thoughts on nuclear?",

        "selftext": "Time for some hot bear smut, but this isn\u2019t your usual flavor of doom and gloom. Also, I\u2019ll try to not sound like \u201cDavid\u201d in the following.\n\nYou. You are an individual. As an individual, you are a basic economic unit. As a basic economic unit, you are responsible for contributing economic activity, managing your personal resources, and maximizing utility. Utility means two things in being a productive member of society AND by being content with your lifestyle. This has been studied for generations and is taught as personal finance or even home economics.\n\nAs an individual or a family, it is in your best interest to ensure you have adequate liquidity. This liquidity will allow you to meet your short term financial obligations and even your long term financial obligations. Most people talk about an emergency find which should be 6 months to 1 year of your complete living expenses. For most adults in the U.S. this figure is a minimum of $30,000 per individual in cash, either physical or in a checking account that can be quickly accessed. Most of you probably do not have these resources available. If you do not, then you should immediately stop gambling and save every red cent.\n\nAt the time of this writing, the total value of the US stock market was approximately 100 Trillion USD...maybe more. However, the total circulating supply of USD in the world was approximately 20.4 Trillion USD. That means that 80% of the total stock market value is illusory and nonexistent. This is why during 2008 and 2020 there was such a run on financial markets. Everyone was cashing in to get raw cash! The problem then, and the problem now, is that there isn\u2019t enough money to go around. When the next market meltdown happens, it will be far more pronounced as everyone tries to convert their funny money assets into real money. This is one of the reasons why there is such a growing disparity between the rich and the poor. The poor give their money to the rich and then wonder why they are poor. \n\nAnyway, everyone knows that stock prices are super overvalued, bond prices are super overvalued, real estate is super overvalued. The only thing that is not yet overvalued, is USD.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a5bx2k3qr4j71.png?width=1154&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dad697253b5a9eba7a28172cc27600faf853dbcd\n\nIf you are less than 30 years old, you do not get to have an opinion on inflation or the value of the USD. You simply have not lived enough to know what the fuck you\u2019re talking about. Period. All of the \u201cprecious\u201d metal bugs are getting their shit pushed in by JPow\u2019s green dildo. There is inflation, but it\u2019s in every asset class from bond prices, stonk prices, and real estate prices\u2026not in cash. Cash is the only thing with intrinsic value because that is what we all use as a medium of exchange. It\u2019s also what each and every one of us care about at the end of the day. Period. Every other asset is only made up of extrinsic value nowadays which is why meme stocks have been in the the driver seat. Finally, the only way the USD will stop being of any value is if the United States collapses. If that happens, you will have bigger personal issues to deal with than literally ALL of your assets going to 0. Moving on.\n\nBoomers hold most of the wealth in the United States. They also have most of their wealth tied up in the stock market and real estate market. Most boomers will be retiring en masse and as they do retire, they will be converting their mutual funds and stocks into cold hard cash. This will have a ripple effect that will make equity prices go down. While you\u2019re stuffing real money into the slot machines of the stock market casino, boomers are gleefully taking that money from you and putting it in their pockets. The boomers didn\u2019t take your money\u2026you gave it to them. Further, as they begin retiring, and they have already begun, they will keep taking your money as they sell their shares to you.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/prx326k6r4j71.png?width=1157&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b44b947e2be2b306a0b81f19852d510af95dc80e\n\nAlso, look at the velocity of money. The velocity of money has been in decline since the GFC and has dropped from 10.6 in 2008 all the way down to 1.18 in 2021. Shit is going to get crazy as the real economy is still fucked and there will be a reckoning soon. Soon means anywhere from a few weeks to a few years. Nobody has a crystal ball but anyone that looks around can see it. Make no mistake, it IS coming. Make sure you are properly positioned so you don\u2019t get fucking rekt when it does. You recently saw how the market sold off over 1% last week at just the hint of the Fed talking about thinking about tapering asset purchases. That doesn\u2019t even address the fed funds rate. Interest rates will have to go up soon. When they do, even by .25%, it will make EVERYTHING lose value. Burry was right when he called this the greatest speculative bubble of all time and that the market is dancing on a knife\u2019s edge. Do not let yourself get fucked by the idiocy of those in power.\n\nIDGAF what you think about this, because at the end of the day, YOU and YOU ALONE have to live with yourself and your personal circumstances. It\u2019s no skin off my ass if I see you on a street corner begging for change. I\u2019ve already met some of you who\u2019ve YOLO\u2019d it all right into homelessness. I warned you. If this saves one idiot from gambling their live savings away on this negative sum game, then that is enough for me.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cenmhgatt4j71.png?width=1081&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=66a1ab0ead88b290b06c5a9409084701a6a17b06\n\nTakeaways: sell all your shit now and convert it all into USD. Hold it in money market funds or your checking account. As long as you have quick access to it for use in your personal life. If you have dependents, then get the fuck off of WSB and get your family financially prepared. I\u2019ve seen too many deadbeat dads on here who have financially ruined their families. Don\u2019t be that guy. If you\u2019re single, then make sure you don\u2019t have to move back in with mom n\u2019 dad. Take care of your shit.\n\nAlso, make sure your career is stable and unfuck yourself if you\u2019re on a PIP or something. Find a new job because right now wages and salaries are higher and it\u2019s a bull market for job seekers. Start a business or a side hustle, with bonus points if it targets boomers and their wealth.\n\nPositions: 90% USD and 10% in brokerage account to gamble on OTM options. Most I can ever lose is 10% of my wealth. \n\nTLDR: Cash out your retirement, cash out your stonks, bonds, and everything. DUMP IT before Boomers do it first. Cash is still king and you will need the liquidity to personally weather the storm during the coming crisis. Only gamble 10% of your total net worth in risky stonks or options at any given time. DO NOT YOLO. Gambling on the stock market is fine as long as you\u2019re using money that you can literally afford to lose. e.g. no more than 10% of your net worth at any given point\\*.\n\n\\*Don\u2019t use the 10% rule as an excuse to chop yourself up into bits before ending up broke. This means if you\u2019re only worth $10,000 then the most you can gamble is $1,000. If you lose it, then you\u2019re done until you save another $1,000 to then gamble. It does not mean lose $1,000, then take 10% of $9,000. Again, this is all on you. If you fuck yourself then you have to live with it, not me.",

        "selftext": "Cliffs dropped 8% yesterday on a sharp decline in iron ore prices. Funny part is that steelmaking is almost their entire source of revenue (**Steelmaking:** 1.4B **Other:** 8m).

Their **steelmaking capacity is 23 million tons\u2014meaning they need to purchase the rest of the iron ore elsewhere to make all of their revenues.** (steel to iron ore ratio 1:1.6 tons)\n\nTheir revenues are focused on construction and the automotive sector INCLUDING retooling facilities\u2014which every company will need to do to produce EVs.

        "selftext": "Today Jim Cramer said that rates are so low he took out a mortgage in preparation to perhaps buy another property because \"buying real estate today is better than buying any stock.\" (Sorry no link it's behind a paid gate).\n\nThis sentiment implies strong confidence that real estate market will not crash in the near to mid term future. I know this sub hates Cramer, but when a guy who pushes stocks all the time tells you Real Estate is better, there might be something there.\n\nHowever on the other hand, real estate is at an all time high right now. It just feels weird to buy when everything is so freaking expensive. What do you guys think?",

        "selftext": "By all metrics Corsair is absurdly cheap and yes I know about EagleTree like everyone here. I also know that EagleTree can only sell around 5 million more shares which is how many they\u2019ve been doing every batch roughly, if they want to retain a majority position. \n\nP/E is now well below 17, which for this industry and how the stock market currently is\u2026 is ridiculous.\n\nAs of today 20.61% of the float is shorted and it\u2019s been continually trending up. Up 29% from last month. Given this tends to be a low volume stock and that it\u2019s a smaller company in terms of market cap, this could end up being a pretty solid short squeeze candidate if shorts continue to build. \n\nAt the end of the day Corsair is definitely a solid long term buy, especially at these price levels but it could end up being a very good short term purchase as well if some momentum is generated behind it.\n\nFull disclosure: \nI\u2019ve owned Corsair shares for a long time and made money by purchasing shares on the dips months ago but I still hold a large position of 3500 shares at about 32.5 average.",
