        "selftext": "At one point, my \"high yield\" savings account was netting me 2% a year. But when the Fed started cutting rates in 2019, I got annoyed with the declining rates and decided it was time to learn about stock investing. \n\nI slowly bought starting last November and put in most of my money between March and June when the market was tanking. Through a simple strategy of picking blue-chip stocks, indexed ETFs, portfolio diversification, (and staying off Wall Street Bets), I am up 15% in one year, netting about $11,000 in profits when I would have gotten a fraction of that. Part of it was fortunate timing no doubt. \n\nMy big winners have been NVDA 83% up, AMZN 79%, CMG 74% and BABA 63% and the low-cost ETFs I use to further diversify are QQQ, VOT, MGK, VGLT, VTWO and VWO. I learned hard lessons on BA 56%, PCG46% and INTC 27%. \n\nThe biggest advice is would give to new investors is don't get greedy by chasing huge overnight gains with YOLO bets using options and leverage. Find well-run companies that you can hold long-term, make sure you don't overweight into certain sectors (I am guilty of this with amount of tech I hold), and you should be able to earn yourself steady returns. If you're afraid of jumping in because you think the market is at an all-time high, buy-in using DCA. \n\nI plan to hold my positions for the next five years and continue to slowly put more in. I wouldn't have gone down this path if the Fed hadn't forced my hand.",

        "selftext": "# Stonk Picks For The Week\n\nI posted last Sunday in [r/Options](https://www.reddit.com/r/Options/) my [plays for the week](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/jqlhvn/i_draw_with_crayons_so_you_dont_have_to_made_4k/) and updated the thread Monday morning when I entered the position. Last week I netted about $1,500 on $80,000 or roughly 2%. Not bad considering most stonks ended lower for the week and a few of my positions were looking at risk of being assigned. [The week prior](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jmbuff/i_draw_with_crayons_so_you_dont_have_to_this/) I netted $4k on $75,000 or 5% return.\n\nPlease refrain from any comments such as \"only 1% per week dude you suck\". 1% per week will double your account in about 80 week. So yes that's all I aim for.\n\n**What am I doing?**\n\nI do technical analysis and selling cash-secured-puts 1 to 3 weeks out on stocks that are nearing key levels of support. My goal is to collect premium, but should I get assigned I have absolutely zero problem running the wheel on stocks I want to own. As a backstory I nearly blew up my account doing WSB-style plays in March but have regained all of my account and then some running this strategy since April. What I do now is basically wheeling on weekly puts.\n\nI watch over 200 stocks, I would say its 90% waiting game and 10% true technical analysis. My levels work, but it's normally because I am patiently waiting for an entry point. Yes that's a lot of tickers to watch, but I research my stocks on weekends and then monitor additional plays &amp; levels during the weekday to see if there is an obvious setup I want to participate in.\n\n**Here's a few things regarding my strategy**\n\n**1.** I don't do spreads because if the stock price blows past your long strike and you assume max loss you need a lot of capital to actually be assigned the shares. For that reason I don't really see spreads as a \"Theta Gang\" play and is still very high risk.\n\n**2.** I only sell cash-secured puts with the capability to be assigned if need be. My goal is to never take a loss on a position and always wheel it back to profitability. If something has changed fundamentally with the stock then yes I will close the position and realize the loss.\n\n**3.** If IV on a ticker is very low, then yes I will outright buy shares instead.\n\n**4.** I only aim for 1-4% per week collecting on theta and an occasional earnings theta yolo. No call-buying, no spreads, only put-selling!\n\nHonestly, that's about it. I'll go through some tickers on my watchlist this weekend and what I currently have open.\n\n# Open Positions From Last Week\n\n**BABA**: 1x CSP $260 strike 20 Nov expiration, 1x CSP $245 strike Nov 20 expiration.\n\nI opened the $260 strike put last week when the stock dipped, then opened the $245 strike put on Friday after the stock dipped for a second time. The $260 was down about 25% when I opened the $245 and I saw it as free money to get me back to at very minimum break-even on this particular ticker by this upcoming Friday the 20th. These 2 CSPs are taking up a fuckload of my buying power, so I will need to close them if I want to open up additional positions because I don't like being over-leveraged. If BABA gets a pop on Monday, I'll close out one or both and free up some capital if I want to enter new positions.\n\n# Chart Rules\n\n**Pink Lines** = Trading range &amp; channel. I find stocks typically trade within certain channels until an event, such as earnings or some news which changes the fundamentals of the stock price changes the trend and a new channel is formed.\n\n**Blue Lines** = Key areas of support/resistance. I don't like focusing on supp/res levels every $2 down like some people do. I look at the bigger picture and find where where key levels of buyers come in to grab the stock. I'll try to sell puts there.\n\n# Master Plays This Week\n\n**LULU - 4 week earnings run-up play**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1li7lsn4yhz51.png?width=2430&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3a52ab2615fbdc745084ff5eecfc0c3de87a55ce\n\nLULU has been trading in the same range for the last 5 months unable to hold the break-out, but not falling below support either. I'm feeling comfortable owning this stock around $310 range and expecting a potential run-up into earnings set to report mid December. I will look to sell Dec 18 puts to collect on earnings IV and see a potentially pump in the next few weeks. These will be about 4-5 weeks out, so I'll even sell closer to an at-the-money strike and hopefully find a good return. LULU IV isn't the best and the stock price will require a lot of buying power so I will keep an eye on some opportunities this week instead of jumping right into the play Monday AM.\n\n**Positions I'm looking at**:\n\nDec 18 $300 strike put for $9.50 or $950 in premium, 3.17% return in 5 weeks\n\n**OR**\n\nDec 18 $310 strike put for $12.50 or $1,250 in premium, 4.0% return in 5 weeks\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**DOCU - Earnings December 3rd**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/py6frev5yhz51.png?width=2434&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b547e7f2b24e661e5e1e1b069b4a915344faad7f\n\nI made some money on DOCU 2 weeks ago. Last week stock price was crushed by vaccine news which turned out to be nothing but fluff. We can see DOCU is once again trading at the lower range of the trend/channel (pink lines). The trend is still up, but the stock price has been highly volatile failing each break-out and returning into the channel. I like selling $195 or even $200 strike puts if I can. All depends how we open Monday. DOCU is set to report earnings December 3rd.\n\n**Positions I'm looking at:**\n\nDec 4 $200 strike put for $11.00 or $1,100 premium, a return of 5.5% in 3 weeks\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**AMD - A spin-off from NVDA earnings.**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/z39ri90cyhz51.png?width=2304&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=43185021db634a624327cadaae0792e097e98b83\n\nI made some good money selling puts on AMD back in June/July when the stock was trading completely flat for 2 months. The price action from May-August is very similar to what it's doing now, just at lower stock price back then. Looks like it's been in a similar range for the last few weeks. NVDA options are quite expensive, so I'll be using AMD as a proxy and playing that. Looking at the fancy crayola support/resistance lines I drew I think there will be buyers if we get down to $78 or $74. I'm comfortable **HODL**ing AMD at those levels and run the wheel if I need to. In my opinion, we can see a bullish bounce from NVDA earnings. If you have the capital and want to sell against NVDA I think there is a similar play that can be found there.\n\n**Positions:**\n\nAMD Nov 27 $78 strike puts for $1.10, a return of 1.4% in 2 weeks.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TDOC - TELEDOC**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nr8v2rbdyhz51.png?width=2300&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e5d4f41ae7c40013b0a00df854479fca014b6577\n\nTDOC is a newly added ticker to my watchlist and I think will have good potential in the future. You might be seeing me enter this trade quite a few times in the next weeks. The TDOC chart has been highly volatile recently. I wouldn't say technicals don't matter, but it's quite possible this stock just blows past any support/resistance with ease. The stock has had a pretty good dip in last week's trading sessions and trading down 30% from the August highs. I'm comfortable selling the $175 strike put and owning the stock at that price if it continues to dip.\n\n**Positions:**\n\nNov 27 $175 put for $4.30, or 2.5% return in 2 weeks.\n\nA lot depends how we open Monday, if market has a melt-up we simply wait until entry points become favorable to us. That might not be until later in the week, but patience is always key in the stonk market. If we open down then we can sell the positions mentioned at 1 or 2 strikes lower for the same premium, that's a win-win. Don't forget we have a monthly options expiration this week and it could be volatile.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHope y'all had a good weekend, **lets get this bread**.\n\n**10am UPDATE:**\n\nClosed 1 of my BABA CSP's for a 15% gain, will let the other ride to expiration or close at 90% to free up capital if I want another play.\n\nAt the market open everything was moving fast. Wish I got in when everything was pretty red, but it climbed quick shortly after open. Entered only 2 positions so far, AMD + TDOC, I think I will add DOCU in there as well. I'm still liking most plays on my list, but going to sit tight for now. Lots of opportunities out there. Good luck all! Will post another update \n\n**Positions**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7zcicbkdamz51.jpg?width=1125&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=df7ebc4702398c8337b485acbffd9caf78e196c9",

        "selftext": "**Biden wins the election, what does this mean for the economy and the stock market, what Buffen\u2019s Berkshire has done in the last quarter and more, let\u2019s talk about everything** \n\nHey everyone and welcome, I am going to react to the latest news from the election, the economy and in the stock market from last week and what to expect next\n\nSo late Saturday the victory of Biden was announced as networks finally started to predict that he won the election. I have no partisan view as i am not a resident or citizen of the US, but i believe that the results of this election (the Biden win and the Republicans keeping the Senate) is the best the stock market could have hoped for, as many experts were predicting a Blue Sweep. There still will be two important runoff elections in Georgia at the beggining of 2021, where the Democrats could still end up winning the Senate. Biden currently has a projected 290 electoras votes but i believe he will also keep the lead in Georgia and end up with 306 electoral votes, the same number as Trump had 4 years ago [VOTE MAP](https://ibb.co/LZ5dnzt) . Important leaders like the German Chancellor, Uk\u2019s prime minister, Canada\u2019s prime minister, France\u2019s president and many more welcomed and congratuled the win of Biden, which seems to be favored internationaly by the world leaders as they were tired of the whipsaw that came with Trump tweeting non-stop. So this probable grid-lock in Congress is loved by the stock market, as there are no iminent tax raises and a stimulus bill is far more likely if not by the end of the Trump mandate surely at the very start of Biden\u2019s.\n\nSo this scenario that is playing out seems to be the most profitable one for wall street as the average annual return since 1933 is about 14% with a Democractic President and a split Congress [Historical CHART](https://ibb.co/SJGP97P)\n\nYesterday Biden also announced how they will try to combat the illness with Better testing and tracing, a increase in PPE production, National guidance for schools, business and families, Investments of 25 bilion in vaccine development and distribution and mask mandates. While also trying to make the higher risk individuals more safe.\n\nP.S. Here\u2019s a funny meme that LeBron James posted with a throwback to his big block of an opponent. [MEME](https://ibb.co/2hmQk6R)\n\nSo all 3 big indices had the best week since early April with the Nasdaq composite being up just over 9% [NASDAQ CHART](https://ibb.co/rpgWtJH), the SP500 was up 7,32% [S&amp;P CHART](https://ibb.co/Ss7FWVN) and the DOW gained almost 7%.[DOW CHART](https://ibb.co/j3bB0P8) The Nasdaq and Sp were flat for the day, pairing loses from the begining of the day while the down fell 0,23% mostly based on profit taking in my opinion.\n\nThere were more companies that were declining on Friday with over 60% of the companies in the red but with a disproportional number of almost 90% of new highs while the volume fell again way below average [MARKET CHART](https://ibb.co/k0kY7Z1) . There weren\u2019t any significant leaders in the market on Friday but energy traield again being more than 2% down [SECTOR CHART](https://ibb.co/VDFksR8) while small caps under-performed the market especialy the value plays.  [CHART](https://ibb.co/9ndqFLC)\n\nThe fear in the market seems to have completly gone away as we have seen another 10% decline in the VIX indicator to drop below 25. [VIX CHART](https://ibb.co/8MjSd1f)\n\nHere is a heat map of Friday, you can see this was quite a slow day, not to many green companies but not that big of a red day either. [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/nsCvwVz)\n\nThe US economy added more than 638 thousand jobs [NEWS](https://ibb.co/hDrrTXs) more than 503 thousand that were expected [CHART](https://ibb.co/C6fD3Sh), while the unemployment rate fell to 6,9% way better than the 7,7% expected this is the sixt straight month of jobs recovery.[CHART](https://ibb.co/RBZzdVG) As they seem to be in a big V shape recovery, overall  [V- SHAPE](https://ibb.co/HN6n9dH)\n\nThe market should now turn they\u2019re attention to the samshing of the earnings season amid the election with 2 thirds of the SP500 beating the estimates both the top and bottom line, that is almost double the 38% historical average. \n\nBank of American release a chart for q3 earnings and as you can see earnings have increased 6,7% in the SP500 year over year and 21,5% quarter over quarter. [EARNINGS CHART](https://ibb.co/C6zfWZR)\n\nAnd as the fed announced that it will keep the benchmark rate between 0 and 0,25% [FED NEWS](https://ibb.co/vjNy43D)this continues to stimulate the economy of the US, with the fed beeing probably more responsible for the recovery in the last months as stimulus has been staled in congress. Also they continue to have a target of a running inflation of 2% and will continue to buy assests worth around 120 billion dollars montly to pump money in the economy  [FED NEWS](https://ibb.co/wBxn56S). If a stimulus bill will eventualy pass, households will probably continue to use the money the same way as last time with over 70% of the money being used for savings and debt payments. But thay may go down a little as people may tend to spend a little more on essentials and non essentials with a better outlook in the near future than last time. [HOUSEHOLD SPENDING](https://ibb.co/dbbKCj6)\n\nHere are some interesting economic events for next weeks as we continue to closely watch how to recovery is going. [CALENDAR](https://ibb.co/gMX5XH5)\n\nNvidia saw a pop in the stock finally as they announced that Fornite will join the GeForce gaming cliud, that could mean a return for the game in ios devices with GeForce currently available on Mac,Windows,Android and Chromebooks. The company has almost reteurn to it all time highs after this weeks strong gains. [NVIDIA CHART](https://ibb.co/1qxmphB)\n\nBuffets Berkshire announced on Saturday that they bought back around 9 billion of the company\u2019s stock,bringing the total to around 16 bilion for the year so far.[BUYBACK CHART](https://ibb.co/ysw5bkx) That was around 4 billion more than in the second quarter. the operating earnings also decrease a little since last quarter and are almost 3 billion or 32% less then last year. [BUYBACK NEWS](https://ibb.co/fSWCvdQ)The only segment that improved since last year was Railroad,utilities and enegery, while insurance was the biggest loser.\n\nThe company has almost the same amount of cash and short term investemtns like the previos quarter at around 146 billion dollars with 70% of the investments concentrated in 4 big companies (Apple , Bank of America, Coca-Cola and American Express) up from the 60% these company represented at the end of 2019. [INVESTMENTS](https://ibb.co/Dps2f95)\n\nThe buybacks of the company exced any full year amount in Berkhsire\u2019s history and far exeded the analysts expectation of around 3,2 billion in buybacks. As the strategy for Buffet and Charlie Munger is to buyback the company\u2019s stock as long as they believe it\u2019s undervalued and they will still have ample cash after the buybacks. AS the only other major investments made last quarter were about 6 billion invested in the five big Japenese trading houses and the data storage company Snowflake.\n\nI just saw some interesting news as NetFlix announced they will launch a offering named NetFlix Direct in France that will come with a linear feed of content from Netflix\u2019s library, so the company that is the biggest reasons for the decline of old TV programming made quite a twist as they seek to expand more and more.  [NETFLIX NEWS](https://ibb.co/gWzmKKs)\n\nHere is a list with some of the most important earnings next week, some companies that i like that are reporting are: McDonalds, Datadog, Tencent, Corsair, Purple, Lemonade and DraftKings. [EARNINGS NEXT WEEKS](https://ibb.co/JFKh6kN)\n\nThank you everyone for reading!  Be sure to leave a comment down below!\n\nHave a great day and see you next time!",

        "selftext": "Ok so my first official DD but I\u2019ve got some conviction around it so I thought I\u2019d get the beautiful masses to opine\n\nMy thesis is MRVL is undervalued and primed for a earnings, EOY and 2021 run. Four main points:\n\n1. The whole chip sector is exploding between the tech wave, 5g, cloud, etc (and even the beloved palantir needing chips as they grow like crazy). And MRVL is focused on 5g and cloud infrastructure specifically and kickin ass in these markets\n\n2. Within this sector, MRVL is a value play at 20x PE. That\u2019s compared to a company like Nvidia at 85 and AMD at 120! But they all 3 have comparable gross profit margins. This means that as things keep looking up this offers bigger growth potential than the big players\n\n3. MRVL price has been depressed because they made a huge acquisition in October of INPHI. This gives them huge further growth potential into their strengths of 5g and cloud.  And this merger is virtually guaranteed not at some level questionable like the ARM-NVDA deal. \n\nAND this makes them a great acquisition target for a big player cuz they have a ton of assets at a lowish price. \n\nHere\u2019s the MRVL CEO talking about the acquisition:\nMarvell Tech CEO on acquiring data center company Inphi, 5G growth\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/video/2020/10/29/marvell-tech-ceo-on-acquiring-data-center-company-inphi-5g-growth.html?__source=iosappshare%7Ccom.apple.UIKit.activity.Message\n\n4. MRVL has huge institutional ownership (at 89%!) so if we do start to get some price movement the float is small enough that we could see a 10-20% move in share price fast as retail fomos in. Especially in the event of an acquisition.  Also this should reinforce that smart money sees this as a great play. \n\n\nWith earnings coming up on 12/3 I think we see a modest run into it and then a pop on earnings. Yes I said it a pop! Not a pull back like most other tech because this is the first time we hear all the details of this acquisition and it\u2019s potential huge value that MRVL hasn\u2019t run on. \n\nI\u2019m taking a short and long term position for lower risk. If we do get a good earnings run up I\u2019ll flip my short term calls into shares for the long term. \n\n100 12/11 46c\n50 1/21/22 50c \n\nTLDR: buy MRVL. You\u2019ll thank me later\n\n\nSide note: I\u2019m a big fan of the strategy of buying leaps then selling super otm weeklies against them and buying shares with that money to build a position for free essentially with the leaps as long term leverage. This is my plan for my MRVL leaps once earnings passes. This strategy has been working out for me on SPY but I\u2019d love to hear peoples thoughts on any pitfalls they see.",

Barbara Comstock (VA-10)**\n\nComstock lost her 2018 re-election bid and I don't necessarily think she is a WSBer (she doesn't trade nearly as many meme stocks as the other guys on this list) but I do blame her for turning off the ATM that was 2016-2018 $MU.\n\nShe bought \\~$75,000 worth of Micron Technology stock on 6/25/18, just days before the first stretch in years when the stock wasn't literally printing money. MU lost half its value in the next 6 months, and still hasn't recovered to the price she purchased it at.\n\n---\n\n**#5. Rep. Alan Lowenthal (CA-47)**\n\n***Favorite meme stocks: SPCE, GLD***\n\nLowenthal is actually one of the more successful traders on this list, having gotten in to $GLD in September of 2019. He also timed his exit from $SPCE pretty well, selling about half of his position right at the mid-February peak.\n\nIf I had to guess, I'd say Lownethal just lurks the sub looking for opportunities to inverse WSB.\n\n---\n\n**#4. Rep. Josh Gottheimer (NJ-5)**\n\n***Favorite meme stocks: SNAP, TSLA, GE, NVDA, LULU, AMD***\n\nThe Josh Gottheimer story is a story of perseverance and diamond hands. I'm pretty sure this guy read some DD on here that said SNAP was going to moon after its IPO, because he bought into the stock just days after it went public. He caught the falling knife right on its tip as his position lost 75% of its value over the next couple years. A less man would have cut the loss, but Gottheimer just kept buying up more $SNAP even as it was losing him money. Those of you who have an eye on the markets (perhaps a minority) will know that his grit and determination was rewarded handsomely in the last couple months.\n\n---\n\n**#3. Sen. Pat Roberts (Kansas)**\n\n***Favorite meme stocks: TSLA, GLD, BYND, NVDA, GE***\n\nPat Roberts is another guy that I think just comes here to inverse the sub. Roberts made an impeccably well-timed TSLA play a few months ago when he bought in on August 3rd, just a few days before the August run-up began and then sold on September 1st, just before the early September drop.\n\nInsider trading or inversing WSB? You decide.\n\nWSB must be big in Kansas, because the next guy up is the fellow who was just elected to fill the vacancy being left by Roberts upcoming departure from the senate.\n\n---\n\n**#2. Rep. Roger Marshall (KS-1)**\n\n***Favorite meme stocks: JNUG, TSLA, SNAP, MU, ROKU, AMD, NVDA, LULU***\n\nMarshall got a big promotion to the Senate a few days ago, and if that didn't work out he probably would have switched to day-trading full time. He was already day-trading JNUG within a few months of entering office, buying and then selling thousands of dollars worth of the stock between market open and close.\n\nWhat Marshall really lacks is patience, as he recently entered then prematurely exited a position in ROKU in mid-September, missing out on big gains in the weeks to follow.\n\n---\n\n**#1 Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (Rhode Island)**\n\n***Favorite meme stocks: GME, TSLA, GE, NVDA***\n\nThe story of Sheldon Whitehouse is not a happy story, but it's a story that some of you might be told of many a member of this community. He had the right ideas, but just did not have strong enough hands to see them through.\n\nOn July 28, 2017, Whitehouse entered a position in $TSLA. Seeing a modest 3% gain through the month of August, he doubled down on his position on August 24th, 2017.\n\nAlthough he soon began to lose money as $TSLA sank, in Elon he still trusted, and he bought more $TSLA yet again in December of 2018.\n\nSadly for Whitehouse, we now reach the heartbreaking part of the story. Seeing a 30% loss on the investments into TSLA he'd been making over the last 2 years, Whitehouse lost faith and sold the entirety of the position on August 27th, 2019.\n\nAfter holding TSLA for over 2 years at a loss, he sold within weeks of what would become a yearlong, nearly 1000% run-up.",

        "selftext": "r/Stocks, I've been tracking my performance the last several weeks by selling theta and occasionally entering share positions. I normally post in the Options sub-reddit but just like my portfolio that is diversified in 4 stocks, I'm diversifying where I post my plays. This week I have a few positions where I will be buying shares. I thought maybe you guys would like to see my plays.\n\n**Here are the last 3 weeks of returns**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n|**Week**|Buying Power|Profit/Loss|Return|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|1|$75,000|$4,000|5%|\n|2|$79,000|$1,600|2%|\n|3|$81,000|$1,500|1.9%|\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**What am I doing?**\n\nI do technical analysis and selling cash-secured-puts 1 to 3 weeks out on stocks that are nearing key levels of support. My goal is to collect premium, but should I get assigned I have absolutely zero problem running the wheel on stocks I want to own. As a backstory I nearly blew up my account doing WSB-style plays in March but have regained all of my account and then some running this strategy since April. What I do now is basically wheeling on weekly puts.\n\nI watch over 200 stocks, I would say its 90% waiting game and 10% true technical analysis. My levels work, but it's normally because I am patiently waiting for an entry point. Yes that's a lot of tickers to watch, but I research my stocks on weekends and then monitor additional plays &amp; levels during the weekday to see if there is an obvious setup I want to participate in.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Here's a few things regarding my strategy**\n\n**1.** I don't do spreads because if the stock price blows past your long strike and you assume max loss you need a lot of capital to actually be assigned the shares. For that reason I don't really see spreads as a \"Theta Gang\" play and is still very high risk.\n\n**2.** I only sell cash-secured puts with the capability to be assigned if need be. My goal is to never take a loss on a position and always wheel it back to profitability. If something has changed fundamentally with the stock then yes I will close the position and realize the loss. \n\n**3.** If IV on a ticker is very low, then yes I will outright buy shares instead.\n\n**4.** I only aim for 1-4% per week collecting on theta and an occasional earnings theta yolo. No call-buying, no spreads, only put-selling!\n\nHonestly, that's about it. I'll go through some tickers on my watchlist this weekend and what I currently have open.\n\n# Open Positions From Last Week\n\n**LULU:** 1x LULU 18 Dec 2020 PUT @ $310 strike. Currently up 45% on the play.\n\nThis is holding a lot of my buying power. I'm already up 45% on the play on the run-up it's had so far last week. Waiting for the last 40-50% profit might be laborious since the option will begin to lose theta &amp; delta as the stock price increases. Up 45% in a few days why wait another 2 weeks for the remaining 40%? I will be looking to sell this option once it hits 60% profit or so.\n\n# Chart Rules\n\n**Pink Lines** = Trading range &amp; channel. I find stocks typically trade within certain channels until an event, such as earnings or some news which changes the fundamentals of the stock price changes the trend and a new channel is formed.\n\n**Blue Lines** = Key areas of support/resistance. I don't like focusing on supp/res levels every $2 down like some people do. I look at the bigger picture and find where where key levels of buyers come in to grab the stock. I'll try to sell puts there.\n\n# Master Plays This Week\n\n**FB - Facebook**\n\nFacebook has been on a slow and steady uptrend staying within the pink channel. It's tested support a couple times on weakness and bounced cleanly off them each time. Stock price at $269 (nice) is currently at the lower range of the uptrend channel. I think we'll see some continued momentum upward. If we get another re-test of some lows I think we will find some support at $260 and again at $250. IV is pretty low for facebook, so buying shares and selling weekly covered calls at 0.15 delta for a little extra premium might be better return than put-selling.\n\n**Positions on the watch:**\n\nDec 18 $260 PUT sold to open. Premium collected: $610, return: 1.5% in 4 weeks. \n\nBreak-even price would be if the stock closes below $253.90 by December 18 (currently $270).\n\nOR\n\n100x shares \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**KR - Kroger**\n\nKroger has always been a boring stock. I've labeled in purple where Buffet announced his stake. The stock shot up after the news and has been range-bound staying between $31-$34 with a slight uptrend. I think KR will react somewhat similar to WMT's stock price with a slow and steady upward grind. If so, we are at the bottom of the channel looking for continued momentum upward. Kroger reports earnings in 2 weeks and might provide a little extra premium on some plays.\n\n**Plays on the watch:**\n\nDec 11 $31.50 PUT sold to open. Premium Collected: $65, return: 2% in 3 weeks.\n\nOR\n\nIV is low again, so owning some shares and selling CC against might also be a good move.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**MSFT - Microsoft**\n\nClassic Microsoft, not really doing much until it does. This chart only displays the last 6 months, but zooming further out you will see MSFT only goes up, albeit rather slowly. Last 3 months it's been in a slight uptrend bouncing between the $200 and $215/220 levels. Currently at the bottom of the trend channel, and might see some continued momentum going up. Big time support at $200 if we do see a little dip.\n\n**Positions on the watch:**\n\nDec 18 $200 strike PUT sold to open. Premium Collected: $240, return: 1.2% in 3 weeks.\n\nOR\n\nBuying shares and selling covered calls.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**NVDA - Nvidia**\n\nI am very bullish on NVDA in long-term. This is another ticker that will benefit as the world shifts even more-so on the tech side of things. They have been server revenue massively and they are no longer just a gaming chip company. Very bullish uptrend even if another round of covid quarantines and lockdowns hit. I think we can see this ticker re-test the $560 level and have another break-out. Otherwise we might see downtrend back to $500 or $510. \n\n**Positions on the watch:**\n\nOptions are pretty expensive here. Best play in my opinion is to be purchasing shares outright.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**SHOP - Shopify**\n\nShopify has been within the same range since June. A few times it almost broke out of the $100 level, but was pulled right back in. The stock price is sitting at the lower end of the uptrend channel and close to the $1,000 support/resistance. If it breaks through this time look for some confirmation up above and into the $1,100 zone. I do like e-commerce long-term and think SHOP is at the very top of this list when you think e-commerce.\n\n**Positions on the watch:**\n\nOptions here are also very expensive, I think I might purchase some shares and look for a quick 3-4% pop this or next week.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'll be posting an update tomorrow morning with more potential theta plays and what I've entered.\n\nTime to dial in your trading, let's get this bread.",

        "selftext": "Dell has earnings on the morning of Tuesday November 24th. Dell is a computer manufacturer along with other technology such as projectors, notebooks, printers, and headphones. You know what this means, at home working. Along with this part of business, it has a CLOUD portion. Yes this boomer stonk has a cloud business by the name of VMW. This allows them not only to sell computers but have a steady cloud business. VMW ware has shown consistent growth, with an average of 12ish % yoy. Cloud has obvious boomed during Covid-19, so you can assume VMW will have great returns this earnings. In addition for VMW, it has partnered with NVDA to make AI chips better.\n\n[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/vmware-nvidia-partner-ai-chips-120728435.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/vmware-nvidia-partner-ai-chips-120728435.html)\n\nNow the PC  sales will be fantastic as shown CSCO, LOGI, and Target. If you did not know all of these companies massively beat earnings. All of them sell computers, headphones, etc. Target is a massive provider for Dell's computers. \n\nNow I know some people will say Dell = Apple! It will miss!\n\nBut, Dell does not sell Iphones and laptops just for money. In addition, Dell is cheaper than Apple. Why would you spend 2k for a new laptop when you have a old one? With Dell, laptops can be under 1000 dollars, and people would want to upgrade for better ones/\n\nThey have a 3 sections.\n\nVMW and computer which I covered but they have storage portion too.\n\nI believe that because school came back, many people brought Dell computers and products for stay-at-home. In addition to VMW and storage revenue. Dell's earnings estimates have barely moved since Q2 and it provides for a great beat.\n\n[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pc-sales-continue-benefiting-covid-102110153.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pc-sales-continue-benefiting-covid-102110153.html)\n\nAlso NVDA and AMD's new CPU's and GPU's are in Dell's products. If you wanted a new rtx 3070 or rtx 3080, or rtx 3090, you can buy it in a Dell PC. If you just look at AMD's and NVDA's sales you can tell there is great demand for their chips.\n\nNow onto technicals, Dell broke their march uptrend line but has bounced off the lows and created a new uptrend. It is just below ATH which it failed to break 3 months ago. If earnings beats, it could fucking moon 10% or more. Keep in mind that Dell has gone up on past 3-4 earnings.\n\nNow Dell's IV is low , with just 47%. So you will not get IV crushed that badly. Also, it is not a volatile stock, and max moves down are rarely greater than 4%\n\nAlso there has been lots of buying for Dell calls, on Friday 1750 12/18c were traded\n\nYou want links? here you go\n\n[https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/8/21508481/alienware-rtx-3080-3090-aurora-r11-r10-area-51-monitor-360hz](https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/8/21508481/alienware-rtx-3080-3090-aurora-r11-r10-area-51-monitor-360hz)\n\n[https://www.forbes.com/sites/barrycollins/2020/07/10/pc-sales-surge-during-coronavirus-crisisand-hps-the-big-winner/?sh=654c20455227](https://www.forbes.com/sites/barrycollins/2020/07/10/pc-sales-surge-during-coronavirus-crisisand-hps-the-big-winner/?sh=654c20455227)\n\n[https://gadgets.ndtv.com/laptops/news/pc-sales-climb-as-covid-19-pandemic-keeps-consumers-at-home-idc-gartner-2261022](https://gadgets.ndtv.com/laptops/news/pc-sales-climb-as-covid-19-pandemic-keeps-consumers-at-home-idc-gartner-2261022)\n\n[https://www.marketwatch.com/story/target-earnings-beat-expectations-11605699139#:\\~:text=Target%20reported%20TKTK&amp;text=Revenue%20of%20%2422.63%20billion%20was,FactSet%20consensus%20of%20%2420.77%20billion.&amp;text=Comparable%20sales%20jumped%2020.7%25%20with,sales%20were%20filled%20by%20stores](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/target-earnings-beat-expectations-11605699139#:~:text=Target%20reported%20TKTK&amp;text=Revenue%20of%20%2422.63%20billion%20was,FactSet%20consensus%20of%20%2420.77%20billion.&amp;text=Comparable%20sales%20jumped%2020.7%25%20with,sales%20were%20filled%20by%20stores).\n\nTLDR: Buy Dell because it's fucking mooning.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n12/18 68c and 12/18 70c",

        "selftext": "I'm not seeing a lot about NVIDIA so here's my DD.  It reports earnings on 11/18 after market close.  Expectations are high.  Revenues are expected to be around 4.4 billion, a 46% increase year over year.  EPS are expected to be $2.57, an increase of 44% year over year.  NVDA has beat the last 4 earnings by an average of 11.5%.  \n\nThey are expected to have benefited from sales growth in graphic chips due to the pandemic and more people working from home, but there are concerns that supply chain disruptions could have a negative impact.  Last month,[they announced](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/october-2020-rtx-blockbuster-and-indie-game-update/) that Minecraft, Black OPS Cold War, and many other huge games would be using their RTX ray tracing technology. \n\n[They have also partnered](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/gpu-cloud-computing/) with every major cloud-based solution platform to optimize performance of these services through their GPU hardware. \n\nThere have been 35 upward revisions from analysts in the last 3 months leading to this earnings report, and 0 downward revisions. \n\nAs far as technicals go, it is undoubtedly trading at a much higher multiple that it probably should be, but we all know the entire market is extremely inflated.  It recently underwent a 14% sell off from its high of $589, and is currently sitting at $531.88.  It bounced nearly perfectly off its 50 day EMA on Friday, the Stoch RSI on the daily crossed bullish, and the MACD on the hourly is close to crossing bullish.  \n\nMy position, entered Friday, is 12/4 545c.  The IV is only 54%.  I think NVDA is set up for a run into Thursday, and could see it working back up to its all time high.   I think this could be another example of a very good earnings report that leads to a sell off after reporting because of the expectations are just insanely high.  I'm going to hopefully ride the wave into Thursday, then make the call on whether to hold through the report or not.  BOL",

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, November 19, 2020**\n\nThe S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and the Dow Jones (DIA) finished modestly red for the third straight day with market participants closely monitoring rising coronavirus cases in the US and the reimposition of virus restrictions across many states. Despite the positive vaccine news coming out, it will still take some time to establish a global vaccine distribution network.\n\nUnfortunately, yesterday the United States passed the grim milestone of 250,000 deaths from coronavirus. The death toll surpasses the White House\u2019s worst-case prediction from the Spring ([https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2020/03/31/trump-coronavirus-pandemic-could-kill-many-240-000-americans/5100446002/](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2020/03/31/trump-coronavirus-pandemic-could-kill-many-240-000-americans/5100446002/)) and is predicted to keep rising with the surge of infections and hospitalizations in the last two weeks. According to Johns Hopkins University, the US is averaging a record 161,165 new infections a day in the last seven days. That\u2019s up 27% compared to last week and by far the most since the pandemic began. Data is trending in the wrong directions, with 44 out of 50 states reporting a 10% increase in new cases compared to last week. \n\nIn response to the surge in cases, governors from both sides of the aisle have announced a variety of new restrictions. California\u2019s governor Gavin Newsom announced that the state is \u201cpulling the emergency brake\u201d on reopening and reinstated broad restrictions throughout the state. In Iowa, Republican Governor Kim Reynolds, who once dismissed coronavirus restrictions as \"feel-good\" measures, has abruptly reversed course, issuing the state's first mask mandate and limiting indoor gatherings. Illinois**,** Michigan, and New Jersey announced additional restrictions that limit gatherings to household members. Indoor event spaces are also being ordered to shut-down or move outdoors. In Massachusetts, the governor announced a stay-at-home advisory. Mississippi, Montana, North Dakota are under state-wide mask mandate. These are just some examples, there are many more. \n\nThe Labor Department released its weekly jobs report. Another 742,000 Americans filed for first-time unemployment benefits last week, an unexpected rise compared to the 711,000 reported last week as coronavirus cases continue to surge.\n\n* 742,000 new claims vs 700,000 estimate\n* Continuing claims,  which is the number of people filing for unemployment benefits who have already filed an initial claim, was 6.4 million, equal to the estimate.\n\nDespite the positive vaccine data from Pfizer (PFE) and Moderna (MRNA), setting up an efficient, global vaccine distribution network will likely take months, even after the vaccines are approved. In the short-term, we expect the worsening pandemic and uncertainty surrounding additional fiscal stimulus will likely drive volatility in the short-term.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Another vaccine candidate frontrunner from Oxford University in partnership with AstraZeneca $AZN is expected to release data before Christmas.\n* BREXIT negotiations have been suspended because of COVID 19\n* Xperi $XPER target raise by Royal Bank of Canada from $21 to $25, stock currently around $18.50\n* Uber $UBER with two target raises.

        "selftext": "**Tesla has just been added to the SP, is this the time to buy the stock? Moderna just announced a new vaccine, what does this mean for the stock market? Let\u2019s talk about this and other stock market news** [BANNER](https://ibb.co/GMCv9B1)\n\nHey everyone and Welcome, so let\u2019s start with the recap of yesterday as we saw all 3 big indices in the green with a late push to end the day. The dow was the biggest gainer up 1,6% and also posted a new record close just shy of the 30k mark [CHART](https://ibb.co/NrF0HWc) ,while the broader SP500 trailed a little the whole day and finished up 1,17%  [CHART](https://ibb.co/xhkQWnk) while even the tech heavy Nasdaq finished in the green after a slow start to the day on the Moderna vaccine news with a late push to end up 0,8% [CHART](https://ibb.co/tcGnChD). The VIX continued to decline to it lowest levels since august as it continues to slowly trend to it\u2019s pre-shutdown levels [CHART](https://ibb.co/Wfy5Kg6). Almost all sectors [CHART](https://ibb.co/hLY6Fzx) were in the green yesterday as a repeat of last Monday happened with Energy, Industrials and Financials having a good boost from the Moderna news with over 3 quarters of the companies advancing and 141 of them making new highs [CHART](https://ibb.co/qMjmtwf), the average volume return to normal, as there was not such a big transition in portfolios like a week ago. The rally was mostly pushed by small cap and value plays as even the Russel 2000 made new highs after this news. [CHART](https://ibb.co/PQb0kJw)\n\nThis is the HEAT map from yesterday and as you can see, most of the companies gained, except the ones from Health Care, where all of the money rushed to Moderna [CHART](https://ibb.co/3YkLfw8), but I believe this is a great misjudgment for investors, as there is not a lot of money to be made on this vaccine, and this is the only product they offer at the moment, so I don\u2019t think it really deserves the 100$ price range in which it has traded yesterday. I don\u2019t like this stock at all at this point, if you do want to play the vaccine news and profits you should look at other companies that will help distribute it like CVS, Walgreens, McKesson, Costco, Walmart and others. [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/ByMvyxs)\n\nBefore the open today we will here from Walmart and Home depot which release earnings reports, this is also followed by economic reports like retail sales, business inventories and some other interesting events that are due later. [EVENTS](https://ibb.co/WfzJdMk) [BEFORE OPEN](https://ibb.co/WvKW8hn)\n\nSo, let\u2019s talk about what the vaccine news were yesterday as Moderna  [NEWS](https://ibb.co/52fSmF4) announced a vaccine that has an even better efficiency than Pfizer\u2019s at over 94% and also doesn\u2019t require such extreme temperatures to be stored and transported, Pfizer required under -80 degrees Celsius while Moderna is stable up to 6 months at only -20 degrees Celsius or even at 2-8 degrees Celsius for up to 30days. So, there is expectation that both Moderna and Pfizer will file for the FDA emergency use authorization very soon. Both will require 2 shots for the vaccine to be effective almost a month apart. This will also be followed in the next few months with results from AstraZeneca and JNJ so the more vaccines that are available the faster the pandemic will end, but I wouldn\u2019t rush out of the tech names that have brought the market here, they are here to stay even after this all ends. The world didn\u2019t just run into tech companies because of the pandemic, the world was already going there but this was only accelerated by this, and I don\u2019t see companies that don\u2019t need to going back to the way it was, because this has brought better margin profits for many companies as there are fewer expenses with the work from home environment.\n\nSo in my opinion The markets are likely going to keep it up, as I don\u2019t see a crash or a pullback soon as there are a lot more positives then negatives for the stock market. The only negative is that the reopening is not happening yet, but that will come next year, while there are a lot of positives like better treatments, the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines and probably more to come, a probably divided congress which is good news for not many changes that affect the stock market [MARKET GAIN](https://ibb.co/yXB5Mpy), the ultra-low interest rates that are here to stay for a while as the Fed will keep the economy going and a probable stimulus that will come eventually.  [LIQUIDITY](https://ibb.co/6wx3gBz)\n\nThere are a lot of things that drives stocks higher like very good earnings [EARNINGS CHART](https://ibb.co/hXCwZGD) from most of the companies that I really think will continue to be very good and even get better in the next years as more money will be put into the economy by the fed and eventually by the consumers also the companies are starting to pay dividends again and there is a lot of money still on the sidelines that can come back in the stock market. [https://ibb.co/yXB5Mpy](https://ibb.co/yXB5Mpy)\n\nThis year is the second time that ETF\u2019s have had a more than 400 billion dollars of inflow and that will likely keep going up, as investors are leaving low rate bonds and taking on more risk with equities as the US total assets under management are up over 5 Trillion $.  [INTEREST RATES](https://ibb.co/8KCWtqr)\n\nMeanwhile after the close yesterday, it was announced that Tesla will finally be included in the SP500 on the 21st of December this year. This is after the company has had a longer path of profitability with 5 straight quarters of profit even with the pandemic ranging on. This will probably lead to a higher demand for the stock as index funds will need to buy the stock. [CHART](https://ibb.co/9ZL7wJC)\n\nAs you can see people have turned around opinions on the company as the short interest has plummeted from over 200 million shares to below 50 million shores in less than 2 years. That is a decrease of over 70% in just 12 months. [CHART](https://ibb.co/frL3ZGT)\n\nTesla has become the largest ever company to be added to the SP500, and will likely replace one of the bottom companies from the oil industry in the index. The company will have a 1% weight in the SP as the committee estimates the funding for the trade will need over 50 billion dollars, one of the largest in the SP History. The stock traded as much as 525 intra-day before dropping to below 400 after they were not included in the SP500 last go around [CHART](https://ibb.co/m5NxHGB). Even more actively managed funds that try to beat the SP will be forced to decide if they buy Tesla shares or not, as the company may give them a downside risk due to its high potential of growth, such funds manage trillions of dollars that could also pour into the stock. \n\nAnd With factories ramping up like Shanghai which will produce 1million vehicles, Freemont as well, and with Austin and Berlin factories expected to produce at least 500k, they will likely be able to produce over 2 million cars in 2022 or 2023, which is a great increase from around 600thousand/year capacity at the moment. [FACTORIES](https://ibb.co/DWWXWQK)\n\nThe stock has surged after hours more than 13% to around 460$ but I really like the company, and I believe the stock can go higher in the long term especially, I have a price target of just over 600$ for tesla, but we can see a re-test of the 500$ level very soon in the stock, with the EV push that is expected to come in the next years.  [TESLA NEWS](https://ibb.co/yXGxzFb) [TESLA NEWS](https://ibb.co/Qdt07QR)\n\nOne other big thing to follow today after the close is what NIO reports as the company has been targeted by short sellers recently and saw the stock drop from its highs over 50$ to barely 40$ in the span of a couple of days but has since recovered as a lot of people are very optimistic of the earnings report. The company is expected to lose around 17 cents per shares and have a revenue of over 600 million dollars, double the revenue that the company had a year ago. The stock has not beaten the estimates of earnings yet in the last 2 years, so this will be very good if the company finally manages to do that. [NIO](https://ibb.co/1R0bSXm)\n\nAlso, after the close, COSTCO announced a special dividend for shareholders of 10$ as they continue to be one of the greatest companies to own, as management has constantly taken care of shareholders with great dividends and great growth for the company. [NEWS](https://ibb.co/hKbnFpQ)\n\nOne other interesting news came from Nvidia which release a huge product, as the company release a new GPU with more than 80 gigabytes of memory, doubling the old model, this are huge performance numbers that are required in the new world of cloud computing.

        "selftext": "Listen up you degenerates.\n\nIf you\u2019ve been pouting all month because you missed out on election week rally, post-Pfizer Dow rally (because you were a pussy who held cash), NIO \ud83d\ude80, or you were simply \ud83c\udf08 \ud83d\udc3b, then I have the play the next stock to fawn over.\n\n**What is Corsair Gaming (CRSR)**\n\nEven though this company started trading publicly only a month~ or so, this is a legit company that already pulls in billion dollars in revenue. Company\u2019s products are beloved by all the losers in your life (i.e. your loser childhood friend who works at McDonald\u2019s and spends all their paycheck towards RH YOLO trades, weed, and video games).\n\nThis is the number one seller of high-performance computer memory, cases, power supplies, coolers and gaming keyboards as well as #2 in performance controllers and streaming gear. Per Andy Paul (CEO) in their most recent earnings call, he reported that most of their product lines maintain a top 3 US market share positions, with several number one positions according to data from NPD group.\n\n\n**So what? Why should I care?**\n\nListen you retard. When there\u2019s unexpected nudity during that HBO show that you watch on Sunday night, you say thank you. You don\u2019t stop and ask, \u201cMan, I thought this show was rated PG. Why is there nudity?\u201d Similarly, when someone tells you about a promising stock that is going to double, triple, and quadruple from the current price point, you fucking listen and continue to read the wisdom documented in this long ass fucking post.\n\nCorsair generates their revenue from two segments.\n\nSegment 1: Gamer/Creator Peripherals.\n\nFor you retards who can\u2019t understand big words like peripherals, this segment includes gaming keyboards, mice, controllers, headsets and other streaming equipment such as capture cards and microphones. And I am not talking about $10 mice or $20 keyboards that your broke ass buy at Staples. These are high margin, high end, top of the line gaming/computer peripherals used by those talent-less hacks streaming live on Twitch, YouTube, OnlyFans, etc for \u201cdonations\u201d. Today, 71% of millennial gamers in the US watch gaming video content on streaming platforms for an average of almost 6 hours per week. There are over 6 million committed streamers in the world today who viewed over 12 billion streaming hours in 2019 alone.\n\nThe revenue in this segment spiked 129% YOY in the most recent quarter to $161.1 million. It made up for 35% of CRSR\u2019s total revenue. This is high fucking margin business, which means Corsair is a winner that rips off those losers mentioned above. Their gross margin was 37.1% in the most recent quarter.\n\nSegment 2: Gaming Components and Systems.\n\nThis segment includes sales of equipment such as computer cases, RAM, cooling solutions, power supply units and pre-built gaming PCs. You know those losers with a big ass gaming desktop PCs with \ud83c\udf08 \ud83d\udc3b LED lights around the case? Those \ud83e\udd21 s spend shit load of money on these gaming systems because it makes them feel important when they play video games with other losers. The gross margin for this segment is 28%. Not too shabby.\n\nIn the most recent filing, their total revenue increased 60.7% YOY to $457.1 million and the gross margin jumped significantly. Adjusted operating income increased 194% to $61.4 mil.\n\n**Ok. So they rocked this quarter. But what about their future? What is their outlook?**\n\nWell you ungrateful greedy f*ck, CRSR is well positioned to benefit from long term growth trends in the gaming hardware market, making it an ideal play for retards like you who can only ask questions like, \u201cPS5 or the new XBOX? SNE or MSFT?\u201d. No you retard. Those stocks are not gaming pure plays, and they are not fucking cheap. Your broke ass can\u2019t afford them. \n\nCRSR can rely on the gamer and creator peripherals business to drive sustained growth in the future. Why? Because of the fast growing e-sports market. According to some smart ass industry experts, they estimate that the global e-sports market could clock a compound annual growth rate of over 24% thru 2027. That means, the demand for video game streaming equipment and other peripherals is expected to increase in the coming years, adding $2.8 billion worth of incremental revenue over the next four years in this market alone.\n\nCRSR reportedly has 18.3% of the peripherals market today and controls 41.9% of the PC components market. The entire PC gaming hardware market is expected to add $3.6 billion in incremental revenue this year, thanks to all the losers playing games at home due to COVID. The total market size for PC gaming hardware market today is $40 billion, of which 83% was spending from competitive and committed gamers. These are true retards who will spend between $1,000 to over $1,800 on gaming hardware and accessories. \n\n**But the stock ran up quite a bit. Should I wait will it drops?**\n\nThe stock is still cheap. Their POS (Price to Sales) ratio is 1.91. In comparison, Logitech\u2019s POS is at 4.3. Additionally, CRSR is currently priced at 80x trailing earnings and has a forward P/E ratio of 26. Both are favorable compared to their peers.\n\nBecause of COVID, upcoming holidays and other factors/trends that are favorable to Corsair (i.e. anticipated next generation gaming hardware/GPU to be launched by NVDA and AMD), CRSR is expected to generate full year revenue of $1.6 billion this year (which is 45% increase YOY)\n\n- Second Wave COVID: Will force consumers to stay at home and people will need other activities apart from binging Netflix.\n\n- Holiday Retail Sales Outlook is still positive. Gaming products will be boosted by Black Friday, Cyber Monday and Christmas shopping.\n\n- People are upgrading their home PCs. As more people stay at home or work from home, more attention is being paid to the home PC and people are spending $ on upgrades.\n\nThey focus heavily on the higher end of the market, with product focus on performance and innovation. With gaming growing rapidly and big money flowing into this market, demand for performance is increasing. CRSR\u2019s products meet the expectation of what the gamers want (i.e. speed, precision, reliability, great processing power, etc)\n\nAlthough the competitive and committed gamers accounted for 83% of the $40 billion spend in the global market for PC and streaming gears in 2019, that only accounts for 18% of the worldwide total of 524 million PC gamers in 2019 with the remaining being casual gamers, who do not often rely on specialized high end gears yet. (Translation,there is untapped market of 82% among the 524 million PC gamers who have yet discovered the beauty of high end gaming stuff)\n\nIf the average spend of this group of gamers were to significantly move up going forward, then the market will also grow by multiples (for high end gaming stuff). \n\nThis stock is currently undervalued compared to its peers like Logitech and Razor. Not only that, the current P/E ratio of CRSR is roughly 3% below the overall P/E of NASDAQ. Additionally, looking at POS (Price to Sales) and MCS (Market Cap to Sales), CRSR is cheap by discount of 57% and 45% respectively to the NASDAQ. Sales are expected to grow next year by more than 30%.\n\n**Risks**\n\nF*ck risks. F*ck that mindset. This company is already profitable and prints money. If you retards can blindly throw money at losers like GME and NKLA, you can throw money at a company with actual sales, actual products and actual profits.\n\n**Price Target**\n\n$40+ per share by May 2021. You can play the call option or you can just buy the stock.\nEither way, it will get to $40 range and above once this stock\u2019s valuation catches up with the rest of the market. By end of 2021, I expect this stock to be $70-80. Oh, and for you retards who are risk averse, this stock is considered \u201cStay at Home\u201d stocks. It will moon during the pandemic, and it will moon after the pandemic.",

        "selftext": "**Tesla has just been added to the SP, is this the time to buy the stock? Moderna just announced a new vaccine, what does this mean for the stock market? Let\u2019s talk about this and other stock market news** [BANNER](https://ibb.co/GMCv9B1)\n\nHey everyone and Welcome, so let\u2019s start with the recap of yesterday as we saw all 3 big indices in the green with a late push to end the day. The dow was the biggest gainer up 1,6% and also posted a new record close just shy of the 30k mark [CHART](https://ibb.co/NrF0HWc) ,while the broader SP500 trailed a little the whole day and finished up 1,17%  [CHART](https://ibb.co/xhkQWnk) while even the tech heavy Nasdaq finished in the green after a slow start to the day on the Moderna vaccine news with a late push to end up 0,8% [CHART](https://ibb.co/tcGnChD). The VIX continued to decline to it lowest levels since august as it continues to slowly trend to it\u2019s pre-shutdown levels [CHART](https://ibb.co/Wfy5Kg6). Almost all sectors [CHART](https://ibb.co/hLY6Fzx) were in the green yesterday as a repeat of last Monday happened with Energy, Industrials and Financials having a good boost from the Moderna news with over 3 quarters of the companies advancing and 141 of them making new highs [CHART](https://ibb.co/qMjmtwf), the average volume return to normal, as there was not such a big transition in portfolios like a week ago. The rally was mostly pushed by small cap and value plays as even the Russel 2000 made new highs after this news. [CHART](https://ibb.co/PQb0kJw)\n\nThis is the HEAT map from yesterday and as you can see, most of the companies gained, except the ones from Health Care, where all of the money rushed to Moderna [CHART](https://ibb.co/3YkLfw8), but I believe this is a great misjudgment for investors, as there is not a lot of money to be made on this vaccine, and this is the only product they offer at the moment, so I don\u2019t think it really deserves the 100$ price range in which it has traded yesterday. I don\u2019t like this stock at all at this point, if you do want to play the vaccine news and profits you should look at other companies that will help distribute it like CVS, Walgreens, McKesson, Costco, Walmart and others. [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/ByMvyxs)\n\nBefore the open today we will here from Walmart and Home depot which release earnings reports, this is also followed by economic reports like retail sales, business inventories and some other interesting events that are due later. [EVENTS](https://ibb.co/WfzJdMk) [BEFORE OPEN](https://ibb.co/WvKW8hn)\n\nSo, let\u2019s talk about what the vaccine news were yesterday as Moderna  [NEWS](https://ibb.co/52fSmF4) announced a vaccine that has an even better efficiency than Pfizer\u2019s at over 94% and also doesn\u2019t require such extreme temperatures to be stored and transported, Pfizer required under -80 degrees Celsius while Moderna is stable up to 6 months at only -20 degrees Celsius or even at 2-8 degrees Celsius for up to 30days. So, there is expectation that both Moderna and Pfizer will file for the FDA emergency use authorization very soon. Both will require 2 shots for the vaccine to be effective almost a month apart. This will also be followed in the next few months with results from AstraZeneca and JNJ so the more vaccines that are available the faster the pandemic will end, but I wouldn\u2019t rush out of the tech names that have brought the market here, they are here to stay even after this all ends. The world didn\u2019t just run into tech companies because of the pandemic, the world was already going there but this was only accelerated by this, and I don\u2019t see companies that don\u2019t need to going back to the way it was, because this has brought better margin profits for many companies as there are fewer expenses with the work from home environment.\n\nSo in my opinion The markets are likely going to keep it up, as I don\u2019t see a crash or a pullback soon as there are a lot more positives then negatives for the stock market. The only negative is that the reopening is not happening yet, but that will come next year, while there are a lot of positives like better treatments, the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines and probably more to come, a probably divided congress which is good news for not many changes that affect the stock market [MARKET GAIN](https://ibb.co/yXB5Mpy), the ultra-low interest rates that are here to stay for a while as the Fed will keep the economy going and a probable stimulus that will come eventually.  [LIQUIDITY](https://ibb.co/6wx3gBz)\n\nThere are a lot of things that drives stocks higher like very good earnings [EARNINGS CHART](https://ibb.co/hXCwZGD) from most of the companies that I really think will continue to be very good and even get better in the next years as more money will be put into the economy by the fed and eventually by the consumers also the companies are starting to pay dividends again and there is a lot of money still on the sidelines that can come back in the stock market. [https://ibb.co/yXB5Mpy](https://ibb.co/yXB5Mpy)\n\nThis year is the second time that ETF\u2019s have had a more than 400 billion dollars of inflow and that will likely keep going up, as investors are leaving low rate bonds and taking on more risk with equities as the US total assets under management are up over 5 Trillion $.  [INTEREST RATES](https://ibb.co/8KCWtqr)\n\nMeanwhile after the close yesterday, it was announced that Tesla will finally be included in the SP500 on the 21st of December this year. This is after the company has had a longer path of profitability with 5 straight quarters of profit even with the pandemic ranging on. This will probably lead to a higher demand for the stock as index funds will need to buy the stock. [CHART](https://ibb.co/9ZL7wJC)\n\nAs you can see people have turned around opinions on the company as the short interest has plummeted from over 200 million shares to below 50 million shores in less than 2 years. That is a decrease of over 70% in just 12 months. [CHART](https://ibb.co/frL3ZGT)\n\nTesla has become the largest ever company to be added to the SP500, and will likely replace one of the bottom companies from the oil industry in the index. The company will have a 1% weight in the SP as the committee estimates the funding for the trade will need over 50 billion dollars, one of the largest in the SP History. The stock traded as much as 525 intra-day before dropping to below 400 after they were not included in the SP500 last go around [CHART](https://ibb.co/m5NxHGB). Even more actively managed funds that try to beat the SP will be forced to decide if they buy Tesla shares or not, as the company may give them a downside risk due to its high potential of growth, such funds manage trillions of dollars that could also pour into the stock. \n\nAnd With factories ramping up like Shanghai which will produce 1million vehicles, Freemont as well, and with Austin and Berlin factories expected to produce at least 500k, they will likely be able to produce over 2 million cars in 2022 or 2023, which is a great increase from around 600thousand/year capacity at the moment. [FACTORIES](https://ibb.co/DWWXWQK)\n\nThe stock has surged after hours more than 13% to around 460$ but I really like the company, and I believe the stock can go higher in the long term especially, I have a price target of just over 600$ for tesla, but we can see a re-test of the 500$ level very soon in the stock, with the EV push that is expected to come in the next years.  [TESLA NEWS](https://ibb.co/yXGxzFb) [TESLA NEWS](https://ibb.co/Qdt07QR)\n\nOne other big thing to follow today after the close is what NIO reports as the company has been targeted by short sellers recently and saw the stock drop from its highs over 50$ to barely 40$ in the span of a couple of days but has since recovered as a lot of people are very optimistic of the earnings report. The company is expected to lose around 17 cents per shares and have a revenue of over 600 million dollars, double the revenue that the company had a year ago. The stock has not beaten the estimates of earnings yet in the last 2 years, so this will be very good if the company finally manages to do that. [NIO](https://ibb.co/1R0bSXm)\n\nAlso, after the close, COSTCO announced a special dividend for shareholders of 10$ as they continue to be one of the greatest companies to own, as management has constantly taken care of shareholders with great dividends and great growth for the company. [NEWS](https://ibb.co/hKbnFpQ)\n\nOne other interesting news came from Nvidia which release a huge product, as the company release a new GPU with more than 80 gigabytes of memory, doubling the old model, this are huge performance numbers that are required in the new world of cloud computing. [NVIDIA NEWS](https://ibb.co/bX60cqv)\n\nThank you everyone for reading! Be sure to leave a comment down below with your opinion on the stock market!\n\nHave a great day and see you next time!",

        "selftext": "Let me start this off by saying I am just an engineer not a finance guy and my only reason to invest in stocks is to secure my future not looking to be a quick millionaire which is why I am posting this question here since the folks here are better at doing all the financial analysis required. \n\nThat being said. Apple recently introduced their M1 chip on their laptops which is based on the ARM architecture, previously they used intel's chips which used x86 architecture. As someone who personally worked with both architecture back in college, i definitely preferred the ARM architecture over x86. All of the bench marks performed on the new Apple chips seem to blow every other laptop out of the water which I believe will be noticed by all the laptop makers. I think more and more laptop makers will start introducing chips based on ARM architecture into their laptops to compete with what Apple is offering, I am sure samsung probably has something in the works. \n\nSo my question is has anyone here ever done any analysis on ARM chips and would they be able to comment on which company most of these laptops would be turning to to buy these ARM based chips? I think ARM was just bought by NVIDIA or may be are in the process of buying? \n\nI think which ever company is on top of this ARM chip manufacturing is going to become very valuable in the next decade. I am just not sure how to find out who that would be. I would love to hear everyones opinion on this.",

        "selftext": "Don't think I've seen too many discussions on here about Apple's new M1 based Macs - maybe i missed them when the M1 was first released.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTech reviewers are unanimously orgasming and drooling over this new ARM based Apple-designed chip because it fucking destroys Intel/AMD chips in both performance, efficiency and cost.\n\nSeriously, as a life long PC Gamer + MacBook Pro user, the stats on these new chips are amazing and I'm genuinely concerned about Intel's future in the consumer segment. How will beefier desktop versions of these chips perform with superior cooling. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe M1 chips are first generation, 'low-end' chipsets which are the first offerings from Apple for it's Mac. I think we will be blown away once again once they release their 'pro' chips for higher end machines (MBP high end, Mac Pro, iMac, etc).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCould licensing this chip technology and design out to PC manufacturers in the future be a viable new vertical for Apple (would this make sense for them to do? It's a solid XX-XXX digit $Billion TAM) Most other PCs can't fully utilize ARM chips because Windows is a POS. Apple is in the unique position to control every aspect of product design so it make sense that they've been able to come out with a laptop generation which is the largest leap in price/performance in recent history.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJust some anecdotal tweets I read\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/56g6n19tzb061.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1cf4e0f6d0e794ce9e1c800a31ad5987e87b1d26\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gvnhc9gv0c061.png?width=596&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f7bd74f8ec1da9a72a0813c9ddcef121213ec67f\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ln7u0mpa1c061.png?width=619&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=465d7fa8926293c426ad533a00dce0a0caf21baa\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSeriously wtf, this chip out performs the top spec Intel chip from last year in REAL WORLD APPLICATIONS to an insane degree. When a sub $1400 M1 MacBook Air can run laps around a $6000 2019 16inch Intel MacBook Pro, you know Intel is truly fucked.\n\nNow in terms of $AAPL, obviously this hasn't affected the stock at all because Macs are now such a small % of their business. I think that the Mac/iPad segment is going to start to see growth once again when the true potential of the new chipset is realized and discovered by the market. Potentially they can start selling these chips to OEMs in a few years time? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso where are all the Windows peasants who spam comments about how Apple hardware is overpriced and doesn't perform as well as similarly priced Windows machines.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLinks:\n\n[https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21574057/apple-m1-chips-laptop-performance-intel-qualcomm-competition](https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21574057/apple-m1-chips-laptop-performance-intel-qualcomm-competition)\n\n[https://www.theverge.com/21570497/apple-macbook-pro-2020-m1-review](https://www.theverge.com/21570497/apple-macbook-pro-2020-m1-review)\n\n[https://www.anandtech.com/tag/apple-m1](https://www.anandtech.com/tag/apple-m1)\n\n[https://9to5mac.com/2020/11/11/macbook-air-with-m1-chip-beats-16-inch-macbook-pro-performance-in-benchmark-test/](https://9to5mac.com/2020/11/11/macbook-air-with-m1-chip-beats-16-inch-macbook-pro-performance-in-benchmark-test/)\n\n[https://twitter.com/twostraws/status/1328704598962565122](https://twitter.com/twostraws/status/1328704598962565122)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPositions: long AF AAPL for life, INTEL AMD NVIDIA WATCHOUT",

        "selftext": "I'm back r/stocks with my plays this week. Last week I closed out half my positions and left a few on the table waiting for them to hit my targets. Since I still have some of my positions open from last week I made my watchlist longer for this week to keep an eye out on plays that become within my level. I've also had a lot of DMs asking for plays that can be used on a smaller account so I've included some tickers that require less capital to sell cash-secured-puts. These are simply positions I might be entering based on my own due diligence and analysis.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**What am I doing?**\n\nI do technical analysis and selling cash-secured-puts 1 to 4 weeks out on stocks that are nearing key levels of support. My goal is to collect premium, but should I get assigned I have absolutely zero problem running the wheel on stocks I want to own. As a backstory I nearly blew up my account doing WSB-style plays in March but have regained all of my account and then some running this strategy since April. What I do now is basically wheeling on weekly puts.\n\nI watch over 200 stocks, I would say its 90% waiting game and 10% true technical analysis. My levels work, but it's normally because I am patiently waiting for an entry point. Yes that's a lot of tickers to watch, but I research my stocks on weekends and then monitor additional plays &amp; levels during the weekday to see if there is an obvious setup I want to participate in.\n\n# Here's a few things regarding my strategy\n\n**1.** I don't over-leverage with spreads because if the stock price blows past your long strike and you assume max loss you need a lot of capital to actually be assigned the shares. For that reason I don't really see selling multiple spreads as a \"Theta Gang\" play and is still very high risk. If I do open a spread it will be a protective put for $1-5 just to protect myself should the company randomly announce bankruptcy.\n\n**2.** I only sell cash-secured puts with the capability to be assigned if need be. My goal is to never take a loss on a position and always wheel it back to profitability. If something has changed fundamentally with the stock then yes I will close the position and realize the loss.\n\n**3.** If IV on a ticker is very low, then yes I will outright buy shares instead.\n\n**4.** I only aim for 1-4% per week collecting on theta and an occasional earnings theta yolo. No call-buying, no spreads, only put-selling and shares!\n\nHonestly, that's about it. I'll go through some tickers on my watchlist this weekend and what I currently have open.\n\n# Open Positions From Last Week\n\n**FB:** 1x 18 Dec, 2020 $260 put sold to open. Up 50% on this option I sold, looking to sell early this week if we get a good pop and close it out at 60-70%.\n\n**MSFT:** Holding 100 shares. Up 1.75% on the position. Stock sitting at $215, my short-term price target is around $218-220 before I look into selling the position.\n\n**NVDA:** 30 shares. Up 0.24% on the position. Looking for $550 here.\n\n**PTON:** 1x 11 Dec 2020 $101 put sold to open. Up 25% here will look to close at around 50-70% profit range.\n\n# Chart Rules\n\n**Pink Lines** = Trading range &amp; channel. I find stocks typically trade within certain channels until an event, such as earnings or some news which changes the fundamentals of the stock price changes the trend and a new channel is formed.\n\n**Blue Lines** = Key areas of support/resistance. I don't like focusing on supp/res levels every $2 down like some people do. I look at the bigger picture and find where where key levels of buyers come in to grab the stock. I'll try to sell puts there.\n\n# Master Plays This Week (Stock price in parenthesis)\n\n**CRM Salesforce ($248) - Earnings theta yolo**\n\n[CRM CHART](https://imgur.com/uTjMgNF)\n\nCRM has been the powerhouse is customer relations management throughout covid. High quality product that is converting more and more businesses into clients. Earnings are coming up this week so premiums will be juicy. The stock has been consolidating in a volatile range for about 2 months now. Uptrend still intact and close to the $240 support level where we will find some buyers. I'll be looking to enter a position here.\n\n**Positions I'm watching:**\n\n**1.** 1x Dec 11 2020, $240 strike put, sold to open for $7.60 or $760 premium. Return: 3% in 2 weeks. \\*I'm selling the 0.33 delta put here. You can go to a lower strike and lower delta, maybe even $235 here and still get decent return.\n\n**2.** Shares with PT to $280.\n\n**TDOC Teladoc ($196)**\n\n[TDOC CHART](https://imgur.com/NC6WSKs)\n\nI entered TDOC a couple weeks ago and made a quick 2-3% return on my play in just 2 or 3 days after the stock price shot up. It's trading a little higher than when I entered my position last time, but still near the bottom of the trend channel (pink lines). I think anything close to $190 is a good entry point. I'll be keeping an on it and look to sell a 0.30 delta put option 4 weeks out if the timing is right.\n\n**Positions I'm watching:**\n\n**1.** 1x Dec 24 2020, $185 strike put, sold to open for $7.00 or $700 premium. Return: 3.7% in 4 weeks.\n\n**2.** Shares with PT to $210-$215\n\n**PTON Peloton ($109)**\n\n[PTON CHART](https://imgur.com/Rl0L7pJ)\n\nI already have a position in PTON open. I sold a put when it was down 6% in a single day last week. I think anywhere sub-$100 level there will be buying pressure to keep it up. When it broke out to $140 it quickly reversed back to the mean stock price and into the channel. Weird how that works ;) Looking at the chart would you buy the stock when it the stock price was going vertically up from $100 to $140? I try to avoid buying on vertical lines unless it's a vertical line down on a stock ticker I like. The trend is still up here even though it has wild swings. Eventually this ticker will lose it's juicy premiums when volatility goes down. I'll try to capture some theta in the mean time.\n\n**Positions I'm watching:**\n\n**1.** 1x Dec 24 2020, $101 strike put, sold to open for $4.45 or $445 premium. Return: 4.4% in 4 weeks.\n\n**2.** Shares with PT back to $120.\n\n**FSLY Fastly ($85)**\n\n[FSLY CHART](https://imgur.com/x0QFpVj)\n\nFSLY also trading in a range approaching that $85 resistance level. It might take off, but if it doesn't I will look to sell a put option around the $78 strike where I think we can find some buyers for the stock. This is another ticker that has volatile swings, but also has been trading steady in a range. Looking at charts like this helps me see where the stock is going and what it is doing. If you look at the daily or intraday you lose sight of these things because it has such wide swings. This will lead you to easily being spooked out of your positions or selling too soon.\n\n**Positions I'm watching:**\n\n**1.** 1x Dec 24 2020, $78 strike put, sold to open for $3.75 or $375 premium. Return: 4.8% in 4 weeks.\n\n**2.** Shares with PT up to $95.\n\n**PRPL Purple Mattress ($30)**\n\n[PRPL CHART](https://imgur.com/ccdQhGV)\n\nPRPL is outside the trend lines and outperforming and also right at the resistance line. Sounds cliche, but the stock will either continue up and outside the range, where I will not touch it, or come back down to the $26-28 range where I will look to sell some puts. IV is still high on this ticker and makes premiums good to sell on. Will need to see where the stock goes this week before any decisions are made.\n\n**Positions I'm watching:**\n\nWaiting for a dip and for the stock price to come back into the channel. Waiting.\n\n**GME Gamestop ($16)**\n\n[GME CHART](https://imgur.com/LjpQ9Ie)\n\nThe possibilities where this stock can go are infinite. Premiums sky high. Strong support at $11 and we have some at the $14 range. If we get another up day of 10% tomorrow I won't touch this stock, otherwise I might sell some puts 4-6 weeks out and try to capitalize on the crazy IV this ticker has. This is a higher risk, higher reward play that I am willing to take. Why? Short interest is sky high. When the stock price increases, shorts will cover their losses which will squeeze the stock higher. If the stock price goes down, we will see some dip buyers and also potentially some shorts closing positions for break-even.\n\n**Positions I'm watching:**\n\n**1.** I will look to sell puts at an appropriate strike when the time comes. If the stock is up 10% Monday I won't chase it.\n\n# Long-term holds I am watching\n\nPLTR (Palantir) and AAPL (Apple Inc). Unfortunately AAPL has terrible premiums so I can't collect any theta on it, but I do like the pricing point going into the holidays. Some of the main tech stocks have been under-performing for some time. I think there is a good opportunity to get some before they begin to take-off again.\n\nI did some research on Palantir stock this weekend and I gotta say I like it. The stock has almost tripled in just a few weeks, but I will be looking to enter some long-term positions in shares if or when the stock dips.",

        "selftext": "**Nvidia delivers another great quarter, is this the time to buy? Apple announces tax cuts for its app store while big retailers like Lowe\u2019s and Target released earnings yesterday, so let\u2019s talk about this and other stock market news**\n\nHey everyone and Welcome, so let\u2019s start with the recap of yesterday as all 3 big indexes finished in the red with the Nasdaq droping 0,8% despite hovering above positive for a good part of the day while both the SP500 and the Dow Jones finished down 1,16% also with a big sell off at the end of the trading. This after the Mayor of New York announced that the city will once again switch schools to online due to them having reached a 3% testing positivity rate on a 7day moving average scale. The volatility index saw a small spike after dropping constantly in the last weeks but is still in a clear downtrend from the highs of November. [DOW CHART](https://ibb.co/4WJNYD3) [SP CHART](https://ibb.co/JWZ1Lpn) [NASDAQ CHART](https://ibb.co/VC4mdyF) [NEW YORK NEWS](https://ibb.co/6Nfbr6Q) [VIX CHART](https://ibb.co/NF8y8jv)\n\nHere is the heat map from yesterday and it\u2019s clear that is though to find and bright spots in the stock market, with small exceptions like TESLA which continue to have great momentum with the SP500 tailwind still pushing the company, while Zoom jumped in the green after the New York news. [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/JQ7cz65)\n\nOver 60% of the companies were declining on below average volume yesterday as there might be some retracements to the 50 and 200-day moving averages as a lot of the stocks are trading quite high above them. Almost all sectors were in the red yesterday with energy and real estate being the most heavily hit by the increasing restrictions also there was no clear outperformer in large cap vs small caps though momentum and growth did a littler better than the value plays. The recent drops and stagnation in the stock market is likely due to investors not knowing what to focus on, as the vaccine news have been a great positive and will help the economy recover in the future but in the meantime the pandemic is raging on and the near term future is uncertain. [CHART](https://ibb.co/fHsqMHt) [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/hDRdM8G) [CHART](https://ibb.co/7tFNCy4)\n\nYesterday we saw some great numbers as the October housing starts were almost 5% better month to month as Today we are going to receive some critical economic data that might see the market recover a little or if they are bad can accelerate the correction as initial jobless claims and continuing jobless claims come in the early part of the morning. [ECONOMIC CALENDAR](https://ibb.co/ZdBVH9m)\n\nAlso, yesterday the American Association of Individual Investors released the weekly investor sentiment survey as bullishness has declined by more than 11% since last week, as investors switch to a more neutral approach. I believe this is a great contrarian indicator as more people become bearish you can find better buying opportunities in the stock market [INVESTOR SENTIMENT](https://ibb.co/7RZK3j4)\n\nSo after the close yesterday Nvidia announced a beat of 36 cents on the expectation with an EPS of 2,91$ which is a more than 1$ improvement since last year and a beat of over 300 million $ on revenue, which have seen a more than 50% increase since last year. Gaming revenues came in even better than expected at 2,27 billion$ while data center revenue also improved more than 160% year over year and also was better than expectations. [NVIDIA REVENUE](https://ibb.co/hcTzGSj) [NVIDIA FINANCIALS](https://ibb.co/SBh3BTY)\n\nGross profit margin decreased year over year but is still better through the first 9 months of the year. With the net income for the company being also in line with these numbers. [NVIDIA EPS](https://ibb.co/wdGD49R)\n\nThey also announced they will give out a dividend, it does have a small yield but it\u2019s better than nothing and also gave guidance for next quarter that was 10% better than forecasted on revenue with the gross margin also expected to improve about 140 basis points. [NVIDIA DIVIDEND](https://ibb.co/tKgC0Qx)\n\nNvidia might get a boost soon as they have just refiled the merger notification for the ARM deal, if they do manage to acquire ARM, this will greatly improve the company\u2019s outlook as it might propel them to join the tech trillion dollar valuation as the global gaming industry has spiked up almost 20% year over year and is expected to have a compound annual growth of almost 10% in the next years. [GAMING INDUSTRY](https://ibb.co/Y73jC3s) [GAMING CAGR](https://ibb.co/K64FsYW) [NVIDIA ARM DEAL](https://ibb.co/5RM0Cvp)\n\nSo I believe they are a great company to invest in for the future and you can buy this dip after the earnings because there was no week point in them, I would buy more of the company if the stock falls under 500$. [NVIDIA PRE-MARKET](https://ibb.co/1ntybNM)\n\nYesterday Apple also announced that they will cut the apple store tax in half to 15% for smaller developers starting next year. Though this impacts 98% of developers in the app store, it will only affect about 5% of the revenue so the impact on the EPS should be pretty small as Morgan Stanley only expects this to be a 3 cents per share down-risk for Apple. This action has been taken by the company to probably divide developers as they continue the legal battle with Epic Games. [APPLE NEWS](https://ibb.co/PMbFv3f) [APPLE IMPACT](https://ibb.co/TqsrSTc)\n\nAlso, two big retailers released earnings yesterday with Target delivering a solid beat of more than a dollar per share and a revenue beat of almost 2 billion $ with comparable sales almost doubling the expectations. They did not provide any guidance but a strong holiday season will likely see the company doing very well in the next quarter. The company saw a huge increase in both traditional store of 10% and a stunning 155% growth in online sales. This came alongside a 80 basis points increase in gross margin as well to top the expectations. This led the stock to gain more than 2% on a day when the stock market was trending down. [TGT DIGITAL SALES](https://ibb.co/Jtp0NV7) [TGT EPS](https://ibb.co/Hxd2NcD)\n\nThe other big retailer that released earnings was Lowe\u2019s as the company just beat the expectations by 2 cents but delivered a better result on revenue while the comparable sales were up more than 30% and the online sales more than doubled for the company. This wasn\u2019t enough for the stock to hold as it saw the price plunge by more than 8% on the day as investors were not impressed by the weak profit guidance for next quarter with an EPS between 1,10$ to 1,20$ versus the expectations of 1,17$. I don\u2019t think was a good indicator for the company\u2019s outlook and could be a great opportunity to buy the stock on the dip. [LOWES STATS](https://ibb.co/WsWrfZV) [LOWES EPS](https://ibb.co/Q6rtWZQ)\n\nA quick though about the Tesla stock being added to the SP doesn\u2019t add any significant value for the company but it is an important milestone as 51 billion $ worth of other SP500 position will be sold so that the company can be added to the  index fund. They are the biggest company ever to be added to the index. Tesla Is not a traditional car company, it\u2019s a disruptive technology company on the EV front, that\u2019s why its valuation is so high compared to other car makers like you can see in this report from Morgan Stanley as they raised the price target by almost 200$ to a price of 540$ for the stock. This is also helped by more and more countries imposing restrictions and announcing bans on traditional fossil fueled cars in the future.   [BRITAIN NEWS](https://ibb.co/CM4PmQ8) [MS Analysts](https://ibb.co/N2b2fdJ)\n\nOther news came yesterday for companies like Shopify which will accept direct payments via Alipay which has more than 1 billion users in China which will improve the payment flow for companies that use the platform. [SHOPIFY NEWS](https://ibb.co/vZSDLNn)\n\nWhile NIO gained target boost from multiple banks like JP Morgan, Bank of America and others as they expect the company to be a long-term winner in the premium EV space and gain a significant market share in the next decade, the stock did fell on the report that Nikola and GM are close to finalizing the deal to manufacture the Nikola Badger as Nikola shares gained more than 15% on the day. [NIO NEWS](https://ibb.co/8XQLG85) [NIKOLA NEWS](https://ibb.co/6gmZqXL)\n\nAlso, the controversial company Palantir secured another US army contract and saw it\u2019s shares rise again to all time highs intra-day, as the company keeps getting the stamp of approval from the government with more and more contracts. [PALANTIR NEWS](https://ibb.co/GMpQWj0)\n\nGoogle also seems to be jumping in the action for more and more online payments solutions as the company will allow users to open bank accounts through Google Pay. The accounts will not be charged monthly fees or require minimum balances which is pretty much in line with the other competitors aproach. [GOOGLE NEWS](https://ibb.co/tPXXmz0)\n\nAnd one final though just like Bill Gates said yesterday, Zoom will continue be a great company to own, as they\u2019re product is superior to competitors, business travel will never go back to what it was, this is happening while a lot of people are taking risks and dumping money in cruise lines stocks and restaurant stocks.

        "selftext": "**What happened last week in the stock market? What are the next interesting earnings reports? Let\u2019s talk about the stock market!**\n\nHey everyone and Welcome so let\u2019s start with the recap of what has happened in the stock market since Monday.\n\nMonday the [DOW](https://ibb.co/ryHzJ3C) rose by more than 1,12% with the broad stock market [SP500](https://ibb.co/PG8CcgX) also gaining more than half a percent while the [NASDAQ](https://ibb.co/Qfwj6QX) was the laggard barely up 0,2% to finish the day while The [VIX](https://ibb.co/SdCNtBZ) had another big drop closing at 22.2. About 70% of the companies were gaining while 80% were trading over 50 and 200-day moving averages. The stock market was lead by the energy sector, which saw a major spike of almost 5% with Financials and Industrials also up more than 1% for the day. The rally was pushed mostly by small and mid-cap value stocks while large-cap growth companies were lagging as you can see in this [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/Kbvv08B) with the biggest company in the world, Apple, dragging down the sector, down almost 3% for the day. [CHART](https://ibb.co/LSxy7Mj) / [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/ZHYXxRW) / [CHART](https://ibb.co/pynTjjH)\n\nReports also came in on Monday that the PS5 and the new xBox have been sold out the moment they are available in stock, as the two gaming consoles are enjoying great demand, this bolds well for the parent companies Sony and Microsoft especially if they can keep up with the demand for this holiday season including Black Friday, holiday [RETAIL SALES](https://ibb.co/J2vDV3F) are forecasted to rise between 3,6 and 5,2%. [XBOX &amp; PS5 NEWS](https://ibb.co/qFMvRz5)\n\nAll this while Europe will start to re-open again after a contraction of the economy due to the latest lockdowns. As they saw the Eurozone PMI falling by almost 4% in October. [EUROZONE NEWS](https://ibb.co/8DFqbd7)\n\nSome good news came from [STORE CAPITAL](https://ibb.co/rHy6pGj) as the rent collections for November remained at 90% with no new tenants requiring deferrals, this suggests that companies are managing to survive even with the current restrictions in place.\n\nWe also saw reports that Janet Yellen will be the next Treasury pick as she would become the first person to be at the top of the FED the White House Council of Economic Advisers and the Treasury and she will become the first woman to lead the Treasury. [TREASURY NEWS](https://ibb.co/bRyZk8G)\n\nMoving on, Tuesday we saw the [DOW](https://ibb.co/K0SW54V) spike more than 1,5%, the [SP500](https://ibb.co/8j7WcXs) rising 1,6% and the [NASDAQ](https://ibb.co/S7D4MJ3) up more than 1,3% in what was a very good day for the stock market with more than 70% of companies advancing and 167 new highs on above average volume. The leaders were once again Energy and Financials, as this 2 sectors, will be two of the fastest benefiting from the end of the pandemic. The rally was continued with value companies leading the way for the 2nd straight day. You can struggle to find red spots in the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/FgNk2rg)  from Tuesday but there were a few in healthcare and real estate. This was the first time that the [DOW](https://ibb.co/C7dYJVD) closed over 30k. [CHART](https://ibb.co/FHmJRYw) / [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/C2WXYW6) / [CHART](https://ibb.co/S5DbTNV)\n\n[NIKOLA](https://ibb.co/M15WTJ4) stock tumbled after the recent rally as the GM deal seems less likely every day, as the deadline for the deal is December 3rd.\n\nWhile October [HOME SEARCHES](https://ibb.co/8PVX9KT) surged over 200% as a Redfin report shows, this leads me to believe that the strong housing demand will keep remaining at this levels for a good period of time. \n\nOn Wednesday we saw the stock market take a breather, as the [DOW](https://ibb.co/0f0Xt8g) lost 0,6%, the [SP500](https://ibb.co/LYdGYSz) lost 0,16% while the pandemic plays regained some momentum with the [NASDAQ](https://ibb.co/37Y7qGX) being up almost half a percent before the stock market closed for Thanksgiving.\n\nAbout 54% of companies were losing ground with below average volume for the day, as Technology and consumer discretionary and staples were the gainers for the day. Value plays did see some normal corrections after the huge gains in the last days as investors were cashing out some money probably before the day off. [CHART](https://ibb.co/pW4g7g4) / [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/ZJxg1MW) / [CHART](https://ibb.co/zhGhJMB)\n\nHere is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/PDyDqBb) from Wednesday as only a couple of companies Like Amazon, Apple, Nvidia and Shopify were gaining, while the energy sector was the biggest laggard.\n\nAlso the AAII investor sentiment [SURVEY](https://ibb.co/CM9RsDQ) from Wednesday showed that people are getting more bearish or bullish as the neutral feeling fell way below the historical average as bullishness remains very high. This is usually a contrarian indicator, as more bullishness gives me reason to take profits and bearishness to invest in the stock market, though I don\u2019t have the same confidence in this as in the past, as I expect this market rally to last until the end of next year.\n\nNews came in from Delta Airlines as pilots approved pay cuts and lower guaranteed hours that could avoid more than 1700 pilots getting cut off. This are great news both for the company and the pilots, as air travel will pick up again in the next years. [DELTA NEWS](https://ibb.co/PmHQMDf)\n\nAlso, Deere reported blowout [EARNINGS](https://ibb.co/z4C2L6S) and a beat of more than 1$ per share and a revenue only 0,6% below last year while also issuing strong 2021 forecasts as they see the equipment sales climbing more than 10% compared to 2020 with a strong net income guidance of 3,6 to 4 billion $ compared to the May guidance of 1,6 to 2 billion $. [4Q 2020](https://ibb.co/FKNjHKs) / [2021](https://ibb.co/PT8GhBW)\n\nWe closed the week on a short day on Friday as the [NASDAQ](https://ibb.co/8PXVwTT) led the way up 0,93%, the [SP500](https://ibb.co/6Pgyrd9) up 0,24% and the [DOW](https://ibb.co/82j8ft0) barely up 0,13%. As we saw about 55% of the companies advancing on way below average volume due to the short day of trading with 85% of companies trading below average volumes. Friday was a pretty divided day as Health Care and Tech lead the way while Utilities and Energy saw a slight pullback after the big gains this week. [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/s3n9Sdb) / [CHART](https://ibb.co/Ldx38vW) / \n\nHere is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/TggK0j5) from Friday as we see that the market was dragged higher by the big tech companies and communication services while the rest of the market was pretty much lagging.\n\nSo for the week, the Nasdaq lead the way up 3% and closed at the 45th record of 2020, the SP followed up 2,3% and closed a 26th record of the year with the DOW also rising 2% in this shortened week. While the [VIX](https://ibb.co/n6M1Z9k) closed the week just below 21, at the lowest level since February.\n\nSo great signs for the recovery of the economy still popped up almost every day, as the stock market is more forward looking than it is a reflection of the current economic conditions. As November will likely be the 7th straight month of job gains, though they will be the fewest in number since the recovery of jobs has begun. [NOVEMBER JOBS](https://ibb.co/ZVMDxtr)\n\nAlso, Bitcoin has seen its price drop from almost all-time highs at 19,5k down more than 3k before bouncing back to around 17k. The cryptocurrency was due for a correction as it had seen a huge rally in since Labor Day and this correction came as news popped of the Treasury attempting to rush out regulation on crypto-wallets. This would be a big negative factor for people who own Bitcoin not for just it\u2019s value but for using it also. But we will have to wait and see as the Treasury boss will be replaced when the Presidency changes. [BITCOIN NEWS](https://ibb.co/FhpVSjC) / [BITCOIN CHART](https://ibb.co/myVqJzN)\n\nSome company news from Friday were that [PALANTIR](https://ibb.co/hDMN8vz) saw it\u2019s stock plunge from all time high of 33,5$ to 27,6$ after Citron tweeted that they are shorting the stock with a 20$ price target. This are common tactics that short sellers use in my opinion to get the fast results they expected. Citron also got into a short position on NIO recently and that news also made the stock take a plunged but that has since recovered and even made new all time highs since.\n\nGreat news came for sports betting companies like DraftKings and Penn national as Canada seems to be going the same way as the US as legalizing sports betting advances more and more. [CANADA NEWS](https://ibb.co/6F20V4W)\n\nAlso, Tesla has seen a huge spike in the last weeks since the SP500 news, and the stock might see another spike as Musk [TWEETED](https://ibb.co/qyLQXRp) that the full self-driving feature will be released wider in the next weeks as the company finally approaches the end of software development as they collect more and more data. Tesla has surpassed Berkshire and is now the 6th largest company in the US as the stock is up more than 600% year to date making Elon Musk the second richest person in the world behind only Bezos. The company will go into the SP500 index at about 80% of its total market value cap as the index only counts the free-floating shares. I believe we won\u2019t see such a big spike in price when the company will be added to the SP in December, just like it happened with the stock split its more of a buy the news sell the event type of thing. As I expected the stock jumped over the previous all time highs and it might see a little correction when the event actually happens, but in the long run this a company that I will continue to own in my portfolio. [TESLA CHART](https://ibb.co/S3w4YVD) / [MUSK WEALTH](https://ibb.co/b6xRMZL) / \n\nNext week we will have some interesting earnings reports that I expect to beat the estimates from companies like [NEXT WEEK EARNINGS](https://ibb.co/6yNcM9m)\n\n[AUTOHOME](https://ibb.co/nQ08V04) which is a company that has great potential as it trades at a low P/E, they offer leads and services for auto consumers in China and they have a very wide consumer base to spread to.\n\nWith [ZOOM](https://ibb.co/br3pPJC) also expecting to report on Monday after the close, I recently just sold out of my position in Zoom. I think there is too much positive expectations for the company as it trade at almost 200 times earnings per shares.\n\nAlso, [Salesforce](https://ibb.co/D5dwYYW) are expected to announce earnings on Tuesday, as the company saw it\u2019s stock tumble after the news of a possible acquiring of Slack. In the long run that will be a very good play for the company as they have continued to buy more and more companies that allows them to keep growing.\n\nOther companies that are reporting and are very interesting to watch are [CrowdStrike](https://ibb.co/X3YBpqN) and [OKTA](https://ibb.co/rGLJtPW) also on Tuesday with [DocuSign](https://ibb.co/vvmSw3p) , [Dollar General](https://ibb.co/23YQzcg), [Marvell](https://ibb.co/nfbYcgG) and Snowflake reporting on Wednesday.\n\nGood news came this Saturday for online retailers as sales jumped more than 20% on Black Friday and are expected to grow between 15 and 35% tomorrow as Cyber Monday may set a new record for online sales.  [RETAIL EXPECTATIONS](https://ibb.co/QFbmcPD)\n\nHere are the most important economic data that we are looking for in the next week as it will be a week full of numbers that may impact how the stock market reacts in the near future. Hopefully we will see an improvement in PMI and a decrease in jobless claims and many more improvments. [NEXT WEEK ECONOMIC DATA](https://ibb.co/DYp3LyP)\n\nThank you everyone for reading!

        "selftext": "So we've all seen what weaponized autism can do to stocks like NIO and Tesla and I'm here to say things are just getting started. The emergence of PLUG and FCEL should be great indicators of the appetite for this sector. Electric energy is the basis for our technology-driven society and with all the blame for pollution landing on FF corps clean energy is the answer (Exxon used to be one of the most valuable companies pre2010 after all). \n\nSo what should you invest in? My argument is not NIO and Tesla. Wait what, that's heresy?! Steady now and hear me out. That's like the equivalent of buying a Ford or GM and subject to tastes, availability, competition, and functionality. I don't know if you've seen recent news on Ford or GM but they are going to bring the heat really soon to these only EV companies. Ford and GM will literally flood the market with availability and the mass production will be extremely difficult for these fresh companies to compete with. The legacy car companies will transform into tech companies with rivaling battery and AI tech. Arguably not as good for maybe a decade but they will throw enough money at the problem to make themselves competitive before 2025. \n\nSo Ford and GM calls then right? Well, I've made out well doing so but that's still a long value-driven play in my opinion. Not to mention all the boomers in these companies that pullout after pennies of profits and stupid amounts of volume makes it rather difficult to move the stocks in meaningful capacities when most make out better in NIO and Tesla. I'd recommend IDRV if you'd like complete exposure to the likes of Tesla, Nio, Ford, GM, and NVDA. But it's still not what the biggest boom in the room over the next 5 years.\n\nInvest in TAN, ICLN, and QCLN. ALL equally good and still undervalued. How are they undervalued after +100% gains since March lows. Well, that's because the true weaponize autist hasn't hit them yet. Who is this Max level autist? It's none other than the US Federal Reserve. I'm not guaranteeing the Green New Deal but you'd be a retard to not see the trend that's happening. A literal energy and power renaissance from FF to Renewables. Governments worldwide are banning non-EV car sales past 2030, pulling funding from gas and oil projects everywhere, banning single-use plastics, and removing the subsidies that are floating FF in the markets currently. Politicians aren't dumb and they follow the money as well and won't be receiving the same level of corrupt payments they have been when the petrodollar was king. Biden will make renewables into the new energy giants and absolutely ass blast the entire sector with a literal money cannon that will force profitability for all involved. So don't invest in just one company that gets a piece of the pie. Invest in the sector with the ICLN, QCLN, and TAN that get the whole pie! Well, the Senate won't let them do that. Mind you over 60% of Repubs are for renewables, and many of them are aware that their reelections could hinge on their decisions on this matter. The Dems literally only need to flip less than a hand full of them to get it done. Big banks are also front running and funding a ton of clean energy projects and stocks while refusing to fund FF anymore. Electricity is the currency, fuel, information, and fun of the future. The time has come to get free energy from the sun, who's with me!\n\nTLDR: buy clean energy etf calls",

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning November 16th, 2020.\n\n# **Tug of war between value and growth stocks may drive the market again in the week ahead  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/13/tug-of-war-between-value-and-growth-stocks-may-drive-the-market-again-in-the-week-ahead.html)**\n*****\n&gt; The stock market is caught between the rapidly spreading virus and the promise of a vaccine.\n*****\n&gt; That is likely to drive trading in the week ahead, as it did in the past week. Investors have been weighing cyclical plays that will do better when the economy reopens fully, against the big tech and growth names that weathered the virus shutdowns in the spring and benefit from the stay-at-home trend.\n*****\n&gt; In the past week, that trade resulted in a mixed performance with the Dow up 4% but the Nasdaq down about 0.5%, as investors sold off technology and communications services stocks. The S&amp;P 500 finished up 2.2% at a record close of 3,585, its first since Sept. 2. The renewed spread of the virus by mid-week had tamped down the exuberance over news from Pfizer Monday that its vaccine has proven highly effective and could be broadly distributed next year.\n*****\n&gt; The election is still uncertain though the market has responded well to the idea that a Democratic president and a mixed Congress will likely result in gridlock. President Donald Trump refuses to concede while his campaign challenges election results. Former Vice President Joe Biden was declared the presumptive president-elect last Saturday and has been moving to organize a cabinet.\n*****\n&gt; # Next hurdle for market\n&gt; \u201cWe largely put the election in the rear view mirror. The next hurdle for this market to contend with will be the path of the virus, and that will be the chief focus. It means a less strident rotation,\u201d said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities. \u201cGrowth has actually outperformed value for the last 17 years. That\u2019s a lot of inertia to break...If this is a pivot point, it\u2019s a long-term pivot point.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; The surging virus is raising renewed concerns about the economy as some cities are likely to put new limits on activities to slow the spread. In the U.S. there were a record 153,400 new cases Thursday.\n*****\n&gt; Besides the virus headlines, investors will be watching economic data, particularly retail sales Tuesday and existing home sales Thursday. There are a flurry of Fed speakers, including Fed Vice Chairman Richard Clarida Monday.\n*****\n&gt; Retailers report earnings in the week ahead with reports from Walmart and Home Depot Tuesday and Target Wednesday. NVIDIA also reports on Wednesday.\n*****\n&gt; The Pfizer news and the election outcome combined to unleash a new wave of bullishness early in the past week. Goldman Sachs, for instance, put a target of 4,200 on the S&amp;P 500 for 2021, and JPMorgan said the benchmark could rise to as high as 4,500 next year.\n*****\n&gt; # Value vs growth\n&gt; Hogan said the value play trend had actually been underway before the Pfizer news and is what helped take the Russell 2000 to close at a new high for the first time Friday since August, 2018.\n*****\n&gt; Small caps in the Russell 2000 have been outperforming for the past three months. Since Oct. 1, the Russell is up 15.5%, compared to just under 6.6% gain for the S&amp;P 500. In the past week, the Russell was the best performer, up 6% for the week on Friday, compared to the 2.2% gain in the S&amp;P 500.\n*****\n&gt; In the past week, energy stocks surged 16.5%,and airlines were up 10.5%, The S&amp;P financial sector was up 8.2%, with commercial banks gaining 11.2%. At the same time, information technology declined 0.4% and consumer discretionary stocks were down 1.1%. Communications services was among the weak performers, up just 0.8%\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think it\u2019s just a constant tug of war...based on what we see with the virus headlines and such. I think that\u2019s driving a lot,\u201d said Paul Hickey, co-founder of Bespoke Investment Group. \u201cWhen you get the bad headlines, you start seeing the growth stocks do well. When you get the good headlines, you start seeing the value stocks doing better.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Hickey expects to continue seeing vaccine developments from other manufacturers. \u201cSome of these high-flying Covid stocks are going to get hit as the headlines get better. We\u2019ve been rotating out of the large cap tech stocks, but we don\u2019t think they\u2019re necessarily going to go down, so to speak,\u201d he said. \u201cWe just think there\u2019s better opportunity in some of the more cyclical parts of the market. It\u2019s more a function of underperformance than decline.\u201d\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/9S768Dt.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/5lit5Af.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/iKz3nnz.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/o6eSwEM.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/a6mAWdZ.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/HTDyGOz.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/CkiRCt8.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Tiesuhz.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/iH1ju0y.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/MpPXu3M.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/HGFYBcG.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/1QuKIAi.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # A Very Good Ten\n\n&gt; With nearly ten trading days under its belt for November, the S&amp;P 500 is putting together quite a month. Through early morning Friday, the S&amp;P 500 was up just over 9% which ranks as the best first ten trading days for a month since January 1987. In the entire history of the S&amp;P, there have only been 17 other months where the S&amp;P 500 was up over 9% in the first ten trading days of the month, and in the post-WWII period, there have only been five.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/111320-First-Ten-Days-Copy.png))**\n\n&gt; So, when a month starts off strong, does it usually finish that way? Or is there some sort of reversion to the mean? Unfortunately, prior experience isn't particularly consistent in one direction of the other. The table below shows each month since 1928 where the S&amp;P 500 was up at least 7.5% in the first ten trading days of a month. Overall, the S&amp;P 500's average rest of month performance has been a gain of 0.96%. That sounds good, but on a median basis, the rest of the month typically sees a decline of 0.2% with positive returns less than half of the time.\n\n&gt; In looking at the chart above and the table below, you'll notice that most of the strong starts for the S&amp;P came during the Depression in the pre-WWII period. In 1932 and 1933, for example, there were five occurrences each year! Looking at the post-WWII period where the frequency of occurrences wasn't nearly as common, strong starts to a month typically saw a more positive but still not a very consistent trend. In the ten prior months since the end of WWII, the S&amp;P 500's average rest of month performance was a gain of 1.27% (median: 1.69%) with gains 60% of the time.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/111320-First-Ten-Days-Rest-of-Month.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # November Expiration Week: S&amp;P 500 &amp; DJIA Stronger\n\n&gt; DJIA has been up 11 of the last 16 years on Monday of expiration week and Friday is up 14 of the last 18 years with an average gain of 0.56%. By the way, it is not a mistake that November Op-Ex day has the same point change and percent change in 2014 and 2015. It was triple checked and its correct. If you go out 2 more decimal places in the percentage calculation, it\u2019s different.\n\n&gt; S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ and Russell 2000 have not been as bullish as DJIA around or on November option expiration. S&amp;P 500 has advanced only 17 times during options expiration week while NASDAQ and Russell 2000 have climbed only 16 and 14 times respectively over the past 26 years. All four indices have posted average losses on Monday and aside from DJIA and S&amp;P 500 have been essentially mixed on options expiration day. Friday\u2019s solid average gains across the board are largely due to a sizable gain in 2008. Any weakness next week could be a good entry point for new longs ahead of the historically bullish Thanksgiving holiday.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/13265e8eff0782bd041e1e0a067dc3fe/7883f89830a49be6-29/s500x750/2885f1dc67e4228626741cb7343d992817ec5583.jpg))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/d6a7fb10dbb1b8380672d5944d48644f/7883f89830a49be6-b5/s500x750/39e1a2f390dbf489cf5bb9ea3384c0d5807cfc51.jpg))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/9201ade7e11162142381783f8156173b/7883f89830a49be6-c5/s500x750/b4b5afb73ee7a109663d4019f6cbfa31a7c5aa1e.jpg))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/61cf940fbf5dad46c8daa54942793f48/7883f89830a49be6-32/s500x750/7cedc50f07edc9418f507d890a648ad42db916ef.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Week before Thanksgiving DJIA Up 19 of 27, But\u2026\n\n&gt; DJIA has a solid track record over the last 27 years, rising 19 times the week before Thanksgiving with a median gain of 0.46%. But the other major U.S. stock market benchmarks are not as strong and there has been more weakness across the board recently. Since 2003 DJIA is up only 9 out of the last 17 years with a median gain of 0.10%.\n\n&gt; S&amp;P is up 16 of the last 27 years with a median gain of 0.35% and down 9 of the last 17, \u20130.13% median loss. NASDAQ is up 15 of the last 27 years with a median gain of 0.33% and down 9 of the last 17, \u20130.004% median loss. Russell 200 is up 14 of the last 27 years with a median gain of 0.36% and down 10 of the last 17, \u20130.27% median loss.\n\n&gt; This sets up well for the Thanksgiving trade of buying into weakness the week before Thanksgiving and selling into strength around the holiday and typical November end-of-month strength.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/b30ef3831a0d9fba86495cdc148b2c22/83c3c7d6350c9827-a4/s540x810/ae0bba2b8a4208ad3cd1434bfd8aab7932046617.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # New High in New 52 Week Highs\n\n&gt; As equities and other risk assets surge, a massive number of S&amp;P 500 stocks are hitting new 52 week highs today. As shown in the chart below, as of midday 27.92% of S&amp;P 500 stocks have reached new 52 week highs today and just one stock, Biogen (BIIB), is reaching a new 52 week low. The net reading of 27.72% is the highest reading for net new highs since January of 2018. Prior to that, you would need to go all the way back to May 22nd of 2013 to find the last time there was such a high reading.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/110920-Net-New-Highs-2.png))**\n\n&gt; Looking at the best-performing stocks in the index today, the list is mostly comprised of the stocks that have been extremely beaten down in the COVID economy like energy, travel, and retail/retail real estate names. Despite this, some still find themselves as some of those furthest below their 52-week highs. Take for example Carnival Cruiselines (CCL). The stock is seeing a phenomenal 35% gain just in today's session, but even at today's highs it was still well over 60% below its high for the year. It is a similar story for CCL's peer, Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings (NCLH) which is up 27.78% but was 61.4% from its highs at its best price today. On the other hand, there are 28 stocks that have come within 1% of their 52-week highs at their high prices today. Another 80 stocks have come within 5% of their 52-week highs at their intraday highs today.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/110920-Distance-from-52-week.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Big Milestone For Small Stocks\n\n&gt; No US equity index has reacted more strongly since Election Day than the Russell 2000 small-cap index. As shown in the chart below, the index finally broke out above its highs from earlier in the year following Monday's positive vaccine news. After that move on Monday, the Russell 2000 was up over 10% in just the last six trading days.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/1110-RTY.png))**\n\n&gt; In just about any other year besides 2020, a 10%+ move in the Russell 2000 would be an extraordinary move, but this year the most recent move is actually the sixth one of at least that much. In fact, coming out of the March lows, the Russell saw three six-day moves of 19.1%, 16.3%, and 14.8%, respectively. The frequency with which we've seen these 10%+ moves in the Russell 2000 over a six-day period has been unlike any other year in the Russell's history. Behind 2020, the year with the next highest total of 10%+ moves was 2011 (4) and then 2008 (3), and the most there has been in any twelve-month rolling basis is five spanning late 2008 through the first half of 2009.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/111020-Russell-2000-Six-Days.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 3 Election Charts That Caught Our Attention\n\n&gt; Stocks just had their best week since April, with the S&amp;P 500 Index incredibly a chip shot away from new all-time highs. Joe Biden will be the next President of the United States, but markets are confident Republicans will maintain the Senate, and this means gridlock in Washington. Remember, gridlock is good, as it pulls policy towards compromise and avoids extremes. Also, any legislative changes to taxes, regulation, and capital gains will have meaningful input from both parties.\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, a split Congress tends to mean stronger stock returns, almost ignoring whether a Democrat or Republican is in the White House. The most likely outcome from the election at this point is a Democratic president with a divided Congress\u2014a scenario that historically has produced solid S&amp;P 500 returns of 15.9% a year.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/11.9.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Assuming President-elect Joe Biden takes over in January 2021, it is important to note that historically stocks haven\u2019t done as well the first and second years of a new president compared with an incumbent winning. This makes sense though, as historically voters may have chosen new leadership in part because of economic weakness, and the uncertainty of a new president\u2019s policies could also hold things back some. If things are good, the president tends to win reelection. Things turn around significantly by the third year in office, though, if there\u2019s new leadership. Of course, it\u2019s worth noting that the first year of a new president has seen the S&amp;P 500 higher recently, with stocks up nearly 20% the first year under President Donald Trump (2017) and 23% under President Barack Obama (2009).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/11.9.20-Blog-Chart-2-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Lastly, the strength from stocks around the election has been rather historic. \u201cThe S&amp;P 500 added 1% on four consecutive days, which hasn\u2019t happened since late 1982,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cAlthough there are only three other times this rare blast of strength happened since WWII, it is worth noting that strong returns going out a year took place after each instance.\u201d The bottom line: Extreme buying pressure has a funny way of resolving higher, and we don\u2019t anticipate this time being any different.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/11.9.20-Blog-Chart-3.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 3 The Biggest Winners Are Still Big Losers\n\n&gt; With household names like Carnival (CCL), Wynn Resorts (WYNN), Simon Property (SPG), and Royal Caribbean (RCL) all up over 20% today, more than a few people out there are probably kicking themselves for not owning any of them. But before you start ripping your hair out, keep in mind that just about all of these stocks are down (and in a big way) on the year. Of the 33 stocks in the S&amp;P 500 that are up over 20% following today\u2019s vaccine news, all but one of them are still down year to date. The only exception is Expedia (EXPE), which even after a 20%+ gain is still up just 18% on the year.\n\n&gt; In terms of sector representation, Energy tops the list with more than a third of the names (12) on the list. Behind Energy, Real Estate (8), Consumer Discretionary (6), and Financials (6) are the only other sectors with multiple stocks listed.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/110920-Best-Stocks-1109.png))**\n\n&gt; Just as the best-performing stocks are all still underperforming the S&amp;P 500 on a year to date basis, the biggest losers today are among the year\u2019s biggest winners. There are 25 stocks in the S&amp;P 500 that were down on the day as of the middle of the afternoon, but the only one that is down on the year is Biogen (BIIB), a stock whose decline has nothing to do with the vaccine news. Including BIIB, the 25 biggest losers are still up an average of 41% YTD (median: 31%). Behind BIIB, the two worst-performing stocks in the S&amp;P 500 today are Pool (POOL) and Etsy (ETSY). Both stocks are down over 10% on the day, but for the year are still holding onto gains of 56.4% and 190.5%, respectively.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/110920-Worst-Stocks-1109-1.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Policy Uncertainty Spiked Into the Election\n\n&gt; For the month of October, the NFIB's reading on small business sentiment was unchanged at the headline levels but many of the sub-indices broadly pointed to further improvements in business conditions. That is not to say small businesses do not have their share of concerns. As shown in the chart below, the NFIB's index on Economic Policy Uncertainty rose another 4 points in October to 98 which is the second-highest reading on record behind November of 2016; around the time of the last presidential election.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/111020-NFIB-Uncert2.png))**\n\n&gt; The election played a role in the uncertainty as 31% of small businesses surveyed reported government-related concerns as their biggest problem in October (lower chart). That was up for the second month in a row and is around the high end of the past couple of year's range. Additionally, as discussed earlier, labor also dominates the minds of small businesses as small businesses report struggles in filling roles. 30% reported cost or quality of labor as the single most important problem (top chart). That is unchanged since August.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/111020-NFIB-Problem-govt-labor.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Big Tech Fades and Small Caps Soar\n\n&gt; Pfizer\u2019s announcement that its vaccine for covid-19 appears to be 90% effective on Monday morning also gave new life to small-cap stocks, many of which have struggled throughout the pandemic. The announcement has also triggered an exodus from mega-cap tech stocks that had been the \u201cgo-to\u201d positions throughout most of the pandemic.\n\n&gt; The chart above is based upon a similar chart from page 112 of the Stock Trader\u2019s Almanac 2020. It shows the typical one-year seasonal pattern of the ratio of the Russell 2000 to the Russell 1000 from July through June (scale on right). Overlaid on top of this pattern is the performance of this ratio in 2020 so far through today\u2019s close (left scale). When the ratio is declining, large-cap stocks are outperforming small cap stocks. When the ratio is climbing, small caps are outperforming. In a typical year, small-caps will lag until around late-September or early October and then take off right around mid-December.\n\n&gt; Covid-19 related shutdowns and unemployment had kept small caps essentially sidelined this year. There were bouts of strength in late-July to mid-August and a brief surge in mid-September and again in early October. The recent surge higher could be an early start to the major move higher that typically begins around mid-December.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/86b0c38fda06a991b0dff788e125ad8d/b50bde8b92d0b3a1-5b/s500x750/7dbabf47c90b7da6961e2d23f94a9abb1e8d4287.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/iH1ju0y.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/ntRgt4A.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 11.16.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/BPYsDg8.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 11.16.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/Q0M8ILC.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday  11.17.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/NoHPXKo.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 11.17.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/EqCY7lq.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 11.18.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/lw83hhF.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 11.18.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/FFUyg9w.png))\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 11.19.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/R78y9vB.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 11.19.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/bKdqcYL.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 11.20.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Fff0sUp.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 11.20.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # NIO Inc. $44.56\n**NIO Inc.

        "selftext": "(((I wanted to post this yesterday, which is the best day to buy, but forgot about it. Still is a very good option to buy if you ever see a dip (doubt it))))\n\nHello wsber, how're you doing to day? Are you all looking for a play that has huge upside potential with very little down side risk, does that ring a bell?\nReason for the post today is something just came across my deck. It's perhaps the best thing I've seen in the last 6 month. Do you have 60 seconds for me to share the idea with you, do you have a minute?\n\nName of the company, Ebay, it's is a low cutting e-commerce company that has really high margin profits compare to its competition. The stock now at 49, down from ATH at 61 several months ago. It's average price target is 55$. Its PE is 6.7 compare to Etsy's ~71, while they basically having similar bussiness model, make the stock really undervalued.\n   In addition, the next month gonna be the best month of Ebay as the world go back into lockdown. Online sale will soar back, especially electronic sale. This is where everything Ebay favor due to the new Xbox, PS5, Nvidia new card, AMD cards and chips. They are all in shortage due to scalpers making big money reselling them on ebay. This shortage will last long and each of them sold will get ebay the juicy 10%.\n\n\n\n\nPosition: 55c or 60c(yolo+ dirt cheap) exp 01/15/2021 or \n02/2021. The 55c will be the safest 100% profit option that you have ever buy. The only problem is that you didn't buy more.",

        "selftext": "Hi, I'm new to this sub-reddit. \n\nI've started to cash out of investments more than usual after hitting 3 million with about 60% in blue chip tech like Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, etc. another 5% in speculative stocks, and the rest in Vanguard broad market ETFs like VTI and VOO.  \n\nMost of my daily expenses are covered by my real estate properties though I have been taking out anywhere from 50-80k per year for home improvements, vacations, etc. \n\nI'm seeing less rental income revenue this year due to covid rental moratoriums. It's not the fault of the tenants to lose their jobs, but it puts me in an awkward position. \n\nHow much cash should I hold for emergencies and also investing if the stock market tanks? I never really held much cash and sold as I needed to maximize my investments. Currently I'm holding about 200k, but I'll probably use 70k of that within the next 365 days. \n\nBy the way, I'm 35 years old, do business &amp; tech consulting for work, and going to get married soon so I want to make the best choice. \n\nI'm also happy with my current income stream, but want to do things smart. My investment strategy leans more conservative. \n\nAny advice would be helpful, thanks!",

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, November 2, 2020**\n\nStocks opened today\u2019s session higher before paring some gains ahead of an extremely busy week, with market participants closely monitoring the results of the US presidential election, a meeting of the Federal Reserve, and the October jobs report, and rising coronavirus numbers in the US and Europe.\n\nAfter an extremely choppy day, the Nasdaq (QQQ) finished 0.22% up, the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) finished 1.11% up, and the Dow Jones (DIA) performed the best, finishing 1.56% up.\n\nOn Tuesday is the US presidential election between incumbent Donald Trump and Democrat Joe Biden. Needless to say, given the political divide, the coronavirus pandemic, and social unrest that exists in the United States right now, the outcome of this election will be extremely significant. According to a study done by Edward Jones, since 1932, the stock market has dipped 64% percent of the time the day after a presidential election. This likely reflects anxiety about the future if a large cohort of the population is unhappy with the election result. Regardless of the election result,  it's likely a large section of the population will be unhappy. Moreover, given the surge of early and mail-in ballots due to the pandemic, the possibility exists that the outcome may not be clear after Tuesday. This scenario would certainly cause a massive spike in volatility and uncertainty in the markets. According to the US Elections Project at the University of Florida, as of Friday of last week, around 85 million individuals have cast their ballots, over half of the total turnout in 2016. If this pace picks up, this election could have the highest voter participation rate in over 100 years.\n\nRegardless of the outcome, the election will have a number of consequences for Corporate America. For example, a change in the political control in either the Senate or the White House (which are Republican-controlled right now) could potentially alter corporate tax rates, increase or decrease regulation in some industries, affect trade relations with other countries, and changes in capital gains tax, which is important for market participants. Moreover, the outcome of the election will likely influence the timing and size of much-needed additional fiscal stimulus \n\nThe Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is set to hold the first of its two-day rate-setting meeting the day after Election Day, with the twelve FOMC meeting Wednesday and monetary policy statement and press conference from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Thursday. Going off previous meetings, the Fed is virtually guaranteed to keep interest rates, near zero. After their last meeting in September, the Fed signaled that it would maintain interest rates are current levels until \u201cat least 2023\u201d. Throughout these meetings, FOMC members, including Powell, have increasingly escalated their calls for further fiscal stimulus to complement the Fed\u2019s monetary support. In early October, Powell said, \u201ctoo little support would lead to a weak recovery, creating unnecessary hardships for households and businesses.\u201d\n\nOn Friday, the Department of Labor is set to release the October job report, a crucial piece of data to understand the state of the labor market and gauge the pace of recovery. According to Bloomberg consensus data, non-farm payrolls are expected to increase by around 600,000. While this estimate would the sixth month of net payroll gains, it would also be the four, straight month of deceleration, indicating the pace of recovery is slowing. The unemployment rate is also predicted to tick lower, from 7.9% to 7.6%. However, worryingly, there appears to be a trend towards long-term unemployment for many Americans. The number of individuals filing continuing claims, people filing for unemployment benefits who have already filed an initial claim, has continued to increase the past several weeks. This means that people who lost their job due to the pandemic are having an increasing harder time finding new employment quickly.\n\nThe US just set a new record for the highest seven-day average of daily new cases: 81,336 as of Sunday. That's the first time the number has ever topped 80,000, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. new cases are far exceeding new testing. Over the past week, new cases have increased 18%, according to Johns Hopkins. But the number of new tests performed has increased only 4.29%, according to the Covid Tracking Project. \n\nLast week, Europe recorded around 1.5 million new cases of coronavirus, a new record, according to data from Johns Hopkins. Trends are worrying across the continent now, including in countries such as Greece and the Czech Republic, where infection rates had been low until recently. Measures are tightening up everywhere. England, in response to the surge, announced a nationwide lockdown for at least the next four weeks.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Apple (AAPL) announced on Monday an event for Nov. 10 where it\u2019s expected to announce new Macs that are powered by their own chips powered by ARM processors, instead of the Intel chips it had been using. Could impact Nvidia (NVDA) stock, which owns ARM chips, and Intel, who has not been doing very well lately, judging from last earnings report and stock price action (INTC).\n* Images for the updated Tesla Cybertruck could come next Musk, according to CEO Elon Musk.\n* Chinese electric vehicle maker NIO announced its October deliveries, and the number has shares on the move, again. NIO delivered 5,055 vehicles in October, doubling from a year ago. The result is doubly impressive because NIO very recently raised its manufacturing capacity to 5,000 vehicles a month. The company is selling all the cars it can make. This stock is an absolute monster and is one we love at PsychoTrader!\n* Alibaba (BABA), is doubling its Singles\u2019 Day offerings this year, running the massive online sales event across two periods rather than one. Alibaba says it expanded the shopping window for Singles\u2019 Day to provide more relief for merchants that have been hit hard by the pandemic. Single\u2019s day is a counter to Valentine\u2019s Day that celebrates being single. Normally it\u2019s held on Nov 11. This is the world\u2019s largest shopping festival. According to Fortune Magazine, BABA shipped $38.4 billion in gross merchandise value on Singles\u2019 Day last year. Amazon\u2019s Prime Day, by comparison, sold around $6 billion in goods last year.\n* Asian shares were mostly higher on Monday buoyed by further signs of recovery in China's manufacturing sector. The Caixin manufacturing PMI, a major indicator for China's manufacturing sector, rose in October, showing that domestic demand is holding up, reports said over the weekend.\n* Allegiant Travel (ALGT) upgraded by Morgan Stanley (MS) to $175 OVERWEIGHT. Stock currently around $131\n* Alibaba (BABA) target raised by Keycorp from $330 to $350 OVERWEIGHT. Stock currently around $310\n* ChampionX (CHX) target raised by Barclays from $16 to $19 OUTPERFORM.

Given that, I\u2019ve put 70% of my portfolio into AMD stock and calls which i\u2019ve picked up during the election dip.

        "selftext": "Good Saturday afternoon to all of you here on r/wallstreetbets. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning November 16th, 2020.\n\n# **Tug of war between value and growth stocks may drive the market again in the week ahead  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/13/tug-of-war-between-value-and-growth-stocks-may-drive-the-market-again-in-the-week-ahead.html)**\n*****\n&gt; The stock market is caught between the rapidly spreading virus and the promise of a vaccine.\n*****\n&gt; That is likely to drive trading in the week ahead, as it did in the past week. Investors have been weighing cyclical plays that will do better when the economy reopens fully, against the big tech and growth names that weathered the virus shutdowns in the spring and benefit from the stay-at-home trend.\n*****\n&gt; In the past week, that trade resulted in a mixed performance with the Dow up 4% but the Nasdaq down about 0.5%, as investors sold off technology and communications services stocks. The S&amp;P 500 finished up 2.2% at a record close of 3,585, its first since Sept. 2. The renewed spread of the virus by mid-week had tamped down the exuberance over news from Pfizer Monday that its vaccine has proven highly effective and could be broadly distributed next year.\n*****\n&gt; The election is still uncertain though the market has responded well to the idea that a Democratic president and a mixed Congress will likely result in gridlock. President Donald Trump refuses to concede while his campaign challenges election results. Former Vice President Joe Biden was declared the presumptive president-elect last Saturday and has been moving to organize a cabinet.\n*****\n&gt; # Next hurdle for market\n&gt; \u201cWe largely put the election in the rear view mirror. The next hurdle for this market to contend with will be the path of the virus, and that will be the chief focus. It means a less strident rotation,\u201d said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities. \u201cGrowth has actually outperformed value for the last 17 years. That\u2019s a lot of inertia to break...If this is a pivot point, it\u2019s a long-term pivot point.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; The surging virus is raising renewed concerns about the economy as some cities are likely to put new limits on activities to slow the spread. In the U.S. there were a record 153,400 new cases Thursday.\n*****\n&gt; Besides the virus headlines, investors will be watching economic data, particularly retail sales Tuesday and existing home sales Thursday. There are a flurry of Fed speakers, including Fed Vice Chairman Richard Clarida Monday.\n*****\n&gt; Retailers report earnings in the week ahead with reports from Walmart and Home Depot Tuesday and Target Wednesday. NVIDIA also reports on Wednesday.\n*****\n&gt; The Pfizer news and the election outcome combined to unleash a new wave of bullishness early in the past week. Goldman Sachs, for instance, put a target of 4,200 on the S&amp;P 500 for 2021, and JPMorgan said the benchmark could rise to as high as 4,500 next year.\n*****\n&gt; # Value vs growth\n&gt; Hogan said the value play trend had actually been underway before the Pfizer news and is what helped take the Russell 2000 to close at a new high for the first time Friday since August, 2018.\n*****\n&gt; Small caps in the Russell 2000 have been outperforming for the past three months. Since Oct. 1, the Russell is up 15.5%, compared to just under 6.6% gain for the S&amp;P 500. In the past week, the Russell was the best performer, up 6% for the week on Friday, compared to the 2.2% gain in the S&amp;P 500.\n*****\n&gt; In the past week, energy stocks surged 16.5%,and airlines were up 10.5%, The S&amp;P financial sector was up 8.2%, with commercial banks gaining 11.2%. At the same time, information technology declined 0.4% and consumer discretionary stocks were down 1.1%. Communications services was among the weak performers, up just 0.8%\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think it\u2019s just a constant tug of war...based on what we see with the virus headlines and such. I think that\u2019s driving a lot,\u201d said Paul Hickey, co-founder of Bespoke Investment Group. \u201cWhen you get the bad headlines, you start seeing the growth stocks do well. When you get the good headlines, you start seeing the value stocks doing better.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Hickey expects to continue seeing vaccine developments from other manufacturers. \u201cSome of these high-flying Covid stocks are going to get hit as the headlines get better. We\u2019ve been rotating out of the large cap tech stocks, but we don\u2019t think they\u2019re necessarily going to go down, so to speak,\u201d he said. \u201cWe just think there\u2019s better opportunity in some of the more cyclical parts of the market. It\u2019s more a function of underperformance than decline.\u201d\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/9S768Dt.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/5lit5Af.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/iKz3nnz.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/o6eSwEM.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/a6mAWdZ.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/HTDyGOz.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/CkiRCt8.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Tiesuhz.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/iH1ju0y.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/MpPXu3M.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/HGFYBcG.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/1QuKIAi.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # A Very Good Ten\n\n&gt; With nearly ten trading days under its belt for November, the S&amp;P 500 is putting together quite a month. Through early morning Friday, the S&amp;P 500 was up just over 9% which ranks as the best first ten trading days for a month since January 1987. In the entire history of the S&amp;P, there have only been 17 other months where the S&amp;P 500 was up over 9% in the first ten trading days of the month, and in the post-WWII period, there have only been five.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/111320-First-Ten-Days-Copy.png))**\n\n&gt; So, when a month starts off strong, does it usually finish that way? Or is there some sort of reversion to the mean? Unfortunately, prior experience isn't particularly consistent in one direction of the other. The table below shows each month since 1928 where the S&amp;P 500 was up at least 7.5% in the first ten trading days of a month. Overall, the S&amp;P 500's average rest of month performance has been a gain of 0.96%. That sounds good, but on a median basis, the rest of the month typically sees a decline of 0.2% with positive returns less than half of the time.\n\n&gt; In looking at the chart above and the table below, you'll notice that most of the strong starts for the S&amp;P came during the Depression in the pre-WWII period. In 1932 and 1933, for example, there were five occurrences each year! Looking at the post-WWII period where the frequency of occurrences wasn't nearly as common, strong starts to a month typically saw a more positive but still not a very consistent trend. In the ten prior months since the end of WWII, the S&amp;P 500's average rest of month performance was a gain of 1.27% (median: 1.69%) with gains 60% of the time.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/111320-First-Ten-Days-Rest-of-Month.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # November Expiration Week: S&amp;P 500 &amp; DJIA Stronger\n\n&gt; DJIA has been up 11 of the last 16 years on Monday of expiration week and Friday is up 14 of the last 18 years with an average gain of 0.56%. By the way, it is not a mistake that November Op-Ex day has the same point change and percent change in 2014 and 2015. It was triple checked and its correct. If you go out 2 more decimal places in the percentage calculation, it\u2019s different.\n\n&gt; S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ and Russell 2000 have not been as bullish as DJIA around or on November option expiration. S&amp;P 500 has advanced only 17 times during options expiration week while NASDAQ and Russell 2000 have climbed only 16 and 14 times respectively over the past 26 years. All four indices have posted average losses on Monday and aside from DJIA and S&amp;P 500 have been essentially mixed on options expiration day. Friday\u2019s solid average gains across the board are largely due to a sizable gain in 2008. Any weakness next week could be a good entry point for new longs ahead of the historically bullish Thanksgiving holiday.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/13265e8eff0782bd041e1e0a067dc3fe/7883f89830a49be6-29/s500x750/2885f1dc67e4228626741cb7343d992817ec5583.jpg))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/d6a7fb10dbb1b8380672d5944d48644f/7883f89830a49be6-b5/s500x750/39e1a2f390dbf489cf5bb9ea3384c0d5807cfc51.jpg))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/9201ade7e11162142381783f8156173b/7883f89830a49be6-c5/s500x750/b4b5afb73ee7a109663d4019f6cbfa31a7c5aa1e.jpg))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/61cf940fbf5dad46c8daa54942793f48/7883f89830a49be6-32/s500x750/7cedc50f07edc9418f507d890a648ad42db916ef.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Week before Thanksgiving DJIA Up 19 of 27, But\u2026\n\n&gt; DJIA has a solid track record over the last 27 years, rising 19 times the week before Thanksgiving with a median gain of 0.46%. But the other major U.S. stock market benchmarks are not as strong and there has been more weakness across the board recently. Since 2003 DJIA is up only 9 out of the last 17 years with a median gain of 0.10%.\n\n&gt; S&amp;P is up 16 of the last 27 years with a median gain of 0.35% and down 9 of the last 17, \u20130.13% median loss. NASDAQ is up 15 of the last 27 years with a median gain of 0.33% and down 9 of the last 17, \u20130.004% median loss. Russell 200 is up 14 of the last 27 years with a median gain of 0.36% and down 10 of the last 17, \u20130.27% median loss.\n\n&gt; This sets up well for the Thanksgiving trade of buying into weakness the week before Thanksgiving and selling into strength around the holiday and typical November end-of-month strength.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/b30ef3831a0d9fba86495cdc148b2c22/83c3c7d6350c9827-a4/s540x810/ae0bba2b8a4208ad3cd1434bfd8aab7932046617.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # New High in New 52 Week Highs\n\n&gt; As equities and other risk assets surge, a massive number of S&amp;P 500 stocks are hitting new 52 week highs today. As shown in the chart below, as of midday 27.92% of S&amp;P 500 stocks have reached new 52 week highs today and just one stock, Biogen (BIIB), is reaching a new 52 week low. The net reading of 27.72% is the highest reading for net new highs since January of 2018. Prior to that, you would need to go all the way back to May 22nd of 2013 to find the last time there was such a high reading.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/110920-Net-New-Highs-2.png))**\n\n&gt; Looking at the best-performing stocks in the index today, the list is mostly comprised of the stocks that have been extremely beaten down in the COVID economy like energy, travel, and retail/retail real estate names. Despite this, some still find themselves as some of those furthest below their 52-week highs. Take for example Carnival Cruiselines (CCL). The stock is seeing a phenomenal 35% gain just in today's session, but even at today's highs it was still well over 60% below its high for the year. It is a similar story for CCL's peer, Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings (NCLH) which is up 27.78% but was 61.4% from its highs at its best price today. On the other hand, there are 28 stocks that have come within 1% of their 52-week highs at their high prices today. Another 80 stocks have come within 5% of their 52-week highs at their intraday highs today.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/110920-Distance-from-52-week.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Big Milestone For Small Stocks\n\n&gt; No US equity index has reacted more strongly since Election Day than the Russell 2000 small-cap index. As shown in the chart below, the index finally broke out above its highs from earlier in the year following Monday's positive vaccine news. After that move on Monday, the Russell 2000 was up over 10% in just the last six trading days.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/1110-RTY.png))**\n\n&gt; In just about any other year besides 2020, a 10%+ move in the Russell 2000 would be an extraordinary move, but this year the most recent move is actually the sixth one of at least that much. In fact, coming out of the March lows, the Russell saw three six-day moves of 19.1%, 16.3%, and 14.8%, respectively. The frequency with which we've seen these 10%+ moves in the Russell 2000 over a six-day period has been unlike any other year in the Russell's history. Behind 2020, the year with the next highest total of 10%+ moves was 2011 (4) and then 2008 (3), and the most there has been in any twelve-month rolling basis is five spanning late 2008 through the first half of 2009.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/111020-Russell-2000-Six-Days.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 3 Election Charts That Caught Our Attention\n\n&gt; Stocks just had their best week since April, with the S&amp;P 500 Index incredibly a chip shot away from new all-time highs. Joe Biden will be the next President of the United States, but markets are confident Republicans will maintain the Senate, and this means gridlock in Washington. Remember, gridlock is good, as it pulls policy towards compromise and avoids extremes. Also, any legislative changes to taxes, regulation, and capital gains will have meaningful input from both parties.\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, a split Congress tends to mean stronger stock returns, almost ignoring whether a Democrat or Republican is in the White House. The most likely outcome from the election at this point is a Democratic president with a divided Congress\u2014a scenario that historically has produced solid S&amp;P 500 returns of 15.9% a year.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/11.9.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Assuming President-elect Joe Biden takes over in January 2021, it is important to note that historically stocks haven\u2019t done as well the first and second years of a new president compared with an incumbent winning. This makes sense though, as historically voters may have chosen new leadership in part because of economic weakness, and the uncertainty of a new president\u2019s policies could also hold things back some. If things are good, the president tends to win reelection. Things turn around significantly by the third year in office, though, if there\u2019s new leadership. Of course, it\u2019s worth noting that the first year of a new president has seen the S&amp;P 500 higher recently, with stocks up nearly 20% the first year under President Donald Trump (2017) and 23% under President Barack Obama (2009).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/11.9.20-Blog-Chart-2-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Lastly, the strength from stocks around the election has been rather historic. \u201cThe S&amp;P 500 added 1% on four consecutive days, which hasn\u2019t happened since late 1982,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cAlthough there are only three other times this rare blast of strength happened since WWII, it is worth noting that strong returns going out a year took place after each instance.\u201d The bottom line: Extreme buying pressure has a funny way of resolving higher, and we don\u2019t anticipate this time being any different.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/11.9.20-Blog-Chart-3.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 3 The Biggest Winners Are Still Big Losers\n\n&gt; With household names like Carnival (CCL), Wynn Resorts (WYNN), Simon Property (SPG), and Royal Caribbean (RCL) all up over 20% today, more than a few people out there are probably kicking themselves for not owning any of them. But before you start ripping your hair out, keep in mind that just about all of these stocks are down (and in a big way) on the year. Of the 33 stocks in the S&amp;P 500 that are up over 20% following today\u2019s vaccine news, all but one of them are still down year to date. The only exception is Expedia (EXPE), which even after a 20%+ gain is still up just 18% on the year.\n\n&gt; In terms of sector representation, Energy tops the list with more than a third of the names (12) on the list. Behind Energy, Real Estate (8), Consumer Discretionary (6), and Financials (6) are the only other sectors with multiple stocks listed.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/110920-Best-Stocks-1109.png))**\n\n&gt; Just as the best-performing stocks are all still underperforming the S&amp;P 500 on a year to date basis, the biggest losers today are among the year\u2019s biggest winners. There are 25 stocks in the S&amp;P 500 that were down on the day as of the middle of the afternoon, but the only one that is down on the year is Biogen (BIIB), a stock whose decline has nothing to do with the vaccine news. Including BIIB, the 25 biggest losers are still up an average of 41% YTD (median: 31%). Behind BIIB, the two worst-performing stocks in the S&amp;P 500 today are Pool (POOL) and Etsy (ETSY). Both stocks are down over 10% on the day, but for the year are still holding onto gains of 56.4% and 190.5%, respectively.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/110920-Worst-Stocks-1109-1.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Policy Uncertainty Spiked Into the Election\n\n&gt; For the month of October, the NFIB's reading on small business sentiment was unchanged at the headline levels but many of the sub-indices broadly pointed to further improvements in business conditions. That is not to say small businesses do not have their share of concerns. As shown in the chart below, the NFIB's index on Economic Policy Uncertainty rose another 4 points in October to 98 which is the second-highest reading on record behind November of 2016; around the time of the last presidential election.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/111020-NFIB-Uncert2.png))**\n\n&gt; The election played a role in the uncertainty as 31% of small businesses surveyed reported government-related concerns as their biggest problem in October (lower chart). That was up for the second month in a row and is around the high end of the past couple of year's range. Additionally, as discussed earlier, labor also dominates the minds of small businesses as small businesses report struggles in filling roles. 30% reported cost or quality of labor as the single most important problem (top chart). That is unchanged since August.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/111020-NFIB-Problem-govt-labor.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Big Tech Fades and Small Caps Soar\n\n&gt; Pfizer\u2019s announcement that its vaccine for covid-19 appears to be 90% effective on Monday morning also gave new life to small-cap stocks, many of which have struggled throughout the pandemic. The announcement has also triggered an exodus from mega-cap tech stocks that had been the \u201cgo-to\u201d positions throughout most of the pandemic.\n\n&gt; The chart above is based upon a similar chart from page 112 of the Stock Trader\u2019s Almanac 2020. It shows the typical one-year seasonal pattern of the ratio of the Russell 2000 to the Russell 1000 from July through June (scale on right). Overlaid on top of this pattern is the performance of this ratio in 2020 so far through today\u2019s close (left scale). When the ratio is declining, large-cap stocks are outperforming small cap stocks. When the ratio is climbing, small caps are outperforming. In a typical year, small-caps will lag until around late-September or early October and then take off right around mid-December.\n\n&gt; Covid-19 related shutdowns and unemployment had kept small caps essentially sidelined this year. There were bouts of strength in late-July to mid-August and a brief surge in mid-September and again in early October. The recent surge higher could be an early start to the major move higher that typically begins around mid-December.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/86b0c38fda06a991b0dff788e125ad8d/b50bde8b92d0b3a1-5b/s500x750/7dbabf47c90b7da6961e2d23f94a9abb1e8d4287.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/iH1ju0y.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/ntRgt4A.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 11.16.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/BPYsDg8.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 11.16.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/Q0M8ILC.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday  11.17.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/NoHPXKo.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 11.17.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/EqCY7lq.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 11.18.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/lw83hhF.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 11.18.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/FFUyg9w.png))\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 11.19.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/R78y9vB.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 11.19.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/bKdqcYL.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 11.20.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Fff0sUp.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 11.20.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # NIO Inc. $44.56\n**NIO Inc.

        "selftext": "I'm new to investing and the stockmarket so please forgive me if I haven't posted enough info about what I want to do. And apologies in advance if I'm flagrantly misusing the wrong terminology too!\n\nThat being said, I have a lot of knowledge of video games so I wanted to first invest in esports and video game streaming.\n\nI am currently interested in Tencent, Huya and Activision Blizzard.\n\nTencent because they have League of Legends and the tournaments associated... as well a large holding in Huya and Douya who are set to merge creating a massive video game streaming service in China akin to Twitch. Tencent are also a very large multi-media company owning many other communications and technology businesses etc\n\nHuya since they are a large streaming platform and is quite a cheap stock (for me).\n\nActivision-Blizzard since they have some good video game IP's and a good hold of esports tournaments and video games which I think will grow. They own the esports competitions in which their games take place.\n\nIn general, I'm not sure about EA and tournaments for sports games, I just don't think it will grow like games akin to CS:GO, LoL, SC2. Activision Blizzard does have some failing games I think right now. Activions-Blizzards own Overwatch and Hearthstone games are dying and I don't see anything big coming out. CoD Warzone has proved popular but I dont think the new CoD's will generate near enough excitement as they used to.\n\nPerhaps I should invest in some hyper casual games and mobile apps too (Sciplay, King etc) but I am curious as to what others think!\n\nTo diversify and invest in some infrastructure im thinking to invest in AMD or Nvidia and perhaps MSI as well.\n\nAgain this is my first dip into the lake, and I wanted to start with video game related stocks. I will definitely invest in others to diversify my portfolio. What do other people think with video games right now, and is it a good place for me to start? I find the whole sector really interesting and it's something close to my heart as a passionate long time video gamer :)",

        "selftext": "I know we all feel like we are on top of the world, but we must remind ourselves some of these trades being made are very rare. I think we are all desensitized to it because there are dozens of stocks going up by double digits each day. \n\nI\u2019m not telling you to not pursue these trades, I\u2019m just suggesting you be careful. \n\n**My strategy: Take profits and Play with house money:**\n\nI have struck gold with a few of these stocks. So what I have done, is I sell at a return I\u2019m happy with and add my gains to my core positions. This way I lock my gains in and will have larger positions in safe names. \n\nFor example, I sold SBE for a 220% gain. Once I sold, I instantly bought more shares in MSFT NVDA and CRM. \n\n**Conclusion** \n\nHave fun, but be sure to remember we are playing the long game.",

        "selftext": "**In this post I am going to share my experience as I start a new portfolio from 0$ and keep adding funds to it every month as I try to grow it as fast as possible**\n\nHey everyone Happy Thanksgiving and Welcome! So, I have deposited and invested in the stock market all the money I managed to save up in the last month as I deposited 3500$ in my eToro portfolio on the 12th of November and I am already up more than 7% in just two weeks. \n\nAs my portfolio has constantly outperform the big 3 indexes the Nasdaq100, the SP500 and the Dow Jones 30 almost every day since starting my portfolio. Here is a comparison of my portfolio vs the indexes since starting as I am up over 7%. [Portfolio v Index](https://ibb.co/pRnQLQf)\n\nSo i wondered? Is it really bad to own more stocks? Is less &gt; more? What is your opinion on this subject? I believe that it is way better to be invested in more companies and to add and grow your position in time as you also see how the companies evolve and you can also do some price averaging.\n\nSo here is my current portfolio composition as I split all my money equally to start, I will go into very few little details about everyone so I don\u2019t make this a 2 hour read time.\n\nI will start now by going alphabetically and not in the most important order as the first company that I own is BYD which is a rival company for both Tesla and NIO in the EV market as they focus on cars, new energy solutions and electronics. They are also developing a lot of commercial EV like buses, coaches and taxis which will be a great addressable market for them as they are not rivaled in those segments at the moment. The company has gone up a lot in value this year as you can see in this graph and have a Forward P/E of more than 100 but I believe this company will greatly expand its sales and be one of the leaders in the segment especially in China which is the biggest EV market.

I really like how the company is managed and I believe in them for the long-run. [https://ibb.co/jw1zjgj](https://ibb.co/jw1zjgj) / [https://ibb.co/RYR4QSP](https://ibb.co/RYR4QSP)\n\nNvidia is my favorite play in the semiconductor sector as they will continue to benefit from more and more personal pc sales as well as huge data center demand especially for they\u2019re super performing products. They trade at a huge premium right now but I believe they can become the next trillion dollar company in the tech sector. [https://ibb.co/kgJS0w1](https://ibb.co/kgJS0w1) / [https://ibb.co/k8D1MSL](https://ibb.co/k8D1MSL)\n\nI also like owning Pepsico alongside Coca Cola as they are the two biggest players in the sector and I believe that they will both benefit a lot in the next years from the economy recovery. With pepsico offering a 2,7% dividend and a great growth path I really like owning this stock [https://ibb.co/2SY4xPY](https://ibb.co/2SY4xPY) / [https://ibb.co/Sdt2hGC](https://ibb.co/Sdt2hGC)\n\nPinterest is an up and coming social media platform that has a great ad friendly setup and could see growth in the next years. They are trading at insane PE ratios but that should catch up to the company in the future and I believe you must own it to be well diversified. [https://ibb.co/gwGFbyb](https://ibb.co/gwGFbyb) / [https://ibb.co/5TYz4KS](https://ibb.co/5TYz4KS)\n\nPalantir is a highly controversial name right now but its products and services are really good as they are earning more and more stamps of approval with government contracts while also expanding to commercial use. Financial info is not that good as the company barely reported they\u2019re first earnings after the IPO. [https://ibb.co/fdQ42gc](https://ibb.co/fdQ42gc) / [https://ibb.co/wyTJSG2](https://ibb.co/wyTJSG2)\n\nPayPal is another great company that will do very well in the future as payments transition to a more digital approach and the company is transitioning to allow cryptocurrencies as well which will attract even more users. They have had a greet increase in revenue and eps in the last quarters and I expect that to continue to grow. [https://ibb.co/9tXxhJZ](https://ibb.co/9tXxhJZ) / [https://ibb.co/M5vCynn](https://ibb.co/M5vCynn)\n\nQualcomm is my favorite 5G play alongside apple as this will be a long cycle of upgrades for the communications services that will benefit them a lot.They are trading at an PE of over 30 but have great revenue and EPS growth while also offering an almost 2% dividend yield. [https://ibb.co/NFsnKqW](https://ibb.co/NFsnKqW) / [https://ibb.co/x5sJLW6](https://ibb.co/x5sJLW6)\n\nRoku is a great play for the hardware and subscription based services for digital media players and has huge tailwinds that will benefit them while the old TV cycle is dying. They have had a huge year over year revenue growth and subscribers growth that has passed the 40 million mark for the first time recently. [https://ibb.co/Fqd7sYP](https://ibb.co/Fqd7sYP) / [https://ibb.co/ccKqzkC](https://ibb.co/ccKqzkC)\n\nWhile SunRun is another great play for the new Biden administration as well as the transitioning to more renewable energy as they may see a huge boost in revenue growth and earnings with more money being pumped into the renewable sector. [https://ibb.co/0jr3TRg](https://ibb.co/0jr3TRg) / [https://ibb.co/NmdSdwP](https://ibb.co/NmdSdwP)\n\nEveryone also knows Starbucks, as I expect them to be a huge gainer on a improved US-China relationship so despite suffering a lot from this economy the stock is still up more than 16% in the last year while revenues have declined, expect this to bounce back by 2021-2022. [https://ibb.co/s5nTzQX](https://ibb.co/s5nTzQX) / [https://ibb.co/fDyhvX3](https://ibb.co/fDyhvX3)\n\nShopify is a multinational e-commerce cloud based platform for merchants like small and medium sized business so that can easily have an online store that they can manage payments for, orders inventory and much more. The company is trading at P/E\u2019s that are crazy but the revenue and EPS growth is also amazing and has the potential for a lot more growth as the world is going more and more digital. [https://ibb.co/6nt4GhC](https://ibb.co/6nt4GhC) / [https://ibb.co/QbFhybt](https://ibb.co/QbFhybt)\n\nStore capital is a real estate investment trust that focuses on single tenant commercial real estate so they can negotiate much better rents and collections than other REIT. They are still more than 8$ under the highs and are a great diversification and yield giving stock to own. [https://ibb.co/XzBY41g](https://ibb.co/XzBY41g) / [https://ibb.co/TrGRZpR](https://ibb.co/TrGRZpR)\n\nAT&amp;T is one of the largest providers in the us and seems to be getting back on track after they have struggled in the past decade, they trade at only 8 times forward P/E and have one of the best dividend yields at more than 7% so I believe this is a must have staple in your portfolio that brings stability and cash flow. [https://ibb.co/cYcfYMm](https://ibb.co/cYcfYMm) / [https://ibb.co/8D3NzZr](https://ibb.co/8D3NzZr)\n\nWhile Target has been doing some amazing things as they operate as a general merchandise retailers and are doing some amazing things with online sales, they currently have seen a spike in the last months and are trading at a p/e of over 22 but I see them as a long term winner that offers both growth and value with a dividend yield of 1,5%. [https://ibb.co/Fzd8TMw](https://ibb.co/Fzd8TMw) / [https://ibb.co/NLnw4Lv](https://ibb.co/NLnw4Lv)\n\nWhile the other communication provider that I like is T-Mobile US which has seen a huge spike in user growth and are poised to do a lot of great things with the 5G cycle, they trade at a very high multiple for this sector but the growth expectations are huge for this company. [https://ibb.co/PCDFD38](https://ibb.co/PCDFD38) / [https://ibb.co/BTSzTMp](https://ibb.co/BTSzTMp)\n\nMoving on, one of the biggest gainers this year, TESLA is also one of my favorite companies to own as they continue to expand the products they offer and improve margins on vehicle, they are also expanding into more and more services, while manufacturing is growing exponentialy. They trade at insane P/E\u2019s but they have just managed to be included in the SP500 so this may bring some stability to the stock as the company continues to grow in the next decade.[https://ibb.co/6rNJf6q](https://ibb.co/6rNJf6q) / [https://ibb.co/CWN6wD4](https://ibb.co/CWN6wD4)\n\nVisa is the biggest global payments technology company and is expected to continue to grow as more people start using cashless payment options, they are a great growth and value company for the future as cash payments is a dying proposition worldwide. [https://ibb.co/CVXgZD9](https://ibb.co/CVXgZD9) / [https://ibb.co/BPKxFfZ](https://ibb.co/BPKxFfZ)\n\nWal-Mart, the biggest employer in the US continues to do amazing stuff as they continue to expand they\u2019re online presence and compete with Amazon as they trade at a 23 P/E and also offer a dividend yield. they are a great play alongside with Amazon which trades at much higher valuations. [https://ibb.co/Sr9s83J](https://ibb.co/Sr9s83J) / [https://ibb.co/0CvZKkD](https://ibb.co/0CvZKkD)\n\nWynn is another great recovery stock that I like as recently we found out that foot traffic in Macau has ramped up, this bolds well for the company as they will be one of the biggest gainers on the reopening. So if you are a long term investor you should get into this stock I believe. [https://ibb.co/6rk2qNQ](https://ibb.co/6rk2qNQ) / [https://ibb.co/mC35VPr](https://ibb.co/mC35VPr)\n\nZoom is the one company that I will be selling in the next couple of days. I know they are one of the best video conferencing apps out there, but I believe they will have a lot of problem due to a number of free apps that also offer great quality while the company is trading at insane p/e numbers. I know this trend is here to stay, but I thing there are far better play in the stock market out there rather than Zoom at this price point.  [https://ibb.co/T1tStb8](https://ibb.co/T1tStb8) / [https://ibb.co/rmxh0x3](https://ibb.co/rmxh0x3)\n\nI know I didn\u2019t get into in-depth stuff, technical analysis, fundamentals and more but I will continue go more in depth with this stocks as time goes on. \n\nSo here how I want to make my portfolio look like when I have enough money to open all the positions. [TARGETED PORTFOLIo](https://ibb.co/CHWsb27)\n\nAs you can see a quarter of my portfolio will be invested in high quality companies that are pretty safe in my opinion. While over 45% of the portfolio will go to companies that I really like, that have a pretty low risk in my opinion and can offer great returns in the future. While I will also use about 22% of my portfolio into more risky companies that can bring very good profits for the portfolio but in my opinion are not as safe as the others. \n\nAnd finally I will invest about 7% of my portfolio into more speculative stocks or hedge stocks like Barrick Gold and Goldman Sachs. I don\u2019t want to keep money on the sidelines at the moment as I expect the stock market will keep rising for a couple of years at a rapid pace due to the recovery of the economy.\n\nThank you everyone for reading!

Using previous retard data from Left's stupid ass PT, we can assume that PLTR will moon another 407%, giving us a true price target of $81+.

        "selftext": "I've been posting some of [my favorite option contracts](https://twitter.com/TradyticsAIbot) watch list every day/week. From all the contracts our bot posts, I select the best ones and post them manually here. Continuing that trend, here are some good contracts that you can trade along with my two cents.\n\n# $WKHS\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3esmak4i44y51.png?width=1635&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=639ff4344ef257d2aa46b5788c4a918dc87260da\n\nThis came in from our AI tool on Friday. Volume is higher than the OI and the price action is about to be on a strong support ([https://i.imgur.com/2Nnv7k8.png](https://i.imgur.com/2Nnv7k8.png)). This is also a longer term contract so I would consider it quite safe. Stop loss would be right under the $15 level.\n\n# $CGC\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3qh5yyut44y51.png?width=1630&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c63e9673098140a1f7f6ba087ba03e81f6b90337\n\nConsidering all the marijuana news last week and legalization of so many things, this did not close well at all. The price is right at the resistance ([https://i.imgur.com/9vpVVny.png](https://i.imgur.com/9vpVVny.png)) so you have a stop loss if it crosses above it. \n\n# $SNAP\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6tszz1t4b4y51.png?width=1635&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ceca3516d088e2b0bce710c210f5e1ba65f4fc8d\n\nSNAP has been doing wonders for some days now. It broke resistance on Friday and the attached contract went up 30%. However, if we see a dip at 43.2$ level, that would be a great opportunity to buy the contract with a stop loss at around 42 maybe. ([https://i.imgur.com/dAiLEOw.png](https://i.imgur.com/dAiLEOw.png))\n\n# $SPY &amp; $SQQQ\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6yn4j2jib4y51.png?width=1633&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7c538ebdbbb249411787af6b8ed799ebc39cab82\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/93p6hfwub4y51.png?width=1631&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4af1e67800e2ffc23ec18c82b55a609bda5c725a\n\nThese two are just for hedging purposes. The $SPY one has a long expiry so theta won't kill you. The bid ask average is also not that high. You can also go with the $SQQQ one by extending the expiry to 2-3 weeks more as it has already expired.\n\n# $NVDA\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rousil02c4y51.png?width=1635&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0dbd634d88b230c7e8ebc160d4f0d7c242567b53\n\nThis contract is already [up a 100%](https://twitter.com/TradyticsAIbot/status/1324729997198766080) after it was posted but I think it might have more room especially considering the price is right at the last resistance. If it can break the resistance level, this would be an excellent setup given there's no resistance after that ([https://i.imgur.com/vRSUP60.png](https://i.imgur.com/vRSUP60.png)). Patience will pay here.\n\nThat would be it. I hope you folks have a great weekend ahead. Let me know about your thoughts on these.\n\nCheers",

        "selftext": "**What are the latest news from the stock market? What happened yesterday? Mnuchin cuts the FED\u2019s programs and more, let\u2019s talk about it**\n\nHey everyone and Welcome, so let\u2019s start with the recap of yesterday as we saw the Nasdaq composite  \n[CHART](https://ibb.co/FK78S5n) leading the way, up more than 0,8%, the S&amp;P500 [CHART](https://ibb.co/kXKdY1g) also finishing up 0,4% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average [CHART](https://ibb.co/9Y0K4SY) barely finishing in the green on the late broad stock market rally as early day losses were cut when the stimulus bill talks seemed to have resumed in congress as this eased investor\u2019s worries, this reversed sharply after the treasury secretary announcement after hours though, as the futures of the SP and Dow futures slipped more than half a percent. [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/sFPq0sm) / [STIMULUS NEWS](https://ibb.co/xD0Qvzt)\n\nThe VIX continued to remain steady and remains in the clear downtrend started at the end of September as it dropped more than 3% again yesterday. [VIX CHART](https://ibb.co/q5tFDtr) [VIX CHART](https://ibb.co/LkF9ypR)\n\nWe saw more than 60% of the companies advancing on way below volume average as investors [CHART](https://ibb.co/kh4BLQX) are waiting to see what the next days and weeks brings us, as Pfizer is expected to apply for the FDA authorization today [NEWS](https://ibb.co/w6MQ4Tp) while huge uncertainty remains with the big spike in cases of COVID-19 in the US and a fiscal policy that remains uncertain until the change in Presidency. as yesterday the treasury declined to extend 5 of the FED\u2019s cares act emergency programs that expire at the end of the year with the most important ones being: the main street lending facility, the corporate bond purchases and the municipal bond purchases. This is not such a big thing in context as this programs have only accounted for about 25 billion$ in lending. [NEWS](https://ibb.co/tCzg4t7)\n\nThere was a pretty even distribution of growth in all of the sectors yesterday as only utilities finished in the red with large-cap value companies being the laggards of the stock market. [CHART](https://ibb.co/vPXgVJM) / [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/smy0dhn)\n\nHere is the heat map [CHART](https://ibb.co/3s4c3tg) from yesterday as the big tech companies like Apple, Amazon, Google and Microsoft finally turned positive and led the stock market higher as this companies account for about 20% of the SP500, this is not the first time that the index has been dominated by just a few players, as 40 years ago IBM, AT&amp;T, Exxon and GM made up for about 19% of the index. Though Tesla is soon joining the biggest player in the SP as they will account for about 1,3% of the index when they will be added this December. [SP HISTORY](https://ibb.co/rM846BS) / [SP FUTURE](https://ibb.co/wZnGQq3)\n\nYesterday was the first time in more than a month that the initial jobless claims came in higher than the previous week as 742 thousand people filed for benefits, this was up more than 30k from the previous week and well above the 707 thousand forecasted. This is still more than 3 times higher than pre-pandemic numbers Though better data came in from the continuing claims as they fell to 6,37 million, a number lower than the previous week of 6,8 million and lower than what was forecasted at almost 6,5 million. [JOBLESS CLAIMS](https://ibb.co/521qtyd)\n\nWhile better numbers came in as the existing home sales saw a huge spike of more than 4% as they continued to rise for a fifth straight month as the Philly fed outlook also came in well above the expectations. [FED OUTLOOK](https://ibb.co/HpWKHj2) / [HOME SALES](https://ibb.co/0YyqjWm)\n\nThe stock market may see another great moment when the European Union might approve the vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna in the next month as well. [NEWS](https://ibb.co/8KjgNyR)\n\nAlso, today it is expected that Georgia will formally certify Biden\u2019s victory, as this will pretty much put an end to Trump\u2019s legal fights and will bring more stability to the economic policy expectations for the future. [NEWS](https://ibb.co/m5fYKcQ)\n\nSome stock market companies news came in as We saw Roku yesterday hitting new all-time highs as even bearish players start to notice the huge tailwind and boost the pandemic has given to a lot of companies. Roku rose more than 10% yesterday after this news and continues to keep growing as the decline in traditional TV continues to go on while they are also close to brining HBO Max directly to they\u2019re platform. [ROKU - HBO](https://ibb.co/txyH21M) / [ROKU UPGRADE](https://ibb.co/kqcpH93)\n\nAlso Nvidia will provide Fortnite players an alternative of playing on IOS devices through it\u2019s GeForce gaming, which will mark the return of Epic Games on Apple products as they continue they\u2019re legal battle. [NVIDIA NEWS](https://ibb.co/994HKt1)\n\nWhile GM announced they will get back in the car insurance game with vehicle data providing crucial information and benefits for the company, this is exactly what Elon Musk said about Tesla getting into the insurance game as he expects that to be a huge part of Tesla in the future. [GM NEWS](https://ibb.co/Rc9BXwb)\n\nAnd as dividends go, PEPSICO and Home Depot just announced quarterly dividends with yields in line with previous. [HD DIVIDEND](https://ibb.co/yqyTr16) / [PEPSICO DIVIDEND](https://ibb.co/1LShBhm)\n\nI believe there are a lot of great opportunities to buy Stocks right now as I believe companies like PayPal, Roku, Amazon, Tesla, Target and many more still have room to run by the end of the year. In the coming days I will post my new portfolio composition and targets and I will get a little more on why I chose to buy those companies.\n\nThank you everyone for reading!

        "selftext": "**In this post I am going to share my experience as I start a new portfolio from 0$ and keep adding funds to it every month as I try to grow it as fast as possible**\n\nHey everyone Happy Thanksgiving and Welcome! So, I have deposited and invested in the stock market all the money I managed to save up in the last month as I deposited 3500$ in my eToro portfolio on the 12th of November and I am already up more than 7% in just two weeks. \n\nAs my portfolio has constantly outperform the big 3 indexes the Nasdaq100, the SP500 and the Dow Jones 30 almost every day since starting my portfolio. Here is a comparison of my portfolio vs the indexes since starting as I am up over 7%. [Portfolio v Index](https://ibb.co/pRnQLQf)\n\nSo i wondered? Is it really bad to own more stocks? Is less &gt; more? What is your opinion on this subject? I believe that it is way better to be invested in more companies and to add and grow your position in time as you also see how the companies evolve and you can also do some price averaging.\n\nSo here is my current portfolio composition as I split all my money equally to start, I will go into very few little details about everyone so I don\u2019t make this a 2 hour read time.\n\nI will start now by going alphabetically and not in the most important order as the first company that I own is BYD which is a rival company for both Tesla and NIO in the EV market as they focus on cars, new energy solutions and electronics. They are also developing a lot of commercial EV like buses, coaches and taxis which will be a great addressable market for them as they are not rivaled in those segments at the moment. The company has gone up a lot in value this year as you can see in this graph and have a Forward P/E of more than 100 but I believe this company will greatly expand its sales and be one of the leaders in the segment especially in China which is the biggest EV market. [https://ibb.co/gVVwpfR](https://ibb.co/gVVwpfR) / [https://ibb.co/z7YBGr9](https://ibb.co/z7YBGr9)\n\nThe second holding is Apple, is there anybody that doesn\u2019t know this company? They are the biggest company in the world and they continue to expand with new products and services every day, I don\u2019t see this company going down in the short term or the long term as they have pretty expensive at a 35 P/E but earnings are still rising especially with more subscription based income coming in with the release of the Apple One Bundle.

But by Tuesday, It will be safe to load up on PLTR again.\n\nLook at what happened to BLNK, NIO, NVDA, TSLA.\n\nShitron does not provide extensive DD to justify their price target. They simply do it because stonks run too hot or cold in which they can manipulate the sentiment drastically.\n\nIt is possible Shitron covered some or all of their short position. It is also possible that they still have short position and plan on closing it on Monday or Tuesday by latest.\n\nAbout 30 minutes before Shitron's tweet came out, PLTR started to lose steam and drop in value (This was them adding short position).\n\nWhen they tweeted and caused fear in the market, many paper hands and profit takers rushed to sell.\n\nWe also witnessed how quick the dip was bought from -10% to -1% then back to -5% to end the day.\n\nMy prediction:\n\nMonday will be volatile as usual. There is still great fear with PLTR caused by Shitron on Friday. If Shitron may drive the price down another 10. BUT if MONDAY is green, that just concludes Shitron already covered their short position.\n\nMy move:\n\nIf Monday is green, I will add PLTR to my position as Shitron has already closed their short position.\n\nIf Monday is red, I will wait for a good DIP entry possibly 5-15% red depending on the volume and speed of the dip.\n\nMy 2cents:\n\nI get that this is WSB and people love to buy FDs. From time to time, I YOLO FD to feel that adrenaline rush and become a crackhead in going through the sub every second and researching every bit of info about my position.\n\nBut this can wipe you out. Yes, I've been there and you've been there.\n\nI never want to be wiped out ever again.\n\nBuy at least 1 month out with 0.2-0.3 delta option this amazing PLTR dip opportunity and be patient.\n\nMay the TENDIES RAIN on US.\n\nAnd lastly, F\\*\\*\\* SHITRON!!!",

        "selftext": "**In this post we\u2019ll talk about what happened last week in the stock market and what to expect this week as earnings season is coming to an end**\n\n[THUMB](https://ibb.co/j64rkG0)\n\nHey everyone and Welcome, so let\u2019s start with a recap of Friday\u2019s movements in the stock market and what happened last week as we saw the Dow finishing Friday up 1,37% [CHART](https://ibb.co/HHPdbR9), the S&amp;P500 up almost the same while closing at a record level for the index [CHART](https://ibb.co/HTG25s0) and the Nasdaq composite being up just over 1% [CHART](https://ibb.co/274Gq6g).\n\nAlmost 80% of companies were advancing on Friday as the stock market finished the week strong with an almost 90% ratio of new highs vs lows but the volume was way below average on Friday as most investors finished restructuring they\u2019re portfolios in the early part of the week after the Vaccine news [CHART](https://ibb.co/sbn5dWp).\n\nAlso this week we saw the largest ever global equity inflow as you can see in this Bank of American chart as there were over 40 billion dollars being pushed in equities. [CHART](https://ibb.co/18g7xrJ)\n\nAll sectors finished in the green on Friday with real estate, energy and industrial leading the way with all 3 sectors having more than 50% of companies up over 2%, even tech kept up the pace after leading us through this recovery with over 37% of companies being up more than 2% on the day.\n\nWe also saw small-cap and value plays outperform again as people are betting that the economy will have a broader breadth of recovery after the vaccine will be available. [CHART](https://ibb.co/jTMx5ry)\n\nThe VIX also finished the week very strong as it continued to decline to it\u2019s lowest level, ending the week at the 23 level. [CHART](https://ibb.co/j4057B8)\n\nAs you can see in both the SP500 heat map [CHART](https://ibb.co/dW01vyR) and the world heat map  [CHART](https://ibb.co/G2Fvk7c) almost all companies were in the green on Friday with a few exceptions like Nvidia, NetFlix and Alibaba, as they were punished a little after the huge run they in the last 9 months while Alibaba continues to struggle with the Chinese government.\n\nThe COVID-19 numbers are dangerously going up as you can see, with daily cases going parabolic, indeed with a bigger number of tests being taken but there is still a huge rise in positivity rate, and as you can see this is the 3rd hump of the pandemic in terms of numbers of hospitalized people. The one positive thing for the moment is that deaths haven\u2019t gone up as much due to the better treatment but this number does usually trail the others so we will have to see what happens in the next weeks. [CHART](https://ibb.co/wdSTt4v)\n\nHere you can see better that weekly test are up almost 10% while weekly cases have gone up 4times that much almost at a 40% growth rate while the hospitalized and deaths have not increased as much as the cases yet. [CHART](https://ibb.co/QpzPbs8)\n\nThis weeks interesting earnings [EARNINGS](https://ibb.co/K5bMM4B) in my opinion will come from Walmart and Home Depot before the open on Tuesday as I expect both of them to dazzle in the earnings reports, while Walmart is expected to have an EPS of 1$ and 19 cents I expect them to be around 1,5$ at least like last quarter while Home depot is expected to have an EPS of just over 3$ I expect that to be at least 30cents to half a $ better then expected also as the companies look to continue the amazing earnings season that is mostly ending this week as we saw an overwhelming number of companies beating the estimates by quite a gap.\n\nThis will be followed after the close with the Concept company NIO which has been going up amazingly in the last weeks as it has touched even 54$ but has since seen a pullback of almost 10$, so be careful when trading this, it may be a bumpy ride as the company is still losing money and seeking to increase manufacturing and sales, as I don\u2019t see them having to much of a success in Europe even if the manage to launch they\u2019re cars there, this because people will have a stigma for the company as being Chinese, and not offering great quality. Despite the recent Chinese movements some good news came in on Sunday as China has formed the largest free trade block that includes fifteen Asia-Pacific Economies with big names like Japan, South Korea, Australia and others being included [NEWS](https://ibb.co/XbcqV80). This group will account for 30% of the global economy and population. This will probably bold well for NIO as it has tanked after Citron released a statement that they are taking profits in NIO [NEWS](https://ibb.co/SQBbW6s).\n\nMoving on Wednesday we will also get some other retailers reports with Target and Lowe\u2019s releasing reports also before the open. I believe this two will be impacted by what Walmart and Home Depot announce, if they have great results expect them the stocks to see a double move on Tuesday and Wednesday. Also, one of the biggest gainer of the stay at home moves, nVidia, will report after the close as I expect them do have great earnings again as they will continue to benefit a lot from the stay-at-home economy as October videogame sales were up 14% expect this also be translated into Nvidia\u2019s earnings as this was the month before the new consoles from Microsoft and Sony were released. [NVIDIA NEWS](https://ibb.co/kK3WWj4)\n\nSo I really like all 3 of Home Depot, Walmart and Nvidia and if you want to make a gamble you can also make a small investment in Nio, as there are no other big catalysts at the moment earnings may impact the stocks and we can see a re-test of highs for all of them.\n\nOne other company that I will keep my eye on is Disney as they beat the expectations for earnings, revenue and subscriber for the streaming business, I will watch what updates the investors meeting in December will provide us, as I really like the company and the stock very much, if they want to keep this going and become a rival for NetFlix they do have to invest much more money in content, as they will have to keep providing new content that generates growth for Disney+. [NEWS](https://ibb.co/QNCc3D3)\n\nSome other news from the last days are that Qualcomm has received an exemption to sell chips to Huawei, which is not was expected that they would be allowed to sell 5G chips, but still is good news for the company as it provides another buyer for its products. [NEWS](https://ibb.co/ZVp8gTw)\n\nWhile DraftKings soared on Friday after they announced better than expected results and guidance for the future. [NEWS](https://ibb.co/qy9vmyB)\n\nThis came alongside the filing of documents for the hugely anticipated of DoorDash the leader in food delivery with a 50% market share.

        "selftext": "On Sunday I posted my [game plan for the week](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/jz7n7u/i_draw_with_crayons_so_you_dont_have_to_last_week/) outlining some stocks that were on my watchlist in terms of technicals and entry-points. I updated my plays on Monday morning with my positions.\n\nDue to the short trading week I will be looking to HODL all these positions until next week and maybe close out Monday if we get another pop. I'll still be putting together my game-plan on Sunday for stocks to keep an eye on just incase I close some positions Friday or Monday and free up some capital.\n\nKeep in mind Monday after I entered these positions they all continued to dip. **I was down $600** by mid-day of the Monday trading day, but I wasn't even sweating. I have good entry points and am prepared to HODL shares as always. Yesterday and today was some nice price action for my account as yesterday I regained my losses from Monday and reclaimed the green side and today also gave me a nice jump. Up $1,200 just today on my positions.\n\nThese are currently 'unrealized' gains because I haven't sold my positions yet and anything can happen.\n\n**New Position**\n\n**PTON:** Yesterday PTON dipped hardcore down 6%. It was too tempting to resist and sold a put to open when it was down 4%. It continued to dip some more, but I am ok with that. \n\nI sold the December 11 2020 $101 strike put for $3.6 or $360 in premium. Break-even point is going to be if the stock dips below $97.40, which I dont think it will get that far. If it does I'm completely ok wheeling this stock. It's got strong fundamentals and also a nice IV to collect premium.\n\n**Current Positions**\n\n**PTON:** Mentioned above.\n\n**FB:** Had a nice gain here, will look to close out next week if it continues going up. My strike is pretty safe here and I don't think it will be getting contested.\n\n**KR:** Shares + covered calls. This thing barely moves, but I do expect a very slow grind up.\n\n**LULU:** Going to exit this position next week if I can squeeze out another 10% gain. It's December 18 expiration so it still has a long time to go just for that 30% gain.\n\n**MSFT:** Shares. Slow and steady grind hoping I can get closer to my price target of $220 where it will meet the armed guards of the resistance.\n\n**NVDA:** Shares. Had a good little pop today, I still think this can get up to $550 before I close out my shares and look for new opportunities.\n\n**SHOP:** Shares. SHOP had a great today. Started the week at the bottom of the trend/channel and is starting it's grind up to the upper side. Looking for $1,050 before I consider exiting my shares.\n\n[Positions Screenshot](https://imgur.com/a/4ZlNIfI)",

        "selftext": "Hello, looking for advice on whether to invest more into risky growth hype stocks\n\nI'm 19 currently studying at University, my portfolio consits of some safeish stocks such as Apple (up 7%), Microsoft (up 1%), Amazon, Google and nVidia. I also have some growth stocks such as NIO (up 167%), NET (up 130%) and PLTR (up 46%). Im in about 60% safe 40% risk/growth stocks.\n\nMy question is, as I'm young and dont have a massive amount invested (~\u00a34k). Would it be a bad idea to sell my safe stocks and invest more aggressively into growth stocks, maybe expanding into more EVs such as Li and xpeng. I'm hoping for as much gain as possible in the next 4 years til I graduate to aid me in putting a deposit on a house. However I am nervous at the possibility of major pullbacks from these growth stocks. I am also concerned that APPL, MSFT and NVDA won't produce the return im looking for.\n\nOn top of this im looking to invest around 1500 a year for the next 4 years.\n\nAny advice is appreciated, as you can tell, I'm new to this.

        "selftext": "Been lurking here for a little while now while I\u2019ve been learning about investing and now options. I still have no idea other than the basics about options but I understand how buying a lottery ticket works. \n\nFinally opened an account earlier this week with a (very) small chunk of change. Most of it went to dividend stocks for long term growth but as they say you gotta risk it for the biscuit. \n\nBought 30 shares of NMCI as a long play but what I\u2019m really excited about is Seagate (STX). I definitely don\u2019t have the capital to invest in shares but I\u2019ve been watching it and I think it\u2019s gonna continue the steady rise it\u2019s on. \n\nWith how fast tech advances and Seagate\u2019s new Lyve Drive I think they\u2019re poised for some great growth. Anyways what do you guys think about STX? I haven\u2019t seen many people talking about it on the sub. \n\nSTX 15 Jan 21 67.5 C\n\nOh and Go Retards! Or whatever y\u2019all say",
