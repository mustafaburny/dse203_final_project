The slide was leaked and confirmed by [videocardz.com](https://videocardz.com) which is a very authentic source for tech news.

Even if the cards are neck in neck AMD will be able to paint the 6000 series cards as better due to minor discrepancies.\n\nRadeon RX 6900 XT\t5,120\t1,500\t16GB GDDR6\t512\t256-bit\t300  \n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRadeon RX 6800 XT\t3,840\t1,500\t12GB GDDR6\t384\t192-bit\t200  \n\\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRadeon RX 6700 XT\t2,560\t1,500\t6GB GDDR6\t384\t192-bit\t150  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x0zjsju2clq51.png?width=970&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=14551f974837dfc21662c24da268d5284287d169\n\n  \n\\#3\n\n**NVIDIA 3rd Party Card Catastrophe**\n\n*(this section is from my previous post)*\n\nSo most GPUs are made by a 3rd party. AMD and NVIDIA make the actual \"brain\" of the GPU but 3rd party partners add onto it for better performance (very basic explanation). Don't ask me why this is, it is just mainly because of logistical reasons.\n\nBut that is not the point, the point is that the great majority of GPUs are third-party cards meaning that they get to change around the design of the PCB. The issue here is that some of these third-party partners cheaped out on little capacitors.\n\nBy cheapening out it is leading to bad power delivery. The only way to fix this rn is to downclock the card which the normal person doesn't know how to do and doesn't expect is necessary when they are buying a 500$+ piece of hardware.\n\nI feel like if there is a mass callback that will be bad PR. NVIDIA could always release drivers that make the cards run below their listed spec but i'm not sure if people will really want that even if the performance loss is marginal.\n\nEVGA already confirmed the suspicions that these cards were crashing because of capacitor issues. It may be different for other companies but at least for EVGA this is what they are saying currently.\n\n**But why does this matter??**\n\nPeople who were looking to pick up a next-gen GPU right away are now hesitant and will wait for AMDS offerings. The people who did return their GPUs will also possibly wait. Faulty cards will most likely get a down clock which will make Big Navi look better. It supposedly already is better and this 3-5% difference could really change people's minds.  \n\n\n\\#4 \n\nLisa Su is an absolute unit. She will for sure talk about their timeline and plans for 5nm/3nm. I am guessing that this will rally investors to invest because they will see shinny 5nm/3nm while Intel is just getting to 10nm.  \n\n\n**POSITIONS:**  \n\\+95 call  (exp 12/18)  \n\\- 100 call (exp 12/18)\n\n(*call me a pussy for using a debit spread but I think its the best for my case)*  \n\n\nif you have something else you want to share comments below and I will add it!\n\nSources:\n\n[https://videocardz.com/newz/amd-ryzen-9-3950x-to-become-worlds-first-16-core-gaming-cpu](https://videocardz.com/newz/amd-ryzen-9-3950x-to-become-worlds-first-16-core-gaming-cpu)\n\n[https://www.igorslab.de/en/what-real-what-can-be-investigative-within-the-crashes-and-instabilities-of-the-force-rtx-3080-andrtx-3090/](https://www.igorslab.de/en/what-real-what-can-be-investigative-within-the-crashes-and-instabilities-of-the-force-rtx-3080-andrtx-3090/)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6bUUEEe-X8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6bUUEEe-X8)\n\n[https://www.tomshardware.com/news/evga-nvidia-rtx-3080-capacitor-caused-crashes](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/evga-nvidia-rtx-3080-capacitor-caused-crashes)\n\n[https://www.tomshardware.com/news/newegg-insider-reportedly-reveals-radeon-rx-6900-xt-rx-6800xt-rx-6700-xt-specifications](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/newegg-insider-reportedly-reveals-radeon-rx-6900-xt-rx-6800xt-rx-6700-xt-specifications)\n\n*This is not financial advice just me presenting the facts and the possibility of a callback.*  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b2ciqo9vdlq51.png?width=662&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=64d0fa79a87e74390c112a07e8d93a82c5a8476e",

Of my individual stocks, tech makes up about 60%. I currently have non-tech holdings in Disney, KO, ICLN, BABA, a small portion in NIO and SNE. I know SNE is tech but it does not move with the sector much and I really like this position. Any thoughts on good buys. I was really interested in BA but wanted to wait to see what happened after sept 15th and that wasn't great. Great buy but will take years so I am watching for now. Some others I have been following are V/MA, FDX (although getting pricey), J&amp;J and CVS. Another reasonable option I have been considering is putting more money into SPY and also ICLN to a lesser extent. Appreciate any input or other ideas. Thanks!",

        "selftext": "There are different ways to trade in a choppy environment. Here\u2019s a deep dive on how I attempted to use weekly options to trade a potential bounce in AMZN, and collected $.37 initially, for the possibility of making $50 more, even though the trade ended up being only an .$81 winner. \n\n# The Entry\n\nLast Thursday, 9/24, when $AMZN was trading at about $3000 a share, I was looking for a cheap way to play a bounce in the stock. During that time, my bias in the markets had begun to shift to a more bullish stance after seeing how the market had difficulty grinding lower. With that in mind, I wanted to play a potential bounce in tech. But I knew I didn\u2019t want to pay a debit at all to play for a bounce that might not even happen, given how uncertain and choppy the markets had been, but I still wanted to set myself up to capture some large gains if AMZN did indeed bounce. Therefore, the strategy that made the most sense to me, was a Call broken wing butterfly.\n\nGiven that I\u2019m a very short-term options trader who loves trading weeklies, I was trying to look for a cheap butterfly for the upcoming week that I could put on for a net credit. After exploring the options chain, I came across the +1/-2/+1 3300/3350/3450 call broken wing butterfly for the Oct 2 series. This fly, at the time (on Sept 24), was trading for a total of $.37 credit. Meaning, by putting on that butterfly, I would get paid $.37, and the following scenarios could happen:\n\n1. If AMZN decided to tank or hang out sideways and never get up close enough to the butterfly to expand the spread in my favor, then I\u2019d walk away pocketing the $.37 credit\n2. If AMZN slowly crept up to reach exactly 3350 by expiration, I\u2019d not only get to keep the credit, but also be able to sell the butterfly back out for $50. Of course, it doesn\u2019t need to reach exactly 3350 by expiration. If AMZN slowly worked its way up to near 3300, then the butterfly would expand very nicely as well.\n3. If AMZN blew past 3400 by expiration, I\u2019d see a loss, up to a maximum of $50 / spread (if $AMZN moves past 3450). That\u2019s because the 3300/3350 long call vertical of the fly provides 50 points of coverage before I essentially start losing money from the 3350/3450 short vertical, up until that 3450 kicks in to cap off further upside losses.\n\nSo that is a rough outline of the potential scenarios that would happen with this trade. \n\nGiven the choppy market conditions, I was ok with risking $50/spread (point #3), in order to not lose money if I\u2019m wrong on direction (point #1), while at the same time, keeping myself open to the possibility of the butterfly expanding in my favor (point #2) for some potentially very large gains. \n\nBut satisfying point #3 is tricky. I needed more data points suggesting that $AMZN wouldn\u2019t surge higher early on in the trade. Because if $AMZN did surge higher early on in the trade, then while the 3300 long call would rise in value, those two 3350 short calls would also rise in value, and because there\u2019d still be some time value left, they could be very juiced up and eat away at the profits of that 3300 long call, so much so that the 3450 long call won\u2019t even be able to offset those losses, especially given how far out of the money that 3450 call is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[AMZN on 9\\/24, daily timeframe](https://preview.redd.it/fvqvwaeh6xq51.png?width=4096&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=844361115e2cba2ef284b41c734751b7162c77fa)\n\nLooking at the chart above on 9/24, we can see that AMZN was trading at around $3000/share. In order to reach $3300 (where the first long call of the broken wing butterfly is), the stock would need to\n\n1. Breach the 38% fib retracement (\\~AMZN=3131) of the move from the 9/2 high to the 9/21 low, \n2. Breach the 20MA and 50MA\n3. Breach the 50% fib retracement (\\~AMZN=3211)\n4. Breach the 61.8% fib retracement (\\~AMZN=3292)\n\nbefore finally reaching the 3300 long call. All of these levels, I felt, should provide some resistance for AMZN to have to chew thru over the following week, before it even gets to the long call. And by that time, if AMZN did reach 3300, then the 3300 long call would still have a lot of extrinsic value left (somewhere around $20 on the last day), while the 3350 short calls would be very cheap (each around $5), so the entire spread could be roughly worth $10. Which would be great, because that means I\u2019d be getting paid $.37 to make another $10. \n\nSo with all of the above considered, I chose to take on that upside risk, for a chance to make potentially $50 (realistically I try to aim for just half of the max profit: $25, and start harvesting profits and peeling off the flies at around $5-$10), and that day on 9/24, entered the Oct2 3300/3350/3450 call broken wing butterfly for a $.37 credit. \n\nAfter entry, on Friday 9/25 and Monday 9/28, AMZN made steady progress upwards, from 3000 to 3175, breaching the 31.8% retracement and tagging the 20MA and 50MA from below.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[AMZN on 9\\/28, daily timeframe](https://preview.redd.it/qhbap1di6xq51.png?width=4096&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8dbb881ff54b0738a915407b66acc041292bf4af)\n\nbut this move wasn\u2019t large and fast enough to expand the value of the 3350 short calls. In fact, theta did a great job draining those short calls, while the 3300 long call did a good job retaining its premium, so the butterfly had already expanded a bit in my favor, and I was sitting at about a small $1.00 profit.\n\n# The Adjustment\n\nHowever, on Tuesday and Wednesday, AMZN began to stall out. By the end of Wednesday 9/30, when it looked like AMZN was putting in a topping tail, I decided that AMZN might not be able to make it near 3300 by expiration Friday, so I wanted to take in a bit more credit while I still could, before theta drained more of that 3300 long call. At the time, the spread was trading for almost $2.\n\nThat\u2019s when I made a slight adjustment to the spread and sold the 3300/3310 call vertical. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[AMZN on 9\\/30, daily timeframe](https://preview.redd.it/mvsrotaj6xq51.png?width=4096&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3c2642107f30c304964a59d5dc24ea636622e52a)\n\nThis essentially rolled the 3300 long call up to 3310, and I was able to collect a small $.44 credit for it. However, this adjustment did open me up to an additional $10 of risk to the upside, because now, the long call vertical portion of the butterfly is only $40 wide (instead of $50). Still, with only 2 days left for AMZN to go higher, I felt comfortable taking on a bit more upside risk knowing that theta is going to be working hard to drain those 3350 short calls if AMZN did decide to surge higher. And at that moment, I actually wanted AMZN to move more towards my fly. My deltas were still positive, and the risk graph showed that a move towards the short strikes of the fly would expand it by another $4-5 by Thursday. \n\nSo after this adjustment, the trade stood at a $.81 credit, and the profit potential on the fly was now $40 instead of $50. Which is still pretty good.\n\n# The Tease\n\nOn Thursday, AMZN showed some strength and closed above the 50% fib (3211), which meant that if on Friday, AMZN worked its way up to around 3300, the fly could potentially be worth $5-10. Things were looking good (on any continued bullishness, the next target for AMZN was the 61.8% fib retracement at \\~3300). So I left the trade alone without making any more adjustments. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[AMZN on 10\\/1, daily timeframe](https://preview.redd.it/lrtmt80k6xq51.png?width=4096&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8134eed2543798ec4ad22d88c8a0742f9ed4a011)\n\n# The Flop\n\nUnfortunately, on Thursday night, news broke out that Trump was diagnosed with Coronavirus, and the market fell lower. By the open, AMZN was already trading at around 3150, roughly 150 points below the fly. The spread had instantly lost all of its value, so I basically let it expire worthless and walked away pocketing the $.81 credit. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mpwrkjpk6xq51.png?width=4096&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8dd7f4da7b000b2266ab57a3c23c1863f9423704\n\nWhile the trade did not work out as well as I had liked, the important thing to note is that I was able to get paid even when the trade didn\u2019t go in my favor. With options, there are ways to trade an underlying to a certain target without ponying up a debit, albeit at the cost of introducing tail risk, while offering the possibility of very large upside. This may be a style of trading that one can consider employing when the outlook of the markets is uncertain, as long as the trader is willing to make the necessary adjustments to control risk. \n\nWhich leads me to the following section: \n\n# FAQ \n\n&gt;What if AMZN decided to surge very early on during the trade? What if AMZN had surged to 3300 with 4-5 DTE, hence juicing up the short calls and causing the butterfly to take on large negative deltas?\n\nEven though the position would be very theta positive, I would pony up the debit to cap off the upside risk by buying the 3400/3450 call vertical, hence turning the 3300/3350/3450 broken wing butterfly into the 3300/3350/3400 balanced butterfly. From there on out until expiration, I would look for ways to reduce the debit incurred from that adjustment. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;But what if AMZN tanked afterwards? You could end up getting whipsawed.\n\nI\u2019d rather be safe than sorry and make the necessary adjustments to avoid getting run over, because I don\u2019t like playing the hope card. I could always undo the adjustment and look for ways to collect back more credit (at the cost of introducing risk elsewhere), depending on my new directional bias on AMZN at the time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Your maximum loss is so large, $5000. I\u2019d never make that bet, I would never risk $5000 to make $5000. \n\nThis style of trading is not for everyone. There are different ways to perceive risk. I don't really think of risk as binary as \u201cmax gain vs max loss\u201d. If the trade goes against me, I\u2019m not going to open myself up to the possibility of eating the maximum loss. I\u2019m going to manage that risk and make sure that I don\u2019t lose any money at all on the trade. Basically, I\u2019m not going to just put on the trade, walk away to the prayer room, and come back at expiration and hope that AMZN expired at 3350.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Why not just join thetagang and slap on iron condors / credit spreads in this environment? You could\u2019ve collected more credit by selling a 50 point wide put vertical with your bounce thesis. \n\nDifferent traders have different styles. I personally don\u2019t like pure premium selling strategies. I\u2019d rather have long options in front of the shorts to open myself up for some large upside and convexity in the P/L curve, rather than limit myself to the concavity of pure premium selling strategies. Having long options in front of the shorts also helps me sleep better at night.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;It\u2019s hard to read this. Is there a more visual explanation? \n\nHere\u2019s a video on it: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uq76fZ3EME](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uq76fZ3EME)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*TL;DR - I used weekly options to trade a potential bounce in AMZN, and got paid $.37 initially to do so, for the possibility of making $50 more. While the trade did not pan out, I walked away pocketing $.81 for being wrong.*",

        "selftext": "The time for Hyliion's \"IPO\" (HYLN) has come.\n\n**About Hyliion**\n\nThe company description below comes from a recent Business Wire article.  I can't provide the link as a certain other company can't be mentioned in the link itself:\n\n&gt; Hyliion\u2019s mission is to be the leading provider of electrified powertrain solutions for the commercial vehicle industry. Hyliion\u2019s goal is to reduce the carbon intensity and GHG emissions of the transportation sector by providing electrified powertrain solutions for Class 8 commercial vehicles at the lowest total cost of ownership (TCO). Hyliion\u2019s solutions utilize its proprietary battery systems, control software and data analytics combined with fully integrated electric motors and power electronics, to produce electrified powertrain systems that either augment\u2014in the case of Hyliion\u2019s Hybrid systems\u2014or fully replace\u2014in the case of the fully electric Hypertruck ERX system\u2014traditional diesel or natural gas fueled powertrains and improve their performance. By reducing both GHG emissions and TCO, Hyliion\u2019s environmentally conscious solutions support its customers\u2019 pursuit of their sustainability and financial objectives.\n\n**Investor Presentation**\n\nAs someone else wrote here, [Hyliion (HYLN) is not the next Nikola.  This is a good thing.](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/j03etb/hyliion_hyln_is_not_the_next_nikola_this_is_a/)\n\nThe company's Investor Presentation can be found [here](https://rpn113p35qekzef7411kp2qt-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Hyliion-Tortoise-Overview-Presentation.pdf).\n\nAs can be shown in the presentation:\n\n1) HYLN has its defined niche: Class 8 trucks.  Not even Tesla will be competing in this field, for a decade or more.\n\n2) HYLN has a total addressable market of $800 billion in the US alone.  One customer, Agility, operates in 100 countries.\n\n3) HYLN won't play the capital-intensive game of setting up EV-related infrastructure.  They are not in the business of being a \"gas station.\"\n\n4) HYLN will first use renewable natural gas and natural gas generators for its Hypertruck electrified powertrain systems, yet is already developing them to be compatible with fully electric solutions such as hydrogen fuel cells.  They are being practical here in addressing the needs of original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) of trucks (for the trucking industry).\n\n5) HYLN already has operational prototypes.\n\n6) HYLN already has million-mileage logs for the first number of trucks already deployed.\n\n**Renewable Natural Gas**\n\n[An article on FreightWaves](https://www.freightwaves.com/news/nikola-hyliion-defend-divergent-paths-to-zero-emission-trucking) provides a brief summary of what renewable natural gas is:\n\n&gt; Renewable natural gas (RNG) starts as a biogas from the decomposition of organic matter, such as wastewater, food, green waste and farming. It is cleaned and processed into biomethane that is injected into the pipeline. When used as a transportation fuel, RNG has a negative carbon intensity, said Deanna Haines, director of Energy &amp; Environmental Policy at SoCalGas.\n\nRNG production is expected to [double in the near future](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WnTNJZTqo4&amp;feature=youtu.be).\n\nInfrastructure-wise, there are plenty of natural gas stations in Europe.  For example, Italy has over 1,400, while Germany has over 800.\n\n**Battery Management Supply Chain**\n\nTwo years ago, Hyliion [acquired Gentherm's battery division](https://www.freightwaves.com/news/equipment/hyliion-acquires-battery-producer) to have its battery management supply chain in-house.\n\n**Financials**\n\nFuture-oriented revenue data (projections), per the Investor Presentation, are as follows:\n\n2020: $1 million\n\n2021: $8 million\n\n2022: $344 million\n\n2023: $1.0 billion\n\n2024: $2.1 billion\n\nNot every target company in a reverse merger discloses current or historical financial information.  In this case, however, [such information can be found in an SEC filing](https://sec.report/Document/0001213900-20-022028/?__cf_chl_jschl_tk__=c38d42b8c68dad4fd4c816b5799dca4bdbe435aa-1601600373-0-Ae7hxOZAy6LXjWjw6G7Ra_bQuy3Ig2re0xzZ8HVp3NVtRg9gOZ5UW-0RpnGg7RMobRYDNgh92m3CLI6_6k-MCw37XKHDzhqXsb7mFT7iOpdy6MWA5MmZDeLPzdmwjftk-8c17hucybdmgOAOT2jSXkLq8EKx3JW11mzOSq1OdzbNrRlsDNo4PBbPshX1D7_0H_3jIyGFkesJQTFSKlqU5VgiVIsKYwGqGh0xUOpq9apt1EOGGQh4UPw7ZpYFYlJduNqSM48x8ZtJn3L4CTdkTRbBINYlTg0c4elHQXkcxtIQpP1bCLZ1aMTRwKqmtTNDSMhiMj0Tv0EMfU5lBYL_xHNul5htXHIinMHI7D2xxBGW8VfbbFp1gRuuUJoeZylFnw#ta_006).\n\n**Values and Governance**\n\nHyliion has just committed to its reverse merger while having a non-classified board.  It's one thing to assert that the company isn't conducive to fraud like Nikola has been (such as plastic model vehicles with no operating prototypes, or fake orders).  It's quite another to demonstrate this.\n\nOne of the problems Nikola has is having a classified board.  In the long run, a classified board isn't as effective as a non-classified board.  This comparison extends to fraud prevention.\n\n**Stock Price Disadvantages**\n\nBeing an engineer by background, Thomas Healy does not have the marketing skills of Trevor Milton.\n\nWhile Hyliion itself has the potential to break away from the Nikola drama, HYLN's price will likely remain quite dependent upon TSLA's price movements, just like all the other stocks in the EV space.  Any out-of-control tweet by Elon Musk, let alone any performance hiccup over at Tesla, could have adverse effects on HYLN.\n\n**Stock Price Advantages**\n\nEven I expected a second wave of COVID-19 to have a correction effect on tech stocks.  I was mistaken in this regard, as large institutional funds have rotated back into the tech sector, including that part of it which is future-tech oriented (TSLA, SHOP, FSLY, ZM, etc.).\n\n**Evaluation**\n\nHYLN is a solid hold for at least five years, maybe even ten.  It is definitely worth a starter position first thing in the morning, and an additional position or two later in the day, for DCA purposes.\n\n*Disclosure: Long on shares and warrants.*",

        "selftext": "Good Friday evening to all of you here on r/StockMarket. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning October 5th, 2020.\n\n# **Stocks fall following Trump\u2019s positive virus test, but close off the worst levels on stimulus hopes  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/01/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)**\n*****\n&gt; U.S. stocks fell in volatile trading on Friday after President Donald Trump\u2019s coronavirus diagnosis fueled concerns about the election and a worsening pandemic.\n*****\n&gt; Major averages clawed back some of the steep losses after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi signaled aid for the airline industry could be coming soon, perhaps even as part of a much-anticipated broad relief bill.\n*****\n&gt; The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 134.09 points, or 0.5%, lower at 27,682.81 after dropping 430 points at its session low. The S&amp;P 500 slid 1.0%, or 32.36 points, to 3,248.44 after falling as much as 1.7% earlier. The Nasdaq Composite declined 2.2%, or 251.49 points, to 11,075.02.\n*****\n&gt; Shares of airlines jumped higher in unison after Pelosi called on the industry to delay furloughs, saying relief for airline workers is \u201cimminent.\u201d American Airlines and United erased earlier losses and popped 3.3% and 2.4%, respectively.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe will either enact Chairman DeFazio\u2019s bipartisan stand-alone legislation or achieve this as part of a comprehensive negotiated relief bill, extending for another six months the Payroll Support Program,\u201d Pelosi said in a statement.\n*****\n&gt; Earlier Friday, Pelosi said Trump\u2019s illness changed the dynamic of stimulus talks, adding lawmakers will find the \u201cmiddle ground\u201d and will \u201cget the job done.\u201d The House passed the $2.2 trillion Democratic coronavirus stimulus bill Thursday night, while Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has offered a $1.6 trillion package.\n*****\n&gt; Still, the president\u2019s diagnosis added more uncertainty to the election, an event that was already weighing on the market and keeping traders on edge as they attempted to evaluate the possible outcomes. It also raised concerns about a second wave of the virus and a slower reopening.\n*****\n&gt; White House physician Dr. Sean Conley said in a memo, \u201cThe President and First Lady are both well at this time, and they plan to remain at home within the White House during their convalescence.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Conley also said he expects Trump to \u201ccontinue carrying out his duties without disruption while recovering.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; White House chief of staff Mark Meadows said Friday Trump was having \u201cmild\u201d symptoms after testing positive for the virus and that he and Melania are in \u201cgood spirits.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; The Trump campaign announced that all events involving the president\u2019s participation are going virtual or being temporarily postponed.\n*****\n&gt; Vice President Mike Pence and second lady Karen Pence have both tested negative for the coronavirus, Pence\u2019s spokesman said Friday. Mnuchin has also tested negative, the Treasury\u2019s assistant secretary for public affairs said Friday.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThis October surprise raises the already high level of political uncertainty markets are dealing with as Election Day approaches,\u201d said Jeff Buchbinder, equity strategist at LPL Financial. \u201cMarkets appear to be increasingly pricing Joe Biden in as the favorite, and this news may not change that, but Trump could gain support from a quick recovery.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; The Trump tweet initially knocked down Dow futures more than 500 points in overnight trading.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIt really brings into stark reality that we are potentially going into \u2026 a second wave,\u201d said Jeff Henriksen, co-founder and CEO of Thorpe Abbotts Capital, to CNBC\u2019s \u201cSquawk Box Europe.\u201d \u201cPresident Trump getting this really highlights that in a way that I think it will focus attention back on the virus and the effects it will have.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Technology shares led the declines on Friday with Apple, Amazon, Microsoft and Facebook all losing more than 2.5%. Tech stocks could come under pressure under a Democratic sweep scenario if it leads to higher tax rates and tighter regulations, many strategists have said. Investors also could rotate out of technology shares and into more cyclical stocks if a stimulus is passed.\n*****\n&gt; Also weighing on the sentiment was a worse-than-expected September jobs report. Nonfarm payroll rose by 661,000 in September, the Labor Department said Friday in the final jobs report before the November election. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones expected a jobs gain of 800,000. The unemployment rate fell to 7.9% last month.\n*****\n&gt; The sell-off in oil prices intensified as Trump\u2019s coronavirus news added to the industry\u2019s demand concerns. West Texas Intermediate crude, the U.S. oil benchmark, slid 4.3% to $37.05 per barrel on Friday.\n*****\n&gt; Some on Wall Street said the markets overreacted to Trump\u2019s medical condition.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cInvestors should not panic over the news,\u201d Sean Darby, global equity strategist at Jefferies, said in a note. \u201cIt was a tail risk since other global leaders have contracted the virus, but the forthcoming US election should not be delayed in any way... 2020 has seen many 2, 3, and even 4 sigma events, and this political tail risk is by no means as big.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Stocks have staged a historic rebound since the economic shutdown sent stocks tumbling in March. But the major averages all finished September lower, snapping a five-month win streak, as doubts emerge about the pace and breadth of the recovery.\n*****\n&gt; Despite Friday\u2019s weakness, major averages all posted modest gains for the week. The 30-stock Dow gained 1.9%, while the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq rose 1.5% each this week.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/3J0V6o1.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/TI8ImmZ.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/90v084y.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/Ne7m07y.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/0UZt0DJ.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/HA7KsPc.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/NzmRLPp.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/eqS3Lk4.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!]())**\n(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/k9v1hZX.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/UtkozzH.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/KNI9qkQ.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/OM44UFj.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Make Up Your !@#$%^&amp;* Mind!\n\n&gt; We've all had versions of this conversation where you or the person you were talking to just couldn't make up their mind. At the end of the day, it only causes trouble and plans are ruined.\n\n&gt; The market is having its own back and forth this year trying to decide between growth and value. Just today, growth stocks are getting slaughtered while value stocks are up marginally. As an example, the Russell 1000 Growth index is down 1.8% on the day while the Russell 1000 Value index has managed to rally 0.25%. The chart below shows the daily performance spread between the Russell 1000 Growth index and the Russell 1000 Value index for each day in 2020. Today's performance spread between the two indices marks the ninth time this year that value has outperformed growth by more than two percentage points. At the other extreme, there have also been eight trading days where growth outperformed value by more than two percentage points.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/010220-Value-Growth-2020.png))**\n\n&gt; So how does this year's frequency of days where the performance spread between the two indices was more than two percentage points stack up to other years? The chart below shows the daily performance spread between the two indices going all the way back to 1990. Over the last thirty years, the only two periods where we saw a frequency of these large daily dislocations was back in 2008 and the period spanning 2000 and 2001. In fact, with 17 days this year where the performance spread between the two indices was greater than two percentage points, the only other years that saw a higher frequency of large dislocations were 2000 (54) and 2001 (28). If you think the market has been indecisive this year, in 2000 we saw these types of daily dislocations an average of once per week.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/010220-Value-Growth-All-Years.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Election Anxiety Weighs on October Market Performance\n\n&gt; October often evokes fear on Wall Street as memories are stirred of crashes in 1929, 1987, the 554-point drop on October 27, 1997, back-to-back massacres in 1978 and 1979, Friday the 13th in 1989 and the 733-point drop on October 15, 2008. During the week ending October 10, 2008, Dow lost 1,874.19 points (18.2%), the worst weekly decline in our database going back to 1901, in percentage terms. March 2020 now holds the dubious honor of producing the worst, second and third worst DJIA weekly point declines. The term \u201cOctoberphobia\u201d has been used to describe the phenomenon of major market drops occurring during the month. Market calamities can become a self-fulfilling prophecy, so stay on the lookout and don\u2019t get whipsawed if it happens.\n\n&gt; But October has become a turnaround month\u2014a \u201cbear killer\u201d if you will. Twelve post-WWII bear markets have ended in October: 1946, 1957, 1960, 1962, 1966, 1974, 1987, 1990, 1998, 2001, 2002 and 2011 (S&amp;P 500 declined 19.4%). However, eight were midterm bottoms. Over the last 21 years, October\u2019s performance has been solid. Average gains over the last 21-years range from 1.3% by Russell 1000 to 2.4% by NASDAQ. Small caps have still struggled though with Russell 2000 gaining a modest 0.5%\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/aba6ebb2f208cb4b7a30b5ef83275d92/74b7a456a8bd8bcd-fc/s400x600/fb3400cc8b8054a896bd8e031be58ee2872d9e24.jpg))**\n\n&gt; Election-year Octobers rank dead last for Dow, S&amp;P 500 (since 1952), NASDAQ (since 1972), Russell 1000, and Russell 2000 (since 1980). Eliminating gruesome 2008 from the calculation provides a moderate amount of relief, as rankings climb to mid pack. Should a meaningful decline materialize in October it is likely to be an excellent buying opportunity, especially for any depressed technology and small-cap shares.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # What Have Democratic Sweeps Meant for the S&amp;P 500?\n\n&gt; Headed into the first presidential debate Tuesday night, betting markets (ElectionBettingOdds.com) placed Democratic candidate Joe Biden as the slight favorite to take the White House in November. The debate resulted in Biden gaining another 5 percentage point chance of winning the Presidency. As of this morning, Biden's odds to win are at 59.8% versus Trump's odds of 38.9%. Additionally, Democrats are slight favorites to win control of the Senate (58.4% to 41.5%) and big favorites to maintain the House (82.8% to 17.1%). Given these odds, in the chart below we show the average performance of the S&amp;P 500 from the three months before Election Day through three months after Election Day for all election years post-WWII that resulted in a sweep of the executive and legislative branch by the Democrats.\n\n&gt; As shown, on average the S&amp;P 500 has been on the decline in the weeks leading up to Election Day, though in the days just before the Election there has been a small rally that sharply reverses once the results come in. After the initial post-Election drop, the market has trended a bit higher, but by three months after the Election, it has only found itself around the same levels as Election Day; on average a 2.6% loss versus where the index stood three months prior.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/09/093020-Dem-Sweeps3.png))**\n\n&gt; The composite shown above is comprised of six different years: 1948, 1960, 1964, 1976, 1992, and 2008. While on average the S&amp;P 500 has traded lower, it is not necessarily a sure-fire thing. For example, 1948 and 2008 were the only years that saw the S&amp;P 500 trade and stay significantly lower in the wake of the election. In 1976, there was similarly a sell-off in the immediate aftermath of the election, but the index did make its way back up to the highs of that six-month time frame later on albeit no new high was put in place. Meanwhile, 1960, 1964, and 1992 all saw the S&amp;P 500 run higher after the election even despite some periods of consolidation after initial moves higher. In our B.I.G. Tips report from Tuesday, we show these same charts for all Presidential election years post WWII including a look at the average performance given every potential election outcome.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/09/093020-Dem-Sweeps.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # How Current Returns Stack Up to History\n\n&gt; Even after September's weakness, the S&amp;P 500's trailing 12-month total return stood at an impressive 14.9%. Given the events of the last 12 months, one could even say that performance is remarkable. What's even crazier is that the S&amp;P 500's performance over the last 12 months is more than three times stronger than the 12 month period before that (+4.25%). The chart below compares the S&amp;P 500's annualized total returns over the last one, two, five, ten, and twenty years and compares that performance to the historical average return of the index over those same time periods.\n\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500's historical average 12-month return is 11.7%, so the current 14.9% gain exceeds that average by more than three full percentage points. Over a two-year window, though, the S&amp;P 500's annualized return of 9.4% is more than a full percentage point below the historical average. Looking further out, the S&amp;P 500's trailing five and ten-year annualized return has been much stronger than average, which makes sense given the long bull market we were in. Over a 20 year window, though, the S&amp;P 500 is only just starting to work off some of the declines from the dot-com bust and as a result, the 6.4% annualized gain is a four and a half percentage points below the long-term average of 10.9%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/100120-Monthly-Returns.png))**\n\n&gt; Below we show how the current performance of the S&amp;P 500 in each of the time frames shown compares to all other periods on a percentile basis. The S&amp;P 500's performance over the last year, ranks just below 56th percentile of all other periods, while the two-year performance ranks just below the 42nd percentile. Even as the five and ten-year periods have seen well above average returns, they still rank in just the mid-60s on a percentile basis. The S&amp;P 500's ranking over a 20-year time period is a completely different story ranking in single-digits on a percentile basis. Even with the equity market right near record highs, the last two decades have been forgettable for US equities.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/100120-Monthly-Returns-Ranks.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Seasonals Are Back In Style Again\n\n&gt; There is no denying that market seasonality has not worked so well this year. But we have been here before and history is on our side. Over the long term, intermediate term and short term market seasonality has suffered brief periods when seasonality was overridden by more powerful forces. The COVID pandemic and economic shutdown certainly qualifies. But it is only a matter of time until repetitive human behavior patterns and people and institutions return to moving money around in the usual daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly and seasonal patterns.\n\n&gt; The return of perennial September weakness is emblematic of a return to normal market behavior and a reflection of the fact that despite the continuing concerns about surges in coronavirus cases life is beginning to return to normal. In our area, about 25-30 miles north of New York City, our kids are beginning hybrid learning, playing rugby, lacrosse and other sports (yes with some COVID protocols, but tackling and facing-off), golf outings are happening and people are going to restaurants and out and about.\n\n&gt; The chart here shows the historical One-Year Pattern of the S&amp;P 500 Since 1950 versus 2020. The black line shows the seasonal pattern since 1950. The blue represents the pattern since 1988. We use 1988 as it is the first year after the 1987 Crash when the market underwent a major systemic change with the implementation of downside protection circuit breakers and collars. It is noteworthy how the seasonal pattern persists during both the 70-year and 31-year timeframes.\n\n&gt; 2020 is plotted on the right axis due to the magnitude of the move this year. The yellow box highlights the rebirth of seasonality this September, especially during this notoriously negative Week After Triple Witching Week as detailed page 108 of the 2020 Almanac, indicated by the two black arrows\n\n&gt; Years like 1980, 1982, 2009 and 2016 with unseasonably early weakness and bear markets like 2020 returned to normal seasonal patterns in short order. And years like 1954, 1958, 1980, 1982, 1995 and 2009 that exhibited double-digit gains in the Worst Six Months still proceeded to deliver further sizable gains in the subsequent Best Six Months (page 52, STA 2020). We believe the return of market seasonality is upon us. So remain cautious through the end of September and be alert to Octoberophobia, but remain ready to pounce on our Best Months Seasonal MACD Buy Signal, when it triggers.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/0a4a6ba18e7d903b198c8fa7d6cf8bc4/9c2d30c4da9ff340-d7/s500x750/eb0c36b5ff7eec394f463ca8420054c22a88010f.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending October 2nd, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiTS26b5YO8))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 10.4.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED.)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!]())**\n(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/DuBcN1Z.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 10.5.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 10.5.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday  10.6.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/zy3ktow.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 10.6.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/pt0NiLh.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 10.7.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/yaviiRp.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 10.7.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Vdaqsaj.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 10.8.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ipdesH4.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 10.8.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 10.9.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 10.9.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # (T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n**(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)** (T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n\n&gt; #([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](http://elite.finviz.com/chart.ashx?t=SPY&amp;ty=c&amp;ta=st_c,sch_200p,sma_50,sma_200,sma_20,sma_100,bb_20_2,rsi_b_14,macd_b_12_26_9,stofu_b_14_3_3&amp;p=d&amp;s=l))\n\n*****\n\n# DISCUSS!\n\nWhat are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?\n\n*****\n\nI hope you all have a wonderful weekend and a great trading week ahead r/StockMarket.",

        "selftext": "Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/smallstreetbets. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning October 5th, 2020.\n\n# **Trump\u2019s health and fiscal stimulus fight will steer the markets in the week ahead  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/02/trumps-health-and-the-fiscal-s.html)**\n*****\n&gt; President Donald Trump\u2019s health and the state of a fiscal stimulus package will be the main focus for markets in the coming week.\n*****\n&gt; In the early morning hours Friday, President Donald Trump tweeted that he and the first lady tested positive for Covid. Stocks sold off hard, but the S&amp;P 500 came off its lows in Friday trading and closed down just under 1%. It was up 1.5% for the week.\n*****\n&gt; The market was helped by signs that a stimulus package is still a possibility, after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi asked airlines not to furlough workers. She promised either a stand alone aid bill, or a bigger negotiated relief legislation that would help the industry.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe market is going to watch health updates from the White House medical staff, and it\u2019s going to watch how the president communicates with the public,\u201d said Julian Emanuel, head of equities and derivatives at BTIG. \u201cWill we see him in person in the next week in any form? What\u2019s his volume of tweets? All as a way to first gauge the severity of the case.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Trump and Melania Trump are reported to have mild cases, but as time goes on the market will turn to how the illness could impact the presidential election.\n*****\n&gt; Former Vice President Joe Biden gained slightly in the polls after the first debate Tuesday night, and now the calendar for further debates is in question. The market has seemingly warmed to Biden, and even though he would raise taxes, it is assumed Democrats would quickly pass a major infrastructure package if there is a Democratic sweep of Congress.\n*****\n&gt; Trump, however, is widely seen on Wall Street as stronger on the economy and better for markets.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWhat you\u2019ve done from a campaign perspective, is you\u2019ve taken away the thing that gives him the most energy - his ability to interact with crowds,\u201d said Emanuel. \u201cThe president had wanted to paint the economic recovery of the last three or four months as the cornerstone, and this basically puts the virus back as topic number 1, number 2 and number 3. And it\u2019s all the more so because the data is coming in weaker than expected.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; The market is fixated on the prospect of stimulus to help business, the unemployed and state and local governments. The House passed a $2.2 trillion package this week, but there is still no agreement with Republicans. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has pushed for a $1.6 trillion package.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think there\u2019s an underlying bid under the market because nobody wants to be super short if we get a stimulus approved, but you can\u2019t be too long in case his mild symptoms turn into severe symptoms,\u201d said Scott Redler, partner with T3live.com. \u201cWe\u2019re in a tough spot but overall we\u2019re still pretty constructive.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Emanuel said the fact the president is now ill could hurt confidence and slow down some of the improvement in the economy.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe underlying tone is, again, whether its directly or later, there\u2019s going to be stimulus,\u201d Emanuel said. \u201d\u2019Whether it\u2019s this month or November, this reinforces the need for stimulus because the president falling ill signals to, at the margin, the person whose thinking about going out to dinner to think again. It\u2019s a significant economic and psychological hindrance.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Also coming up in the week ahead is a speech Tuesday by Fed Chairman Jerome Powell to the National Association of Business Economists.\n*****\n&gt; Powell is also expected to push for the stimulus package to boost the economy so the recovery does not stall.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think his whole objective is to try to get Congress and the Administration to sign onto a fiscal rescue package,\u201d said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics. \u201cHe\u2019ll all but come out and say [the recovery] is not a \u2018V.\u2019 Without additional support from lawmakers, risks are pretty high that we backtrack. I think that\u2019s the kind of outlook he\u2019s going to give. It\u2019s going to be full-throated.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; September\u2019s employment report, released Friday, was seen by some as a warning that the economy is not rebounding as expected. There were 661,000 jobs added in September, well below the 800,000 expected.\n*****\n&gt; Besides Powell, there are a half dozen other Fed speakers. There are also minutes from the Fed\u2019s last minute released Wednesday afternoon.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/3J0V6o1.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/TI8ImmZ.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/90v084y.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/Ne7m07y.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/0UZt0DJ.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/HA7KsPc.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/NzmRLPp.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/eqS3Lk4.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/UBfJMYm.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/k9v1hZX.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/UtkozzH.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/KNI9qkQ.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/OM44UFj.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Make Up Your !@#$%^&amp;* Mind!\n\n&gt; We've all had versions of this conversation where you or the person you were talking to just couldn't make up their mind. At the end of the day, it only causes trouble and plans are ruined.\n\n&gt; The market is having its own back and forth this year trying to decide between growth and value. Just today, growth stocks are getting slaughtered while value stocks are up marginally. As an example, the Russell 1000 Growth index is down 1.8% on the day while the Russell 1000 Value index has managed to rally 0.25%. The chart below shows the daily performance spread between the Russell 1000 Growth index and the Russell 1000 Value index for each day in 2020. Today's performance spread between the two indices marks the ninth time this year that value has outperformed growth by more than two percentage points. At the other extreme, there have also been eight trading days where growth outperformed value by more than two percentage points.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/010220-Value-Growth-2020.png))**\n\n&gt; So how does this year's frequency of days where the performance spread between the two indices was more than two percentage points stack up to other years? The chart below shows the daily performance spread between the two indices going all the way back to 1990. Over the last thirty years, the only two periods where we saw a frequency of these large daily dislocations was back in 2008 and the period spanning 2000 and 2001. In fact, with 17 days this year where the performance spread between the two indices was greater than two percentage points, the only other years that saw a higher frequency of large dislocations were 2000 (54) and 2001 (28). If you think the market has been indecisive this year, in 2000 we saw these types of daily dislocations an average of once per week.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/010220-Value-Growth-All-Years.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Election Anxiety Weighs on October Market Performance\n\n&gt; October often evokes fear on Wall Street as memories are stirred of crashes in 1929, 1987, the 554-point drop on October 27, 1997, back-to-back massacres in 1978 and 1979, Friday the 13th in 1989 and the 733-point drop on October 15, 2008. During the week ending October 10, 2008, Dow lost 1,874.19 points (18.2%), the worst weekly decline in our database going back to 1901, in percentage terms. March 2020 now holds the dubious honor of producing the worst, second and third worst DJIA weekly point declines. The term \u201cOctoberphobia\u201d has been used to describe the phenomenon of major market drops occurring during the month. Market calamities can become a self-fulfilling prophecy, so stay on the lookout and don\u2019t get whipsawed if it happens.\n\n&gt; But October has become a turnaround month\u2014a \u201cbear killer\u201d if you will. Twelve post-WWII bear markets have ended in October: 1946, 1957, 1960, 1962, 1966, 1974, 1987, 1990, 1998, 2001, 2002 and 2011 (S&amp;P 500 declined 19.4%). However, eight were midterm bottoms. Over the last 21 years, October\u2019s performance has been solid. Average gains over the last 21-years range from 1.3% by Russell 1000 to 2.4% by NASDAQ. Small caps have still struggled though with Russell 2000 gaining a modest 0.5%\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/aba6ebb2f208cb4b7a30b5ef83275d92/74b7a456a8bd8bcd-fc/s400x600/fb3400cc8b8054a896bd8e031be58ee2872d9e24.jpg))**\n\n&gt; Election-year Octobers rank dead last for Dow, S&amp;P 500 (since 1952), NASDAQ (since 1972), Russell 1000, and Russell 2000 (since 1980). Eliminating gruesome 2008 from the calculation provides a moderate amount of relief, as rankings climb to mid pack. Should a meaningful decline materialize in October it is likely to be an excellent buying opportunity, especially for any depressed technology and small-cap shares.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # What Have Democratic Sweeps Meant for the S&amp;P 500?\n\n&gt; Headed into the first presidential debate Tuesday night, betting markets (ElectionBettingOdds.com) placed Democratic candidate Joe Biden as the slight favorite to take the White House in November. The debate resulted in Biden gaining another 5 percentage point chance of winning the Presidency. As of this morning, Biden's odds to win are at 59.8% versus Trump's odds of 38.9%. Additionally, Democrats are slight favorites to win control of the Senate (58.4% to 41.5%) and big favorites to maintain the House (82.8% to 17.1%). Given these odds, in the chart below we show the average performance of the S&amp;P 500 from the three months before Election Day through three months after Election Day for all election years post-WWII that resulted in a sweep of the executive and legislative branch by the Democrats.\n\n&gt; As shown, on average the S&amp;P 500 has been on the decline in the weeks leading up to Election Day, though in the days just before the Election there has been a small rally that sharply reverses once the results come in. After the initial post-Election drop, the market has trended a bit higher, but by three months after the Election, it has only found itself around the same levels as Election Day; on average a 2.6% loss versus where the index stood three months prior.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/09/093020-Dem-Sweeps3.png))**\n\n&gt; The composite shown above is comprised of six different years: 1948, 1960, 1964, 1976, 1992, and 2008. While on average the S&amp;P 500 has traded lower, it is not necessarily a sure-fire thing. For example, 1948 and 2008 were the only years that saw the S&amp;P 500 trade and stay significantly lower in the wake of the election. In 1976, there was similarly a sell-off in the immediate aftermath of the election, but the index did make its way back up to the highs of that six-month time frame later on albeit no new high was put in place. Meanwhile, 1960, 1964, and 1992 all saw the S&amp;P 500 run higher after the election even despite some periods of consolidation after initial moves higher. In our B.I.G. Tips report from Tuesday, we show these same charts for all Presidential election years post WWII including a look at the average performance given every potential election outcome.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/09/093020-Dem-Sweeps.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # How Current Returns Stack Up to History\n\n&gt; Even after September's weakness, the S&amp;P 500's trailing 12-month total return stood at an impressive 14.9%. Given the events of the last 12 months, one could even say that performance is remarkable. What's even crazier is that the S&amp;P 500's performance over the last 12 months is more than three times stronger than the 12 month period before that (+4.25%). The chart below compares the S&amp;P 500's annualized total returns over the last one, two, five, ten, and twenty years and compares that performance to the historical average return of the index over those same time periods.\n\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500's historical average 12-month return is 11.7%, so the current 14.9% gain exceeds that average by more than three full percentage points. Over a two-year window, though, the S&amp;P 500's annualized return of 9.4% is more than a full percentage point below the historical average. Looking further out, the S&amp;P 500's trailing five and ten-year annualized return has been much stronger than average, which makes sense given the long bull market we were in. Over a 20 year window, though, the S&amp;P 500 is only just starting to work off some of the declines from the dot-com bust and as a result, the 6.4% annualized gain is a four and a half percentage points below the long-term average of 10.9%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/100120-Monthly-Returns.png))**\n\n&gt; Below we show how the current performance of the S&amp;P 500 in each of the time frames shown compares to all other periods on a percentile basis. The S&amp;P 500's performance over the last year, ranks just below 56th percentile of all other periods, while the two-year performance ranks just below the 42nd percentile. Even as the five and ten-year periods have seen well above average returns, they still rank in just the mid-60s on a percentile basis. The S&amp;P 500's ranking over a 20-year time period is a completely different story ranking in single-digits on a percentile basis. Even with the equity market right near record highs, the last two decades have been forgettable for US equities.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/100120-Monthly-Returns-Ranks.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Seasonals Are Back In Style Again\n\n&gt; There is no denying that market seasonality has not worked so well this year. But we have been here before and history is on our side. Over the long term, intermediate term and short term market seasonality has suffered brief periods when seasonality was overridden by more powerful forces. The COVID pandemic and economic shutdown certainly qualifies. But it is only a matter of time until repetitive human behavior patterns and people and institutions return to moving money around in the usual daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly and seasonal patterns.\n\n&gt; The return of perennial September weakness is emblematic of a return to normal market behavior and a reflection of the fact that despite the continuing concerns about surges in coronavirus cases life is beginning to return to normal. In our area, about 25-30 miles north of New York City, our kids are beginning hybrid learning, playing rugby, lacrosse and other sports (yes with some COVID protocols, but tackling and facing-off), golf outings are happening and people are going to restaurants and out and about.\n\n&gt; The chart here shows the historical One-Year Pattern of the S&amp;P 500 Since 1950 versus 2020. The black line shows the seasonal pattern since 1950. The blue represents the pattern since 1988. We use 1988 as it is the first year after the 1987 Crash when the market underwent a major systemic change with the implementation of downside protection circuit breakers and collars. It is noteworthy how the seasonal pattern persists during both the 70-year and 31-year timeframes.\n\n&gt; 2020 is plotted on the right axis due to the magnitude of the move this year. The yellow box highlights the rebirth of seasonality this September, especially during this notoriously negative Week After Triple Witching Week as detailed page 108 of the 2020 Almanac, indicated by the two black arrows\n\n&gt; Years like 1980, 1982, 2009 and 2016 with unseasonably early weakness and bear markets like 2020 returned to normal seasonal patterns in short order. And years like 1954, 1958, 1980, 1982, 1995 and 2009 that exhibited double-digit gains in the Worst Six Months still proceeded to deliver further sizable gains in the subsequent Best Six Months (page 52, STA 2020). We believe the return of market seasonality is upon us. So remain cautious through the end of September and be alert to Octoberophobia, but remain ready to pounce on our Best Months Seasonal MACD Buy Signal, when it triggers.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/0a4a6ba18e7d903b198c8fa7d6cf8bc4/9c2d30c4da9ff340-d7/s500x750/eb0c36b5ff7eec394f463ca8420054c22a88010f.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending October 2nd, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiTS26b5YO8))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 10.4.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED.)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$DPZ** \n&gt; * **$PAYX** \n&gt; * **$RPM** \n&gt; * **$HELE** \n&gt; * **$AYI** \n&gt; * **$LEVI** \n&gt; * **$LW** \n&gt; * **$LNDC** \n&gt; * **$SAR** \n&gt; * **$EXFO** \n&gt; * **$RGP**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/UBfJMYm.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/E7qqUjk.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 10.5.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 10.5.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday  10.6.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/zy3ktow.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 10.6.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/pt0NiLh.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 10.7.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/yaviiRp.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 10.7.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Vdaqsaj.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 10.8.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ipdesH4.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 10.8.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 10.9.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 10.9.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Domino's Pizza, Inc. $433.78\n**Domino's Pizza, Inc.

        "selftext": "Good Friday evening to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning October 5th, 2020.\n\n# **Trump\u2019s health and fiscal stimulus fight will steer the markets in the week ahead  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/02/trumps-health-and-the-fiscal-s.html)**\n*****\n&gt; President Donald Trump\u2019s health and the state of a fiscal stimulus package will be the main focus for markets in the coming week.\n*****\n&gt; In the early morning hours Friday, President Donald Trump tweeted that he and the first lady tested positive for Covid. Stocks sold off hard, but the S&amp;P 500 came off its lows in Friday trading and closed down just under 1%. It was up 1.5% for the week.\n*****\n&gt; The market was helped by signs that a stimulus package is still a possibility, after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi asked airlines not to furlough workers. She promised either a stand alone aid bill, or a bigger negotiated relief legislation that would help the industry.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe market is going to watch health updates from the White House medical staff, and it\u2019s going to watch how the president communicates with the public,\u201d said Julian Emanuel, head of equities and derivatives at BTIG. \u201cWill we see him in person in the next week in any form? What\u2019s his volume of tweets? All as a way to first gauge the severity of the case.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Trump and Melania Trump are reported to have mild cases, but as time goes on the market will turn to how the illness could impact the presidential election.\n*****\n&gt; Former Vice President Joe Biden gained slightly in the polls after the first debate Tuesday night, and now the calendar for further debates is in question. The market has seemingly warmed to Biden, and even though he would raise taxes, it is assumed Democrats would quickly pass a major infrastructure package if there is a Democratic sweep of Congress.\n*****\n&gt; Trump, however, is widely seen on Wall Street as stronger on the economy and better for markets.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWhat you\u2019ve done from a campaign perspective, is you\u2019ve taken away the thing that gives him the most energy - his ability to interact with crowds,\u201d said Emanuel. \u201cThe president had wanted to paint the economic recovery of the last three or four months as the cornerstone, and this basically puts the virus back as topic number 1, number 2 and number 3. And it\u2019s all the more so because the data is coming in weaker than expected.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; The market is fixated on the prospect of stimulus to help business, the unemployed and state and local governments. The House passed a $2.2 trillion package this week, but there is still no agreement with Republicans. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has pushed for a $1.6 trillion package.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think there\u2019s an underlying bid under the market because nobody wants to be super short if we get a stimulus approved, but you can\u2019t be too long in case his mild symptoms turn into severe symptoms,\u201d said Scott Redler, partner with T3live.com. \u201cWe\u2019re in a tough spot but overall we\u2019re still pretty constructive.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Emanuel said the fact the president is now ill could hurt confidence and slow down some of the improvement in the economy.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe underlying tone is, again, whether its directly or later, there\u2019s going to be stimulus,\u201d Emanuel said. \u201d\u2019Whether it\u2019s this month or November, this reinforces the need for stimulus because the president falling ill signals to, at the margin, the person whose thinking about going out to dinner to think again. It\u2019s a significant economic and psychological hindrance.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Also coming up in the week ahead is a speech Tuesday by Fed Chairman Jerome Powell to the National Association of Business Economists.\n*****\n&gt; Powell is also expected to push for the stimulus package to boost the economy so the recovery does not stall.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think his whole objective is to try to get Congress and the Administration to sign onto a fiscal rescue package,\u201d said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics. \u201cHe\u2019ll all but come out and say [the recovery] is not a \u2018V.\u2019 Without additional support from lawmakers, risks are pretty high that we backtrack. I think that\u2019s the kind of outlook he\u2019s going to give. It\u2019s going to be full-throated.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; September\u2019s employment report, released Friday, was seen by some as a warning that the economy is not rebounding as expected. There were 661,000 jobs added in September, well below the 800,000 expected.\n*****\n&gt; Besides Powell, there are a half dozen other Fed speakers. There are also minutes from the Fed\u2019s last minute released Wednesday afternoon.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/3J0V6o1.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/TI8ImmZ.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/90v084y.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/Ne7m07y.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/0UZt0DJ.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/HA7KsPc.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/NzmRLPp.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/eqS3Lk4.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/UBfJMYm.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/k9v1hZX.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/UtkozzH.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/KNI9qkQ.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/OM44UFj.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Make Up Your !@#$%^&amp;* Mind!\n\n&gt; We've all had versions of this conversation where you or the person you were talking to just couldn't make up their mind. At the end of the day, it only causes trouble and plans are ruined.\n\n&gt; The market is having its own back and forth this year trying to decide between growth and value. Just today, growth stocks are getting slaughtered while value stocks are up marginally. As an example, the Russell 1000 Growth index is down 1.8% on the day while the Russell 1000 Value index has managed to rally 0.25%. The chart below shows the daily performance spread between the Russell 1000 Growth index and the Russell 1000 Value index for each day in 2020. Today's performance spread between the two indices marks the ninth time this year that value has outperformed growth by more than two percentage points. At the other extreme, there have also been eight trading days where growth outperformed value by more than two percentage points.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/010220-Value-Growth-2020.png))**\n\n&gt; So how does this year's frequency of days where the performance spread between the two indices was more than two percentage points stack up to other years? The chart below shows the daily performance spread between the two indices going all the way back to 1990. Over the last thirty years, the only two periods where we saw a frequency of these large daily dislocations was back in 2008 and the period spanning 2000 and 2001. In fact, with 17 days this year where the performance spread between the two indices was greater than two percentage points, the only other years that saw a higher frequency of large dislocations were 2000 (54) and 2001 (28). If you think the market has been indecisive this year, in 2000 we saw these types of daily dislocations an average of once per week.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/010220-Value-Growth-All-Years.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Election Anxiety Weighs on October Market Performance\n\n&gt; October often evokes fear on Wall Street as memories are stirred of crashes in 1929, 1987, the 554-point drop on October 27, 1997, back-to-back massacres in 1978 and 1979, Friday the 13th in 1989 and the 733-point drop on October 15, 2008. During the week ending October 10, 2008, Dow lost 1,874.19 points (18.2%), the worst weekly decline in our database going back to 1901, in percentage terms. March 2020 now holds the dubious honor of producing the worst, second and third worst DJIA weekly point declines. The term \u201cOctoberphobia\u201d has been used to describe the phenomenon of major market drops occurring during the month. Market calamities can become a self-fulfilling prophecy, so stay on the lookout and don\u2019t get whipsawed if it happens.\n\n&gt; But October has become a turnaround month\u2014a \u201cbear killer\u201d if you will. Twelve post-WWII bear markets have ended in October: 1946, 1957, 1960, 1962, 1966, 1974, 1987, 1990, 1998, 2001, 2002 and 2011 (S&amp;P 500 declined 19.4%). However, eight were midterm bottoms. Over the last 21 years, October\u2019s performance has been solid. Average gains over the last 21-years range from 1.3% by Russell 1000 to 2.4% by NASDAQ. Small caps have still struggled though with Russell 2000 gaining a modest 0.5%\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/aba6ebb2f208cb4b7a30b5ef83275d92/74b7a456a8bd8bcd-fc/s400x600/fb3400cc8b8054a896bd8e031be58ee2872d9e24.jpg))**\n\n&gt; Election-year Octobers rank dead last for Dow, S&amp;P 500 (since 1952), NASDAQ (since 1972), Russell 1000, and Russell 2000 (since 1980). Eliminating gruesome 2008 from the calculation provides a moderate amount of relief, as rankings climb to mid pack. Should a meaningful decline materialize in October it is likely to be an excellent buying opportunity, especially for any depressed technology and small-cap shares.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # What Have Democratic Sweeps Meant for the S&amp;P 500?\n\n&gt; Headed into the first presidential debate Tuesday night, betting markets (ElectionBettingOdds.com) placed Democratic candidate Joe Biden as the slight favorite to take the White House in November. The debate resulted in Biden gaining another 5 percentage point chance of winning the Presidency. As of this morning, Biden's odds to win are at 59.8% versus Trump's odds of 38.9%. Additionally, Democrats are slight favorites to win control of the Senate (58.4% to 41.5%) and big favorites to maintain the House (82.8% to 17.1%). Given these odds, in the chart below we show the average performance of the S&amp;P 500 from the three months before Election Day through three months after Election Day for all election years post-WWII that resulted in a sweep of the executive and legislative branch by the Democrats.\n\n&gt; As shown, on average the S&amp;P 500 has been on the decline in the weeks leading up to Election Day, though in the days just before the Election there has been a small rally that sharply reverses once the results come in. After the initial post-Election drop, the market has trended a bit higher, but by three months after the Election, it has only found itself around the same levels as Election Day; on average a 2.6% loss versus where the index stood three months prior.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/09/093020-Dem-Sweeps3.png))**\n\n&gt; The composite shown above is comprised of six different years: 1948, 1960, 1964, 1976, 1992, and 2008. While on average the S&amp;P 500 has traded lower, it is not necessarily a sure-fire thing. For example, 1948 and 2008 were the only years that saw the S&amp;P 500 trade and stay significantly lower in the wake of the election. In 1976, there was similarly a sell-off in the immediate aftermath of the election, but the index did make its way back up to the highs of that six-month time frame later on albeit no new high was put in place. Meanwhile, 1960, 1964, and 1992 all saw the S&amp;P 500 run higher after the election even despite some periods of consolidation after initial moves higher. In our B.I.G. Tips report from Tuesday, we show these same charts for all Presidential election years post WWII including a look at the average performance given every potential election outcome.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/09/093020-Dem-Sweeps.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # How Current Returns Stack Up to History\n\n&gt; Even after September's weakness, the S&amp;P 500's trailing 12-month total return stood at an impressive 14.9%. Given the events of the last 12 months, one could even say that performance is remarkable. What's even crazier is that the S&amp;P 500's performance over the last 12 months is more than three times stronger than the 12 month period before that (+4.25%). The chart below compares the S&amp;P 500's annualized total returns over the last one, two, five, ten, and twenty years and compares that performance to the historical average return of the index over those same time periods.\n\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500's historical average 12-month return is 11.7%, so the current 14.9% gain exceeds that average by more than three full percentage points. Over a two-year window, though, the S&amp;P 500's annualized return of 9.4% is more than a full percentage point below the historical average. Looking further out, the S&amp;P 500's trailing five and ten-year annualized return has been much stronger than average, which makes sense given the long bull market we were in. Over a 20 year window, though, the S&amp;P 500 is only just starting to work off some of the declines from the dot-com bust and as a result, the 6.4% annualized gain is a four and a half percentage points below the long-term average of 10.9%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/100120-Monthly-Returns.png))**\n\n&gt; Below we show how the current performance of the S&amp;P 500 in each of the time frames shown compares to all other periods on a percentile basis. The S&amp;P 500's performance over the last year, ranks just below 56th percentile of all other periods, while the two-year performance ranks just below the 42nd percentile. Even as the five and ten-year periods have seen well above average returns, they still rank in just the mid-60s on a percentile basis. The S&amp;P 500's ranking over a 20-year time period is a completely different story ranking in single-digits on a percentile basis. Even with the equity market right near record highs, the last two decades have been forgettable for US equities.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/100120-Monthly-Returns-Ranks.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Seasonals Are Back In Style Again\n\n&gt; There is no denying that market seasonality has not worked so well this year. But we have been here before and history is on our side. Over the long term, intermediate term and short term market seasonality has suffered brief periods when seasonality was overridden by more powerful forces. The COVID pandemic and economic shutdown certainly qualifies. But it is only a matter of time until repetitive human behavior patterns and people and institutions return to moving money around in the usual daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly and seasonal patterns.\n\n&gt; The return of perennial September weakness is emblematic of a return to normal market behavior and a reflection of the fact that despite the continuing concerns about surges in coronavirus cases life is beginning to return to normal. In our area, about 25-30 miles north of New York City, our kids are beginning hybrid learning, playing rugby, lacrosse and other sports (yes with some COVID protocols, but tackling and facing-off), golf outings are happening and people are going to restaurants and out and about.\n\n&gt; The chart here shows the historical One-Year Pattern of the S&amp;P 500 Since 1950 versus 2020. The black line shows the seasonal pattern since 1950. The blue represents the pattern since 1988. We use 1988 as it is the first year after the 1987 Crash when the market underwent a major systemic change with the implementation of downside protection circuit breakers and collars. It is noteworthy how the seasonal pattern persists during both the 70-year and 31-year timeframes.\n\n&gt; 2020 is plotted on the right axis due to the magnitude of the move this year. The yellow box highlights the rebirth of seasonality this September, especially during this notoriously negative Week After Triple Witching Week as detailed page 108 of the 2020 Almanac, indicated by the two black arrows\n\n&gt; Years like 1980, 1982, 2009 and 2016 with unseasonably early weakness and bear markets like 2020 returned to normal seasonal patterns in short order. And years like 1954, 1958, 1980, 1982, 1995 and 2009 that exhibited double-digit gains in the Worst Six Months still proceeded to deliver further sizable gains in the subsequent Best Six Months (page 52, STA 2020). We believe the return of market seasonality is upon us.

        "selftext": "**PART 1/4 - FREE MARKET?**\n\nFirst off, let's set the scene.\n\nThe stock market is telling you nothing about the real economy anymore.\n\nEconomic fundamentals have never mattered as little for the stock market as has been the case during this 11-year bull market.\n\nThe correlation between gross-domestic-product growth and the direction of the S&amp;P 500 Index has only been 7% in this cycle - historically it has been 30% to 70%.\n\nWhy?\n\nWell, it is the Central\u00a0Banks, led by the Fed, who printed their way out of the Recession in '08.\n\nIn doing so, they have papered over the cracks, and we have seen the longest economic expansion in US history.\n\nHowever, this is not a particularly\u00a0meritocratic process: money creation itself increases inequality via the [Cantillon Effect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv5xl1AEeQs), as money printing leads to asset price inflation, which disproportionately benefits the rich and hurts the poor.\n\nFormer Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker told the New York Times in 2018:\n\n*\u201cThe central issue is we\u2019re developing into a plutocracy. We\u2019ve got an enormous number of enormously rich people that have convinced themselves that they\u2019re rich because they\u2019re smart and constructive.\"*\n\nThe reality of course is that this is largely not the case - it is because the game is rigged in their favour.\n\nNow, it is important to emphasise the fact that the path we have taken has resulted in the highest living standards we have seen in human history.\n\n*However*, the issue, particularly since the US completely abandoned the gold standard in 1971, is that debt has exploded to obscene levels.\n\nWe are not operating in a free market if it takes $185 trillion of debt over the last 20 years to create 'growth'.\n\nIn fact, the global debt to GDP ratio hit an all-time high of 322% in the third quarter of 2019.\n\nInflation means that your dollar loses value and thus your purchasing power goes down.\n\nDeflation means that the value of your dollar goes up and your purchasing power goes up.\n\nThat's a good thing right? You get more goods and services for less.\n\nWell, no.\n\nIf you have deflation, debt explodes in real terms and you can never pay it back.\n\nAs the economy is based on debt, if you allow deflation, then you have to reset the debt.\u00a0\n\nThis is why central banks fear deflation so much.\n\nHowever, the major force driving the human race is technological progress - and this stops for no mortal...\n\n**PART 2/4 - TECHNOLOGICAL DEFLATION:**\n\nThe increased abundance created by technology will result in massive job losses.\n\n[Throughout history](https://timeline.com/robots-have-been-about-to-take-all-the-jobs-for-more-than-200-years-5c9c08a2f41d), doom porn enthusiasts have screamed that the machines are coming for jobs. This is *not* a new phenomenon.\n\nAll technological revolutions are deflationary - since they create \"supply side shocks\", meaning that they allow for more intensive\u00a0use of resources\u00a0and thus higher production. With more goods being produced, all other things being equal, the price of those goods will fall.\u00a0\n\nIn the last 20 years or so, software has disrupted and replaced many established goods and services.\n\nIt is in the *next 20 years* that another disruptive technology is set to take the stage: AI\n\nAccording to Steve Schwarzman, the co-founder and CEO of The Blackstone Group who has a net worth of $17.6BN:\n\n*\"This is going to touch everyone's life....you're not going to be able to get away from this technology\"*\n\nMoreover, this virus will only accelerate this trend towards tech. [Zoom is a fantastic example](https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-zoom/zoom-pulls-in-more-than-200-million-daily-video-users-during-worldwide-lockdowns-idUKKBN21K1C7) of exactly this.\n\nOld legacy economic systems were not built for this tech deflation, and the thing about exponential growth is that we humans do not intuitively understand it.\u00a0\n\nAs an example, if you folded a piece of paper 51 times, of course you can only fold it seven times, but if you could fold it 51 times, it would reach the Sun!\n\n**PART 3/4 - IMPLICATIONS FOR SOCIETY:**\n\nThe question is: how does this play out?\n\nIn the long term, it is the fundamental structure of the economic system that has a significant impact on people's lives, not\u00a0who is President for 4 to 8 years.\n\nIn reality, politicians have limited power and are effectively all puppets. We have seen [what happens when a President doesn't stay in their lane](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q91RZko5Gw)...\n\nOne could argue that the two main mechanisms of control are:\n\n1. Divide and Conquer and\n2. [Order from Chaos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfx7PnMtCeY)\n\nAs we have seen many times in the past, herd psychology is [worryingly easy to manipulate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M26-B44qQIs)...\n\nSpeaking of the censorship, in his book Antifragile, Nassim Taleb discusses the anti fragility of information.\u00a0\n\nInformation feeds more on attempts to harm it than it does on efforts to promote it.\n\nA fantastic example of this process is what has happened with London Real: they were banned on LinkedIn and David Icke's interview was censored. Now, regardless of what you think of this particular channel or your thoughts on David Icke and the theories provided, censoring information in this way *actually spreads it more virally*.\n\nIt's fascinating to observe how many views the videos regarding the bans and censorship have relative to the others. And the [impact this has had on subscribers](https://socialblade.com/youtube/user/londonrealtv).\n\nIt is always easier to blame a bigger enemy (or create a new one) rather than to admit it's a structural problem.\n\nTherefore, you avoid short term pain...whatever the cost.\n\nThe real question is [if and when this situation will lead to social unrest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4GMUamUjT8)...\n\n**PART 4/4 - INTELLECTUAL CAPITALISM:**\n\nThe depth and width of jobs impacted by AI will continue to increase in the future.\n\nNow this will not necessarily happen straight away.\n\nHowever, our transition from commodity capitalism to intellectual capitalism is inevitable and the people and nations who fight against this trend will be on the wrong side of history.\n\nFrom a practical investment perspective, and disclaimer this is not investment advice, network effects are a crucial aspect to consider moving forwards.\n\nEssentially, this means that the value of the network\u00a0increases with each additional user - all of the tech monopolies have exhibited this property.\n\nAn asset which could in time demonstrate very strong network effects is Bitcoin.\n\n[Looking at the market cap relative to other asset classes](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/worlds-money-markets-one-visualization-2017/), Bitcoin provides an asymmetric investment opportunity.\n\nOnly time will tell...\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nFbKzt-uwE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nFbKzt-uwE)",

They are going to list in Nasdaq pretty soon, i would think around end of November/early December. They have 15 out of 20 biggest pharma companies as their clients. They have a good growth story through their primary CRO business model. But what is making it really exciting in the short term is their covid antibody programs.

        "selftext": "Lou Pai was a recluse.\n\nExtremely introverted.\n\nVery reserved.\n\nThat is...inside the office.\n\nOutside the office...\n\nPai symbolised the legendary lavishness and excesses of Enron's corporate culture.\n\nEven though he was married, he would spend inordinate amounts of time during and after working hours at the strip club.\n\nHe would use the Enron corporate jet for personal commuting.\n\nAnd he would charge several hundred dollars worth of lunches for himself and friends to the corporate expense account (i.e. he was living the so called American Dream).\n\nThe Enron Scandal surfaced in October 2001 when it was revealed that America's seventh largest company was involved in corporate corruption and accounting fraud. \n\nThe scandal surrounding the Enron energy company had political implications due to Enron's close links with the White House. The Deregulation of Enron allowed the corporation to operate largely free from US government scrutiny. There was also misrepresentation in earnings reports, a fraudulent 'energy crisis' and embezzlement by Enron Executives. \n\n***The Enron scandal eventually led to the bankruptcy of the company, and Enron shareholders lost $74 billion leading up to its bankruptcy, and Enron's employees lost their jobs and billions of dollars in pension benefits.*** \n\n***Enron CEO Jeff Skilling was sentenced to 24 years in prison, former CEO Kenneth Lay died from a massive heart attack before serving time. Another Enron executive, Clifford Baxter, committed suicide in 2002 shortly before he was due to testify before Congress.***\n\n***But what about Lou Pai?***\n\nPai joined Enron in 1987, when it was just a regional energy supplier.\n\nHe became one of future CEO Jeff Skilling's top lieutenants, primarily tasked with detailing and implementing Skilling's vision of transforming Enron into a de facto energy commodities-trading firm.\n\nDuring his Enron career, Skilling put Pai in charge of multiple Enron subsidiaries.\n\nPai was CEO of the EES (Enron Energy Services) subsidiary from March 1997 until May 2001.\n\n***Pai's frequent strip club visits during his time at Enron proved to be a blessing in disguise.***\n\nIt led to an affair with stripper Melanie Fewell (who was also married) and resulted in a pregnancy.\n\nUpon learning of the affair, Pai's then-wife of over 20 years Lanna, with whom he has two children, filed for divorce.\n\nThis is the crazy part:\n\n***To satisfy the financial terms of his divorce settlement, Pai cashed out $250 million of his Enron stock, just months before the company's stock price collapsed.***\n\nPai's early sell-off shielded him from the insider trading charges levelled against other Enron executives who had also secretly sold-off large amounts of stock before the company's financial situation was publicly known.\n\nSomehow, through sheer luck (or was it!), Pai had managed to secure a win for himself, his ex-wife and his new wife, Melanie Pai.\n\n***While his colleagues were in jail or dead, Pai was using his new found wealth to become the second-largest land owner in Colorado after he purchased the 77500-acre Taylor Ranch for $23 million in 1999. He sold the property in June 2004 for $60 million.***\n\nPai did have to cough up some cash though:\n\nIn 2008, he agreed to resolve civil insider trading charges against him with an out-of-court settlement of $31.5 million.\n\nPai was not charged with any *criminal* wrongdoing in the Enron scandal and exercised his 5th Amendment rights in the subsequent Enron class action lawsuits.\n\n***But still, it's fair to say that the tale of Lou Pai offers a lesson for corporate executives looking to use divorce as a hustle to liquidate their stock holdings without upsetting regulators or shareholders.***\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3UOuhRXys8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3UOuhRXys8)",

        "selftext": "Hey folks! I've put together an educational series that ties investing with this new budding industry so I figured since I'm done 4  of the 8 episodes, time to share it in Weedstocks :D\n\nI  started investing in LPs in 2018 when I had no clue what I was doing  (got lucky selling ACB before legalization, now I hold APHA and TBP  long) . However I've paid attention over time and many external factors  point to this dip being the bottom so I figured this is the right time  to capitalize and put this series together so other new investors can  get up to speed.\n\nI can only make one post a week so I will post the video on Canada next week. Here is the US:\n\nTop US Cannabis Companies Right Now\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuKzVFpXFn4&amp;t=10s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuKzVFpXFn4&amp;t=10s)\n\nEnjoy responsibly! Any feedback would be great as well as I'm self taught and  learn more everyday but I'm always looking to improve by ability to do  fundamental analysis better.
