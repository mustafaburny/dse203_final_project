End result: easy money. \n\nTSM: High 107 was the previous swing low--refer to above rule--end result: TSM respected said TA rule. \n\nConclusion: 1) Play tickers that respect rules. 2) Even if the money is free, it does not mean you have to pick them up, you simply don't want to blow up your account. And remember, you are only a 100% winner until you aren't.\n\n[Will Fully Expire worthless in 21 minutes, time now 14:19 PST](https://preview.redd.it/76exv5hynwq71.png?width=1114&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1b672653c535ed44cf2443d81e24eaecbd3548d9)",
