        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, August 4, 2021**\n\nToday was another choppy day, with stocks ending the day mixed, with the Nasdaq (QQQ) climbing 0.14% while the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Dow Jones (DIA) fell 0.48% and 0.89% respectively. The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-cap stocks, fell 1.25%. It seems market participants were disappointed by a report from ADP, a leading employment services company, which estimated that private employers added half the expected amount of jobs in July. This sets a negative backdrop for the official July Jobs Report, set to be released this Friday. \n\nADP, a leading payroll and human services software company, released its July 2021 Employment Report, which estimated that private employers added only 330,000 jobs in July, less than half the 690,000 gain expected by economists. While ADP\u2019s report isn\u2019t 100% accurate, it\u2019s usually fairly close and sets a negative backdrop for the official July Job Report on Friday. ADP\u2019s report shows that the labor market imbalances stemming from the coronavirus pandemic remain. Moreover, with concerns surrounding the Delta variant increasing, that could be a relatively new factor adding more pressure. Here is the entire report: [https://adpemploymentreport.com/](https://adpemploymentreport.com/)\n\nConcerns surrounding the highly contagious coronavirus Delta variant continue to rise, with Florida emerging as the US\u2019 new epicenter for the disease. Cases in Florida have jumped dramatically, going from 2432 on July 1 to 38,776 on July 30 and have so far had three consecutive days of record infections. Thankfully, however, despite the surge in cases, the death rate has so far remained stable and relatively low, a sign that the vaccines are very effective at preventing hospitalizations and serious death. \n\nSo far, 59% of the companies in the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) have reported Q2 earnings, with 88% of these beating analyst expectations, according to FactSet. This quarter is shaping up to be another record-breaking one, with corporate earnings growth rate expected to accelerate 85%, which would be the biggest jump since the Q4 2009. \n\nHowever, it is important to note that, despite beating earnings expectations, a number of these companies have pulled back, with tepid outlooks moving forward overshadowing strong results. Moving forward, given that most companies have so far exceeded pre-pandemic levels and the current quarter has an easy comparison to last year, expectations for growth are inevitably going to moderate. This said, I think the pullback in some stocks following earnings is an overreaction. \n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Shares of Lyft (LYFT) fell roughly 10% despite posting its first profitable quarter. Earnings are very weird.\n* Shares of GM slipped 8% after posting earnings.\n* Shares of NovaVax (NVAX) gapped up roughly 20$ after the company announced an agreement with the EU to sell up to 200 million COVID vaccines. \n* Shares of some Chinese companies somewhat after pulling back yesterday following signaling that the CCP may be targeting video game companies next as the regulatory crackdown on tech stocks continues. Yesterday, shares of Tencent (TCEHY) and other tech stocks fell after a state-media called video games \"spiritual opium\". This prompted Tencent to say it will limit gaming time for minors and may even ban those under 12 from its platform. \n* Shares of Robinhood (HOOD) gapped up again today, rising roughly 50% today.\n* Federal Reserve Vice Chair Richard Clarida said Wednesday the central bank is still on track to begin raising rates off their current near-zero levels in 2023, as long as the economic recovery remains on its current trajectory. He said \u201cWhile, as Chair Powell indicated last week, we are clearly a ways away from considering raising interest rates and this is certainly not something on the radar screen right now, if the outlook for inflation and outlook for unemployment I summarized earlier turn out to be the actual outcomes for inflation and unemployment realized over the forecast horizon, then I believe that these three necessary conditions for raising the target range for the federal funds rate will have been met by year-end 2022.\u201d\n* \\*\\***Please note that current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect closing prices\\*\\***\n* Akami Technologies (AKAM) with two target raises.

I would like to invest in one of this list:\n\n* SOXX (iShares Semiconductor ETF)\n* SMH (VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF)\n* SOXL (Direxion Daily Semiconductor Bull 3x Shares)\n* PSI (Invesco Dynamic Semiconductors ETF)\n* USD (ProShares Ultra Semiconductors)\n\nyou can consult the reports/data of these various ETFs [here](https://etfdb.com/etfs/industry/semiconductors/).\n\nI really believe that in the long run it will give me a lot of profits, ie integrated circuits, cpus, gpus, sensors and hardware accelerators are our past, present and will be our future !! These ETFs have shares of AMD, Nvidia, Xilinx, NXP, Microchip, Texas Instruments, Maxim Integrated, ASML, TSMC, qorvo, STMicroeletronics...\n\nWill my only solution be to create a pie on the T212 broker similar to these ETFs and invest there? I don't like the T212 very much because they are still very amateur and don't support several important features like merges. For example, if I acquire shares of AMD and Xilinx and AMD's acquisition of Xilinx goes through, they won't be able to merge and sell as my shares of Xilinx without telling me like how it happened to several people holding shares in Tilray and Apharia.",

        "selftext": "Most investors have probably never heard of exosomes until Codiak\u2019s (NASDAQ: CDAK) chief exec, Doug Williams, made his pitch about this cool molecules at the JP Morgan conference two weeks ago. So for starters, let's define what is an exosome. Exosomes are extracellular vesicles (EVs) of endosomal origin that range in size between 30 and 150nm. Exosomes are secreted by a wide range of cells, since virtually all living cells utilize exosome-mediated communication. Exosomes carry cell-specific cargos of proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids that are selectively taken up by recipient cells.  In essence, these are a critical building block of organic life and have a myriad of unexplored biopharma applications.  \n\nThe cargo contained within exosomes can offer information for a wide range of diseases, therefore exosomes can also act as prognostic indicators and predictors of a patient\u2019s response to a specific course of treatment.  Exosome-based diagnostics are minimally invasive, offering both ease-of-use and speed of detection. Numerous approaches are being researched for creating drug-loaded exosomes and they can exert powerful effects. For example, if a patient has a disease caused by a missing or defective protein or microRNA, the patient\u2019s exosomes can be isolated, modified with the appropriate siRNA or protein, and injected back into the patient for treatment.\n\nFor these reasons, exosomes have gone from being overlooked to rapidly gaining momentum as a novel strategy for accessing the therapeutic effects of cells without the risks and difficulties of administering cells to patients.  Exosome-related technologies have been developing rapidly over the past few years. Substantial growth is expected for the market as they get highly integrated into the elite healthcare fields such as liquid biopsy, precision medicine and regenerative medicine.\n\nWithin the past 5 years, there have been at least 7 major partnership deals within the exosome industry, 8 large venture capital events, and 2 landmark acquisitions.  Today, the exosome industry is witnessing rising numbers of clinicals trials investigating exosome therapeutics and diagnostics. Here are some listed companies taking exosome science to the next level:\n\n**Innocan Pharma (CSE: INNO) (FSE: IP4) (OTCQB: INNPF) Combining Exosomes &amp; CBD**\n\nInnocan Pharma, in collaboration with a Tel Aviv university team, is developing a revolutionary cell therapy - based technology, loaded with CBD (Cannabidiol), designed to target coronavirus infected lung cells and central nervous system diseases. Innocan\u2019s CLX Therapy holds the potential to provide a highly synergistic effect of anti-inflammatory properties and help in the recovery of infected lung cells. This product is planned to act as a \"guided missile\" to the infected lungs, combining the cell healing properties of exosomes and the anti-inflammatory properties of CBD.\n\nInnocan's CBD Loaded Exosome (CLX) Therapy project demonstrates the capability of having reliable large-scale production of exosomes and is an important milestone in the CLX Therapy development process. Innocan managed to produce trillions of exosomes in a short period of time in a 3-dimensional bioreactor, and that may lead to economic large-scale exosome production for the CLX. This achievement is expected to pave the way for larger tests and studies.  Combine its CLX program R&amp; with their established credentials as a cannabis/CBD powerhouse, and in a final evaluation this company holds a lot of long-term promise for making strong and early inroads into the exosome market.\n\n**Sarepta Therapeutics (NASDAQ: SRPT) and Codiak BioSciences (NASDAQ: CDAK)**\n\nOn June 22, 2020, Sarepta Therapeutics and Codiak BioSciences signed a global research and option agreement to design and develop engineered exosome therapeutics to deliver gene therapy, gene editing and RNA technologies for neuromuscular diseases. The engineered exosome approach offers the potential to effectively deliver genetic therapeutics without triggering the adaptive immune response. The two-year agreement includes up to five neuromuscular targets. Codiak is eligible to receive up to $72.5 million in upfront and near-term license payments plus research funding.  That equates to a lot of capital that, if invested wisely, can go back into research for the next generation of exosome studies and clinical trials.\n\n**Jazz Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: JAZZ) and Codiak BioSciences (NASDAQ: CDAK)**\n\nOn January 03, 2019, Jazz Pharmaceuticals and Codiak BioSciences signed a strategic collaboration agreement focused on the research, development and commercialization of exosome therapeutics to treat cancer. Codiak granted Jazz an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing license to develop, manufacture and commercialize therapeutic candidates directed at five targets to be developed using Codiak\u2019s engEx precision engineering platform for exosome therapeutics. The targets focus on oncogenes that have been well validated in hematological malignancies and solid tumors but have been undruggable with current modalities. Codiak received a $56 million upfront payment.\n\nIn sum, the companies explored above are all approaching the budding exosome industry from different angles.  Innocan\u2019s point-of-departure is CBD and its range of applications in the biomed/pharma sectors. Likewise, Codiak, Sarepta, and Jazz are all making powermoves to determine the efficacy of exosome therapies in diverse areas such as immune disorders and hematological malignancies.",
