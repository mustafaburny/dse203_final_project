I'm in devOps, teams is the future. \n\nThey've partnered with $ZM to create an enterprise version of the app, caveat being they named it poorly so people think it's what's made for blackberry phones.\n\n\nSome other partners\nBell Canada, Service$NOW, Space force, Canadian Gov, $AMZN, Canoo, Qcomm, Land rover\n\nMore good news:\n\nPatents, they're one of the largest patent holding companies in the world. Rumour has it that they're selling most of it.\n\nHeard of $FB and messenger?\n\nThey just recently lost a patent battle in November to blackberry that disallows them from switching from games to messaging apps.\n\nThe revenue story:\n\nThey \"only\" make 800-1b annually, about what Palantir makes IIRC.\n\nThis\u00a0quarter\u00a0should\u00a0be\u00a0interesting\u00a0because\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0hiring\u00a0of\u00a0Tom\u00a0from\u00a0Citrix.\n\nWhy they haven't mooned yet:\n\n--They're regarded as the phone company\n\n--No rev growth yet",
