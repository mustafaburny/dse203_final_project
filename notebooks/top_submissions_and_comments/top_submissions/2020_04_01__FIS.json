        "selftext": "After having spent over 10 years working for the most prestigious names in the financial industry and having witnessed\u00a0first hand\u00a0two large financial stress periods (the Global Financial Crisis and the European Debt Crisis)\u00a0 here are my ten suggestions you may potentially consider while investing\n\n [https://bankeronwheels.com/covid-19-investing-in-bear-market-crash-bottom/](https://bankeronwheels.com/covid-19-investing-in-bear-market-crash-bottom/) \n\n## 1. Buy gradually on the way down\n\nIf you have directly or indirectly prepared for a period of financial stress and have available cash you may consider starting investing now. A good strategy is to build rules and stick to them \u2013 either based on **certain index levels** e.g. S&amp;P 500 at 2500 invest 20% of savings, 2300 another 20% etc. or **based on timing** (slicing every few weeks since we have no clarity which way the market may go and when it will bottom out)\n\n## 2. Do not chase an upward trend in a bear market\n\nOne of the **common mistakes** we see is **people chasing upward trends** because of **FOMO \u2013 Fear of Missing Out** (when stock market recovers for a few days giving hope of long term gains). It takes more courage to buy according to predefined rules which often means buying when everything is gloomy and stocks lose massively. But in the long term it pays off. Do not be tempted by rebounds that may prove short-lived\n\n## 3. Do not try to time the market\n\nEven the best investors struggle with market timing. In fact most hedge funds (even the most prestigious ones) made substantial losses in the few past weeks.\n\nThe market can turn rapidly both ways and while you may avoid some bad days avoiding just a few good ones can be extremely detrimental to your long term performance as illustrated by a study done by Fidelity.\u00a0\n\nIt is extremely **risky to use leverage today since additional debt implies you must be correct on timing**\n\n## 4. Invest, do not speculate\n\nYou may not get spectacular 300-400% returns but your money will be relatively safe if you base your decisions on sound financial statements and diversify. **ETFs are a great way to invest in indices without taking idiosyncratic risk** (e.g. Luckin Coffee (see right) recently dropped 80% in one day on uncovered fraud \u2013 as Warren Buffett says \u201cOnly when the tide goes out do you discover who\u2019s been swimming naked\u201d).\u00a0\n\n**Ask yourself the question \u2013 am I more qualified than a professional investor** to predict which industry player may outperform the rest of the market? Do I know how the landscape post crisis will look like? Even if you suspect knowing first order effects are you sure of the second and higher order effect (to Nicholas Taleb\u2019s point)?\n\n## 5. Avoid binary outcomes\n\nEach crisis has its own most **vulnerable industries where outcomes can be binary \u2013** in 2008 some Banks went out of business and as an investor you may have lost everything. The Coronavirus crisis has other prime candidates for such outcomes, **airlines** can be nationalised and **hotel**/**tourism** industry players can go bankrupt should the distress last longer. You want to avoid these investments until there is more clarity on consumer confidence\n\n## 6. Look for financially resilient firms\n\nIf you do invest in single names, do not believe blindly in potentially meaningless dividend yields based on past data unless it has been confirmed by the management after incorporating all the outlook related to Covid-19. Instead look at **balance sheets with low debt and build-in resilience (cash)**. These firms may outperform and even acquire weaker competitors in the current environment\n\n## 7. Cash is King\n\nRay Dalio now infamously said a couple of months ago that \u2018Cash is Trash\u2019. While he is one of the best thinkers in Finance the remark was badly timed. Even in the most conservative scenarios keep some reserves. This is primarily a health crisis and while an economic crisis unfolds having a safety net is paramount. Additional unforeseen **tail risks always exists**\n\n## 8. Diversify in other assets including currencies, commodities and high quality debt products\n\nIt is difficult to predict which countries may relatively outperform. **Keep your portfolio diversified** geographically (e.g. Asia, Europe, US) and product-wise potentially including commodities like Gold that may outperform in low real rates / high inflation environments. Consider very high quality debt products (Treasuries or Investment Grade Debt)\n\n## 9. Stay informed but remain cautious\n\nAnd adjust your strategies accordingly. But be very careful with financial experts and consensus \u2013 **when you see opinions converging usually something else will happen**\n\n## 10. Duration of the coronavirus pandemic is key\n\nThe risks are still skewed to the downside. While there is an attractive discount to peak market values and positive catalysts may materialise (most pharmas are working on Coronavirus vaccines and mitigating drugs) the time it takes and the change of behaviour will alter the markets significantly. **The impact on people\u2019s health even when cured and society at large is at this stage highly uncertain. Stay safe and healthy!** \\[Read [this](https://johnhcochrane.blogspot.com/2020/04/whack-mole-long-run-virus.html) post about potential way out\\]",

        "selftext": "One day last September an unidentified trader pumped more than $3 billion into a tech fund run by State Street Corp. Two days later that trader pulled out a similar amount.\n\nWhy would someone make such a large bet\u2014five times bigger than any previous transaction in the fund\u2014and then reverse it so quickly? It turns out that transfusions like these are tax dodges, carried out by the world\u2019s largest asset managers with help from investment banks. The beneficiaries are the long-term investors in exchange-traded funds. Such trades, nicknamed \u201cheartbeats,\u201d are rampant across the\u00a0$4 trillion U.S. ETF market, with more than 500 made in the past year. One ETF manager calls them the industry\u2019s \u201cdirty little secret.\u201d\n\nTypically, when you sell a stock for more than you paid, you owe tax on the gain. But thanks to a quirk in a\u00a0Nixon-era tax law, funds can avoid that tax if they use the stock to pay off a withdrawing fund investor. Heartbeats come into play when there isn\u2019t an exiting investor handy. A fund manager asks a friendly bank to create extra withdrawals by rapidly pumping assets in and out.\n\n\u201cIf the IRS were looking at it, they would say that\u2019s a sham transaction,\u201d says Peter Kraus, a former chief executive officer of mutual fund manager AllianceBernstein Holding LP who now runs Aperture Investors LLC.\n\nImagine that a grocer got a tax deduction every time someone returned a box of cornflakes to his store. Heartbeats are when the grocer asks a friend to buy all the boxes and return them, just to pocket more deductions.\n\n Fund managers and bankers say the trades are perfectly legal, and that most of the taxes that they help regular ETF investors avoid will be paid in later years. The biggest ETF managers, including BlackRock, State Street, and Vanguard Group, all use heartbeats, with help from banks such as Bank of America, Credit Suisse Group, and Goldman Sachs Group, according to market participants who spoke on condition of anonymity. Spokesmen for those companies either declined to comment on the trades or defended their use. The Internal Revenue Service says it\u2019s aware of heartbeats and wouldn\u2019t say whether it considers them an abuse.\n\nTo people in the industry, heartbeats are just smart tax strategy. \u201cIt\u2019s removing a negative from the investment process,\u201d says Bruce Bond, a pioneering ETF executive who was among the first regular users of heartbeat trades. \u201cThere really isn\u2019t a need to have to pay the tax every year. The goal is the best investor experience you can have.\u201d\n\nTo understand heartbeats, it helps to know that they\u2019re just a supersize version of something ETFs do every day. ETFs are funds whose shares trade all day on stock exchanges. Unlike mutual funds, ETFs aren\u2019t sold directly to regular investors. Instead, they use banks and brokerage firms as middlemen. These large traders don\u2019t transact in cash. They make an ETF bigger or smaller by adding portfolio stocks to it, or by taking them out. They call this activity \u201ccreating\u201d and \u201credeeming\u201d ETF shares. (All this is invisible to small investors, who just buy ETFs from brokers.)\n\nEnter the Nixon-era tax law. In 1969,\u00a0Congress decreed\u00a0that mutual funds can hand over appreciated stocks to withdrawing investors without triggering a tax bill. Lawmakers never explained why they blessed the industry with this unique break, but back then, it didn\u2019t seem like much of a giveaway. Mutual funds rarely took advantage of it, because their investors preferred cash payouts.\nFast forward to 1993, when American Stock Exchange executives\u00a0devising the first U.S. exchange-traded fund\u00a0realized they could put that old tax rule to a new use. Say an ETF needs to get rid of a stock that went up. Selling it would trigger a taxable gain that would ultimately be paid by fund investors. But handing the stock off to a broker who\u2019s making a withdrawal achieves the same goal, tax-free. Every time a broker redeems a stake in a fund, it\u2019s another chance to avoid taxes. That loophole gives ETFs a tax advantage over mutual funds. It went from a footnote in the tax code to the cornerstone of a new industry.\nFor some of the earliest ETFs, which followed broad indexes such as the S&amp;P 500 and rarely changed holdings, the daily process of brokers creating and redeeming was enough to wash away almost all capital gains. The first and largest ETF, State Street\u2019s SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF, hasn\u2019t reported a taxable gain in 22 years. In contrast, a traditional mutual fund run by Fidelity Investments that tracks the same index had a taxable gain in 10 of those years.\n\nETFs proliferated, and some new entrants shuffled their holdings more frequently, so routine redemptions weren\u2019t always enough to wipe out the taxes. The PowerShares funds, co-founded by Bond, started trading in 2003 and changed their portfolios every three months. He says his funds wouldn\u2019t have kept capital-gains taxes away without heartbeats. \u201cThis tool was there,\u201d says Bond, who sold PowerShares to Invesco Ltd. and now runs Innovator Capital Management LLC in Wheaton, Ill. \u201cWe were the ones to first really utilize it to its full potential.\u201d\nU.S. stock ETFs avoided tax on more than $211 billion in gains last year, according to a Bloomberg Businessweek tally based on annual reports of more than 400 funds. The disclosures don\u2019t show how much of that is from the funds\u2019 routine use of the ETF loophole and how much is from special heartbeat trades that maximize the benefit. But heartbeats certainly contribute billions to the total.\nFunds pass taxable gains along to their investors, so by avoiding those gains, they\u2019re allowing investors to defer the tax until they sell the ETF itself. The $211 billion in avoided fund gains probably translates to about $23 billion in deferred taxes last year. It\u2019s the equivalent of a $23 billion, no-interest loan from the U.S. Treasury to ETF investors, with most of the benefit going to the\u00a0wealthiest Americans.\nHeartbeats have had a few nicknames over the years, including \u201cfriendlies,\u201d but they haven\u2019t attracted much attention outside the industry. Elisabeth Kashner, an ETF specialist at FactSet Research Systems Inc., was the first to write about the practice in a\u00a0December 2017 report. She called them heartbeats because the telltale blips in fund-flow data on her computer screen reminded her of a cardiac monitor. Bloomberg Businessweek identified 2,261 such blips in equity ETFs since 2000. Last year there were 548, worth a record $98 billion.\n\nMost heartbeats take place when an ETF has to get rid of stock because of a change in the index it tracks. That was the case in September with State Street\u2019s $23 billion\u00a0Technology Select Sector SPDR. Some of the fund\u2019s largest holdings, including Facebook Inc. and Google parent Alphabet Inc.,\u00a0were being dropped\u00a0from the portfolio because they were leaving the index the fund is designed to mimic. Both stocks had more than doubled since the fund first acquired them, so it probably faced a hefty tax bill if it sold them.\nOn Wednesday, Sept. 19, two days before the index change, $3.3 billion of new assets poured in, increasing the fund\u2019s size by 14 percent. The additions came in the form of stock that matched the fund\u2019s holdings at the time. The investor\u2019s identity wasn\u2019t disclosed, but market participants say that, given the size of the transaction, it was probably a large investment bank.\nOn Friday of that week, someone pulled more than $3 billion back out. Trading data suggest it was the same investor that had appeared two days before. Rather than take back the same shares of stock it had contributed 48 hours earlier, the investor appears to have walked away with the fund\u2019s oldest shares of Facebook and Alphabet, the ones with the biggest capital gains. Thanks to winnings on stocks like that, the fund reported more than $4 billion in capital gains for the year. But since it used the ETF tax loophole to shield those gains from taxes, its annual report shows, it ended up reporting a $309 million capital loss to the IRS.",

        "selftext": "Yeah, me neither until my puts on WLL didn't print.\n\nSo, in typical WSB fashion let's do some digging after we've already entered the trade. Who the actual fuck is buying this when they declared bankruptcy almost a month ago, and released their restructuring plan a couple days ago that includes wiping out the current shareholder's completely?\n\nGotta be dumbass retail investors right? Nope, they hold 1.03% of the shares and even the bagholders on Robinhood were selling today according to Robintrack. Mutual Funds hold 69.29% of the shares and other institutional investors hold 34.88%.\n\nSweet, smart money is holding the shares and they're clearly going to dump if the restructuring plan will wipe them out... um, turns out not so much. The 'smart' money guys are buying right now.\n\nFor example;\n\nFidelity Low Priced Stock Fund bought 206k shares today\n\nHwabao Upstream Oil and Gas bought 1.6m shares today\n\nDFA US small cap value bought 828k shares today\n\nSSga Funds bought 4.9m today\n\nBlackrock bought 310k today and is the largest individual shareholder at 14.41% of total outstanding shares, because of course they are. Fuckers own everything.\n\nMillennium Management LLC bought 3.9m shares\n\nThe list goes on. I'm not betting that retail investors will be smart enough to read the restructuring settlement and sell these shares. It turns out that I'm betting against mutual funds that don't give a fuck because it's not their money. Awesome.\n\nSomehow shorting a bankrupt company that's about to bend their shareholders over and fuck them bloody is a bad idea. The more you know.",

        "selftext": "\u200e\u200fHi Everyone, yesterday was the worst day for me I lost almost my whole life savings $65k in Oil ETFs stocks and I wasn\u2019t aware that using the margin balance would cause closing my position by the broker (TD Ameritrade) that fast when it goes so much down, and nobody expect those oil prices, TD Ameritrade made a margin call and closed my positions and wiped out my account without a notice, and sold my positions on the low, they know it\u2019s unusual oil price and it will recover because there is an oil cut soon, but they still sold me very fast!! And ruined my life and my family savings! Not sure what do now? And if there is a lawyer can help me about closing my positions! I have a proof of everything!\n\nAlso, I wanted to note that I didn\u2019t mean to use the margin, TD Ameritrade doesn\u2019t show how much I am using from the margin until the stocks goes down and the margin calls shows up, I feel that they do that trap in purpose so they can take new investors money! I know I was greedy and I didn\u2019t know how Oil ETFs works but they also trapping new users they should show how much I used from the margin \n\nIf you can help with anything please message me!\n\n[This is a screenshot of positions before they close it](https://i.imgur.com/RDZ0Hdz_d.jpg?maxwidth=640&amp;shape=thumb&amp;fidelity=medium)",

        "selftext": "One day last September an unidentified trader pumped more than $3 billion into a tech fund run by State Street Corp. Two days later that trader pulled out a similar amount.\n\nWhy would someone make such a large bet\u2014five times bigger than any previous transaction in the fund\u2014and then reverse it so quickly? It turns out that transfusions like these are tax dodges, carried out by the world\u2019s largest asset managers with help from investment banks. The beneficiaries are the long-term investors in exchange-traded funds. Such trades, nicknamed \u201cheartbeats,\u201d are rampant across the\u00a0$4 trillion U.S. ETF market, with more than 500 made in the past year. One ETF manager calls them the industry\u2019s \u201cdirty little secret.\u201d\n\nTypically, when you sell a stock for more than you paid, you owe tax on the gain. But thanks to a quirk in a\u00a0Nixon-era tax law, funds can avoid that tax if they use the stock to pay off a withdrawing fund investor. Heartbeats come into play when there isn\u2019t an exiting investor handy. A fund manager asks a friendly bank to create extra withdrawals by rapidly pumping assets in and out.\n\n\u201cIf the IRS were looking at it, they would say that\u2019s a sham transaction,\u201d says Peter Kraus, a former chief executive officer of mutual fund manager AllianceBernstein Holding LP who now runs Aperture Investors LLC.\n\nImagine that a grocer got a tax deduction every time someone returned a box of cornflakes to his store. Heartbeats are when the grocer asks a friend to buy all the boxes and return them, just to pocket more deductions.\n\n Fund managers and bankers say the trades are perfectly legal, and that most of the taxes that they help regular ETF investors avoid will be paid in later years. The biggest ETF managers, including BlackRock, State Street, and Vanguard Group, all use heartbeats, with help from banks such as Bank of America, Credit Suisse Group, and Goldman Sachs Group, according to market participants who spoke on condition of anonymity. Spokesmen for those companies either declined to comment on the trades or defended their use. The Internal Revenue Service says it\u2019s aware of heartbeats and wouldn\u2019t say whether it considers them an abuse.\n\nTo people in the industry, heartbeats are just smart tax strategy. \u201cIt\u2019s removing a negative from the investment process,\u201d says Bruce Bond, a pioneering ETF executive who was among the first regular users of heartbeat trades. \u201cThere really isn\u2019t a need to have to pay the tax every year. The goal is the best investor experience you can have.\u201d\n\nTo understand heartbeats, it helps to know that they\u2019re just a supersize version of something ETFs do every day. ETFs are funds whose shares trade all day on stock exchanges. Unlike mutual funds, ETFs aren\u2019t sold directly to regular investors. Instead, they use banks and brokerage firms as middlemen. These large traders don\u2019t transact in cash. They make an ETF bigger or smaller by adding portfolio stocks to it, or by taking them out. They call this activity \u201ccreating\u201d and \u201credeeming\u201d ETF shares. (All this is invisible to small investors, who just buy ETFs from brokers.)\n\nEnter the Nixon-era tax law. In 1969,\u00a0Congress decreed\u00a0that mutual funds can hand over appreciated stocks to withdrawing investors without triggering a tax bill. Lawmakers never explained why they blessed the industry with this unique break, but back then, it didn\u2019t seem like much of a giveaway. Mutual funds rarely took advantage of it, because their investors preferred cash payouts.\nFast forward to 1993, when American Stock Exchange executives\u00a0devising the first U.S. exchange-traded fund\u00a0realized they could put that old tax rule to a new use. Say an ETF needs to get rid of a stock that went up. Selling it would trigger a taxable gain that would ultimately be paid by fund investors. But handing the stock off to a broker who\u2019s making a withdrawal achieves the same goal, tax-free. Every time a broker redeems a stake in a fund, it\u2019s another chance to avoid taxes. That loophole gives ETFs a tax advantage over mutual funds. It went from a footnote in the tax code to the cornerstone of a new industry.\nFor some of the earliest ETFs, which followed broad indexes such as the S&amp;P 500 and rarely changed holdings, the daily process of brokers creating and redeeming was enough to wash away almost all capital gains. The first and largest ETF, State Street\u2019s SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF, hasn\u2019t reported a taxable gain in 22 years. In contrast, a traditional mutual fund run by Fidelity Investments that tracks the same index had a taxable gain in 10 of those years.\n\nETFs proliferated, and some new entrants shuffled their holdings more frequently, so routine redemptions weren\u2019t always enough to wipe out the taxes. The PowerShares funds, co-founded by Bond, started trading in 2003 and changed their portfolios every three months. He says his funds wouldn\u2019t have kept capital-gains taxes away without heartbeats. \u201cThis tool was there,\u201d says Bond, who sold PowerShares to Invesco Ltd. and now runs Innovator Capital Management LLC in Wheaton, Ill. \u201cWe were the ones to first really utilize it to its full potential.\u201d\nU.S. stock ETFs avoided tax on more than $211 billion in gains last year, according to a Bloomberg Businessweek tally based on annual reports of more than 400 funds. The disclosures don\u2019t show how much of that is from the funds\u2019 routine use of the ETF loophole and how much is from special heartbeat trades that maximize the benefit. But heartbeats certainly contribute billions to the total.\nFunds pass taxable gains along to their investors, so by avoiding those gains, they\u2019re allowing investors to defer the tax until they sell the ETF itself. The $211 billion in avoided fund gains probably translates to about $23 billion in deferred taxes last year. It\u2019s the equivalent of a $23 billion, no-interest loan from the U.S. Treasury to ETF investors, with most of the benefit going to the\u00a0wealthiest Americans.\nHeartbeats have had a few nicknames over the years, including \u201cfriendlies,\u201d but they haven\u2019t attracted much attention outside the industry. Elisabeth Kashner, an ETF specialist at FactSet Research Systems Inc., was the first to write about the practice in a\u00a0December 2017 report. She called them heartbeats because the telltale blips in fund-flow data on her computer screen reminded her of a cardiac monitor. Bloomberg Businessweek identified 2,261 such blips in equity ETFs since 2000. Last year there were 548, worth a record $98 billion.\n\nMost heartbeats take place when an ETF has to get rid of stock because of a change in the index it tracks. That was the case in September with State Street\u2019s $23 billion\u00a0Technology Select Sector SPDR. Some of the fund\u2019s largest holdings, including Facebook Inc. and Google parent Alphabet Inc.,\u00a0were being dropped\u00a0from the portfolio because they were leaving the index the fund is designed to mimic. Both stocks had more than doubled since the fund first acquired them, so it probably faced a hefty tax bill if it sold them.\nOn Wednesday, Sept. 19, two days before the index change, $3.3 billion of new assets poured in, increasing the fund\u2019s size by 14 percent. The additions came in the form of stock that matched the fund\u2019s holdings at the time. The investor\u2019s identity wasn\u2019t disclosed, but market participants say that, given the size of the transaction, it was probably a large investment bank.\nOn Friday of that week, someone pulled more than $3 billion back out. Trading data suggest it was the same investor that had appeared two days before. Rather than take back the same shares of stock it had contributed 48 hours earlier, the investor appears to have walked away with the fund\u2019s oldest shares of Facebook and Alphabet, the ones with the biggest capital gains. Thanks to winnings on stocks like that, the fund reported more than $4 billion in capital gains for the year. But since it used the ETF tax loophole to shield those gains from taxes, its annual report shows, it ended up reporting a $309 million capital loss to the IRS.",

        "selftext": "TL;DR -- Does index investing violate the principle of due diligence for the public investor, resulting in uncalculated systemic risk to the market? What exists for analyzing and protecting against this?\n\nHello, I am a Financial Advisor with 11 years of industry experience (7 managing client investment portfolios). As with most in my profession, I spend the majority of my time working with clients and helping them manage their relationship with their finances/investment capital, and rely very heavily on my firm's investment policy committee for guidance on portfolio management.\n\nFor the most part, I have appreciated the industry's shift over the past 20 years away from transactional investment brokerage relationships, and toward \"managed money\" through financial planners. I believe that overall, the effect has led to stability in the capital markets by encouraging public investors to view themselves as participating in the asset class as a whole, which ensures the commitment of true long-term investment capital, and enables broader adoption of efficient market theory.\n\nHowever... I have concerns that I am\nhoping a CFA, market economist, or anyone with depth in knowledge regarding the structural integrity and plumbing of the markets could potentially help address. \n\nWe have seen significant adoption of the concept that all public investors (i.e. people saving money regularly into their 401k's, IRA's, etc.) should essentially just put their money into an S&amp;P 500 index fund and ignore it, with common references to the idea that \"80% of portfolio managers historically do not outpace the index. So why pay fees for them to underperform?\" This makes sense... Until you think about it from a standpoint of blind market inflows. If conventional consumer wisdom leads to disproportion amount of capital going blindly into index funds (and thus buying the underlying securities held within) what is in place to keep prices in check with value?\n\nWhat I fear is that this concept violates the principle of due diligence, on a mass scale, and thus, could lead to systemic problems we are not yet fully aware of. Regardless, companies like Vangaurd and Fidelity lead market growth by helping average people invest into low-cost, passively diversified portfolios without much thought or due-diligence of their own on the underlying securities they are buying. I think it's great for the most part, but I'm just not sure how it will play out for market stability and balance of powers in the long run.\n\nAre you aware of any mechanisms or theories about where this behavior will lead the investment community (and global economy) if it continues to mature along its current continuum?\n\nI am also curious to know if there may be some convenient meta market analysis tools or reports for evaluating market inflows, outflows, and the current distribution of ownership within the capital markets (% owned by retail investors, vs institutional investors, vs where investors are at in life stage, etc.), -- I believe this would also inherently provide a snapshot of reality of the distribution of capital power. For example, broad distribution by owner type could help provide some clarity on what impact corporate stock buy-backs have on the market, by looking at it in terms of control as a % of the whole of market capital, rather than just looking at effect on stock price.\n\nI'm sorry this is so long, and I hope you appreciate the rabbit-hole thought train i'm headed down. Would love to hear your thoughts on any of this! -- Thanks",

Also looking to get into out of state real estate for additional passive income.  I\u2019m not planning on kids, or settling down in one area.  I need freedom.  This virus is the perfect time to invest but I need a little guidance; no one in my network invests.    \n\nEmergency funds: &gt;1 year \n\nDebt: None\n\nTax Filing Status: Single\n\nTax Rate: 32% Federal, 9.3% State\n\nState of Residence: CA\n\nAge: 32\n\nDesired Asset allocation: 80% stocks / 20% bonds (not stuck on this)\n\nDesired International allocation: 15% but not stuck on this\n\nCurrent total portfolio: Haven't started investing yet, but I have low 6 figures cash available to invest immediately\n\nCurrent retirement assets\n\nTaxable - Fidelity\n\n$250K cash\n\nNothing invested yet\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n401k - Fidelity\n\n$33K cash\n\n$100K - FBGRX ( Fidelity\u00ae Blue Chip Growth Fund) (.8%)\n\nNo company match\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n401k - Betterment\n\n$5K - 90/10 stocks/bonds\n\nNo company match\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNew annual Contributions\n\n$5K annually invested Betterment 401k (Zero employer match)\n\n$0 IRA/Roth IRA\n\nQuestions:\n\n1. For the Fidelity 401K, it seems to make sense to dump the FBGRX, and purchase a zero/low cost passive mutual fund to save .8% fees.  How about FNILX (Fidelity ZEROSM Large Cap Index Fund)?  Any suggestions for a bond fund that would complement this for the 401K?  Does it make sense to sell it all off and then buy in now?  \n2. Does it make sense to annually max out my 401K given my retirement goals?  I\u2019d like to be able to pull money only if it\u2019s absolutely needed but there\u2019s still a chance it could happen.  The penalties seem high for early withdrawal.\n3. I\u2019m stuck on choosing between ETFs and passive mutual funds, and it\u2019s really holding me back from diving in.  I will buy and hold for several years, but it seems like the tax efficiency of ETFs may be worth it especially if they do dividend reinvestment.  Both Betterment and Wealthfront both use ETFs.  Does Fidelity offer dividend reinvestment plans on ETFs?  \n4. Can you give me feedback on the proposed allocation and funds for the taxable account.  I listed out options for either ETF for MF depending on which is more advantageous:\n   1. 40% US S&amp;P500 fund: \n      1. Mutual fund opton: FNILX (FIDELITY ZERO LARGE CAP INDEX; 0%); FXAIX (Fidelity\u00ae 500 Index Fund; .015%)\n      2. ETF option: VOO (Vanguard S&amp;P 500 ETF; .03%) including many other similar ones\n   2. 20% mid and small cap US fund\n      1. Mutual fund opton:FZIPX (Fidelity ZEROSM Extended Market Index Fund; 0%), FSMAX (Fidelity\u00ae Extended Market Index Fund; 0.045%) \n      2. ETF option: VO (VANGUARD MID CAP ETF; .04%); maybe others\n   3. 20% US bonds: \n      1. Mutual fund opton: FMBIX (Fidelity\u00ae Municipal Bond Index Fund; .07%), FLTMX (Fidelity\u00ae Intermediate Municipal Income Fund; .35%), FMNDX (Fidelity\u00ae Conservative Income Municipal Bond Fund - Institutional Class; .25%), FCRDX (Fidelity\u00ae Conservative Income Municipal Bond Fund; .35%)\n      2. ETF option: any recommendations?\n   4. 15% international stocks\n      1. Mutual fund opton: FZILX (Fidelity ZEROSM International Index Fund; 0%), FSPSX (Fidelity\u00ae International Index Fund; .035%), FSGGX (Fidelity\u00ae Global ex U.S. Index Fund; .056%), FTIHX (Fidelity\u00ae Total International Index Fund; .06%)\n      2.

They tend to jump between 18$ and 22$, so I set an alert to let me know when it drops below 20$. It\u2019s at 18.50 today and I can\u2019t buy any shares due to \u201cilliquidity\u201d. I use fidelity by the way. I\u2019ve been waiting a while to buy this stock, and I\u2019d be willing to buy it at up to 20$ a share. Of course I\u2019m only dealing with 150$ as I\u2019ve spent most of my budget for stocks so far. So I placed a limit order of 6 shares at 19$. \n\nFor those seasoned in the stock market, what can I expect? Is there anything I can do to make sure I get some shares in this stock? My belief is that this is a very good company, with a solid balance sheet and good yearly growth. I think it has the chance to blow up over the years and would like to at least get a little money in it now. So any advice would be appreciated. The ticker is OTGLY by the way.",

        "selftext": "Hey folks, I understand that investing is highly dependent on what your goals are. Much the same as choosing a car or a gun. Everyone has what they like or trust and that very much depends on what the use is. I think to get the point. So, here\u2019s a bit about my goals, my portfolio and why I chose what I did. Please feel free to rip me apart, I can handle it.\n\n1) My reason for investing: guys, I was in middle school when 9/11 happened and something I\u2019ll never forget is when 6 or 8 months after, I heard someone talking about what a great investment they made in airline stocks right after the terrorist attacks. I was like god damnit, that makes good sense. Fast forward, I\u2019m watching this pandemic kick the worlds ass. Now, please, I\u2019m not saying 9/11 and COVID19 are the same things, save your breath. I\u2019m saying, I\u2019m finally in a spot to POSSIBLY take advantage of irregular investment opportunities. \n\n2) My goal: I\u2019m not nor will I ever have the cast iron balls to day trade or make r/wallstreetbets. I am willing and happy to put my money into conservative spots and let it rest for 1-2 maybe 5 years. This is not for retirement, I have a 401k through my employer for that, so keep that in mind. It is my intention to sell this portfolio after it has made some gains whenever that may be. I know I know, we may not have a v shaped recovery or whatever, I\u2019m fine with that. I\u2019m not putting rent money into my trading account.\n\n3) Portfolio: alright, here is where I need feedback. Without beating around the bush, here\u2019s what I did... I decided to start with a broad set of ETFs. After lots of reading and combing through a HUGE watch list for weeks, I cannot find better price/quality in ETFs than Fidelity. Here\u2019s why: expense/management ratios are low for most of their sector ETFs. They have decent asset holdings, most around 500M which should keep them afloat fine. They have great Morning Star ratings (not a huge deal to me, but okay). They have lower entry points than Vanguard which obviously I like a lot, but I feel are a bit spendy per share. And finally, they have good trade volume.\n\nHere are the ETFs I\u2019ve selected with varying weight across them.\n\nDGRO\nFCOM\nFENY\nFHLC\nFMAT\nFNCL\nFSTA\nJETS\nFREL\nFDVV\nFUTY\nFIDU\nFTEC\nFDIS\n\n4) What\u2019s next: my goal is to slowly add positions to these ETFs and hopefully dollar cost average as the market probably slides over the next month. After that, I will start isolating single stock shares and picking those up. I\u2019m interested in oil tanker stocks, food delivery stocks and a few duh picks like Disney.\n\nTalk to me boys, any gaps in my logic?",

I currently have a Roth 401k through my employer (they use Fidelity), and I'm heavily invested in stocks.

For example, I don't have much foreign stock in my portfolio and the current allocation is heavily focused on domestic stock. I'm curious to hear what anyone's input is on this allocation?

All stocks I invested in the price hasn\u2019t dropped more than  $10 so it seems I did invest close to the bottom ( I know it can/will get worse) so I think I\u2019m still at a low enough place where I can make money when things start to trend upward again. \n\nI have been buying a small number of some stocks when they dipped again late yesterday/today , but do you think it would or would not be a waste to sell off these shares just to reinvest less than $10 lower?",

CEO insists that they can get FDA clearance for their Covid-19 blood tests and they're already a diabetes testing supply company.

I bought in around $0.24 and $0.28. After it fell, the SEC suspended the stock and they have reset it to the $0.275 that it was at before and nullified the day before when it fell. \n\nApparently it is suspended until May 7. A PR report is supposed to come out Sunday per the CEO. Should I sell as fast as possible to recover what I can when it opens back up in May? Is that money officially \"mine\" once I sell or are they going to place this stock on  hold again and hold more transactions?

If you\u2019ve gotten bank of america promotions, or chase bank promotions for certain discounted products- that\u2019s been cardlytics. \n\nNow to my main theses about why i think they\u2019re a great company.\n\n1. Network effects. \n\nNeedless to say, their business model suggests that the more (and larger) FI\u2019s they partner up with, the more valuable they become to advertising customers, and the more advertising customers they attract the more attractive they become to FIs.\n\n2. Switching costs\n\nThe company has disclosed that it can take up to *years* to integrate into an FI partner, this makes sense seeing that their software is embedded deeply within FI\u2019s. Given how lengthy the integration process is, would an FI really switch to a competitor just to get a similar result? (Also remember, network effects help suggest why FIs wouldn\u2019t want to move)\n\n3. Exclusivity \n\nCardlytics has disclosed that FIs typically do not have the capability to integrate more than one advertiser into their business (only one business can be integrated to have access to the transactions). This point speaks for itself.\n\nThese three structural competitive advantages work together very nicely in my opinion to suggest favourable future prospects for this company.\n\n4. Debt Position\n\nIn our current environment it is safe to say lots of debt (obviously considering if lots of earnings can cover it) is not ideal. Cardlytics has almost no debt on its balance sheet. \n\n5. Potential disruptor?\n\nCardlytics is a very unique company and one of the first to engage in this sort of business. The company boasts returns as high at 30:1 for advertising spend. I can easily see this growing in popularity amongst advertisers who *especially coming out of this environment* want the most bang for their buck.\n\nLet me know what you think, this isn\u2019t a \u201cwill it go up?\u201d post, i just want to know if people agree with me on the quality of the business, or if there are concerns/ red flags i\u2019ve overlooked.",

        "selftext": "I have been investing through Betterment because I really like being hands-off and spending zero effort &amp; attention to my investments. However, my investable capital is growing to nearly 1M, so those Betterment's fees will matter more and more. Yet, I do not want to relinquish the simplicity and convenience of something like Betterment. Therefore, I was wondering whether there is any good brokerage (or other robo-like services) where I can hold a similar **taxable** portfolio (i.e. based on booglehead principles) but that it will result in lower fees and that comes with following robo-features that I love:  \n\n\n1) **auto-rebalancing**: Betterment and other robo-advisors have automatic portfolio rebalancing. Note that I do not refer to the type of rebalancing present in target date funds where the rebalancing's goal is to change the portfolio allocation to make it more and more conservative. Instead, I am referring to the rebalancing that preserves the portfolio allocation weights specified at the beginning (e.g. always keeping the portfolio at approximately 70% stock &amp; 30% bond weights). At these robo-advisors, events that trigger this auto-rebalancing include drift (deviation of each asset class from its specified weight), withdrawals/fees, deposits, and allocation change. Additionally, this auto-rebalancing is tax-efficient by minimizing tax costs. It does so by prioritizing selling shares with losses (resulting in realized losses), shares with no gain/loss, shares with long-term gain, and ultimately shares with short-term gain.  \n\n\n2) **fractional share**: Betterment and other robo-advisors are able to invest in fractional shares so that no cash is left uninvested  \n\n\n3) **convenient deposit &amp; withdrawal**: Betterment and other robo-advisors make deposits and withdrawals easy by just asking the amount and handle the rest. In the case of deposits, it will automatically distribute the capital in the portfolio according to the specified portfolio allocation weight (i.e. auto-rebalancing). In the case of withdrawals, it will automatically withdraw according to the same weights (i.e. auto-rebalancing).  \n\n\n4) **automatic dividend reinvesting**: Betterment and other robo-advisors automatically reinvest dividends so that no cash is left uninvested  \n\n\nI have never used a brokerage before, so I dont know whether it is unrealistic to find such features in them or whether they already have them. I have looked at the websites of traditional brokerages like Vanguard, Fidelity, and Charles Schwab, but I couldn't find anything on their website that indicates the presence of the aforementioned features. I have also looked at M1 Finance, and it seems to have everything I need, but they only take US citizens/permanent residents (green card), so it wont work for me.",

        "selftext": "Hello,\n\nFirst post here. 23 Y/O with a full time job in wealth management  looking to finally put about $20k of savings into the market at an opportune time. I can\u2019t think of a better time to start thinking about an entry point for long term investing given the current environment. My personal opinion is that the market hasn\u2019t bottomed from corona. Within the next 1-2 months we will see some serious continuous bleeding of the market due to the US corona virus implications with accelerating cases/numbers (I hope I am wrong).  A lot of it may already be priced in/the market has stabilized a bit and eased the volatility, but I think it\u2019s gonna continue to get worse. \n\nIt is important to understand that investing for the long term does not involve predicting an exact entry point or a \u201cbottom\u201d in the market before we start seeing some rejuvenation.  With that said, I want to start dollar cost averaging into the market with my $20k but given the volatile market and outlook that we will likely bounce back in Q3/Q4 I am looking at a bit of an accelerated dollar cost averaging approach. Thinking like $3-5k at a time with 3-5 different influxes of cash into the market. Or maybe like 1/3 in the month of April, 1/3 in the month of May, and 1/3 in the month of June.\n\nI have maxed out 2019 and 2020 ROTH IRA contributions (6k each) and put another $8k into a taxable brokerage at Fidelity. This is all in cash right now and is my only investable money as of now. I don\u2019t have an asset allocation yet, I\u2019m all cash and this is my first real personal portfolio that I\u2019m starting. My target allocation is probably 80/20 overall and I want to be like 85/90 aggressive in this Fidelity investable money.\n\nWhat ETFs would you suggest? Looking for something a little more outside the box than SPY or VOO for example. In my opinion ETFs are superior to mutual funds given the liquidity and tax advantaged characteristics. Obviously, there are different funds you would put in your IRA than your brokerage, but I am just looking for someone to guide me towards what they did in my position. \n\nIf you choose mutual funds or another vehicle geared towards long term investing, why did you go that route?\n\nThis is my first post and I hope to continue to post and contribute!! Thanks in advance guys!",

I\u2019m posting because I\u2019ve seen some retarded DD on here last 2 days that would offend retarded people. \n\nWhy Last ? I got better things to do. \n\nMy credentials ?  Insider in this space for over 10 years.    ( excuse the grammars. English is my fourth language). \n\nThis is a very dumbed down version as I can\u2019t very well write 100 pages on wsb post.  There are books, seminars, certifications on this stuffs. \n\nCredit Card processing is very important as it\u2019s a key indicator for consumers spending.   Scroll down for  Puts/Calls.\n\n**Parties Involved to make it work ?**\n\n1.) Consumer   --- end user. Credit Card holder. \n\n2.) Merchant   --- Business establishment accepting  payment. These guys pay out all the fees\n\n3.) Card Brand   ---- Visa, Mastercard, Discover (Diner Club,  Union Pay), American Express, \n\n4.) Sponsoring Bank   --- handles risks, daily balancing, funding the merchant. \n\n5.) Issuing Bank --- Issue the credit card. If your credit card say \u201c Chase\u201d, then Chase is the issuing bank. \n\n6.) Processor  --- transactions run through these guys. Think of them as a highway to run  and verify transactions\n\n7.) ISO --- Independent sales office. These guys are the one who call business to sign them up with \u201c use my company  \n\n for cheaper rates\u201d \n\n**How**  **does each Parties make money ?** \n\n1.) Consumer --- they don\u2019t  anything as they are the purchaser.\n\n2.) Merchant --- they pay out all the fees. At the end of the month, they get a bill for the privilege of being able to accept credit card.  \n\n3.) Card Brand --- Card Brand is pretty much god. They make about 15% of total fees paid out to merchant.   Look up  FANF, dues &amp; assessments. If Visa need money, they just increase their rates, that\u2019s it. More on this later. \n\n4.) Sponsoring Bank -- these guys make the least out of everyone in the group. About  0.01% -0.03%  ( 1 to 3 BP) of total processing volume.  \n\n5.) Issuing bank -- \u201cinterchange\u201d is paid out to the issuing bank. These fees account for about 75% of all total fees.  Card Brand dictate interchange. I\u2019m not going to go into qualifications, etc\u2026.. Interchange rates is publish for each card brand. Look it up. \n\n6.) Processor --- these guys usually make money on per transaction counts. About $0.02 -$0.05 per transaction and bunch of other misc fees. \n\n7.) ISO --- whatever is left over goes to the sales group.  In a normal business niche ( not high risk or CBD/ cannabis), profit is about 0.30% - 0.50% of total processing volume. \n\n**Profit Math**\n\nMerchant\u2019s fee \u2013 ( issuing bank + card brand ) = ISO\u2019 Gross - ( Processor + Sponsoring Bank) = ISO\u2019s Net.\n\n \n\n**Fees:** \n\nAlways have 2 parts.   \n\na.)  Percentage  multiply by the processing volume. \n\nb.)  Fix charge multiply by the transaction.\n\nWhat if you as a sales office  charged merchant 2.75% ( SQUARE) and  nothing else? you would  net negative on any transactions under $10 and  net positive on any transaction over $40.00\n\nWhy ? because interchange for a signature regulated debit is  0.05%+ $0.22( per transaction) not including all the other costs. \n\n**State of the world.**\n\nAll 50 states have stay-at-home orders. Some states are talking about opening up again ( GA, FL).  Guess what ? it\u2019s the Consumers who\u2019s going to decide when to \u201copen\u201d up. Household spending account for 70% of annual GDP. \n\nThe rest of the world is on lock down. Even after opening up, it\u2019s still bad. \n\n[https://www.barrons.com/articles/chinas-reopening-is-missing-consumers-thats-a-bad-sign-for-u-s-51587476793](https://www.barrons.com/articles/chinas-reopening-is-missing-consumers-thats-a-bad-sign-for-u-s-51587476793)\n\n**Great\u2026\u2026**  **Give me puts or calls\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..**\n\n1.) Card Brand   ---- \n\na. Visa ( V)  -- earning is on 04/30. They are  the god in this business. They have the greatest exposure in US and overseas. There is no place in asia or Europe that does not take Visa. They increase their rates twice a year. Rate increases scheduled for this April was pushed back to July.  Their earnings will be absolutely horrible as the rest of the world started shutting down in Feb and US in march. \n\ni.  Waiting to be fill --- V 01 May $160P  \n\nii. Waiting to be fill --- V 19 June $135P \n\nb. Mastercard -- earning is on 04/29 -- They have the second highest processing in US. Also like Visa. If you are playing earning, any puts within 5% will be good. \n\nc. Discover ( DFS)  (Diner Club,  Union Pay) --- Earning  4/22 -- I had  15 X $2.72 01 May $34C going into earning. CALLS?? WTF?? 1.) they announced dividends right before earnings. 2.) They own debit networks. Think grocery stores, liquor stores, cannabis shops. 3.) Dinner club, union pay, paypal all goes through them to process on a traditional level. \n\nResults: \n\nQ1 GAAP EPS of -$0.25 misses by $1.61.\n\nRevenue of $2.89B (+4.7% Y/Y) beats by $10M.\n\nShares -5.3% AH.\n\nGoing to exit my position at open with probably 40% losses. \n\nThis is good, if  DFS  missed by bad, the rest will be way way worst. \n\nd. American Express ( AXP) ---  rich people\u2019s credit card. \n\n2.) Sponsoring Bank   ---\n\na. FITB -- 4/21 --  missed earning. Went down on 4/21 then went back up. \n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\n3.) Issuing Bank --- I would not touch issuing bank as they are too diversified.\n\na. Chase\n\nb. Bank of America\n\n4.) Processor  -- do your own research.  \n\na. Global Payments\n\nb. Fiserv\n\n**Other:** \n\nSQ ( Square) -- earning 05/06. I did not talked about Payment facilitator. Which is kinda of what they are.   Here was a post on here  \u201c Square InC, SQ Puts\u2014let\u2019s be rational. Right direction but wrong DD. \n\nSquare  is all domestic and make their money primary from \n\n1.)  Credit Card processing --- they will give merchant, 2.75% or $275 total fees. Their credit card processing  is net negative since inception. The reason is because of their client base ( mom and pop, start up, small transactions type businesses). 2.75% is a good percentage on volume but the $0.00 per swipe is killing them by the time they have to pay out interchanges  and dues assessments.  Their average ticket have to be over $25.00 to be profit. But the business model will not allow it. Small mom and pop go to them because lax underwriting,  and it\u2019s a lot easier vs a traditional model. Most of their merchants is under 10k in processing. \n\n2.) Hardware sales  --- very minimal 1 time revenue \n\n3.) SAS ( Service as a subscription) -- Minimal revenue when comparing to credit card processing. They are also waiving all the software subscription fees for the month of April. \n\n4.) Others\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\n\n**I WOULD NOT TOUCH SQUARE.** \n\n1.)  In fintech, you don\u2019t need to be making money. You can have years of losses and stock will go up. Why ? because it\u2019s about acquiring a large merchant base. \n\n2.) Jack Dorsey -- yes the Twitter guy. He\u2019s the founder and ceo of Square. He\u2019s the Elon Musk of this  space. And you don\u2019t mess with papa  Elon. \n\n3.)  SQ is  APPROVED to make Emergency Small-Business Coronavirus loans.

        "selftext": "TLDR: 50% of Square's revenue comes from processing in-store transactions for physical merchants.\u00a0 SQ said transactions volumes for all its merchants were down 25% on March 24th, but estimates from Opentable and other sources suggest things have gotten a lot worse since then. \u00a045% of $SQ's transactions revenue comes from small merchants doing less than $125k in payments through it each year, and as much as 60% of SQ's overall revenues could come from restaurants, retail, and SMB \"services\" (like your wife's boyfriend).\u00a0 Based on how Germany, China, and Korea have been recovering, small merchants will likely not get their in-store revenues back to normal until Spring 2021.\u00a0 In spite of all this, since late Feb, the stock has outperformed its peers by 700 bps and the S%P by 1900 bps, as management talks up how their Cash App can earn a bunch of money being an intermediary for the JPOW SMB loans and TrumpBuxx.\u00a0 However, even all that is unlikely to offset what very rough math indicates will be up to 75% of their EBITDA going away for the year.\u00a0 SQ's next earnings call is May 6th.  \n1. What is Square?  \nSquare offers payment services for small businesses through credit card and touchless dongles it gives merchants.\u00a0 It gets a \\~1% cut after interchange fees for this service.  \n[https://jumbotron-production-f.squarecdn.com/assets/84657895c610afea678d.jpg](https://jumbotron-production-f.squarecdn.com/assets/84657895c610afea678d.jpg)  \n[https://solidshop-production-f.squarecdn.com/spree/images/31/modal/tile-contactless-chip-reader.jpg](https://solidshop-production-f.squarecdn.com/spree/images/31/modal/tile-contactless-chip-reader.jpg)  \nIn case you're wondering, you have to be in a store to pay via these pieces of injection-molded art.  \nThey also offer a cash app and working capital loans to the small businesses they've signed up.  \n2. Who uses Square?  \nThis guy, and people like him:  \n[https://imgur.com/a/SIqjItY](https://imgur.com/a/SIqjItY)  \nMeet Chef Romeo of Romeo Chocolates in Long Beach, California.\u00a0 When he's not busy making artisanal chocolate, he's getting his photo slapped onto page one of Square's 2019 Annual Report.  \n3. Are they still using Square?  \nNo. Square claims they have an ecommerce api like Paypal or Stripe / Shopify, but adoption is low.\u00a0 Case in point, Romeo Chocolates:  \n[https://imgur.com/a/CSmn0ox](https://imgur.com/a/CSmn0ox)  \nIn these times of woe, Chef Romeo prefers you place your orders online.\u00a0 For those orders, who helps process the payments? Google. Paypal. Shopify. Not Square.  \n4. How bad does it get?  \nVery bad. 50% of SQ's revenue comes from transaction payment processing (fees from Gross Payment Volume, or GPV); 45% of that comes from merchants who make less than 125k in payments volume through the platform and another 27% comes from merchants who make less than 500k in payments volume through the platform. Assuming half these smaller merchants are going to be doing minimal in-store business for the next 2 quarters, and most of these merchants will no longer use the SW services Square offers... you're looking at up to $350M of EBITDA impact, possibly more.\u00a0 Square's FY20E was \\~$500M, so this is a \\~80% impact.  \n5. Why is SQ up?  \n[https://imgur.com/a/DqRR2Rq](https://imgur.com/a/DqRR2Rq)  \nFor some reason, investors are confusing SQ's customer base with those of First Data/Fiserv, Elavon, Paypal, and Adyen.\u00a0 Those companies are not the same as Square.\u00a0 Their merchants are not hip.\u00a0 No, those merchants (ie Costco) are sell uncool but wildly profitable things like toilet paper and bottled water.\u00a0 In the COVIDian Maslow hierarchy, Costco beats sub-125k GPV merchants like Romeo Chocolates.\u00a0 And over 60% of Squares customers are small retailers and restaurants.\u00a0 Not exactly COVID proof.  \n6. When is the shoe going to drop?  \nMay 6th is when Square releases earnings.\u00a0 Investors will be looking for good vibes from the TrumpBuxx and JPOW SMB loans but all they will see - in the numbers - is a cavalcade of destruction.\u00a0 I for one will enjoy watching management defend TEV/Forward Ebitda at 75x when Forward EBITDA is projected to drop 80% this year.  \nThis is what Opentable says around half of Square's customer base has become:  \n[https://imgur.com/a/myJWpTx](https://imgur.com/a/myJWpTx)  \nDoes this look like something worth 11x revenue to you?",
