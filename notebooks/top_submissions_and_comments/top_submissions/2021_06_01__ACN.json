        "selftext": "For 5 years now (They skipped 2020/Covid) LinkedIn has produced a list of top companies to work for (called various things through the years).  I wanted to see what the (basic) results would be if one invested in the top ten companies.  However, not all of the companies are public or were at the time of the list.  So I skipped those and continued on the list till I had the top 10 public companies.  Also, the formatting is hard so I just included total results for each period and the total for all 5 periods.  I did not include dividends.  \n\nThis is not perfect, but just for fun.  I based the results on the begining and ending share price.  It's not weighted in any way, just percent gain (or loss) for each company during that period.

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, June 25, 2021**\n\n***Please note:*** *I've seen a lot of questions surrounding the analyst price target upgrades that I post, so I just wanted to clear some things up and explain my reasoning behind including them.*\n\n*I frequently get asked if I think analyst price target predictions are \"accurate\" or if I expect a stock I mention to hit the price predicted.* ***The answer to both these questions is NO.*** \n\n*I really don't put much, if any importance, on the actual numbers predicted by an analyst. They are just a meter to gauge how bullish or bearish they are. My purpose in including price target upgrades is to find trends in analyst thinking. In other words, if I see a bunch of different, well-known analysts all giving bullish target increases on a stock, I'll start doing research on a stock to see why they are so bullish. I have found quite a few profitable trades in this manner.*\n\n***In short, the purpose of the price target upgrades is idea generation. Keep an eye out if you start seeing the same stock receiving bullish target increases by different analysts.***\n\nStocks were mixed, but mostly positive today, with the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) recording a fresh intraday high and the Dow Jones (DIA) nicely continuing its recovery after falling last week, driven higher by a boost in bank stocks across the board after the Fed removed all pandemic-era restrictions on capital distributions. The Nasdaq (QQQ) fell modestly after several days of reaching new all-time highs. The core personal consumption expenditures, which serves as the Fed\u2019s preferred gauge for inflation was released but did not adversely affect the market, another signal the market is prepared to stomach higher than usual inflationary readings as the economy continues to recover. \n\nThe core PCE index measures the changes in prices paid by consumers for goods and services, minus volatile food and energy prices, which are staples and therefore not considered in the equation. The report registered a 3.4% year-on-year increase for May, in-line with Wall Street estimates and marking the fastest jump since 1992. However, it is important to note that the report is still reflecting \u201cbase effects\u201d as prices rebound from the pandemic-induced collapse last year. \n\nYesterday, the Federal Reserve released the results of its \u201cstress test\u201d on US banks, an annual test instituted after the 2008 financial crisis meant to determine the financial health of lenders during an extreme hypothetical financial crisis (not unlike what was experienced last year).The test used a hypothetical \u201cseverely adverse\u201d scenario where the U.S. economy saw GDP shrink by 4%, the unemployment rate rise to 10.75%, and the stock market contract by 55%. In the end, the test showed the 23 largest banks could withstand $474 billion in losses from loans and other positions and still emerge with more than double the minimum required capital.\n\nThe results of this stress test are extremely important because last year, during the height of the pandemic, the Fed imposed restrictions on banks on capital distributions like dividends and buybacks in order to ensure banks would have enough capital to weather the storm. Given the clean bill of health, these restrictions have now been fully lifted, paving the way for banks across the board to raise dividends and ramp up stock buyback programs. To put in extent how much money this is, the six largest banks in the US - Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup, Goldman Sachs (GS), JP Morgan (JPM), Morgan Stanley (MS) and Wells Fargo (WFC) - are expected to increase payouts by $66 billion to $130 billion over the next four quarters.\n\nIn other news, President Joe Biden announced he had reached an infrastructure agreement with a bipartisan group of senators, which catalyzed a jump in industrial stocks that had been lagging the last few weeks. The deal, which would cost $1.2 trillion over the next five years, commits  $312 billion toward traditional infrastructure priorities such as roads, bridges, public transit, airports and waterways. The bulk of the remainder will be invested in water, broadband and power grid restoration, according to a fact sheet provided by the White House. \n\nGabriela Santos, global market strategist at JP Morgan said, \u201cThe way we're thinking about it is, it has the positive side of the deal in terms of the equity market perspective: More spending on physical infrastructure, electric vehicles, 5G and broadband, without the tax increases which would have been a negative from the equity market perspective. This is certainly a positive especially for the more domestic, cyclical-heavy parts of the market, as well as parts of technology like semiconductors, which are more related to the 5G and the green theme.\" \n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Yesterday, ARK Investment Manager Cathie Wood and Twitter and Square (SQ) CEO Jack Dorsey have been named as co-hosts of \u201cThe \u20bf Word,\u201d a new initiative designed to bring business and technology leaders together to discuss how institutions can use digital currencies. Today, through Twitter (TWTR) Jack directly asked Elon to speak at the conference, which he accepted. Will be interesting to see what happens. \n* Panasonic, Tesla\u2019s (TSLA) leading battery supplier, announced it has sold its entire stake in TSLA stock for roughly $3.6 billion. There is no word as to why they did this but Panasonic assured the move would not affect its supply of batteries. Years ago, Panasonic made a $1.6 billion bet on building a joint battery factory with Tesla in Nevada called the Gigafactory. It caused years of losses at Panasonic before the company said this year it was finally turning a quarterly profit.\n* Chinese ride-hailing giant Didi is seeking to IPO in the US, according to the company\u2019s latest regulatory filing. \n* Starbucks CEO denied a Wall Street Journal report that the company was running low in supplies of cups and coffee. CEO Kevin Johnson told Jim Cramer, \u201cthere is no shortage of cups, no shortage of coffee\u201d.\n* **\\*\\*Please note that current stock price was written pre-market and does not reflect intraday changes\\*\\***\n* Accenture (ACN) with a host of target raises. Average price target $330 at Buy. Stock currently around $292\n* Analog Devices (ADI) target raised by Bank of America from $178 to $200 at Buy. Stock currently around $167\n* Carnival Cruises[ ](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24CCL&amp;src=cashtag_click)(CCL) target raised by Stifel Nicolaus from $37 to $39 at Buy. Stock currently around $27.5\n* Darden Restaurants (DRI) with a series of price target upgrades. Stock currently around $140\n   * Morgan Stanley from $156 to $167\n   * Robert W Baird from $152 to $160\n   * Oppenheimer from $165 to $175.\n* FedEx[ ](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24FDX&amp;src=cashtag_click)(FDX) with two target raises. Stock currently around $304. The stock fell today despite posting record earnings. IMO an opportunity may be forming here, we all know how solid a company FDX is.\n   * BMO Capital Markets from $140 to $150\n   * Credit Suisse from $364 to $373 \n* Nike (NKE) with a host of target raises after smashing earnings yesterday. Average price target $170 at Buy. Stock currently around $152 after gapping up 13% after-hours.\n* Roku (ROKU) target raised by Bank of America from $450 to $500 at Buy. Stock currently around $423\n* Signature Bank (SBNY) target raised by Piper Sandler from $270 to $313 at Overweight. Stock currently around $251\n\n\u201cThe greatest glory in living lies not in never falling, but in rising every time we fall.\" -Nelson Mandela",

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, June 28, 2021**\n\nStocks traded mixed today, with the Dow Jones (DIA) underperforming while the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and the Nasdaq (QQQ) kept pushing higher, with each recording new intraday highs, encouraged by the Fed\u2019s outlook that interest rates won\u2019t be raised until 2023. The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield fell, hovering near 1.48%, an encouraging sign for equities. Looking ahead, market participants are waiting for the June Jobs Report, set to be released this Friday. Consensus economists are looking for payroll gains to accelerate to 700,000 in June with an unemployment rate down slightly to 5.7%, with these metrics improving against May's payroll gains of 559,000 and jobless rate of 5.8%. \n\nLast week, President Joe Biden announced he had reached an infrastructure agreement with a bipartisan group of senators, which catalyzed a jump in industrial stocks that had been lagging the last few weeks. The deal, which would cost $1.2 trillion over the next five years, commits  $312 billion toward traditional infrastructure priorities such as roads, bridges, public transit, airports and waterways. The bulk of the remainder will be invested in water, broadband and power grid restoration, according to a fact sheet provided by the White House. \n\nGabriela Santos, global market strategist at JP Morgan said, \u201cThe way we're thinking about it is, it has the positive side of the deal in terms of the equity market perspective: More spending on physical infrastructure, electric vehicles, 5G and broadband, without the tax increases which would have been a negative from the equity market perspective. This is certainly a positive especially for the more domestic, cyclical-heavy parts of the market, as well as parts of technology like semiconductors, which are more related to the 5G and the green theme.\" \n\nMoreover, the Federal Reserve released the results of its \u201cstress test\u201d on US banks, an annual test instituted after the 2008 financial crisis meant to determine the financial health of lenders during an extreme hypothetical financial crisis (not unlike what was experienced last year).The test used a hypothetical \u201cseverely adverse\u201d scenario where the U.S. economy saw GDP shrink by 4%, the unemployment rate rise to 10.75%, and the stock market contract by 55%. In the end, the test showed the 23 largest banks could withstand $474 billion in losses from loans and other positions and still emerge with more than double the minimum required capital.\n\nThe results of this stress test are extremely important because last year, during the height of the pandemic, the Fed imposed restrictions on banks on capital distributions like dividends and buybacks in order to ensure banks would have enough capital to weather the storm. Given the clean bill of health, these restrictions have now been fully lifted, paving the way for banks across the board to raise dividends and ramp up stock buyback programs.\n\nLooking ahead, market participants are gearing up for Q2 earnings season, which is expected to be a repeat of Q1 record-setting season, with earnings expected to continue being super-charged by stronger than expected demand from savings-loaden consumers and the continued reopening of the US economy thanks to effective distribution of the coronavirus vaccine. So far, analysts are looking for S&amp;P 500 earnings to grow by 61.9% year-on-year in aggregate, according to FactSet data \u2013 an estimate UBS's Head of Equity Derivatives Research Stuart Kaiser said may still be \"need to be revised higher.\" \n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Facebook (FB) stock surged after a judge dismissed federal antitrust lawsuits and most of the ones filed by individual states. U.S. District Judge James Boasberg in Washington granted the social-media giant's requests to dismiss lawsuits filed by the Federal Trade Commission and state attorneys general in December.\n* Walt Disney Co's cruise division said on Monday it is postponing its first test cruise from a U.S. port after a few volunteers showed \"inconsistent\" test results for COVID-19.\n* JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. said it has taken a 40% ownership stake in C6 Bank, a full-service Brazilian digital bank. Terms of the transaction were not publicly disclosed, as far as I can see. \n* \\- United Airlines was putting the finishing touches on Monday to an airplane order potentially worth $30 billion at list values for up to 270 narrowbody jets in a bid to secure a pandemic recovery at favorable prices, industry sources said. The order could include up to 200 Boeing 737 MAX and some 70 Airbus A321neo.\n* LegalZoom, a legal services software compan, has filed with US authorities with the intent to IPO\n* Popular donut-maker, Krispy Kreme has also filed with US authorities with the intent to IPO soon.\n* **\\*\\*Please note that current stock price was written pre-market and does not reflect intraday changes\\*\\***\n* Accenture (ACN) target raised by Barclays from $310 to $335 at Overweight.

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, June 24, 2021**\n\nThe market edged higher once again, with both the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Nasdaq (QQQ) driven higher by an incredible rally in technology stocks. The Dow Jones (DIA), which suffered its worst performance since October 2020 last week continued to recover, pushed higher by a rally in bank and industrial stocks. \u201cReopening stocks\u201d like cruise lines, hotels, and airlines continue to underperform the market, pressured by the rotation back to growth and concerns that inflation will drive prices in this sector higher. \n\nAfter driving the market higher in the beginning of the year, the last two or so months have seen the market firmly rotate from value and cyclical stocks back to growth and technology stocks due to recent inflationary numbers and labor market disruption that threaten to drive prices for services in this sector higher. However, as I have said previously, while I acknowledge the risk, I am not yet concerned that current inflation will become a persistent threat, at least in the near-term. While that may change and I advise people to be ready in case the Fed is forced to tighten rates sooner-than-expected, I expect value and cyclicals to continue recovering as the US economy continues to reopen. With the stock market\u2019s great performance in the last 12-14 months and government coronavirus stimulus, I expect savings-laden consumers to spend big this summer after being cooped up indoors for so long. \n\nKeith Lerner, Portfolio and Market Strategist at Truist Securities said, \u201cThe value trade is still intact. It got overcrowded, it got over-loved ... but when we look at the fundamental drivers behind that trade, they're still intact. So the first thing is, context. Yes, they had a big run this year, but they've trailed for about 14 years, so we've had a long underperformance cycle,\" he added. \"And the second part is, why did they underperform for so long is because we had really slow economic growth. And this year and next we expect above-trend economic growth. And the earnings momentum and the earnings leverage for these areas is still positive.\" \n\nLater today, the Fed is set to release the results of its \u201cstress test\u201d on the US largest banks, an annual test meant to test the financial health of lenders that was instituted following the 2009 financial crisis. The tests are designed to see how banks would fare during a hypothetical extreme economic downturn (not unlike what banks experienced last year). This stress test is extremely important because last year, during the height of the pandemic, the Fed imposed restrictions on banks on capital distributions like dividends and buybacks in order to ensure banks would have enough capital to weather the storm. Thanks to those measures, plus low interest rates and government stimulus that held off loan losses, analysts expect banks to perform well on Thursday, which would lead the Fed to lift remaining capital distribution curbs, opening the floodgates for banks to increase dividends and reinstitute stock buy back programs. **If these restrictions are fully lifted, the six largest banks in the US - Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup, Goldman Sachs (GS), JP Morgan (JPM), Morgan Stanley (MS) and Wells Fargo (WFC) - are expected to increase payouts by $66 billion to $130 billion over the next four quarters. This is huge if it happens.** \n\nOn Friday, Later this week, investors will receive the latest update on core personal consumption expenditures (PCE), which serves as the Fed's preferred gauge of inflation. The report due for release on Friday is expected to register a 3.4% year-on-year increase for May, marking the fastest jump since 1992, albeit while still reflecting \"base effects\" as prices rebound after last year's pandemic-induced collapse in prices across the board\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* **As I was finishing the recap the news is out, the Fed is ending pandemic-era restriction on banks in stock buybacks and dividend increases. This is great news for banks.** More information here [https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/24/business/fed-bank-stress-tests.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/24/business/fed-bank-stress-tests.html)\n* After being under pressure in recent months, shares of Tesla (TSLA) have begun rallying again, with the stock up more than 10% this week alone. \n* Today, Microsoft will unveil the long-awaited sequel to Windows 10. Windows 11, the product's first new version in almost six years, includes only limited changes to its visual design, but it seeks to reposition the operating system as a hub in a computing universe incorporating rival companies' platforms, including Android mobile software developed by Google and a digital storefront developed by Amazon (AMZN).[ Read more here ](https://www.cnet.com/news/microsofts-windows-11-reveal-event-every-upgrade-announced/)\n* The House Judiciary Committee voted on Thursday to approve the final piece of its six-part package, the \"Ending Platform Monopolies Act,\" which restricts big tech companies' ability to leverage their platform dominance to promote other lines of business and disadvantage competitors. The vote on the bill was 21-20. The bill will now move on to the House floor and, if passed there, the Senate. The bill is newsworthy but pretty much doomed to fail.\n* Snapchat (SNAP) users globally will get access to Universal Music Group's library of recorded music and content for their own content-making on the social media platform, the companies said Thursday. This move comes as US social media companies across the board continue to implement more \u201cTikTok-like\u201d features. To show just how much TikTok has grown, parent company ByteDancehas a market cap of roughly $250 billion, almost $100 billion more than Snap and Twitter (TWTR) combined. \n* **Cathie Wood** and Twitter and Square (SQ) CEO Jack Dorsey have been named as co-hosts of \u201cThe \u20bf Word,\u201d a new initiative designed to bring business and technology leaders together to discuss how institutions can use digital currencies. \n* **\\*\\*Please note current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect closing prices\\*\\***\n* Apple (AAPL) target raised by Morgan Stanley from $161 to $162 at Overweight.

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, June 28, 2021**\n\nStocks traded mixed today, with the Dow Jones (DIA) underperforming while the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and the Nasdaq (QQQ) kept pushing higher, with each recording new intraday highs, encouraged by the Fed\u2019s outlook that interest rates won\u2019t be raised until 2023. The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield fell, hovering near 1.48%, an encouraging sign for equities. Looking ahead, market participants are waiting for the June Jobs Report, set to be released this Friday. Consensus economists are looking for payroll gains to accelerate to 700,000 in June with an unemployment rate down slightly to 5.7%, with these metrics improving against May's payroll gains of 559,000 and jobless rate of 5.8%. \n\nLast week, President Joe Biden announced he had reached an infrastructure agreement with a bipartisan group of senators, which catalyzed a jump in industrial stocks that had been lagging the last few weeks. The deal, which would cost $1.2 trillion over the next five years, commits  $312 billion toward traditional infrastructure priorities such as roads, bridges, public transit, airports and waterways. The bulk of the remainder will be invested in water, broadband and power grid restoration, according to a fact sheet provided by the White House. \n\nGabriela Santos, global market strategist at JP Morgan said, \u201cThe way we're thinking about it is, it has the positive side of the deal in terms of the equity market perspective: More spending on physical infrastructure, electric vehicles, 5G and broadband, without the tax increases which would have been a negative from the equity market perspective. This is certainly a positive especially for the more domestic, cyclical-heavy parts of the market, as well as parts of technology like semiconductors, which are more related to the 5G and the green theme.\" \n\nMoreover, the Federal Reserve released the results of its \u201cstress test\u201d on US banks, an annual test instituted after the 2008 financial crisis meant to determine the financial health of lenders during an extreme hypothetical financial crisis (not unlike what was experienced last year).The test used a hypothetical \u201cseverely adverse\u201d scenario where the U.S. economy saw GDP shrink by 4%, the unemployment rate rise to 10.75%, and the stock market contract by 55%. In the end, the test showed the 23 largest banks could withstand $474 billion in losses from loans and other positions and still emerge with more than double the minimum required capital.\n\nThe results of this stress test are extremely important because last year, during the height of the pandemic, the Fed imposed restrictions on banks on capital distributions like dividends and buybacks in order to ensure banks would have enough capital to weather the storm. Given the clean bill of health, these restrictions have now been fully lifted, paving the way for banks across the board to raise dividends and ramp up stock buyback programs.\n\nLooking ahead, market participants are gearing up for Q2 earnings season, which is expected to be a repeat of Q1 record-setting season, with earnings expected to continue being super-charged by stronger than expected demand from savings-loaden consumers and the continued reopening of the US economy thanks to effective distribution of the coronavirus vaccine. So far, analysts are looking for S&amp;P 500 earnings to grow by 61.9% year-on-year in aggregate, according to FactSet data \u2013 an estimate UBS's Head of Equity Derivatives Research Stuart Kaiser said may still be \"need to be revised higher.\" \n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Facebook (FB) stock surged after a judge dismissed federal antitrust lawsuits and most of the ones filed by individual states. U.S. District Judge James Boasberg in Washington granted the social-media giant's requests to dismiss lawsuits filed by the Federal Trade Commission and state attorneys general in December.\n* Walt Disney Co's cruise division said on Monday it is postponing its first test cruise from a U.S. port after a few volunteers showed \"inconsistent\" test results for COVID-19.\n* JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. said it has taken a 40% ownership stake in C6 Bank, a full-service Brazilian digital bank. Terms of the transaction were not publicly disclosed, as far as I can see. \n* \\- United Airlines was putting the finishing touches on Monday to an airplane order potentially worth $30 billion at list values for up to 270 narrowbody jets in a bid to secure a pandemic recovery at favorable prices, industry sources said. The order could include up to 200 Boeing 737 MAX and some 70 Airbus A321neo.\n* LegalZoom, a legal services software compan, has filed with US authorities with the intent to IPO\n* Popular donut-maker, Krispy Kreme has also filed with US authorities with the intent to IPO soon.\n* **\\*\\*Please note that current stock price was written pre-market and does not reflect intraday changes\\*\\***\n* Accenture (ACN) target raised by Barclays from $310 to $335 at Overweight.

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, June 24, 2021**\n\nThe market edged higher once again, with both the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Nasdaq (QQQ) driven higher by an incredible rally in technology stocks. The Dow Jones (DIA), which suffered its worst performance since October 2020 last week continued to recover, pushed higher by a rally in bank and industrial stocks. \u201cReopening stocks\u201d like cruise lines, hotels, and airlines continue to underperform the market, pressured by the rotation back to growth and concerns that inflation will drive prices in this sector higher. \n\nAfter driving the market higher in the beginning of the year, the last two or so months have seen the market firmly rotate from value and cyclical stocks back to growth and technology stocks due to recent inflationary numbers and labor market disruption that threaten to drive prices for services in this sector higher. However, as I have said previously, while I acknowledge the risk, I am not yet concerned that current inflation will become a persistent threat, at least in the near-term. While that may change and I advise people to be ready in case the Fed is forced to tighten rates sooner-than-expected, I expect value and cyclicals to continue recovering as the US economy continues to reopen. With the stock market\u2019s great performance in the last 12-14 months and government coronavirus stimulus, I expect savings-laden consumers to spend big this summer after being cooped up indoors for so long. \n\nKeith Lerner, Portfolio and Market Strategist at Truist Securities said, \u201cThe value trade is still intact. It got overcrowded, it got over-loved ... but when we look at the fundamental drivers behind that trade, they're still intact. So the first thing is, context. Yes, they had a big run this year, but they've trailed for about 14 years, so we've had a long underperformance cycle,\" he added. \"And the second part is, why did they underperform for so long is because we had really slow economic growth. And this year and next we expect above-trend economic growth. And the earnings momentum and the earnings leverage for these areas is still positive.\" \n\nLater today, the Fed is set to release the results of its \u201cstress test\u201d on the US largest banks, an annual test meant to test the financial health of lenders that was instituted following the 2009 financial crisis. The tests are designed to see how banks would fare during a hypothetical extreme economic downturn (not unlike what banks experienced last year). This stress test is extremely important because last year, during the height of the pandemic, the Fed imposed restrictions on banks on capital distributions like dividends and buybacks in order to ensure banks would have enough capital to weather the storm. Thanks to those measures, plus low interest rates and government stimulus that held off loan losses, analysts expect banks to perform well on Thursday, which would lead the Fed to lift remaining capital distribution curbs, opening the floodgates for banks to increase dividends and reinstitute stock buy back programs. **If these restrictions are fully lifted, the six largest banks in the US - Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup, Goldman Sachs (GS), JP Morgan (JPM), Morgan Stanley (MS) and Wells Fargo (WFC) - are expected to increase payouts by $66 billion to $130 billion over the next four quarters. This is huge if it happens.** \n\nOn Friday, Later this week, investors will receive the latest update on core personal consumption expenditures (PCE), which serves as the Fed's preferred gauge of inflation. The report due for release on Friday is expected to register a 3.4% year-on-year increase for May, marking the fastest jump since 1992, albeit while still reflecting \"base effects\" as prices rebound after last year's pandemic-induced collapse in prices across the board\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* **As I was finishing the recap the news is out, the Fed is ending pandemic-era restriction on banks in stock buybacks and dividend increases. This is great news for banks.** More information here [https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/24/business/fed-bank-stress-tests.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/24/business/fed-bank-stress-tests.html)\n* After being under pressure in recent months, shares of Tesla (TSLA) have begun rallying again, with the stock up more than 10% this week alone. \n* Today, Microsoft will unveil the long-awaited sequel to Windows 10. Windows 11, the product's first new version in almost six years, includes only limited changes to its visual design, but it seeks to reposition the operating system as a hub in a computing universe incorporating rival companies' platforms, including Android mobile software developed by Google and a digital storefront developed by Amazon (AMZN).[ Read more here ](https://www.cnet.com/news/microsofts-windows-11-reveal-event-every-upgrade-announced/)\n* The House Judiciary Committee voted on Thursday to approve the final piece of its six-part package, the \"Ending Platform Monopolies Act,\" which restricts big tech companies' ability to leverage their platform dominance to promote other lines of business and disadvantage competitors. The vote on the bill was 21-20. The bill will now move on to the House floor and, if passed there, the Senate. The bill is newsworthy but pretty much doomed to fail.\n* Snapchat (SNAP) users globally will get access to Universal Music Group's library of recorded music and content for their own content-making on the social media platform, the companies said Thursday. This move comes as US social media companies across the board continue to implement more \u201cTikTok-like\u201d features. To show just how much TikTok has grown, parent company ByteDancehas a market cap of roughly $250 billion, almost $100 billion more than Snap and Twitter (TWTR) combined. \n* **Cathie Wood** and Twitter and Square (SQ) CEO Jack Dorsey have been named as co-hosts of \u201cThe \u20bf Word,\u201d a new initiative designed to bring business and technology leaders together to discuss how institutions can use digital currencies. \n* **\\*\\*Please note current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect closing prices\\*\\***\n* Apple (AAPL) target raised by Morgan Stanley from $161 to $162 at Overweight.

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, June 25, 2021**\n\n***Please note:*** *I've seen a lot of questions surrounding the analyst price target upgrades that I post, so I just wanted to clear some things up and explain my reasoning behind including them.*\n\n*I frequently get asked if I think  analyst price target predictions are \"accurate\" or if I expect a stock I mention to hit the price predicted.* ***The answer to both these questions is NO.*** \n\n*I really don't put much, if any importance, on the actual numbers predicted by an analyst. They are just a meter to gauge how bullish or bearish they are. My purpose in including price target upgrades is to find trends in analyst thinking. In other words, if I see a bunch of different, well-known analysts all giving bullish target increases on a stock, I'll start doing research on a stock to see why they are so bullish. I have found quite a few profitable trades in this manner.*\n\n*In short, the purpose of the price target upgrades is idea generation. Keep an eye out if you start seeing the same stock receiving bullish target increases by different analysts.*\n\nStocks were mixed, but mostly positive today, with the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) recording a fresh intraday high and the Dow Jones (DIA) nicely continuing its recovery after falling last week, driven higher by a boost in bank stocks across the board after the Fed removed all pandemic-era restrictions on capital distributions. The Nasdaq (QQQ) fell modestly after several days of reaching new all-time highs. The core personal consumption expenditures, which serves as the Fed\u2019s preferred gauge for inflation was released but did not adversely affect the market, another signal the market is prepared to stomach higher than usual inflationary readings as the economy continues to recover. \n\nThe core PCE index measures the changes in prices paid by consumers for goods and services, minus volatile food and energy prices, which are staples and therefore not considered in the equation. The report registered a 3.4% year-on-year increase for May, in-line with Wall Street estimates and marking the fastest jump since 1992. However, it is important to note that the report is still reflecting \u201cbase effects\u201d as prices rebound from the pandemic-induced collapse last year. \n\nYesterday, the Federal Reserve released the results of its \u201cstress test\u201d on US banks, an annual test instituted after the 2008 financial crisis meant to determine the financial health of lenders during an extreme hypothetical financial crisis (not unlike what was experienced last year).The test used a hypothetical \u201cseverely adverse\u201d scenario where the U.S. economy saw GDP shrink by 4%, the unemployment rate rise to 10.75%, and the stock market contract by 55%. In the end, the test showed the 23 largest banks could withstand $474 billion in losses from loans and other positions and still emerge with more than double the minimum required capital.\n\nThe results of this stress test are extremely important because last year, during the height of the pandemic, the Fed imposed restrictions on banks on capital distributions like dividends and buybacks in order to ensure banks would have enough capital to weather the storm. Given the clean bill of health, these restrictions have now been fully lifted, paving the way for banks across the board to raise dividends and ramp up stock buyback programs. To put in extent how much money this is, the six largest banks in the US - Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup, Goldman Sachs (GS), JP Morgan (JPM), Morgan Stanley (MS) and Wells Fargo (WFC) - are expected to increase payouts by $66 billion to $130 billion over the next four quarters.\n\nIn other news, President Joe Biden announced he had reached an infrastructure agreement with a bipartisan group of senators, which catalyzed a jump in industrial stocks that had been lagging the last few weeks. The deal, which would cost $1.2 trillion over the next five years, commits  $312 billion toward traditional infrastructure priorities such as roads, bridges, public transit, airports and waterways. The bulk of the remainder will be invested in water, broadband and power grid restoration, according to a fact sheet provided by the White House. \n\nGabriela Santos, global market strategist at JP Morgan said, \u201cThe way we're thinking about it is, it has the positive side of the deal in terms of the equity market perspective: More spending on physical infrastructure, electric vehicles, 5G and broadband, without the tax increases which would have been a negative from the equity market perspective. This is certainly a positive especially for the more domestic, cyclical-heavy parts of the market, as well as parts of technology like semiconductors, which are more related to the 5G and the green theme.\" \n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Yesterday, ARK Investment Manager Cathie Wood and Twitter and Square (SQ) CEO Jack Dorsey have been named as co-hosts of \u201cThe \u20bf Word,\u201d a new initiative designed to bring business and technology leaders together to discuss how institutions can use digital currencies. Today, through Twitter (TWTR) Jack directly asked Elon to speak at the conference, which he accepted. Will be interesting to see what happens. \n* Panasonic, Tesla\u2019s (TSLA) leading battery supplier, announced it has sold its entire stake in TSLA stock for roughly $3.6 billion. There is no word as to why they did this but Panasonic assured the move would not affect its supply of batteries. Years ago, Panasonic made a $1.6 billion bet on building a joint battery factory with Tesla in Nevada called the Gigafactory. It caused years of losses at Panasonic before the company said this year it was finally turning a quarterly profit.\n* Chinese ride-hailing giant Didi is seeking to IPO in the US, according to the company\u2019s latest regulatory filing. \n* Starbucks CEO denied a Wall Street Journal report that the company was running low in supplies of cups and coffee. CEO Kevin Johnson told Jim Cramer, \u201cthere is no shortage of cups, no shortage of coffee\u201d.\n* **\\*\\*Please note that current stock price was written pre-market and does not reflect intraday changes\\*\\***\n* Accenture (ACN) with a host of target raises. Average price target $330 at Buy. Stock currently around $292\n* Analog Devices (ADI) target raised by Bank of America from $178 to $200 at Buy. Stock currently around $167\n* Carnival Cruises[ ](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24CCL&amp;src=cashtag_click)(CCL) target raised by Stifel Nicolaus from $37 to $39 at Buy. Stock currently around $27.5\n* Darden Restaurants (DRI) with a series of price target upgrades. Stock currently around $140\n   * Morgan Stanley from $156 to $167\n   * Robert W Baird from $152 to $160\n   * Oppenheimer from $165 to $175.\n* FedEx[ ](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24FDX&amp;src=cashtag_click)(FDX) with two target raises. Stock currently around $304. The stock fell today despite posting record earnings. IMO an opportunity may be forming here, we all know how solid a company FDX is.\n   * BMO Capital Markets from $140 to $150\n   * Credit Suisse from $364 to $373 \n* Nike (NKE) with a host of target raises after smashing earnings yesterday. Average price target $170 at Buy. Stock currently around $152 after gapping up 13% after-hours.\n* Roku (ROKU) target raised by Bank of America from $450 to $500 at Buy. Stock currently around $423\n* Signature Bank (SBNY) target raised by Piper Sandler from $270 to $313 at Overweight.

        "selftext": "As usual for me, I took some of my adderall prescription and it drove me to write a DD on my most watched stocks at the moment.\n\nApplied Matterials Inc ($AMAT) is a large-cap stock, and I base my play upon it's high quality and strong momentum; as well as confidence in semi-conductor stocks. AMAT provides manufacturing equipment, services and software to the semiconductor, display and related industries.\n\nApplied Materials is the leading producer of equipment and materials for producing microchips, TV's (OLED's/LCD's), and solar panels. They also have their services business which offers manufacturing consulting and automation software. They are based in California, but have factories around the world, with Asian customers accounting for 80% of it's revenue.\n\nTo summarise:\n\n- Semi-conductor systems make 60% of revenue, this is for equipment used to manufacture semiconductor devices such as microprocessors and memory.\n\n- Applied global services provide a quarter of revenue. This is for integrated solutions to optimise equipment, performance and productivity,\n\n- And the display markets account for 10% of it's revenue. Providing products for manufacturing LCD's and OLED displays.\n\n- It's customers include Apple, HP and Dell.\n\nWith the current silicon shortage, I expect the stock to surge further when this shortage slows down.\n\n- AMAT has been stair stepping higher in the recent bull trend, as a leader in one of the stronger industry groups in tech (semiconductors), I believe it among other semi-conductor stocks are a great buy for a long right now.\n\n- AMAT's 5-year return on Capital Employed is 25.1%, which is a strong indicator that it has the power to grow profitably. AMAT's share price has had a 72.1% return relative to the market over the past 12 months.\n\n- Furthermore, it's earnings outlook is improving. Analysts are still raising their earnings estimates for the company. For the year, the stock currently has an earnings estimate of $6.53 per share, up 56.59% from a year ago.\n\n- AMAT is testing the 10 week line on the weekly chart, after declining recently. This has formed a handle, and if you rebound from here to get above the handle, there could be a breakout.\n\n- As Nvidia recently broke out we could see other semiconductor stocks such as TSM, AMAT, LCRX, and ASML following this pattern.\n\n- ASML is also in the buy range after finding support at the 10-week line.\n\nWhy semi-conductor stocks are a good play: \n- The Innovator IBD Breakout Oppurtunities Index (BOUT) jumped 152% from March 2020 lows before pulling back in February. This ETF is now integrating leading components manufacturers such as DELL, ZBRA, AMAT, LRCX, UCTT, and TER.\n\nJim Cramer himself is now looking at AMAT, TSM and AMD.\n\n\"Cramer recently said that if investors think chips are truly in short supply and we need capital equipment, then the company they most need is Lam Research (LRCX), other than Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM)\"\n\n\"Jim Cramer recently named chip equipment major Applied Materials (AMAT), as one of the stocks that got away.\n\nHe called out the bull market in semiconductor equipment. We need to make more chips, he said, and companies like Applied Materials can make that happen.\n\nThe semiconductor equipment major reported mixed fiscal-second-quarter earnings and received a number of positive reviews and price-target upgrades from Wall Street analysts.\"\n\nAnyway, aside from Cramer there are many other reasons to own semi-conductor stocks.\n\nOne of my primary reasons is the growth in data centre demand. This was why I bought NVDA calls at $620, aside from the stock-split. AMD is also bringing out new data-centre GPUs.\n\n- There has been a huge growth in demand for data centre equipment, due to the rise in work-from-home driving data centre's to increase their cloud-storage capacities. This has fuelled demand for data-centre chips from data centre operators.\n\n- The data centre market is expected to grow to $519.34 billion during 2021-2025, driven by the growing clout of cloud services and digitization. Further, increase in adoption of multi-cloud and network upgrade to support 5G is fueling growth.\n\n- New semiconductor manufacturing processes from 10nm, 7nm, to 5nm and 3nm has opened new business avenues.\n\n- 5G deployment is spuring further sector growth.\n\n- VR and AR devices, gaming, wearables and drones, have grown in use due to Coronavirus - hence leading to a increase in usage of online services globablly.\n\n- Improvements in DRAM and NAND pricing are fueling semi-conductor stocks catering to the memory market.\n\n- AMD, and TSM delivered good performance in the first quarter driven by data centre demand.\n\nI think my adderall has worn off now, but I will update with a part 2 later on. I'm going to open a position in TSMC, AMAT, LCRX, and ASML today. I will look at AMD also.",

        "selftext": "The global semi-conductor shortage, aka chip shortage, has been crippling many industries. Demand for chips is continuing to outstrip supply and the car industry is longer the only one feeling the pain. Many auto-makers are actually limiting the amount of cars produced in 2021, including Ford recently who announced they will be canceling weeks worth of production of the F-150.\n\n**Overview**\n\nThere are a few factors at play giving analysts the impression that this shortage may last until early 2022. There\u2019s a few KEY points that come to mind:\n\n* Most chips are produced overseas: Covid-related delays in shipping ports have effected supply coming into the United States.\n* China has been stock-piling chips: Chinese businesses have bought an absurd amount of chip-producing equipment (roughly $32 billion) in an effort to protect themselves from further US sanctions.\n* Demand for electronic products have soared.\n* Often over-looked, consumers don\u2019t realize the amount of chips it takes to build cars in 2021. The trend is continuing in the same direction as many analysts expect the automative industry to begin predominantly developing cars with network connectivity.\n\nThis leaves an opportunity for those willing to look past the hardship some of these companies are experiencing of being unable to meet demand. The semi-conductor industry is expected to grow at CAGR of roughly \\~9% over the next 7-8 years. I see this as a relatively conservative number and it is my opinion that we are heading into a super-cycle of chip upgrades, processing power, and memory devices. Here are a few reasons:\n\n1. We are already seeing noticeable shift in demand and the way consumers are interacting in a new digital world.\n2. These electronics are becoming faster and more powerful, which simply requires a larger quantity &amp; quality of chips.\n3. More and more devices rely on connectivity and the car industry is now making it\u2019s way onto a similar path.\n4. Following Nvidia\u2019s earnings call we are seeing a large rise in trends for AI and machine-learning which is leading to increased demand for the required components.\n5. The rise of crypto mining will also play a role in the increased demand.\n\n**The Players**\n\nMany of the chip-related plays have already seen convincing growth over the last 12 months. However, several names have recently followed the markets to the downside and currently pose a potential good entry point. This secular trend in semi-conductor demand over the next several years is here to stay.\n\nMy semis watchlist is holding some familiar names: Applied Materials (AMAT), ASML Holdings (ASML), Skyworks Solutions (SWKS), Nvidia (NVDA), Intel (INTC), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Qualcomm (QCOM), and Taiwan Semiconductors (TSM).\n\nThe ones that make my shortlist are the following: NVDA, AMD, TSM, and AMAT. Here\u2019s a look at the 2-year chart for the 4 tickers mentioned above.\u00a0\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xr0kge6rq2371.png?width=2380&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c4beece1276b8c383ed5a2c0cca07bf40f42da11\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt is clear the secular trend in computer chips and processors have contributed greatly to the growth of these companies. Let\u2019s take a look at a shorter time-frame. Here\u2019s the 3-month chart for the same list of tickers.\u00a0\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pip83wxqq2371.png?width=2388&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b353b714f1958233646a57ee5680bf2385ee2a3d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLooking at it from another angle we see AMD and TSM have been lagging behind the performance of AMAT and NVDA, who are on a nearly identical path. TSM is a leading manufacturer of chips and actually supplies most of AMD\u2019s chips. They are based in Taiwan and there have been some concerns over the potential invasion of China. Setting those concerns aside these companies may still experience strong growth. My plays right now are in AMD and TSM and I will feel comfortable adding to any of the names I mentioned in this article if the right entry point shows itself.\n\n**Final Thoughts**\n\nI would love to say here\u2019s why \u201cx\u201d company is in a better financial position than company \u201cy\u201d, but in this case I believe the high demand for semiconductors will benefit most names participating in this industry. Of course, not every company is made equal so please do your own research before investing in any stocks. In my opinion, this industry is in an upward secular trend and demand remains in-tact, providing tailwinds to the participants.\n\nKeep an eye on earnings reports and financial data of companies that BUY these products. Look at phone, tablet, computer manufacturers (Apple), cloud server providers, Google server expansion (also server chip REPLACEMENT rates, which is a thing), and AI/Machine learning projects (autonomous driving, video analysis, big-data processors). It may be years before the growth slows in this industry and these players will stand to largely benefit.",

Disclaimer: I own positions in Intel, Micron, and Applied Materials.\n\nMy understanding is that the bill is largely meant to support and consolidate semiconductor manufacturing and semi cap manufacturing in the U.S. Thus, U.S.-based companies with facilities in the U.S. and that want to develop their semiconductor manufacturing capabilities in the U.S. will be the most likely to receive funding from this law as well as future support from the U.S. government which is aligned with rare bipartisanship to address and neutralize the threat of China\u2019s growing global technological dominance.

The law won\u2019t be signed until toward the end of this year at the earliest. Then, companies will apply for grants to fund projects to build fabs, improve supply chains, etc.\n\nINTC and MU seem like clear favorites to receive funds because they\u2019re U.S.-based IDMs with facilities primarily in the U.S., and they\u2019re often included in news stories related to the bill. TSM and Samsung are outside the U.S., though that doesn\u2019t mean they couldn\u2019t hypothetically receive funds to build a fab in the U.S. But if grants are competitive, then how likely would TSM or Samsung be to receive funds to build a new fab if they were competing with Intel or MU for the same funding, based purely on the intent of the law being to support U.S.-based semiconductor business?\n\nAMAT also seems like a favorite to receive funds even though ASML has a monopoly on the most advanced semi cap equipment. ASML is based in the Netherlands and only has two facilities in the U.S. Also, I speculate that AMAT could use funds from the law to put toward R&amp;D to compete with ASML, but my knowledge in that area is lacking.\n\nIt won\u2019t be until next year before companies can even start applying for funds.

        "selftext": "**tl;dr:** LRCX will benefit tremendously from the US push to produce semiconductors. Buy shares and LEAPS. \n\n**Position:** 103x LRCX shares with DRIP (dividend reinvestment) and 1x 1/2023 $500c.\n\n**The DD:** \n\n* The push within the US to produce semiconductors (microchips) inside American borders has encouraged companies like INTC, TSMC, and Samsung to commit to building multi-million dollar fab plants (semiconductor factories). \n* The semiconductor shortage in general indicates there is demand for more semis.\n* The 5G and IoT rollouts means semiconductor demand will remain high and manufactories are likely to expand further.\n\nLRCX is well-positioned to make money off this. LRCX builds the machines and does the research that these other companies need to make microchips. Without LRCX, there are no manufactories. And after the fab plants are built, the machines need maintenance. LRCX provides this maintenance at 30%+ margins.\n\n**Fundamentals:**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Beats Earnings](https://preview.redd.it/t67m821yap471.png?width=407&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=37ee8d9b94a3a0f5bfcb12d1fb6317bb5747c0fa)\n\nLRCX has beat earnings 4/4 of the last quarters. It has the growth potential to continue beating earnings.\n\nAt a 27 P/E ratio, its valuation is average in its industry and has room to climb.\n\n**Technicals:** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Up and to the right](https://preview.redd.it/xwr8epatap471.png?width=559&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cc38dae385b63dcd764d4509061508a2cf9206ed)\n\nLRCX goes up and to the right. It has the fundamental backing to continue. Demand for shares increases as the stock gets down to $600.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[RSI, MACD, Moving Averages](https://preview.redd.it/85xb9jk9bp471.png?width=898&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e471b714290c3175f09ac20a21b391f4e2ea7b88)\n\nMACD looks like shit, but RSI is positive and LRCX travels along its 50-DMA pretty well. Look to start DCAing into shares around this level and buy more shares or LEAPS as we approach $600.\n\n**Competition:**\n\nAMAT competes with LRCX in most industry segments. However LRCX stands out as the best wafer developer. If you cannot afford LRCX at $600, AMAT is $136. AMAT is also more diversified and is a good alternative choice.\n\nThere are some others including a Dutch company, but AMAT and LRCX are the main competitors in this industry, and they both have a wide moat.",

Once the Stochastic RSI forms a bull cross on the day candles and only if the RSI is less than a constant value of 20. This has returned almost a 90% success rate in a little over a year. Once this triggers again, I will buy SPY weekly calls and only taking profit after 2-3 days.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/954ou9mexr271.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2b929f2be8714b46823df5b865ef52d3ef3353b3\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n \n\nThe Travelers Companies, Inc., through its subsidiaries, provides a range of commercial and personal property, and casualty insurance products and services to businesses, government units, associations, and individuals in the United states and internationally.

If it pulls back to this support, I believe calls up to $170 will work well here. TRV has been trading within a paralell channel since May of last year. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xad3g2bgxr271.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=86ec7c94e2da33f7d521365ef3d7916f9eef80cd\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ \n\nDisclaimer: The comments opinions and analysis expressed herein are for informational and educational purpose only and should not be considered as individual advice or recommendations.
