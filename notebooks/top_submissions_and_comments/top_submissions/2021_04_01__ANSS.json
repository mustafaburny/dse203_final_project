        "selftext": "Microvision (MVIS) Investment Thesis\n\nDisclaimer: I am not a financial or investment advisor.\n\nDisclaimer: This is a monster stock.\n\nNote: I have attempted to pull together the business case and investment thesis and summary of recent compelling events based on the work of many in the MicroVision community, including u/S2upid and u/BigBlackWifey to name a few, with the intent of spreading the word about this great company with massive potential.\n\nMany of you may have first heard about MicroVision due to the recent news of the $21.9B Us military contract awarded to Microsoft for over 120,000 IVAS/HoloLens 2 headsets over the next 10 years. \n\nThis is significant for MicroVision because their tech is in these headsets. We know this because the now infamous Hololens 2tear down by u/S2upid \nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/MVIS/comments/gm1i2f/hololens_2_teardown_the_hunt_for_mvis/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf\n\nThis is why MVIS spiked 50% following the news.\n\nFull article: www.cnbc.com/2021/03/31/microsoft-wins-contract-to-make-modified-hololens-for-us-army.html\n\nThis deal will surely lead to an significant increase in MicroVision\u2019s AR vertical revenue, however, the military contract is just the tip of the iceberg...\n\nThe big PR that everyone has been waiting for has yet to drop... MicroVision has best-in-class 4D LiDAR for with technical specs and price per unit meeting or exceeding OEM autonomous driving requirements.\nThe company has announced at the last EC that the LiDAR A-Sample will be complete in April 21, and all signs point to a buyout already being negotiated with Google for the Auto Lidar vertical and possibly Microsoft for the AR divisions... there could be a bidding war soon unless a deal has already been inked. \n\nhttps://www.griproom.com/fun/10-signs-your-company-is-about-to-be-acquired\n\nLet\u2019s connect some dots...\n\nSummary of the recent compelling events:\nNote: Some of the below DD based on summary from u/t-jameson-corazon \n\nFeb, 2020 - CEO Sumit Sharma takes the reins. Sumit used to be Director of Google Glass. \n\nJune, 2020 - Mark Spitzer joins the BoD. Spitzer has ties to Google. \n\nQ3 2020 - Ford announced a stake in Velodyne (VLDR), a competitor in automotive LiDAR.\n\nDec, 2020 - Judy Curran (Ford) joins the Microvision BoD.\n\nJudy Curran previously held executive positions at Ford Motor Co. She has more than 30 years of experience in vehicle program, engineering, and technology leadership. Curran currently serves as Head of Global Automotive Strategy at ANSYS, a developer of multiphysics engineering simulation software. ANSYS could conduct testing for interested parties to have benchmark data.\n\nFord and Google have a strategic partnership.\n\n2/1/21 - State of Michigan has purchased 1 Million shares of MVIS (not $1 million worth of MVIS, 1 Million SHARES)\n\nFord is based in Michigan\n\n2/5/21 - Black rock buys 2.4 million SHARES\n\nMid-Feb 21 - Ford sold its position in VLDR\n\nFeb 16th 21, MVIS announces a $50M ATM offering agreement with Craig-Hallum Capital Group. This ATM gave MicroVision the Net Working Capital (NWC) needed to facilitate an M&amp;A. This was filed with the SEC in a way that allows MVIS to pay fees based on the current share price and not disclose the future share price (Sign of incoming buyout).\n\nMarch 2nd, 21\u2019 - BoD Bernee D. L. Strom steps down to make room for the newest board member, Seval Oz.\n\nSeval Oz, the newest BoD, is a recognized global business and marketing leader in mobility, autonomous vehicle technology and intelligent transportation systems. \n\nOz was a Founder and CEO of Aurima, Inc, a multi-sensor awareness platform powered by AI deep learning for autonomous vehicles. She was previously CEO of Continental Intelligent Transportation Systems, a division of Continental AG Interiors Division. She has served as Head of Global Strategic Partnerships for Google[x]'s Self Driving Cars Program (Waymo) where she supported global business and marketing efforts for Google\u2019s self-driving technology commercial launch. In addition, she is an executive board advisor to automotive industry leaders and an investment advisor to several investment funds and holds 10 patents in vehicular technology software.  \n\nSeval Oz - \u201cI am thrilled to join the MicroVision board of directors at this opportune time. I am excited to bring my expertise and experience in autonomous vehicle technology and mobility to the Company as it develops its automotive lidar technology and explores strategic alternatives.\u201d\n\nSeval Oz has been on the board for the last month and has not filed a Form 3 or 4 with the SEC yet. The only logical reason for her not doing so is if she is being compensated by the acquiring company (Google). Several BoD\u2019s have stepped down in recent months (to make room for the new appointees) and have not sold their stock.\n\nSumit has repeatedly stated he is interested in exploring strategic alternatives including the sale of a vertical or multiple verticals.  \n\nSumit has repeatedly said he wants to get fair market value for the shareholders.\n\n\u201c\u2060Best in class LiDAR\u201d - Sumit during EC.\n\n\u201cThere is no competition in any verticals\u201d - Sumit.\n\nSumit has staked his and MicroVision\u2019s entire reputation on the April LiDAR A-Sample.\n\nSumit can\u2019t contain himself on the EC and references the internet boom as a simile for his excitement.\n\nWhen asked about the LiDAR competition on the EC, Sumit chuckles and says, \u201cThere is no competition.\u201d\n\nNo fireside chat after Q4 2020 earnings call (They typically have has these but it seems they are trying to say as little as possible, a sign of a buyout being negotiated).\n\nDavid Allen/Investor Relations has not been able to answer most questions over email or the phone.\n\nYalon Farhi - BoD who\u2019s funds kept MVIS alive steps down and retires.\n\nYalon Farhi hasn\u2019t sold.\n\nDavid Westgor steps down as VP General Counsel (This is a sign of an incoming buyout as typically the acquiring party will bring in their own counsel to facilitate the merger).\n\nDavid Westgor hasn\u2019t sold.\n\nSteve Holt (STEVE HOLT!!!)/CFO, exercised his options to buy shares at $17/share a few weeks ago... very interesting that he would choose that time to exercise them... \n\nSeval Oz still hasn\u2019t filed a Form 3 or 4.\n\n\u2060Ever growing new jobs listing.\n\nMicroVision is not attending CES (Worlds largest AR/MR/VR conference) hololens is the best selling AR in the world\n\nLIDAR A-sample reveal in April (April is here) https://www.mviscountdown.com/\n\nChris Grayson thinks Niatech (Google owned) has \u201ca confident guess\u201d that they will be using MicroVision light engines.\n\n3/30/21 - MicroVision follows Elon on Twitter\n\nThe proposed Government infrastructure bill is good for EV and autonomous driving growth tech.\n\nNaked shorts and MM\u2019s are driving the pps down.\n\nNobody is defending the price.\n\nNot even counting patent filings for lasers and scanning devices from MANY interested parties ranging from US to a GLOBAL scale.\n\n66.33% of volume shorted a few days ago... squeeze? https://nakedshortreport.com/company/MVIS\n\nTesla crashing causing increase in liability and eyes pushing for regulation.\n\nMore and MORE FUD across all platforms. The only real argument is that we don\u2019t have a working product that anyone has seen and very little revenue.\n\nThat\u2019s about to change...\n\nHere is a comprehensive breakdown of the entire investment thesis and proof of MicroVision\u2019s superiority in LiDAR and AR provided by u/BigBlackWifey\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ljgtxj/mvis_shiny_laser_go_pew_no_but_seriously_they_are/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf\n\nI have been holding and accumulating since May 2020.\n\nThis is the way.\n\nI am not a financial or investment advisor.",
