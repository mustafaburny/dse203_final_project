        "selftext": "I sold my NET stock few days ago with good profit (at around 57$, 87% up), and I have about 10K worth of WCLD. I was looking into all the holdings of WCLD, and I was surprised there is no akamai (check [https://www.wisdomtree.com/etfs/thematic/wcld](https://www.wisdomtree.com/etfs/thematic/wcld)).\n\nI started digging and I came across this very good comparison of the major cloud companies:\n\n[https://www.codeinwp.com/blog/maxcdn-vs-cloudflare-vs-cloudfront-vs-akamai-edge-vs-fastly/](https://www.codeinwp.com/blog/maxcdn-vs-cloudflare-vs-cloudfront-vs-akamai-edge-vs-fastly/)\n\nas you can see, it seems akamai has like 55% of market share, while NET and FASTLY are around 1%. The blog was from July, but I don't think things have changed dramatically since then. \n\nFrom reading the blog, it seems to me for big companies, akam seems to be the first choice for the biggest websites (facebook, adobe, ibm, to mention few).\n\nThen I started looking into the valuations, and I found this article from today comparing Akamai and Fastly\n\n[https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/10/15/forget-fastly-this-edge-computing-rival-is-the-bet/?source=iedfolrf0000001](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/10/15/forget-fastly-this-edge-computing-rival-is-the-bet/?source=iedfolrf0000001)\n\nIt was very eye opening, specially, the following table below  (Revenue and operating income are Guidances for 2020)\n\n    Company | Revenue | Operating Income  | Mkt Cap | P/S  | P/E   |  P/E (forward)\n    ---------|----------|-----------------|---------| ---- | ------|-----------------\n    FSLY  | $295 M |$7 million| $14.5 B | 54.0 | N/A  | 1,110\n    AKAM  | $3,150 M |$961 million| $18.8 B | 6.1 | 35  | 20.3\n\nThere is another table shown the revenue growth, where FSLY obviously have better figure (62% Q2 revenue growth for FSLY vs 13% for Akam), but Akam is still doing better when you look into margins \n\nI know the cloud market is growing, and Akam will not be able to keep the 55% market share. But still, how come it is almost not discussed here?\n\nSo after this quick research, I am thinking of buying a good 4-6K worth of Akamai. Any reasons why I shouldn't do that?  \n\nPS: Fsly, even after the big drops today and yesterday, is still up around 350% YTD, on the other hand, AKAM is only 26% up (NET is around 250% up YTD)",

        "selftext": "After sneaky WSJ reported \"talks\" of AMD buying Xilinx, we saw roughly a 17% jump in XLNX and a 2% drop in AMD from pre-market to market-open on 10/9.  That jump caught every fucking investing blog and finance news website's attention and by noon:o'clock there were about 20+ articles parading around like this was the biggest news since the Trump got Covid.  Here is why this AMD acquisition will never happen:\n\n/AMD DEBT/\n\nAMD cannot afford it.  They don't have enough cash on hand to make a $30billion deal\n\n[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-10-09/amd-ceo-tries-to-banish-debt-ridden-deal-ghosts-with-xilinx-bid](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-10-09/amd-ceo-tries-to-banish-debt-ridden-deal-ghosts-with-xilinx-bid)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n/Xilinx's Business Model/\n\nXilinx may simply be trying to get acquired and are leaking rumors to get the fire started. See what companies they work with and see the data for yourself here:\n\n[https://csimarket.com/stocks/markets\\_glance.php?code=XLNX](https://csimarket.com/stocks/markets_glance.php?code=XLNX) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n/Xilinx Price Tag/\n\n$30billion offering is already out of AMD's reach (as you can see from the valuations from the articles above). If Xilinx is truly interested in selling their company, then will likely open their doors to other tech giants who will pay more and have a better handle on the sector.  These rumored \"talks\" drive up share value as you have already seen and, if they're smart, they won't sell to anyone... just take the overvaluation and strike up exclusive contracts with all the competing companies who try and buy them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFinally, neither company would even comment on it.  AMD has been aggressive with their business since the induction of their newest CEO.  IMO this was a leak from AMD to illicit conversations with XLNX, but XLNX is too smart to let a company like AMD to swoop them up, even if AMD is trying to play the \"Fuck IBM\" card to pander them into an ethical agreement - or - this was a strategic move by XLNX to start a bidding war over their already stable company because they hit a ceiling in their profit model.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWho knows tho, it's all rumors anyways\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: IDK wtf I'm talking about, but I can say that neither does anyone else on this matter except for our beloved sneaky-ass AMD/XLNX execs \n\n//\n\nAMD $80c 10/16\n\nXLNX $120p 10/16\n\nAVT $27c 2/19",

        "selftext": "From: https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ibm-divestiture-idINKBN26T1TZ\n\n(Reuters) - International Business Machines Corp is splitting itself into two public companies, capping a years-long effort by the world\u2019s first big computing firm to diversify away from its legacy businesses to focus on high-margin cloud computing.\n\nIBM will list its IT infrastructure services unit, which provides technical support for 4,600 clients in 115 countries and has a backlog of $60 billion, as a separate company with a new name by the end of 2021.\n\nThe new company will have 90,000 employees and its leadership structure will be decided in a few months, Chief Financial Officer James Kavanaugh told Reuters.\n\nIBM, which currently has more than 352,000 workers, said it expects to record nearly $5 billion in expenses related to the separation and operational changes.\n\nInvestors cheered the surprise move by Chief Executive Officer Arvind Krishna, the key architect behind IBM\u2019s $34 billion acquisition of cloud company Red Hat last year, sending the company\u2019s shares up 7%.\n\n\u201cWe divested networking back in the \u201890s, we divested PCs back in the 2000s, we divested semiconductors about five years ago because all of them didn\u2019t necessarily play into the integrated value proposition,\u201d Krishna said on a call with analysts.\n\nBIG BLUE\u2019S NEW FOCUS\n\nIn a blog, Krishna called the move a \u201csignificant shift\u201d in the 109-year-old company\u2019s business model.\n\n\u201cIBM is essentially getting rid of a shrinking, low-margin operation given the cannibalizing impact of automation and cloud, masking stronger growth for the rest of the operation,\u201d Wedbush Securities analyst Moshe Katri said.\n\nIBM, which has sought to make up for slowing software sales and seasonal demand for its mainframe servers, said it would now focus on open hybrid cloud and AI solutions that will account for more than half of its recurring revenues.\n\nKrishna, who replaced Ginni Rometty as CEO in April, said IBM\u2019s software and solutions portfolio would account for the majority of company revenue after the separation.\n\nThe company also said it expects third-quarter revenue of $17.6 billion and an adjusted profit per share of $2.58, roughly in line with Street estimates.",

There for most major companies will be more inclined to robots and artificial intelligence \n\nPlus they are makeing good amount of earnings during the pandemic \n\nPlus you don\u2019t have to pay taxes for employing artificial intelligence\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\n\n\nEdit:If you know a stock that is better or equivalent then by all means do tell cuz they ain\u2019t one.\n\nEdit : bill gates and Steve Jobs stole software ideas from ibm and became billionaires. \nGood software can make you a billionaire due to the fact that once made it copied and pasted very cheaply and sold at a high markup such as video games and computer virus protection and most importantly WINDOWS PC UI and APPLE PC UI\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\n\nEdit: I\u2019m not saying buy the stock because I actually waiting for the dip I\u2019m hoping the stock won\u2019t go up but down\n\nEdit: When you walk down the street do you see IBM on the street or when you drive or when you go to the store no they are not a consumer goods product but corporate product. \nPandemic happens corporations cut costs and restructure most companies will want to have less human work force thus AI will take over go to Walmart and look at the self checkout or when you go to a amazon warehouse tell me what you see boy.\n\nEdit: the power of well know product goods in the software community such as\n-oracle\n-snowflake\n-google whom is creating a quantum computer \n-Amazon Relational Database Serves\n-IBM\nWhy is this important because big corporations like to associate with other big corporations \nSuch as apple buys oled screens from Samsung",

        "selftext": "\n \nFor Trading October 9th\n   \nSolid Day\n \nIBM Soars, DPZ Crushed\n \n \nToday\u2019s market was just a good, old-fashioned day without any major moves in the indexes, no earth-shattering tweets or end of days prognostications.  I didn\u2019t have any power, cable or phone last night so besides not putting out my Daily Note or closing comment, I miss the big debate.  Judging by the reports I heard today, all I missed was the fly on Pence\u2019s head!  The DJIA was = 122.06 (.43%), NASDAQ +56.38 (.50%), S&amp;P 500 +27.38 (.80%), the Russell was the big winner again +17.51 (1.09%) and the Transports +72.54 (.62%) and a new all-time high!  The internals were good with NYSE 3:1 and NASDAQ 2:1 positive and all I can say is that it was very a very \u201cGoldilocks\u201d kind of day.\n\nLooking at adding NEM and GLD calls, and a reentry into CVS and UNG calls probably...\n                                                                                                                           \nTonight\u2019s closing comment video: https://youtu.be/lXD_OB9CrYU\n \nSECTORS:  There was good news for holders of Eaton Vance (EV) being taken over by Morgan Stanley (MS) for about $7 billion in cash and stock.  MS was -2.20 premarket but right after the open it started back up and finished $49.35 +.64, and since it included stock, the rise sent EV higher to close $60.78 +19.84 (48.4%).  \nIBM also had news that sent it higher.  They gave guidance and then announced that they are going to split the company up and make the pieces \u201cpure plays\u201d in an effort to get a better valuation for the parts.  It looked great pre-market but by the open it had given up about 1/3 of the gains and finished the day up $7.42 (6%) after the early market up 12%.  Same situation with REGN, trading up to $618 or so +$26, but the stock never made it there when the real market opened\u2026and then traded back to $598 and closed $599.70 +8.00, near the lows, but still ahead 1.24%.\nOn the downside, the DISASTER DU JOUR, was a name that I wrote about last week, WWR, Westwater Resources, which went from $1.52 to $14.50 on news that Mr. Trump had signed an executive order relating to securing \u201crare earth\u201d and critical minerals last week.  As I mentioned, the stock took off from under $2 to $14.50 in 4 days and then reversed and finished the day $7.46 -4.26 (36%).\n \nNew Group:\nAIR &amp; CRUISE LINES were HIGHER with CCL -.22, RCL +1.48, NCLH +.28, AAL +.33, DAL +.67, LUV +.57, UAL +1.06, HA +.55, ALK +1.98, and XTN $61.54 +.77 (1.27%).\n \nFOOD SUPPLY CHAIN was MIXED with TSN +.57, BOS +.03, FLO -.08, CPB +.48, CAG -.35,M MDLZ +.38, KHC +.36, CALM -.14, JJSF -.02, SAFM -1.59, HRL -.23, SJM -.33, PPC -.21, KR +.36, and PBJ $33.64 +.11 (.34%).\n \nBIOPHARMA was HIGHER with BIIB +1.89, ABBV +.56, REGN +3.87, ISRG +2.74, GILD +.83, MYL +.83, TEVA +.35, VRTX +2.71, BHC +2.12, INCY +3.09, ICPT -2.46, LABU +.74 and IBB $141.38 +.39 (.28%).\nCANNABIS: was HIGHER with the comment in last night\u2019s debate that Kamala Harris that they would legalize pot.

After breaking out over $10,000 we have had a \u201crunning correction\u201d pushing prices toward $12,000, reaching a recovery high of $12220 Thursday, and after a day of rest in between, we resumed the rally touching $12,635, but have sold off back to support. We had 750 shares of GBTC and sold off 250 last week at $13.93 and still have 500 with a cost of $8.45. GBTC closed $11.86 +.89 today.\n \n Tomorrow is another day.\n \nCAM",

Energy, financials, materials some of the leaders. Tech, industrials, consumer discretionary trailing. Treasuries mostly firmer with curve flattening after another steepening move yesterday. Dollar a bit better vs euro but not doing much on the yen cross. Gold up 0.1%. WTI crude up 2.0%.\n* Trump said this morning **\"a bigger deal\" on stimulus (including $1,200 checks) might be possible**, but **Pelosi was dismissive** in a morning press conference. Has also been talk about a **standalone airline bill**, though some resistance from individual GOP senators and Pelosi said \"there is no standalone bill without a bigger bill.\" Not a lot of drama in **last night's vice presidential debate**, and nothing to shift the **growing market expectations for a Biden win and possible Democratic capture of the Senate**. Still a lot of concern about rising Covid new-case levels in Europe (and increasingly in the US). However, **vaccine/treatment optimism theme** helped by Trump talking up his **positive experience with REGN's antibody cocktail**.\n* Analyst takeaways from yesterday's FOMC minutes note the degree to which **policymakers have baked more stimulus into their economic forecasts** and notes that **the Fed might turn to more explicit guidance on QE at future meetings**. Latest week of **initial jobless claims a bit higher than consensus**, though **continuing claims lower**. Elsewhere, BoE Governor Bailey said second wave coronavirus impact will be less severe. BOJ Governor Kuroda noted Japan's economy beginning to improve and repeated won't hesitate to ease as needed.

        "selftext": "Hi all, \n\nI have been looking to diversify out of tech. ETFs make up 50% of my portfolio with SPY making up about 40% of it. I also have 10% in QQQ. Of my individual stocks, tech makes up about 60%. I currently have non-tech holdings in Disney, KO, ICLN, BABA, a small portion in NIO and SNE. I know SNE is tech but it does not move with the sector much and I really like this position. Any thoughts on good buys. I was really interested in BA but wanted to wait to see what happened after sept 15th and that wasn't great. Great buy but will take years so I am watching for now. Some others I have been following are V/MA, FDX (although getting pricey), J&amp;J and CVS. Another reasonable option I have been considering is putting more money into SPY and also ICLN to a lesser extent. Appreciate any input or other ideas. Thanks!",

        "selftext": "There's a huge amount of people in Crypto who think that Buy&amp;Hold is the best strategy. That might be true (especially when effort vs results are considered) for more mature markets, but I felt that in Crypto, simple Trend Following should be able to catch the bulk of the big moves and avoid most of the bear markets, so I ran some tests.\n\n# Strategies\n\nI picked some of the most basic Trend Following strategies with reasonable/round parameters:\n\n* **MA Crossover** (*rx\\_xma*)\u2014 when fast MA crosses over slow MA, go long. I will also use several different MAs for this \u2014 EMA, LRC (LinReg), HMA, WMA, KAMA, SuperSmoother, WVMA, TEMA, ZLEMA. `Parameters used: fast MA = 5d, slow MA = 40d`\n* **Supertrend** (*SupertrendXm*) \u2014 uses ATR to get band width, goes long if price over the band. `Parameters used: ATR period = 5d, band multiplier = 1.5/2/2.5`\n* **Bollinger Bands Breakout** (*rx\\_bb\\_bout*) \u2014 goes long when price over upper band. `Parameters used: BB period = 3d/5d, BB stddev = 2, MA = EMA/LRC/SuperSmoother`\n* **High/Low Breakout** (*hilo*) \u2014 goes long when price over previous X days high. Close position when under X days low. `Parameters used: period = 5d/10d`\n* **Linear Regression Slope** (*expreg\\_slope*) \u2014 goes long when slope of regression &gt; 0. `Parameters used: reg period = 5d/10d/15d`\n* **Single MA/Price Crossover** (*rx\\_xma\\_single*) \u2014 goes long when price crosses over MA. Same MAs as *rx\\_xma* will be used (EMA, LRC, etc). `Parameters used: reg period = 30d`\n* **Single MA Slope** (*rx\\_xma\\_slope*) \u2014 goes long when slope of MA &gt; 0. Same MAs as *rx\\_xma* will be used. `Parameters used: MA period = 20d, slope period = 1d`\n\n# Testing setup\n\n* Long only.\n* 0.10% commission.\n* Simple condition for entry (long), reverse for exit (close).\n* No stoplosses or take profits.\n* Use 100% of balance on each trade (will add position sizing in next post).\n* 60m candle size, except for *Supertrend* (1d to get daily ATR).\n\n# Coins and date ranges used\n\nI will use 25 of the \\~TOP50 coins and 3 different date ranges. Specific coins for each date range depend on data availability. Some will use partial range data (starting later), specified in parentheses.\n\n**Jan 2017 \u2014 July 2020**  \nCoins used: XBT, ETH, XRP (since May 18, 2017), LTC, BCH (since Aug 1, 2017), XMR, DASH (Apr 12, 2017), ETC, ZEC, GNO (since May 1, 2017), IOT (since Jun 12, 2017), REP\n\n**Jan 2018 \u2014 July 2020**  \nCoins used: all of the above + BNB, EOS, XLM, ADA, TRX, NEO, OMG\n\n**Jan 2019 \u2014 July 2020**  \nCoins used: all of the above + BSV, XTZ, LINK, ONT, QTUM, QSH\n\n# Results\n\nHere are the results, AVG profits over all tested assets.\n\n* [Jan2019 - Jul2020](https://i.postimg.cc/QCkJBGSK/1-med10-profit-Jan2019-Jul2020-2020-08-24-13-24.png)\n* [Jan2018 - Jul2020](https://i.postimg.cc/xT6LBPZQ/4-med10-profit-Jan2018-Jul2020-2020-08-24-13-31.png)\n* [Jan2017 - Jul2020](https://i.postimg.cc/3x6mxx7b/6-med10-profit-Jan2017-Jul2020-2020-08-24-13-36.png)\n\n# Conclusion\n\n* Charts seem pretty conclusive to me: Trend Following &gt; Buy&amp;Hold.\n* **You won't beat Buy&amp;Hold like this on each and every asset that you test or trade live. But, over multiple assets, chances are you will on average.**\n* Trade frequency is a bit low (0.5 - 2 per week).\n* Max drawdowns are still pretty big (60 - 80%). Need some filters, stoplosses and position/risk management.\n* **While it's highly unlikely to beat pure isolated BULL market (like 2017) with basic Trend Following, over longer periods with multiple big swings, strategies catch bulk of the moves and come out ahead.**",

PayPal is currently sitting around $15 below its ATH. There is probably no need to explain what PayPal is or what it does.\n\nTotal Payment Volume (TPV)\n\n\"Total  Payment Volume or \"TPV\" is the value of payments, net of payment  reversals, successfully completed through our Payments Platform,  excluding transactions processed through our gateway products.\"\n\n\\--&gt; *Fees on money transactions*\n\nThat means that PayPal makes more money when more transactions are being made.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n1iw3tt13dr51.png?width=554&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0c5711eda5ad1f0422692e74985c16820a43f0fe\n\n**Free Cashflow (FCF)**\n\n$2.19B in Q2 with an increase 112% y/y\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2tr61wt23dr51.png?width=550&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1f3f312a637670c54ebbd70fb223f49b60e5d4fc\n\n\\--&gt;  Now you are probably asking yourself what all those fucking images and  words mean. It\u00b4s simple. PayPal has seen a lot of new users due to the  pandemic and everyone ordering their shit from Jeff Bezos. We are still  in a pandemic and the second wave is about to come. This means that more  and more people are going to use services like PayPal and as I stated  above; more users means more transactions which means more money for PayPal. So more tendies for us.

TPV will rise due to more and more people using PayPal due to the Pandemic. This will lead the FCF to rise as well and this makes stonks go up for us to make some tendies.\n\n**New Customers**\n\nPayPal has seen a rise in new accounts of 21.3 million in Q2.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6xkjfind3dr51.png?width=414&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c1c34c732b58eb2c3daa5581dffaa5d0a5ba565b\n\n**So how are we making tendies on the upcoming earnings?**\n\nPayPal is expecting \"strong momentum from Q2 to continue into Q3\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1slqhmre3dr51.png?width=478&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c9fa90bc61c64cebfb38f1b4d565bd4ab7172632\n\n*They will be crushing earnings* [*again*](https://i.imgur.com/iBhZqrE.png) *like they did in Q2 (actual Growth: 22% and 25%)*\n\nAnalysts have set a *price target around $220.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img n0vw56pf3dr51...*\n\n**Recent News**\n\n\"PayPal and Mastercard will continue the global expansion of its PayPal Business Debit Mastercard.\" [Source](https://www.mobilepaymentstoday.com/news/paypal-business-debit-mastercard-expands-european-market-reach/)\n\nThey also announced to support black communities and businesses.

Going to check the overall direction at market open and decide whether or not it\u2019s good to get in this one a few days late.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Trend reversal](https://preview.redd.it/h5klrqqwq9r51.png?width=1604&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4556b678b9d692cc89d9acd788ee83d7003ce395)\n\n ***$TBLT:***\n\nAug. 25, 2020  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --  ToughBuilt Industries, Inc.  (\u201cToughBuilt\u201d) (NASDAQ: TBLT; TBLTW), an advanced product design, manufacture and international distributor with emphasis on innovative products currently focused on tools and other accessories for the professional and do-it-yourself construction industries, today announced their products have been accepted for immediate placement on www.rona.ca. \n\nRona.ca will carry 64 SKU\u2019s of ToughBuilt products, including but not limited to Cliptech tool belts, bags and totes, knee pads, sawhorses, and Miter Saw Stands. Rona Canadian customers will now have the option to purchase ToughBuilt products while they shop online at [www.rona.ca](http://www.rona.ca/).\n\nMichael Panosian , Chief Executive Officer of ToughBuilt, commented, \u201cWe are pleased to announce this new cooperation with Rona and look forward to adding more new items in fourth quarter. Rona\u2019s great distribution throughout  Canada  allows us to expand our brand awareness and increase our market share in this growing market. We also believe and look forward to a significant growth in both professional and DIY business in  Canada  within the second quarter and beyond.\u201d www.rona.ca is the online arm of  Rona, Inc. \n\nCreated in 1939, RONA is a banner of Lowe\u2019s  Canada , one of Canada\u2019s leading home improvement companies with head office located in  Boucherville, Quebec . Spanning the entire country, RONA\u2019s vast network of more than 375 stores includes both corporate stores and independent affiliated dealers. Known for its large in-store and online product selection as well as for its installation services, RONA also provides expert support and advice to its retail and pro customers for their building and renovation projects.\n\nQuarantine + home improvement go hand in hand, this much is obvious. On the 180d chart, the 50 day moving average just crossed the 200 day ma, and the last two trading days brought higher lows and higher highs. PR expected beginning of October. Be cautious with this one, as i am seeing this ticker blasted all over social media and reddit.

The deal closed this week. Shares plummeted 24.5% to close at  $18.69  on Wednesday, the stock's first day of trading under its new symbol, VLDR. Investors might have overreacted. Baird analyst Tristan Gerra launched coverage of the company Thursday, rating shares the equivalent of Buy. His target for the stock price is $28, about 50% higher than recent trading levels.\n\nLidar is, essentially, laser-based radar and part of the suite of sensors auto makers use to achieve advanced safety features, as well as create self- driving cars. Gerra expects sales to grow 55% a year on average for the next four years, hitting  $684 million  by 2024. Velodyne Lidar is well positioned to maintain its position as the volume and cost leader --  $100  announced \\[selling prices\\] -- as the company continues to optimize performance and costs along with its proprietary manufacturing,\" wrote Gerra in a Wednesday evening report beginning coverage of the stock. Lidar is expensive. And driving down sensor costs is key to adoption. \" Lidars will become an integral part of autonomous vehicles' sensor systems, owing to camera limitations,\" he said. Cameras can't function in all conditions.\n\nVelodyne says it has more than 300 customers, including auto makers. Gerra writes the company has engaged with Tesla (TSLA). Gerra is the only analyst covering Velodyne at the moment. The average stock in the Dow Jones Industrial Average has about 30 analysts.\n\nDespite the relative lack of coverage, Velodyne isn't small. Its market capitalization, based on the pro-forma total of shares outstanding post merger, is about  $3.3 billion . At the stock's recent high, the market value was more than $5.5 billion.\n\nHidden opportunity here. This stock took one hell of a slide downward during the month of September after the deal with GRAF closed, with a high of $32.75/share and now just trading at $17. Things I like about this company:\n\n* Product that solves an issue and is necessary (autonomous safety)\n* Engaged with big name customers (including Tesla)\n* Under most people\u2019s radar\n* 50% fall in one month is a clear overreaction \n* Merger implies later catalysts\n\nLong $VLDR\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Rough September](https://preview.redd.it/t75p7rh4r9r51.png?width=1608&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0b79facf1a9249fe39d834ae22e5b8f91744888e)\n\n**Never forget to do your own DD; remember: For all you know, all the stocks that I mention here will dip 90% tomorrow; Do your own DD, I'm not some magic fairy. Trading will never come this easy to you. If all the stocks on here went up, I'd be chilling on my own Island.**",

It started to curl up and broke above the neckline(resistance of a specified trend pattern) and came back to it to test as support at 1.20. second point of confluence.

        "selftext": " **FAANGs, retail led market gainers while energy continued recent declines:**\n\n* **Consumer discretionary** was the best sector with department stores, apparel and AMZN-US among gainers. BBB-US rose sharply following earnings beat. **Communication services** were supported by FAANGS strength. **Tech** finished ahead with semis and software among the best segments. **Consumer staples** were in line as big box, grocers and cosmetics gained though drug stores were lower and foods mixed. **Financials** lagged with custody banks and P/C insurers lower. **Industrials** were behind with machinery and multis lower though airlines stronger. **Healthcare** was lower on hospital and large cap pharma declines and mixed performance in med tech. **Materials** were off with non-ferrous metals (copper prices down sharply), global miners and chemicals showing some weakness. **Energy** was broadly lower with all sectors down sharply.\n\n**White House boosts fiscal stimulus offer to $1.6T:**\n\n* [Roll Call](https://www.rollcall.com/2020/09/30/exclusive-mnuchin-coronavirus-relief-plan-includes-more-state-local-funds/) reported that in recent negotiations with House Speaker Pelosi about a fifth coronavirus relief bill, Treasury Secretary Mnuchin raised the White House's offer to just over $1.6T. This is up from an original proposal of $1T though Mnuchin has previously expressed a willingness to go up to $1.5T. The new offer includes $250B in funding for state and local governments, up from $100B, but below the nearly $400B+ sought by Democrats in their latest proposal. It also features $400 a week of additional unemployment benefits, up from their prior $300 a week offer but still below the $600 sought by Democrats. Talks expected to continue today and despite the favorable market reaction, still skepticism there will be enough additional movement to get something done. [Politico](https://www.politico.com/playbook) discussed how Senate Republicans present another big obstacle, even if Trump prods them to do a deal.\n\n**ISM manufacturing index lost a little strength in September:**\n\n* **ISM Manufacturing Index** for September of 55.4 missed 56.3 estimate, down from prior month 56. New orders index down 7.4 at 60.2, production index down 2.3 at 61, employment index up 3.2 at 49.6, new export orders index up 1 at 54.3. The report indicated expansion in the economy for the fifth month since contraction in April with manufacturers becoming better at maintaining output in reconfigured factories. Elsewhere, September **IHS Markit final manufacturing PMI** of 53.2 slightly lower than flash 53.5 and above 53.1 in August. New orders upticked while output (fastest in ten months) and employment (second fastest since Nov-19) growth increased sharply. August **construction spending** of 1.4% m/m beat consensus and prior reading of 0.7%.\n\n**Initial jobless claims and August personal consumption better:**\n\n* Weekly **initial jobless claims** at 837K in the week ending 26-Sep, versus consensus of 850K and below prior week reading of 873K (revised up 3k). Largest increases in NY, GA, MA, NJ; largest decreases in MA, MI. Four-week average was 867K, down 12K from last week. **Continuing claims** for the week ending 19-Sep were lower at 11.767M vs consensus 12.275M and prior week's 12.747M (revised up by 167K). Elsewhere, August monthly **personal consumption expenditures** of +1.0% m/m, above consensus 0.7% following July's 1.5% gain (revised down 0.4%); **personal income** fell 2.7% m/m versus expected -2.5% and July's +0.5% (revised up 0.1%) as federal unemployment benefits rolled off. **Core** **pce deflator** of 0.3% m/m (0.33% unrounded) met consensus though July revised up a tick to 0.4%. On a y/y basis, the inflation measure was 1.6%, two tenths above expected and prior reading.\n\n**Corporate layoffs raise more concerns about protracted crisis:**\n\n* [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-09-30/disney-shell-cuts-mark-warning-sign-for-global-economic-rebound?sref=L75TRUmI) discussed how the tens of thousands of job cuts announced by blue-chip companies in a 24-hour span is a warning sign for the global economic recovery. Recent layoff announcements have come from Disney (DIS-US ), Goldman Sachs (GS-US ), Allstate (ALL-US ), Marathon Petroleum (MPC-US ), Royal Dutch Shell (RDS-GB ), Elanco (ELAN-US ), and the airlines. The article highlighted concerns that job losses have begun to spill over the from the service sector that initially suffered the brunt of the layoffs from the coronavirus pandemic with more companies now looking to protect margins. Cost-cutting has been a key component of the earnings resilience theme. Back in late August, a [WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/new-covid-19-layoffs-make-job-reductions-permanent-11598654257) article flagged concerns that a wave of corporate layoffs could be permanent as companies increasingly see the coronavirus pandemic as the driver of a more protracted economic downturn\n\n**Auto sector remains a recovery bright spot:**\n\n* [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-autos-sales/u-s-auto-sales-stay-on-recovery-path-despite-tight-inventory-idUSKBN26M4XB) and [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-10-01/fiat-chrysler-toyota-beat-3q-forecasts-auto-sales-update?sref=L75TRUmI) both discussed the recovery in the auto market over the course of Q3. General Motors (GM-US ), Fiat Chrysler (FCAU-US ) and Toyota (TM-US ) all reported better than expected results. GM also mentioned that sales improved sequentially each month within Q3 and that both industry and GM sales rebounded significantly in October, finishing the month with y/y sales increases. The articles highlighted strong consumer demand for SUVs, trucks and hybrids. These groups were longstanding outperformers before the coronavirus pandemic as well. Demand underpinned by a combination of broader economic recovery and low rates. A number of other companies with leverage to autos have also highlighted the sector recovery in their recent updates. These include dealers, semis and electronics.\n\n**Fed extends dividend and buyback restrictions on banks:**\n\n* Fed [announced ](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20200930b.htm)Wednesday after the close that none of the 33 banks with more than $100B of assets would be allowed to resume share repurchases in Q4 and that it would also maintain a cap on dividend payments. Fed said move intended to ensure the banks maintain a high level of capital resilience. Added that the capital positions of the big banks have remained strong during Q3 while such restrictions were in place. Move was widely expected by the Street. A number of banks that presented at the Barclays Global Financial Services Conference last month expressed an interest in resuming buyback activity as soon as possible. Capital return uncertainty has been an overhang on the group. The other big headwind has been lower NII guidance from softer loan demand and an uptick in repayments. However, banks have been more upbeat on asset quality.\n\n**Senate panel votes to subpoena tech executives:**\n\n* [The Hill](https://thehill.com/policy/technology/519101-senate-panel-votes-to-subpoena-big-tech-executives) noted that the Senate Commerce Committee voted Thursday to subpoena the CEOs of Twitter (TWTR-US ), Google (GOOGL-US ) and Facebook (FB-US ). The vote compels the CEOs to testify at a hearing on Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act that will discuss social media's alleged conservative bias. The move was previewed last week. DOJ has already recommended that Congress pare back Section 230 laws, which give sites broad immunity from lawsuits for words, images, and videos. Back in May, President Trump signed an executive order to limit protections for online platforms. [Axios](https://www.axios.com/congress-looks-to-squeeze-big-tech-ahead-of-election-8deb407a-8e2a-4989-9682-dade915583a8.html) recently discussed how it's nearly certain that neither a Section 230 reform bill from the Senate nor the antitrust legislation that could come out of the House will pass anytime soon. Market has also tended to ignore the continued pickup in regulatory scrutiny in favor of secular growth and disruption themes.\n\n**Mixed vaccine headlines:**\n\n* [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-09-30/oxford-astra-covid-vaccine-review-said-to-start-in-europe?srnd=premium-asia&amp;sref=L75TRUmI) reported European regulators set to announce an accelerated review of the coronavirus candidate from AstraZeneca (AZN-US ) and the University of Oxford. This will allow them to see trial data while the study is ongoing and potentially speed up the approval process. However, [Reuters](https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-health-coronavirus-vaccine-astrazenec/exclusive-fda-widens-u-s-safety-inquiry-into-astrazeneca-coronavirus-vaccine-sources-idUKKBN26L3T8) reported the FDA has broadened its investigation of a serious illness in the AstraZeneca trial and will look at data from earlier trials developed by the same scientists. Noted this raises likelihood of further delays for what has been one of the most advanced vaccine candidates. CEO of Moderna (MRNA-US ) told the [FT](https://www.ft.com/content/9b242ecc-3dce-4534-9171-cdf624468a2a) that his company would not be able to apply to the FDA for emergency use authorization of its coronavirus vaccine until at least late November. Added that he did not expect to have full approval for broad distribution until next spring. Timelines more in line with those of public health officials than Trump.",

        "selftext": "Summarized to save you time.\n\n**Still chatter about a broader stimulus bill, but even airline-only deal could be tough:**\n\n* [Politico](https://twitter.com/JakeSherman/status/1314208911654678530) said Treasury Secretary Mnuchin floated possibility of restarting broader stimulus talks in call with Speaker Pelosi last night. Then Trump told [Fox Business](https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/pelosi-stimulus-checks-donald-trump-1200) this morning \"a bigger deal\" involving $1,200 stimulus checks was possible. Comments come after Trump talked about halting negotiations only to suggest yesterday he wanted Congress to pass funding for airlines, PPP and another round of stimulus checks. However, prospects for any deal remain dim, especially as Pelosi castigated Trump today for walking away from necessary relief. Some resistance within the GOP for more spending on stimulus, and Senate Majority Leader McConnell likely reluctant to bring up any measure his caucus is uncertain to back. Note GOP Sens. Toomey and Lee released a [statement](https://www.toomey.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/toomey-and-lee-issue-statement-regarding-an-additional-round-of-taxpayer-funded-grants-for-airlines) saying Congress should not make targeted grants to airlines. Other hurdles include Congress being out of session, focus on upcoming SCOTUS hearings, and short calendar before Election Day.\n\n**Pence and Harris square off in vice presidential debate:**\n\n* VP Pence and Democratic candidate Kamala Harris debated in Salt Lake City on Wednesday ([WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/trumps-covid-19-diagnosis-amps-up-spotlight-on-vice-presidential-debate-11602084013)). Pence defended administration's pandemic handling while touting strong economic stewardship and renegotiated trade deals. Harris zeroed in on Trump's poor management of the coronavirus. Harris demurred when asked whether Biden would push to add more justices to the Supreme Court. Also skirted question on presidential succession if her running mate becomes incapacitated. When pressed Harris said Biden would not ban fracking (though Harris said in 2019 said she would ban the practice). Meanwhile, Pence dodged a question about how Trump would protect pre-existing conditions if Affordable Care Act is struck down by Supreme Court. Debate was more civil than the Trump-Biden confrontation last week. Trump and Biden to debate again on 15-Oct. Organizers said debate now scheduled to be virtual, though Trump said that is not acceptable.\n\n**Continuing jobless claims fell significantly while initial claims in line:**\n\n* Weekly **initial jobless claims** at 840K in the week ending 3-Oct, versus consensus of 837K and prior week's reading 849k (revised up 12k). Largest increases in MA, IL, NJ; largest decreases in TX, FL, GA. Four-week average was 857K, down 13K from last week. **Continuing claims** for the week ending 26-Sep were well lower at 10.976M vs consensus 11.500M and prior week's 11.979M (revised up by 212K). Individuals filing initial claims in the federal **Pandemic Unemployment Assistance** program for week ending 3-Oct fell to 464K from 509K in prior week. Persons claiming benefits in **all programs** for week ending 19-Sep declined to 25.505M from 26.509M in the prior week.\n\n**Trump credits Regeneron's antibody cocktail for his recovery from coronavirus:**\n\n* In a [video](https://www.twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1313959702104023047), President Trump talked up Regeneron's (REGN-US ) experimental monoclonal antibody cocktail, saying it was \"key\" to his recovery from coronavirus ([Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-10-07/trump-hails-antibody-treatment-wants-all-patients-to-have-it?srnd=politics-vp&amp;sref=J9GPLx1B)). Added that he is working on getting the treatment authorized and that it should be made free to Americans. REGN said presence of antibodies in Trump's blood could be result of its treatment, and it will seek EUA ([Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-10-08/regeneron-seeks-fda-emergency-clearance-for-covid-19-treatment?srnd=premium-asia&amp;sref=J9GPLx1B)). Trump mentioned Eli Lilly (LLY-US ), which has also requested EUA of its experimental antibody-based treatment ([WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/eli-lilly-asks-fda-to-authorize-covid-19-antibody-drug-11602074998?mod=hp_lead_pos4)). Trump's physician, Sean Conley, noted detectable levels of coronavirus antibodies were found in Monday's blood sample that weren't detected on Thursday. In his video, Trump also said vaccines should be approved before election. He again faulted for China for the virus and said Beijing would pay a big price.\n\n**Bond market impact of a Blue Wave scenario under increasing scrutiny:**\n\n* [FT](https://www.ft.com/content/6369516f-d4d1-4a31-817c-417585b0c24a) said that investors are increasingly focusing on the risk of a decline in long-term US government bond prices in anticipation of a more robust economic recovery and hefty additional government spending after November's presidential election. Noted long-dated Treasury yields have risen sharply since the start of the month to highest levels since June, while some fund managers warn this may be the start of a sharper selloff in US debt, though magnitude of a move depends on results of elections. Article cited Goldman Sachs strategists said investors could pull forward expectations for US rate rises on stimulus and vaccine developments, while Morgan Stanley strategists described a \"rates scare\" of a sudden move higher in yields that could take market by surprise. However, some strategists said the Fed would show little tolerance for destabilizing increase in rates that upends efforts to support the economy.\n\n**Fed unlikely to change QE strategy, at least for now:**\n\n* [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-fed-evans/fed-has-capacity-to-amp-up-bond-buying-but-no-need-now-evans-says-idUSKBN26S3K4?il=0) reported that Fed officials said the bank could ramp up its bond purchasing program or weight its purchases at the long end of the curve to push down further on borrowing costs. However, officials including Chicago's Evans (voter) said any changes are unlikely to happen in the short-term, with Evans saying it would be the Spring until he has a better sense of whether the Fed will need to give explicit guidance on the future pace or type of asset purchases. Also comes after yesterday's [September FOMC minutes](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomcminutes20200916.htm) showed little discussion over whether to adjust the Fed's current $120B per month pace of bond purchases. Despite cautious approach to QE, a Fed paper this week said that bond purchases equal to 30% of US economic output, or \\~$6.5T, are required to offset the impact of the Fed's benchmark rate already being near zero ([Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-10-07/top-fed-economist-says-much-more-qe-needed-to-offset-zero-bound?sref=J9GPLx1B)).\n\n**Economists warn of impact on economic growth if stimulus negotiations fail:**\n\n* [NY Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/07/business/second-stimulus-bill-fails-impact.html?action=click&amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;pgtype=Homepage) the latest to note the economic impact of the the end of stimulus, with loss of momentum likely to grow unless more aid doesn't arrive soon. Noted near universal agreement from economists who say more aid is needed for individuals, businesses, and local governments, and that the amount is less important than how fast and where the money is deployed. Also discussed aid to state and local governments, which economists say could drive sizable reduction in economic activity if left without additional support, though was a key area of disagreement in latest round of stimulus negotiations. Moody's last month said state and local governments will have budget shortfalls of $500B through summer 2022, assuming pandemic does not get worse. Biggest cuts expected to be in education and healthcare. Also highlighted worries further state spending reductions could prolong the economic downturn ([NY Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/07/business/state-budgets-coronavirus-aid.html)).\n\n**WSJ survey shows 43% of economists not expecting full labor market recovery until 2023:**\n\n* A [WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/wsj-survey-43-of-economists-dont-see-u-s-gaining-back-lost-jobs-until-2023-11602165600) survey showed a slower timeline for a labor market recovery than predicted six months ago, particularly in travel and leisure because of continued high coronavirus infection rates. Cited a potential worsening of the COVID-19 crisis as the flu season approaches with no coronavirus vaccine, a lack of fresh fiscal stimulus, and uncertainty around the election as factors weighing on the labor market recovery. Around 80% of economists said the current election process is introducing more uncertainty into financial markets compared with elections of recent decades, and 73% saying it was creating more uncertainty than usual for the economy. However, the survey showed more optimism around a GDP rebound, with \\~58% of those surveyed expecting economic output to return to its prior peak in Q1-19 by 2021, while \\~19% expect it to recover by Q1-22. On average, the economists expect GDP to contract 3.6% this year, followed by growth of 3.7% in 2021 and 3% in 2022.\n\n**US explores restricting Ant Group and Tencent payment systems:**\n\n* People familiar with the matter told [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-10-07/u-s-explores-restrictions-on-ant-group-tencent-payment-systems?sref=J9GPLx1B) Trump administration is exploring restrictions on Ant Group and Tencent Holdings (700-HK ) over concerns their digital payment platforms threaten US national security and give Beijing access to banking and personal data of hundreds of millions of people. Restrictions could involve putting both companies on Treasury Department's national list, which effectively bars firms from doing business with them. Such a move would risk angering China beyond its unhappiness over TikTok. Administration officials discussed idea of restrictions in a 30-Sep meeting, though a final decision isn't imminent with officials acknowledging difficulty in moving forward until a mechanism is established. Also, no indication idea has been presented to Trump.\n\n**BoE Governor Bailey expects a Brexit deal, willing to take more action:**\n\n* [Reuters](https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-boe-bailey/bank-of-englands-bailey-says-risks-are-very-much-to-the-downside-idUKKBN26T16D) cited comments by BoE Governor Bailey in the Yorkshire Post, who said he believed the UK and the EU can reach a deal, and in the best interests of both sides. He reiterated that while he would like to see Britain and the EU retain equivalent standards on financial services, it would be wrong to follow EU rules if it had no control over. Meanwhile, on the economic impact from the rising number of coronavirus cases, said it was likely to hurt economy, but less than initial surge earlier this year. In separate comments from SRB panel discussion, highlighted BoE was not out of firepower and would use if it needs in second and third wave of virus. Emphasized it must use policy actively and aggressively. Would use policy tools to the fullest extent possible to support economy ([Reuters](https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-boe-bailey-firepower/bank-of-england-not-out-of-firepower-bailey-says-idUKKBN26T1D1?il=0))\n\n**ECB minutes emphasize FX impact, warns on complacency:**\n\n* The [ECB](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/accounts/2020/html/ecb.mg201008~49aeff32e1.en.html) September minutes discussively extensively the impact of a strong euro on the inflation outlook. It highlighted that appreciation of the euro had a material impact on inflation and market positioning was tilted to further gains. It noted that inflation expectations remained close to historic lows, amplifying risks to anchoring and there was broad agreement that there was no room for complacency. Two main FX drivers were identified: a reversal of dollar safe haven flows and the decisive action taken by EU governments on fiscal policy. It was thought that in the prevailing environment of uncertainty, the best course of action was to keep a steady hand on policy. Some made the point that with tensions in the market subsiding the pace of monthly asset purchases could be reduced. On the policy options available, it pointed to a further cut in the policy rate and changes to the TLTROs.",

AAPL -2.65% unveiled a new iPhone Tuesday capable of connecting to a much faster 5G cellular network, which investors are betting will spur strong demand.\n\nChief Executive Tim Cook stood at the company\u2019s Cupertino, Calif., headquarters to begin the webcast, streamed on Apple\u2019s website\u2014a visual reminder of how the tech giant\u2019s latest flagship-product introduction differs from previous ones because of the coronavirus pandemic, which closed businesses and left people sheltering at home around the world for much of this year.\n\nThe iPhone 12 offered a new physical appearance from last year\u2019s smartphone, moving from a rounded design to a flatter-edged look reminiscent of the iPhone 4. Apple revealed four versions of the phones ranging in sizes and starting in price from $699 for the iPhone 12 Mini with a 5.4-inch display. The iPhone 12 Pro Max has a 6.7-inch display, an increase from 6.5 inches; the higher-end versions emphasize the camera abilities.\n\n\nThe newest iPhone designs move away from the rounded shape of recent models toward a flatter-edged look akin to the iPhone 4. The iPhone 12 Pro and Pro Max, unveiled Tuesday.\nPHOTO: APPLE\nThe greatest hype going into the event, however, has been about the device\u2019s 5G capability. Apple\u2019s adoption of the next-generation wireless standard places intense focus on the new technology that has been years in the making. Cellular network carriers have been scrambling to roll out 5G service across the U.S., but coverage remains spotty in the country and it isn\u2019t clear yet whether customers will want it.\n\nWSJ NEWSLETTER\nNotes on the News\nThe news of the week in context, with Tyler Blint-Welsh.\n\nEnter your email\nSIGN UP\n\u201cToday is the beginning of a new era for iPhone,\u201d Mr. Cook said.\n\nShares slipped as the event took place, which has occurred with previous Apple events, before rebounding. With few people familiar with the new cellular service, Mr. Cook made an effort to describe why 5G technology would improve their experience. He cited improved downloads and uploads, higher-quality video streaming, better gaming and less network congestion. Apple also highlighted the integration with the company\u2019s new A14 Bionic microchip.\n\nThe presentation included demonstrations of how 5G iPhones could be helpful in downloading important medical images and for remotely designing factory spaces\u2014tacit acknowledgments that some of the most likely customers for the technology might be business users who can benefit from faster connections.\n\nHow Apple Became the World\u2019s Most Valuable Publicly Traded Company\nYOU MAY ALSO LIKE\n\nUP NEXT\n\nHow Apple Became the World\u2019s Most Valuable Publicly Traded Company\nHow Apple Became the World\u2019s Most Valuable Publicly Traded Company\nApple reached a staggering $2 trillion market valuation in August, despite years of doubt from critics over whether the tech giant could continue to succeed after the death of Steve Jobs. Here\u2019s a look at Apple\u2019s rise to the very top. Illustration: Jacob Reynolds/WSJ\n\u201cApple almost provides like the Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval,\u201d Mark Vena, a senior analyst for Moor Insights &amp; Strategy said. \u201cThey tend to validate the technology, which is unfair because you could go out today and buy a Samsung phone\u201d with 5G.\n\nThe emphasis on the guts of the iPhone marked a change from recent years where many new features involved cameras and other iterative updates. The lack of dramatic change has come as the smartphone market has matured more than a decade after Apple first introduced the iPhone.\n\nThe latest smartphone arrives five years after iPhone unit sales peaked. Mr. Cook has pushed the company to sell pricier versions of the device and to rely on software services and wearables, such as smartwatches and headphones, to boost revenue.\n\nIn a nod to those efforts, the company began its Tuesday event by introducing an updated HomePod that is smaller than its previous version of the speaker and is priced at $99.\n\n\nApple unveiled a new, smaller HomePod than its previous version of the speaker.\nPHOTO: APPLE\nApple began selling the HomePod in early 2018 after unspecified delays pushed back the rollout following its 2017 debut. The voice-activated device was Apple\u2019s attempt to catch up with the success of Amazon.com Inc. and its smart speakers in late 2014, though when the HomePod debuted at $349 it was considerably more expensive than its rivals.\n\nTo make the case for a pricier offering, Apple has previously emphasized its sound quality, especially when it comes to music. The device\u2019s price has fallen since it first went on the market.\n\nThe iPhone 12 has been hotly anticipated by investors who have driven up the company\u2019s shares 69% in 2020, partly because of excitement over the new phone. Those expectations and Apple\u2019s success in driving up services revenue helped it become the first U.S. public company to eclipse $2 trillion in market value earlier this year.\n\nAnalysts surveyed by FactSet, on average, predict iPhone revenue will rise 15% to $160 billion in the fiscal year that began Oct. 1. That is about $6 billion shy of the record set in fiscal 2018, when the $1,000 iPhone X helped bolster sales even as shipments failed to reach a new high.\n\nKaty Huberty, a veteran Apple analyst for Morgan Stanley, last week predicted the company could ship as many as 240 million iPhones this year, helped by customers who haven\u2019t upgraded in several years and excitement for 5G. That would set a record, beating the 231 million devices sold in fiscal 2015. Sales at that level could send the company\u2019s shares up 37% from Monday\u2019s close to a market value of almost $2.9 trillion, she said.\n\n\u201cWe expect this fall\u2019s launch to be the most significant iPhone event in years,\u201d she wrote in a note to investors.\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS\nWhat new products or updates are you hoping to see from Apple? Join the conversation below.\n\nIn recent years, Mr. Cook has been stretching the iPhone lineup to appeal to an array of pocketbooks. That was on display again Tuesday: A step up from the iPhone 12 Mini sits the iPhone 12, starting at $799 with a 6.1-inch display. On the higher end, the iPhone 12 Pro starts at $999, with the Pro Max offering the largest display and beginning at $1,099.\n\nThe iPhone 12 and 12 Pro are available for pre-order on Friday, and the iPhone 12 Mini and iPhone 12 Pro Max will be available Nov. 6, Apple said.\n\nSome analysts are skeptical that customers will flock to a 5G phone without a must-have application or service to help them see the appeal of the new technology. U.S. cellular networks are still being upgraded, and service might be disappointing in some spots for early adopters.\n\nIt is also uncertain how the coronavirus will affect sales of the new devices. The pandemic delayed production of the flagship phone earlier this year, which led Tuesday\u2019s unveiling to be rescheduled from its traditional September date.\n\nMr. Cook appeared publicly for the first time since a Democratic-led House subcommittee last week issued a report claiming Apple uses its control over software on its devices in an anticompetitive manner. Apple has rejected the report\u2019s conclusions and said it doesn\u2019t have a dominant market share in any area.",
