        "selftext": "W\ufffcith Apple\u2018s iPhone typical fall launch is fast approaching, details about the device\u2019s new capabilities have started to leak out.\n\nAs consumers and gadget fans pore over the tidbits for taste of what Apple\u2019s (ticker: AAPL) latest pocket computetr will have in store, chip investors too are scrutinizing the trickle of information. In a Tuesday report, Bloomberg News said the new Apple phones will feature new video and camera features, a faster Apple-designed chip to power the gadget, and new screen technology. Apple will keep the same iPhone dimensions and designs as last year\u2019s models, the report said.\n\nBased on the scarce available details, the exact makeup of the guts of the next line of iPhones is highly speculative at this point. But, investors know a few things already based on past designs and the bare-bones description. \n\nOne of the biggest changes in recent memory was the iPhone\u2019s adoption of 5G technology, requiring a batch of new chips to support the fast uplink speed. For many phones, including Apple\u2019s, that tended to mean much more silicon overall, which was good news for the chip makers that supply Apple with parts.\n\nFor the 5G modems themselves, the iPhone 12 contained chips made by Qualcomm (QCOM), which suggests it too will likely supply the iPhone\u2019s 5G wireless chip\u2014at least for now. Apple has reportedly launched its own effort to design wireless radios, so that may change in the future. The chip giant has made other chips for the iPhones such as power modules. \n\nSkyworks Solutions (SWKS) and Qorvo (QRVO) make radio-related iPhone components, too, and have both been historic suppliers. Broadcom (AVGO) also has made wireless chips and other iPhone components. Barclays chip analyst Blayne Curtis has staked Qorvo has his favorite of the batch of Apple suppliers he watches.\n\nFor the new camera, it\u2019s possible Texas Instruments (TXN) could play a role, as it has supplied the power-management chip for previous iterations of the iPhone camera. Its chips that help with battery-charging have also been spotted in past phones.\n\nMemory-wise, according to an iFixit teardown, the last iPhone used random access memory made by Micron Technology (MU). Micron has said the 5G upgrade cycle has benefited it because new generation phones typically carry more RAM than their 4G counterparts. The iPhone 12\u2019s flash storage was produced by closely held Kioxia Holdings, a Japanese memory maker that has been considering an initial public offering in recent months.\n\nWe know Apple is designing the chips that power its phones, and has for several generations, effectively cutting out Qualcomm from the processor part of iPhone revenue. Taiwan \nSemiconductor Manufacturing (TSM), has made the chip in the past, and it is all but certain to be making the latest iPhone processors.\n\nSource: Barron's\n\nSome of the semi stocks mentioned in this article are still worth to buy. qcom, tsm, mu, skws and qrvo are all trading between 20 to 30 pe. The revenue growth for these stocks are still attractive. With apple releasing the new iphones at September, these stocks will definitely benefit from the ongoing 5G trend.",
