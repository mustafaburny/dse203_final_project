        "selftext": "Hello, so I follow the [Kelly Criterion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly_criterion), meaning that I yolo most of my money on plays that I have high conviction on. Since 90%+ of my portfolio is tied up in a play, I didn\u2019t plan on posting anything until after. However, some [SKIN calls recently paid off](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/p3oz2a/skin_side_bet_gains_4k_34k_all_shit_calls/) and now I have money now for a side bet. So I\u2019m going to introduce a stock that caught my eye. But, before I begin I want you all to watch this education video on how Hedge\u2019s take your money:\n\n[The Barclays Trading Strategy that Outperforms the Market](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pYgz4YlQnE)\n\nSince I didn\u2019t release anything on NEGG until the [last second](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ofojpw/whats_going_on_with_negg_a_ticker_with_35m_float/), and didn\u2019t have the time to write up a DD on SKIN before [the moon](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/p3oz2a/skin_side_bet_gains_4k_34k_all_shit_calls/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf), I wanted to change it up and inject some new blood into the pool. I have a theory that a lot of stocks on this sub are built on the backs of bagholders, so anytime I post a DD I want to make sure the setup is especially juicy and the calls cheap. Loss porn is cool and all, but it's depressing - I\u2019m looking at you [UPST bro](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/p3mhc0/upst_crash_update_how_to_lose_150k_in_3_days/), [I warned your ass to chill](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/p1wt77/betting_80k_on_upst_crash_after_earnings/h8hug6f?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3). \n\nThis isn\u2019t CLOV, AMC, WKHS, CLNE \u2014 **this is PAYA** a stock with juicy profit margins, crazy revenue growth, and an asymmetric gain opportunity in the short term because calls are cheap, with whales already jumping in slapping big dick energy down on OTM calls. \n\nEerily, this stock has not been mentioned on reddit or any of the regular places I check for mentions, even though they 1) [murked earnings and raised guidance](https://www.benzinga.com/news/earnings/21/08/22370953/paya-holdings-clocks-25-revenue-growth-in-q2-lifts-fy21-gross-margin-outlook), 2) [analysts keep upgrading their PTs](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/PAYA/price-target/), 3) [announced on Friday a cashless redemption catalyst on Sep 10](https://investors.paya.com/news-releases/news-release-details/paya-holdings-inc-announces-commencement-exchange-offer-and), and 4) institutions are loaded to the tits with shares **(118%+)**\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\n**This institutional share anomaly** will be deep dived later - but surprise surprise, since the institutions who **own all the shares are investment management firms who generally** buy and hold, the float is illiquid. Since, without an actively traded float there is essentially no float. Lastly as always there is a short angle for extra salt.\n\nWhen you read this DD remember the video I posted; people are watching  [\ud83d\udc40](https://emojipedia.org/eyes/), so take profits this time and cut your losses if you FOMO in at the last second. I wouldn\u2019t be posting or throwing money down on calls unless I had a good amount of conviction that this pays out.\n\n**Here\u2019s the tldr summary for what\u2019s up**\n\n* **Solid financials.** Ex: 52% gross profit margins (Square is 28%) \n* **Near-100% institutional holdings** (equals highly restricted float)\n* **Major warrant dilution cancellation** catalyst (Sep 10)\n* **Multiple** **major valuations** at a 60% upside. \n* **IV is dirt poor** at 40% . \n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\n# Part 1 About + Financials \n\nPAYA is a payment processor that has done close to $35bn in payments in 2020, projected $40bn in 2021 and is growing at a fast pace. They work through vendors, resellers, independent sales organizations, developers, etc, etc, etc., and have a bunch of different offerings depending on the sector of business, while their projected upward revenue is intense.\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\nPaya has the lowest price per sales of all its competitors at 5.0 (SHOP is at 48.67 and INTU at 16.51). Gross profit margins are insane at 50.9%, compared to 23.2% for Square (SQ), and 48.4% of Paypal (PYPL). In fact, PAYA has the highest Institutional ownership of all competitors and the highest short interest. \n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\nCaption: competitors analyzed: SQ, PYPL, INTU, SHOP, FISV, PSFE\n\nThere\u2019s a lot to deep dive into, but it\u2019s solid company. So solid that institutions are picking up as many shares of PAYA as possible. [Their recent Q2 ER presentation](https://investors.paya.com/static-files/3769846b-2d2c-4e7a-946f-5b25b6911e93) showed off their stellar earnings growth. It\u2019s hard to name other companies with permanent relevancy that have **over a 50% gross profit margin**. \n\nCouple highlights\n\n* $135mil of cash on hand\n* $244mil revenue expected in 2021\n* 25% revenue growth year-over-year realized and projected\n* 42% gross profit margin growth year-over-year realized and projected\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\nSince the economy has reopened, PAYA\u2019s profit margins have only been growing. Unlike most tech companies, they are not a one-and-done situation but will have permanent relevancy in the post-Covid world. In fact, they are a top-20 payment provider in the US. \n\n[BTIG](https://www.investing.com/news/btig-stick-to-their-buy-rating-for-paya-holdings-2439931), [Truist](https://www.benzinga.com/news/21/06/21740210/truist-securities-initiates-coverage-on-paya-holdings-with-buy-rating-announces-price-target-of-15), [Cannacord](https://m.investing.com/news/canaccord-genuity-stick-to-their-buy-rating-for-paya-holdings-2344676), and [Credit Suisse](https://www.benzinga.com/news/21/05/20983489/credit-suisse-initiates-coverage-on-paya-holdings-with-outperform-rating-announces-price-target-of-1) have all given PAYA bullish targets with an average 56% upside. Meanwhile, institutions have just been pouring into this stock and buying more while increasing price targets. \n\n# Part 2 Institutional Holdings: +128% \n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\nOkay, so this is getting good. So institutions obviously can\u2019t hold more than 100% of shares - this is probably a small error in delayed reporting and maybe some brokers miscounting a handful of tranche locked up shares. \n\n**However** **it is very likely that institutions hold near-100% of all shares**. The entire volume over the last 6 weeks since Q2 reporting was only 28 million shares. The largest holder, GTCR didn\u2019t sell a share, Blackrock bought 150% more, and every single other major institution holder that reported for Q2 so far **increased** their positions.\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\nWhat does this mean? It means that institutions and funds think this is a valuable AF company and they are holding nearly all outstanding shares. They are jacked. **And remember: if nearly all outstanding shares are being held by institutions**, **that means the effective float is tiny**. This is very important in relation to short interest**.** \n\nFiguring out just how small the float is relevant to figuring out what kind of corner shorts have put themselves in. Luckily we have some good pieces of info to guide us-\n\n* [PAYA tells us](https://investors.paya.com/static-files/3769846b-2d2c-4e7a-946f-5b25b6911e93#page=10) there are 121mil shares outstanding in their recent ER. \n* [13Fs/Ds tell us](https://fintel.io/so/us/paya) that most institutions are holding and only small funds are trading in and out. \n* [FINRA tells us](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/paya/short-interest) that ***there are 7.2mil outstanding S***I. \n* [Price tells us](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/NASDAQ-PAYA/) that only 28mil shares were traded in the last 6 weeks since June 30 Q2 reports have been filed with only a net 2.1mil share sell.\n\n**If nearly all shares are held by institutions,** then obviously the float is highly restricted. Since we know the exact number of shorts via FINRA, we can figure out real short interest in relation to the float at different institutional holding levels.\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\nAfter all my time in highly illiquid stocks like NEGG and others that can\u2019t be named, it\u2019s obvious PAYA\u2019s float is super tight, and it seems pretty plausible institutional holdings are likely around the 90% range, if not higher. **This would correlate to a 60%-118% short percentage of the effective float.**\n\nAdditionally, from the FTD viewpoint you see a spike in [FTDs with the price bleeding up](https://sec.report/fails.php?tc=paya). To me this indicates tight short constraints, and combining with what we already know leads me to the belief that there may be a supply issue. SI doesn\u2019t have to be balls to the wall for it to matter, sometimes supply-side issues are there but not reflected in the raw SI data. \n\nI guarantee these shorts don\u2019t realize that their positions are ticking time bombs due to the illiquid nature of the stock. They probably don\u2019t even have a fundamentally negative view of the company and are just actively trading in and out of the stock. Spoiler: it won\u2019t end well \n\n# Part 3 Canceled. Warrant dilution\n\nA lot of negative price sentiment came from market pricing in an 18mil eventual share dilution via warrant exercises. This would have been a -**15% share dilution** of current shareholders.\n\n[Surprise](https://investors.paya.com/news-releases/news-release-details/paya-holdings-inc-announces-commencement-exchange-offer-and). \n\nTurns out PAYA is doing well enough that they are **forgoing $200 million** to protect share value by buying back their warrants. This is pending a vote due on Sep 10 where they already have 63.5% of \u201cyes\u201d votes. \n\nFor those unfamiliar with the process here, I\u2019ll explain. Since PAYA was originally a SPAC, it has warrants. A warrant is basically a call option with a strike price of $11.50 and a 5 year term. [As stated in their S1](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001819881/000121390020035622/fs12020_payaholdings.htm), PAYA originally issued 17.7mil warrants (which would eventually dilute into the stock), however last week [they dropped the news](https://investors.paya.com/news-releases/news-release-details/paya-holdings-inc-announces-commencement-exchange-offer-and) that they would be calling for a \u201ccashless redemption\u201d of the warrants at a ratio of .26 shares per warrant, and changing the dilution from the long established 17.7mil to 4.6mil. \n\nThis is bullish because \n\n1. PAYA is saying they don\u2019t need the cash (the 17.7mil warrants exercised would have brought them $204mil) \n2. Instead of the float being diluted by 17.7mil shares, there will now be only 4.6mil shares issued. **This is a positive change of +11% which the market has not priced in.**\n3. The warrants don\u2019t have an upward cap, and can be bought as high as wanted in relation to the stock.\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\n# Part 4 The Short and Long Play\n\n**Fair value is** **at least $16.65** based on analyst coverage, warrant cashless redemption, and fundamental growth profit margins [growing at 42% YoY](https://investors.paya.com/sec-filings/sec-filing/10-q/0001819881-21-000035). They provide services that are growing exponentially and will remain in high demand for decades + their stock has received a ridiculous number of valuations all 46% higher than current valuation **before the warrant redemption news hit**. \n\nThere is still an immediate need for the market to react to the warrant redemption. Upside is at least 11% - from current $10.21 to $11.33 just on the news Friday alone (PSA - the options market has not priced this in at all yet) not even factoring in their massive revenue guidance, short coverings, or other catalysts they have lined up.\n\n**9/20 10c @ .60 = 733% returns at $11.33 by Sep 10** \n\n**9/20 12.5c @ .10 = 2400% returns at $15 by Sep 10**\n\n**11/15 15c @ .15 = 1800% returns at $17.5 in October**\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\n# Part 5 Options Flow\n\n1K+ Flow \n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\n# Part 6 Position\n\n\ud83d\udcf7",

I\u2019m just some dumb guy on the interwebs.)\n\n(**SOFI**) -  Pretty sure everyone knows sofi\u2026 One of my fav fintech stocks that is still very young and is growing very nicely. Seem to be making all the right moves.\n\n(**DKNG**) &amp; (**PENN**) - Rapidly growing. Will continue to have an expanding TAM as states legalize online gambling &amp; betting. Canada just passed some laws too. Both companies made some recent acquisitions to continue growth and expansion. They have their eyes set on going a lot further than where they are.\n\n(**DIS**) - Disney is a powerhouse. Their streaming business has been growing and parks will just continue to generate as we move past covid. Streaming, movies, theme parks, cruise lines, merchandise\u2026 they have their hands in everything. I think disney\u2019s streaming service is going to be a monster.\n\n(**KBWY**) - It\u2019s basically a REIT etf. It\u2019s got a high dividend yield. It\u2019s still not fully recovered from pre-pandemic levels. I believe real estate will continue to recover. I\u2019d just keep this forever and keep buying into it over time and let the DRIP grow it too.\n\n(**Z**) - Zillow got a lot of attention with the housing boom and is taking advantage of it. Apparently they\u2019ve been buying up a TON of real estate. I think that\u2019s a genius idea to streamline real estate transactions. High P/E currently but I think as their new plans unfold that will rapidly make a lot more sense.\n\n(**FISV**) - Love what they\u2019re doing in the fintech space. They\u2019ve been making a lot of acquisitions to expand their reach and I think they have a good plan to keep making their mark\u2026 BUT\u2026 not yet.

        "selftext": "Today Paysafe, a fintech company offering 70 payment types in over 40 currencies across 120 countries, announced yet another acquisition, viafintech, to expand its global leadership position in open banking and eCash network. This comes on the heels of two other recent acquisitions. The new acquisitions combined with nearly 30 deals this year reflect Paysafe\u2019s rapid and systematic execution on their strategy to restructure and expand into new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, and develop synergistic cross-selling opportunities.\n\nLast week, Paysafe beat Q2 revenue consensus, reported 41% volume growth and their first net profit as a publicly traded company. Initially upon the announcement, the stock shot up 10%.  But then pre-market headlines suddenly shifted and the stock gapped down and fell over 20% to an astonishingly low 3.85X price to sales.\n\nWhy did the stock shift down so suddenly? Instead of acknowledging the revenue beat or other positive developments, financial headlines simply repeated : \u201cPaysafe Stock Sinks After Third-Quarter Guidance Miss.\u201d\n\nTo be clear, Paysafe didn't miss or downgrade its own guidance. In fact, they reaffirmed full year 2021 revenue guidance of over $1.5 billion.  They also said they anticipated full year volume to grow 30% above guidance. ($130-140 billion vs \\~ $105 billion)\n\nSo why the miss?  Analysts\u2019 modeling assumed that 2021\u2019s remaining quarterly revenue growth would be linear, quarter to quarter, rather than taking into account the fact that sports betting, like sports, are seasonal. In the CC, Paysafe said they expect to meet full year guidance but predicted Q3 growth would moderate due to sports seasonality and Europeans going on vacation.\n\nThe company beat estimates but growth isn't linear. Got it. Seems a bit of an overreaction for the stock to tumble 20% with short volume spiking to 50% and shares available to short suddenly dropping by 70%.\n\nGaps like that typically get filled if there\u2019s no material negative news.  On the contrary, Paysafe reported very positive news:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Paysafe reaffirmed FY21 revenue guidance of $1.53 - $1.55 billion\n* Reaffirmed FY gross profit guidance of $930-$970M and $480-$495M EBITDA\n* Beat revenue consensus, $384 million vs. $378 million\n* Met Q2 profit guidance and met positive EPS consensus.\n* 13% YoY revenue growth (nearly triple last quarter)\n* 23% YoY rev growth (excluding unwinding 2020 channel exits/divestiture)\n* 41% growth in total payment volume (TPV)\n* Revenue growth in all segments\n* eCash revenue +37% YoY  (now live on Microsoft Store/Xbox in 22 countries)\n* North Amercian iGaming revenue +48%; volume +72% YoY\n* Digital Wallet EBITDA grew 16% with a 48% margin (as they unwind channel exits)\n* Expecting 2021 volume to be $130-140 billion, up significantly from $105 billion guidance\n* Improved debt rating, improved debt terms and lowered costs\n* Several new US states and Canada open new multi-billion dollar iGaming market where they are already market leader with first-mover advantage.\n* Expecting Q4/2022 ramp up with strong pipeline growth in acquiring &amp; E-commerce\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFurther, Paysafe announced two new acquisitions: PagoEfectivo and SafetyPay. These deals bring their eCash business up to a million distribution points in 60 countries while connecting them with the majority of Latin American banks, and sets, \u201cPaysafe up to be the leading open banking and eCash solutions provider in Latin America, one of the world\u2019s fastest-growing online markets.\u201d  Importantly, this move also expands their market leadership in iGaming and critical groundwork in Latin America\u2019s fast growing iGaming market for key partners (Roblox, Draftkings, WynnBet, ESL Gaming, Microsoft/Xbox, BetMGM, Ceasar\u2019s, PointsBet, Penn, Twitch, bet365 etc.)\n\nWith their ongoing US expansion, these acquisitions also enable Paysafe to offer a more secure person to person payment platform for the $100 billion in remittances sent each year to Latin America.\n\nImportantly, these deals are expected to pay for themselves as Paysafe\u2019s current projections don\u2019t include their combined $60M revenue and $20M EBITDA, 55% CAGR, multiple cross-selling synergies, and the ability to scale up quickly at little cost.  Management noted, \u201cThese transactions are expected to be accretive to 2022 and further enhanced our long-term growth as we drive multiple cross-selling opportunities across all Paysafe business units\u2026The deal synergies and our growth profile will allow us to de-lever quickly and meaningfully make progress in 2022 towards our target of 3.5 times adjusted EBITDA.\u201d\n\nThis quoted debt/EBITDA ratio is better than most fintechs, including FOUR, RPAY, AFRM, BILL, PAYS and FISV.  Even before they reach that target, the new interest rate of 3.25% indicates that their pro forma free cash flow to debt service ratio will be around 4.5 to 1.\n\nChairman of the Board Bill Foley noted, \u201cWe see exciting synergies in key industry verticals like iGaming where we want to win. From the start, we have had a plan to grow in areas where we can achieve scale through operational efficiency. It is great to see the team execute and create more opportunities for growth.\u201d\n\nThese new acquisitions are perfectly in line with Foley\u2019s play book. He is known for inorganically growing many companies through M&amp;A, as he did with FIS, growing it from $1 billion to $88 billion. \u201cThose characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYet financial news headlines ignored the positive developments and fixated almost exclusively on a Q3 miss resulting analysts\u2019 neglect to factor in predictable sports seasonality.  In fairness, there's no question management should have made this crystal clear to analysts in advance.  Still, the negative coverage fomenting 50% short volume was unwarranted.\n\nPaysafe vs PayPal\n\nSeemingly timed to help the short raid, an article tried to make the case that Paysafe was a bad investment compared to PayPal because PayPal is a \"free cash flow machine.\"  The author apparently didn\u2019t bother take into account that Paysafe actually generates proportionately more free cash flow than PayPal.\n\nIn fact, if you applied PayPal\u2019s EV/FCF ratio of 65x to Paysafe\u2019s 2020 $362 million in free cash flow,  Paysafe\u2019s share price would be $32.  A 4x gain from current levels.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nComparisons between Paysafe and PayPal are far from perfect but, since they are so common, here are a few more to consider:\n\n1. PayPal\u2019s Q2 ER also missed Q3 guidance AND was reported to be falling short on their 2021 full year guidance. (Paysafe reaffirmed all guidance.)  On top of that, PayPal missed on Q2 revenue consensus (Paysafe beat) and their Q2 EPS declined 22%YoY.  With all of that, headlines remained positive for PayPal and it went down only a third as much as Paysafe.  Keep in mind, PayPal came down from a lofty 15X price to sales on a real miss which is quite a contrast to Paysafe\u2019s dropping over 20% to 3.85X on primarily good news.\n2. Paysafe, a market leader in risk analytics, has spent much of 2020 strategically exiting the high risk \u201cbuy now/pay later\u201d business and riskier China market channels. They wisely did this just before China started cracking down on foreign payment processors. Meanwhile, PayPal has been entering both those same spaces.\n3. Due to the above divestiture and channel exits, Paysafe\u2019s growth has temporarily slowed. They reported 13% YoY growth but said, excluding those strategic moves, Q2 YoY growth would have been 23%, which may be a sign of growth to come. In Q2 PayPal reported 17% YoY growth.\n4. Between 2012 and 2020, Paysafe\u2019s revenue grew from $169 million to $1.43 billion (30.5% CAGR). During that same period, PayPal revenue grew $5.6 billion to $21.5 billion (17.8% CAGR).\n5. PayPal is currently much more profitable than Paysafe but, while PayPal\u2019s EPS is expected to grow 25% in 2022, Paysafe\u2019s EPS is expected to grow 425%.\n6. Based on Paysafe\u2019s $480 million EBITDA, PayPal\u2019s EV/EBITDA ratio of 47.2X would put Paysafe share price at $28.60\n7. Based on Paysafe\u2019s 2021E revenue of $1.53 billion, PayPal\u2019s Price to Sales ratio of 13.5X would put Paysafe\u2019s share price at $28.40.\n8. According to Reuters, in 2017, Paysafe was taken private for $4.7B (inclusive of debt) and is currently valued at under $8B (inclusive of debt).  During that time, including their 2020 revenue channel exits and divestiture, Paysafe grew revenue 18.2% CAGR.\n\n* By comparison, in that same time period, PayPal grew 17.8% CAGR.\n* Paysafe hasn\u2019t received much investor attention because it was private for the last 4 years so, while Paysafe\u2019s overall growth was somewhat higher, their market value is only up 75% higher in that the, versus PayPal\u2019s share value growth of 460%.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are obviously many different factors to consider so I\u2019m not making any claims about fair value here. It\u2019s simply interesting to note that all these comparisons (EV/FCF, P/S, EV/EBITDA, 4-8 yr growth) consistency put Paysafe\u2019s share price between $28 and $32.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSome Background:\n\nPaysafe is an extremely diversified global payment processor that is currently expanding into the US and Latin American markets. It is the #1 global leader in iGaming, the #2 digital wallet in the world, and is #4 globally in integrated merchant processing.\n\nAs an integrated back-end payment processor, most don\u2019t realize they are using Paysafe\u2019s gateway, whether by cash, debit, credit card or digital currencies.  Within the industry, Paysafe\u2019s proprietary scalable electronic payment platform was voted \u201cBest Omni-Channel Payment Solution\u201d, \u201cPayment Processor of the Year,\u201d and \u201cBest Payment Method.\u201d\n\nPaysafe is #2 globally in the digital wallet space with a presence in 120 countries. They own Neteller and Skrill, which was voted \u201cBest Digital Wallet\u201d for \u201cbest consumer take up\u201d, \u201cmost innovative technology\u201d with \u201cgreatest potential to disrupt current ecosystems.\u201d\n\nTrustpilot rates Paysafecard as \u201cExcellent\u201d (4.7/5 stars-31,981 reviews), Paysafe\u2019s digital wallet Skrill as \u201cgreat\u201d (4.1/5 stars-18,037 reviews) and Skrill Money Transfer as Excellent (4.8/5 stars - 8,349 reviews).\n\nBy contrast, Truspilot rates Stripe as \u201cAverage 3.4/5 stars- 6,208 reviews), Venmo as \u201cbad\u201d (1.2/5 starts - 222 reveiews), Zelle as \u201cbad\u201d (1.2/5 stars - 326 reviews) and PayPal as \"bad\" (1.2/5 stars-18,555 reviews).\n\nThrough its eCash network, Paysafecard enables those without basic ID metrics, credit cards, or even bank accounts (the 1.7 billion \u201cunbanked\u201d globally) to engage in eCommerce in over 50 countries. This segment grew 63% YoY. Recently, Microsoft introduced Payesafecard to its Xbox platform in 22 countries.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMOAT:\n\nPaysafe dominates in high growth verticals like iGaming and eCash/open banking because of its \u201crobust risk management.\u201d Their industry leading multi-jurisdictional regulatory expertise offers a durable advantage in spaces where competing fintechs are hesitant or unwilling to enter.\n\nCEO Philip McHugh from CC transcripts : \u201cWhen we talk about a deep and a wide MOAT, this is absolutely one of the areas that we see that benefit, where it\u2019s hard to copy.\u2026We have over 300 professionals dedicated to risk, compliance, and analytics. That is very, very rare in the payments space. It\u2019s a real strength of ours. We\u2019ve been able to track some of the top people in the industry, including the former CRO from PayPal, and we\u2019ve upgraded the team, we\u2019ve built some real data capabilities, and we see this continuing to be an area of differentiation for Paysafe versus others.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can de-risk some transactions where the market has abandoned many of these players\u2026we bring millions of consumers into the ecosystem. We bring unique ways to pay and access funds that a typical card processor certainly can\u2019t do. When you have that two-sided network, you change the conversation. When we speak to some of our largest iGaming customers, we\u2019re not only talking about take rates and comps, we\u2019re talking about revenue-generation, we\u2019re talking about attracting the types of customers that they want and they need in their ecosystem. That\u2019s a really, really powerful position to have.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\niGaming Expansion\n\nPaysafe is the global leader in iGaming payment processing, a space that is extremely difficult to enter due a very complex risk and regulatory landscape.\n\nImportantly, Paysafe's multi-year revenue projections do not include growth from their ongoing US iGaming expansion (projected at 55% CAGR). \u201cAt Paysafe, the iGaming market volume was estimated to be $3.4 billion in 2019, and is now projected to reach $47 billion in 2025.\u201d\n\nIn the wake of a US Supreme Court decision allowing state-legalized sports betting, Paysafe is actively laying the groundwork for their US expansion. They are already integrated with 75% of all US iGaming operators. They have first-mover advantage.\n\nAs Bill Foley says, \"we\u2019re seeding the future growth right now by state and by operator... The day a state opens up, we are there ready from a regulatory perspective, from a risk perspective, and from a product perspective. ...It\u2019s our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate.\"\n\nHe continues, \"It\u2019s going to be a land grab. We want to be out there about 10 miles ahead of everybody else... I have a vision that we should be THE digital wallet and have tie-ins with every major casino company that\u2019s headquartered or located in Las Vegas. There will be money to be made for everybody... We\u2019ve got a wide landscape we can attack. It\u2019s pretty exciting\u201d\n\nFund manager Dan Loeb agrees: \u201cWe believe the US is poised to become the largest online gambling market globally as it begins to deregulate state by state and Paysafe is exceptionally positioned to capitalize as the global market leader.\u201d\n\nCompass Point analyst Michael Del Grosso initiated coverage with an Outperform noting, \u201cPSFE operates in high-growth verticals, has a unique advantage in its consumer and merchant facing solutions, and offers exposure to a secular growth opportunity in the potential legalization of iGaming in the United States,\u201d\n\nSome headlines since Del Grasso wrote \u201cwe believe there is upside to our forecasts in the event of state-level legalization of iGaming.\u201d:\n\n* \"New York State Legalizes Online Sports Wagering\"\n* \"Maryland Online Sports Betting Bill Passes Legislature\"\n* \u201cNew Hampshire sports betting deal approved overwhelmingly; Hogan likely to sign\"\n* \"Arizona governor signs bill legalizing sports betting\"\n* \"Wyoming Legalizes Sports Betting\"\n* \u201cCaesars Entertainment (Paysafe partner) announced Official Sports Betting Partner of NFL\"\n* \u201cMichigan\u2019s online sports betting launch hailed a success, Ohio could follow this year\u201d\n* \u201cOhio legislators doubling down on legalized sports gambling\u201d\n* \u201cLouisiana Begins The Process of Legalized Sports Betting\u201d\n* \u201cPath to legalized Texas sports betting becomes more clear\u201d\n* \u201cNC lawmakers make push to legalize sports gambling to generate funding for schools\u201d\n* \u201cFlorida poised to offer sports betting under major gambling deal\u201d\n* \u201cLegal Sports Betting Could Get To California Sooner Than You Think\u201d\n* \u201cCanada legalizes single-game sports betting\u201d (Paysafe is market leader in Canada)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFintel reports institutions are accumulating PSFE 21 times more than they are selling and yet the current price is lower than what was paid by respected fund managers like Dan Loeb (Third Point 41.5 million shares), David Tepper (Appaloosa Management, 8.5 million shares), Aaron Cohen (Survetta Capital, 13 million shares), Dipanjan Deb (Francisco Partners, 20 million shares), Leon Cooperman (personally owns 1.1 million shares) along with Wells Fargo (13 million shares) and Blackrock (8.3 million shares).\n\nThe current low price poses an interesting proposition for value investors.  In the time since those fund managers decided to invest, Paysafe has had zero bad news while quietly and systematically executing on their strategy to expand to new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, improve margins, and develop synergistic cross-selling opportunities.\n\nEssentially, none of the following developments in value creation have been priced in:\n\n* Dec. 15 \u2014 Paysafe launches Paysafecash in the US to enable online cash payments\n* Dec. 21 \u2014 Paysafe partners with Amelco to plug US sports books into unified payments platform\n* Dec. 23 \u2014 Paysafe enables online cash payments for Microsoft customers\n* Jan 11 \u2014 Paysafe partners with Colorado\u2019s BetWildwood to provide unified payment platform\n* Jan 13 \u2014 Paysafecard launches in Moldova\n* Feb 1 \u2014 Paysafe expands Virginia Lottery partnership to integrate Income Access, its EGR B2B award winning marketing platform\n* Feb 17 \u2014 Paysafe partners with Luckbox to roll out Skrill and Neteller payment services\n* Feb 18 \u2014 Paysafe expands partnership with ESL Gaming, the world\u2019s largest esports company\n* Feb 23 \u2014 Paysafe\u2019s Skrill launches new fiat-to-digital currency withdrawal service\n* Feb 25 \u2014 Paysafe partners with Austria\u2019s A1 esports League\n* Feb 25 \u2014 Paysafe uses Snowflake to develop new cloud-based data science models\n* Feb 26 \u2014 Paysafe wins \u201cBest Omni-Channel Payment Solution\u201d 2021 MPE Award\n* Mar 1 \u2014 Paysafe partners with RentMoola to enable US renters to pay rent with Paysafecash eCash\n* Mar 4 \u2014 Paysafecard wins gaming industry SAGSE award for \u201cBest Payment Method\u201d\n* Mar 12 \u2014 Leeds United announces partnership with Skrill\\\\\n* Mar 15 \u2014 Paysafe expands U.S. partnership with PointsBet into Michigan\n* Mar 16 \u2014 Paysafe partners with Provema to enable online cash payments for loans and insurance purchases\n* Mar 18 \u2014 Paysafe announces new Board of Directors\n* Mar 19 \u2014 Paysafe to Power Payments for Play Alberta\n* Mar 25 \u2014 Paysafe\u2019s Skrill expands offering to US with Coinbase\n* April 1 \u2014 Paysafe\u2019s Neteller launches Knect customer reward program\n* April 1 -- Moody's upgrades Paysafe to B1; stable outlook\n* April 15 \u2014 Paulo Dybala signs as Skrill brand ambassador\n* April 21 \u2014 Paysafe achieves CarbonNeutral certification for 2021 and 2022\n* April 27 \u2014 Paysafe launches lifetime rewards for Skrill and Neteller customers\n* April 29 \u2014 Paysafe selects AWS for strategic cloud-based services as part of its cost saving restructuring\n* May 17 \u2014 Paysafe partners with TripGift to enable online cash payments for global gift giving\n* May 20 \u2014 Skrill USA launches Skrill Virtual Visa Prepaid Card in US\n* May 26 \u2014 REPAY partners with Paysafe to enable US merchants to accept online cash payments\n* June 1 \u2014 Skrill partners with Wix to support commence business growth\n* June 2 \u2014 Paysafe streamlines US SMB payments with SimplePayMe\n* June 3 \u2014 Paysafe and Golden Nugget expand partnership into Michigan iGaming market\n* June 7 \u2014 Paysafe expands US partnership with IntelliPay to offer online cash payments\n* June 23\u2014Swiss Residents Now Able to Settle Bills Using Paysafecash\n* June 29 \u2014 Paysafe expands FOXBet partnership into Michigan\n* June 30 \u2014 Paysafe Enables Online Cash Payments on Microsoft Store on Xbox\n* July 8 \u2014 Paysafe wins 2021 EGR B2B award for best \u2018Affiliate Software Supplier\u2019\n* July 8 \u2014 Paysafe Launches unique industry-leading global travel safeguarding model, offsetting risks of non-delivery of services due to events like Covid.\n* July 13 \u2014 Paysafe adds 20 new digital currencies to its digital wallet and expands this service to 11 new US states, bringing US presence to 48 states.\n* July 14 \u2014 Paysafe partners with WynnBet to provide US payment and marketing solution\n* July 19 \u2014 Paysafe expands into North American property management space with Smart Property Systems partnership to provide embedded payment solutions for property managers and tenants.\n* July 20 \u2014 Fantasy Sports Platform OwnersBox Launches New Affiliate Program with Paysafe\u2019s Income Access\n* July 21 \u2014 Paysafe Partners with Bankable, a global architect of scalable \u2018banking-as-a-service\u2019 solutions, to launch a broad range of integrated, omnichannel banking services.

This deal is a direct result of Paysafe\u2019s recently announced travel safeguarding model (July 8) which is unique in the payment industry in improving airline liquidity while reducing their costs and risks. \"Paysafe also allows airlines to offer travelers an extended choice of payment methods for direct sales. In addition to credit or debit card payments processed through Paysafe\u2019s leading payment gateway, travelers can also pay using the Paysafecash eCash solution as well as more than 100 other alternative payment methods, all protected from chargebacks.\" Based on travel in a normal year, this deal can potentially represent a transactional volume of $10 billion in eCash and $87 billion in credit and debit. (Many retail investors seem to not yet understand that Paysafe\u2019s gateway processes all sorts of payment methods including credit cards, debit cards, eCash, and even PayPal.)\n* Aug 9 \u2014 Ambassador Cruise Line appoints Paysafe as payments processor\n* Aug 10 \u2014 Paysafe appoints Chirag Patel, former Head of Payments at Santander and Amazon Intl., as CEO of Digital Wallet division\n* Aug 16 \u2014 Beats revenue estimates, raises volume guidance 30%\n* Aug 16 \u2014 Paysafe announces the acquisition of Safety Pay\n* Aug 22 \u2014 Paysafe announces acquisition of viafintech\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nM&amp;A / inorganic growth\n\nBill Foley, Chairman of Fidelity and now Chairman of Paysafe, recently reminded shareholders that Paysafe has, \u201can aggressive pipeline of M&amp;A opportunities I am leading management in pursuing.\u201d\n\nInorganic growth through M&amp;A is a major pillar of Paysafe\u2019s strategy going forward and it is significant that Bill Foley, a major shareholder, is leading the charge.  Foley is a known M&amp;A synergy wizard, particularly in the financial services arena. He took Fidelity National Financial from $3 Million market cap to $10.8 Billion. 3,600X growth. Over just the last five years, Foley successfully grew Ceridian 3.3X ($4.2B to $14B), Dun &amp; Bradstreet 5.6X ($2B to $11.3B), and Black Knight 8.7X ($1.6B to $14B).\n\nThrough his proven M&amp;A playbook, Foley is also legendary for growing FIS from $1 billion to over $88 billion market cap: an 88x return. He says \u201cThose characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.\u201d\n\nFoley discusses the FIS/Paysafe comparison further: \u201cFIS operated in a highly fragmented industry. We utilize platform and technology stack to consolidate and drive organic and inorganic revenue growth and improved margins. FIS expanded its product offering, invested in technology, and improved its scale and margins of the business. Today, that $1 billion investment has a market capitalization of $88 billion. FIS has very similar characteristics to Paysafe \u2013 an attractive platform with a defensible market position. Upside from acquisition integration, platform consolidation and cross-selling. We will cross-sell, cross-sell, and cross-sell. There are multiple attractive acquisition opportunities that will strengthen our market position even further and we're positioned to win in key attractive high growth markets.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nValuation Metrics:\n\nAbove I compared Paysafe with PayPal.  A while back I looked at a basket of fintech peers including PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, BILL, GPN, and Paysign.\n\n\\- Paysafe reports 30%+ EBITDA margin, mid-to-high teen EBITDA growth, and a pro-forma $400+ million in free cash flow.\n\n\\- By comparison, a third of the peer group reported negative EBITDA, half reported negative EBITDA growth, and a third negative free cash flow.\n\n\\- Paysafe also has better EPS than over half the group and better Debt/EBITDA ratio than 3/4 of them.\n\nThe group's collective growth rate of \\~12.5% is in the range of Paysafe's 10-13% projections but the company's estimates may be intentionally conservative as they do not take into account M&amp;A growth or their current expansion into US iGaming.\n\nSince 2017, Paysafe grew revenue 65% from $864 million to $1.418 billion (28% CAGR pre-Covid). In 2020, revenue stagnated due to restructuring and exiting high-risk Asian revenue channels.  In their last ER they noted, without those actions they would have reported 23% YoY revenue growth  But even if you include 2020\u2019s slow down, their overall revenue growth since 2017 was still 18% CAGR. This is roughly the same as PayPal\u2019s growth.\n\nGiven all the above factors, it seems fair to consider Paysafe's potential price based on an average of the multiples for the above peers:\n\nPaysafe\u2019s share price with average of sector peer multiples:\n\n* EV/EBITDA ratio : $122.09\n* EV/Rev ratio : $83.91\n* EV/FCF ratio : $87.86\n\nAverage: $97.95\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMore conservative price after removing all outliers in each category which put PSFE share price over $100\n\n* EV/EBITDA ratio : $50.75\n* EV/Rev ratio : $44.64\n* EV/FCF ratio : $44.18\n\nAverage : $46.52\n\nIn a nutshell, the basket of sector peers has an average growth within Paysafe\u2019s conservative projections yet they trade at 350-750% higher multiples. With Paysafe having better fundamentals than most, it is hard to argue that this is proportionate. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is not investment advice.  Just a collections of observations.  If I were to offer advise, I'd only suggest staying away from options.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSources:\n\nPaysafe Q2: [https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/\\_22bb7ead34a47affd0aaab44e42d92dc/paysafe/db/1111/9781/file/2Q21+Paysafe+Earnings+Presentation+vFinal.pdf](https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_22bb7ead34a47affd0aaab44e42d92dc/paysafe/db/1111/9781/file/2Q21+Paysafe+Earnings+Presentation+vFinal.pdf)\n\nReuters : Paysafe $4.7B - [https://www.reuters.com/article/paysafe-m-a-foley-trasimene-idUSKBN28H1GP](https://www.reuters.com/article/paysafe-m-a-foley-trasimene-idUSKBN28H1GP)\n\nPayPal Q2: [https://s1.q4cdn.com/633035571/files/doc\\_financials/2021/q2/Q2-21-PayPal-Earnings-Release.pdf](https://s1.q4cdn.com/633035571/files/doc_financials/2021/q2/Q2-21-PayPal-Earnings-Release.pdf)\n\nPayPal 2012 : [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PayPal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PayPal)\n\nPayPal 2020 : [https://s1.q4cdn.com/633035571/files/doc\\_financials/2020/q4/Q4-FY-20-PayPal-Earnings-Release.pdf](https://s1.q4cdn.com/633035571/files/doc_financials/2020/q4/Q4-FY-20-PayPal-Earnings-Release.pdf)\n\nPaysafe 2012 : [https://www.investing.com/analysis/optimal-payments:-still-at-discount-despite-ebitda-growth-137908](https://www.investing.com/analysis/optimal-payments:-still-at-discount-despite-ebitda-growth-137908)\n\nPaysafe 2020 - [https://www.paysafe.com/fileadmin/content/pdf/Analyst\\_Day\\_presentation\\_March\\_9\\_\\_2021.pdf](https://www.paysafe.com/fileadmin/content/pdf/Analyst_Day_presentation_March_9__2021.pdf)\n\n[https://iborrowdesk.com/report/psfe](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/psfe)\n\n[https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.paysafecard.com](https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.paysafecard.com)\n\n[https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.paypal.com](https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.paypal.com)",

        "selftext": " \n\n**PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, August 17, 2021**\n\nStocks fell firmly on Tuesday, with the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Dow Jones retreating from record levels yesterday amid a mixed batch of earnings results from major retailers and new economic data regarding retail sales. Looking ahead, market participants are waiting to hear from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, who is scheduled to speak later this week. Market participants will be waiting to see if there is any new information regarding a potential taper timeline. \n\nShares of Dow component Walmart (WMT) fell even after the big-box retailer posted second-quarter results that blew past estimates and raised its full-year guidance. Stimulus check spending, strong grocery demand and e-commerce sales helped push U.S. comparable sales excluding gas up by 5.5%, topping estimates but still slowing from last year's 9.9% surge. Home Depot (HD), meanwhile, missed on comparable sales for the second quarter, with these rising 4.5%, way below consensus estimates of a 5.5% increase. \n\nAccording to the Department of Commerce, for the month of July, retail sales in the US fell 1.1%, much higher than the drop of 0.3% expected and below the 0.7% increase in June, a sign that economic activity is slowing down, likely to the surge in the coronavirus delta variant and government stimulus drying up. Consumer spending makes up nearly 70% of US GDP, so market participants closely track these reports. \n\nChina released economic data for July that showed growth rates slow down dramatically as the world\u2019s second largest economy battles with summer flooding and the resurgence of coronavirus thanks to the highly contagious delta variant. Industrial production, a gauge of activity in the manufacturing, mining and utilities sectors, grew by 6.4% year-over-year in July, a sharp deceleration from the 8.3% rise in June and below the 7.9% growth expected. Retail sales, a key measurement of consumer sentiment in the world\u2019s most populous nation, grew by 8.5% in July, way below the 12.1% increase in June and missing the 11.5% expected by economists. \n\nThe National Bureau of Statistics noted \u201cthe impact of multiple factors including the growing external uncertainties and the domestic COVID-19 epidemic and flooding situation,\u201d according to a release. The bureau added that the \u201ceconomic recovery is still unstable and uneven.\u201d\n\nLooking ahead, market participants are set to receive the Federal Open Market Committee's July meeting minutes (which are basically notes of what was discussed) on Wednesday, offering more context around how much more amenable central bank officials have become to the notion of tapering their crisis-era asset purchases as the economic recovery takes place. As I have said in the past, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if there is more discussion about a potential timeline to begin tapering quantitative analysis, though I remain unconcerned. While the markets may react negatively, the real test will be in 2022 when discussions of raising the interest rates are brought to the table.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen doubled down on her support of President Joe Biden's plans increase investments in physical and human infrastructure in [an op-ed published on Yahoo Finance Tuesday.](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/infrastructure-bill-a-down-payment-on-the-economy-america-can-and-should-have-133058095.html) \n* Microsoft (MSFT) is investing in software startup Rubrik Inc. and the two companies will combine on products that will help customers hit by ransomware recover their critical data without paying hackers.\n* The Chinese government is at it again.

        "selftext": "Today Paysafe, a fintech company offering 70 payment types in over 40 currencies across 120 countries, announced yet another acquisition, viafintech, to expand its global leadership position in open banking and eCash network. This comes on the heels of two other recent acquisitions. The new acquisitions combined with nearly 30 deals this year reflect Paysafe\u2019s rapid and systematic execution on their strategy to restructure and expand into new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, and develop synergistic cross-selling opportunities.\n\nLast week, Paysafe beat Q2 revenue consensus, reported 41% volume growth and their first net profit as a publicly traded company. Initially upon the announcement, the stock shot up 10%.  But then pre-market headlines suddenly shifted and the stock gapped down and fell over 20% to an astonishingly low 3.85X price to sales.\n\nWhy did the stock shift down so suddenly? Instead of acknowledging the revenue beat or other positive developments, financial headlines simply repeated : \u201cPaysafe Stock Sinks After Third-Quarter Guidance Miss.\u201d \n\nTo be clear, Paysafe didn't miss or downgrade its own guidance. In fact, they reaffirmed full year 2021 revenue guidance of over $1.5 billion.  They also said they anticipated full year volume to grow 30% above guidance. ($130-140 billion vs \\~ $105 billion)  \n\nSo why the miss?  Analysts\u2019 modeling assumed that 2021\u2019s remaining quarterly revenue growth would be linear, quarter to quarter, rather than taking into account the fact that sports betting, like sports, are seasonal. In the CC, Paysafe said they expect to meet full year guidance but predicted Q3 growth would moderate due to sports seasonality and Europeans going on vacation. \n\nThe company beat estimates but growth isn't linear. Got it. Seems a bit of an overreaction for the stock to tumble 20% with short volume spiking to 50% and shares available to short suddenly dropping by 70%. \n\nGaps like that typically get filled if there\u2019s no material negative news.  On the contrary, Paysafe reported very positive news:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Paysafe reaffirmed FY21 revenue guidance of $1.53 - $1.55 billion\n* Reaffirmed FY gross profit guidance of $930-$970M and $480-$495M EBITDA \n* Beat revenue consensus, $384 million vs. $378 million\n* Met Q2 profit guidance and met positive EPS consensus. \n* 13% YoY revenue growth (nearly triple last quarter)\n* 23% YoY rev growth (excluding unwinding 2020 channel exits/divestiture)\n* 41% growth in total payment volume (TPV)\n* Revenue growth in all segments\n* eCash revenue +37% YoY  (now live on Microsoft Store/Xbox in 22 countries)\n* North Amercian iGaming revenue +48%; volume +72% YoY\n* Digital Wallet EBITDA grew 16% with a 48% margin (as they unwind channel exits)\n* Expecting 2021 volume to be $130-140 billion, up significantly from $105 billion guidance\n* Improved debt rating, improved debt terms and lowered costs\n* Several new US states and Canada open new multi-billion dollar iGaming market where they are already market leader with first-mover advantage.\n* Expecting Q4/2022 ramp up with strong pipeline growth in acquiring &amp; E-commerce\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFurther, Paysafe announced two new acquisitions: PagoEfectivo and SafetyPay. These deals bring their eCash business up to a million distribution points in 60 countries while connecting them with the majority of Latin American banks, and sets, \u201cPaysafe up to be the leading open banking and eCash solutions provider in Latin America, one of the world\u2019s fastest-growing online markets.\u201d  Importantly, this move also expands their market leadership in iGaming and critical groundwork in Latin America\u2019s fast growing iGaming market for key partners (Roblox, Draftkings, WynnBet, ESL Gaming, Microsoft/Xbox, BetMGM, Ceasar\u2019s, PointsBet, Penn, Twitch, bet365 etc.)\n\nWith their ongoing US expansion, these acquisitions also enable Paysafe to offer a more secure person to person payment platform for the $100 billion in remittances sent each year to Latin America.\n\nImportantly, these deals are expected to pay for themselves as Paysafe\u2019s current projections don\u2019t include their combined $60M revenue and $20M EBITDA, 55% CAGR, multiple cross-selling synergies, and the ability to scale up quickly at little cost.  Management noted, \u201cThese transactions are expected to be accretive to 2022 and further enhanced our long-term growth as we drive multiple cross-selling opportunities across all Paysafe business units\u2026The deal synergies and our growth profile will allow us to de-lever quickly and meaningfully make progress in 2022 towards our target of 3.5 times adjusted EBITDA.\u201d  \n\nThis quoted debt/EBITDA ratio is better than most fintechs, including FOUR, RPAY, AFRM, BILL, PAYS and FISV.  Even before they reach that target, the new interest rate of 3.25% indicates that their pro forma free cash flow to debt service ratio will be around 4.5 to 1.\n\nChairman of the Board Bill Foley noted, \u201cWe see exciting synergies in key industry verticals like iGaming where we want to win. From the start, we have had a plan to grow in areas where we can achieve scale through operational efficiency. It is great to see the team execute and create more opportunities for growth.\u201d \n\nThese new acquisitions are perfectly in line with Foley\u2019s play book. He is known for inorganically growing many companies through M&amp;A, as he did with FIS, growing it from $1 billion to $88 billion. \u201cThose characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYet financial news headlines ignored the positive developments and fixated almost exclusively on a Q3 miss resulting analysts\u2019 neglect to factor in predictable sports seasonality.  In fairness, there's no question management should have made this crystal clear to analysts in advance.  Still, the negative coverage fomenting 50% short volume was unwarranted. \n\n \n\nPaysafe vs PayPal\n\nSeemingly timed to help the short raid, an article tried to make the case that Paysafe was a bad investment compared to PayPal because PayPal is a \"free cash flow machine.\"  The author apparently didn\u2019t bother take into account that Paysafe actually generates proportionately more free cash flow than PayPal. \n\nIn fact, if you applied PayPal\u2019s EV/FCF ratio of 65x to Paysafe\u2019s 2020 $362 million in free cash flow,  Paysafe\u2019s share price would be $32.  A 4x gain from current levels.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nComparisons between Paysafe and PayPal are far from perfect but, since they are so common, here are a few more to consider:\n\n1. 1) PayPal\u2019s Q2 ER also missed Q3 guidance AND was reported to be falling short on their 2021 full year guidance. (Paysafe reaffirmed all guidance.)  On top of that, PayPal missed on Q2 revenue consensus (Paysafe beat) and their Q2 EPS declined 22%YoY.  With all of that, headlines remained positive for PayPal and it went down only a third as much as Paysafe.  Keep in mind, PayPal came down from a lofty 15X price to sales on a real miss which is quite a contrast to Paysafe\u2019s dropping over 20% to 3.85X on primarily good news. \n2. Paysafe, a market leader in risk analytics, has spent much of 2020 strategically exiting the high risk \u201cbuy now/pay later\u201d business and riskier China market channels. They wisely did this just before China started cracking down on foreign payment processors. Meanwhile, PayPal has been entering both those same spaces.  \n3. Due to the above divestiture and channel exits, Paysafe\u2019s growth has temporarily slowed. They reported 13% YoY growth but said, excluding those strategic moves, Q2 YoY growth would have been 23%, which may be a sign of growth to come. In Q2 PayPal reported 17% YoY growth.  \n4. Between 2012 and 2020, Paysafe\u2019s revenue grew from $169 million to $1.43 billion (30.5% CAGR). During that same period, PayPal revenue grew $5.6 billion to $21.5 billion (17.8% CAGR).\n5. PayPal is currently much more profitable than Paysafe but, while PayPal\u2019s EPS is expected to grow 25% in 2022, Paysafe\u2019s EPS is expected to grow 425%.\n6. Based on Paysafe\u2019s $480 million EBITDA, PayPal\u2019s EV/EBITDA ratio of 47.2X would put Paysafe share price at $28.60\n7. Based on Paysafe\u2019s 2021E revenue of $1.53 billion, PayPal\u2019s Price to Sales ratio of 13.5X would put Paysafe\u2019s share price at $28.40.\n8. According to Reuters, in 2017, Paysafe was taken private for $4.7B (inclusive of debt) and is currently valued at under $8B (inclusive of debt).  During that time, including their 2020 revenue channel exits and divestiture, Paysafe grew revenue 18.2% CAGR. \n\n* By comparison, in that same time period, PayPal grew 17.8% CAGR.\n* Paysafe hasn\u2019t received much investor attention because it was private for the last 4 years so, while Paysafe\u2019s overall growth was somewhat higher, their market value is only up 75% higher in that the, versus PayPal\u2019s share value growth of 460%.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are obviously many different factors to consider so I\u2019m not making any claims about fair value here. It\u2019s simply interesting to note that all these comparisons (EV/FCF, P/S, EV/EBITDA, 4-8 yr growth) consistency put Paysafe\u2019s share price between $28 and $32.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSome Background:\n\nPaysafe is an extremely diversified global payment processor that is currently expanding into the US and Latin American markets. It is the #1 global leader in iGaming, the #2 digital wallet in the world, and is #4 globally in integrated merchant processing. \n\nAs an integrated back-end payment processor, most don\u2019t realize they are using Paysafe\u2019s gateway, whether by cash, debit, credit card or digital currencies.  Within the industry, Paysafe\u2019s proprietary scalable electronic payment platform was voted \u201cBest Omni-Channel Payment Solution\u201d, \u201cPayment Processor of the Year,\u201d and \u201cBest Payment Method.\u201d\n\nPaysafe is #2 globally in the digital wallet space with a presence in 120 countries. They own Neteller and Skrill, which was voted \u201cBest Digital Wallet\u201d for \u201cbest consumer take up\u201d, \u201cmost innovative technology\u201d with \u201cgreatest potential to disrupt current ecosystems.\u201d\n\nTrustpilot rates Paysafecard as \u201cExcellent\u201d (4.7/5 stars-31,981 reviews), Paysafe\u2019s digital wallet Skrill as \u201cgreat\u201d (4.1/5 stars-18,037 reviews) and Skrill Money Transfer as Excellent (4.8/5 stars - 8,349 reviews).  \n\nBy contrast, Truspilot rates Stripe as \u201cAverage 3.4/5 stars- 6,208 reviews), Venmo as \u201cbad\u201d (1.2/5 starts - 222 reveiews), Zelle as \u201cbad\u201d (1.2/5 stars - 326 reviews) and PayPal as \"bad\" (1.2/5 stars-18,555 reviews). \n\nThrough its eCash network, Paysafecard enables those without basic ID metrics, credit cards, or even bank accounts (the 1.7 billion \u201cunbanked\u201d globally) to engage in eCommerce in over 50 countries. This segment grew 63% YoY. Recently, Microsoft introduced Payesafecard to its Xbox platform in 22 countries.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMOAT:\n\nPaysafe dominates in high growth verticals like iGaming and eCash/open banking because of its \u201crobust risk management.\u201d Their industry leading multi-jurisdictional regulatory expertise offers a durable advantage in spaces where competing fintechs are hesitant or unwilling to enter. \n\nCEO Philip McHugh from CC transcripts : \u201cWhen we talk about a deep and a wide MOAT, this is absolutely one of the areas that we see that benefit, where it\u2019s hard to copy.\u2026We have over 300 professionals dedicated to risk, compliance, and analytics. That is very, very rare in the payments space. It\u2019s a real strength of ours. We\u2019ve been able to track some of the top people in the industry, including the former CRO from PayPal, and we\u2019ve upgraded the team, we\u2019ve built some real data capabilities, and we see this continuing to be an area of differentiation for Paysafe versus others.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can de-risk some transactions where the market has abandoned many of these players\u2026we bring millions of consumers into the ecosystem. We bring unique ways to pay and access funds that a typical card processor certainly can\u2019t do. When you have that two-sided network, you change the conversation. When we speak to some of our largest iGaming customers, we\u2019re not only talking about take rates and comps, we\u2019re talking about revenue-generation, we\u2019re talking about attracting the types of customers that they want and they need in their ecosystem. That\u2019s a really, really powerful position to have.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\niGaming Expansion\n\nPaysafe is the global leader in iGaming payment processing, a space that is extremely difficult to enter due a very complex risk and regulatory landscape.\n\nImportantly, Paysafe's multi-year revenue projections do not include growth from their ongoing US iGaming expansion (projected at 55% CAGR). \u201cAt Paysafe, the iGaming market volume was estimated to be $3.4 billion in 2019, and is now projected to reach $47 billion in 2025.\u201d \n\nIn the wake of a US Supreme Court decision allowing state-legalized sports betting, Paysafe is actively laying the groundwork for their US expansion. They are already integrated with 75% of all US iGaming operators. They have first-mover advantage.\n\nAs Bill Foley says, \"we\u2019re seeding the future growth right now by state and by operator... The day a state opens up, we are there ready from a regulatory perspective, from a risk perspective, and from a product perspective. ...It\u2019s our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate.\"\n\nHe continues, \"It\u2019s going to be a land grab. We want to be out there about 10 miles ahead of everybody else... I have a vision that we should be THE digital wallet and have tie-ins with every major casino company that\u2019s headquartered or located in Las Vegas. There will be money to be made for everybody... We\u2019ve got a wide landscape we can attack. It\u2019s pretty exciting\u201d\n\nFund manager Dan Loeb agrees: \u201cWe believe the US is poised to become the largest online gambling market globally as it begins to deregulate state by state and Paysafe is exceptionally positioned to capitalize as the global market leader.\u201d\n\nCompass Point analyst Michael Del Grosso initiated coverage with an Outperform noting, \u201cPSFE operates in high-growth verticals, has a unique advantage in its consumer and merchant facing solutions, and offers exposure to a secular growth opportunity in the potential legalization of iGaming in the United States,\u201d\n\nSome headlines since Del Grasso wrote \u201cwe believe there is upside to our forecasts in the event of state-level legalization of iGaming.\u201d:\n\n* \"New York State Legalizes Online Sports Wagering\"\n* \"Maryland Online Sports Betting Bill Passes Legislature\"\n* \u201cNew Hampshire sports betting deal approved overwhelmingly; Hogan likely to sign\"\n* \"Arizona governor signs bill legalizing sports betting\"\n* \"Wyoming Legalizes Sports Betting\"\n* \u201cCaesars Entertainment (Paysafe partner) announced Official Sports Betting Partner of NFL\"\n* \u201cMichigan\u2019s online sports betting launch hailed a success, Ohio could follow this year\u201d\n* \u201cOhio legislators doubling down on legalized sports gambling\u201d\n* \u201cLouisiana Begins The Process of Legalized Sports Betting\u201d\n* \u201cPath to legalized Texas sports betting becomes more clear\u201d\n* \u201cNC lawmakers make push to legalize sports gambling to generate funding for schools\u201d\n* \u201cFlorida poised to offer sports betting under major gambling deal\u201d\n* \u201cLegal Sports Betting Could Get To California Sooner Than You Think\u201d\n* \u201cCanada legalizes single-game sports betting\u201d (Paysafe is market leader in Canada)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFintel reports institutions are accumulating PSFE 21 times more than they are selling and yet the current price is lower than what was paid by respected fund managers like Dan Loeb (Third Point 41.5 million shares), David Tepper (Appaloosa Management, 8.5 million shares), Aaron Cohen (Survetta Capital, 13 million shares), Dipanjan Deb (Francisco Partners, 20 million shares), Leon Cooperman (personally owns 1.1 million shares) along with Wells Fargo (13 million shares) and Blackrock (8.3 million shares). \n\nThe current low price poses an interesting proposition for value investors.  In the time since those fund managers decided to invest, Paysafe has had zero bad news while quietly and systematically executing on their strategy to expand to new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, improve margins, and develop synergistic cross-selling opportunities.\n\nEssentially, none of the following developments in value creation have been priced in:\n\n* Dec. 15 \u2014 Paysafe launches Paysafecash in the US to enable online cash payments\n* Dec. 21 \u2014 Paysafe partners with Amelco to plug US sports books into unified payments platform\n* Dec. 23 \u2014 Paysafe enables online cash payments for Microsoft customers\n* Jan 11 \u2014 Paysafe partners with Colorado\u2019s BetWildwood to provide unified payment platform\n* Jan 13 \u2014 Paysafecard launches in Moldova\n* Feb 1 \u2014 Paysafe expands Virginia Lottery partnership to integrate Income Access, its EGR B2B award winning marketing platform\n* Feb 17 \u2014 Paysafe partners with Luckbox to roll out Skrill and Neteller payment services\n* Feb 18 \u2014 Paysafe expands partnership with ESL Gaming, the world\u2019s largest esports company\n* Feb 23 \u2014 Paysafe\u2019s Skrill launches new fiat-to-digital currency withdrawal service\n* Feb 25 \u2014 Paysafe partners with Austria\u2019s A1 esports League\n* Feb 25 \u2014 Paysafe uses Snowflake to develop new cloud-based data science models\n* Feb 26 \u2014 Paysafe wins \u201cBest Omni-Channel Payment Solution\u201d 2021 MPE Award\n* Mar 1 \u2014 Paysafe partners with RentMoola to enable US renters to pay rent with Paysafecash eCash\n* Mar 4 \u2014 Paysafecard wins gaming industry SAGSE award for \u201cBest Payment Method\u201d\n* Mar 12 \u2014 Leeds United announces partnership with Skrill\\\\\n* Mar 15 \u2014 Paysafe expands U.S. partnership with PointsBet into Michigan\n* Mar 16 \u2014 Paysafe partners with Provema to enable online cash payments for loans and insurance purchases\n* Mar 18 \u2014 Paysafe announces new Board of Directors\n* Mar 19 \u2014 Paysafe to Power Payments for Play Alberta\n* Mar 25 \u2014 Paysafe\u2019s Skrill expands offering to US with Coinbase\n* April 1 \u2014 Paysafe\u2019s Neteller launches Knect customer reward program\n* April 1 -- Moody's upgrades Paysafe to B1; stable outlook\n* April 15 \u2014 Paulo Dybala signs as Skrill brand ambassador\n* April 21 \u2014 Paysafe achieves CarbonNeutral certification for 2021 and 2022\n* April 27 \u2014 Paysafe launches lifetime rewards for Skrill and Neteller customers\n* April 29 \u2014 Paysafe selects AWS for strategic cloud-based services as part of its cost saving restructuring\n* May 17 \u2014 Paysafe partners with TripGift to enable online cash payments for global gift giving\n* May 20 \u2014 Skrill USA launches Skrill Virtual Visa Prepaid Card in US\n* May 26 \u2014 REPAY partners with Paysafe to enable US merchants to accept online cash payments\n* June 1 \u2014 Skrill partners with Wix to support commence business growth\n* June 2 \u2014 Paysafe streamlines US SMB payments with SimplePayMe\n* June 3 \u2014 Paysafe and Golden Nugget expand partnership into Michigan iGaming market\n* June 7 \u2014 Paysafe expands US partnership with IntelliPay to offer online cash payments\n* June 23\u2014Swiss Residents Now Able to Settle Bills Using Paysafecash\n* June 29 \u2014 Paysafe expands FOXBet partnership into Michigan\n* June 30 \u2014 Paysafe Enables Online Cash Payments on Microsoft Store on Xbox\n* July 8 \u2014 Paysafe wins 2021 EGR B2B award for best \u2018Affiliate Software Supplier\u2019\n* July 8 \u2014 Paysafe Launches unique industry-leading global travel safeguarding model, offsetting risks of non-delivery of services due to events like Covid.\n* July 13 \u2014 Paysafe adds 20 new digital currencies to its digital wallet and expands this service to 11 new US states, bringing US presence to 48 states.\n* July 14 \u2014 Paysafe partners with WynnBet to provide US payment and marketing solution\n* July 19 \u2014 Paysafe expands into North American property management space with Smart Property Systems partnership to provide embedded payment solutions for property managers and tenants.\n* July 20 \u2014 Fantasy Sports Platform OwnersBox Launches New Affiliate Program with Paysafe\u2019s Income Access\n* July 21 \u2014 Paysafe Partners with Bankable, a global architect of scalable \u2018banking-as-a-service\u2019 solutions, to launch a broad range of integrated, omnichannel banking services. This technology driven partnership works synergistically with several segments including their new global travel safeguarding initiative. It also enables them to make the Paysafecash card brandable allowing their many partners to customize for promotions and gifts to drive customer traffic (and revenue for Paysafe).\n* July 26 \u2014 Paysafe\u2019s Boards adds Mark Booker, former COO of BetFair &amp; Trainline, who brings deep experience in two of Paysafe\u2019s key growth spaces: iGaming and travel.\n* July 27 \u2014 Parx Interactive integrates Paysafe\u2019s full payment suite in the first phase of a multi-state partnership\n* Aug 2 \u2014 Paysafe Acquires PagoEfectivo, a company with strong growth in a rapidly expanding market that will benefit from Paysafe\u2019s cloud-based platforms. This acquisition can offer tremendous growth to their eCash segment and will likely give PSFE\u2019s Q4 top line a solid boost.\n* Aug 4 \u2014 Paysafe Partners with ARC, a payment settlement service that processes $97 billion for over 200 airlines globally. This deal is a direct result of Paysafe\u2019s recently announced travel safeguarding model (July 8) which is unique in the payment industry in improving airline liquidity while reducing their costs and risks. \"Paysafe also allows airlines to offer travelers an extended choice of payment methods for direct sales. In addition to credit or debit card payments processed through Paysafe\u2019s leading payment gateway, travelers can also pay using the Paysafecash eCash solution as well as more than 100 other alternative payment methods, all protected from chargebacks.\" Based on travel in a normal year, this deal can potentially represent a transactional volume of $10 billion in eCash and $87 billion in credit and debit. (Many retail investors seem to not yet understand that Paysafe\u2019s gateway processes all sorts of payment methods including credit cards, debit cards, eCash, and even PayPal.)\n* Aug 9 \u2014 Ambassador Cruise Line appoints Paysafe as payments processor\n* Aug 10 \u2014 Paysafe appoints Chirag Patel, former Head of Payments at Santander and Amazon Intl., as CEO of Digital Wallet division\n* Aug 16 \u2014 Beats revenue estimates, raises volume guidance 30% \n* Aug 16 \u2014 Paysafe announces the acquisition of Safety Pay \n* Aug 22 \u2014 Paysafe announces acquisition of viafintech\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nM&amp;A / inorganic growth\n\nBill Foley, Chairman of Fidelity and now Chairman of Paysafe, recently reminded shareholders that Paysafe has, \u201can aggressive pipeline of M&amp;A opportunities I am leading management in pursuing.\u201d\n\nInorganic growth through M&amp;A is a major pillar of Paysafe\u2019s strategy going forward and it is significant that Bill Foley, a major shareholder, is leading the charge.  Foley is a known M&amp;A synergy wizard, particularly in the financial services arena. He took Fidelity National Financial from $3 Million market cap to $10.8 Billion. 3,600X growth. Over just the last five years, Foley successfully grew Ceridian 3.3X ($4.2B to $14B), Dun &amp; Bradstreet 5.6X ($2B to $11.3B), and Black Knight 8.7X ($1.6B to $14B).\n\nThrough his proven M&amp;A playbook, Foley is also legendary for growing FIS from $1 billion to over $88 billion market cap: an 88x return. He says \u201cThose characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.\u201d\n\nFoley discusses the FIS/Paysafe comparison further: \u201cFIS operated in a highly fragmented industry. We utilize platform and technology stack to consolidate and drive organic and inorganic revenue growth and improved margins. FIS expanded its product offering, invested in technology, and improved its scale and margins of the business. Today, that $1 billion investment has a market capitalization of $88 billion. FIS has very similar characteristics to Paysafe \u2013 an attractive platform with a defensible market position. Upside from acquisition integration, platform consolidation and cross-selling. We will cross-sell, cross-sell, and cross-sell. There are multiple attractive acquisition opportunities that will strengthen our market position even further and we're positioned to win in key attractive high growth markets.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nValuation Metrics:\n\nAbove I compared Paysafe with PayPal.  A while back I looked at a basket of fintech peers including PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, BILL, GPN, and Paysign.\n\n\\- Paysafe reports 30%+ EBITDA margin, mid-to-high teen EBITDA growth, and a pro-forma $400+ million in free cash flow.\n\n\\- By comparison, a third of the peer group reported negative EBITDA, half reported negative EBITDA growth, and a third negative free cash flow.\n\n\\- Paysafe also has better EPS than over half the group and better Debt/EBITDA ratio than 3/4 of them.\n\nThe group's collective growth rate of \\~12.5% is in the range of Paysafe's 10-13% projections but the company's estimates may be intentionally conservative as they do not take into account M&amp;A growth or their current expansion into US iGaming.\n\nSince 2017, Paysafe grew revenue 65% from $864 million to $1.418 billion (28% CAGR pre-Covid). In 2020, revenue stagnated due to restructuring and exiting high-risk Asian revenue channels.  In their last ER they noted, without those actions they would have reported 23% YoY revenue growth  But even if you include 2020\u2019s slow down, their overall revenue growth since 2017 was still 18% CAGR. This is roughly the same as PayPal\u2019s growth.\n\nGiven all the above factors, it seems fair to consider Paysafe's potential price based on an average of the multiples for the above peers:\n\nPaysafe\u2019s share price with average of sector peer multiples:\n\n* EV/EBITDA ratio : $122.09\n* EV/Rev ratio : $83.91\n* EV/FCF ratio : $87.86\n\nAverage: $97.95\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMore conservative price after removing all outliers in each category which put PSFE share price over $100\n\n* EV/EBITDA ratio : $50.75\n* EV/Rev ratio : $44.64\n* EV/FCF ratio : $44.18\n\nAverage : $46.52\n\nIn a nutshell, the basket of sector peers has an average growth within Paysafe\u2019s conservative projections yet they trade at 350-750% higher multiples. With Paysafe having better financials than most, it is hard to argue that this is proportionate. Either the entire field has to come down or Paysafe has to go up. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is not investment advice.  Just a collections of observations.  If I were to offer advise, I'd only suggest staying away from options.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSources:\n\nPaysafe Q2: [https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/\\_22bb7ead34a47affd0aaab44e42d92dc/paysafe/db/1111/9781/file/2Q21+Paysafe+Earnings+Presentation+vFinal.pdf](https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_22bb7ead34a47affd0aaab44e42d92dc/paysafe/db/1111/9781/file/2Q21+Paysafe+Earnings+Presentation+vFinal.pdf)\n\nReuters : Paysafe $4.7B - [https://www.reuters.com/article/paysafe-m-a-foley-trasimene-idUSKBN28H1GP](https://www.reuters.com/article/paysafe-m-a-foley-trasimene-idUSKBN28H1GP)\n\nPayPal Q2: [https://s1.q4cdn.com/633035571/files/doc\\_financials/2021/q2/Q2-21-PayPal-Earnings-Release.pdf](https://s1.q4cdn.com/633035571/files/doc_financials/2021/q2/Q2-21-PayPal-Earnings-Release.pdf)\n\nPayPal 2012 : [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PayPal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PayPal)\n\nPayPal 2020 : [https://s1.q4cdn.com/633035571/files/doc\\_financials/2020/q4/Q4-FY-20-PayPal-Earnings-Release.pdf](https://s1.q4cdn.com/633035571/files/doc_financials/2020/q4/Q4-FY-20-PayPal-Earnings-Release.pdf)\n\nPaysafe 2012 : [https://www.investing.com/analysis/optimal-payments:-still-at-discount-despite-ebitda-growth-137908](https://www.investing.com/analysis/optimal-payments:-still-at-discount-despite-ebitda-growth-137908)\n\nPaysafe 2020 - [https://www.paysafe.com/fileadmin/content/pdf/Analyst\\_Day\\_presentation\\_March\\_9\\_\\_2021.pdf](https://www.paysafe.com/fileadmin/content/pdf/Analyst_Day_presentation_March_9__2021.pdf)\n\n[https://iborrowdesk.com/report/psfe](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/psfe)\n\n[https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.paysafecard.com](https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.paysafecard.com)\n\n[https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.paypal.com](https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.paypal.com)",

        "selftext": "Paysafe, a fintech company offering digital wallets and integrated payment processing in 70 payment types in over 40 currencies across 120 countries, announced yet another acquisition, viafintech, to expand its global leadership position in open banking and eCash network. This comes on the heels of two other recent acquisitions. The new acquisitions combined with nearly 30 deals this year reflect Paysafe\u2019s rapid and systematic execution on their strategy to restructure and expand into new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, and develop synergistic cross-selling opportunities.\n\nThis morning, Paysafe also announced a deal with Glory, to \"improve access to the digital economy  for the estimated 2 billion people globally who remain unbanked\"\n\nLast week, Paysafe beat Q2 revenue consensus, reported 41% volume growth and their first net profit as a publicly traded company. Initially upon the announcement, the stock shot up 10%.  But then pre-market headlines suddenly shifted and the stock gapped down and fell over 20%. Forward price to sales of 3.85X is extremely low for a fintech.\n\nWhy did the stock shift down so suddenly? Instead of acknowledging the revenue beat or other positive developments, financial headlines simply repeated : \u201cPaysafe Stock Sinks After Third-Quarter Guidance Miss.\u201d\n\nTo be clear, Paysafe didn't miss or downgrade its own guidance. In fact, they reaffirmed full year 2021 revenue guidance of over $1.5 billion.  They also said they anticipated full year volume to grow 30% above guidance. ($130-140 billion vs \\~ $105 billion)\n\nSo why the miss?  Analysts\u2019 modeling assumed that 2021\u2019s remaining quarterly revenue growth would be linear, quarter to quarter, rather than taking into account the fact that sports betting, like sports, are seasonal. In the CC, Paysafe said they expect to meet full year guidance but predicted Q3 growth would moderate due to sports seasonality and Europeans going on vacation.\n\nThe company beat estimates but growth isn't linear. Got it. Seems a bit of an overreaction for the stock to tumble 20% with short volume spiking to 50% and shares available to short suddenly dropping by 70%.  With half the volume short, real sellers are drying up. Seems buyers are patiently waiting for short sellers to exhaust themselves. With only 3 million shares left available to short, this could come any moment.\n\nGaps like that typically get filled if there\u2019s no material negative news.  On the contrary, Paysafe reported very positive news:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Paysafe reaffirmed FY21 revenue guidance of $1.53 - $1.55 billion\n* Reaffirmed FY gross profit guidance of $930-$970M and $480-$495M EBITDA\n* Beat revenue consensus, $384 million vs. $378 million\n* Met Q2 profit guidance and met positive EPS consensus.\n* 13% YoY revenue growth (nearly triple last quarter)\n* 23% YoY rev growth (excluding unwinding 2020 channel exits/divestiture)\n* 41% growth in total payment volume (TPV)\n* Revenue growth in all segments\n* eCash revenue +37% YoY  (now live on Microsoft Store/Xbox in 22 countries)\n* North Amercian iGaming revenue +48%; volume +72% YoY\n* Digital Wallet EBITDA grew 16% with a 48% margin (as they unwind channel exits)\n* Expecting 2021 volume to be $130-140 billion, up significantly from $105 billion guidance\n* Improved debt rating, improved debt terms and lowered costs\n* Several new US states and Canada open new multi-billion dollar iGaming market where they are already market leader with first-mover advantage.\n* Expecting Q4/2022 ramp up with strong pipeline growth in acquiring &amp; E-commerce\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFurther, Paysafe announced two new acquisitions: PagoEfectivo and SafetyPay. These deals bring their eCash business up to a million distribution points in 60 countries while connecting them with the majority of Latin American banks, and sets, \u201cPaysafe up to be the leading open banking and eCash solutions provider in Latin America, one of the world\u2019s fastest-growing online markets.\u201d  Importantly, this move also expands their market leadership in iGaming and critical groundwork in Latin America\u2019s fast growing iGaming market for key partners (Roblox, Draftkings, WynnBet, ESL Gaming, Microsoft/Xbox, BetMGM, Ceasar\u2019s, PointsBet, Penn, Twitch, bet365 etc.)\n\nWith their ongoing US expansion, these acquisitions also enable Paysafe to offer a more secure person to person payment platform for the $100 billion in remittances sent each year to Latin America.\n\nImportantly, these deals are expected to pay for themselves as Paysafe\u2019s current projections don\u2019t include their combined $60M revenue and $20M EBITDA, 55% CAGR, multiple cross-selling synergies, and the ability to scale up quickly at little cost.  Management noted, \u201cThese transactions are expected to be accretive to 2022 and further enhanced our long-term growth as we drive multiple cross-selling opportunities across all Paysafe business units\u2026The deal synergies and our growth profile will allow us to de-lever quickly and meaningfully make progress in 2022 towards our target of 3.5 times adjusted EBITDA.\u201d\n\nThis quoted debt/EBITDA ratio is better than most fintechs, including FOUR, RPAY, AFRM, BILL, PAYS and FISV.  Even before they reach that target, the new interest rate of 3.25% indicates that their pro forma free cash flow to debt service ratio will be around 4.5 to 1.\n\nChairman of the Board Bill Foley noted, \u201cWe see exciting synergies in key industry verticals like iGaming where we want to win. From the start, we have had a plan to grow in areas where we can achieve scale through operational efficiency. It is great to see the team execute and create more opportunities for growth.\u201d\n\nThese new acquisitions are perfectly in line with Foley\u2019s play book. He is known for inorganically growing many companies through M&amp;A, as he did with FIS, growing it from $1 billion to $88 billion. \u201cThose characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYet financial news headlines ignored the positive developments and fixated almost exclusively on a Q3 miss resulting analysts\u2019 neglect to factor in predictable sports seasonality.  In fairness, there's no question management should have made this crystal clear to analysts in advance.  Still, the negative coverage fomenting 50% short volume was unwarranted.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPaysafe vs PayPal\n\nSeemingly timed to help the short raid, an article tried to make the case that Paysafe was a bad investment compared to PayPal because PayPal is a \"free cash flow machine.\"  The author apparently didn\u2019t bother take into account that Paysafe actually generates proportionately more free cash flow than PayPal.\n\nIn fact, if you applied PayPal\u2019s EV/FCF ratio of 65x to Paysafe\u2019s 2020 $362 million in free cash flow,  Paysafe\u2019s share price would be $32.  A 4x gain from current levels.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nComparisons between Paysafe and PayPal are far from perfect but, since they are so common, here are a few more to consider:\n\n1. PayPal\u2019s Q2 ER also missed Q3 guidance AND was reported to be falling short on their 2021 full year guidance. (Paysafe reaffirmed all guidance.)  On top of that, PayPal missed on Q2 revenue consensus (Paysafe beat) and their Q2 EPS declined 22%YoY.  With all of that, headlines remained positive for PayPal and it went down only a third as much as Paysafe.  Keep in mind, PayPal came down from a lofty 15X price to sales on a real miss which is quite a contrast to Paysafe\u2019s dropping over 20% to 3.85X on primarily good news.\n2. Paysafe, a market leader in risk analytics, has spent much of 2020 strategically exiting the high risk \u201cbuy now/pay later\u201d business and riskier China market channels. They wisely did this just before China started cracking down on foreign payment processors. Meanwhile, PayPal has been entering both those same spaces.\n3. Due to the above divestiture and channel exits, Paysafe\u2019s growth has temporarily slowed. They reported 13% YoY growth but said, excluding those strategic moves, Q2 YoY growth would have been 23%, which may be a sign of growth to come. In Q2 PayPal reported 17% YoY growth.\n4. Between 2012 and 2020, Paysafe\u2019s revenue grew from $169 million to $1.43 billion (30.5% CAGR). During that same period, PayPal revenue grew $5.6 billion to $21.5 billion (17.8% CAGR).\n5. PayPal is currently much more profitable than Paysafe but, while PayPal\u2019s EPS is expected to grow 25% in 2022, Paysafe\u2019s EPS is expected to grow 425%.\n6. Based on Paysafe\u2019s $480 million EBITDA, PayPal\u2019s EV/EBITDA ratio of 47.2X would put Paysafe share price at $28.60\n7. Based on Paysafe\u2019s 2021E revenue of $1.53 billion, PayPal\u2019s Price to Sales ratio of 13.5X would put Paysafe\u2019s share price at $28.40.\n8. According to Reuters, in 2017, Paysafe was taken private for $4.7B (inclusive of debt) and is currently valued at under $8B (inclusive of debt).  During that time, including their 2020 revenue channel exits and divestiture, Paysafe grew revenue 18.2% CAGR.\n\n* By comparison, in that same time period, PayPal grew 17.8% CAGR.\n* Paysafe hasn\u2019t received much investor attention because it was private for the last 4 years so, while Paysafe\u2019s overall growth was somewhat higher, their market value is only up 75% higher in that the, versus PayPal\u2019s share value growth of 460%.\n\nThere are obviously many different factors to consider so I\u2019m not making any claims about fair value here. It\u2019s simply interesting to note that all these comparisons (EV/FCF, P/S, EV/EBITDA, 4-8 yr growth) consistency put Paysafe\u2019s share price between $28 and $32.\n\nThis is not investment advice. Just a collections observations. If I were to offer advise, I'd only suggest staying away from options.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSources:\n\nPaysafe Q2: [https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/\\_22bb7ead34a47affd0aaab44e42d92dc/paysafe/db/1111/9781/file/2Q21+Paysafe+Earnings+Presentation+vFinal.pdf](https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_22bb7ead34a47affd0aaab44e42d92dc/paysafe/db/1111/9781/file/2Q21+Paysafe+Earnings+Presentation+vFinal.pdf)\n\nReuters : Paysafe $4.7B - [https://www.reuters.com/article/paysafe-m-a-foley-trasimene-idUSKBN28H1GP](https://www.reuters.com/article/paysafe-m-a-foley-trasimene-idUSKBN28H1GP)\n\nPayPal Q2: [https://s1.q4cdn.com/633035571/files/doc\\_financials/2021/q2/Q2-21-PayPal-Earnings-Release.pdf](https://s1.q4cdn.com/633035571/files/doc_financials/2021/q2/Q2-21-PayPal-Earnings-Release.pdf)\n\nPayPal 2012 : [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PayPal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PayPal)\n\nPayPal 2020 : [https://s1.q4cdn.com/633035571/files/doc\\_financials/2020/q4/Q4-FY-20-PayPal-Earnings-Release.pdf](https://s1.q4cdn.com/633035571/files/doc_financials/2020/q4/Q4-FY-20-PayPal-Earnings-Release.pdf)\n\nPaysafe 2012 : [https://www.investing.com/analysis/optimal-payments:-still-at-discount-despite-ebitda-growth-137908](https://www.investing.com/analysis/optimal-payments:-still-at-discount-despite-ebitda-growth-137908)\n\nPaysafe 2020 - [https://www.paysafe.com/fileadmin/content/pdf/Analyst\\_Day\\_presentation\\_March\\_9\\_\\_2021.pdf](https://www.paysafe.com/fileadmin/content/pdf/Analyst_Day_presentation_March_9__2021.pdf)\n\n[https://iborrowdesk.com/report/psfe](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/psfe)",

In 2015, [Michael Jordan, Mark Cuban and Ted Leonsis invested $44m into Swiss-owned Sportradar. ](https://techcrunch.com/2015/10/27/michael-jordan-mark-cuban-betting-44-million-on-sportradars-data/) At the time, SRAD was relatively unknown but this investment was seen as forward-thinking as [PASPA was repealed](https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/2018/05/14/supreme-court-sports-betting-paspa-law-new-jersey/440710002/) in May 2018. In July 2018, [CPPIB and TCV invested in SRAD at a valuation of $2.4bn](https://www.cppinvestments.com/public-media/headlines/2018/sportradar-announces-cppib-and-tcv-new-strategic-partners). The following events then played out:\n\n* In July 2020, it was [rumored SRAD was exploring plans to go public](https://www.sportico.com/business/finance/2020/sportradar-going-public-1234609311/)\n* In March 2021, it was rumored SRAD was going to enter a deal with Todd Boehly\u2019s HZON\n* In April 2021, it was announced that [rival Genius Sports (GENI) had won the NFL data rights](https://www.sportico.com/leagues/football/2021/nfl-data-deal-1234626096/) for an alleged $120m per year in cash and stock\n* In June 2021, SRAD reportedly pulled the proposed deal with HZON and went for a traditional IPO\n* In August 2021, it was announced SRAD would go public on the NASDAQ via IPO with valuation unknown\n\n**Underlying Numbers**\n\nSRAD is a solid, already long profitable company easily passing the \u201c[rule of 40](https://www.thesaascfo.com/rule-of-40-saas/)\u201d    adding together profit margin (22%) and CAGR (25%). They are often    compared to competitor GENI, though there are other competitors (Kambi,  Scientific Games, Stats Perform, IMG to name but name but a few).\n\nSRAD's estimated 2021 revenue of $645m more than double competitor GENI\u2019s    $255m, the latter of which was achieved inclusive of very expensive, negative ROI, NFL rights [costing over $120m (cash and stock).](https://www.espn.com/chalk/story/_/id/31180158/genius-sports-tapped-nfl-exclusive-distributor-data-sportsbooks)  When looking at 2020\u2019s revenue numbers of $489m (SRAD) and $150m (GENI), this is a fairer representation of the difference in scale. When compared with DKNG, SRAD\u2019s revenue is just 50% of DKNG\u2019s $1.25bn but the latter will lose $1bn in 2021.\n\n**SRAD Revenue, EBITDA, EBITDA Margin &amp; Net Income**\n\n[**https://imgur.com/a/SI45vle**](https://imgur.com/a/SI45vle)\n\nSRAD\u2019s  numbers tell a story of stability but an increasing profitability    trend, but is it explosive enough? The 2019 vs 2020 small revenue increase could be a concern, though no doubt related to Covid-19 and is offset by the impressive YoY EBITDA gain. The huge increase in 2021 is an encouraging sign for the path to $1bn+ with banked profits.\n\nI am struggling to see any issues with SRAD\u2019s financials but I will update this section if I receive it in the comments. The only question is whether $645m in revenue at a CAGR of 25% with $140m in EBITDA    warrants the valuation of the often quoted $10bn. The rest is solid and  this was the consensus from the public even with HZON looking to invest in SRAD.\n\n**CEO, Board &amp; Share Structure**\n\n[https://www.theofficialboard.com/org-chart/sportradar](https://www.theofficialboard.com/org-chart/sportradar) and filings\n\n* Carsten Koerl \u2013 CEO \u2013 [founded bwin](https://www.businesscase.at/beispielcase1) and sold it to fund Sportradar\n\nFrom the filing:\n\n***\u201cCarsten Koerl*** *has served as our Founder and Chief Executive Officer since our founding   in  2001.

We believe Mr. Koerl\u2019s experience and   insight, as  well as his deep knowledge of Sportradar, gained through   service as our  Chief Executive Officer, make him well qualified to   serve as a member of  our board of directors.\u201d*\n\nOthers:\n\n* Michael Jordan \u2013 Investor, Board (less than 5% majority interest)\n* Mark Cuban \u2013 Investor (less than 5% majority interest)\n* Ted Leonsis \u2013 Investor, Board \u2013 CEO of Monumental Sports (less than 5% majority interest)\n* Jeffery Yabuki \u2013 Chairman \u2013 Ex-CEO of Fiserv, a $15bn revenue company\n* Deirdre Bigley \u2013 Board \u2013 Ex-CMO of Bloomberg\n* Mark Walder \u2013 Board \u2013 CEO of Ringier, a billion dollar media company\n\nWell you can't say there's a lack of experience..\n\n**Sports Rights**\n\nRights are bought to be sold to sportsbooks for revenue. No matter how many    \u201cdeals\u201d or so called \u201cmoats\u201d a company owns, it is irrelevant if no revenue \u2013 or more specifically \u2013 no net income is generated.\n\nWe  know SRAD own NBA, NHL, MLB. But are these rights even profitable for SRAD? One statistic I found was \u201cSportradar achieved 62% MLB media revenue CAGR from 2015 to 2019.\u201d\n\nWe    know GENI own the NFL rights, but having only increased guidance from $190m to $255m including NFL rights monetization and their   acquisitions,  we know they will make a loss on such rights. Before this deal, their  revenue was \u201conly\u201d $190m for 2021, less than a third of SRAD\u2019s. So who  cares?\n\nMy approach  will be to  ignore all press releases and mention of rights unless   there is specific  information about their monetization. Instead, I will   focus on revenue,  EBITDA, margin and net profit/loss. If you are interested in a list  from the filing:\n\n\u201c*Sportradar leads on breadth of events coverage for sports data and odds. We  offer   the largest volume of data in the world across our peers,  leveraging   nearly 20 years of historical sports information. We  collect over 1.2   billion live data points per year from over 600,000  events in 37 sports.   In 2020, we generated 3.7 billion live and  pre-match odds changes   collected 1.9 billion betting tickets and  processed 21 billion odds   changes from betting operators. We have a  strong betting data rights   portfolio, including non-exclusive rights  to the National Basketball   Association (NBA) and the Major League  Baseball (MLB) in the United   States, as well as exclusive rights on a  global basis to the NBA   (excluding the United States and China) and  MLB (excluding the United   States). In addition, we hold exclusive and  worldwide media data rights   for the NBA and MLB (including in the  United States). We also have   exclusive and worldwide betting data  rights to the International Tennis   Federation (ITF), Tennis Australia  (TA) and Formula 1 and non-exclusive   rights to the Deutsche Fu\u00dfball  Liga (DFL) in most jurisdictions. Tier 1   sports, particularly in the  United States, tend to have official   partnerships with sports data  providers to create new revenue streams.   Official sports rights  partners have advantages in terms of renewals   because of tech  integrations. We are highly diversified across tiers of   customers and  tiers of sports content. We are not dependent on any   single sport data  right.*\n\n*In  addition to sports data, we provide our customers with the largest    sports audiovisual content offering including 200,000 events per year    across tier 1 and other-tier sports leagues. Sportradar provides global    coverage, with strong U.S. market positioning, including rights for    major U.S. sports leagues. Our current portfolio of audiovisual rights    includes MLB, NBA, DFL, Copa del Rey, Asian Football Confederation    (AFC), TA, ITF, Badminton Europe and the Professional Darts Corporation    (PDC).\u201d*\n\n**Clients**\n\nAs above, we should only consider the underlying hidden numbers of such deals. Therefore, I will only mention paying clients.\n\nFrom the filing:\n\n*\u201cWe have a large, blue-chip customer base, which consists of 1,612    customers as of December 31, 2020 and partners across more than 120    countries globally, including more than 900 sports betting operator    customers and over 350 media and digital platforms. Our customers    include many of the largest U.S. and global sports betting operators    such as Bet365, Caesars, DraftKings, Entain, FanDuel, Flutter and    William Hill; leading internet and digital companies such as Apple,    Facebook, Google, Twitter and Yahoo Sports; broadcasters and other media    companies such as CBS Sports, ESPN, Fox Sports and NBC Sports; and    league partners such as the NBA and ITF. We have also built a global,    market-leading portfolio of over 150 league, clubs and federations    relationships across 29 sports.\u201d*\n\n**Strategy**\n\nQuotes from the filing:\n\n***\u201cOur Growth Strategy***\n\n*Our vision is to entertain sports fans and bettors globally through    engagement across media, betting, gaming and beyond. We have continually    broadened our product portfolio to better serve our customers and    increase our touchpoints with end users across the sports betting value chain. The more knowledge of the end user that we are able to collect,    the more valuable our insights and platform services become to  leagues,   sports betting companies and media companies. These network  effects  also  enable us to enhance our product portfolio, serving as a  key  element of  our growth strategy.\u201d*\n\n*\u201cWe are part of a founder-led organization with a strategy that is focused on innovation and long-term value creation.\u201d*\n\n*\u201cOur product strategy is centered on speed, reliability and scalability to    match the demands of our customers. We use advanced algorithms to   create  scalable, customized insights in real-time with latency   averaging 700  milliseconds (\u201cms\u201d). We have one of the industry\u2019s   leading cloud native  storage and distribution platforms. We leverage AI   and machine learning  capabilities, based on our rich data lake, to   provide the most accurate  odds. We are innovators at the forefront of revolutionary new  technologies in sports data and analytics including   computer vision,  data visualization, virtual gaming and simulated   reality*.\u201d\n\nSportradar also believes in a profitable open source strategy but paying when the numbers make sense. A clue to this was [given in a leaked NFL letter](https://sportshandle.com/sportradar-genius-nfl-data/):\n\n*(A  single data provider is): \u201cnot only harmful to data supply companies like Sportradar, but also to the downstream market (bookmakers and  their   customers) where product choice is being restricted or removed  in  favour of an information monopoly.\u201d* [*https://igamingbusiness.com/seeking-truth-in-the-upcoming-data-battle/*](https://igamingbusiness.com/seeking-truth-in-the-upcoming-data-battle/)\n\nFor now, the revenue for SRAD suggests a multi-layered strategy is best rather than monopolistic deals.\n\n**Risks**\n\nA fairly generic set of risks is mentioned in the filing, but there were some business specific ones mentioned:\n\n* Business Model Risks - *We depend on the success of our strategic relationships with our sports league partners.*\n* *Social responsibility concerns and public opinion regarding responsible gambling, gambling by minors, match-fixing and related matters could    cause the popularity of sports betting to decline*\n* *We are subject to reputational risks related to betting-related match fixing, doping, and other sports integrity threats.*\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe  evidence points towards SRAD dominating the space over the next few    years. They have competition but contrary to surface level statements,  their underlying numbers are impressive and a good foundation for even more growth.\n\nBut what I have not answered is whether SRAD is a buy at $7,8,9, or even 10bn. The upside is too big to ignore and we can\u2019t be missing out on another DraftKings (5bn \u2192 20bn).\n\nWhat do ya'll think?",

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, August 17, 2021**\n\nStocks fell firmly on Tuesday, with the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Dow Jones retreating from record levels yesterday amid a mixed batch of earnings results from major retailers and new economic data regarding retail sales. Looking ahead, market participants are waiting to hear from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, who is scheduled to speak later this week. Market participants will be waiting to see if there is any new information regarding a potential taper timeline. \n\nShares of Dow component Walmart (WMT) fell even after the big-box retailer posted second-quarter results that blew past estimates and raised its full-year guidance. Stimulus check spending, strong grocery demand and e-commerce sales helped push U.S. comparable sales excluding gas up by 5.5%, topping estimates but still slowing from last year's 9.9% surge. Home Depot (HD), meanwhile, missed on comparable sales for the second quarter, with these rising 4.5%, way below consensus estimates of a 5.5% increase. \n\nAccording to the Department of Commerce, for the month of July, retail sales in the US fell 1.1%, much higher than the drop of 0.3% expected and below the 0.7% increase in June, a sign that economic activity is slowing down, likely to the surge in the coronavirus delta variant and government stimulus drying up. Consumer spending makes up nearly 70% of US GDP, so market participants closely track these reports. \n\nChina released economic data for July that showed growth rates slow down dramatically as the world\u2019s second largest economy battles with summer flooding and the resurgence of coronavirus thanks to the highly contagious delta variant. Industrial production, a gauge of activity in the manufacturing, mining and utilities sectors, grew by 6.4% year-over-year in July, a sharp deceleration from the 8.3% rise in June and below the 7.9% growth expected. Retail sales, a key measurement of consumer sentiment in the world\u2019s most populous nation, grew by 8.5% in July, way below the 12.1% increase in June and missing the 11.5% expected by economists. \n\nThe National Bureau of Statistics noted \u201cthe impact of multiple factors including the growing external uncertainties and the domestic COVID-19 epidemic and flooding situation,\u201d according to a release. The bureau added that the \u201ceconomic recovery is still unstable and uneven.\u201d\n\nLooking ahead, market participants are set to receive the Federal Open Market Committee's July meeting minutes (which are basically notes of what was discussed) on Wednesday, offering more context around how much more amenable central bank officials have become to the notion of tapering their crisis-era asset purchases as the economic recovery takes place. As I have said in the past, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if there is more discussion about a potential timeline to begin tapering quantitative analysis, though I remain unconcerned. While the markets may react negatively, the real test will be in 2022 when discussions of raising the interest rates are brought to the table.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen doubled down on her support of President Joe Biden's plans increase investments in physical and human infrastructure in [an op-ed published on Yahoo Finance Tuesday.](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/infrastructure-bill-a-down-payment-on-the-economy-america-can-and-should-have-133058095.html) \n* Microsoft (MSFT) is investing in software startup Rubrik Inc. and the two companies will combine on products that will help customers hit by ransomware recover their critical data without paying hackers.\n* The Chinese government is at it again. In their latest move, CChinese tech companies lost roughly a combined $50 billion in market cap today after the government proposed a sweeping new rules on how companies collect and use user data. Alibaba (BABA) is now at the lowest price since late 2019.\n* The world's largest nonfinancial companies had a record $6.85 trillion in cash on their balance sheets as of the end of the second quarter, according to data from S&amp;P Global Ratings. (Banks and other financial firms are usually excluded from corporate cash lists because they are required to hold a lot of money in cash due to the nature of their daily business operations)\n* **\\*\\*Please note that current stock price was written premarket and does not reflect closing prices\\*\\***\n* Accenture (ACN) target raised by JP Morgan from $308 to $364 at Overweight.

In 2015, [Michael Jordan, Mark Cuban and Ted Leonsis invested $44m into Swiss-owned Sportradar. ](https://techcrunch.com/2015/10/27/michael-jordan-mark-cuban-betting-44-million-on-sportradars-data/) At the time, SRAD was relatively unknown but this investment was seen as forward-thinking as [PASPA was repealed](https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/2018/05/14/supreme-court-sports-betting-paspa-law-new-jersey/440710002/) in May 2018.

The following events then played out:\n\n* In July 2020, it was [rumored SRAD was exploring plans to go public](https://www.sportico.com/business/finance/2020/sportradar-going-public-1234609311/)\n* In March 2021, it was rumored SRAD was going to enter a deal with Todd Boehly\u2019s HZON\n* In April 2021, it was announced that [rival Genius Sports (GENI) had won the NFL data rights](https://www.sportico.com/leagues/football/2021/nfl-data-deal-1234626096/) for an alleged $120m per year in cash and stock\n   * A [letter then leaked](https://sportshandle.com/sportradar-genius-nfl-data/) which explained SRAD\u2019s reasons for backing away from the deal citing a \u201cfivefold increase in fees\u201d\n* In June 2021, [SRAD reportedly pulled the proposed deal with HZON and went for a traditional IPO ](https://www.sportico.com/business/finance/2021/sportradar-ipo-spac-deal-1234631572/)\n* In August 2021, it was announced SRAD would go public on the NASDAQ via IPO with valuation unknown\n\n**Underlying Numbers**\n\nSRAD is a solid, already long profitable company easily passing the \u201c[rule of 40](https://www.thesaascfo.com/rule-of-40-saas/)\u201d  adding together profit margin (22%) and CAGR (25%). They are often  compared to competitor GENI, though there are other competitors (Kambi,  Scientific Games, Stats Perform, IMG to name but name but a few).\n\nSRAD's  estimated 2021 revenue of $645m more than double competitor GENI\u2019s  $255m, the latter of which was achieved inclusive of very expensive,  negative ROI, NFL rights [costing over $120m (cash and stock).](https://www.espn.com/chalk/story/_/id/31180158/genius-sports-tapped-nfl-exclusive-distributor-data-sportsbooks)  When looking at 2020\u2019s revenue numbers of $489m (SRAD) and $150m  (GENI), this is a fairer representation of the difference in scale. When  compared with DKNG, SRAD\u2019s revenue is just 50% of DKNG\u2019s $1.25bn but  the latter will lose $1bn in 2021.\n\n**SRAD Revenue, EBITDA, EBITDA Margin &amp; Net Income**\n\n[**https://imgur.com/a/SI45vle**](https://imgur.com/a/SI45vle)\n\nSRAD\u2019s  numbers tell a story of stability but an increasing profitability  trend, but is it explosive enough? The 2019 vs 2020 small revenue  increase could be a concern, though no doubt related to Covid-19 and is  offset by the impressive YoY EBITDA gain. The huge increase in 2021 is  an encouraging sign for the path to $1bn+ with banked profits.\n\nI  am struggling to see any issues with SRAD\u2019s financials but I will  update this section if I receive it in the comments. The only question  is whether $645m in revenue at a CAGR of 25% with $140m in EBITDA  warrants the valuation of the often quoted $10bn. The rest is solid and  this was the consensus from the public even with HZON looking to invest  in SRAD.\n\n**CEO, Board &amp; Share Structure**\n\n[https://www.theofficialboard.com/org-chart/sportradar](https://www.theofficialboard.com/org-chart/sportradar) and filings\n\n* Carsten Koerl \u2013 CEO \u2013 [founded bwin](https://www.businesscase.at/beispielcase1) and sold it to fund Sportradar\n\nFrom the filing:\n\n***\u201cCarsten Koerl*** *has  served as our Founder and Chief Executive Officer since our founding in  2001. Mr. Koerl also serves as Group Chief Executive Officer of Sports  Statistics and Information Systems Ltd, a subsidiary of Sportradar.  Prior to founding Sportradar, Mr. Koerl held a number of management  positions within the software development and gaming industry, including  betandwin Interactive Entertainment AG, an online betting company,  which he founded in 1997. He holds a Master of Electronic and  Microprocessor Engineering degree from the University for Applied  Sciences in Konstanz. We believe Mr. Koerl\u2019s experience and insight, as  well as his deep knowledge of Sportradar, gained through service as our  Chief Executive Officer, make him well qualified to serve as a member of  our board of directors.\u201d*\n\nOthers:\n\n* Michael Jordan \u2013 Investor, Board (less than 5% majority interest)\n* Mark Cuban \u2013 Investor (less than 5% majority interest)\n* Ted Leonsis \u2013 Investor, Board \u2013 CEO of Monumental Sports (less than 5% majority interest)\n* Jeffery Yabuki \u2013 Chairman \u2013 Ex-CEO of Fiserv, a $15bn revenue company\n* Deirdre Bigley \u2013 Board \u2013 Ex-CMO of Bloomberg\n* Mark Walder \u2013 Board \u2013 CEO of Ringier, a billion dollar media company\n\n**Sports Rights**\n\nRights  are bought to be sold to sportsbooks for revenue. No matter how many  \u201cdeals\u201d or so called \u201cmoats\u201d a company owns, it is irrelevant if no  revenue \u2013 or more specifically \u2013 no net income is generated.\n\nWe  know SRAD own NBA, NHL, MLB. But are these rights even profitable for  SRAD? One statistic I found was \u201cSportradar achieved 62% MLB media  revenue CAGR from 2015 to 2019.\u201d\n\nWe  know GENI own the NFL rights, but having only increased guidance from  $190m to $255m including NFL rights monetization and their acquisitions,  we know they will make a loss on such rights. Before this deal, their  revenue was \u201conly\u201d $190m for 2021, less than a third of SRAD\u2019s. So who  cares?\n\nMy approach will be to  ignore all press releases and mention of rights unless there is specific  information about their monetization. Instead, I will focus on revenue,  EBITDA, margin and net profit/loss. If you are interested in a list  from the filing:\n\n\u201c*Sportradar  leads on breadth of events coverage for sports data and odds. We offer  the largest volume of data in the world across our peers, leveraging  nearly 20 years of historical sports information. We collect over 1.2  billion live data points per year from over 600,000 events in 37 sports.  In 2020, we generated 3.7 billion live and pre-match odds changes  collected 1.9 billion betting tickets and processed 21 billion odds  changes from betting operators. We have a strong betting data rights  portfolio, including non-exclusive rights to the National Basketball  Association (NBA) and the Major League Baseball (MLB) in the United  States, as well as exclusive rights on a global basis to the NBA  (excluding the United States and China) and MLB (excluding the United  States). In addition, we hold exclusive and worldwide media data rights  for the NBA and MLB (including in the United States). We also have  exclusive and worldwide betting data rights to the International Tennis  Federation (ITF), Tennis Australia (TA) and Formula 1 and non-exclusive  rights to the Deutsche Fu\u00dfball Liga (DFL) in most jurisdictions. Tier 1  sports, particularly in the United States, tend to have official  partnerships with sports data providers to create new revenue streams.  Official sports rights partners have advantages in terms of renewals  because of tech integrations. We are highly diversified across tiers of  customers and tiers of sports content. We are not dependent on any  single sport data right.*\n\n*In  addition to sports data, we provide our customers with the largest  sports audiovisual content offering including 200,000 events per year  across tier 1 and other-tier sports leagues. Sportradar provides global  coverage, with strong U.S. market positioning, including rights for  major U.S. sports leagues. Our current portfolio of audiovisual rights  includes MLB, NBA, DFL, Copa del Rey, Asian Football Confederation  (AFC), TA, ITF, Badminton Europe and the Professional Darts Corporation  (PDC).\u201d*\n\n**Clients**\n\nAs above, we should only consider the underlying hidden numbers of such deals. Therefore, I will only mention paying clients.\n\nFrom the filing:\n\n*\u201cWe  have a large, blue-chip customer base, which consists of 1,612  customers as of December 31, 2020 and partners across more than 120  countries globally, including more than 900 sports betting operator  customers and over 350 media and digital platforms. Our customers  include many of the largest U.S. and global sports betting operators  such as Bet365, Caesars, DraftKings, Entain, FanDuel, Flutter and  William Hill; leading internet and digital companies such as Apple,  Facebook, Google, Twitter and Yahoo Sports; broadcasters and other media  companies such as CBS Sports, ESPN, Fox Sports and NBC Sports; and  league partners such as the NBA and ITF. We have also built a global,  market-leading portfolio of over 150 league, clubs and federations  relationships across 29 sports.\u201d*\n\nThanks to a post on Stocktwits, [see here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQKubqPADOM&amp;) [and here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDC8ykSrcrE&amp;)  we can see how strong SRAD\u2019s relationship is with DraftKings. I have  not found anything comparable for competitor GENI even though DraftKings  is one of their clients and even [signed a new deal recently for NFL data](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210805005567/en/DraftKings-and-Genius-Sports-Sign-Transformative-NFL-Official-Sports-Data-Single-Game-Parlay-and-Fan-Engagement-Agreement). SRAD also just [renewed their deal with Fanduel](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/19/sportradar-renews-deal-with-fanduel-after-ipo.html). But again, I tend to ignore these and focus on revenues, profitability and CAGR.\n\n**Strategy**\n\nQuotes from the filing:\n\n***\u201cOur Growth Strategy***\n\n*Our  vision is to entertain sports fans and bettors globally through  engagement across media, betting, gaming and beyond. We have continually  broadened our product portfolio to better serve our customers and  increase our touchpoints with end users across the sports betting value  chain. The more knowledge of the end user that we are able to collect,  the more valuable our insights and platform services become to leagues,  sports betting companies and media companies. These network effects also  enable us to enhance our product portfolio, serving as a key element of  our growth strategy.\u201d*\n\n*\u201cWe are part of a founder-led organization with a strategy that is focused on innovation and long-term value creation.\u201d*\n\n*\u201cOur  product strategy is centered on speed, reliability and scalability to  match the demands of our customers. We use advanced algorithms to create  scalable, customized insights in real-time with latency averaging 700  milliseconds (\u201cms\u201d). We have one of the industry\u2019s leading cloud native  storage and distribution platforms. We leverage AI and machine learning  capabilities, based on our rich data lake, to provide the most accurate  odds. We are innovators at the forefront of revolutionary new  technologies in sports data and analytics including computer vision,  data visualization, virtual gaming and simulated reality*.\u201d\n\nSportradar also believes in a profitable open source strategy but paying when the numbers make sense. A clue to this was [given in a leaked NFL letter](https://sportshandle.com/sportradar-genius-nfl-data/):\n\n*(A  single data provider is): \u201cnot only harmful to data supply companies  like Sportradar, but also to the downstream market (bookmakers and their  customers) where product choice is being restricted or removed in  favour of an information monopoly.\u201d* [*https://igamingbusiness.com/seeking-truth-in-the-upcoming-data-battle/*](https://igamingbusiness.com/seeking-truth-in-the-upcoming-data-battle/)\n\nFor now, the revenue for SRAD suggests a multi-layered strategy is best rather than monopolistic deals.\n\n**Risks**\n\nA fairly generic set of risks is mentioned in the filing, but there were some business specific ones mentioned:\n\n* Business Model Risks - *We depend on the success of our strategic relationships with our sports league partners.*\n* *Social  responsibility concerns and public opinion regarding responsible  gambling, gambling by minors, match-fixing and related matters could  cause the popularity of sports betting to decline*\n* *We are subject to reputational risks related to betting-related match fixing, doping, and other sports integrity threats.*\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe  evidence points towards SRAD dominating the space over the next few  years. They have competition but contrary to surface level statements,  their underlying numbers are impressive and a good foundation for even  more growth.\n\nBut what I have not  answered is whether SRAD is a buy at $7,8,9, or even 10bn. The upside is  too big to ignore and we can\u2019t be missing out on another DraftKings  (5bn \u2192 20bn).\n\nWhat do ya'll think?",
