        "selftext": "I can\u2019t believe I haven\u2019t seen any explanations on WSB (at least in recent months) about how the Sprott Physical Uranium Trust works, and how it helps to fuel the epic short squeeze going on in Uranium right now.\n\nThe physical trusts offered by Sprott are closed-end funds, meaning that when investors sell the fund, Sprott does not have to go out and also sell Uranium to fund outflows.\n\nIn other words, once uranium hits the Sprott vaults, it might as well be declared retired forever. \n\nThey are structurally diamond handed, which is important for a short squeeze to continue.\n\nSo how does more metal enter the fund?\n\nSprott has filed an \u2018at the money\u2019 share offering where they can issue new shares of the fund any time it trades at a premium to the fund\u2019s net asset value.\n\nEssentially whenever investors get excited and bid up the price of the ETF such that that shares are being bought for more than their underlying value, Sprott will issue new shares, sell them into the market (which helps bring down the premium), and then use this cash to buy more uranium for the fund.\n\nIn the span of a month investors already added enough uranium to the fund to exhaust Sprott\u2019s $300 million offering.\n\nLast week they filed a new offering to increase it from a $300 million program, to a $1,300 million ($1.3 billion) program.\n\nWhile this filing process has been ongoing the past few days, Sprott has not been issuing new shares. So inflows into the fund are driving up the premium to NAV.\n\nThe premium now sits at a record high 28.5%.\n\nFor perspective, during the Uranium surge that took price from the $20s to the $40s over the past month, the typical premium for the fund was in the mid single digit %s.\n\nSo 28.5% is absolutely remarkable. This is a dam about to break and drown everyone who lives on the other side. Once Sprott is able to issue shares once again, it will now be able to buy more uranium out of the market than anyone thought possible. $180-$200 is entirely possible here as a blow off top (currently at $45 a pound).\n\nAnd this is a minuscule market, so sprott\u2019s buying directly drives the price up. And because market participants know the price of uranium is effectively guaranteed to rise because of this guaranteed source of pent up demand, they are are willing to pay for the premium in the uranium fund to get a piece of the action. \n\nThis of course only drives the premium of the fund up further, allowing Sprott to issue even more shares, buy even more uranium, sending the uranium price up further, exciting more investors who will buy the fund, and the cycle repeats \n\nThis is effectively a short squeeze where the buying is being telegraphed ahead of time. Don\u2019t get me wrong, the short squeeze has begun, but buying here is the equivalent of buying GME a when it was in the $50-$100 range on the initial surge.\n\nSo what tickers can be offered up here? \n\nNot many, because the uranium space is tiny and WSB has a $1.5 billion market cap minimum.\n\nOptions? You can, but premiums are absurd now that the squeeze has already begun.\n\n$CCJ is one ticker you\u2019ve likely heard of, and it\u2019s the only one with mkt cap large enough to mention directly.  \n\nSprott Uranium Trust is the vehicle I\u2019ve written about here where you can buy uranium directly (rather than miners), and directly contribute to the squeeze, but I also can\u2019t post the ticker yet due to mkt cap concerns. It\u2019s also only available in Canadian and otc markets, but Sprott is trying to get it listed on the NYSE as well for the future. You can buy it via Fidelity and a few other brokers right now though. \n\nNorthshore uranium etf has lots of miners in it but a mkt cap of $350m so no ticker\n\nWant to sell shovels rather than set out on a mining adventure yourself? Sprott the company owns the uranium trust driving this whole thing and collects fees from it. Benefiting from the inflows into the fund as well as the underlying price appreciation of uranium.  They also have direct exposure to several uranium miners they\u2019ve invested in. They also aren\u2019t big enough yet at $1 billion to post the ticker.\n\nThis uranium short squeeze, powered by the Sprott physical trust is everything the silver squeeze should and could have been back in the first quarter.  If silver squeezers had bought the Sprott physical fund, PSLV, rather than ishares SLV, silver would be far higher now. Let this be an example of what\u2019s possible in commodities when physical demand overwhelms a relatively limited supply of available metal!",

        "selftext": "Disclosure: I am NOT long on Nintendo, but would very much like to be.\n\nToday, I noticed that NTDOY was nearing its 52-week low ($56.72, currently at $60), and I decided it may be a good time to buy some shares, as I'm generally bullish on Nintendo. I try to aim for companies that dominate a sub-sector of their related market, and Nintendo appears to have very much done that with the handheld gaming market. \n\n\nHowever, upon checking their ticker this morning, I noticed a strange pattern over the past 10 days (10 min candles), shown at the bottom of [this pic](https://imgur.com/a/HchhQHn). (This pic isn't going to be too friendly to those of you on mobile, so I apologize.) \n\n***\nFirstly, the ADX seems to be making wild swings every day, with OTO Buying dominating one day, and the OTO Selling dominating the next day (shown at the bottom.) This seems to have no effect on the price however, which seems to tank OTO everyday, after opening |1-2|% away from prior close. This pattern starts around 9/1-9/3.\n\n***\nSecondly, the price has regular major disparities between Close and Open, without any significant extended hours trading. I've seen major hops like this happening on meme stocks, but that's usually when paired with a lot more extended hours trading.\n\n***\nLastly, there appears to be some major institutional sell-off on 9/9 and 9/15. When I check the institutional holding via Fidelity, I see -0.1%. How is this possible? Would short positions result in \"negative holdings\"? Why are institutions so bearish on Nintendo? I mean, their stock has had its hard times in the past, but - IMO - they've demonstrated how their \"missteps\" can lead to great things (without the Wii and Wii U, there wouldn't be a Switch.)\n\n***\nI read that Nintendo recently did a share buyback. Would that cause this type of price action? If not, what would? Do institutional traders just hate video games? What's going on with NTDOY?",

        "selftext": "**For anyone trading these high redemption, low float DeSPAC plays, the gravy train can last for a few weeks until PIPE shares hit the market. What are PIPEs? Read up below:** \n\n \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rxbi3koal6o71.png?width=650&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=32f755c0f1fa5fd1fcc2888c0f26d09672e4c83b\n\n**WHAT ARE PIPES?**\n\n* PIPEs are Private Investments in Public Equity. PIPEs were a recent innovation in SPACs that allowed\n   * A) sponsors to raise more capital outside of the dilutive sponsor promote,\n   * B) provide a buffer to meet deal minimum cash conditions and\n   * C) most importantly enable the separation of shareholder vote from redemption feature by addressing the minimum cash condition.\n* Those last two points TRANSFORMED the SPAC market in that redemption-led vote failures became a thing of the past (a regular occurrence back in the day).\n* By utilizing PIPEs, sponsors were able to raise enough capital for the target and give SPAC IPO investors the ability to vote for a deal while also redeeming their shares for $10 + interest.\n* PIPE investors used to consist primarily of capital markets / direct investing / arbitrage desks of hedge funds. The goal of these funds were to make some reasonable return with the lowest possible risk.\n* These investors may have demanded a discount to the $10 trust price, warrant coverage, convertible security, etc. These guys were not looking to take a fundamental bet on the company but were purely facilitators of capital.\n   * BTW we are seeing a return of sweeteners for PIPE investors. Some examples: 890 5th Ave Partners / Buzzfeed (convertible notes), Seven Oaks / Boxed (convertible notes), Stable Road / Momentus (1 stock + 1 full warrant)\n* Valuation of course did matter and PIPE investors helped provide a feedback mechanism of what was overvalued (I'M PASSING ON THIS!) and what was reasonable (OK, I'LL TAKE A PIECE OF THIS DOWN).\n\n**HOW HAVE PIPES CHANGED?**\n\n* In earlier years the quality of sponsors and targets was spotty to say the least, however that started to change in 2020 as SPACs started becoming a more mainstream product attracting higher quality sponsors and targets. As a result of this, the structure and composition of PIPEs started to change.\n* Higher quality, longer-term \"sticky\" money like Fidelity and Blackrock along with strategic investors started to participate in PIPEs.\n* PIPE pricing also shifted from discounts/warrants/structured securities towards straight equity of $10 or even at a premium like Lucid or Enovix.\n\n**SO HOW DO THEY MAKE / LOSE MONEY?**\n\n* But hey these PIPE guys are making a lot of money RIGHT?! In good times and/or when they select the right deals, PIPE can be very lucrative. However, there is no free lunch for PIPE investors. While they do benefit from being \"brought over the wall\" to diligence potential SPAC targets before they are known to the public (a good source of those pesky leaks) and help set the valuation--as we've all seen, deals can and do fall below $10 at merger close.\n* Once a PIPE investor makes a commitment to participate in a deal, they are LOCKED and LOADED. That hot electric vehicle company they thought would MEME but on close cratered? At deal close they have to wire the funds they committed and now they're looking at big losses.\n   * \\*Sometimes PIPE holders try to back out causing litigation like TMC where $220M of $330M PIPE investors decided to give the company a middle finger and walk away\n* This may be fine for longer term or strategic PIPE investors, but for fast money hedge funds they will move quickly to cut losses. Hedge funds will look to short stock when allowed by the subscription agreement to \"box\" their long position and limit downside.\n* When can hedge funds short against long PIPE shares? Check the subscription agreement filed (8-K) at the time of deal announcement.\n   * It'll either explicitly state that PIPE investors can't short stock until deal close (most deals) or won't say anything which means PIPE investors CAN short stock anytime (e.g., Genius Sports, SoFi).\n   * There are also hybrid structures out there like Mudrick / Topps (Rest In Peace) where PIPE holders could short up to 50% of their holdings prior to deal close if the stock was above $15.\n* Back when SPACs were all working, these hedge funds may have let positions \"run\" and not hedged their positions. However given the recent market environment they're much more aggressive in locking in profits / mitigating losses.\n   * Another wrinkle to this dynamic is that many SPACs have experienced high redemptions, which means there is no borrow to hedge against, which means further potential selling pressure once the PIPE shares are freely tradable (see below)\n* When a deal closes and nears or breaks $10, perversely it forces the hedge funds to short causing more downward pressure. For the smart investor (such as you), you can take advantage of this technical selling to get into selective situations for cheaply.\n\n**DeSPAC DEGENS READ THIS CLOSELY:**\n\n* PIPE LOCKUP? For a vast majority of PIPEs, there are no lockups. Folks everywhere like talking about \"PIPE unlocks\", but what they are really referring to is when a PIPE is registered, effective and freely tradable. However, every deal is bespoke and some do include a rare lockup like Lucid.\n* Typically, PIPE investors are only limited in selling their physical shares because they have to be registered via S-1 process.\n   * The S-1 process usually goes like this:\n      * 1) Post deal close initial S-1 is filed\n      * 2) A few weeks later an amended S-1/A is filed\n      * 3) Finally a 1-1.5 weeks later you'll see a 424B and EFFECT filed showing that the registration is effective and holders can sell\n   * There may be a few amendments or sometimes the S-1 goes straight to being effective without any SEC comments. The whole S-1 process usually takes 45-60 days post closing.\n\n**WHAT EFFECT DOES PIPE HEDGING HAVE?**\n\n* One silver lining to the hedge funds shorting shares to box their long PIPE position - there won't be as much selling pressure from them once the S-1 goes effective because they're already \"flat\" and will close out their short position by collapsing w/ registered PIPE shares. \n   * But remember, low-float SPACs have little or very unstable borrow which deters shorting to box PIPE shares\n* Shorting prior to the S-1 going effective is not without risk. Borrow can get really tight leading to increasingly expensive cost and risk of recall. Just ask the guys that were short NKLA with unstable stock and covered at +$90 - yeesh. This is why many PIPE investors will seek stable \"term borrow\" and pay annualized rates of 10-30%.\n\n**IN CONCLUSION:**\n\n* PIPE investors are not all committed long-term investors, but they play a critical role in the capital raising function and valuation setting for SPACs. While it may not seem like they are on your side, they are more aligned with you than the sponsors!\n* PIPE investor's role as a price discovery mechanism is part of the reason why we've seen a trickle of deals now, but those that are getting done are at more reasonable valuations.\n\n**REREAD THIS - PIPE SHARES WILL COMING:**\n\n* And to drive this point home, if you are playing high redemption, low-float deSPAC plays, don't overstay your welcome. Once you see the S-1 filed, the days of low float will soon be over after the PIPE shares go through the registration process and the BAG PIPE HOLDERS can finally sell.",

        "selftext": "What\u2019s a SPAC-alackin, ya bunch of Mongols. Seriously, you guys have been barreling through the gates of high SPAC redemption this last month. IRNT? Did it. TMC? Got it. OPAD? Get it. So what else is on the menu\u2026? How about some easy peasy S. P. I. R. squeezy.\n\nThere\u2019s a million SPACs to squeeze, so\u2026 why this one? Let\u2019s start here, **LIQUIDITY**. The average daily volume over the last 5 days is only 2.3mm (115% float) for SPIR\u2026 whereas IRNT is 28.3mm (2,200% float), TMC 18.7mm (690% float), and OPAD 29.4mm (860% float). I mean\u2026 the volume was only 0.67mm on Friday before the pump. Um\u2026 say liquidity squeeze anyone? SPIR is so illiquid that DFV could squeeze this as a side hustle. Seriously, the capital required needs no hedgie (although we are accepting applications).\n\n**Company**\n\nSpire Global (SPIR) owns a ton of satellites that provide data and analytics for maritime, aviation, and weather purposes. That have several levels of subscriptions to provide. Their subscriptions are growing but\u2026 they lose money. For this play, we are all about the technicals so I won\u2019t spend time on fundamentals. Let\u2019s talk tech.\n\n**Liquidity Squeeze**\n\nAs noted above, this thing is so illiquid that you might wanna turn the bottle upside down. Plenty of other tickers have low float but only this one is a ghost town. \n\nThe total Class A shares outstanding is 134mm, most is locked up with insiders, institutions, and PIPE investors. The 23mm initial shares had 21mm redeemed (91%), leaving only 1.98mm shares for an effective initial float. For comparison, IRNT is 1.3mm, TMC 2.7mm, and OPAD 3.4mm. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[\\(Note those 5.75mm converted from Class B are allocated to the sponsor and are subject to a specific lock up, leaving only 1.98mm for float\\)](https://preview.redd.it/xnxv8zeieko71.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=90a18ecc10fe9b0b09a7b39ff710f0eb68d3c17f)\n\nAccording to the 8-K, the company must file for PIPE registration (S-1) within 45 days of the closing of the merger. The PIPE will account for an additional 24.5MM so\u2026 let\u2019s not over stay our welcome. The merger closed 8/16/21 so the deadline to submit the S-1 is by (or before) 9/30/21. As of Friday (9/17), no S-1 has been filed.\n\nThe timeline for EFFECT filing is variable but is typically 1-2 weeks after the S-1 is filed. Therefore, the potential timeline for PIPE is anywhere from 9/27 to 10/15. Once the PIPE is fully registered, all bets are off. The other investors are subject to a lock up for at least 60 days from closing (8/16/21). So for at least the next week, we stay squeezy.\n\n**Short Squeeze**\n\nShorts have been priming this over the last several weeks. SI now amounts to an estimated 1.05mm shares or 53% SI of the current available float of 1.98mm. There are no shares to borrow from IBKR or Fidelity and I\u2019d be willing to bet that\u2019s the same for other brokerages.\n\nThe average estimated short cost basis is $10.48. As of close Friday (9/17), shorts are at an estimated 30% average loss and we\u2019re just getting started.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Ortex as of 9\\/17](https://preview.redd.it/dvm5d2qqeko71.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9e899eef814f2f43ec0d915464228fff9aaae9c0)\n\nThe utilization has been at 100% and the cost of borrow is currently at 78% (ortex), 65% (IBKR), and 25% (Fidelity). the SI exceeds on loan by 78% which may indicate naked shorting. After all, if MMs have hedged the float but you degenerates keep buying, they gotta sell the fake shares.\n\n**Gamma Squeeze**\n\nThe option chain has been getting jacked over the last month. It\u2019s pretty insane due to the low float. Based on the OI reporting for 9/17 options on Friday, 0.8mm shares are tied to ITM contracts (net delta between ITM calls and puts). We\u2019re talking 40% of the float if exercised. \n\nIn total, the call OI for 9/17 expiration was 15,134 but\u2026 the remaining call OI for all other expirations is still 37,532 (48% which is tied to 10/15). The chain could get pumped further if call buying post-quad witching builds steam on Monday. After all, this is just getting started.\n\nOption surface plots across all expirations:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/aygyw7vxeko71.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=70279a245d30f7834ba762b0e779d5b8fd48b226\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/94dfd23zeko71.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c4411df89ec529a94805ae26fb2424ebf31e6b7d\n\nCall OI is tearing upwards while we see with our microscope that the puts are pretty pathetic. MMs are delta hedged to the tits but what about that sexy gamma ramp? How is hedging going to change as price rockets (per OI; per BSM):\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rqb54d61fko71.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d4ed00406b9b2d2e9bf824853cd1b95c267719d2\n\n(Note the x-axis for this graph is NOT strike, it is the actual stock price as it moves)\n\nThe price has been trading in the $7.5 - $12.5 range since deSPAC, requiring theoretical hedging anywhere from 0 - 150% of float. But\u2026 the hedging becomes insane above $12.5. On Friday, we saw the effect. The price broke up towards $15 before settling at close at $13.71. This price action required 150-200% float delta hedge\u2026 wow. If this break up above $20, the hedging blows above 250%. This is no joke and if the option chain continues to build, the gamma ramp will only get more psychotic.\n\n**Reading the tea leaves in the Charts**\n\nThere were bullish signals this last Thursday (9/16) and Friday (9/17). Thursday, we saw a bearish reversal candle. Based on other squeezes, this can be a signal of a bear trap before a breakout, just like we\u2019ve seen on GME, RKT, IRNT\u2026 so many others (CLOV, ATER, SPRT\u2026):\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/apkm9ul3fko71.png?width=560&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8744ac44df24f3f08e3faa80b9d49a1426627002\n\nRemember when everyone bailed on IRNT at like $25? Um\u2026 bear trap guys. Stage was set on Thursday for SPIR just like it was for IRNT. \n\nOn Friday, most SPACs were bleeding in sympathy with the fall of IRNT. However, midday, SPIR broke out from $10.70 up to $14.79. The price consolidated towards lower volume, curled up, then broke out again to finish the day at $13.71. Watching price action and the tape, there are signals a large player (or players) may by pushing. Since the ticker is so illiquid, it only takes a small volume of options activity to move. \n\n**Conclusion?**\n\nThis SPAC opportunity is unique due to liquidity issues. In addition, the short interest is maxed and the gamma ramp is stacked. With a little push (like Friday), this thing rockets.\n\nI am currently holding $10, $12.5, $20, and $25 10/15 calls\n\n**TL;DR**\n\n* SPIR produces data/info with satellites.\n* Combination completed 8/16/21. \n* PIPE may go effective is 9/27 \u2013 10/15.\n* 1.98mm float w/ 1mm shorts (none left to borrow).\n* Option chain is loaded with approximately 37,500 call OI AFTER 9/17. Delta hedging is stupidly high (250%+ of float) above $20.\n* Chart includes a bullish signal of a bear trap via a fake bearish reversal candle (just like IRNT).\n* Potential liquidity, short, and/or gamma squeeze possible with little capital required.",

        "selftext": "I have written posts on getting started before, but I keep seeing this specific question -\n\n*I have $1K/$2K/$5 and I want to be a trade, how do I get started?*\n\nMost new traders focus on using Options, but unfortunately they tend to jump right in.  Obviously if you are already an experienced trader than this post would not be for you.\n\nSo I am going to write out -this out step-by-step - these apply whether you are starting with $1k, $5K, $25K or $100K:\n\n**1)** ***Choose A Broker*** \\- Stay away from any mobile only broker, you want one that you can use on your laptop, has a good trading platform (I like *ThinkorSwim*, but *Interactive Brokers*, *TradeStation*, *Fidelity*, etc are all fine, it just depends on what matters most to you, so do your research).  Deposit your money and make sure you are able to trade Options and qualify for margin.  You also want a broker that allows you to use a Paper Trading account in *real-time -* this is essential (*ThinkorSwim is excellent for this capability)*.\n\n**2)** ***Learn*** \\- Before you make a single real trade, you need to learn.  A lot.  This can take months.  Most brokers offer free online courses for you to take.  There are also plenty of books out there (*Technical Analysis of the Financial Markets* by John Murphy, *How to Make Money in Stocks* by William O'Neil, *Options as a Strategic Investment* by Lawrence McMillian, *Trading in the Zone* by Mark Douglas, etc.) and plenty of videos that are purely educational (i.e. not trying to sell you something).  Soak up everything.  This is where you want to use your Paper Trading account.  As you learn how to trade, especially Options, try it out using the Paper account set to *Real Time*. It is also important that you not put an unrealistic amount of fake money into this account.  It should be similar to the actual amount you will be starting with in your real portfolio. At this point you are just trying to get a handle on how to trade the following:\n\n**a) Stocks** \\- fairly basic, but learn how to buy and sell stocks (going long and shorting).  And while most advanced traders use mental stops, as a beginner you will be using real ones, so also learn how to set them, including OCO brackets.\n\n**b) Options** \\- since most of you are not starting with a lot of capital, chances are you will be trading options a great deal.  Make sure you learn everything you can about Option trading before you ever spend one dime of real money making an Options trade.  So many new traders lose their money playing Options without really understanding the instrument.  Part of studying Options include learning the Greeks (Delta, Gamma, and Theta are the ones you will mainly use).   Understand how premiums work, and what IV does to the price of your Options (particularly during *events* like earnings or company announcements).  There is also a lot of enthusiasm around the idea of \"selling premium\" - which while an excellent method of generating income, can also be very dangerous if you do not know what you are doing.\n\n**c) Option Spreads** \\- correctly using Option spreads are the best way to grow an account below $25K.  They are also one of the more difficult things to master.  So spend a lot of time on these. The Options Playbook website is filled with information and as you will see - there are *many different types of spreads*.  I suggest getting most familiar with *Call Debit, Put Debit, Call Credit, Put Credit, Diagonals, Covered Calls,* and *Poor Mans Covered Calls.*  Using these strategies can both mitigate your risk while keeping your returns at a respectable level.\n\n**3)** ***Analysis -*** Up until now you should have been getting comfortable with the basics, but probably without much direction on how to choose the right stocks, when to enter and when to exit them.  This is where *Technical Analysis* comes in.  All of short-term trading is based on *Technical Analysis*.  Long-term investing is focused primarily on *Fundamental* analysis, but as a short-term trader (meaning you are holding for less than two weeks, and usually for less that two days) you really do not care what the fundamentals are behind the company you are trading.  If you are holding a position for a few hours or a few days, it doesn't really matter to you what their P/E ratio is, or how their future outlook was last reported.  What does matter are the charts.  You need to learn how to read the candlestick patterns, which indicators are useful (and which ones are crap), how to read the market, and of course, how to finds the right stocks.  *Technical Analysis* works because there is widespread consensus on it.  Meaning, if all traders, retail and institutions, believe that a price level is acting as *support* for a stock, they will act accordingly.  This part of your journey is probably going to be the most difficult to master - in fact, you will continue to learn and get better at it as you go along.  Every great trader never stops being a student of analysis, and neither should you.\n\n**4)**  ***Choose a good scanner -*** All this knowledge is not going to help if you cannot find the right stocks.  Most brokers come with decent scanners built into their platforms, and there are a number of free scanners available as well.  There are also a number of scanners out there that cost money, some of them are very good, while others are of questionable quality.  I have ones I recommend, but there are many out there that give you great stocks to trade every day.  Keep in mind, if you are looking to Day Trade than you are scanning on a much shorter time-frame then if you were Swing Trading.  By now you should have a good idea of what you want to scan for as well.  Most people will tell you to look for huge jumps in volume, which is always an important factor, but that mainly applies to *Momentum Trading*, **which you should be avoiding**.  You do want stocks that have high Relative Volume, but you also want stocks that are strong/weak to the market, have high liquidity, have a \"buy\" signal (whether it is a 3/8 cross on the EMA's, or a breach of consolidation, breaking through *resistance/support,* there are many different scenarios that qualify here).  These scanners should also help you create *Watchlists* and set alerts on charts so when a stock meets the criteria you have set you will get notified of it.  Going through charts and placing *alert lines* are a huge part of being a short-term trader.\n\n**5)** ***Choose a Journal*** **-** The three most popular are *Tradersync, Tradervue* and *Edgewonk.*  Whichever one you choose, make sure at the end of each day while paper trading you upload your trades to the journals and look at your statistics.  You want to focus on your win rate, profit vs. loss, and the types of trades you do well at, as well as the ones you tend to lose the most on.  Categories like *Type of Stock (price, market cap level, volume, etc.), Time of Day/Week, Trade size, Type of trade (Long, Short, Option Spread, etc.)* are all important to note and study.\n\n***These first five steps should take you at least six months.  Which means several months where you have not yet made a single trade using real money.  And you will be tempted - particularly as you start seeing trades in your paper account making huge returns.  Don't do it.  Until your win rate is at least over 60%, do not make a real trade.***  \n\n**6)** ***Choose a Strategy -***  Now that you have a good understanding of how to trade, and you have a decent amount of data in your online journal to see what is working for you, it is time to choose a strategy.  There are many strategies to choose from (I primarily use Relative Strength/Weakness against SPY, which may sound like RSI and/or Beta, but it is very different from those indicators, neither of which I use or put much stock in) but there is *one strategy you should* ***not*** *use - Momentum trading.  Especially Momentum trading low-float stocks.*  This method of trading is unfortunately what lures most traders into this field to begin with (countless YouTube videos promising you that you can get rich doing it) and it *seems so easy.  This type of trading is one of the most difficult strategies one can choose, and should only be done by people who are* ***very*** *experienced.*  There will be many people tell you about how much money they made or are making with *momentum trades*, most of which will try to convince you that they discovered some method that assures you of high level of profits.  *Don't listen to them.  Someone who is getting lucky for a few months is not the same as having a consistently profitable method that* ***you can count on***.\n\n**7)** ***Decide on a Community -*** Many people prefer to trade alone, excel at it even.  For me it was fine, but I much preferred trading in a good community.  However, there are many scams out there.  But if you are going to join a group, make sure you choose a service that:\n\n**a)** is not focused solely or mainly on *Momentum trading*. Most of them are.  You want a community that teaches a full 360 approach to trading.\n\n**b)** has pros in it.  People that actually do this for a living.  And make sure they are accessible.\n\n**c)** has an active live discussion.  This part is essential.  You want to be in a room that isn't a free-for-all, but rather focused on trading and led by actual professionals.  The ones that are mainly composed of amateurs throwing out trades all the time can actually hurt your trading.\n\n**d)** is filled with resources.  Any community you choose that is worth joining will probably cost you some money, so make sure they have useful resources, including scanners, platforms and educational content.\n\n**8)** ***Start Trading -*** Now that you have chosen your broker, learned the basic of trading, understand technical analysis, found a really good scanner, used to journal to help you choose which strategies you want to focus on, and decided on whether or not you want to be in a community - you are ready to trade.  ***Start small***.  I can not emphasize this enough.  If you have $2,000, then you are looking to perhaps do an Option Spread that costs $1.50 ($150) per contract and maybe do 2 contracts.  You want to buy just one In-The-Money Call or Put (Delta of .6 or higher) on a solid stock.  The key to being successful is *consistency* and that means hitting *singles*, not *homeruns*.  If you have $2,000 in your account and make $50 in a day, that is a 2.5% return, which is excellent.  Learn to be ok with slowly growing your account.  As your skill level increases, so will your profits - don't worry, in time it will come - but for now, settle for the small wins.\n\n**9)** ***Set Goals -*** Trading for a living is a business.  Treat it like one.  Set your monthly goals.  While you should not focus on your P&amp;L while trading (meaning you do not exit a trade because you are down or up a certain amount of money, but rather because the analysis tells you to exit) you *should* focus on you account balance in terms of the salary you need to live off day-to-day.   It is important to realize that if you reach your monthly goals on win rate, number of trades a day and profit per trade, you will also reach your monthly profit target as well.  Remember the ultimate goal here is that at the end of each month you are going to be taking out the profit (this is your salary) and leaving the base behind.  By the time you reach this step you should have a really good idea what type of profit you can expect from your strategy, and base amount in the account.\n\n**10)** ***Get an Accountant -*** Some people can do this themselves (I am not one of those people), but you want to make sure you are using the best possible set-up to pay the least amount of taxes.  Do you qualify for Day Trader status with the IRS?  Are you trading out of an IRA? Are you using an LLC or S-Corp? Since this is going to be your business, make sure you have your financials in order.\n\nSo there you go.\n\nWhy do most people fail at short-term trading?  Simple - they do not do any of these steps.  They deposit money, try to scalp low float gappers or buy a lot of options on the hot MEME stock. Eventually after losing enough money, they quit. ***That is why most short-term traders lose money.***\n\n*If one follows these steps, it should take roughly two years before you can expect to be consistently profitable.  Even after doing the first five steps, you will lose when you start trading with real money.  But if you are* ***trading small*** *like I suggest, it won't blow-up your account.*\n\nI know nobody wants to hear that it will take that long to get good at this.  But think of it this way - how much time, energy and money does one put into getting a job and working their way up to middle management?  Years of school.  More years of eating shit at a bunch of crappy jobs, working yourself to the bone to get promoted.  All for what?  A bigger cubicle? A VP title at a company that will fire you the moment they need to make \"cuts\"?  To have bosses that don't know what they are doing?\n\n***Trading for a living gives you financial freedom.***  The ability to make money no matter where you are, as long as there is an internet connection.  No boss.  Just you and the market.  **Having that life is worth the time and effort.** And I can tell you, it is great.  It is exactly as you would imagine it to be.  \n\n***For the past three years I have been a professional Day Trading and I could not imagine doing anything else.***\n\nSo I urge you - if you are trying to figure out how to get started - do this the right way - there are no shortcuts.\n\nFollow these steps and start your journey.",

However, I still think that there is a strong bullish case for DMYI and the risk-to-reward is aplenty. Please hop to the end for a tl;dr and happy to receive any criticism for this review.\n\n*tl;dr Quantum computing firm that merges next week. Backed by big names in oversubscribed PIPE, led by Niccolo (GOAT). Many bullish indicators including warrants and option pricing signal plenty of upside for both short- and long-term swings. ARQQ recently flew to $30+, which is a Quantum-related play also.*\n\n***I would buy common shares, sell near-term covered calls or naked puts to take advantage of IV. This is a no-brainer that has the ability to 10x in the next 5 years (if its not bought out).*** \n\n### dMY Technology Group Inc. III (DMYI) / IonQ Details\n\nThe IonQ deal is valued at $1.4B with projected 2026 revenue of $522M. It also reported a [tripling of 2021E bookings](https://ionq.com/news/september-09-2021-ionq-triples-expectation-for-2021) from $5M to $15M a couple of weeks ago.\n\n**Vote Date:** September 28, 2021  \n**Trust Size:** $300M  \n**EV:** $1.4B  \n**PIPE:** $350M: Fidelity Management &amp; Research Company, **Silver Lake, Breakthrough Energy Ventures (Bill Gates)**, MSD Partners, **Hyundai Motor Company and Kia Corporation**\n\nInvestor Presentation: [https://www.dmytechnology.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/IonQDeck-6.44-print.pdf](https://www.dmytechnology.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/IonQDeck-6.44-print.pdf)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;IonQ is building the world\u2019s best quantum computers to tackle such challenges. In addition to producing the **first and only quantum computer available via the cloud on both Amazon Braket and Microsoft Azure,** IonQ has defined what it believes to be the best path forward to scaling quantum computing power. By 2023, IonQ plans to develop modular quantum computers small enough to be networked together, which could pave the way for broad quantum advantage by 2025.

He led RSI ($19+ now) and GENI ($19+ now), which are both revered as successful SPACs compared to the many flops in the space. It looks like Niccolo is at it again with a SPAC that is ready to outperform in an oversubscribed round.\n\n&gt;\u201cThis was the easiest PIPE to raise of our career,\u201d de Masi said. \u201cHarry \\[dMY Chairman You\\] and I have done five SPACs between us. **This PIPE was the most oversubscribed so far. We weren\u2019t able to give everyone what they wanted. Because demand was high, some companies placed orders for a lot more than we were able to provide to them.**\u201d  [SRC](https://www.forbes.com/sites/moorinsights/2021/03/23/ionq-takes-quantum-computing-public-with-a-2-billion-deal/)\n\n# Bullish Indicators (Warrants and Options)\n\nWarrants were trading at $3.00+ for past few weeks, despite the common stocks of DMYI being at the floor at $10.00. **This signals bullish in the next 5 years that warrants are exercisable, as many traditional SPACs have their warrants under $2.00 -- even when the underlying commons are above $11/12.** \n\nSimilarly, I noticed a lot of option purchases over the next few months, specifically calls. There was a major imbalance to the cost of calls compared to puts. $15 strike calls (+50% upside) had higher premiums than $7.50 puts (25% downside) which shows bullish engulfment. Traditionally, the IV should have a $7.50 put similar to a $12.50 call since they indicate same price movement (+/- 25%). **Clearly, a lot of demand for these calls, as we have seen on Friday with DYMI move up and large purchases of Oct 15 calls.**\n\n# Quantum Space Growth and Sympathy Plays\n\nThere is no denying that quantum will be huge and play a big role in development of many existing Fortune 500 companies. Take, for example, ARQQ which just de-spacc'd last month. Yeah, it went to $30+ (granted it also is short float). \n\nOther recent Reddit Threads on this Topic:\n\n[Observations on DMYI Pipe](https://www.reddit.com/r/SPACs/comments/pt9810/some_observations_on_dmyiionq_pipe/)\n\n[DMYI - IONQ - the one and only first MOVER in this quantum revolution, beating GOOGLE and IBM by a huge mile!](https://www.reddit.com/r/SPACs/comments/pq6ayj/dmyi_ionq_the_one_and_only_first_mover_in_this/)\n\n[Goldman Sachs, QC Ware and IonQ Demonstrate Quantum Algorithms Proof-of-Concept $DMYI](https://www.reddit.com/r/SPACs/comments/pshh1w/goldman_sachs_qc_ware_and_ionq_demonstrate/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor, this is for educational purposes -- purchases are at your own risk.***\n\n***Disclosure: Long 3500 shares of DMYI with a mix of bullish calls and covered calls.***",

        "selftext": "Panic selling is common after stock market dips, and it\u2019s more likely to happen with certain investors, according to research from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\n\nWhen the market drops, men who are over age 45, or are married with children or have self-described \u201cexcellent investment experience\u201d are more prone to sell-offs, the research shows. \n\n\u201cThese are significant drivers of panic selling,\u201d said co-author Chi Heem Wong, researcher at MIT. And many who leave the stock market don\u2019t return, thereby missing out on recoveries.\n\nWhile the study doesn\u2019t uncover why some investors may be more vulnerable to emotional selling, financial experts say the findings raise further questions about how these factors \u2014 gender, age, marriage and family \u2014 affect behavior.\n\nThe research suggests these sellers have emotional overreactions defined by their decisions having the opposite of the intended effect, said Amanda Clayman, a financial therapist in Los Angeles. \n\n\u201cClearly, these are people who are trying to protect themselves,\u201d she said.\n\nWhile most investors are vulnerable to emotional choices, the findings from MIT align with other research showing men may be more prone to acting on their impulses. \n\n\u201cWomen are not as likely to take a huge decisive action like this because they\u2019re not quite sure that their impulse or their feeling is correct,\u201d Clayman said.\n\nMen are 35% more likely to trade investments than women, according to a study from Fidelity, and trying to time the market often leads to lower performance. \n\nMoreover, those trading to achieve stability during volatile periods often see the opposite results, another study from the University of British Columbia finds. \n\nControl bias\nSome males face pressure from an early age to \u201cfigure it out themselves,\u201d which may trigger a control bias, or thinking that can influence results when they can not, said certified financial planner Teresa Bailey, wealth strategist at Waddell &amp; Associates in Nashville, Tennessee.  \n\n\u201cThey sometimes feel that if they know enough about a subject, they should be able to control the outcome,\u201d she said. \u201cUnfortunately, there are far more variables at play when attempting to time the market.\u201d\n\nAnd once these investors get lost, it can be tough to seek guidance if they feel it\u2019s their role to solve the problem on their own, she said.\n\nChecks and balances\nAs humans primed with survival instincts, it can be challenging to avoid \u201cfight or flight\u201d responses like hitting the sell button when stocks plummet, Clayman said.\n\nHowever, someone possibly more susceptible to panic selling may want to create a system of checks and balances, such as calling a peer or discussing the decision with a partner, she said, to protect themselves from emotional responses.\n\n\u201cWe are not very accurate at assessing our actual threat response when we think about it ahead of time,\u201d Clayman said. \u201cMost of us freak out way more than we think.\u201d\n\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/27/panic-sellers-during-stock-market-dips-are-often-married-men-with-kids.html",

        "selftext": "Can anyone enlighten me on the voodoo that happens after the account rebalances from a stock purchase in a margin account? This is through Fidelity. Before the trade I had $32,000 margin buying power with about $11,000 non margin buying power on Friday. I made a purchase for about $8600 worth of stock X shares. Today my margin buying power is at a negative -$ 8,000 and non margin at a negative -$2,400. It\u2019s clear that my cash buying power was used because I have $2,400 left to withdraw from the account. So why does the system spazz out even though I didn\u2019t even use margin for the purchase and have over $20,000 equity in the account. I understand the stock is volatile but it doesn\u2019t make sense to me especially since I used non-margin buying power for the trade. Thank you!",

        "selftext": "I have just gotten approval to play with lvl 2 options on Fidelity, and I'm fishing for information as to what I should know. [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o8wqjy/a_beginner_and_intermediate_guide_to_options/) is what I can only assume to be a pretty good writeup on some stuff to look into options, but there's a certain paragraph  \n&gt; (0.5 x 340) / 10 = 17. What this means is that this option lets you be leveraged 17:1 on a single call option. So if you put let's say $1,000 into this call or purchase 1 contract, you have a position that is equal to $17,000 on the SPY.  \nthat sparked a question. As you can see in this quote, if we were to theoretically throw 1k into this scenario we'd be \"worth\" 17k in the market. What exactly does this mean? Does this mean I suddenly, magically have 17k to play with? If I were to close the entirety of this theoretical position, would I be sitting on 17k cold hard cash instead of the 1k I put in not a minute ago? \n\nThis line of thinking got me wondering more broadly how are life changing amounts of money being made and lost in options. In my brief youtube research adventures, one point that particularly stuck out to me was that the contract price is multiplied by 100 to get the actual price you'd pay for that contract. Poking around the various options chains on my watchlists, it seems that generally you'd need several hundred to several thousand dollars just to get a single contract. \n\nNow obviously the more you invest (or gamble) the greater dollar change you'll see for better or worse. So...are the massive gains and losses I see just by large stakes being placed, or is there (also) some hidden mechanic of options I've yet to learn about that creates these huge swings?",

        "selftext": " \n\nHello investors,\n\n[Part I Link](https://www.reddit.com/r/Midasinvestors/comments/otfytw/investing_psychology_part_i/) (recommended to read beforehand)\n\nFor those who are new, I wanted to share some of my thoughts regarding active vs passive investing.\n\nI think the topic for today's discussion is probably the single most important one for all of us, as the answer to the question would determine whether we should even trade in the markets at all.\n\nWhy would we ever trade individual stocks, commodities, or other assets if we can't actually \"beat the market\"? The market meaning the S&amp;P 500 index or the Dow for those based in the US.\n\nI know this will likely spark lots of criticism and intense discussions.\n\nTherefore, let me preface it with a few points first.\n\n\\- This is solely my personal opinion.\n\n\\- Your opinion is just as good as mine.\n\n\\- Full disclosure, I haven't worked as a portfolio manager at an institution so I certainly lack lots of experience in managing money compared to those who make a living out of managing pension or endowment money.\n\n\\- It's completely fine if you disagree. My goal is not to convince you but to help provide resources for people. The more you know the better.\n\n\\- I believe that an \"average person\" would be far better off investing in the market index, just as Warren Buffett said.\n\n\\- I agree with the academics, investors, and communities that most people shouldn't try to beat the market as most simply don't have enough time to analyze and monitor companies or have the discipline to stay invested in their ideas.\n\n\\- Investing is a game of probability, just like poker. This fund is \"more likely\" to beat the market means the fund has a high chance of beating the market, not \"will\" beat the market.\n\nIf you have a pair of aces in a poker game, you wouldn't necessarily win the pot but you have a \"high probability\" of winning the pot.\n\nPeople say poker is a game of luck but there are professional poker players who win over a period of time. I believe the same is true in investing. Not necessarily \"professionals\" but any investor can beat the market with the right amount of discipline and research.\n\n\\- Timing the bottom or top is impossible. But it is possible to guess the top or bottom with a probability. For instance, at the end of 2019, was it more likely that we were near the top of the market cycle or bottom? The answer is obvious.\n\nNow with all that said, I'll say the unpopular opinion.\n\nYes, we can \"beat the market\".\n\nMore specifically, I believe it is possible to beat the S&amp;P 500 net of fees even over a long period of time, say 20-30 years, for those with less than $50 million in the portfolio.\n\nHere are my arguments for today's topic.\n\n**1) It is possible to beat the market with a small portfolio as an individual investor.**\n\n**2)** **While it is possible to beat the market as an individual investor, two traits are essential for an investor to win. They are discipline and conviction.**\n\n**3) Security analysis doesn't require a rocket scientist. For instance, it's not hard to know e-commerce, EV, and cleantech will be the future.**\n\n**1) It is possible to beat the market with a small portfolio as an individual investor.**\n\nBut beating the market isn't enough. You have to consistently beat it, for 5 years, 10 years, and 30 years.\n\nI'm sure most of you know that a 1% difference in the 30-year annual return can make a huge difference at the end of the 30-year period due to compounding.\n\nWhat most probably don't know is the distribution of those returns from a portfolio point of view.\n\nIf you make an annual rate of 15% return over the course of 30 years, that doesn't mean you need to make 15% of return every single year in practical terms.\n\nWhat's happening is that over the course of 30 years, you will make 200% returns, 100% returns 60% returns in the early part of the 30 years, and then slowly decline to 5% annual returns, which altogether make 15% annual return over the course of 30 years.\n\nTheoretically, any investor's portfolio will look something along the lines of this over a time period.\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\nThe total compounded annual return is 15%, not the actual annual returns.\n\nThis makes sense because, with a $50k portfolio, you will obviously be more concentrated in positions compared to a $50MM portfolio. Therefore, you are taking more \"risk\" in a smaller portfolio.\n\nSimilarly, Berkshire Hathaway, the conglomerate run by Warren Buffett, has posted annual returns that look somewhat similar.\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\nIf you noticed, the standard deviations are much larger in the earlier part of the years compared to the latter part of the years when the portfolio simply got too big to take that much risk.\n\nIn fact, the standard deviation of the returns for the first 20 years is 42% compared to 16% in the last 20 years.\n\n**Where I'm getting at is it is much easier to beat the market by a wide margin with a small-sized portfolio than a large portfolio and therefore, retail investors have a good chance of beating the market, given an appropriate knowledge and discipline.**\n\nIt may be common-sense but to reiterate, it is much easier to double a portfolio of $500k than to double a $50 million.\n\nYou may think the reason is that you're taking larger risks on smaller portfolios than larger portfolios.\n\nIt is true that risks are larger. However, it also depends on how you define \"risk\".\n\nStandard deviations are obviously larger in a smaller portfolio since your absolute size is smaller and therefore, you can't diversify as much.\n\nBut standard deviations aren't truly the \"risk\" of a company going under. The true risk of a company going bankrupt is the liquidity, cash flow, and business profile. Even with a concentrated portfolio, I believe it's possible to get large returns with limited \"risks\" as retail investors.\n\nNow, to reduce those idiosyncratic \"risks\" of businesses, we need to apply our \"knowledge\" and \"discipline\".\n\nWhich brings to my second argument.\n\n**2)** **While it is possible to beat the market as an individual investor, two traits are essential for an investor to win. They are discipline and conviction.**\n\nMost people will sell at lows and buy at highs. We sell at lows because once a stock goes down, our cognitive bias kicks in, called the loss aversion bias. We put more weight on losing $100 than gaining $100 and thus, losing money has more impact on us than gaining money.\n\nThis is due to evolutionary psychology and there's a good reason why we were evolved this way but that's a topic of conversation for another day.\n\nWe also buy at highs because we tend to follow the herd, getting into the hype of trends and manias. Fear of missing out (FOMO) is a strong incentive for people to get in on the EV hype.\n\nPeople at cocktail parties will brag about their 4x returns on bitcoin or Tesla, which will prompt you to buy them the next day.\n\nBuying at highs and selling at lows are due to a lack of discipline, as the famous investors put it.\n\nThis is also the reason why professionals say \"invest in what you know\". If you invest in what you don't know, then you will be tempted to sell when stocks go down because you don't know the company and don't have such a high conviction that it will recover.\n\nAs an analogy, I have seen many people make new year's resolutions as losing weight or saving more money to buy a house.\n\nWhy is it so hard to do both?\n\nIn fact, all of us actually know how to lose weight: eat less and exercise more. Burn more calories than you consume. It's as simple as that.\n\nWe also know how to increase the balance on our bank account. Spend less than what you earn, or increase your earnings through side-gigs.\n\nIt doesn't take a genius to figure out the solutions to these problems. I believe the same is true for the markets. People generally know which companies will be better off in ten years (Disney, Amazon, JP Morgan, etc.).\n\nSo why do people lack the discipline to stick to their plans?\n\nAgain, there's a good evolutionary reason which I won't get into in this post.\n\nIf Amazon fell 30% today and stayed there fore the next month or two while other EV companies rose 50% in the same time period, most people would be tempted to sell their Amazon and buy those EV companies, hence the \"sell low buy high\" phenomenon.\n\nTake this analysis shown on WSJ.\n\n**The returns of a hypothetical investor who put $10,000 into an S&amp;P 500 index fund at the start of 1980 and missed the market\u2019s five best days through the end of August 2020 would be 38 percentage points lower than those of someone who stayed invested the whole period, according to a Fidelity Investments Inc. analysis.**\n\nThis is the significance of self-discipline, the ability to weather through the tough times, or carefully ride the trends.\n\nTo gain self-discipline, we need a high conviction. To have a high conviction, we need to do enough research and have a sufficient understanding of the assets we are buying.\n\nAs long as we understand that this company will thrive with a high probability, we will more likely to hold onto those positions even in a recession.\n\n**In order to beat the market as an individual investor, we need self-discipline. Self-discipline comes from a high conviction. High conviction comes from enough research and understanding of the security.**\n\n**Security Analysis leads to -&gt; High Conviction leads to -&gt; Self-discipline**\n\n**3) Security analysis doesn't require a rocket scientist. For instance, it's not hard to know e-commerce, EV, and cleantech will be the future.**\n\nI'm certainly not saying analyzing individual companies is easy but as an individual investor who lacks the resources and knowledge about a company, it's still possible to know that a company is a fundamentally strong business trading at a reasonable multiple.\n\nFor instance, Fiverr is an Israeli company that allows freelancers to offer their services on its platform. It has grown its sales at more than 40% annually with at least 75% gross margin. Would you expect this sort of company to continue growing in the next five to ten years or go bust?\n\nAnd yes it's trading at too high of a multiple, at 43x LTM P/S.\n\nBut think of it this way. If Fiverr grows its sales at 40%, 40%, 30%, 30%, and 30% in the next five years and has a 25% net margin, it'll have $175MM in net income after five years. With a trading multiple of 70 P/E you get $13B market cap in five years, compared to $6.8B market cap right now.\n\nYes, these are rosy assumptions but I don't need to convince people that a platform with freelancers will only grow in the future.\n\nMany also argue that you can\u2019t win in the market because there are too many big-money professionals and the person on the other side of the trade knows better than I do.\n\nI absolutely agree with that. But it's not a winner-takes-all game.\n\nThere doesn\u2019t have to be a single winner. Professional trader's win doesn't mean our loss.\n\nYou don\u2019t need those terminals and market data to predict that the stay at home stocks would have outperformed the value stocks since March.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to be a genius to know that China will be the next big player in the world or that Chinese companies are poised to outperform maybe some other foreign competitors.\n\nThe important aspect to remember is that the retail investors can easily come to the same conclusion as a professional analyst who has spent thousands of hours on research.\n\nThe key differences between the professionals and us is the amount of work the professionals put in and the vast amounts of resources they have, both of which lead to higher conviction (therefore, self-discipline) and informational advantage.\n\nThat\u2019s why people like Peter Lynch and Buffett likes to say invest in what you know.\n\nBy only dealing with what we are familiar with (easy-to-understand companies), we don\u2019t need to use CapIQ or Bloomberg to come to a high conviction that e-commerce will only grow in the future.\n\nIf however, we were to take a stab at a company like Exxon Mobil, we need to know how much of their production volumes are hedged, at what oil price are their rigs economical, how will commodity prices impact the stock performance (you need historical correlation data and regression for different time periods), and so on.\n\nTake bond futures. It\u2019s not that hard to know that as long as the Treasury is issuing more than the Fed is buying, there will be a supply overrun and yields will likely go up (of course it's not as simple as that because you need to take into account numerous other factors like inflation and real yields but I'm making a point here). But I only can monitor that from the numerous data points provided by the sell-side research.\n\nThe more complicated analyses are where professional investors have an edge.\n\n**To summarize today's post in one sentence, it is possible to beat the market with a small-sized portfolio given a sufficient amount of discipline.**\n\nPlease feel free to use this post as a starting off point when arguing with your friend about beating the market.\n\nCheck out [r/Midasinvestors](https://www.reddit.com/r/Midasinvestors/) for graphs.\n\nAlso, please feel free to check out our Youtube Channel called [Midasinvestors](https://youtu.be/j7eNeWi_rPE) for a more detailed explanation!\n\nHope everyone has a great rest of the weekend and thanks for reading!",

        "selftext": "[Carlyle-backed Packable agrees $1.55 billion SPAC merger](https://www.reuters.com/article/carlyle-group-packable-spac-idUSKBN2G50WA)\n\nPackable, a U.S. e-commerce firm backed by Carlyle Group Inc, said on Thursday it has agreed to merge with Highland Transcend Partners I Corp, a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC), in a deal that values the combined company at $1.55 billion.\n\nThe deal includes $180 million of private investment in public equity (PIPE) financing led by Fidelity Management &amp; Research Company, with participation from Lugard Road Capital, Luxor Capital, Park West Asset Management and Morningside.\n\nPackable, which operates third-party retailer Pharmapacks, was valued at about $1.1 billion when Carlyle invested $250 million to acquire its stake in November last year.\n\nFounded in 2010, it is one of the largest third-party retailers in the United States, selling mostly health and beauty products through large online marketplaces, including Amazon, eBay, Google, Walmart and Target. The Hauppauge, New York-based company generated $373 million in revenue in 2020 and expects that to reach $456 million this year.\n\n\u201cPackable will expand geographically, invest in founder-led brands, and add new verticals such as data science, marketing and media services,\u201d Packable Chief Executive Andrew Vagenas said in an interview.\n\nAs part of the merger deal, Packable\u2019s existing shareholders will receive 71% of the combined company, Highland Transcend SPAC founders and investors will own 19%, while PIPE investors get the remaining 11%.\n\nSPACs are shell companies that raise money from stock market listings with the purpose of merging with a private company and taking it public. The Highland Transcend SPAC had raised $300 million in its initial public offering in December last year, including the underwriters\u2019 option.\n\nHighland Transcend SPAC executives Ian Friedman and Dan Nova are expected to join Packable\u2019s board of directors after the deal closes.\n\n\u201cOur goal is to help the company expand further internationally, add new product categories such as shelf-stable food and pet,\u201d said Friedman, who is also chief executive of venture capital firm Highland Transcend \u200bPartners.\n\nPackable will be listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol \u201cPKBL.\u201d",

        "selftext": "I want to talk about the movement and how I see it being successful. The broader movement to make things fairer for retail investors. Retail investors banding together was the first and an important step in this journey. But I think some people act like that is the end of this journey and I think there is one thing to examine that shows this is just the start.   \nRobinhood made 959M in 2020 and Citadel represented a whopping 34% of that. Robinhood is projected to do $2B in revenue in 2021 so at the same pace $680M would be coming from Citadel. Now we must remember, payment for order flow is essentially a trade commission paid to Robinhood. Even if Citadel was paying Robinhood an astronomical commission of 10% that would still mean Citadel was making $6.8B off the trades from Robinhood. And that checks out Citadel made $6.7B in trading revenues alone in 2020. Chew on that for a second, that is just what they made on routing trades, that doesn\u2019t even include the profits they can make by speculating on those trades. And plenty can be made when you are routing the trades and know where the market is going.   \nSo what is my point here? I see a lot of talk of how much we are \u201churting\u201d short sellers. And I\u2019m not sure how realistically that \u201churt\u201d is when you look at the numbers. This doesn\u2019t mean AMC won\u2019t go high, as I\u2019ve pointed out there are a lot of buyers both on the institutional and retail side. And again, to be realistic, a lot of retail investors bailed when it hit 70 so we need a stronger showing on both the institutional / retail side on the next push up to get it higher. By most accounts the total accumulated losses on AMC shorts are $6B and that is just on holding the short positions. We don\u2019t know how much any shorters are making when AMC yo-yo\u2019s up and down AND let\u2019s keep in mind this is a huge bull market and any long positions in it are going to print money. The moral of this story, I think, is that I can already see this happening. If AMC doesn\u2019t reach the heights people want to go, they will point fingers at each other, say this or that or the other person wasn\u2019t committed enough. You were paper hands etc. But the much bigger problem is this system is currently putting a lot more money in the hands of hedge funds than it\u2019s taking away. We keep hearing that margin calls are going to happen but in my experience most margin calls happen when someone is surprised not when they have a long test of wills with long / short sellers. Hedge funds when given time know exactly how to diversify their risk and survive, probably even prosper. Keep in mind these numbers are JUST Robinhood. WeBull is growing and just as bad plus many of the other brokers that Citadel can profit off in big ways from routing payment for order flow.   \nI\u2019ve said this from the beginning: for this movement to succeed we must respect each other and each other\u2019s strategies and learn to trust each other and with understanding and as much unity as possible. There are most definitely shills saying AMC is overpriced as well as shills saying 100K because they are long and want to make sure they can exit at the best price and leave as many retailers holding the bag as possible. If you want a better system the last thing we should do is hate on each other for having different strategies, they want to divide us, they want to make sure we can\u2019t all band together and hold this power. We can\u2019t win this with one stock or two stocks. We can\u2019t win this by lying to ourselves and telling ourselves we have the upper hand when we don\u2019t. We can win this, in the short or long term, but we can\u2019t be foolish enough to think that our opponent can\u2019t adapt, doesn\u2019t have tricks in their pockets. We saw that with the trading halt.   \nIf you want to make things better, it isn\u2019t by bickering about what your fellow investors are doing that you need on your team if we have any chance to make this system better. It\u2019s by taking your money out of payment for order flow shops (especially Robinhood and WeBull) and putting them into a place like Fidelity.",

At this rate this stock will be on r/wallstreetbets watch list because it\u2019s market cap will soon be over a billion easily, without the hype and just plain valuation.\n\nThe Hard Data\n\nU/-Z1-\n\n# \"Yes, a Gamma squeeze can occur\"\n\n\\- Ihor Dusaniwsky of S3 Partners, clarifying his view on BBIG after his CNBC interview ([9/1/2021](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1433060509679591425?s=20))\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHello fellow short squeeze enthusiasts, hope you had restful weekends!I strongly believe that BBIG will have a huge move up sooner than the other short squeeze candidates. BBIG's situation has changed rapidly, and a lot has come to light.I wanted to share a data-based summary of some of the important factors I see leading it to an imminent move. No subjective TA, no baseless pumping, and no magical elliot waves:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Share Availability Crisis\n\n* Demand has soared for shares to borrow, prompting lenders to get more and more shares to loan out.  As short sellers have soaked up all that supply of shares available to loan, lenders have been struggling to find more shares to loan. BBIG has become a *very* \"hard to borrow\" stock.\n* Brokers are desperate to find shares to loan out, and the situation has gotten worse by the day. Fidelity started emailing BBIG holders, offering them huge rewards if they loan out their shares. About this, [Will Meade said](https://twitter.com/realwillmeade/status/1431310134316347397?s=20) \" if the biggest broker by assets does not have $BBIG shares no one does.\"\n* **Major share scarcity = extra demand = upward pressure on stock price.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Gamma Squeezes Incoming\n\n* The number of in-the-money call options expiring 9/17 has reached *100,000*! That's enormous for a float this small. It's up to 10 million shares that could be purchased, and this requires options sellers to buy up a ton of shares to hedge their positions. The week of 9/13 to 9/17 will see a lot of forced buying pressure!\n* Whales have been buying huge quantities of options lately, so that number is going to be much greater by then!\n* Next week will see some delta hedging too, especially if/when the stock price climbs to bring more options in-the-money.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Short Exempt Volume\n\n* BBIG has spent a lot of time with SSR in effect, yet shorts kept piling on, often in the form of short exempt volume. [Jason Polun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5nHDW4ajuw) dug up exactly how much this amounted to, and it's insane:\n   * 8/27 - 2.6 million\n   * 8/30 - 1.06 million\n   * 8/31 - 2.5 million\u26a0\ufe0f\n   * 9/1 - 8.4 million\u26a0\ufe0f\n   * 9/2 - 1.06 million\n   * 9/3 - 1.5 million\n* This type of shorting creates tons of FTDs, and prime brokers have 6 days to settle those (market makers get 12).\n* **Tuesday, 9/7** is when the largest number of these need to be settled by prime brokers.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Similar to AMC and SPRT just before their run-ups\n\n* AMC and SPRT had high utilization of borrowed shares and high short exempt volume just before they had their huge run-ups. That is exactly how BBIG is set up right now!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# No Share Offerings\n\n* Many squeezes are held back by new share offerings that put a damper on the momentum. That is not the case with BBIG. They stated that they do not want to raise more money, and they have held true to that, even in the midst of this rise in price.\n* The two SEC filings on Friday are ***not*** new offerings, and they are ***not*** any kind of new dilution (as bears would like you to believe). They are actually *amendments* to old warrant registrations that were registered a long time ago ([explanation with links here](https://www.reddit.com/r/BBIG/comments/phgszx/the_424b3_filings_nothing_to_worry_about_not_new/)).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Institutions Are Long\n\n* [Institutions started increasing their long positions](https://fintel.io/so/us/bbig) en masse back in March, and they have continued to raise their stakes. The vast majority of them are *long*.\n* *Why is this so important?* It means that most of the shorts are smaller sellers who are **much** more likely to be get squeezed as the price goes up. Among the squeeze candidates, BBIG is most likely to have a ***double*** squeeze (gamma squeeze and short squeeze).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# BBIG - Now the True Anatomy of a Meme Stock Squeeze\n\n* Meme stock run-ups have some elements in common - FOMO and sentiment increases price, shorts pile on, hedging their positions with OTM call options. Price rises further with pressure from many factors, causing delta hedging and FOMO, forcing options sellers to hedge even more. As this cycle continues, smaller short sellers feel pressure and some have to cover.\n* BBIG's near-100 Fintel short squeeze score, high option open interest, high call/put ratio, high short exempt volume, max utilization of loaned shares, high trading volume and bullish sentiment show that **BBIG is at the boiling point**.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you like more in-depth analysis, I think you will like Jason Polun's recent analysis of this BBIG situation: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5nHDW4ajuw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5nHDW4ajuw)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere are some graphics illustrating points made above:\n\n[Shares available to loan have rapidly increased, and short sellers take them all](https://preview.redd.it/qr09031eptl71.png?width=1692&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f3b8601d40990547bdf061650c8d78d622bab0f7)\n\n[Short Exempt Volume has led to a lot of FTDs](https://preview.redd.it/6chcfsd93ul71.png?width=1661&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=86d28c733d1e3d26dcc173872c8f378ddc5e5fb3)\n\n[Institutions have been piling in, and are mostly long](https://preview.redd.it/jdhsevhj3ul71.png?width=875&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=207ff1c760795c5329af9a3144c05a9e93562ff2)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nInvestor buys far OTM \u2b07\ufe0f\nhttps://mobile.twitter.com/rickyschrdr/status/1433144243284058112\n\nAnd for those who don't know...\nThreshold securities are stocks with more that 0.5% of its outstanding shares in Failures-to-deliver (FTDs) \n\nFTDs are a symptom of naked shorting, as well as institutions who fail to deliver in-the-money call options or lent shares that were recalled\n\n\nShort exempts are a special tool of market makers (MMs) to take a short while a stock is on Short-sale restriction (SSR) or to short without locating a share to borrow.\n\nThese exemptions are intended for MMs to survive periods of massive volatility and frenzy buying.\n\nHowever, recently some apes such as myself have identified that short exempts can and have been liberally abused to short stocks without requiring a locate, allowing MMs to drive massive downward pressure on stocks during SSR and to avoid borrowing while making the market.\n\nIn situations where MMs are short a stock, they can use exempts to take the other side of retail buy orders to satisfy the trade without having to find another seller. It is massively profitable for them because they can dictate the price on the spread while doing this.\n\nMeanwhile, short MMs can accumulate shares to borrow for later, allowing them to drive the price down during a sell off. Then, they buy back the stock at a discount and deliver on the FTDs created by all the short exempts they made. \n\nBut...\n\nWhat if the stock doesn't sell off???\n\nYou see, every short exempt that was taken without a borrow automatically becomes an FTD because technically it is a naked short. And MMs are only given 6 trading days to settle FTDs.\n\nIf they don't, they are forcefully restricted from shorting the stock, halting their trading.\n\nThis cuts massively into their profits, so MMs are forced into a prisoner's dilemma of buying back the shares they failed to locate in order to close the FTDs. \n\nThis would naturally go against their trading strategy because their net position is short on the stock they must buy.\n\nAdd on top of this, the market maker sold a massive number of call options on that stock which would run in the money, forcing them to delta hedge those positions... by buying more stock...\n\nMMs get around this problem and kick the can down the road for a while by borrowing more shares. This is possible because, according to RegSho, you can close FTDs by borrowing shares, but this only lasts so long because eventually these shares run dry as utilization rises to 100%\n\nOh but it gets worse for them...\n\nIf a stock is on the threshold list and stays there for more than 13 consecutive days...\n\nAt any time, regulators are able to force the closure of any existing short positions on that stock.\n\nThe MM is then forced to buy to cover their shorts...\n\nWhat followed was a pure gamma squeeze, rendering MMs helpless but to buy shares at such a rapid pace as to force the price to skyrocket past $59 by that Friday before a sell of saw it settle around $26.\n\nBut $SPRT isn't done because shorts still haven't covered.\n\nThere is a pattern that I identified where $SPRT had a huge run up leading to it's 21st day on the Threshold list (8/20), but it was rapidly shorted down just before that Friday in order to push expiring options out-the-money (OTM).\n\nThe following Monday however...was too much\n\nNow we come to $BBIG, which has been on threshold since 8/3, making this 24 days on the list as of Friday.\n\nWe saw yet another massive push to shove the price down and to try to shake out any paper hands. \n\nAgain, we saw an end-of-day rebound for $BBIG after shorts piled on.\n\nShorts are at over 300% losses on their positions, and now, once again, a massive portion of the float is ITM on the call options chain. Shit is about to go down...\n\nI'm not setting dates, I'm not a financial wizard, and I'm not a fortune teller. I'm just a computer geek that knows how to use a calculator. \n\nThe math is fucking clear.\n\nShorts are are in deep shit\nThey can't cover without buying\nThere are no shorts to borrow\n&amp; no shares to buy\n\nOn Sept 10th, $BBIG will be finalizing its proxy vote, per their CEO during their latest earnings call.\n\nThis proxy will finalize the long awaited merger that has been the catalyst driving $BBIG's price action.\n\nIn mere days, this catalyst will FINALLY be realized.",

        "selftext": " \n\nHello investors,\n\n[Part I Link](https://www.reddit.com/r/Midasinvestors/comments/otfytw/investing_psychology_part_i/) (recommended to read beforehand)\n\nFor those who are new, I wanted to share some of my thoughts regarding active vs passive investing.\n\nI think the topic for today's discussion is probably the single most important one for all of us, as the answer to the question would determine whether we should even trade in the markets at all.\n\nWhy would we ever trade individual stocks, commodities, or other assets if we can't actually \"beat the market\"? The market meaning the S&amp;P 500 index or the Dow for those based in the US.\n\nI know this will likely spark lots of criticism and intense discussions.\n\nTherefore, let me preface it with a few points first.\n\n\\- This is solely my personal opinion.\n\n\\- Your opinion is just as good as mine.\n\n\\- Full disclosure, I haven't worked as a portfolio manager at an institution so I certainly lack lots of experience in managing money compared to those who make a living out of managing pension or endowment money.\n\n\\- It's completely fine if you disagree. My goal is not to convince you but to help provide resources for people. The more you know the better.\n\n\\- I believe that an \"average person\" would be far better off investing in the market index, just as Warren Buffett said.\n\n\\- I agree with the academics, investors, and communities that most people shouldn't try to beat the market as most simply don't have enough time to analyze and monitor companies or have the discipline to stay invested in their ideas.\n\n\\- Investing is a game of probability, just like poker. This fund is \"more likely\" to beat the market means the fund has a high chance of beating the market, not \"will\" beat the market.\n\nIf you have a pair of aces in a poker game, you wouldn't necessarily win the pot but you have a \"high probability\" of winning the pot.\n\nPeople say poker is a game of luck but there are professional poker players who win over a period of time. I believe the same is true in investing. Not necessarily \"professionals\" but any investor can beat the market with the right amount of discipline and research.\n\n\\- Timing the bottom or top is impossible. But it is possible to guess the top or bottom with a probability. For instance, at the end of 2019, was it more likely that we were near the top of the market cycle or bottom? The answer is obvious.\n\nNow with all that said, I'll say the unpopular opinion.\n\nYes, we can \"beat the market\".\n\nMore specifically, I believe it is possible to beat the S&amp;P 500 net of fees even over a long period of time, say 20-30 years, for those with less than $50 million in the portfolio.\n\nHere are my arguments for today's topic.\n\n**1) It is possible to beat the market with a small portfolio as an individual investor.**\n\n**2)** **While it is possible to beat the market as an individual investor, two traits are essential for an investor to win. They are discipline and conviction.**\n\n**3) Security analysis doesn't require a rocket scientist. For instance, it's not hard to know e-commerce, EV, and cleantech will be the future.**\n\n**1) It is possible to beat the market with a small portfolio as an individual investor.**\n\nBut beating the market isn't enough. You have to consistently beat it, for 5 years, 10 years, and 30 years.\n\nI'm sure most of you know that a 1% difference in the 30-year annual return can make a huge difference at the end of the 30-year period due to compounding.\n\nWhat most probably don't know is the distribution of those returns from a portfolio point of view.\n\nIf you make an annual rate of 15% return over the course of 30 years, that doesn't mean you need to make 15% of return every single year in practical terms.\n\nWhat's happening is that over the course of 30 years, you will make 200% returns, 100% returns 60% returns in the early part of the 30 years, and then slowly decline to 5% annual returns, which altogether make 15% annual return over the course of 30 years.\n\nTheoretically, any investor's portfolio will look something along the lines of this over a time period.\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\nThe total compounded annual return is 15%, not the actual annual returns.\n\nThis makes sense because, with a $50k portfolio, you will obviously be more concentrated in positions compared to a $50MM portfolio. Therefore, you are taking more \"risk\" in a smaller portfolio.\n\nSimilarly, Berkshire Hathaway, the conglomerate run by Warren Buffett, has posted annual returns that look somewhat similar.\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\nIf you noticed, the standard deviations are much larger in the earlier part of the years compared to the latter part of the years when the portfolio simply got too big to take that much risk.\n\nIn fact, the standard deviation of the returns for the first 20 years is 42% compared to 16% in the last 20 years.\n\n**Where I'm getting at is it is much easier to beat the market by a wide margin with a small-sized portfolio than a large portfolio and therefore, retail investors have a good chance of beating the market, given an appropriate knowledge and discipline.**\n\nIt may be common-sense but to reiterate, it is much easier to double a portfolio of $500k than to double a $50 million.\n\nYou may think the reason is that you're taking larger risks on smaller portfolios than larger portfolios.\n\nIt is true that risks are larger. However, it also depends on how you define \"risk\".\n\nStandard deviations are obviously larger in a smaller portfolio since your absolute size is smaller and therefore, you can't diversify as much.\n\nBut standard deviations aren't truly the \"risk\" of a company going under. The true risk of a company going bankrupt is the liquidity, cash flow, and business profile. Even with a concentrated portfolio, I believe it's possible to get large returns with limited \"risks\" as retail investors.\n\nNow, to reduce those idiosyncratic \"risks\" of businesses, we need to apply our \"knowledge\" and \"discipline\".\n\nWhich brings to my second argument.\n\n**2)** **While it is possible to beat the market as an individual investor, two traits are essential for an investor to win. They are discipline and conviction.**\n\nMost people will sell at lows and buy at highs. We sell at lows because once a stock goes down, our cognitive bias kicks in, called the loss aversion bias. We put more weight on losing $100 than gaining $100 and thus, losing money has more impact on us than gaining money.\n\nThis is due to evolutionary psychology and there's a good reason why we were evolved this way but that's a topic of conversation for another day.\n\nWe also buy at highs because we tend to follow the herd, getting into the hype of trends and manias. Fear of missing out (FOMO) is a strong incentive for people to get in on the EV hype.\n\nPeople at cocktail parties will brag about their 4x returns on bitcoin or Tesla, which will prompt you to buy them the next day.\n\nBuying at highs and selling at lows are due to a lack of discipline, as the famous investors put it.\n\nThis is also the reason why professionals say \"invest in what you know\". If you invest in what you don't know, then you will be tempted to sell when stocks go down because you don't know the company and don't have such a high conviction that it will recover.\n\nAs an analogy, I have seen many people make new year's resolutions as losing weight or saving more money to buy a house.\n\nWhy is it so hard to do both?\n\nIn fact, all of us actually know how to lose weight: eat less and exercise more. Burn more calories than you consume. It's as simple as that.\n\nWe also know how to increase the balance on our bank account. Spend less than what you earn, or increase your earnings through side-gigs.\n\nIt doesn't take a genius to figure out the solutions to these problems. I believe the same is true for the markets. People generally know which companies will be better off in ten years (Disney, Amazon, JP Morgan, etc.).\n\nSo why do people lack the discipline to stick to their plans?\n\nAgain, there's a good evolutionary reason which I won't get into in this post.\n\nIf Amazon fell 30% today and stayed there fore the next month or two while other EV companies rose 50% in the same time period, most people would be tempted to sell their Amazon and buy those EV companies, hence the \"sell low buy high\" phenomenon.\n\nTake this analysis shown on WSJ.\n\n**The returns of a hypothetical investor who put $10,000 into an S&amp;P 500 index fund at the start of 1980 and missed the market\u2019s five best days through the end of August 2020 would be 38 percentage points lower than those of someone who stayed invested the whole period, according to a Fidelity Investments Inc. analysis.**\n\nThis is the significance of self-discipline, the ability to weather through the tough times, or carefully ride the trends.\n\nTo gain self-discipline, we need a high conviction. To have a high conviction, we need to do enough research and have a sufficient understanding of the assets we are buying.\n\nAs long as we understand that this company will thrive with a high probability, we will more likely to hold onto those positions even in a recession.\n\n**In order to beat the market as an individual investor, we need self-discipline. Self-discipline comes from a high conviction. High conviction comes from enough research and understanding of the security.**\n\n**Security Analysis leads to -&gt; High Conviction leads to -&gt; Self-discipline**\n\n**3) Security analysis doesn't require a rocket scientist. For instance, it's not hard to know e-commerce, EV, and cleantech will be the future.**\n\nI'm certainly not saying analyzing individual companies is easy but as an individual investor who lacks the resources and knowledge about a company, it's still possible to know that a company is a fundamentally strong business trading at a reasonable multiple.\n\nFor instance, Fiverr is an Israeli company that allows freelancers to offer their services on its platform. It has grown its sales at more than 40% annually with at least 75% gross margin. Would you expect this sort of company to continue growing in the next five to ten years or go bust?\n\nAnd yes it's trading at too high of a multiple, at 43x LTM P/S.\n\nBut think of it this way. If Fiverr grows its sales at 40%, 40%, 30%, 30%, and 30% in the next five years and has a 25% net margin, it'll have $175MM in net income after five years. With a trading multiple of 70 P/E you get $13B market cap in five years, compared to $6.8B market cap right now.\n\nYes, these are rosy assumptions but I don't need to convince people that a platform with freelancers will only grow in the future.\n\nMany also argue that you can\u2019t win in the market because there are too many big-money professionals and the person on the other side of the trade knows better than I do.\n\nI absolutely agree with that. But it's not a winner-takes-all game.\n\nThere doesn\u2019t have to be a single winner. Professional trader's win doesn't mean our loss.\n\nYou don\u2019t need those terminals and market data to predict that the stay at home stocks would have outperformed the value stocks since March.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to be a genius to know that China will be the next big player in the world or that Chinese companies are poised to outperform maybe some other foreign competitors.\n\nThe important aspect to remember is that the retail investors can easily come to the same conclusion as a professional analyst who has spent thousands of hours on research.\n\nThe key differences between the professionals and us is the amount of work the professionals put in and the vast amounts of resources they have, both of which lead to higher conviction (therefore, self-discipline) and informational advantage.\n\nThat\u2019s why people like Peter Lynch and Buffett likes to say invest in what you know.\n\nBy only dealing with what we are familiar with (easy-to-understand companies), we don\u2019t need to use CapIQ or Bloomberg to come to a high conviction that e-commerce will only grow in the future.\n\nIf however, we were to take a stab at a company like Exxon Mobil, we need to know how much of their production volumes are hedged, at what oil price are their rigs economical, how will commodity prices impact the stock performance (you need historical correlation data and regression for different time periods), and so on.\n\nTake bond futures. It\u2019s not that hard to know that as long as the Treasury is issuing more than the Fed is buying, there will be a supply overrun and yields will likely go up (of course it's not as simple as that because you need to take into account numerous other factors like inflation and real yields but I'm making a point here). But I only can monitor that from the numerous data points provided by the sell-side research.\n\nThe more complicated analyses are where professional investors have an edge.\n\n**To summarize today's post in one sentence, it is possible to beat the market with a small-sized portfolio given a sufficient amount of discipline.**\n\nPlease feel free to use this post as a starting off point when arguing with your friend about beating the market.\n\nCheck out r/Midasinvestors for graphs.\n\nAlso, please feel free to check out our Youtube Channel called [Midasinvestors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ad89G90NUzQ) for a more detailed explanation!\n\nHope everyone has a great rest of the weekend and thanks for reading!",

        "selftext": "TOM SIEBEL: Well I think we're right on track with what we communicated when we took the company public. So far, we've exceeded expectations every quarter. We're on the growth trajectory that we projected. We have become the world's leading provider of enterprise AI applications.\n\nWe just formed a very, very strategic relationship with Google Cloud where the almost 4,000-strong sales person organization at Google Cloud will be selling all of our applications globally, so that dramatically increases our sales capacity, say, by a couple of orders of magnitude.\n\nAnd I think the company's right on track, and you know, I don't really watch the stock price day to day. That's not my job. I think, as far as I'm concerned, we have $1 billion cash in the bank. We have enough money to do what we need to do. The market can just close for five years, and I think if it opens, then all the shareholders will be happy.\n\n- Some strong words. I was going to ask you about the stock move. I know you don't like to comment on it, but we are seeing it under some pressure today, so I just wonder what you think investors are missing in terms of the growth story that C3 AI is on right now.\n\nTOM SIEBEL: Well, let's think about this. We deliver 40 turnkey enterprise AI applications a day, for banking, for manufacturing, for oil and gas, financial services, telecommunications, and manufacturing. Google Cloud decided they wanted-- these are very, very high value applications, where these companies are realizing billions of dollars a year annual economic benefit from these apps.\n\nNow, the Google Cloud decided that they wanted to change the competitive dynamics of the hyperscaler market, and lead with turnkey enterprise applications rather than CPU seconds and storage as they compete against the other hyperscalers.\n\nIt's a new think about this in terms of, maybe they needed to approach a partner who had a portfolio of applications like that. How many doors are there to knock on in the world? There's virtually only one. We're the only company in this business. We're the only pure play in enterprise application software in the world, in applications, other than, say, toys. Like, toys would be storage, or toys would be virtualization, or toys would be a machine learning library. We don't deliver toys, we deliver applications.\n\nSo we're the only company in this game. This is a-- probably a $300 to $400 billion addressable market, and I think we're going about establishing a market leadership position in that space, and that's the big picture. And I think we have three, four, five, ten years to execute that strategy. If we execute it, this will be one of the great technology companies in the world.\n\n- Yeah, let's use that five year frame here, then. Because you know, I felt like when we were at the IPO stage, right? When was that? A year ago, more than a year ago, right? When we're looking at the growth rate, right? And you came on, and you were kind of honest about, we're not going to run 75% growth all the time. It's going to moderate a little bit, and we've seen that now in terms of, kind of, subscription revenue here up 29%, total revenue up 29% year over year.\n\nI mean, when you look at that five year time frame, and position it where the stock's trading now, I mean, what is it that you would tell investors about where you'll be in five years if all the things pan out? The Google Cloud partnership, and also the government contracts that it sounded like analysts might not have been projecting quite correctly.\n\nTOM SIEBEL: Well, I think, you know, again, whatever the stock did this morning is, you know, it'll do what it does. And the 29% growth rate will put us in the top decile, certainly, of high growth companies in enterprise application software. The analysts' predictions are that our growth rate will accelerate in the coming years.\n\nAnd I think the company is right on track. It's all good. I think we're very pleased. We're pleased with our Microsoft partnership, our Google partnership, our Baker Hughes partnership, FIS partnership. This company is right on track, and I'm quite pleased with the results.\n\n- You've got a pretty broad footprint right now across sectors, whether that's in manufacturing or financials. A long list here in terms of your research on enterprise AI. Where are you seeing the biggest growth right now? What are you most excited about?\n\nTOM SIEBEL: I think in the long run-- so today, we're huge in energy, oil and gas-- excuse me, energy efficiency, telecommunications, manufacturing, aerospace, defense, intelligence. In the long run, I'm personally most excited about precision health. Precision health will be the largest commercial application of AI, where we will be able to do very precise disease prediction, and therefore be able to intervene clinically and avoid the diagnosis.\n\nWe'll have AI-assisted medicine, genome specific medical protocols. I think the economic and social benefits that will accrue from applying AI to precision health are going to be really staggering. This will-- people will live longer, they will be healthier, we will deliver health care at lower cost, and we will do it-- we'll deliver-- using devices like this, we will be delivering health care to a massively large, previously underserved communities.\n\nSQUEEEEZE!

        "selftext": "As you may know, Canada already has Bitcoin ETFs and Europe has Bitcoin ETPs, but the United-States is still behind on that matter.\n\nThey already have the Chicago Mercantile Exchange(CME) Bitcoin futures and Grayscale's Bitcoin Trust Fund (GBTC). The first one isn't great for the small retail investor because of its nature and GBTC is an OTC product with a high yearly fee of 2.5%.\n\nOver the years, a lot of companies tried to make a case for a Bitcoin-backed ETF so retail investors could have an exposure to the asset in a safe and regulated environment. However, the SEC has constantly been reluctant in the acceptance of any Bitcoin ETF product, despite the legitimacy of the companies behind them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn August 3rd 2021, the chairman of the SEC Gary Gensler posted remarks about cryptocurrencies. ([https://www.sec.gov/news/public-statement/gensler-aspen-security-forum-2021-08-03](https://www.sec.gov/news/public-statement/gensler-aspen-security-forum-2021-08-03)) \n\nHere are the interesting ones :  \n(1) '' Nakamoto had solved two riddles that had dogged these cryptographers and other technology experts for a couple of decades: first, how to move something of value on the internet without a central intermediary; and relatedly, how to prevent the \u201cdouble-spending\u201d of that valuable digital token. ''\n\n(2) '' Before starting at the SEC, I had the honor of researching, writing, and teaching about the intersection of finance and technology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. This included courses on crypto finance, blockchain technology, and money. ''\n\n(3) '' Next, I want to turn to investment vehicles providing exposure to crypto assets. Such investment vehicles already exist, with the largest among them having been around for eight years and worth more than $20 billion.[\\[13\\]](https://www.sec.gov/news/public-statement/gensler-aspen-security-forum-2021-08-03#_ftn13) Also, there are a number of mutual funds that invest in Bitcoin futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME).\n\nI anticipate that there will be filings with regard to exchange-traded funds (ETFs) under the Investment Company Act (\u201940 Act). When combined with the other federal securities laws, the \u201940 Act provides significant investor protections.\n\nGiven these important protections, I look forward to the staff\u2019s review of such filings, particularly if those are limited to these CME-traded Bitcoin futures.''\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBefore these remarks, Bitcoin ETF applicants were focusing on a spot-based product under the '33 Act, where the fund would have held Bitcoin for its clients. Gensler indicates that he would be more comfortable in the approval of such a product only if they were futures-based under the '40 Act, especially if it used the CME product.\n\nThe very next day, on August 5th, Invesco made a SEC filling for this exact product. ([https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1418144/000119312521236682/d209327d485apos.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1418144/000119312521236682/d209327d485apos.htm)) with the intent to become effective 75 days later, which would lead to October 19th 2021. It is up to the SEC to decide if it is appropriate.\n\nBut these companies are doing than just fillings. On September 8th, Fidelity Investments met with 16 SEC staff to present them a new trust fund that would hold CME Bitcoin Futures contract. [https://www.sec.gov/comments/sr-cboebzx-2021-039/srcboebzx2021039-250110.pdf](https://www.sec.gov/comments/sr-cboebzx-2021-039/srcboebzx2021039-250110.pdf) , but this product is filled under '33 Act so its odds are definitely less.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The spawn of a Bitcoin ETF in the United-States seems to be approaching. While the retail adoption of this product is uncertain, a direct SEC approval would be the first of a kind for the crypto asset class in the US. This moment has been highly anticipated since the Winklevoss twins tried to push for their ETF back in 2014.**",

This post contains no technical analysis, no charts, no p/e, or any of that sort so if you\u2019re that kinda guy this may not be for you, just basic fundamentals and why I think this stock is gonna be many multiples of its current price in eoy, and in 1-5 years time.\n\nSo Comstock Mining is a, mining company located in Nevada in the famous Comstock Lode. They are currently not operating any mine. They did back in 2012-2016 but ultimately it didn\u2019t prove to be worth it due to low gold prices and high costs.\n\n  \n\nSo what are they doing? Lets start with MCU.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  \n\n**MCU ( Mercury clean up )** \n\nArtisanal and small scale miners still use mercury in huge amounts, because its cost effective to them. Problem is, it is hugely toxic and doesn\u2019t break down on its own. What MCU does is take the dirty soils out of the ground and cleanses them, capturing any mercury and gold left in that soil. The systems are mobile, so when they are done with one project, they can simply ship the unit to the next. Costs are ridiculously good for a mine project, each system and its workers, peripherals etc costs roughly 3m$, they don\u2019t require decade long permits to start a project, unlike normal mines. Comstock currently is operating its very 1st project in the Philippines. There are 2 systems total, one ( project system) in the Comstock Lode, Nevada and one in the Philippines. The Comstock system does only about 25ton/ per hour max, as it is a purely ment to prove this technology. The one in the Philippines does 150 ton/hour, so it is much much faster.\n\nThey also clean up the sand and gravel which then can be sold. They have stated many times, that they can be net positive with only sand and gravel, with no gold. But they have seen gold grades ranging between 1g/ton to 7g/ton in the Philippines. The plan is to have more systems along the Naboc river in the Philippines, from 3 to 4 systems more is something they have said. So imagine a ONE system being able to generate 1m a month ( a figure they have said in calls, being very conservative and that\u2019s with NO GOLD!) the potential here is tremendous.\n\nPhillipines project is estimated to last anywhere from 5 to 9 years, so very long projects.\n\nThey have also been in talks with the government and many more countries. It is a worldwide problem really and they are in UNIQUE position as no one else has this kind of technology.\n\nLODE owns 25% of MCU and 62,5% of the Philippines project.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  \n\n**LiNiCo \u2013 Lithium recycling**\n\nIn February 2021 Comstock announced the acquisition of 64% of LiNiCo. Linico owns a lithium ion battery recycling plant in Nevada ( ex aqua metals plant), near teslas Gigafactory. It is capaple of recycling a 100.000 tons per annum when in full production, making it the BIGGEST recycling plant in America. They are already taking pre-orders for start up in the 2nd Quarter 2022. Below are the guidance numbers, remember, LODE owns 64%. And those numbers are from produced black mass ALONE. LiNiCo has a 20% stake in Singapore based Green Li-ion which produces 99,99% pure cathodes from the black mass, it is highly more valuable than black mass alone, no numbers given on that as far as I know. They can also produce pure lithium out of the black mass, something no one else is capable of.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5fpt47v4pfl71.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a1c9d5a0124760945f4ebd85e9f851ad7f7b171f\n\nJust to give some context on LiNiCo\u2019s competition: ABML \u2013 Worth over 1 billion, hasn\u2019t even started building their plant yet. Li-Cycle 1.3B, LiNiCo will produce much more than they do. Redwood is private. Based on just that LiNiCo is very undervalued, the transaction was valued at 17m$ for LODE. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  \n\n**Renewable process solutions ( RPS )**\n\n[**https://www.comstockmining.com/press-releases/comstock-acquires-renewable-process-solutions/**](https://www.comstockmining.com/press-releases/comstock-acquires-renewable-process-solutions/)\n\nThis one ties this together in my opinion. RPS is an engineering, procurement company. It has built 21 renewable fuel production facilities since 2006. LODE originally quoted an state of the art german manufacturer to build LiNiCo\u2019s crushing, separating machines for LIB recycling, costing over 9m\u20ac with long waiting times, RPS came to picture, engineered better machines for less than a 5m$ with much less lead time. They also made technological breakthroughs as LiNiCo\u2019s original capacity was quoted to be 20.000 tons per annum, they\u2019ve now upgraded it to 100k. So LODE now has IN HOUSE engineering capability, reducing costs dramatically. I believe we are gonna hear from RPS in every line of their business. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  \n\n**Hemp &amp; Lakeview Energy** \n\n**https://www.comstockmining.com/press-releases/comstock-forms-joint-venture-with-lakeview-energy/**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3nywbni9pfl71.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7eebdc54d5316950a6225cd46aaa7dfd784a3590\n\nTheir newest acquisition. Just gonna quote what is said in that pr, since this is so new, nothing else is known. \n\nComstock Mining Inc. (NYSE: LODE) (\u201cComstock\u201d and the \u201cCompany\u201d) today announced the execution of a series of agreements with Lakeview Energy LLC (\u201cLakeview\u201d) and its subsidiaries, pursuant to which the Company acquired 50% of the equity of Lakeview\u2019s subsidiary, LP Biosciences LLC (\u201cLPB\u201d), and agreed to provide the financing needed to retrofit LPB\u2019s pre-existing industrial scale solvent extraction and valorization facility in Merrill, Iowa (\u201cLPB Facility\u201d), for the production of an array of wholesale products from up to 200,000 pounds per day of industrial hemp. ( RPS is bidding on the construction, fitting of these machines ) \n\n**Industry Leading Scale, Quality, Compliance, and Flexibility**\n\nComstock\u2019s Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Corrado DeGasperis, added: \u201cWe are proud to have assembled a world class asset with a team of industry veterans, process engineers, and partners to rapidly retrofit and commence operations with the LPB Facility, thereby setting a global standard for quality, compliance, consistency, flexibility and speed at an extraordinary scale. Once retrofits are complete in mid-2022, the LPB Facility will generate significant free cash flow by servicing the most astute, demanding, and rapidly growing buyers of wholesale hemp products with custom tailored solutions.\u201d\n\nThe LPB Facility is conservatively expected to scale up to its initial nameplate capacity exceeding 200,000 pounds per day and 36,500 tons per year of industrial hemp over its first three years of operations, as it extracts, remediates, and refines oil from industrial hemp to generate annualized revenues exceeding $53,000,000, $154,000,000, and $409,000,000 per year during LPB\u2019s first, second, and third full years of operations, respectively, as shown in the following excerpt from LPB\u2019s internal projections:\n\n**Quantum Computing**\n\n**https://www.comstockmining.com/latest-developments/comstock-invests-15000000-in-initial-seed-round-for-quantum-computing-to-accelerate-material-science-discovery-and-development/**\n\nThis is one big mystery yet, not much is know. I think this is a statement how serious they are in their line of businesses, especially in recycling. They are not just recycling, I think they are innovating. They(GenMat) are in Stealth mode. Direct Wikipedia quote \u201c In business, **stealth mode** is a company's temporary state of secretiveness, usually undertaken to avoid alerting competitors to a pending product launch or another business initiative\u201d\n\nQuote from PR:\n\n\u201c\u201cQuantum computing has the profound potential to resolve urgent challenges of our time, such as global resource scarcity and climate change,\u201d said Corrado De Gasperis, Comstock\u2019s Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. \u201cWe have been working for some time on the frontier of new materials development with GenMat\u2019s world-class team and network of quantum computing professionals and material scientists. We believe that their work will make many positive and disruptive contributions, especially in our existing and planned industries. We are honored to participate and provide funding and commercialization support to such an exceptional and growing team of transformational professionals.\u201d\n\nWhile GenMat\u2019s intended offerings will be industry agnostic when it emerges from stealth mode, Comstock is laser focused on applications that accelerate the development of new clean technologies to address resource scarcity by facilitating climate smart mining, electrification, and decarbonization. Consequently, in addition to its investment, Comstock also secured exclusive rights to use GenMat\u2019s quantum technologies to complement and enhance its existing operations and planned technological and new business developments\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  \n\nUpcoming catalysts\n\nThere is just so much going on that this could go on pages, but I stop here and add some near/mid term catalysts.\n\n\\- them announcing MCU revenue and guidance ( they started in early march, had bad weather, floods, had to reposition few times, 5 weeks delay on some permit oversight) I think its coming soon, they stated they wanted to wait 3 to 4 months before announcing anything, it could be soon.\n\n\\- Dayton SK-1300 release. So I didn\u2019t talk anything about their Dayton resource because I think its not going to be their core business frankly. SK-1300 is a mineral estimate report, It was stated to be released in mid 2021 so it could be any day. They did a magnetic survey of their Dayton/spring valley area and are updating the results soon. I believe this could be a significant catalyst.\n\n\\- Them announcing partners with linico. I 100% believe there is going to be partnership with tesla. They need the battery materials badly, they are literally almost next to each other. Both of them talk about closed loop system, which only makes sense really.\n\n\\- Selling of non mining assets. LODE owns a silver springs property that has been on sale for quite some time, almost 3 years. Delayed atleast a dozen times, the transaction is supposed to go through soon, netting them 13m$.\n\n\\- They have partnership with Tonogold (TNGL) tono pays them monthly interest and big reimbursement next march worth 7m$.\n\n\\- LODE owns roughly 9 million of tono stock ( TNGL 0,13$ per share atm ) \n\n\\- they are under an NDA, Corrado said in Q2 call that we\u2019ll get \u201cClarity\u201d in September/ October time so soon.\n\nIf you got interested PLEASE watch their latest Q2/Q1/annual meeting videos, highly informative and im sure I missed a lot. They have deep joint venture with Tonogold which I didn\u2019t talk about much coz I think its stil long way off. But they own BIG royalties on one of the most richest places on the Comstock lode. Videos tell more on that.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-312zsm6nf4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-312zsm6nf4)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIQZssNbbJU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIQZssNbbJU)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sE9YNJbRmhM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sE9YNJbRmhM)\n\nnot long videos. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCheers. My 1st post and \"DD\" so thats that. I held this through 2019 RS, current position is 12 000 shares with 0,8 avg. I truly believe there is dividends in the future if things go as planned. Not selling anytime soon.",

        "selftext": "Hey all - wanted to get your advice. Hoping some of you on this sub have had similar experiences or can point me to a good resource. \n\nI am a US citizen that's moving to Canada for the first time in the next \\~6 months to be with my wife. \n\nI trade / invest in U.S. public equities and options on a U.S. based platform (i.e., TD and Fidelity). A majority of my annual income is from doing this. \n\nI noticed Canada's rules on income vs. capital gains. For example, if the CRA characterizes a Canadian as a \"day trader\", then 100% of your profits are considered income. If the CRA characterizes a Canadian as an \"investor\", then 50% of your capital gains are taxable. \n\nRules in the U.S. are obviously VERY different (short-term capital gains vs. long-term capital gains are hold dependent, and Trader Tax Status has significant benefits).  \n\nA few questions:\n\n1. As a U.S. citizen who will become a Canadian green card holder (eventually), what are the best practices re: taxes for trading U.S. equities / options? \n2. Can I continue trading in my TD/Fidelity accounts? Would forming a US LLC and trading out of that be more helpful for taxes?\n3. Any pitfalls to watch out for?\n\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated! I spent a few hours on Google but my scenario doesn't seem to be covered very well. Thanks in advance.",

        "selftext": "So my question is this, I just sold some stock I have with Fidelity and have xxxx available cash to trade and $0 settled cash. I tried to place an option call 2 weeks from now and I got a good faith violation warning, (my first ever warning and I have not placed the call yet) I'm just wondering how this applies towards an option trade. I know it's technically borrowed cash from Fidelity until the transaction goes through, but being that it's an option trade and the stock in play is pretty volatile, does that mean in the event the call drops below the amount I bought them for, could I possibly get margin called for not having enough money to cover the cash that hasn't settled yet? May be a dumb question but I've been trading for a few years now and maybe I'm just stoned to hell thinking too much lmao",

        "selftext": "**For anyone trading these high redemption, low float deSPAC plays, the gravy train can last for a few weeks until PIPE shares hit the market.  What are PIPEs?  Read up below:**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xmpbvpzrf6o71.png?width=650&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=22196c27f38a839b2324ac2ad85cd5f50d141f46\n\n**WHAT ARE PIPES?**\n\n* PIPEs are Private Investments in Public Equity. PIPEs were a recent innovation in SPACs that allowed\n   * A) sponsors to raise more capital outside of the dilutive sponsor promote,\n   * B) provide a buffer to meet deal minimum cash conditions and\n   * C) most importantly enable the separation of shareholder vote from redemption feature by addressing the minimum cash condition.\n* Those last two points TRANSFORMED the SPAC market in that redemption-led vote failures became a thing of the past (a regular occurrence back in the day).\n* By utilizing PIPEs, sponsors were able to raise enough capital for the target and give SPAC IPO investors the ability to vote for a deal while also redeeming their shares for $10 + interest.\n* PIPE investors used to consist primarily of capital markets / direct investing / arbitrage desks of hedge funds. The goal of these funds were to make some reasonable return with the lowest possible risk.\n* These investors may have demanded a discount to the $10 trust price, warrant coverage, convertible security, etc. These guys were not looking to take a fundamental bet on the company but were purely facilitators of capital.\n   * BTW we are seeing a return of sweeteners for PIPE investors. Some examples: ENFA / Buzzfeed (convertible notes), SVOK / Boxed (convertible notes), SRAC / Momentus (1 stock + 1 full warrant)\n* Valuation of course did matter and PIPE investors helped provide a feedback mechanism of what was overvalued (I'M PASSING ON THIS!) and what was reasonable (OK, I'LL TAKE A PIECE OF THIS DOWN).\n\n**HOW HAVE PIPES CHANGED?**\n\n* In earlier years the quality of sponsors and targets was spotty to say the least, however that started to change in 2020 as SPACs started becoming a more mainstream product attracting higher quality sponsors and targets. As a result of this, the structure and composition of PIPEs started to change.\n* Higher quality, longer-term \"sticky\" money like Fidelity and Blackrock along with strategic investors started to participate in PIPEs.\n* PIPE pricing also shifted from discounts/warrants/structured securities towards straight equity of $10 or even at a premium like $CCIV/$LCID or $RSVA/$ENVX.\n\n**SO HOW DO THEY MAKE / LOSE MONEY?**\n\n* But hey these PIPE guys are making a lot of money RIGHT?!  In good times and/or when they select the right deals, PIPE can be very lucrative.  However, there is no free lunch for PIPE investors. While they do benefit from being \"brought over the wall\" to diligence potential SPAC targets before they are known to the public (a good source of those pesky leaks) and help set the valuation--as we've all seen, deals can and do fall below $10 at merger close.\n* Once a PIPE investor makes a commitment to participate in a deal, they are LOCKED and LOADED. That hot electric vehicle company they thought would MEME but on close cratered? At deal close they have to wire the funds they committed and now they're looking at big losses.\n   * \\*Sometimes PIPE holders try to back out causing litigation like TMC - $220M of $330M PIPE investors decided to give the company a middle finger and walk away\n* This may be fine for longer term or strategic PIPE investors, but for fast money hedge funds they will move quickly to cut losses. Hedge funds will look to short stock when allowed by the subscription agreement to \"box\" their long position and limit downside.\n* When can hedge funds short against long PIPE shares? Check the subscription agreement filed (8-K) at the time of deal announcement.\n   * It'll either explicitly state that PIPE investors can't short stock until deal close (most deals) or won't say anything which means PIPE investors CAN short stock anytime (e.g., $DMYD, $IPOE).\n   * There are also hybrid structures out there like $MUDS (Rest In Peace) where PIPE holders could short up to 50% of their holdings prior to deal close if $MUDS is above $15.\n* Back when SPACs were all working, these hedge funds may have let positions \"run\" and not hedged their positions. However given the recent market environment they're much more aggressive in locking in profits / mitigating losses.\n   * Another wrinkle to this dynamic is that many SPACs have experienced high redemptions, which means there is no borrow to hedge against, which means further potential selling pressure once the PIPE shares are freely tradable (see below)\n* When a deal closes and nears or breaks $10, perversely it forces the hedge funds to short causing more downward pressure. For the smart investor (such as you), you can take advantage of this technical selling to get into selective situations for cheaply.\n\n**DeSPAC DEGENS READ THIS CLOSELY:**\n\n* PIPE LOCKUP? For a vast majority of PIPEs, there are no lockups. Folks everywhere like talking about \"PIPE unlocks\", but what they are really referring to is when a PIPE is registered, effective and freely tradable. However, every deal is bespoke and some do include a rare lockup like $CCIV/$LCID. \n* Typically, PIPE investors are only limited in selling their physical shares because they have to be registered via S-1 process. \n   * The S-1 process usually goes like this: \n      * 1) Post deal close initial S-1 is filed\n      * 2) A few weeks later an amended S-1/A is filed \n      * 3) Finally a 1-1.5 weeks later you'll see a 424B and EFFECT filed showing that the registration is effective and holders can sell\n   * There may be a few amendments or sometimes the S-1 goes straight to being effective without any SEC comments.  The whole S-1 process usually takes 45-60 days post closing.\n\n**WHAT EFFECT DOES PIPE HEDGING HAVE?**\n\n* One silver lining to the hedge funds shorting shares to box their long PIPE position - there won't be as much selling pressure from them once the S-1 goes effective because they're already \"flat\" and will close out their short position by collapsing w/ registered PIPE shares.\n   * But remember, low-float SPACs have little or very unstable borrow which deters shorting to box PIPE shares\n* Shorting prior to the S-1 going effective is not without risk. Borrow can get really tight leading to increasingly expensive cost and risk of recall. Just ask the guys that were short NKLA with unstable stock and covered at +$90 - yeesh. This is why many PIPE investors will seek stable \"term borrow\" and pay annualized rates of 10-30%.\n\n**IN CONCLUSION:**\n\n* PIPE investors are not all committed long-term investors, but they play a critical role in the capital raising function and valuation setting for SPACs. While it may not seem like they are on your side, they are more aligned with you than the sponsors!\n* PIPE investor's role as a price discovery mechanism is part of the reason why we've seen a trickle of deals now, but those that are getting done are at more reasonable valuations.\n\n**REREAD THIS - PIPE SHARES WILL COMING:**\n\n* And to drive this point home, if you are playing high redemption, low-float deSPAC plays, don't overstay your welcome.  Once you see the S-1 filed, the days of low float will soon be over after the PIPE shares go through the registration process and the BAG PIPE HOLDERS can finally sell.",

From the announcement today:\n\n&gt;Following  the closing of its acquisition on August 31, 2021  by affiliates of  Blackstone Infrastructure Partners, Blackstone Real  Estate Income  Trust, Inc. and Blackstone Property Partners, QTS Realty  Trust (\"QTS\")  announced that holders of its 6.50% Series A Cumulative  Convertible  Perpetual Preferred Limited Liability Company Units (the  \"New Series A  Preferred Units\") will have the right, until the close of  business on  October 14, 2021, to convert each New Series A Preferred Unit into  $172.84 in cash. Thereafter, holders of New Series A Preferred Units  will have the right to convert each unit into $167.40  in cash. At the  closing of the acquisition, each outstanding share of  QTS 6.50% Series B  Cumulative Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock was  automatically  converted into one New Series A Preferred Unit.  \nAdditional   information regarding the conversion is included in a notice of   occurrence of a fundamental change that has been distributed to holders   of New Series A Preferred Units. Holders who wish to convert their New   Series A Preferred Units should contact their broker, bank or other   nominee. Computershare is serving as the conversion agent and can be   contacted at c/o Computershare, Voluntary Corporate Actions, 150 Royall   Street Suite V, Canton, MA 02021 or \\[redacted email\\]\n\nIt  appears I should be able to convert the shares to cash but Fidelity  seems not to be able to handle that, at least not via the app. Does  anyone know the way to go about this?",

Even worse, after I sold $X, and use that money to purchase $Y. It won\u2019t show me $Y, I had to manually refresh it, to make $X disappear and $Y appear.\nNot only is this frustrating, it may also lead to terrible buy/sell decisions.\n\nSo what apps or websites do you guys use to track real time value of your holdings, better yet, an app where you can adjust cost biases, and get your P/L.",

        "selftext": "Listen up, mouthbreathers!  We all wanna be millionaires.  And this is your ticket.\n\nNow, I realize most of you live in your parents\u2019 basement and probably don\u2019t have any hair, but now it\u2019s that time of year to get a shower and go to your local SuperCuts!\n\nDD:\n\nThis company is beaten down so mercilessly, it\u2019s sad.  Regis Corporation, RGS, owns SuperCuts and a number of other salons and is invested in beauty schools, etc.  This 100 yr American staple is down to under $4 a share \u2014 nearly a 30 yr low.  This company has about 29M shares in the float.  Its short interest is currently 30% (according to Yahoo Finance) and almost 22% (according to highshortinterest.com), so heavily shorted.  This company is owned largely by a handful of institutions (BlackRock, Vanguard, Birch Run, and some others), so the tradeable float is low.  The options interest is currently super high and Fidelity has it about 90% (call to put ratio).  The IV on the first OTM call ($5c Oct) is over 200%, and contracts are cheap (about $35/contract).\n\nThis company has restructured itself to a franchise model, and their CEO is very enthusiastic about their growth and shift in business.  COVID has torn up this industry, but he remains upbeat as can be seen in their recent quarterly report.\n\nBut let\u2019s talk business now.  This company has traded on average (before Sept 10) about 90-200K shares/day over the last many months.  In contrast, since Sept 10, it has only traded fewer than 2M shares once (1.759M shares on 9/13/21).  Even you smooth-brained apes know volume precedes price, but this stock is trading like 10-20x normal volume in last 2 weeks.  Something is brewing.  To be honest, it\u2019s a mix of green and red volume, but something definitely is at play.  \n\nLet\u2019s mount up and send this thing to the moon!  And hey, I\u2019ve seen most of the garbage shilled here on WSB, I\u2019m guessing you will all be working at a SuperCuts anyway if this doesn\u2019t pan out.  There\u2019s one right next to your local Wendy\u2019s.  There\u2019s one next to mine!  \n\nTL;DR: you\u2019re all bald and hopeless, but go to SuperCuts anyway.  Buy RGS and let\u2019s ride the rocket!\n\nCurrent position: 2000 shares @ $3.84/share and 10 Oct $5c.",

In the long term always seems to keep up with the pace of new tech and has solid workforce and at least since they dropped Bannon, management is on point\n\nAMZN- Absolute monster. Hard to not want it in my line up. They will continue to grow and buy up/absorb new tech and not afraid to buy up the little guy to increase their market share.\n\nAMD- I like them for the fact that their tech has been setting the bar as of late. While Intel or Nvidia might be bigger and have more market share, i think AMD has more potential over a long term.\n\nHD- I like the grasp on the non tech market they have. They do well during economic growth. They sustain during economic lulls. And even though I'm a Lowes guy, they are the workhorse in household consumer goods and building materials.\n\nBA- Chose this over an airline because it moves with the same news, but is tied in closely with US Military spending and  will sustain over times of peace and war.\n\nNote: Honestly i invest 70ish% in funds. And only about 25% of my portfolio is in blue chips. But thought it'd be fun to see what people choose and they're reasoning.",

        "selftext": "Companies which operate in duopolies often have wide moats which deliver good financial performance because they're less susceptible to new entrants, often due to high barriers to entry. Many industries also mature to the point where it's only profitable for a handful of companies to operate, which can be profitable for those which survive. For an example, look at the memory semiconductor manufacturing industry. Lots of consolidation over the past two years like Intel selling its NAND business to SK Hynix and Western Digital buying Kioxia. \n\nMy question is, what are some duopolies in relatively attractive industries? Regardless of market cap. I'll start: \n\n$V and $MA: one of the first duopolies many people think of, the two companies with a solid grip on the payment processing space. Have been some worries about new technology/entrants as of late but the chart for these companies tells the story. \n\n$WM and $RSG: waste management is a highly fragmented industry but these two companies have come out on top after Republic Services (the 3rd largest at the time) bought Allied Waste (2nd largest) in 2008. Many think of garbage disposal as a boring, defensive industry akin to utilities, but both stocks are up 150% in five years (good but not great) with a 1.5% dividend, good management and should (theoretically) offer decent downside protection in an economic downturn. \n\nSemiconductor capital equipment: not listing individual stocks because the entire industry is a series of duopolies between $ASM, $LRCX, $AMAT, $TOELY, and $KLAC. The technology is so damn hard and expensive to develop that the market has been whittled down to these five companies supplying most equipment for fabricating semiconductors, charts speak for themselves. \n\nWhat are some other ideas on duopolies? Open to any feedback on this strategy as well.",

I am going to snag his work and put it here for all you apes to adore, and believe the hype!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*&lt;begin\\_plagiarism&gt;*\n\nLucid is an EV manufacturer based out of Newark, California. They were founded in 2007 as Atieva and initially focused on producing battery modules and powertrains for other manufacturers. Since their inception they have been awarded over 325 patents, 50 of which pertain directly to their core battery system in the US alone\\*.\n\nIn 2013 Lucid enlisted the help of now-CEO/CTO Peter Rawlinson. Prior to this Peter was VP of Vehicle Engineering and chief engineer at Tesla helping to develop the Model S. Around this time Lucid was developing a 900 hp powertrain under the *Edna* test bed (basically a stripped dow utility van). In 2016 the company officially rebranded to Lucid Motors and revealed the earliest Lucid Air alpha prototype at the LA motor show.\n\nIn 2019 they broke ground on their Advanced Manufacturing Plant-1 (AMP-1) in Casa Grande, Arizona, the first purpose-built EV factory in the United States. The current factory is over 999k square feet with an additional 5.1 million square feet of building space planned on the 590-acre site\\*. Recently over $350 million in CAPEX for 2021-2023 was brought forward to combine phases 2 and 3 of the AMP factory into one combined phase\\*, with early construction already having begun\\*. Once complete the total manufacturing output will be up to 400k vehicles per year, and eventually upgradeable to &gt; 500k vehicles per year. Lucid also has a powertrain factory (Lucid Manufacturing Plant-1, LMP-1) located 6 miles from AMP-1 where they manufacture all their battery modules, packs, inverters, drive units and wunderboxes\\*.\n\nLucid aims to outcompete Tesla and other EV manufacturers on the basis of their technology, stating competition between Lucid and Tesla will be a \"two horse race.\"\\* In brief, the Lucid Air claims 1080 horsepower and 517 miles of range on the most energy dense powertrain to date. They offer a drag coefficient of 0.21\\*, bested only by the Mercedes EQS. They are looking to compete in the luxury EV sector with an eye for what they term as \"post-luxury,\" emphasizing sustainability and user experience over opulence\\*.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9yj8bmpuzyp71.jpg?width=1440&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c0a6f9f941f2dbfc78063d5256fccdab29a04b84\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\u25b6 **TIMELINE** (picture version):\n\n* 2007 \u2013 Atieva founded (info)\n* Nov 2014 \u2013 ATVUS model first shown (pre-Derek Jenkins) (article)\n* July 2015 \u2013 Edna Atieva powertrain test car (video)\n* Nov 2015 - Atieva officially renamed Lucid Motors (article)\n* Dec 2015 - ATVUS redesign to Lucid Air begins\n* Aug 2016 - DIA award Formula E battery to Atieva (article)\n* Nov 2016 - Alpha fleet revealed at LA motor show (video)\n* Apr 2017 - NY Auto Show - first public display of the Air (video)\n* July 2017 - 235 mile/hour speed run record (video)\n* Aug 2017 - Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance (video)\n* Dec 2017 - Design moves into Ardenwood; Engineering move to temporary offices\n* Sept 2018 - Series D investment (PIF major funding) (article, press release)\n* Oct 2018 - Lucid announce agreement with Electrify America providing access to ultra-fast charging network (article)\n* Feb 2019 - Move to Gateway BLVD HQ in Newark, CA (video)\n* Apr 2019 - Peter Rawlinson (CTO) promoted to CEO (press release)\n* Dec 2019 - Breaking ground on Arizona AMP-1 factory (article)\n* Dec 2019 - Beta 2 fleet begin testing (video)\n* Feb 2020 - Lucid forges long-term cell partnership with LG Chem (article, press release)\n* Sept 2020 - Lucid Air makes fastest lap time at Laguna Seca (article)\n* Sept 2020 - 9/9 Event, official launch of Lucid Air\n* Oct 2020 - First studio opes in Beverly Hills, CA (article)\n* Jan 2021 - Awarded Formula E Gen3 Lucid front powertrain (article)\n* Jan 2021 - Bloomberg publishes C\\*\\*\\* rumor (article)\n* Jan 2021 - Michael Klein fireside chat with IPO Edge - SPAC rumors begin (video)\n* Feb 2021 - C\\*\\*\\*-Lucid Definitive Agreement.

Conceptually, every electric motor can be broken down into two primary components: the *stator* (outer housing) and the *rotor* (internal component). When an electric current is applied to coils lining the stator it generates a magnetic field, and when this current is phased the magnetic field begins to rotate. Magnets on the rotor are attracted to the rotating magnetic field causing the axle to rotate, thereby creating torque. As stated earlier these rotor magnets can be permanent (like Lucid and now Tesla) or electromagnetic. The latter is less efficient because it requires more wire \u2192 more resistance \u2192 more heat \u2192 decreased efficiency. By getting rid of that wire the permanent magnet motor takes up significantly less space and allows you to combine the inverter, transmission, differential and motor into a single smaller package. In Lucid's case this brings the weight of the entire assembly down to just 164 pounds. In conjunction with a proprietary cooling mechanism (axial jet cooling manifold) and a significant decrease to cogging torque this has allowed Lucid to create ***the most power-dense drive unit on the market*** at over 9 hp/kg (compared to Tesla's 3.2 hp/kg). That's ***280% more energy-dense than the nearest competitor.***\n\nLucid's highly efficient motor can deliver up to 670 hp and 2950 lb-ft of torque. The all-wheel-drive Air has two motors and delivers as much as 1,080 total hp with a 0-60-mph time of 2.5 seconds\\*. Check out the timeline above to see videos of their speed records.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/o1stpusvzyp71.jpg?width=1000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fb7eff1951a48874c28474791856d75dea6120ba\n\n***Battery***: Any manufacturer can add more batteries to an EV and increase its range, but this only increases weight and does nothing to improve efficiency (\"dumb range\"). To this end Lucid has been working to maximize its battery efficiency for almost 14 years. One of the most important parts of this is their adoption of a **900+ volt architecture**, the highest in the industry. Why does this matter? Because for the same amount of power a higher voltage system allows you to use lower current (V=IR). Lower current means less heat generated and therefore less total losses. This is based on the I2R principle, where if you x2 your current you x4 your losses. For comparison, Tesla utilizes a 350 volt architecture and would have to nearly triple the current to deliver the same amount of power as Lucid. Since Lucid uses lower currents they can use smaller cables, less wires and therefore less material mass while increasing the vehicle's efficiency. Lucid uses a total of 22 battery modules to make a complete pack, with each module producing around 42 volts for a total of 924 volts, in a package weighing around 1100 pounds total. Each module produces 5.1 kWh and with 22 of them it comes out to **113 kWh total**. This gives the Air an estimated **517 miles total range** (*EPA verification pending*) with an **efficiency of 4.6 miles/kWh**. This is the most efficient battery pack on the market, with Tesla following behind at 4.0 miles/kWh and other manufacturers even further behind still. Peter Rawlinson has stated in 2-3 years 4.8 miles/kWh is achievable, and up to 6.0 miles/kWh in a smaller vehicle format (future Lucid coupe?)\\*:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/izejluexzyp71.png?width=2155&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ba9252ec9a4efe2cb550b385fa9c38099419f025\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lhio20z00zp71.png?width=2191&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fd5baa49a33a130763584fdb952fc85abc95bf32\n\nHigher volt architecture also allows the battery pack to be charged more rapidly than Lucid's competitors at up to 300kW, gaining nearly **300 miles of range in just 20 minutes**. For comparison the Porsche Taycan has previously *advertised* up to 350 kW charging but their own website now only reports only up to 270kW\\*. The Tesla Model S Plaid offers up to 250 kW\\*.\n\nFor battery chemistry Lucid has a contract with LG Chem to be their exclusive battery cell supplier\\*. While the 2170-format cells are similar to those used by other EV manufacturers, Peter Rawlinson has stated that manufacturing a battery pack is 85% mechanical and only 15% chemistry. One innovative feature of Lucid's battery packs is utilization of end-cooling as opposed to side-cooling (like Tesla)\\*. Not only is this more efficient it allows them to pack individual cells more tightly and to better optimize total energy density.\n\nIt should also be noted that Lucid has supplied all the battery packs for Formula E racing since 2018 using the 18650-format cells\\*. This same technology powering Formula E will be driving you to KFC for the 4th time this week.\n\nSome have argued that 517 miles of range is irrelevant if you're only driving to and from work every day, however keep in mind increased range does not simply imply longer individual trips\u2014it also means less frequent charging. EV adoption has historically been tempered by *range anxiety*\u2014the fear of running out of charge during a long trip. This type of range significantly decreases that anxiety and offers greater mobility than almost any commercial ICE sedan.\n\n***Wunderbox***: Lucid calls this the heart of their electrical platform\\*. It allows compatibility with\u2014and the maximizing of\u2014charging systems of differing voltages, specifically boost-voltage charging. It enables a wide array of future-ready bi-directional power delivery features. These include vehicle-to-grid (V2G) compatibility for situations such as managing home power outages as well as vehicle-to-vehicle charging (V2V).\n\n***Dream Drive***: This is Lucid's Advanced Driver-Assistance System (ADAS). It's made up of 32 total sensors including ultrasonic, radar and an industry-first high-definition LIDAR system. There is also an internal camera system for driver monitoring and can take over in difficult situations. The Dream Drive system will be updated over the air and will deliver level 2 driving at launch. Level 3 driver assistance and geo-fenced HD mapping will be updated OTA shortly thereafter. For comparison Tesla has admitted their \"Full Self-Driving\" system is still level 2 under the definition of US authorities\\*. Nevertheless, I don't believe Lucid's intent here is to be the industry leader, and Peter Rawlinson has stated that true autonomous driving (levels 4-5) is still many years away. More information is available on Lucid's website\\*.\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\u25b6 **VEHICLES AND TRIMS:**\n\n**Air sedan**: Lucid will start by offering the Air Dream Edition beginning this year (2021), with three additional trims being released sequentially over the next couple years. The Dream Edition is their top-of-the-line model and starts at a price of $161,500 (*after $7,500 tax credit in the US\\**). Future models step down in price to the $69,900 Air Pure. Each are compared in the following image:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/usm8geczzyp71.png?width=2452&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5fffdc7aaae1f913ab3a9400a1133ad1212c0644\n\n\\*US tax credits are on the fence with the infrastructure bill right now\\*\n\n**Gravity SUV**: \"Project Gravity\" will be Lucid's entry into the lucrative SUV market\\*. Prototypes have already been built\\* using Lucid's Electric Advanced Platform (LEAP), the same modular platform upon which the Air is manufactured. Accordingly it should offer fairly similar specifications to that of its sedan sibling. The body will be a little wider than the Air but a good bit taller, seating up to 7 passengers. Production is expected to begin in 2H 2023.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j8imlj130zp71.jpg?width=600&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=210716737bce8e989efa725e986cdb45e242ac1c\n\nProject Gravity SUV\n\n**Additional vehicles:** Lucid has future plans for an additional coupe and pickup truck by 2030\\*.\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\u25b6 **CHARGING:**\n\nCharging will be on the basis of Lucid-branded EV supply equipment as well as outside partnerships\\*. Lucid's own equipment will supply AC charging at 10-20 kW using their standard portable EV Supply Equipment (EVSE) versus an optional wall mount through an official Lucid-Installation partner, QMerit or an electrician of the customer's choice. Lucid community partnerships will be capable of AC charging up to \\~20kW and DC charging up to \\~300kW. *Every vehicle sold will come with three years of free charging through an Electrify America*, and will be compatible with networks leveraging J1772 and CCS charging standards such as ChargePoint and EVgo\\*.\n\nTesla's supercharger network has first-mover advantage but is highly capital intensive and limited to a legacy 400V maximum architecture, charging at 250 kW with the latest V3 units. Lucid's partnership with Electrify America is a much more CAPEX-light alternative and is compatible with 900V second-generation systems, charging at a maximum of 350 kW. It also uses the open-source CSS connector as apposed to Tesla's closed-source system.\n\nModern EVs are migrating to ultra high voltage architectures, eg, Porsche at 800V, Lucid at over 900V. Tesla systems and vehicles adopted 400V largely as a consequence of earlier technology.\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**\u25b6 PEOPLE:**\n\nLucid has collected an impressive roster of executive leadership, many of which with resum\u00e9s from some of Silicon Valley's most sought-after brands. An abbreviated biography is provided below, however the take-home point is the pedigree from which Lucid draws its talent. Companies such as **Apple, Intel, Waymo, Tesla, Audi, Ferrari** and **Ford** are represented and this positions Lucid well in terms of technical expertise and networking.\n\n**Peter Rawlinson** (CEO/CTO) - Born in South Wales, UK. Studied Mechanical Engineering at Imperial College London before graduating in 1979\\*. Prior to Lucid he gathered over 30 years experience between being the Principal Engineer at Lotus Cars, Head of Vehicle Engineering at Corus Automotive and VP of Vehicle Engineering at Tesla (Sept 2009 - Jan 2012)\\*. At Tesla he was the chief engineer of the Model S, responsible for its technical execution and delivery by improving both its structure and production\\*. Peter would later join Atieva in 2013 as their Chief Technology Officer (CTO) before being promoted to CEO in 2019\\*. Elon Musk has publicly tried to downplay Peter's role at Lucid via Twitter\\*; however, this has been thoroughly verified and refuted\\*.\n\n**Sherry House** (CFO) - Sherry joined Lucid Motors as Chief Financial Officer in May 2021\\*. Prior to Lucid she was Treasurer and Head of Investor Relations at Waymo LLC, an autonomous driving technology company and subsidiary of Alphabet Inc (Google)\\*. She worked to guide the company's investments, acquisitions and external fundraising. She has an engineering background with BAs in Mechanical Engineering and Industrial Engineering, as well as an MBA and Masters of Manufacturing and Engineering.\n\n**Derek Jenkins** (Senior VP or Design and Brand) - Derek currently oversees all design developments including exterior and interior design, user experience, color and material, accessories and design strategy\\*. Before joining Lucid he was the Director of Design at Mazda North America Operations where he oversaw all design developments both locally and globally\\*. Prior to Mazda he was the Chief Designer for Volkswagen North America for 9 years, and was a designer for Audi in both Germany and the United States for eight years.\n\n**Eric Bach** (Senior VP of Product and Chief Engineer) - Eric has guided numerous vehicles to market for both Volkswagen AG and Tesla Motors\\*. At Tesla he oversaw several engineering functions for the Model S, Model X, and Model 3 programs. Under his leadership his teams successfully enabled the Model S and Model X programs to deliver pioneering engineering and technology solutions under vastly accelerated timelines when compared to the industry at large.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/blka49d40zp71.png?width=977&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f8f1fb4ca97e2736af6a8c83c96c984716f1c3e2\n\nBesides executive positions Lucid currently employs over 2,000 people and has a 4.2 out of 5 score on Glassdoor.com\\*. There are currently 900+ job postings on their website indicating that they are growing very rapidly\\*, expecting more than 4000 total employees by next year\\*.\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\u25b6 **MARKET OPPORTUNITY:**\n\n**General EV market**: EV adoption is still very early. To draw an analogy, the growth of ICE automobiles per 1,000 people between 1900 and 1909 has a very strong correlation coefficient (98%) with the current growth of EVs between 2011 through 2020\\*. This growth will almost certainly continue due to multiple factors, including supportive government policies and regulations promoting EV adoption, increasing investments from OEMs, rising environmental concerns and the decreasing cost of batteries. Keeping this in mind EVs are in a strong position to cannibalize the $5 trillion automobile market, and there's little debate over long-term industry growth. We are only at the beginning of what looks to be a parabolic growth curve, and time in the market will almost certainly beat timing the market.\n\n**Luxury vehicle market**: In 2020 the EV market comprised 5% of all new car sales. Lucid is specifically targeting the luxury EV market which is expected to grow at a CAGR of 5%, from $496 billion in 2018 to $742 billion in 2026.\n\n**Total addressable market (TAM)**: For 2021-2022 Lucid anticipates the Air model to represent 2% of the total addressable EV market (*this number may change based on current commodities and chip markets*). By 2030 they estimate a run-rate production of &gt;500k vehicles, representing an estimated 4% of total market share.\n\n**Production volume**: Production is underway at Lucid\u2019s custom-built Advanced Manufacturing Plant (AMP-1) in Casa Grande, Arizona with deliveries starting in the next few months (2H 2021). Lucid will start by selling various trims of the model Air (see above), however Project Gravity (2023) and future models (2025+) will contribute to future production estimates as outlined below:\n\n* 2021 - 577 vehicles\n* 2022 \u2013 20,000 vehicles\n* 2023 \u2013 49,000 vehicles\n* 2024 \u2013 90,000 vehicles\n* 2025 \u2013 135,000 vehicles\n* 2026 \u2013 251,000 vehicles\n\n*Note: these forecasts were published in late May 2021*\\*. Lucid has since announced they are expediting phases 2 and 3 of their manufacturing plant into one combined phase, adding 2.7 million additional square feet of manufacturing space by 2023 and increasing production capacity to 53,000 vehicles by the same year\\*\\*\\*\\*. It is unclear how much this will affect production numbers in the years following but they would presumably increase.\\*\n\n**Revenue forecast**: Lucid is projecting 174% average annual total revenue growth, ramping from $2.2 billion in 2022 to 22.8 billion by 2026\\*. Current expectations are for a **positive EBITDA by 2024** and to be **free cash flow positive by 2025**\\*.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m7ubjif50zp71.png?width=977&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=39d87075d7ed1e05626f32fdcb85bd59550a1c4e\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\u25b6 **FUTURE DIRECTION:**\n\nPeter Rawlinson has said he sees three arms the Lucid Group of businesses: vehicles, electrical storage systems (ESS) and technology licensing. Vehicles are discussed above. Lucid has been developing an **electrical storage system** for some time and already has a working 300 kWh prototype at their headquarters in California\\*. They are also working towards larger pilot project at the Lucid vehicle manufacturing facility in Arizona (AMP-1). Batteries typically retain a charging capacity of around 70% once they\u2019re removed from EVs, which means they potentially have another decade of useful life\\*. Much like Tesla's home battery packs this will allow Lucid to further leverage their own expertise in battery module design targeting home, commercial and utility scale applications. Automakers like General Motors, Ford Motor, and Audi AG have also initiated second-life pilot projects.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/buq3dei60zp71.jpg?width=1200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f3a2698ee2c34a0a37850630aa50d9bf43d0beb3\n\nAs a **technology supplier** Lucid already provides battery modules and software to all Formula E race cars (see above). In-house technology designed for mass production will position Lucid well for large scale supply to other OEMs. They advertise potential for a wide range of applications including aircraft, eVTOL, military, heavy machinery, agriculture and marine.\n\nLucid plans to expand into foreign markets in the near future, including Saudi Arabia as early as 2022\\* and European markets thereafter. Lucid likely has a contractual obligation to the former as part of its deal with Public Investment Fund (PIF), having invested over $2.9 billion into Lucid Motors in 2018\\*. If this continues as planned then total production volumes and revenues would significantly alter market opportunities and valuation estimates outlined above.\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\u25b6 **VALUATION ESTIMATE:**\n\n**Let's be honest this is probably the only reason you're here.** With that in mind Lucid is obviously a pre-production pre-revenue company, making an accurate estimation of its value both challenging and highly up to interpretation. One way we can approach this is by looking at its market capitalization, currently $35.1 billion at a share price of $21.67 (8/22/2021). With this in mind we can make the following comparisons:\n\n*CompanyValuation (8/22/2021)Total debtPrice-to-sales (P/S) ratio*Tesla (TSLA)$673.5 billion$11.1 billion (6/2021)\\*18.33\\*Toyota (TM)$226.8 billion$24.5 trillion (6/2021)\\*0.81\\*Volkswagen (VWAGY)$144.6 billion$219.2 billion (6/2021)\\*0.51\\*General Motors (GM)$70.8 billion$111.1 billion (6/2021)\\*0.51\\*Nio (NIO)$57.9 billion$2.7 billion (6/2021)\\*12.7\\*Honda (HMC)$50.7 billion$7.7 trillion (6/2021)\\*0.37\\*Ford (F)$50.2 billion$148.2 billion (6/2021)\\*0.37\\*Lucid (LCID)$35.1 billion$179 million\\*N/A *(see below)*Xpeng$30.8 billion$2.7 billion (3/2021)\\*N/ALi$27.1 billion$3.9 billion (3/2021)\\*N/AFisker (FSR)$3.9 billion$20.2 million (6/2021)\\*N/A\n\nThis is based on an LCID share count of 1.619 billion. However, assuming the company exercises all available warrants (*they are all ITM*) there will soon be 1.704 billion shares outstanding, raising the LCID market capitalization to $36.93 billion. With this in mind we can try to estimate LCID's current value based on their own revenue projections of $22.8 billion by 2026\\*. *If they meet this goal they are currently trading at 1.620 times future sales* ($36.93b/$22.8b). Since the market returns about 10% average per year we will assume a discount rate of 10% to bring future sales back down to present value. Given the term of 4.25 years (Sept 2021- Jan 2026) we can calculate LCID's net present value (NPV) as $15.2 billion\\*. *As a result this means* ***LCID currently trades at a P/S ratio of 2.4x*** ($36.93b/$15.2b).\n\nFor comparison you can see TSLA trades at 18.3x sales and Nio at 12.7x sales. LCID at 2.4x may very well be undervalued in this scenario. However both TSLA and Nio are currently selling cars for the 0 Lucid currently has on the road. Lucid does however have over 11,000 paid pre-orders of the Air, including the completely reserved $169k Dream Edition.\n\nWith this in mind we might be able to target a P/S ratio of let's say 5. The technology sector currently averages a P/S ratio of 7.52\\* so 5 seems more than fair. If that's the case then LCID has an upside potential of almost 106% (5/2.43). ***This would bring the share price to $44.64 with an estimated market capitalization of $76.1 billion.*** This is over a hypothetical 12 months but the rate is otherwise TBD. That may seem like a lot, but for a US manufacturer with the most efficient EV on the market I personally don't believe it is. This would put Lucid at a market capitalization close to the $70 billion being sought by Rivian for their IPO\\*.",

ways to reduce water consumption in semiconductor manufacturing:\n\n* Transition from wet to dry etching\n* Improvements on the efficiency of etching processes used for ultrapure water (UPW) production\n* Optimization of tools and procedures for UPW production process\n* Reuse of spent rinse waters/wastewater streams\n\n**Technical Analysis**\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\nLooking at the 6-month chart for TSM, strong resistance and support lines indicate a resistance around the $125 mark and solid support around the $108 mark. A buying opportunity may come up if we see TSM dip down near its support range. Bullish breakthrough at $125 and bearish breakthrough at $108.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe biggest issue the semiconductor industry faces today is heating. Semiconductor fabs use the water equivalent of 12 golf courses. The solution to this problem is dry etching which uses gaseous chemicals to make patterns on substrates. Large fabricators have their own methods for reusing water but to be frank, are only scratching the surface. TSM\u2019s Green Marketing Strategy does little to address the issue at hand. The semiconductor industry is expected to grow by 25% with water consumption expecting to increase by 15%. Aside from this issue, TSM has a comparative advantage over its rival Intel. TSM has a significantly higher market cap, lower total debt, and fewer liabilities. TSM doesn\u2019t pay out dividends but instead uses the money to grow its business. Intel has mediocre dividends at best. TSM will be a trillion-dollar company in the next 5-10 years. Biden\u2019s $50B subsidy plan will revamp production and should hopefully put the U.S in contention for the global semiconductor producer leader. TSMs new $100B fabs in Arizona will be a catalyst for domestic semiconductor production with growing support from U.S subsidies. TSM has a positive outlook for the next 3-4 years.\n\n*\\*\\*This is not investment advice. We are not experts.

        "selftext": "Wait, Wait, before you downvote me into the depths of hells, let me explain. First, I have been contemplating buying puts on NVDA for about a month now, and it's kept on going up and the only reason I haven't pulled the trigger yet is because I feel like I'm missing something so let me explain my case, then you explain why I'm wrong. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOk, first, NVDA is a 550 billion dollar company with 20 billion in revenue and a P/E of nearly 80, and a forward P/E of 60. This is literally SENILE, in 2000, when Intel was all the shit, as a 300 billion dollar company it had a P/E of 40, and now 20 years later it's still down while it's doubles it's revenue and 4x it's profit. So, with NVDA trading at a multiple of 80, even if let's say they 3x their eps in the next 5 years which is an extremely absurd assumption as they've already had a ton of growth fueled from cover, they would have 9 dollars of EPS and looking at today's stock price, if it stayed the same they would still be trading at a multiple of 24 which is ridiculous if they somehow just 4x their revenue in a matter of 5 years. Looking at all the growth catalysts I would find it only somewhat reasonable if they 2x their profit which would give them 6 dollars of EPS and keep them at a P/E of 40. That is once again Intels multiple at the peak of 2000 when it was also half the market cap. \n\nLastly, NVDA has gone up nearly 100% from it's lows in February for two reasons, slightly better than expected earnings and a stock split, none of which would justify that movement. \n\nSo, that's what I'm thinking, I HAVE TO BE MISSING SOMETHING RIGHT?, why does this seem so overvalued as such a large company, can someone please explain because if not those 2024 140 strike price puts are looking real sexy.",

        "selftext": "We see a lot of hype around popular industries like genomics, semiconductors, or cars, and often these hyped-up stocks end up becoming scarily overvalued. \n\nAnother way to invest in growing and hyped-up industries is to invest into companies that produce the supplies for these industries, rather than the big-names at the face of it. Not to mention, you're more likely to win if you invest in a supplier versus a small cap company looking to get in on the next big thing. In some industries, like electric cars, the hype has already consumed supply such as lithium battery stocks.\n\nThis discussion is primarily inspired by /u/Thereian's comment describing these kind of stock picks:\n\n&gt;ENTG - Semiconduct manufacturing supplier. They supply all major players. Lots of battles going on in this industry but no matter who wins (Taiwan Semi, Intel, etc) they get paid.

        "selftext": "^Reposting ^an ^updated ^version ^of ^this ^thread.\n\nWe see a lot of hype around popular industries like genomics, semiconductors, or cars, and often these hyped-up stocks end up becoming scarily overvalued. \n\nAnother way to invest in growing and hyped-up industries is to invest into companies that produce the supplies for these industries, rather than the big-names at the face of it. Not to mention, you're more likely to win if you invest in a supplier versus one of the many small cap companies looking to get in on the next big thing. In some industries, like electric cars or semiconductors, the hype has already consumed supply stocks such as lithium battery stocks.\n\nThis discussion is primarily inspired by /u/Thereian's [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/om9772/what_are_your_underappreciated_offtheradar_picks/h5kxnlz/) describing these kind of stock picks:\n\n&gt;ENTG - Semiconduct manufacturing supplier. They supply all major players. Lots of battles going on in this industry but no matter who wins (Taiwan Semi, Intel, etc) they get paid. And all of the investment that Intel and Taiwan Semi are making to build billions of dollars worth of FABs? Yeah, Entegris will get their chunk of that money. They sell the equipment upfront and the consumables going forward. Truly a fantastic company, I've owned since 2009 and am still completely bullish.\n\n&gt;TMO - Similar to the above philosophy. Lots of expensive cell and gene therapy companies out there, those are high risk. But there's a low-risk high-reward play: Thermo Fisher.

Thats what drove me to look in to high-moat suppliers in the first place and I will continue to.\n\nOther tickers mentioned in the [previous thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/pp6gfl/lesserknown_stocks_that_supply_popular_industries/) for this topic include:\n\n**$ILMN:** Provides tools for genomics work. Seems to have a high P/E and is a bit of a popular genomic play, though.\n\n**$LEA and $ADNT:** Auto parts suppliers. Pretty cyclical industry and unstable charts, however.\n\n**URI**: United Rentals, construction equipment rentals. Might benefit from infrastructure spending. Not exactly what we think of as supply but I'll leave it here.\n\n**$SWKS:** Semiconductor supply picks are popular but this one was mentioned the most as people believe it to be undervalued.\n\n**$MTRN:** Metals company involved in parts for \"EV, space, and renewables.\"\n\n**CDW:** Provider of IT programs for business, government, and education. Again, not exactly supply but it was mentioned and piqued my interest.\n\nWhat do you all think of this investment strategy? Are any of these stocks on your radar? What else would you add?",

        "selftext": "I gotta tell you, this sector is pretty freaking exciting.   As a private pilot, the thought of eventually flying one of these planes is incredibly cool.   As much as Tesla has done to push EVs forward, what's happening in aviation is more meaningful.    The general aviation industry is comprised of planes that are often 50 years old.  Sure, many have been updated avionics from Garmin, but most planes lack any real development.  Yeah, Cirrus has done amazing work but for the most part, the technology hasn't changed.  Part of it has been lack of investment but that's changing now.  I think new companies like Lilium and Joby have seen what's being done in the auto industry and are saying \"we can do that.\"   Established companies like Airbus are probably saying \"we'd better get our shit together.\"   \n\nThere is no doubt that companies will fail.   I have no clue where the industry will be in 10yrs.   But, if you're psyched about what's happening in the EV space, it probably makes sense to take a look here.   Below is an article that does a great job summarizing this industry.   It's not written by a pump and dump shit publication but rather the association that helps promote and govern aviation.\n\nGood luck.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://www.aopa.org/news-and-media/all-news/2021/september/pilot/evtols-score-big-bucks](https://www.aopa.org/news-and-media/all-news/2021/september/pilot/evtols-score-big-bucks)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: From the article.\n\n\"Joby Aviation has attracted a large share of venture capital over the past year. Uber Elevate, the ride-sharing giant\u2019s air taxi concept, decided to walk away from that idea and throw support amounting to $75 million to Joby\u2019s S4, a 170-knot, 150-nautical-mile, five-seat eVTOL. Toyota, Intel, and JetBlue anted up another $820 million. Joby\u2019s Santa Cruz, California, factory has reportedly been expanded, and the company said it expects to hire 1,600 employees. Joby has raised some $1.5 billion. Reports indicate that the FAA has approved a certification pathway for the S4. Joby also says that pilot certification, airframe, and airspace regulations are in the works with the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA). Certification and entry into service are expected in 2023.\"\n\n\"Two German designs have also apparently been making great headway. Lilium, maker of what it calls five- and seven-seat eVTOL \u201cjets,\u201d says that certification for both designs is in progress with the FAA and EASA. These are powered by 36 electrically driven, tiltable ducted fans set in the canard and wing trailing edges. Cruise speed is advertised as 150 knots, maximum altitude as 10,000 feet, and maximum range as 135 nm. Certification is expected in 2024, with entry into service in 2025. So far, Lilium has raised a reported $390 million. The company said it plans a network of \u201cvertiports\u201d that will let passengers fly between key cities in Florida. The first vertiport will be somewhere in South Florida.\"",

        "selftext": "Barrons\n\n President Biden\u2019s budget calls for higher taxes on companies, and it\u2019s simply a matter of time before it becomes law, thanks to the Democrats\u2019 slim voting majority in the Senate. Even West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin, a Democratic moderate, appears to be on board, as long as the stimulus that the higher levies would help fund is paid for. \n\nDon\u2019t expect stocks to shrug off a tax increase. Bank of America strategist Ohsung Kwon estimates that a 25% corporate rate would cut 2022 earnings estimates by 5%, potentially erasing all of next year\u2019s expected profit growth. The tech and health-care sectors, with a 7% decline, would take the biggest hit, while energy, real estate, and utilities, for the most part,would be unscathed. \n\nFor instance, the basket of stocks with little tax sensitivity includes Canadian National Railway (CNI), with no exposure to U.S. tax rates, while the more tax-sensitive basket includes CSX (CSX), a U.S.-based railroad company. In tech, the Netherlands-based NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) is paired with the more U.S. tax-sensitive Intel (INTC). Senyek sees McDonald\u2019s (MCD) as less tax sensitive than Domino\u2019s (DPZ), and Twitter (TWTR) as less so than Netflix (NFLX).\n\nhttps://www.barrons.com/articles/stock-market-biden-corporate-tax-plan-51630663201?mod=RTA",

A buying opportunity may come up if we see TSM dip down near its support range. Bullish breakthrough at $125 and bearish breakthrough at $108.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe biggest issue the semiconductor industry faces today is heating. Semiconductor fabs use the water equivalent of 12 golf courses. The solution to this problem is dry etching which uses gaseous chemicals to make patterns on substrates. Large fabricators have their own methods for reusing water but to be frank, are only scratching the surface. TSM\u2019s Green Marketing Strategy does little to address the issue at hand. The semiconductor industry is expected to grow by 25% with water consumption expecting to increase by 15%. Aside from this issue, TSM has a comparative advantage over its rival Intel. TSM has a significantly higher market cap, lower total debt, and fewer liabilities. TSM doesn\u2019t pay out dividends but instead uses the money to grow its business. Intel has mediocre dividends at best. TSM will be a trillion-dollar company in the next 5-10 years. Biden\u2019s $50B subsidy plan will revamp production and should hopefully put the U.S in contention for the global semiconductor producer leader. TSMs new $100B fabs in Arizona will be a catalyst for domestic semiconductor production with growing support from U.S subsidies. TSM has a positive outlook for the next 3-4 years.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*\\*\\*This is not investment advice. We are not experts.

This is crazy growth, and the current valuation seems not to fully consider such growth, especially considering that it is the biggest segment of Nvidia. Nvidia has a PE of 79, it may look big, but Amazon (AMZN) has a PE of 59 and growth is tiny in comparison. Square (SQ) has a PE of more than 200.\n\n# Why you will make money in 3 years: \n\n\u00b7 Compute and network segment (chips for data centers): growth of 46% to $2.6 billion. This is crazy growth for a normal company, but it is not sufficient for Nvidia. However, the future looks sexy.\n\n\u00b7 Data are the future and companies are building data centers all the time. If Amazon invests so heavily in AWS, it is because the cloud is the future! Well, the more Amazon spends on the cloud, the more money Nvidia makes. **Demand for Nvidia chips is exploding**, especially when considering that they are way better than the one from Intel (boomers go home). The cake and the slice of the cake are growing for Nvidia and I will eat the cake as I am a shareholder!\n\n# Why you will make money in 5 years:\n\n\u00b7 Professional use: Industry will progressively get more automated and therefore needs more chips. Annually graphics cards for high-end professional workstations **went up 156% annually** to $519 million. This growth is tremendous and proves that demand is enormous. \n\n\u00b7 Secondly, its automotive business unit. Sales were up 37% from last year's respective quarter. This is poor growth (LOL) for Nvidia but the future looks awesome. If you think two seconds, you will realize that the future is not about EVs, the true revolution will be autonomous cars! And who will be the true winner? Tesla? No! Nio? No! Nvidia? Yeah boy, you got it! Considering the potential of this sector and how crazy people get \u201cjust\u201d with EVs, **Nvidia will not go to the moon but through the whole universe**, once people understand the potential of this division! \n\n# TLDR:\n\nBears have been repeating that Nvidia has been too expensive for a while. They have been repeating that it is not rational for the stock to double in 12 months and blablabla. Well, if they were not retarded, they would see that they are still **tons of catalysts** and the more time passes, the more we will use Nvidia products. So bears are gay and bulls are strong! \n\nPosition: because I do not live in a cave, I bought 50 shares, worth approximately 11,350 USD.",

        "selftext": "So just putting this out there I have 5 shares of TSM and a $125 call options contract set to expire on November 19th.\n\nI\u2019ve been pretty bullish on TSM mostly because I\u2019ve been expecting it to trend upwards into the end of the year to about $145. \n\nI\u2019m basing this off of the increased demand, the chip shortage, TSM increasing their prices, and the fact that Intel can\u2019t compete as they don\u2019t even do 5nm chips.\n\nAm I wrong to assume quality can lift this company upward? \n\nAlso, as far as strategy is concerned, I\u2019m mostly trying to make profit off the call contract I have, sell it, and then buy more shares of TSM. Would that be a mistake? Is there a better way to do this?\n\nAlso FYI I\u2019m trading in a Roth IRA.",

AEye\u2019s iDAR\u2122 (Intelligent Detection and Ranging) system leverages biomimicry and principles from automated targeting applications used by the military to scan the environment, intelligently focusing on what matters most, enabling faster, more accurate, and more reliable perception. iDAR is the **ONLY software configurable LiDAR** (YOU READ THAT RIGHT) with integrated deterministic artificial intelligence, delivering industry-leading performance in range, resolution, and speed.

Luminar has a market cap of 5.86 billion as of today. That is almost 4x what LIDR is at right now.\n\n**Ape's instinct kicked in:**\n\nOkay I know this is retarded. You know what Luminar does? THEY MANUFACTURE LIDAR. What does this have to do with LIDR? LIDR manufactures LIDAR too. LIDR will definitely get recognition from its unique ticker symbol LIDR as it is so close to \u201cLIDAR\u201d (like i said , I am retarded.)

While many other LIDARs process in a linear or serial manner, **AEye parallel processes using a bistatic architecture**. This approach allows AEye to transmit and receive light out of separate paths, enabling the delivery of its iDAR\u2122 perception system and adaptive capabilities that power its [industry-leading range](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.aeye.ai%2Fpress%2Fvsi-issues-independent-report-verifying-aeye-lidar-performance%2F&amp;esheet=52494954&amp;newsitemid=20210921005466&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=industry-leading+range&amp;index=3&amp;md5=f27492b3807e03e72c27093bbea60d99), resolution, refresh rates, agility and intelligence.\u201d\n\nAEye\u2019s patent portfolio can generally be organized into four groups:\n\n**1. Intelligent Modular Architecture**\n\nThis group of patents relate to AEye\u2019s intelligent modular bistatic architecture, system design, and its solid-state performing MEMs-based agile LiDAR. While many other LIDARs process in a linear or serial manner, AEye parallel processes using a bistatic architecture. This approach allows AEye to transmit and receive light out of separate paths, enabling the delivery of its iDAR\u2122 perception system and adaptive capabilities that power its industry-leading range, resolution, refresh rates, agility and intelligence. Equally important, AEye\u2019s design allows for flexibility in hardware packaging and vehicle placement options, unlike some LiDAR sensors that are limited to roof placement. These patents include protection of the overall architecture, of feedback techniques to keep the scanning where desired during vehicle vibration and temperature variation, as well as the ability to control detection pulse width and receiver bandwidth.\n\n**2. Open System and Extended Data Capabilities**\n\nA second group of patents focus on AEye\u2019s software definable AI technology and iDAR\u2019s ability to integrate other existing sensors, such as radar, cameras, and IMUs. These patents address AEye\u2019s unique co-boresighted design, wherein an HD camera and LiDAR receiver share the same optical axis, creating true color point clouds which enhance classification capabilities and eliminate the need for post-processing parallax correction. By co-boresighting the camera with the LiDAR receiver, AEye moves intelligence into the sensor. This enables the sensor to detect and immediately request additional data about objects and anomalies, then issue \"fast path\" priority message alerts to inform the motion planning system. By pushing detected threats to the top of the data stack under consideration by the motion planning system, AEye reduces central processing burdens, and speeds time to reaction.\n\n**3. Enhanced Data Quality**\n\nThe third group encompasses innovative features such as scan agility, which enables the sensor to \"acquire\" pre-classification attributes useful in accelerating perception systems. For example, AEye is able to pinpoint intra frame velocity by capturing both radial and lateral velocity, where most threats occur while driving. These patents build a software-defined layer upon the bistatic platform, and include the ability to optimize shot lists as a function of scenes and environment, novel tracking schemes, and tracking the horizon during car motion. The latter is an important aspect of agility and intelligence, as it reduces the required vertical scan field of view, and therefore reduces frame to frame time. iDAR\u2019s ability to enable software-defined frames and dynamic scan patterns and the platform\u2019s ability to deploy adaptive energy control on a pulse-by-pulse basis enables both the dynamic adjustment of scan patterns and the ability to adapt the laser energy for each pulse for complete interference mitigation.\n\n**4. Optical Data Networking**\n\nThe fourth group enables AEye to expand the capabilities of the AEye sensor to enable the laser to communicate information. This groundbreaking feature is uniquely enabled by AEye\u2019s adaptive LiDAR, in which the laser can be directed with precision. Pulsed message packets enable data to be transferred via line-of-sight. By using optical communications via the LiDAR system, AEye sensors can leverage a readily available, secure and reliable communications channel, which does not compete with the congested bandwidth of WiFi, cellular, and/or satellite communications, to transmit, receive, and/or transceive data.\n\n\"We set out to build a flexible architecture that could be expanded and adapted over time, adding new innovations. Our IP strategy, we believe, places us years ahead of others building single use hardware,\" said Dr. Allan Steinhardt, chief scientist at AEye. \"We will continue to push forward aggressively with developing and protecting competitive intellectual property to advance AEye\u2019s technological leadership. We are creating a thorough and rigorously defensible patent portfolio covering the architecture and software that underlie our solution.\"",

        "selftext": "I've spent over a year thinking about this, where I initially began as Facebook being my main holding. As an engineer I saw:\n\n- visionary, young CEO\n- their influence on the internet via the React development environment\n- their influence on networking via WhatsApp and low latency considerations (the number one reason I left Snapchat for Instagram many years ago in Mexico)\n- their historic imprint on social media \n- the VR hardware for future proofing\n\n\nAs an investor I saw:\n\n- an application with perverse incentives \n\n\nUltimately, after comparing FB to big tech, I feel that FB has the weakest moat compared to, say the logistics power of Amazon, the intelligence for Google, or IoT for Apple. FB has connection. \n\n- Slack in workspaces\n- Roblox in metaverse\n- Pinterest in social commerce\n- Discord in chat\n- TikTok in shorts\n- YouTube/Twitch in longforms\n- Reddit with communities\n- Twitter in messaging\n- Snapchat in snapshot media\n- Tinder in dating\n\nThe list goes on and on. The difference here is that these platforms are all EXCEPTIONALLY good at incentivizing their niche. Pinterest isn't just social e-commerce, it's also a search engine for ideas. Roblox isn't just a kids game, it's an education platform. Etc etc.\n\n\nPeople make the mistake that Facebook will eventually go the way of Myspace. This is wrong. It will remain as a dinosaur and fundamental to software, similar to that of Oracle or Intel. We already begin to see this at the application level where acquisitions of things like GIPHY inserts Facebook into the interfaces of applications like TikTok or Slack.\n\nMy view is that FB will see the beginning of the end with it's assertion into the metaverse. Despite having the VR ecosystem and a growing alternative currency system, I feel that FB will fail to provide the right system that nurtures connection and enjoyment.",

        "selftext": "Barrons\n\nPresident Biden\u2019s budget calls for higher taxes on companies, and it\u2019s simply a matter of time before it becomes law, thanks to the Democrats\u2019 slim voting majority in the Senate. Even West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin, a Democratic moderate, appears to be on board, as long as the stimulus that the higher levies would help fund is paid for.\n\nDon\u2019t expect stocks to shrug off a tax increase. Bank of America strategist Ohsung Kwon estimates that a 25% corporate rate would cut 2022 earnings estimates by 5%, potentially erasing all of next year\u2019s expected profit growth. The tech and health-care sectors, with a 7% decline, would take the biggest hit, while energy, real estate, and utilities, for the most part,would be unscathed.\n\nFor instance, the basket of stocks with little tax sensitivity includes Canadian National Railway (CNI), with no exposure to U.S. tax rates, while the more tax-sensitive basket includes CSX (CSX), a U.S.-based railroad company. In tech, the Netherlands-based NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) is paired with the more U.S. tax-sensitive Intel (INTC). Senyek sees McDonald\u2019s (MCD) as less tax sensitive than Domino\u2019s (DPZ), and Twitter (TWTR) as less so than Netflix (NFLX).\n\nhttps://www.barrons.com/articles/stock-market-biden-corporate-tax-plan-51630663201?mod=RTA",

They were founded in 2007 as Atieva and initially focused on producing battery modules and powertrains for other manufacturers. Since their inception they have been awarded over 325 patents, 50 of which pertain directly to their core battery system in the US alone\\*.\n\nIn 2013 Lucid enlisted the help of now-CEO Peter Rawlinson. Prior to this Peter was VP of Vehicle Engineering and chief engineer at Tesla helping to develop the Model S. Around this time Lucid was developing a 900 hp powertrain under the *Edna* test bed (basically a stripped dow utility van). In 2016 the company officially rebranded to Lucid Motors and revealed the earliest Lucid Air alpha prototype at the LA motor show.\n\nIn 2019 they broke ground on their Advanced Manufacturing Plant-1 (AMP-1) in Casa Grande, Arizona, the first purpose-built EV factory in the United States. The current factory is over 999k square feet with an additional 5.1 million square feet of building space planned on the 590-acre site\\*. Recently over $350 million in CAPEX for 2021-2023 was brought forward to combine phases 2 and 3 of the AMP factory into one combined phase\\*, with early construction already having begun\\*. Once complete the total manufacturing output will be up to 400k vehicles per year, and eventually upgradeable to &gt; 500k vehicles per year. Lucid also has a powertrain factory (Lucid Manufacturing Plant-1, LMP-1) located 6 miles from AMP-1 where they manufacture all their battery modules, packs, inverters, drive units and wunderboxes\\*.\n\nLucid aims to outcompete Tesla and other EV manufacturers on the basis of their technology, stating competition between Lucid and Tesla will be a \"two horse race.\"\\* In brief, the Lucid Air claims 1080 horsepower and 517 miles of range on the most energy dense powertrain to date. They offer a drag coefficient of 0.21\\*, bested only by the Mercedes EQS. They are looking to compete in the luxury EV sector with an eye for what they term as \"post-luxury,\" emphasizing sustainability and user experience over opulence\\*.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vjvtldyn53q71.jpg?width=1000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8dc3f908a5b18e043ea1a2041f5af479d07ec99a\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\u25b6 **TIMELINE** (picture version):\n\n* 2007 \u2013 Atieva founded (info)\n* Nov 2014 \u2013 ATVUS model first shown (pre-Derek Jenkins) (article)\n* July 2015 \u2013 Edna Atieva powertrain test car (video)\n* Nov 2015 - Atieva officially renamed Lucid Motors (article)\n* Dec 2015 - ATVUS redesign to Lucid Air begins\n* Aug 2016 - DIA award Formula E battery to Atieva (article)\n* Nov 2016 - Alpha fleet revealed at LA motor show (video)\n* Apr 2017 - NY Auto Show - first public display of the Air (video)\n* July 2017 - 235 mile/hour speed run record (video)\n* Aug 2017 - Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance (video)\n* Dec 2017 - Design moves into Ardenwood; Engineering move to temporary offices\n* Sept 2018 - Series D investment (PIF major funding) (article, press release)\n* Oct 2018 - Lucid announce agreement with Electrify America providing access to ultra-fast charging network (article)\n* Feb 2019 - Move to Gateway BLVD HQ in Newark, CA (video)\n* Apr 2019 - Peter Rawlinson  promoted to CEO (press release)\n* Dec 2019 - Breaking ground on Arizona AMP-1 factory (article)\n* Dec 2019 - Beta 2 fleet begin testing (video)\n* Feb 2020 - Lucid forges long-term cell partnership with LG Chem (article, press release)\n* Sept 2020 - Lucid Air makes fastest lap time at Laguna Seca (article)\n* Sept 2020 - 9/9 Event, official launch of Lucid Air\n* Oct 2020 - First studio opes in Beverly Hills, CA (article)\n* Jan 2021 - Awarded Formula E Gen3 Lucid front powertrain (article)\n* Jan 2021 - Bloomberg publishes C\\*\\*\\* rumor (article)\n* Jan 2021 - Michael Klein fireside chat with IPO Edge - SPAC rumors begin (video)\n* Feb 2021 - C\\*\\*\\*-Lucid Definitive Agreement.

Conceptually, every electric motor can be broken down into two primary components: the *stator* (outer housing) and the *rotor* (internal component). When an electric current is applied to coils lining the stator it generates a magnetic field, and when this current is phased the magnetic field begins to rotate. Magnets on the rotor are attracted to the rotating magnetic field causing the axle to rotate, thereby creating torque. As stated earlier these rotor magnets can be permanent (like Lucid and now Tesla) or electromagnetic. The latter is less efficient because it requires more wire \u2192 more resistance \u2192 more heat \u2192 decreased efficiency. By getting rid of that wire the permanent magnet motor takes up significantly less space and allows you to combine the inverter, transmission, differential and motor into a single smaller package. In Lucid's case this brings the weight of the entire assembly down to just 164 pounds. In conjunction with a proprietary cooling mechanism (axial jet cooling manifold) and a significant decrease to cogging torque this has allowed Lucid to create ***the most power-dense drive unit on the market*** at over 9 hp/kg (compared to Tesla's 3.2 hp/kg). That's ***280% more energy-dense than the nearest competitor.***\n\nLucid's highly efficient motor can deliver up to 670 hp and 2950 lb-ft of torque. The all-wheel-drive Air has two motors and delivers as much as 1,080 total hp with a 0-60-mph time of 2.5 seconds\\*. Check out the timeline above to see videos of their speed records.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***Battery***: Any manufacturer can add more batteries to an EV and increase its range, but this only increases weight and does nothing to improve efficiency (\"dumb range\"). To this end Lucid has been working to maximize its battery efficiency for almost 14 years. One of the most important parts of this is their adoption of a **900+ volt architecture**, the highest in the industry. Why does this matter? Because for the same amount of power a higher voltage system allows you to use lower current (V=IR). Lower current means less heat generated and therefore less total losses. This is based on the I2R principle, where if you x2 your current you x4 your losses. For comparison, Tesla utilizes a 350 volt architecture and would have to nearly triple the current to deliver the same amount of power as Lucid. Since Lucid uses lower currents they can use smaller cables, less wires and therefore less material mass while increasing the vehicle's efficiency. Lucid uses a total of 22 battery modules to make a complete pack, with each module producing around 42 volts for a total of 924 volts, in a package weighing around 1100 pounds total. Each module produces 5.1 kWh and with 22 of them it comes out to **113 kWh total**. This gives the Air an estimated **517 miles total range** (*EPA verification pending*) with an **efficiency of 4.6 miles/kWh**. This is the most efficient battery pack on the market, with Tesla following behind at 4.0 miles/kWh and other manufacturers even further behind still. Peter Rawlinson has stated in 2-3 years 4.8 miles/kWh is achievable, and up to 6.0 miles/kWh in a smaller vehicle format (future Lucid coupe?)\\*:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/742fsz2s53q71.png?width=2191&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ee54d570338efd1f787a0d4a97c5118525c0bc46\n\nHigher volt architecture also allows the battery pack to be charged more rapidly than Lucid's competitors at up to 300kW, gaining nearly **300 miles of range in just 20 minutes**. For comparison the Porsche Taycan has previously *advertised* up to 350 kW charging but their own website now only reports only up to 270kW\\*. The Tesla Model S Plaid offers up to 250 kW\\*.\n\nFor battery chemistry Lucid has a contract with LG Chem to be their exclusive battery cell supplier\\*. While the 2170-format cells are similar to those used by other EV manufacturers, Peter Rawlinson has stated that manufacturing a battery pack is 85% mechanical and only 15% chemistry. One innovative feature of Lucid's battery packs is utilization of end-cooling as opposed to side-cooling (like Tesla)\\*. Not only is this more efficient it allows them to pack individual cells more tightly and to better optimize total energy density.\n\nIt should also be noted that Lucid has supplied all the battery packs for Formula E racing since 2018 using the 18650-format cells\\*. This same technology powering Formula E will be driving you to KFC for the 4th time this week.\n\nSome have argued that 517 miles of range is irrelevant if you're only driving to and from work every day, however keep in mind increased range does not simply imply longer individual trips\u2014it also means less frequent charging. EV adoption has historically been tempered by *range anxiety*\u2014the fear of running out of charge during a long trip. This type of range significantly decreases that anxiety and offers greater mobility than almost any commercial ICE sedan.\n\n***Wunderbox***: Lucid calls this the heart of their electrical platform\\*. It allows compatibility with\u2014and the maximizing of\u2014charging systems of differing voltages, specifically boost-voltage charging. It enables a wide array of future-ready bi-directional power delivery features. These include vehicle-to-grid (V2G) compatibility for situations such as managing home power outages as well as vehicle-to-vehicle charging (V2V).\n\n***Dream Drive***: This is Lucid's Advanced Driver-Assistance System (ADAS). It's made up of 32 total sensors including ultrasonic, radar and an industry-first high-definition LIDAR system. There is also an internal camera system for driver monitoring and can take over in difficult situations. The Dream Drive system will be updated over the air and will deliver level 2 driving at launch. Level 3 driver assistance and geo-fenced HD mapping will be updated OTA shortly thereafter. For comparison Tesla has admitted their \"Full Self-Driving\" system is still level 2 under the definition of US authorities\\*. Nevertheless, I don't believe Lucid's intent here is to be the industry leader, and Peter Rawlinson has stated that true autonomous driving (levels 4-5) is still many years away. More information is available on Lucid's website\\*.\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/oafhgqbr53q71.png?width=2452&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dadc97bad09abd70b1ee188a949316f617e22f1b\n\n\u25b6 **VEHICLES AND TRIMS:**\n\n**Air sedan**: Lucid will start by offering the Air Dream Edition beginning this year (2021), with three additional trims being released sequentially over the next couple years. The Dream Edition is their top-of-the-line model and starts at a price of $161,500 (*after $7,500 tax credit in the US\\**). Future models step down in price to the $69,900 Air Pure. Each are compared in the following image:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*US tax credits are on the fence with the infrastructure bill right now\\*\n\n**Gravity SUV**: \"Project Gravity\" will be Lucid's entry into the lucrative SUV market\\*. Prototypes have already been built\\* using Lucid's Electric Advanced Platform (LEAP), the same modular platform upon which the Air is manufactured. Accordingly it should offer fairly similar specifications to that of its sedan sibling. The body will be a little wider than the Air but a good bit taller, seating up to 7 passengers. Production is expected to begin in 2H 2023.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jwmzid2t53q71.jpg?width=600&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b009d4938c971575d670084d7bd931e54aacf087\n\nProject Gravity SUV\n\n**Additional vehicles:** Lucid has future plans for an additional coupe and pickup truck by 2030\\*.\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\u25b6 **CHARGING:**\n\nCharging will be on the basis of Lucid-branded EV supply equipment as well as outside partnerships\\*. Lucid's own equipment will supply AC charging at 10-20 kW using their standard portable EV Supply Equipment (EVSE) versus an optional wall mount through an official Lucid-Installation partner, QMerit or an electrician of the customer's choice. Lucid community partnerships will be capable of AC charging up to \\~20kW and DC charging up to \\~300kW. *Every vehicle sold will come with three years of free charging through an Electrify America*, and will be compatible with networks leveraging J1772 and CCS charging standards such as ChargePoint and EVgo\\*.\n\nTesla's supercharger network has first-mover advantage but is highly capital intensive and limited to a legacy 400V maximum architecture, charging at 250 kW with the latest V3 units. Lucid's partnership with Electrify America is a much more CAPEX-light alternative and is compatible with 900V second-generation systems, charging at a maximum of 350 kW. It also uses the open-source CSS connector as apposed to Tesla's closed-source system.\n\nModern EVs are migrating to ultra high voltage architectures, eg, Porsche at 800V, Lucid at over 900V. Tesla systems and vehicles adopted 400V largely as a consequence of earlier technology.\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**\u25b6 PEOPLE:**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1bfkjqzt53q71.png?width=977&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=05b3d680faa5175e0bc8b9d67ad399fd31555f49\n\nLucid has collected an impressive roster of executive leadership, many of which with resum\u00e9s from some of Silicon Valley's most sought-after brands. An abbreviated biography is provided below, however the take-home point is the pedigree from which Lucid draws its talent. Companies such as **Apple, Intel, Waymo, Tesla, Audi, Ferrari** and **Ford** are represented and this positions Lucid well in terms of technical expertise and networking.\n\n**Peter Rawlinson** (CEO) - Born in South Wales, UK.

Prior to Lucid he gathered over 30 years experience between being the Principal Engineer at Lotus Cars, Head of Vehicle Engineering at Corus Automotive and VP of Vehicle Engineering at Tesla (Sept 2009 - Jan 2012)\\*. At Tesla he was the chief engineer of the Model S, responsible for its technical execution and delivery by improving both its structure and production\\*. Peter would later join Atieva in 2013 as their Chief Technology Officer before being promoted to CEO in 2019\\*. Elon Musk has publicly tried to downplay Peter's role at Lucid via Twitter\\*; however, this has been thoroughly verified and refuted\\*.\n\n**Sherry House** (CFO) - Sherry joined Lucid Motors as Chief Financial Officer in May 2021\\*. Prior to Lucid she was Treasurer and Head of Investor Relations at Waymo LLC, an autonomous driving technology company and subsidiary of Alphabet Inc (Google)\\*. She worked to guide the company's investments, acquisitions and external fundraising. She has an engineering background with BAs in Mechanical Engineering and Industrial Engineering, as well as an MBA and Masters of Manufacturing and Engineering.\n\n**Derek Jenkins** (Senior VP or Design and Brand) - Derek currently oversees all design developments including exterior and interior design, user experience, color and material, accessories and design strategy\\*. Before joining Lucid he was the Director of Design at Mazda North America Operations where he oversaw all design developments both locally and globally\\*. Prior to Mazda he was the Chief Designer for Volkswagen North America for 9 years, and was a designer for Audi in both Germany and the United States for eight years.\n\n**Eric Bach** (Senior VP of Product and Chief Engineer) - Eric has guided numerous vehicles to market for both Volkswagen AG and Tesla Motors\\*. At Tesla he oversaw several engineering functions for the Model S, Model X, and Model 3 programs. Under his leadership his teams successfully enabled the Model S and Model X programs to deliver pioneering engineering and technology solutions under vastly accelerated timelines when compared to the industry at large.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBesides executive positions Lucid currently employs over 2,000 people and has a 4.2 out of 5 score on Glassdoor.com\\*. There are currently 900+ job postings on their website indicating that they are growing very rapidly\\*, expecting more than 4000 total employees by next year\\*.\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\u25b6 **MARKET OPPORTUNITY:**\n\n**General EV market**: EV adoption is still very early. To draw an analogy, the growth of ICE automobiles per 1,000 people between 1900 and 1909 has a very strong correlation coefficient (98%) with the current growth of EVs between 2011 through 2020\\*. This growth will almost certainly continue due to multiple factors, including supportive government policies and regulations promoting EV adoption, increasing investments from OEMs, rising environmental concerns and the decreasing cost of batteries. Keeping this in mind EVs are in a strong position to cannibalize the $5 trillion automobile market, and there's little debate over long-term industry growth. We are only at the beginning of what looks to be a parabolic growth curve, and time in the market will almost certainly beat timing the market.\n\n**Luxury vehicle market**: In 2020 the EV market comprised 5% of all new car sales. Lucid is specifically targeting the luxury EV market which is expected to grow at a CAGR of 5%, from $496 billion in 2018 to $742 billion in 2026.\n\n**Total addressable market (TAM)**: For 2021-2022 Lucid anticipates the Air model to represent 2% of the total addressable EV market (*this number may change based on current commodities and chip markets*). By 2030 they estimate a run-rate production of &gt;500k vehicles, representing an estimated 4% of total market share.\n\n**Production volume**: Production is underway at Lucid\u2019s custom-built Advanced Manufacturing Plant (AMP-1) in Casa Grande, Arizona with deliveries starting in the next few months (2H 2021). Lucid will start by selling various trims of the model Air (see above), however Project Gravity (2023) and future models (2025+) will contribute to future production estimates as outlined below:\n\n* 2021 - 577 vehicles\n* 2022 \u2013 20,000 vehicles\n* 2023 \u2013 49,000 vehicles\n* 2024 \u2013 90,000 vehicles\n* 2025 \u2013 135,000 vehicles\n* 2026 \u2013 251,000 vehicles\n\n*Note: these forecasts were published in late May 2021*\\*. Lucid has since announced they are expediting phases 2 and 3 of their manufacturing plant into one combined phase, adding 2.7 million additional square feet of manufacturing space by 2023 and increasing production capacity to 53,000 vehicles by the same year\\*\\*\\*\\*. It is unclear how much this will affect production numbers in the years following but they would presumably increase.\\*\n\n**Revenue forecast**: Lucid is projecting 174% average annual total revenue growth, ramping from $2.2 billion in 2022 to 22.8 billion by 2026\\*. Current expectations are for a **positive EBITDA by 2024** and to be **free cash flow positive by 2025**\\*.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6mvvbpcv53q71.png?width=977&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a7e542a44f9994017ad9185655a64c2596e80f58\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\u25b6 **FUTURE DIRECTION:**\n\nPeter Rawlinson has said he sees three arms the Lucid Group of businesses: vehicles, electrical storage systems (ESS) and technology licensing. Vehicles are discussed above. Lucid has been developing an **electrical storage system** for some time and already has a working 300 kWh prototype at their headquarters in California\\*. They are also working towards larger pilot project at the Lucid vehicle manufacturing facility in Arizona (AMP-1). Batteries typically retain a charging capacity of around 70% once they\u2019re removed from EVs, which means they potentially have another decade of useful life\\*. Much like Tesla's home battery packs this will allow Lucid to further leverage their own expertise in battery module design targeting home, commercial and utility scale applications. Automakers like General Motors, Ford Motor, and Audi AG have also initiated second-life pilot projects.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ic5i9cuw53q71.jpg?width=1200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2e18a5a865422e50420de66ffd9720dbf8e96f3a\n\nAs a **technology supplier** Lucid already provides battery modules and software to all Formula E race cars (see above). In-house technology designed for mass production will position Lucid well for large scale supply to other OEMs. They advertise potential for a wide range of applications including aircraft, eVTOL, military, heavy machinery, agriculture and marine.\n\nLucid plans to expand into foreign markets in the near future, including Saudi Arabia as early as 2022\\* and European markets thereafter. Lucid likely has a contractual obligation to the former as part of its deal with Public Investment Fund (PIF), having invested over $2.9 billion into Lucid Motors in 2018\\*. If this continues as planned then total production volumes and revenues would significantly alter market opportunities and valuation estimates outlined above.\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\u25b6 **VALUATION ESTIMATE:**\n\n**Let's be honest this is probably the only reason you're here.** With that in mind Lucid is obviously a pre-production pre-revenue company, making an accurate estimation of its value both challenging and highly up to interpretation. One way we can approach this is by looking at its market capitalization, currently $35.1 billion at a share price of $21.67 (8/22/2021). With this in mind we can make the following comparisons:\n\n*CompanyValuation (8/22/2021)Total debtPrice-to-sales (P/S) ratio*Tesla (TSLA)$673.5 billion$11.1 billion (6/2021)\\*18.33\\*Toyota (TM)$226.8 billion$24.5 trillion (6/2021)\\*0.81\\*Volkswagen (VWAGY)$144.6 billion$219.2 billion (6/2021)\\*0.51\\*General Motors (GM)$70.8 billion$111.1 billion (6/2021)\\*0.51\\*Nio (NIO)$57.9 billion$2.7 billion (6/2021)\\*12.7\\*Honda (HMC)$50.7 billion$7.7 trillion (6/2021)\\*0.37\\*Ford (F)$50.2 billion$148.2 billion (6/2021)\\*0.37\\*Lucid (LCID)$35.1 billion$179 million\\*N/A \\*(see below)\\*Xpeng$30.8 billion$2.7 billion (3/2021)\\*N/ALi$27.1 billion$3.9 billion (3/2021)\\*N/AFisker (FSR)$3.9 billion$20.2 million (6/2021)\\*N/A\n\nThis is based on an LCID share count of 1.619 billion. However, assuming the company exercises all available warrants (*they are all ITM*) there will soon be 1.704 billion shares outstanding, raising the LCID market capitalization to $36.93 billion. With this in mind we can try to estimate LCID's current value based on their own revenue projections of $22.8 billion by 2026\\*. *If they meet this goal they are currently trading at 1.620 times future sales* ($36.93b/$22.8b). Since the market returns about 10% average per year we will assume a discount rate of 10% to bring future sales back down to present value. Given the term of 4.25 years (Sept 2021- Jan 2026) we can calculate LCID's net present value (NPV) as $15.2 billion\\*. *As a result this means* ***LCID currently trades at a P/S ratio of 2.4x*** ($36.93b/$15.2b).\n\nFor comparison you can see TSLA trades at 18.3x sales and Nio at 12.7x sales. LCID at 2.4x may very well be undervalued in this scenario. However both TSLA and Nio are currently selling cars for the 0 Lucid currently has on the road. Lucid does however have over 11,000 paid pre-orders of the Air, including the completely reserved $169k Dream Edition.\n\nWith this in mind we might be able to target a P/S ratio of let's say 5. The technology sector currently averages a P/S ratio of 7.52\\* so 5 seems more than fair. If that's the case then LCID has an upside potential of almost 106% (5/2.43). ***This would bring the share price to $44.64 with an estimated market capitalization of $76.1 billion.*** This is over a hypothetical 12 months but the rate is otherwise TBD. That may seem like a lot, but for a US manufacturer with the most efficient EV on the market I personally don't believe it is. This would put Lucid at a market capitalization close to the $70 billion being sought by Rivian for their IPO\\*.",

But is this really true? Can markets go anywhere but up?\n\nSo far since the beginning of 2020\n\nOil is up 103%\n\nGas 94 %\n\ncopper which is key in all our electronics is up 126%\n\niron the most used metal is up 150%\n\ncoffee is up 101%\n\ncorn is up 78%\n\nwheat 49%\n\nand sugar 87%\n\nThe housing market is up, the collectible market is up and the stock market does not look any different.\n\nThe S&amp;P 500 has recovered above pre covid levels and gained 100 % from the bottom all the while setting 43 all time highs year to date literally a new all time high every 3.5 days in 2021 and on track to beat the record of 77 yearly all time highs in 1995.\n\nRunning hot? Maybe a little... Or maybe the economy is just growing at a really fast pace? Looking at the ratio of market value to GDP however the markets are extended over a large margin to where they should be in relation to GDP.\n\nSo whats going on here? Are we really in an everything bubble that is going to pop and if so how can you invest so that you make money? Before we can answer these questions we need to understand what a bubble is.\n\nWhats a bubble\n\nA bubble is defined as an economic cycle characterised by a rapid increase in market value particularly of asset prices. It is commonly accepted that bubbles arise due to the psychology of investors. They can appear across single assets, asset classes or entire markets.\n\nBubble Cycles\n\nBubbles always follow more or less the same pattern as we will see when we look at some bubbles that have occurred throughout history. At first things start slow as the smart money and early adopters get in on the trade.\n\nMore and more professional investors start to pile in as the price starts to increase leading to awareness of the opportunity to rise until it breaks into the public.\n\nAs more and more people learn about the trade and jump in because of greed and fear of missing out price starts to really take off and run away from fundamental valuations. It is this stage where mass psychology gets more and more amplified feeding into itself leading to enthusiasm turning into greed and delusion as prices reach higher and higher.\n\nThe stock market is a zero-sum game the profits of one market participants are anothers losses. The more retail is buying the more profits the smart money are taking.\n\nThis then is one of the most telling signs of a bubble: retail investors coming in and pushing prices ever higher left to hold the bag when the smart money ultimately leads the market lower in taking all their profits.\n\nFamed investor Jim Chanos is warning about exactly this and just said in an interview with CNBC \u201cThe problem with getting more people, retail, involved is that it always seems to happen toward the end of every cycle. Retail wasn\u2019t there at \u201909 at the bottom. They weren\u2019t there in \u201902 after the dot-com bubble collapsed. They were certainly there at \u201999,\u201d- (Buying at the top that is) He goes on to say:\n\n\u201c(So) the problem in the last few cycles as I see it is that we get promotors and insiders and people who have done very well cashing out as retail is buying.\u201d\n\nPast bubbles and crashes\n\nLets take a look at some of these past bubbles to see how they stack up to where we are today.\n\nWhat is widely considered to be the mother of all bubbles became known in history as tulip mania. It is one of the prime examples showcasing how irrational behaviour leads to asset prices rising to unsustainable levels before they finally collapse.\n\nIn 1630 tulips which had only been introduced to Europe in the 1600's were starting to be perceived as special and rare. This prompted speculation in the tulip market shortly after leading prices to increase by 2000 % between November 1636 and February 1637 before plummeting by 99 % in May 1637. During this period of time some tulips were costing as much as a house clearly showcasing the disconnect from fundamental values and the greed and mania involved which are key characteristics of bubbles. One can't help but see the parallels in looking at prices that some digital or physical collectibles are commanding these days.\n\nCrxxptopunk and Axie Infinity are just two examples of NFT's that can cost much more than even the most lavish of mansions. The most expensive crxxpto punk so far has been sold for 8 million dollars. The most expensive NFT so far Beeple\u2019s, Everydays \u201d The First 5000 Days\u201d sold for a staggering 69 million dollars. But also many physical collectibles are commanding hefty premiums with the most expensive Pokemon card having been sold for 369.000 dollars. Almost a bargain in comparison to some NFT'S.\n\nWell to be fair though at least when the price of NFT's approaches its fair value somewhere closer to zero you will always still be the proud owner of your virtual good whereas the tulip will not only have lost its value but have withered away completely.\n\nJapan\n\nIn our modern time many speculative bubbles have been attributed to overly lax and stimulative financial policies of central banks. Japan's economic bubble of the 1980's is a prime example for this. After Japan entered a recession in 1986 the government countered with huge monetary and fiscal stimulus. The resulting free and abundend liquidity led to rampant speculation in the japanese stock and real estate market with prices increasing by 300 % between 1985 and 1989 and retail going all in. The bubble burst when the fiscal stimulus was withdrawn in 1991 ushering in what is now known as the lost decade due to slow economic growth and deflation. Today 30 years later the Japanese market is still trading below its 1991 highs.\n\nDot com bubble\n\nIn the 90s the internet was a rising star and with it many companies trying to commercialise its tremendous potential. Venture capitalists caught on early and in easy monetary conditions were throwing money at dot com startups. The public started catching on in 1995 and retail trading became more and more popular. Everybody was sure that there was nowhere but up for internet stocks no matter what they did or whether they even had revenues. In 1997 record amounts of capital flowed into the NASDAQ. New online brokers were making it more accessible for the average Joe to buy and sell shares and everybody was buying into the trade of a life time. At the height of the bubble their advertisements were showing that trading is an easy way to riches. Between 1995 and 2000 the NASDAQ rose by 500% from below 1000 to over 5000 points. When nobody was left to buy the bubble finally burst and the NASDAQ lost nearly 80%. At this point even blue-chip tech stocks like Intel were down by 80%. What followed was an extended bear market and a slow recovery. It should take until 2015 for markets to recover to previous levels.\n\nThe dot com bubble actually spawned another bubble on its own as investors fleeing stocks piled into the real estate market. This became known as the US housing bubble which in the mid 2000s collapsed leading to a worldwide economic crisis today known as the great recession.\n\nTo support the world economy during this time the central banks of the world started implementing quantitive easing basically increasing the money supply by lowering interest rates and purchasing assets in order to help the economy recover. At this point unprecedented amounts of money were newly created and injected into the economy. Shockingly this actually continued until 2018 when the US Fed started to taper its asset purchases which caused a liquidity crisis in the markets that after 10 years of a non stop FED powered rally were not prepared to come back to reality.\n\nAs we have seen these bubbles develop and burst over and over again following the same pattern. The reason for this is that financial markets like the whole bubble dynamic are entirely driven by human psychology which is best illustrated in the different phases of bubble or market cycles.\n\nWhere are we in the cycle\n\nFast forward to today.\n\nWe have been in a central bank induced bull market since we came out of the last recession in 2008. In 2020 COVID hit and as result the markets collapsed and millions of people lost their jobs as the world battled lockdowns that led to stores and factories closing.\n\nThe worlds central banks jumped in swiftly - injecting more liquidity into the system than ever before. They cut interest rates to zero and started large asset purchase programs in addition to the government relief programs handing out money to everybody.\n\nJust between March and June 2020 the money supply in the US increased by 300 % the largest spike ever. 40 % of all dollars in existence were printed within the last 12 months.\n\nThis flood of new free money quickly found its way into the stock markets since due to low interest rates lower risk assets are not yielding returns. Leaving investors no alternatives but to rotate to riskier higher yielding assets which today is known as TINA: there is no alternative.\n\nAs we have seen earlier this flood of money combined with supply chain shortages caused by Covid lead to rampant price inflation throughout different asset classes within a short amount of time. It sure looks like we are in bubble territory but where are we within the cycle?\n\nOne key characteristic of any bubble nearing its peak is the involvement of the general public or retail crowd. Therefor the degree to which retail investors play a part in the current boom cycle plays a key role in understanding where we are in the bubble. So what does the data tell us\n\nRetail participation in bubbles\n\nSince the beginning of the pandemic the amount of retail brokerage accounts opened has skyrocketed. Robin Hood now has 18 million users almost doubling their amount of users before the pandemic started. They introduced fractional shares allowing you to start investing with as little as 1 dollar. Their advertising message is everybody is an investor and I guess in a bubble everybody is. The interest for trading has spiked online and offline. You know its getting sketchy when your little niece asks you for stock tips.\n\n(Infamous wallstreetbets subreddit now has 11 million members up from only 800 k two years earlier. Wallstreetbets users were already gabmling /yoloing away their life savings and at some point even started finding ways to exploit the robin hood app in order to borrow more money to risk even more. When robinhood posted on wallstreetbets and asked users to stop doing this robinhood ended up being banned from the subreddit. Sure looks like a little mania going on.)\n\nBut there is not only more retail trading the new traders are also younger and more inexperienced. A large part of todays market participants has never even seen a market correction of more than 10 % let alone a true recession. It is no surprise than that these investors are overly optimistic and can not believe the market can go anywhere but up.\n\n(It sure seems though that history is set to repeat and most of the retail crowd will be left holding the bag instead of taking home the tendies. As an old saying on wallstreet goes:\n\n&gt;\u201cA man with money meets a man with experience. The man with the experience leaves with the money, while the man with money leaves with experience.\u201d)\n\nThe only thing more telling than the growing number of retail traders is the amount of money that has been flowing into the market.\n\nOver the last 25 years global equities had inflows of 727 billion USD cumulatively. Now hold on tight because this is truly crazy. Global equity inflows for 2021 annualized amount to 1.015 trillion USD. Yes thats right trillion not billion almost 300 billion more than have been flowing into the market over the last 25 years combined coming in in just one year. Over 80 % of these flows have gone into passive funds, ALL US, ALL LARGE CAP. At the same time margin debt has risen to historic highs as well. Market participants have never been this leveraged before.\n\nThese days in the light of the FED support there is only one mantra driving the crowd: buy the tulip uhhh... dip.\n\nCrash scenario\n\nIt seems then that retail is indeed all in or at least getting pretty close. Looking at these unprecedented huge inflows into equities and the retail trading frenzy it sure looks like we are in the last cycle of the bubble but how and when is it going to pop?\n\nThere are currently many challenges ahead that might trigger a bigger correction or crash leading to these bubbles to burst. Lower vaccine efficacy and the spread of the delta variant are impacting supply chains putting more pressure on already elevated prices and slowing down the Chinese economy. The FED starting to taper into a slowing recovery might as well be a recipe for the crash that we have been waiting for.\n\nBut whatever event is going to trigger the sell off every day\u00a0margin debt is growing the resulting margin call avalanche that will ensue is getting bigger and bigger making sure that whatever correction we will see will not be a small one and might even trigger a recession.\n\nHow to profit from this\n\nIt sure seems like the central banks are running out of options and it will be very interesting to see how they respond to this.\n\nSo when is this going to pop? It is very difficult to time market tops or bottoms due to the psychological nature of market cycles. As we have seen when looking at historic bubbles they can stretch on for years before they reach their peak. As they say on wallstreet: the market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent.\n\nIn the past the yield curve has been a great leading indicator to detect a recession ahead. Of course there is no guarantee this will be predictive again but there is a good chance since ultimately it is down to smart investor behaviour. In any case watch out for the yield curve inverting as a warning signal.\n\nNobody knows what event or chain of events will cause enough market participants to panic sell and trigger a crash. However being aware of these cycles and roughly what part of the cycle we are in allows you to manage your portfolio in a way that you can make money instead of loosing it. As promised lets look at how to do exactly that.\n\nLets assume that your portfolio is already well diversified. Now your goal is to maximise your profits and minimise your risk therefor you want to have liquidity available to buy into a crash and at the same time protect your existing portfolio from losses. There are different ways to do this but my preferred way is to keep taking profits on a regular basis on all my positions. The resulting profits are partly held in cash or liquid inflation protected assets and the other part is used to build a position that is going long volatility. The current market has very low volatility. The only way is up and there are only minute corrections to the downside that are immediately bought up. This means the VIX a measurement for volatility is trading at relatively low levels. A big correction or crash in the overall market will lead the VIX to spike up. Thus going long volatility while buying the VIX with futures, options or ETF's earns our portfolio excellent protection from the crash. If you balance the VIX position and your portfolio out correctly you can easily cover all losses with the VIX position all the while being liquid enough to buy into the crash in order to profit from the recovery that inevitably will ensue.",

If the reviews are good, I'm going big in Intel. There is usually a huge lag between a reviews of CPUs/GPUs to Wallstreet reacting. For example, AMD Zen2 was going to be a massive success if you read the reviews. Wallstreet didn't react until many months later. In addition, the government will keep Intel alive no matter what because they need a domestic chip manufacturer. Lookout for a ton of government subsidies to Intel.\n\nFor Qualcomm, I'm betting that their Nuvia acquisition will allow them to move into the laptop/desktop market but it's a small bet right now. Again, I will wait for reviews of their first Nuvia product before deciding if I want to buy more because of the lag between reviews and Wallstreet reacting.\n\nSo far, I've beaten S&amp;P500 last year and this year so far.",

ways to reduce water consumption in semiconductor manufacturing:\n\n* Transition from wet to dry etching\n* Improvements on the efficiency of etching processes used for ultrapure water (UPW) production\n* Optimization of tools and procedures for UPW production process\n* Reuse of spent rinse waters/wastewater streams\n\n**Technical Analysis**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/772aqq7nwno71.png?width=2668&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7319d506eb7da567c5ab1a86d4e4f1d08dc06e29\n\nLooking at the 6-month chart for TSM, strong resistance and support lines indicate a resistance around the $125 mark and solid support around the $108 mark. A buying opportunity may come up if we see TSM dip down near its support range. Bullish breakthrough at $125 and bearish breakthrough at $108.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe biggest issue the semiconductor industry faces today is heating. Semiconductor fabs use the water equivalent of 12 golf courses. The solution to this problem is dry etching which uses gaseous chemicals to make patterns on substrates. Large fabricators have their own methods for reusing water but to be frank, are only scratching the surface. TSM\u2019s Green Marketing Strategy does little to address the issue at hand. The semiconductor industry is expected to grow by 25% with water consumption expecting to increase by 15%. Aside from this issue, TSM has a comparative advantage over its rival Intel. TSM has a significantly higher market cap, lower total debt, and fewer liabilities. TSM doesn\u2019t pay out dividends but instead uses the money to grow its business. Intel has mediocre dividends at best. TSM will be a trillion-dollar company in the next 5-10 years. Biden\u2019s $50B subsidy plan will revamp production and should hopefully put the U.S in contention for the global semiconductor producer leader. TSMs new $100B fabs in Arizona will be a catalyst for domestic semiconductor production with growing support from U.S subsidies. TSM has a positive outlook for the next 3-4 years.\n\n*\\*\\*This is not investment advice. We are not experts.

        "selftext": "Good morning from London fellow value investors.\n\nHope you're all keeping good (and had a nice bank holiday if you're in the US) \ud83d\ude04.\n\nI have three questions, and would really appreciate your opinions/insights. (I am a law student - not a finance). Tell me if I what I am saying makes sense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***(1) Using the average S&amp;P 500 return as my discount rate.***\n\n  \\--- The discount rate, theoretically, is a measure of opportunity cost. As I understand it, the \"traditional\" approach is the risk-free rate (which would have been the 10 year treasury rate). For me, and I intend to be invested for the long-term, I regard the index as risk-free. There will be recessions and declines, but if you're invested in the ling-term; you can ride them out. In my head, it makes sense for me to use [the S&amp;P 500 average 50 years (1971-2020) return is 10.9% . Inflation adjusted is 6.8%](https://www.fool.com/investing/how-to-invest/stocks/average-stock-market-return/).\n\n\\--- **Question**: Does that sound right to you? If so, should I use the inflation adjusted or the nominal return? I think I should use the nominal because the average return is a calculation of each individual year? Am I right about that?\n\n***(2) Using the margin of safety to account for my risk premium as opposed to discount rate.***\n\n\\--- The book I am reading says that the discount rate should have an imbedded \"risk premium\" in the calculation.  But as a value investor, that's what the margin of safety is about, right?  In my head, the discount rate is basically me saying \"if I have the ability to invest my capital at, let's say, 10% elsewhere; what is this business worth to me?\". I then think about risk separately as a hedge in case I misjudge the business future economics, or as  windage-factor against  confirmation bias/overconfidence etc... And, demand 30%-50% depending on the upside-and-downside and my own estimation. In my mind, I don\u2019t really want to compensate for risk by increasing the discount rate. If I don't think I can intuit/infer the future free cash flows, then just pass.\n\n \\--- **Question**: How does that sound? What is your minimum margin? Do you think it's good to have one?\n\n***(3) I am having some trouble with WACC &amp; CAPM. Need some help here.***\n\n\\---- I think I understand the logic behind WACC but I don't think I get how or why it is valuable to me. I appreciate the logic of discounting the free cash flow at the weighted average cost of capital. Growth in the business will have to be funded by capital through either debt or equity. That makes sense but why should I accept a cost of debt and/or equity that is ultimately decided by the market? In basic terms, I don't really understand why I would look to the market - in terms of either the risk premium allotted to the company by the bond market, or the beta. Everyone talks about how past performance is no reliable indictor of future performance, and yet historical price volatility is meant to reflect some risk in the future? \n\nI am a bit lost here and would really love to hear from people who are experts who think WACC is useful to help me see what I am missing. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs I said, I am doing a lot of reading but I'm coming from a non-financial background.\n\nThank you all for your time. \ud83d\ude0a",

        "selftext": "This journey began for me with a random conversation. I was at a grocery store on my break from work and while I was looking at different Greek yogurts, I overheard a man say something I couldn\u2019t believe. I turned around and said \u201cSir\u2026 I\u2019m sorry, what did you just say?\u201d He introduced himself as the owner of the grocery store (locally owned in St.Pete/Clearwater FL area) the gentlemen proceeded to tell me that **last year he paid around $4,000 for a crate of food\u2026he said one year later, that same EXACT CRATE IS NOW $14,000.** This conversation was just 3 weeks ago. \n\nSo\u2026when I got into my car I had an idea. I wonder what the U.S. Dollar index is trading at\u2026I\u2019m sure it\u2019s bloody red (I assumed) what I saw literally made my jaw drop. I\u2019m not joking\u2026**at that time the U.S. dollar happened to be at a 9 month high.** I couldn\u2019t fucking believe it. At that moment I knew\u2026we had fucked up. https://imgur.com/a/tBVu4f1\n\nAfter already doing mini DD on why the U.S. dollar might fall just days before (just watching random videos on YouTube about Dr. Burry and stock shit) \n\nI immediately opened a position in my car to profit from this current situation. Which was call options in $TBT. An ETF with 2x inverse exposure on 20+ U.S Treasury bonds. In simple terms, this is a bet on hyperinflation. **I believe that the Federal Reserve WILL BE FORCED to raise rates (as that is their main tool in their toolkit to fight inflation) faster than ANYONE is anticipating. Which in turn would collapse bond prices.** Making the calls print. I currently have a small position right now.\n\nThe dollar index after J. POW\u2019s Jackson Hole Speech. \ud83d\ude02 https://imgur.com/a/hiN5OFy\n\nNow this brings me to the U.S. stock market. I sold all my stocks 2 days ago. I have long exposure in only one position currently. A $50/$80 call debit spread in VIAC. Simply put, if I\u2019m wrong and the market just keeps going, then the $350 I payed for spread will generate nearly $3,000 if VIAC is over $80 on expiration, which is in 2 years.\n\n                  Technical Analysis\n\nLet me start with my TA  first\u2026which is alarming. https://imgur.com/a/kmLCxPX \n\n**This was yesterday, Friday, September 3.**\n\nHere is one from Thursday, September 2.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/PE0F6F5\n\n**$SPY is at a critical resistance level\u2026I mean\u2026it literally is hitting the fucking roof here**\u2026 and with everything going on in the world\u2026you want more?!?? Sorry to burst your bubble\u2026but how was that even theoretically feasible? It\u2019s impossible in my opinion. \n\nLet me explain why\u2026\n\n              Updated GDP Forecasts\n\n**Am I literally the only one who saw on Thursday that Morgan Stanley updated their forecast for the third quarter GDP expectations??? Let me fill you in on a little secret\u2026THEY CUT THEIR FUCKING ESTIMATES BY MORE THAN HALF!!!!!**\n\nFor fucks sake people, **THIS IS HUGE!!** This is a quote from a brand new article literally posted 45 minutes ago from the Washington Post! \n\n**\u201cThe team at Morgan Stanley led by chief U.S. economist Ellen Zentner just slashed its forecast for gross domestic product growth this quarter to 2.9% from 6.5%.\u201d**\n\n**Gross domestic product is a key indicator of economic activity in the United States. So\u2026yeah we\u2019re fucked. Which in turn has an impact on some companie\u2019s future earnings\u2026 and we all know that Wall Street has extremely high expectations now\u2026** \n\n             Wall Street\u2018a High Expectations\n\nSo far, 88% of S&amp;P 500 companies have beaten earnings per share estimates for the second quarter of 2021, according to data provider FactSet.\n\nThe strong results put the S&amp;P 500 on track to be the best quarter for beats since FactSet started tracking the data in 2008. \ud83d\ude33 So\u2026. What happens if the economy literally comes to a stand still? Which in my opinion is slowly happening and what will happen. You could have a slow correction based on this alone, just on companies missing earnings\u2026.which I guarantee that will happen\u2026 it\u2019s going to be an earnings miss galore. \n\n                     Lumber/Gold Ratio\n\nSimply put, when lumber goes up that means people are building homes and buying homes and it is a metric of strong economic growth.\n\nWhen gold goes down (safe haven assest, less risk) that is associated with times where stocks and real estate are up, which makes them more attractive and gold less attractive.\n\n**So investors use this ratio to decide when to play offense and when to play defense while managing an active portfolio.**\n\nThis ratio calculates how many contracts of Lumber you can buy with an ounce of gold.\n\nGet it? Good. Now feast your eyes on this  https://imgur.com/a/dlpfsfZ \n\nI like this one better compared to the DOW 30. \nhttps://imgur.com/a/cvYyXsB\n\nThe lumber/gold ratio **HAS PLUMMETED** in the last 2 months\u2026literally fucking straight down. Which is a key indicator for an upcoming correction/crash. (Remember\u2026play defense)\n\nSide note: Lumber has gone up tremendously the last week because of the hurricane situation. But\u2026gold was up big this week as well\u2026and say prayers for the people suffering from Hurricane Ida.\n\n                Consumer Confidence\n\n**In simple terms, increased consumer confidence indicates economic growth in which consumers are spending money, indicating higher consumption.**\n\nSo\u2026for the month of July The Conference Board of consumer confidence which gets its data from a survey of about 3,000 households which asks respondents to rate the relative level of current and future economic conditions including labor availability, business conditions, and overall economic situation.\n\n**They reported 125.10 on the index for the month of July. Boy\u2026were they in for a surprise. The month of August has a consensus estimate of 123.0, the number was 113.9\u2026.a very surprising miss. I wasn\u2019t surprised at all to be honest with you.**\n\n\n                      Conclusion\n\n**Let me be clear\u2026I believe Jerome Powell with his magical money printer and rising inflation will be the reason the market falls, also the fact that the government is just handing out free money to every single person with excess stimulus, it\u2019s going to collapse our financial system possibly\u2026also with all the over leveraging you have the perfect brew of a shit storm. Also with rising delta concerns, the new variant \u201cMu\u201d and mass evictions will soon begin\u2026**\n\n**Since the start of 2013  the SPY has hit 329 all time highs. This is more than the epic run from 1989-2000 where SPY hit 327 all time highs.**\n\nNo big deal right? \n\n**This is a chart of the total assets held in all Federal Reserve Banks.** https://imgur.com/a/l8S1SYP\n\nNo big deal right?\n\n**Median American home prices have now surpassed the 2006 housing bubble peak.** https://imgur.com/a/KJ3KIsi\n\nNo big deal right? \n\n**I mean FOR FUCKS SAKES!!!! I literally could go on and on\u2026. But you get the point by now\u2026let\u2019s not forget the craziness in the Middle East right now, massive devastating storms crippling our country, rising food costs, I\u2019m sure gas will be very high soon. Also, expect to see companies raising their national minimum wage. YOU WILL SEE THIS TREND. Don\u2019t get me started on the mass evictions as well\u2026and the FED has been buying MORTGAGE BACKED Securities\u2026 The very financial instrument the collapse of economy in 2008.**\n\nNow\u2026**my positions.** Take this into consideration\u2026 I\u2019m 28 years old and I have about $4,000 combined in all of my different portfolios. I may or may not have just got out of prison 9 months ago after completing a 5 year prison sentence. So\u2026Not financial advice. \n\n**Short term:** sold 4 different Call options on SPY via call credit spreads. \n$455/$456 9/15 exp- 2 sold\n$456/457 9/13 exp- 2 sold\n\nBought 3 $10 puts in $BFI 9/17 exp \n\n**Long term:**\n\nOne $13 call option in $HIBS (this security blew up 200%-300% in the span of days during the covid crash)\nIt basically shorts TSLA and other ridiculous growth stocks\u2026 I looked at their top 10 holdings and like seven out of 10 of them are at all time highs lol. \n\n2 calls in $TECS $5 strike price. 1/21/22 exp. This is a 3x bear inverse of tech stocks. It\u2019s holdings are like AAPL and MSFT. I want to short stocks that are trading at all time highs. Because when this house of cards finally crumbles they will fall the hardest. **There WILL BE MARGIN CALLS.** You can bet on that. \n\n1 call option in $TBT exp 1/20/23 (hyperinflation bet/Fed raising rates quicker)\n\nOne $50/$80 call debit spread in $VIAC \nExp. 1/22/23 (long exposure to act as my hedge if by some divine miracle I\u2019m wrong) \n\n**My last position:**\n\n**$2,500 in Cash.**\n\nSimply put\u2026**cash is a position.** People seem to forget that. And I will simply buy the dip in my favorite companies\u2026 my choice of extremely cheap shares. Trust me\u2026 I already have my shopping list ready. \n\nGood luck out there guys. **Timing this is almost impossible**\u2026but my timeline is within 6 months we will experience at least a 15% correction if not a full blown apocalyptic market crash. It\u2019s hard to really assess the damage on how bad it will be. And for those who refuse to take the needle out of their arms, enjoy getting margin called and losing all of your money!\n\n**The company PLTR has positioned themselves for what they call a \u201cBlack swan event\u201dby purchasing $50 million in solid gold bars.Not gold ETFs. Solid gold bars\u2026Let me remind you that they deal with information.**\n\nI\u2019m not saying you should sell all of your stocks like me, I\u2019m saying that maybe it\u2019s time to scale back a bit on the margin, move some money into cash and maybe sell some of those positions that are up big. Don\u2019t forget Sleepy Joe is going to raise long term capital gains tax, possibly very soon, from like 20% to as high as 43.4% if you make over $1m\u2026 another bearish catalyst for the market\u2026 I literally could go on and on guys\u2026. It\u2019s pretty obvious at this point\u2026we\u2019ll at least to me, but what do I know, I just got out of prison last December. \n\nEdit:\nTLTR: just read the bold shit\u2026",

At that moment I knew\u2026we had fucked up. https://imgur.com/a/tBVu4f1\n\nAfter already doing mini DD on why the U.S. dollar might fall just days before (just watching random videos on YouTube about Dr. Burry and stock shit) \n\nI immediately opened a position in my car to profit from this current situation. Which was call options in $TBT. An ETF with 2x inverse exposure on 20+ U.S Treasury bonds. In simple terms, this is a bet on hyperinflation. I believe that the Federal Reserve WILL BE FORCED to raise rates (as that is their main tool in their toolkit to fight inflation) faster than ANYONE is anticipating. Which in turn would collapse bond prices. Making the calls print. I currently have a small position right now.\n\nNow this brings me to the U.S. stock market. I sold all my stocks 2 days ago. I have long exposure in only one position currently. A $50/$80 call debit spread in VIAC. Simply put, if I\u2019m wrong and the market just keeps going, then the $350 I payed for spread will generate nearly $3,000 if VIAC is over $80 on expiration, which is in 2 years.\n\n                  Technical Analysis\n\nLet me start with my TA  first\u2026which is alarming. https://imgur.com/a/kmLCxPX \n\nThis was yesterday, Friday, September 3. \n\n$SPY is at a critical resistance level\u2026I mean\u2026it literally is hitting the fucking roof here\u2026 and with everything going on in the world\u2026you want more?!?? Sorry to burst your bubble\u2026but how was that even theoretically feasible? It\u2019s impossible in my opinion. \n\nLet me explain why\u2026\n\n              Updated GDP Forecasts\n\nAm I literally the only one who saw on Thursday that Morgan Stanley updated their forecast for the third quarter GDP expectations??? Let me fill you in on a little secret\u2026THEY CUT THEIR FUCKING ESTIMATES BY MORE THAN HALF!!!!! \n\nFor fucks sake people, THIS IS HUGE!! This is a quote from a brand new article literally posted 45 minutes ago from the Washington Post! \n\n\u201cThe team at Morgan Stanley led by chief U.S. economist Ellen Zentner just slashed its forecast for gross domestic product growth this quarter to 2.9% from 6.5%.\u201d \n\nI can\u2019t make this shit up. I started writing my DD before they posted that article, before that you could only find a Seeking Alpha article that you have to pay to read\u2026 I discovered this off of my live updates of Bloomberg news. I\u2019m actually having trouble trying to find the article I originally read\u2026I wish I was joking. Whatever\u2026weird. \n\nGross domestic product is a key indicator of economic activity in the United States. So\u2026yeah we\u2019re fucked. Which in turn has a DIRECT impact on companie\u2019s future earnings\u2026 and we all know that Wall Street has extremely high expectations now\u2026\n\n                     Lumber/Gold Ratio\n\nSimply put, when lumber goes up that means people are building homes and buying homes and it is a metric of strong economic growth.\n\nWhen gold goes down (safe haven assest, less risk) that is associated with times where stocks and real estate are up, which makes them more attractive and gold less attractive.\n\nSo investors use this ratio to decide when to play offense and when to play defense while managing an active portfolio.\n\nThis ratio calculates how many contracts of Lumber you can buy with an ounce of gold.\n\nGet it? Good. Now feast your eyes on this  https://imgur.com/a/dlpfsfZ \n\nThe lumber/gold ratio HAS PLUMMETED in the last 2 months\u2026literally fucking straight down. Which is a key indicator for an upcoming correction/crash. (Remember\u2026play defense)\n\nSide note: Lumber has gone up tremendously the last week because of the hurricane situation. But\u2026gold was up big this week as well\u2026and say prayers for the people suffering from Hurricane Ida.\n\n                Consumer Confidence\n\nIn simple terms, increased consumer confidence indicates economic growth in which consumers are spending money, indicating higher consumption.\n\nSo\u2026for the month of July The Conference Board of consumer confidence which gets its data from a survey of about 3,000 households which asks respondents to rate the relative level of current and future economic conditions including labor availability, business conditions, and overall economic situation.\n\nThey reported 125.10 on the index for the month of July. Boy\u2026were they in for a surprise. The month of August has a consensus estimate of 123.0, the number was 113.9\u2026.a very surprising miss. I wasn\u2019t surprised at all to be honest with you. \n\n\n                      Conclusion\n\nLet me be clear\u2026I personally don\u2019t believe the delta variant has anything to do with this. I don\u2019t want to get politics involved in this post but it is imperative for me to do so but if I do I\u2019ll go down the rabbit hole in the post will probably get taken off. \n\nSince the start of 2013  the SPY has hit 329 all time highs. This is more than the epic run from 1989-2000 where SPY hit 327 all time highs. \n\nNo big deal right? \n\nThis is a chart of the total assets held in all Federal Reserve Banks. https://imgur.com/a/l8S1SYP\n\nNo big deal right?\n\nMedian American home prices have now surpassed the 2006 housing bubble peak. https://imgur.com/a/KJ3KIsi\n\nNo big deal right? \n\nI mean FOR FUCKS SAKES!!!! I literally could go on and on\u2026. But you get the point by now\u2026let\u2019s not forget the craziness in the Middle East right now, massive devastating storms crippling our country, rising food costs, I\u2019m sure gas will be very high soon. Also, expect to see companies raising their national minimum wage. YOU WILL SEE THIS TREND. \n\nNow\u2026my positions. Take this into consideration\u2026 I\u2019m 28 years old and I have about $4,000 combined in all of my different portfolios. I may or may not have just got out of prison 9 months ago after completing a 5 year prison sentence. So\u2026Not financial advice. \n\nShort term: sold 4 different Call options on SPY via call credit spreads. \n$455/$456 9/15 exp- 2 sold\n$456/457 9/13 exp- 2 sold\n\nBought 3 $10 puts in $BFI 9/17 exp \n\nLong term: \n\nOne $13 call option in $HIBS (this security blew up 200%-300% in the span of days during the covid crash)\nIt basically shorts TSLA and other ridiculous growth stocks\u2026 I looked at their top 10 holdings and like seven out of 10 of them are at all time highs lol. \n\n2 calls in $TECS $5 strike price. 1/21/22 exp. This is a 3x bear inverse of tech stocks. It\u2019s holdings are like AAPL and MSFT. I want to short stocks that are trading at all time highs. Because when this house of cards finally crumbles they will fall the hardest. There WILL BE MARGIN CALLS. You can bet on that. \n\n1 call option in $TBT exp 1/20/23 (hyperinflation bet/Fed raising rates quicker)\n\nOne $50/$80 call debit spread in $VIAC \nExp. 1/22/23 (long exposure to act as my hedge if by some divine miracle I\u2019m wrong) \n\nMy last position:\n\n$2,500 in Cash.\n\nSimply put\u2026cash is a position. People seem to forget that. And I will simply buy the dip in my favorite companies\u2026 my choice of extremely cheap shares. Trust me\u2026 I already have my shopping list ready. \n\nGood luck out there guys. Timing this is almost impossible\u2026but my timeline is within 6 months we will experience at least a 15% correction if not a full blown apocalyptic market crash. It\u2019s hard to really assess the damage on how bad it will be. And for those who refuse to take the needle out of their arms, enjoy getting margin called and losing all of your money!",

It is an actual product that they are track testing and showing off at the IAA Mobility Conference in Germany. Look at the live demo they have up vs. our competitors: \n\n* Luminars Lidar Live Demo: [https://streamable.com/c8v23x](https://streamable.com/c8v23x)\n* Continental Lidar Live Demo: [https://streamable.com/gyee85](https://streamable.com/gyee85)\n* Velodyne Lidar Live Demo: [https://streamable.com/lhtsw2](https://streamable.com/lhtsw2)\n* Microvision Live Demo: [https://streamable.com/paywxe](https://streamable.com/paywxe)\n\nAs you can see by the point cloud and refresh rate MVIS sure looks best in class. MVIS is currently on the path of scaling for production and looking for partners.\n\nMarket Size - The global lidar market size is projected to reach **$6.77 Billion by 2026** and virtually every car company is investing/looking to utilize Lidar in the future for assisted and automated driving. It could be in every new vehicle. Luminar (LAZR) the inferior product as you can easily see by the videos above IPO'd last year with a market cap of $8.1 Billion.\n\n**AR/VR** \\- Microvision produces the MEMS Laser Beam Scanning display engine found in the Microsoft Hololens 2. It was confirmed through a tear down before and just officially via MVIS's last ASM. Also, since Microsoft produces the IVAS (rugged Hololens 2 for military use) it is highly speculated that MVIS is the engine inside that also.  \n\nMarket Size - According to a comprehensive research report by Market Research Future (MRFR), \u201cGlobal AR and VR Market information By Technology, By Component, By Device Type and Vertical - Forecast till 2027\u201d the market to reach **USD 766 billion by 2025.** Also, Microsoft just won an army contract this year **worth up to $21.9 Billion.** \n\nGoogle the Hololens 2 or IVAS units to see all the cool futuristic shit they can do. I'm not gonna spoon feed you everything.\n\n**Stock Info**\n\nCurrent Market Cap = $2.24 Billion\n\n52 Week High = $28\n\n52 Week Low = $1.38\n\nEstimated Short Interest = 29.75m or 18.29% of FF\n\n Q2 2021 shares held by institutions: **42,174,027 (25.7%)** \n\n**Summary**\n\nSince Sumit Sharma took over as CEO he continues to deliver on his promise to increase shareholder value. The company is open for a buyout, strategic alternative, or going it alone with it's amazing technology. Whatever will be the best route to **INCREASE SHAREHOLDER VALUE**. At it's current share price we are way **UNDERVALUED.** There is more DD out there on the technologies, different verticals, and how we are at an inflection point for these things to pop. Go look at the MVIS subreddit and the meta thread there of DD I can't link.",

        "selftext": "So, Alibaba is of course the most discussed stock in the last month on this sub, I think. So I decided to discuss Tencent, instead.\n\nI think Tencent is simply incredible. Let's see why:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **WeChat** \n\nThey own WeChat/Weixin (Weixin is for mainland China, WeChat for everywhere else. I will call it WeChat). WeChat is.. WeChat. Mohnish pabrai calls it \"a bazooka Tencent can fire at will\". It has 1.25 billion users. What can you do on WeChat? Everything. Text, pay for stuff, play games, shop online, anything. Imagine if the following app existed:\n\n* Need something on Amazon? No problem, you can do it directly from WeChat through its mini-app.\n* Need to pay something in a shop? Use TenPay.\n* Need a ride on Uber? Use WeChat mini-app.\n* Need to order food on DoorDash? WeChat.\n\nReplace Amazon with JD, Uber with Didi, DoorDash with Meituan, and you have WeChat. \n\nWeChat is a bazooka beause, if Tencent decides to partner with someone and allows them to integrate in their ecosystem, that business will explode. It happened with Pinduoduo, which mainly works on WeChat: it grew 100% last year.\n\nSince it runs the platform, Tencent gets a commission. Also, it stores all the data that goes through these apps. In 2020, revenue from WeChat was 16.7 billion dollars, out of 74.6 billion in total. WeChat has 3.2 million mini programs on its platform, which transacted 1.6 trillion RMB (247 billion $) in 2020. To get how much this thing is growing, in 2017 it was 210 billion RMB (32b).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Tencent's empire**\n\nTencent has an impressive number of businesses: they have a subscription revenue which is 62% that of Netflix; a media ads business (bigger than the Nyt), games, cloud, mobile payment services. Their business is so wide it is hard to navigate. Some examples:\n\n1. **Gaming**: Tencent has around 50% of market share in China in the mobile gaming industry. In 2020 they made 29.3 billions from games. In 2021 it is probably going to be lower. Online gaming industry in 2020 was 58b, it is expected to grow to 86b in 2027. Mobile gaming is projected to be 70% of the online gaming market in China by then.\n2. **TenPay**: There are two ways to pay for stuff in China: TenPay and AliPay. While in the West switched from cash to cards, and are still in transition, China has skipped a step and went directly to mobile payments. In 2018 already, a walloping 83% of all payments in China were made through mobile. Now it is around 90%. Cards are useless, in China: they account for less than 5% of payments. In the Western world, Google pay and Apple Pay are only now eroding the empire of Visa, Mastercard, American Express etc. China, on the other hand, was to Tencent and Alibaba like a smooth field: they just took over. Apple pay now has around 500 million users world-wide. Tencent has 900 millions. From the last financial report, Tencent shows that revenue of the financial technology and corporate services business increased by 40% year-on-year to RMB 41.9 billion (6. billions). China's mobile payment market is projected to reach 88.4 Billion usd by the year 2027, trailing a CAGR of 47.3%.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Tencent's fantastic portfolio**:\n\nBefore you do a cf analysis of Tencent, you need to know that Tencent has a portfolio that is currently valued around 250 billions usd at present. It is like a financial version of Cthulhu, with tentacles everywhere. It is quite hard to navigate/find information about it. They say they are currently invested in over 700 companies, of which only 103 are publicly traded. This guy has put up a [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1owpL6WmMK30X19Kw3BziAw39rGJbsfIMOOexdtvAkxU/edit) for you that tracks the most notable public ones.\n\nSome notable busineness Tencent owns (percentages might not be accurate):\n\na) Gaming:\n\n* 100% Riot Games (League of Legends)\n* 40% Epic Games (Fortnite)\n* 81.4% Supercell (Clash of Clans)\n* 10% BlueHole (PUBG)\n* 80% Grinding Gear Games (Path of Exile)\n* 5% Activision Blizzard.\n* 20% Kingsoft (gaming competitor in China &amp; cloud business)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nb) Finance:\n\n* 30% Webank (biggest online bank in China)\n* 2%? Khatabook (digital payments in India)\n* 25% Gojek (same in Indonesia)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nc) Social:\n\n* 50.1% Huya (twitch-like)\n* 38% Douyu (twitch-like)\n* 12% Snapchat\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nd) Music:\n\n* 58% Tencent music\n* 6.8% Spotify\n* 10% Universal music group\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ne) E-commerce:\n\n* 25% Sea ltd (which also makes games, does mobile payments etc)\n* 18% JD\n* 17% Pinduodo\n* 7% Vipshop\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nf) Other\n\n* 20% Meituan (Doordash of China)\n* 15% Nio (ev)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Valuation**\n\nHow do you value Tencent? Currently, Tencent has a market cap of 619.72b, with a P/E of 24 and P/fcf (trailing 12 months) of 22 (Do not forget the investment portfolio, as well). fcf grew 29.4% a year in the last 10 years. Tencent has Microsoft-style profit margins of 35%. Revenue is growing at more than 30% a year, which is insane for a company this size. With its impressive portfolio, Tencent is poised to have a leading role in a country that is growing it GDP at 7%, that soon will catch up with the US, and where around 500 million people are projected to reach middle class in the next 10 years, something which will benefit tech companies the most. Of course, the risks are China regulations, in particular its anti-monopoly campaign; China in general: VIE structure, accounting standards etc. Here is an earnings based model, but take it with a grain of salt. \n\nDiscount rate: 14%. Based on eps without nri. 20 years.\n\n* Best scenario (20%): year 1-10: 25% growth, y 10-20: 10%. Value: 112.13\n* Normal scenario (60%): y1-10: 18%; y10-20: 10%. Value: 70.38\n* Worst scenario (20%): y1-10: 15%. y10-20: 8%. Value: 55.27\n* Fair value: 75.7\n* current price: 64.56.

        "selftext": "A recurring theme over the past year has been one \u2018expert\u2019 after another bashing index funds calling them a massive bubble that is waiting to pop. \u00a0 \n\n[ ](https://i.redd.it/z8f8yutkpvl71.gif)\n\n&gt;Could Index Funds Be \u2018Worse Than Marxism\u2019? \u2013 [The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/04/the-autopilot-economy/618497/)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;This \\[index funds\\] is very much like the bubble in synthetic asset-backed CDOs before the Great Financial Crisis. It will be the Greatest Speculative Bubble of All Time in All Things \u2013 [Michael Burry](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/09/04/the-big-shorts-michael-burry-says-he-has-found-the-next-market-bubble.html)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Is Passive Investment Actively Hurting the Economy? - [The New Yorker](https://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/is-passive-investment-actively-hurting-the-economy)\n\nBut at the same time, we have investors like Warren Buffet who still swear by a low-cost index fund and recommends it over his own Berkshire Hathaway stock! So, in this week\u2019s issue, we analyze both sides of the argument and see if we \\[1\\] should be worried about the index fund bubble!\n\n**The Problem**\n\nThe argument against the index fund is a logical one. The basic premise is that index funds affect the price discovery of stocks in the market. If a stock is bid up just based on the presence in an index and not by analyzing the underlying asset, then it can lead to a bubble-like scenario where you are buying more and more just because the asset prices are going up.\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/a04wyrgmpvl71.png?width=1260&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1693f22d16deb337345e5accb8f360de959707a7)\n\nIf you look at the above chart, you could see that in the first 4 months of 2021, a fund inflow of more than $20 Billion occurred just to the Vanguard 500 index fund. There are arguments stating that in the US, index funds make up [more than 50% of the fund market.](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/04/the-autopilot-economy/618497/) (This exponential growth is not a surprising one given my last analysis showed that passive funds have summarily beaten active funds over the last 2 decades)\n\nIf you think about this, more than half of the money that is flowing into the market is now just buying stocks that are on an index without doing any underlying stock analysis. The problem becomes that companies get more and more investment just because they are big and not because of their future growth prospects. So the question becomes\n\n**Is the index fund affecting the integrity of the stock market?**\n\nThe problem with the fund inflow statistics is that stock price is not decided solely based on fund inflow but majorly by trading.\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/cjlyt4unpvl71.png?width=629&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=67be6be3b3604712dd017a823da8aee69116019e)\n\nIf you look at this [study done by Vanguard](https://personal.vanguard.com/pdf/ISGBEL.pdf) \\[2,3\\], it destroys the price discovery argument. It shows that only 5% of the overall trading volume is captured by index funds. The rest of 95% of trading is made by active traders, pension funds, and institutional investors who do individual stock analyses.\n\nAdding to this, even if the index funds become large enough to create significant price distortions, it\u2019s something that the active fund managers can benefit from as it would give them more opportunities to short overvalued companies and create outsized returns. The fact that it\u2019s not happening right now shows that we are not anywhere near a situation where the index fund is big enough to fundamentally alter the market\\[4\\].\n\nNow that we know that index funds are not causing any price distortions, one has to wonder\n\n**why there is a sudden rise in concerns regarding an index fund bubble over the past 2-3 years?**\n\nI believe that this issue is being brought up by institutions and active fund managers as there is a drastic shift from active to passive management over the last few years.\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/pq1b3fbppvl71.png?width=713&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=699fc8dd9d5f2dee76f47e6f02763c8b352084b6)\n\nThe above chart from Morningstar showcases that active funds on average lost more than $150B every year over the 2014-18 period and this trend is only becoming worse for the active funds. This trend is also replicated worldwide with more than $300B is pulled out of active funds and $500B is pushed into index funds every year (as of 2016).\n\nFinally, as of 2019, for the first time, more money is being pushed into passive than active funds! All of this must be ringing alarm bells across active funds as their income is directly dependent on the total asset under management.\n\n**Alternatives to index funds**\n\nWhile researching this topic, I came across some genuine concerns about index funds. The most important of them being that you might not be as diversified as you expect investing in an index fund.\n\nAs of Aug 2021, the top 5 tech stocks (AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, AMZN &amp; FB) account for more than 23% of the S&amp;P500! While this worked out great for the overall index over that last decade given the tech rally, any long-term downturn for tech stocks will significantly affect your portfolio.\n\nThere are two alternatives that I found to the regular market cap based index fund allocation\n\n[Equal-weighted index funds](https://www.lynalden.com/equal-weighted-index-funds/): Equal-weighted index fund allocates your capital equally across the stocks in the given index. For Eg. in S&amp;P500 index, all the 500 companies would get an equal proportion of your index. This will avoid your portfolio becoming concentrated on a few highly overvalued stocks!\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/ikn5px2rpvl71.png?width=615&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ff145127fe86a728e0ebd0663d8566341163aa3a)\n\n[Reverse weighted index funds:](https://www.etftrends.com/smart-beta-channel/an-etf-that-beats-sp-500-by-turning-it-upside-down/) This one is for the more adventurous, where the investments are made by turning S&amp;P500 upside down on its head! The smallest companies on the list get the largest share of investment! Even though this reduces your exposure to large tech stocks and blue-chip companies (which get a lot of attention and is possibly overvalued), your investments will be concentrated on smaller companies that are inherently volatile and can produce outsized returns! Even though this strategy has beaten the traditional index returns, you still have to consider that this type of fund was introduced [just two years ago](https://www.barrons.com/articles/sp-500-index-fund-reverse-weighting-51557430544).\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nI believe that the index fund bubble narrative is over-blown and is being predominantly driven active fund managers who are trying to stop losing their business to the passive funds every year. All the data from our research shows that we are nowhere near a situation where index funds can alter the price discovery in any significant way!\n\nWhile the index fund bubble might be getting undeserved attention, it's always a good thing to check if you are comfortable with the current skewness of your portfolio towards tech stocks. After all, the tech rally over the last decade has undoubtedly benefitted all our portfolios, but we should also be ready for when the party inevitably comes to a close!\n\nUntil next week :)\n\n**Footnotes**\n\n\\[1\\] This is the first time in an analysis where I cannot claim to be unbiased as a substantial portion of my portfolio (&gt;90%) is tied up in an index fund. So take all the arguments with a grain of salt!\n\n\\[2\\] *Setting the record straight: Truths about indexing* is an excellent study done by Vanguard in 2018 where they review the rationale for indexing\u2019s efficacy, quantify the benefits of indexing to investors, clarify the definition of indexing, and explore the validity of claims that indexing has an adverse impact on the capital markets.\n\n\\[3\\] This study also showcases that ETF trading (creation/redemption mechanism of exchange-traded funds (ETFs)) has minimal impact on the underlying securities as only 6% of the trading is involved in primary market trading with the rest being in the secondary market.\n\n\\[4\\] This is also known as the Grossman-Stigliztz paradox:- There would be a point where indexing would become big enough to affect price discovery, then active managers would be able to profit off that, and more and more people would move to the active funds. Finally, in an efficient market, an equilibrium point would be reached where neither party (index funds or active fund managers) would be able to beat each other.",

Everything that requires a button in your car, fire stick remote controller, xbox controller, keyboard etc... requires a semi conductor.\n\nThe problem with the vehicle shortage is that the vehicle manufactures planned to schedule less chips in February 2021 for the vehicles of 2021 sales. They thought they would sell less vehicles this year because of the Covid, however, earlier this year, things opened and mask came off.  The car manufactures decided to instead order the same amount of chips as they usually do yearly, but the orders were already booked for other manufactures that needed chips. This is why you dont see a shortage in Smart phones, and computers, or TVS. The chip factories are producing chips for them first now before they can produce for car manufactures. It isn't because of a covid factory shut down...\n\nThis gives me reason to believe that demand will only increase for Semi Conductors and since TSM holds the most market in this area and they can generally control pricing. \n\nThis shows that the demand of current electrical devices int he world is actually far greater than we expected!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSolid LongTerm Lifetime investment company\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*At todays share price on September 3rd, 2021*\n\n*The P/E Ratio of TSM is 32X* \n\n*Apple P/E Ratio is 29X*\n\n*Microsoft P/E ratio is 37X*\n\n*Tesla P/E ratio is 170X*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Average analyst target of $147/share.*\n\nHigh of $200 and Low of $105\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n TSMC formed in 1987, located HQ in Hsinchu, Taiwan.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5xnxfeghadl71.jpg?width=700&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=439f443755a78bf1d3196f0dbf40094a440d3308\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1on5sfgiadl71.jpg?width=881&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=daec6d79172b837788407a8a9aa424e314dc045c\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qyjqrmekadl71.jpg?width=280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7d23b13907924b9618d8f9def091308fbe0b0227\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dm7llfz59dl71.png?width=2388&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c0f312c9e543ffed4b23af9e395ced2ee39513dd\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f5o61y339dl71.jpg?width=1440&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2b523709807728fb9e2e3493a8049ab218f24da6\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/um88hin29dl71.jpg?width=1504&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5552a028558c76441675d3bec3cedb4a722e5cd1\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wv6gsi509dl71.jpg?width=1440&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0f984f64edabdb85ef83e3ae665395b55e299a0b\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vwgxhayfcdl71.jpg?width=2119&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a610a0371e7d27e6506ddec9a2f3ffbdea533bd2\n\nToday i bought 100 calls, (2 days after earnings) purchase and am expecting more long term purchased investments into this company.

        "selftext": " \\*\\*\\*Disclaimers &amp; Disclosures: This article is meant for discussion and entertainment purposes only. The following is not investment advice, nor a recommendation to buy or sell any security/investment. Investments always carry risk, so DYOR.\n\nWe are traders &amp; private investors who see the value of Reddit in creating and growing an investing community.\n\nStocks included in this article: WBA, AAPL, MSFT, GS, CVS, RAD, WMT, TGT, UNH, CI, DG, JNJ, PG, AMZN, BRK/A, BRK/B.\n\nWe are long WBA.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWalgreens ($WBA) is a safe and cheap stock, selling at a discount, with an improving underlying business, and ripe for a buyout. In addition to a healthy 4% dividend, Walgreens is also a major potential takeover target in the healthcare/pharmaceutical space. Selling at attractive valuations, and as both a Dow component and a best-of-breed player in the pharmacy business, we think Walgreens represents a huge investment opportunity. Furthermore, with cheap valuations, a low Beta, and lower correlation to the broader market, we believe WBA is a top defensive play &amp; income producer, and could be added as a core position to anyone\u2019s portfolio. Including WBA in your portfolio is highly likely to reduce overall portfolio volatility and risk, and improve your performance.\n\n**Our price target for $WBA is $74, an upside of approximately 50%.**\n\nBelow are the 6 main reasons we\u2019re bullish on WBA.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**1)** **WBA is a Dow component.**\n\nWalgreens stock ($WBA) is a Dow component. As one of only 30 stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (the oldest and most historically-followed U.S. market index dating back to the late 1800s), WBA is now considered one of the select large-cap companies which (together) accurately represent the overall market.\n\nThough WBA has a small weighting in the Dow (only \\~1% when compared to 3% for Apple (AAPL), 5% for Microsoft (MSFT), and 7% for Goldman Sachs (GS), for example), it still stands to benefit greatly from being one of the most visible and widely-followed stocks as part of the Dow index. Moreover, with $Billions (or Trillions) of Dollars in passive investing, a lot of money flows to index funds. As index funds are bought, money is then invested into WBA, which pushes the price up.\n\nWBA has A LOT of room to go. Its stock price can increase and earn a higher weighting, which could then trigger a \u201cvirtuous cycle\u201d, where the stock price increases --&gt; WBA weighting increases --&gt; more passive (and active) money flows into WBA --&gt; the stock price increases --&gt; the positive cycle repeats.\n\nIn short, as a (relatively new) part of the Dow, WBA stock stands to gain. As it benefits from passive/index investing, its market cap can be $Billions larger. The honor of being one of the few companies in the Dow will keep WBA stock visible to investors and will keep the stock supported in a big way.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**2)** **Best-of-Breed in Pharmacy/Healthcare**\n\nWalgreens is clearly one o f the largest players and best-of-breed companies in the Pharmacy/Healthcare space. Not only is WBA\u2019s inclusion in the Dow a huge statement that WBA is best-of-breed, but also the lack of competition and alternative choices in pharmacy stocks is a huge advantage to WBA. With only CVS ($CVS) and Rite-aid ($RAD) as similar peers in the entire market (and with worse financials!), WBA is a clear #1 investment choice.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**3)** **4% Dividend**\n\nA 4% dividend makes WBA an income investment opportunity, in addition to the growth and stock price increases we expect to see in the near future. Not only is WBA a relatively safe stock with a low Beta (lower volatility than the broader market), but also the excellent 4% dividend payment is already half of the stock market\u2019s yearly average return (8%) going back 100+ years.\n\nIts further possible that WBA\u2019s dividend can continue to grow sustainably; in fact, WBA is a blue-chip dividend powerhouse and officially a member of the \"Dividend Aristocrats\", companies which have increased their dividend for 25+ consecutive years. Walgreens has increased its dividend for 45 years and running.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**4)** **Attractive Valuations**\n\nWBA has very attractive valuations, and the stock is selling at a major discount. Investors have a chance right now to buy the stock and a great company at a bargain, right before the stock price could rise by 50%+.\n\nWhy is the stock so cheap? The company has shown poor stock performance over the past few years mostly due to poor earnings performance, low profitability, and high debt. Fortunately, things are improving and the stock hasn\u2019t yet reflected the good news. It will soon be priced in, and the stock price will rise.\n\nHow do we know it\u2019s cheap? Why is the stock a \u201cbuy\u201d? WBA stock sells at attractive low multiples (1) on an absolute basis (10x forward P/E, 2x P/B, 9x P/FCF), (2) on an historical basis (lowest P/S and near 15-year low P/B and P/FCF), and (3) on a peer comparables basis (WBA is selling at significantly cheaper valuation multiples than Walmart (WMT), Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ), Procter &amp; Gamble (PG), Target (TGT), Dollar General (DG), United Health (UNH), Cigna (CI), etc.).\n\nIn other words, the stock is cheap on nearly all fronts, and potentially offering a major value investment. If WBA had multiples more comparable to its peer group, the stock would be trading at a significantly higher price. As market participants come to realize this market mispricing/inefficiency, the stock price is likely to adjust higher.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**5)** **Improving Business**\n\nWalgreens\u2019 business and future prospects seem to be improving. With a new CEO at the helm (the first African American female CEO of a Fortune 500 company), along with critical strategic decisions/initiatives likely upcoming, WBA is very well-positioned to grow and gain market share.\n\nWith most locations (physical stores) in very good condition still looking new, located on prime real estate, and acting as top places to get vaccinated against Covid-19, there is plenty more time in WBA\u2019s bullish cycle. (see: [https://www.netleaseadvisor.com/tenant/walgreens/](https://www.netleaseadvisor.com/tenant/walgreens/) )\n\nWe will look at the upcoming year\u2019s revenue, income, and cash flows to judge WBA\u2019s progress and performance.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**6)** **Takeover Target / Buyout**\n\nThe cherry on top for Walgreens ($WBA) stock is a takeover.\n\nWalgreens is an attractive takeover target. Especially in the retail/pharmaceutical/healthcare space, Walgreens presents a market-moving opportunity for a large public company or private equity group. In fact, this was attempted not too long ago when in late-2019 KKR ($KKR) showed interest in taking WBA private in the largest private-equity buyout of all-time (see: [https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/nov/11/walgreens-boots-alliance-kkr-buyout-offer](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/nov/11/walgreens-boots-alliance-kkr-buyout-offer) ). The takeover offer at the time was $70-80/share, 40-60% higher than current prices.\n\nThere is clearly significant interest in WBA, and it\u2019s been quiet for a little while. The sleeping lion (or bull?) could wake up at any moment.\n\nA takeover has been attempted at much higher prices by private equity buyers. The existence of such investor interest and possible takeover offers provides (1) a strong catalyst for a soaring stock price, and (2) a floor to the stock, which will support the stock at or above current prices. If the stock price drops too far, buyers are highly likely to step in.\n\nAdditionally, though maybe unlikely, both Amazon ($AMZN) and Warren Buffett / Berkshire Hathaway ($BRK/A)($BRK/B) could be potential buyers. Amazon has shown much interest in expanding into Pharma/Drugs/Prescriptions as well as expanding its retail operation. WBA seems to be a great potential fit; and at only $50-100B, WBA is not such a big purchase for the $2 Trillion market cap Amazon.\n\nWarren Buffett and/or Berkshire Hathaway could also be a potential investor. WBA fits many of the criteria which Buffett and other value investors look for. Additionally, Buffett and a joint venture between Amazon, Berkshire, and JP Morgan (called \u201cHaven\u201d) showed strong interest in disrupting the healthcare sector until recently disbanding (see: [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/04/haven-the-amazon-berkshire-jpmorgan-venture-to-disrupt-healthcare-is-disbanding-after-3-years.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/04/haven-the-amazon-berkshire-jpmorgan-venture-to-disrupt-healthcare-is-disbanding-after-3-years.html) ).\n\nIt seems painfully clear that Amazon ($AMZN), Berkshire ($BRK/A)($BRK/B), and other major players are highly-interested in gaining a foothold in the space which Walgreens ($WBA) already dominates. If takeover interest materializes, or if Buffett decides to invest more heavily in WBA, you can bet there will be a lot of attention on the stock, and the stock price is likely to be much higher.",

        "selftext": " \\*\\*\\*Disclaimers &amp; Disclosures: This article is meant for discussion and entertainment purposes only. The following is not investment advice, nor a recommendation to buy or sell any security/investment. Investments always carry risk, so DYOR.\n\nWe are traders &amp; private investors who see the value of Reddit in creating and growing an investing community.\n\nStocks included in this article: WBA, AAPL, MSFT, GS, CVS, RAD, WMT, TGT, UNH, CI, DG, JNJ, PG, AMZN, BRK/A, BRK/B.\n\nWe are long WBA.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWalgreens ($WBA) is a safe and cheap stock, selling at a discount, with an improving underlying business, and ripe for a buyout. In addition to a healthy 4% dividend, Walgreens is also a major potential takeover target in the healthcare/pharmaceutical space. Selling at attractive valuations, and as both a Dow component and a best-of-breed player in the pharmacy business, we think Walgreens represents a huge investment opportunity. Furthermore, with cheap valuations, a low Beta, and lower correlation to the broader market, we believe WBA is a top defensive play &amp; income producer, and could be added as a core position to anyone\u2019s portfolio. Including WBA in your portfolio is highly likely to reduce overall portfolio volatility and risk, and improve your performance.\n\n**Our price target for $WBA is $74, an upside of approximately 50%.**\n\nBelow are the 6 main reasons we\u2019re bullish on WBA.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**1)** **WBA is a Dow component.**\n\nWalgreens stock ($WBA) is a Dow component. As one of only 30 stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (the oldest and most historically-followed U.S. market index dating back to the late 1800s), WBA is now considered one of the select large-cap companies which (together) accurately represent the overall market.\n\nThough WBA has a small weighting in the Dow (only \\~1% when compared to 3% for Apple (AAPL), 5% for Microsoft (MSFT), and 7% for Goldman Sachs (GS), for example), it still stands to benefit greatly from being one of the most visible and widely-followed stocks as part of the Dow index. Moreover, with $Billions (or Trillions) of Dollars in passive investing, a lot of money flows to index funds. As index funds are bought, money is then invested into WBA, which pushes the price up.\n\nWBA has A LOT of room to go. Its stock price can increase and earn a higher weighting, which could then trigger a \u201cvirtuous cycle\u201d, where the stock price increases --&gt; WBA weighting increases --&gt; more passive (and active) money flows into WBA --&gt; the stock price increases --&gt; the positive cycle repeats.\n\nIn short, as a (relatively new) part of the Dow, WBA stock stands to gain. As it benefits from passive/index investing, its market cap can be $Billions larger. The honor of being one of the few companies in the Dow will keep WBA stock visible to investors and will keep the stock supported in a big way.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**2)** **Best-of-Breed in Pharmacy/Healthcare**\n\nWalgreens is clearly one o f the largest players and best-of-breed companies in the Pharmacy/Healthcare space. Not only is WBA\u2019s inclusion in the Dow a huge statement that WBA is best-of-breed, but also the lack of competition and alternative choices in pharmacy stocks is a huge advantage to WBA. With only CVS ($CVS) and Rite-aid ($RAD) as similar peers in the entire market (and with worse financials!), WBA is a clear #1 investment choice.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**3)** **4% Dividend**\n\nA 4% dividend makes WBA an income investment opportunity, in addition to the growth and stock price increases we expect to see in the near future. Not only is WBA a relatively safe stock with a low Beta (lower volatility than the broader market), but also the excellent 4% dividend payment is already half of the stock market\u2019s yearly average return (8%) going back 100+ years.\n\nIts further possible that WBA\u2019s dividend can continue to grow sustainably; in fact, WBA is a blue-chip dividend powerhouse and officially a member of the \"Dividend Aristocrats\", companies which have increased their dividend for 25+ consecutive years. Walgreens has increased its dividend for 45 years and running.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**4)** **Attractive Valuations**\n\nWBA has very attractive valuations, and the stock is selling at a major discount. Investors have a chance right now to buy the stock and a great company at a bargain, right before the stock price could rise by 50%+.\n\nWhy is the stock so cheap? The company has shown poor stock performance over the past few years mostly due to poor earnings performance, low profitability, and high debt. Fortunately, things are improving and the stock hasn\u2019t yet reflected the good news. It will soon be priced in, and the stock price will rise.\n\nHow do we know it\u2019s cheap? Why is the stock a \u201cbuy\u201d? WBA stock sells at attractive low multiples (1) on an absolute basis (10x forward P/E, 2x P/B, 9x P/FCF), (2) on an historical basis (lowest P/S and near 15-year low P/B and P/FCF), and (3) on a peer comparables basis (WBA is selling at significantly cheaper valuation multiples than Walmart (WMT), Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ), Procter &amp; Gamble (PG), Target (TGT), Dollar General (DG), United Health (UNH), Cigna (CI), etc.).\n\nIn other words, the stock is cheap on nearly all fronts, and potentially offering a major value investment. If WBA had multiples more comparable to its peer group, the stock would be trading at a significantly higher price. As market participants come to realize this market mispricing/inefficiency, the stock price is likely to adjust higher.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**5)** **Improving Business**\n\nWalgreens\u2019 business and future prospects seem to be improving. With a new CEO at the helm (the first African American female CEO of a Fortune 500 company), along with critical strategic decisions/initiatives likely upcoming, WBA is very well-positioned to grow and gain market share.\n\nWith most locations (physical stores) in very good condition still looking new, located on prime real estate, and acting as top places to get vaccinated against Covid-19, there is plenty more time in WBA\u2019s bullish cycle. \n\nWe will look at the upcoming year\u2019s revenue, income, and cash flows to judge WBA\u2019s progress and performance.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**6)** **Takeover Target / Buyout**\n\nThe cherry on top for Walgreens ($WBA) stock is a takeover.\n\nWalgreens is an attractive takeover target.

I will say though, Microvision has had POOR revenues for essentially forever, they're just now getting royalties from their work with Hololens and IVAS finally, they're turning over a new leaf and that is what makes this a good opportunity and BET, the market believes they're overvalued right now, once they sign one partnership for lidar the market will correct.\n\nWhich brings us to today, the IAA Mobility show in Germany is currently taking place and for the first time Microvision is publicly showing their family of lidar units and specs. The cat is getting out of the bag and coincidentally the whole general market AND lidar sector has taken a big shit, so right now is a great entry point. For those that bought weeklies, we're probably toast.\n\nHere's video of live footages taken from various lidar booths during IAA: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bsrp3QQ-Abg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bsrp3QQ-Abg) (notice the difference in resolution between people standing / walking)\n\nUnless there's a big upswing in volume for the entire lidar sector very soon I would not buy weeklies but either get shares or buy cheaper OTM LEAPs.\n\nAnother thing to note, the company doesn't talk about it's augmented reality (AR) / near eye display (NED) vertical anymore, despite Microsoft just getting awarded a $20bn contract for IVAS and MVIS receiving royalties, the CEO on the last few ECs has mentioned automotive lidar as their primary focus. Interestingly Drew Markham was added on as general counsel several months ago and her experience is in M&amp;A and transferring of IP. I'm speculating that the AR vertical is currently in the works of being sold off to Microsoft.\n\nI'll add comments later for other tidbits of DD, I should get back to work right now.\n\nPositions:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f6jpncvw6dm71.png?width=1069&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2a7eca7bafa3737ba33fe74f0f222748a3175370",

        "selftext": "Hi Everyone,\n\nMy main investing account is with another brokerage but I decided to set up a mini side portfolio with Robinhood (I know there are issues with Robinhood but it will work fine for what I'm doing). Since I want the majority of my money going towards my main account, I came up with a budget for my situation that will pretty much be unnoticeable in terms of DCA.\n\nI am starting with $100 and splitting it evenly between AAPL, AMZN, GOOGL, MSFT, and TSLA so $20 on each of them. Then I'm setting a recurring investment of $1 for each of them weekly so $5/week or around $22/month. So it's pretty much the cost of a streaming service monthly. \n\nI back tested this scenario and was surprised to see how much it actually grew - from the initial $100 to $43.5k over the last 10yrs with just adding $22/month! I'm not expecting these companies to continue at the same growth rate moving forward but I am happy with my picks and obviously it can be adjusted based on preferences but I thought you all might like to see this scenario especially if you're young and don't have a lot of capital to put in.\n\n[Back Testing Here](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&amp;timePeriod=4&amp;startYear=1985&amp;firstMonth=1&amp;endYear=2021&amp;lastMonth=12&amp;calendarAligned=true&amp;includeYTD=false&amp;initialAmount=100&amp;annualOperation=1&amp;annualAdjustment=22&amp;inflationAdjusted=true&amp;annualPercentage=0.0&amp;frequency=2&amp;rebalanceType=1&amp;absoluteDeviation=5.0&amp;relativeDeviation=25.0&amp;reinvestDividends=true&amp;showYield=false&amp;showFactors=false&amp;factorModel=3&amp;portfolioNames=false&amp;portfolioName1=Portfolio+1&amp;portfolioName2=Portfolio+2&amp;portfolioName3=Portfolio+3&amp;symbol1=AAPL&amp;allocation1_1=20&amp;symbol2=AMZN&amp;allocation2_1=20&amp;symbol3=GOOGL&amp;allocation3_1=20&amp;symbol4=MSFT&amp;allocation4_1=20&amp;symbol5=TSLA&amp;allocation5_1=20)",

        "selftext": "Good morning everyone. Happy Saturday and thank you so much for taking a time out to read my post. I figured a topic like this can help others, or comfort others as well as share strategies so we can all do better, or make changes to be positive.\n\nWe are on an epic run of amazing proportions.

        "selftext": "When I started trading I was trying to follow the mantra of \"don't invest more than you're willing to lose.\" This resulted in sort of a max of $400-500 that I would put in per individual stock and I definitely had too many going at once to see any legit profit. \n\nI have also read that I should have specific rules set and follow them, setting emotions aside. With this, I have set my initial investment around $1-2K as well as buying puts to hedge potential drops and/or setting Stop Limits for a % I would be willing to lose. My goal is to hit around a 20-30% ROI before selling. There are a few I plan to just buy and Hold, but others I would like to swing trade over the span of a few months. \n\nThe more I think about it, wouldn't it be better to put far more (10-20K) into a stock that is very likely to increase in value over time, like blue chip stocks - wait for it to drop to a 20-50 day MA, invest and look to get out when that 20% is hit. \n\nBut you can't time the market! I know, I know but stocks like MSFT, AAPL, JNJ, PG and many others aren't likely to just drop to 0 even if they do have a pullback (which is when I would buy). Plus, I would have purchased a Put and/or set a stop loss with what I'm comfortable losing. \n\nHow hard do you all go in on your initial investment and do you really need to up the ante to see consistently high returns? What are your thoughts on going in heavy on a strong stock and swing trading it?",

I will say though, Microvision has had POOR revenues for essentially forever, they're just now getting royalties from their work with Hololens and IVAS finally, they're turning over a new leaf and that is what makes this a good opportunity and BET, the market believes they're overvalued right now, once they sign one partnership for lidar the market will correct.\n\nWhich brings us to today, the IAA Mobility show in Germany is currently taking place and for the first time Microvision is publicly showing their family of lidar units and specs. The cat is getting out of the bag and coincidentally the whole general market AND lidar sector has taken a big shit, so right now is a great entry point. For those that bought weeklies, we're probably toast.\n\nHere's video of live footages taken from various lidar booths during IAA: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bsrp3QQ-Abg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bsrp3QQ-Abg) (notice the difference in resolution between people standing / walking)\n\nHere are my positions: [https://i.imgur.com/5s6tFfe.png](https://i.imgur.com/5s6tFfe.png)\n\nUnless there's a big upswing in volume for the entire lidar sector very soon I would not buy weeklies but either get shares or buy cheaper OTM LEAPs.\n\nAnother thing to note, the company doesn't talk about it's augmented reality (AR) / near eye display (NED) vertical anymore, despite Microsoft just getting awarded a $20bn contract for IVAS and MVIS receiving royalties, the CEO on the last few ECs has mentioned automotive lidar as their primary focus. Interestingly Drew Markham was added on as general counsel several months ago and her experience is in M&amp;A and transferring of IP. I'm speculating that the AR vertical is currently in the works of being sold off to Microsoft.\n\nI'll add comments later for other tidbits of DD, I should get back to work right now.",

        "selftext": "Hi Everyone,\n\nMy main investing account is with another brokerage but I decided to set up a mini side portfolio with Robinhood (I know there are issues with Robinhood but it will work fine for what I'm doing). Since I want the majority of my money going towards my main account, I came up with a budget for my situation that will pretty much be unnoticeable in terms of DCA.\n\nI am starting with $100 and splitting it evenly between AAPL, AMZN, GOOGL, MSFT, and TSLA so $20 on each of them. Then I'm setting a recurring investment of $1 for each of them weekly so $5/week or around $22/month. So it's pretty much the cost of a streaming service monthly. \n\nI back tested this scenario and was surprised to see how much it actually grew - from the initial $100 to $43.5k over the last 10yrs with just adding $22/month! I'm not expecting these companies to continue at the same growth rate moving forward but I am happy with my picks and obviously it can be adjusted based on preferences but I thought you all might like to see this scenario especially if you're young and don't have a lot of capital to put in.\n\n[Back Testing Here](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&amp;timePeriod=4&amp;startYear=1985&amp;firstMonth=1&amp;endYear=2021&amp;lastMonth=12&amp;calendarAligned=true&amp;includeYTD=false&amp;initialAmount=100&amp;annualOperation=1&amp;annualAdjustment=22&amp;inflationAdjusted=true&amp;annualPercentage=0.0&amp;frequency=2&amp;rebalanceType=1&amp;absoluteDeviation=5.0&amp;relativeDeviation=25.0&amp;reinvestDividends=true&amp;showYield=false&amp;showFactors=false&amp;factorModel=3&amp;portfolioNames=false&amp;portfolioName1=Portfolio+1&amp;portfolioName2=Portfolio+2&amp;portfolioName3=Portfolio+3&amp;symbol1=AAPL&amp;allocation1_1=20&amp;symbol2=AMZN&amp;allocation2_1=20&amp;symbol3=GOOGL&amp;allocation3_1=20&amp;symbol4=MSFT&amp;allocation4_1=20&amp;symbol5=TSLA&amp;allocation5_1=20)",

Here are the numbers.\n\n* **Change in non-farm payrolls:** \\+235,000 vs. +733,000 expected and a revised +1.053 million in July\n* **Unemployment rate, August:** 5.2% vs. 5.2% expected and 5.4% in July\n* **Average hourly earnings, month-over-month:** 0.6% vs. 0.3% expected and 0.4% in July \n* **Average hourly earnings, year-over-year:** 4.3% vs. 3.9% expected and 4.0% in July\n\nPresident Biden said of the report, \u201cWhile I know some wanted to see a larger number today and so did I, what we\u2019ve seen this year is continued growth, month after month, in job creation. This is the kind of growth that makes our economy stronger.\u201d\n\nMembers of the Fed have consistently signaled they will be looking especially closely at labor market data to determine when to start tapering the pandemic-era quantitative easing program. Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said the August Jobs Report could be his signal to hit the \u201csubstantial further progress mark\u201d the Fed stipulated in December and begin tapering. He said, \u201cI think that one more good job report if it\u2019s in the 850,000 to 1 million range will be sufficient to claim substantial further progress in employment for tapering.\u201d August was not the report they were looking for. \n\nIn its latest Beige Book, which is basically a report by the Federal Reserve on current economic conditions, members said the economy downshifted slightly due to Delta variant concerns. The report stated, \u201cThe deceleration in economic activity was largely attributable to a pullback in dining out, travel, and tourism in most Districts, reflecting safety concerns due to the rise of the Delta variant, and, in many cases, international travel restrictions.\u201d \n\nIn the US, the surge in infections in certain parts of the nation continues unabated, with hospitalizations this weekend roughly 300% higher than Labor Day weekend in 2020, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. The surge in patients comes as the highly contagious Delta variant continues to spread across the US, and coincided with a weekend that saw a spike in travel. According to the Transportation Security Administration, more than 3.5 million people travelled across the country on Friday and Saturday for the Labor Day holiday, despite the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s recommendation for unvaccinated people to refrain from traveling. \n\n[https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/sep/07/us-covid-patients-hospitals-surge](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/sep/07/us-covid-patients-hospitals-surge)\n\n[https://www.kq2.com/content/news/Health-officials-urge-caution-as-students-return-to-class-after-long-holiday-weekend--575252751.html](https://www.kq2.com/content/news/Health-officials-urge-caution-as-students-return-to-class-after-long-holiday-weekend--575252751.html)\n\nIn other news, the battle between Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos is heating up! Last week, SpaceX sent a filing to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) accusing Amazon of using regulatory and legal means to stifle and slowdown competition. SpaceX said, \u201cWhile SpaceX has proceeded to deploy more than 1,700 satellites, Amazon has yet to even attempt to address the radiofrequency interference and orbital debris issues that must be resolved before Amazon can deploy its constellation\u201d and suggested \u201cas it falls behind competitors \\[Amazon\\] is more than willing to use regulatory and legal processes to create obstacles designed to delay those competitors from leaving Amazon even further behind\u201d (ouch).\n\nIn response, Amazon said, Whether it is launching satellites with unlicensed antennas, launching rockets without approval, building an unapproved launch tower, or re-opening a factory in violation of a shelter-in-place order, the conduct of SpaceX and other Musk-led companies makes their view plain: rules are for other people, and those who insist upon or even simply request compliance are deserving of derision and ad hominem attacks. If the FCC regulated hypocrisy, SpaceX would keep the commission very busy.\u201d SpaceX won this one IMO, that was a nasty burn. \n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Job openings in July as measured by JOLTS soared by a staggering 749,000 \u2014 hitting yet another all-time high just shy of 11 million open jobs, enough to eliminate most of the current slack in the labor market.\n* El Salvador became the first country in the world to roll out a digital currency as a form of legal tender, allowing businesses and customers to transact using blockchain. There are some initial teething problems with the launch of the Chivo, the country\u2019s wallet app and locals being unfamiliar with the technology. Digital currencies also fell, though I don\u2019t know unknown if the drop is correlated to the launch in El Salvador\n* Damn, the buy-now-pay-later (BNPL) market is red-hot right now. Following Sqaure\u2019s (SQ) acquisition of Afterpay for $29 billion and Amazon (AMZN) partnering up with Affirm (AFRM) to offer BNPL on Amazon, PayPal (PYPL) is now stepping into the arena by acquiring Japanese BNPL firm Paidy for $2.7 billion\n* Twitter (TWTR) launched a global test of a tool it calls Communities, a feature similar to Facebook Groups that gives users a way to tweet to people with similar interests. This follows the recent launch of Super Follows, where content creators can charge their followers for their content. \n* Applied Materials (AMAT) announced it was releasing two new tools aimed at improving efficiency of making a new class of chips for electric vehicles. The machines announced on Wednesday are designed for chips made from a material called silicon carbide. Such chips are gaining traction in electric vehicles like those made by Tesla Inc because they are more efficient and lighter in weight than standard silicon chips for transmitting power from a car's battery to its motors, helping improve range. Silicon carbide chips are difficult to manufacture because the material is very hard\n* **\\*\\*Please note that current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect closing prices\\*\\***\n* ASML target raised by Wells Fargo (WFC) from $800 to$975 at Overweight.

        "selftext": "Dial Into The Return To the Office With Poly -- Barron's\nMentioned:\tLOGI MSFT POLY RNG ZM\nThe producer of conference-room products and office headsets is recovering after a merger. And its stock is inexpensive. \nBy Eric J. Savitz \n\nThis should be a magical moment for Plantronics, the producer of conference-room products and office headsets, better known as Poly. \n\nWith a gradual return to the office, there is expected to be a surge in \"hybrid meetings\" -- mixing in-person and virtual participants. Poly CEO Dave Shull estimates that there are about 50 million conference rooms globally, and that 10% or less are equipped for videoconferencing. That is a huge potential opportunity for Poly (ticker: POLY) and its competitors. \n\nShares of Poly, meanwhile, have been driven down to bargain-basement levels by the fallout from an ill-fated merger three years ago. At a recent $32, the stock now trades for about 0.7 times anticipated revenue for the March 2023 fiscal year, and just under eight times projected profits for the same period. \n\nIn comparison, Logitech International (LOGI), which has an overlapping set of products, trades for about 3.2 times revenue and 22 times projected profits for the same period. \n\nAt such deeply discounted levels, investors willing to be patient could reap rich rewards as a turnaround gets underway at Poly.",

        "selftext": "TOM SIEBEL: Well I think we're right on track with what we communicated when we took the company public. So far, we've exceeded expectations every quarter. We're on the growth trajectory that we projected. We have become the world's leading provider of enterprise AI applications.\n\nWe just formed a very, very strategic relationship with Google Cloud where the almost 4,000-strong sales person organization at Google Cloud will be selling all of our applications globally, so that dramatically increases our sales capacity, say, by a couple of orders of magnitude.\n\nAnd I think the company's right on track, and you know, I don't really watch the stock price day to day. That's not my job. I think, as far as I'm concerned, we have $1 billion cash in the bank. We have enough money to do what we need to do. The market can just close for five years, and I think if it opens, then all the shareholders will be happy.\n\n- Some strong words. I was going to ask you about the stock move. I know you don't like to comment on it, but we are seeing it under some pressure today, so I just wonder what you think investors are missing in terms of the growth story that C3 AI is on right now.\n\nTOM SIEBEL: Well, let's think about this. We deliver 40 turnkey enterprise AI applications a day, for banking, for manufacturing, for oil and gas, financial services, telecommunications, and manufacturing. Google Cloud decided they wanted-- these are very, very high value applications, where these companies are realizing billions of dollars a year annual economic benefit from these apps.\n\nNow, the Google Cloud decided that they wanted to change the competitive dynamics of the hyperscaler market, and lead with turnkey enterprise applications rather than CPU seconds and storage as they compete against the other hyperscalers.\n\nIt's a new think about this in terms of, maybe they needed to approach a partner who had a portfolio of applications like that. How many doors are there to knock on in the world? There's virtually only one. We're the only company in this business. We're the only pure play in enterprise application software in the world, in applications, other than, say, toys. Like, toys would be storage, or toys would be virtualization, or toys would be a machine learning library. We don't deliver toys, we deliver applications.\n\nSo we're the only company in this game. This is a-- probably a $300 to $400 billion addressable market, and I think we're going about establishing a market leadership position in that space, and that's the big picture. And I think we have three, four, five, ten years to execute that strategy. If we execute it, this will be one of the great technology companies in the world.\n\n- Yeah, let's use that five year frame here, then. Because you know, I felt like when we were at the IPO stage, right? When was that? A year ago, more than a year ago, right? When we're looking at the growth rate, right? And you came on, and you were kind of honest about, we're not going to run 75% growth all the time. It's going to moderate a little bit, and we've seen that now in terms of, kind of, subscription revenue here up 29%, total revenue up 29% year over year.\n\nI mean, when you look at that five year time frame, and position it where the stock's trading now, I mean, what is it that you would tell investors about where you'll be in five years if all the things pan out? The Google Cloud partnership, and also the government contracts that it sounded like analysts might not have been projecting quite correctly.\n\nTOM SIEBEL: Well, I think, you know, again, whatever the stock did this morning is, you know, it'll do what it does. And the 29% growth rate will put us in the top decile, certainly, of high growth companies in enterprise application software. The analysts' predictions are that our growth rate will accelerate in the coming years.\n\nAnd I think the company is right on track. It's all good. I think we're very pleased. We're pleased with our Microsoft partnership, our Google partnership, our Baker Hughes partnership, FIS partnership. This company is right on track, and I'm quite pleased with the results.\n\n- You've got a pretty broad footprint right now across sectors, whether that's in manufacturing or financials. A long list here in terms of your research on enterprise AI. Where are you seeing the biggest growth right now? What are you most excited about?\n\nTOM SIEBEL: I think in the long run-- so today, we're huge in energy, oil and gas-- excuse me, energy efficiency, telecommunications, manufacturing, aerospace, defense, intelligence. In the long run, I'm personally most excited about precision health. Precision health will be the largest commercial application of AI, where we will be able to do very precise disease prediction, and therefore be able to intervene clinically and avoid the diagnosis.\n\nWe'll have AI-assisted medicine, genome specific medical protocols. I think the economic and social benefits that will accrue from applying AI to precision health are going to be really staggering. This will-- people will live longer, they will be healthier, we will deliver health care at lower cost, and we will do it-- we'll deliver-- using devices like this, we will be delivering health care to a massively large, previously underserved communities.\n\nSQUEEEEZE!

In 8 short weeks, US ecommerce spending as a % of total retail sales grew from 16% to 27%. $SHOP and $AMZN have seen their TAM grow massively and their valuations have grown to reflect this.\n\nWhat if I told you something very similar is happening right now in enterprise SaaS?\n\nAmazingly, in 2020, cloud/SaaS spending is still only 9.1% of total global IT spend. But this in changing.

        "selftext": "TLDR\n\nThis article was written by Dogefather's prot\u00e9g\u00e9 \u203a who ascertains as a result of research \u203a to provide thorough \u203a readable \u203a analysis. His trading strategy is Long only \u203a Value \u203a Growth \u203a with a medium to long-term horizon. Dogeboy is generally wary of tech stocks \u203a as this sector is ripe for disruption. However \u203a due to TEAM's steady predictability &amp; rapidly growing revenues \u203a he aggressively solicits a posture of Atlassian long game \u203a as one can make room in a portfolio for tech companies that are the disruptors &amp; carry a moat. \n\nConnected Enterprise\n\nAtlassian \u203a TEAM \u203a produces software that helps teams work together more efficiently &amp; effectively \u203a offering a broad set of \u203a easy to deploy &amp; use tools \u2933 Jira \u203a Confluence \u203a Bitbucket \u203a Trello.\n\n83% of Fortune 500 companies use Atlassian software products \u203a utilized by more than 212K customers at both large &amp; small organizations \u203a for open teamwork models &amp; autonomous project planning &amp; management \u203a that provides an environment for enterprises to experiment &amp; optimize employee experience \u203a for frictionless work environments \u203a business partners \u203a in a connected vendor ecosystem \u203a for easy interaction back &amp; forth &amp; quick response to market signals \u203a &amp; connect with customers \u203a to deepen relationships via those processes.\n\nAs teamwork becomes increasingly digital \u203a investing in a connected enterprise is the clear path forward for 10 million monthly active users who use Atlassian cloud collaboration management tools &amp; help desk solutions \u203a to support a variety of collaboration styles &amp; provide standardization to innovate &amp; cut costs. \n\nAtlassian operates in 4 segments \u2933 1 \u203a subscriptions \u203a term licenses &amp; cloud agreements \u2933 2 \u203a maintenance \u203a annual maintenance contracts that provide support &amp; periodic updates &amp; are generally attached to perpetual license sales \u2933 3 \u203a perpetual license \u203a upfront sale for indefinite usage of the software \u2933 4 \u203a other \u203a training \u203a strategic consulting &amp; revenue from the Atlassian Marketplace app store.\n\nFirst Mover Advantage\n\nWhat sets Atlassian apart is its first mover advantage in its core market. Given the time sensitive nature &amp; delivery windows of most software projects \u203a most of Atlassian's customers simply don\u2019t have the appetite for risking project execution nor the time to adopt a new platform. This has resulted in creating a moat \u203a  as there are indirect costs associated with the learning curve &amp; switching altogether to another platform. \n\nAtlassian delivers the tools &amp; platforms that developers need to build applications \u203a with every company in every sector becoming a software-driven company \u203a there will be almost infinite demand for new applications. As developers raced to build new applications to help their companies cope with the pandemic \u203a they gravitated toward the tools that enabled them to work the fastest &amp; most efficiently. Every company from the smallest mom &amp; pop shop to the largest multinational realized with utmost clarity that they would live or die by software.\n\n\u201cWe are a multi-product company. We differ from many companies that get product/market fit &amp; grow to $500 million in revenue before their second product. We introduced a second product \u203a Confluence \u203a before we reached that scale. We found that customers perceived that software documentation is poor \u2014 we developed a product for document collaboration that\u2019s like a Google Doc on steroids. We have multi-product in our DNA. We now have 14 different products.\u201d \u2933 Cameron Deatsch - Chief Revenue Officer.\n\nAtlassian applies the now-popular agile systems development mindset to all its operations. \n\n\u201cAs far as process \u203a we use an agile approach. This differs \u203a from the traditional waterfall approach \u203a in which system requirements are developed over two years &amp; handed off to the systems development people to build. With agile \u203a we start with customer goals &amp; iteratively build versus the goals. Every two weeks we ship something &amp; learn from it. We can apply this approach to marketing \u203a closing the books \u203a &amp; so on. We have daily stand-ups &amp; two week sprints.\"\n\nCustomer Growth\n\nAtlassian products meet a unique market need for business customers \u203a modernizing collaboration through human-centered technology \u2933 including office productivity tools \u203a video conferencing platforms \u203a file synchronization \u203a sharing solutions \u203a content management apps &amp; more \u2933 empowering companies to design experiences that unlock less fragmented workflows &amp; bring people together in seamless \u203a interconnected &amp; digital experiences.\n\nThey are able to land customers at a low cost with little human intervention. In the latest quarter \u203a Atlassian brought in 17k new customers who never talked to people at Atlassian or its partners \u203a equating to a robust 9.5% sequential QoQ growth \u203a driven by 5.7k  Trello accounts \u203a as a result of new product features &amp; TEAM\u2019s recent sales funnel optimization initiatives.\n\nThe addressable market size in total is an estimated $125 billion \u203a in terms of potential users \u203a including 800 million knowledge workers at the highest level \u203a drilling down to 100 million technical team members &amp; 23 million software developers. Atlassian noted\u00a0during the recent industry conference \u203a the company continues to out its online ecosystem \u203a with a marketplace for over 4k apps that utilize its product technology \u2933 recently launched Forge \u203a which provides runtime for these apps.\n\nAtlassian invents new products through processes propelled by its employees. \u203a it builds on its strengths \u2933 a focus on teams\u203a of which there are many different kinds in different industries \u203a come up with new products by looking at customer use cases &amp; trends outside the norm. Service management is the fastest growing product.\n\nRevenue Growth\n\nAtlassian continues its strong track record of growth \u203a Q3\u201921 revenue growing 38% YoY \u203a driven by subscription revenue growth of 43% YoY. Subscription now comprises 62% of TEAM\u2019s total revenue &amp; its recurring nature helps to smooth out the revenue stream \u203a resulting in higher predictability.\n\nAtlassian has grown impressively over the past few years because it adopts a low-cost web-based marketing &amp; lean transactional operating model \u203a going without a traditional enterprise salesforce &amp; marketing team. Atlassian has a large opportunity ahead \u203a demonstrating strong profitability relative to peers \u203a with a gross profit margin of 84% \u203a far higher than the 49% sector average \u203a a strong balance sheet &amp; plenty of cash to fund future growth initiatives \u203a its FCF margin is 43% \u203a comparing favorably to 12.6% sector median. \n\nGiven the subscription-heavy nature of the business \u203a Atlassian's revenue stream has resulted in sequential quarterly revenue growth over at least the past 3 years &amp; this includes pandemic quarters. Atlassian stopped new sales of server license \u203a increased pricing &amp; created pull-forward effects that incentivize users to renew early \u203a leading to strong revenue &amp; billings growth. Atlassian has demonstrated impressive revenue growth since its IPO in 2015 \u203a growing by 513% over this timeframe to $1.96 billion for the trailing 12 months. Atlassian maintains a fortress balance sheet to fund growth initiatives, with $1.56 billion in cash &amp; short-term investments \u203a no long-term debt, and just $206M in capital leases.\n\nTEAM has outperformed the market in the last year with a price return of \u2191 91.4% while the SPY ETF gained \u2191 30.1%. TEAM has also outperformed the stock market ETF in the last 3 month &amp; 2 week periods returning \u2191 62.1% &amp; \u2191 11.3% \u203a respectively \u203a SPY returned \u2191 8.3% &amp; \u2191 3.2%. Last quarter \u203a Atlassian reported $560 million in Revenue &amp; $.24 earnings per share \u203a this beat revenue expectation by $35 million &amp; exceeded earnings estimates by $.06.\n\nValuation\n\nPotential for competition from legacy software provider Microsoft \u203a MSFT \u203a in the space in which TEAM operates. Atlassian will directly compete against ServiceNow \u203a NOW \u203a as it encroaches on the service desk space. Atlassian\u2019s formal planning processes are adjusted so it can adapt to new threats or opportunities. That\u2019s what happened last year when a competitor\u2019s IPO gave it extra capital to spend on marketing to Atlassian\u2019s customers. Atlassian reprioritized go-to-market resources to keep customer acquisition up in light of that competitor\u2019s spending. One product leader got less. They have OKRs &amp; they adjust.\n\nDisclosure\n\nWithout data \u203a you're just another \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f with an opinion \u2933 Dogeboy\u2019s 17 Sep 21 calls are \u2191 770%",

Clover is continuing to develop highly intuitive integrations within each EHR and cloud service.

        "selftext": " \\*\\*\\*Disclaimers &amp; Disclosures: This article is meant for discussion and entertainment purposes only. The following is not investment advice, nor a recommendation to buy or sell any security/investment. Investments always carry risk, so DYOR.\n\nWe are traders &amp; private investors who see the value of Reddit in creating and growing an investing community.\n\nStocks included in this article: WBA, AAPL, MSFT, GS, CVS, RAD, WMT, TGT, UNH, CI, DG, JNJ, PG, AMZN, BRK/A, BRK/B.\n\nWe are long WBA.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWalgreens ($WBA) is a safe and cheap stock, selling at a discount, with an improving underlying business, and ripe for a buyout. In addition to a healthy 4% dividend, Walgreens is also a major potential takeover target in the healthcare/pharmaceutical space. Selling at attractive valuations, and as both a Dow component and a best-of-breed player in the pharmacy business, we think Walgreens represents a huge investment opportunity. Furthermore, with cheap valuations, a low Beta, and lower correlation to the broader market, we believe WBA is a top defensive play &amp; income producer, and could be added as a core position to anyone\u2019s portfolio. Including WBA in your portfolio is highly likely to reduce overall portfolio volatility and risk, and improve your performance.\n\n**Our price target for $WBA is $74, an upside of approximately 50%.**\n\nBelow are the 6 main reasons we\u2019re bullish on WBA.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**1)** **WBA is a Dow component.**\n\nWalgreens stock ($WBA) is a Dow component. As one of only 30 stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (the oldest and most historically-followed U.S. market index dating back to the late 1800s), WBA is now considered one of the select large-cap companies which (together) accurately represent the overall market.\n\nThough WBA has a small weighting in the Dow (only \\~1% when compared to 3% for Apple (AAPL), 5% for Microsoft (MSFT), and 7% for Goldman Sachs (GS), for example), it still stands to benefit greatly from being one of the most visible and widely-followed stocks as part of the Dow index. Moreover, with $Billions (or Trillions) of Dollars in passive investing, a lot of money flows to index funds. As index funds are bought, money is then invested into WBA, which pushes the price up.\n\nWBA has A LOT of room to go. Its stock price can increase and earn a higher weighting, which could then trigger a \u201cvirtuous cycle\u201d, where the stock price increases --&gt; WBA weighting increases --&gt; more passive (and active) money flows into WBA --&gt; the stock price increases --&gt; the positive cycle repeats.\n\nIn short, as a (relatively new) part of the Dow, WBA stock stands to gain. As it benefits from passive/index investing, its market cap can be $Billions larger. The honor of being one of the few companies in the Dow will keep WBA stock visible to investors and will keep the stock supported in a big way.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**2)** **Best-of-Breed in Pharmacy/Healthcare**\n\nWalgreens is clearly one o f the largest players and best-of-breed companies in the Pharmacy/Healthcare space. Not only is WBA\u2019s inclusion in the Dow a huge statement that WBA is best-of-breed, but also the lack of competition and alternative choices in pharmacy stocks is a huge advantage to WBA. With only CVS ($CVS) and Rite-aid ($RAD) as similar peers in the entire market (and with worse financials!), WBA is a clear #1 investment choice.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**3)** **4% Dividend**\n\nA 4% dividend makes WBA an income investment opportunity, in addition to the growth and stock price increases we expect to see in the near future. Not only is WBA a relatively safe stock with a low Beta (lower volatility than the broader market), but also the excellent 4% dividend payment is already half of the stock market\u2019s yearly average return (8%) going back 100+ years.\n\nIts further possible that WBA\u2019s dividend can continue to grow sustainably; in fact, WBA is a blue-chip dividend powerhouse and officially a member of the \"Dividend Aristocrats\", companies which have increased their dividend for 25+ consecutive years. Walgreens has increased its dividend for 45 years and running.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**4)** **Attractive Valuations**\n\nWBA has very attractive valuations, and the stock is selling at a major discount. Investors have a chance right now to buy the stock and a great company at a bargain, right before the stock price could rise by 50%+.\n\nWhy is the stock so cheap? The company has shown poor stock performance over the past few years mostly due to poor earnings performance, low profitability, and high debt. Fortunately, things are improving and the stock hasn\u2019t yet reflected the good news. It will soon be priced in, and the stock price will rise.\n\nHow do we know it\u2019s cheap? Why is the stock a \u201cbuy\u201d? WBA stock sells at attractive low multiples (1) on an absolute basis (10x forward P/E, 2x P/B, 9x P/FCF), (2) on an historical basis (lowest P/S and near 15-year low P/B and P/FCF), and (3) on a peer comparables basis (WBA is selling at significantly cheaper valuation multiples than Walmart (WMT), Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ), Procter &amp; Gamble (PG), Target (TGT), Dollar General (DG), United Health (UNH), Cigna (CI), etc.).\n\nIn other words, the stock is cheap on nearly all fronts, and potentially offering a major value investment. If WBA had multiples more comparable to its peer group, the stock would be trading at a significantly higher price. As market participants come to realize this market mispricing/inefficiency, the stock price is likely to adjust higher.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**5)** **Improving Business**\n\nWalgreens\u2019 business and future prospects seem to be improving. With a new CEO at the helm (the first African American female CEO of a Fortune 500 company), along with critical strategic decisions/initiatives likely upcoming, WBA is very well-positioned to grow and gain market share.\n\nWith most locations (physical stores) in very good condition still looking new, located on prime real estate, and acting as top places to get vaccinated against Covid-19, there is plenty more time in WBA\u2019s bullish cycle. (see: [https://www.netleaseadvisor.com/tenant/walgreens/](https://www.netleaseadvisor.com/tenant/walgreens/) )\n\nWe will look at the upcoming year\u2019s revenue, income, and cash flows to judge WBA\u2019s progress and performance.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**6)** **Takeover Target / Buyout**\n\nThe cherry on top for Walgreens ($WBA) stock is a takeover.\n\nWalgreens is an attractive takeover target. Especially in the retail/pharmaceutical/healthcare space, Walgreens presents a market-moving opportunity for a large public company or private equity group. In fact, this was attempted not too long ago when in late-2019 KKR ($KKR) showed interest in taking WBA private in the largest private-equity buyout of all-time (see: [https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/nov/11/walgreens-boots-alliance-kkr-buyout-offer](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/nov/11/walgreens-boots-alliance-kkr-buyout-offer) ). The takeover offer at the time was $70-80/share, 40-60% higher than current prices.\n\nThere is clearly significant interest in WBA, and it\u2019s been quiet for a little while. The sleeping lion (or bull?) could wake up at any moment.\n\nA takeover has been attempted at much higher prices by private equity buyers. The existence of such investor interest and possible takeover offers provides (1) a strong catalyst for a soaring stock price, and (2) a floor to the stock, which will support the stock at or above current prices. If the stock price drops too far, buyers are highly likely to step in.\n\nAdditionally, though maybe unlikely, both Amazon ($AMZN) and Warren Buffett / Berkshire Hathaway ($BRK/A)($BRK/B) could be potential buyers. Amazon has shown much interest in expanding into Pharma/Drugs/Prescriptions as well as expanding its retail operation. WBA seems to be a great potential fit; and at only $50-100B, WBA is not such a big purchase for the $2 Trillion market cap Amazon.\n\nWarren Buffett and/or Berkshire Hathaway could also be a potential investor. WBA fits many of the criteria which Buffett and other value investors look for. Additionally, Buffett and a joint venture between Amazon, Berkshire, and JP Morgan (called \u201cHaven\u201d) showed strong interest in disrupting the healthcare sector until recently disbanding (see: [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/04/haven-the-amazon-berkshire-jpmorgan-venture-to-disrupt-healthcare-is-disbanding-after-3-years.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/04/haven-the-amazon-berkshire-jpmorgan-venture-to-disrupt-healthcare-is-disbanding-after-3-years.html) ).\n\nIt seems painfully clear that Amazon ($AMZN), Berkshire ($BRK/A)($BRK/B), and other major players are highly-interested in gaining a foothold in the space which Walgreens ($WBA) already dominates. If takeover interest materializes, or if Buffett decides to invest more heavily in WBA, you can bet there will be a lot of attention on the stock, and the stock price is likely to be much higher.",

        "selftext": " ( NOTE : this stock was originally brought to my attention by RamenNoodles1776, although im adding various things on to it, the backbone of the argument is by the noodle man )\n\n**introduction**\n\nAlright you pieces of shit, it's time for post #2, and this time it's a less substantiated boy: Cyxtera ( CYXT ). They're a global leader in data center colocation and interconnection services. Now if you're brain dead like I am, I'll tell you what that means : in essence their business is based in a variety of data analyzing, managing, and protection services ( cyber shit ). Now normally this wouldn\u2019t mean much, BUT due to Biden\u2019s push for cybersecurity as of late, as well as several other factors, it's actually incredibly well poised to explode and reach andromeda.\n\n**Bullet time**\n\nNow i could post all about their earnings, volume movement, target estimation, outlook, but you\u2019re lazy ass doesn't want to look at that so I'll just be loud, quick and decisive with some handy dandy bullet points :\n\n* In the last week or so their stocks has increased 10%\n* Still merely under 10$ in price per share, their so low right now that an increase in their price would magnify gains greater than any blue-chip could reach\n* Regardless of the actual performance of the company their placement as a market leader gives them an intrinsic advantage in data service opportunities provided by the government ( oooooo big boy words )\n* Considering major companies like google, Microsoft and amazon all have extremely large portions of themselves dedicated to data, it is not unwise to assume \n\n**The Real shit**\n\n\\****Alright time for some fuckin graphs.***\n\nThis first graph provides information regarding the speculated data services over the next 6 years.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lwlp3sozc7l71.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9efc951faee4b1adab0d77263cd28468fcf14181\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g5op8tozc7l71.png?width=318&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d4c17582bc4ff91cb4afd762eda89278631e67b0\n\nNow, if you have eyes, one can see that this is clearly an exponential trend which would of course coincide with a positive change in CYXT\u2019s stock price as well. Now you may ask yourself \u201c well why hasn't it gone up yet then ya fuckin doofus\u201d. Well ya piece of shit, I'll tell you : amazon and other companies like it have been mostly monopolizing data services and Cyxtera hasn\u2019t been in a position to fight back. HOWEVER, Biden has made a strong push towards antitrust scrutiny of amazon and other such companies. Thus allowing for it to get a foothold that will allow it to hulk jump into space. \n\nAs was said before, its a major data management company but it\u2019s been faced with a variety of compounding factors that's been holding it down, with the biggest being : IT'S PRETTY NEW.\n\nIt's not just coming out dicks swinging right outta the gate it has to first develop a reputation and develop itself before people start putting money into it, and the time for that is very close at hand.\n\nIn Conclusion\n\nBuy it or don\u2019t buy it, no matter what your choice is, feel free to...\n\n# Suck my meat on soft\n\nSummary : ( courtesy of RamenNoodles1776 )\n\nCyxtera finally hit 1.5 billion market cap, this new spac venture is well positioned to take advantage of Biden's push for cyber security. They are the third largest data colocation center in the world and went public with the svac spac purchase in august, which is now CYXT. They essentially have a secure path to hold all of business data acting as a giant server that has locations all over the world.\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\n*Noodle man Disclaimer, I do have a small amount of call options out through November on CYXT (after their quarterly report) and am in no way a financial advisor. This is an opportunity my amatuer self has noticed, let me know what you all think.*",

        "selftext": "What\u2019s up my stoner friends. I re-rolled all the highlights from last week to this Monday on the stock market.  \n\nNon-farm data came out last Friday. It brought some concerns to the market, but I\u2019m gonna stick to my plan and keep buying more promising stocks. \n\n# Highlights:\n\n# 1. Non farm data2. Reddit IPO  3. Windows11 launches on 10/5\n\n\\-\n\n# Non farm payrolls out \n\nThe rising of Delta cases caused a dramatic drop - the monthly employment numbers went WAY lower than expected: 23.5k VS 72.5K, the unemployment rate also dropped to 5.2% compared to July.  \n\nMany experts consider this a signal of postponing \u201c the taper,\u201d which is a clear sign of slower growth along with uncertainty in the market. However, as wages and unemployment rate shows, it\u2019s not as bad as it looks. \n\nIn this case, I remain bullish in the short run. \n\n\\-\n\n# Reddit IPO = WSB IPO? \n\nThe birthplace of our beloved MEME stock, Reddit, is seeking to hire advisers for their IPO next year to GIT MORE $$$$. Targeting a 15$ billion valuation when listed on the stock market. I\u2019m expecting mayhem on meme stocks a week before Reddit\u2019s IPO.  We\u2019ll sit and wait before the show begins.  \n\n\\-\n\n# Windows 11 is one month away\n\nThe long awaited new windows OS will be released on October 5th as MSFT recently announced. It will be a free upgrade for you as long as you have a legit windows 10 in your devices. \n\nThat being said, as usual, the upgrade will roll out in phases - current windows 10 users will likely be offered an upgrade weeks after new products. Analysts estimate it will contribute 19% of MSFT\u2019s profit for 2021.  \n\nI personally am a big fan of MSFT in terms of their business model and outlook. New OS seems pretty decent and clean. So I will be adding more MSFT into my long term portfolio. Again. \ud83d\udcf7\n\nIf you feel the same way about Windows11, also checkout my take on MSFT here:   \n\n\nAlthough it won\u2019t be as nice and peaceful as last week, I\u2019m still expecting slightly bullish on the market this week ahead overall.  Uncertainty isn\u2019t a bearish sign in this case as nothing fundamentally impacts the market in the short run.   \n\n\nThanks for your time, good luck and stay high.",

        "selftext": "Netflix, even though it didnt break 600 yesterday, its certainly still bullish and especially after being in a channel for the last 7 months, i think its due for a break out relatively soon. Also with the miss in jobs and more stimulus entering the market as well as the tapering not starting until November (probably) Id say this next week is a break out week . Now i could be completely wrong and netflix could again go back down to low 500s but idk TA showed a strong support at 580s. \n\nI dont have any positions in it yet but plan on opening a call.\n\nModerna , on the weekly chart it shows that the stock has been respecting the lower 300s support and just now is breaking out of that 3ish week long channel , we will see what happens next week but over all im bullish on it after that break out, i have a few calls for next week and hoping they print.\n\nMsft, I  love this stock, one thing about it is that after it breaks out it consolidates for a bit before breaking out again. Its been coslidating around 300s for a while now so im expecting a break out soon. Plan on opening a position in it after seeing next weeks price action.\n\nFacebook \\^ same applies as msft.\n\nGoogle is a monster expecting it to probably each 3k this week if im being honest, usually after a pull google hits new highs and it did have a pull back this friday so yeah.\n\nOther than that i really have nothing else to say except whats yalls views on these stocks? Also what do yall use for TA? I tend to use 5,20,50,200 emas , vwap and the regular trend lines on the daily and weelky chart how about yall?",

I can't write for shit, so here are some facts in bullet points detailing each play (fundamentals and catalysts/reason to bag hold).\n\n# Proterra\n\n**Fundamentals :**\n\n* NTM TEV / Revenues = 4.88\n* NTM TEV / EBITDA = 23.10\n* Liabilities as a percentage of TEV = 34.1%\n* Mean street target (tip ranks) = 15.50 (46,78% upside, backed by BofA and Citigroup)\n\n**Catalyst :**\n\n* Infrastructure bill baby. $39 billion USD for public transit, with around $7.5 going directly towards replacing buses. Biggest competitor of PTRA on the EV bus market is a chinese company. Thankfully, a NDAA that was passed in a bipartisan fashion a year ago provides a restriction on funding to be used from a federal transit agency to a Chinese owned or operated company.\n* What specific aspects of the infrastructure bill might advantage PTRA (according to John Allen in the 08-11-2021 press release) :\n   * $800 million a year for 5 years guaranteed\n   * $2.5 billion, up to $5 billion for electric school buses\n   * $2.25 billion to electrify the ports\n   * $7.5 billion for charging infrastructure\n\n**Good reasons to buy in general :**\n\n* Only american EV bus company that also sells charging infrastructure, batteries, and powertrain\n   * Partnership with Thomas (school buses), LG (battery components), Vanhool (coaches), Frieghtliner (delivery trucks), Optimal EV (airport and hospital transit), Komatsu (construction equipment), Lightning motors (sprinter vans)\n* 2 decades of experience in a very young market with plenty of space to grow\n   * Bus with the biggest battery capacity and milage (300-ish miles compared to european buses with 100-200 miles)\n* Politically indifferent\n   * Conservative = protectionism = good for American PTRA\n   * Liberals = weird taxes on carbon emitting businesses = good for PTRA\n\n**The play :**\n\n* Expect a bump in price and price targets when the infrastructure deal passes.\n* Hold that shit till 2035\n\n# Paya Holdings, Inc.\n\n**Fundamentals :**\n\n* NTM TEV / Revenues = 5.05\n* NTM TEV / EBITDA = 18.22\n* Liabilities as a percentage of TEV = 61.7%\n* Mean street target (tip ranks) = 14.50 (44.71% upside, backed by Morgan Stanley, Truist, BTIG)\n\n**Catalyst :**\n\n* Voting to cut warrant-sponsored dilution from 17.7 mil shares to 4.6 mil shares happening on september 10.\n\n**Good reasons to buy in general :**\n\n* Very good multiples for a double digit growth company compared to peers (Paypal, Square, etc.).\n* Profitable as fuck @ 25.7% EBITDA margins\n* Institutions buying up like crazy with zero institution holding a net short position.\n* IV low as hell.\n\n**The play :**\n\n* Expect a bump in price on September 10.\n* Hold or sell that shit after it pops to 15$.

        "selftext": "**Summary:**\n\n* Affirm is a major player in the booming \u201cpoint of sale financing\u201d or \u201cbuy now pay later\u201d niche.\n* Affirm lets online shoppers choose an installment plan at checkout.\n* The point of sale financing market exploded during the pandemic and is expected to keep growing fast.\n* Competitor Afterpay was recently acquired by Square, and there is speculation that Affirm may be an acquisition target.\n\n**What they do:**\n\nAffirm operates a point-of-sale payment solution for consumers. Its payment network allows consumers to pay for purchases with an installment plan.  \n \n\nAffirm pays the merchant the full amount upfront. They charge an APR of 10 to 30 percent, depending on the plan and on the buyer\u2019s credit. The Affirm app makes it easy for buyers to keep track of payments and sends reminders.  \n \n\nAffirm also receives a fee from merchants. Online sellers have found that point-of-sale financing increases sales volume and reduces cart abandonment, so they are willing to pay for the service.  \n \n\nThere were over 12,000 active merchants using the Affirm platform in March 2021, more than double the number in the same quarter of 2020. Active consumers grew 60% to 5.4 million in the same period. Gross merchandise volume grew 83% to $2.3 billion.  \n \n\nAffirm has an exclusive relationship with Shopify ($SHOP), and provides point-of-sale financing to Shopify merchants.  \n \n\nShopify is a leading competitor to Amazon. They are growing at a wild rate: gross merchandise volume was up 119% in the last reported quarter and the number of merchants with Shopify stores has been rising at 126% a year. Shopify now powers over 1.7 million businesses in more than 175 countries.  \n \n\nAffirm\u2019s relationship with Shopify allows them to offer their services to an enormous and rapidly growing customer base.\n\n**Why they\u2019re spiking in interest:**  \n \n\nReddit mentions of $AFRM in the last 8 days leaped 875% from the previous 8-day period.  \n \n\nThe surge was kicked off by the August 3 news that Affirm will work with Apple ($AAPL) to provide installment plans for Apple device purchasers in Canada.  \n \n\nThat announcement was followed on August 5 with news that Square ($SQ) is acquiring Australian buy-now-pay-later provider Afterpay for $29 billion. Affirm shares gained 18% on the combined news.  \n \n\nThe Square/Afterpay combination will provide competition for Affirm, but it also brought attention to the sector.  \n \n\nThere has been speculation that another major player seeking to move into the buy-now-pay-later space will acquire Affirm rather than develop their own system.  \n \n\nShopify (which already owns 7.6% of Affirm), PayPal, and even card giants like Visa and Mastercard have been suggested as potentially interested in acquiring Affirm.  \n \n\nNotable comments from Reddit:  \n \n\n\"I\u2019m long on $AFRM. The financial sector is dinosaurs through and through. If you\u2019ve ever applied for (and received) a mortgage, it\u2019s a nightmare. It requires little imagination on my part for Affirm or \u201cGreen Sky\u201d to open up to home and auto loans.\"\n\n\\- PinBot1138  \n \n\n\u201cPeople should probably get AFRM for when it gets acquired for a free 30%.\u201d  \n \\- Lukebreit  \n \n\nSignal: Over 77% of the $AFRM float is held by institutions. Scottish investment management firm Baillie Gifford is the largest institutional holder, with over $75 million worth of shares.\n\n \n\n**Why $AFRM could be valuable:**\n\nThe buy-now-pay-later has enormous upward momentum. Sales have increased dramatically and the increase is expected to continue. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMcKinsey &amp; Company\u2019s annual POS Financing Survey found that about 60% of consumers are likely to use point-of-sale financing over the next six to 12 months.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAffirm founder and CEO Max Levchin has a record of developing successful and innovative payment systems: he\u2019s one of the founders of PayPal.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAffirm does not charge late payment fees and has a fixed monthly payment system. This feature is attractive to users who are concerned with the complexities of credit card billing and payment.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAffirm\u2019s Net Promoter Score - a measure of customer loyalty - places the company at 78, above Amazon and just below Apple. 64% of transactions are from repeat users, and repeat customers spend an average of $2,200 per year. Delinquency rates were just over 1% in 2020.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSix of 10 analysts covering the stock rate it \u201cBuy\u201d, with the other 4 placing it at \u201cHold\u201d. The consensus price target is $76.71, 14% above the current level.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRapid user growth, high customer retention, and a rapidly expanding market add up to very strong growth prospects for $AFRM.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe stock has dropped to under 50% of its post-IPO surge of $140 per share and has settled into a steady band in the $60-$70 range.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPost-IPO hype often drives new listings to unrealistic valuations. When they drop back to a more realistic level many retail investors become frustrated and drop out. That leaves a core of institutional holders and a strong base for appreciation of positive news.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**What the risks are:**\n\nAffirm is not profitable and is not expected to achieve profitability soon. The Company also has a high debt/equity ratio of 87.95%. The Company has adequate working capital but the combination of debt and losses is still a concern.  \n \n\nAffirm operates in a highly competitive market. Right now that market is dominated by relatively new companies like Afterpay, and Klarna. The sector\u2019s rapid growth could attract competition from larger companies with greater financial capacity than Affirm.  \n \n\nAffirm faces credit risk. Default rates have been extremely low, but unexpected events could drive them high enough to affect the Company\u2019s results.  \n \n\nAffirm is exposed to a potential economic downturn. A recession could reduce the discretionary purchases that drive much of the Company\u2019s gross merchandise volume and increase default rates.  \n \n\nThe buy-now-pay-later sector could attract increased government regulation, which could affect the Company's results and stock price.  \n \n\n***Bottom line:***\u00a0*Affirm\u2019s lack of profitability makes it a speculative play. But its rapid revenue growth and established position in an exploding market make it an interesting speculative play. There is strong potential for acquisition and for medium to long-term growth. Watch for the release of Q4 and full FY 2021 results, scheduled for Sept. 9.*",

        "selftext": "Listen up you autistic retards this shit is serious. Coinbase has basically been hoeing hardcore since its direct listing in April. This bitch has been getting reamed for 4 months BUT \\*cue picture\\* let's take a look at the chart and see what's up\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[COIN Daily Chart](https://preview.redd.it/x6qvq5tiuvk71.png?width=2358&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e3eec4721d35b1315ec0be5e51129e93926fc00f)\n\nNow i ain't no fucking artist and i may have a learning disability but I know a cup when i see one and if you look at this chart, even in ur peripheries you'll notice a small cup and handle that's formed in between the support lines, you'll also notice the middle support line recently did an r/S flip i.e. went from being a resistance line to support line.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow with the small cup in place it may be high time for Coinbase to continue this trend up and fill up the bigger cup by flying back to the 420-450 range. Also the velocity at which alt currencies move if there is a decent rally in the next few weeks, there's potential this sees an even bigger push to go back up where it came from. The MACD looks bullish with potentially indicating this reversal will become a rally. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n However, the fundamentals are also insanely undervalued right now. I'm talking this thing has a mufuckin current PE ratio of 28 only considering the first 2 quarters this year i.e. NOT COUNTING any estimates from q3 and q4 this year. I'm talking they made rev of about a billion dollars in FY2020 with about 350 mill in net income, Q1 2021 they made over 1.6 billion in revenue and more than doubled net income relative to the ENTIRE PREVIOUS YEAR.  Q2 2021 they made revenue of 2.23 billion netting 1.6 fucking billion in a damn quarter. They're literally reaching exponential growth as we speak and lets be honest the industry they're in is primed to grow substantially in the foreseeable future. Now if you look at their guidance for q3 and q4 they are not expecting to beat the net income of q2 but they also expect continued profitability and could potentially beat forecasts IF certain coins that are traded on their platform rally hard. For comparison, Square is trading at a FORWARD PE (2024) of 73, PayPal FORWARD PE 2024 of 32, I could go on and on. So really their current annual PE is considerably less than 28 once earnings come in for q3 and q4.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is a cash cow of a company fundamentals and technicals seem to be aligning nicely. I think you can't go wrong with far out leaps however you must know that I am retarded and you would be an even bigger retard if you listened to me, jk you prolly can't even read so I'm not worried.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL:DR COIN to the moon fam!!!\n\nEdit: I\u2019m not currently in a position but considering loading the $300 calls exp dec 21",

        "selftext": "Just wondering what people's thoughts are on Affirm earning's on Sep 9th? \n\nSome things I've been considering...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. There is a possibility that earnings could miss estimates... even though they estimated low, around 225 M for this quarter. This would be due to Peloton shitting the bed. Before the Amazon deal... Peloton was Affirm's largest customer. The Peloton collapse will affect Affirm.\n2. According to a Simply Wall Street article anything below $270 M will not be seen by the street as a surprise. So if Affirm beats... it has to be substantial.\n3. So much depends on the guidance they will offer and more info about the Amazon deal. I'd like to see what they predict. I believe the guidance regarding this will determine whether or not the SP rises or sinks. Amazon is a monster... and this deal was huge for Affirm.\n4. It will be really interesting to see Apple's performance in Canada with PayBright. A company that Affirm acquired. I called my local Apple store (in Canada) and spoke with sales supervisor. They told me approximately 2/10 purchases are funded via Paybright! Anecdotal yes... small sample size.. yes... but you can extrapolate this... something to think about.\n5. There is a lot of momentum in this space. We saw this with SQ's all stock offering worth 29 B for After pay.\n6. Affirm has been in business since 2012. Think about all that data and analysis they have collected on borrowers! That's a gold mine and in this day and age data analytics is everything. \n7. Which leads me to potential suitors for Affirm... Apple, Shopify, Amazon, WallMArt... hell I bet even JPM is interested. Considering traditional banking will be taken to the cleaners if they don't do anything... soon. My money is on Shop to take them out as they own 8% already.\n8. Max Levchin the CEO is switched on. He's been here before and can execute. Just look at PayPal.\n\nSo your turn... what do you think?\n\nFull disclosure... 23 calls. Nov $70's and Jan $85's.",

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, September 8, 2021**\n\n*Hey Psychos! So there was no recap yesterday, got mixed up and didn't have the time*\n\nStocks fell today, extending the previous day\u2019s decline in the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Dow Jones (DIA) as market participants continue to digest the recent August Job Report and concerns surrounding rising coronavirus infections across the US. The tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) 0.33% down while the SPY and DIA fell 0.11% and 0.2% respectively. The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, fell 1.10%.\n\nYung-Yu Ma. Chief Investment Strategist at BMO Capital said, \u201cWe think the fundamental drivers of strong earnings, an accommodative Fed, and a still healthy appetite for risk taking are really what\u2019s going to support the market for the rest of the year.\u201d \n\nThe Labor Department released their monthly unemployment report, which showed hiring in August slow down dramatically as the US continues to battle massive spikes in coronavirus Delta cases in certain parts of the country, mainly the South/Southeast (according to the CDC, roughly \u2153 of all COVID-related hospitalizations are in Texas and Florida as both states deal with record coronavirus cases and low hospital capacity). Due to this surge and the reimposition of pandemic-era restrictions in areas with high transmission rates, employment numbers came in shockingly low compared to estimates and the previous month\u2019s numbers. Here are the numbers.\n\n* **Change in non-farm payrolls:** \\+235,000 vs. +733,000 expected and a revised +1.053 million in July\n* **Unemployment rate, August:** 5.2% vs. 5.2% expected and 5.4% in July\n* **Average hourly earnings, month-over-month:** 0.6% vs. 0.3% expected and 0.4% in July \n* **Average hourly earnings, year-over-year:** 4.3% vs. 3.9% expected and 4.0% in July\n\nPresident Biden said of the report, \u201cWhile I know some wanted to see a larger number today and so did I, what we\u2019ve seen this year is continued growth, month after month, in job creation. This is the kind of growth that makes our economy stronger.\u201d\n\nMembers of the Fed have consistently signaled they will be looking especially closely at labor market data to determine when to start tapering the pandemic-era quantitative easing program. Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said the August Jobs Report could be his signal to hit the \u201csubstantial further progress mark\u201d the Fed stipulated in December and begin tapering. He said, \u201cI think that one more good job report if it\u2019s in the 850,000 to 1 million range will be sufficient to claim substantial further progress in employment for tapering.\u201d August was not the report they were looking for. \n\nIn its latest Beige Book, which is basically a report by the Federal Reserve on current economic conditions, members said the economy downshifted slightly due to Delta variant concerns. The report stated, \u201cThe deceleration in economic activity was largely attributable to a pullback in dining out, travel, and tourism in most Districts, reflecting safety concerns due to the rise of the Delta variant, and, in many cases, international travel restrictions.\u201d \n\nIn the US, the surge in infections in certain parts of the nation continues unabated, with hospitalizations this weekend roughly 300% higher than Labor Day weekend in 2020, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. The surge in patients comes as the highly contagious Delta variant continues to spread across the US, and coincided with a weekend that saw a spike in travel. According to the Transportation Security Administration, more than 3.5 million people travelled across the country on Friday and Saturday for the Labor Day holiday, despite the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s recommendation for unvaccinated people to refrain from traveling. \n\n[https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/sep/07/us-covid-patients-hospitals-surge](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/sep/07/us-covid-patients-hospitals-surge)\n\n[https://www.kq2.com/content/news/Health-officials-urge-caution-as-students-return-to-class-after-long-holiday-weekend--575252751.html](https://www.kq2.com/content/news/Health-officials-urge-caution-as-students-return-to-class-after-long-holiday-weekend--575252751.html)\n\nIn other news, the battle between Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos is heating up! Last week, SpaceX sent a filing to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) accusing Amazon of using regulatory and legal means to stifle and slowdown competition. SpaceX said, \u201cWhile SpaceX has proceeded to deploy more than 1,700 satellites, Amazon has yet to even attempt to address the radiofrequency interference and orbital debris issues that must be resolved before Amazon can deploy its constellation\u201d and suggested \u201cas it falls behind competitors \\[Amazon\\] is more than willing to use regulatory and legal processes to create obstacles designed to delay those competitors from leaving Amazon even further behind\u201d (ouch).\n\nIn response, Amazon said, Whether it is launching satellites with unlicensed antennas, launching rockets without approval, building an unapproved launch tower, or re-opening a factory in violation of a shelter-in-place order, the conduct of SpaceX and other Musk-led companies makes their view plain: rules are for other people, and those who insist upon or even simply request compliance are deserving of derision and ad hominem attacks. If the FCC regulated hypocrisy, SpaceX would keep the commission very busy.\u201d SpaceX won this one IMO, that was a nasty burn. \n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Job openings in July as measured by JOLTS soared by a staggering 749,000 \u2014 hitting yet another all-time high just shy of 11 million open jobs, enough to eliminate most of the current slack in the labor market.\n* El Salvador became the first country in the world to roll out a digital currency as a form of legal tender, allowing businesses and customers to transact using blockchain. There are some initial teething problems with the launch of the Chivo, the country\u2019s wallet app and locals being unfamiliar with the technology. Digital currencies also fell, though I don\u2019t know unknown if the drop is correlated to the launch in El Salvador\n* Damn, the buy-now-pay-later (BNPL) market is red-hot right now. Following Sqaure\u2019s (SQ) acquisition of Afterpay for $29 billion and Amazon (AMZN) partnering up with Affirm (AFRM) to offer BNPL on Amazon, PayPal (PYPL) is now stepping into the arena by acquiring Japanese BNPL firm Paidy for $2.7 billion\n* Twitter (TWTR) launched a global test of a tool it calls Communities, a feature similar to Facebook Groups that gives users a way to tweet to people with similar interests. This follows the recent launch of Super Follows, where content creators can charge their followers for their content. \n* Applied Materials (AMAT) announced it was releasing two new tools aimed at improving efficiency of making a new class of chips for electric vehicles. The machines announced on Wednesday are designed for chips made from a material called silicon carbide. Such chips are gaining traction in electric vehicles like those made by Tesla Inc because they are more efficient and lighter in weight than standard silicon chips for transmitting power from a car's battery to its motors, helping improve range. Silicon carbide chips are difficult to manufacture because the material is very hard\n* **\\*\\*Please note that current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect closing prices\\*\\***\n* ASML target raised by Wells Fargo (WFC) from $800 to$975 at Overweight. Stock currently around $856. ASML is probably the most important and influential tech company you\u2019ve never heard of.\n* Chipotle (CMG) with two target raises.

        "selftext": "Living in today\u2019s word is quite different than growing up in the 80s. For example you can find a job by picking up your phone and possibly be at work within the same day or even hours. If you want to know where a friend or loved one is you do not have to go looking for them or wait until you know they are going to be home you can simply look at their location, and if you need to talk to them you don\u2019t have to go through an operator you can simply just call or text them. Today the amount of work abundance and money making opportunities is honestly quite incredible. But what about money, there was no e-currency or tokens back then, heck the only thing there was were stocks, gold and money. As time went on we started seeing the internet come out and with that is when the e-currencies started being developed like PayPal and such. Now we are developing into a time where your cash is starting to become annoying and the governance of a currency is becoming more widespread known as fraud money. My point is that over a period of only 40 years or so, we have evolved passed using certain pieces of technologies and other every day items that at the time we thought we would never be able to live without, but as time went on these objects became obsolete and other newer, more efficient objects are now the new normal. I believe this is the way the new currency is moving into our world, just in an even expedited manner. Only time will tell though.",

It is now trading at year to date lows and offers significant value upside to patient investors. Following are the highlights from Opera\u2019s Q2 \u201921 results.\n\n* 87% QoQ Revenue Growth to $60.2M \u2014 A beat by $4.1M(7% beat to midpoint)\n* 17% sequential increase in revenue \u2014 Largest increase since going public\n* Breakeven adjusted EBITDA\n* 95% gross margin\n* 49% sequential increase in Opera News revenue\n* Increased FY \u201921 revenue guidance 2nd time this year to $242-247M ( 48% YoY growth at midpoint)\n* Adjusted EBITDA FY \u201921 guidance of $10-$20M\n* Cash, cash equivalent and marketable securities of \\~$200M\n* After Seeing good results, reiterated plans to continue investing AEBITDA growth into growth objectives of growing Opera News in Western markets, scaling Dify in additional geographies and new products, and investing in the Opera Gaming division.\n\n**Opera By the Numbers**\n\nI am using data from 2020 Annual filing(20-F) and the most recent monetization of Opera's 29% preferred shares to make the case on how undervalued Opera is and how market is not giving any valuation to Opera's core business which is generating $245M of annual revenue(FY' 21 estimated) and aggressively investing for future growth by plowing all adjusted EBITDA growth from FY' 20 to expand into new verticals and geographies.\n\n* Market Cap: \\~$1B\n   * Cash, cash equivalent &amp; marketable securities : \\~$200M\n   * Book value of starmaker(35% discount/DLOM) : $55M\n   * Book value of Nanobank : $266M\n   * Book value of Opay(15% discount/DLOM) : $49M\n* Opera Core= 1$B - $200M - $370M = $430M\n   * Opera GM = 95%\n   * Opera's AEBITDA Goal = 25%-30% of revenue\n      * Proved from Q4'20 results that they can operate at 28% AEBITDA margin\n      * Opera's FY'21 Investments - All adjusted EBITDA growth in FY '21 is invested back in business to expand in Europe and N. America\n* Opera FY' 21 Forecast(high end) - $247M revenue, $20M AEBITDA\n   * **Trading at \\~1.7 x FY'21 Est. Revenue**\n\n**The recent $400M Opay funding round from Softbank at $2B valuation and subsequent monetization of 29% of Opera's preferred share in OPay at $50M shows how undervalued Opera minority investments are on the books**.\n\n* Opay is valued at \\~$2B post money, and although Opera has not officially disclosed its latest stake, as per my calculations, Opera\u2019 stake of 13.1%(10.24% Preferred shares + 2.86% Ordinary shares) got diluted to \\~10.5% after the latest $400M funding round from Softbank. Since then, Opera sold 29% of its preferred shares, its latest stake dropped to \\~8% which is now worth \\~$160M compared to $49M which they have on the books.\n* Starmaker\u2019s 19.6% stake is valued on the books at $55M valuing starmaker at \\~$280M. Similar to Opay, Starmaker,  which is profitable and has Q1 FY '21 revenue run rate of \\~$180M -- 41% sequential increase from $127M run rate at end of 2020 -- , is valued on Opera\u2019s book at massive discount.\n* Nanobank, where Opera has 42% stake and valued on books at $266M,  has been sequentially growing at 10-15% since its covid bottom and should reach pre-covid run rate of $120M during Q1 2022.\n\nWhichever multiple one is comfortable with for Opera Core business, which has gross margins of 95% with 25-30% AEBITDA margin profile, growing at 48% YoY in FY'21 and should continue to grow between 20-25% for next several years due to investments into growing new legs in fintech/cashback and gaming and also expanding in Europe and America where advertising impression are 10x better monetized compared to Africa and Asia, where majority of its 400M users are currently located, it is hard not to see how undervalued Opera is.\n\n* If you use 4x revenue multiple with the book valuation on minority stakes, Opera should be valued at \\~1.6B ( \\~$15 per ADS) -- 66% appreciation potential based on $9 SP.\n* If you use 6x multiple with book valuation on minority stakes, Opera should be valued at \\~2.1B ( \\~20 per ADS) --122% Appreciation potential\n* If you use 8x multiple with book valuation on minority stakes, Opera should be valued at \\~2.6B ( \\~25 per ADS) -- 177% Appreciation potential\n* If you start applying growth multiples to Opera with the assumption that Opera can grow faster than 20-25% with modest success in Gaming and Fintech initiatives and get to 20-30% AEBITDA margin profile by FY\u201923, you can assign a 10x-12x revenue multiple to Opera and valuation would be much higher.\n\n**Opera History**\n\nOpera Ltd, the Opera browser company, was established in Norway in 1996  and is one of the few survivors from the Internet Explorer era of early 2000 . It was bought by a consortium led by Yahui Zhou in 2016 for $600M. In 2018, It was listed on Nasdaq as OPRA.\n\nNow, Opera is no longer just a browser company. In fact, its core browser business only contributes about half of its revenue through search and ad monetization. The other half of revenue is contributed by advertising, mostly via its Opera news app which is now a top 10 news app on both android and iOS in all of Africa, Germany, France, UK and now in the US. What Opera has done successfully is to take its browser user base of 300 million MAUs and then get them to other services like News, Fintech and Gaming. Opera calls it Browser+ strategy.\n\nIt also used its browser user base to spin off 2 very successful businesses:\n\n* OPay, a leading mobile wallet and mobile money operator in Nigeria where it had 13.1% stake(as of FY\u2019 20) which most recently raised $400M at $2B valuation.\n* Nanobank, a micro credit provider in emerging markets of Africa, Asia and Latin America where it has 42% stake. Nanobank was doing $117M quarterly revenue at 30% AEBITDA margin pre-covid, but it is still recovering from covid impact in its biggest market - India and had Q2' 21 revenue of $57M at \\~3% AEBITDA margin. Opera merged its fintech business in India and Kenya with Mobi Magic to form Nanobank with 42% stake in August 2020.\n\nIt also opportunistically invested $30M for 19.35% stake in starmaker -- a social network for music lovers and Karaoke artists -- and is growing like a wildfire, 250% YoY growth to $180M run rate in Q1' 21 with sequential acceleration of 41% from $127M revenue run rate in Q4'20.\n\n**Opera Products**\n\n**Opera browser :** Amongst the giants, Apple Safari and Google Chrome, Opera has built a niche and cult following of users who like Opera browser for many of its differentiated features - Integrated Messaging apps, Integrated music players, built in VPN, ad blocker and many more. Opera browser for desktop is available on  MacOS, Windows and Linux and has seen install base growing from 42 million MAUs in 2016 to 80 million MAUs in 2020, a CAGR of 17%. Opera Mobile browser and its data saving browser Opera Mini, have grown from 164 million to 190 million MAUs, a CAGR of 4%.\n\n**Opera GX :** Opera GX, the gaming browser which Opera launched for Gamers with differentiated features like CPU and RAM limiter, Gaming aesthetics, discord integration and Gaming corner which surfaces deals and news related to Games. Since its launch in June 2019, It has grown to over 10 million MAUs in just over 2 years.\n\n**Opera News App :** Opera News is AI based News aggregator which personalizes the news based on their browsing history. It is #1 news app in all of the major African economies  - Nigeria, South Africa, Egypt, Kenya and Ghana. Since its launch in Germany, France, UK and US in Q4'20, It has become #1 or #2 news apps in Germany, France and the UK and in the top 10 in the US. It has grown at 42% CAGR -- from 72 million MAUs in Q4'17 to 211 million MAU in Q4'20 and is growing revenue at 160% YoY as of Q4'20.\n\n**Opera Ad Network :** Opera is one of the top 10 publishers of media impression given its scale in browser and its news app. Instead of relying on 3rd party ad networks, Opera has launched its own ad network, primarily to serve its own ad inventory and since its launch 2 years ago, it has grown at 130% YoY. It is tracking to $80 million in FY'21 revenue, 50% growth in daily revenue run rate year to date.\n\n**Dify :** Opera acquired 2 small companies in 2020 - Pocosys and Fjord bank and used Pocosys to build a new fintech product called Dify which was launched in Spain in Feb '21. Initially Dify will provide an integrated mobile wallet, Debit Card and Cashback for its users with plans to launch additional services like BNPL/Credit and fractionalized share investing to its 50M active users in Europe.\n\n**Opera Gaming :** Early 2021, Opera acquired leading 2D gaming engine company, YoYo Games and launched a Gaming division combining it with its gaming focused browser Opera GX, which has grown quite rapidly to 10M active users since its launch in June 2019. Opera plans to build a gaming community around these 10M+ users and its thousands of GameMaker developers and has plans to launch a steam like service --Gamebox-- to offer gaming publishers a platform to monetize their games.\n\n**Business Model**\n\n* **Search revenue :** Opera primarily makes money from its 80 million desktop MAUs when they conduct searches from its search bar.  Opera has revenue sharing contracts with Google and Yandex.\n* **Advertising revenue :**  Opera makes advertising revenue 2 ways:\n   * Revenue shares from book marked link, speed dials and other forms of affiliate advertising on its browser. Each million Opera GX users bring $2.8M in yearly revenue and Opera is in early innings of monetizing this gaming user base.\n   * Native advertising in its Opera News App, growing at 160% YoY.\n* **Other revenue :** This low margin revenue comes from providing professional services to Opay. This is being phased out completely by FY'21 as Opay has scaled its operation with its own staff.\n\n**Financials**\n\nOpera Search and Advertising revenue have grown at \\~22% CAGR, from $33.5M in Q2' 18 to $60.2M in Q2' 21. This revenue comes at \\~95% gross margin and has AEBITDA margin profile of 20-30%. Opera has been investing for growth so it's AEBITDA margin have fluctuated from 0% to 41% since its IPO.\n\nOpera has forecasted FY' 21 revenue of $242-247M , 48% growth over FY \u201820. It has forecasted FY \u201821 AEBITDA of $10-20M, despite its stated objective of investing up to $100M into scaling its fintech initiative, Dify in FY' 21 and investing for growth in Opera News, Dify and Opera Gaming.\n\nWith covid recovery, momentum in its advertising business, over 10% browser growth in EU, and ramp up of Opera News App in US and Europe, Opera has projected to grow its search and advertising revenue at 25% YoY for next several years.\n\nOpera has always taken a very conservative approach with its forecast and has not assumed any significant contributions from its Fintech(Dify) and Gaming(YoYo Games) initiatives in its FY '21 guidance. Assuming moderate success from these initiatives where Opera is investing over $100M, Opera should easily grow at upwards of 30% YoY for the next several years and reach around $500M revenue in FY \u201823 at 25%+ AEBITDA margins.\n\n**Opera's Minority Stake**\n\n* **Opay -** Opay is leading mobile money wallet in Nigeria and has expanded to Egypt in early '21. In 2019, Opay raised $170M at a valuation of $500M in external funding from Softbank, Meituan and was doing $300M in transaction processing volume(TPV) per month. Since then it has grown to over 10 million MAUs. In 2020, Opay TPV/month grew 4.5 times -- from $450M in Jan to $2B in December. Most recently in June'21, Opay raised $400M at a $2B valuation. Opera also monetized 29% of its preferred share stake for $50M and has left around 8% of stake to participate in future growth of Opay.\n* **Starmaker -** Starmaker app, which has an installed base of over 100 million users,  is a social network for music lovers and Karaoke artists and is top 5 grossing music app in google play store in South East Asia, Middle East, South Asia and Europe.  When Opera invested $30M for a19.35% stake in Nov'18, it had a $17M run rate.  Since then it has been growing like a wildfire -- a CAGR of 157% in 2.5 years --  with YoY growth accelerating recently to 250% to  $180M Q1 '21 run rate and with sequential acceleration of 41% from $127M Q4'20 run rate.\n* **Nanobank -** Nanobank offers Micro lending and other financial services to the underbanked and underserved population in India, Indonesia, Kenya and Mexico via its mobile apps. Last year, Opera merged its micro lending operations in India and Kenya with Mobi Magic to form Nanobank for a 42% stake. Nanobank collectively has over 50 million users of its mobile app and has recently expanded into Mexico with credit card features for its underbanked population. Nanobank was growing revenue at a CAGR of 295% pre covid - scaling from $22M Q1 '19 revenue at 24% AEBITDA margin to $92M  Q4 '19 revenue at 41% AEBITDA margin. It has not yet completely recovered from covid in its largest market India and had $57M Q1 \u201821 revenue at 3% AEBITDA margin. Opera has stated that, with the expansion of Nanobank in Mexico and other Latin American countries, they expect Nanobank to come to pre covid quarterly revenue run rate of $120M at 30%+ AEBITDA margin next year.\n\n**Opera SUM-OF-PART valuation**\n\n1. **Conservative/Bear Case**\n\nStarmaker announced 3x growth in 2020 and $127m run rate at the end of Q4 \u201820. In Q1 \u201821, it has revenue run rate of $180M. I am using $45M as Q1 revenue and applying sequential growth of 25%, 15% and 5% to get to Q4 revenue of $68M.  Using arithmetic series sum over $45M Q1 \u201821 revenue and $68M Q4 \u201821 revenue gives 2021 revenue of $226m \\[ 4\\*(45+68)/2 \\]\n\nOpay does not report revenue run rate but TPV. Since Opay reported 4.5x TPV growth in 2020, TPV grew from $445M in January 2020 to $2B in December 2020. I am taking arithmetic series sum to get the total TPV of $14.7B for 2020 \\[12 \\* (445 + 2000)/2 \\] . Although Opera did not reveal the TPV for March 2021, they stated that the TPV is growing nicely. Along with additional product launches in additional countries, I am projecting 2x growth in TPV in 2021(a deceleration from 4.5x growth in 2020), with a TPV of $2B for Jan 2021 and $4B for Dec 2021. Taking the arithmetic series sum gives an expected 2021 TPV of $36B. I have looked at airtel Mobile Money and M-pesa revenue to TPV ratio ( 0.008 for airtel and 0.006 for M-pesa). Applying the average of 0.007 revenue to TPV ratio, gives Opay 2020 revenue of $103M and 2021 revenue of $252M. Currently Opay services are heavily discounted so their take rate is much lower than more established players like airtel and M-Pesa. Opay reported 2020 revenue of $69M and I am forecasting $21M as Q1 \u201821 revenue and applying 20% sequential growth rate through FY \u201821 gives Q4 \u201821 revenue of $37M. Using Arithmetic series sum, gives forecasted FY \u201821 revenue of $116M.\n\nBefore we do the sum of the part valuation of Opera, let's look at comparable companies :\n\n* Upstart holding(UPST), which is growing 200% YoY in FY \u201821,  is trading at 20x revenue multiple. It has a lower margin profile than Nanobank though . However, I am using only 6x multiple for Nanobank since it is projected to grow revenue at 29% compared to 100% for UPST. Nanobank is expected to achieve pre covid revenue run rate of $120M in Q1 \u201822 and as per my estimate, it should grow more than 100% YoY in FY\u201922.\n* Pinterest and Snap commanded a 50-70x revenue multiple during their 150% growth phase. I am using 8x multiple for starmaker.\n* Klarna, AfterPay, Square commanded 30-40x revenue multiple during 200+% revenue growth, I am using 8x revenue multiple for Opay\n\n**\ud83d\udcf7**\n\nThe above sum of part analysis is done using a super conservative valuation just to highlight the massive disconnect in market valuation of Opera\u2019s stock price. Opera and all its minority stakes are in hyper growth mode, and if one were to apply growth multiples, it can easily more than double this conservative sum-of-part valuation.\n\n1. **Base Case**\n\nThe base case assumes the market will give Opera\u2019s high gross margin(\\~95%) and 25-30% AEBITDA business, a higher multiple with a revenue forecasted to grow at 25% for next several years and valuing Opay and Starmaker which are growing upwards of 150% YoY a 30 to 40 multiple which similar companies have commanded during their hyper growth phase.\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\n1. **Bull Case**\n\nAs if Opera is not undervalued enough, Opera also has 2 new growth initiatives which could offer \\*significant\\* additional upside to base case.\n\n* Opera has ambitious growth plans with a new fintech initiative, called Dify, in Europe. What I like is the tight coupling of Cashback/Coupons/Payment/CryptoWallet in the browser. Imagine 10% of 50M users of opera browser in Europe use dify, and spend an average of $500/year, Opera could get $2.5B/year of transactions/payment through them. If average cashback is 5% of transaction amount and Opera\u2019s take rate is 30%, dify\u2019s revenue will be $38M/year. Although too soon, if Opera\u2019s is successful in getting 10% of its browser users in Europe to use Dify or gain additional browser users due to popularity of Dify and launch additional product like BNPL, one could argue that Dify, in itself, can grow into $1-2B business in next couple of years. You can see how Klarna, Afterpay are valued in private/public valuations today. For comparison, think Honey, which Paypal bought in 2018 for $4B dollars, for 14 million users generating $100M of revenue and the Cashback aspect of Dify is just one part of the overall Dify value proposition.\n* Opera also recently bought YoYo Games, makers of the popular indie 2D game engine, game maker. Time will tell if they can compete against powerhouses like Unity or Roblox, but you have to give the benefit of doubt to Yahui Zhou, the 60% owner of Opera. He has a knack for identifying boring assets and turning them into growth engines. Who would have thought that the Opera Browser business, which he bought for $600M, can launch many new and exciting businesses and also grow its core with differentiated offerings. We just need to wait and see what the future brings for this.\n* Opera also bought a bank in Europe, Fjord Bank. They have not shared their plans on what they are going to do here, but if they have ambition to be neobank like N26 or revolut, Opera can quickly scale this neobank given its large user base. They can offer investment services once they reach critical mass as part of this fintech offering.\n\nAssuming Dify and Gaming takes off, I do expect significant revenue expansion of Opera Core from $250M-260M in FY \u201821(55% YoY growth), to $360-380M in FY \u201822( 45% YoY growth), and to $480-520M in 2023(26% YoY). This growth would be at 20-30% AEBITDA margin. This type of growth commands a revenue multiple of 20+.\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\n**Catalyst**\n\n* Continued momentum in Opera Ads, improved monetization of Opera News in US and Europe can provide upside to conservative FY '21 guidance of $245M by $10-$15M\n* Scale out of its fintech initiative Dify to Germany and France to its 50 million MAUs in Europe at low CAC will yield additional revenue upside. Paypal bought Honey for $4B for its 14 million users generating $100M in annual revenue in 2018. If Opera can convert 10-15% of its 50 million users to its Dify/Cashback product, It can contribute $50M+ of incremental revenue in FY '22.\n* Continued growth in its minority stakes - Nanobank, Starmaker and OPay will provide additional upside to already low valuation.\n* A funding event/IPO of Nanobank and Starmaker can further unlock value of its minority stakes.\n* Continued momentum in Opera GX along with launch of Gamebox service will bring a viral effect and can help Opera double its Opera GX MAUs from 10 million to 20 million by early next year, bringing in additional $30M of FY'22 revenue.\n* A potential partnership with Oprah, and marketing Opera as Oprah's browser could bring in visibility and brand awareness in the US and can help Opera gain additional 10+ million users of its product in the US)\n* Continued scrutiny and regulation of big tech in the US and Europe is positive for smaller players like Opera.\n* Once Opera gets institution visibility, I think it can easily trade into $50+ after getting growth multiple.\n\n**Short Report**\n\nOpera was the target of [Hindenburg short report](https://hindenburgresearch.com/opera-phantom-of-the-turnaround/) back in Jan 2020. more than 18 months have passed since then time has proven that short thesis wrong. With the benefit of time on my side, following is the rebuttal to that short report.\n\n[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1F\\_3HbFJ2\\_vQeKWl\\_JEzgbH7fJXZzniAtMSm80pqBows/edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1F_3HbFJ2_vQeKWl_JEzgbH7fJXZzniAtMSm80pqBows/edit)\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nOverall, I think risk-reward weigh heavily on Opera long side and offer significant upside opportunity to patient investors.\n\n*Disclosure/Disclaimer : \\*\\*\\*This is not investment advice or recommendation.

They are chinese so hard to trust. Company could be taken private and nobody knows if they will be relisted.

        "selftext": "Good morning degenerates, autists, and intellectually deficients.\n\nI have been lurking on this sub for the longest time, occasionally making some money on the juicy DDs posted here. Today, I felt like giving back by shining some light on 2 companies that have seemingly been forgotten by our community (retards typically have poor working memory, so you are forgiven). I can't write for shit, so here are some facts in bullet points detailing each play (fundamentals and catalysts/reason to bag hold).\n\n# Proterra\n\n**Fundamentals :**\n\n* NTM TEV / Revenues = 4.88\n* NTM TEV / EBITDA = 23.10\n* Liabilities as a percentage of TEV = 34.1%\n* Mean street target (tip ranks) = 15.50 (46,78% upside, backed by BofA and Citigroup)\n\n**Catalyst :**\n\n* Infrastructure bill baby. $39 billion USD for public transit, with around $7.5 going directly towards replacing buses. Biggest competitor of PTRA on the EV bus market is a chinese company. Thankfully, a NDAA that was passed in a bipartisan fashion a year ago provides a restriction on funding to be used from a federal transit agency to a Chinese owned or operated company.\n* What specific aspects of the infrastructure bill might advantage PTRA (according to John Allen in the 08-11-2021 press release) :\n   * $800 million a year for 5 years guaranteed\n   * $2.5 billion, up to $5 billion for electric school buses\n   * $2.25 billion to electrify the ports\n   * $7.5 billion for charging infrastructure\n\n**Good reasons to buy in general :**\n\n* Only american EV bus company that also sells charging infrastructure, batteries, and powertrain\n   * Partnership with Thomas (school buses), LG (battery components), Vanhool (coaches), Frieghtliner (delivery trucks), Optimal EV (airport and hospital transit), Komatsu (construction equipment), Lightning motors (sprinter vans)\n* 2 decades of experience in a very young market with plenty of space to grow\n   * Bus with the biggest battery capacity and milage (300-ish miles compared to european buses with 100-200 miles)\n* Politically indifferent\n   * Conservative = protectionism = good for American PTRA\n   * Liberals = weird taxes on carbon emitting businesses = good for PTRA\n\n**The play :**\n\n* Expect a bump in price and price targets when the infrastructure deal passes.\n* Hold that shit till 2035\n\n# Paya Holdings, Inc.\n\n**Fundamentals :**\n\n* NTM TEV / Revenues = 5.05\n* NTM TEV / EBITDA = 18.22\n* Liabilities as a percentage of TEV = 61.7%\n* Mean street target (tip ranks) = 14.50 (44.71% upside, backed by Morgan Stanley, Truist, BTIG)\n\n**Catalyst :**\n\n* Voting to cut warrant-sponsored dilution from 17.7 mil shares to 4.6 mil shares happening on september 10.\n\n**Good reasons to buy in general :**\n\n* Very good multiples for a double digit growth company compared to peers (Paypal, Square, etc.).\n* Profitable as fuck @ 25.7% EBITDA margins\n* Institutions buying up like crazy with zero institution holding a net short position.\n* IV low as hell.\n\n**The play :**\n\n* Expect a bump in price on September 10.\n* Hold or sell that shit after it pops to 15$. You do you.\n\nProof of positions : [https://imgur.com/gallery/Ch54jd6](https://imgur.com/gallery/Ch54jd6)\n\n**8000 shares of PAYA @ 10.42 + 100 Sep17'21 10C @ 1.05**\n\n**6000 shares of PTRA @ 11.08**",

        "selftext": "Listen up you autistic retards this shit is serious. Coinbase has basically been hoeing hardcore since its direct listing in April. This bitch has been getting reamed 4 and a half months and counting but \\*cue picture\\* let's take a look at the chart and see what's up\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[CB Daily Chart](https://preview.redd.it/aqjaxo37nvk71.png?width=2358&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=478a56b2d64a8f5278121224d85d13646b93ade2)\n\nNow i ain't no fucking artist and i may have a learning disability but I know a cup when i see one and if you look at this chart, even in ur peripheries you'll notice a small cup and handle that's formed in between the support lines, you'll also notice the middle support line recently did an r/S flip i.e. went from being a resistance line to support line.\n\nNow with the small cup in place it may be high time for Coinbase to continue this trend up and fill up the bigger cup by flying back to the 420-450 range. Also the velocity at which alt currencies move if there is a decent rally in the next few weeks, there's potential this sees an even bigger push to go back up where it came from. The MACD looks bullish with potentially indicating this reversal will become a rally. \n\n However, the fundamentals are also insanely undervalued right now. I'm talking this thing has a mufuckin current PE ratio of 28 only considering the first 2 quarters this year i.e. NOT COUNTING any estimates from q3 and q4 this year. I'm talking they made rev of about a billion dollars in FY2020 with about 350 mill in net income, Q1 2021 they made over 1.6 billion in revenue and more than doubled net income relative to the ENTIRE PREVIOUS YEAR.  Q2 2021 they made revenue of 2.23 billion netting 1.6 fucking billion in a damn quarter. They're literally reaching exponential growth as we speak and lets be honest the industry they're in is primed to grow substantially in the foreseeable future. Now if you look at their guidance for q3 and q4 they are not expecting to beat the net income of q2 but they also expect continued profitability and could potentially beat forecasts IF certain coins that are traded on their platform rally hard. For comparison, Square is trading at a FORWARD PE (2024) of 73, PayPal FORWARD PE 2024 of 32, I could go on and on. So really their current annual PE is considerably less than 28 once earnings come in for q3 and q4.\n\nThis is a cash cow of a company fundamentals and technicals seem to be aligning nicely. I think you can't go wrong with far out leaps however you must know that I am retarded and you would be an even bigger retard if you listened to me, jk you prolly can't even read so I'm not worried.\n\nTL:DR COIN to the moon fam!!!",
