        "selftext": "Alright fucktards listen up. This contains almost 0 fundamental analysis and is based purely on speculation and my gut feeling. This past week, IPOB, one of Chamath Palijizzapia's 5,000 SPACs, completed its merger with Opendoor. CEO Eric Wu-tang is ringing the NASDAQ bell tomorrow, and Opendoor Technologies will officially trade under the ticker OPEN. I feel like this may be the biggest &amp; best SPAC deal to date, and the stock will go absolutely stratospheric. Here's why:\n\nOpendoor is actually a real fucking company already doing billions in revenue. Are they profitable? No, but they have a path to profitability and also no one gives a shit these days. They are a tech-centric real estate disrupter startup unicorn. Tech + disrupter \\* startup = moon. I worked at this company for a bit, and they are run by some of the smartest fuckers I have ever met. Their machine-learning algo is prime and continues improving every day. Soon it will replace all humans on earth.\n\nI know, the naysayers are gonna pipe up about \"margins\" and \"unproven business model\". I don't give a shit. It doesn't matter. Opendoor's arch-rival Zillow (Z) is trading at a 5.45 EV-Sales, while Opendoor is somewhere around 2.5 EV-Sales. OPEN also did 4.4x more sales than Z in 2019. Z is playing catchup and does not yet have the infrastructure nor technology to compete with OPEN. You might bring up RDFN. Don't give a fuck, they're irrelevant.\n\nWith the flight from cities only just beginning, near 0 interest rates for the foreseeable future, and the economy opening back up post-vaccine, this all plays swimmingly into OPEN's hands. They will crush all opposition and eventually be the first thing you think of when someone mentions residential real estate.\n\nTL;DR: Stimulus check on OPEN 02/19/21 40c.",

        "selftext": "disclaimer: Please do your own research before you invest. I've made a [post prior on ALUS](https://www.reddit.com/r/SPACs/comments/kizy8w/alus_near_nav_spac_could_have_the_next_ev_target/) and their connection to green energy but since then I've found more insights which I'll discuss in this post.\n\n**What is ALUS?**\n\nALUS (Alussa Energy Acquisition Corp) is a $250M SPAC led by an experienced management team in the energy sector. The team of executives come from international backgrounds and have prior experience taking companies public. Their outdated website states that they are looking to target oil and gas but here is why I think they will be going **green energy** and why **Hyzon Motors** is a possible target. I will specifically discuss the management team below and their connections to Hyzon. The current stock price is $10.21 and warrants $1.35.\n\n**What is Hyzon Motors?**\n\nHYZON Motors is a US-headquartered global supplier of zero-emissions **hydrogen fuel cell powered commercial and heavy vehicles.** Hyzon currently has 400 trucks on the road today using their fuel cell technology, with projections for 100,000 trucks on the road by 2030. Canoo (EVGO) for example has no vehicles on the road currently and their first cars are due in 2021. Hyzon continues to win contracts globally in Australia, Europe, and the Americas. They recently signed a contract with Hiringa Energy in New Zealand for 1,500 vehicles which will start to roll out in 2021. With their rapidly expanding fleet, they are considering an IPO through SPACs and \"have been approached by quite a few\" to gain greater access to capital.\n\n[Hyzon Motors](https://preview.redd.it/jxl90ongqt761.jpg?width=2473&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9d40f8037440fe67dbfc43c4c8dc682171612e3b)\n\n**What is the link between ALUS and Hyzon Motors?**\n\n**Management Team of ALUS**\n\n*Daniel Barcelo* is the CEO and president of ALUS and has a quite active Linkedin history. I have noticed that in the past half year, all of his interactions have been with green energy related posts and out of all his interactions, there is only one with a private company which happens to be Hyzon Motors. Interestingly enough, he is not the only executive on ALUS's team with a connection to Hyzon. \n\n[Daniel Barcelo connection to Hyzon](https://preview.redd.it/ohfvrgjkqt761.jpg?width=1610&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=84f2f911b8bb6752dd45079f2731ebd5f5f3827d)\n\n*John Wu* is a director and active member on ALUS's board and happens to also also have linkedin interactions with Hyzon Motors. Aside from interactions with his own company, Hyzon was the only interaction that caught my eye. \n\n[John Wu Connection to Hyzon](https://preview.redd.it/q2y3tkemqt761.jpg?width=1528&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=38b46b3feb907641575e22a9104ff8bfb6f2c721)\n\n*Chi Chow* is a new member on the ALUS team who joined in April 2020 and is the Strategies and Investment Relations advisor. In his very limited number of interests on Linkedin, I found that aside from the companies that he worked at, he happens to like 3 EV Battery companies from Europe: Northvolt, FREYR, and Morrow's batteries. While there was no direct connection to Hyzon, his involvement in the EV sector is a good sign for ALUS's target. \n\n[Chi Chow connection to EV batteries](https://preview.redd.it/hx7mpwynqt761.jpg?width=994&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=322c4b08fc47aee70644c0b55b7c7e04b3844c5e)\n\n*Christopher Considine* is a new member of the ALUS team who joined as a science advisor. His knowledge and expertise lies in quantum technologies and engineering. I believe his addition to the team shows the team's pivot towards alternate energy as opposed to traditional energy.\n\nThe management team of ALUS consists of a diverse group of seasoned professionals in the energy sector. With executives from Russia, Europe and Asia, it's very likely ALUS will bring an exciting international target. For those who still doubt that ALUS is bringing a traditional oil and gas company, it's been seen over and over again with SHLL, SBE, and SPAQ pivoting their targets towards clean energy as opposed to traditional and I believe the current activity from ALUS shows their green energy focus.\n\n**Why is Linkedin a Credible Source?**\n\nHCAC's target was speculated to be Canoo on reddit long before actual announcement of target from Linkedin connections. It happened that the CEO of HCAC had a small list of interests on linkedin and Canoo was the only EV related one out of them. If you were here on this subreddit in June, you'd remember this.\n\n[How HCAC was speculated to be Canoo ](https://preview.redd.it/ykhbaf7vrt761.jpg?width=1096&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=54fa98cd2ec71b67c02aa6d991c538828e87f8f6)",

        "selftext": "ALUS (Alussa Energy Acquisition Corp.) is a $250 Million SPAC led by highly experienced energy executives James Musselman and Daniel Barcelo who are targeting companies in the energy sector. Similar to $FSR (Fisker) and $SBE (Chargepoint) who had a full team of experienced energy executives but decided to go into EV, here is why I think $ALUS will very soon announce an EV target. \n\n**1. CEO and executives have engaged in EV and green energy posts**\n\nEssentially all of Daniel Barcelo's (CEO and President of Alussa) linkedin engagement has been with EV and green energy posts over the past 6 months. Here, he has engagement with Hyzon Motors which could potentially be a target - they are a **hydrogen Fuel Cell EV** company which is rapidly expanding and projects to have 100,000 trucks on the road by 2030.\n\n[ALUS on radar for EV targets](https://preview.redd.it/7keex4rlez661.jpg?width=1610&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f0367a0b113b13e20e8c3545952c1a2210aad310)\n\nExecutive John Wu is a director on Alussa and he has led the $THBR team through both its SPAC rounds. Recently, $THBR has announced acquisition with Indie Semiconductor, which is a LIDAR play. His seasoned experience makes me more bullish on Alussa also finding a LIDAR/EV/Green Energy target which will gain lots of public attention.\n\n**2. This is an older SPAC who has been looking for targets since February 2020**\n\nALUS has been looking for targets since February 10, 2020 as they have contracted service and consulting services to assist with advisory and evaluations of acquisition opportunities. They have been consisting incurring these expenses of around $300-400k per quarter since February.  This is a SPAC from June 2019 which is much older dated and more likely to announce than some of these newly made SPACs in which we don't even know if they've started looking for their acquisition targets.\n\n[Evidence of search for target since February 2020](https://preview.redd.it/so0en9jahz661.jpg?width=2681&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d717958557e8115441bd8f48d37f6a9c3dbe7352)\n\n**So Why Is This a Good Deal?**\n\n**Warrants are trading at $1.1 and Commons at $10.13**\n\nThis is a SPAC that is near NAV so both commons and warrants are low risk. Warrants are currently trading at $1.1. If you've seen most EV targets have risen significantly recently and the warrants are trading at $3+. **This is an over 250% gains opportunity**. Commons are at $10.13 and since they are redistributed to you at $10 if no target is found the most you could lose is 1.3%. \n\n*Potential Doubts*\n\nALUS made their website in 2019 and have not updated it since then, so it still says they plan to \"build, an oil and gas exploration and production E&amp;P or midstream business\". This is like SPAQ and SBE who took Fisker and Chargepoint which also had websites with outdated energy and gas information as targets. There has been basically no SPAC mergers made on traditional energy from energy executive teams this year and I believe ALUS also knows that green energy is the way to go.\n\nDisclaimer - I am sharing my research and analysis with you guys and I would not buy this above $1.4 on warrants. I have previously made a post on $SFTW a few days ago when price was at $1.3 for warrants and it has since gone up to $1.7 which is a 30% increase. I have held my 15k position in SFTW since that post and I currently have a 15k position in ALUS.\n\n[Positions](https://preview.redd.it/wje731opqz661.png?width=1811&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4fc61487c1fad3d126cc31e823c1d05a19784830)",
