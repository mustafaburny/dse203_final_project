        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, October 5, 2021**\n\nVolatility in the stock market continues, with the three major indexes, particularly the Nasdaq (QQQ), reversing hard after suffering one of its worst days all year, with Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT) leading the charge. Market participants continue to closely monitor developments out of Washington and wait for upcoming economic and earnings data to gauge concerns over supply chain disruptions and inflation. Tech stocks once again came under pressure as the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield continues to rise. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) closed 1.04% higher, the Nasdaq closed 1.35% higher and the Dow Jones (DIA) closing 0.92% higher. The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, underperformed, closing just 0.35% higher.\n\nWe\u2019ve seen previous episodes of rising rates, both earlier this year as well as when the Fed first announced intentions to begin tapering quantitative easing in the not too distant future. Each of these episodes caused a hiccup but didn\u2019t derail the broader bull market. According to Edward Jones, yields went from below 1% to 1.75% during the first three months of this year, a period that included pullbacks in the S&amp;P 500 of 3.7% for four days and 4.2% for 12 days. However, during that entire three-month stretch in which rates were rising, the stock market rose more than 7%.  In this current spate, 10-year rates have jumped from 1.30% on September 15 to as high as 1.54% last week, reflecting a renewed concern over inflation pressures and reduced Fed stimulus expectations\n\nStocks are struggling to regain their footing after the September selloff, given that many of the concerns that sparked last month\u2019s drop remain. Congressional lawmakers have yet to come to an agreement on a solution to raise the debt limit to prevent a potential government default sometime mid-October. Failure to do so would be catastrophic for the US economy.  As a reminder, Congress successfully averted a government shutdown last week. The House approved a bill late on Wednesday suspending the debt limit through December 2022. The Senate could vote on it as early as this week Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said, but Republicans are expected to block it again as they have twice before. This is an evolving situation. In my humble opinion, I think the Republicans are playing political games with the debt ceiling and will pass it last minute, similar to the spending bill to avoid the government shutdown.\n\nLooking ahead, the September Jobs Report will be released later this week. Market participants are hoping to see payroll gains accelerate after a shockingly disappointing August report, which shoed just 235,000 new payrolls gains versus more than 700,000 expected. Consensus economists anticipate that 475,000 payrolls returned in September, and that the unemployment rate fell to 5.1% or the lowest since March 2020.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* According to Facebook (FB), yesterday\u2019s nearly six-hour outage was caused by a mistake during a routine maintenance on how internet data routed through its network.

Perhaps, could be attributed to the immense popularity of \u201cSquid Game\u201d, which has become the company\u2019s most popular show in less than a month.

I agree and personally divested all my holdings in Chinese stocks months ago, some at a loss. Just my opinion.\n* National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (NUMSA), South Africa\u2019s largest metalworkers union with over 155,000 members, said it was launching an indefinite strike to press for wage increases. This action could block critical supplies for car manufacturing, threatening to further strain a supply chain already stretched thin.\n* **\\*\\*Please note that current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect closing prices\\*\\***\n* Chipotle (CMG) target raised by Stephens from $1850 to $2000 at Overweight.

        "selftext": "Shares of Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL) dropped 1.28% in after-hours trading on Tuesday due to a Bloomberg report that suggested the tech giant will likely slash its iPhone 13 targets for 2021 by 10 million due to the global semiconductor chip shortage.\n\nDetails: The report stated that Broadcom (Nasdaq: AVGO) and Texas Instruments (Nasdaq: TXN), two iPhone parts suppliers, were struggling to deliver enough components.\n\nBig Picture: Supply chain issues stemming from the pandemic have resulted in a global chip shortage where demand outweighs supply. \n\nAspirational: Apple is still hoping to meet its initial goal of 90 million new iPhones shipped for the holidays, but it remains to be seen if this will happen.\n\nWide Nosedive: Broadcom, Texas Instruments and other suppliers also saw their share prices dip during after-hours trading Tuesday.\n\nNear Future: Also, Apple is hosting an event next week where it is rumored to present new Macs.\n\nFinal Thoughts: Tuesday\u2019s dip could present an opportunity to buy into Apple, which has seen its stock price fall over 5% in the past month.\n\nHope you enjoyed this commentary.
