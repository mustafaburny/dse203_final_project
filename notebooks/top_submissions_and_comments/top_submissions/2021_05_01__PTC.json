        "selftext": "Thing are looking up in SPAC land and there are still hundreds of SPACs' warrants under $1. It seems the appetite for risk is returning and prices have started appreciating rapidly. Fortunately there are still good warrants to be found at good prices.\n\n***DISCLAIMER:*** *I am not a financial advisor. I have 93 different warrants positions (80 still pre-DA) and have spent the past three months building out positions in as many good teams as I can as close to all-time lows, and I have positions in all the 12 of the warrants mentioned in this article. Warrant prices change rapidly, liquidity is still relatively low, and all are at risk of going to zero if the SPAC liquidates. Make sure a warrant-oriented approach matches your risk appetite and you understand the complexities of these instruments before buying.*\n\nThings I look for:\n\n* low splits in units = potential for better valuation/targets and an indicator of a better team\n* team quality\n* previous SPAC experience\n\n# ROCRW\n\n**Last Trade:** $0.9725\n\n**Warrants in Units:** 1/4 \n\n**Previous/Related:** PCT, which has warrants currently trading at $9.31. Another current SPAC, ROCC, DA'd with Reservoir Media and the last trade on the warrants was 1.63 with a high of 2.90. \n\n**Sector:** Business Services, Consumer, Healthcare, Tech, Wellness, Sustainability\n\n**Team:** Byron Roth (Founder, Roth). \n\n# NVSAW\n\n**Last Trade:** $0.91\n\n**Warrants in Units:** 1/3\n\n**Sector:** Aviation, Aerospace, Defense\n\n**Team:** This team is STACKED. If you are looking for a good aerospace SPAC it may well be the best:\n\n* Dennis A. Muilenburg, the former CEO of Boeing, \n* Marion Blakey, the former Administrator of the FAA, former CEO of the Aerospace Industries Association and former CEO of Rolls-Royce NA, \n* Howard Lance, the former CEO of Maxar and Harris, \n* Christopher Lofgren, Chairman of the US Chamber of Commerce and the CEO of Schneider National\n* Gen. Stephen Wilson, ret. 4 Star Air Force General and Vice Chief of Staff of the Air Force\n* Top advisors include Paul Eremenko, fmr CTO at Airbus, Gur Kimchi, Co-Founder of Amazon Prime Air, Dr. John Tracy, VP of Engineering at Boeing, and more...\n\n# LCAH-WT \n\n**Last Trade:** $0.865 \n\n**Warrants in Units:** 1/4\n\n**Sector:** Consumer, Dining, Hospitality, Entertainment, Gaming \n\n**Previous/Related:** GNOG. GNOG warrants were early redeemed and hit a high price of $10.56.\n\n**Team:** Tilman Fertitta (Houston Rockets owner, CEO of Landry's)\n\n**CLAA-WT** \\- Last Trade: $0.90 - 1/5 warrants in units, and one of the cheapest in that split. The team's previous SPAC was OUST, which successfully completed a merger and the warrants are currently at $3.35, with a high price of $4.57.\n\n# GLBLW\n\n**Last Trade:** $0.69\n\n**Warrants in Units:** 1/3\n\n**Sector:** Not specified, but suggest \"proven business models as we do not intend to assume risks of unproven technologies \"\n\n**Team:** Very solid team for this price: Peter Yu (Managing Partner at Cartesian, former CEO of AIG Capital Partners, Former Director National Economic Council), Elias Dias Sese (President of Northern Europe Kraft Heinz, Former CEO of Tim Hortons), Daniel Karp (Former VP of Worldwide Business Development at Pfizer) \n\n# AGGRW\n\n**Last Trade:** $0.78\n\n**Warrants in Units:** 1/3\n\n**Sector:** Tech - Software, HCIT, Fintech, robotics/automation, EdTech  \n\n**Team:** Jay Bhatt (Former CEO, Alfresco Software; Former CEO, Blackboard), John Newton (Founder/CTO, Alfresco Software), Steven Alesio (Former Chairman/CEO, Dun &amp; Bradstreet), Carol Bartz (Former CEO of Yahoo! and Autodesk), Carl Bass (Director and Fmr CEO of Autodesk; Fmr Director, Hewlett-Packard)   \n\n# DHBC-WT \n\n**Last Trade:** $0.73\n\n**Warrants in Units:** 1/3\n\n**Sector:** Financial Services\n\n**Team:** A very solid resumed team for warrants this cheap: Robert Hurst (Former Vice Chairman/ Head of Investment Banking Division, Goldman Sachs), Richard DeMartini (Former President of Asset Management, Bank of America, Former Chairman, Discover Card). \n\n# DTOC-WT \n\n**Last Trade:** $0.78\n\n**Warrants in Units**: 1/4. This is the cheapest 1/4 split warrant on the market as of last trade Friday.\n\n**Sector:** Healthcare Tech \n\n**The team:** Kevin Nazemi (Fmr Co-CEO, Oscar Health),Bradley Fluegel (Former Chief Strategy Officer, Walgreens &amp; Anthem), Jim Moffatt (Former Vice Chairman/Global CEO, Deloitte Consulting). \n\n# PCPC-WT\n\n**Last Trade:** $1.93\n\n**Warrants in Units:** 1/4. Remember when I said this post was about warrants under $1 and DTOC was the cheapest 1/4 split? Well, that was technically true, but PCPC-WT's $1.93 needs an asterisk: This SPAC is at 2.5x the scale of a normal SPAC, with a $25 per share baseline and a $28.75 strike. By that standard, these warrants at $1.93 would be worth .775 if it were a normal $10 base SPAC. \n\n**Team:** Led by Sahnjeev Mehra, founder and managing partner, Peripheras Capital. \n\n**Notable Feature:** It also has an investors-friendly CAPS incentive structure, where the founders get 6% on merger as opposed to the typical 20%, then provides payouts at certain price levels for sticking with the company long term.\n\n# BOAS-WT\n\n**Last Trade:** $0.67\n\n**Warrants in Units:** 1/3. One of the cheapest in that warrant split. \n\n**Focus:** PropTech\n\n**Team:** Scott Seligman, Chairman of The Seligman Group (a real estate development company), David Glazer (CFO, Palantir), Shane Battier (Former NBA player and VP of Analytics and Basketball Development, Miami Heat)\n\n# SGAMW (DA: REDBOX)\n\n**Last Trade:** 0.84\n\n**Valuation:** $693M, with 2021E revenues of $569M (EV 1.2x estimated revenues).\n\n**Why it's a buy:** According to conventional wisdom, Redbox is a dying company. People are moving away from conventional media like disc videogames and DVDs to all streaming. However, I think that conventional wisdom is from the perspective of those of us who have the privilege to afford internet, smart TVs and streaming services. 70% of Redbox's customers are \"late adopters\" - largely the elderly and low income. To these people, a $2 DVD rental for the latest release is a cheaper night of entertainment than most other forms, and Amazon digital movie rentals for the blockbuster new releases not on Prime are often over $6. Additionally, Redbox is pivoting to digital and supposedly more affordable for the same movies than Amazon. \n\n# LIVKW (DA: AGILETHOUGHT)\n\n**Last Trade:** 0.85\n\n**Valuation:** $482M for $184M in 2021E revenue (EV 2.6x estimated revenues)\n\n**Why it's a buy:** This is a boring IT services company that SPAC investors don't care about, heavily based around consultants in Mexico (even though the corporate HQ is in Dallas). This has led to it becoming underrated for a valuation this good, and for a company that has a good reputation in their field. They trade at very favorable multiples compared to other stocks in their field. One doesn't have to be a groundbreaking product for a company to be a good stock.\n\nGood luck!",

No... not Short Interest. Instead, I'm referencing Sam Israel III.\n\nFollow me on this journey into another escapade exploring scumbag criminals, debauchery and discoveries of a bizarre reality through examining financial history.\n\n# Samuel Israel &amp; the Fed's \"Secret\" Market:\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octopus:\\_Sam\\_Israel,\\_the\\_Secret\\_Market,\\_and\\_Wall\\_Street%27s\\_Wildest\\_Con](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octopus:_Sam_Israel,_the_Secret_Market,_and_Wall_Street%27s_Wildest_Con)\n\nExcerpt from Octopus: Samuel Israel, The Secret Market &amp; Wall Street's Wildest Con's Wikipedia page reads:\n\n&gt;\"Octopus focuses on Wall Street trader Samuel Israel III, who attempted to commit hedge fund fraud by taking part in a \"secret market\" reported to have been run by the Federal Reserve. Lawson interviewed Israel for the book, commenting in an interview with CBS News that he was surprised at **\"how much truth there was to Israel's stories\"**.\n\n The book covers Israel's attempt to save his company Bayou as well as his attempt to fake his death.\n\nUnfortunately the CBS link in the above Wikipedia has been removed/scrubbed, so I found it on Wayback Machine:\n\n[https://web.archive.org/web/20120711063138/https://www.cbsnews.com/8301-504367\\_162-57469215-504367/octopus-sam-israel-the-secret-market-and-wall-streets-wildest-con-by-guy-lawson/](https://web.archive.org/web/20120711063138/https://www.cbsnews.com/8301-504367_162-57469215-504367/octopus-sam-israel-the-secret-market-and-wall-streets-wildest-con-by-guy-lawson/)\n\nLet's cross-reference:\n\nLawson (the author):\n\n&gt;\"(I was surprised by) how much truth there was to Israel's stories. The wilder and taller the tales got, the more there was a basis in historical reality. Like the existence of Federal Reserve bonds stolen from the Chinese government by the Japanese during the Invasion of Nanking in the Second World War.\"  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\"when I reported the story I discovered that there actually is a chance the bonds are real. Leading historians and special forces soldiers all said there was more than a little truth to the legend called Yamashita's Gold.\" :\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yamashita%27s\\_gold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yamashita%27s_gold)\n\nAfter the collapse of Israel's fund Bayou Management, Sam Israel faked his death. This is further detailed in the following Independent article linked below.\n\n# The Arrest of Sam Israel and the Fallout that Followed:\n\n[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/get-rich-or-pretend-die-trying-wall-street-trader-who-faked-his-own-suicide-8092737.html](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/get-rich-or-pretend-die-trying-wall-street-trader-who-faked-his-own-suicide-8092737.html)\n\n&gt;\"Apprenticed into a hedge fund run by a legendary trader, Freddy Graber, Israel was taught the black arts of making money on Wall Street. Graber became a father-figure to Israel, as the latter learnt the reality of insider trading, front running, and the secret array of scams to scalp points from every trade.\"\n\nFreddy Graber was one of the first individuals to operate a hedge fund and market maker at the same time. A strategy employed today by Citadel and countless market making funds/banks on Wall Street.\n\nFrederic J. Graber, Alumni of Princeton University and Harvard University passed away in 2007:\n\nLehman Brothers paid notice obituary to their former colleague displayed in New York Times:\n\n[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9800E0D8173AF933A05752C1A9619C8B63&amp;legacy=true&amp;status=nf](https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9800E0D8173AF933A05752C1A9619C8B63&amp;legacy=true&amp;status=nf)\n\n***Further Excepts from Octopus shed light on Frederic J. Graber's business:***\n\n&gt;\"Frederic J. Graber and Company operated on the thirteenth floor of 1 New York Plaza, a fifty-story skyscraper that housed Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley ( &amp; Salomon Brothers), and powerful law firms. Graber's trading room was in a suite of offices with a dozen or so other independent hedge funds.

They also cited his well-known squeamishness and fear of blood tests, and stated they found it incomprehensible that if he were going to commit suicide, he would do so by cutting his wrists a dozen times. A number of law-enforcement officials also argued that his death deserved further scrutiny, and his notes were passed by his family to ABC News and Time Magazine, both of which investigated the case, but no evidence of murder was ever found.\"\n\nFrom the earlier quoting LA Times article: [https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1993-03-21-mn-13734-story.html](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1993-03-21-mn-13734-story.html)\n\nNichols had frequent contact with Casolaro just before the journalist, who was probing a web of conspiracies ranging from the Iran-Contra affair to alleged Justice Department skullduggery, was found with his wrists slashed in a West Virginia motel room.\n\nThe report, titled \u201cThe INSLAW Affair,\u201d said the Justice Department had failed to adequately investigate charges that high-level officials had stolen and misused a private firm\u2019s sophisticated computer software designed to help track criminals.\n\nRegarding the Inslaw Report:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/Epstein/comments/hmfc6k/beyond\\_ghislaine\\_the\\_maxwell\\_octopus/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Epstein/comments/hmfc6k/beyond_ghislaine_the_maxwell_octopus/)\n\nNichols acknowledged to committee investigators that he had spoken to Casolaro often and served as a sounding board for him, but would not provide a sworn statement to the House committee.\n\nThe trial, which enters its second week of testimony Monday, stems from a 1986 incident in which Nichols, armed with a concealed pistol, was taken into custody by Los Angeles police at The Palomino.\n\nNichols said he was with his brother-in-law, James Hopko (when)\n\n&gt;Without warning, Nichols testified, he was flung to the ground and two revolvers were pointed at his head. Nichols, who was carrying a concealed weapons permit from the Santa Clara County Sheriff\u2019s Department, was disarmed, handcuffed and transported to the North Hollywood LAPD station.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Nichols\u2019 suit charges that the loss of the permit led to a withdrawal of a Swiss financing for his firm, Meridian Arms Corp., to manufacture a new machine gun in South Korea.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;To buttress his client\u2019s credibility as a businessman, Nichols\u2019 lawyer introduced in court a flood of paper indicating that he had worked on numerous ventures with prominent individuals. They included Robert A. Maheu, Howard Hughes\u2019 former right-hand man; Michael A. McManus, an aide to President Ronald Reagan; Clint W. Murchison, then the owner of the Dallas Cowboys, and George K. Pender, an executive with a worldwide engineering company.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Nichols testified about discussions he had with a White House aide on the rebuilding of Lebanon while he was affiliated with Meridian\u2019s predecessor firm, Santa Monica-based First Intercontinental Development Corp. That firm supposedly specialized in secret foreign construction projects for the U.S. government.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Appended to Gates\u2019 affidavit was an Oct. 8, 1987, document stating that the FBI was investigating whether Giaquinto, Nichols and others were \u201cbuying and/or selling stocks by the use of manipulative or deceptive practices.\n\nWithout a doubt, Robert Booth Nichols was involved in mob-related investment schemes leveraging relationships he had established through the CIA, Wall Street and arms dealing ventures. Concerning, to say the least.\n\nIn his 2008 deposition, Nichols explains he was a member of the Board of Directors for George K. Pender's FIDCO.\n\nGeorge K. Pender's only business registration with any U.S State Department is as Director of First International Development Corporation (FIDCO) in Santa Monica, California.\n\n[https://www.corporationwiki.com/California/Cambria/first-intercontinental-development-corporation/40237496.aspx](https://www.corporationwiki.com/California/Cambria/first-intercontinental-development-corporation/40237496.aspx)\n\nWell, well, well.... Nichols stated FIDCO: \"specialized in secret foreign construction projects for the U.S. government.\" I wonder how common these \"secret foreign construction\" companies are?\n\nEarlier in the L.A Times article, Nichols explains being with his brother in-law James Hopko before being arrested by L.A.P.D officers.\n\n[https://www.corporationwiki.com/Hawaii/Honolulu/robert-b-nichols-P5886865.aspx](https://www.corporationwiki.com/Hawaii/Honolulu/robert-b-nichols-P5886865.aspx)\n\nThis business registration with the U.S State Department of Honolulu, lists an Ellen M.

Co-ordinating to short 10 year treasury bonds to keep that money printer a going.\n\nThis is the Federal Reserve's \"Secret Market\".\n\nThank you for reading.\n\nTLDR:\n\nSam Israel III and Robert Booth Nichols were involved in an elaborate U.S Treasury bond trading scheme that continues to be employed by the largest banks and funds on Wall Street.\n\nFor Bayou Management (Israel's fund), this scheme involved shadow government organizations and extremely prominent individuals in government, finance, business + organized crime. Further research of the persons and events surrounding this bizarre crime uncovers evidence of CIA arms smuggling and money laundering operations tied to the Iran-Contra Scandal, Wackenhut Corp and private prison profiteering.\n\nIf I was you though, I would read the whole post.\n\nIf you made it this far, you might be interested in further research materials:\n\nBulk references for the wrinkle brains that like to look closer. These resources help to highlight the peculiar circumstances surrounding this saga and the absolutely astounding legitimacy of Robert Booth Nichols' claims.\n\nChannel 3 news coverage focusing on Sam Israel's and Robert Booth Nichols' involvement: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIjxqks9ugo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIjxqks9ugo)\n\nExtensive deep dive coverage by KESQ reporter Nathan Baca (truly astounding research): The beginning of the 35 part Emmy award winning multi-year investigation by Baca: (entire saga of coverage available through Baca's YouTube channel):\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JPZuRVqUM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JPZuRVqUM)\n\nSamuel Israel III v United States of America Full case resources: [https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/4334434/united-states-v-israel-iii/](https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/4334434/united-states-v-israel-iii/)\n\nBackground on Israel's New Orleans family: [https://www.businessinsider.com/the-israel-banking-family-2012-6?op=1](https://www.businessinsider.com/the-israel-banking-family-2012-6?op=1)\n\nThe Wall Street Conspiracy exposes Crime Organizations involvement in Wall Street naked short activities: [https://vimeo.com/39748584](https://vimeo.com/39748584)\n\nSummary resources: [https://www.abebooks.com/9781851689781/Octopus-Secret-Market-Worlds-Wildest-1851689788/plp](https://www.abebooks.com/9781851689781/Octopus-Secret-Market-Worlds-Wildest-1851689788/plp)\n\n[https://web.archive.org/web/20160104053933/http://www.kesq.com/ONLY-ON-3-The-Money-Behind-The-Octopus-Murders/506750](https://web.archive.org/web/20160104053933/http://www.kesq.com/ONLY-ON-3-The-Money-Behind-The-Octopus-Murders/506750)\n\nTin-Foil City: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation\\_Mockingbird](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Mockingbird)\n\nThe Last Circle First free draft, the published book by Cheri Seymour has 10 extra chapters : [https://wikispooks.com/wiki/File:The\\_last\\_circle.pdf](https://wikispooks.com/wiki/File:The_last_circle.pdf)",

        "selftext": "Thing are looking up in SPAC land and there are still hundreds of SPACs' warrants under $1. It seems the appetite for risk is returning and prices have started appreciating rapidly. Fortunately there are still good warrants to be found at good prices.\n\n***DISCLAIMER:*** *I am not a financial advisor. I have 93 different warrants positions (80 still pre-DA) and have spent the past three months building out positions in as many good teams as I can as close to all-time lows, and I have positions in all the 12 of the warrants mentioned in this article. Warrant prices change rapidly, liquidity is still relatively low, and all are at risk of going to zero if the SPAC liquidates. Make sure a warrant-oriented approach matches your risk appetite and you understand the complexities of these instruments before buying.*\n\nThings I look for:\n\n* low splits in units = potential for better valuation/targets and an indicator of a better team\n* team quality\n* previous SPAC experience\n\n# ROCRW\n\n**Last Trade:** $0.9725\n\n**Warrants in Units:** 1/4 \n\n**Previous/Related:** PCT, which has warrants currently trading at $9.31. Another current SPAC, ROCC, DA'd with Reservoir Media and the last trade on the warrants was 1.63 with a high of 2.90. \n\n**Sector:** Business Services, Consumer, Healthcare, Tech, Wellness, Sustainability\n\n**Team:** Byron Roth (Founder, Roth). \n\n# NVSAW\n\n**Last Trade:** $0.91\n\n**Warrants in Units:** 1/3\n\n**Sector:** Aviation, Aerospace, Defense\n\n**Team:** This team is STACKED. If you are looking for a good aerospace SPAC it may well be the best:\n\n* Dennis A. Muilenburg, the former CEO of Boeing, \n* Marion Blakey, the former Administrator of the FAA, former CEO of the Aerospace Industries Association and former CEO of Rolls-Royce NA, \n* Howard Lance, the former CEO of Maxar and Harris, \n* Christopher Lofgren, Chairman of the US Chamber of Commerce and the CEO of Schneider National\n* Gen. Stephen Wilson, ret. 4 Star Air Force General and Vice Chief of Staff of the Air Force\n* Top advisors include Paul Eremenko, fmr CTO at Airbus, Gur Kimchi, Co-Founder of Amazon Prime Air, Dr. John Tracy, VP of Engineering at Boeing, and more...\n\n# LCAH-WT \n\n**Last Trade:** $0.865 \n\n**Warrants in Units:** 1/4\n\n**Sector:** Consumer, Dining, Hospitality, Entertainment, Gaming \n\n**Previous/Related:** GNOG. GNOG warrants were early redeemed and hit a high price of $10.56.\n\n**Team:** Tilman Fertitta (Houston Rockets owner, CEO of Landry's)\n\n**CLAA-WT** \\- Last Trade: $0.90 - 1/5 warrants in units, and one of the cheapest in that split. The team's previous SPAC was OUST, which successfully completed a merger and the warrants are currently at $3.35, with a high price of $4.57.\n\n# GLBLW\n\n**Last Trade:** $0.69\n\n**Warrants in Units:** 1/3\n\n**Sector:** Not specified, but suggest \"proven business models as we do not intend to assume risks of unproven technologies \"\n\n**Team:** Very solid team for this price: Peter Yu (Managing Partner at Cartesian, former CEO of AIG Capital Partners, Former Director National Economic Council), Elias Dias Sese (President of Northern Europe Kraft Heinz, Former CEO of Tim Hortons), Daniel Karp (Former VP of Worldwide Business Development at Pfizer) \n\n# AGGRW\n\n**Last Trade:** $0.78\n\n**Warrants in Units:** 1/3\n\n**Sector:** Tech - Software, HCIT, Fintech, robotics/automation, EdTech  \n\n**Team:** Jay Bhatt (Former CEO, Alfresco Software; Former CEO, Blackboard), John Newton (Founder/CTO, Alfresco Software), Steven Alesio (Former Chairman/CEO, Dun &amp; Bradstreet), Carol Bartz (Former CEO of Yahoo! and Autodesk), Carl Bass (Director and Fmr CEO of Autodesk; Fmr Director, Hewlett-Packard)   \n\n# DHBC-WT \n\n**Last Trade:** $0.73\n\n**Warrants in Units:** 1/3\n\n**Sector:** Financial Services\n\n**Team:** A very solid resumed team for warrants this cheap: Robert Hurst (Former Vice Chairman/ Head of Investment Banking Division, Goldman Sachs), Richard DeMartini (Former President of Asset Management, Bank of America, Former Chairman, Discover Card). \n\n# DTOC-WT \n\n**Last Trade:** $0.78\n\n**Warrants in Units**: 1/4. This is the cheapest 1/4 split warrant on the market as of last trade Friday.\n\n**Sector:** Healthcare Tech \n\n**The team:** Kevin Nazemi (Fmr Co-CEO, Oscar Health),Bradley Fluegel (Former Chief Strategy Officer, Walgreens &amp; Anthem), Jim Moffatt (Former Vice Chairman/Global CEO, Deloitte Consulting). \n\n# PCPC-WT\n\n**Last Trade:** $1.93\n\n**Warrants in Units:** 1/4. Remember when I said this post was about warrants under $1 and DTOC was the cheapest 1/4 split? Well, that was technically true, but PCPC-WT's $1.93 needs an asterisk: This SPAC is at 2.5x the scale of a normal SPAC, with a $25 per share baseline and a $28.75 strike. By that standard, these warrants at $1.93 would be worth .775 if it were a normal $10 base SPAC. \n\n**Team:** Led by Sahnjeev Mehra, founder and managing partner, Peripheras Capital. \n\n**Notable Feature:** It also has an investors-friendly CAPS incentive structure, where the founders get 6% on merger as opposed to the typical 20%, then provides payouts at certain price levels for sticking with the company long term.\n\n# BOAS-WT\n\n**Last Trade:** $0.67\n\n**Warrants in Units:** 1/3. One of the cheapest in that warrant split. \n\n**Focus:** PropTech\n\n**Team:** Scott Seligman, Chairman of The Seligman Group (a real estate development company), David Glazer (CFO, Palantir), Shane Battier (Former NBA player and VP of Analytics and Basketball Development, Miami Heat)\n\n# SGAMW (DA: REDBOX)\n\n**Last Trade:** 0.84\n\n**Valuation:** $693M, with 2021E revenues of $569M (EV 1.2x estimated revenues).\n\n**Why it's a buy:** According to conventional wisdom, Redbox is a dying company. People are moving away from conventional media like disc videogames and DVDs to all streaming. However, I think that conventional wisdom is from the perspective of those of us who have the privilege to afford internet, smart TVs and streaming services. 70% of Redbox's customers are \"late adopters\" - largely the elderly and low income. To these people, a $2 DVD rental for the latest release is a cheaper night of entertainment than most other forms, and Amazon digital movie rentals for the blockbuster new releases not on Prime are often over $6. Additionally, Redbox is pivoting to digital and supposedly more affordable for the same movies than Amazon. \n\n# LIVKW (DA: AGILETHOUGHT)\n\n**Last Trade:** 0.85\n\n**Valuation:** $482M for $184M in 2021E revenue (EV 2.6x estimated revenues)\n\n**Why it's a buy:** This is a boring IT services company that SPAC investors don't care about, heavily based around consultants in Mexico (even though the corporate HQ is in Dallas). This has led to it becoming underrated for a valuation this good, and for a company that has a good reputation in their field. They trade at very favorable multiples compared to other stocks in their field. One doesn't have to be a groundbreaking product for a company to be a good stock.\n\nGood luck!",

HP is the founder of Silicon Valley, and its history is much longer and more brilliant than Apple. The following recommended reasons for purchase:\n\n1. HP\u2019s printer business still has a lot of room for development, especially 3d printing technology. Its personal computers, servers, and tablets are all developing well.\n2. HP is the true representative of Silicon Valley, which has influenced generations of Americans and even people all over the world\n3. HP\u2019s current price-to-earnings ratio is 10. Apple\u2019s is close to 30. Even if it\u2019s just comparing hardware, HP is cheaper.\n4. HP\u2019s option prices are now very cheap.

Nichols, who was carrying a concealed weapons permit from the Santa Clara County Sheriff\u2019s Department, was disarmed, handcuffed and transported to the North Hollywood LAPD station.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Nichols\u2019 suit charges that the loss of the permit led to a withdrawal of a Swiss financing for his firm, Meridian Arms Corp., to manufacture a new machine gun in South Korea.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;To buttress his client\u2019s credibility as a businessman, Nichols\u2019 lawyer introduced in court a flood of paper indicating that he had worked on numerous ventures with prominent individuals. They included Robert A. Maheu, Howard Hughes\u2019 former right-hand man; Michael A. McManus, an aide to President Ronald Reagan; Clint W. Murchison, then the owner of the Dallas Cowboys, and George K. Pender, an executive with a worldwide engineering company.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Nichols testified about discussions he had with a White House aide on the rebuilding of Lebanon while he was affiliated with Meridian\u2019s predecessor firm, Santa Monica-based First Intercontinental Development Corp. That firm supposedly specialized in secret foreign construction projects for the U.S. government.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Appended to Gates\u2019 affidavit was an Oct. 8, 1987, document stating that the FBI was investigating whether Giaquinto, Nichols and others were \u201cbuying and/or selling stocks by the use of manipulative or deceptive practices.\n\nWithout a doubt, Robert Booth Nichols was involved in mob-related investment schemes leveraging relationships he had established through the CIA, Wall Street and arms dealing ventures. Concerning, to say the least.\n\nIn his 2008 deposition, Nichols explains he was a member of the Board of Directors for George K. Pender's FIDCO.\n\nGeorge K. Pender's only business registration with any U.S State Department is as Director of First International Development Corporation (FIDCO) in Santa Monica, California.\n\n[https://www.corporationwiki.com/California/Cambria/first-intercontinental-development-corporation/40237496.aspx](https://www.corporationwiki.com/California/Cambria/first-intercontinental-development-corporation/40237496.aspx)\n\nWell, well, well.... Nichols stated FIDCO: \"specialized in secret foreign construction projects for the U.S. government.\" I wonder how common these \"secret foreign construction\" companies are?\n\nEarlier in the L.A Times article, Nichols explains being with his brother in-law James Hopko before being arrested by L.A.P.D officers.\n\n[https://www.corporationwiki.com/Hawaii/Honolulu/robert-b-nichols-P5886865.aspx](https://www.corporationwiki.com/Hawaii/Honolulu/robert-b-nichols-P5886865.aspx)\n\nThis business registration with the U.S State Department of Honolulu, lists an Ellen M. Hopko as secretary. This is Robert B. Nichols wife.\n\nThis report serves to expose certain established practices within high stakes and confidential societies.\n\nRobert Booth Nichols was investigated in 1987 by the FBI for:\n\n&gt;\"buying and/or selling stocks by the use of manipulative or deceptive practices.\"\n\nThe practice described above is the Modus Operandi of Ken Griffin/Citadel, Steve Cohen/Point72 , D.E Shaw, The Blackstone Group, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, KKR, BITG and the list goes on through Wall Street.\n\nI believe the Bond scam employed by Sam Israel and Robert Booth Nichols is the same scheme that was run by Salomon Brothers and continues to be employed by Citadel, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley (among others). Co-ordinating to short 10 year treasury bonds to keep that money printer a going.\n\nThis is the Federal Reserve's \"Secret Market\".\n\nThank you for reading.\n\nTLDR:\n\nSam Israel III and Robert Booth Nichols were involved in an elaborate U.S Treasury bond trading scheme that continues to be employed by the largest banks and funds on Wall Street.\n\nFor Bayou Management (Israel's fund), this scheme involved shadow government organizations and extremely prominent individuals in government, finance, business + organized crime. Further research of the persons and events surrounding this bizarre crime uncovers evidence of CIA arms smuggling and money laundering operations tied to the Iran-Contra Scandal, Wackenhut Corp and private prison profiteering.\n\nIf I was you though, I would read the whole post.\n\nIf you made it this far, you might be interested in further research materials:\n\nBulk references for the wrinkle brains that like to look closer. These resources help to highlight the peculiar circumstances surrounding this saga and the absolutely astounding legitimacy of Robert Booth Nichols' claims.\n\nChannel 3 news coverage focusing on Sam Israel's and Robert Booth Nichols' involvement: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIjxqks9ugo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIjxqks9ugo)\n\nExtensive deep dive coverage by KESQ reporter Nathan Baca (truly astounding research): The beginning of the 35 part Emmy award winning multi-year investigation by Baca: (entire saga of coverage available through Baca's YouTube channel):\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JPZuRVqUM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1JPZuRVqUM)\n\nSamuel Israel III v United States of America Full case resources: [https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/4334434/united-states-v-israel-iii/](https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/4334434/united-states-v-israel-iii/)\n\nBackground on Israel's New Orleans family: [https://www.businessinsider.com/the-israel-banking-family-2012-6?op=1](https://www.businessinsider.com/the-israel-banking-family-2012-6?op=1)\n\nThe Wall Street Conspiracy exposes Crime Organizations involvement in Wall Street naked short activities: [https://vimeo.com/39748584](https://vimeo.com/39748584)\n\nSummary resources: [https://www.abebooks.com/9781851689781/Octopus-Secret-Market-Worlds-Wildest-1851689788/plp](https://www.abebooks.com/9781851689781/Octopus-Secret-Market-Worlds-Wildest-1851689788/plp)\n\n[https://web.archive.org/web/20160104053933/http://www.kesq.com/ONLY-ON-3-The-Money-Behind-The-Octopus-Murders/506750](https://web.archive.org/web/20160104053933/http://www.kesq.com/ONLY-ON-3-The-Money-Behind-The-Octopus-Murders/506750)\n\nTin-Foil City: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation\\_Mockingbird](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Mockingbird)\n\nThe Last Circle First free draft, the published book by Cheri Seymour has 10 extra chapters : [https://wikispooks.com/wiki/File:The\\_last\\_circle.pdf](https://wikispooks.com/wiki/File:The_last_circle.pdf)",
