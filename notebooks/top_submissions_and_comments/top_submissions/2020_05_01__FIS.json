        "selftext": "Some of you may know the tale of Andrew Caspersen, the \"Wall Street scion\" who stole tens of millions of dollars from friends and family and used that money to bet purely on SPY and QQQ weekly put options back in 2016. Here's an excellent [Vanity Fair article](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/06/andrew-caspersen-fraud) on Caspersen's crime, which also has quite a bit of information on his background. \n\n*As a sidenote, I will say that Caspersen lived a life of marked by tragedy: His young fiance was killed in the 9/11 attacks, and his father committed suicide 8 years later in 2009.*\n\nI'm not going to discuss the fraud much here, because we are degenerate options gamblers, after all. But Caspersen was a Harvard-educated lawyer, and a very smart one, who created fake documents to sell to his friends, family, and network about some fake private equity financing deals that would give them quarterly interest payments amounting to 15% per annum. \n\nThe court documents that are publicly available paint some details that most news articles on the case did not explain fully. Specifically, I would like to point you all to [Exhibit D](https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.458915.29.5.pdf) in Caspersen's case, which includes testimony from a finance expert who was hired to examine Caspersen's trades on Interactive Brokers and Fidelity. \n\nBy late 2015, Caspersen had about $9 million to trade with. In January 2016, he spent all of this money on ATM SPY options expiring in about a week. He would sell his proceeds on Friday and roll them into more put options expiring the following week. This worked extremely well all throughout January and February. By the end of the trading day on February 11th, his account was worth $112 million, more than enough to repay his friends and family and walk away with tens of millions of dollars for himself. But he refused. He kept going \"all-in\" on SPY puts. By the end of the first week of March, he had lost everything, and by this time, one of his old classmates was clamoring for the $25 million he had loaned to Caspersen from a family foundation he worked for. \n\nThe jig was up. \n\nCaspersen was arrested by the FBI in New York on March 28, 2016, in full view of his wife and family. They were all returning from a family vacation in Florida.",

        "selftext": "It is common to see index funds being recommended to the average investor and even some Vanguard and Fidelity are some of the [largest funds.](https://www.marketwatch.com/tools/mutual-fund/top25largest) My question is, why do funds such as VFIAX or FXAIX receive so much praise over other funds such as my favorite FSCSX?\n\nFor example, comparing FXAIX which is Fidelity's S&amp;P 500 index fund, has an annualized return of 9.67% for the life of the fund. Compare that to FSCSX which has a 15.74% annualized return since the inception of the fund in 1985. A nearly 6% difference is enormous when it compounds, especially over 3 to 4 decades. This is just one example, you can find similar differences with other funds that track the S&amp;P 500 or Nasdaq (although Nasdaq funds seem to do better). \n\nI understand expense ratios are one concern, and reasonably so. The expense ratio for FXAIX is 0.015% which is crazy low when compared to some of the 1%+ expense ratio for a lot of funds. Even so though, going back to my example, the 0.71% expense ratio for FSCSX does not close the gap between it and FXAIX. \n\nAlso, my example is not the rule. There are lot more funds that perform worse than the market and charge high fees. But there are options that *DO* perform better even with fees taken into account. Why are these funds not recommended more often?",

        "selftext": "Well, I did buy in, but only with a small investment in a company called Altimmune (ALT). I bought 40 shares at $6.50, and that was me getting in what I considered to be late (opened my trading account when it was at $4.93 and by the time my funds hit the stock was already well into the high $5s). It looks like a good move so far, but anything can happen.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway,  I've been holding... holding... waiting to get my big chunk into the market (not much, \\~$2K). Haven't made big buys yet, but yesterday and today I've put in limit buys for 5 stocks I've been staring at for 2 weeks, and now I've missed a couple different +10% days. Now where I've put my limits is much higher than it would've been last week. It doesn't feel right because I've been holding off waiting for another drop, but it doesn't seem like it's coming now. The Memorial Day rally has caused me to rethink this and now I feel like I may need to get back in before it's WAY too late. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI opened my Fidelity account right smack dab in the middle of the bottom out, but the funds weren't available until days later when the market had already corrected itself. Unfortunately for me, I decided to hold, take notes, and watch the markets every day since, hoping for another dip. The problem is the opposite happened with the Memorial Day rally and now I'm afraid that dip might not happen, and if it does and I buy in now, I'll take unnecessary losses that may have been avoided with some patience and trust in my fundamental knowledge.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI guess my question is this. Do I buy in now? Do I continue to be patient for what could be an inevitable 2nd crash or down spike? Or do you think we are in the clear and I should just buy now and try to forget about what could have been? It just really feels like this rally bubble could burst, even if it happens gradually. At the same time, it may not.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRight now I've got limit buy orders in intentionally too low to hit today, probably. But this is what got me here in the first place. Could really use at least some conversation about it. No one here is going to convince me either way, but it is nice to read others having the same concerns.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor the record, I am a purely fundamental trader. The stocks I've been staring at are ALT, SAVE, LUV, CCL, PENN, and NVAX.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks for any input. I look forward to any replies.",

        "selftext": "Hello all, after recently losing all of my monthly gains to a penny stock, I decided I wanted to play it a little more safe. I have been buying and selling several companies (GUSH, SCVL, etc.) daily and have gotten some okay results, but I want to get more. As of now I have $3000 in Fidelity (right where I started) and have done the math and to buy a share of each DOW company it would cost a hair under $4500. I can definitely put in another 1500 to match that, but I was wondering; would buying 1 share of every company be a good move? What companies in the DOW and stars and which ones are slugs? I was interested in the dividends and I figured if I do it this way I will make money as the DOW makes money. This was a really different (I think) concept that I have been thinking about for a couple days, and I just wanted to know your guys opinion on it. Thanks!",

Both are 0. I called and spoke to a Fidelity trading rep and I asked what that message means. She said, \"I don't know.\"  She basically said to keep checking it every day until it is trading. Doesn't make any sense. \n\nCan anyone explain what this is and why they won't let me buy it? DTTC reinstated the stock last week, obviously.

I said, \"No, I'm trying to BUY MORE\" and they were clueless.\n\nI'm reading that other people on Schwab, Vanguard, etc., are trading this stock. Why would Fidelity block it?

        "selftext": "I am posting this for a group of us at work, so your input is important.  \n\n**Background:**   Our 401K's provided by our company, and managed by Fidelity, do not allow us to purchase any individual stocks (exception is our own company stock)... only funds and ETFs.   Most of my friends at work were hit hard by the downturn, and lost approximately 35% of their value.   I am a pretty active options trader outside of work, and have a number of research subscriptions and tools at my disposal, so I exited my S&amp;P heavy 401K postitions almost concurrent to the decline in February.   I carried cash all the way to the bottom, repurchased near/at the bottom, and rode it back until last week.  My 158K portfolio pre-crash is up approximately 40K.   As of last week, I was 100% back in Money Market funds, because I  believe the S&amp;P and Nasdaq is just being propped up too much by 20% of the companies listed.   Individual PE ratios are three digits on most, and nobody wants to admit the emperor has no clothes.  I intend to wait with cash until June, July, or even August if I have to before buying. (Please don't hate on me for \"market timing\" my 401K, but I'm 8 years from retirement)  One of the my co-workers is frozen right now in fear of losing his hard earned gains, and looking at different, more focused ETFs and Funds instead of pushing into money market funds or bonds.    This is a focused and well educated investor, and the fear on his face is palpable. \n\n**This brings us to today.**   My Co-workers are today (almost) back in the green,  having made adjustments to their portfolio, and asked me what I would do to protect the impending crash.

        "selftext": "I am new to trading so please bear with me.   I have quickly come to realize how important it is to set stop losses.  I signed up with Fidelity bc I heard that they have a pretty good selection of stop loss options.  I bought a few shares of VUZI today to play around with the stop loss options.  I chose to do a   trailing stop loss by percentage.   I bought in at  2.1656.  I set a trailing stop loss at 4% based on bid for half the shares and it sold almost immediately at 2.3006.  I wasn't sure why it sold almost immediately so i tried again for the remainder at 7% and it sold shortly thereafter (at 2.3315 - again seemed premature).   Missed the ride to the top.   if you look at the ride from 10-11 am today (2.15-2.38), there were barely any dips.  Certainly not a 7% dip.  It would have had to dip from 2.5-2.38 for a 7% change.   What am I doing wrong?   Am I misunderstanding this?\n\nAlso, I see that I was charged .1 fees for these small share test runs.  Not a big deal, but I thought Fidelity was no fee and no commission.  I'm trying to learn how to do all of this and don't want to put any significant money into play right now.  E-trade wouldn't allow me to do stop-loss trail on penny stocks.  I tried webull and had an issue there as well.   Why is Fidelity charging fees?",

My perspective was that it's just been doing so well why bother going into international to get a worse return? In any event, I really should and plan to diversify. Wanted to get thoughts on some good potential funds out there, maybe some small cap and international is way to go? nasdaq index? and may be a smidge, 5-10% in bonds. I'm an aggressive investor knowing that in the long run it pays to be in stocks.

        "selftext": "Investing vs Saving\n\nHello friends. So ever since this pandemic hit, I\u2019ve been floating around the idea of financial freedom, so I\u2019ve been researching a lot deeper into the stock market and investing. Since March, I\u2019ve learned an exponential amount thanks to YouTube. I just opened up my first fidelity investment account and have invested into one mutual fund. I am planning on opening up a Roth IRA as well as investing in more index funds. \nAlthough investing is one of the best ways to use your money, I\u2019ve also been flirting with researching into real estate. According to many wealthy people, real estate has the most potential to become very wealthy much faster than investing a few decades into the stock market. Ideally, I would like to buy a duplex or triplex, and reside in one so I can have it all paid off while I work. The thing is, in order to do this I need to have money saved to put down at least 20%. \nSo my question is, should I continue to invest tiny amounts into the stock market every month while saving to buy my first property, or should I invest larger amounts and ave up slowly? I make a little less than the average American income. For those who are experienced in both fields, what would you advise? \nThank you",

It shows up on their website every day with a price that is going up and down based on the trading from other platforms that are trading it (Schwab, TD Ameritrade, etc.), but Fidelity has a 0 Ask and 0 Bid price every single day for the stock. I've been told by one of their reps that they aren't trading the stock.\n\nThe stock went from Pink Sheets to grey and likely will go back to Pink Sheets in the future, but probably not within a reasonable time frame. That happened because of the SEC taking a peek at the stock, suspending it and then basically \"timing out\" in their response and not even issuing a reason as to why they suspended it. Nothing wrong was found and it has been restored on some platforms, just not on Fidelity.\n\nOther people on various forums who trade the same stock are saying that I should open a TD Ameritrade account. What kind of taxes do I have to pay for something like that? Say that I transfer money into it, buy into a stock and it makes me like $100K that I want to sell. What happens with that? Am I taxing it like regular income, under some kind of odd trade income or what? I want to make sure that my tax stuff is in order before doing any trading like that.

I also saw a cpl articles that said, \u201cLYFT stock goes up after they beat estimates.\u201d  I googled \u201cLYFT stock earnings\u201d. It shows -.63 expected eps and reported -.32%. Made sense except my Fidelity page shows -1.31 eps, and therefore did not meet estimates. What am I missing? Can upload screenshots if needed.",

        "selftext": "90% of my investing money is allocated between various mutual funds in a Fidelity brokerage account. So far I\u2019m up about 16% on the year with those so I can\u2019t complain. I also have a separate brokerage account where I have (had) 26 individual stocks. This is just 10% of my money but I\u2019ve been debating what I should do with this account. \n\nI used to have Google, Microsoft, NVIDIA, Amazon, (and other big players in major sectors) but many of these companies are heavily weighted in my mutual funds so I figured I could sell them. I have about 40 stocks I\u2019ve researched heavily that I really like but I\u2019m having trouble narrowing them down.\n\nDoes anyone have any suggestions for what I should do? I keep track of my account consistently but I\u2019m definitely not a day trader. \n\nShould I just forget the individual stocks and use that money for my mutual funds?\n\nShould I just grab like a few... maybe like 5 stocks that I think have a lot of potential and allocate the money between? I\u2019m okay with going aggressive with my individual stocks since the vast majority of my money is in mutual funds anyways.\n\nI\u2019m newish to this and trying to figure out the smartest way to go about this so any advice is greatly appreciated!",
