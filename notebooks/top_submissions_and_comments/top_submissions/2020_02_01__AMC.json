        "selftext": "Stock: **AMARIN (AMRN)**\n\nDirection: **Bullish**\n\n**Price Target:** **20$, 22$**\n\n**Type: Put Credit Spread**\n\n**Fundamental:** Amarin is currently off a slow decline due several weaknesses, most prominent being its patent lawsuit against 2 other companies. This can hurt their profitability and market share, as AMRN currently dominates the heart disease medicine area with Vascepa. In addition, AMRN is looking to report a 80%+ YoY revenue growth on the back of Vascepa, while maintaining a decent EPS. There also has been rumors of M&amp;A, though I doubt it\u2019ll factor into this earning.\n\n**Technical**: Priced below in 20, 50, 200D average, while being bullish in nature.  MACD shows neutral convergence. RSI shows around 40, going towards oversold. Options sentiments are very bullish in volume and very bullish open interest. Implied move is 10.8% or about $2. Short interest is surprisingly high at 11.5%, or about 30% float. The SI ratio is about 7. \n\n**Sentimental**: After its approval and label expansion for their blockbuster drug Vascepa, Amarin has faced several issues that prevented it from realizing gains. These issues include patent challenges, lawsuits, and general investor uncertainty. Last quarter, AMRN knocked it out of the park, and faced a subsequent sell off that is stabilizing just now. With huge YoY improvement in earnings performance, I believe Amarin will come up on top, even in spite of coronavirus fears. The main bear case is that of profit collecting, which may trigger if the outstanding issues I\u2019ve listed are not properly addressed. \n\n**ROI% - 54%, 102%**\n\n**Risk Level - 3 out of 5, 5 out of 5.**\n\n2 plays 2 different level of risk/reward. Both are bullish. \n\n[Robinhood SS](https://imgur.com/a/Q0qAerS)\n\nAmarin is fickle. It can beat really hard and still sell off. This time might be different, but I'd suggest closing for profit earlier than later if we win.",

However, DBX does sport one of the lowest PE ratios within the sector, leading to some value buyers eyeing the stock. DBX is somewhere in the muddy waters between Growth and Fundamental, and this can lead to some outsized price action.\n\n**Technical**: Priced above in 20, 50 day moving averages, below 200 day MA.  MACD shows neutral convergence. RSI shows around 55, slightly above neutral. Options sentiments are bearish in volume and neutral open interest. Implied movement of about 12.3% or 2.27$.\n\n**Sentimental**: Dropbox recently released its new product end of last quarter. This new product aims to smooth over some of Dropbox\u2019s lagging technology and services. While a revenue re-acceleration was started last quarter, the increased cost on marketing, sales, and transition may affect earnings perception. Dropbox has a history of beating earnings; it also has a history of sliding after earnings. **This one is quite risky, and a bullish call is considered contrarian**. \n\n**ROI: 28%, 300%**\n\n**Risk Level: 5 out of 5, 50/50**  \n**I suggest the put credit spread.

SQ also lowballed EPS and Revenue guidance last quarter, making this quarter much easier to beat. However, with the global slowdown due to coronavirus, forward guidance will become very important. Square cannot sandbag guidance this quarter as any weakness shown will be exposed. \n\n**Technical**: Priced above 50 and 200 day moving averages, below 20D average. MACD shows bullish convergence.

        "selftext": "Ok here is some DD on a stock i\u2019ve been watching for a while. AMA about this sick DD on $AMC.\n\n$AMC is primed for a $SPCE style explosion \ud83d\ude80 :\n\nThe float is more than 50% short going into earnings this coming Thursday. Expectations are low as fuck because there is this narrative that no one goes to the movies anymore due to streaming. That\u2019s false. A-list has over 900,000 subscribers and Stubs over 20 million households. The box office is a $10+ billion dollar industry per year, and the studios have a vested interest in keeping AMC in good shape. (There has been talk about Adam Aron making some more favorable ticket deals with DIS. See business insider article for that DD.)\n\nAnyway, the current book value of AMC is over $13 while the stock is at $7.50. How? Because of their debt and capex. But their capex will be way down now that all of their theaters have been redone. The debt is also getting paid off as we speak and is way better than it looks.  Why you may ask?? \n\nBecause new accounting rules mean future lease obligations must be taken into account in the debt load. This is unfair to companies with many lease obligations like $AMC because it makes future lease obligations look like more debt. If you have 2 mos. left on your lease at $1k per month, would you say you\u2019re $2k in debt? No thats retarded.\n\nExpansion abroad is also ignored...U.S box office hasnt been as explosive this and last year, but Saudi Arabia \ud83d\udc2a is a massive emerging market that AMC is breaking into. Also, keep in mind that the box office is cyclical. End of 2019 and 2020 will be the biggest box office of all time.\n\n\nhttps://www.latimes.com/business/hollywood/la-fi-ct-amc-saudi-arabia-20180404-story.html\n\nThis stock is so slept on the short silly \ud83d\udc3b s are going to have to pay its ridiculous dividend, leading to a squeeze.\n\nTL;DR: AMC calls dont sleep on this",

        "selftext": "Stock: **Virgin Galactic (SPCE)**\n\nDirection: **Mixed Bullish**\n\n**Price Target:** **40$**\n\n**Type: Call Credit Spread, Put Credit Spread**\n\n**Fundamental:** lol\n\n**Technical**: Priced above in 20, 50 day moving averages, no 200D average yet.  MACD shows bullish convergence. RSI shows around 72, coming down from massively overbought. Options sentiments are bullish in volume and bullish open interest. **Implied movement of about 23% or 8.05$. Short interest rate is 19%, about 1.15 days to cover, and about 37% of total available float is shorted.** SPCE is currently considered \u201chard to borrow\u201d, putting pressure and fees on short sellers. **19% institutional ownership = much more sentiment and retail driven.**\n\n**Sentimental**: There are several key factors at play for SPCE\u2019s earnings this quarter. The first factor is the updated timetable regarding commercial flights. Previously, SPCE stated that first commercial flights will begin Q1/Q2 2020. **If the flight timetable is reinforced or even confirmed, it can be a very strong catalyst to keep the stock up.** Second factor at play is the revenue accrued from reservation deposits. **In September 2019, SPCE annouced they have 600 tickets sold, amounting to about 80M in revenue. As of 2/24/2020, SPCE\u2019s website noted that all tickets have been sold out.** While a 750k revenue on 7.3B market cap seems dumb, the accrued revenue from reservations would be the biggest factor in the operational performance area. The last factor at play is the **potential for SPCE to announce an equity raise given the stock\u2019s current high price.** **Depending on the price and shares released, it can materially affect the stock\u2019s price downwards**. A 4th issue was concluded merely yesterday, as **SPCE finally registered its warrants.** This prevents a cashless exercise scenario, which would hurt the stock price due to a brief, but massive influx of shares. While total dilution would be smaller by 12 million or about 60%, a cashless exercise will wreck the short-term float. 31 million shares over the course of 5 years is much more manageable. One last factor is the current macro psychology**. Because we are near the tail end of the longest bull run in American history, traders are looking for even more aggressive trades to pull even higher returns.**\n\nThe question for this earnings is entirely a retail fueled sentiment show. If SPCE can keep up the retail hype through news and announcements, it can lead retail to stay stubborn with price action. In addition, since most of the price is driven by retail purchases, price action will reflect much more of the sentiments, rather than anything logical. Chance of a sustained short squeeze is almost nothing due to 1.15 SI Ratio.\n\n**ROI : 31%, 98%**\n\n**Risk Level - 5 of 5, Educated Gambling.** \n\n[Robinhood SS](https://imgur.com/a/EKJX7Tq)\n\nYou can't ~~reason~~ with SPCE.

Etsy is a niche market with a strong brand. This makes them a very attractive target for acquisition. Etsy has also been consistently profitable, though there were some margin and revenue contractions in the past. Q4 typically has always been good to Etsy. \n\n**Technical**: Priced above 50D MA, below 20 and 200D MA.  MACD shows bullish convergence. RSI shows around 50, coming up from neutral.

        "selftext": " \n\nStock: **Tandem Diabetes (TNDM)**\n\nDirection: **Mixed Bearish**\n\n**Price Target:** **85$**\n\n**Type: Call Credit Spread**\n\n**Fundamental:** TNDM has been on a tear in 2020, with its stock rising more than 30% in 2 month. The main catalyst is their Control-IQ pumps, which have seen some setbacks due to its later release. However, its considered one of the best products in class and have shown potential. This potential is shown in TNDM\u2019s charts and price growth. However, much of the upside has been priced in and given the current macro situation, this trade became much more muddled. Revenue growth is high, but slowing as well.\n\n**Technical**: Priced above in 20, 50, 200 day moving averages.  MACD shows bearish convergence. RSI shows around 70, coming down from massively overbought. Options sentiments are bullish in volume and bearish open interest. Implied movement of about 11.9% or 10$.\n\n**Sentimental**: TNDM is diabetes and insulin pump king. With the current american diet failing and diabetes on the rise, it should prove that TNDM has a lot of momentum going forward. Given the short interest, if the stock trends flat or upwards, we should see some minor short covering, especially with the short (3.5) days to cover. This one is a doozy, as TNDM has history of beating top and bottom line while still losing stock price. The macro conditions may also heavily affect the outcome, so we sell 1 additional week to potentially ride the negative macro conditions.\n\n**ROI: 21%**\n\n**Risk Level: 4 out of 5, Very Risky**\n\n[Robinhood SS](https://imgur.com/a/LlDh9kA)  \n\n\nMarkets are very actively red today. This may affect earnings, especially positive ones.",

        "selftext": "Stock: **AMARIN (AMRN)**\n\nDirection: **Bullish**\n\n**Price Target:** **20$, 22$**\n\n**Type: Put Credit Spread**\n\n**Fundamental:** Amarin is currently off a slow decline due several weaknesses, most prominent being its patent lawsuit against 2 other companies. This can hurt their profitability and market share, as AMRN currently dominates the heart disease medicine area with Vascepa. In addition, AMRN is looking to report a 80%+ YoY revenue growth on the back of Vascepa, while maintaining a decent EPS. There also has been rumors of M&amp;A, though I doubt it\u2019ll factor into this earning.\n\n**Technical**: Priced below in 20, 50, 200D average, while being bullish in nature.  MACD shows neutral convergence. RSI shows around 40, going towards oversold. Options sentiments are very bullish in volume and very bullish open interest. Implied move is 10.8% or about $2. Short interest is surprisingly high at 11.5%, or about 30% float. The SI ratio is about 7. \n\n**Sentimental**: After its approval and label expansion for their blockbuster drug Vascepa, Amarin has faced several issues that prevented it from realizing gains. These issues include patent challenges, lawsuits, and general investor uncertainty. Last quarter, AMRN knocked it out of the park, and faced a subsequent sell off that is stabilizing just now. With huge YoY improvement in earnings performance, I believe Amarin will come up on top, even in spite of coronavirus fears. The main bear case is that of profit collecting, which may trigger if the outstanding issues I\u2019ve listed are not properly addressed. \n\n**ROI% - 54%, 102%**\n\n**Risk Level - 3 out of 5, 5 out of 5.**\n\n2 plays 2 different level of risk/reward. Both are bullish. \n\n[Robinhood SS](https://imgur.com/a/Q0qAerS)\n\nAmarin is fickle. It can beat really hard and still sell off. This time might be different, but I'd suggest closing for profit earlier than later if we win.",

Fundamental ratios such as PE, sales to earnings, cashflow etc are all way out of reasonable ranges. However, we\u2019re also looking at 35% revenue growth year over year, and the industry is extremely bullish due to the shift into cloud and digital. Looking at comparable peers using Price to sales, we can still say ZS is relatively overpriced even amongst its peers. This is primarily a bet on further growth potential of the company, hence the growth categorization.\n\n**Technical**: Priced above in 20, 50, 200 day moving averages.  MACD shows bearish convergence. RSI shows around 68, nearing overbought, but turning downwards. Options sentiments are very bullish in volume and neutral open interest. Implied movement of about 10.1% or 6.31$.\n\n**Sentimental**: Zscaler is the best-in-class for cyber security and has superior product selection and features vs competitors like palo alto networks. It has accrued a decent short interest of about 9% float and 6 days to cover approximately. While ZS has beaten earnings since its IPO, the stock price tends to hang over on guidance due to the growth nature of this stock.
