        "selftext": "**TL:DR is at the bottom**\n\nHello, welcome to my second deep dive write up.\n\nMy name\u2019s Mark and I\u2019m an accountant with a passion for investing. About two years ago, I used to work as an auditor at a public accounting firm and have been behind the scenes at many different publicly traded and privately held companies in the U.S. My goal is to bring my unique perspective from that past experience, my current experience working in a new role at a large corporation, and my understanding of accounting to help break down some of the most exciting growth stocks on the market today.\n\nI\u2019m a long-term investor. I am focused on finding great companies and holding them for a long time. I\u2019m willing to endure volatility, crazy price drops, and everything that comes with this approach as long as the facts that led me to originally invest and believe in that company have not changed. If you want to learn more about this approach. I recommend reading the book \u201c100 Baggers\u201d by Chris Mayer.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nI\u2019m excited to share with you all my stock pick for this month, Smartsheet. I\u2019m always looking for investment ideas. I run stock screeners with different criteria (mostly focused on revenue growth), scan Twitter, talk to professionals in different industries, and try to observe what products or services are getting popular with my friends and family. One of the best investment decisions I\u2019ve made to date came after I talked to my friend about a drink he was drinking on the golf course. Shout out to you Celsius (CELH)! With that being said, you never know where your next good investment idea is going to come from.\n\nIn the case of Smartsheet, I became aware of the company through a stock screener. I was drawn to the relatively small market cap ($8.6B), strong revenue growth (roughly 35%), and the fact that it\u2019s a subscription business model (SaaS). Once I became aware of these facts, it cued me to take a deeper dive. The more I learned about Smartsheet, the more I liked. Management talks a lot about empowering people and that really struck a chord with me. In different roles I\u2019ve had as a teacher, tutor, and supervisor, I\u2019ve always found empowering people to be one of the most important keys to success. I will touch on this more later in the write up.\n\nAnother positive signal I got about Smartsheet came unexpectedly one evening. I was sitting in the kitchen and my girlfriend was cooking dinner. I was watching an interview on my phone with Mark Mader, the CEO of Smartsheet. My girlfriend overheard the word \u201cSmartsheet\u201d mentioned in the video and said \u201cAre they talking about the Smartsheet with the blue check mark?\u201d. I had to Google their logo but yes, it turns out we were thinking about the same Smartsheet. I asked her how she knew about it. She said \u201cMy company just transitioned all of our work onto Smartsheet. I really love it. Our marketing department is really excited about it because it makes their job way easier and more enjoyable.\u201d Hearing this just motivated me to learn more about Smartsheet.\n\n**The Thesis Statement**\n\nFor every stock pick I make, I want to provide a quick thesis statement that can serve as a reminder for why I\u2019m buying and holding that stock for the long term. I\u2019ll always aim to make it just a few sentences long so it can easily be remembered and internalized. This helps during times when the price may sporadically drop and you need to remember why you\u2019re holding this position.\n\nThe thesis statement I have come up with for Smartsheet is as follows:\n\n*\u201cSmartsheet: A leader in collaborative work management (CWM) software. As the global workforce becomes more decentralized through remote work, managers and executives now more than ever need a tool to digitally consolidate their teams, projects and deadlines. Smartsheet is that tool and is innovating to offer businesses even more ways to get the most out of their teams.\u201d*\n\nI think this thesis statement really captures the essence of what Smartsheet does. If you go to Smartsheet\u2019s website and look at the \u201cAbout\u201d page, you will find their \u201cAbout\u201d statement which says \u201cSmartsheet is the enterprise platform for dynamic work that aligns people and technology so your entire business can move faster, drive innovation, and achieve more.\u201d Notice how their statement emphasizes helping businesses move faster, drive innovation, and achieve more.\n\nIn my thesis statement, I mention that Smartsheet is a leader in the CWM software space. But how do I know this? Well, a highly reputable independent research firm named Forrester conducted a study on the CWM space based off different criteria including collaboration, enterprise capabilities, UI/user experience, planned enhancements and number of customers just to name a few of the factors considered. I put the companies that were identified from the study in the order of their ranking below. As you can see, Smartsheet is firmly planted as a leader in the space at 2nd place. Let\u2019s use our common sense for a second. At the beginning stages of a remote work revolution, do we want to invest in an up and coming SaaS company that focuses on providing firms with resources to digitally manage their teams, digitally manage work/projects, and digitally collaborate to get work done? I think the answer should be a resounding yes. But what about these other companies on the list. Let\u2019s break them down 1 by 1:\n\n* Workfront was recently bought by Adobe. If you want to invest in Workfront, you\u2019d have to invest in the much larger company of Adobe. It wouldn\u2019t be a pure play investment into the CWM space.\n* Smartsheet is 2nd and of course, they are public :)\n* Wrike is private\n* ServiceNow \u2013 CWM is just one small piece of their total      offerings. Investing here would not be a pure play into the CWM space.  Also, the company is already quite large ($106B market cap)\n* Asana is public but just IPO\u2019d on 9/30/20 about 3 months ago. We don\u2019t have much data to track their performance as a      publicly traded company. Furthermore, although they actually would be a pure play investment into the CWM space, they\u2019re not a leader and rank behind Smartsheet in several of Forrester\u2019s categories. Why invest in the 2nd best when you can invest in the best?\n* Monday.com is private\n* Microsoft \u2013 CWM is just one small piece of their total offerings. Investing here would not be a pure play into the CWM space.\n* Atlassian \u2013 This company does primarily focus on CWM but I have a couple problems with them as an investment. 1) They\u2019re ranked way beneath Smartsheet. 2) They\u2019re already too big for me to confidently say they can 10x (market cap already $58B).\n\nNow that we\u2019ve established that Smartsheet is a leader in the CWM space and that they\u2019re arguably the best publicly available pure-play investment in this space let\u2019s understand why this is important. Other than the obvious reason that we\u2019re in the beginning stages of a remote work revolution, why is this important?\n\nWell, let\u2019s take a look at this quote from Mark Mader, Smartsheet CEO, during the last earnings call (Q3 FY21) that occurred on December 7th, 2020:\n\n\u201cLeaders are recognizing they need to shift more workloads to asynchronous work, work that is documented, automated, tracked with dashboards, and where priorities are clearly defined. They understand that by empowering their teams with no-code solutions that facilitate asynchronous work, cycle times will be improved, a deeper sense of ownership will be created, and prioritization and accountability will be insured. Smartsheet is ideally suited to help enterprises work more asynchronously to derive the benefits from doing so.\u201d\n\nKey word here: Asynchronous. Asynchronous communication is different from Synchronous communication. Here is the difference:\n\nAsynchronous: email, message boards, dashboards, etc. \n\nSynchronous: video conferencing, chat, audio calls, etc. \n\nAny communication that doesn\u2019t require a real-time response can be considered asynchronous, like the examples in the picture above. Synchronous communication is any communication that happens in real time, thereby allowing for immediate responses, see examples above. As part of my research on Smartsheet, I read an E-Book that was written by the original co-founders of Smartsheet, Mark Mader the current CEO and Brent Frei who is no longer with the company. They wrote the E-Book in 2007 just a couple of years after the 2005 founding. The E-Book is called \u201cThe Power of Done\u201d. The moral of the book is that Mark and Brent noticed through their own experience, and through different research studies on work place productivity, that the rise in technology in the early 21st century was actually making employees less productive. This is a quote from their E-Book:\n\n\u201cAccording to Basex, a research firm focusing on the knowledge economy, interruptions from email, cell phones, instant messaging, text messaging and blogs eat up nearly 30 percent of each day; on an annualized basis, this represents a loss of 28 billion hours for the entire U.S. workforce, or a $588 billion cost to the American economy.\u201d\n\nThey mention in their book that although there has been a lot of advances in work technology such as email, word processing, and spreadsheets, there hadn\u2019t at that time been any great applications created for teamwork collaboration or task management. The fact that technology advances helped the world create tools to enhance productivity but also deterred productivity at the same time is what Mark and Brent referred to as the productivity paradox. They wanted to do something about it and thus they founded Smartsheet.\n\n**How Smartsheet makes money**\n\nAt the very least, before you invest in a company, you better understand how they make money. In Chris Mayers\u2019 excellent book, 100 Baggers, that I mentioned above, he continually references top line revenue growth as one of the main common indicators of a possible 100 Bagger. This isn\u2019t to tell you that any stock I pick will be a 100 Bagger just because it has great top line revenue growth, but if I am looking at a growth stock to hold for the long term, revenue growth is one of the first things I look at.\n\nBefore I talk about the revenue streams of Smartsheet, I want to share a little bit about the actual product that they sell to earn this revenue. Co-Founder/CEO Mark Mader realized that a lot of work in the corporate world was being done on spreadsheets such as Microsoft Excel. However, he realized that these spreadsheets were largely static and not necessarily used to their full potential. He wanted to help people get more out of their use of spreadsheets. As a result, we now have Smartsheets which is a cloud based platform that can be accessed by all employees of the company no matter where they are with live information about project statuses, meeting times and work that is assigned to each employee just to name a few uses. Users can choose their way of viewing this information with different views such as calendar view, grid view, card view, and Gantt view. \n\nThe idea is that by enhancing the availability and quality of asynchronous information available to all members of a team about the status of a project, the tasks assigned, and the timelines, the less synchronous communication will be needed which allows employees to spend more time doing what they\u2019re hired to do \u2013 get work done. Think about how wasteful it is to hire a highly talented engineer but then make him spend half his day preparing for and doing status update meetings and hunting people down to see where they\u2019re at with their assignments. What if all this information was available for him, his managers, and his staff to see within Smartsheet without having to bother each other and waste precious work hours that could be used for coding, designing, and producing? That\u2019s what Smartsheet looks to achieve.\n\nFor Smartsheet, their means of making money is quite simple. As I mentioned earlier, they are a Software as a Service (SaaS) company. Whenever you see SaaS, that means subscription revenue and in my opinion that\u2019s a very good thing. With a subscription business model, the revenue is going to be recurring every year and that type of reliability (combined with growth of course) is something you want as an investor.\n\nSmartsheet\u2019s primary source of revenue is the sale of subscriptions to their cloud-based Collaborative Work Management (CWM) platform. Customers and potential customers begin their engagement with the Smartsheet platform by either signing up for a free trial, purchasing a subscription on the Smartsheet website, going through a sales rep, or they are exposed to Smartsheet by collaborating with a Company/Individual that uses Smartsheet.  For subscriptions, customers select the plan that meets their needs and can begin using Smartsheet within minutes.\n\nSmartsheet offers four subscription levels: Individual, Business, Enterprise, and Premier, the pricing for which varies by the capabilities provided. Customers can also purchase connectors, which provide data integration and automation to third-party applications.\n\nThe Connectors part of the business is something I find really interesting. Basically, Smartsheet has made deals with most of the top work productivity and communication software companies in the world to allow their customers to use those applications within their Smartsheet user interface. This helps position Smartsheet as the true \u201ccommand center\u201d platform while the products of the other companies become ancillary pieces. You\u2019ll see this on the link above but some products that Smartsheet sells Connectors for include Adobe Creative Cloud, Microsoft Dynamics 365, Salesforce, Jira Software, Slack, and Skype just to name a few.\n\nI think that being able to sell these Connectors as ancillary pieces to the Smartsheet user experience is so beneficial to Smartsheet because a lot of these companies that people may perceive as \u201cSmartsheet competitors\u201d actually become a piece of the Smartsheet platform and can be sold by Smartsheet as a supplemental revenue stream. This neutral angle that Smartsheet is able to come from by selling Connectors to their perceived \u201ccompetitors\u201d reminds me a little bit of how Roku (ROKU) is able to earn revenue off of selling a Netflix subscription on their platform. I think just the fact that all these big companies like Adobe, Jira, Salesforce, etc. allow their products to be integrated into Smartsheet shows that there is a high value proposition in the Smartsheet platform and that they would risk alienating their customers if they didn\u2019t allow for their products to be integrated with Smartsheet.\n\nOn top of the Connectors to third party vendors that Smartsheet is able to sell, Smartsheet is also able to sell upgrades to their own internal plug-ins. Smartsheet has some impressive proprietary plug-ins they can sell to their customers. For example, in May 2019, Smartsheet acquired 10,000ft which augmented their product portfolio by providing resource allocation and planning. The name \u201c10,000ft\u201d is meant to be analogous to having a high level view of your company and all resources available within your company and how to deploy them. \n\nAlso, in September 2020, Smartsheet acquired Brandfolder, Inc. which provides a centralized platform to organize, discover, control, distribute, and measure all forms of digital content. Combining Brandfolder capabilities with Smartsheet allows them to create dynamic solutions that manage workflows around content and collaboration. This goes back to what I said earlier in the article about how my girlfriend had mentioned that her company\u2019s marketing team was \u201creally excited about Smartsheet because it makes their job way easier and more enjoyable.\u201d She told me that before Smartsheet, her company\u2019s marketing team had to constantly hunt down members of the creative team (photographers, graphic designers) to receive the latest photos, videos, and digital designs they were working on. She said it was a big pain for them trying to share this content over email and SharePoint. Now, all of the content is inside of Smartsheet and the marketing team can access it at any time. They can leave comments on the content, route to appropriate individuals for approvals, and have better insight into the status of all digital content that is being worked on. The acquisition of Brandfolder is really what allows Smartsheet to stand out in this department. \n\nNobody really talks about it, but digital content is so important these days for companies in terms of controlling their brand image, putting out quality advertisements, and presenting their product in as positive of a light as possible. The fact that Smartsheet has a strong proprietary plug-in for this with Brandfolder is very promising. During Smartsheet\u2019s FY21 Engage Customer Conference, Anna Griffin, Smartsheet Chief Marketing Officer said that the global annual marketing spend is $500B for companies around the world. She said the role of the marketing department is changing from sole content creator to Editor in Chief. All kinds of teams within companies these days are putting out content that effects the company\u2019s brand. Sales is running social media campaigns, product marketing is putting out blog posts and podcasts, and R&amp;D is teasing new product experiences in app. It can get really difficult for the company\u2019s Marketing/Branding team to stay on top of all this without a centralized digital content collaboration platform like Brandfolder in Smartsheet. This is just one reason why I think Smartsheet has a lot of growth opportunities in the future.\n\nAs you can see, Smartsheet has a lot to offer to companies with their core CWM platform, the Connectors they can sell, and the internal upgrades available such as 10,000ft and Brandfolder. On top of that, Smartsheet also provides WorkApps, a proprietary no-code platform that empowers users to build intuitive web and mobile applications that streamline business and simplify collaboration. There are so many instances within companies where an app needs to be built to streamline a workflow. Traditionally, companies need to engage their IT departments and the coders that sit within these departments to build these apps. This places a lot of strain on IT departments and takes away time they can be spending on more complex/mission critical projects. Mark Mader is aware of this and thus is heavily pushing no-code as a solution for companies now and in the future. He believes that everyday non-coder employees know their jobs/workflows best and thus if you empower them to build their own apps with a no-code platform they will produce better and more relevant apps to help get work done than an IT department employee who doesn\u2019t even do the job that the app is being built for. Also, he believes this will reduce strain on IT departments and allow them to focus on more complex and mission critical projects.\n\nHere is a quote from the Director of Sales (Hina Patel) at a Smartsheet customer, Cisco (NASDAQ: CSCO): \u201cI have been waiting for a solution like WorkApps that can give us quick and easy access to the content we need, when and where we need it,\u201d said Hina Patel, Director of Sales Operations at Cisco. \u201cThe ability to take our Smartsheet assets, along with other tools we use, and package an entire solution in an intuitive app will make it even easier to drive active participation from everyone involved in the process, no matter their role.\u201d As you can see, the value proposition of WorkApps and the Smartsheet platform appears to be high.\n\nLastly, Smartsheet also generates revenue from Professional Services which is essentially providing training and customized consulting to Smartsheet customers that want to get more out of the Smartsheet platform. In the most recent quarter, Q3 FY21, Professional Services accounted for 8.2% of revenue. Here is the breakout from the most recent quarter:\n\nSubscription revenue = $90,890M for 91.8% of total revenue\n\nProfessional services revenue = $8,043M for 8.2% of total revenue\n\nThis is the end of my first article about Smartsheet. My goal is to drop Part 2 within the next week. The focus of Part 2 will be an in depth answer of the question \u2013 \u201cCan we 10x from here?\u201d\n\n  **TL:DR**\n\n* This is Part 1 of my two part deep dive on Smartsheet (Ticker: SMAR). \n* This first part introduces you to (1) me, (2) the company, (3) my thesis on the company, and (4) digs into how they make money.\n* Part 2 (to be released later this week) will go in depth to explore the question \u201cCan we 10x from here?\u201d If you enjoyed this article and want to make sure you catch Part 2, [subscribe here.](https://onthemarkpicks.com/subscribe-today/) \n* Smartsheet is an exciting SaaS company that\u2019s helping businesses be more productive and get the most out of their people\n* I am not a financial advisor and this is not investment advice. These are just my opinions to help facilitate learning and discussion.\n\n**Disclosure:** I have no position in Smartsheet. I do plan to initiate a long position when the markets open again in 2021.  I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it. I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.",

They understand that by empowering their  teams with no-code solutions that facilitate asynchronous work, cycle  times will be improved, a deeper sense of ownership will be created, and  prioritization and accountability will be insured. Smartsheet is  ideally suited to help enterprises work more asynchronously to derive  the benefits from doing so.\u201d\n\nKey word here: Asynchronous. Asynchronous communication is different from Synchronous communication. Here is the difference:\n\nAsynchronous: email, message boards, dashboards, etc.\n\nSynchronous: video conferencing, chat, audio calls, etc.\n\nAny  communication that doesn\u2019t require a real-time response can be  considered asynchronous, like the examples in the picture above.  Synchronous communication is any communication that happens in real  time, thereby allowing for immediate responses, see examples above. As  part of my research on Smartsheet, I read an E-Book that was written by  the original co-founders of Smartsheet, Mark Mader the current CEO and  Brent Frei who is no longer with the company. They wrote the E-Book in  2007 just a couple of years after the 2005 founding. The E-Book is  called \u201cThe Power of Done\u201d. The moral of the book is that Mark and Brent  noticed through their own experience, and through different research  studies on work place productivity, that the rise in technology in the  early 21st century was actually making employees less productive. This  is a quote from their E-Book:\n\n\u201cAccording  to Basex, a research firm focusing on the knowledge economy,  interruptions from email, cell phones, instant messaging, text messaging  and blogs eat up nearly 30 percent of each day; on an annualized basis,  this represents a loss of 28 billion hours for the entire U.S.  workforce, or a $588 billion cost to the American economy.\u201d\n\nThey  mention in their book that although there has been a lot of advances in  work technology such as email, word processing, and spreadsheets, there  hadn\u2019t at that time been any great applications created for teamwork  collaboration or task management. The fact that technology advances  helped the world create tools to enhance productivity but also deterred  productivity at the same time is what Mark and Brent referred to as the  productivity paradox. They wanted to do something about it and thus they  founded Smartsheet.\n\n**How Smartsheet makes money**\n\nAt  the very least, before you invest in a company, you better understand  how they make money. In Chris Mayers\u2019 excellent book, 100 Baggers, that I  mentioned above, he continually references top line revenue growth as  one of the main common indicators of a possible 100 Bagger. This isn\u2019t  to tell you that any stock I pick will be a 100 Bagger just because it  has great top line revenue growth, but if I am looking at a growth stock  to hold for the long term, revenue growth is one of the first things I  look at.\n\nBefore I talk about the  revenue streams of Smartsheet, I want to share a little bit about the  actual product that they sell to earn this revenue. Co-Founder/CEO Mark  Mader realized that a lot of work in the corporate world was being done  on spreadsheets such as Microsoft Excel. However, he realized that these  spreadsheets were largely static and not necessarily used to their full  potential. He wanted to help people get more out of their use of  spreadsheets. As a result, we now have Smartsheets which is a cloud  based platform that can be accessed by all employees of the company no  matter where they are with live information about project statuses,  meeting times and work that is assigned to each employee just to name a  few uses. Users can choose their way of viewing this information with  different views such as calendar view, grid view, card view, and Gantt  view.\n\nThe idea is that by  enhancing the availability and quality of asynchronous information  available to all members of a team about the status of a project, the  tasks assigned, and the timelines, the less synchronous communication  will be needed which allows employees to spend more time doing what  they\u2019re hired to do \u2013 get work done. Think about how wasteful it is to  hire a highly talented engineer but then make him spend half his day  preparing for and doing status update meetings and hunting people down  to see where they\u2019re at with their assignments. What if all this  information was available for him, his managers, and his staff to see  within Smartsheet without having to bother each other and waste precious  work hours that could be used for coding, designing, and producing?  That\u2019s what Smartsheet looks to achieve.\n\nFor  Smartsheet, their means of making money is quite simple. As I mentioned  earlier, they are a Software as a Service (SaaS) company. Whenever you  see SaaS, that means subscription revenue and in my opinion that\u2019s a  very good thing. With a subscription business model, the revenue is  going to be recurring every year and that type of reliability (combined  with growth of course) is something you want as an investor.\n\nSmartsheet\u2019s  primary source of revenue is the sale of subscriptions to their  cloud-based Collaborative Work Management (CWM) platform. Customers and  potential customers begin their engagement with the Smartsheet platform  by either signing up for a free trial, purchasing a subscription on the  Smartsheet website, going through a sales rep, or they are exposed to  Smartsheet by collaborating with a Company/Individual that uses  Smartsheet.  For subscriptions, customers select the plan that meets  their needs and can begin using Smartsheet within minutes.\n\nSmartsheet  offers four subscription levels: Individual, Business, Enterprise, and  Premier, the pricing for which varies by the capabilities provided.  Customers can also purchase connectors, which provide data integration  and automation to third-party applications.\n\nThe  Connectors part of the business is something I find really interesting.  Basically, Smartsheet has made deals with most of the top work  productivity and communication software companies in the world to allow  their customers to use those applications within their Smartsheet user  interface. This helps position Smartsheet as the true \u201ccommand center\u201d  platform while the products of the other companies become ancillary  pieces. You\u2019ll see this on the link above but some products that  Smartsheet sells Connectors for include Adobe Creative Cloud, Microsoft  Dynamics 365, Salesforce, Jira Software, Slack, and Skype just to name a  few.\n\nI think that being able to  sell these Connectors as ancillary pieces to the Smartsheet user  experience is so beneficial to Smartsheet because a lot of these  companies that people may perceive as \u201cSmartsheet competitors\u201d actually  become a piece of the Smartsheet platform and can be sold by Smartsheet  as a supplemental revenue stream. This neutral angle that Smartsheet is  able to come from by selling Connectors to their perceived \u201ccompetitors\u201d  reminds me a little bit of how Roku (ROKU) is able to earn revenue off  of selling a Netflix subscription on their platform. I think just the  fact that all these big companies like Adobe, Jira, Salesforce, etc.  allow their products to be integrated into Smartsheet shows that there  is a high value proposition in the Smartsheet platform and that they  would risk alienating their customers if they didn\u2019t allow for their  products to be integrated with Smartsheet.\n\nOn  top of the Connectors to third party vendors that Smartsheet is able to  sell, Smartsheet is also able to sell upgrades to their own internal  plug-ins. Smartsheet has some impressive proprietary plug-ins they can  sell to their customers. For example, in May 2019, Smartsheet acquired  10,000ft which augmented their product portfolio by providing resource  allocation and planning. The name \u201c10,000ft\u201d is meant to be analogous to  having a high level view of your company and all resources available  within your company and how to deploy them.\n\nAlso,  in September 2020, Smartsheet acquired Brandfolder, Inc. which provides  a centralized platform to organize, discover, control, distribute, and  measure all forms of digital content. Combining Brandfolder capabilities  with Smartsheet allows them to create dynamic solutions that manage  workflows around content and collaboration. This goes back to what I  said earlier in the article about how my girlfriend had mentioned that  her company\u2019s marketing team was \u201creally excited about Smartsheet  because it makes their job way easier and more enjoyable.\u201d She told me  that before Smartsheet, her company\u2019s marketing team had to constantly  hunt down members of the creative team (photographers, graphic  designers) to receive the latest photos, videos, and digital designs  they were working on. She said it was a big pain for them trying to  share this content over email and SharePoint. Now, all of the content is  inside of Smartsheet and the marketing team can access it at any time.  They can leave comments on the content, route to appropriate individuals  for approvals, and have better insight into the status of all digital  content that is being worked on. The acquisition of Brandfolder is  really what allows Smartsheet to stand out in this department.\n\nNobody  really talks about it, but digital content is so important these days  for companies in terms of controlling their brand image, putting out  quality advertisements, and presenting their product in as positive of a  light as possible. The fact that Smartsheet has a strong proprietary  plug-in for this with Brandfolder is very promising. During Smartsheet\u2019s  FY21 Engage Customer Conference, Anna Griffin, Smartsheet Chief  Marketing Officer said that the global annual marketing spend is $500B  for companies around the world. She said the role of the marketing  department is changing from sole content creator to Editor in Chief. All  kinds of teams within companies these days are putting out content that  effects the company\u2019s brand. Sales is running social media campaigns,  product marketing is putting out blog posts and podcasts, and R&amp;D is  teasing new product experiences in app. It can get really difficult for  the company\u2019s Marketing/Branding team to stay on top of all this  without a centralized digital content collaboration platform like  Brandfolder in Smartsheet. This is just one reason why I think  Smartsheet has a lot of growth opportunities in the future.\n\nAs  you can see, Smartsheet has a lot to offer to companies with their core  CWM platform, the Connectors they can sell, and the internal upgrades  available such as 10,000ft and Brandfolder. On top of that, Smartsheet  also provides WorkApps, a proprietary no-code platform that empowers  users to build intuitive web and mobile applications that streamline  business and simplify collaboration. There are so many instances within  companies where an app needs to be built to streamline a workflow.  Traditionally, companies need to engage their IT departments and the  coders that sit within these departments to build these apps. This  places a lot of strain on IT departments and takes away time they can be  spending on more complex/mission critical projects. Mark Mader is aware  of this and thus is heavily pushing no-code as a solution for companies  now and in the future. He believes that everyday non-coder employees  know their jobs/workflows best and thus if you empower them to build  their own apps with a no-code platform they will produce better and more  relevant apps to help get work done than an IT department employee who  doesn\u2019t even do the job that the app is being built for. Also, he  believes this will reduce strain on IT departments and allow them to  focus on more complex and mission critical projects.\n\nHere  is a quote from the Director of Sales (Hina Patel) at a Smartsheet  customer, Cisco (NASDAQ: CSCO): \u201cI have been waiting for a solution like  WorkApps that can give us quick and easy access to the content we need,  when and where we need it,\u201d said Hina Patel, Director of Sales  Operations at Cisco. \u201cThe ability to take our Smartsheet assets, along  with other tools we use, and package an entire solution in an intuitive  app will make it even easier to drive active participation from everyone  involved in the process, no matter their role.\u201d As you can see, the  value proposition of WorkApps and the Smartsheet platform appears to be  high.\n\nLastly, Smartsheet also  generates revenue from Professional Services which is essentially  providing training and customized consulting to Smartsheet customers  that want to get more out of the Smartsheet platform. In the most recent  quarter, Q3 FY21, Professional Services accounted for 8.2% of revenue.  Here is the breakout from the most recent quarter:\n\nSubscription revenue = $90,890M for 91.8% of total revenue\n\nProfessional services revenue = $8,043M for 8.2% of total revenue\n\nThis  is the end of my first article about Smartsheet.
