Microsoft pretty much back to normal.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe've missed out havnt we?, what do we do now?, go all in with these near record highs and just ignore my trading account the the next 5 years?",

        "selftext": "Alright, my bad everyone. This last post was really lazy, and I realize that I had nothing in there this morning after waking up, and seeing 43 comments making fun of a shitpost I labeled as DD.\n\n#LET'S TRY THIS AGAIN\n\nThe initial post had one image in it, and it was apparently only after that it showed no actual information.\n\n[Here's the full image](https://i.imgur.com/NJ6gs2r.png) - It's SPY, on the one day, and we're focusing on the apparent downturn on Friday.\n\nThe reason I'm saying this is going to be a downturn, is because this sentiment is shared with multiple other stocks in the S&amp;P and elsewhere:\n\n[Here's AMD in the same time period with no settings changed.](https://i.imgur.com/lSDnSmv.png) It appears further along in its downturn.\n\n[Here's Visa with the same downturn potential.](https://i.imgur.com/BjVeGPA.png)\n\n[Here's Microsoft](https://i.imgur.com/SK0YdlV.png)\n\n[Here's Apple](https://i.imgur.com/0BFDaR2.png)\n\n[Here's GM](https://i.imgur.com/bwoVCcW.png)\n\n[Here's JPM](https://i.imgur.com/YoY0QNK.png)\n\n[Here's GS](https://i.imgur.com/r6Jqjc4.png)\n\nWhat originally got me taking a look at this is the gobs macking nature of the market, and the \"how could this possibly be up right now\" ideation which everyone has. I started taking a look at downward trends, and tried it from a week out. The key answer is: It's not. On a weekly basis, the market sentiment [is absolutely down, and appears to be falling like a rock](https://i.imgur.com/FjQST1e.png)\n\nThere's nothing really substantial about the MACD settings I have in here. They're a little more sensitive close in, and I prefer over Wilders because It seems to better predict significant movements.\n\n[When drawing support lines](https://i.imgur.com/jwbMUc4.png), taking into account the high, and moving toward the low with the opposite channel, there's a definitive direction taking place. The lower bollinger is midway through the channel, with the low indicating SPY ~190.\n\n[The four hour MACD has already crossed as of Tuesday (May 31st)](https://i.imgur.com/jPURern.png), and once the daily follows, which I am presuming it will, things are going to go down significantly. I'm envisioning an opposite reaction with at least the same force as the [bull trap which was set up here.](https://i.imgur.com/Ktmgr6v.png)\n\nTaking a look at the scale, and time on the daily, it appears that by next Friday, SPY is going to be following its 4 hour downward. It could be even closer if the oil talks do not go well. If they do, this sentiment may be pushed off until the following week.\n\nI do not recommend anybody hold calls for outside next week. I do not recommend that anyone hold stocks past next week, unless they're bull ETFs.\n\nTo explain my sentiment, we're seeing decreasing volume on most stocks. I presume this is because everyone is of the same mind: this bull trend doesn't make sense. We're going to see more COVID deaths, company production is halted, and nothing is being manufactured. There's no way for cash injections to buoy a market which is literally producing nothing. Further, the price of oil will not either. The weekly sentiment is strong down, the 4 hour is peaking down, and this is across the board on all the stocks I've listed above. SPY will eventually follow the separate stock trends, and we're going to see some amazing losses.\n\nSuggested positions:\n\n   * [AAPL - 180p - 1MAY20](https://i.imgur.com/pYKw3fD.png)\n   * [AMD - 30p - 1MAY20](https://i.imgur.com/IIZYdVp.png)\n   * [JPM - 50p - 1MAY20](https://i.imgur.com/z5DzliZ.png)\n   * [SNE - 44p - 1MAY20](https://i.imgur.com/KEBLC4Z.png)\n   * [SPY - fuck, I dunno. Maybe 190p, but 180p maybe too - 1MAY20](https://i.imgur.com/dtMWnZm.png)\n   * [DIS - 70p? 65p? 1MAY20](https://i.imgur.com/PMU1DfA.png)\n   * [YUM - 40p/35p 1MAY20](https://i.imgur.com/3T4OKS6.png)\n   * [ALLY - they're fucked. I dunno. 6p, 4p - 15 may?](https://i.imgur.com/70ojmh9.png)\n   * [C - 15p - 1MAY20](https://i.imgur.com/W4cqqaQ.png)\n   * [GS - 100p - 1MAY20](https://i.imgur.com/3k2IW9G.png)\n\n\nOn Ally - they're probably going to go bankrupt. Most of their business is auto loan servicing, something no one has any interest in paying when they're going to need food and need to pay rent. Further, the federal government has had no discussions about auto loan bailouts. I looked into their 10k which was released in Feb, and 5/6ths of their loans are for cars. Further, 40% of those loans were made to people with a sub-700 credit rating. They have been getting into the mortgage game, but it's a modicum of their portfolio. I don't think they're making it out of this year alive.\n\nWe're seeing a pattern here right? All of those images above - The sentiment across the market is clear: we're plumbing depths, and you almost can't fuck this up. Buy a put, make sure the strike price makes sense a little bit, and get. dat. cash.",

        "selftext": "What an insane week! Total profit was around $16.5k with a huge part of that due to USO. I said this before and I\u2019ll say it again, anyone shorting oil in the low $20s is absolutely brain dead. Even without the tweet oil would\u2019ve shot up to $30 soon. It doesn\u2019t matter how low supply is, when enough rigs shut down price will have to go up. Also, every piece of news was about countries begging Saudi to cut production and even logistically the Saudis need to cut due to their break even being the $70s. This is why they wanted Russia to agree to their plan to cut more during the last OPEC+ meeting. I\u2019m not sure where all these people got the info that the Saudis break even is in the teens but it is fake news and they are hurting as much if not more than everyone else. Finally, I know this sub doesn\u2019t believe in crayons but WTI hit $20 **FOUR** separate times and each time it bounced off with significant volume. \n\nThat being said I\u2019m writing more puts on USO this week when it inevitably dips. Probably try to write options on SPY and AMD since there are no fun earnings this week. Let me know what options you are writing. \n\nProof from the last week: https://i.imgur.com/5f09pNz.png \n\nThe first two option plays expired worthless. Not pictured was the WFC puts which was another $300 in profit. This screenshot is right before I sold the USO shares and bought back the calls early Friday so I missed out on the big EOD run. Total profit off of USO with all the puts, calls, and shares was 21k over the past 3 weeks.\n\n\nTLDR: Big money wants WTI above $20, I cashed in on this fact.",

Not many plays you can make on the stock market.\n\nFrom tech overall\n\n- Would not buy or hold Microsoft. Their tech is mostly garbage.\n- AMD is right now leading the race (Threadrippers CPUs are absolute monsters, Intel has a severe vulnerability again), but the tables are turning every couple of years.

        "selftext": "The Nasdaq is basically flat year to date. All the FAANG stocks are near all time highs. Facebook, Netflix and Google all missed on EPS estimates. Apple is likely to be hit even worse (sales are down and stores are closed) which leaves Amazon as the only member of FAANG that is likely to beat on earnings.\n\nHere's the thing, according to earnings calls and the current economic trend, they were only beginning to experience negative effects for the last few weeks of the quarter. GDP declined by 4.8% this quarter, whereas economists are projecting a decline of 30% to 40% next quarter. \n\nIf we look at tech across the board, we have some winners like Microsoft and Zoom, but chip makers like AMD (which met EPS estimates but didn't beat) and Qualcom both delivered poor guidance for coming quarters. AMD has been rallying back to all time highs. Nvidia is also near all time highs. Yet, despite the relative strength in the tech sector, the current trend of earnings, economic forecasts and guidance (or lack thereof) strongly suggests that tech will take a huge hit to earnings in coming quarters.\n\nLet's look at how concentrated the S&amp;P is in the very top tech stocks [https://i.imgur.com/Gir5SXH.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/Gir5SXH.jpg) This blows the dot com boom out of the water. Now consider how much of the S&amp;P the rest of the tech stocks account for.\n\nAll of this is to say, watch these tech stocks closely.  If they fall, the indexes will go with them. There is a high probability they will lead the next leg of the drop.\n\nAlso, here's my take on the long term value of these stocks. The US is moving closer and closer towards adopting basic income. Nothing is guaranteed, but if anything has made the case for increased automation coupled with basic income, it's the current circumstance. Such a policy would likely necessitate a rise in corporate taxes or a VAT. That's a direct hit to earnings of notorious tax evaders like Amazon. In addition, basic income would give working class people more leverage in holding out for higher pay because they wouldn't be weighing job offers against total destitution. This too would detract heavily from future earnings.\n\nAfter the 2000 crash, the Nasdaq didn't recover to the highs for 15 years. If you look at that S&amp;P chart I posted, two of the top five stocks were Microsoft and Intel. Microsoft took 16 years to recover to its highs and Intel never full recovered.\n\nTherefor, I advise extreme caution in this environment. Do not be shamed out of taking profits near all time highs if that's what you personally feel comfortable with. I won't say it's wrong to hold if you're ready to accept the risk, however, just because these companies are good \"blue chips stocks\" that doesn't mean that they're low risk or no risk, regardless of your time horizon. That's just my two cents.",

        "selftext": " **Why The Stock Market Will Fall**\n\n**History:**\n\n\u201cHistory repeats itself\u201d, we have all heard the saying and oftentimes this has been proven to be true, ironically. Human nature is quite predictable, basing off Maslow\u2019s hierarchy of needs, and this nature can be translated to market trends as well. As Warren Buffet has said, \u201cIf you stay in the market long enough you will see everything\u201d. This is mainly because the market follows similar trends over the course of 56 months to complete one cycle. \n\nNow you may be wondering what is part of this cycle because if you knew it, of course, you could become a millionaire. Well, sorry to burst your bubble, but that isn\u2019t true. Although there is a cycle it can\u2019t be perfectly timed due to other factors from politics, epidemics (had to add that recently), and even personal fears.   \n\nNevertheless, I will quickly go through a crash course of the cycle. The complete market cycle goes through periods of bull runs and bear runs with depression being accounted for every 70 or so years (Ray Dalio). The average bull market from 1937 to 2013 is about 39 months. The average bear market is about 17 months, the same as the most recent one. So that comes out to be a total of around 56 months for one cycle.\n\n\u201cThe 5 years from 2005 to 2010 is one of the greatest examples of history. During those years, stocks were rising sharply through 2007 and then reversed down over -50% and then moved back up nearly 70%. It was the highest volatility ever recorded since the Great Depression. That is true both in terms of the swings and the average daily range in prices. From April 2005 through April 2010 the S&amp;P 500 stock index ended with a slight loss across the full market cycle. Many alternative investment strategies or alternative trading strategies have an absolute return objective to create profits across a complete market cycle rather than track a benchmark.\u201d \n\nNow what we can get from that is the idea that a market cycle has been proven in the past, even though bear and bull loyalists have always hoped the next cycle doesn\u2019t contain the other side. But there is a bigger concept that is at play here and that is the idea that if a bull and bear trend can come to rough estimates then we can figure out the relative bottom for this cycle based on previous years. So looking  back at the last two cycles we get these two crises:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0c20wft8d4u41.png?width=689&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d7afb4beb2364bd9c6c558986f4ef8785d764e79\n\nNow aside from the fact that both these declines were a headache for anyone who was trying to time the bottom, we can see a few trends. \n\nFirst I would like to point out the relatively long \u201cdouble top\u201d and \u201cinverted cup with handle\u201d bearish patterns.  The market has declined with signs of it regaining traction from Feb-08 to June-08 and March-00 to Sep-00, only to prove the bull wrong in the end by pulling the rug from underneath them. Now this is not to say that the classic saying of \u201cstocks only go up\u201d is wrong, at least that is the case in long term investments as the market rises with the global knowledge model since knowledge is a constantly growing factor with little to no fluctuations. But at least in the short term (5 years), there are occurrences of a drop, which for casual traders is difficult to deal with.\n\nSecondly, this graph is our initial proof of the cyclical pattern with the Tech Bubble 2000-2002 recession lasting 19 months and the Financial crisis 2007-2009 lasting 17 months. But the two bear markets are not enough proof to validate a report that collides with huge funds like the very trustworthy Goldman Sachs (LMAO). So let us go back in history to the past few bear markets and I'll give a quick overview of all of them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hvi8dn28d4u41.jpg?width=960&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=786b67c871ace081f2e1ebffa13204121514b452\n\nWhen looking at the previous graph it becomes quite clear that when the sun shines on the bear it shines bright. The bull markets in no sense are something to mock and for any long term investor who doesn\u2019t care for the 5-year cycle but only looks to have a satisfactory return by their retirement. However, for any options trader or individual seeking to be actively involved in the market be it to make quick money for college, a new house, a new car or a wedding, this is a keen insight. As is visible, no bear market in the past has lasted only 1 to 2 months, as some believe this bear market will. Similarly, the drops have been significant but not rapid as they keep fluctuating and come to bottom around -34.33% from ATH. \n\nNow the S&amp;P 500, as great as it is, isn\u2019t the only indicator of where a market stands. VIX also plays an active role in determining bottoms or at least drops. For this, I will refer to the discussion board post as I believe u/BlueTreeCloud said it best:\n\n\u201cBear market rallies and VIX capitulation: One consistent theme in equity market crashes is that the VIX tends to capitulate before the equity market troughs. The peak in the VIX is typically followed by a bear market rally, and the market then makes new lows. For example, in 2008 the VIX peaked in October, followed by a 24% bear market rally into December. Subsequently, the SPX troughed four months after the VIX peaked \u2013 in March 2009.\n\nThe current bear market rally is larger, but not that dissimilar in magnitude to those seen in 2001 and 2008. If the market follows the same path today as in 2008-09, then that could see the SPX reach a low near the end of July, at a level of 1900, down 30% from the current spot. Estimating the lows: Instead of using just 2008, we take the average ratio from every crash, between the SPX level at the VIX peak and the eventual lows. That suggests an anticipated trough of around 2140. Alternatively, 1935, if we use the average of just recessionary instances.\n\nTiming of the low: Recessionary bear markets are typically very long. The duration between VIX peak and SPX trough also tends to be longer in deeper recessions. On average, spot lows come 140 days after the VIX peak during recessions, vs just 42 days in all crashes. Applying those averages to the VIX peak on 16 March would imply market lows between mid-April and early August. The risk to this view is that it will take longer for the economy to recover. If the crash morphs into a more typical recessionary one in terms of length, then we may not see the lows until late next year\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hlpbr457d4u41.png?width=743&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=01508b31dba48ca62105917a328a51b7483ce9fa\n\nWith the recent increase in VIX as we saw with the March drop, we can see that another drop is coming soon. The VIX comparative model can be seen in the 1929 crash as well with stocks hitting record highs and then crashing.  This can also be seen through the rapid increase in short contracts being bought indicating that the MMs have decided to hurt the common investor once again for more gain. \n\nHistory and trends are a strong method of predicting the market as people in general fall for the same mistakes just with different words. That's one of the big reasons the financial loan bubble is reforming, according to Michael Burry. However, for our current situation to look at history and previous trends at least in my opinion is a strong model and proves many rights if analyzed correctly.\n\n**Analytics:**\n\nNow I am no mathematician nor genius, if I was I would be making this report not for the public but rather for the Market Makers. Nonetheless, analytics when it comes to the stock market is quite fun and so I decided to spend a few months learning them extensively and started using them, leading to my investment strategy becoming much more comprehensive. This was around 2 years ago and so since then I have had some practice with working with the numbers but I also rely on other members of society and so this part will be directed mainly from u/aibnsamin1 and u/Variation-Separate along with a few relatively trustworthy articles. \n\nThree major methods of using analytics are time analysis, similar to historic trends, technical analysis, and price analysis. We will touch base on all three fronts for this report. \n\nWhen scanning discussion boards I noticed that u/aibnsamin1 articulated upon the concept of technical analysis exceptionally well: Technical indicators are often considered self-fulfilling prophecies due to mass-market psychology gravitating towards certain common numbers yielded from them. This means traders must be especially aware of these numbers as they can prognosticate market movements. Often, they are meaningless in the larger picture of things. Volume, another aspect of technical analysis, derived from the market itself, is mostly irrelevant. The major problem with volume is that the US market open causes tremendous volume surges eradicating any intrinsic volume analysis. At major highs and lows, the market is typically anemic. Most traders are not active in terminal discrete because of levels of fear. It allows us confidence in time and price symmetry market inflection points if we observe low volume at a foretold range of values. We can rationalize that an absolute discrete is usually only discovered and anticipated by very few traders. As the general market realizes it, a herd mentality will push the market in the direction favorable to defending it. Volume is also useful for swing trading, as chances for swing\u2019s validity increases if an increase in volume is seen on and after the swing\u2019s activation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f6ms5sx4d4u41.png?width=1108&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6f0fc7658f6e8120cbc963d1421d12a52c86f840\n\nLooking at the bar chart of the S&amp;P 500 we can also see the levels to watch carefully, as we are at the time of writing this part right up against 2885 similar to the March 10th high, just before the market turned lower again. For the market to go any higher the S&amp;P 500 must cross 3000 as it is a huge psychological barrier for some, especially after the recent downturn. The most recent low was on April 9th coming in at 2700. So from the 2200 low we saw recently to the 2900 high we have seen a bounce that many were not expecting. \n\nHowever, with all these odd technical indicators there is an even more surprising factor, the RSI. No don\u2019t worry it\u2019s not the IRS trying to collect your money, RSI simply is an indicator that tells an investor if a stock is oversold or overbought compared to other prices and volumes in a time frame.  RSI when looking at the S&amp;P 500 is surprisingly not very oversold at the moment with it touching the oversold marker around March 23rd and rapidly going higher to mid to upper levels. Rapid growth in RSI may seem like a strong bull market but it is a classic sign of unsustainable growth that usually comes from uneducated investors or because of complacency. \n\nWith RSI currently at 73.6, we see a high indicator of us running up to a recent overbought level. RSI, once breaking its 70-80 barrier, in most cases drops back to its mid-level, which either leads to slow growth or stagnation, however, in market conditions like such it would likely lead to a greater downturn as more people begin to sell off out of fear. Banks could also capitalize on recent highs by beginning a sell-off as they need capital to offset their losses from the recent crash in oil prices, in which many of them held contracts on large investments. In fact, a Singaporian oil firm recently lost $800 million in oil futures alone.\n\nTime analysis to a large extent has already been discussed through the historic section, so this will be short and to the point. Weekly Lows for the last five weeks have been as follows: Mon, Mon, Wed, Wed, Tue with monthly Lows for the last year being on 3/23, 2/28, 1/27, 12/3, 11/1, 10/2, 9/3, 8/5, 7/1, 6/3, 5/31, 4/1. Possible Monthly Lows: 4/27 (Monday). We see that SPY tends to have its lows between three major month clusters: March, July, and November. By looking at the weighted time analysis for daily we can see that the 3rd and 10th days of the months are crucial as they are usually the lowest.\n\n\u201cThe *8.6-Year Armstrong-Princeton Global Economic Confidence* model \u2013 states that 2.15-year intervals occur between corrections, relevant highs, and lows. 2.15 years from the all-time peak discrete is April 14th of 2022. However, we can time-shift to other peaks and troughs to determine a date for this year. If we consider 1/28/2018 as a localized high and apply this model, we get 3/23/20 as a low - strikingly accurate. I have chosen the next localized high, 9/21/2018 to apply the model to. We have achieved a date of 11/14/2020. The average bear market is eighteen months long, giving us a date of August 19th, 2021 for the end of the bear market - roughly speaking.\u201d (u/aibnsamin1)\n\nTA alone doesn\u2019t run the world, and let\u2019s hope it doesn\u2019t because it would lend sole dominancy to computers and algorithms than when it comes to trading. However, to ignore an aspect of trading that is so crucially weighted into large hedge fund decisions would be foolish. The TA provided shows signs of reversals or of a dead cat bounce, but much like any statistic, there is always a chance of the null hypothesis being proven right. As long as the data stays on the indicated charts we could be seeing downturns begin in May or even as late as August. But one aspect of the market is clear: the recent rise in stocks seems to be a facade.\n\n**Logic:**\n\nCommon sense and logic in many cases beat all other factors. Some of my most successful have been based solely on logic and not at all by looking at numbers. The reason being, most people think the same way, so if one person has a brilliant idea most of the time many others do and hence the market begins to move with the person. Usually, the most obvious plays or reasonings work out due to this sole reason. So, looking through the lens of logic, let's decipher why this market is bound to fall.\n\nIs there a vaccine yet? I\u2019ll help you out, no there isn\u2019t. The coronavirus can in no sense be stopped quickly from killing people unless there is some treatment or vaccine. The treatments that are being hyped may not work as effectively as hoped. \u201cThe Gilead action was clearly a fake pump and Remdesivir has been known for a couple of months as a potential treatment, but not a cure-all.\u201d(u/TheInvestmentAdvisor).  Hydroxychloroquine may help but the studies behind it are very mixed and most of the supply is held by India, who are already having their own major crisis with the recent religious war which is using COVID as it\u2019s weapon of choice.\n\nOf course, COVID 19 alone did not cause the fall that we witnessed, the lockdowns played a huge role too. Aside from the panic they caused, they disrupted many industries and supply chains as well. Lockdowns are the sole reason retail employees are being furloughed at such a rapid pace. These are the reasons we are witnessing 22 million unemployed American citizens, more than we have seen since the Great Depression. The scariest part about the lockdown, however, is the fact that Trump has just handed over responsibility to state governments instead of keeping control. The feds know that if they continue to raise the quarantine every month then they will risk being shown as uninformed and so they have placed the responsibility on the governors. Now, this may help Trump win the election potentially due to the fact that any lockdown procedures that go bad, won\u2019t be blamed on him. As far as how the states are handling the lockdown, most are doing fine except for Florida, which opened up beaches, because of course, the sun cures Corona and Texas who is hosting rallies to close the lockdown. With lockdowns most likely to be extended next month, J. B. Pritzker just shut down schools for the rest of the year, we can continue to see higher unemployment numbers, and for states that do open lockdowns, we can expect to see more cases.\n\nA lot of people started their businesses at the top of the market because when everyone is making money people start thinking they are geniuses and should start their own business. Seriously there is a business that started recently to make customized \u201ctera rocks\u201d, do you know what tera rocks mean? It literally means earth rocks with colors being dyed in. So for companies like such, they already don\u2019t have too much money, and by now being sent back home, thankfully, they aren't paying for office rent. On a serious note though, the number of businesses and people not paying their rent is extremely high. \n\n\u201cAirBnB's and generally rented properties are also in a bad place. No one is traveling nor renting them now and some of the owners are over-leveraged and will now be forced to sell or rent. If they rent it out, they are probably no longer cash flowing after debt servicing. Also, most major cities rely on property prices increasing to justify investment as most condo units don't cashflow with a mortgage.\u201d (u/TheInvestmentAdvisor)\n\nThe Real Estate Market is huge, as visible from all the YouTubers talking about how flipping houses with initial debt is the key to life, and the debt that backs it up is equally massive. After all, *The Big Short* even pointed out how debt in real estate is awfully managed. So what happens when renters can\u2019t pay their building owners? Hint: the real estate market is beginning to fail too.\n\nThe overall logic shows signs of no approval. The good news is that propping up this dead cat bounce seems to be dying off and larger than life investors are keeping their money safe. With Warren Buffett and Seth Klarman both keeping their cash to themselves, the general public gets subtle advice not to buy in either. Buffet already spoke off how he bought in too early in previous markets and will most likely be waiting longer this time, after all, as he is a master of patience.  \n\nWith the market showing signs of an upcoming reversal, many will be either happy that their contracts or inverse ETFs are finally printing, and many bulls will fight hoof and horn until the market moves up in a year or so. The current situation hasn\u2019t occurred in a long duration of time and so there are always ways that the bear market will not return and within a month the S&amp;P 500 will be the highest ever, however, by looking at the math and history it seems that the market is suggesting that it is about to fall. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA special thanks to u/fuzzyblankeet for giving really informative posts to WSB\n\nAlso, for any of you wondering what my positions are here they are:\n\nBought these around 2 weeks ago\n\nCRWD $80 Call 4/24\n\nSNAP $13 Call 4/24\n\nXOM $33 Put 4/24\n\nBAC $20 Put 4/24\n\nAMD $62 Call 4/24",

        "selftext": "The model that everybody seems to get tits up excited about is this one.\n\n [https://covid19.healthdata.org/united-states-of-america](https://covid19.healthdata.org/united-states-of-america) \n\nIt's by a group that was initially funded by the Bill and Malinda Gates foundation. It is predicting that the last death in the USA will be recorded around May 30th. Everybody can celebrate, buy the fuck out of their favorite stocks, and have one hell of a gay bull orgy fest on May 31st when the bars finally open.\n\nAnd it's wrong. Here's my argument.\n\nFirst, the model is based on recorded deaths in the USA. We know for a fact that recorded deaths is incomplete data. Basically, there is A LOT of evidence that there are people who died of pneumonia recently that have not been tested for the COVID-19. \n\n[https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/coronavirus-death-toll-americans-are-almost-certainly-dying-of-covid-19-but-being-left-out-of-the-official-count/2020/04/05/71d67982-747e-11ea-87da-77a8136c1a6d\\_story.html](https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/coronavirus-death-toll-americans-are-almost-certainly-dying-of-covid-19-but-being-left-out-of-the-official-count/2020/04/05/71d67982-747e-11ea-87da-77a8136c1a6d_story.html)\n\nThey stopped testing a lot of patients because there is very little healthcare value in doing so. The tests should be focused on people it can help. \n\nGarbage in, garbage out. The model isn't factoring in the hundreds or possibly thousands of deaths that haven't been confirmed. It also doesn't know about the thousands \n\nSecond, unless we have sufficient testing, confirmed cases and deaths are meaningless. This is the opinion of Nate Silver. The guy who predicted before the 2016 election that Trump had a 33% chance of winning the election when everybody else said he had a 10% chance. \n\n[https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/coronavirus-case-counts-are-meaningless/](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/coronavirus-case-counts-are-meaningless/)\n\nThird, if you download Nate's \"covidia\" excel model, and look at the default values for this model, you'll see that after the peak you have to wait 95 days before the virus effectively dies out (less than \\~300 new infections, which is 30x the population of \"covidia\"). That's with an anemic R0 value of 0.6 (meaning social distancing reduced how contagious the virus is by about 5X, which is pretty reasonable). \n\nWe haven't seen a peak in detected cases. Even if it was last Saturday, according to Nate's mental exercise model,  we're still looking at July 4th before there are only 300 new cases. AND those 300 cases are still enough to start a new outbreak. Realistically, we need to wait a couple more weeks past the last confirmed case for it to die down.\n\nFour, do you think the stupid fuck Trump is going to force you to stay home with \"only\" 500 confirmed cases in the USA? What about DeSantos who only closed Florida after there were 163 deaths and 8000 confirmed cases. Would he keep Florida closed with \"only\" a thousand non-recovered cases? Yeah, the lack of science in our politicians is going to fuck us. To stop a second wave, we have to stay in quarantine for weeks AFTER the last confirmed case. Basically, our politicians are spinless globs of cherry jello. \n\nFive, the second-third-fourth-fifth wave. If we don't wait long enough to open up and reverse social distancing, the R0 value goes back up. Even with contact tracing and all the titillating stuff South Korea, Taiwan, and Japan have done, they still have an increase in cases. Contact tracing and lots of testing is not sufficient to drop the R0 value below 1.\n\n [https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6](https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6) \n\nSix, you don't need a full lockdown to fuck our economy sixteen ways sideways. Our economy was 11 years into a bull run. The market was begging for a recession, but Donald Pump couldn't help but inject all his magic juice into his bubble for reelection. You get debt, you get debt, you get debt, EVERYBODY GETS DEBT. Debt doesn't create a strong economy. The stupid fuck doesn't realize that you can't just declare bankruptcy and the economy goes on hunky dory. \n\nThere was WAY too much optimism in the economy. Which isn't necessarily a bad thing. It's only bad if too many people are buying Mercedes on subprime refinances on their house. It's bad when people are spending $100k on credit or in subprime business loans to remodel a restaurant in the fucking mall.  \n\nWe're at the first wave of bankruptcies and business failures with the 2% increase in unemployment. The second and third and fourth waves are down the line, even if we could get back to work on May 30th. Delta and Lufthansa get this shit. There is a reason why they are putting planes in long term storage and grounding planes indefinitely. Hint: It's not because they think in 2 months they will be flying the same volume they were 2 months ago. Someone in their management has been through these shit storms and know it's going to last longer than the virus.\n\nI'm almost certain what we got on this new bull run is a lot of money managers saying \"we hit the bottom, everything is ON SALE! We're going to have a V shaped recovery.\" Money managers are basing those opinions on exactly 1/4 of their morning jizz stain. Listen to any economist and they say \"indicators say we got a V recovery coming.\" More, they have no fucking clue. The reason, they don't base their opinions on Jizz. Instead, they base them on the indicators in the economy. And they simply don't have any data to point to a recovery. \n\nSo that leaves me with our bull run. It's based on Hope. Hope that there will be a V shaped recovery. Hope in investing is the fastest way to get you fucked. Wallstreet is like a dark alley with rapists everywhere. Hope won't stop them.\n\nDisclosure: I'm short a shit ton of oil and hotel stocks. Short BA. I got a couple covered calls on WMT and AMD. I also have a few spreads on airlines and real estate because this market went fucking sideways with it's FOMO. I'm also holding about 40% of my portfolio in cash. Basically, I'm stupid fuck, so don't take my word for any of this.",

        "selftext": "Looking for some spirited back and forth from my fellow reddit investors and capitalists. Feel free to rip me, or drop an \"atta boy\" -- That's why we're all here!\n\nDisclaimers: I'm not a FA, and don't pretend to be one. New to reddit, but not to the market. Securities I  currently own are **bolded** so you can check my bias. :)\n\nWMT - Talk about a ship that has been steady through the storm. I sold all of mine back in 2016, fearing cuts to entitlement programs would essentially cut their workforce by 30% overnight. Those cuts never came, and now I want back in.  Grocery pickup and delivery has been the future for a while, but COVID seems to have fast tracked that transition. IMO, it will remain highly popular post pandemic, Walmart will expand on it, and 5 years from now &gt;70% of grocery sales will be a direct competition between them and **AMZN**. I'm taking this one as soon as the right opening appears, with the expectation of holding it long term.  \n\n**KO** \\- First share I ever bought, never let it go, added to it over the years, and might be adding more tomorrow.  Not much to say here. It's priced well and has a scheduled earnings report before opening bell on Tues.  The recent relative success of consumer markets (WMT, **AMZN**, **TGT**, COST) leads me to think that will be a positive report, and if I see nothing indicating otherwise, I'll try to stock up and ride the wave.  Big fan of **PEP** as well -- more diversified than **KO**, but KFC/Tacobell/PH will probably slow any aggressive gains for a while.\n\n**MSFT** \\- Grain of salt time. This is my favorite holding on the market, bar none. **MSFT** and **AMZN** have essentially held up the whole average during this rebound period. It's all about those beautiful beautiful clouds y'all. (military contracts don't hurt either, see **BA**...) It's always a good time to buy Microsoft. \n\nGOOG/**GOOGL** \\- has a bright future in similar areas to **MSFT**, but I hate companies that live and die by advertisement revenue. For that reason I have a very limited holding in only 1 out of the 2, and I stay away from FB and TWT as well.  ITS ALWAYS A GOOD TIME TO BUY MICROSOFT.\n\nT and **DAL** \\- like Coke, they both have earnings to report this week. I think Delta will produce a decent report which will confuse some who don't fully understand that the pandemic split quarters, and much of the carnage won't be known until the end of Q2. If it does bump up, I'll offload shares and buy back lower in the early summer. **DAL** has the best balance sheet as well as the second best executive team in the whole airline industry, and I don't see it going anywhere. T on the other hand looks to be primed for injury if they report negative earnings.  If they fall back below 26, I'm an AT&amp;T buyer all day long. \n\nNFLX - If it were my money, I'd wait for the (very likely) record high earnings report coming up, ride the wave, and sell high.  I'm not a fan of companies who can't seem to be profitable despite overwhelming popularity. Average NFLX account is accessed by &gt;8 users, but only paid for by 1. New competitors emerging. The whole company model just sketches me out. Go prove me wrong Netflix.... but I'll continue to pass for now.\n\nSNE - Gaming has grown in quarantine, Playstation 5 is set to release in the next 2 months, and the stock still has solid rebound potential from its high. I'm at a solid buy here, and I've never owned it before.... so thats exciting!\n\n**V** and **MC** \\- Every single reputable study shows that the very first debt people default on in a recession is their credit card bill. BE VERY CAREFUL HERE.\n\nTSLA - Volatile, Bullish, Enigmatic.... I have no idea what's happening here.  Tesla fanboy's overwhelming enthusiasm make market predictions hard. I'll buy if it drops below 580 again. Don't own any now. Damn sure wish I did....\n\nOther stuff I like right now - **BA**, **JNJ**, **LOW**, **SAVE**, **TDOC**, MDT, HD, **ABT**\n\nOther stuff I'm neutral on - **PG**, LUV, DIS, **NKE**, SHOP, **AMD**, **Oil stocks** (will likely go even lower next month), and **many many many others**.....\n\nOther stuff I hate right now - **AAPL**, cruise lines, or any company that can't survive another big dip. Nobody knows if it's coming. be smart.\n\nDo your thing Reddit, Have a spectacular week, and GOD BLESS AMERICA!",

        "selftext": "This post is stemming from a comment I liked which asks some intelligent questions:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/dragonuity/comments/fvj24m/my_magnum_opus/fnaiaf7/\n\nOriginally, that was meant to just be an archive subreddit. Changed my mind when I received some nice comments lmao.\n\nTo preface: Yea I'm borderline insane.\n\nOk Wallstreetbets.\n\nhere goes nothing. . .\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fyqgre/itll_soon_be_apparent_that_the_us_is_going_to/ \n\n&gt;I saw that post made on wsb, I think I linked it somewhere actually, and it made me pretty happy that my claims were being substantiated by someone within academia independently. If what he claims is true, and the IMHE model is, as I have heard myself, simple curve fitting. I find that pathetic; it can be done on python linear regression modules in a couple of minutes. \n\nI recently looked through one of the most recent models produced by Morgan Stanley (I don\u2019t have an exact date but my friend acquired it sometime during the weekend), I suppose I can point out in detail which part of the current models I hate the most. It\u2019s everything after the top-- which I think will be fairly accurate: \n\nToo many assumptions are being made on containment that get egregiously worse on the way down. Each inaccuracy from the top down build on one another creating a giant avalanche of error. It certainly doesn\u2019t help that the predictions closer to the bottom become very quickly, much more difficult. Alright here\u2019s the graph and I\u2019ll provide some of my personal commentary as well as expectations. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Where the next wave of models might go wrong.** (Notice: I purposely didn't use 'When')\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/GhiQZgh \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n0 : The top. This is going to be fairly accurate with the current data. Might still be a little off even. \n\n1: Initial dropoff. Wishful thinking at best. They\u2019re still assuming ideal conditions for such a sharp dropoff. Last time I checked we didn\u2019t have any mandatory/enforced lockdowns to warrant this steep of an initial dropoff nor the will to. Also when has anything related to testing been on schedule? Is the virus suppose to go away with the heat? It\u2019s not. Ideal. Conditions. \n\n2:  Road to containment. It\u2019s starting to get bullshit. Google+Apple colab is op-in optional, what I'd guess &lt;30% which won\u2019t be significant at all. Everyone still remembers Snowden\u2019s warnings in the back of their minds about a surveillance state. We\u2019re not South Korea. Even Singapore got put into lockdown recently despite its initial success against the virus. An un-containable virus is not going away without drastic measures. Our government officials have demonstrated as much that they are not willing to resort to said measures. Their reactions reflect the feelings of their constituents-- we also hate following rules that infringe on our own privacy and freedoms; the country has to date only been told to stay at home-- even kids won\u2019t listen, why would adults? As far as I see it, the risk is worth the reward. Without compelling reason to, people are not going to change their habits of going out and give up their social lives overnight. Humans are inherently social creatures. Furthermore:\n\nNobody in their right minds, unless they\u2019re forced to, is going to stay at home for over a full month, especially not Americans. If 1. relied on 10 things going right, 2. relies on a magnitude higher, 100.  \n\n3: Containment. Is this some type of fairy tale? This virus has not been contained anywhere yet. There\u2019s too many things wrong with this. It\u2019s not disappearing by August. And what\u2019s to say a 2nd wave of infections is gonna wait conveniently months after the first wave and not start before the 1st wave is over? What about a possible 3rd 4th wave? What if that makes the 1st wave never stop? Why only 2? Why are there periods with 0 cases of the virus in this graph? That alone makes me want to tear it up. If there\u2019s any cases, there\u2019s going to be a lot; we know that much. It\u2019s not going away without a vaccine. I don\u2019t even know why they had the audacity to put a 2nd wave anywhere on this fucking graph without putting asterisks everywhere. Might as well buy a lotto ticket. This part of the graph is about as accurate as winning a jackpot or finding a miracle cure. Did they superimpose China\u2019s graph for this part?  Their entire biotechnology research team should be axed for using China\u2019s pandemic data as legitimate data-points, ridiculous.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt;I\u2019m not providing any evidence. The evidence is everywhere. I\u2019m rambling. But I\u2019m more coherent then whoever was drunk enough to green-light these graphs without the blatant intention of misleading the public. They might as well have drawn a straight line down from the peak to 0. If the virus was going to magically go away anyways, why not all at once? Why wait? There\u2019s no room for any sort of setback for this graph. The real thing is going to be drawn out by many months at least. Anyways. . .\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n0 &gt;&gt; 1 &gt;&gt; 2 &gt;&gt; 3 in terms of difficulty to predict as well as number of underlying conditions that have to go favorably or on schedule. We have not been on schedule on anything so far. Why do we expect the federal government and state governments to suddenly start working together? They\u2019re currently still outbidding each other on medical supplies. There\u2019s too many assumptions for this to be a proper model. Why are they still modeling Covid after previous diseases? \n\n&gt;My personal feelings: I don\u2019t think we\u2019re returning work in any way shape or form until, at the very earliest, fall. And that\u2019s me being overly optimistic. We might not be able to return back at all, except in small quantities, to be perfectly honest. Any Covid graph that looks easy on the eyes and clean should be illegal. It might as well be drawn free-handed. I would really like to know how these things graphs are generated with no evidence. This graph doesn\u2019t even deserve to be called an estimate. It\u2019s so incredibly lazy and bullshit. *It's because it doesn't matter. They can always adjust it later on, just like the rest of their \"forecasts\" on the economy.*\n\nAny actual estimate would have to take over 1000 pages to look at hundreds of moving parts/components and verifying every underlying assumption. They most likely procrastinated really hard and had around 10 if I had to guess. I bet 5 of them relied on empty-nothing burger promises being rolled out/executed properly by our model government, and the other 5 relied on faulty data from China\u2019s \u201cmiracle containment story\u201d or low number case behavior from role-model countries, Taiwan, South Korea, ect.. It ain\u2019t their first rodeo. We\u2019re the noobs this time, not them. Bad graphs are easy to make if you\u2019re allowed to make endless assumptions with little to no care. Good graphs are not, because you can\u2019t afford to. It\u2019s not their job to make good graphs. This *thing* will never be fully contained, no matter how much we test, without a vaccine. \n\nEnd of ultra speculative section. \n\n&gt;The graph was so bad I struggled to write this section. I could\u2019ve cleaned every up and made it sound nice. But I\u2019m honestly flabbergasted. I\u2019m incredulous. They can\u2019t be serious. Why am I taking something seriously that wasn't meant to be? This begs the question . . .\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWhen might these new models break?\n\n Watch how the peak forms and as it goes into the initial dropoff. If it\u2019s not a steep dropoff you can bet your asses they\u2019re going back to the drawing board soon. It\u2019s a weird getup where any changes especially near the top of the pyramid as it\u2019s coming downwards will only amplify the issues with these forecasts. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Actually none of anything above this section matters. It's the wrong frame of mind. But it makes good practice for myself.**\n\n&gt;Sorry to disappoint you. Well then that was a total waste of time wasn\u2019t it? Not really, but we shouldn\u2019t care have to care when forecasts turn sour because they don\u2019t matter anymore. These graphs are not meant to be accurate. I\u2019m sure that they\u2019re going to be making their moves well before this happens again. But it\u2019s an important exercise to see where they\u2019re at. It\u2019s an unspoken agreement between all the firms. They\u2019re buying time for *something*. Even if this was meant to be internal and passed around like hot cakes it\u2019s to make their average employees believe in the Cinderella story, that they\u2019re working for a better cause. But make no mistake, there\u2019s some super secret restricted model/predictions only seen by a couple higher-ups most likely. I\u2019m going to go out on a limb and guess here, but it\u2019s not going to be nearly as pretty. Or is there? No that can't possibly be!\n\nWe arrive then at the seemingly obvious conclusion:\n\n*The Fed/gov/banks must be conspiring against us. Their actions are dangerous to the American people.* But . . .\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**This conclusion can also be considered close-minded and should be relinquished in my opinion.**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI for one, am guilty guilty of thinking like this not to long ago-- actually when the fed announced they were going to buy junk bonds that was my initial reaction. But after looking back, reality is often much more elegant and not the least crude or brute-forced-- electrical engineers reading this will know exactly what I'm talking about. . . as will many others. So, why then? If. . .\n\nThey are not conspiring against anyone. Then. . .\n\nWhat are they buying time for?\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Absolutely nothing.** \n\n&gt;Sorry to disappoint you. A crash is detrimental to them too; especially after the restrictions put on banks after the last financial crisis. The fed, the gov, the shitty graphs, QE,  and every single god damn revision they've made to their economic forecasts. All of it is done to prevent panic, relax expectations, and shank the natural crash that would've otherwise occurred before it could run. They\u2019re doing their best to buy time and delay the downturn because that\u2019s all that they can do. There doesn\u2019t have to be a conspiracy theory. There doesn\u2019t have to be brilliant reason. Sometimes the best explanation is the most obvious one.\n\nFed buying anything and everything? They\u2019re trying to prevent certain firms, that are leveraged to the tits with junk, from blowing up and causing a chain reaction. In their view, that\u2019s the best way for them to protect the financial system and serve the American people. However, It also happens to be the easy way out, the other path less traveled, despite being the obvious choice to the rest of us, is unknown, uncertain, and untested. It\u2019s scary, and it should be; because it's never been done before. They\u2019re human too, and it\u2019s easier to make easy decisions as one (especially for a bunch of boomers).\n\n&gt; ok Boomer. And yes, to answer the obvious, they won't be held accountable because when it's our turn to deal with this shit they'll suddenly pretend be senile. *Go figure.*\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThen why did I say when we switched to these more drawn out forecasts it\u2019d matter?\n\nBecause it happens to cancel the U-V shaped recovery story or the virus \u201cmagically\u201d going away narrative currently being preached by the media. That\u2019s the only reason why I cared about this current revision. It's big. That's it. There is going to be a relatively large base case shift or fundamental change because of it. I don\u2019t think anybody should put in the mental effort to care about how firms make models and tweak them after they\u2019re finished switching and started publishing their \u201crevised\u201d bullshit this time around. That or I just like being lazy and ignoring things I don\u2019t think matter anymore or will soon become irrelevant. Either way, soon we can all forget about virus models/forecasts because they\u2019ll only be a worthless distraction and serve as comedic relief soon.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nHowever. Back to the current timeline. . .\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWhy does matter is that if these new models are getting passed around internally?\n\nIt means they will soon go for public release in a week or so. And we'll have our promised downturn. I hate shitty graphs.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**The concluding discussion:**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nBack to my favorite kind of speculation. \n\n&gt;I over-explained graphs that didn\u2019t mean anything in the first place. Then argued for a faulty statement. Kindof like yodeling in space. *Go figure.* \n\n&gt;To balance things out I\u2019m going to be concise about the next part which might be relevant.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nThe assumption I\u2019m making: **We won\u2019t breach next fib level.** If we do and don\u2019t get rejected immediately, please proceed to chuck everything I say here out the window. The market will have changed, and I will have had no idea what I\u2019m talking about and we should start to seriously consider buying precious metals.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n* Last week's rally was driven by both fundamental/technical factors but due to the ferocity of the rally we have since diverged, *bigly.*\n* Notice Monday: money was flooding into strong stocks like Amazon/Netflix/AMD ect.. but shit stocks like Ford/Airlines/Lyft were getting sucked dry. It would appear that MMs are currently positioning for some sort of broader downturn as we continue to go sideways but sorta upwards in the meantime. \n* If you think of TA as Sin(), and Fundamental as Cos(), I believe they\u2019re just about to close in on a point of maximum divergence soon.\n* What happens when they start converging again? idk. you tell me.\n* If you do TA yourself or follow any number of TA charters, one term that is currently being echoed is \u201cbeautiful TA\u201d Why is it considered beautiful? Why are the charts suddenly so clean and elegant? Why were the magic crayons swapped out for an artisan's brush?\n* Stubborn traders that only look at the fundamentals and complain about the divergence have become blind to a real beauty passing by on the other side. They will continue to lose in the coming weeks.\n* Last week a wet towel was wrung out once, it is customary to wring a towel a 2nd time to get the remaining water out.\n* For this reason we are most likely going to follow the TA and complete the ascending wedge for the rest of this week at least. This channel will most likely finish somewhat close to the next fib level.\n* My base case is an eventual slow, and drawn-out downturn for reasons highlighted in the useless chunks before this section. *It will not be easy to profit off of.* Don\u2019t be tricked: We may enter a downturn soon, but it will be one where Circuit-breakers will most likely be both sparse and scarce in between; likewise the same can be said about VIX spikes. We won\u2019t be seeing a lot of them anytime soon until a crash  occurs in one of the credit-markets in a couple of months. Meanwhile, if they are doing everything in their power to delay whatever they\u2019re trying to prevent, make no mistake, **it will be delayed.**\n* Prognosis for the next couple of weeks: Gay. 50 shades of it. The elevators are all broken but we might hop off some stairs a couple times; I still think it\u2019s going to be a delayed/drawn-out downturn regardless-- simply because that\u2019s what **they** are trying to do.\n* Try to daytrade. If you\u2019re long gamma look for short trades. Be a bandit. *Be like water.* Any positions (excluding LEAPS) held for more than a week is going to end up going belly up. \n\n&gt;**We're in a vast ocean, the ocean won't shed a tear when you lose all your investments. There is no such thing as easy money. Be safe in your trades and irl. GLHF**\n\nWith that being said, looking back I may sound like I'm against anyone betting on a big drop so i wanted to clarify:\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIf you see an opportunity for calls/puts, execute on your intuition. I don't intend to dissuade anyone from making money, but I implore you to have the time-frame in question well thought out ahead of time. There's going to be a lot bullshit happening in between lucrative+volatile time-frames during \"dry-out periods\". Don't be caught in one of these FOMOing. There's money to be made, but it's not going to be as no-brainer as mid-Feb to mid-March, because everybody is expecting it. That's the main purpose of this piece.",

        "selftext": "During the downturn I have turned $200 into $10,000 by swing trading short dated spy puts. During this bull rally I have been diamond handsing June SPY 220 puts and June VXX 55 calls. Through this rally, my once $10000 gains have turned into $5000. I've been able to mitigate the damage through AMD calls, CCL calls, USO calls, as well as calls on biotech companies.\n\nI have a thesis that the next market downturn will be caused by the housing market crashing and small businesses defaulting on loans along with low demand for goods within the economy. \n\nHowever, I am starting to doubt the downturn will come in time. I am worried hope combined with the economy reopening will delay a downturn until my positions expire worthless. For these reasons, I am considering just taking the money and running because I am tired of watching my tendies vanish before my eyes.\n\nI am not a rich man but 5k is not a big deal to me. I am willing to risk it all for the chance of turning it into a much larger amount, however, I am starting to doubt my bets. I would rather not lose all my tendies but at the same time I'm tempted to keep holding to gain them back (and possibly much more)\n\nFellow autists, what would you guys do if you were me? Should I just go #cashgang until bad news comes about and hop on it right away? Or should I keep my diamond hands going strong?\n\nIf you want proof let me know, I can post it easily but flexing tendies is not the purpose of this post.",

        "selftext": "Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/wallstreetbets. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning April 27th, 2020.\n\n# **Stocks face headwinds as investors look forward to a big earnings week, a Fed meeting and state reopenings  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/24/stocks-face-headwinds-as-investors-look-forward-to-a-big-earnings-week-a-fed-meeting-and-state-reopenings.html)**\n*****\n&gt; The stock market is struggling to make headway, as a big week of events rolls around, including a Federal Reserve meeting, the first look at post-shutdown economic growth and earnings from more than a fifth of the S&amp;P 500 companies.\n*****\n&gt; It\u2019s a busy week for earnings, and some of the biggest blue chips are likely to join the growing list of companies withdrawing guidance amid the uncertainty of how the coronavirus and shutdowns are impacting their business. Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Facebook, Boeing and McDonald\u2019s are among about 140 S&amp;P 500 companies reporting first quarter results.\n*****\n&gt; Investors will also be watching the progress of the reopening of business activity in some states, like Georgia, Texas, Oklahoma and South Carolina. At the same time, President Donald Trump said he may extend social distancing guidelines into early summer. Many states, including the hardest hit, remain completely shut down.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks were higher Friday, but the major indices had their first negative week in three as oil prices cratered and then steadied in the mid-teens. The S&amp;P 500 has been trading on both sides of the key 2,800 level, as investors focused on murky corporate outlooks and uncertainty surrounding the timing of the reopening of the economy. Even though several states are resuming some activities, Trump said he disagreed with Georgia\u2019s plan to reopen.\n*****\n&gt; On Friday, the S&amp;P closed at 2,836, down 1.3% for the week.\n*****\n&gt; Earnings for the first quarter have been bleak so far, down about 14% based on estimates and actual reports, according to Refinitiv. Second quarter results are expected to be far worse, declining 32.2%.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIf you take a look where the real battle is in the market, it\u2019s a fundamental story,\u201d said Jonathan Golub, chief U.S. equity strategist at Credit Suisse. \u201cThe fundamentals are that the market should be lower, and on the other hand, the Fed is kind of putting their thumb on the scale in favor of the market.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Golub said it\u2019s the potential for recurrences of the outbreak that\u2019s being watched to see if businesses can remain open once they start back up. \u201cPeople are watching what\u2019s going on in places like Georgia, but they\u2019re also watching what\u2019s going on in Singapore and places in Asia that are opening up,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the end of the day, there\u2019s really one thing that really matters. It\u2019s not the Fed. The virus is going to own the agenda, whether we want it to or not.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # Fed bazooka\n&gt; The Fed meets Tuesday and Wednesday, and while it\u2019s not expected to take any new action, it will likely discuss the many programs it quickly rolled out to support the economy and provide liquidity.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI\u2019m anticipating no actions in terms of anything with purchases or interest rate movements,\u201d said Luke Tilley, chief economist at Wilmington Trust. \u201cI think we\u2019re going to hear a lot more in terms of their description of what\u2019s working and the things that still need to happen.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Tilley said the Fed\u2019s job is also to instill confidence, and its asset purchase and other programs to support mortgages, corporate credit and municipal bonds, helped bring back in spreads that had been widening out across the credit markets. \u201cIt looked like we were headed for a seizure in credit markets, but they\u2019ve come back in,\u201d he said, adding he expects the Fed to also discuss programs like its support for the small business lending program.\n*****\n&gt; Fed Chairman Jerome Powell is also expected to sound optimistic about the central bank\u2019s ability to help the economy, despite the uncertainty as the economy falls into an unprecedented decline in the second quarter. Tilley said he expects the economy to contract in the second quarter by 40%.\n*****\n&gt; Golub said this Fed meeting isn\u2019t as important as others have been, since the central bank has already taken so many extraordinary policy steps and promises to do more as needed.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe Fed has made it clear if they need to provide liquidity to the market, they\u2019re not going to wait for a meeting to do it,\u201d he said. \u201cWhether you\u2019re borrowing from a bank or whether you\u2019re borrowing in the capital markets, that capital is available so the economy can move ... the net effect is it also pushes the stock market up.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # Economic impact\n&gt; First quarter gross domestic product numbers are expected Wednesday, and it will be the first look at how the early weeks of the shutdown impacted the broader economy. Forecasts are wide ranging, and the consensus forecast from Refinitiv is now for a contraction of 4.1%. Economists expect the second quarter to take the biggest hit of the recession, and it is forecast by many to show a contraction of more than 30%.\n*****\n&gt; Some of the early second-quarter data will be released in the coming week. Vehicle sales slowed to a trickle in April, and auto makers shut down production.\n*****\n&gt; The impact of that should show up in Friday\u2019s April vehicle sales and ISM manufacturing, but the single-most important data point will be Thursday\u2019s weekly jobless claims, expected again to show millions of workers signed up for unemployment benefits.\n*****\n&gt; So far, 26.5 million unemployment claims have been filed in the last five weeks, wiping out all the job gains made since the end of the Great Recession. The employment report for April will be released on May 8, and economists say unemployment will likely peak in April or May before falling off.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe\u2019ll probably see an unemployment rate at 20% or a little higher,\u201d Tilley said.\n*****\n&gt; # Earnings\n&gt; Earnings reports are expected from a range of industries, such as tech, health care, energy and defense. Merck, Pfizer, AstraZeneca, Humana and Anthem are among health care names reporting. Big oil companies, Exxon Mobil and Chevron both release results on Friday, and their comments on how they are reacting to the shocking decline in crude oil prices this past week will be important.\n*****\n&gt; An oil futures contract for May dove into negative territory Monday and Tuesday, as did prices in many spot markets. That contract expired Tuesday, and the June futures contract for West Texas Intermediate settled at $16.94 per barrel Friday, down about 7.3% for the week and about $5 lower than the price of Brent futures.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe most important earnings story is not what happens this quarter, It\u2019s how long does it take to get back to peak earnings again,\u201d said Golub. \u201cMy estimate is this is going to take three years to get back to peak profits. But the estimates right now are reflecting that it\u2019s going to turn back to normal by something closer to the third quarter of next year. I think that\u2019s too optimistic.The second part of the earnings story is how fast estimates are coming down.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; He said first quarter earnings per share look to be down a little more than 12%, though some estimates have them down 16% or 17%. \u201cWe had 10 very healthy weeks and three not healthy weeks. The fact you could have such a negative quarter with only three bad week, that\u2019s really bad.\u201d Golub said. His forecast is for a 40% decline in second quarter profits.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/3vJvFZR.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/B4Di7Fh.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/7XXBq3H.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/QyE3rll.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/jyp5KqQ.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/fCYKkgg.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/PdPKvec.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/sEY6EDm.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/KKMTHHH.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/y2laKRP.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/QuCVREP.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/gkpOUiT.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/GrUMf6m.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Election-year Mays: DJIA\u2019s Second Worst Month\n\n&gt; May officially marks the beginning of the \u201cWorst Six Months\u201d for the DJIA and S&amp;P. To wit: \u201cSell in May and go away.\u201d Our \u201cBest Six Months Switching Strategy,\u201d created in 1986, proves that there is merit to this old trader\u2019s tale. A hypothetical $10,000 investment in the DJIA compounded to a gain of $1,068,826 for November-April in 69 years compared to just $1,461 for May-October. The same hypothetical $10,000 investment in the S&amp;P 500 compounded to $823,326 for November-April in 69 years compared to a gain of just $9,537 for May-October.\n\n&gt; May has been a tricky month over the years, a well-deserved reputation following the May 6, 2010 \u201cflash crash\u201d. It used to be part of what we called the \u201cMay/June disaster area.\u201d From 1965 to 1984 the S&amp;P 500 was down during May fifteen out of twenty times. Then from 1985 through 1997 May was the best month, gaining ground every single year (13 straight gains) on the S&amp;P, up 3.3% on average with the DJIA falling once and two NASDAQ losses.\n\n&gt; In the years since 1997, May\u2019s performance has been erratic; DJIA up eleven times in the past twenty-two years (three of the years had gains in excess of 4%). NASDAQ suffered five May losses in a row from 1998-2001, down \u2013 11.9% in 2000, followed by twelve sizable gains in excess of 2.5% and five losses, the worst of which was 8.3% in 2010. Election Year Mays rank at or near the bottom, registering net losses on DJIA and S&amp;P 500 (since 1952), NASDAQ (since 1972) and Russell 1000 and 2000 (since 1980).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/fac23214c1353f0b68d7710f6f7886a1/2eed74513d6bc154-86/s400x600/2540f531fb63ceab611b44ad7e0a2c0165670319.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# LPL Office Talk: Putting The Rally In Perspective\n\n&gt; One month ago today the S&amp;P 500 Index bottomed after a vicious bear market. Was this the ultimate bottom? We\u2019ll have to wait and see, but what we do know is the rally we\u2019ve seen over the past month is nearly as historic as the drop coming into it was.\n\n&gt; \u201cWe recently had the best 20-day rally for the S&amp;P 500 since March 2009 and one of the best ever,\u201d explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cLooking back at the previous best 20-day rallies, one thing is consistent: very strong returns going out a year.\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the 10 previous best 20-day rallies for the S&amp;P 500 saw continued gains after some near-term volatility. In fact, six months later stocks were higher 9 of 10 times and a full year later higher 10 of 10 times.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Picture-4.23.20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# Why The Recent Strength Has Bulls Smiling\n\n&gt; The huge equity rally continued last week, with the S&amp;P 500 Index up another 3%, on the heels of adding more than 15% in the previous week. The gain during the past two weeks of 15.5% was the greatest since October 1974. Taking it a step further, the 15 trading days ending April 14 saw the S&amp;P 500 up more than 27%, one of the greatest rallies ever. What we\u2019ve been seeing is truly historic, so the big question now is: What could happen next?\n\n&gt; \u201cThis remarkable rally has caught most off guard, but what might surprise many to hear is more gains could eventually be in store in 2020,\u201d explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cWhen we\u2019ve seen similar blasts of extreme short-term strength, stocks have been quite strong going out 6- to 12-months.\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the S&amp;P 500 was up nine of 10 times six months later and higher every single time a year later after the previous best 15-day gains ever. Be aware though, some of the returns in the near-term were weak, suggesting a pullback after such a strong move is likely. Still, this much strength in such a short timeframe could very well suggest the rest of 2020 could have bulls smiling.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Market-returns-4.20.20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# Dogs of the Dow Performance So Far in 2020\n\n&gt; The average stock in the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 16.24% on a total return basis so far in 2020. Below we take a look at how the \"Dogs of the Dow\" strategy has performed so far this year.\n\n&gt; The \"Dogs of the Dow\" strategy is a very passive approach that simply says to buy the 10 stocks in the Dow 30 that have the highest dividend yields at the start of each year. The Dogs list for 2020 was led by Dow Inc. (DOW) with a yield of 5.12% on January 1st. Exxon Mobil (XOM), IBM, Verizon (VZ), Chevron (CVX), Pfizer (PFE), 3M (MMM), Walgreens (WBA), Cisco (CSCO), and Coca-Cola (KO) are the nine other members of the Dogs for 2020.\n\n&gt; As shown in the table below, the Dogs are down an average of 19.37% on a total return basis in 2020, which is a little less than five percentage points worse than the 14.68% decline seen for the 20 non-Dogs this year. Dow Inc. (DOW) and Exxon Mobil (XOM) have been the two worst performing Dogs with respective YTD declines of 39.9% and 37.0%. Dow's dividend yield has risen from 5.12% up to 8.47%, while XOM's yield has risen from 4.99% up to 7.91%. There are no Dogs that are up on the year, but Verizon (VZ) and Pfizer (PFE) have been the best performers of the group with YTD declines of less than 5%.\n\n&gt; Of the non-Dogs, Boeing (BA) has been by far the worst performer with a YTD decline of 60.01%. At the start of 2020, BA had a dividend yield of 2.52%, but that dividend has been suspended. JP Morgan (JPM), American Express (AXP) and Disney (DIS) have all fallen more than 30% YTD, while Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ), Walmart (WMT), and Microsoft (MSFT) are the only three Dow stocks that are up on the year.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/2020dogs.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Investors Giving Companies a Pass on Earnings So Far\n\n&gt; We're now two weeks into the Q1 2020 earnings season, and just over 200 companies have reported their numbers so far. The average one-day price change for the stocks that have reported earnings so far this season has been a gain of 0.89%. That's much stronger than the average one-day gain of 0.06% seen for all stocks that have reported earnings since 2001.\n\n&gt; As shown below, stocks that have beaten EPS estimates this season have averaged a one-day price gain of 2.16% on their earnings reaction days. That's stronger than the average one-day gain of 1.89% seen on earnings reaction days for all stocks that have reported since 2001. Stocks that have missed EPS estimates this season have seen a one-day decline of 0.72% on their earnings reaction days. Historically, the average stock that has missed EPS has fallen 3.56% on its earnings reaction day, so this season's decline of just 0.72% suggests that investors are basically giving a pass to companies missing estimates in Q1.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/avgearn.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Next Week's Economic Indicators\n\n&gt; Even though most economic data releases this week that had forecasts exceeded those estimates (10 of 15), data continues to come in very weak. The Chicago Fed\u2019s National Activity index started off the week coming in at \u20134.19 which was well below estimates of \u20133. Existing home sales followed up on Tuesday, and despite coming in above estimates, sales slowed considerably from February. Elsewhere in housing data, new home sales collapsed down to 627K SAAR compared to 765K last month. Meanwhile, February home prices showed some acceleration. Jobless claims also were better than expected, but they too remain at extremely elevated levels relative to the rest of history. Manufacturing data was a major area of weakness this week. Both the preliminary Markit PMI and Kansas City Fed reading fell significantly despite coming in better than forecast. Hard manufacturing data on Friday was likewise bad at the headline level though under the hood there were some silver linings.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/eco-1.png))**\n\n&gt; Turning to next week, like the earnings calendar, the economic calendar ramps up with a total of 34 releases. We will get the final two regional Federal Reserve indices from Dallas and Richmond on Monday and Tuesday, respectively, followed by the final Markit and ISM reading for April on Friday. Wednesday will be the most closely watched day of the week with the first release of Q1 GDP as well as an FOMC rate decision. Growth in the first quarter is expected to show a 3.8% contraction. Although no change in rates is being forecast, Fed Chair Powell\u2019s following presser will likely be closely watched for a monetary policy update.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/eco-2.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Biggest Companies Reporting Earnings Next Week (AAPL, AMZN, MSFT and More)\n\n&gt; The earnings calendar has begun to ramp up over the past two weeks and over the next two weeks we will see peak earnings season. Next week there are a total of 784 companies scheduled to release earnings. Of those, there are 178 S&amp;P 500 stocks, which is 35.% of the index.\n\n&gt; In the table below we show the 30 largest stocks (by market cap) that are scheduled to report next week. None of the largest stocks report on Monday, but the two Dow pharmaceutical stocks, Merck (MRK) and Pfizer (PFE), kick things off Tuesday morning. The trillion dollar market cap club will all report next week with Microsoft (MSFT) out with earnings Wednesday night and Apple (AAPL) and Amazon (AMZN) out the following evening. Two other notable releases Wednesday and Thursday, respectively, will be the major payment processors Visa (V) and Mastercard (MA). Friday will be capped off with two oil giants: Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX).

For that reason, a number of investors have been flocking to gold. Even before the COVID-19 crisis, gold prices had been in a solid uptrend, and while prices spiked as the crisis first began, they couldn't quite get above the $1,650 - $1,700 range. In mid-March even, prices plummeted with just about every other financial asset before quickly recovering. Once again, though, the rally stalled at resistance. This time around, though, the 50-day moving average was strong enough to provide support and after that test, gold finally got the long-awaited breakout that investors had been waiting for.\n\n&gt; Gold's price spiked as high as $1,787 per ounce in mid-April before running out of momentum. When a stock or commodity breaks out above resistance to new highs and then pulls back, the former resistance level should act as support, and that is exactly what we saw this time around. This week, gold bounced right on cue at around $1,700 and has since rallied 2.6%. With the first test of support proving successful, look for gold to now establish a new range with a floor at around $1,700. At least that's what the technical analysis textbooks would say.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/04/042320-Gold.png))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$AMZN** \n&gt; * **$TSLA** \n&gt; * **$MSFT** \n&gt; * **$AAPL** \n&gt; * **$AMD** \n&gt; * **$BA** \n&gt; * **$FB** \n&gt; * **$LUV** \n&gt; * **$MMM** \n&gt; * **$GE** \n&gt; * **$AAL** \n&gt; * **$UPS** \n&gt; * **$TWTR** \n&gt; * **$PFE** \n&gt; * **$CBSH** \n&gt; * **$PEP** \n&gt; * **$MA** \n&gt; * **$GOOGL** \n&gt; * **$GILD** \n&gt; * **$SBUX** \n&gt; * **$UAL** \n&gt; * **$V** \n&gt; * **$SPOT** \n&gt; * **$MCD** \n&gt; * **$XOM** \n&gt; * **$F** \n&gt; * **$CAT** \n&gt; * **$TDOC** \n&gt; * **$AMAT** \n&gt; * **$AWI** \n&gt; * **$CHKP** \n&gt; * **$MRK** \n&gt; * **$ABBV** \n&gt; * **$WHR** \n&gt; * **$QCOM** \n&gt; * **$BP** \n&gt; * **$KHC** \n&gt; * **$CLX** \n&gt; * **$HAS** \n&gt; * **$ANTM** \n&gt; * **$NOK** \n&gt; * **$CMS** \n&gt; * **$CNX** \n&gt; * **$APRN**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/KKMTHHH.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/lRp3xer.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE MONDAY'S OPEN!](https://i.imgur.com/Yw1LKpH.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 4.27.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/HW4ersg.png))\n\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 4.27.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/KnhCH1m.png))\n\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 4.28.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/XeUrTNF.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 4.28.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/20sK5un.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/QXrGzmn.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 4.29.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/tSP1S0Y.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/Sn4QllI.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 4.29.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/DhxQrOU.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/1CpjzdJ.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 4.30.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/raeflTF.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/43jb0Pu.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 4.30.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/axhdXpO.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/wiL7F9e.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 5.1.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/HZkJ2ai.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 5.1.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Amazon.com, Inc. -\n&gt; **Amazon.com, Inc.

        "selftext": "Apparently I've gained a bit of a reputation on here.  If you don't know, I predicted a 9% spike in AAPL, the 3 month spike in AMD, the AMZN surge a while back, and most notably the options prediction of ATVI, where I netted people, and myself over 100%.  A lot of A companies I notice, but here's my DD for today.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**DIS 5/15 $105 Call**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's why I'm recommending this, if you wanna hear my backing.  Walt Disney is one of the biggest companies in the world.  To put this into perspective, they own ABC, Fox, FX, Disney, ESPN, Marvel, Pixar, Hulu, and a ton more.  **The main things of this DD are Disney+, their upcoming EPS, and how they're undervalued during this coronavirus.**  First of all, Disney+.  Disney+ has been booming in numbers, before the coronavirus, and with the virus added on, it is literally exploding.  Along with its other subsidiaries, Disney is one of the only companies in a better position because of this virus.  Yet they lost 31% due to the virus.  They should have benefitted.  The beautiful thing is (my second point), their EPS is coming up on May 6th.  3 out of the 4 of Disney's EPS's over the past year have had a positive suprise, and this one will obviously have a huge one as well.  Zacks estimates that they will have an EPS suprise of 14.7%, I believe it will be a lot more.  And finally, combining all of this, they should really be up 30% instead of down, and this upcoming EPS will prove that, and I believe the week after their EPS will be as green as the Rockefeller Christmas tree.  I'm getting excited just writing about this.  This is no joke, seriously, don't know how I can be more serious, the best opportunity I have seen in my life.  Trust me, and buy a new car later.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy reasoning for 5/15, is I want to not only capitalize off of the immediate response to the EPS release, but also the week after, as I believe the market will take time to realize that it made a mistake about Disney.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**I picked $105 just to be super safe, but a $110 or $115 isn't a ridiculous target.  I will see you guys on the moon.**",

        "selftext": "My last post seemed to be quite well received, in it I discussed macro-principles which we are currently tasked with as an economy while bringing some technical analysis to the table as a means to share my analysis/what I'm considering as PT's for long term investing entries; today I'm simply sharing an update on findings &amp; what I believe to be a major tipping point in market movement moving forward. \\* Quick Disclaimer: No, I'm not here to act high and mighty or be crowned a fortune teller, nor am I 'making a killing' lol; movements had been forgiving up until Friday, got caught being greedy &amp; lackadaisically overconfident on someone else's analysis rather than staying hedged\\*\n\nFor those that didn't catch my last post - [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/fvjlin/economic_stagnation_financial_corruption_dying/). I brought into perspective what I believe to be many of the ways as to 'how' our markets have been propped up/inflated \\[while also highlighting some of what I believed to be key indicators in continuation of the rally that would leave many bears/greedy traders getting burned - ironically as I write this, even me\\] While also shedding light on how I believe the integrity of these means to inflating the markets would give way/lead to the continuation of sell offs to at least retest lows or visit even lower lows in the near future. \\*Yes I believe the Fed will continue intervention, but to the extent which prevents our markets from totally losing their value (which was at risk for awhile in March.) but, do I also believe that this can again reach a rate that is beyond their control/brings about a 'fire sale'? Certainly\\*\n\nFundamentals aside; I'll jump into technical's starting with the strongest tickers, ones within the NASDAQ - [NVDA](https://gyazo.com/a76ab526020ac4f08ee16f53a7e52117). Early in February NVDA hit LT resistance before tumbling down, being a tech company &amp; 'safe haven' withing the NASDAQ,  it was instantly getting bought up &amp; formed a 'bullish' support on its uptrend line (like many of the other tech stocks/ semi-conductors.) However, a bounce like this has simply created more momentum for the downside, in the current economic climate and how uncertain investors are, any panicked would send stock prices tumbling in the event of further liquidity issues/continued uncertainty of business growth as ER's are reported &amp; guidelines are disbanded. (Opening potential to revisit the lows being tested in 2018; perhaps even as low as their highs in 2000 - $80 for NVDA specifically.)\n\nOne of the most influential indicators of the markets current direction imo, financials, more specifically [JPM](https://gyazo.com/c175725b089868cb777764d60fc3ad80). Eager bulls have been getting trapped the entire way down since the descent began in late February, and even this 'uptrend' is looking WEAK. The blue line of LT support, again coincides with the breakout level of 2016 (If someone were truly bullish on the economy &amp; believed this pandemic is 'over-hyped', this most likely would've been their PT of entry.) JPM/Financials is also one of the few sectors which is clearly displaying a bear flag, opposed to the descending triangles/rising wedges seen across the other markets. To even humor the bulls, I've drawn a channel of the current 'uptrend,' However, the sell off's following the egregious ER from JPM had pushed it totally out of this trend channel (a sell signal) &amp; Friday ended with a back-test of this trend line, what I believe to be the last chance for bulls to sell out with a minimized loss/profits for en-entry at these lower PT's. Fair value on JPM, lay between $65-75; I don't believe we see the true market recovery until these at least some of these fair market values are hit. (Mind you, EPS was missed by -57% on JPM, meaning that on rudimentary calculation alone with their updated projections, Yearly EPSxPE = 'Fair Price,' \\~5.4 x 8.77 = $47.5) Yes this is offset by the 'ability to recover,' but would the majority of top tier investors seriously be inclined to pay double at the current share price in hopes that maybe in 2-3 years they'll be back to where they once were? It's an extremely uphill battle that I can't imagine any firm or investor would seriously put money into at these current valuations.\n\n\\- **BUT THE FED IS BUYING EVERYTHING YOU AUTIST.** Well, yeah they're currently repurchasing securities/debts in efforts to stabilize the markets, which they have done effectively at this point. But in order for the markets to stay 'stable,' this hail mary of a Prayer from Prez would actually have to come true (Opening economy May 1st, 'going back to normal.') &amp; somehow would have to continually reassure investors during these next weeks of shit ER's that \"it's just a blip.\" I personally believe smart money is still waiting for that sale, and those investors are going to be pumping in WAY more money to stabilize the markets after they've been enticed with true 'fire-sale' prices, much more so than the sheep/retail investors &amp; ST pumpers buying up the bear rally up until this point. (Which, in my opinion will coincide almost exactly with the time that the general public finally wakes up to realize that everything isn't going to just return to normal at the drop of a hat. \\~May/June.)\n\nNext I move to [BA](https://gyazo.com/8474bbe8ddd1902b74b89cad987581b2), a 'strong company' within the Dow Jones &amp; played a heavy roll in the rally of the Dow on Friday. Supports/Resistances - The Orange line is representative of LT resistance on Boeing at the $154 mark (this was the resistance broken which resulted in a parabolic move by BA - the move which resulted in almost tripling their share price during the months/years to follow.) Blue is 'bullish' support around the breakout level of mid-2013, and off screen I have a lower support at $70 - representative of their high in 2000 &amp; the first breakout point following the 2009 GFC in early 2012. The Descending Triangle/ rising wedge/bear flag (otherwise known as a 'bear pull-back') - Clear as day on daily, hourly, and even weekly charts &amp; Friday's close has put Boeing at SUCH a key spot, closed AH just below that 154 resistance line and fully completed it's 5th trajectory within the wedge/triangle. Typically, after the completion of a formation like this, the next move will be very powerful (as its been building momentum while bouncing up and down - imagine compressing a spring &amp; releasing it.) That said, based on financial situation &amp; the future prospects of BA, I would put their fair value price at $70 and if I were interested in investing in BA long term currently, I'd be waiting patiently for a light load at $100 &amp; adding more aggressively as the price draws closer to $70. A quick note on '[proof](https://gyazo.com/bdf7f172dbeb29c088873befcecae2ea)' of this over-valuation. BA was trading at about \\~$50 range during 2005, revenues were approx 50 Million; peak revenues were achieved in 2017-18 (\\~100 Million, double the revenues seen in 2005) yet BA managed to trade at a high of $445? Cut and dry, Boeing hasn't become that much more of a profitable company; surely not enough for serious investors to even considering buying in while the price was so inflated from 2016-2020. However, this begins to expand on a greater underlying effect on these prices; and the fact that the market is no longer only driven by ER's &amp; future projections, but that it more commonly reflects our economy (or the consumers perception of our economy) more than ever. Simply put, Americans hear trump talk about never letting Boeing fail/ \"how great Boeing is for our economy, we need to make more jobs,\" and all these damn sheep buy in, driving up the price.. Now is an investor that got in early going to complain about this? Absolutely not, they're gonna ride the wave and make fkin LOOT on the silly sheep driving the price up to kingdom-come. Now the same is true as they exit their positions, this ENTIRE week Boeing saw negative net flow from large-scale orders; firms/smart money/etc selling off to the sheep willing to still pay for an inflated price tag, just like we watched happen in 2008...\n\nAnother Example - [LYV](https://gyazo.com/f225f80c63ea2f353eb1d9768f9f5a19). Live Nations Entertainment (Company which hosts music shows/festivals/etc), this company's performance is dependent on consumer spending, and IMO is one of the best reflections of the bull trap playing out in the markets currently. $30 support coincides with the breakout level which was finally crossed in 2016, again; meaning, any perma-bulls that don't believe our economic impact will be very significant at all would've been scooping shares here (and even traders which have been deep diving on TA &amp; saw this key support area being approached, knowing the resulting bounce very well could create FOMO &amp; a nice return during the early stage of the rally.) Consumer spending is going to be demolished, and any investor (outside of sheep that have attended a live nation show &amp; think 'Oh it'd be cool to own them, it was just at a high of $70/share, I wanna go to a concert when this quarantine is over, surely they'll bounce back') know this &amp; that their outlook for the upcoming year is TERRIBLE. Live nations is about to lose a FUCK load of money, and the gov't sure as hell isn't backing that; what happens when they cancel shows &amp; cannot refund their consumers? The outlook is one I cannot see any sane firm/investor touching with a ten foot poll right now.\n\nThe plat de r\u00e9sistance, [SPY](https://gyazo.com/854bb2b1bd62fdd1e490759209f91dfa). Does it surprise me that this week was a another green week following, \"the greatest market comeback since 1934.\" as claimed by news &amp; DT himself? Not at all. Rising wedge, 5th bounce hit and rejected resistance of 288.5 today, this is what I view as the tipping point, rejecting that resistance was absolutely massive &amp; unless Monday comes around with a gap up from the futures, I believe the highs of this rally are in.\n\nTLDR; The markets are at their tipping point, I believe we begin to slow bleed or enter phase two of the blood bath following Friday's rejection of 288.5 (For MANY stocks, this equated to a back-test of their 'uptrends' and a 5th bounce within their Descending Triangles/Rising wedges.) as we enter the next next week. Current Positions- BA $120p May 15th, LYV $25p May 15 Put, AMD $45p June, &amp; NVDA $200p June 2020 Put",

        "selftext": "Advanced Micro Devices is likely to post strong results when the company announces first-quarter earnings after the close of trading on Tuesday.\n\nFor the quarter, the company (ticker: AMD) previously projected revenue of $1.8 billion, up 42% from a year ago. The consensus among Wall Street analysts calls for $1.78 billion in revenue and profits of 18 cents a share.\n\nAMD rival\u2019s Intel (INTC) last week reported better-than-expected March quarter results, driven by strength in both the personal-computer and cloud-server sectors. The memory-chip producer Micron Technology (MU) likewise recently reported strong results, driven by both PC and server demand.\n\nIn Intel\u2019s case, investors had a mixed reaction to the news, largely because of concerns about the outlook. Intel withdrew its previous financial forecasts for the full year, citing uncertainties tied to the Covid-19 pandemic and the associated financial downturn. Intel also cautioned that tailwinds boosting sales of PCs and servers in the first quarter were likely to fade in the second half of the year, due in part to a likely slowing of corporate spending.\n\nOne key question will be whether AMD maintains its current forecast for revenue for the full year, which calls revenue growth of 28%-30%. The Wall Street consensus, for $8.6 billion in sales, implies growth of 27.7%, slightly below the target range\n\nFor the second quarter, the consensus view is that revenue will total $1.92 billion and that per-share earnings will be 21 cents.\n\nhttps://www.barrons.com/articles/amd-reports-earnings-tuesday-heres-what-to-expect-51588019021",

        "selftext": "Hi y\u2019all.\n\nSo right now.. wrote a sell order for 40 $57.5 AMD 4/17 to lock in profit for my current 40 $56 AMD 4/17 as I have no day trades. No risk here, I just have to wait to close both tomorrow? Even if AMD dropped to, say, $49? Doesn\u2019t matter how the market moves, yes?\n\nI sell them one immediately after the other tomorrow. I\u2019m in RH, any tips for avoiding risk during this close out process in the spread?\n\nI will be sure to close both tomorrow. In that context, I would:\n\nAMD $56c 4/17 (original call):\nSell to close at whatever was the highest premium tomorrow, like normal. whatever suits my fancy.\n\nImmediately 40 AMD $57.5 4/17 (spread call):\nBuy all 40 contracts.\n\nBoom. Done. My question is.. in the mean time. What\u2019s the gap? People made it out like this secured all gains.. but doesn\u2019t it only secure the higher strikes premium price (at point of \u201clock-in\u201d) worth of gains? The rest in the gap between my original call premium is mine to gain or lose.. I just want to sell at highest point tomorrow like normal?\n\nI still see money moving in my investing balance, that\u2019s simply the margin between the higher strike and the smaller strike? And that\u2019s just tough luck, you can only mitigate so much risk? But the new $1600 in buying power is the locked away, secured gains.\n\nSorry for the q\u2019s, been trying to research writing options in this context!",

When choosing stocks how do you decided which to sell CC on. For example would selling calls on AMD which is a volatile, high premium option chain be a smart idea or would that be too volatile to be a reliable strategy. Would less volatile stocks like T be a better option even with the lower premiums? Or do you guys find ETFs to be better for selling CCs. I also would like to hear how far out you sell CC and if you go ITM or OTM and how far into or out of the money. \n\nAppreciate the help and looking forward to hearing what you guys have to say!",

        "selftext": "Some points I am thinking about....\n\n\\- AMD currently has a P/E ratio of 161.27. This is ridiculously high and easy to label as overpriced. However, their earnings are being utilized towards captial investments (growth in their lineup) which is an explanation for a high P/E but not necessarily a \"bad\" stock \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- I am not a big gamer, but from taking a poll of approximately 100 gamers (I know not a lot) the big consensus is that they have high performing products that is significantly cheaper than its competitors (INTEL). This is great for now, but I take this as a subjective measure of potential growth. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- Their financials IMO are not bad. They have a great steady growth, and I have some positions at $10. However, I see a lot of arguments saying their fair value is like $20. What is that? I know what a fair value is, but how are people speculating this value without any backup? I feel like people are throwing a lot of prices of what they think is fair but not giving much information. I can guess they are just seeing the P/E ratio and just cutting the current value of the stock by some mentally established value.\n\n\\- As meme stock as it is, this was the same mindset when this stock was in the low 10ish. Then it shot up like crazy in the last few years. Why? I speculate it is because AMD is strongly based on the growth potential and opinion of the users rather than their financially evaluated value. \n\nAll that said, I see them as speculative growth in the future and customer based. Going off of these indicators, I don't see anything that debases or devalues their speculative growth or their customer base! I feel bullish on AMD. \n\nI am no professional in any capacity. Just calling it from how I see it based on my own research. I'd appreciate constructive input.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDisclaimer: This would be a part of my fun portfolio (10% of all my holdings is my fun portfoilio and I plan to make AMD 20 percent of that at my next dip opportunity). I anticipate  my next buying opportunity after Q1 earnings on May 5th.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlright, have a good day and wash your hands.",

Any number below 5M is just not realistic. The joblessness claims numbers are going to break 5.5 million.\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Iftu0ShgsMD74uWLVXcuY75h2o_YY4bD7cZnhHPrJK8/edit?usp=drivesdk\n\nI've spent the last week tracking down local news coverage of governors and state officials letting the upcoming jobless claims numbers slip into their press briefings. I've gotten actual numbers for 16 states. These jobless numbers are anywhere from 5.2M to 7M... this week. Any estimate below 5M is just lazy fucking guessing. \n\nThe best state number is Minnesota, with only a 3% increase from the previous week. Hawaii is the worst, with an 1100% increase (although thats an outlier). Many states will be near or exceed a 500% increase (AL, CA, CT, CO). I'm estimating (on the low side) that CA is about to report 1.1M losses.\n\nGoing through the other states news reports where i couldn't get a hard claims number, most are still reporting people are completely unable to get through (meaning many will still be unaccounted for this week). Most states are increasing employment of there unemployment claims officers by anywhere from 30% to 2x (ive forgotten which ones, i didnt save those links).\n\nEstimating the other 34 states, if i live i fucking dream land where everything is rosy and the world isn't on fire I could say a 20% increase from the previous weeks numbers is fair. On the high end maybe its a 300% increase (very unlikely on all 34 states)\n\nOhio, Texas, Massachusetts, and some others are particularly large wild cards in my estimates.\n\nThis gives a range of 5.2M on the low and 7.8M on the high end.... Now... These numbers may include revisions to the previous week. So what im saying is, if the reported number this week is 4.2M, then i expect revisions to the previous report to account for that missing million. But overall, newly reported losses will be  anywhere from 5.5-7.5M\n\nThat being said. I actually want to estimate it closer to 8 or 9 million, given that most states simply aren't keeping up with the call volume. But that's the wild card in the estimate.\n\nNext week i expect at least an additional 20% increase. This is due to many states:\n\n* Relaxing rules allowing 1099 and gig workers to file starting this week\n* Increased capacity unemployment offices to field more claims and wittle down the backlog\n* Big retailer layoffs from Macys, Kohls, JCP, Gap, etc... wont show up until next week\n\nSPY 303P 4/24, SPY 300P 5/15, SPY 240 mid June, adding more puts and probably some AMD iron condors today",

Holding 260 shares of MSFT until I meet WSB you autists. During that time the market was not performing well and I lost around 5k. (50k -&gt; 45k)\n\nYes I discovered WSB on March 13th, which made me immediately changed into \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b. I was dumb AF and yolo'ed all in SPY puts 03/16 (!) exp. I honestly did not understand what options are at all. Those options were bought right before Trump's pump, so my portfolio stay at 10k for the whole weekend, which freaked myself out. But extreme luck brought in the circuit breaker and I got a fat gainz of 30k. First one is free I guess? (45k -&gt; 10k -&gt; 80k)\n\nAfter that I started familiarized with the market, but I still have a lot to learn. In the next month or so, I generally bought puts and day trade only. I cashed out my starting 50k and had fun with my gainz. I was still somehow able to maintain my total portfolio value around 80k - 50k = 30k. My all time high was 32k, which is really not a lot of gainz after the first one.\n\nThis week is the most important week, since it is the tech earnings. I got AMD, APRN, MSFT, FB, AAPL, AMZN, all calls. Among those calls, FB I had least amount (oops), which was supposed to be the biggest winner of all. Everything else was either lost or theta ganged. Tomorrow will be a disaster, and it will trigger my max loss, so I will be outta here. Only able to secure 10k gainz in the past months, but I would rather take that as half full than half empty.\n\nBefore I go, I will YOLO everything else into SPY puts with a June exp date.\n\nNotable gains/losses:\n\n* 03/13 - 03/16 SPY puts (+30k)\n* 03/20 - 04/06 SPY puts (-7k)\n* 04/06 - 04/07 SPY calls (+12k)\n* 04/10 - ongoing PLAY $5 puts (-4.5k) super fat finger\n* 04/10 - 04/29 AMC $5 calls (+4k) penny calls\n* 04/27 - 04/28 AMD &amp; APRN calls (-3k)\n* 04/29 - 04/30 SPY calls (-2k)\n* 04/30 - 05/01 AMZN &amp; AAPL calls (-?k) disastrous\n\nStill holding:\n\n* ZNGA $8c 05/15 &amp; $10c 06/19\n* CCJ $12c 06/19\n\nTomorrow:\n\n* SPY whatever puts\n\nHave to admit, I totally stressed myself out during the time trading. I have to wake up extra early since I live in the west coast. Not really worth it.\n\n**TL;DR**: Dumb af and yolo'ed SPY puts with 1 day exp on Trump pump day, fat gainz. Then lost half during tech earning week by bad luck. Cashed out, and yolo the rest into puts tomorrow.\n\n[See you again](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgKAFK5djSk) soon. Long live all bears.",

        "selftext": "Hello Ladies &amp; Gents,\n\nThe market has truly been something over the past month and a half and seems to be riding on emotions and other plays rather so than fundamentals, even though market usually tends to be forward looking. Back in early March, I did my research and decided on a portfolio of stocks to go with as I believe in their growth. As is, I decided to play it out over time and DCA whenever it hits lows. So as search, I\u2019ve only been able to deploy only about 10-15% of my cash so far and only have a few shares of some stocks. I\u2019m glad it\u2019s been going up, but now what should I do? I keep waiting and it keeps going up and it becomes further and further away from the targets I really wanted. I still think there is still some downs to come, but not sure if   It will go back to those same levels. So far my portfolio is as below:\n\n3 shares MSFT @ $136.90\n2 shares AAPL @ $239\n1 share TSLA @ $478\n10 shares AMD @ $37.70\n5 shares DIS @ 93\n3 shares SQ @ $43\n6 shares V @ $151\n25 shares AC.TO @ $15.35\n3 shares TD.TO @ $54\n11 shares RBC.TO @ $92\n30 shares DEAC @ $16.60\n25 shares ENPH @ $36.62 \n\nI\u2019m looking to add specifically more of the first 7 stocks, not sure what to do at this point. I\u2019m glad I was able to get in at least at the lows but just not enough because of my plan to DCA, and just waited and waited.",
