        "selftext": "I initially wanted to short the company, because fuck GameStop, right?  After some review though, I'm actually thinking that buying calls is the better play for 2020.  I know you're thinking it's retarded, and it probably is, but hear me out.\n\nThesis:\n\n* Selling has been over-done as it is now trading below book value.  Book value per share \\~$9 and market cap is under $300M for a company that made over $7B in revenue over the past 12 months.  Granted, their current business model is dying but bankruptcy doesn't seem likely in the near-term,  like many investors seem to be banking on, especially with the PS5 and Xbox2 consoles being released later this year.  Also, see next bullet.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Though Moody's downgraded their debt in January, they upgraded their outlook from negative to stable, citing their good liquidity profile among other things ([Source](https://www.moodys.com/research/Moodys-downgrades-GameStops-CFR-to-B2--PR_417805?WT.mc_id=AM%7eWWFob29fRmluYW5jZV9TQl9SYXRpbmcgTmV3c19BbGxfRW5n%7e20200130_PR_417805&amp;yptr=yahoo)).   The fact of the matter is, the company is still relatively stable from a balance sheet perspective.  They still have an opportunity to right the ship if they play their cards right and switch up their business model as they say they are.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Short interest over 100%.  High potential for short squeeze.  It would just take one piece of positive news.  For example, if they were to close the poor performing stores, they could report a better than expected same-store sales next earnings.  Don't believe me?  The dumpster fire company Sears' reported increased same-store sales in their 2018 Q3 earnings ([Source](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/12/14/shoppers-return-to-liquidating-sears-stores-boost-same-store-sales.html?__source=twitter%7Cmain)), which sent the stock price up like 20% if I remember correctly due to the short squeeze.  It was a slightly misleading stat as the company was still destined for bankruptcy at that point, but it was enough for investors to find hope.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* The company's near-term future is dependent largely on the upcoming PS5 and Xbox2 releases.   \n The company is expecting sales to increase significantly with their releases and I don't think that is priced in yet mostly because neither console has an official release date set yet.  At the moment, both have been confirmed by Sony and Microsoft to be released in time for the holiday 2020 season.  If either company announces an official release date, that should give investors more confidence in GameStops' future sales/earnings and potentially leading to a short squeeze.\n   * Supposedly, Sony is said to have an event in March, with press invites potentially going out in late February, that could be when they provide more details and dates ([Source](https://bgr.com/2020/02/04/ps5-release-date-announcement-event-scheduled-for-march/)).\n\nI'm thinking June/July 2020 $4.5 or $5 calls to allow time for news to come out.  I'm not really interested in GameStop long term, but I think it's under-valued at the moment.  Thoughts?",

But with the brand new consoles coming out this holiday season it almost seems obvious to buy at this low of a price.  If you take a look at the charts GameStop has peaked the last two console releases. Let me know your thoughts.",

        "selftext": "GameStop (GME) has structured its financials and equity to tank losses quarter after quarter with its sizable cash position until Q4 FY20 when the new PS5 and Xbox release is projected to give the company a breadth of profitability. Although the new consoles have not hit assembly lines yet, the coronavirus situation has severely hampered Chinese manufacturing capacity. With total dependency on success this holiday season, a delay on the next gen consoles would likely spell the end of the video game retailer.\n\n* Apple's iphone production is expected to take a hit as Foxconn temporarily shuts down^[1](https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/4/21122081/foxconn-coronavirus-close-factories-big-tech)\n\n* Facebook no longer taking orders for the oculus quest citing manufacturing delays^[2](https://www.androidcentral.com/oculus-quest-production-will-be-impacted-novel-coronavirus)\n\n* Korean companies have been forced to halt activity as materials run low^[3](http://english.hani.co.kr/arti/english_edition/e_international/926742.html)\n\nGME's stock price is currently sitting at 3.81, the lowest its been this year. While long term prospects run low, there is a high likelihood of stock price recovery in Q4 if the company manages to release positive earnings. With the situation in China, that probability is now lower than ever.",
