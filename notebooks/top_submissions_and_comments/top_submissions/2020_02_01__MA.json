However, DBX does sport one of the lowest PE ratios within the sector, leading to some value buyers eyeing the stock. DBX is somewhere in the muddy waters between Growth and Fundamental, and this can lead to some outsized price action.\n\n**Technical**: Priced above in 20, 50 day moving averages, below 200 day MA.  MACD shows neutral convergence. RSI shows around 55, slightly above neutral. Options sentiments are bearish in volume and neutral open interest. Implied movement of about 12.3% or 2.27$.\n\n**Sentimental**: Dropbox recently released its new product end of last quarter. This new product aims to smooth over some of Dropbox\u2019s lagging technology and services. While a revenue re-acceleration was started last quarter, the increased cost on marketing, sales, and transition may affect earnings perception. Dropbox has a history of beating earnings; it also has a history of sliding after earnings. **This one is quite risky, and a bullish call is considered contrarian**. \n\n**ROI: 28%, 300%**\n\n**Risk Level: 5 out of 5, 50/50**  \n**I suggest the put credit spread. This overall play is much more risky, but also a very interesting case of growth vs fundamentals.**  \n\n[https://imgur.com/0BHsZem](https://imgur.com/0BHsZem) \\- put credit spread  \n [https://imgur.com/a/jViR0pz](https://imgur.com/a/jViR0pz)  \\- call debit spread\n\nIt's probably better to watch.

        "selftext": "Hey guys, my name is Victor and I study engineering. I know a lot about gambling because i've been playing poker as a side income for the past five year. After reading WSB for a year I essentially switched from hard liquor to krokodil and opened a brokerage account a month ago.\n\nI've come to realize that, just like poker, trading FDs is very hard to learn because you can get punished for your good decision and, worst of all, you can get rewarded for bad plays.\n\nI made some money playing $PTON and i'd like to get you guys opinion on my thought process. Thanks!\n\nMy goal was to swing trade using RSI. Since stock used to only go up, I wanted an oversold stock that had an history of hitting overbought RSI and sell once it went back to that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI settled on $PTON because it was a retard meme strenght that was heavily shilled by /u/MikeThePutz*.* It's 1h graph took about 10 day on average to swing so I took an ITM 2/28 27c at around 27.75$ on feb 7.\n\nI knew I needed an exit strategy, so I decided i'd give up if RSI dipped back into oversold. I didn't stick to that plan because it felt wrong to sell after it hit a bottom but I think this is a big problem in my strategy I need to fix.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3z1daq8xejj41.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4fb4da552d5d6777561eb3e6a25602d0e0cc3ecb\n\nIt's really a miracle that I was able to get away with it since the big rally it had in the last few day happened while the market suffered an huge correction. I think the reason is that the lockup ending on feb 24th was overanticipated and it was a real surprise when it didn't go to shit. [There is also another retarded reason given](https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/peloton-could-see-bump-home-201420811.html)\n\nI really don't think it make sense but I read in a bunch of place PTON was a coronavirus play.\n\nSince it was now overbought, and because people dont buy bike during the apocalypse, I immediatly bought a 27put for 3/20 expecting a pullback from the \\~8% gain day. I didn't intend on holding this puts for long considering how great the last few days were and I'm really unsure about expiry date. Once again, no real exit plan :X. My plan was to sell when 5 minute RSI went to oversold but it didn't happen and I got stuck holding overnight.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCorona finally caught up today and i'm pretty proud to say I sold pretty much at the bottom. I decide to sell when it crossed 27 (a price it spent a lot of time on the last few day) and started to finally face some resistance. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f24drw5dfjj41.png?width=1026&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c57316910880b52bf8c94dba10799fd6f372ba86\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI once again bought a call once again because I felt such an hard drill had to be followed by a rebound, and I sold a few moment later because it was going sideways and it crossed down the 25 MA. Really not sure about this I felt like my plan wasn't really solid and I sold because I didn't have an opinion on the future direction of the stock.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, i'd like a number 9 with a large fry.",

Etsy is a niche market with a strong brand. This makes them a very attractive target for acquisition. Etsy has also been consistently profitable, though there were some margin and revenue contractions in the past.

LYFT, +6.81% are up nearly 7% in Monday trading after a Northcoast Research analyst upgraded the stock to buy from neutral. Northcoast's John Healy is encouraged by the latest results from Uber Technologies Inc. UBER, -0.41%, which suggest to him that \"competitive dynamics and unit economics of the 'ride business' are sound.\" His survey work also indicates that Lyft's \"competitive position\" is improving, meaning that the company could be picking up share. Finally, Healy floated the possibility that Lyft \"could be increasingly active from an M&amp;A standpoint\" as the race for autonomous-driving technologies heats up. Lyft is due to report quarterly results after Tuesday's closing bell.

For a guy like me trying to build my small account up it seems smart to call spreads with this. An example I have is I buy a 2/28 $335 Call and sell 2/28 $340. In order to obtain max profit, MasterCard would just have to trade sideways or slightly up. So by 2/28 if $MA is still $340 I get $165. In order for me to lose my max loss $335, it would have to expire $336 or less. Which is unlikely. I\u2019m just trying to get some insight on this.

        "selftext": "Hi Everyone!  Would you be able to review my notes below regarding my current (and past trades) to see whether my reasoning makes sense ?  I started trading options two weeks ago.  Regarding education, I've read Charting &amp; Technical Analysis by Fred McAllen, watched YouTube videos from Project Options (and some others), and am currently reading through info at the Options Playbook website.  \n\n**CURRENT TRADE:**  \n\nPurchased ARKK - 10 contracts at 0.35 for the 6/19 call.  \n\nThe total spent was $350.  I wrote the excerpt below in my trading journal prior to market open yesterday (Wednesday, February 5th):\n\n\\-- START OF TRADING JOURNAL--\n\n*\"Looking at the chart, it looks like ARKK broke through resistance after ranging in the channel between $38 - $48 for about a year. It has been on an uptrend since and is currently at $56.45 which is above the 50 and 100 MA on the weekly chart. The price gapped up yesterday from $53.99 to $55.72. I think that it is likely this gap will be filled.*\n\n*How will it affect the option price? Perhaps the option will drop in value and my order will be executed. Does this call option have much value? The stock has four and a half months to make its way toward $65. If there is an overall downtrend in the market, then it is likely this stock will go down with it. If the market trend continues, then I do think that it has a possibility of making it toward the $65 which will (hopefully) increase the value of the contract.*\n\n*I decided to purchase 10 contracts this time so that I can have a few to recover my initial costs, a few to take profit, and a few to ride closer toward the expiration date.\"*\n\n\\--END OF TRADING JOURNAL--\n\nSoon after the market opened, my order executed.  I then decided to go ahead and place a sell order for five contracts at 0.70 (for a total of $350) in order to recover my initial investment.  My reasoning was that this would leave me with five contracts for \"free.\"  I would continue to monitor the options over the next few days/weeks/months.  Regarding when to take profit on these remaining five contracts, what are your thoughts?  Typically, I would think it would be prudent to take profit at 10-15% above my purchase price, but the following trades below have me wondering...\n\n**PAST TRADES**\n\nPlease see the notes from my trade journal below.  Strange timing...I purchased my first options right before the TSLA run-up; however, I did **NOT** make those massive gains like on WSB.  Lol.  If this were a regular stock, I think that I did well though and that the reasoning behind my moves made sense.  I'd love to hear your thoughts as well.  \n\n***TSLA 2/21 $1,000 Calls***\n\n* *Tuesday (1/21/20) - My first option!  I purchased five contracts at 0.51 each for a total of $255. I did not have a trading plan. I'd been doing some reading and wanted to jump in to get my feet wet.  I told myself that I was ready to lose this $255 if things didn\u2019t pan out. I was happily surprised to see the option value increase by $60 at EOD.*\n* *Wednesday (1/22/20) - The option price began to sky rocket. I sold one option on the way up at $2.57 in order to recover my initial investment. This made sense to me. That way, I still have my original investment and everything else would be a bonus. I was planning on letting the other four contracts ride (for an unspecified amount of time) to see what would happen. Later in the day, I decided to sell one contract at $3.20 (over 600% increase) in order to take some profit. It made sense to take profit here because as a trader, if you\u2019re aggressively trying to grow your portfolio, you would take profits around 20-25%. The fact that my investment 6x overnight made it seem more than reasonable to take a little profit as a reward. I still had three contracts remaining.*\n* *Thursday (1/23/20) - The price went from $1.91 to $2.88 down to $1.22 and closed at $1.42. I felt good about my decision to hang onto my three options. I wanted to test out three things: (1) What would happen prior to earnings release. (2) What would happen after earnings release? (3) What would happen in February (closer to expiration date)*\n* *Friday (1/24/20) - I decided to sell my remaining three contracts to lock in profits. There was a lot of uncertainty in the market, so I thought it would be best to stay out. I could still watch what\u2019s going on with this call from the sidelines. I sold my remaining three contracts at $1.15 for a total of $345. In total, my portfolio grew from $1,000 to $1,668! I was happy with this decision.*\n\n*Update: As of today (2/05/20), if I had stuck to my original plan of keeping my remaining three options, I would be in a very good financial position. The last time I checked this morning, the call was worth $61.73 each. :/ Why did I not stick to my plan? I\u2019d already recovered my initial investment as well as taken a little profit. It was because I thought it would be foolish to not take profit while I still had the opportunity.*\n\n***TSLA*** ***2/21 $1180 Calls***\n\n* *Monday (1/27/20) - I purchased five contracts at 0.41 each for a total of $205. I calculated at 15% increase and sold at 0.47. I made $30. :) I thought this was a good strategy for a day trade. I increased my invested capital by 15%.*\n* *Tuesday (1/28/20) - I put in an order for five contracts at 0.41 again so that I could repeat the trade. I was okay if the order didn\u2019t fill. I decided to spend the bulk of the day studying. My trade executed, but by EOD, I was down $45. I was a little sad. I decided to hold and wait for the TSLA earnings report to see what would happen. That would happen after close the next day.*\n* *Wednesday (1/29/20) - I ended the day with a $105 unrealized loss. I learned something new. Option prices (at least those far OTM) do not necessarily correlate with the underlying asset.*\n* *Thursday (1/30/20) - TSLA opened around 632-ish. I thought that the GAP between $594.50 (the ATH on 1/22/20) would be closed soon.* \n* *Friday (1/31/20) - Price fell to 0.05/share. I decided to hold it over the weekend. At this point, I had a $180 unrealized loss. I was ready to lose the entire $205 if things went south. I wanted to keep it and see what would happen over the weekend. (Update: 2/04/20) Looking back, if I was ready to take the entire loss anyway, a good strategy would have been to double down on my position - buy an additional five contracts for a total of $25. I would only be risking an additional $25 but would double my position. The reason I didn\u2019t think much about average down was because sometimes, it doesn\u2019t make sense to add to a losing position\u2026especially since the option could be expire worthless. This was a small risk though, so it would have been a good one to take!*\n* *Monday (2/03/20) - The option price started going up again! TSLA was continuing its uptrend. I thought it would be prudent to sell two contracts at 0.55 in order to recover some of my initial investment.  I decided to sell one contract at 0.75 and then my remaining contracts at 0.85 (after the price had already hit 0.93 and started turning back around. I netted $150 for these five contracts which means I made 73% on my invested capital. This seemed like a great move and I was happy with my trade!  Later in the day, the contract closed around $3. I could have made more, but it made sense to me to take profit.*\n* *Tuesday (2/04/20) - I regret selling all of my positions! My portfolio would be over $45K right now had I held both of the calls I purchased (the 2/21 $1000 that I got for 0.51 and the 2/21 $1180 that I got for 0.41). UGH!  I am having a difficult time remaining emotionally neutral about this situation. On one hand, I increased my trading portfolio by 84% in two weeks which is amazing! On the other hand, I missed out on A LOT of life changing gains. I sold the 2/21 $1180s for $355 yesterday. Today, they are worth $16K. I sold the 2/21 $1000s for $666. Today they are worth $31K.*\n\n***What have I learned and what is my next best move?***\n\n\\---END OF TRADING JOURNAL---\n\nThanks for reading this far.  So guys, what do you think?  Did I make reasonable moves based on the information I had on hand at the time?  What would you have done differently?  What did I do well (and should continue to do)?  I had a good cry on Tuesday already and am ready to put on my big girl pants and move forward.  =)",

        "selftext": "Hi, I a fairly new to investing and stupidly (or more naively) decided to invest in some blue chip stocks such as MSFT, AMZN, MA and V, just before the dreaded coronavirus hit. I decided not to take the money out at the time as these were investments for the mid to long term. My worry now is the sentiment in news seems to have changed from just a 'coronavirus' problem to something far deeper. Being talks that interest rate are set to be cut further and we are heading into a recession territory.  Originally I had in mind that the markets would just come back up in possibly 4-7 months but my fears are now we could be on the turn of something far worse and longer. \n\nSo it would be good to get some professional advice and opinions on this if there is any truth in this and if it is now worth (before it gets even worse), taking my money out of these investments?",

        "selftext": "I am on a burner account, and will happily provide mods with proof of my position and trades.\n\nThe belief that the falling market indices of this past week are a correction, or a dip that will settle after COVID-19 runs it's course is wrong. You should safeguard your assets in preparation for significant deflationary pressures. Let me take you through how I came to this position.\n\nI work for the government, detecting fraud, waste, and malfeasance in the non-financial realm. However, I also enjoy putting my MA in Economics to work researching and picking investments. Over the past few months, I started seeing activity by corporations that looked more and more like the fraud schemes I encountered at my day job.\n\nCompanies were performing stock buybacks at unprecedented levels, and they were taking on massive debt loads to finance it.  Now, according to modern corporate financial thinking, stock buy backs can be a meaningful way to return value to shareholders, and if a company truly believes it is undervalued in the market, than taking out loans to buy it's own stock is possibly a sound financial move. However, the largest, highest-valued companies in the S&amp;P500 continued to buy their own stock, even as their PE ratios climbed higher and higher. \n\nLets take AAPL for instance. Since 2010, Apple has executed 318 B$ in share buy backs, while its total market cap sits at 1400 B$. That means that 29% of AAPL's market cap is effectively it's own money. Concurrently, AAPL's debt to equity has risen to a frightening 1.04. Most nations are never allowed to reach that level, and they literally print their own money. Meanwhile, the market gave AAPL a PE of 26--astronomically high for such an established company.\n\nJNJ played the same game, pumping their own shares with corporate debt to the tune of 18% of their market cap, and the market inexplicable rewards them with a 26 PE, despite JNJ taking on 19 B$ in corporate debt since 2010. Why on earth would a company take out such massive debt, just to pump its own stock? And more importantly, why would the market award such recklessness with a highly favorable PE? \n\nIn fact, of the top 20 S&amp;P500 companies, seven have pumped their market cap over 10% while taking on debt and still have PE over 20. The average PE for the entire S&amp;P500 is 22, a level it hasn't reached sustainably since the dot-com bubble burst in 2000. \n\nWhy, you ask, are companies engaging in this behavior, if it doesn't make economic sense? \n\nThe answer is passive investing. \n\nSee, most passive funds track weighted indices. That means that stocks with larger market caps get a greater share of the passive money pie. In September 2019, passive funds overtook active funds as the dominant allocation of money in the market, and companies no longer have an overriding incentive to be well-managed. Instead the dominant paradigm is market cap at all costs. \n\nOf course, this creates a race to the top, as companies take out debt and buy their own shares, simply to avoid getting left behind in the race for market cap. Since their companies need to continually service ever-growing debt piles, they are increasingly ill-equipped to weather market shocks. When the economy is strong, companies need to shore themselves up so that they can weather the next downturn. Instead, these companies made themselves ever more fragile. Now a few-week slowdown in a Chinese city no one in the US ever heard of is making investors realize just how precarious these companies' positions are. \n\nNow, I hope that the market just enters a recession, loses 20-25% of its value, sheds a few jobs and recovers over time. However, the massive consumer debt bubble may also pop as people start to lose jobs. I have a lot of professional, white collar friends with massive credit card debt. Nationally, personal debt is at an unprecedented high. What happens when people who already can barely service their debt lose their jobs? They default. Visa, Mastercard, and other creditors miss their earnings, and consumers don't buy iPhones--or anything really--since the consumers' lines of credit dried up.\n\nWhat keeps me up at night, is that countries with high inequality are inherently fragile. See, when income is more evenly distributed, most folks fall from middle income to lower income. They still eat, they still have a place to live, they can still take their kid to the doctor. A small number of wealthy take some losses, and maybe downgrade their lifestyle, and an equally small number go from barely hanging on to food or housing insecure. \n\nIn a highly unequal country, however, the wealthy don't meaningfully experience an economic downturns, but the vast majority of people who are barely holding on are going to go into economic freefall. When you are hungry, or don't know where your kid will sleep at night, you start to look around, and the other people in your country don't seem like friends. Those people, especially the ones not like you, start to look like enemies. You have so little, and they want to take what's yours. And you will do anything to protect it.\n\n When you multiply that feeling by the hundreds of millions....I'm not smart enough to know where it ends. But I don't think it will be good. \n\nTake my advice and do with it what you will. I'm keeping my short position until the market falls about 20-25% off its high. Then I'm hunkering down and waiting this out.\n\n-Sten",

ETF in my RRSP (VGRO) and canadian stocks in my TFSA (BAM.A, RY, SHOP) still working on this portion of my investments. \n\nI feel my spread may be odd.

        "selftext": "Another Coronavirus victim...\n\n* * *\n\nMastercard Inc. lowered its three-week-old forecast for quarterly revenue growth as the spreading coronavirus curbs international travel and even takes a bite out of e-commerce, a business executives had hoped would be immune.\n\nThe credit-card network said it\u2019s knocking 2 to 3 percentage points off the prediction it made on an earnings conference call Jan. 29. That translates to growth of 9% to 10% on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions, it said Monday. Shares of Mastercard and Visa Inc. dropped in after-hours trading.\n\n\u201cCross-border travel, and to a lesser extent cross-border e-commerce growth, is being impacted,\u201d Mastercard said in a statement. \u201cThere are many unknowns as to the duration and severity of the situation and we are closely monitoring it.\u201d\n\nThe short-lived forecast underscores how quickly the virus is altering consumer behavior as it moves beyond China. Mastercard executives had previously taken comfort in the fact that much of the firm\u2019s business into and out of China is e-commerce, which could potentially continue amid measures to contain the disease.\n\n\u201cIt provides some level of a hedge,\u201d Chief Financial Officer Sachin Mehra had told analysts on Jan. 29. But even back then, Chief Executive Officer Ajay Banga quickly cautioned that the firm would \u201ctake a look at those numbers once again\u201d if the crisis worsened and affected more parts of the globe.\n\nOn Monday, United Airlines Holdings Inc. withdrew its 2020 profit forecast, also citing the virus.\n\nMastercard\u2019s shares fell 4.4% during regular trading Monday after a spike in infections in countries including South Korea and Italy triggered a global selloff. The stock then dropped an additional 1.1% after hours at 6:30 p.m. in New York. Visa fell 1.7%.\n\nIf the impact of the virus is limited to the first quarter, annual net revenue growth will probably be at the low end of the low-teens range, the company said on Monday, noting that it plans to give further updates on its next earnings call.\n\nVisa CEO Al Kelly told investors at his company\u2019s investor day Feb. 11 that it was \u201ctoo early to tell\u201d what impact the virus might have on results.\n\n\u201cBut if planes are not flying in and out of China, if hotels are not being filled -- which they\u2019re not at the moment -- and if the supply chains are being impacted -- which I suspect they are -- there is going to be some impact,\u201d Kelly said.\n\nhttps://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/mastercard-sees-lower-revenue-growth-as-coronavirus-curbs-travel-1.1395081",

It is not illegal for these people to buy or sell their own shares.\nIn fact, since most of them get paid in stock options, it is expected. However, it is illegal for them to trade on inside information\nthat has not been made public. So for example if there are drug trial results that are bad and not public,\ninsiders cannot dump shares. That said, many people have observed that insiders - in general - seem to have a good\ntrack record at timing their purchases.
