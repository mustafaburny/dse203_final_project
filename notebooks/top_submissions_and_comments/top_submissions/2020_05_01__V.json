        "selftext": "Okay you gang of deluded retards, I'm going to drop some actual useful DD for you. tl;dr and positions at the top, because I know that for the majority of you, \"Fedex parked in front of White House, buy calls\", is as sophisticated DD as your deformed cuckold brains can handle. This is a long post so for those of you who actually want to understand why you're taking a position and learn about a commodity, read on; for those of you who don't, fuck off.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**TL;DR AND POSITIONS**\n\nTankers will have their best earnings call in at least 5 years, if not the last decade, due to all-time-high tanker rates that began spiking towards mid-March. Rates are so high that, say, companies with clean LR2 tankers currently run a spot price of 8x the 5 year historical average and 1 single 2 month voyage is enough to be profitable on the entire year. You're looking to make bets on tanker companies that are trading below their NAV, will post strong FCF, were well positioned for the spike in prices, have large fleets, and have the right types of ships. $NAT is literally the meme-iest stock because it's actually the worst across every single one of these dimensions of any tanker company.\n\n**TL;DR ON WHY NAT IS A MEME:**\n\nLet me draw you an analogy:\n\nWSB is a class in school, and you've all decided not to be homosexual for a day, and NAT is a girl in class. As a result, you all start sending her dick pics and showering NAT with attention, assuming that she is extremely high value. However, in your autistic haste, you all forgot to look around and actually there are 15 other girls in the classroom, and they are all way hotter than NAT. NAT is actually ugly and fat, but you're too busy tunnel visioning in on NAT while you beat off to realize that literally every option is better. As a result, NAT is now overvalued, but a bunch of you are stubborn fuckfaces who continue to shower her with attention because you're too autistic to admit you had no fucking idea what you were doing this whole time.\n\n**POSITIONS:**\n\n**Lowest Risk Position Examples**\n\n* EuroNav ($EURN) $12.50C 6/15\n* Scorpio Tankers ($STNG) $23C 6/15\n\n**Moderate Risk Positions**\n\n* $EURN $12.50C 5/15\n* $STNG $25C 5/15\n\n**Higher Risk Positions**\n\n* $EURN $15C 5/15\n* $STNG $30C 5/15\n\n**Legendary Autistic Risk Positions**\n\n* $EURN $17.50C 5/15\n* $STNG $35C 5/15\n* $NAT, any calls\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**SECTION 1: Overview on Oil Demand Crisis**\n\nIf you understand oil demand destruction and contango, skip ahead. However, based on the fact that people continue to pile in on USO and UCO calls and leaps under the justification of \"hurr durr oil must go up, right, so cheap\", and half of you are bagholding $NAT still, I assume 75%+ of you are retarded.\n\nMany of you still probably have no idea what's happening with oil and why it's fucked long-term. The tl;dr here is that even with OPEC+'s historical cuts, we're still drastically oversupplied. The problem with oil is it's not your meme SPY calls that are in the cloud; oil is a physical product and when you trade USO, you're trading (theoretically) on receiving delivery of oil. We are almost completely out of oil storage already.\n\nYou may ask, well [u/safuros](https://www.reddit.com/u/safuros/), if that's true, why don't we turn off the wells? Markets naturally handle supply and demand. Well, you worthless piece of shit, while your child-groping Honors Econ teacher may have drawn a graph once upon a time in high school when you still had the potential not to be a useless person as you are now, oil production isn't that simple. The reason every country is sandbagging and trying to get other countries to cut oil is that there's a game theory element in play, as well as an oil well intrinsic function issue.\n\nOnce oil wells reduce their production to roughly 50-60% of output, they *cannot go any lower* without risking destroying the well, which is extraordinarily expensive to get the rights to drill on and also is like throwing out a gallon of water when you've only taken a sip. Thus, the only option to reduce further is to entirely stop production and cap the well, and then, assuming your lease on the well hasn't lapsed by the time you can re-open it, uncap it, both of which are extraordinarily expensive. Therefore, most oil companies are far, far better off continuing to produce oil at a loss, because that's still a long-term better play than turning off. Moreover, why the fuck should you be the well to turn off, if other's aren't? Add in the fact that everyone cheats on oil production cuts and the Saudis and Russians are trying to fuck each other and the US in the ass, and you've got a nice oil crisis.\n\nThis leads to the USO/UCO shit show and negative WTI price. Normally, futures holders offload their contracts to buyers who intend to actually take physical delivery as the option expiration date draws near. However, because there is no storage and no demand, none of the typical buyers actually wanted to buy, so you had a bunch of tendie seeking autists desperately trying to offload their contracts so that they wouldn't have 5 dumptrucks of oil barrels delivered to their homes and be completely fucked, such that they were willing to *pay* people (i.e. negative price) to take their contracts. As for contango, well, google it.\n\nFinally, this problem isn't going away any time soon because unless you're so truly deluded as to believe that we'll not only have a V shaped re-opening in terms of social, commercial, and consumer behavior, but that fuel consumption across airlines and cars will rebound immediately, we're on a long term path to recovery, and we're already out of supply. This is like having a clogged bathtub full of water and turning the faucet from 100% on to 50% on - you're still fucked until the faucet turns off (impossible) or the clog goes away more than enough to offset the faucet (not happening for a while). This is why experts broadly agree that [the OPEC+ cuts are meaningless](https://www.worldoil.com/news/2020/4/21/opecplus-mega-deal-rendered-meaningless-by-demand-destruction) and that groups like Morgan Stanley believe [demand destruction of oil will persist until well into 2021](https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Morgan-Stanley-Oil-Demand-Wont-Return-To-Normal-Until-End-2021.html).\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**SECTION 2: A brief overview of Tankers**\n\nYou don't need much of a brain to understand, given the above, why tankers stand to benefit from demand destruction. However, there are many types of tankers, and it's not as obvious as hurr durr buy tankers. Each tanker type carries a different type of product, has a different size, and commands a different rate. Here is the current rates:\n\n[3 key types of tanker business models, spread across a variety of tanker variants](https://preview.redd.it/hd3q2ncaqmw41.png?width=720&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fca616d8afc83afa14721af8e2e5bd1bf243fadd)\n\nAt this point I'm realizing that this post is getting way too long and i'm tired of typing it already, but do your own research on types of tankers. You can see though that tankers are commanding a stupidly high rate compared to their historical values:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/q8u5q1odqmw41.jpg?width=1081&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5bc3668993ed1965a45f8c9af5a7a07f16e851b5\n\nThe current rates are so high that [one spot voyage is profitable on the entire year](https://www.tradewindsnews.com/tankers/tanker-rates-one-spot-voyage-makes-the-whole-year-in-red-hot-market/2-1-801368).\n\n&gt;\"If an MR can get $30,000 per day on a spot voyage, it covers its costs for a year...If an LR2 gets $150,000 or $160,000 a day, it\u2019s the same...you could lay the ship up, earn zero for the next ten months, and still make a profit on the ship.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Guess who owns the most clean-fuel ready LR2's that are exposed to the spot price? $STNG](https://preview.redd.it/iyeeu45gqmw41.jpg?width=894&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b23175ca9c77eb406cadc5b01411c22545e72d59)\n\nNow, don't be stupid and assume that rates will hold this high all year. That said, even if rates went to $0 by mid summer, the rates for Q2 are so high such that it'd still be a higher revenue year than last year. And rates aren't going to $0...they're going to continue to stay above the historical average, just not as high as now, due to the crazy demand destruction.\n\n* **Miscellaneous point of clarification:** I see a lot of dumbasses posting about what numbers will look like if the entire fleet is booked out for, say, NAT. That's ridiculous and not how it works, so don't just go number of tankers x spot rate = revenue for year = tendies.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**Section 3: Why $STNG and $EURN?**\n\nI really need to go fuck your wife soon, so I'm making the sections shorter and shorter. But i'll still tell you way $STNG and $EURN are good bets. First, let's start with NAV - **N**et **A**sset **V**alue. If you don't know what this means, Google it.\n\nAs you (should) know, NAV is something you estimate and can be calculated differently based on different assumptions. Trading below NAV means the stock is underpriced as is, and that's before record earnings and guidance. By most accounts, $EURNs NAV is at least $13 currently, and $STNG is close to $30. They trade at $10 and $21, respectively, right now.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[$STNG isn't even at it's average price for 2019, but 2020 is objectively a better year unless a meteor blows up their fleet](https://preview.redd.it/smsydzfnqmw41.jpg?width=2001&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8b4de32295c00a853844ad5de51c44e7aeabbe0c)\n\nSecondly, fleet size and type. $STNG has one of the largest fleets in the world, and in particular, they have the most LR2 tankers. If you go back up to the graph, you'll see that clean LR2 tankers are commanding an absurd rate, spiking to as high as $250,000 for a few days and currently settled around $150-175k/day, compared to a 5-year historical value of below $25k. $EURN has a solid fleet of VLCC's which are commanding a strong rate, and EURN has good financials - most their boats are fairly new, they don't have a ton of debt.\n\nLastly, they're among the first up on the earnings block, with STNG reporting 5/6 this week and EURN reporting on 5/7. Compare that to NAT, who reports the 23rd, so theta will eat away at what remains of your atrophied testicles every day. That said, regardless of theta, STNG and EURN are really strongly positioned.\n\nI expect that earnings will be solid and likely beat, but not by a crazy amount because rates only started really jacking up in late March, and rates in early Q1 were actually pretty low. However, as many of you still don't fucking understand, **earnings don't matter nearly as much as** **guidance.** That's why you dumbfucks all complain about companies beating earnings but still tanking and then creating stupid conspiracy theories about \"MM is fucking rigging this market\". Guidance for tankers is going to be **euphoric**.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**Section 4: Why is $NAT a meme, and mistakes I see people making**\n\nUltimately, this comes down to people angling towards the right space (tankers) but you've been too stupid to do any research. You probably do this for all your bets, because you're a fucking autist, but you should stop.\n\n1. Fleet size misconception: Cramer meme'd NAT, infamously calling out that they have the largest fleet in the world. In fact, if you actually tried to verify anything you ever fucking did, you could have googled this and realized that NAT has a fleet that, just like your dick, is one of the smallest around. Moreover, they have the wrong type of boats - they primarily have Suezmax boats, which command an okay rate, but aren't close to the best boats to have right now.\n2. No investigation of NAV: NAT's NAV, by all accounts, is close to $3. They are trading at close to $6, and were nearing $8-9 at peak pump. Why the fuck on god's green earth would you buy a company with the wrong type of boats, the wrong fleet size, trading at over 2x NAV, when everyone else is around or below their NAV and has a better fleet?\n3. Massive debt and shitty assets: NAT is saddled in debt, is historically shittily managed (read their earnings report if you know how, but you probably don't know how), and all their boats are at the end of their lifetime, meaning NAT not only has horrible debt but will need to buy a shit ton of new boats very soon\n4. Stupid assumptions on revenue: We covered this earlier, but no, just because demand is high, it doesn't mean every boat is going to get booked at the spot price. Many boats are on existing contracted rates from last quarter, and the ones who are not are not all getting booked out at once.\n5. Looking at ATH as an indicator: If i see another one of you dumb fucks pointing out that NAT used to trade at $16 5 years ago, I will personally find you, tape you to a chair, and shit down your mouth. NAT has issued a shit ton more shares. You are probably the same group who thinks that USO went from $2 to $18 last week.\n\nThe ONLY justification for NAT is now that it's been memed and retail knows all about it, it will probably rise again if the other tankers do well. You can make that play, and you might even make money. Just make sure to dump that shit before earnings because they're not going to be good enough to justify the rise and there's going to be a stupid dump.  \n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**MY POSITIONS:**\n\n\\- 40 $STNG 5/15 $23C\n\n\\- 200 $EURN 5/15 $12.5C\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**CONCLUSION:**\n\nFuck you",

        "selftext": "# Background\n\nThere's a 2007 study on the economy during, and the economic recovery following, the 1918 Spanish Influenza Pandemic (sourced below). The study concluded that employment *increased* in the US during the pandemic due to a plethora of new jobs created specific to the problem. There was no shutdown of the economy. I then looked at historical unemployment figures. It's clear to me now that there's absolutely no basis for a quick recovery of employment, especially following black swan events. The V-shaped recovery narrative is bullshit.\n\n[https://www.stlouisfed.org/\\~/media/files/pdfs/community-development/research-reports/pandemic\\_flu\\_report.pdf?la=en](https://www.stlouisfed.org/~/media/files/pdfs/community-development/research-reports/pandemic_flu_report.pdf?la=en)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Employment will take years to recover\n\nEmployment can't recover overnight. There's no basis for it. Proportional to the current workforce, the most jobs we've ever gained in a single month was in September of 1983 at 1.18 Million. After that, the jobs gain at the end of WW2 at a little over 951,000 when soldiers returned home from the war. \n\nWe're currently sitting at 36.4 Million unemployed and counting. Hourly employees have been let off; we know white collar is next (see below). The number is only going to expand in the short term. Even if it were to stop at only 40 Million (one more week of job losses), it would take 36 months of the best jobs gain ever in the history of the US to recover to February's employment levels. The argument for a quicker recovery is that many of these people will be immediately rehired. Based on my arguments below for a delayed recovery of many different businesses and significantly reduced demand, many if not most will not be. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# The Q1 numbers were worse than you think.\n\nQ1 saw a 4.8% GDP drop, despite a positive January &amp; February. If January and February had positive GDP growth, then the March drop was proportionally equivalent to a 15-19% contraction.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Analyst Q2 GDP projections are too optimistic\n\nA complete shut down of our economy has never happened before. Analysts are claiming a \\~20%+ GDP drop. It will be greater than that by as much as 10 percentage points based on unprecedented negative economic reflexivity, which is not addressed in any of these analyst models. It strains credulity to believe that people will flock to restaurants, theme parks, travel locations, community centers, festivals, concerts, sports games, etc in droves. \n\nIn fact, I think every large gathering will have low attendance and the companies that host events as their main business may find themselves without sufficient revenue to continue operations. This effect will lead to declines in revenue for many different other industries and businesses directly and indirectly. The many small businesses which profit from events, fairs, and festivals rely on a certain amount of revenue to pay for their spot at the event. These businesses will largely be defunct. \n\nOnce people decide to venture out, they'll be unable to spend at pre-covid levels due to massive unemployment. Fear will set in as revenues decline. Investment sentiment will turn negative, and low interest rates won't even be able to keep asset prices from crashing. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# White collar layoffs are next\n\nPeople making \\~$250k-$1M+ at Fortune 500 firms are taking 20-50% salary reductions. Global businesses with domestic headquarters are first laying off their employees abroad, and next they will start trimming operations domestically. That's the word. On face value, it appears bullish, due to lower labor costs, but instead it shows weakness in these firms and will lead to overall declines in demand across the broad economy. There will be many companies that will find their business in shambles in this quarter, which will drag down the indexes, even if a handful sectors happen to perform well by Q2 earnings at the latest. Although, news in the interim may accelerate the timeline. \n\nCompanies with recurring revenues sourced from customers with inelastic demand, such as pharmaceutical firms and military contractors will do fine for a while, but will eventually fall as well due to high p/e relative to other income producing assets and equities.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Conclusion\n\nA nationwide economic shutdown, in the manner it has been done, is like stopping a truck by running it into a wall. Large swathes of the economy have been effectively destroyed. They will have to be completely rebuilt. Demand will drop significantly for years. Employment will likely increase higher even after the economy is reopened.",

        "selftext": "The fundamentals and the \u201cfeel\u201d of the markets are broken right now. Just like Goldman Sachs announced yesterday (5/11/2020), I think that there is a very good chance of a second crash coming to the markets.\n\nSo far, I trust my gut. I've been correct many, many times so far. In early January, I knew the market was coming down. On February 3rd, I even made a video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRmJPgljdG4) to sell stonks. I got laughed at.\n\nTurns out, a few weeks later exactly what I said would occur happened. Early March, Markets Crashed \\~30%. Based on a text I sent on Sunday, March 22, I said \u201cI don\u2019t see it dropping much further.\u201d I came to this conclusion because I got news alerts that \u201cPowell: Federal Reserve Pledges Unlimited Quantitative Easing to Keep Markets Functioning\u201d and gut feeling the CARES ACT was nearing from drafting to negotiation phase. I bought, and told people to buy now.\n\nEnough humble bragging. As soon as this happened, the FED bailed out the market. **RULE #1**: DON'T FIGHT THE FED.\n\nAnyway, the next day (Monday, March 23rd) the Fed did come in. Since that day, the Markets have \u201crecovered\u201d.\n\nThe markets are going to experience a second dip. Since early April, I\u2019ve expected a \u201cW\u201d recovery rather than a \u201cV\u201d, \u201cU\u201d or \u201c\u221a\u201d recovery. Every day we move on, the more confident I become. Here are some reasons I predict a second dip:\n\n1. States will issue a second lockdown phase. High chance this may happen very soon (people freak out over confirmed cases/deaths next week as there is a 2week incubation period) or a spike in the fall. Prediction: 50%.\n2. The shutdown is dragged out way too long. States are crazy enough to extend until mid June. Who\u2019s gonna stop them from shifting the goalposts into August, November, 2021? I see draconian states being crazy enough to do this. Prediction: 100%.\n3. People will realize unemployment numbers are not \u201ctemporary\u201d, but permanent. The market seems to expect a quick bounce in the unemployment numbers, but I truly do not think this will happen. Prediction: 95%.\n4. Consumer spending/demand does not return. I see Q2 financial reports being a much bigger dumpster fire than predicted. April is expected to be bad, but May and June are expected to be a return to normal. I do not see this. Prediction: 80%.\n\nWith one of these  or a mix of these happening, I see a second dip in July/August.\n\nWhat will cause this second dip to recover? The Fed. Markets will keep falling, until then they drop \\~20% and the Fed comes back again.\n\nI predict the Fed will announce negative interest rates. President Trump wants this so badly, and it's one of the most powerful tools the Fed has to pump the market. I don\u2019t even think the market needs to dip again for this to happen in the near future.\n\nI predict this will happen before the election. (September/October). Once this happens, there is no stopping how high stocks will go. As the great Warren Buffett says \u201cInterest rates are like gravity in valuation. If interest rates are nothing, values can be almost infinite. If interest rates are extremely high, that's a huge gravitational pull on value\u201d.\n\nGet those financial news apps installed on your phone ASAP. Fox Business, CNBC, etc. I DON'T CARE. Even if my prediction of a second dip is wrong, as soon as you hear that the Fed announces negative interest rates, go ALL IN. I won't tell you what stocks to buy, but as I said before: **DON'T FIGHT THE FED**. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\&gt;in before \"this guy is full of shit\". I'm just writing my prediction",

        "selftext": " I pasted [the article](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2020/05/07/the-market-v-the-real-economy), to exempt you from registering an account to read it.\n\n##Financial markets have got out of whack with the economy. Something has to give\n\nSTOCK MARKET HISTORY is packed with drama: the 1929 crash; Black Monday in 1987, when share prices lost 20% in a day; the dotcom mania in 1999. With such precedents, nothing should come as a surprise, but the past eight weeks have been remarkable, nonetheless. A gut-wrenching sell-off in shares has been followed by a delirious rally in America. Between February 19th and March 23rd, the S&amp;P 500 index lost a third of its value. With barely a pause it has since rocketed, recovering more than half its loss. The catalyst was news that the Federal Reserve would buy corporate bonds, helping big firms finance their debts. Investors shifted from panic to optimism without missing a beat.\n\nThis rosy view from Wall Street should make you uneasy (see article). It contrasts with markets elsewhere. Shares in Britain and continental Europe, for example, have recovered more sluggishly. And it is a world away from life on Main Street. Even as the lockdown eases in America, the blow to jobs has been savage, with unemployment rising from 4% to about 16%, the highest rate since records began in 1948. While big firms\u2019 shares soar and they get help from the Fed, small businesses are struggling to get cash from Uncle Sam.\n\nWounds from the financial crisis of 2007-09 are being reopened. \u201cThis is the second time we\u2019ve bailed their asses out,\u201d grumbled Joe Biden, the Democratic presidential candidate, last month. The battle over who pays for the fiscal burdens of the pandemic is just beginning. On the present trajectory, a backlash against big business is likely.\n\nStart with events in the markets. Much of the improved mood is because of the Fed, which has acted more dramatically than other central banks, buying up assets on an unimagined scale. It is committed to purchasing even more corporate debt, including high-yield \u201cjunk\u201d bonds. The market for new issues of corporate bonds, which froze in February, has reopened in spectacular style. Companies have issued $560bn of bonds in the past six weeks, double the normal level. Even beached cruise-line firms have been able to raise cash, albeit at a high price. A cascade of bankruptcies at big firms has been forestalled. The central bank has, in effect, backstopped the cashflow of America Inc. The stockmarket has taken the hint and climbed.\n\nThe Fed has little choice\u2014a run on the corporate-bond market would worsen a deep recession. Investors have cheered it on by piling into shares. They have nowhere else good to put their cash. Government-bond yields are barely positive in America. They are negative in Japan and much of Europe. You are guaranteed to lose money by holding them to maturity, and if inflation rises the losses would be painful. So stocks are appealing. By late March prices had fallen by enough to tempt the braver sort. They steeled themselves with the observation that much of the stockmarket\u2019s value is tied to profits that will be made long after the covid-19 slump has given way to recovery.\n\nTellingly, though, the recent rise in share prices has been uneven. Even before the pandemic the market was lopsided, and it has become more so. Bourses in Britain and continental Europe, chock-full of troubled industries like carmaking, banking and energy, have lagged behind, and there are renewed jitters over the single currency (see article). In America investors have put even more faith in a tiny group of tech darlings\u2014Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Microsoft\u2014which now make up a fifth of the S&amp;P 500 index. There is little euphoria, just a despairing reach for the handful of businesses judged to be all-weather survivors.\n\nAt one level, this makes good sense. Asset managers have to put money to work as best they can. But there is something wrong with how fast stock prices have moved and where they have got back to. American shares are now higher than they were in August. This would seem to imply that commerce and the broader economy can get back to business as usual. There are countless threats to such a prospect, but three stand out.\n\nThe first is the risk of an aftershock. It is entirely possible that there will be a second wave of infections. And there are also the consequences of a steep recession to contend with\u2014American GDP is expected to drop by about 10% in the second quarter compared with a year earlier. Many individual bosses hope that ruthless cost-cutting can help protect their margins and pay down the debts accumulated through the furlough. But in aggregate this corporate austerity will depress demand. The likely outcome is a 90% economy, running far below normal levels.\n\nA second hazard to reckon with is fraud. Extended booms tend to encourage shifty behaviour, and the expansion before the covid crash was the longest on record. Years of cheap money and financial engineering mean that accounting shenanigans may now be laid bare. Already there have been two notable scandals in Asia in recent weeks, at Luckin Coffee, a Chinese Starbucks wannabe, and Hin Leong, a Singaporean energy trader that has been hiding giant losses (see article). A big fraud or corporate collapse in America could rock the markets\u2019 confidence, much as the demise of Enron shredded investors\u2019 nerves in 2001 and Lehman Brothers led the stockmarket down in 2008.\n\nThe most overlooked risk is of a political backlash. The slump will hurt smaller firms and leave the bigger corporate survivors in a stronger position, increasing the concentration of some industries that was already a problem before the pandemic. A crisis demands sacrifice and will leave behind a big bill. The clamour for payback will only grow louder if big business has hogged more than its share of the subsidies on offer. It is easy to imagine windfall taxes on bailed-out industries, or a sharp reversal of the steady drop in the statutory federal corporate-tax rate, which fell to 21% in 2017 after President Donald Trump\u2019s tax reforms, from a long-term average of well over 30%. Some Democrats want to limit mergers and stop firms returning cash to their owners.\n\nFor now, equity investors judge that the Fed has their back. But the mood of the markets can shift suddenly, as an extraordinary couple of months has proved. A one-month bear market scarcely seems enough time to absorb all the possible bad news from the pandemic and the huge uncertainty it has created. This stock market drama has a few more acts yet.\u25a0",

        "selftext": "Warren Buffett made headlines recently after his recent [virtual Berkshire Hathaway Annual Shareholders Meeting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69rm13iUUgE).\n\nBuffett sold of all his shares in the major US airlines, and Berkshire announced a record quarterly net loss of nearly $50BN.

It was inevitable.\n\nHowever, they were afraid of massive protests against corporate greed, massive social unrest, etc so they needed a diversion that would provide an excuse.\n\nPeople will think the crash was solely due to the virus and not the numerous fundamental economic and structural issues at play.\n\nTo highlight just a few: we've had the [yield curve inversion](https://www.businessinsider.de/international/yield-curve-inversion-explained-what-it-is-what-it-means-2019-8/?r=US&amp;IR=T), the [repo madness](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-12-08/repo-blowup-was-fueled-by-big-banks-and-hedge-funds-bis-says), the [record corporate debt](https://www.businessinsider.de/international/us-corporate-debt-10-trillion-record-percentage-economy-expert-warnings-2019-12/?r=US&amp;IR=T), and [corporations being the main source of demand for equities via stock buybacks](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/25/business/stock-market-buybacks.html) which enrich executives that hit certain earnings per share targets.\n\nLast year billionaire Peter Thiel, who was part of the notorious Paypal Mafia, [spoke on the dangers of American Exceptionalism](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JRyy2MM-rI). He argues that this has made America \"exceptionally un-self-critical\"\n\nWarren Buffett concluded in his virtual meeting: \"Never bet against America\"\n\nIn other words, never bet against the military industrial complex to enforce American superiority and the power of the dollar as the de facto unit of exchange globally.\n\n**TRUTH 2/2:**\n\nAs smart contracts pioneer Nick Szabo has stated:\n\n\"Buffett's wealth can be measured less in present cash than in the future cash from the Fed he is right up there at the front of the Cantillon line to get.\"\n\n[The Cantillon Effect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv5xl1AEeQs) essentially refers to the fact that fiat printing itself increases inequality. \n\nOn a more general note, it is important to remember that, despite his gentle image, Buffett is ruthless in his craft. \n\nA [New York magazine profile from 1991](https://books.google.de/books?id=veTPZA9TWxsC&amp;pg=PA45&amp;lpg=PA45&amp;dq=1991+new+york+magazine+warren+buffett+Warren+looks+like+a+teddy+bear,+but+mentally+is+he+ever+tough&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=OT8xAOp_-y&amp;sig=ACfU3U2s1_9PvAvkaw4w5BSh0l1KgG1yhA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjtvP2__ZzpAhUG3aQKHfcYA1kQ6AEwFXoECAkQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=1991%20new%20york%20magazine%20warren%20buffett%20Warren%20looks%20like%20a%20teddy%20bear%2C%20but%20mentally%20is%20he%20ever%20tough&amp;f=false) stated: \n\n\"Though he appears homey and guileless and cultivates a hayseed image, Buffett can be iron-fisted.\"\n\nAccording to a senior Salomon trader: \"Warren looks like a teddy bear, but mentally is he ever tough.\"\n\nYes, Buffett has dropped numerous gems throughout the years, but ultimately his responsibility is to Berkshire Hathaway and his own, sizeable, bags.\n\nOverall, it would be foolish to overlook Buffett's current cash position.\n\nWhen everything is dirt cheap and we do eventually hit the bottom, he will be flush with cash and ready to aggressively sweep up bargains. \n\nAt the moment, it is clear that he believes these bargains are not present, and therefore it would be wise to consider the fact that we may have further downside in store...\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsAfJMNtxsU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsAfJMNtxsU)",

High prices were signalled in [MSFT](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/MSFT/LWCMh0jH-Microsoft-Setting-Up-For-Hard-Landing/), [BRK](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/BRK.A/bHDf6D7j-Buffet-s-the-King-of-the-Bag-Holders/), [SPCE](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/SPCE/uFAroqOi-SPCE-and-Gravity/), [GOOG](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/GOOG/m56g98mU-Weekly-Bearish-Butterfly-Pattern/). A high on [AMZN was called](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/AMZN/b4DOD5dy-The-Amazon-Bubble/), but price later traded higher. The best signal generated was a buy on the [TVIX from 34 to 800.](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/TVIX/ts9VcIlG-TVIX-Long-Term-Trend-Line-Break/)\n\nIn the month of March , 2020, the bubble popped. Most risk based assets and indices crashed over 30%. First analysis post said to [wait for a bounce to sell into](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/DJI/nVbfBVXn-Dow-Bounces-Like-a-Brick-While-Making-Big-Breakout/), but this was updated before the market opened to say prices could fall [8% and then 30% in March.](https://bearmarketsprofits.com/2020/03/01/30-dow-jones-drop/) At this point the TradingView account was suspended. Only one account is allowed, and this was set up specifically for a 2020's bear market. So no further posts or updates were made there.\n\nOn the 3rd of March came the first signal to [look for the down move entering somewhere in the 16,000 - 18,000 area](https://bearmarketsprofits.com/2020/03/16/dow-jones-enters-end-of-denial-stage-and-start-of-the-bull-trap/) on the Dow Jones. Followed by a post on the 16th of March saying [we're entering into the bull trap.](https://bearmarketsprofits.com/2020/03/31/optimism-in-the-air-as-end-of-bull-trap-approaches/) The low on the Dow would be made around 18,250 on the 23rd of March. From here a rally began which has made a current high of 24,500.\n\nApril of 2020 has been the bull trap month. Some losing signals have been generated in the later couple weeks of April. A few calls on the top of the bull trap have been made. Prices have not went substantially higher, they've just not dropped. A forecast on the [17th of April marks the current high](https://bearmarketsprofits.com/2020/04/16/17th-april-2020-the-bull-trap-completes/), but it looks like price can trade a bit higher. A post on the 19th of April calls for a crash in the S&amp;P500 to [1,600 within the next 5 - 10 weeks](https://bearmarketsprofits.com/2020/04/19/19th-of-april-here-comes-an-attitude-readjustment/).\n\nToday is the 25th of April. Over the last two weeks forecasts of a big drop starting have been inaccurate. I very strongly suspect this is akin to the sell signals generated in late January and early February. It's the right idea, but it's just the wrong time. A top in the Dow Jones somewhere in the 24,000 - 25,000",

        "selftext": "Since RTX is currently a hot topic, here's a breakdown on what the company represents. Make sure you know and understand what you are investing in.\n\n**Raytheon Technologies Corporation (RTX)**\n\nRTX was formed from the merger of United Technologies Corporation and Raytheon Company.\n\nThe company has four subsidiaries:\n- Pratt &amp; Whitney - aircraft engines and gas turbines\n- Collins Aerospace - aerospace parts and systems for commercial, regional, corporate and military aircraft; also a major supplier for international space programs;\n- Raytheon Intelligence &amp; Space - satellite sensors, satellite signal processing, radar, infrared sensors, etc\n- Raytheon Missiles &amp; Defense - precision weapons, radars, command and control systems\n\nPratt &amp; Whitney and Collins Aerospace are the merged portions from UTC. \n\nUTC spun off Otis Elevator and Carrier Corporation prior to the merger. \n\nThis makes all of RTX's revenue based on aerospace (both civilian/commercial and military) and defense. The intended goal of the merger was to make a more focused business (hence the spin-offs).\n\n**RTX Revenue Stream Breakdown**\n- Pratt &amp; Whitney - $20.9 billion net sales; 75% Commercial, 25% Military [P&amp;W Fact Sheet Available Here](https://newsroom.prattwhitney.com/collateral)\n- Collins Aerospace - $26 billion net sales; 75% Commercial, 25% Military [Collins Aerospace Fact Sheet](https://www.collinsaerospace.com/-/media/project/collinsaerospace/collinsaerospace-website/newsroom/files/collins_aerospace_fact-sheet.pdf)  \n- Raytheon - $27.1 billion net sales (RTN did not file a 2019 annual report) [2018 Annual Report](https://investors.rtx.com/static-files/4ef5db84-7cfc-41d0-9081-d22a83542afb)\n\nCollectively:\n\nUTC accounted for $35.2 billion in commercial sales and $11.7 billion in military sales\n\nRaytheon accounted for $27.1 billion in sales\n\n$74 billion altogether, with about 48% being commercial sales \n\n\n**Analysis**\n\nAlmost half of RTX's sales are related to commercial aircraft. Commercial air travel is obviously almost non-existent right now. Sales for new aircraft (and engines) will be down dramatically for an unknown but extended period of time, and aftermarket repair and maintanence will also be down. A quote on the company's trajectory/recovery from their CEO during today's conference call:\n\n    \u201cIt\u2019s not a sharp V,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is more like a U shape. I think it\u2019s going to be a full two years before we see a recovery close to what we saw in terms of 2019 levels of aftermarket. That could well be three years.\u201d\n\nTherefore, it looks like the majority of the company's income for the near future will be based on defense contracts. This might explain the recent downtrend in the stock's performance. I personally believe the company is undervalued and is a great long term buy and hold, but it may take several years for the stock to recover. Unlike most of the large defense companies out there, RTX's role in the commercial market gives them a wider range of opportunities than their competitors. Pratt &amp; Whitney's engines are widely regarded as the best on the market, and their placement on new Airbus planes means that they will have long term servicing revenue. Therefore, although they may be the weaker portion of the company in the short term, they should be able to rebound effectively.",

        "selftext": "The trading pattern could be (for tech) a V shape recovery like in 2018 but not as for the other sectors. The tech sector really loves free money and low fed funds rates but XLF and XOP don\u2019t favor this as well as low oil prices. XRT will really start to dip as turnout becomes underwhelming due to Covid fear the people were fed and lack of disposable income as 33 million have filed for unemployment.

        "selftext": "**Play the momentum \u2013 see everyone tomorrow.**\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeriously though.  SPY finished strong yesterday and had a good open and most of day.  Oil has been super strong and continued its monster push.  Oil names continued their crazy momentum and weak sectors remained weak.  Now the questions turns to, how long can momentum continue before it moves to another sector?  \n\nSo I did a very unscientific eyeball test of daily charts from all the sectors I cover.  When momentum takes over the average run is about 4 days with some lasting 7 days (gold miners push).  I want to begin moving my trading style into letting plays run.  I have often found the bottom of names, got my 2% and got out, only to have the stock run 10-15% more.  Although today that play did not work (see REITS).  Although I noted yesterday that they were a weaker sector so should have locked that in earlier\u2026anyways I\u2019m rambling, analysis time.\n\n\n**Energy and Oil Companies** - MEG Energy Corp, Crescent Point Energy, Cenovus Energy, CDN Natural Resources, Suncor Energy, Enbridge, Teck Resources Limited, Husky Energy\n\nOil and futures up big.  So now I need to start looking at individual names since all are doing their own thing and not moving as a sector.\n\nMEG \u2013 Wish I didn\u2019t let this one go so early.  $3.44 is high of bounce in beginning of April.  With momentum it looks like it should break.\n\nCPG \u2013 It didn\u2019t get the big V that most names got in March but it\u2019s been slowly climbing since and it almost at the gap from the March drop.  If we start filling it\u2019s a good vacuum. \n\nCVE \u2013 Thought I was looking at the same chart again for a second, same as CPG\n\nCNQ \u2013 So although it definitely had more of a drop and V shape recover in March, it is actually looking similar to CPG and CVE, despite not getting as big of bounces recently.  Although the weakness today shows potential for bear flag on daily.\n\nSU \u2013 See CNQ \u2013 similar set up\n\nENB \u2013 similar set up to SU and CNQ but seems to have slightly more room to avoid bear flag.\n\nTeck.B \u2013 going to call this a failed equilibrium break but has support from past few days to act on\n\nHSE \u2013 of all the names this one is definitely doing its own thing.  I think it has enough room to continue it\u2019s 4 hour uptrend.\n\n**Gold Miners** -  Kirkland Lake Gold, Kinross Gold, Barrick Gold, Eldorado Gold, IAMGOLD, B2Gold, Yamana Gold, OceanGold.\n\nI swear these names can\u2019t be weak for more than a couple hours.  Started off red across board, finished green across board.  Most looking like they will test highs from a week ago.\n\n**Marijuana Stocks** - Canopy, Aphria, Aurora, HEXO, Organigram. Cronos, and some US MSO\u2019s.  \n\nBefore the constellation warrant news, WEED was looking like it was heading back to $20 support.  An even day with this much SPY green has me leaning bearish towards that support.\n\n**Banks** - BMO, RBC, Scotiabank, CIBC, Manulife, TD\n\nWeak sectors gonna be weak.  You get a daily bear flag, and you get a daily bear flag.  Everyone gets a daily bear flag!  But seriously, watch for tomorrow to test low of yesterday.\n\n**REITS** - Brookfield, Smartcentres, Riocan, HR Real Estate\n\nShould have stuck with my normal trading game plan.  My normal game play is to get my 2-3% and GTFO.  I mentioned in the opening I wanted to change that since I often time the bottom right but then miss out on more of that 5% upside.  So I set a sell order for $13.45 on BPY after my entry of $12.56.  Well we got to $13.10 and dumped all day.  So instead of taking what could have been 4%, I am now in the red.  Still holding because [I have trend lines coming up soon]( https://www.tradingview.com/x/OctQx30t/) but damn.  Also, strength of the name did not help today.  The weaker names got their oversold bounces and held up better.\n\nLooking at the daily, from a chart perspective, I like CAR first, BAM.A and HR., then BPY.UN after today and then SRU, REI, PLZ\n\n**SHOP** - Choo Choo.  Hit ATH, pulled back towards EOD but nothing of substance of hourly to be worried about.  Financials upcoming.  Roll the dice if you want.  \n\nEDIT:  Just noticed SPY dumped at EOD and put downward pressure on a lot of names.  Still held pre-market lows but will be interesting to see if we fill that gap after hours/pre tomorrow.",

        "selftext": "First off, I am in no positions as of right now and I am currently neither bullish or bearish so this post is not biased in anyway just informational.\n\nAs we all know this week was interesting, still climbing up to 300 as deaths top and unemployment goes to the sky. Everyone here is either say V shaped recovery or another leg down. Who knows? Not me. Just thought that this information was interesting. \n\nI checked ETF fund flows online and this is what I saw\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/okv7zapxosx41.png?width=651&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=26df9a2e24e1e9c27563b95bbd88c9a9a5aaa7e3\n\nThe total outflow/inflow for Spy past two weeks was roughly -5.4 million dollars. I checked other etfs but spy was more active. Now this information only isn't all that great but lets check DIX. \n\n Over \u2153 of stock volume trades in the dark. Most of this volume trades at the midpoint of the NBBO, which obscures the direction of the trade, making dark pools' pre- and post-trade data notoriously tricky to interpret. It's all private and the graph is pretty interesting. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/csjzxhikpsx41.png?width=1214&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bc1943849decb9c9eab4ed7131467a90c53486e7\n\nThe green is SPY and the blue is the dark index buying and selling. And of course when spy crashed look at that buy volume insane right. But look towards the end there's a large sell off and everyday past few days its growing and growing. \n\nOf course I want to believe spy to 300 but at the same time a strong correction again is not too far out. Just be weary about buying shares and going all in calls like some of you idiots like to do. \n\nMy final prediction: I think we can hit spy 300 in the coming days with some nice rallies but as soon as we get there (give or take a few dollars) I think we can drop to 260 again. I think we cannot hit all time highs again in this kind of environment. Trump wants a strong market right? But I believe he wants a healthy market as well and if we can correct and climb back up, we can see our all time highs get crushed and climb higher.",

Given all the economic news, I feel like we're at the \"Printing Money &amp; Credit\" stage and we've been here for quite some time. The virus just dialed it up to 11.\n\nMy question: even with a strong recovery around second half of 2020, is an economic downturn (and the eventual downward pressure on the stock market) inevitable given the stage we are currently in? A good number of people have mentioned that corporate debt and commercial mortgages are the next big things that'll come home to roost. To me, it kinda makes sense and I wonder if Covid recovery can really stop these forces and sustainably push the markets to new all-time highs in 2020 - especially with the Fed freshly out of interest rate cuts and printing money like a Charmin' factory doing a mountain of cocaine.\n\nFor the bulls and bears, what is your upside and downside thesis?  As you can tell, I'm a bit bearish at the moment and as such, am more curious about the bull thesis, just in case I have a substantial blindspot that's unbeknownst to me.\n\nThanks!",

Anyone have any personal opinions about this?  \n\nI think what he's saying is that say you took allocations from these major robo investing companies and instead of going into a Total market large cap fund, say for 40% (or whatever allocation the benchmark is) and put it into a \"Total Value Large Cap Fund\", then over the next say 30 years, you would beat the market.  Then replace Small Cap allocation with Small cap value ETF etc.\n\nDoes anyone think this is true?  I've never studied the statistics for this or maybe Value over the long run just got lucky and the next 100 years will be different.  \n\nAny one have thoughts on this?",

Caution, my last play didn't go well:\n\n* An SPY Guide - $5000 put in, total loss of $2368 ([Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g5zf9o/the_normie_playbook_an_spy_guide_to_the_days_ahead/), [Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g8krsz/the_normie_playbook_a_terrifying_spy_update/), [Part 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gd2zbu/the_normie_playbook_wait_is_this_happening/))\n\n# A Bullish Case\n\nStock market rallies don't simply end because people wake up one day in mass and decide things are over priced.  There's a catalyst.  Lacking a catalyst, assuming current assumptions around the COVID-19 recovery hold true, it's fair to expect the market to work higher.  Sprinkle in FED action, which while down 89% from  it's 3/25 peak, still dumped another $65 billion into the financial system.\n\nBulls are expecting a quick recovery, and while battered, they haven't been knocked off that position.  There's continued discussion around a vaccine, optimism, stage 2 trials, and numerous companies and universities pursuing it.  We're north of 300k daily tests, and the positive test rate is declining, states are reopening, we got through Easter, and we found remdesivir effective.  P/E is high, but even if you believe that governments are propping equities up, this ponzi scheme still puts US equities at the top, likely to bleed the least and profit the most.  It's not to say a dip wasn't warranted, it was just an over-reaction, hope you enjoyed the ride back to appropriate valuations.\n\nMoney right now is easy.  Interest rates are low, and will remain there, maybe even negative, with a FED heavily accommodating of markets.  Liquidity is flowing like rain, banks across the globe are jumping on the QE train.  Shorting the market is shorting the governments ability to continue the rally, and as Buffet says, don't bet against America.  \n\nOh, and guess what, Congress is going to hand everyone more money.\n\n* [Considering another stimulus package](https://www.businessinsider.com/heres-what-the-phase-4-stimulus-package-might-look-like-2020-4)\n* [Zillow expects home prices to rebound next year](https://www.zillow.com/research/prices-sales-forecast-coronavirus-26975/)\n* [US Treasury borrowing 3 trillion this quarter](https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2020/05/04/us-treasury-seeks-to-borrow-a-record-3-trillion-this-quarter.html)\n* [Interest rates down, mortgage applications up 7% from prior week, refi applications doen 2% week over week but 210% increase year to year](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/06/weekly-mortgage-applications-show-real-recovery-in-homebuying.html)\n* [Duke professor says downturn is over by end of 2020 with a vaccine, U shape, highlights Oxford](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/economic-expert-with-perfect-record-calling-recessions-is-betting-this-one-will-be-over-by-the-end-of-2020-2020-05-06)\n* [Fauci talks positive Modenra vaccine optimism](https://www.bizjournals.com/boston/news/2020/05/06/fauci-singles-out-moderna-s-coronavirus-vaccine-as.html)\n\n# A Bearish Case\n\nDespite the optimism, the Fed can't create demand.  Consumer spending is not going to come back to where it was.  Millions will remain unemployed, the jobs aren't all coming back.  The idea of a V shaped recovery is ridiculous, even a U shaped recover is irrational.  Given the market expects such a recovery, the theta from news is going to burn bulls, day over day as the recovery doesn't manifest with the expected velocity, gravity of expectations will pull bulls to the ground.\n\nJune will see auto delinquencies appear in servicer reports, by end of July extensions 3 month payment extensions run out, auto repossessions will begin again, and the extra unemployment comes to a close.  With September comes standard unemployment insurance running out for initial layoffs, followed by the end of our foreclosure moratorium. \n\nNow imagine we never get a vaccine, it's never proved easy for other SARs diseases, why would this one be any different?  The market hasn't priced in a significant bounce.  States reopening too soon.  The US outside NY/NJ/PA still rising in case counts, and people are sick of being quarantined.  Oh, and good luck getting the US culture to adopt masks.\n\nThe market expects COVID to be beaten, when the reality is it needs to be endured.  We've shot most of our stimulus shots, we shot wildly and while some hit, we wasted too much and we will pay in time.  This virus will be with us for years, and so will the impacts.  The world is heading for a recession, and they'll drag the US right down with them. \n\n* [More people will die because we reopen](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/reopening-states-will-cause-233000-more-people-to-die-from-coronavirus-according-to-wharton-model-120049573.html)\n* [CDC projects possible May surge in cases and deaths](https://www.axios.com/cdc-projections-coronavirus-may-june-a96726e7-acc8-4855-b603-dc6518f560f5.html)\n* [Consumer debt reaches $14.3 trillion, $1.6 trillion more than prior high in 2008](https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2020/05/05/consumer-debt-hits-new-record-of-14point3-trillion.html)\n* [Layoffs turning permanent](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-05-06/temporary-coronavirus-layoffs-are-turning-permanent-around-u-s)\n* [US pushes WHO to defy china and invite Taiwan to discuss COVID](https://news.yahoo.com/us-demands-invite-taiwan-meeting-171658691.html)\n* [States running out of unemployment funds, federal reserves almost 50% depleted](https://www.wjbf.com/news/states-are-running-out-of-unemployment-money-but-claimants-shouldnt-worry/?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter_WJBF)\n* [Bankruptcy steady at pre-covid levels, but the wave is coming](https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/biblical-wave-bankruptcies-about-flood-us)\n* [Google planning for employees at home until 2021](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/coronavirus-google-facebook-work-from-home-2021-latest-a9505936.html)\n* [Germany calls US claim COVID is man made in China an intentional distraction from Trump's mistakes](https://www.thelocal.de/20200508/germany-shuns-trumps-claims-covid-19-outbreak-was-caused-by-chinese-lab-leak)\n* [SPY has net outflows of $9.7 billion in past 30 days, QQQ has inflows of $5 billion](https://www.marketwatch.com/amp/story/guid/99DBCE24-9075-11EA-9208-AF2E6FA5B5BC)\n* [Warm temperatures and humidity ineffective in slowing COVID spread](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/health/coronavirus-summer-temperature-warm-hot-spread-study-pandemic-a9506201.html?utm_term=Autofeed&amp;utm_medium=Social&amp;utm_source=Twitter#Echobox=1588971997)\n* [United scraps bond sale due to lack of interest](https://www.bloomberg.com/amp/news/articles/2020-05-08/united-air-scraps-2-25-billion-bond-sale-as-demand-disappoints)\n\n# My Take\n\nBoth cases above have some FUD, but both also have merits. \n\nFirst, separate Main Street (consumer and production economy) from Wall Street (financial markets), as they are different.  The FED can do wonders for financial markets and in turn Wall Street, but it can't manifest demand.  Congress can.  Stimulus can.\n\nThere likely will be another round of stimulus and it'll boost spending, can kicked down the road.  Now it may not come until June, but US equities are strong and as long as the assumption holds, so will the near term impact of it's expected arrival.  Sure, the house of cards may fall in time, but what's going to bring it down?  We lack a clear short term catalyst.\n\nThe bulls ate more straw off our camel's back than bears threw on.  States are reopening, there's talk of more stimulus, curves are flattening, positive treatments, vaccine's progressing, and the market is recovering.  The bearish news is the unknown, the whispers in the wind, we'll see in two weeks, wait until September, and the reality that so much is wrong with Main Street, that things can't be this positive with Wall Street.  Can't say they're wrong, but they don't weigh as much.  The market's priced in awful Q2 results, with no guidance, and a market that by it's nature wants to rise, there's little besides whispers to hold it down.\n\n# In Search of a Catalyst\n\nSo what could bring what we feel, and the equity market into better alignment?  We need a catalyst, some options:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Consumer Spending** \\- Eventually, Wall Street and the financial market is still tied to Main Street and the need for production via demand from a consumption economy.  If unemployment remains low, and wages decrease, you can throw stimulus at it, but spending will drop.  As spending drops, the volume of decline, if severe, can open up a world of hurt for equities as guidance and P/E fall as a reaction.\n* **Bankruptcies and Defaults** \\- Governments can solve liquidity issues and prop up prices, but good luck fixing the solvency of a business when margins crash due to lack of spending and debts exceed the ability for business (or people) to pay them.  Less hoarding cash by businesses (profitable for financial institutions), more drawing down (cash crunch), more borrowing.  Add to that regulatory tightening for banks post 2008 and minimum levels required will strain them further.  All this can create a rush to hoard cash, which will restart a massive equity outflow.  The challenge is, I don't see this coming near term, even if you believe it is coming.\n* **The Dollar** \\- The dollar is the standard of the world, but that's not always great, especially when supply causes issues.  When you have massive debt that results in bankruptcies, the money supply starts to dwindle as unemployment ramps, confidence fades, money gets hoarded, and deflation sets in.  This unavailability of dollars is a huge risk.  Currencies are getting crushed by the dollar, negative interest rates could become a trigger of insolvency, an outflow of equities to generate cash, and a massive crash as a result.\n* **Significant COVID Resurgence** \\- Obviously, anything approaching a country wide lock down in the US will send markets back to their knees.\n* **Guidance** \\- As the recovery comes, guidance will return.  More than half of Wall Street has pulled guidance, less than a quarter are expected to offer full year guidance, and analysts are flying blind.  As that spigot turns back on, the reality of impacts could be more bearish than expected similar to how we saw with Q1 under-performing.  CEO's tapering FY21 expectations, discussing reduced consumer sentiment, shifts in culture, and a recovery that carries deep into 2022 could be enough to tip companies to truer valuations. \n* **Reality** \\- As all of the above hit in less severe degrees, there is the sum of parts which becomes significant enough that equities fall, perhaps not at an accelerated pitch, but fall significantly all the same.\n\nNone of the above are assured.  There is an ever increasing reality that this market has a bottom.  I struggle to comprehend that at times, and there are so many threads to pull that can crumble things.  But perhaps the FED is able to unwind QE without impact, perhaps the dollar's global position is the strength needed for the US to recover faster despite being hit harder.  Perhaps.  \n\nRight now, my sentiment is short term bull.  Medium term uncertain.  Long term bear.  Unclear on if we've found bottom.  This past week has trended bullish across the board.\n\n# The Next Play\n\nThe only thing this weekend tells me is: be patient.  It's unclear our direction, even in the near term.  I could make a case in either direction.  This week, is going to be a short term week.  I'll avoid holding overnight, avoid going long (barring very clear signals), and will play the swings (up or down) as my TA dictates.  \n\nI like to end \"plays\" when a theme shifts, it helps me avoid chasing losses, so that's what I'm doing and I now consider my prior play done, and failed.  I've allocated another $5000 to a new play, I'll call this play \"Patiently Waiting\".  I expect most positions this week to be smaller, in the $500 to $1000 range, in and out, and I'll be surprised if I fully deploy my allocated capital at one time.\n\nI don't have a planned entry.  I doubt I do anything before noon on Monday, if Monday at all.  I'll create a shorter post once I find my entry, and will track critical TA for the week as well as the profitability of the play in there.\n\n# TLDR\n\nThere's a bull case, there's a bear case, the bull's had a stronger week.  Many links, much news.  No clear TA giving confidence in a position, will take short term day trades while waiting for clarity to emerge, will add a post later to track how much I lose.",

        "selftext": "***TLDR: Tankers are played out. Oil still has large moves in the near future, but, who cares which way it goes? Straddles on SCO. NFA, just what I am doing with my personnel trump bucks.***\n\nIf you look at my post from last weekend, you will see 6 points that I am following currently. 1 point is the June expiration of WTI oil. I don't have time to update everything this weekend, maybe I will this week. The background framework is all coming from Macrovoices, and their slidedeck is linked here: https://www.macrovoices.com/guest-content/list-guest-publications/3670-bigpicture-trading-chart-book-may-7-2020/file\n\n***Background:*** The massive drop in demand for oil (shutdown for CV) caused a glut due to the time required for an industry to react (to finally make a costly shut-in decision). The May WTI oil contract went negative in April due to a limited volume of speculative traders who remained in the market until just before expiration, and who found themselves with no free (re: non-reserved) storage. Negative prices ensued. This negative pricing was one of many signals to oil producers that they must shut in. A resolution was also needed to assist with the short term excess oil, which resulted in tankers being called on for floating storage -&gt; limited supply = price skyrocketed. \n\n***What happens next depends on your view on the data, which you can review on your own. Two conclusions:***\n\n***A. Oil Bulls:*** We have shut in enough wells, have limited oil build, increased usage + near-term further increased usage is coming. This means, floating storage is no longer as in demand as it once was, and tankers, even having a great quarter or two or four (if they got booked out for the next 6-18 months) will not scream higher. The short term economics become less important compared to the long term trend in tankers, which was not great. Massive dividends this year? This signals the company has nowhere they would invest which would bring a greater benefit to investors. Even in a depression / lockdown environment, do we really think oil demand will stay -30 to -40% below average 2019 usage? And if so, do we really think oil producers wouldn't / won't shut in their wells, rather than sell into a market with such depressed pricing? Oil prices will go higher due to the resolution of the short-term issues stemming from the initial response to the corona virus + the Russian and Saudi oil tiff. Speculators have been limited from the leading month contracts by their brokers, reducing the risk of a large price shift at expiration. USO has been neutered and isn't acting as a roll-over whale anymore. \n\n***B. Oil Bears:*** We are seeing misleading indicators and we still have a major problem approaching. Oil producers did not react quick enough to the market signal, and we have a glut of oil still flowing into Cushing, OK. Oil tankers as floating storage are still needed and will be for the forseeable future. The rate of flows into Cushing is not continuing at the previous elevated pace, due to an approach to working capacity limiting the rate of fill + alternative storage being sought. Producers cannot shut-in their wells due to bankruptcy concerns, and the government has already intervened by signaling they will bail out the industry. If the government is bailing them out, the risk has just decreased massively, leading to a push to continue producing, rather than shutting off the money supply. Further, since many of these producers have already sold their oil before they pull it out of the ground, they are not incentivized to solve the storage issue. The oil is the problem of the trader at the other end of the contract. The Texas Railroad Commission has not acted to reduce production, which may have helped pricing elevate. Additionally, the companies weighing a V-shaped recovery, meaning the demand increases they see right now will only keep going up, are completely wrong. No faith in the Trump administration + CV = further lockdown, or, consumer behavior is changed so greatly, that oil demand will never catch up to 2019 levels.\n\nThe moves I am examining is SCO (Inverse oil ETF), for both perspectives. Here are a few plays:\n\n***A. Oil Bull***\n\n1. Low Risk - SCO Call Credit Spreads - Now, low risk is all relative, but a nice credit spread (When IV is as high as it is ~150) would benefit from a further regression to the mean (~50) + oil price continuing to recover. If we wind up in a low-movement situation, you still collect premium on theta decay.\n\n2. Medium Risk - SCO Put Debit Spreads - Same idea as above, but with greater max returns. You are now fighting IV, but, there is still a long way left for SCO to drop if oil climbs back to 30, 40, 50. \n\n3. JTTT Risk - Far OTM FD Puts on the notion that the economy will restart quicker than we can produce (it takes a long time to bring capacity back after you shut it off). This skyrocketing in oil prices would mean a cratering of SCO.\n\n\n***B. Oil Bear:***\n\n1. Low Risk - SCO Shares - averaging into a position starting Monday and going through Wednesday, expecting fireworks during the June WTI contract expiration. Taking profits as early as Friday 15th / Monday 18th depending on movement. May hold through the next several weeks if it seems we will lockdown again. If there is limited movement, exiting as appropriate.:\n\n2. Medium Risk - looking at another drop in oil going through the contract expiration and / or news of further lockdown (bzw. further near term demand reduction). Call Debit Spreads.\n\n3. JTTT Risk - Far OTM FD Calls on the notion that the economy is fucked and demand will remain low on further lockdowns + oil producers have not reduced production enough, and a contract expiration event will lead to negative prices again. \n\n***C. Playing Volatility:***\n\n1. Looking back two months (March) we see an IV spike due to the Saudi / Russia Oil Crisis. Looking back one month, we see the May WTI contract expiration (IV went to 400). We can build out a straddle, if we think the market is going to come to make a big move at some point soon.\n\nSCO is not super high volume on options, but there is enough reactivity to pricing changes of oil that I find this ETF worth creating plays for. Remember this when you look at strange dates + strikes -&gt; Don't build something out that looks amazing on a calculator, only to find yourself stuck. Find expiration dates with higher volume, and round strike prices to ensure someone out there will buy it from you once you've juiced it.",

In this book, he describes the rise and fall of empires and tries to model archetypical sequences of such events.\n\nHe is currently releasing chapters for free outlining the study and giving an introduction to the topic and some context to the important concepts he will later use. ([Link to articles](https://www.principles.com/the-changing-world-order/))\n\nIn the latest article, he is explaining the debt cycles and how they work.   \n\n\nShort-term deb cycle: smaller economic expansions and contractions which typically last around 8 years.\n\nLong-term debt cycle: big economic contractions and debt-restructuring like the great depression.\n\nVideo made by him explaining this much more eloquently than I ever could: [Click here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHe0bXAIuk0)\n\n**Main point:**\n\nReading through the article I stumbled upon this gem about when the long-term debt cycle is ending:\n\n&gt;More specifically, the ability of central banks to be stimulative ends when the central bank loses its ability to produce money and credit growth that pass through the economic system to produce real economic growth.\u00a0 \n\nThis is very much in line with what we are seeing right now. Asset prices go up but the economy is not really \"stimulated\". \n\nWhat are your thoughts on this?",

        "selftext": "**TLDR: Stocks will go up for the rest of the year in 2020 retesting January highs.**\n\nSeverely disillusioned bearfag here who bagholded worthless puts to the end. \n\nI came to this depressing conclusion after I did some basic math and (questionable) analysis under the influence of alcoholic beverages.\n\nGoing through the statistics of covid, nearly 99% of deaths are above 45+ yo, of which over 88% are over 65+ yo. This is a fact and we can be statistically confident that its going to stay that way unless the virus mutates into something more deadly that affects even younger age groups (extremely unlikely). \n\nCoupled with trumpbux + savings due to not paying for transport, restaurants, coffee, etc, the younger generation are building up quite a war chest to unleash into the economy once they are set free from the lockdown. Sure, some may even have large windfalls of inheritance money, but I am not sure how big the effect will be since there is no data on this.\n\nJudging by how stocks have been going up despite all the negative doomsday tier signs, I can only assume all this money is slowly being pumped into stocks right now. Once the lockdown is lifted this summer, I suspect there will be a huge bump in spending again in the economy which will (as much as I hate to admit) indeed lead to a \"V\" shaped recovery for Q2 and Q3. Sure, there may be a rise in infections, which may spook the markets temporarily, but people who are at high risk from covid won't be going out anyway. Hence we will generally see a gradual decline in deaths over the summer, which is sadly extremely bullish.\n\nWhat about the millions of unemployed, you may ask? Good question. However, I think the market honestly doesn't care at this point since its priced in that effect and looking ahead at growth 1 - 2 years from now. Maybe they'll all get their jobs back within a few months. Maybe they'll be reclassified as \"employed\" even if they do just 1 hour of gig work a week. I don't know. Statistics can and will be fudged to make the market happy.\n\nWhat about commercial real estate? Another good question. Its yet to be seen how deep this work from home trend sinks in for companies to decide to ditch the office altogether. Bearing in mind that a lot of office leases are 3-5 years long on average, its a bit hard legally for a company to just cancel their contracts this year even if they wanted to.\n\nSo summing up, I think theres a real possibility of the markets retesting the highs of January just before the US election in November.  By that time, its quite possible we may even have a vaccine ready considering every scientist and biotech firm in the world is highly motivated to get one out ASAP. Regardless of whether the vaccine ultimately works or not is irrelevant. The mere announcement of a vaccine is enough to pump the markets on hopium for the rest of the year.\n\nOf course, I am ignoring other possible black swans like another debt crisis or the dollar collapsing  due to all this \"money printing\". But those  theories are generally promoted by the perma-doomer crowd who have predicted 20 of the last 3 recessions this 21st century. Compared to a government that controls [6185 nukes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_and_weapons_of_mass_destruction), a [frikkin railgun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2QqOvFMG_A), and (possibly) [advanced UFOs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auITEKd4sjA), I think I will cautiously side with the latter on this one.",

        "selftext": "First is MVIS' interactive display.  Here it is [being demonstrated at CES 2020 where it won an award](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcVeSz4c7io).\n\nIt is a MEMS laser scanning projector with lidar (3D sensing) built in.  Both the projector and lidar use the same MEMS mirror.  To project the image, a MEMS mirror scans an always in focus beam of light generated by just 3 laser diodes (RGB).  The beam of light is rastered back and forth at incredible speed over a field of view.\n\nTo make the image interactive using lidar, a 4th laser diode (invisible IR) is added to the RGB beam along with a single photodetector.  All 4 scanned are by the MEMS mirror into the desired field of view.\n\nThis product was expected to be launched in 2020 by a Tier 1 OEM, believed to be Amazon.  On February 25, 2020, MVIS announced that the OEM decided not to launch in 2020 for unstated reasons.  Considering the Covid-19 lockdowns that followed immediately, it seems likely that the delay/cancellation was related.  Regardless, the company was forced to cut staff and explore other strategic alternatives and sources of cash for 2020.  The share price crashed immediately to all-time lows.\n\nThe video above includes discussions of other current and near term applications of MVIS MEMS scanning technology, including consumer lidar and automotive lidar.  These are described elsewhere as best in class in terms of range, resolution, lack of motion blur, ability to zoom in and out, etc.\n\nThey do not talk about AR or Hololens 2, likely due to NDA restrictions.\n\nThe video does not mention another MVIS product, an even tinier 720p laser projector based on the same technology that can be embedded into a smartphone.  It was launched in a 3rd tier Chinese smartphone in 2017, the [Voga V](https://www.google.ca/search?q=voga+v&amp;sxsrf=ALeKk03PbQ7Ve5y4wsGKwJWy5aUfm_P2VQ:1588437576405&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwi42vSLz5XpAhXHbc0KHSsrCFkQ_AUoA3oECAwQBQ&amp;biw=1242&amp;bih=554).  The [projector received excellent reviews](https://www.techradar.com/reviews/voga-v) but the phone was substandard and failed.   Here it is [in action](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aknykPZykeQ)\n\nLook at the size of the image at time 2:30 and on.  For reasons beyond my grasp, the major phone OEMS have not yet incorporated the technology though their patents often refer to it.\n\nMVIS reported in 2018 that its new MEMS scanner and ASICs provide resolution up to 1440p at 120Hz.  It is believed that this scanner is driving the Hololens 2 display. \n\nNote, all scan lines in videos are not visible in person.  They are a result of the refresh rates of the camera and projector not being synchronized.\n\nMy opinion:  this company is a diamond in the rough with a depressed share price due to current circumstances (including facing a reverse split due to being below the Nasdaq minimum $1 bid price) and a very long (25 year) history of slow but steady technology development at the incredible cost of $600M-$1B which has worn down generations of now exhausted shareholders.  It is facing short term cash needs and market disruptions aggravated by the coronavirus pandemic. \n\nFULL DISCLOSURE:  I am one of those long term shareholders, so I am obviously interested in the share price rising.  Therefore, read this with that in mind.",

        "selftext": "Boy, the parchment bear market during the Mongolian Sack of Baghdad was a doozy. I've seen them all, so let me tell you what will happen next. Before I do, though, I need to scold you a little bit first. I tried engaging with you tards [once before](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fjlaby/20002008_trading_veteran_here_this_is_what/), but you were so goddamn mean and ungrateful that I've decided to come back and try again because I'm a glutton for misery just like the rest of you.\n\nNow, what I had tried to do in my previous post was to *entertain* you a little bit, and to also actually warn you about an incoming bear market rally, the likes of which we haven't seen since we, uh, last saw one, um, like it. But *noooooo*, you ungrateful little Beliebers voted up a comment that said there was literally nothing of value in that post, and then I had, tbh, a little satisfaction watching many of you stare in disbelief at The Giant Green Dildo of a 5-week rally rising up out the grave that was March. Ermagerd, someone in that last post even scoffed at the idea of a big rally by quipping: \"Where were you Friday?\" lolololol As if that little into-the-close-short-covering on the 13th was what I had in mind. Nah, son, I meant *a* *rally*. (Here, hold on, lol, Textedit in MacOS isn't marking \"ermagerd\" as a typo, lol it's actually in the dictionary.)\n\nAt any rate, I've come back now, having now just dusted off my useless humanities degree to try to bring you a little more entertainment, if any of you savages are capable of so being entertained by some colorful language. I'll add swear words and some porn this time, deal? (*Haha no I won't, automod thinks my first draft was uncivil*.) I might even get around to telling you [what you can expect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aUgwJukcBG4) in the coming weeks. Or I might just be *messing* (*guess what word that was in the first draft lol*) with you and will delight in having gotten you to read like a lot of words and stuff for nothing.\n\nNow I know all the bears are butthurt right now, but that's exactly what a bear market really has to do in order to come to an end. And yah, I think we're basically there. So bears, get unbutthurt. You guys f-- *bruised* yourselves because you were too impatient and thought the market could go to zero in a straight line. It also doesn't help that half of you were carefully nurtured in safe spaces while our generation was raised under the angry, disapproving stares of unforgiving parents who made everything smell like cigarettes. Now, if the bulls brainwashed you into thinking all time highs lol are possible despite what you're reading about the real economy, you need to fix that sh-- *stuff* in a hurry. We actually might be going to zero, but god-- *gollydarnits* not in a straight line.\n\nI'd give you guys some TA and Elliott Wave targets, but [Jesus H. Christ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-Ra1-_iHcA) you guys don't like crayons. What we're entering is a Wave 3, which is the biggest wave in magnitude. It will be composed of five waves itself (down, up, big, big oh-my-god down \\[3rd of 3rd\\], up, then down). It doesn't have to be the fastest, but it will be the longest, greatest in magnitude. Likely targets are as such: first wave down will get us around the March lows, then a rally (people will be saying, \"See! It's a double-bottom!! We retested the lows!\" lol, um no, not really, not at all). It *will be a rally*, yes, but not as big as the one we just had, not some five week crap. How long? I have no idea. Then the big oh-my-god moment, the wave 3 of 3. It, too will be composed of a 5-wave structure, but will land us around the 2007 highs, god knows where exactly, S&amp;P 500 1500-1700? Then we'll stop, people will say, \"There, *that's* the real bottom,\" and we'll have a long rally, I expect. I don't expect it to rise as high as this rally did, but it very well could last *longer* *in time*. That's the typical nature of a 4th wave. That will then peter out and we'll head to new and final lows. But this is a long time away: fall? Next winter? Hard to know from here. If you're not horrible to me, I'll come back later. (Or lol if I'm totally f-- *flipping* wrong I'll not.)\n\nNow, be patient with this market and you will have much fun. It stuns me how impatient some of you can be, but this is a good experience for you. Getting burned will make you patient, and before you know it, you'll be coaching younger, more retarded traders in the next bear market (like maybe 300 years from now after what remains of human life rises from the ashes of a total kinetic nuclear war that threatens over the horizon as the Boomers desperately try to preserve the US dollar's status as the world reserve currency). Too dark? Yeah, probably. \n\nI think my generation is also necessarily more patient because our access to pornography involved trying to obtain grainy photos of Cindy Crawford over dial-up for display on 16-color monitors. Jesus, that took *forever*. You guys can conquer the entire realm of Skyrim in like what, a month? Masters of an entire realm so quickly? You should have been there for AOL, it really was just awful.\n\nTake profits along the way, and Lord Have Mercy, while you're f-- *shaking hands politely* *with* this bull, she will buck those horns. The Boomers *will* try to save this. That will be those two rallies. I do not know what they will do to try to save it, but they will absolutely try to. QE Eternal Divine Quantum something, I don't know.\n\n*Do not be shocked if they shut the markets down*. This is going to f-- *upset* them ~~up~~. Now, if you're g-- *not straight* and selling premium, you'll be fine, but if you have short-dated puts, you're all f-- *tussled* up bad. Not a bad idea to try both (some puts and some bear call spreads). If they do shut it off, I don't expect it will be for more than a week. They will have to let people out, who want out, even at any price, eventually.\n\nI'm retarded too so I could also be wrong about all of this. I'm not a g-- *goldarmied* fortune teller or I wouldn't be here with you, but:\n\nTLDR; If we crash hard, I'll be grateful if the mods would flair me with something funny like \"Ok Doomer\"",

Employees are gone end of May, and wouldn't be able to be staffed until next budget, or some bill to refund inspectors.\n\nCedar Fair just posted a $1B bond because they have no cash left and are burning $30M a month. That bond is as big as their market cap and annual sales.  I should mention cedar point hires 1000 seasonal J1 Visa mostly from Europe as cheap help which Trump stopped. They can't even get usual Mexican migrant workers. (Not sure if there is enough jobless and college displaced to take up the slack)\n\nhttps://www.ocj.com/2020/05/crunch-time-for-ohios-fair-season/\n\n&gt;Howard Call, executive director of the Ohio Fair Managers Association (OFMA) testified before the Ohio Senate Agriculture &amp; Natural Resources Committee May 6... testified that the OFMA has obtained a document from the Ohio Department of Agriculture that abolishes the Amusement Ride Safety Division and Division of Fairs. In a statement, the Ohio Department of Agriculture said\u00a0COVID-19 has caused an unexpected and serious financial strain on their agency, making it necessary to reevaluate the entire budget and operation. . . making it necessary to lay off division staff until the industry is once again operating.\n\n\nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/quote/FUN?p=FUN&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch",

        "selftext": "*** DEDICATED TO THOSE WHO HAVEN\u2019T SEEN AN ECONOMIC (STOCK) CRISIS BEFORE *** \n\nWhen an athlete gets hurt, all they think about is the timeline for getting back on the field but not when the pain/injury will be over. The same goes for an injured economy: How long will it take to recover? Probably years.\n\nEconomists were hoping for a V-shaped economic recovery: a rapid slide down followed by a quick climb back. But many are scaling expectations back to a Nike swoosh-shaped recovery in which output may not return to pre-pandemic levels until late 2021 (or later). Even worse would be a W-shaped recovery, where the economy weathers one recession only to faceplant into a second. \u201cIf a second downturn were to flare up, it\u2019s far from clear that Congress would be ready to offer trillions more to enable businesses to survive yet another round of months-long shutdowns,\u201d the AP reports.  \n\n81% of small businesses think COVID-19 could impact them for 12\u201316 months. By some estimates, half of small businesses could fold within six, and laid off workers could require years to find new roles. More businesses are moving to permanent layoffs as they close factories and reduce operations. Manufacturing, which never returned to pre-2008 levels, is especially vulnerable. Between 2010 and 2019, the sector added 1.4 million jobs. In April, it lost 1.3 million (including temporary layoffs). The Becker Friedman Institute predicts that 42% of the layoffs will be permanent. Business closures also have upstream effects. Commercial real estate owners are expected to swallow big losses, then pass those up to banks when they can\u2019t make debt payments, which could push banks into failure. \n\nA recession\u2019s full effects can take years to ripple out. The Great Recession technically ended in June 2009, yet bank failures peaked in 2010. And as late as 2013, state and local governments were still slashing jobs.\n\nOf course, one wouldn't know any of this by looking at the stock market! What are your thoughts about it?\n\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/articles/why-the-economic-recovery-will-be-more-of-a-swoosh-than-v-shaped-11589203608?mod=hp_lead_pos1&amp;utm_source=morning_brew\n\nhttps://apnews.com/adab99c1d674ea016630103b4a66f5e8?utm_source=morning_brew\n\nhttps://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-usa-business/over-80-of-u-s-small-businesses-expect-longer-impact-of-pandemic-survey-idUSKBN22N1AV?utm_source=morning_brew\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/articles/factories-close-for-good-as-coronavirus-cuts-demand-11589122800?utm_source=morning_brew\n\nhttps://qz.com/1855033/furloughs-become-layoffs-tempering-coronavirus-economic-recovery/?utm_source=morning_brew\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/11/upshot/virus-lasting-economic-effects.html?utm_source=morning_brew",

Here are my predictions:\n\n* MRR for the next several quarters will be flat and may even decline\n   * Was $55mm as 1Q/20 compared to $54mm at the end of Q4/19\n   * Company already guided to headwinds from free trials but they expect this to pick back up again in 3Q once the trial period ends\n      * [How many of these stores will make it past the 90 day trial?](https://community.shopify.com/c/Feedback-On-My-Store/bd-p/ecommerce-gallery)\n   * I expect users to continue to downgrade in an effort to conserve cash or outright cancel\n* GMV will not stay at these elevated levels\n   * A majority of the categories mentioned on the call are one-time in nature (e.g. home, fitness, entertainment, leisure and hobby products)\n   * Food, beverage and tobacco product category most likely experienced a massive ramp in the first several weeks of April as buyers \"hoarded\" supplies\n   * Consumer discretionary spending will become more challenging over the coming months as the reality of this \"V\" shape recovery sets in\n* As expected, they just [issued a secondary](http://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001594805/20faef37-cde2-4aec-8b7d-8cbf2bf73c0d.pdf)\n   * Should marginally put pressure on the share price near-term\n* Ownership breakdown is really odd for a $85bn market cap company\n   * 65% owned by institutions, 10% by insiders and 25% by the public/retail\n      * CEO and a Director account for nearly all of the insider holdings\n      * COO owns a *total* of 78 shares, Chief Product Officer owns a *total* of 47 shares*,* CTO will own *zero* shares once his Intent to Sale goes through on June-1, Chief Legal Officer owns a *total* of 1 share, etc.\n   * I think the retail category can be sum up by yesterday's [Buy the Dip](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gerkgx/they_said_buy_the_dip/) post\n      * Sort by new and look at all the users absolutely having no idea what they're looking at but wanting in\n\nThese guys have never missed on earnings. Again, I believe even a quarter of flat/to declining growth will change the perception driving the stock down. Once that happens it's a race to the bottom. \n\n# TL;DR\n\nI still think the fundamentals of the [original thesis](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g6pehn/shopify_a_poor_mans_amazon/) hold true. Volatile stock that has little upside given recent massive run-up but major downside risk if they miss revenue growth.\n\n**Position: Jan 15 2021 300 P**\n\nOf note, the OI on this position has increased from \\~800 at the time of the original post to nearly 3k. \n\n*Disclaimer: On the prior post someone said logic does not apply to meme stocks and that ultimately may be the case here.

These shares, too, are randomly selected. The amount released by the sale is fully invested in the new share.\n\nJacko started investing in January 2000. At that time Jacko received 75 bananas, all of which corresponded to a fund listed on the Dutch stock exchange. The first ten bananas (corresponding to shares) formed his portfolio.\n\nSince then, Jacko randomly exchanges one share from his portfolio with a new share on a monthly basis, using bananas. The completely random choice of shares is central to this. After all, there is no information about the corresponding share in the bananas.\n\nJacko's analysis and stock/banana picking in action:  [Jacko doing deep DD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xujc2TkTYrM) \n\nSource (in Dutch):  [https://www.beursgorilla.nl/portefeuille/jacko.aspx](https://www.beursgorilla.nl/portefeuille/jacko.aspx)",

        "selftext": "Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/StockMarket. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning May 11th, 2020.\n\n# **Stocks are expected to trade the economy\u2019s reopening in the week ahead  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/08/stocks-expected-to-trade-the-economys-reopening-in-the-week-ahead.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Investors will watch the economy\u2019s reopening progress, as well as a series of economic reports in the coming week that will provide a look at the consumer during April as the economy shed 20.5 million jobs.\n*****\n&gt; Fed Chairman Jerome Powell speaks on a webcast held by the Peterson Institute on Wednesday at 9 a.m., and he will be watched closely for any new insights on the economy or Fed programs.\n*****\n&gt; There are just a few earnings releases ahead, but there will be a barrage of economic reports, including consumer and producer inflation, consumer sentiment and most importantly retail sales on Friday. \n*****\n&gt; # Stocks versus bonds\n&gt; Stocks were higher in the past week, even as some bond yields touched record lows. Yields move opposite price, and bonds usually move opposite stocks.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe stock market is trading the reopening, and the bond market is doubting the vibrant pace of an economic recovery upon the reopening,\u201d said Peter Boockvar, chief investment strategist at Bleakley Advisory Group.\n*****\n&gt; Small cap stocks and tech led the way higher in the past week. The Nasdaq jumped 6% in a week, where it wiped out its losses for the year and turned positive. The small cap Russell 2000 was up 5.5%.\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 was up 3.5% for the week to 2,929, with tech up 6.6% and consumer discretionary stocks up 4.4%.\n*****\n&gt; The bond market and stock market have both responded to the Fed\u2019s programs that put more liquidity into the financial system, with bond rates falling and stocks rising sharply.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cStocks just seem to be disconnected from everything else,\u201d said Michael Schumacher, director rates at Wells Fargo. Some bond yields, like the benchmark 10-year yield, which impacts many types of loans, were slightly higher ahead of the Treasury\u2019s record $96 billion in auctions in the coming week. But the 2-year, at a new low of 0.10%, was trading on concerns about the economy.\n*****\n&gt; Market pros will look for Powell to comment on market speculation that the Fed could take its benchmark rate to a negative yield. Fed officials have said they have no interest in negative rates, which are being used by central banks in Europe and Japan. But for the first time this past week, traders drove futures on fed funds to show slightly negative rates in contracts starting in  November. \n*****\n&gt; \u201cHe could quash negative yields if he wants to,\u201d said Schumacher. \u201cThe Fed has consistently argued against negative policy rates. Now there\u2019s a chance Powell could comment on this. He\u2019s commented about it, several times in the last six months.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Much of the gains in the stock market have been driven by big technology companies with operations that haven\u2019t been deeply affected by the coronavirus.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cTech was the shutdown trade and small caps are the reopening,\u201d said Boockvar, noting small caps are domestically focused and are sensitive to the back-to-work trade.\n*****\n&gt; Apple joined the reopening trade Friday, when its stock rose after it announced it would reopen some of its U.S. stores.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe stock market has sort of a hall pass as the months proceed and things reopen. At some point, that hall pass is going to expire\u201d and the reopenings will have to result in rebound, Boockvar said.\n*****\n&gt; Investors have been watching for anything that suggests state reopenings are stimulating activity.\n*****\n&gt; Retail sales Friday will be a big focus and are expected to show sharp decline of 11%, but more like 6% when automobiles and gasoline are removed, he said.\n*****\n&gt; In the oil market in the past week, crude was up as much as 24% as traders reacted to information that showed gasoline demand picking up around the U.S. States have been opening up at different speeds, and California was the latest to reopen some activity Friday.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cSome of the reason the market is up because the virus curve is bending, the economic data is showing signs of a bounce. It hasn\u2019t here yet but you know it\u2019s coming. It\u2019s a global phenomenon,\u201d said James Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Leuthold Group. He noted that China\u2019s export numbers unexpectedly rose in April, for the first time this year.\n*****\n&gt; Paulsen said he expects stocks to remain in an upswing.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of value out there if you\u2019re outside the high growth in the S&amp;P 500,\u201d he said, \u201cWhen fear is as high as it is, that\u2019s typically been a great time to lean toward risk assets. Gold is at a 50-year high relative to commodity prices. People are buying bonds at virtually zero yield. To me, there\u2019s fairly defensive behavior and scared attitudes rather than the other way around.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Strategists say the market could retest its March lows, but a good number say the bottom has been set.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI\u2019m getting more confident that we\u2019ve seen the lows, and we\u2019re starting a recovery in the stock market, but I think the volatility is going to stay there, and there will be challenges. I think the general direction is up rather than down at the moment,\u201d said Paulsen.\n*****\n&gt; Paulsen said the fear of reinfection remains, should there be a new wave of the virus. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of terrible things that could happen and be terrible for the stock market,\u201d he said.  \u201cA headline could create an up or down week and then go away again. \u201d \n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think the rise in the stock market is really more about a lack of sellers. But I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a lot of buyers. If more people believed this is winding down ... there could be a  lot more money that\u2019s going to come back into equities, to some extent,\u201d Paulsen said.\n*****\n&gt; Market pros are keeping an eye on yields, ahead of the government\u2019s record sized $96 billion in auctions in the coming week for 3- and 10-year notes and 30-year bonds.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/4HGQyi7.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/2lmIrzt.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/eEihRrS.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/DR6SfIc.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/fXS8KN3.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/8V6CfZy.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/VHY2OWA.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/G3fxr2S.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/sx0HDsl.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/udABitD.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/zujuIT6.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/PxZA6w2.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Market Too Far Ahead of Economy?\n\n&gt; Another 3.2 million Americans filed for unemployment last week bringing the seven-week total to 33.5 million. This is an unprecedented streak for an unprecedented time, and it highlights the significant impact that the coronavirus pandemic shutdown is having. One small positive aspect of this week\u2019s number is the fact that it is a decline from the previous reading which lends further support to the possibility that the market\u2019s lows of March could be the bottom and that bottom could hold based upon the historical correlation of jobless claims and past market bottoms that we covered in a recent post.\n\n&gt; However, the seven-week total is an unsettling number that suggests the road back to \u201cnormal\u201d could be longer than the market appears to currently expect. It is getting increasingly more challenging to envision 33.5 million Americans returning to work as quickly as they left. And with NASDAQ returning to positive for the year in today\u2019s trading it may be time to wonder if the market\u2019s brisk recovery is possibly too far ahead of the actual economy.\n\n&gt; One early sign that the rally may be getting well ahead of the economy can be seen in the following chart of cumulative daily advance/decline lines for NYSE, NASDAQ, Russell 2000 and the S&amp;P 500. The recent trend since the end of April has been lower while the indexes have managed to move modestly higher. This suggests that fewer and fewer stocks are still participating in the rally. Historically when this persisted the major indexes frequently failed to move meaningfully higher and often turned lower.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/1ff6838e7d4a8493b62fad589a840223/2faca2fd2c71ed13-d0/s500x750/93ab9274fcf5f85882ed91b1eeb70ec5bcc54b88.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# Market Gains in Celebration of Mother\u2019s Day\n\n&gt; With just a few days remaining to Mother\u2019s Day, today\u2019s post is also a reminder. Over the last twenty-five years on the Friday before Mother\u2019s Day the Dow Jones Industrials have gained ground seventeen times. On the Monday after, DJIA has advanced seventeen times over the same time period. Average gain on Friday has been 0.20% and a respectable 0.36% on Monday. However, in five of the last eight years, the Monday following Mother\u2019s Day has been down. Last year, DJIA suffered its worst post Mother\u2019s Day loss, off 2.38%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/91ef736cb31d1b665b1933aa28dc680c/577c38f8de114a58-46/s500x750/e29f63d6af8b2ae4a172b03a5a3ba2af28fe345b.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# Group Breadth Improving From a Record Low Base\n\n&gt; After a disastrous late February and early March period, breadth among S&amp;P 500 groups cratered to the point where not a single one of the S&amp;P 500's 24 industry groups were above their 50-day moving average. Before the most recent occurrence, that's something we hadn't seen since early 2019.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/05/050820-Groups-above-520DMA.png))**\n\n&gt; While there have been numerous instances in the last few years where every industry group was below its 50-DMA, the most recent period was unique in that it lasted more than four full weeks (21 trading days). Going all the way back to 1990, there has only been one other period where every industry group was below its 50-day moving average for as long as it just was. That was during the depths of the financial crisis in the 21-day stretch ending 11/3/08. It took a bear market of more than a year to finally reach that level back then, but this time around, it took less than two months. Besides that period, there has never been another four-week stretch where every industry group was below its 50-day moving average.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/05/050820-Groups-above-520DMA-Streaks.png))**\n\n&gt; Overall breadth readings have already improved in terms of industry groups above their 50-day moving averages, but at this point, the number of industry groups with rising 50-day moving averages remains extremely depressed at just 8.3% as of midday Friday. Similar to the streak above, during the most recent period every group had a declining 50-day moving average for 26 straight days, and that was also the longest such streak since 2008. Granted, this is a lagging indicator and should improve the longer equities remain around current levels, but it once again serves as a reminder of how steep the declines actually were.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/05/050820-Groups-rising-50DMA.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Sector Relative Strength\n\n&gt; Although the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) is down around 1% over the past week, there are two sectors that have made a push higher: Communication Services (XLC) and Technology (XLK). While these moves have left both sectors in overbought territory, a snapshot from our Trend Analyzer tool shows that Tech's rally has brought it into the green YTD.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/05/050720-TA.png))**\n\n&gt; Technology's outperformance is nothing new. As shown in the relative strength charts from our Sector Snapshot below, Technology has been a serial outperformer versus the S&amp;P 500 for pretty much all of the past year (a rising line indicates outperformance versus the S&amp;P 500 and vice versa). As for the other sectors, Health Care has also seen some drastic outperformance over the past few months. Communication Services and Consumer Discretionary have also seen some outperformance in recent weeks. Contrary to Technology, Energy, Financials, Industrials, and Materials have all been consistent underperformers over the past year.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/05/RS.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Performance on Earnings Days\n\n&gt; Roughly 1,300 companies have reported since the start of earnings season on 4/13 when the first of the big banks kicked things off. For those stocks that have beaten EPS estimates, the reaction has not been as strong as past years with just a 9 bps difference between this earnings season and all seasons since 2001. On the other hand, those that have missed EPS have not been as badly punished dropping 0.86% compared to an average drop of 3.56% since 2001. For all stocks, the average gain of 0.79% this earnings season is much stronger than the 0.06% gain of all other seasons.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/05/Earn-React-4.png))**\n\n&gt; With stock price reactions being generally positive this season, most of the gain has come at the open. Stocks reporting earnings have gapped up an average of 1.24%. But intraday they have tended to sell-off, averaging a 0.44% decline from open to close.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/05/Earn-React-2.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending May 8th, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-I3PBvQBrQ))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 5.3.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DciOIqiGJBs))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$UAA** \n&gt; * **$AMAT** \n&gt; * **$CLF** \n&gt; * **$MAR** \n&gt; * **$CSCO** \n&gt; * **$CPE** \n&gt; * **$JD** \n&gt; * **$INO** \n&gt; * **$KOS** \n&gt; * **$ON** \n&gt; * **$TLRY** \n&gt; * **$CAH** \n&gt; * **$ACB** \n&gt; * **$AN** \n&gt; * **$WIX** \n&gt; * **$SDC** \n&gt; * **$GBDC** \n&gt; * **$NCLH** \n&gt; * **$DUK** \n&gt; * **$NBEV**\n&gt; * **$ICPT** \n&gt; * **$SPG** \n&gt; * **$CYBR** \n&gt; * **$DDOG** \n&gt; * **$CEVA** \n&gt; * **$MYL** \n&gt; * **$CHH** \n&gt; * **$HMC** \n&gt; * **$ET** \n&gt; * **$LOGI** \n&gt; * **$OAS** \n&gt; * **$NVAX** \n&gt; * **$ZBH** \n&gt; * **$PRTK** \n&gt; * **$ABUS** \n&gt; * **$GWPH** \n&gt; * **$VCTR** \n&gt; * **$SALT** \n&gt; * **$WVE** \n&gt; * **$GNC** \n&gt; * **$AMRX** \n&gt; * **$ETR** \n&gt; * **$NOG**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/sx0HDsl.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/SeXyhoI.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE MONDAY'S OPEN!](https://i.imgur.com/dp54bLF.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 5.11.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/NOhb3L5.png))\n\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 5.11.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/GVcHqQw.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/II5ukMy.png))\n\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 5.12.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/1RbrpI3.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 5.12.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/FrASNRG.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 5.13.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/tZs8hms.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 5.13.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/GwtxPwV.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 5.14.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/jUwjUuj.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 5.14.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/s2yx68v.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 5.15.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ofgb6gF.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 5.15.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ofgb6gF.png))\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Under Armour, Inc. $9.98\n&gt; **Under Armour, Inc.

        "selftext": " I pasted [the article](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2020/05/07/the-market-v-the-real-economy), to exempt you from registering an account to read it. What do you think?\n\n##Financial markets have got out of whack with the economy. Something has to give\n\nSTOCK MARKET HISTORY is packed with drama: the 1929 crash; Black Monday in 1987, when share prices lost 20% in a day; the dotcom mania in 1999. With such precedents, nothing should come as a surprise, but the past eight weeks have been remarkable, nonetheless. A gut-wrenching sell-off in shares has been followed by a delirious rally in America. Between February 19th and March 23rd, the S&amp;P 500 index lost a third of its value. With barely a pause it has since rocketed, recovering more than half its loss. The catalyst was news that the Federal Reserve would buy corporate bonds, helping big firms finance their debts. Investors shifted from panic to optimism without missing a beat.\n\nThis rosy view from Wall Street should make you uneasy (see article). It contrasts with markets elsewhere. Shares in Britain and continental Europe, for example, have recovered more sluggishly. And it is a world away from life on Main Street. Even as the lockdown eases in America, the blow to jobs has been savage, with unemployment rising from 4% to about 16%, the highest rate since records began in 1948. While big firms\u2019 shares soar and they get help from the Fed, small businesses are struggling to get cash from Uncle Sam.\n\nWounds from the financial crisis of 2007-09 are being reopened. \u201cThis is the second time we\u2019ve bailed their asses out,\u201d grumbled Joe Biden, the Democratic presidential candidate, last month. The battle over who pays for the fiscal burdens of the pandemic is just beginning. On the present trajectory, a backlash against big business is likely.\n\nStart with events in the markets. Much of the improved mood is because of the Fed, which has acted more dramatically than other central banks, buying up assets on an unimagined scale. It is committed to purchasing even more corporate debt, including high-yield \u201cjunk\u201d bonds. The market for new issues of corporate bonds, which froze in February, has reopened in spectacular style. Companies have issued $560bn of bonds in the past six weeks, double the normal level. Even beached cruise-line firms have been able to raise cash, albeit at a high price. A cascade of bankruptcies at big firms has been forestalled. The central bank has, in effect, backstopped the cashflow of America Inc. The stockmarket has taken the hint and climbed.\n\nThe Fed has little choice\u2014a run on the corporate-bond market would worsen a deep recession. Investors have cheered it on by piling into shares. They have nowhere else good to put their cash. Government-bond yields are barely positive in America. They are negative in Japan and much of Europe. You are guaranteed to lose money by holding them to maturity, and if inflation rises the losses would be painful. So stocks are appealing. By late March prices had fallen by enough to tempt the braver sort. They steeled themselves with the observation that much of the stockmarket\u2019s value is tied to profits that will be made long after the covid-19 slump has given way to recovery.\n\nTellingly, though, the recent rise in share prices has been uneven. Even before the pandemic the market was lopsided, and it has become more so. Bourses in Britain and continental Europe, chock-full of troubled industries like carmaking, banking and energy, have lagged behind, and there are renewed jitters over the single currency (see article). In America investors have put even more faith in a tiny group of tech darlings\u2014Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Microsoft\u2014which now make up a fifth of the S&amp;P 500 index. There is little euphoria, just a despairing reach for the handful of businesses judged to be all-weather survivors.\n\nAt one level, this makes good sense. Asset managers have to put money to work as best they can. But there is something wrong with how fast stock prices have moved and where they have got back to. American shares are now higher than they were in August. This would seem to imply that commerce and the broader economy can get back to business as usual. There are countless threats to such a prospect, but three stand out.\n\nThe first is the risk of an aftershock. It is entirely possible that there will be a second wave of infections. And there are also the consequences of a steep recession to contend with\u2014American GDP is expected to drop by about 10% in the second quarter compared with a year earlier. Many individual bosses hope that ruthless cost-cutting can help protect their margins and pay down the debts accumulated through the furlough. But in aggregate this corporate austerity will depress demand. The likely outcome is a 90% economy, running far below normal levels.\n\nA second hazard to reckon with is fraud. Extended booms tend to encourage shifty behaviour, and the expansion before the covid crash was the longest on record. Years of cheap money and financial engineering mean that accounting shenanigans may now be laid bare. Already there have been two notable scandals in Asia in recent weeks, at Luckin Coffee, a Chinese Starbucks wannabe, and Hin Leong, a Singaporean energy trader that has been hiding giant losses (see article). A big fraud or corporate collapse in America could rock the markets\u2019 confidence, much as the demise of Enron shredded investors\u2019 nerves in 2001 and Lehman Brothers led the stockmarket down in 2008.\n\nThe most overlooked risk is of a political backlash. The slump will hurt smaller firms and leave the bigger corporate survivors in a stronger position, increasing the concentration of some industries that was already a problem before the pandemic. A crisis demands sacrifice and will leave behind a big bill. The clamour for payback will only grow louder if big business has hogged more than its share of the subsidies on offer. It is easy to imagine windfall taxes on bailed-out industries, or a sharp reversal of the steady drop in the statutory federal corporate-tax rate, which fell to 21% in 2017 after President Donald Trump\u2019s tax reforms, from a long-term average of well over 30%. Some Democrats want to limit mergers and stop firms returning cash to their owners.\n\nFor now, equity investors judge that the Fed has their back. But the mood of the markets can shift suddenly, as an extraordinary couple of months has proved. A one-month bear market scarcely seems enough time to absorb all the possible bad news from the pandemic and the huge uncertainty it has created. This stock market drama has a few more acts yet.\u25a0",

        "selftext": "Okay fellow autistic bears of WSB here you go.\n\nNow that we\u2019re starting to reopen brick and mortar across the nation and the first news of second wave is finally starting to emerge across Europe and Asia, I\u2019m finally confident enough to release my research. \n\nExpress Inc. the store you always walked by in the mall that triggered PTSD of a time you were able to get into a slim fit v neck and slug Red Bull vodkas down while listening to DJ Paully D. I think it\u2019s finally time to put the nail in this one. \n\nSales:\nWe\u2019re all smart enough to see the writing on the wall. With 300+ stores closed across the nation, the primary driver of sales for Express has been decimated (similar to all retail chains who\u2019s primary focus are not online). Second wave will be touch and go around states causing uncertainty in projected sales as foot traffic will be uncertain as states continue to figure out their return to normal. With the kind of clothing they sell, most people try before they buy, this could also increase cost of inventory for constantly having to sanitize products in store, or increase inventory costs from constant back and forth from online returns.\n\nSecondly, let\u2019s look at the target market for Express clothes. Their product is mainly focused around businesses and casual wear. Considering there\u2019s a large movement towards WFH, I don\u2019t see many people buying dress shirts, pants etc. On the casual side, bars and restaurants will be the last to open. As less people will be dressing for a night out, I see another major dent in sales. \n\nExpress have turned to online sales to generate revenue. However, they\u2019re a discretionary product. They state in the risks portion of the 10-K they\u2019re facing heavy competition from online retailers and lower priced product (like an H&amp;M). Substitute goods.\n\nAlso, net sales have been flat or going down since 2015.\n\nProduct:\nExpress relies 100% on manufacturing from both Asia and South America. This means that they could face major supply interruptions as COVID starts to spread in South America and continues to persist in Asia. To top this, Express\u2019 distribution, manufacturing and shipping are 100% outsourced. You may think well, less overhead, which is a fair point, but to be at the mercy of the supply chain may result in reputation damage and lost sales. \n\nThere\u2019s a fair bit more on their product side exposure if you have a look at the 10-K.\n\nAssets:\nAs the company leases most store space, it doesn\u2019t have hard assets like brick and mortar to sell off and raise cash.\n\n60% of its total assets are a \u201cRight of Use Asset\u201d which funnily just popped up on the Balance Sheet this year and is a lessees right to use an asset over the life of the asset. Not much in the financials about what it is, but I\u2019m calling BS on that having much value when brick and mortar isn\u2019t attractive and no business are looking to pick up leases. Get ready for that to be impaired into the ground.\n\nOther assets are small cash and clothes ... which lord only knows who\u2019s buying a 60 dollar button down with 30M unemployed. \n\nLiabilities:\nObviously major liability is leases which ST is about equal to all their ST assets. Sure they\u2019ll manage to negotiate, but again, that costs money. Also long term lease liabilities, which oh funny enough is the same amount as the Right of Use Asset. So they\u2019re balance sheet less that one accounting for leases is 800M half of which is going to ST liabilities.\n\nStock Price:\nOkay I\u2019m getting tired but I think we\u2019re starting to get the point. It\u2019s been going down like your girlfriend for the past 5 years. In one of their recent disclosures they issued preferred shares, which I think means further dilution. \n\nThe CEO in the 8-k filed recently mentioned they\u2019re furloughed employees and trying to reduce expenses, but let\u2019s be real, they were headed to penny stock land or bankruptcy long before COVID. This is just the last nail in the coffin.\n\nEarnings for Q2 are going to be terrible, which surely in the limbo stick analyst world will screw me short term as \u201cit wasn\u2019t as bad as expected\u201d is apparently a new acceptable normal. I\u2019m a believer this one is done long term, even if the second wave isn\u2019t as bad as I predict.\n\nOptions noob, but I can\u2019t short. Do your own research, this is NOT investment advice.\n\nEXPR $3p 10/16\n\nPS for all you \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b Trump\u2019s gonna get beer flu in a week, but your SPY 240p 5/15 will be dead before he is.",

        "selftext": "Disclaimer, this is going to be a long message.\n\nWith the oil market gone mad recently, I would like to have some insights from someone who is on the field. FYI, I have never worked in/with the oil industry, but as an opportunistic and enthusiastic learner, I would like to know what it takes to pull off a deal that would allow one to get paid for taking delivery of WTI crude oil.\n\nSo here are my thoughts and interrogations. Some of my questions can overlap with each other but anyway. All of them can be summed up in one question: \"If the same scenario of negative price occurs again in May for June's contract, how to proceed if I want panicked CL owners to pay me to take delivery of their crude oil? Then come the second top level question, how do I actually take delivery of this crude oil?\"\n\nBut let's try to break this down into more elementary questions that have risen along my readings on the internet.\n\n1. First about the delivery process. I don't understand very well how roles are split between different actors.\n\n1)a) In CL contract specs, they talk about a Clearing House. What is it exactly? A quick tour on Google brought me to Oil &amp; Gas Asset Clearinghouse, is that the one? Is there an only one Clearing House?\n\n1)b) Referring to that CL contract again, it's written that \"The Clearing House shall allocate Delivery Notices and Notices of Intention to Accept by matching size of positions to the extent possible\". Do I understand right if I say that it's the Clearing House that puts, nominatively, a bid in front of an ask? Isn't it up to the financial market to do that?\n\n1)c) Apparently, some margin shall be submitted so the transaction can occur. What they call a margin in this CL contract is like a deposit, am I correct? Under which form this deposit has to be done? Money? How much? The equivalent of the whole transaction? Can you enlighten me about this margin thing? Especially when prices are negative, how this margin works?\n\n1)d) Still in CL contract, they mention two companies: Enterprise Products Partners L.P. and Endbridge Pipeline (Ozark) LLC. Are they the only one companies handling pipelines and deliveries for CL contracts? Do they handle storage as well?\n\n1)e) Are those two companies considered FCM? Or are FCM's completely different actors? How do FCMs interface with the Clearing House and the two companies mentioned in 1)d) ?\n\n1)f) Can you explain me the difference between book-out, in-tank transfer and in-line transfer please? I'm definitely not familiar with those terms.\n\n1)g) I read somewhere that delivery shall be made in accordance with all applicable Federal executive orders and all applicable Federal, State and local laws and regulation. Where can I find all those orders, laws and regulation?\n\n1)h) Could you point me toward a FCM company?\n\n1)i) What is the minimum amount of barrels required to be purchased so one can proceed to a delivery? I\u2019m guessing that FCM/Clearing House/CME/Pipeline companies/Funds (big or small) won\u2019t be interested in small transaction? What\u2019s the smallest they toletate? I'd like to have an idea of the kind of money we are talking about.\n\n1)j) CL contracts deal with WTI Light Sweet Crude Oil that is delivered to Cushing. Does this mean that WTI Light Sweet Crude Oil cannot be delivered anywhere else? Is any other type of crude delivered to Cushing?\n\n2. Then, relatively to storage itself, I can't find any clear picture of storage capacity, that's  \nquite confusing\n\n2)a) I thought that the US Gulf coast is now equipped with plenty of storage capacity, like 55% of US capacity (in Houston, LOOP in Louisiana...). How come everyone talks about storage issues in Cushing? It feels like there is only Cushing in the US (only 13% of storage capacity). Isn't it possible to transfer that glut of oil to storage farms elsewhere?\n\n2)b) Is it really an issue of storage shortage or is it more about midstream infrastructures (I mean for transportation) not being able to keep up with this abundance of crude?\n\n2)c) What regulatory requirements do storage facilities have to meet? Where can I find them?\n\n2)d) What if I decide to store the crude abroad? Will US authorities have a say in the regulatory requirements met (or not...) by the facility receiving the crude?\n\n2)e) Is there an easy way to get the big picture/map of storage capacity in the US, in the Caribbean, in Central and South America?\n\n3. About the trading/acquisition of barrels on financial markets aspects; I believe not  \nanybody can buy CL contracts (therefore purchase barrels) on classic financial markets  \nwith classic brokers.\n\n3)a) How to get access to this kind of transactions? I assume they are only large scale transaction aren\u2019t they?\n\n3)b) I didn't understand very well the difference between CME Globex and CME ClearPort... What use to do of those two ones? I got the impression that I had to be on one of those two ones to trade CL contracts.\n\n3)c) How CME Globex and CME ClearPort are different from NYMEX? Isn't NYMEX supposed to be the exchange where CL contracts are traded?\n\n3)d) What is traded exactly? USO or CL contracts?\n\n3)e) I have identified some main stake holders from a financial/market point of view:\n\n\\-CME Group, apart from creating/emeting the CL contratcs and handling/supervising crude delivery in Cushing, what do they do?\n\n\\-USCF, which is a Fund that has created USO which is also a fund. If I understood correctly, USO shares are traded (under the form of an ETF) on NYMEX. This USO ETF is somehow (how?) related to CL contracts\n\n\\-This USO Fund would be managed by Bank of New York Mellon (BNYM). Why not directly by USCF?\n\n\\-ALPS, which is the distributing broker and handles the trading operation on the fund USO\n\n3)f)i)Did I get the whole picture in terms of main players involved?\n\n3)f)ii)Why does Bank of New York Mellon manage USO instead of USO itself or USCF?\n\n3)f)iii) How CME Group and their CL contracts on one hand, and USCF/USO/BNYM/ALPS on another hand are related?\n\n3)f)iv) Generally, can someone explain how all those players interact?\n\n3)f)v) If prices go negative again, and I want to get paid to get crude delivered so that I can store it somewhere, which of those players do I need to get in touch with?\n\n3)g) Is there any contract, other than CL of CME Group, that deal with WTI Light Sweet Crude Oil? Or do I have to assume that CME Group got the exclusivity on that type of oil?\n\n3)h) In case I can't (for some reason) buy a very big bundle of CL contracts to big players like institutional funds (USCF, etc), how would it be possible to buy as many CLs to different retailer traders, make it a whole bundle myself and proceed to one big delivery?\n\n3)i) USO has 30% of long CLs for June. What/Who is the second biggest detainers of CL contracts?\n\n3)j) I have read that CME can force USO to shut down because with 30% of the contracts, USO could go bankrupt and in the end CME would have to take all the deliveries attached to the contrats. How can CME force USO to close? What's the deal between the two them? How are they related?\n\nThanks for reading this until the end and thanks in advance for your answers.",

        "selftext": "This is as YOLO as it gets. You may very well lose all your money if you invest in this stock. CytoDyn (CYDY) is developing a monoclonal antibody that blocks the CCR5 receptor. The name of the drug is Leronlimab. HIV enters cells via the CCR5 receptor, so this is an anti-HIV drug. CYDY has a BLA filed with the FDA for approval of leronlimab and it is fast tracked, meaning the FDA should get back with its decision in the next 6 months. The drug has been used to treat over 800 HIV patients with no side effects. CYDY is also investigating leronlimab in treating triple negative breast cancer. Recently it discovered that leronlimab by blocking CCR5, it can also block a cytokine called RANTES that needs to use CCR5 to enter the cell. This cytokine is believed to be the principal one causing the inflammation in the lungs in Covid19. So CYDY is also pushing for leronlimab as a treatment for Covid19. Yes, that is right. This drug is a potential treatment for HIV, breast cancer, and Covid19. The clinical data in the field coming out now for treating Covid19 using leronlimab has been very positive. Unlike remdesvir, this drug has no side effects. The company will soon be publishing a paper in what is rumored to be the journal Nature with its findings, and a pre-print has been released here:  [https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-26517/v1](https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-26517/v1)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**I bought 5000 shares over the course of the last 2 days at an average cost of roughly $3.18.

        "selftext": "Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/StockMarket. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning May 4th, 2020.\n\n# **April\u2019s jobs report showing millions out of work looms large in the week ahead  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/01/aprils-jobs-report-showing-millions-out-of-work-looms-large-in-the-week-ahead.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Investors will focus on the slow reopening of the economy in the coming week, as Friday\u2019s dismal April employment report is expect to paint a frightening picture of the most rapid job losses in history.\n*****\n&gt; The unemployment rate is expected to jump from 4.4% to over 16.1% in April, the highest level since 1939, according to Dow Jones. Job losses are estimated to total 22 million, slightly below the entire number of jobs that were recovered since the Great Recession.\n*****\n&gt; Strategists said the market will likely be able to look past the terrible jobs number as it has done with most bad data, showing the results of a sudden and unprecedented shutdown of the economy.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think people are too gloomy about the unemployment situation. I think they think the unemployment rate is going to rise through the summer,\u201d said Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpont. \u201cI think the unemployment rate probably peaks in May.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Earnings season continues with dozens more companies reporting first-quarter results and talking about the impact of the virus and shutdowns on their businesses. So far, earnings appear to be down 12.7% in the first quarter, based on actual reports and estimates, according to Refinitiv. A diverse group of companies report, including Walt Disney, General Motors, CVS Health and Bristol-Myers Squibb.\n*****\n&gt; But investors are watching the restarting of the economy, now underway at some level in many states. \u201cIf they go well that\u2019s a good thing, but if in a week or two, you start to see some bad virus numbers, that\u2019ll be a blow to confidence,\u201d said Michael Schumacher, head of rate strategy at Wells Fargo.\n*****\n&gt; # Best April in years\nStocks started May with a sharp decline Friday, after a 12.7% gain in the S&amp;P 500 in April, its best month since 1987.\n*****\n&gt; Sam Stovall, CFRA chief investment strategist, said the market had been looking forward to the latest extension of fiscal stimulus, approved by Congress, and comments from the Fed, which reaffirmed after its meeting Wednesday that it will do whatever is needed to help the economy. \u201cNow there\u2019s not that much to look forward to,\u201d he said, adding the market would react negatively to any resurgence in the coronavirus outbreak.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe had a very nice April, the best April since 1938. May is sort of a ho-hum month,\u201d said Stovall. \u201cIt\u2019s in the bottom half in terms of average price change, slightly below average in terms of frequency of an advance. \u2026 Just looking at last year, May tends to digest April\u2019s gains.\u201d The S&amp;P 500\u2032s April gain was its best for the month in 82 years.\n*****\n&gt; # Virus economy\nEconomists and market strategists have been tracking the progress of the virus state by state, watching hospitalization rates, new cases and recoveries for clues on how quickly the economy might be able to restart. The economy is expected to have plunged into a deep recession in the second quarter, contracting by 35% or more, after a 4.8% decline in the first quarter.\n*****\n&gt; Stanley said he expects the unemployment rate to be a better-than-consensus 11.6% in April before it rises again in May. \u201cThis is all a stab in the dark,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think it\u2019s not going to come down as quickly as it went up,\u201d said Stanley. \u201cBut I do think you\u2019re going to see steady improvement. I think you\u2019re going to see millions of people brought back into the payrolls for several months in succession. I think we can get out of the double digits [unemployment] by the end of the summer.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Some workers are expected to return to their company payrolls as a result of the small business-focused Paycheck Protection Program, which encourages companies to keep workers on their payroll and bring back those who were cut. But that may not show up until May or June as a factor in the jobs data, Stanley said.\n*****\n&gt; Millions more are expected to have filed for unemployment claims in the week ending May 2, on top of the 30 million who filed in the previous six weeks. Economists say with such big unprecedented numbers, it is difficult to predict the unemployment rate since some people may have been temporarily unemployed and expect to return to work.\n*****\n&gt; But regardless, the number could be a shocker even though the market has shrugged off the big numbers of jobless claims and focused instead on the virus curve flattening.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think it could spook people,\u201d said Schumacher. \u201cIn the markets, we\u2019ve been watching the weekly claims, but everybody knows what unemployment is.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Stanley said he is also watching Tuesday\u2019s ISM nonmanufacturing data, a look at the services sector during April. A cross section of March data shows it was the services sector that took the biggest hit in the shutdowns, and it\u2019s unclear how quickly it can recover.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThere are people who will go and do things as soon as they\u2019re allowed to, and there are people who are going to stay home for a month or two longer,\u201d he said. \u201cI do think expecting we\u2019re going to pack 100,000 people into a football stadium in September is way too optimistic.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Stanley said some of the steep drop in consumer spending in March was the result of consumers stopping spending on health care, including elective surgery. That actually is an area that can bounce back quickly once the health care system is up and running for non virus related treatments.\n*****\n&gt; # A new 20-year bond\nThe Treasury could announce its new 20-year bond on Wednesday, when it discloses its quarterly refunding requirements, Schumacher said. He expects about $21 billion of the new 20-year to be issued in the second quarter.\n*****\n&gt; The amount of Treasury debt is expected to grow in the second quarter to help fund the growing deficit, made bigger by the trillions the government is spending to combat the virus.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe supply announcement we think is significant because you\u2019re going to see large auction increases, not just for one month but set in motion for many months to come,\u201d said Schumacher. He expects Treasury to announce $330 billion in notes and bonds in the refunding for the second quarter, up from $240 billion in the first quarter.\n*****\n&gt; Treasury bill issuance is expected at $1.9 trillion in the second quarter but Schumacher expects that to fall to $260 billion in the third quarter. The bills were used to give the Treasury cash to pay for emergency programs and more of that debt will move to long term debt.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/lucZqhO.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/ScMf5ki.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/lTrieA0.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/a6RSgrj.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/9mfZglW.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Rkt7Uup.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/8Ru9JJy.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/1L1YEEG.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/DwM4sys.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/OxcbRYQ.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/zvZWYtm.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/93bme56.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/b57XIzN.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# US Manufacturing Sector Has Entered a Deep Recession\n\n&gt; It is a foregone conclusion that the US economy has entered recession, led by the consumer, which accounts for more than two-thirds of the US economy based on gross domestic product (GDP). The collapse of consumer spending was evident in March personal consumption expenditures data released on Wednesday that showed a record 7.5% month-over-month drop in consumer outlays. It would have been worse if we weren\u2019t stocking our refrigerators and pantries.\n\n&gt; The manufacturing sector is also contracting sharply, not surprisingly given the business shutdowns that began in March. Investors had a glimpse of the extent of the hit to manufacturing in the business investment component of first quarter GDP, which revealed a sharp 8.6% annualized decline, durable goods orders for March, which fell 14.4%, and Markit\u2019s preliminary Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index (PMI) for manufacturing in April that came in at 36.9, a level consistent with a severe recession.\n\n&gt; Today\u2019s Institute for Supply Management (ISM) PMI for manufacturing\u2014the so-called official PMI\u2014provided more evidence of the depth of the manufacturing downturn. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the headline index fell 7.6 points to 41.5, better than Bloomberg\u2019s consensus forecast of 36, but a level consistent with prior recessions.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/ISM-Chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; But that\u2019s the good news. Peeling back the onion in this report reveals that the headline number was inflated by the supplier deliveries component. Normally, lengthening supplier delivery times reflect strong demand, which prevents suppliers from keeping up. However, in this environment, it reflects supply chain disruptions from lockdowns around the world related to COVID-19.\n\n&gt; The new orders and employment components of the report, which both fell more than 15 points to around 27, are better indicators of where manufacturing activity in the US is right now. The new orders number just missed the December 2008 level of 25.9, while the employment component hit its lowest level since 1949, putting the slump into proper perspective.\n\n&gt; \u201cThe more forward-looking components of the ISM report clearly indicate the manufacturing sector is in the midst of one of the sharpest contractions ever,\u201d said LPL Financial Equity Strategist Jeffrey Buchbinder. \u201cGiven the close relationship between manufacturing activity and corporate profits, the 25% cut to S&amp;P 500 earnings estimates for 2020 that we\u2019ve seen since March 1 is probably not enough.\u201d\n\n&gt; The ISM report points to a sharp upcoming drop in capital investment and a huge hit to earnings in the second quarter\u2014potentially down 40% year over year (FactSet consensus is calling for a 38% year-over-year decline in S&amp;P 500 earnings).\n\n&gt; Looking ahead, while the economic impact of the global lockdowns has been severe, we continue to be reassured by developing plans to reopen the economy, progress toward treatments and vaccines, and the resolve of Americans to get through this. We continue to expect a very strong rebound in manufacturing and the broad economy later this year.\n\n*****\n\n# Global Central Banks All In\n\n&gt; The Federal Reserve (Fed), the European Central Bank (ECB), and the Bank of Japan (BOJ) all met in the last week and while the show of power was minimal compared to recent weeks, they collectively reasserted their resolve to do whatever is necessary to support the global economy through the COVID-19 economic crisis. Rates are being held about as low as they can go, significant new programs to enhance market liquidity and support lending are in place, and, as shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, asset purchases have accelerated. In fact, with April not yet completed, central bank assets have risen over $3 trillion, the biggest two-month jump on record.\n\n&gt; \u201cThe central bank response to COVID-19 has been fast, effective, and built to impress,\u201d said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cAnd the market is seeing it. It\u2019s no coincidence that the market bottomed the day after the Fed rolled out a wide range of new programs addressing key areas of market and economic disruption.\u201d\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Blog-Chart-20-04-30.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Overview of Recent Central Bank Activity\n\n&gt; The Fed concluded its most recent two-day meeting on Wednesday, April 29. Prior to the meeting the Fed had expanded its program supporting municipalities by lowering the minimum size of the city or county to qualify. The Fed left its target rate unchanged at 0 \u2013 0.25%. Through its policy statement and Fed Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s comments, the Fed signaled that it is unlikely to remove its extraordinary policy support anytime soon, and we believe the Fed may hold its policy rate near zero into 2022. Asset purchases are currently open-ended and have expanded to include investment-grade and high-yield corporate exchange-traded funds.\n\n&gt; The BOJ met on Monday, April 27 and announced that it would lift its cap on buying government bonds, making purchases open ended, and triple the size of its corporate bond commercial debt purchases.\n\n&gt; The ECB met on Thursday, April 30 and announced new refinancing operations and that it would ease conditions on long-term loans to banks, encouraging banks to increase lending.\n\n&gt; With interest rates near zero, all major central banks have been expanding their economic support through new programs and increased asset purchases. Central bank are showing that in a time of crisis, their policy response is not limited to setting policy rates or even bond purchases. The expanded activity has all but eliminated the idea that the central banks are out of ammunition, both now and looking forward. There will come a time when these programs will end, balance sheets will unwind, and rates will rise. But until that time, central banks have shown that even prudent support in a time of economic distress is only limited by their imagination, keeping the old investing maxim \u201cDon\u2019t fight the Fed\u201d alive even in an age of zero rates.\n\n*****\n\n# Typical May Trading: A Month of Transition with Negative Predisposition\n\n&gt; Once again it is that time of the year where we increasingly see and hear \u201cSell in May.\u201d But when exactly in May is the \u201cbest\u201d time to sell? Based upon the last 21 years of data, the best time could be early in May. The month has opened well, on average, recently with strength on the first trading day and on the second trading day for the most part. Afterwards, DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ, Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 all tend to drift sideways to lower until around May\u2019s sixteenth trading day or so. It is on this day the NASDAQ and Russell 2000 begin to rally to finish the month. Beware though, this late-May rally typically fizzles before it can exceed the highs reached earlier in the month.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/1df0a9e6bf9c57baf44e6917725a0b23/49574a3950141284-4d/s500x750/4f224d3ee89c6ef6d69c08facbac61a77da3fd3b.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# This is Still an Election Year\n\n&gt; We have all been rather preoccupied with the coronavirus pandemic, market volatility and our individual situation. Meanwhile there is still a U.S. Presidential Election taking place this year. And folks are beginning to wonder what the next political alignment might be and the ramifications that alignment has had on the market historically.\n\n&gt; Six possible political alignments exist in Washington: Republican President with a Republican congress, Democratic congress or split Congress; and a Democratic President with a Democratic Congress, Republican Congress or split Congress. Data presented in the chart below begin in 1949 with the first full presidential term following WWII.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/dce5f19dd2ccfc16a4e0795dd5a11f68/8033867962439c40-45/s500x750/8543ffd66d568035ffa681a3d72b861c8f84b996.jpg))**\n\n&gt; Election years are traditionally up years. Incumbent administrations shamelessly attempt to massage the economy so voters will keep them in power. But sometimes overpowering events occur and the market crumbles, usually resulting in a change of political control.\n\n&gt; Republicans won in 1920 (DJIA -32.9%) as the post-war economy contracted and President Wilson ailed. The Democrats came back during the 1932 (-23.1%) Depression when the Dow hit its lowest level of the 20th century. A world at war and the fall of France jolted the market in 1940 (-12.7%), but Roosevelt won an unprecedented third term. Cold War confrontations and Truman\u2019s historic upset of Dewey held markets down through the end of 1948 (-2.1%). Recently the Great Recession and bear market of 2008 (-33.8%) helped put Obama and the Democrats back in the White House.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/fe57b47990e4b1b913e16595818a4df4/8033867962439c40-ea/s500x750/b5004568a1ca04f9004d23bd405de22f277408f2.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# 10-Day Advance/Decline Lines Running Hot\n\n&gt; The gains in the first half of the week lifted every sector but two\u2014Utilities and Financials\u2014above their 50-DMAs. Meanwhile, Health Care had even touched overbought territory (over 1 standard deviation above its 50-day) earlier in the week, making it the first sector to be overbought since late February.\n\n&gt; When it comes to another measure we monitor, the 10-day advance/decline line, conditions are more broadly appearing overbought. The 10-day advance/decline line measures the average number of daily advancers minus decliners in an index or sector over the last 10 trading days. Very high readings suggest that things have gotten extended in the very near term and downside mean reversion can be expected. Very low reading suggest the opposite.\n\n&gt; The 10-day A/D lines for sectors have been pretty strong recently indicating broad participation in the rally, but this has led these readings to become elevated indicating conditions may be running a bit too hot in the near term. Outside of the defensive sectors like Consumer Staples, Utilities, and Real Estate, every sector's 10-day A/D line has been in overbought territory at some point over the past week. The same can also be said for the 10-day A/D line for the S&amp;P 500. We'd note, though, that while A/D lines are extended, they're not at extreme levels seen at other points over the past year.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/05/10day.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending May 1st, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWpVmNiVbw4))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 5.3.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED!)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt;

        "selftext": "Hey everybody,   \nI'm a relatively new investor here with limited trading experience. I've been doing some independent research the past few weeks, and I have a good feeling about buying gold, namely royal canadian gold reserve certificates ([mnt.to](https://mnt.to)).   \n\n\nHere are some of my listed reasons for wanting to buy gold:\n\n1. There's a common sentiment that a V-shaped recovery won't happen, and that the market will instead form a second, likely deeper bottom than the one we've seen in March. This could cause many investors to flee to safe havens, such as the USD and/or Gold, causing an increase in price.\n2. Despite the fact that gold is now worth a bit over 1700 USD/Oz, I still think that Gold has a way to go before a reasonable peak. In 2008, Gold accelerated its bull run (probably because of the 2008 recession) which then peaked August 2011 at roughly 1778 USD/Oz. The S&amp;P500 also started a bull run that followed gold, but gold still significantly outperformed it before its own reversal. If gold were to reach this same peak this year, adjusted for inflation, it would go to 2034 USD/Oz. \n3. If we do experience a V-shaped recovery, I think that losses from holding Gold may be pretty minimal, in part due to a general sentiment that the market still might collapse. In fact, gold may still rise with the improvement of the economy as previously indicated from 2008 - 2011. \n4. There's a general sentiment that the housing market may collapse or fall a decent amount in Canada soon, since we have the highest household debt-to-income ratio than any other country in the world, and housing prices have ballooned out of control. Various banks such as CIBC and RBC have pretty high exposure to the mortgage market, which may lead to bigger nationwide problems which could lead to the fall of the CAD. Also, QE may lead to stagflation, devaluing the currency. So, buying gold would protect people from devaluation. \n\n  \nMy main priority with this investment is to preserve the value with the money that I currently own. Making a quick buck with speculative stocks would be nice, but I would rather focus on finding a way to guarantee buying power in these uncertain times.   \n\n\nIf there are significant reasons as to why I should not buy gold, please let me know. Thanks !",

If you don't have one, please move forward to register for the Autistic Placement Test at [www.UniversityOfAutism.edu/APtest/registration.](https://www.finra.org/registration-exams-ce/qualification-exams/series7)\n\nWe all know that stonk can fuck us in 3 ways: ~~pussy, anal, and oral~~. Up, Down, and Sideway. This rings my ball (a ~~small~~ nano one). Isn't this all just Quantum Physics?\n\nNow, for those who watched Ant-Man, all knows quantum physics in depth already. But, lets still review some basics.\n\n*\\[Physics\\]* When observing things, you are observing a reflection of electromagnetic wave bouncing off objects. So, basically, you cannot see something without touching one, and when you touch one, you change it. This phenomenon indeed has a name: **The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle.** \n\n*\\[Stock\\]* How does this apply to stock? The price of each stock and contract are floating between bid and ask spread. In order to know the true price of a stock, you must place your bid/ask, but this is essentially changing its price. I would like to call it: **The Autistic Gambling Principle.**\n\n\\----\n\n*\\[Physics\\]* So what is in a particle? We don't know! When you look closely, a particle is just a blurry sphere of influences that we know existed.\n\n*\\[Stock\\]* When you look into a stock, you would think it is constructed with some solid hard 10-K sheet, financial statements, and fundamentals. But, this is where you are wrong! A stock is just like particles. it is a sphere of influences that we only know existed but don't know what of.\n\n\\----\n\n*\\[Physics\\]* When scientist try to predict a particle with using Quarks, Leptons, and Bosons, they failed bad. Because they did not anticipate the stage itself, the gravity!\n\n*\\[Stock\\]* This is why many of the epic DD we see here failed so hard. They did not accounted for the almighty United State of America Federal Reserve System. (For those retarded fuck, this is the full name of \"Fed\" that you see in the shitpost here).\n\n\\----\n\n# Abstract:\n\nDON'T PANIC HERE! Be hold my autistic friends! The chosen one has already shared the ultimate solution for this fucked up situation. **The theory of everything - The String Theory.**\n\nString Theory is able to describe many particles as different modes of vibration of a string. Most importantly, this includes gravity.\n\n*\\[Stock\\]* In the name of Stonk God, here, I announce the era of **The Quantum Trading Theory**.\n\n# Chapter 1: Stonk Only Go Up\n\nLet me get this straight. Don't trust the title. stock DOES NOT go up. In fact, it wants to go flat or sideways. Why? Because, stock price is partially observed by crowd with using broker platform under masks (the bid/ask spread). And, its actual price is determined with trader spooking it constantly. When it is relaxed in a zero volume moment, the price will continue to be flat until someone try to unveil its true price.\n\nThis true nature helps the formation of the infamous **Theta Gang**. During a peaceful day, theta gang's win ratio is great because of the behavior describe above. When trading volume declines, it is the best to practice Theta Gang. While you can, you should also monitor volume constantly, in observation of the quickest tank that happened 2/19/2020. The volume dramatically doubled in two day, when this happens, dump all your shit and run. It is okay to take some loss. You will recover form the next move.\n\n# Chapter 2: F, The Fed Coefficient\n\nThis is where you go to college class in the second week and got blown away by how professor jumped the topic from *V = IR*   to   *I\\_c = I\\_s \\* (e\\^(V\\_be/V\\_t) - 1) \\* (1 + V\\_ce / V\\_a)*.\n\nI will emphasis again stock price is determined by trader taking action (volume).\n\n![img](chw6n1s1o3y41 \"Quantum Trading - The Golden Equation\")\n\nIn this equation, the price movement is a summation of Fed's desire minus movement of volume.\n\nWhat does Fed want? They want USA rally to moon. The is the beauty of The Theory of Quantum Trading. I have just invented **The Fed Coefficient, F**. We default this to be a positive coefficient.\n\n# Chapter 3: Volume Effect (The Gay Bear Effect)\n\nContinuing on the quantum trading - **The Golden Equation** from chapter 2, when trader takes action. They are simply guessing. The trend of guessing establishes the price movement. In another explanation, the change of price is negatively correlated to the change of volume.\n\nBy logic, there is always a gay bear speaking the loudest on top of the world. This is very much like the existence of cockroach. They are just there. No one knows why they are so resilient.\n\nBack to quantum trading. Most trader are embedded with gay bear soul. This is just as much as a \"Born evil or Born good\" question. I have a yet to be proved hypothesis: **Trader Are Born Gay**.\n\nUnder the creation of Stonk God, every time we enter our bid/ask. We always try to enter a tiny bit lower to ensure a fill. This nature of gay bear behavior established the relationship between stock price and volume. The more trade is entered, the more accumulation of this slight lower bid/ask price is entered. **Therefore, stock price go down with increase of volume**. **Vise versa, stock price go up with decrease of volume.**\n\n# Conclusion:\n\nWhen there is a equilibrium between The Fed Coefficient and the volume, trader should position their strategy with using **Theta Gang**.\n\nWhen there is a decline of volume, just like this past 2 weeks. **The Fed Coefficient** is dominating the price movement. Therefore, trader should NOT fight with Fed. Get as much CALLS as you can.\n\nIn the event of crisis, volume will increase. But, this never occurs overnight. Not even on the zoomer's memorial day, 2/19/2020. All trader should be aware when such trend starts and act quick. The strategy under **The Gay Bear Effect** is to get as much PUTS as you can.\n\nHere, we have concluded and covered the necessary actions and plays under all three scenarios that traders are historically being fucked. Namely, ~~pussy, anal, and oral~~. Up, Down, and Sideway.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*Disclaimer: The research paper is not back tested with any data, hence the name, theory.\n\n\\*If any graduate student slave would like to get your PhD in the study of **The Quantum Trading Theory**. Please summit your thesis with well formatted test data by end of school year. So that I can steal your work and publish research paper as sole author.",

Whatever, they traded down 7.41% percent today (sunday). That would be a *really* big red dildo if you were allowed to buy such things over there.  \n\nOk I hear you say, who gives a shit, it's all just oil money anyway, fuck off back to mecca.  \n\nNo, Stop it, that's racist get down miss obama.  \n\nI looked at the sector-by-sector breakdown [here](https://www.tadawul.com.sa/wps/portal), (at the bottom of the post)\n\nThe best performing sectors? Telecoms, REITS, Food, Energy, Retail, Utilities and Pharma. Everything else was trash, underperfoming their index. The underperformers include healthcare, staples, software.  \n\nI would have not put too much weight on this datapoint either except for the sectors that did best are the ones you would obviously expect to suffer hardest namely REITs, Retailing and Energy. Because of this deviation from expectation, It looks pretty obvious that the us markets are going to hit circuit breakers monday. If saudi had lost 7.5% due to energy, REITs and retail that would have been completely expected, but these sectors OUTPERFORMED and the market still lost 7.4%.

Market internals were a bit on the soft side with NYSE A/D only 4:3 and NASDAQ 17:15.  Volume was lighter than the past few days and the DJIA had 21 up and 9 down.  The biggest losers were BA -41 and MCD -18 DPs while the gainers were UNH +37, AAPL +30 and HD +26 DPs.  All these names were higher before the last hour with AAPL trading $301 but finishing $297.80.  The news of the day on the economy was not great.  ISM Non-manufacturing Index for Aprildropped to 41.8from 52.5 in March.  50% is the breakpoint for expansion/contraction.  The trade balance showed a widening in the deficit to $44.4 billion from $39.8 in February.  Exports were down $20 billion.

NEM was a strong report and the stock, already up from $58 on Friday finished the day $64.91 +2.17 (3.46%), DIS was the big loser with volumes down due to closed parks and no production taking place at the studios.  Streaming is strong, but a big piece is being done at reduced rates or even for free.  At the close the stock was $101.06 -2.12 but after a small rally, the conference call started and after the company disclosed it is suspending its dividend for the first half it slid to 99.25.  BYND reported good sales growth and the recent closures of several major meat processing plants has been buoying prices.  The stock has rallied off an April low of $57 and closed today $100.16 +5.00 and is currently trading $105 + $5 more.\n \nTwo companies in the same business, EA and ATVI went in opposite directions.

Pinterest (PINS) had risen from a low of $10.10 last month to close $20.81 -.62 but missed on several metrics and has traded down to $16.70 and is $17.15 \u2013 3.66.

We were stopped out of our position in the 5/15 165 calls and I replaced them with the $163 strike.  We are also long NEM.\n \nBITCOIN: closed $8985 +50. After we traded in the uptrend, I mentioned this weekend that I felt we would have to test 6750 and yesterday we hit 6465 before turning back up.  Today\u2019s action was a continuing move higher with a high of 9560.  While I want to add the 350, I still want to wait and see some stabilization. We still own 400 GBTC with an average of $8.06. GBTC closed $10.02 + .05 today.\n \n \nTomorrow is another day.\n \nCAM",

        "selftext": "Disclaimer, this is going to be a long message.\n\nWith the oil market gone mad recently, I would like to have some insights from someone who is on the field. FYI, I have never worked in/with the oil industry, but as an opportunistic and enthusiastic learner, I would like to know what it takes to pull off a deal that would allow one to get paid for taking delivery of WTI crude oil.\n\nSo here are my thoughts and interrogations. Some of my questions can overlap with each other but anyway. All of them can be summed up in one question: \"If the same scenario of negative price occurs again in May for June's contract, how to proceed if I want panicked CL owners to pay me to take delivery of their crude oil? Then come the second top level question, how do I actually take delivery of this crude oil?\"\n\nBut let's try to break this down into more elementary questions that have risen along my readings on the internet.\n\n1. First about the delivery process. I don't understand very well how roles are split between different actors.\n\n1)a) In CL contract specs, they talk about a Clearing House. What is it exactly? A quick tour on Google brought me to Oil &amp; Gas Asset Clearinghouse, is that the one? Is there an only one Clearing House?\n\n1)b) Referring to that CL contract again, it's written that \"The Clearing House shall allocate Delivery Notices and Notices of Intention to Accept by matching size of positions to the extent possible\". Do I understand right if I say that it's the Clearing House that puts, nominatively, a bid in front of an ask? Isn't it up to the financial market to do that?\n\n1)c) Apparently, some margin shall be submitted so the transaction can occur. What they call a margin in this CL contract is like a deposit, am I correct? Under which form this deposit has to be done? Money? How much? The equivalent of the whole transaction? Can you enlighten me about this margin thing? Especially when prices are negative, how this margin works?\n\n1)d) Still in CL contract, they mention two companies: Enterprise Products Partners L.P. and Endbridge Pipeline (Ozark) LLC. Are they the only one companies handling pipelines and deliveries for CL contracts? Do they handle storage as well?\n\n1)e) Are those two companies considered FCM? Or are FCM's completely different actors? How do FCMs interface with the Clearing House and the two companies mentioned in 1)d) ?\n\n1)f) Can you explain me the difference between book-out, in-tank transfer and in-line transfer please? I'm definitely not familiar with those terms.\n\n1)g) I read somewhere that delivery shall be made in accordance with all applicable Federal executive orders and all applicable Federal, State and local laws and regulation. Where can I find all those orders, laws and regulation?\n\n1)h) Could you point me toward a FCM company?\n\n1)i) What is the minimum amount of barrels required to be purchased so one can proceed to a delivery? I\u2019m guessing that FCM/Clearing House/CME/Pipeline companies/Funds (big or small) won\u2019t be interested in small transaction? What\u2019s the smallest they toletate? I'd like to have an idea of the kind of money we are talking about.\n\n1)j) CL contracts deal with WTI Light Sweet Crude Oil that is delivered to Cushing. Does this mean that WTI Light Sweet Crude Oil cannot be delivered anywhere else? Is any other type of crude delivered to Cushing?\n\n2. Then, relatively to storage itself, I can't find any clear picture of storage capacity, that's  \nquite confusing\n\n2)a) I thought that the US Gulf coast is now equipped with plenty of storage capacity, like 55% of US capacity (in Houston, LOOP in Louisiana...). How come everyone talks about storage issues in Cushing? It feels like there is only Cushing in the US (only 13% of storage capacity). Isn't it possible to transfer that glut of oil to storage farms elsewhere?\n\n2)b) Is it really an issue of storage shortage or is it more about midstream infrastructures (I mean for transportation) not being able to keep up with this abundance of crude?\n\n2)c) What regulatory requirements do storage facilities have to meet? Where can I find them?\n\n2)d) What if I decide to store the crude abroad? Will US authorities have a say in the regulatory requirements met (or not...) by the facility receiving the crude?\n\n2)e) Is there an easy way to get the big picture/map of storage capacity in the US, in the Caribbean, in Central and South America?\n\n3. About the trading/acquisition of barrels on financial markets aspects; I believe not  \nanybody can buy CL contracts (therefore purchase barrels) on classic financial markets  \nwith classic brokers.\n\n3)a) How to get access to this kind of transactions? I assume they are only large scale transaction aren\u2019t they?\n\n3)b) I didn't understand very well the difference between CME Globex and CME ClearPort... What use to do of those two ones? I got the impression that I had to be on one of those two ones to trade CL contracts.\n\n3)c) How CME Globex and CME ClearPort are different from NYMEX? Isn't NYMEX supposed to be the exchange where CL contracts are traded?\n\n3)d) What is traded exactly? USO or CL contracts?\n\n3)e) I have identified some main stake holders from a financial/market point of view:\n\n\\-CME Group, apart from creating/emeting the CL contratcs and handling/supervising crude delivery in Cushing, what do they do?\n\n\\-USCF, which is a Fund that has created USO which is also a fund. If I understood correctly, USO shares are traded (under the form of an ETF) on NYMEX. This USO ETF is somehow (how?) related to CL contracts\n\n\\-This USO Fund would be managed by Bank of New York Mellon (BNYM). Why not directly by USCF?\n\n\\-ALPS, which is the distributing broker and handles the trading operation on the fund USO\n\n3)f)i)Did I get the whole picture in terms of main players involved?\n\n3)f)ii)Why does Bank of New York Mellon manage USO instead of USO itself or USCF?\n\n3)f)iii) How CME Group and their CL contracts on one hand, and USCF/USO/BNYM/ALPS on another hand are related?\n\n3)f)iv) Generally, can someone explain how all those players interact?\n\n3)f)v) If prices go negative again, and I want to get paid to get crude delivered so that I can store it somewhere, which of those players do I need to get in touch with?\n\n3)g) Is there any contract, other than CL of CME Group, that deal with WTI Light Sweet Crude Oil? Or do I have to assume that CME Group got the exclusivity on that type of oil?\n\n3)h) In case I can't (for some reason) buy a very big bundle of CL contracts to big players like institutional funds (USCF, etc), how would it be possible to buy as many CLs to different retailer traders, make it a whole bundle myself and proceed to one big delivery?\n\n3)i) USO has 30% of long CLs for June. What/Who is the second biggest detainers of CL contracts?\n\n3)j) I have read that CME can force USO to shut down because with 30% of the contracts, USO could go bankrupt and in the end CME would have to take all the deliveries attached to the contrats. How can CME force USO to close? What's the deal between the two them? How are they related?\n\nThanks for reading this until the end and thanks in advance for your answers.",

        "selftext": "Here's a link to a video I made about DFFN and its future I've also attached the script below incase anyone just wants to read it \n\n [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTMy-bRRaMk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTMy-bRRaMk) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHey guys, it's Flynn. Today I wanted to talk about Diffusion Pharmaceuticals Inc (DFFN). DFFN is currently trading to 0.5120 cents per share and has a market cap of 17.717 million dollars. DFFN is a clinical stage biotechnology company that develops treatments for life threatening medical conditions and is based in Charlottesville, Virginia. On April 1st DFFN announced that they have agreed to team up with UVA Health and iTHRIV to team up against ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome) which is a symptom associated with the COVID-19 virus. After the announcement of the forming of a coalition share prices skyrocketed from $.30 per share to 0.75 cents per share then made its way back down to .40 cents per share. Later in the month DFFN announced their pre-IND submission After the news of this broke share prices rose from .45 cents per share to 0.85 cents per share. I believe if the FDA grants permission to DFFN I believe history will repeat itself and follow the same result. One thing I would like to point out is that they are at risk of being delisted because they are currently being traded at under a dollar per share. A reverse split is also a potential possibility trying to raise share prices to avoid being delisted and they have till August 24, 2020 to regain compliance. I believe this stock could have some good opportunities to make money but remember bulls make money, bears make money and pigs get slaughtered. So in my opinion I think make out with profit while you can and ride the waves.",

        "selftext": "These are two primary reasons why I believe market P/E ratios have to be higher today than in the past. Comparing the P/E ratio of today and decades of the past is almost like comparing apples and oranges for the following reasons:\n\n(1) **Free Put Option** is ignored by P/E ratios. When you buy the S&amp;P 500, you\u2019re also getting an embedded put option provided by the Fed and US Treasury. If market conditions get worse, these entities will support risk assets through liquidity (Fed) and deficit spending (Treasury). This idea about the free put option has been around since 2009-2010, but it has been further qualified with recent actions. The repo market problems we saw in 2019 showed the Fed will step in even when stocks are at all-time highs! This put option has only increased in value since the GFC b/c the magnitude and frequency of support is very high. This put option won\u2019t always exist, but should as long as fiat currency is accepted, the USD is the world reserve currency and the Fed\u2019s measures of inflation don\u2019t go meaningfully above 2.5% to 3%.\n\n(2) **Free Cash Flow and Low LT Rates \u2013 Tech Wins**. The foundation of asset valuation is the value of an asset is the present value of its future cash flows. When discounting future cash flows, the US 10-year has gone from 2-3% in recent years to 0.61% which increases the PV. You all know that. What a lot of people haven\u2019t picked up on yet is free cash flow profiles differ substantially across industries and companies. If a company doesn\u2019t generate much FCF, their firm valuation does not benefit from low long-term rates as much. Compare and contrast the cash flow statements of Exxon and Visa. Visa\u2019s cash flow generation is nothing short of exceptional, and Exxon\u2019s is poor. A lot of tech generates a ton of FCF and their P/E and EV/EBITDA valuations are very high, but I\u2019d argue those aren\u2019t really the best methods of valuing them because it doesn\u2019t credit them for their best attributes, which is crazy cash flow generation. Discounted Cash Flow is the purest form of asset valuation.\n\nTechnology has become a very large part of the market today. These tech behemoths (AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, FB, V) generate crazy amounts of cash. Their cash flow statements are beautiful. A P/E ratio reflects accounting earnings, and does not measure true free cash flow which is the purest form of asset valuation. There may be a better example, but in 2019 XOM had $10.6B of Net Income and $5.3B of Free Cash Flow (Cash from Operations minus Capex). In 2018, V had $10.8B of Net Income (same as XOM in 2019) but had $12.2B of Free Cash Flow. There is a big difference and cash is king.\n\nQuestion: The German 10-year Bund is -0.59%, so why aren\u2019t European equities higher? Look at the composition of the European stock indexes \u2013 can you name any great European tech company? Maybe SAP? Dassault Systemes is basically the most US-like tech company in Europe and it stock has been great, but there is basically nothing else. Europe does have great pharma companies that generate cash flow but they all have very little growth. Europe has hardly any free cash flow growth and that is what low long-term rates love.\n\n\\#1. Free Cash Flow matters a lot more than EPS. #2. Growth in tech w/in the S&amp;P 500 has led to more cash flow generation than we\u2019ve seen historically, so P/E should be higher. #3. Low interest rates benefit FCF generation through DCF models. Bottom line, traditional equity valuations are higher b/c of these market realities.",
