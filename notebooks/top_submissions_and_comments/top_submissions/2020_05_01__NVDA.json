As I have stated previously, trading large gap days are some of the most difficult to trade. Hundreds of stocks are reporting earnings, yet almost none are reacting pre market which is concerning. There is a good chance I will sit today out as most gap downs are gapping into moving averages and I don't see many stocks with good opportunities. If I decide to trade today, I will be patient off of the immediate open and concentrate on key levels of support or resistance for entries. Due to most stocks gaping into support, the list today will be short and I will be running scans intraday to look for better opportunities on earnings plays if any decide to trigger. Before entering into any positions, have a defined risk to reward with stops and targets calculated before entering trades. Good luck trading and have a good weekend.",

Market internals were a bit on the soft side with NYSE A/D only 4:3 and NASDAQ 17:15.  Volume was lighter than the past few days and the DJIA had 21 up and 9 down.  The biggest losers were BA -41 and MCD -18 DPs while the gainers were UNH +37, AAPL +30 and HD +26 DPs.  All these names were higher before the last hour with AAPL trading $301 but finishing $297.80.  The news of the day on the economy was not great.  ISM Non-manufacturing Index for Aprildropped to 41.8from 52.5 in March.  50% is the breakpoint for expansion/contraction.  The trade balance showed a widening in the deficit to $44.4 billion from $39.8 in February.  Exports were down $20 billion.

NEM was a strong report and the stock, already up from $58 on Friday finished the day $64.91 +2.17 (3.46%), DIS was the big loser with volumes down due to closed parks and no production taking place at the studios.  Streaming is strong, but a big piece is being done at reduced rates or even for free.  At the close the stock was $101.06 -2.12 but after a small rally, the conference call started and after the company disclosed it is suspending its dividend for the first half it slid to 99.25.  BYND reported good sales growth and the recent closures of several major meat processing plants has been buoying prices.  The stock has rallied off an April low of $57 and closed today $100.16 +5.00 and is currently trading $105 + $5 more.\n \nTwo companies in the same business, EA and ATVI went in opposite directions.  EA was a miss and after closing $119.61 +2.78 it fell t0 112.12 and is currently 113.98 \u2013 5.62.  Activision (ATVI) beat handily and it had closed 68.53 +1.83 and is now $72.40 + 3.87 more.

Unbelievable.\n \nROKU reported a beat on revenues but another loss.  The stock had closed $137.50 +9.98 and guidance is for no profit in either 2020 or 2021.

BKNG was a miss and after closing $1443.91 +65 it fell as low as 1,381 -63 but bounced back to close $1,440 \u2013 only $3.91.  Trip Advisor (TRIP) was not quite so lucky.

Unbelievable.\n \nROKU reported a beat on revenues but another loss.  The stock had closed $137.50 +9.98 and guidance is for no profit in either 2020 or 2021.

After breaking out over $7500 we have consolidated and broken over 8,000 and 8,500 and again consolidated.  Last night I said \u201ctoday\u2019s close is the highest since BTC broke down in early March at $9385 and 9390.  $10,000-10,250 seems like the next stop.\u201d  But I didn\u2019t think it would be today.

WYNN missed top and bottom lines with the slower than expected attendance in Macau and the stock, already down from a recovery high of $152 to close the day $79.25 -.42 fell to $76.50 before a $77.40 close -1.85.\nETSY was also a disappointment after closing at a new all-time high at $78.24 +5.45 (7.49%) and after hitting $84.01 fell back to $69.11 and finished $74.05 \u2013 4.19.  \n \nBut the award for the day goes to the analysts who both downgraded Macro-Genics (MGNX) and lowered their price objectives to $13 from $17 (Credit Suisse) and $15 from $16 at SVB Leerink, only to have the stock report and then be halted for volatility several times on its way from last nights close of $7.60 to $27.34 and closed $25.15 +17.55 (230.92%)\u2026GOOD CALL\u2026Got your resume up to date??\n \n \nFOOD SUPPLY: was MIXED with TSN -2.29, BGS +1.68 (8.6%), FLO -.62, CAG +.38, MDLZ -.18, KHC +.33, CALM +.12, JJSF -6.05, SAFM +.89, and LANC -.83.\n \n \nBIOPHARMA: was MIXED with BIIB +2.34, ABBV -.05, REGN -19.37, ISRG -.86, GILD -1.89, MYL +.29, TEVA +.51, VRTX -2.27, BHC +.54, INCY -2.74, ICPT +8.65 (10.77%), LABU +.46 and IBB $127.00 +.02 (.02%).\n \nCANNABIS: This group was LOWER with TLRY -.05, CGC -.41, CRON -.18, GWPH +2.48, ACB -.01, PYX +.16, NBEV +.02, CURLF -.09, KERN -.10 and MJ $11.50 -.35 (2.95%).\n\n \nDEFENSE: was LOWER with LMT -11.85, GD -4.40, TXT -.30, NOC -5.71, BWXT +1.53, RTX -1.35, and ITA $144.00 -3.45 (2.34%).\n \n \nRETAIL was LOWER with M -.18, JWN -.14, KSS -.52, DDS -.20, JCP -.023, WMT -1.77, TGT +1.73, TJX -.49, RL -1.19, UAA -.13, LULU +4.80, TPR -.70, CPRI -.45 and XRT $36.31 +.10 (.28%).\n \n \nFAANG and Big Cap: were HIGHER with GOOGL -3.59, AMZN +27.30, AAPL +2.44, FB +.94, NFLX +11.04, NVDA +3.26, TSLA +11.39, BABA +.38, BIDU +.75, CMG -4.23, CAT -1.45, BA -3.70, DIS -.25 and XLK $92.03 +.71 (.78%).\n  \n \nFINANCIALS were LOWER with GS -2.10, JPM -1.97, BAC -.38, MS -.73, C -1.12, PNC -1.27, AIG -1.75, TRV -3.56, AXP -2.75, V -.33 and XLF 21.32 -.47 (2.16%).\n \n \nOIL, $25.62 -.87. Oil was higher over-night and the rally continued early in the day to a new recovery high of $27.98 before falling back and closing down on the day. The stocks were lower across the board with the XLE $36.15 -.97 (2.61%).\n \n \nMETALS, GOLD: $1,688.50 -22.10. After the recent gains, Gold broke solidly above $1,700 and traded as high as $1788 last Wednesday. We were stopped out of our position in the 5/15 163 calls on the 50% Down Rule.  We are also long NEM.\n \n \nBITCOIN: closed $9340 +355. After breaking out over $7500 we have consolidated and broken over 8,000 and 8,500 and again consolidated.  Today\u2019s close is the highest since BTC broke down in early March at $9385 and 9390.  $10,000-10,250 seems like the next stop. We still own 400 GBTC with an average of $8.06. GBTC closed $10.76 +.73 today.\n \n \nTomorrow is another day.\n \nCAM",

        "selftext": "\n \n \nOil Starts Down But Ends Higher\n \nFAANGS Rally\n \n \nToday\u2019s market got off to a lower start but after the first 15 minutes it was pretty clear that we were headed for a relatively quiet and short-range day.  The range for the DJIA was a \u201cmere\u201d 400 points and the close was +26.07 (.11%) and just 20 off the high.  The NASDAQ was where most of the action took place with rallies in AMZN, AAPL, NFLX and TSLA and a final +105.76 (1.23%).  The S&amp;P 500 was +12.03 (.42%) and the Russell +3.49 (.28%) and the DJ Transports was the big loser -163.90 (2.01%).  Market internals were mixed with the NYSE 15:13 down while NAZ was 17:15 Up.  Volume was on the light side.  The DJIA was 17 down and 13 higher.  There were no major gainers or losers.\n \n \nOur \u201copen forum\u201d on Discord, which allows me to interact with subscribers and others to allow direct questions and chart opinions on just about any stock, continues to grow with more participants every day.  It is informative and allows me to share insights as the market is open and moving.  The link is: https://discord.gg/ATvC7YZ  and I will be there and active from before the open and all day.  It\u2019s a great place to share ideas and gain some insights, and we\u2019ve grown to almost 1900 members.  I also did this video titled \u201cHow to survive being an options trader and not blow up your account,\u201d over the long weekend.  I think it\u2019s very informative as a guide to stock selection and option choices.

J Crew and HTZ are talking about bankruptcy, but neither traded in after hours.  SBUX didn\u2019t actually report but did say that they were opening 98% of their China shops and those in the U.S. as soon as possible.  After closing $71.89 -1.90 it moved slightly higher to 73.60 1.71.  AIG reported but the stock did nothing while Shake Shack: SHAK missed on revenues but beat on earnings and after closing $52.77 +1.07 moved slightly higher to $55.42 it finished $53.50 + just .73.  The last name on the list was the biggest winner, Chegg: CHGG closed $43.79 +1.43 (3.38%) beat on both top and bottom lines and gave great guidance.  It ran to $51.37 and closed there +6.95 (15.81%).\n \nFOOD SUPPLY: was LOWER with TSN -4.18 (6.97%), BGS +.32, FLO -.32, CAG +.14, MDLZ -.84, KHC -.58, CALM +1.06, JJSF -1.97, SAFM -.95 and LANC -.08.\n \n \nBIOPHARMA: was HIGHER with BIIB +3.43, ABBV -.98, REGN +16.60, ISRG +3.13, GILD -.15, MYL +.39, TEVA -.32, VRTX +9.79, BHC -.39, INCY +3.69, ICPT +1.64, LABU +5.03 (14.84%) and IBB $124.30 +3.40 (2.81%).\n \nCANNABIS: This group was HIGHER with TLRY +.40, CGC +.56, CRON +.18, GWPH +4.88, ACB +.001, PYX +1.28 (51.61%), NBEV +.05, CURLF -.02, KERN -.08 and MJ $11.95 +.40 (3.46%).\n\n \nDEFENSE: was LOWER with LMT -3.47, GD -3.30, TXT -.58, NOC -6.05, BWXT -.65, TRX -1,86, and ITA $147.44 -2.97 (1.97%).\n \n \nRETAIL was MIXED with M -.07, JWN +2.38, KSS -.15, DDS -.41, JCP +.002, WMT +.88, TGT +3.22, TJX -.55, RL -1.22, UAA +.18, LULU -.03, TPR -.56, CPRI +.11 and XRT $35.85 +.19 (.53%).\n \n \nFAANG and Big Cap: were HIGHER with GOOGL +4.70, AMZN +21.91, AAPL +4.59, FB +2.93, NFLX +13.10, NVDA +8.57, TSLA +67.68, BABA -2.28, BIDU -1.42, CMG -1.05, BA -2.02, CAT -3.42, DIS -3.42 and XLK $90.09 +1.18 (1.33%).\n  \n \nFINANCIALS were LOWER with GS -1.07, JPM -.75, BAC -.13, MS -.30, C -.33, PNC -1.95, AIG -.01, TRV +1.32, AXP -1.56, V +1.12, and XLF $21.86 -.20 (.91%).\n \n \nOIL, $20.39 + .61. Oil was lower overnight (18.80) but rallied and moved higher (21.42) before closing higher. Tonight, it is higher again trading $21.59 +1.20.  The stocks were higher$37.09 +1.24 (3.46%).r with the market.  XLE closed $38.00 -.86 (2.21%).\n \nMETALS, GOLD: $1,713.30 +12.40. After the recent gains, Gold broke solidly above $1,700 and traded as high as $1788 last Wednesday. I said I wanted to get long the GLD if we can probe the $1710 range, and when it traded $17.04 yesterday, I was a buyer.  Our calls fell back to .75.  We are also long NEM.\n \nBITCOIN: closed $8935 +95. After we traded in the uptrend, I mentioned this weekend that I felt we would have to test 6750 and yesterday we hit 6465 before turning back up.  Today\u2019s action was a continuing move higher with a high of 9560.  While I want to add the 350, I still want to wait and see some stabilization. We still own 400 GBTC with an average of $8.06. GBTC closed $9.98 +.51 today.\n \n \nTomorrow is another day.\n \nCAM",
