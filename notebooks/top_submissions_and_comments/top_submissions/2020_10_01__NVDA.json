        "selftext": "Dear Retards,\n\nLucky thou are for stumbling upon my post. I have found something value and growth players can get behind. I have found one for my fellow gamers, one for the work-from-homers, one for the anti-socials and for the cocaine and hookers indulgers. **I have found CORSAIR CRSR. This is my top pick for the next six months. Stock options released yesterday. It will only take $10k to make over $100k easily.**\n\nHere's the S-1 for the real mofuckas..mofucka mofuckaaahhh: [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1743759/000119312520227100/d507744ds1.htm#toc507744\\_4](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1743759/000119312520227100/d507744ds1.htm#toc507744_4)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCorsair is a consumer hardware company. They make money from PC components, Xbox and PS controllers and streaming components so your daughter could show off her mosquito bitten chest for the Chad's on twitch. They basically have monopolized the power supply market for the DIY gamers and is how they've built their brand.  Their memory cards are also respectable in the field because memory doesn't compete the way AMD and INTC do for CPU performance. They also make fans, cases, headsets and mice for computers, all of which are starting to become very popular. They acquired SCUF Gaming so they  have a foot in the console space, which is going to see the growth that will be off the charts in Q4 and FY2021 as the printer brrrrs and everyone stays home.\n\nMy DD will include two of the most important things you should seek: **Catalysts and Undervalued Fundamentals**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd because no one seems to give a fuck about fundys these days, we'll start with\n\n**Catalysts:**\n\n**Generally Speaking:**\n\n* **Gaming is making your fatass, cant-run-a-lap-without-stopping, son cool in school. Look at all the stocks of gaming companies. Hard to find a loser.**\n* **Twitch has made it cool to build your own PC**\n* **25 day Quiet period expiration expires Monday**\n* **Economies of scale and catch-up effect (for my econ majors)**\n\n**Q2 2020:**\n\n* **Two high demanding FPS's** in Call of Duty and Valorant release\n* **WFH stipend** employees have been receiving for their WFH conversion; people bought herman millers and your wife's bf built her a new PC with corsair case, fans, PSU and memory cards\n\n**Q3 2020:**\n\n* **Nvidia's 3000 series released in September and sold out immediately.** The GPU is twice as efficient as the next best and for the same price. THIS literally makes people more willing to go big and build a new rig.\n* **Valorant** was released in June, so CRSR really starts benefitting in Q3\n* **Summer,** which means dad has to buy son the PC he built because that idiot got straight C's in school. I heard they hand out medals for every idiot who participates these days.\n* **WFH Stipend** again, as the unemployment rate falls, the amount of money new employees receive increases, incentivizing gamers to build a new PC to watch porn at 240hz ofc.\n* **Market realizes the growth in DIY computer builders because of Twitch and WoM marketing. DIY computer builders -- it has been a long time coming.** I built my first computer when I was 15, over 10 years ago. It's easy as lego's and you get more value out of each dollar spent. It is 100% the trend as well.\n\n**Q4 2020:**\n\n* **AMD** releases and **NVDA supply chain** improvement this quarter will make and have made a lot of people orgasm, more so than previous years. The rise of RH trading this year (increases exposure to the brand), all of which means more DIY nerds building PC's to finish the year\n* **XBOX release** this year 11/10 will be huge for SCUF gaming (WHOLLY OWNED subsidiary), which makes controllers for the new console. The company's ELITE controllers are sold out online. [https://scufgaming.com/xbox](https://scufgaming.com/xbox)\n   * SCUF PlayStation (11/12) controller has not been released yet for the new console\n* **Stimulus is finally coming** to all the broke boys, in a lump sum fashion ($5,200-7,800 federally), which means people will SPEND.\n\n**Q1 2021:**\n\n* Will be an **easy quarter** to compete against because the company has been experiencing income growth starting Q2 2020, not Q1.\n* **Stimulus payment effect**\n* If there's still **no vaccine** by now, holding CRSR will be a great hedge against the market bc as previously mentioned, WFH stipends, PC building and console gaming\n\n**Fundamentals, for my Buffet &amp; Munger enthusiasts:**\n\n**Literally cannot find a cheaper growth stock in the market.**\n\n* 72MM in free cash flow for the first 6 months 2020, with the latter half of the year historically being even stronger. The 6 months was carried by the strong Q2 2020\n* 58% YOY growth in sales in Q2 with 22.6MM in income\n* Q3 2020 will generate 50%+ sales growth, 35MM+ in income and 50MM+ in FCF (Conservative)\n* Q4 2020 will generate 50%+ sales growth, 75MM+ in income and 100MM IN FCF (Conservative)\n* 150MM in net income and 220MM+ in FCF Trailing Twelve Month by Q1 2021\n   * **I was the Math King in Kindergarten, so don't question my quantabilities.**\n* **1.7 Billion market cap**, implying 11x forward p/e and 8x future free cash flow on 50%+ s.g.\n   * Logitech is trading at a forward P/E of 20-25 and is worth 13.6 Billion\n   * Razer is worth 2.5 Billion and doesn't put up the kinds of numbers Corsair does.\n      * **PT estimate: $36-48, but could go to $60 with favorable peer and market conditions**\n\n**TLDR: ALL-IN on corsair. Ride the wave.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Positions:**\n\n**Me &amp; WSB autists:** $20-25 Bull Call spread for 12/18, 2/19 and 5/21. A ten-bagger play. If markets crash to end the year, sell 5/21 and load up on 2/19. I have been buying these, but haven't been given the volume I want from the market makers. I have been able to get in 12/18 for .45c, 2/19 at 1.15 and luckily one contract of 5/21 for .60c\n\n**Pussy Boomers AND MM's:** 1 million shares, sell 10,000k $22.5 call contracts and use the premium to buy FD call options. If $25's don't print, roll them over.\n\n**Optional position:** Puts on Logitech **or better yet,** ***Puts on the guy who negatively comments my post because that guy is the biggest idiot in the room. So, click on the negative commenter's profile and inverse the fuck out of that guy's positions.***\n\nIf you actually read my DD, thank you. I'll end by saying only three other times I have ever felt this confident in a play in the last few years. CMG when they were killing people for eating their food, Spotify's DL and FDX when they were trading at $105-130 in April/May this year. If you inverse me here and now, I will crush you.",

        "selftext": "Because Reddit seems to be good at picking out winners not only in the short term, but in 4-5 year time spans as well\u2026 I\u2019ve seen a lot of topics from 2016-2017 where people were bullish on companies like AMD (40x), MSFT (4x), NVDA (20x), TSLA (9x). Some were bullish on failures like GE, and Intel but even if you picked those as well, you still would\u2019ve been up tremendously over the market.\n\nThe stocks that Reddit were hyping 4-5 months ago and are still hyping up today, NET (1.8x), DKNG (2.5x), SQ (3x), ARKK (2x) have also done very well\u2026 And it\u2019s not like these are short term stocks either. They all have huge growth opportunities 5-10 years down the line.\n\nIn contrast on average it takes 7 years for an S&amp;P 500 ETF to 2x. Statistically, it would take 7+ years for my investment in VTI to reach the same % gains as the investment I made in DKNG 5 months ago. Furthermore you\u2019d have to wait 20+ years just for VOO and VTI to reach 8x valuations. Most of us would be in our late 40s, or early 50s by then.\n\nAs a young person I\u2019d rather take a medium risk, high reward opportunity, than a very-low risk low-reward opportunity.\n\nAnd yet over and over again, we\u2019re told that very few people are able to beat the market, and you\u2019re better off just dumping everything into an S&amp;P 500 index fund and holding. But the more I lurk on this subreddit and various other investing communities, the more I question that statement.\n\nI\u2019m thinking many people underperform the market because they make emotional decisions. They try to time the market, sell innovative companies for a measly 1.5x gain only to buy back again at a higher price due to fomo, liquidate everything on the slightest hint of bad news and so forth. Just like the statistic that got posted, where the Magellan Fund averaged 20% / year over 10 years, but the people who bought into the fund actually had a net negative. And overall there are far more investors like that in general rather than people who know to just buy and hold onto a stock with long term prospects.",

        "selftext": "I played COSTCO call options since May and made about $200k. COSTCO is a stock with low intrinsic value options and rewards you well if you are patient. This is not a swing trade or a 10 bagger but in my opinion, it was always a sure thing, hence I was able to buy 100 or 200 call options. I've played other tech options, NVDA, AMD, AMZN, TSLA but it always felt like pure gambling. I made about 40k on NVDA but got burned for 20k on TSLA and AMZN. I don't recommend playing options on tech stocks unless you're YOLOing stimulus money or a paycheck.\n\nOption trading on WSB has become exactly that but there are still handful savvy people that are playing smart. Sure, in the beginning when you have less than $10k, you can take higher risk for higher reward. But when you accumulate over 50k or 100k, you can invest on plays like this that gives you 10-15% return consistently without having to risk losing 80%.\n\nMy advice is once you hit 50k, don't chase option plays like ZOOM or obscure meme plays like PRPL.   \nPlay monthly options on lower intrinsic value call options like WMT or TGT. Don't hold for earnings unless you have options that are over 1 month till expiration.\n\nIf you manage to get past 100k, then put 75k in APPL or AMZN or NVDA and you can do whatever you want with the 25k. This has worked for me and hopefully this inspires this community to play smarter and make money.\n\nNow I will go to local Costco and get some rotisserie chicken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fevp23hboiq51.png?width=1053&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dcc0b91dfe2ccfcd8c5ee0ea0eefd0ab2d28a254\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kbst9qwgoiq51.png?width=972&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0891a965f84b59a91b7341b519bf5588fbe61c7d\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xpj57o7loiq51.png?width=941&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c49437265d557ea40dc8cbc7446a68df76a36c3e\n\nIt wasn't all glory and there were days when my unrealized loss was 30k or 40k but you have to set a price target or an exit date and be discipline. I took this screenshot to remind myself to always be humble and disciplined. I'm still holding some of these and they are now 20k unrealized gain.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3o38stz9piq51.png?width=1173&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e6b3da0b4825d1543c15e1c91996bd1e00480107",

        "selftext": "I have been a long-term investor in AMD and there was a lot of news to unpack in the last weeks as well as an election coming up in a few days. I wanted to give my opinion on the current state of AMD and why at current levels this company is an incredible opportunity for the medium- to long-term investor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo three 3 major events happened in the last few weeks that I want to address:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[**Q3 Earnings Report**](https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_4a33e72ea85fe760bd81d3f9e8b71721/amd/news/2020-10-27_AMD_Reports_Third_Quarter_2020_Financial_976.pdf)\n\nFirst of all their Q3 results were above expectation again (same as in Q2). EPS = 0,41$ beating 0,36$ expectation and revenue = 2,80B beating 2,55B expectation. While keeping gross margins at 44%. Note two things here: first of all beating your expectation again in the current COVID pandemic. But also the exponential growth comparing to Q3 2019/Q2 2020. It indicates that AMD is really taking off. **Meanwhile their stock price is still at the same levels as after Q2 earnings (75$)**.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[**35B Xilinx Takeover**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMfNlCZPsBQ)\n\nThen there was one of the reasons why the stock price went lower, namely the Xilinx takeover. Since I am not familiar enough with Xilinx I will let the following articles explain why this deal is a good deal from a fundamental standpoint:\n\n[AMD's 35B acquisition of Xilinx is another stroke of strategic brilliance](https://www.forbes.com/sites/davealtavilla/2020/10/28/amds-35-billion-acquisition-of-xilinx-is-another-stroke-of-strategic-brilliance/?sh=f76ffe71c9f8)\n\n[AMD buys Xilinx, troubles mount for Intel](https://analyticsindiamag.com/amd-buys-xilinx-chip-intel-impact/)\n\nSince this takeover is completely financed in stock, this has a downward effect on the stock price in the short-term. This is mainly because arbitrage traders buy Xilinx stock and sell AMD to take advantage of the price discrepancies. This means that the selling of AMD stock is not initiated from a valuation standpoint of AMD itself, hence there is a buying opportunity for the AMD shareholder. The main takeaway from this merger is, as Dr. Lisa Su puts it, the increase in **TAM: Total Available Market**. The takeover opens an array of markets; including automotive, aerospace and defence. Plainly said: more markets&gt;more chips to sell&gt; &gt;more profits.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[**New GPU Reveal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHpgu-cTjyM)\n\nThen there was the revealing of their news 6000 Series graphics cards. As you can see in the presentation the new cards can go head to head with market leaders NVDA\u2019s cards. This is a market where AMD performed poorly before. This means two things: a possibility to increase market share but more importantly: **their technology is enhancing so well they can even compete with NVDA in the GPU market.**\n\nThis has a lot to do with the fact that Dr. Lisa Su is an Electrical Engineer and **AMD (after the Xilinx merger) has 13,000 engineers under employment**. As Jim Cramer said: [He stopped being an Intel hawk when they appointed a MBA as CEO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5ackqH7a40)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**RISK**\n\nOf course there are still risks in investing in AMD as well. First off we have the (global) market risk, especially with the current election coming up. However, in the long-term both Biden or Trump won\u2019t stop the semiconductor market from growing at a similar rate as it has been so far. The only risk is the geopolitical risk, because AMD heavily relies on TSMC (a Taiwanese company) for their production. But this is a segmented-market risk as well since NVDA and Apple also rely on TSMC. And with the current projection of Biden winning the election, hopefully US-China relations will improve in the near future. And hey, no risk no reward right?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nI\u2019ve been a long-term investor in (mainly) two companies, the other one being ASML. I saw the potential of ASML getting a monopolistic position in the EUV technology and invested heavily in them when their stock was around 80-90 euro. ASML doesn\u2019t have the same potential anymore as AMD has now. Especially since AMD is still trading at the same levels after their Q2 update. I shifted my portfolio more towards AMD, and I am suggesting you do the same.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPositions:\n\nAMD: 3,000 shares, 6,500 LT Warrants.",

The slide was leaked and confirmed by [videocardz.com](https://videocardz.com) which is a very authentic source for tech news. A 16 core CPU that pulls 105w at a reasonable price will be GAME-CHANGING, and everyone will want to get their hands on it.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f4y8kvv3blq51.png?width=1569&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b0e772c7f4963cb569eb0024dcee84fb63b4697e\n\nAlong with this game-changing chip, 3 additional CPUs are rumored to be released.   \n\n\n\\#2\n\n**Big Navi having possibly better performance**  \nThere have been leaks off Newegg of Big Navi being better than the 3080. Even if the cards are neck in neck AMD will be able to paint the 6000 series cards as better due to minor discrepancies.\n\nRadeon RX 6900 XT\t5,120\t1,500\t16GB GDDR6\t512\t256-bit\t300  \n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRadeon RX 6800 XT\t3,840\t1,500\t12GB GDDR6\t384\t192-bit\t200  \n\\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRadeon RX 6700 XT\t2,560\t1,500\t6GB GDDR6\t384\t192-bit\t150  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x0zjsju2clq51.png?width=970&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=14551f974837dfc21662c24da268d5284287d169\n\n  \n\\#3\n\n**NVIDIA 3rd Party Card Catastrophe**\n\n*(this section is from my previous post)*\n\nSo most GPUs are made by a 3rd party. AMD and NVIDIA make the actual \"brain\" of the GPU but 3rd party partners add onto it for better performance (very basic explanation). Don't ask me why this is, it is just mainly because of logistical reasons.\n\nBut that is not the point, the point is that the great majority of GPUs are third-party cards meaning that they get to change around the design of the PCB. The issue here is that some of these third-party partners cheaped out on little capacitors.\n\nBy cheapening out it is leading to bad power delivery. The only way to fix this rn is to downclock the card which the normal person doesn't know how to do and doesn't expect is necessary when they are buying a 500$+ piece of hardware.\n\nI feel like if there is a mass callback that will be bad PR. NVIDIA could always release drivers that make the cards run below their listed spec but i'm not sure if people will really want that even if the performance loss is marginal.\n\nEVGA already confirmed the suspicions that these cards were crashing because of capacitor issues. It may be different for other companies but at least for EVGA this is what they are saying currently.\n\n**But why does this matter??**\n\nPeople who were looking to pick up a next-gen GPU right away are now hesitant and will wait for AMDS offerings. The people who did return their GPUs will also possibly wait. Faulty cards will most likely get a down clock which will make Big Navi look better. It supposedly already is better and this 3-5% difference could really change people's minds.  \n\n\n\\#4 \n\nLisa Su is an absolute unit. She will for sure talk about their timeline and plans for 5nm/3nm. I am guessing that this will rally investors to invest because they will see shinny 5nm/3nm while Intel is just getting to 10nm.  \n\n\n**POSITIONS:**  \n\\+95 call  (exp 12/18)  \n\\- 100 call (exp 12/18)\n\n(*call me a pussy for using a debit spread but I think its the best for my case)*  \n\n\nif you have something else you want to share comments below and I will add it!\n\nSources:\n\n[https://videocardz.com/newz/amd-ryzen-9-3950x-to-become-worlds-first-16-core-gaming-cpu](https://videocardz.com/newz/amd-ryzen-9-3950x-to-become-worlds-first-16-core-gaming-cpu)\n\n[https://www.igorslab.de/en/what-real-what-can-be-investigative-within-the-crashes-and-instabilities-of-the-force-rtx-3080-andrtx-3090/](https://www.igorslab.de/en/what-real-what-can-be-investigative-within-the-crashes-and-instabilities-of-the-force-rtx-3080-andrtx-3090/)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6bUUEEe-X8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6bUUEEe-X8)\n\n[https://www.tomshardware.com/news/evga-nvidia-rtx-3080-capacitor-caused-crashes](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/evga-nvidia-rtx-3080-capacitor-caused-crashes)\n\n[https://www.tomshardware.com/news/newegg-insider-reportedly-reveals-radeon-rx-6900-xt-rx-6800xt-rx-6700-xt-specifications](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/newegg-insider-reportedly-reveals-radeon-rx-6900-xt-rx-6800xt-rx-6700-xt-specifications)\n\n*This is not financial advice just me presenting the facts and the possibility of a callback.*  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b2ciqo9vdlq51.png?width=662&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=64d0fa79a87e74390c112a07e8d93a82c5a8476e",

Overall, I tried to make this as easy to read as possible without going into too much detail about things so you do not get bored.  \n\n \n\n\n\n\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/j2q2wp/if_you_arent_in_for_amd_youre_missing_out_on_free/  \n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\t-One of the main critiques in that post is how AMD is limited by TSMC supply. It is true TSCM production is booked and they are competing with Intel. This is due to unprecedented demand for the new series they expect. So, if they kept production at old levels then I do not think this would have been such a critique. Since they already sent out record levels of inventory last quarter, I think this bodes well actually. \n\t-AMD\u2019s GPU\u2019s are not a big money maker for them so I should not have focused on it. They are not a huge money maker yet. If rumors are true, this will be a breakout product rivaling NVIDIA. \n\t-NVIDIA selling out and saying how they are going to have limited supply of new GPU\u2019s is a good thing because it shows demand is high. I cannot state how bad of a take that is. I have yet to see articles confirming retailers (AIB\u2019s) saying they received adequate amounts of GPU\u2019s. This is because their supply chain is destroyed right now. When your only competitor is coming out with GPU\u2019s that will potentially rival yours with no significant supply chain shortages, you\u2019re in danger. \n\t-Why would I buy calls on a stock that\u2019s already run up with a P/E of 160? Because it will run up more.  \n\n   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n  \n\n\n\n**10K/10Q ANALYSIS**\nAlright let\u2019s go over the company and how it is performing compared to previous years. I\u2019ll give you a hint. It\u2019s really good.  \n\n  \n\n\n\nAll data came from SEC EDGAR\nFor all of the following information, if you have critiques or different ways you view this information please comment or PM me so I can hear what you have to say.  \n\n  \n\n\n\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/CQSoojt  \n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo give context, this graph contextualizes the returns of common stock comparing two indices compared to AMD. To summarize, in a 5-year period, AMD has outperformed the S&amp;P 500 index by a factor of 10 and the Semiconductors Index by a factor of 7.3.  \n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/fDcnrgI  \n\n  \n\n\nAMD had its first profitable year in a series of years in 2018. The previous years were categorized by Lisa Su heavily investing in new products, trimming fat, and expanding previous profitable divisions.  \n\n  \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2015, AMD had net loss of 660 million dollars. In 2016, 498 million loss. In 2017, 33 million loss. In 2018, 337 million income and 341 million income in 2019. At the same times, the net revenue increased for AMD from years 2015-2019 by a factor of 1.98x.  \n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2015, earnings per share was $-.84. It stayed negative for two years after. Actually, this is not a bad thing in the short term. Companies that need clean up like AMD did in 2012 generally have negative earnings due to such heavy investment to revitalize the company. \n-\tIn 2018 and 2019, earnings increased to .34 and .31 respectively.  \n\n \n\n\n\nIt is important to note that in 2015, AMD implemented its restructuring plan that would cause much of the data below and above this  \n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n**Why 2019 was such an important year**\n1: This year signified the launch of the 7nm products, 3rd gen Ryzen\u2019s, Zen 2\u2019s, new Threadripper\u2019s, and new notebooks. \n2: Introduction of the 2nd Gen AMD EPYC family of processors that reduced cost of ownership by 50%.\n3: Net revenue increased from 6.5 billion to 6.7 billion a 4% increase while gross margin increased by 5%. Operating income increased by 180 million and Cash/cash and marketable securities increased to 1.5 billion. \n4: Debt decreased by just under 1 billion dollars compared to 2018 due to large cash on hand and refinancing previous debts.  \n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**COMPONENTS OF REVENUE**  \n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/8sm7ver  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n\nComputing and Graphics= desktop and notebook processors and chipsets, discrete and integrated graphics processing units (GPU\u2019s), data center and professional GPU\u2019s and development services.  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n\n\nEnterprise, Embedded, and Semi-Custom= primarily server and embedded processors, semi-custom System-on-Chip products, development services and technology for game consoles.  \n\n  \n\n\n\n\nIn 2019, Computing and Graphics (Hereby known as C&amp;G) increased by over 14% due to increases in average selling price and 4% increase in shipments due to demand. These factors were driven by strong demand of Ryzen processors. A key takeaway here, a 14% increase due to product reception is absolutely massive. IN 2020, ENTIRE NEW SERIES OF CPU\u2019S AND GPU\u2019S ARE COMING WITH PROMISING LEAKS.  \n\n  \n\n\n\n\nCURRENT 2020= For the 6 months ending June 27, 2020, net revenue was at 3.7 billion. Before release of the major products being announced this month. MAYBE you can start to see why I am writing this.  \n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**FINANCIAL CONDITION**\nHaving debt is actually a good thing. It allows businesses to finance cheaper than equity, debt can be deducted for taxes, and it prevents takeovers. Having too much to the point where you cannot pay back obligations is a bad thing.\n\t- AMD decreased 2019 debt by a billion dollars. You read that correct  \n\n  \n\n\n\nOperating cash flow increased by 460 million.\nInvesting cash flow slightly decreased by 21 million\nFinancing activities increased by 15 million to 43 million.  \n\n  \n\n\n\nJust something that I like that AMD does\u2026\n-\tAMD hedges its exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk by entering foreign currency forward contracts. Nothing huge here other than they have yearly losses for this to hedge their exposure.  \n\n  \n\n\n\n\nWhen comparing their cash flows from previous years, it looks like a completely different company. Their Financial Condition is a company that can pay current debts with a high cash reserve, good amount of debt, foreign market security, and attainable obligations. I chose not to go over notes in Term Debt because I don\u2019t think most people know how they work.  \n\t-But essentially, AMD has senior and convertible notes maturing in 2022 and 2026 totaling 1.3 billion.  \n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\nFor gross profit, it has increased from 1.78 billion in 2017 to 2.44 billion in 2018 and 2.87 billion in 2019. Their investment into Research and Development has stayed a large part of their cash flows at 1.5 billion in 2019.  \n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n**LETS TALK 2020 AND WHY ITS GOING TO BE INSANE HERE ON OUT**\nAll of what is detailed below is from the most recent 10-Q for data available up until June 27, 2020.  \n\n  \n\n\n\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/51lCBl1  \n\n  \n\n\nWe see a revenue increase for the Six Months Ended of almost a billion dollars. In turn, we see a proportional cost of sales increase of 400 million. Profit increased by 500 million as well when compared to the previous year. In a non-spectacular year for AMD compared to 2019 so far, the company is destroying its previous self.  \n\n  \n\n\n\t\n-AMD announcements for new GPU\u2019s and CPU\u2019s are coming this month and I expect them to be released shortly after. I highly recommend you look through my previous post for a lot of technical terms about AMD how its systems work in the comments.\n\t-EPS for 2020 and 2019 Six Months Ended is .27 and .05 respectively. A .$22 change so far.\n\t-Net income is up from 51 million to 319 million.\n\t-Cash and Cash equivalents is upon from 1,466 billion to 1,775 billion when compared to December 2019.  \n\n  \n\n\n\n\n**SO LETS SUMMARIZE BEFORE WE CONTINUE**  \n\n  \n\n\n\n-AMD is a company that has wildly outperformed all indexes and most companies. I understand how one company should not be compared to indexes with lots of businesses, but for ease of understanding it is here.\n- In 2019 EPS, Revenue, and profit all went up and not in a slight way.\n-Highly anticipated products launches coming out later this year. \n-Massive decrease of debt obligations.  \n\n  \n\n \n\n\nSo far, I hope this has been relatively straight forward.  \n\n  \n\n\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n  \n\n\n**NOW LETS TALK ABOUT TRENDS AND NOVEMBER CONCERNS**  \n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/PlUSi2K  \n\n  \n\n\n\nOn November 7th, 2016 right before the big day, AMD was trading at $6.69. A week after jumped to $8.71. At the end of December it was at $11.58. So the first major moment we are looking at really did not have a negative impact. Him winning helped AMD rise.  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n\n|\n|\n|\nhttps://imgur.com/a/2YrGBxF  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n\n\n\nMarch 17th was when Former VP J0E won 3 states (Florida, Arizona, and Illinois in his primary battle). During this time, COVID was starting to take effect as well. We 3/16 to 3/18 we see a few percent drop after his win is confirmed. I do not think in any way was Former VP J0E\u2019s win related to that. I think it was entirely COVID related and even when comparing AMD to other tech stocks, the drop is minimal at best for the same timeframe.  \n\n  \n\n\n|\n|\n|\n\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/gYOvj2H  \n\n  \n\n\nAugust 17th is when Former VP J0E was confirmed the nominee in the race. AMD has virtually zero reaction to this.  \n\n  \n\n\n\n|\n|\n|\n\n\n\nSo we have quickly looked at 3 major events relating to p01itics and seen how AMD has reacted. The only noticeable change was in March 2020 during COVID. It is clear to see how AMD is not influenced by major p01itical events, so I think its safe to say that the outcome of the race will not have a huge impact on the price. Unless the major indices have a massive jump or dip, AMD will not care. I looked at other major events like the first stimulus passing and it was more of a player there. On 3/27 when the Stimulus was signed when compared to a week after, AMD was down $2 when it was trading in the $40\u2019s. However, AMD quickly recovered a short time later.  \n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**BUT AMD JUMPED RECENTLY BUYING IS NOT SMART**  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/uNbwEwi  \n\n  \n\n\n\n\n From 7/15 to EOD today, AMD went from $54.96 to $86.15. Quite the jump in just a few months. The all-time high was $94.28 a short while ago. Many people are looking at this and saying its too high and the jump was too soon. Actually, I would agree with them under normal circumstances. But right now tech carries the market and AMD has new product releases soon with massive hype, their deep learning and data centers will continue to take more market share, and their current financials are incredible compared to previous years. In no way do I think the price is too high or priced in yet.  \n\n  \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCould we see pullbacks in the coming months? Absolutely and you should expect them. \nWhat are the chances the new products are a disaster? No clue, but if that\u2019s your concern then play the hype surrounding the products and get out at the first sign of bad news. \nWhat do I believe the price target to be? Before 2020 is over, I would say anything around $95 is safe. Long term? $120 in 2021",

        "selftext": "I\u2019m sure everyone read enough of how management is going to turn this around but no one spoke about how the gaming console itself is going to benefit Gamestop since they deal with a lot of physical/disc sales/resale.\n\nI just want to talk about the second coming of Tesla that is Gamestop. I talk mostly about how Gamestop will boom with rise in physical game vs digital. What I talking about? I\u2019m talking about the coming of 4k gaming. While you bitches are trying to just play the short squeeze for a price target of 50$ you are completely missing the bigger picture. We are going to easily go above the company\u2019s all time record high made back in 2008 62.11$ without the squeeze when all said is done. (Don't forget our buddy Michael Burry managed to kill 1/3 of the outstanding shares through last years buyback) \n\nBack in 2012, anyone who was a gamer can tell you how big of a POS the console launches were because of one reason. The hardware were absolute trash, it was using AMD\u2019s CPU/GPU and everyone complained because you\u2019re paying a premium for low tier outdated PC parts. Intel cpu was what people wanted fitted with Nvidia graphic cards. You have 12 year olds rocking PCMR (PC MasterRace) logo everywhere making fun of peasants potato PCs. Look at AMD in 2012, it was trading at 2$. Company probably had Donald Trump at the helm making the calls running the company into the ground like his Casinos. \n\nAnyways, this time is fucken different and even better than it was back in 2008. In 2008, cpu/gpu improvements were still doing fucken leaps and bounds year after year. The game consoles were outdated within a year or 2. In 2020, CPU/GPU improvements slowed to an absolute crawl and parts cost a fucken arm and a leg. Moores law hit a wall and getting 2x performance over last year was no longer possible and the cost for parts kept going up. You want the latest and greatest? That\u2019ll cost you 2000$+ for PC gaming, hell no one is going to have that kind of money especially with this recession. \n\nNow here comes PS5 and Xbox Series X, giving you the latest top of the fucken line gaming hardware for 600$. M$ and Sony is losing money on this like back in 2008, you will hear every fucken reviewer praise this and tell you go out and buy it. Everyone and their mom\u2019s going to go buy new gaming console for their kids so they can fuck off while they have sex with her boyfriend in the other room.\n\nHow does any of this benefit Gamestop? Well with now the latest and greatest gaming console and top of the line hardware we will see an actual push for 4k gaming.\n\n4k gaming to say the least is very hardware intensive and also takes up a fuck ton of storage space. What takes up a lot of storage space? 4k fucken texture packs for 4k gaming alone takes up +20gb of space. Yes that fucken storage space is going to be huge. The last generation we never had any real push for 4k gaming, fucken hell they mostly ran below 1080p to even be remotely playable at 30 FPS. You think people are going download entire games when it takes days or weeks to download with their dial up connections. No they will buy physical discs 9/10 times. \n\nMoreover anyone who plays games on console will tell you 99% that they prefer disc over digital downloads because it cost the same as digital and \n\nLastly, we all know that with the new console release there is actually a lack of new games but that matters not. All games are backwards compatible, so where does Gamestop benefit from this? Well they are only the biggest used game reseller around the block. When people go to buy the new console they are going to go to Gamestop over Amazon or Bestbuy and buy used game to play when everyone goes back into lockdown. Everyone who was planning on spending 3000 on trips oversea will be buying games instead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyone who says they are going to go like Blockbuster and point to the last 2 quarters is trying to shill you. Everyone knew that a new super gaming console cycle was coming, they were holding off on their purchases and been saving their pennies for this. The next quarter for Gamestop is going to be its biggest.\n\nTL;DR\n\nBig push for 4k gaming will result in large files downloads incentivizing people to choose physical discs over digital.\n\nPositions. Shares and even more shares for now. After election IV Armageddon 01/15/21 30C or further out.\n\nTL;DR x2 Also for everyone saying that Gamestop will go out of business. Here\u2019s just a quick discussion on just simply why it makes sense for Microsoft/Sony to exist. https://youtu.be/8gEfHD\\_y7Pc?t=938\n\n Gamestop will be their showroom, so it makes sense for Gamestop to thrive and not run them out of business. Amazon/Bestbuy/Walmart sure as hell aren\u2019t going to advertise games for them since they aren\u2019t a gaming retail store primarily.\n\nPS. Bunch of hedge funds trolling GME to scare you out of positions so they can cover their shorts.",

ASML, the only EUV lithography machine makers in the world, and Adyen are the only 'new economy' stocks that are growing. They also have Prosus which is an investment holding company like Softbank but more conservative.\n\n**My Conclusion**\n\nOnly Netherlands is worth investing in for European exposure. The rest of the companies are old economy companies and large healthcare/pharma are not growing as quickly and are more similar to J&amp;J in terms of growth except your dividends will get taxed too.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Extra opinion**\n\nJapan and (Asia) Pacific are not worth investing in too, only Taiwan (TSMC, FOXCONN), South Korea (Samsung), China (BABA, TENCENT, MEITUAN, PINGAN, etc) are worth it. Hong Kong, Singapore, Australia, New Zealand are full of boomer economy companies too. Emerging markets are a different story but in the age of economical colonization, large companies from other countries will probably swallow them up before they can get big so you can't really participate in their growth if you invest in them.",

It's all but confirmed that AMD's tease was not their highest end GPU, and what they did show was on par with the 3080. Most leaks say that AMD will be competitive with 3090 as well.\n\nCombo that with the fact that zen 3 is looking to be a price to performance champion, and Intel is so unconfident in their next generation that they announced it in a fucking blog post, I think it's safe to say AMD is going up, but I wonder how much they're pre-inflated for the earnings call on Tuesday.\n\nSo calls for sure, but calls for 30th or calls for sometime in November when both gpus and cpus are officially announced?\n\nThank you for coming to my Ted talk, my velvety smooth brain is unfamiliar with how markets trend before earnings reports; also broke bitch 20yo so buying both is probably a no.

Any car maker who tries to create an ecosystem around the car deserves to lose the customer,\u201d says Martin Kristensson, head of digital business at Volvo Cars.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Is the heart of your car a screen?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Having spent years\u2014and tens of billions of dollars\u2014preparing for a shift in production toward electric vehicles, German car makers are expressing a new angst: that digitally \u201cconnected cars\u201d could prove even more disruptive to their traditional strengths. This second leg of their race against Tesla could become a fresh excuse to squander investors\u2019 capital.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Daimler set two priorities for technological leadership in a new strategy for its [Mercedes-Benz](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/DMLRY) [DMLRY **-0.55%** ](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/DMLRY?mod=chiclets)brand this week: electric drive and car software. For the latter, the company is working on an entire operating system, MB.OS, that from 2024 will run not just Mercedes\u2019s proprietary infotainment system and its mobile broadband connection but also crucial elements of the driving experience, including self-driving features and battery management.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The company will partner with technology specialists for specific applications, notably [Nvidia](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/NVDA) for automated driving. Yet the closer the software gets to the customer experience, the more Daimler wants to do in-house. The interface with the driver in particular \u201cis not something that we would like to outsource to somebody else,\u201d said Chief Executive Ola K\u00e4llenius.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;[Volkswagen](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/XE/XETR/VOW) [VOW **+0.00%** ](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/XE/XETR/VOW?mod=chiclets)is on a similar road. At last week\u2019s annual general meeting, Chief Executive Herbert Diess said replacing engines with electric batteries and motors would be simple to manage compared with the transformation of the car into a \u201cfully networked mobility device.\u201d He is tackling the challenge by investing heavily in coding: VW wants to increase the proportion of software written in-house to at least 60%, from 10% currently, at a cost of \u20ac7 billion, equivalent to $8.23 billion, by 2025.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The shadow haunting the German automotive industry is, of course, Tesla. Mr. Diess regularly spurs on his managers by invoking the U.S. company\u2019s technological lead and astronomical market value. The starring role accorded to the infotainment screen in a Tesla seems to be a popular feature with the kind of tech-loving consumers who might otherwise buy an [Audi](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/XE/XETR/NSU). Auto makers are also envious of Tesla\u2019s capacity to keep consumers\u2019 systems fresh via \u201cover-the-air\u201d updates.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;One reason Daimler cited for focusing on software was the scope for using this kind of live digital connection with its customers to sell them services well after they have bought their Mercedes-Benz. Many manufacturers have talked of this potential, but Daimler was bold enough to pin a number on it: It hopes to make \u20ac1 billion in operating profit from digital services by 2025.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The software industry has been through a wrenching transition over the past decade from selling one-off packages to subscriptions for access to a constantly updated, cloud-hosted service. As more vehicles are connected to the internet, infotainment systems are likely next in line. One big unknown is what consumers will be prepared to pay for, and who will get it\u2014vehicle manufacturers or software developers. Another is how deeply the infotainment system will end up being linked to driving controls.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;For now, though, most car makers are more relaxed than Daimler and VW about ceding control of at least infotainment to the tech industry. [General Motors](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/GM), Volvo Cars, the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi [alliance](https://www.wsj.com/articles/google-to-partner-with-biggest-car-alliance-1537243260) and [Peugeot](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/PUGOY) (which [Fiat-Chrysler](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/FCAU) will likely follow) [all are partnering to varying extents](https://www.wsj.com/articles/gmturns-togooglefor-in-car-apps-voice-commands-11567692000) with Alphabet\u2019s Google, which has developed a vehicle version of its smartphone operating system called Android Automotive.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\u201cOur customers spend about one hour a day in their car and one hour a day away from their phone. Any car maker who tries to create an ecosystem around the car deserves to lose the customer,\u201d says Martin Kristensson, head of digital business at Volvo Cars.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Volvo and others say partnering with Google makes sense because consumers already use and like its products. The glitchy reputation of auto makers\u2019 existing vehicle infotainment systems adds weight to this argument. But partnering also is probably the cheaper option.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\u201cThere are a lot of economies of scale in software development. Auto makers who want to get more programmers and do the work themselves are generally underestimating the costs,\u201d says Mark Wakefield, co-leader of the automotive and industrial practice at AlixPartners.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The insistence of Daimler and VW on building up software skills might therefore be another iteration of their historic bias toward over-investment. The vast expense of electric-vehicle development has forced both companies to get more serious about cutting fixed costs in recent years; Mercedes-Benz this week committed to a 20% reduction by 2025. Ominously, though, the company also is charging into yet another technological battleground.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Drivers and investors alike may end up preferring auto makers to focus on what they are best at: assembling cars.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGoogle makes the operating system that is in the majority of the world's phones.  The idea that VW is going to be able to really compete with that just doesn't make sense. Especially when their history of tech is pretty much a failure.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't think that the German automotive industry is going to be near the same in 10 years.  I wonder how that is going to impact Germany and Europe's overall economy.",

Long term I don\u2019t disagree that AMD and NVDA might be a better play but lets be honest, at a PE of around 9 Intel is looking very attractive.",

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, October 6, 2020**\n\nStocks traded mixed today as market participants digested a host of new developments around Pres. Trump\u2019s health after his COVID diagnosis, Chairman Powell\u2019s remarks, the prospect for additional fiscal stimulus, and the resurgence of the Virus in some hotspots.\n\nThe Nasdaq (QQQ) finished the day 1.78% down, the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) finished the day 1.42%, and the Dow (DIA) finished the day 1.37% down.\n\nToday, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell gave a virtual address at the National Association of Business Economics\u2019 annual address to discuss the Fed\u2019s outlook for the economy during this pandemic. In his address, Powell once again (for the hundredth time it seems) reiterated the need of further fiscal stimulus to support the pandemic-stricken economy and promote faster recovery. He said, \u201cThe recovery will be stronger and move faster if monetary policy and fiscal policy continue to work side by side to provide support to the economy until it is clearly out of the woods.\u201d\n\nElsewhere, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi echoed Powell\u2019s comments. She said. \u201cChairman Powell\u2019s warning could not be more clear: robust action is immediately needed to avert economic catastrophe from the devastation of the coronavirus pandemic. It is long overdue for Republicans to join us in passing a bill that meets the needs of the American people.\u201d \n\nAt the moment of writing this recap, Pres. Trump tweeted \u201cNancy Pelosi is asking for $2.4 Trillion Dollars to bailout poorly run, high crime, Democrat States, money that is in no way related to COVID-19. We made a very generous offer of $1.6 Trillion Dollars and, as usual, she is not negotiating in good faith. I am rejecting their request, and looking to the future of our Country. I have instructed my representatives to stop negotiating until after the election when, immediately after I win, we will pass a major Stimulus Bill that focuses on hardworking Americans and Small Business.\u201d Immediately after this tweet, the markets turned sharply downwards and the VIX turned sharply upwards (VIX is an indicator of market participant\u2019s risk sentiment). Pelosi responded by saying, \u201cTrump is not willing to crush the virus\u201d and that \u201che puts himself before the nation\u201d\n\nTrump departed Walter Reed National Military Medical Center yesterday and returned to the White House, just days after entering the hospital on Friday to be treated for Covid-19. White House physician Dr. Sean Conley said Trump had \u201cmet or exceeded all standard hospital discharge criteria,\u201d while conceding that he \u201cmay not be entirely out of the woods yet\u201d in his recovery process.\n\nJust four states in the US are reporting a decline in coronavirus cases, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. In Wisconsin, new cases are averaging at about 2,400 daily -- the third highest in the country behind Texas and California. That's up 15% from what the state was averaging in the previous week. At least 22 states are reporting more new cases than the previous week, with many across the Midwest and now increasingly in the Northeast.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Crude oil rose above $40 per barrel.\n* Shares of Boeing (BA) fell after the company announced cuts to its 10-year outlook for aircraft demand amid falling demand due to the pandemic.\n* White House agrees to FDA\u2019s guidelines for vetting COVID-19 vaccine candidates. \n* N.Y. COVID Patients hospitalized are 700 today, highest single day total since July.\n* The 'recall-unemployment' rate fell to 2.9%, while the share of Americans who weren't expecting to be called back to work once conditions improved grew, according to a study by Stanford Economics Dept.\n* Apple announced an event on Oct. 13, which analysts believe will be used to announce the new model of iPhones and their 5G compatibility. \n* Tesla\u2019s (TSLA) new factory in Berlin is being constructed at record pace. The factory is expected to produce Tesla's Model Y, Model 3 and eventually a more affordable $25,000 Tesla. Now a new post from Tesla fan site Tesmanian has quoted anonymous sources claiming up to 4,000 employees will be working in the new factory by March 2021. Vehicle production is scheduled to start June 2021. \n* PPG Industries had target raised by UBS group from $132 to $142 at BUY\n* Purple Innovation  (PRPL) had target raised by Oppenheimer $25 to $37 OUTPERFORM\n* Nvidia (NVDA) upgrade by\n   * Raymond James reiterated BUY\n   * BMO Capital Markets raised target  from $565 to $650 to OUTPERFORM\n* Generally across the board Analysts are upgrading banks:\n   * Barclays upgraded Credit Suisse\n   * Bank of Nova Scotia and Bank of Montreal upgraded by Bank of America (BAC)\n   * BAC upgraded by JPMorgan\n* Costco (COST) upgraded by\n   * Barclays Upgraded $400 NEUTRAL to OVERWEIGHT\n   * Credit Suisse raised target $328 to $370 NEUTRAL\n* Beyond Meat (BYND)\n   * Piper Sandler raised the target from $130 to $178 at NEUTRAL\n* Advance Auto Parts (AAP)  upgraded by JPMorgan Chase &amp; Cofrom $183 to $190 NEUTRAL to POSITIVE\n* US trade deficit up to $67.1 billion in August, a 14-year high, according to the Department of Commerce.\n* General Electric Company (GE) shares were down over 4% in recent trading on Tuesday after it received a \"Wells notice\" from the US Securities and Exchange Commission, according to a company filing. According to the notice, the SEC's staff is considering recommending a civil injunctive action against the company for possible violations of securities laws.     \n* Quanterix (QTRX) said on Tuesday the National Institutes of Health has picked the company to progress to the second-stage contract worth $18.2 million to speed up the development of a COVID-19 test kit based on its ultra-sensitive Simoa technology.\n* The Australian government on Tuesday announced plans to cut income taxes, create jobs for young people and stimulate business investment with a raft of pandemic measures that would create a record 214 billion Australian dollar ($153 billion) deficit in the current fiscal year.\n* Some notable performers: BNTX 6.8%, GDRX 6.2%, SYMC 4.7%, DB 4.4%, ABEV 4.3%, BYND 4.3%, SE 4.1%, TWLO 3.5%, CCL 3.3%, AYX 29%, DUFRY 21%, HINOY 13.6%, BE 12.7%, RYCEY 8.4%, SAGE 7.5%, CVAC 6.2%, NVTA 6.1%, VIR 5.8%, OPK 5.8%, FSLY 5.6%, AXON 25%, HGEN 23%, LKNCY 20.6%, PSNL 15%, DDD 8.6%, SPT 7.7%, GPRO 6.6%, GSAT 5.4%, IMAX 5.1%, NMRK 4.9%\n\n\"All I need is within me now!\" Tony Robbins",

        "selftext": "Sup bitches,\n\nGot some interesting info for yall asses.  I have a friend who works in cyber security and is into gaming, and he hit me up today with some interesting dd.  I dont know shit about this stuff but this is basically his word so take this info for what its worth.\n\nBasically AMD just announced its going to be coming out with new gpu that, in his words, is either matching or beating  NVIDEA with less power and for cheaper.  This is huge news because up until now NVIDEA has apparently dominated this space.  He states \"NVIDIAs top GPU the RTX 3090 sells for $1,499.99 and draws 350W and its one of the largest GPUs ever in terms of physical size. AMD took some shots. They released the RX 6900XT for $999.99 only draws 300W and it's the same size as your average GPU.  The only thing the 3090 has is more memory 24Gb vs 16GB but honestly that shouldn't matter.\"  He further states \"They should be getting a lot of sales on both cpu and GPUs because they also made this technology that when you pair one of their cpu with one of their GPUs you automatically unlock this feature NVIDIA and intel cannot provide.  Same feature that's going to allow the new consoles to load games so quickly and just boost the performance.\"  He finishes \"Streams of revenue PS5, XboxseriesX, CPUs (consumer laptops/desktops, high end gaming/workstations, servers google + Microsoft deals) and now GPUs.\"\n\nSo what does all this mean?  Honestly I donno and most of you are too retarded to understand this info let alone read but maybe theres atleast one of you out there autistic enough to find this info suitable, or at the very least school me on this stuff.\n\nTLDR:   buy long dated AMD calls I guess.....",

        "selftext": "Okay so its Friday and your account is red because you're a retard that keeps buying calls on overpriced megacap tech. Listen up cuckboy tech is good, megacap is bad. We're going into another wave, and tech is going to continue to moon. As institutional investors pull money from these megacaps to further diversify into small cap tech, you'll keep getting fucked by red dildos. Now the good thing is that even though we're retards, we're not boomers. There's still hope for you to get your wife back. First DD so excuse shit grammar and formatting, I'm a retard.\n\n1. LOGI - On recent quarterly report 10/20/20 showed sales rocketed 75% boost. Siting keyboards and combo products climbed 44% and 26% sales growth respectively. Which caused the stock to roar 16% representing about a 1.3b market cap increase. \n\n2. Analysts - Goldman Sachs has it as a buy with a target of 32. And all these other shit boomer banks have it at $24 with a buy rating. They all see the same shit you would see if you just stopped being such an autist. The future is stay at home work, E sports, gaming and streaming. WHICH IS WHAT CRSR FOCUSES ON AND DOMINATES. Which brings me to my next point.\n\n3. Gaming, Esports and Streaming - This year is the console wars, with people saying that this technological leap will be the first of its time. Where Consoles are going to dick pcs for the first time. You already see Microsoft dumping cold hard cash on trying to finally have an exclusive library again besides HaLo and buying out Bethesda for an extreme premium. Wake up people, as newcomers enter the gaming world and OG's look to upgrade their accessories, CRSR will be in the position to ride the wave. \n\n4. Market Float &amp; IPOs - The reason why some fucktards got burned on these recent IPOs is because they don't realize how float can shit on the price of a stock. Usually when these IPOs come out, its a bait for retail investors to gobble up the market shares. While the institutions dump those same stocks on your head. Their float is sitting at 6% while other IPOs like RKT that loves to be pumped here, have a float of 23%.\n\n5. Market Cap - Logitech sitting at 22.31b and CRSR is sitting at 2.3b, what does this mean? In a recent interview the CEO mentioned how they've noticed a strong trend of why and when new customers enter their market/gaming world. When a good game comes out, when new hardware gets released, and when they stay home/work from home. Guess what retards - all 3 are relevant. Huge growth numbers are coming, the same way they crushed their first quarter, they'll crush it again this one. And because the market cap is 2.3b, there's not a ton of float, and institutional investors are interested it means that little Itty bitty 25/share will explode with so much room to run. \n\n6. Esports, AMD &amp; NVIDIA and PC building-  This year we have new releases in the graphics card that are so ridiculously superior from the last model, people are buying them at 10x 15x price on 3rd party sell websites like eBay. The demand for these are through the roof and its safe to assume that people will upgrade and future proof their system with ram cards, coolers and other essential parts that CRSR sells. They'll also pick up new peripherals and add streaming gear as the new streaming trend continues to show good signs. \n\n7. Strong Price Support &amp; How to play - Lets look at the TeChNiCaLs and no Stonks only go up bullshit. Have you looked at the nasdaq, I thought I was fucking colorblind and only saw red until I took my eyes off of that hot garbage. This one tends to run up premarket and aftermarket a good sign of big boys playing. But it also means the buying opportunity for us little guppies is mid day when there's a dip or small pullback. What I love about this movement is, you'll get a 5-10% rally in the premarket but only cool down 2-3%. And then it'll trade sideways as every drop gets caught. On every nasdaq red day, crsr has been as green as the cash in my account. The strength of this stock reminds me of your wife's boyfriend. I posted about it yday but I'll say it again, on red days, look for the green retard strength stocks.\n\nI'm pretty sure at this point your little brains are about to have an aneurysm so I'll save you the trouble. Don't be a beta bitch and finally make some money. CRSR is in a great position, at a great entry point, and has a lot more room to grow. \n\nPositions: CRSR $30 11/30",

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, October 12, 2020**\n\nStocks traded higher today as market participants looked ahead to stimulus talks in Washington that appear to be progressing and an upcoming round of quarterly that are expected to be improved relative to earlier in the year.\n\nThe Nasdaq (QQQ) was on fire today, finishing the day 3.09%, as the rebound in big tech continues from the September lows.. The S&amp;P (SPY) finished 1.59% up and the Dow Jones (DIA) finished 0.87%.\n\nProspects for further fiscal stimulus coming from Congress has been a main point of interest for traders since the CARES Act, the first round of stimulus passed in March, ran out on July 31. Though prospects for additional passage before the November election are slim, recent reports of a $1.8 trillion proposal coming from the White House and renewed talks between Treasury Secretary Mnuchin and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Last week\u2019s meetings between the pair did not produce an agreement, both parties are optimistic that a deal will  be worked out. In an interview with CNN, White House economic advisor Larry Kudlow offered an upbeat assessment of the negotiations, saying that \u201cthe bid and offer is narrowing somewhat between the two sides.\u201d While there is a large delta between both proposals, the fact that the White House is showing a willingness to negotiate and compromise is a good sign that negotiations are going forward in good faith. \n\nThird-quarter earnings begin in earnest this week. A host of big banks, including JP Morgan (JPM) and Citigroup (C), will report earnings tomorrow. Big banks, which have underperformed the broader market since the March bottom, will provide valuable information into the extent of the ongoing strain to the US economy as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. \n\nFor this earnings season, analysts expect companies to report more year-on-year declines in profits due to business difficulties arising from the pandemic. According to data collected by FactSet, consensus estimates predict a earnings per share decline of 20.5% over the last year for companies in the S&amp;P 500. This earnings season comes at a very interesting time, with the market primed for several market-moving events, including the possibility of vaccine and therapeutic breakthroughs to treat coronavirus and uncertainty surrounding the upcoming presidential election. According to analysts at Goldman Sachs (GS), \u201cNew information on the election, vaccines, and upcoming 3Q earnings represent substantial cross-currents for equities during the next two months. However, the vaccine represents a more important factor than the election result for the recovery in S&amp;P 500 fundamentals. In short, the progress of the US economy depends more on developments surrounding the disease rather than political elections or candidate differences in restoring the broken fundamentals of the stock market. \n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Amazon (AMZN) Prime Day starts today at Midnight and runs through to Wed, Oct 14.

The S&amp;P (SPY) finished 0.86% up and the Dow (DIA) finished 0.54% up.\n\nTraders continue to closely monitor developments out of Washington weighing whether more stimulus will be passed, be it comprehensive or targeted. Despite Pres. Trump\u2019s recent tweet saying he was not willing to negotiate further stimulus until the election, negotiations appear to continue. According to top officials and economic analysts, the passage of additional is key in encouraging and fast-tracking the recovery of the pandemic-stricken economy. \n\nAccording to multiple reports from CNBC, the Wall Street Journal, Bloomberg and others, the White House is prepared to offer a new stimulus proposal totalling $1.8 trillion, about $400 billion below what the Democrats are asking for but an increase from the original $1.6 trillion offer. It's unclear what specific provisions will be included in the drafted legislation, but the earlier plan included a fresh round of $1,200 stimulus checks; expanded unemployment benefits at $400 per week and additional funding for state and local government. While a large gap still remains between the two proposals, let\u2019s hope that the White House showing willingness to negotiate adds goodwill and Congress can come to an agreement. Today Trump tweeted \u201cCovid Relief Negotiations are moving along. Go Big!\u201d\n\nAdding to the optimis, White House economic advisor Larry Kudlow told Fox Business that the President \u201cwants to do a deal.\u201d This is a remarkable turnaround considering Pres. Trump\u2019s recent tweet where he said he was not willing to negotiate an additional deal. The market has positively responded to this development.\n\nYesterday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin discussed further stimulus for about an hour. After the meeting Drew Hamill, Pelosi\u2019s spokesperson, said in a tweet that Mnuching made clear the President\u2019s interest in reaching an agreement for a comprehensive package after Pelosi made clear he would not support a standalone, targeted bill. In a note to clients Jeffrey Buchbinder, LPL Financial Equity Strategist said, \u201cA compromise on a big stimulus package in Washington could potentially deliver another October surprise, but the odds are against it as Election Day approaches.\u201d\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* The Wall Street Journal reported that  Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) is in advanced talks to acquire Xilinx (XLNX) in a deal that could be valued at more than $30 billion. Shares of AMD were down more than 4% because of the dilutive effect the deal will have on the stock. XLNX was up 14.7% throughout the day.\n* The personal-computer shipments rebound that's benefited from a surge in remote work and study during the pandemic carried into the latest quarter with a 12.7% increase from the year earlier, the highest growth in a decade, according to research firm Canalys.     \n* Weed stocks have been on a tear recently, after VP Kamala Harris said the Biden Administration would federally decriminalize marijuana. \n   * Aphria (APHA) up 28% this week.\n   * Canopy Growth (CGC) up 27.5% this week. \n   * Aurora Cannabis (ACB) 8.2% up this week.\n* Wedbush tech analyst Michael Pachter reiterated his conservative neutral rating on Gamestop (GME) and kept an $8 price target despite the recent partnership with Microsoft (MSFT). \n* Twitter (TWTR) announced it will make posts harder to go viral ahead of the US election, including placing limits on how users can retweet to try and prevent the spread of misinformation.\n* Sky Solar Holdings (SKYS) announced it completed its merger with Square (SQ). As a result, SKYS is now a subsidiary of SQ and will no longer be publicly traded.\n* Microsoft (MSFT) announced it will permit some staff to permanently work remotely.\n* Realty Income (O) was upgraded by JPMorgan from NEUTRAL to OVERWEIGHT with a price target of $28.50, price is currently around $23.\n* New Street Research  analyst Pierre Ferragu issued a SELL rating on $NVDA with a price target of  $400 , a loss of about 25%. Most analysts rate as BUY or better.\n* JPMorgan analyst Richard Shane upgraded Rocket Companies from Neutral to Overweight and cut his price target from $31 to $28.50.\n* VFC had target raised by Telsey Advisory Group $72 to $90 at OUTPERFORM, and also by Robert W.

We have played this stock since March, it is an absolute beast!\n* Marvell Technology (MRVL) with a myriad of price target raises from Needham, Benchmark, Cowen, Oppenheimer, Deutsche Bank on average around $50. \n* NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) once again with a barrage of price target raises from Loop Capital, Cowen, Barclays, Raymond James, Citigroup, Wells Fargo, Needham, Piper Sandler and Jefferies Financial. On average they have $160 target, and the stock is at $140, most of them are OVERWEIGHT except for Citigroup which is NEUTRAL.\n* On Semiconductor (ON) had target raised by Jefferies Financial and Deutsche Bank to $31 and $30 respectively, they both rate at BUY. This is a nice call, as Deutsche bank is well respected, and semiconductor stocks have been hot hot hot... Keep an eye out!\n* Datadog (DDOG) had a price target raised by Barclays  from $107 to $126 at OVERWEIGHT.\n* Amazon (AMZN) got the price target raised by Mizuho to $4,000 at BUY. really bullish call! \n* Silver and Gold great performers today\n\n\"The best revenge is massive success\" Frank Sinatra",

But this was a very smart move.\n\nThis year has show us that these companies need to stop being so reliant on making their products with firms like TSMC. \n\nIntel, AMD and Nvidia have been fighting over manufacturing capacity and it is posing a lot of risk and costs to the companies. I bet acquiring an American chip manufacturer will prove to be a very smart move in the long.\n\nAlso in this industry that is likely going to continue consolidating, cash is king, so this equity marriage was a super nice way to do it.\n\nSo calm yourself and double down and AMD.",

Would graciously appreciate someone with maybe some more knowledge opinion.\n\nWould love any insight you guys have on these tickers. Thanks again any constructive thoughts are GREATLY appreciated.  \n\n$NEE - Amazing Long term growth. Attempting to buyout other companies. Dividend has been rapidly increasing. Is the growth potentially done or near done?\n\n$AVGO - Amazing long term growth. Dividend has been RAPIDLY increasing. Can't imagine Broadcom getting smaller but just like NEE how much more growth is there still?\n\n$NVDA - INSANE long term growth. Big player in the market. Doubtful they are going anywhere in the future\n Trash dividend. And once again they have grown so much idk how much more they are likely to grow.\n\n$PYPL - Amazing long term growth. PayPal rumored to be moving into Ecommerence. Huge player for electronic transactions. I forsee them continuing to grow into the future.. No dividend \n\n$PENN - Amazing long term growth. Analysis put a $100 PT. I dont see gambling EVER going anywhere in the future. \n\n$COST - Decent long term growth. I feel like Costco is going to continue to grow as a super giant into the future. Dividend is slightly lacking. \n\n$U - New IPO. Unity is a huge player in the mobile app industry. If expect growth with them branching out. Not to mention I dont see mobile app using another company to this degree.\n\n$T - Mainly for the dividend. 10yr growth is a mere 2% on average. I feel like HBO MAX and the casual dividend increase will make up for this long term. \n\n$JPM - Decent long term growth. Bad PR recently but I dont see that holding it back. Dividend is pretty prime and the banking sector will grow once interest rates are settled. \n\n$CRSR - New IPO.HUGE player in the ESports community. Doesn't seem to be slowing down at all. Big on Twitch.tv with sponsorships and the streaming industry. Esport is a rapidly growing industry. Sadly no dividend as of now. \n\n$KIRK - There site is a overstock wayfair look alike. In the future I can see them rapidly growing just as those did. Even to some degree the growth potential would be massive.\n\n$JMIA - Essentially the amazon of Europe/Africa. Branching out into the African market. The growth on this seems like it could be exponential.\n\n$AGO - New IPO. Sells camping gear as well as GUNS and AMMO. Comparing it to camping world [$CWH] seems like there's alot of potential growth in the market.",

        "selftext": "Okay degens,   \n\n\nI'll get right on with the autism.   \nThurs/ Friday we saw a lot of the tech giants move toward correction territory.   \nBut one still has too much meat on the bone.   \n\n\nNvidia (NVDA) , though one of my favorite companies is likely to tank post (or before) earnings for the following reasons.  \n1.) The acquisition of ARM is baked into the price. This is expected to be heavily contested by China, the UK , and the US (Who already is looking at tech under a microscope).   \n\n\n2.) The \"Supercycle\" of new video cards is also baked in, but most retailers reporting inventory report receiving fewer than 20 units per week. The new cards on the onset had problems crashing, and the cards were software detuned in the following weeks. Also nvidia's board partners opted to use more expensive and reliable hardware to offset this problem, which may or may not erode part of the margin on these products. The in house fab cards already seem to have razor thin margins as the quality, materials, and manufacturing process by all accounts are expensive.  \n\n\n3.) Nvidia leaks showed their hand too soon. Teases of the new gen video cards with double the memory capacity and possibly a better (7nm vs 8nm) die process has myself and many that I know waiting until their release to buy into this generation. \"Why buy a 700 product when I know one 40% faster is coming out behind it for probably $800.  \n\n\n4.)  AMD  is catching up in this space, and will gain some market share this cycle. I can't forecast how much, but their new line of video cards while still a ways off of nvidia's prowess have gained some ground. AMD has successfully toppled intel's CPU dominance, and is targeting Nvidia's market now.  \n\n\n5.) Game delays such as cyberpunk 2077 will delay buyers of the new gen into next quarter.  \n\n\n6.) Most importantly, while most analysts are bullish about NVDA many value it in the $300-$350 range.  I know that this has been a less important factor in the past year. But the market shed a lot of weight this past week with big companies now trading at or under their avg analyst price target.   \n\n\nI'm no professional, this isn't financial advise and all purely opinion. Also, Disclosure I have 2x $40 SQQQ calls exp 11/06, 20 SQQQ shares, and 20 SDOW shares. I may buy NVDA puts monday exp after earnings, and maybe more SQQQ Calls expiring later in Nov.",

Given the expiry is far off and bidask isn't that high, I like this one.\n\n[Track at: https:\\/\\/www.tradytics.com\\/bullseye-dashboard?alert=-0iKPo-RG0gG-hZkub-kNLsR-GIR79](https://preview.redd.it/w1rl4iiqpbv51.png?width=1633&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b9b7b43f29390f8523aff3317df22cbe613bb0c8)\n\n# SBUX\n\nStock price right at long time resistance so as long as that doesn't get broken, this seems like a decent contract although a bit costly. There was quite a lot of volume on the stock on Friday but couldn't break resistance ([https://i.imgur.com/7OkTQBO.png](https://i.imgur.com/7OkTQBO.png)).\n\n[Track at: https:\\/\\/www.tradytics.com\\/bullseye-dashboard?alert=-evZJ1-ARQRV-ERvAz-o5GNy-tVuI4](https://preview.redd.it/6xuv8hy7qbv51.png?width=1638&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1a96ca16e832de73025d89297f0b2dfd63b13cb5)\n\nSome people asked me about how these alerts are generated for the watchlist. I have built a system that analyzes options flow all day and tries to extract patterns that usually result in bullish or bearish movements in the underlying options contract. I am happy to talk more about the specifics of the system for whoever wants to know about them.\n\nHave a great week ahead everyone.\n\nThoughts?",

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, October 6, 2020**\n\nStocks traded mixed today as market participants digested a host of new developments around Pres. Trump\u2019s health after his COVID diagnosis, Chairman Powell\u2019s remarks, the prospect for additional fiscal stimulus, and the resurgence of the Virus in some hotspots.\n\nThe Nasdaq (QQQ) finished the day 1.78% down, the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) finished the day 1.42%, and the Dow (DIA) finished the day 1.37% down.\n\nToday, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell gave a virtual address at the National Association of Business Economics\u2019 annual address to discuss the Fed\u2019s outlook for the economy during this pandemic. In his address, Powell once again (for the hundredth time it seems) reiterated the need of further fiscal stimulus to support the pandemic-stricken economy and promote faster recovery. He said, \u201cThe recovery will be stronger and move faster if monetary policy and fiscal policy continue to work side by side to provide support to the economy until it is clearly out of the woods.\u201d\n\nElsewhere, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi echoed Powell\u2019s comments. She said. \u201cChairman Powell\u2019s warning could not be more clear: robust action is immediately needed to avert economic catastrophe from the devastation of the coronavirus pandemic. It is long overdue for Republicans to join us in passing a bill that meets the needs of the American people.\u201d \n\nAt the moment of writing this recap, Pres. Trump tweeted \u201cNancy Pelosi is asking for $2.4 Trillion Dollars to bailout poorly run, high crime, Democrat States, money that is in no way related to COVID-19. We made a very generous offer of $1.6 Trillion Dollars and, as usual, she is not negotiating in good faith. I am rejecting their request, and looking to the future of our Country. I have instructed my representatives to stop negotiating until after the election when, immediately after I win, we will pass a major Stimulus Bill that focuses on hardworking Americans and Small Business.\u201d Immediately after this tweet, the markets turned sharply downwards and the VIX turned sharply upwards (VIX is an indicator of market participant\u2019s risk sentiment). Pelosi responded by saying, \u201cTrump is not willing to crush the virus\u201d and that \u201che puts himself before the nation\u201d\n\nTrump departed Walter Reed National Military Medical Center yesterday and returned to the White House, just days after entering the hospital on Friday to be treated for Covid-19. White House physician Dr. Sean Conley said Trump had \u201cmet or exceeded all standard hospital discharge criteria,\u201d while conceding that he \u201cmay not be entirely out of the woods yet\u201d in his recovery process.\n\nJust four states in the US are reporting a decline in coronavirus cases, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. In Wisconsin, new cases are averaging at about 2,400 daily -- the third highest in the country behind Texas and California. That's up 15% from what the state was averaging in the previous week. At least 22 states are reporting more new cases than the previous week, with many across the Midwest and now increasingly in the Northeast.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Crude oil rose above $40 per barrel.\n* Shares of Boeing (BA) fell after the company announced cuts to its 10-year outlook for aircraft demand amid falling demand due to the pandemic.\n* White House agrees to FDA\u2019s guidelines for vetting COVID-19 vaccine candidates. \n* N.Y. COVID Patients hospitalized are 700 today, highest single day total since July.\n* The 'recall-unemployment' rate fell to 2.9%, while the share of Americans who weren't expecting to be called back to work once conditions improved grew, according to a study by Stanford Economics Dept.\n* Apple announced an event on Oct. 13, which analysts believe will be used to announce the new model of iPhones and their 5G compatibility. \n* Tesla\u2019s (TSLA) new factory in Berlin is being constructed at record pace. The factory is expected to produce Tesla's Model Y, Model 3 and eventually a more affordable $25,000 Tesla. Now a new post from Tesla fan site Tesmanian has quoted anonymous sources claiming up to 4,000 employees will be working in the new factory by March 2021. Vehicle production is scheduled to start June 2021. \n* PPG Industries had target raised by UBS group from $132 to $142 at BUY\n* Purple Innovation  (PRPL) had target raised by Oppenheimer $25 to $37 OUTPERFORM\n* Nvidia (NVDA) upgrade by\n   * Raymond James reiterated BUY\n   * BMO Capital Markets raised target  from $565 to $650 to OUTPERFORM\n* Generally across the board Analysts are upgrading banks:\n   * Barclays upgraded Credit Suisse\n   * Bank of Nova Scotia and Bank of Montreal upgraded by Bank of America (BAC)\n   * BAC upgraded by JPMorgan\n* Costco (COST) upgraded by\n   * Barclays Upgraded $400 NEUTRAL to OVERWEIGHT\n   * Credit Suisse raised target $328 to $370 NEUTRAL\n* Beyond Meat (BYND)\n   * Piper Sandler raised the target from $130 to $178 at NEUTRAL\n* Advance Auto Parts (AAP)  upgraded by JPMorgan Chase &amp; Cofrom $183 to $190 NEUTRAL to POSITIVE\n* US trade deficit up to $67.1 billion in August, a 14-year high, according to the Department of Commerce.\n* General Electric Company (GE) shares were down over 4% in recent trading on Tuesday after it received a \"Wells notice\" from the US Securities and Exchange Commission, according to a company filing. According to the notice, the SEC's staff is considering recommending a civil injunctive action against the company for possible violations of securities laws.     \n* Quanterix (QTRX) said on Tuesday the National Institutes of Health has picked the company to progress to the second-stage contract worth $18.2 million to speed up the development of a COVID-19 test kit based on its ultra-sensitive Simoa technology.\n* The Australian government on Tuesday announced plans to cut income taxes, create jobs for young people and stimulate business investment with a raft of pandemic measures that would create a record 214 billion Australian dollar ($153 billion) deficit in the current fiscal year.\n\n\"All I need is within me now!\" Tony Robbins",

        "selftext": "A little bit of background. I started trading options in May and managed to build up about $16k in profits. Took some losses along the way, but none have been close to where I am now.\n\n I am in a pickle and not sure where to go from here. So I have two NVDA $562.5 calls 11/27 that are down $3250 (about 40%) and a Zoom $580 call 11/27 (stupid I know) that is down $3275 (about 66%). \n\nThis past week it has just gotten worse and worse and I know I should\u2019ve cut losses earlier, but I didn\u2019t and now I\u2019m here. \n\nI still believe in NVDA (cup and handle forming on the daily chart), ZM not so much. I know I still have 5 weeks until expiration and I could make some losses back if I hold, but I also don\u2019t want to dig myself into a deeper pit. \n\nI\u2019ve been trying to decide whether to just cut losses for both positions at market open on Monday and reset after elections or take the risk and see what next week brings. Any advice helps. I\u2019m about 50/50 on cutting losses and moving on and holding to try and recover some losses this up coming week or two. Thanks in advance.",

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, October 12, 2020**\n\nStocks traded higher today as market participants looked ahead to stimulus talks in Washington that appear to be progressing and an upcoming round of quarterly that are expected to be improved relative to earlier in the year.\n\nThe Nasdaq (QQQ) was on fire today, finishing the day 3.09%, as the rebound in big tech continues from the September lows.. The S&amp;P (SPY) finished 1.59% up and the Dow Jones (DIA) finished 0.87%.\n\nProspects for further fiscal stimulus coming from Congress has been a main point of interest for traders since the CARES Act, the first round of stimulus passed in March, ran out on July 31. Though prospects for additional passage before the November election are slim, recent reports of a $1.8 trillion proposal coming from the White House and renewed talks between Treasury Secretary Mnuchin and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Last week\u2019s meetings between the pair did not produce an agreement, both parties are optimistic that a deal will  be worked out. In an interview with CNN, White House economic advisor Larry Kudlow offered an upbeat assessment of the negotiations, saying that \u201cthe bid and offer is narrowing somewhat between the two sides.\u201d While there is a large delta between both proposals, the fact that the White House is showing a willingness to negotiate and compromise is a good sign that negotiations are going forward in good faith. \n\nThird-quarter earnings begin in earnest this week. A host of big banks, including JP Morgan (JPM) and Citigroup (C), will report earnings tomorrow. Big banks, which have underperformed the broader market since the March bottom, will provide valuable information into the extent of the ongoing strain to the US economy as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. \n\nFor this earnings season, analysts expect companies to report more year-on-year declines in profits due to business difficulties arising from the pandemic. According to data collected by FactSet, consensus estimates predict a earnings per share decline of 20.5% over the last year for companies in the S&amp;P 500. This earnings season comes at a very interesting time, with the market primed for several market-moving events, including the possibility of vaccine and therapeutic breakthroughs to treat coronavirus and uncertainty surrounding the upcoming presidential election. According to analysts at Goldman Sachs (GS), \u201cNew information on the election, vaccines, and upcoming 3Q earnings represent substantial cross-currents for equities during the next two months. However, the vaccine represents a more important factor than the election result for the recovery in S&amp;P 500 fundamentals. In short, the progress of the US economy depends more on developments surrounding the disease rather than political elections or candidate differences in restoring the broken fundamentals of the stock market. \n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Amazon (AMZN) Prime Day starts today at Midnight and runs through to Wed, Oct 14. Over the course of the two days, more than 1 million items will be discounted, including heavily discounted \u201cLightning Deals\u201d for prime members. \n* Tomorrow, Apple (AAPL) is expected to present the next generation of iPhones (iPhone 12) and its 5G capabilities.

Policy makers have previously indicated that they were willing to consider negative interest rates amid the economic pressures caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n* Deutsche Bank (DB) today had interesting price target raises today, it turned bullish on the following stocks: Google (GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Snapchat (SNAP), Pinterest (PINS), Facebook (FB), and Twitter (TWTR). It also initiated coverage on DraftKings (DKNG) with a price target of $48 at HOLD and Snowflake (SNOW) with a price target of $305 at BUY.\n* Twitter (TWTR) was upgraded by Deutsche Bank from $36 to $56 and HOLD to BUY.\n* PepsiCo (PEP) was upgraded by Citigroup (C) from $148 to $169 from NEUTRAL to BUY\n* Allegiant Travel (ALGT) was upgraded by Barclays from $100 to $150 from UNDERWEIGHT to OVERWEIGHT\n* Snapchat (SNAP) got price target raised by Deutsche Bank[ (](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24DB&amp;src=cashtag_click)DB) from $28 to $32 at BUY\n* Renewables Energy Group (REGI) had its target raised by Credit Suisse Group from $60 to $74 at OUTPERFORM.\n* PInterest (PINS) had target raised by Deutsche Bank (DB) from $43 to $55 at BUY.\n* NXP Semiconductors (NXPI)  with another price target raise from Morgan Stanley from $147 to $159 at OVERWEIGHT.

When they quit trading publicly, they were reported to having 78.5M revenue and a market cap of 247.61M. Since then, they have acquired a handful of companies and continue to grow; these can be seen on the wikipedia page below.  A source mentions that they have \\~5x this revenue now.\n\nThis seems to be a solid company at first glance, based on the incredibly impressive customer list (Microsoft, NVIDIA, Oracle, Google, Blackrock, Honeywell, GE, Facebook, Pepsico, AMD, Boeing, etc.) and the industry.

        "selftext": "Howdy y'all,\n\nI'm thinking of buying the SPY and selling long OTM calls to improve ROI in my long term retirement accounts. Obviously, the idea is the OTM Premium will be profit and will be much larger over the long term than any loss earned from exercise. \n\nI'd like to combine this with two other things\n\n1.) Margin, at a rate of about 1.6-1.0 (53% max drawdown ((drawdown of SPY in 2008 housing crash ((( what the Buffett uses))) )) ), to increase the amount of stock owned, and therefore calls sold.\n\n2.) Using the portfolio value to secure puts that can be sold on high value stocks like AAPL, MSFT, or NVDA. This is like running a straddle on SPY, except I've divorced the downside risk onto another stock's movements. In other words, since I'm using SPY to secure the Put, even if the Put becomes assigned for a stock like AAPL, all I need to do is sell some of the SPY, and use that to purchase the shares of AAPL. The amount of puts need to be sold such that if all the Puts were to be excercised, that total amount of liquidity cannot exceed my Drawdown value, because obviously I need to cover the Put if that were to happen. The intent is that, hopefully, SPY and AAPL won't both crash at the same time. However, considering March, that is possible.\n\nRecap; buy stock with margin, sell very OTM calls secured by stock, sell OTM Puts secured by Portfolio value in a different stock, collect twice as much premium, enjoy being rich.\n\nI plan to do this with Interactive Brokers due to their tiny, tiny margin rates. I'm asking your thoughts, for a reality check, and if securing puts with Portfolio value is possible.",

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap  - Friday, October 9, 2020**\n\nStocks traded higher today as market participant\u2019s closely monitor developments in a new virus-relief package amid mixed signals from top officials as to the size and scope of a proposal they might support.\n\nThe Nasdaq (QQQ) led the day, finishing the day 1.53% up. The S&amp;P (SPY) finished 0.86% up and the Dow (DIA) finished 0.54% up.\n\nTraders continue to closely monitor developments out of Washington weighing whether more stimulus will be passed, be it comprehensive or targeted. Despite Pres. Trump\u2019s recent tweet saying he was not willing to negotiate further stimulus until the election, negotiations appear to continue. According to top officials and economic analysts, the passage of additional is key in encouraging and fast-tracking the recovery of the pandemic-stricken economy. \n\nAccording to multiple reports from CNBC, the Wall Street Journal, Bloomberg and others, the White House is prepared to offer a new stimulus proposal totalling $1.8 trillion, about $400 billion below what the Democrats are asking for but an increase from the original $1.6 trillion offer. It's unclear what specific provisions will be included in the drafted legislation, but the earlier plan included a fresh round of $1,200 stimulus checks; expanded unemployment benefits at $400 per week and additional funding for state and local government. While a large gap still remains between the two proposals, let\u2019s hope that the White House showing willingness to negotiate adds goodwill and Congress can come to an agreement. Today Trump tweeted \u201cCovid Relief Negotiations are moving along. Go Big!\u201d\n\nAdding to the optimis, White House economic advisor Larry Kudlow told Fox Business that the President \u201cwants to do a deal.\u201d This is a remarkable turnaround considering Pres. Trump\u2019s recent tweet where he said he was not willing to negotiate an additional deal. The market has positively responded to this development.\n\nYesterday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin discussed further stimulus for about an hour. After the meeting Drew Hamill, Pelosi\u2019s spokesperson, said in a tweet that Mnuching made clear the President\u2019s interest in reaching an agreement for a comprehensive package after Pelosi made clear he would not support a standalone, targeted bill. In a note to clients Jeffrey Buchbinder, LPL Financial Equity Strategist said, \u201cA compromise on a big stimulus package in Washington could potentially deliver another October surprise, but the odds are against it as Election Day approaches.\u201d\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* The Wall Street Journal reported that  Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) is in advanced talks to acquire Xilinx (XLNX) in a deal that could be valued at more than $30 billion. Shares of AMD were down more than 4% because of the dilutive effect the deal will have on the stock. XLNX was up 14.7% throughout the day.\n* The personal-computer shipments rebound that's benefited from a surge in remote work and study during the pandemic carried into the latest quarter with a 12.7% increase from the year earlier, the highest growth in a decade, according to research firm Canalys.     \n* Weed stocks have been on a tear recently, after VP Kamala Harris said the Biden Administration would federally decriminalize marijuana. \n   * Aphria (APHA) up 28% this week.\n   * Canopy Growth (CGC) up 27.5% this week. \n   * Aurora Cannabis (ACB) 8.2% up this week.\n* Wedbush tech analyst Michael Pachter reiterated his conservative neutral rating on Gamestop (GME) and kept an $8 price target despite the recent partnership with Microsoft (MSFT). \n* Twitter (TWTR) announced it will make posts harder to go viral ahead of the US election, including placing limits on how users can retweet to try and prevent the spread of misinformation.\n* Sky Solar Holdings (SKYS) announced it completed its merger with Square (SQ). As a result, SKYS is now a subsidiary of SQ and will no longer be publicly traded.\n* Microsoft (MSFT) announced it will permit some staff to permanently work remotely.\n* Realty Income (O) was upgraded by JPMorgan from NEUTRAL to OVERWEIGHT with a price target of $28.50, price is currently around $23.\n* New Street Research  analyst Pierre Ferragu issued a SELL rating on $NVDA with a price target of  $400 , a loss of about 25%. Most analysts rate as BUY or better.\n* JPMorgan analyst Richard Shane upgraded Rocket Companies from Neutral to Overweight and cut his price target from $31 to $28.50.\n* VFC had target raised by Telsey Advisory Group $72 to $90 at OUTPERFORM, and also by Robert W. Baird from $65 to $85 at OUTPERFORM. Stock is at $78 so bullish call.\n* Blackrock (BLK) had its price target raised by Morgan Stanley from $652 to $686 at OVERWEIGHT\n* Capital One Financial (COF) had targets raised by JPMorgan and Piper Sandler to $86.50 and $89 respectively, both at OVERWEIGHT. Pretty bullish action.\n* Mcdonald (MCD) had target raised by BMO Capital, Jefferies Financial, Truist, and BTIG Research to $235, $265, $246, and $245. All with POSITIVE rating.\n* Service Now (NOW) had a price target raised by Barclays from $486 to $581 and from POSITIVE to OVERWEIGHT. We have played this stock since March, it is an absolute beast!\n* Marvell Technology (MRVL) with a myriad of price target raises from Needham, Benchmark, Cowen, Oppenheimer, Deutsche Bank on average around $50. \n* NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) once again with a barrage of price target raises from Loop Capital, Cowen, Barclays, Raymond James, Citigroup, Wells Fargo, Needham, Piper Sandler and Jefferies Financial. On average they have $160 target, and the stock is at $140, most of them are OVERWEIGHT except for Citigroup which is NEUTRAL.\n* On Semiconductor (ON) had target raised by Jefferies Financial and Deutsche Bank to $31 and $30 respectively, they both rate at BUY. This is a nice call, as Deutsche bank is well respected, and semiconductor stocks have been hot hot hot... Keep an eye out!\n* Datadog (DDOG) had a price target raised by Barclays  from $107 to $126 at OVERWEIGHT.\n* Amazon (AMZN) got the price target raised by Mizuho to $4,000 at BUY. really bullish call! \n* Silver and Gold great performers today\n* Some notable performers: XLNX 14.7%, GSX 11%, FSLY 9%, DDOG 9%, U 8.3%, EBAY 6.9%, NVCR 6.9%, PTON 6.5%, NET 5.8%, ETSY 5.5%, KGC 5%, COUP 4.8%, NXPI 4.5%, WIX 4.4%, FTNT 4.2%, STM 4.1%, RYCEY 26.7% (third time this week its up double digits for the day!)

        "selftext": "Hey guys, I'm relatively new to investing and quite young, and after a fair amount of research, I would love to hear your thoughts on a few stocks I've been eyeing for my portfolio. I am looking to create a portfolio that I won't touch for at least 5 years (besides the last stock I list here, which looks intriguing). I plan to invest a relatively small amount (only three to five thousand) as I am only 20, and that is already the lion share of my funds. So without further ado:\n\nT ----- bought a good chunk of shares (\\~34) when it was at its lowest during the pandemic. The dividend plus potential from 5G looked especially interesting to me. I'm pretty comfortable holding on to it, especially at the price I got it, but I am curious as to what you think of AT &amp; T's potential for the next 5 years. \n\nNKE ----- Seems like Nike is really taking control over their products and brand name, closing a bunch of high profile accounts with 3rd party vendors. This new strategy seems interesting and I think it is particularly telling that many experts (i.e. Barrons) almost unanimously list it as a buy even though the stock went up $10 dollars a share this week alone. \n\nABBV ---- Seems like a solid stock with a fair amount of potential products coming out in 2021. Plus, they have a hefty dividend (they're a dividend aristocrat) and have the best selling drug in the world, Humira.\n\nNVDA ----- Incredibly solid company with ridiculous annual growth over the past few years.  Regardless of whether the ARMS acquisition happens, it seems like a real champion in a very lucrative field (semiconductors).\n\nMSGE ---- this one is purely speculative. It seems like New York City is shutting down again, which I imagine will be detrimental to MSGE (which owns Madison Square Garden and other entertainment complexes). If played right seems like it could be bought for a bargain with potentially very high rewards by even the summertime or next year.",

        "selftext": "\nFor Trading October 15th\n   \nBANKS BEAT BUT FALTER\n \n\n Added some QQQ putskis today.\n\n \nToday\u2019s market was interesting\u2026not good or bad, just interesting.  It always concerns me when the earnings news is good and the market falls.  UNH, BAC, and GS all reported, and the numbers were good, and all fell well off the highs, with UNH the only one to close up, and only pennies at that.  After the hotter than expected PPI numbers came out, the open was slightly higher, but it didn\u2019t last long.  After the DJIA hit the high for the day +120, it turned down and by 11:00 it was down for the day.  The DJIA finished -165.81 (.58%), NASDAQ -95.17 (.80%), S&amp;P 500 -23.26 (.66%), the Russell -15.20 (.93%) and the DJ Transports the big winner at +105.67 (.90%).  Internals were soft at 1.5:1 on NYSE and 1.9:1 on the NAZ.  The DJIA was 10 up, 20 down, with UNH the biggest decliner paring 64 DP\u2019s off the average.  Tomorrow we have UAL, WBA, MS, and TSM reporting as well as the continuing and initial claims, Phili Fed, Empire State and Export / Import numbers for Sept.  Lots of stuff to digest.\n\n\nTonight\u2019s closing comment video: https://youtu.be/Z-R_NRe9TLM\n \nSee our Honest  Abe trade records for the year in our video/ discord etc...\n\nSECTORS:  There was good news for the banks, again, but by midday it just didn\u2019t matter.  Today\u2019s losers were BAC, GS, and the biggest loser, UNH which was trading +2.50 premarket and never even made it to unchanged, finishing -9.57, which cost the DJIA 64DP\u2019s.  There was some good news for holders of Concho Resources.  The talk is that they are a takeover candidate and after hitting $51.00 it closed on the lows, but still +4.79 (10.8%) on the day.  FSLY holders weren\u2019t quite so lucky.  The stock which traded $10.63 in March has been a juggernaut, hitting $136.50 yesterday, reported after the close that their prior expectations of revenue \u201cshould not be relied upon.\u201d  It seems that geopolitical concerns had hampered their operation.  The customer is the parent company of TIK TOK!  While the numbers given (they report on 10/28) aren\u2019t terrible, when your stock has risen the way this one has, it\u2019s a problem. The last on it in late trading was $91.28 -37.55 (30%) after a low of $86.40.   Even at this lower price, the stock is still up from the start of the year by 400%.\nAnother favorite, DraftKings (DKNG) has not acted well since doing their offering last week priced about $4.00 under the market @ $52.00 and has not been able to climb back over that level.  The stock closed $48.04 -3.14 today (6.14%).  The continuing Covid-19 issues for major sports teams and cancelled and postponed may be weighing on the stock in the short term.  \nAfter the close VRTX reported the end of their trial on a protein-deficiency treatment.  The stock fell from its close of $371.46 -4.63 to trade $235.01 and closed $239 -37.09 (13.43%).\n \nNew Group:\nAIR &amp; CRUISE LINES were HIGHER with +.64, HA +.03, ALK +.53, and XTN $61.57 +.52 (.85%).\n \nFOOD SUPPLY CHAIN was LOWER with TSN +.26, BGS -.24, FLO -.11, CPB -.15, CAG -.38, MDLZ -.38, CALM -.15, JJSF -.43, SAFM +.03, HRL -.41, SJM -1.12, PPC +.89, KR -1.10, and PBJ $34.56 -.28 (.78%).\n \nBIOPHARMA was LOWER with BIIB -3.46, ABBV -.40, REGN -3.02, ISRG -4.27, GILD +.01, MYL -.28, TEVA -.08, VRTX -37.10, BHC -.04, INCY -3.36, ICPT -.80, LABU -4.26, and IBB $141.60 -2.74 (1.9%).\nCANNABIS: was LOWER with TLRY -.03, CGC -.42, CRON -.10, GWPH +.68, ACB -.23, CURLF -.18, KERN -.17, and MJ $11.49 -.13 (1.12%).\n\nDEFENSE was HIGHER with LMT +3.52, GD -.35, TXT unchanged, NOC +2.29, BWXT +.88, TDY +2.94, RTX +.47, and ITA $163.58 +.90 (.55%).\n\nRETAIL: was MIXED with M -.02, JWN -.13, KSS +.04, DDS +.32, WMT -2.23, TGT -2.04, TJX +.03, RL +.72, UAA -.29, LULU -4.34, TPR +.08, CPRI +.01, and a new addition GPS +.27, and XRT $54.07 -.45 (.83%).\n \nMEGA-CAPS &amp; FAANG were HIGHER with GOOGL -4.56, AMZN -91.63, AAPL -.29, FB -4.74, NFLX -15.09, NVDA -7.93, TSLA +13.70, BABA +9.33, BIDU +8.65, CMG -3.84, CRM -6.85, BA +1.36, CAT +1.49, DIS -2.36, and XLK $122.02 -.65 (.53%).\nPLEASE BE AWARE THAT THESE PRICES ARE LATE MARKET QUOTES AND DO NOT REPRESENT THE 4:00 CLOSES.\n \n \nFINANCIALS were LOWER with GS +.42, JPM -.44, BAC -1.20, MS +.64, C -.64, PNC -2.61, AIG -.07, TRV -.86, V -1.82, and XLF $24.78 -.24 (.96%).\n \n \nOIL, $41.04 +.84, Oil was near recent highs and sold off hard Friday touching $37.61 (down about 6%) before mounting a rally back to close today just over $41, near recent highs. The stocks were MIXED with XLE $30.52 +.13 (.43%).\n \n \nGOLD $1,907.30 +12.70, opened HIGHER and made a slightly higher high and a higher low, closing near the highs of the day.  There were several \u201cunusual options action\u201d looking for another 10-12% on the upside before year end.  \n \n \nBITCOIN: closed $11410 -30. After breaking out over $10,000 we have had a \u201crunning correction\u201d pushing prices toward $12,000, reaching a recovery high of $12220 Thursday, and after a day of rest in between, we resumed the rally touching $12,635, but have sold off back to support. We had 750 shares of GBTC and sold off 250 last week at $13.93 and still have 500 with a cost of $8.45. GBTC closed $12.20 -.18 today.\n \n Tomorrow is another day.\n \nCAM",

        "selftext": "Talking about companies that are at a relatively small market cap compared to their long-term potential. \nAvoiding companies that are already major growth names like TSLA, SQ, NVDA, etc.\n\nI'll contribute ShiftFour payments (FOUR) which at around 5B market cap is not exactly small, but IPO'd less than 6 months ago and still pretty unknown. Their adoption is growing across a number of industries including e-commerce. They're my most speculative bet on a company that could take a significantly larger piece of the payments processing market than they have now.\n\nSecond one is Rapid7 (RPD) which is a cloud security company that counts 45% of the Fortune 100 as customers. Still it was something I haven't seen mentioned in conversations about smaller growth names. I think it's a nice ride-along play for cloud adoption without having to bet on the success of individual cloud players.\n\nLastly to include a truly speculative name without a number at the end of it: Audioeye (AEYE). At just under 200M market cap, it's a very small company in the niche of providing digital content accessibility solutions/compliance. They accomplish this primarily through the use of AI-powered solutions.\nThey may not have a huge TAM, but compared to their current market cap I think they have a lot of room to grow.",

        "selftext": "I reposted this because I thought it would be helpful to newbs like me and was buried under some other comments, feel free to delete if necessary.\n\nI'm pretty new to this, about 8 mo consistently trading each month. Started with $1000 doing risk defined because that's what TD allowed me to. I now make $150-250/mo. This was really helpful as it does me to work with a small set of strategies. I'll list them in a sec.\n\nTheory to trade: Honestly watch YouTube. Tastytrade, personally I love mike and his whiteboard for a good basis. Watch his Playlist on fundamentals and strategies. Then tom and the other guy on that strategy on historical p/l and win loss for strike and management. Note IV rank and percentile  during trades. Note capital and make a playback.\n\nFrom this I learned a few takeaways.\n\n1. The news is worthless for the most part but \"may\" indicate things to steer away from, ie bankruptcy.\n2. VIX, High IV rank and percentile indicates people working about the market. Worrying makes them want to buy insurance for their portfolio. \n3. High IVs make bigger premiums. Lower IV smaller premiums.\n4. Expect to lose on some trades. Keep a notebook (or excel) and know your time to lose may be today. Never risk more than 50% on small accounts like mine or 25% on larger. Really it is about not over extending yourself or being cash poor to get out of bad situations due to BP.\n5. Trade on stocks or etfs that are the size of your account. I trade ONLY under $50 stokes with $1 strikes. No NVDA for me. When I fist traded my first one was an IC on NVDA and it blew past my marker and lost $350 (1/3 of my balance) in a day. Luckily I used a trailing stop or it oukf of been $5000.\n6. Use trailing stops on up and down.\n7. Trade small. Don't  be greedy.\n\nDuring corona or high iv these strategies have worked for me but I'm new and have option limitations.\n\n30-45dte with 1 standard deviation.\n\n1. ICs- large BG needed with lower gain but very consistent on slow stocks like X.\n2. Jade lizards - same with the slight bullish \n3. Short puts on stocks under $5\n4. Verticals that are $150 bp for $70 gain\n\nNeed experimenting and testing\n1. Broken butterfly with bullish on small stocks \n2. Straddles once I'm able $3k balance\n3. IC with leap wings and selling short 30-45dte straddles. This loses for the first 3 trades ever when you win but then the debits are paid so each straddle is just credit premium, so could be good.\n\nHope this helps. As you can see I tend to like neutral delta with theta cr. decay.",

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning October 12th, 2020.\n\n# **Earnings could be a positive force for stocks as Washington continues to wrangle over stimulus  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/09/earnings-could-be-a-positive-force-for-stocks-as-washington-continues-to-wrangle-over-stimulus.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Stock market optimism for a stimulus package has been rising, but the focus swings to earnings and that could be a positive for stocks in the week ahead.\n*****\n&gt; JPMorgan, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, Bank of America and Morgan Stanley all release earnings in the first big wave of corporate reports. There is also some important data, including CPI inflation data Tuesday and retail sales for September on Friday.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIt looks like earnings season might turn out better than expected, based on early reports,\u201d said Ed Keon, chief investment strategist at QMA. \u201cThe guidance looks pretty good. So, we have earnings season upon us, the stimulus talks go back and forth, and it looks like maybe there\u2019s a will to get something done.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; On Friday afternoon, the White House raised its offer for at stimulus package to $1.8 trillion but was still below the $2.2 trillion sought by Democrats. \u201cIt\u2019s really hard to read,\u201d said Keon.\n*****\n&gt; But he said even if there\u2019s no agreement on stimulus now, there should be a package after the election, regardless of who wins. \n*****\n&gt; \u201cI actually put some money to work in small caps on the belief if we get further stimulus either soon or a few months from now, you do want to own economically sensitive stocks,\u201d said Keon.\u201cWe\u2019re reasonably constructive on the market and valuations are not cheap, but compared to the 10-year [Treasury yield] at less than 80 basis points, stocks don\u2019t look that bad.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Stocks in the past week had their best performance since early July, with the S&amp;P 500 up 3.8% at 3,477. The small cap Russell 2000 was up 6.4%. The 10-year Treasury yield had a big move during the week from about 0.70% to as high as 0.79% Friday. Yields move opposite price, and the 10-year yield has now broken out of a range its been stuck in below 0.70%.\n*****\n&gt; Earnings could provide positive momentum for stocks, if companies continue to beat estimates at a healthy pace, like last quarter.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cQ2 reporting season saw S&amp;P 500 earnings beat at an unprecedented rate, both in terms of breadth (85%) and size (+20%), prompting historically rare, strong upgrades to forward estimates, especially for the cyclicals, and one of the strongest earnings season rallies on record,\u201d wrote Deutsche Bank strategists.\n*****\n&gt; The summer earnings rally came before the big September decline, which took the S&amp;P 500  down about 10%. The S&amp;P 500 is up more than 8% since Sept. 24.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWhile the bottom-up consensus for Q3 is for a sharp rebound in headline earnings, the bulk of it is being driven by reductions in loan loss provisions and Energy sector losses. Excluding these, underlying earnings growth is forecast to barely move up (-15% to -13%), despite rising Q3 GDP growth estimates pointing to a strong macro rebound,\u201d they noted.\n*****\n&gt; The Deutsche strategists said the question remains, however, whether the market will respond to earnings beats or election uncertainty.\n*****\n&gt; Keon said the market has been moving up as former vice president Joe Biden extended his lead in the polls because there\u2019s less chance of an uncertain outlook the more one candidate leads. According to RealClearPolitics, he was leading President Donald Trump by 9.7 percentage points, from just about  6 points at the beginning of the prior week.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think from the market\u2019s perspective, it doesn\u2019t really matter who wins, as long as we have a clear winner,\u201d said Keon. \u201cI think the direction of the polls are suggesting that we\u2019re going to have a clear winner either on election night or a few days after that. The risk of a messy contested election is going down, and the market is relieved by that.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Tom Block, Washington analyst at Fundstrat, said Trump appears to be hoping for a stimulus bill signing before the election to help his re-election effort.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThere are many moving parts here, and they\u2019re all moving in different directions,\u201d said Block. \u201cIt\u2019s not impossible a deal comes together but the pathway to a deal is not clear on Friday afternoon because of the mixed signals that have come out over the last seven days from the White House.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has opposed a large package, and the two sides have been stalemated. \u201cI think the president believes that he will be helped by having a signed ceremony at the White House approving the bill, that the optics of signing the bill that\u2019s going to send relief to people is an optic he desperately wants, and it can\u2019t hurt,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; The economic recovery is going on in the background, and some parts of the economy have shown real improvement, like housing.\n*****\n&gt; Retail sales on Friday is a good look at how the consumer has been faring, now that enhanced unemployment benefits have been gone for the past two months. Economists expect 0.6% gain in retail sales, the same as August.\n*****\n&gt; Keon said it is important to get some more help for the economy through stimulus. There is expected to be one-time payments to individuals and enhanced employment benefits.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThat would be good news for the market, if we could get more help where it is needed. We really just need to get a bridge for a more normal circumstances next year,\u201d said Keon.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/4K1MVFr.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/TogcA3z.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/LSeLvCN.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/ksFc8um.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/xCRPIpj.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/pbYmOWI.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/U3OyIJ0.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/qnhClbM.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/eD2gAHd.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/ow0caWu.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/nznrtfX.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/bm1ckAt.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Ten-Baggers Under Trump\n\n&gt; In our prior post we looked at the best and worst performing S&amp;P 500 stocks since Election Day 2016. In this post we've broadened our filter and looked at the Russell 3,000, which is an index that covers more than 98% of all publicly traded market cap in the US. Within the Russell 3,000, there are 32 stocks that are up more than 1,000% since Trump was elected. These 32 \"ten-baggers\" -- as Peter Lynch liked to call them -- are listed in the table below.\n\n&gt; At the top of the list is Enphase Energy (ENPH), which is up 8,892% since Election Day 2016. While Enphase has \"Energy\" in its company name, it's actually a Technology sector stock that \"manufactures software-driven home energy solutions that span solar generation, home energy storage and web-based monitoring and control.\" Next up is Zynex (ZYXI) with a gain of 7,211%, followed by Digital Turbine (APPS) up 5,320%. ZYXI markets itself as a \"better and safer way to manage pain\" than opiods using electrotherapy devices. APPS is an app marketing company that helps app developers get their product on as many devices as possible.\n\n&gt; Of the 16 best performing Russell 3,000 stocks since Election Day 2016, 15 come from either the Technology or Health Care sectors. XPEL is the only stock in the top ten that's not in either the Tech or Health Care sectors. Up 2,341% since Trump was elected, XPEL is a Consumer Discretionary stock whose main product is to provide auto-paint protection.\n\n&gt; Along with the names mentioned already, other notables on the list of ten-baggers under Trump include Jack Dorsey's Square (SQ), pet-food maker Freshpet (FRPT), digital health company Teladoc (TDOC), the arts and crafts social media company Etsy (ETSY), and of course, Tesla (TSLA). With a gain of 1,002% since November 8th, 2016, Tesla just barely makes the cut!\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/tenbaggers.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Best Performing Stocks Since Election Day 2016\n\n&gt; On Monday we published our asset class performance matrix showing total returns for key ETFs since Election Day 2016 (11/8/16). Today we wanted to highlight the individual stocks traded on US exchanges that have performed the best and the worst since President Trump surprised the world with a victory over Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. First off, below is a chart showing the average performance of stocks in each S&amp;P 500 sector since Election Day 2016. (These are based on stocks currently in the index and not as the index stood on 11/8/16.)\n\n&gt; As shown, the average stock in the broad S&amp;P 500 is up 67.3% since Trump was elected. Four sectors have posted stronger average returns than that -- Technology (+160.4%), Health Care (+100.3%), Consumer Discretionary (+74.6%), and Industrials (+69.9%).\n\n&gt; The Energy sector stands out like a sore thumb in the chart below. While every other sector has at least averaged double-digit percentage gains, the stocks in the Energy sector are down an average of 52.3% since Trump was elected! Other sectors that have been weaker than the broad market include Real Estate, Consumer Staples, and Financials.\n\n&gt; If you were to ask most people back in November 2016 which areas of the market should outperform under Trump and which should underperform, you'd likely see results that are the exact opposite of what has actually happened. Sectors like Energy, Real Estate, and Financials would have been expected to benefit from Trump since those are the industries he's most associated with, while Tech is a sector that's usually expected to benefit more when the Democratic party is in control.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/avgsector.png))**\n\n&gt; Looking at individual stocks, below we show the 46 stocks currently in the S&amp;P 500 that are up at least 200% since Election Day 2016. Two stocks -- Etsy (ETSY) and Advanced Micro (AMD) -- have been \"10-baggers\" with gains of more than 1,000%, while another three -- Paycom (PAYC), NVIDIA (NVDA) and DexCom (DXCM) -- are up more than 500%. Other names on the list are a who's who of the most popular stocks over the past few years, including Adobe (ADBE), Netflix (NFLX), Apple (AAPL), Amazon.com (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), salesforce.com (CRM), and PayPal (PYPL).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/bestsince16.png))**\n\n&gt; While there are 46 stocks in the S&amp;P 500 up more than 200% since Election Day 2016, there are 32 stocks that are down more than 50% over the same time frame. The Energy sector is the most represented on this list by far with 14 stocks overall and 10 of the worst 11! The only non-Energy stock in the top ten is General Electric (GE), which is down 76% since Trump was elected. Other notable losers include airlines and cruiselines like AAL, CCL, and NCLH, and consumer stocks like TAP, KHC, UAA, WBA, and LB.\n\n&gt; General Electric (GE) and Exxon Mobil (XOM) are the two names that stand out the most. Each of these stocks were at one point in time the largest company in the world, but they're both now shells of their former selves with huge losses over the last four years. Remember these two examples when you're looking at the largest companies in the world right now. Chances are a few of them will experience similar fates as GE and XOM over the next ten to twenty years.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/worstsince16.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # News High for Net New Highs\n\n&gt; Yesterday, the S&amp;P 500 closed at its highest level since only a few days after the early September high. While the index has yet to reach a new high, many individual stocks in the index have. As shown in the charts below, 11.71% of S&amp;P 500 stocks closed at a new 52-week high yesterday while no stocks closed at a new 52-week low. That makes for the second-highest net new highs reading of the pandemic with the only higher reading (17.62%) occurring just over a month ago at the last all-time high on September 2nd. Before that, the last time net new highs were as high as now was on February 19th: the last all-time high before the bear market began.\n\n&gt; As for the individual sectors, there has also been a significant pickup in the net percentage of new 52-week highs. Industrials currently has the highest reading of net new highs among the 11 sectors at 26%. Just like the broader S&amp;P 500, that is the highest since September 2nd when the net percentage of new highs rose above 30%. Consumer Discretionary is the runner up in being the sector with the highest percentage of net new highs. One distinguishing factor, though, is whereas every other sector has seen higher readings at some point since the bear market in the spring, Consumer Discretionary's current reading of 18% is tied with the reading from August 24th. On the other end of the spectrum, both Communication Services and the Energy sector have seen no new highs over the past few days. Granted, there have not been any new 52-week lows either. Meanwhile, Financials and Real Estate have both seen an uptick in net new highs, but it has been much more modest than other sectors.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/100920-Net-New-Highs.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Breadth Booming\n\n&gt; One of the most notable aspects of the rally off the late September lows has been broad participation. As shown below, breadth is very strong as the 10-day advance-decline lines for several sectors are at some of their highest levels of the past year. For the S&amp;P 500, the 10-day advance-decline line is at its highest level since June 8th. The same can be said for Communication Services, Consumer Discretionary, Financials, and Real Estate. For Consumer Staples, the sector's 10-day A/D line is at its highest level since June of 2019 and for Health Care it is at its highest level since May of 2019. In the case of Technology, it has been even longer as that sector's line is at its highest level since last April.\n\n&gt; While broad participation is healthy for the long-term prospects of a rally, these 10-Day A/D lines have gotten extremely overbought in the near term, suggesting a cool-down period is likely in the days ahead.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/100820-10-day.png))**\n\n&gt; With short term breadth running very hot, the cumulative A/D lines of several sectors are breaking out to new highs as well. Utilities and Materials are the only sectors to have seen prices reach a new high in the past few days alongside their cumulative A/D lines. As for the other sectors, Consumer Discretionary, Consumer Staples, Health Care, Materials, and Tech have also all seen new highs for cumulative breadth. The same applies to the S&amp;P 500, but again, none of these have yet to see price do the same.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/100820-cumulative-ad-f.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Election-Year October Market Performance Volatile since 1950\n\n&gt; October\u2019s history of volatility was recapped in the October Almanac as well as it being the worst performing month of election years since 1950. In the following chart we have plotted election-year October performance for DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ, Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 since 1950 (NASDAQ since 1972 and Russell indexes since 1980) alongside their historical performance excluding gruesome election-year October 2008.\n\n&gt; With or without October 2008, historical performance has been uninspiring in election years. Excluding 2008, October has generally started off on a positive note, but by around the fourth trading day, strength has tended to fade with weakness persisting until around the eighth trading day. Then a modest rally ensued through mid-month followed by more weakness and finally a rally to end the month. Grey shading highlights the two historical windows of weakness that could setup our Seasonal MACD indicators.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/9deab1b6431375946cf0104830334e3a/1b58acd0d015098f-cf/s500x750/1a07b8cea97519bcce57adae974614a0e426effb.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending October 9th, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED.)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 10.11.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED.)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/eD2gAHd.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/rotewK3.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 10.12.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 10.12.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday  10.13.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/2lSi1kT.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 10.13.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Wj80iaX.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 10.14.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ZY9TwgO.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 10.14.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/5LizPLJ.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 10.15.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/oIstn4O.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 10.15.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/uKfmmCC.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 10.16.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Q3isONG.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 10.16.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Swqo1ow.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. $101.20\n**JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.

I've played other tech options, NVDA, AMD, AMZN, TSLA but it always felt like pure gambling. I made about 40k on NVDA but got burned for 20k on TSLA and AMZN. I don't recommend playing options on tech stocks unless you're YOLOing stimulus money or a paycheck.\n\nOption trading on WSB has become exactly that but there are still handful savvy people that are playing smart. Sure, in the beginning when you have less than $10k, you can take higher risk for higher reward. But when you accumulate over 50k or 100k, you can invest on plays like this that gives you 10-15% return consistently without having to risk losing 80%.\n\nMy advice is once you hit 50k, don't chase option plays like ZOOM or obscure meme plays like PRPL.   \nPlay monthly options on lower intrinsic value call options like WMT or TGT. Don't hold for earnings unless you have options that are over 1 month till expiration.\n\nIf you manage to get past 100k, then put 75k in APPL or AMZN or NVDA and you can do whatever you want with the 25k. This has worked for me and hopefully this inspires this community to play smarter and make money.\n\nNow I will go to local Costco and get some rotisserie chicken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fevp23hboiq51.png?width=1053&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dcc0b91dfe2ccfcd8c5ee0ea0eefd0ab2d28a254\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kbst9qwgoiq51.png?width=972&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0891a965f84b59a91b7341b519bf5588fbe61c7d\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xpj57o7loiq51.png?width=941&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c49437265d557ea40dc8cbc7446a68df76a36c3e\n\nIt wasn't all glory and there were days when my unrealized loss was 30k or 40k but you have to set a price target or an exit date and be discipline. I took this screenshot to remind myself to always be humble and disciplined. I'm still holding some of these and they are now 20k unrealized gain.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3o38stz9piq51.png?width=1173&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e6b3da0b4825d1543c15e1c91996bd1e00480107",

        "selftext": "\\#**WHY #AMD #IS #GOING #TO #THE  #MOON**  \n\n\n\\#1\n\n**Heavily Rumoured New CPUs (including 16 core gaming CPU).**\n\nThis would be revolutionary and will put investors into a complete frenzy. The slide was leaked and confirmed by [videocardz.com](https://videocardz.com) which is a very authentic source for tech news. A 16 core CPU that pulls 105w at a reasonable price will be GAME-CHANGING, and everyone will want to get their hands on it.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f4y8kvv3blq51.png?width=1569&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b0e772c7f4963cb569eb0024dcee84fb63b4697e\n\nAlong with this game-changing chip, 3 additional CPUs are rumored to be released.   \n\n\n\\#2\n\n**Big Navi having possibly better performance**  \nThere have been leaks off Newegg of Big Navi being better than the 3080. Even if the cards are neck in neck AMD will be able to paint the 6000 series cards as better due to minor discrepancies.\n\nRadeon RX 6900 XT\t5,120\t1,500\t16GB GDDR6\t512\t256-bit\t300  \n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRadeon RX 6800 XT\t3,840\t1,500\t12GB GDDR6\t384\t192-bit\t200  \n\\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRadeon RX 6700 XT\t2,560\t1,500\t6GB GDDR6\t384\t192-bit\t150  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x0zjsju2clq51.png?width=970&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=14551f974837dfc21662c24da268d5284287d169\n\n  \n\\#3\n\n**NVIDIA 3rd Party Card Catastrophe**\n\n*(this section is from my previous post)*\n\nSo most GPUs are made by a 3rd party. AMD and NVIDIA make the actual \"brain\" of the GPU but 3rd party partners add onto it for better performance (very basic explanation). Don't ask me why this is, it is just mainly because of logistical reasons.\n\nBut that is not the point, the point is that the great majority of GPUs are third-party cards meaning that they get to change around the design of the PCB. The issue here is that some of these third-party partners cheaped out on little capacitors.\n\nBy cheapening out it is leading to bad power delivery. The only way to fix this rn is to downclock the card which the normal person doesn't know how to do and doesn't expect is necessary when they are buying a 500$+ piece of hardware.\n\nI feel like if there is a mass callback that will be bad PR. NVIDIA could always release drivers that make the cards run below their listed spec but i'm not sure if people will really want that even if the performance loss is marginal.\n\nEVGA already confirmed the suspicions that these cards were crashing because of capacitor issues. It may be different for other companies but at least for EVGA this is what they are saying currently.\n\n**But why does this matter??**\n\nPeople who were looking to pick up a next-gen GPU right away are now hesitant and will wait for AMDS offerings. The people who did return their GPUs will also possibly wait. Faulty cards will most likely get a down clock which will make Big Navi look better. It supposedly already is better and this 3-5% difference could really change people's minds.  \n\n\n\\#4 \n\nLisa Su is an absolute unit. She will for sure talk about their timeline and plans for 5nm/3nm. I am guessing that this will rally investors to invest because they will see shinny 5nm/3nm while Intel is just getting to 10nm.  \n\n\n**POSITIONS:**  \n\\+95 call  (exp 12/18)  \n\\- 100 call (exp 12/18)\n\n(*call me a pussy for using a debit spread but I think its the best for my case)*  \n\n\nif you have something else you want to share comments below and I will add it!\n\nSources:\n\n[https://videocardz.com/newz/amd-ryzen-9-3950x-to-become-worlds-first-16-core-gaming-cpu](https://videocardz.com/newz/amd-ryzen-9-3950x-to-become-worlds-first-16-core-gaming-cpu)\n\n[https://www.igorslab.de/en/what-real-what-can-be-investigative-within-the-crashes-and-instabilities-of-the-force-rtx-3080-andrtx-3090/](https://www.igorslab.de/en/what-real-what-can-be-investigative-within-the-crashes-and-instabilities-of-the-force-rtx-3080-andrtx-3090/)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6bUUEEe-X8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6bUUEEe-X8)\n\n[https://www.tomshardware.com/news/evga-nvidia-rtx-3080-capacitor-caused-crashes](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/evga-nvidia-rtx-3080-capacitor-caused-crashes)\n\n[https://www.tomshardware.com/news/newegg-insider-reportedly-reveals-radeon-rx-6900-xt-rx-6800xt-rx-6700-xt-specifications](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/newegg-insider-reportedly-reveals-radeon-rx-6900-xt-rx-6800xt-rx-6700-xt-specifications)\n\n*This is not financial advice just me presenting the facts and the possibility of a callback.*  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b2ciqo9vdlq51.png?width=662&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=64d0fa79a87e74390c112a07e8d93a82c5a8476e",

Would graciously appreciate someone with maybe some more knowledge opinion.\n\nWould love any insight you guys have on these tickers. Thanks again any constructive thoughts are GREATLY appreciated.  \n\n$NEE - Amazing Long term growth. Attempting to buyout other companies. Dividend has been rapidly increasing. Is the growth potentially done or near done?\n\n$AVGO - Amazing long term growth. Dividend has been RAPIDLY increasing. Can't imagine Broadcom getting smaller but just like NEE how much more growth is there still?\n\n$NVDA - INSANE long term growth. Big player in the market. Doubtful they are going anywhere in the future\n Trash dividend. And once again they have grown so much idk how much more they are likely to grow.\n\n$PYPL - Amazing long term growth. PayPal rumored to be moving into Ecommerence. Huge player for electronic transactions. I forsee them continuing to grow into the future.. No dividend \n\n$PENN - Amazing long term growth. Analysis put a $100 PT. I dont see gambling EVER going anywhere in the future. \n\n$COST - Decent long term growth. I feel like Costco is going to continue to grow as a super giant into the future. Dividend is slightly lacking. \n\n$U - New IPO. Unity is a huge player in the mobile app industry. If expect growth with them branching out. Not to mention I dont see mobile app using another company to this degree.\n\n$T - Mainly for the dividend. 10yr growth is a mere 2% on average. I feel like HBO MAX and the casual dividend increase will make up for this long term. \n\n$JPM - Decent long term growth. Bad PR recently but I dont see that holding it back. Dividend is pretty prime and the banking sector will grow once interest rates are settled. \n\n$CRSR - New IPO.HUGE player in the ESports community. Doesn't seem to be slowing down at all. Big on Twitch.tv with sponsorships and the streaming industry. Esport is a rapidly growing industry. Sadly no dividend as of now. \n\n$KIRK - There site is a overstock wayfair look alike. In the future I can see them rapidly growing just as those did. Even to some degree the growth potential would be massive.\n\n$JMIA - Essentially the amazon of Europe/Africa. Branching out into the African market. The growth on this seems like it could be exponential.\n\n$AGO - New IPO. Sells camping gear as well as GUNS and AMMO. Comparing it to camping world [$CWH] seems like there's alot of potential growth in the market.",
