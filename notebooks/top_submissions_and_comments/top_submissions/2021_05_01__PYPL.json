        "selftext": "Hi I\u2019m turning 19 soon and I have invested 90% of my savings since last year to have a combined net worth of little more than 13k. I currently live abroad but I expect to go back  in less than a year. I use a foreign brokerage that charges me for all the transaction and exchange rate, which is quite high. So I refrain from trading as much as possible, meaning I have to hold shares for a long time to make a sizable gain. In practice, a 2-2.5% gain would break even due to currency exchange fees and taxes mostly.\n\nMy main question is if these stocks are good enough to hold for at least 5 years. Idk if I\u2019ll change my brokerage once I go back to the states or not, but if I decide to continue to use it I don\u2019t have to sell anything. I currently hold the following:\n\n- AMZN, GOOGL, AAPL, MSFT, PYPL, TSLA, HD, LOW, WMT, KO, VIG, JNJ, PG, ABT, COST, SBUX, TGT, ICLN\n\nWhen choosing stocks I didn\u2019t really look through the financial sheets. I simply bought companies that looked relatively stable and well known anywhere I go. Let me know what you think!",

        "selftext": "I just wanna point this out for people who might be afraid to buy this stock right now. SQ is trading at a 7 PS ratio, that\u2019s more than half of what it was on dec 22nd 2020. \n\nThe only times it\u2019s traded at a lower PS ratio than this post 2017 were Dec 2018, Aug 2019-Jan 2020 and March 2020 - May 2020. If you bought this stock in June 2020 or February 2020 you were buying it at an 8 PS ratio which is a higher valuation than what it is today.\n\nLet\u2019s compare this to PYPL. PYPL is growing at a steady 30% Y/Y and currently trading at a 12 PS ratio. SQs revenue growth Y/Y for the latest quarter is 266% and for the 2 previous ones it was over 100% for both. So SQ is growing revenue this fast yet trading at 2/3 the value of PYPL\n\nAlso in June 2020 PYPL reported 5.26 billion in revenue and had a market cap of around 180 billion, last quarter SQ reported 5.06 billion in revenue and has a market cap of 89 billion\n\nWith a valuation like this how much more will these growth stocks sell off? and why are people afraid to buy more with bargains like this",

        "selftext": "This started as a comment reply but I thought maybe people would like reading it. I've been researching Palantir since literally late November 2020 and I have nearly my entire portfolio in LEAPS expiring January 2023. So I have continually done more research on them this is just the basics to clear up confusion and help people who don't understand it because it's hard to hear all the hype and stuff. Also AMC to the moon tomorrow for my FDs I bought!! Don't judge me it's just fun to be in on the action on weeks like this.\n\n\nSo you should think of palantir as basically three companies and they actually are very far from unprofitable. \n\nThey developed the really massive government software (gotham) specifically as a result of an interaction that happened to Peter Thiel while he was at paypal. They were losing millions to foreign scammers at paypal and the solution ended up being a high quality algorithm that flagged the most likely scam transactions and then allowed analysts to efficiently double check and verify the real scam transactions.\n\n It essentially was using what computers are efficient at (sorting through massive amounts of data) and then combining that with what humans are good at (looking at the more complex nuances that at least at that point computer algorithms were incapable of doing) and augmenting the humans ability to make complex decisions by rapidly sorting through the incoming data and bringing everything good to their attention.\n\nThey fixed paypals using this method and literally made the company profitable overnight because of fixing how much they were losing in the scam transactions. The FBI contacted PayPal and Thiel about using that initial software. That was literally his inspiration for what would become Palantir. He goes over it in huge detail in his book zero to one. If you make an audible account you can read it for free and find the chapter I'm talking about.\n\nThen for 15 years they perfected the government software into the absolute nearly monopoly it is now in government intelligence augmentation software. The whole time though they reinvested almost everything for the last 10 years into building the commercial software (Foundry). That side of the business has only been live for a VERY short time and initially they literally didn't spend a single dollar on marketing their first commercial clients sought THEM out because of their insane reputation with the government. Foundry helps with supply chains and all kinds of other important data  insights. But if you want a recent example the NIH and the NHS both used Foundry to figure out how to best distribute the vaccine and vaccine distribution in the US and Britain has far outpaced expectations. You think commercial companies aren't going to be interested in using the software that was literally proven on a level like that?\n\n They're only just now adding huge amounts of people to their sales teams literally in the last six months which if you read Peter thiels book is insane for the stock because they have this crazy long term plan and he literally talks about how when they get to a certain point and start adding sales as a full sector of the company it means that is the company the company plans to BEGIN scaling. Meaning they're this big and they literally only just started on the scaling part. Which they've also said in tons of interviews if you're a die hard Palantirian like me. \n\n\n\nThey actually also have the third side of the  business which is their actual like full AI for weaponization and war and defense for the government. Gotham is like helping analysts and commanders lead and even helping police or agents figure out what's going on. This other software is different. It's called Apollo and its only at the beginning too. It's like pure AI machine learning AI handles everything stuff. Go find a video called pentagon head of NSC briefs public on AI I think it's on the PBS channel on YouTube or some shit. Or you can listen to Joe Biden talk about how we're going to double our percentage of gdp spending on AI. The amount of government money that's going to go into AI as a weapon to compete with China DWARFS peoples expectations of how much large the market for the kind of software palantir makes is. \n\nhttps://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201001005334/en/U.S.-Army-Research-Lab-Selects-Palantir-Technologies-Inc.-for-91M-Artificial-Intelligence-and-Machine-Learning-Development\n\nThis is literally the backbone of everything AI that the government is about to invest in. Sure they're going to experiment with other research but if you do research you'll also find Palantir is the ONLY company that does anything remotely like this software that has anywhere near the kind of clearances like what is required for these contracts. They are currently a clearance level 5 and about to be the highest 6. The closest competitors are almost all a 3 or lower I'm not even sure if there's more than a single 4 and that stuff is crazy hard to get. \n\nBut like again I'm an obsessive. I realize why people get so excited about the commercial side scaling and how it's very possible and can make them huge and it will. But I'm actually pretty sure the reason people like Cathy Wood has such a huge boner for them is that she realizes how MASSIVELY. And I mean MASSIVELY underestimated the amount of government revenue they will get from all this AI investing the United States and NATO are about to do. It's literally the next Manhattan project and they're absolutely going to be one of the biggest players developing it if not the biggest. I think it's funny because most people are pretty disinterested in the government stuff for Palantir but i really think the weaponized AI apollo stuff may be as big as anything could ever be. \n\n\n\n\nAlso people got the insider selling stuff very very wrong. Tom Nash (love him or hate him I don't care) has a few really good recent videos where he explains it in basically full detail what was happening. The selling panicked a lot of retail investors during a time when the buying for growth markets had really slowed because of rate hike due to inflation scares and a ton of retail holders got scared and caused more selling and more people got scared because of that and sold and it really just was mass psychology in effect and a LOT of FUD and confusion. \n\nBasically a few executives karp in particular got billions of dollars worth of options that vest but literally expire so you have to exercise them which means you buy shares of the company at a strike price. Well because it's the company granting shares the strike price is literally 10 cents or something and these automatically have to vest at quarterly increments. So everytime karp was exercising he's actually buying shares. Like over 150 million in total maybe a lot more million SHARES not dollars. shares. And even those when he exercising he's buying shares technically from the company it ALL counts as profit on taxes and ITS NOT LONG TERM CAP GAINS ELIGIBLE. So over the last year plus this year he's essentially getting shares but the literal dollar value of those shares to the government counts as pure profit. So his total income which he's getting taxed at 40% of is in the BILLIONS yes billions. Because that's a lot to handle people that work for them actually automatically schedule sells of shares to cover the taxes so that there's no issue it's not even like him saying sell today and they do this.... TO AVOID ANY POSSIBLE ACCUSATION OF INSIDER SELLING TO THE SEC. That's why it's automatically happening so no one can ever claim he's timing it. \n\nSo listen cause here's where it gets important. The exercising of the shares counts as almost pure profits but remember he's receiving SHARES not dollars he doesn't actually get billions of dollars. So has to then sell SOME of the shares so he can pays taxes on that. Then when he sells the shares to pay the taxes for exercising he actually owes even more money if they went up from when he exercised. So everytime he's selling low its actually good for him because it's less ADDITIONAL PROFIT that he would owe taxes on.\n\n If he wasn't selling its because he thought it would go down even further and then he would actually owe less taxes overall. So if he thought it was going to tank he'd wait and actually get a nice fat discount on his taxes. \n\nI know this seems really crazy but I promise that's how it works you can look it up in detail but yeah shocking that mainstream media and redditors/youtubers who barely do research and have no real understanding of how these billion dollar compensations work would get it wrong. Unbelievable I know. If he had actually sold the massive overall percentage of his shares that some people claim he did the company would be at like $3-6 dollars not low 20s. Retail got confused because of market pressured due to interest rate fears from inflation and sold low (like retail always does) to institutions.",

As a stipulation of the agreement Verizon will maintain a 10% stake in the new company, which Apollo plans to call \u201cYahoo.\u201d Apollo releases earnings on Monday, May 3rd. \n\nChip manufacturers have been inundated with demand following 2020\u2019s COVID shutdowns and the, undoubtedly correlated, increase in demand for consumer electronics. Cisco, one of the world\u2019s largest chip manufacturers, is struggling to keep up with demand. \n\nCisco revealed several steps it is taking to alleviate the imbalance in supply and demand including a $4.5 billion acquisition of Acacia Communications and a $20 billion plan to build two new manufacturing plants in Arizona. Cisco CEO Chuck Robbins commented extensively on the situation, and estimates it could \u201c...\\[take\\] another six months\u2026\u201d for the company to resume normal operation. Around 85% of all internet traffic passes through Cisco hardware. \n\nThe effects of the shortage can be seen across industries. Among companies affected by the shortage are car manufacturers. Wayne Griffiths, head of VW\u2019s Spanish brand, spoke on the issue, stating that the company will, \u201c...need to face considerable challenges in the second quarter\u2026\u201d So far the shortage has prevented the company from building over 100,000 vehicles.  \nGM reports earnings on Wednesday and markets will be curious to see if the chip shortage has affected them. Despite supply chain concerns CNBC\u2019s Jim Cramer was optimistic in his recent review of the company, saying \u201cIf you want to bet on electric vehicles with much less risk, I say buy some Ford or General Motors\u2026 these are huge, established companies with improving balance sheets and real earnings, earnings that happen to be skyrocketing right now...\u201d\n\nThe United States Government has also expressed concern regarding the chip shortage. United States President Joe Biden held a conference with business leaders in April to address the issue. During the conference the President expressed a desire to move more chip manufacturing into American plants, citing 75% of global manufacturing as being based in East Asia.   \nMeanwhile Taiwan-based chip manufacturing giant TSMC announced a plan worth $100 billion USD to expand their companies manufacturing capacity. The announcement comes in tandem with company founder Morris Chang\u2019s plea to the Taiwanese government for increased support, citing a fear that if the Taiwan-based manufacturer fails to meet demand US or Chinese manufacturers will fill the gap. \n\nThe increase in demand for electronics caused by the pandemic has boded well for Apple, who reported earnings of $1.40 per share on Wednesday, April 28th, exceeding analyst estimates of $0.98 after a strong Q2 for sales. The earnings call comes on the heels of Apple\u2019s first product showcase of the year Wednesday April 21st, and the company\u2019s announcement that it will be taking steps to increase its footing in the instant messaging market. Apple stated it plans to increase the amount of features provided by it\u2019s iMessage app, with the objective being to bring it more in line with popular messengers offered by Facebook, WhatsApp, and Snapchat. \n\nMicrosoft reported earnings of $1.95 per share Tuesday, April 27th, beating analyst estimates of $1.78 by a small margin. Microsoft, who also saw an increase in demand for its technology as a result of the pandemic, has greatly benefitted from an increased demand for cloud-services. Microsoft\u2019s cloud-based service hub, Azure, posted 2020 growth of 43%. The company expects to post great earnings despite the current chip-shortage, having generated much of its growth from the pandemic in the software-as-a-service sector. \n\n**Some of the Companies with Earnings this Week**\n\n**Monday, May 3rd:**  \nEstee Lauder  \nApollo Global Management Inc  \nCarvana  \nON Semiconductor Corp  \nThe Mosaic Company  \nChegg Inc.\n\n**Tuesday, April 27th:**  \nPfizer  \nT-Mobile  \nCVS  \nActivision Blizzard  \nConocoPhillips  \nSysco  \nZillow  \nXilinx  \nHelloFresh  \nUnder Armor  \nWestern Union  \nMcAfee  \n**Wednesday, April 28th:**  \nPaypal Inc.  \nUber  \nGeneral Motors  \nTwilio Inc  \nMetLife Inc  \nBudweiser Brewing Company  \nBarrick Gold Corp.  \nFranco-Nevada Corp  \nEtsy Inc  \nFox Corp  \nGoDaddy  \nZynga  \n**Thursday, April 29th:**  \nSquare  \nNintendo  \nModerna  \nMonster Beverage Corp  \nRegeneron Pharmaceuticals  \nRoku Inc  \nAIG  \nAllstate  \nWayfair Inc  \nCBS Corp  \nPeloton Interactive  \nCloudflare  \nExpedia  \nKellogg Co.  \nAlliant Energy Corp.   \nPenn National Gaming  \nNorwegian Cruise Line Ltd.  \nDropbox\n\n**Friday, April 30th:**  \nDraft Kings  \nNCsoft",

        "selftext": "Paysafe is one hell of a company. They are a fin-tech like PayPal and Squares, thus should be given a higher multiple for valuation. They got a lot of exciting and growth customers like Barstool (PENN), YouTube (Google), Twitch (AMZN), FanDuel (PDYPY), Roblox (RBLX), CoinBase (COIN), Visa (V), ApplePay (APPL), BetMGM (MGM), Spotify (SPOT), Microsoft/Xbox etc., and on top of that they got a huge digital wallet (#2 in market share) where you can trade/buy the fast-growing cryptocurrencies like Bitcoins. I truly believed this Paysafe is undervalued compared to its peers. You can read a very good Paysafe DD below on reddit and it gives a lot of insight of Paysafe valuation and bear cases:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/mysz54/reviewing\\_the\\_bear\\_case\\_on\\_paysafe\\_psfe/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/mysz54/reviewing_the_bear_case_on_paysafe_psfe/)\n\n(the link above is a really really good read with lots of info about Paysafe, so I\u2019m not going to repeat most of the good points the author mentioned in that sub.)\n\nMost of the time analysis use assumptions to make predictions on future growth. As an example, EV-related stocks (PLUG, BLNK, QS, LAZR, NKLA, BLDP, etc) get higher or ridiculous valuation based on assumption that gasoline cars will eventually be phased out. As you can see most if not all of these companies are unprofitable and some don\u2019t even have revenue, yet worth billions. While this assumption may be accurate, it is extremely hard to know 1) how big the market is 2) How many competitors each company has 3) when will growth begin to accelerate. Because of this predictive nature, it\u2019s really hard to know how long you will have to hold onto the stocks before they pop. When or if it will pop is anyone's guess. So while holding onto these stocks will likely result in wild price swings thus high risk / high rewards.\n\nBut what if you have the data before you showing the financial growth of your customers or partners? If your customers/partners' revenue grows, it\u2019s more likely than not they are using more of your products or services. Paysafe is one such company where you can actually look at their customers/partners' financial reports to predict where the company will go in the future and when growth will start. For this reason, Paysafe is more of a lower risk but still has high reward potential.\n\nPaysafe will be reporting earning for the very first time as a public company again on May 11. The good news is we already have their customers results in and here are some breakdown of their 1st QTR results showing huge growth:\n\n1. PENN (Reported May 7, 2021) - \u201cPenn National\u2019s income from operations rose to $216.5 million in the first quarter against ($560.6) million in the prior-year quarter. Adjusted EBITDAR jumped 77.2% from the year-ago quarter to $447 million. Moreover, adjusted EBITDAR margin expanded to 35.1% from 22.6% a year ago.\u201d ( source: [https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/1515673/penn-national-penn-q1-earnings-revenues-beat-estimates](https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/1515673/penn-national-penn-q1-earnings-revenues-beat-estimates) )\n2. DraftKing ( Reported May 7, 2021) - \u201cDraftKings is raising its fiscal year 2021 revenue guidance from a range of $900 million to $1 billion to a range of $1.05 billion to $1.15 billion, which equates to year-over-year growth of 63% to 79% and a 16% increase compared to the midpoint of our previous guidance\u201d\n\n(Source: [https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/05/07/2225374/0/en/DraftKings-Reports-First-Quarter-2021-Results-and-Raises-2021-Revenue-Guidance.html](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/05/07/2225374/0/en/DraftKings-Reports-First-Quarter-2021-Results-and-Raises-2021-Revenue-Guidance.html) )\n\n3. Spotify (April 28th, 2021)- \u201cRevenue increased 16% to \u20ac2.15 billion ($2.6 billion) from \u20ac1.85 billion ($2.22 billion) in the same period last year\u2026.\u201d (source: [https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/streaming/9564180/spotify-q1-2021-earnings-report/](https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/streaming/9564180/spotify-q1-2021-earnings-report/))\n\n4. Youtube/Google ( April 27th, 2021 ) - \u201c In its first-quarter earnings report Tuesday, Google parent company [Alphabet](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/GOOGL) said YouTube [brought in](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/27/alphabet-goog-earnings-q1-2021.html) revenue of $6.01 billion in advertising revenue during the quarter \u2014 up from $4 billion from a year ago, for a growth rate of 49%. That\u2019s an acceleration over its 46% growth in Q4. It\u2019s also nearly twice the growth rate of Netflix, which reported 24% revenue growth [in Q1](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/20/netflix-nflx-q1-2021-earnings.html), and [expects](https://s22.q4cdn.com/959853165/files/doc_financials/2021/q1/FINAL-Q1-21-Shareholder-Letter.pdf) growth to slow to 19% next quarter.\u201d (source: [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/27/youtube-could-soon-equal-netflix-in-revenue.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/27/youtube-could-soon-equal-netflix-in-revenue.html) )\n\n5. Skillz ( May 4, 2021 ) - \u201cRevenue grew to $83.7 million during the first quarter of 2021, up 92% over the prior year. Gross profit grew to $79.4 million during the first quarter of 2021, up 95% over the prior year.\u201d (source: [https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210504006307/en/CORRECTING-and-REPLACING-Skillz-Reports-Record-Q1-Revenue-and-Raises-2021-Guidance](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210504006307/en/CORRECTING-and-REPLACING-Skillz-Reports-Record-Q1-Revenue-and-Raises-2021-Guidance) )\n\nAs you can see these Paysafe\u2019s customers/partners are reporting explosive growth. While some of these companies may report an earning loss it may be due to higher expenses such as customers acquisition cost (i.e. Draftking). However, here we are more focused on their revenue as the more transactions they do the more likely all or part of that transaction is done by Paysafe. These companies reported earnings before Paysafe, so it can be highly expected Paysafe will report a very good earning and future growth projection tomorrow ( May 11).\n\nSeveral things to note about Paysafe besides their customer\u2019s earning growth. These factors will also influence Paysafe\u2019s future growth:\n\n1. They are a monopoly when it comes to iGaming/Sport Betting as you can see the explosive growth by DKNG, MGM, PENN, SKLZ, etc.\n2. Paysafe took a hit during the pandemic because they also do offline transaction processing, but now things are opening up we can expect going forward these offline transactions will grow again. Also, when re-opening occur, more sport events will occur thus more betting means more transactions for Paysafe.\n3. They are #2 in digital wallets and you can buy digital currency with the wallet. These currency has been generating huge revenue for PayPal and SQ (more on this below)\n\nFinally, both PayPal and SQ reported earning before Paysafe and their results beat estimation:\n\nPaypal earning ( May 5, 2021) \u201c Revenue: $6.03 billion vs. $5.90 billion expected by Refinitiv\u201d (source: [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/05/paypal-pypl-earnings-q1-2021.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/05/paypal-pypl-earnings-q1-2021.html) )\n\nSquare earning ( May 6, 2021 ) \u201cSquare reported a profit of 41 cents per share vs. 16 cents per share expected in a Refinitiv survey of analysts. It also brought in $5.06 billion of revenue vs. $3.36 billion expected by Refinitiv.\u201d ( source: [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/06/square-sq-earnings-q1-2021.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/06/square-sq-earnings-q1-2021.html))\n\nSo I can say with confidence Paysafe will likely beat their own guidance for Q1 on May 11th. For those of you who don\u2019t know Paysafe, they are not a small player. Their transaction volume is about that of SQ \\~$100 Billion. If Paysafe is able to show growth on par with PayPal and SQ they should be trading at a much higher multiple. See the reddit link above for DD on valuation.\n\nPaysafe involved with Gaming, Sports, digitalcurrency which I find very exciting and feel that if I own the stock I\u2019ll be part of the journey of growth with these sectors. Roaring Kitty/ DeepFuckingValue simply invested in GME because he liked the stock. I\u2019m investing in Paysafe simply because it's cool and sexy, regardless of its growth potential.\n\nIn summary, I think Paysafe is a low risk / high reward stock compare to other fintech. Their growth is easier to predict as we can rely on their publicly traded customers data which is showing high growth going forward. They got the 2nd largest digital wallet. They are involved in the highly popular and fast growth digital currency market. I believe as a monopoly in iGaming/Sport Betting their growth will be massive when the 4 largest states: CA, TX, NY, FL begin to allow online sport betting. This is something about Paysafe that I like so much because no other fintech has this space. This is a massive high growth area and they own the space. For these reason, I am extremely bullish and I like Paysafe for both short and longer term play.\n\nDisclaimer: I own Paysafe commons, warrants, and option calls. I am not a financial adviser.

        "selftext": "The comparisons between today's stock market and the dot-com bubble have frequently been made where markets crashed significantly after a long period of exuberance and over valuation. Assuming you are looking to invest for the foreseeable future, crashes should not be looked at as a bad thing but as an opportunity to accumulate businesses you like on the cheap. With that said, what stocks would you look to buy should the whole market crash 50%? I realize that this would depend largely on the context (i.e. the company's inherent valuation, etc). However, there must be businesses you would want to hold for 5-10 years that a crash would make very appealing. \n\nPersonally I'd love to build a position in the following should they crash and they fit my arguments as being value plays: \n\nMSFT\n\nPYPL/VISA\n\nCOSTCO\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'd also look to DCA into spy.\n\nLet's hear any picks you might have and what staple stocks you'd look to accumulate in a crash.",

        "selftext": "This started as a comment reply but I thought maybe people would like reading it. I've been researching Palantir since literally late November 2020 and I have nearly my entire portfolio in LEAPS expiring January 2023. So I have continually done more research on them this is just the basics to clear up confusion and help people who don't understand it because it's hard to hear all the hype and stuff. Also AMC to the moon tomorrow for my FDs I bought!! Don't judge me it's just fun to be in on the action on weeks like this.\n\n\nSo you should think of palantir as basically three companies and they actually are very far from unprofitable. \n\nThey developed the really massive government software (gotham) specifically as a result of an interaction that happened to Peter Thiel while he was at paypal. They were losing millions to foreign scammers at paypal and the solution ended up being a high quality algorithm that flagged the most likely scam transactions and then allowed analysts to efficiently double check and verify the real scam transactions.\n\n It essentially was using what computers are efficient at (sorting through massive amounts of data) and then combining that with what humans are good at (looking at the more complex nuances that at least at that point computer algorithms were incapable of doing) and augmenting the humans ability to make complex decisions by rapidly sorting through the incoming data and bringing everything good to their attention.\n\nThey fixed paypals using this method and literally made the company profitable overnight because of fixing how much they were losing in the scam transactions. The FBI contacted PayPal and Thiel about using that initial software. That was literally his inspiration for what would become Palantir. He goes over it in huge detail in his book zero to one. If you make an audible account you can read it for free and find the chapter I'm talking about.\n\nThen for 15 years they perfected the government software into the absolute nearly monopoly it is now in government intelligence augmentation software. The whole time though they reinvested almost everything for the last 10 years into building the commercial software (Foundry). That side of the business has only been live for a VERY short time and initially they literally didn't spend a single dollar on marketing their first commercial clients sought THEM out because of their insane reputation with the government. Foundry helps with supply chains and all kinds of other important data  insights. But if you want a recent example the NIH and the NHS both used Foundry to figure out how to best distribute the vaccine and vaccine distribution in the US and Britain has far outpaced expectations. You think commercial companies aren't going to be interested in using the software that was literally proven on a level like that?\n\n They're only just now adding huge amounts of people to their sales teams literally in the last six months which if you read Peter thiels book is insane for the stock because they have this crazy long term plan and he literally talks about how when they get to a certain point and start adding sales as a full sector of the company it means that is the company the company plans to BEGIN scaling. Meaning they're this big and they literally only just started on the scaling part. Which they've also said in tons of interviews if you're a die hard Palantirian like me. \n\n\n\nThey actually also have the third side of the  business which is their actual like full AI for weaponization and war and defense for the government. Gotham is like helping analysts and commanders lead and even helping police or agents figure out what's going on. This other software is different. It's called Apollo and its only at the beginning too. It's like pure AI machine learning AI handles everything stuff. Go find a video called pentagon head of NSC briefs public on AI I think it's on the PBS channel on YouTube or some shit. Or you can listen to Joe Biden talk about how we're going to double our percentage of gdp spending on AI. The amount of government money that's going to go into AI as a weapon to compete with China DWARFS peoples expectations of how much large the market for the kind of software palantir makes is. \n\nhttps://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201001005334/en/U.S.-Army-Research-Lab-Selects-Palantir-Technologies-Inc.-for-91M-Artificial-Intelligence-and-Machine-Learning-Development\n\nThis is literally the backbone of everything AI that the government is about to invest in. Sure they're going to experiment with other research but if you do research you'll also find Palantir is the ONLY company that does anything remotely like this software that has anywhere near the kind of clearances like what is required for these contracts. They are currently a clearance level 5 and about to be the highest 6. The closest competitors are almost all a 3 or lower I'm not even sure if there's more than a single 4 and that stuff is crazy hard to get. \n\nBut like again I'm an obsessive. I realize why people get so excited about the commercial side scaling and how it's very possible and can make them huge and it will. But I'm actually pretty sure the reason people like Cathy Wood has such a huge boner for them is that she realizes how MASSIVELY. And I mean MASSIVELY underestimated the amount of government revenue they will get from all this AI investing the United States and NATO are about to do. It's literally the next Manhattan project and they're absolutely going to be one of the biggest players developing it if not the biggest. I think it's funny because most people are pretty disinterested in the government stuff for Palantir but i really think the weaponized AI apollo stuff may be as big as anything could ever be. \n\n\n\n\nAlso people got the insider selling stuff very very wrong. Tom Nash (love him or hate him I don't care) has a few really good recent videos where he explains it in basically full detail what was happening. The selling panicked a lot of retail investors during a time when the buying for growth markets had really slowed because of rate hike due to inflation scares and a ton of retail holders got scared and caused more selling and more people got scared because of that and sold and it really just was mass psychology in effect and a LOT of FUD and confusion. \n\nBasically a few executives karp in particular got billions of dollars worth of options that vest but literally expire so you have to exercise them which means you buy shares of the company at a strike price. Well because it's the company granting shares the strike price is literally 10 cents or something and these automatically have to vest at quarterly increments. So everytime karp was exercising he's actually buying shares. Like over 150 million in total maybe a lot more million SHARES not dollars. shares. And even those when he exercising he's buying shares technically from the company it ALL counts as profit on taxes and ITS NOT LONG TERM CAP GAINS ELIGIBLE. So over the last year plus this year he's essentially getting shares but the literal dollar value of those shares to the government counts as pure profit. So his total income which he's getting taxed at 40% of is in the BILLIONS yes billions. Because that's a lot to handle people that work for them actually automatically schedule sells of shares to cover the taxes so that there's no issue it's not even like him saying sell today and they do this.... TO AVOID ANY POSSIBLE ACCUSATION OF INSIDER SELLING TO THE SEC. That's why it's automatically happening so no one can ever claim he's timing it. \n\nSo listen cause here's where it gets important. The exercising of the shares counts as almost pure profits but remember he's receiving SHARES not dollars he doesn't actually get billions of dollars. So has to then sell SOME of the shares so he can pays taxes on that. Then when he sells the shares to pay the taxes for exercising he actually owes even more money if they went up from when he exercised. So everytime he's selling low its actually good for him because it's less ADDITIONAL PROFIT that he would owe taxes on.\n\n If he wasn't selling its because he thought it would go down even further and then he would actually owe less taxes overall. So if he thought it was going to tank he'd wait and actually get a nice fat discount on his taxes. \n\nI know this seems really crazy but I promise that's how it works you can look it up in detail but yeah shocking that mainstream media and redditors/youtubers who barely do research and have no real understanding of how these billion dollar compensations work would get it wrong. Unbelievable I know. If he had actually sold the massive overall percentage of his shares that some people claim he did the company would be at like $3-6 dollars not low 20s. Retail got confused because of market pressured due to interest rate fears from inflation and sold low (like retail always does) to institutions.",

They got a lot of exciting and growth customers like Barstool (PENN), YouTube (Google), Twitch (AMZN), FanDuel (PDYPY), Roblox (RBLX), CoinBase (COIN), Visa (V), ApplePay (APPL), BetMGM (MGM), Spotify (SPOT), Microsoft/Xbox etc., and on top of that they got a huge digital wallet (#2 in market share) where you can trade/buy the fast-growing e-currencies which is growing in popularity. I truly believed this Paysafe is undervalued compared to its peers. You can read a very good Paysafe DD below on reddit and it gives a lot of insight of Paysafe valuation and bear cases:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/mysz54/reviewing\\_the\\_bear\\_case\\_on\\_paysafe\\_psfe/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/mysz54/reviewing_the_bear_case_on_paysafe_psfe/)\n\n(the link above is a really really good read with lots of info about Paysafe valuation in-depth and discussion of bear cases, so I\u2019m not going to repeat most of the good points the author mentioned in that sub.)\n\nMost of the time analysis use assumptions to make predictions on future growth. As an example, EV-related stocks (PLUG, BLNK, QS, LAZR, NKLA, BLDP, etc) get higher or ridiculous valuation based on assumption that gasoline cars will eventually be phased out. As you can see most if not all of these companies are unprofitable and some don\u2019t even have revenue, yet worth billions. While this assumption may be accurate, it is extremely hard to know when will growth begin to accelerate. Because of this predictive nature, it\u2019s really hard to know how long you will have to hold onto the stocks before they pop. When or if it will pop is anyone's guess. So while holding onto these stocks will likely result in wild price swings thus high risk / high rewards.\n\nBut what if you have the data before you showing the financial growth of your customers or partners? If your customers/partners' revenue grows, it\u2019s more likely than not they are using more of your products or services. Paysafe is one such company where you can actually look at their customers/partners' financial reports to predict where the company will go in the future and when growth will start. For this reason, Paysafe is more of a lower risk but still has high reward potential.\n\nPaysafe will be reporting earning for the very first time as a public company again on May 11. The good news is we already have their customers results in and here are some breakdown of their 1st QTR results showing huge growth:\n\n1. PENN (Reported May 7, 2021) - \u201cPenn National\u2019s income from operations rose to $216.5 million in the first quarter against ($560.6) million in the prior-year quarter. Adjusted EBITDAR jumped 77.2% from the year-ago quarter to $447 million. Moreover, adjusted EBITDAR margin expanded to 35.1% from 22.6% a year ago.\u201d ( source: [https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/1515673/penn-national-penn-q1-earnings-revenues-beat-estimates](https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/1515673/penn-national-penn-q1-earnings-revenues-beat-estimates) )\n2. DraftKing ( Reported May 7, 2021) - \u201cDraftKings is raising its fiscal year 2021 revenue guidance from a range of $900 million to $1 billion to a range of $1.05 billion to $1.15 billion, which equates to year-over-year growth of 63% to 79% and a 16% increase compared to the midpoint of our previous guidance\u201d Source: [https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/05/07/2225374/0/en/DraftKings-Reports-First-Quarter-2021-Results-and-Raises-2021-Revenue-Guidance.html](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/05/07/2225374/0/en/DraftKings-Reports-First-Quarter-2021-Results-and-Raises-2021-Revenue-Guidance.html) )\n\n3. Spotify (April 28th, 2021)- \u201cRevenue increased 16% to \u20ac2.15 billion ($2.6 billion) from \u20ac1.85 billion ($2.22 billion) in the same period last year\u2026.\u201d (source: [https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/streaming/9564180/spotify-q1-2021-earnings-report/](https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/streaming/9564180/spotify-q1-2021-earnings-report/))\n\n4. Youtube/Google ( April 27th, 2021 ) - \u201c In its first-quarter earnings report Tuesday, Google parent company [Alphabet](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/GOOGL) said YouTube [brought in](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/27/alphabet-goog-earnings-q1-2021.html) revenue of $6.01 billion in advertising revenue during the quarter \u2014 up from $4 billion from a year ago, for a growth rate of 49%. That\u2019s an acceleration over its 46% growth in Q4. It\u2019s also nearly twice the growth rate of Netflix, which reported 24% revenue growth [in Q1](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/20/netflix-nflx-q1-2021-earnings.html), and [expects](https://s22.q4cdn.com/959853165/files/doc_financials/2021/q1/FINAL-Q1-21-Shareholder-Letter.pdf) growth to slow to 19% next quarter.\u201d (source: [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/27/youtube-could-soon-equal-netflix-in-revenue.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/27/youtube-could-soon-equal-netflix-in-revenue.html) )\n\n5. Skillz ( May 4, 2021 ) - \u201cRevenue grew to $83.7 million during the first quarter of 2021, up 92% over the prior year. Gross profit grew to $79.4 million during the first quarter of 2021, up 95% over the prior year.\u201d (source: [https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210504006307/en/CORRECTING-and-REPLACING-Skillz-Reports-Record-Q1-Revenue-and-Raises-2021-Guidance](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210504006307/en/CORRECTING-and-REPLACING-Skillz-Reports-Record-Q1-Revenue-and-Raises-2021-Guidance) )\n\nAs you can see these Paysafe\u2019s customers/partners are reporting explosive growth. While some of these companies may report an earning loss it may be due to higher expenses such as customers acquisition cost (i.e. Draftking). However, here we are more focused on their revenue as the more transactions they do the more likely all or part of that transaction is done by Paysafe. These companies reported earnings before Paysafe, so it can be highly expected Paysafe will report a very good earning and future growth projection tomorrow ( May 11).\n\nSeveral things to note about Paysafe besides their customer\u2019s earning growth. These factors will also influence Paysafe\u2019s future growth:\n\n1. They are a monopoly when it comes to iGaming/Sport Betting as you can see the explosive growth by DKNG, MGM, PENN, SKLZ, etc.\n2. Paysafe took a hit during the pandemic because they also do offline transaction processing, but now things are opening up we can expect going forward these offline transactions will grow again. Also, when re-opening occur, more sport events will occur thus more betting means more transactions for Paysafe.\n3. They are #2 in digital wallets and you can buy digital \"stuff\" with the wallet. These currencies has been generating huge revenue for PayPal and SQ  on their 1st qtr report (more on this below)\n\nFinally, both PayPal and SQ reported earning before Paysafe and their results beat estimation:\n\nPaypal earning ( May 5, 2021) \u201c Revenue: $6.03 billion vs. $5.90 billion expected by Refinitiv\u201d (source: [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/05/paypal-pypl-earnings-q1-2021.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/05/paypal-pypl-earnings-q1-2021.html) )\n\nSquare earning ( May 6, 2021 ) \u201cSquare reported a profit of 41 cents per share vs. 16 cents per share expected in a Refinitiv survey of analysts. It also brought in $5.06 billion of revenue vs. $3.36 billion expected by Refinitiv.\u201d ( source: [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/06/square-sq-earnings-q1-2021.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/06/square-sq-earnings-q1-2021.html))\n\nSo I can say with confidence Paysafe will likely beat their own guidance for Q1 on May 11th. For those of you who don\u2019t know Paysafe, they are not a small player. Their transaction volume is about that of SQ \\~$100 Billion. I get it, people will say look man their CAGR is way too small compare to PayPal or SQ. I'm not looking at the past. I'm looking at the future. Their CAGR estimate did not include the sportbetting/igaming growth. Remember that Sportbetting was banned in the USA but has been overturned by the SCOTUS recently. Right now less than 1/2 the population can bet online, and the 4 largest states haven't yet legalized online gaming. This is why I post the results from their customers like DKNG and PENN which is showing high growth rate. And best of all? They own this space in online gambling as they are a monopoly. So we'll see what their new CAGR will be going forward once they reported earning tomorrow (May 11). If Paysafe is able to show growth on par with PayPal and SQ they should be trading at a much higher multiple. See the reddit link above for DD on valuation.\n\nPaysafe involved with Gaming, Sports, e-wallet/currencies which I find very exciting and feel that if I own the stock I\u2019ll be part of the journey of growth with these sectors. Roaring Kitty/ DeepFuckingValue simply invested in GME because he liked the stock. I\u2019m investing in Paysafe simply because it's cool and sexy, regardless of its growth potential.\n\nPaysafe I believed is a lower risk and high reward stock, since their growth is easier to predict as we can rely on their publicly traded customers data which is showing high growth going forward. They got the 2nd largest digital wallet. I believe as a monopoly in iGaming/Sport Betting their growth will be massive when 20+ states including the 4 largest states: CA, TX, NY, FL begin to allow online sport betting. This is something about Paysafe that I like so much because no other fintech has this space. This is a massive high growth (as seen with DKNG, PENN, MGM 1st qtr report) area and they owns it. For these reason, I am extremely bullish and I like Paysafe for both short and longer term play.\n\nDisclaimer: I own Paysafe commons, warrants, and option calls. I am not a financial adviser.

        "selftext": "Hey Reddit I usually lurk around here looking at discussions of certain stocks I'm thinking of investing it but I am in a special circumstance. I'm turning 18 in a month or so and am getting about 2500$ from a trustfund I also have around 1300$ in hand. I will be taking part in the army for 2.5 years so I thought I should invest the money so it can grow and pull it out at 25 or so so I have a good financial base to start with. I've been studying ETFs and individual stocks but have been hearing about a market crash from a lot of sources recently and also I've been looking at crypto since it's booming rn and isn't connected directly to the stock market. I understand that long term investments mean that you shouldn't be too worried about market dips.\n \nsince Im probably going to be in for around 7 years I'm afraid the crash will affect me more since I don't have too much time to let the market recover but at the same time Might be waiting too long for a crash that wouldn't happen and miss the bull run gains. Is now a good time to get in? Should I wait for the crash and buy low or take the risk and get in now? I'm relatively new to the stock scene but have been studying the market for a few months, what do you think is the best option for me to invest in right now? (I am also contemplating between buying a few picked diverse stocks, a good ETF and dividend Vs growth).\n\nHere are some stocks I've been looking at if anyone's interested in giving me some advice about my picks:\ns&amp;p 500, $BOMN, Realty Income Corp,\nInnovative Industrial Properties Inc, hitif, nio, alphabet, Microsoft, apple, marvel, Sony, Nvidia, Samsung, visa, tesla, Berkshire Hathaway, Decker's outdoor, Facebook, lupa gold, teva, PayPal.",

        "selftext": "New York (CNN)Twenty-six seconds into his \"Saturday Night Live\" monologue last weekend, Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla and second richest person in the world, opened up about having Asperger syndrome.\n\nIt was a bold move, even for someone known for pushing boundaries in business and in life. The serial entrepreneur and founder of Tesla, (TSLA TESLA) SpaceX and the Boring Co. sold his first company to Compaq for $307 million when he was 28 years old, then went on to help create the precursor to what would become PayPal (PYPL) \u2014 before getting ousted by his co-founders. (He held onto his stock until its 2002 IPO, and the company was acquired by eBay (EBAY) later that year.)\nMusk's candid disclosure on SNL has opened up a larger conversation about business leadership and the autism spectrum.\n\nCristina M. Giannantonio and Amy E. Hurley-Hanson, scholars and editors of Chapman University's Journal of Business and Management special issue titled, \"Autism in the Workplace,\" said Musk's revelation may change how people deal with autism at work while helping change perceptions about people with autism and the types of jobs they aspire to pursue.\nMental health remains stigmatized, especially in business\nIn 2013, the American Psychiatric Association consolidated four separate categories of autism diagnoses \u2014 including Asperger syndrome \u2014 into the single umbrella diagnosis of \"Autism Spectrum Disorder.\" And although some celebrities \u2014 including former SNL cast member Dan Aykroyd, filmmaker Tim Burton and singer Susan Boyle \u2014 have opened up about being on the spectrum, few business leaders have made similar public disclosures.\n\nThe diagnoses are characterized by varying degrees of impairment in language and communication skills, according to the National Institutes of Health, as well as repetitive or restrictive patterns of thought and behavior. According to the NIH, it is considered a \"developmental disorder\" because symptoms like avoiding eye contact or a delay in speech development tend to appear by the age of two.\n\nWhen it comes to work, employees with Asperger syndrome are often given fewer hours of work than they would like, according to \"Autism in the Workplace.\" The journal also points to a study that found that adults with Asperger syndrome were more likely to work part-time, compared to the general population.\n\"We all reveal a spectrum of behaviors and neurological learning styles. Recognizing and embracing this neurodiversity helps build strong, inventive, and supportive teams,\" business psychologist Melanie Katzman told CNN Business. \"Rather than viewing autism, dyslexia, ADHD, OCD and others as pathologies, the focus needs to be on how to view these predispositions as super powers,\" she said.\n\nThe intersection of autism and innovation\nSome think of autism as a challenging circumstance as those with ASD may struggle with social interactions. But for years, there has been talk about some of the most successful people in tech living and working with Asperger's and benefiting from it.\n\"In Silicon Valley, I've pointed out that many of the more successful entrepreneurs seem to be suffering from a mild form of Asperger's,\" tech investor Peter Thiel said in a 2015 interview with economist Tyler Cowen. \"It happens to be a plus for innovation and creating great companies,\" he added.\n\nEmbracing thought diversity\nIn his SNL monologue, Musk nodded to a common communication behavior for people who have Asperger syndrome, saying, \"I won't make a lot of eye contact with the cast tonight.\" Such factors are important to take into consideration in the workplace.\nKatzman emphasized the importance of creating work conditions where people can safely share that kind of personal information and assume individual responsibility. By mentioning eye contact, Musk \"took the pressure off of himself and reduced the chance that he would be ridiculed as the evening progressed,\" she said.\n\nReducing stigma and allowing people to talk about their differences allows more diversity of thought and different approaches in the labor market, said licensed therapist and Chapman University Assistant Professor Amy Jane Griffiths. \"I would say mental health and disability are still very much stigmatized in business,\" she added.\nBut Griffiths pointed out that Asperger syndrome shouldn't always be lumped in with the term \"mental health\" since it is generally considered a neuro-developmental disorder. \"Perhaps the focus can shift from 'what is wrong' with individuals with ASD and how can 'we fix it' to what gifts do they offer and how can we accommodate their unique approaches into our neurotypical environments,\" Griffiths said.\n\nAnalysis by Alexis Benveniste, CNN Business\nUpdated 1613 GMT (0013 HKT) May 12, 2",

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, May 6, 2021**\n\nRemarkably, despite many individual companies pulling back steeply today, the three major indexes finished the day positive, driven by gains in financial stocks and stability in mega-caps. Growth stocks and more speculative plays have been hit hard by a combination of inflationary fears and recent suggestions by monetary officials that the interest rate should be raised. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) closed the day 0.81%, less than 1% below it\u2019s record high. The Dow Jones (DIA) recorded a new intraday record while the Nasdaq (QQQ) closed 0.76%. Market participants continue to monitor commentary from monetary officials, ongoing earnings season, and new economic data, particularly the April Jobs Report set for release tomorrow morning.\n\nAfter reclaiming the leadership in April as the best performing sector in the SPY, so far in May we have seen investors rotate out of big tech stocks and into financial stocks, with many big banks pushing all-time highs today. Market participants are worried that a suggested raise in interest would affect the already stretched valuation of some companies. Given the rally the market saw in April, some analysts are worried that positive catalysts for equities are getting harder to achieve and may be running out. The economy in the US is recovering faster than initially predicted by analysts, with this earnings season seeing 86% of companies in the S&amp;P 500 that have reported earnings  beat estimates, according to data from FactSet. \n\nTreasury Secretary Janet Yellen suggested that interest rates may need to rise in the near-term to prevent the economy from overheating, with the recent economic data and corporate earnings showing economic activity recovering much faster than expected as effective distribution of the vaccine in the US allows states to gradually reopen. Yellen said, \u201cIt may be that interest rates will have to rise somewhat to make sure that our economy doesn't overheat, even though the additional spending is relatively small relative to the size of the economy. It could cause some very modest increases in interest rates to get that reallocation, but these are investments our economy needs to be competitive and to be productive. I think our economy will grow faster because of them.\" In later remarks, she added that raising rates was not something she was predicting or recommending and that the decision ultimately rests with the Federal Reserve. She said, \u201cLet me be clear, that\u2019s not something I\u2019m predicting or recommending. If anybody appreciates the independence of the Fed, I think that person is me.\u201d\n\nThe Labor Department will release its April jobs report on Friday, which is expected to show a staggering nearly 1 million payrolls came back last month, accelerating March\u2019s gain. As a reminder, in March, the Department of Labor reported nonfarm payrolls increased by 916,000 for the month while the unemployment rate fell to 6% (unemployment rate was 14.6% in April 2020). Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been looking for an increase of 675,000 and an unemployment rate of 6%.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Weekly unemployment claims fell to 498,000 last week\u2014a new low since the Covid-19 pandemic began more than a year ago. The four-week average of initial claims is also at the lowest point since the pandemic began. Read more [here](https://www.wsj.com/articles/weekly-jobless-claims-coronavirus-05-06-2021-11620247798).\n* The Bank of England upped their growth estimates for the economy of the UK, anticipating GDP will grow 7.25% in the country, up from its forecast for 5% growth in February. The BOE also now sees inflation averaging 2.5% in 2021, up from its prior forecast for 2%, but said the rise in price pressures will likely be \"temporary.\" \n* NIO announced the company will expand into Norway, with the group\u2019s first service and delivery center set to open in the capital Oslo in September.\n* A lot of stocks pulled back despite posting better than expected earnings. The market is very narrow right now, with gains concentrated in the financials, energy, and mega-caps.\n* IBM introduced what it says is the world's first 2-nanometer chip making technology. The technology could be as much as 45% faster than the mainstream 7-nanometer chips in many of today's laptops and phones and up to 75% more power efficient, the company said.

        "selftext": "Goooooood Sunday morning to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning May 3rd, 2021.\n\n# **More earnings, April\u2019s big jobs report and inflation worries could swing markets in the week ahead - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/30/more-earnings-aprils-big-jobs-report-and-inflation-worries-could-swing-markets-in-the-week-ahead.html)**\n*****\n&gt; April\u2019s jobs report and a barrage of earnings news make for another busy week for markets, as the calendar rolls into May.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks notched solid gains in April, as REITs, consumer discretionary names and communications services companies outpaced the broader market, all more than 7% higher. However, April finished on a sour note, with stocks selling off on Friday.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cSince November, there\u2019s been a 30% rally,\u201d said Jimmy Chang, chief investment officer at Rockefeller Global Family Office. He noted that historically the November to April period is historically the strongest for stocks. \u201cThere\u2019s the adage \u2018sell in May, go away.\u2019 It may be somewhat appropriate this year since we\u2019ve done so well in the last six months.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # Big jobs report\n&gt; April\u2019s employment report is released Friday, and the market is expecting a big number.\n*****\n&gt; Economists say payrolls in April could easily reach 1 million, after 916,000 jobs were added in March. Estimates range from about 700,000 to a forecast of 2.1 million from Jefferies economists.\n*****\n&gt; According to Dow Jones, there is a consensus forecast of 978,000 among the economists it surveyed and the unemployment rate is expected to fall to 5.8% form 6%.\n*****\n&gt; Fed speakers will also be important after Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said in the past week that the Fed is still looking for \u201csubstantial further progress\u201d in its goals for the economy.\n*****\n&gt; The chairman emphasized that the Fed is not close to tapering back its bond buying program, a surprise to some investors. Some bond market pros had expected the Fed to start discussing cutting back purchases at its June meeting and begin to reduce its $120 billion monthly bond buying by the end of the year or early next year.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cNext week is all about the jobs number, because as part of the Fed\u2019s path to \u2018substantial progress\u2019 on their two roles, we\u2019ll see how much further along that path they are next Friday\u201d said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group. The Fed\u2019s mandate is to pursue full employment and a steady pace of Inflation, which it has targeted at 2%.\n*****\n&gt; The Fed has expected a temporary period of high inflation which it expects to see subside later in the year though Boockvar and others say inflation could be hotter than the Fed expects. The core personal consumption expenditures price index jumped 0.36% in March, with the year-ago rate rising from 1.4% to 1.8%. It is expected to go even higher in April. Headline inflation in the consumer price index is expected to begin running at 3% or better when it is reported May 12.\n*****\n&gt; Just days after Powell\u2019s comments on tapering, Dallas Fed President Rob Kaplan Friday said the Fed should begin the discussion on paring back bond purchases because imbalances in financial markets and the economy is improving faster than expected.\n*****\n&gt; The market\u2019s focus on the Fed\u2019s bond program makes the jobs report even more important. If the Fed starts to taper back those asset purchases, it would then signal it would be on the path toward raising interest rates. Most economists do not expect the Fed to raise interest rates before 2023.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIf this jobs number comes in super hot, it\u2019s going to make people up their estimate on when the Fed might taper,\u201d said Michael Schumacher, director rates at Wells Fargo.\n*****\n&gt; Powell is among Fed speakers in the coming week, but he is not expected to provide any new views when he participates in a National Community Reinvestment Coalition conference Monday afternoon. Kaplan speaks Tuesday and Thursday, and New York Fed President John Williams and Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester are also among Fed officials speaking in the coming week.\n*****\n&gt; # Earnings soar\n&gt; So far, a record 87% of S&amp;P 500 companies have beat earnings estimates, and earnings look to be growing by more than 46%, according to Refinitiv.\n*****\n&gt; Credit Suisse Chief U.S. Equity Strategist Jonathan Golub upped his forecast Friday for the S&amp;P 500 based on strong earnings. \u201cWe are raising our 2021 S&amp;P 500 price target to 4600 from 4300, representing 9.2% upside from current levels, and 22.5% for the year,\u201d he wrote.\n*****\n&gt; Earnings are expected from a diverse group of companies, from General Motors to ViacomCBS. Pharma will be in the spotlight as vaccine makers Pfizer and Moderna both report. Draftkings and Beyond Meat are also on the schedule.\n*****\n&gt; A host of travel related companies issue results, including Booking Holdings, Hilton Worldwide , Marriott Vacations, and Caesars Entertainment. Consumer brands, like Anheuser Busch Inbev and Estee Lauder also report, as do insurers including AIG, Allstate, and MetLife. (A calendar with some key earnings dates appears below.)\n*****\n&gt; Chang said the market has discounted a lot of the positive news already.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIn spite of the really strong reports from the bellwether companies, you\u2019re seeing some of the names starting to peter out a little bit,\u201d said Chang. \u201cI think it\u2019s a sign that so much good news is discounted. I suspect the market is due for a breather. I think in the next couple of months, we\u2019re likely to see sideways movement. There\u2019s likely to be a pullback which will be healthy.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 was up 5.2% in April, finishing Friday at 4,181. It is now up 11.2% for the year so far. The Dow rose 2.7% in April, to 33,874, and the Nasdaq gained 5.4% in April, ending Friday at 13,962.\n*****\n&gt; Chang said he expects some of the \u201cboring\u201d blue chips that haven\u2019t participated as much in the rally to do better. Some of those names can be found in pharma, he said.\n*****\n&gt; Heading into the coming week, investors will be watching for words of wisdom from Warren Buffett at Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s annual meeting Saturday.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/9wZQvOO.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE S&amp;P SECTORS FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/kGnKjBS.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/xazpmUE.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/ceFPlXO.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/N8zkbCl.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/EXJdhi8.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/a3EftWo.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/OA6dm0N.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/0UOEq2t.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/69XfINF.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/hdAqJr1.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/IEzICwV.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/9nsqXUH.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # S&amp;P 500 and DJIA Up Last 9 Post-Election Year Mays\n\n&gt; May officially marks the beginning of the \u201cWorst Six Months\u201d for the DJIA and S&amp;P. To wit: \u201cSell in May and go away.\u201d Our \u201cBest Six Months Switching Strategy,\u201d created in 1986, proves that there is merit to this old trader\u2019s tale. A hypothetical $10,000 investment in the DJIA compounded to a gain of $960,943 for November-April in 70 years compared to just $1,656 for May-October. The same hypothetical $10,000 investment in the S&amp;P 500 compounded to $788,997 for November-April in 70 years compared to a gain of just $10,145 for May-October.\n\n&gt; May has been a tricky month over the years, a well-deserved reputation following the May 6, 2010 \u201cflash crash\u201d. It used to be part of what we once called the \u201cMay/June disaster area.\u201d From 1965 to 1984 the S&amp;P 500 was down during May fifteen out of twenty times. Then from 1985 through 1997 May was the best month, gaining ground every single year (13 straight gains) on the S&amp;P, up 3.3% on average with the DJIA falling once and two NASDAQ losses.\n\n&gt; In the years since 1997, May\u2019s performance has been erratic; DJIA up twelve times in the past twenty-three years (four of the years had gains in excess of 4%). NASDAQ suffered five May losses in a row from 1998-2001, down \u2013 11.9% in 2000, followed by thirteen sizable gains in excess of 2.5% and five losses, the worst of which was 8.3% in 2010.\n\n&gt; Post-election Year Mays rank near the top, registering average gains on DJIA and S&amp;P 500 of 1.3% and 1.7% respectively. DJIA and S&amp;P 500 have advanced in every post-election year May beginning in 1985. Russell 1000 has been up ten years straight in post-election year Mays.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/4c1485a3ca7e34234ba1f7666450bc23/abec686095f47da5-c9/s400x600/90a50e5d1712125c12d3f5af1efad8228681daa0.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # S&amp;P 500 Up Over 10% First Four Months \u2013 Preceded Flat May to late-October\n\n&gt; As of yesterday\u2019s close, S&amp;P 500 was up 11.5% year-to-date. Provided these gains hold through the end of April, this year will be just the seventeenth time since 1950 that the S&amp;P 500 has finished the first four months of the year with a gain exceeding 10%. The best January to April span occurred in 1975, up 27.3% (S&amp;P 500 was in the early stages of a new bull market following the bear ending 10/3/1974 in which the S&amp;P 500 declined 48.2%). The next best year was, 1987 (most will remember what happened later that year) and the most recent year was 2019 (a solid year from beginning to end).\n\n&gt; In the above chart we have plotted all 17 previous years in which the S&amp;P 500 was up over 10% January through the end of April. Along side for comparison is \u201cAll Years,\u201d \u201cPost-Election Years,\u201d and 2021 through yesterday. In the previous 17 years, gains tended to fizzle in early-May before gaining some additional ground from around mid-June to mid-July before once again stalling out till late September with more weakness lasting until late-October. On average, by late-October arrived, gains from the previous three months were given back and since the start of May S&amp;P 500 gained around 2.5% on average. You don\u2019t have to go away in May but considering the historically modest gains from early-May to late-October, it may not quite be worth sticking around.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/ad49ec327ff1b942a31c993f0a0a82fe/79778de7b3df0abd-1c/s500x750/865ae39798a9e1d8450988b067a15e5a90a7c5bc.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Here Comes Sell In May\n\n&gt; \u201cThe sun was warm but the wind was chill. You know how it is with an April day. When the sun is out and the wind is still, you\u2019re one month on in the middle of May.\u201d American Poet Robert Frost\n\n&gt; One of the best known investment axioms is to \u201csell in May and go away.\u201d This is largely because the six months from May through October have historically been some of the weakest months of the year for stocks. As you can see below, the next six months have tended to be on the weak side.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/blog-4.30.21.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the next six months have indeed been the worst six months of the year, up only 1.7% on average. To add insult to injury, we are leaving the six most bullish months of the year. In fact, the S&amp;P 500 Index is set to gain close to 30% during these most bullish six months, one of the best six-month gains ever.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/blog-4.30.21-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; \u201cStocks are up more than 87% from the March lows, suggesting a well-deserved pullback during these troublesome months is quite possible,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cBut with an accommodative Fed, fiscal and monetary policy, along with an economy that is opening faster than nearly anyone expected, we\u2019d use any weakness as an opportunity to add to positions.\u201d\n\n&gt; Here\u2019s the catch, isn\u2019t there always a catch? Stocks have actually been higher during these worst months of the year eight of the past ten years.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Blog-4.30.21-3.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # U.S. Economy Jumps Out of the Gate in 2021\n\n&gt; In what was initially expected to be one of the slower quarters of the year, the U.S. economy jumped out of the gates in 2021, with gross domestic product (GDP) growing 6.4% quarter over quarter. A faster than expected vaccination program, nearly $3 trillion in fiscal stimulus\u2014including direct payments to consumers\u2014and faster than expected job growth helped fuel a surge in personal consumption\u2014the largest portion of GDP.\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, personal consumption grew 10.7% on an annualized basis in the first quarter, the second highest level since the 1960\u2019s:\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/4.29.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; \u201cThe U.S. economy is off to a great start in 2021, and this should set the stage for solid growth in the remainder of the year as pent up demand continues to flow through the economy,\u201d added LPL Financial Chief Investment Officer Burt White. \u201cMany areas of the country are still facing restrictions on activity, so we don\u2019t think growth will just be limited to the first quarter.\u201d\n\n&gt; However, the growth story in the first quarter wasn\u2019t solely about direct stimulus payments. While personal consumption has understandably gained a lot of attention, federal non-defense spending added the most to GDP in nearly 60 years, a segment of the economy unaffected by transfer payments like stimulus checks.\n\n&gt; Digging into the numbers even further, spending on services grew a modest 4.6%, which should accelerate in the second and third quarters as remaining restrictions are lifted in response to falling cases and rising vaccinations. As of April 28, the US is averaging around 2.5-3 million vaccines administered per day, which has helped over half the adult population receive at least one dose of the vaccine, while nearly 40% of adults are fully vaccinated, according to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n&gt; The U.S. vaccination program has helped pull the economy forward, but net trade was a modest drag on growth in the first quarter, where domestic growth pulled in imports at a faster pace than the recovery outside of the U.S. lifted exports. As the rest of the world gets better control of COVID-19, rebounding economic growth overseas should provide an additional tailwind for U.S. economy.\n\n&gt; We upgraded our forecast for U.S. GDP in our recent Weekly Market Commentary from 5\u20135.5% to 6.25\u20136.75%, and we expect to see the economy continue its pace in the second quarter as restrictions are lifted and activity normalizes.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Where Do President Biden\u2019s First 100 Days Stack Up Versus President Trump?\n\n&gt; President Biden\u2019s 100th day in office is tomorrow, on April 29. Hard to believe it has been 100 days already, but overall the economy continues to improve and stocks have done very well under our new President.\n\n&gt; We\u2019ve heard the question many times: Where does the Biden rally rank? That is what we will look at today. The term \u201chundred days\u201d was first used on July 24, 1933, on the radio by President Franklin D. Roosevelt (FDR). He was discussing the 100-day session of the 73rd U.S. Congress, but over time this term has changed to refer to the first 100 days of a new president.\n\n&gt; Per Ryan Detrick, Chief Market Strategist, \u201cPresident Biden has been quite kind for stocks, with the Dow up nearly 10%, which is on pace for the best first 100 days in office since FDR in the early 1930s. Then toss in the cherry on top that stocks had one of their greatest rallies ever from Election Day until the inauguration and it is clear that although maybe everyone might not like President Biden, but the stock market doesn\u2019t have many issues with him.\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the Dow has averaged 4.3% the first 100 days of a new President, while it has been higher the first 100 days in office for five of the past six Presidents. In fact, President Biden\u2019s return currently ranks as the third best since 1900, with only Taft and Roosevelt better. Lastly, breaking it down by political party and the first 100 days under a Democratic President was much stronger, up 10.3% on average versus down 0.2% for a Republican President.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/4.28-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Here\u2019s a chart we shared earlier this year that shows that stocks did amazingly well from Election Day until the inauguration under President Biden.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/4.28-Blog-CHart-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; What can we glean from those first 100 days? Is there any pattern that might suggest how stocks will do during the rest of the time President Biden is in office? You can look for yourself below, but there doesn\u2019t appear to be any clue as to what might happen. President Eisenhower had a weak first 100 days, then a big rally over the remainder of his time in office. Conversely, President Taft saw a big rally during the first 100 days, only to have negative returns for the remainder of his time in office. In the end, fundamentals, valuations, and technicals drive long-term equity returns. The good news is only once since the Great Depression did that mean lower returns for the remainder of time in office after the first 100 days.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/4.28.-Blog-Chart-3.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Wild Data Close To Q1\n\n&gt; Today was quite the day for economic data, with two key releases from the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) and Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). We'll start with BEA data on personal income and spending in March.\n\n&gt; First, as shown below, the savings rate surged in the month, with households saving 27.6% of personal income net of taxes. That's a huge number, even by the standards of the elevated savings rates that we've seen over the course of the pandemic.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/04/Eco-Review-1.png))**\n\n&gt; The reason there was so much saving going on is that transfer payments rose by more than $300bn on the month, driven by the delivery of economic impact payments also known as \"stimulus checks\" or even shorter: \"stimmies.\"\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/04/Eco-Review-2.png))**\n\n&gt; Incomes also rose thanks to rebounding labor market activity following winter storms in Texas during February and the longer-term trend of reopening across the economy. As shown, the 13.5% annualized growth of wage and salary income in the month was very strong. It was also helped along by wage growth, which we will discuss later on.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/04/Eco-Review-3.png))**\n\n&gt; With spending surging thanks to stimulus checks and other factors, core personal consumption expenditure prices surged by the most MoM since 2009, over 4% annualized. The 4% move was in no small part due to the swing in activity from February to March, and isn't likely to be sustained, but it is a helpful indicator that prices may be more robust in this recovery than they were during the low inflation post-GFC period.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/04/Eco-Review-4.png))**\n\n&gt; For broad inflation that will concern the Fed, one factor that will be needed along with steadily rising prices is strong wage growth. The second big report today was Q1 wages in the BLS Employment Cost Index (ECI). The ECI does a better job of measuring wage growth than other series because it accounts for changes in the composition of employment over time. As shown in the chart below, Q3 saw the strongest sequential wage growth on record, with a 4.6% annualized advance in wages versus Q4. Some of that came from incentive-paid occupations, which benefit from bonuses and related payments, skewing the results. As shown in the chart, though, there was very strong wage growth even excluding incentive-paid occupations. Anecdotal reports of very tight labor markets amidst booming reopening demand got support from this release.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/04/Eco-Review-5.png))**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/69XfINF.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/q8ttO0Q.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MOST ANTICIPATED EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE MONDAY'S MARKET OPEN!](https://i.imgur.com/Cw16yIb.jpg))**\n\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp;

And then everything went south and I\u2019ve been trying to build back up since then. \n\nI\u2019ve been back at 30k four weeks ago but I made the dumbest mistake ever and bought into COIN options the day options started trading on COIN and it\u2019s just dropping since then and as of today was down 75%! \n\nAnother big mistake was buying puts on UPS when it hit $195 because I had sold call options on UPS with 160% gain at $190 and I wasn\u2019t forgiving myself for selling so I bought puts and almost lost everything there... down a lot on MSFT call options too. \n\nToday was first time ever my account hit a minus and I decided I gotta get back on my feet! Sold everything (except for DKNG call options) and threw it all into PYPL 9/17 $270 calls. Average analyst pt for PYPL is $310 and I bought at $247 so not so bad but I\u2019m petrified about earnings coming up tomorrow after hours! Did I make a smart decision?",

        "selftext": "New guy question here- I recently decided to join the terrifying world of stock investments. My wife and I are about to pop out our first child (2 week countdown!) so I figured it was time to start paying closer attention to how my money works for me besides just our 401k. So I did the only (?) logical thing and put $10k on a variety of safe stocks. Microsoft, Amazon, Google, FB, Target, Walmart, Cisco, TMS, PayPal, Square, Applied Materials, Crowdstrike. Yes clearly I work in IT. Companies that are established and would generally be considered, at least from a company success perspective, low risk. And then I proceeded to lose a few hundred bucks in my very first day yesterday. Now I get that stocks are a long term investment. I\u2019m not trying to make a quick buck, day trade or participate in options speculation. I also am aware of the rule don\u2019t bet what you can\u2019t afford to lose. I can zero all of it without an issue\u2026this is a starting point for me. Nonetheless, the results last week left me feeling a little depressed and kind of wanting to take my ball and go home. Can anyone please point towards some good resources to learn more about how to be smart about this? I\u2019ve been lurking here for a long time but it\u2019s hard to tell sound advice from more meme-based advise. To give you an idea how much I don\u2019t know, I almost bought a Motley Fool subscription before reading comments on here about their service. Help my baby please! She wants to go to a good school. \n\nThank you in advance!!",

        "selftext": "Hey  guys, I have been watching this Canadian Telehealth company WELL Health  Technologies over the last few months and wanted to get some opinions  from the rest of you. I first became aware of them when I saw Mr. Li  Ka-Shing (the 29th richest man) invest $105M of a $305M round priced at a  25% premium to market. Since then I have seen 2 short reports come out  against the company and I can't seem to figure out why. Having watched  them do this raise, and complete the acquisition of CRH Medical and  today ExecHealth which will bring their revenue to $300M with $50M in  free cash flow with $0 debt and $80M left in the bank. I can't  understand why not one but two short reports against them have been  released\u2026\n\nSome reasons I am looking at them:\n\n* \\- Founded by a successful Entrepreneur who sold his previous company to PayPal for $304M\n* \\- Seed investor is the 29th richest man in the world and he has invested in every round since\n* \\-  Completed a $305M raise priced 25% above the market at the time which  again was led by the 29th richest man with over $100m of his own money\n* \\- CRH acquisition means they will have close to or over $300M in revenue and over $50M in free cash flow\n* \\-  $0 debt $80m in cash?\n* \\- Truly proving themselves to be a leader in what will be a $289B Telehealth market.\n* \\- Undervalued compared to any of the US names I have\u00a0found\n\nWhat does everyone think of this name?",

        "selftext": "&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Paysafe Partners](https://preview.redd.it/dwwz4cuubby61.jpg?width=800&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e33fa2868ec0edb3f32c872f48f73869b03d7555)\n\n \n\nPaysafe is one hell of a company. They are a fin-tech like PayPal and Squares, thus should be given a higher multiple for valuation. They got a lot of exciting and growth customers like Barstool (PENN), YouTube (Google), Twitch (AMZN), FanDuel (PDYPY), Roblox (RBLX), CoinBase (COIN), Visa (V), ApplePay (APPL), BetMGM (MGM), Spotify (SPOT), Microsoft/Xbox etc., and on top of that they got a huge digital wallet (#2 in market share) where you can trade/buy the fast-growing e-currencies. I truly believed this Paysafe is undervalued compared to its peers. You can read a very good Paysafe DD below on reddit and it gives a lot of insight of Paysafe valuation and bear cases:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/mysz54/reviewing\\_the\\_bear\\_case\\_on\\_paysafe\\_psfe/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/mysz54/reviewing_the_bear_case_on_paysafe_psfe/)\n\n(the link above is a really really good read with lots of info about Paysafe including but not limited to its valuation and bear cases, so I\u2019m not going to repeat most of the good points the author mentioned in that sub.)\n\nMost of the time analysis use assumptions to make predictions on future growth. As an example, EV-related stocks (PLUG, BLNK, QS, LAZR, NKLA, BLDP, etc) get higher or ridiculous valuation based on assumption that gasoline cars will eventually be phased out. As you can see most if not all of these companies are unprofitable and some don\u2019t even have revenue, yet worth billions. While this assumption may be accurate, it is extremely hard to know when will growth begin to accelerate. Because of this predictive nature, it\u2019s really hard to know how long you will have to hold onto the stocks before they pop. When or if it will pop is anyone's guess. So while holding onto these stocks will likely result in wild price swings thus high risk / high rewards.\n\nBut what if you have the data before you showing the financial growth of your customers or partners? If your customers/partners' revenue grows, it\u2019s more likely than not they are using more of your products or services. Paysafe is one such company where you can actually look at their customers/partners' financial reports to predict where the company will go in the future and when growth will start. For this reason, Paysafe is more of a lower risk but still has high reward potential.\n\nPaysafe will be reporting earning for the very first time as a public company again on May 11. The good news is we already have their customers results in and here are some breakdown of their 1st QTR results showing huge growth:\n\n1. PENN (Reported May 7, 2021) - \u201cPenn National\u2019s income from operations rose to $216.5 million in the first quarter against ($560.6) million in the prior-year quarter. Adjusted EBITDAR jumped 77.2% from the year-ago quarter to $447 million. Moreover, adjusted EBITDAR margin expanded to 35.1% from 22.6% a year ago.\u201d ( source: [https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/1515673/penn-national-penn-q1-earnings-revenues-beat-estimates](https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/1515673/penn-national-penn-q1-earnings-revenues-beat-estimates) )\n2. DraftKing ( Reported May 7, 2021) - \u201cDraftKings is raising its fiscal year 2021 revenue guidance from a range of $900 million to $1 billion to a range of $1.05 billion to $1.15 billion, which equates to year-over-year growth of 63% to 79% and a 16% increase compared to the midpoint of our previous guidance\u201d\n\n(Source: [https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/05/07/2225374/0/en/DraftKings-Reports-First-Quarter-2021-Results-and-Raises-2021-Revenue-Guidance.html](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/05/07/2225374/0/en/DraftKings-Reports-First-Quarter-2021-Results-and-Raises-2021-Revenue-Guidance.html) )\n\n3. Spotify (April 28th, 2021)- \u201cRevenue increased 16% to \u20ac2.15 billion ($2.6 billion) from \u20ac1.85 billion ($2.22 billion) in the same period last year\u2026.\u201d (source: [https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/streaming/9564180/spotify-q1-2021-earnings-report/](https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/streaming/9564180/spotify-q1-2021-earnings-report/))\n\n4. Youtube/Google ( April 27th, 2021 ) - \u201c In its first-quarter earnings report Tuesday, Google parent company [Alphabet](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/GOOGL) said YouTube [brought in](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/27/alphabet-goog-earnings-q1-2021.html) revenue of $6.01 billion in advertising revenue during the quarter \u2014 up from $4 billion from a year ago, for a growth rate of 49%. That\u2019s an acceleration over its 46% growth in Q4. It\u2019s also nearly twice the growth rate of Netflix, which reported 24% revenue growth [in Q1](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/20/netflix-nflx-q1-2021-earnings.html), and [expects](https://s22.q4cdn.com/959853165/files/doc_financials/2021/q1/FINAL-Q1-21-Shareholder-Letter.pdf) growth to slow to 19% next quarter.\u201d (source: [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/27/youtube-could-soon-equal-netflix-in-revenue.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/27/youtube-could-soon-equal-netflix-in-revenue.html) )\n\n5. Skillz ( May 4, 2021 ) - \u201cRevenue grew to $83.7 million during the first quarter of 2021, up 92% over the prior year. Gross profit grew to $79.4 million during the first quarter of 2021, up 95% over the prior year.\u201d (source: [https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210504006307/en/CORRECTING-and-REPLACING-Skillz-Reports-Record-Q1-Revenue-and-Raises-2021-Guidance](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210504006307/en/CORRECTING-and-REPLACING-Skillz-Reports-Record-Q1-Revenue-and-Raises-2021-Guidance) )\n\nAs you can see these Paysafe\u2019s customers/partners are reporting explosive growth. While some of these companies may report an earning loss it may be due to higher expenses such as customers acquisition cost (i.e. Draftking). However, here we are more focused on their revenue as the more transactions they do the more likely all or part of that transaction is done by Paysafe. These companies reported earnings before Paysafe, so it can be highly expected Paysafe will report a very good earning and future growth projection tomorrow ( May 11).\n\nSeveral things to note about Paysafe besides their customer\u2019s earning growth. These factors will also influence Paysafe\u2019s future growth:\n\n1. They are a monopoly when it comes to iGaming/Sport Betting as you can see the explosive growth by DKNG, MGM, PENN, SKLZ, etc.\n2. Paysafe took a hit during the pandemic because they also do offline transaction processing, but now things are opening up we can expect going forward these offline transactions will grow again. Also, when re-opening occur, more sport events will occur thus more betting means more transactions for Paysafe.\n3. They are #2 in digital wallets and you can buy digitalcurrency with the wallet. These currencies has been generating huge revenue for PayPal and SQ (more on this below)\n\nFinally, both PayPal and SQ reported earning before Paysafe and their results beat estimation:\n\nPaypal earning ( May 5, 2021) \u201c Revenue: $6.03 billion vs. $5.90 billion expected by Refinitiv\u201d (source: [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/05/paypal-pypl-earnings-q1-2021.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/05/paypal-pypl-earnings-q1-2021.html) )\n\nSquare earning ( May 6, 2021 ) \u201cSquare reported a profit of 41 cents per share vs. 16 cents per share expected in a Refinitiv survey of analysts. It also brought in $5.06 billion of revenue vs. $3.36 billion expected by Refinitiv.\u201d ( source: [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/06/square-sq-earnings-q1-2021.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/06/square-sq-earnings-q1-2021.html))\n\nSo I can say with confidence Paysafe will likely beat their own guidance for Q1 on May 11th. For those of you who don\u2019t know Paysafe, they are not a small player. Their transaction volume is about that of SQ \\~$100 Billion. If Paysafe is able to show growth on par with PayPal and SQ they should be trading at a much higher multiple. See the reddit link above for DD on valuation.\n\nPaysafe involved with Gaming, Sports, digitalcurrency which I find very exciting and feel that if I own the stock I\u2019ll be part of the journey of growth with these sectors. Roaring Kitty/ DeepFuckingValue simply invested in GME because he liked the stock. I\u2019m investing in Paysafe simply because it's cool and sexy, regardless of its growth potential.\n\nIn summary, I think Paysafe is a low risk / high reward stock compare to other fintech. Their growth is easier to predict as we can rely on their publicly traded customers data which is showing high growth going forward. They got the 2nd largest digital wallet. They are involved in the highly popular and fast growth digital currency market. I believe as a monopoly in iGaming/Sport Betting their growth will be massive when the 4 largest states: CA, TX, NY, FL begin to allow online sport betting. This is something about Paysafe that I like so much because no other fintech has this space. This is a massive high growth area and they own it. For these reasons, I am extremely bullish and I like Paysafe for both short and longer term play.\n\nDisclaimer: I own Paysafe commons, warrants, and option calls. I am not a financial adviser.

        "selftext": "DigiCrypts Blockchain Solutions Inc. \n\n(CNSX:DIGI) (OTCMKTS:DBKSF)\u2014operating as DigiMax Global Solutions\u2014made a strategic investment that has the potential of becoming a transformative transaction. The company announced it had made a US$5 million investment in Kirobo, with option for another $5million stock for a total of 30% ownership in the leading digital currency custody of blockchain solutions developer. Digimax Global CEO Chris Carl rejoins the interview chair to give us his perspective on the significance of the deal.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/DDFSwh3_00Y\n\nAs many who\u2019ve conducted decentralized currency transactions already know, the process is unsettling due to the finality of such transfers. Once digital currency is purposely sent from one encrypted wallet to another, the transaction cannot be reversed unless the recipient of funds elects to return to sender. If you don\u2019t know whom the address belongs to, there is no remedy whatsoever. This is true even for the largest decentralized banks such as Coinbase, which is not able to recover any funds sent or received to an incorrect address.\n\nIn contrast, mainstream payment providers such as PayPal or most credit card providers have resolution protocols which can effectively rescind erroneous transactions. They can also stop payment and reverse transactions in cases where payors can prove erroneous transactions were enacted.\n\nEnter Kirobo.io, which has some of the most advanced commercial-ready custody of blockchain solutions available. As DigiMax Global Solutions CEO Chris Carl explains, Kirobo has been developing this solution for three years, and it applies to almost every type of blockchain-based financial transaction:\n\nWe\u2019ve searched the world, our partners have searched the world. We\u2019re not aware of anyone with anything close to this kind of technology. And most of what they\u2019ve put together is proprietary\u2014either it\u2019s patent pending, highly secretive, and it\u2019s not going to be easy to repeat. The engineers involved in this thing have been around for a decade in this industry; Kirobo has been around for three years. This is not something they just sort of thought about and they\u2019re starting to put in place. This has been well, well thought out. As far as its applicability, you know, it really applies to just about every single transaction\u2014financial transaction\u2014that happens in blockchain\u2026\n\nChris Carl, CEO of DigiMax Global Solution\nAs Chris Carl notes, the lack of callback options for misappropriated blockchain transactions is something that is keeping mainstream platforms for getting into the space. Thus, Kirobo has a real chance of making it\u2019s mark, given its prominent position in this emerging domain. Some people refer to this as a \u201cfirst mover advantage\u201d.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/MgedpD9RyGc",

        "selftext": " I am very new to investing. I would like to try ETFs and am looking at the pros/cons of different ones starting with QQQ. Any advice or answers to questions is very much appreciated. \n\n**What is QQQ?**\n\nInvesco QQQ is an exchange-traded fund that tracks the Nasdaq-100 Index. The Index includes the 100 largest non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq based on market cap.\n\nQQQ is the most direct way to \u201cinvest\u201d into the Nasdaq-100 index as it tracks it and is passively managed. It is heavily based on technology. This seems like it can be a con as it is \u201cless diverse\u201d or a pro if you are bullish in tech. \n\n**Top 10 Allocation: (https://www.invesco.com/qqq-etf/en/about.html)**\n\n**AAPL: 10.95%**\n\n**MSFT: 9.50%**\n\n**AMZN: 8.32%**\n\n**TSLA: 4.24%**\n\n**FB: 3.78%**\n\n**GOOG: 3.62%**\n\n**GOOGL: 3.31%**\n\n**NVDA: 2.69%**\n\n**PYPL: 2.31%**\n\n**INTC: 2.11%**\n\n**48.11% of total stocks are in the information technology sector.**\n\n[https://www.invesco.com/qqq-etf/en/home.html](https://www.invesco.com/qqq-etf/en/home.html)\n\nIt consistently outperforms it\u2019s common comparison being the S&amp;P 500 Index.\n\nA 10,000 dollar investment in QQQ on March 31st 2011 would become 61,493 dollars today, compared to 36,756 dollars from the S&amp;P 500 index. \n\nQQQ is considered a riskier ETF than the S&amp;P because of how technology based it is, meaning more of a capital gains ETF where S&amp;P involves more mature companies.\n\nMany people worry about a crash similar to the dot come crash where it took several years for QQQ to recover. If a crash like this happened, is that not a market wide thing? I don\u2019t see why QQQ would be affected any worse than other stocks that crash.\n\nPersonally, I am looking to put extra monthly income in ETFs such as, ARKK, ARKG, VTI, and VXUS along with QQQ and see what that gets me in the next 3-5 years. I just don\u2019t know at what % to balance each to have a well diversified portfolio. I would like to have QQQ be the largest percentage among these, is there a reason why that is a bad idea? Are there risks involved with QQQ that I have not found? Any other information anyone wants to share relating to QQQ  or ETFs in general is welcome.",

        "selftext": "Goooooood Sunday morning to all of you here on r/smallstreetbets. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning May 3rd, 2021.\n\n# **More earnings, April\u2019s big jobs report and inflation worries could swing markets in the week ahead - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/30/more-earnings-aprils-big-jobs-report-and-inflation-worries-could-swing-markets-in-the-week-ahead.html)**\n*****\n&gt; April\u2019s jobs report and a barrage of earnings news make for another busy week for markets, as the calendar rolls into May.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks notched solid gains in April, as REITs, consumer discretionary names and communications services companies outpaced the broader market, all more than 7% higher. However, April finished on a sour note, with stocks selling off on Friday.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cSince November, there\u2019s been a 30% rally,\u201d said Jimmy Chang, chief investment officer at Rockefeller Global Family Office. He noted that historically the November to April period is historically the strongest for stocks. \u201cThere\u2019s the adage \u2018sell in May, go away.\u2019 It may be somewhat appropriate this year since we\u2019ve done so well in the last six months.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # Big jobs report\n&gt; April\u2019s employment report is released Friday, and the market is expecting a big number.\n*****\n&gt; Economists say payrolls in April could easily reach 1 million, after 916,000 jobs were added in March. Estimates range from about 700,000 to a forecast of 2.1 million from Jefferies economists.\n*****\n&gt; According to Dow Jones, there is a consensus forecast of 978,000 among the economists it surveyed and the unemployment rate is expected to fall to 5.8% form 6%.\n*****\n&gt; Fed speakers will also be important after Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said in the past week that the Fed is still looking for \u201csubstantial further progress\u201d in its goals for the economy.\n*****\n&gt; The chairman emphasized that the Fed is not close to tapering back its bond buying program, a surprise to some investors. Some bond market pros had expected the Fed to start discussing cutting back purchases at its June meeting and begin to reduce its $120 billion monthly bond buying by the end of the year or early next year.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cNext week is all about the jobs number, because as part of the Fed\u2019s path to \u2018substantial progress\u2019 on their two roles, we\u2019ll see how much further along that path they are next Friday\u201d said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group. The Fed\u2019s mandate is to pursue full employment and a steady pace of Inflation, which it has targeted at 2%.\n*****\n&gt; The Fed has expected a temporary period of high inflation which it expects to see subside later in the year though Boockvar and others say inflation could be hotter than the Fed expects. The core personal consumption expenditures price index jumped 0.36% in March, with the year-ago rate rising from 1.4% to 1.8%. It is expected to go even higher in April. Headline inflation in the consumer price index is expected to begin running at 3% or better when it is reported May 12.\n*****\n&gt; Just days after Powell\u2019s comments on tapering, Dallas Fed President Rob Kaplan Friday said the Fed should begin the discussion on paring back bond purchases because imbalances in financial markets and the economy is improving faster than expected.\n*****\n&gt; The market\u2019s focus on the Fed\u2019s bond program makes the jobs report even more important. If the Fed starts to taper back those asset purchases, it would then signal it would be on the path toward raising interest rates. Most economists do not expect the Fed to raise interest rates before 2023.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIf this jobs number comes in super hot, it\u2019s going to make people up their estimate on when the Fed might taper,\u201d said Michael Schumacher, director rates at Wells Fargo.\n*****\n&gt; Powell is among Fed speakers in the coming week, but he is not expected to provide any new views when he participates in a National Community Reinvestment Coalition conference Monday afternoon. Kaplan speaks Tuesday and Thursday, and New York Fed President John Williams and Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester are also among Fed officials speaking in the coming week.\n*****\n&gt; # Earnings soar\n&gt; So far, a record 87% of S&amp;P 500 companies have beat earnings estimates, and earnings look to be growing by more than 46%, according to Refinitiv.\n*****\n&gt; Credit Suisse Chief U.S. Equity Strategist Jonathan Golub upped his forecast Friday for the S&amp;P 500 based on strong earnings. \u201cWe are raising our 2021 S&amp;P 500 price target to 4600 from 4300, representing 9.2% upside from current levels, and 22.5% for the year,\u201d he wrote.\n*****\n&gt; Earnings are expected from a diverse group of companies, from General Motors to ViacomCBS. Pharma will be in the spotlight as vaccine makers Pfizer and Moderna both report. Draftkings and Beyond Meat are also on the schedule.\n*****\n&gt; A host of travel related companies issue results, including Booking Holdings, Hilton Worldwide , Marriott Vacations, and Caesars Entertainment. Consumer brands, like Anheuser Busch Inbev and Estee Lauder also report, as do insurers including AIG, Allstate, and MetLife. (A calendar with some key earnings dates appears below.)\n*****\n&gt; Chang said the market has discounted a lot of the positive news already.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIn spite of the really strong reports from the bellwether companies, you\u2019re seeing some of the names starting to peter out a little bit,\u201d said Chang. \u201cI think it\u2019s a sign that so much good news is discounted. I suspect the market is due for a breather. I think in the next couple of months, we\u2019re likely to see sideways movement. There\u2019s likely to be a pullback which will be healthy.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 was up 5.2% in April, finishing Friday at 4,181. It is now up 11.2% for the year so far. The Dow rose 2.7% in April, to 33,874, and the Nasdaq gained 5.4% in April, ending Friday at 13,962.\n*****\n&gt; Chang said he expects some of the \u201cboring\u201d blue chips that haven\u2019t participated as much in the rally to do better. Some of those names can be found in pharma, he said.\n*****\n&gt; Heading into the coming week, investors will be watching for words of wisdom from Warren Buffett at Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s annual meeting Saturday.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/9wZQvOO.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE S&amp;P SECTORS FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/kGnKjBS.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/xazpmUE.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/ceFPlXO.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/N8zkbCl.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/EXJdhi8.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/a3EftWo.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/OA6dm0N.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/0UOEq2t.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/69XfINF.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/hdAqJr1.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/IEzICwV.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/9nsqXUH.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # S&amp;P 500 and DJIA Up Last 9 Post-Election Year Mays\n\n&gt; May officially marks the beginning of the \u201cWorst Six Months\u201d for the DJIA and S&amp;P. To wit: \u201cSell in May and go away.\u201d Our \u201cBest Six Months Switching Strategy,\u201d created in 1986, proves that there is merit to this old trader\u2019s tale. A hypothetical $10,000 investment in the DJIA compounded to a gain of $960,943 for November-April in 70 years compared to just $1,656 for May-October. The same hypothetical $10,000 investment in the S&amp;P 500 compounded to $788,997 for November-April in 70 years compared to a gain of just $10,145 for May-October.\n\n&gt; May has been a tricky month over the years, a well-deserved reputation following the May 6, 2010 \u201cflash crash\u201d. It used to be part of what we once called the \u201cMay/June disaster area.\u201d From 1965 to 1984 the S&amp;P 500 was down during May fifteen out of twenty times. Then from 1985 through 1997 May was the best month, gaining ground every single year (13 straight gains) on the S&amp;P, up 3.3% on average with the DJIA falling once and two NASDAQ losses.\n\n&gt; In the years since 1997, May\u2019s performance has been erratic; DJIA up twelve times in the past twenty-three years (four of the years had gains in excess of 4%). NASDAQ suffered five May losses in a row from 1998-2001, down \u2013 11.9% in 2000, followed by thirteen sizable gains in excess of 2.5% and five losses, the worst of which was 8.3% in 2010.\n\n&gt; Post-election Year Mays rank near the top, registering average gains on DJIA and S&amp;P 500 of 1.3% and 1.7% respectively. DJIA and S&amp;P 500 have advanced in every post-election year May beginning in 1985. Russell 1000 has been up ten years straight in post-election year Mays.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/4c1485a3ca7e34234ba1f7666450bc23/abec686095f47da5-c9/s400x600/90a50e5d1712125c12d3f5af1efad8228681daa0.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # S&amp;P 500 Up Over 10% First Four Months \u2013 Preceded Flat May to late-October\n\n&gt; As of yesterday\u2019s close, S&amp;P 500 was up 11.5% year-to-date. Provided these gains hold through the end of April, this year will be just the seventeenth time since 1950 that the S&amp;P 500 has finished the first four months of the year with a gain exceeding 10%. The best January to April span occurred in 1975, up 27.3% (S&amp;P 500 was in the early stages of a new bull market following the bear ending 10/3/1974 in which the S&amp;P 500 declined 48.2%). The next best year was, 1987 (most will remember what happened later that year) and the most recent year was 2019 (a solid year from beginning to end).\n\n&gt; In the above chart we have plotted all 17 previous years in which the S&amp;P 500 was up over 10% January through the end of April. Along side for comparison is \u201cAll Years,\u201d \u201cPost-Election Years,\u201d and 2021 through yesterday. In the previous 17 years, gains tended to fizzle in early-May before gaining some additional ground from around mid-June to mid-July before once again stalling out till late September with more weakness lasting until late-October. On average, by late-October arrived, gains from the previous three months were given back and since the start of May S&amp;P 500 gained around 2.5% on average. You don\u2019t have to go away in May but considering the historically modest gains from early-May to late-October, it may not quite be worth sticking around.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/ad49ec327ff1b942a31c993f0a0a82fe/79778de7b3df0abd-1c/s500x750/865ae39798a9e1d8450988b067a15e5a90a7c5bc.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Here Comes Sell In May\n\n&gt; \u201cThe sun was warm but the wind was chill. You know how it is with an April day. When the sun is out and the wind is still, you\u2019re one month on in the middle of May.\u201d American Poet Robert Frost\n\n&gt; One of the best known investment axioms is to \u201csell in May and go away.\u201d This is largely because the six months from May through October have historically been some of the weakest months of the year for stocks. As you can see below, the next six months have tended to be on the weak side.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/blog-4.30.21.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the next six months have indeed been the worst six months of the year, up only 1.7% on average. To add insult to injury, we are leaving the six most bullish months of the year. In fact, the S&amp;P 500 Index is set to gain close to 30% during these most bullish six months, one of the best six-month gains ever.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/blog-4.30.21-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; \u201cStocks are up more than 87% from the March lows, suggesting a well-deserved pullback during these troublesome months is quite possible,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cBut with an accommodative Fed, fiscal and monetary policy, along with an economy that is opening faster than nearly anyone expected, we\u2019d use any weakness as an opportunity to add to positions.\u201d\n\n&gt; Here\u2019s the catch, isn\u2019t there always a catch? Stocks have actually been higher during these worst months of the year eight of the past ten years.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Blog-4.30.21-3.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # U.S. Economy Jumps Out of the Gate in 2021\n\n&gt; In what was initially expected to be one of the slower quarters of the year, the U.S. economy jumped out of the gates in 2021, with gross domestic product (GDP) growing 6.4% quarter over quarter. A faster than expected vaccination program, nearly $3 trillion in fiscal stimulus\u2014including direct payments to consumers\u2014and faster than expected job growth helped fuel a surge in personal consumption\u2014the largest portion of GDP.\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, personal consumption grew 10.7% on an annualized basis in the first quarter, the second highest level since the 1960\u2019s:\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/4.29.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; \u201cThe U.S. economy is off to a great start in 2021, and this should set the stage for solid growth in the remainder of the year as pent up demand continues to flow through the economy,\u201d added LPL Financial Chief Investment Officer Burt White. \u201cMany areas of the country are still facing restrictions on activity, so we don\u2019t think growth will just be limited to the first quarter.\u201d\n\n&gt; However, the growth story in the first quarter wasn\u2019t solely about direct stimulus payments. While personal consumption has understandably gained a lot of attention, federal non-defense spending added the most to GDP in nearly 60 years, a segment of the economy unaffected by transfer payments like stimulus checks.\n\n&gt; Digging into the numbers even further, spending on services grew a modest 4.6%, which should accelerate in the second and third quarters as remaining restrictions are lifted in response to falling cases and rising vaccinations. As of April 28, the US is averaging around 2.5-3 million vaccines administered per day, which has helped over half the adult population receive at least one dose of the vaccine, while nearly 40% of adults are fully vaccinated, according to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n&gt; The U.S. vaccination program has helped pull the economy forward, but net trade was a modest drag on growth in the first quarter, where domestic growth pulled in imports at a faster pace than the recovery outside of the U.S. lifted exports. As the rest of the world gets better control of COVID-19, rebounding economic growth overseas should provide an additional tailwind for U.S. economy.\n\n&gt; We upgraded our forecast for U.S. GDP in our recent Weekly Market Commentary from 5\u20135.5% to 6.25\u20136.75%, and we expect to see the economy continue its pace in the second quarter as restrictions are lifted and activity normalizes.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Where Do President Biden\u2019s First 100 Days Stack Up Versus President Trump?\n\n&gt; President Biden\u2019s 100th day in office is tomorrow, on April 29. Hard to believe it has been 100 days already, but overall the economy continues to improve and stocks have done very well under our new President.\n\n&gt; We\u2019ve heard the question many times: Where does the Biden rally rank? That is what we will look at today. The term \u201chundred days\u201d was first used on July 24, 1933, on the radio by President Franklin D. Roosevelt (FDR). He was discussing the 100-day session of the 73rd U.S. Congress, but over time this term has changed to refer to the first 100 days of a new president.\n\n&gt; Per Ryan Detrick, Chief Market Strategist, \u201cPresident Biden has been quite kind for stocks, with the Dow up nearly 10%, which is on pace for the best first 100 days in office since FDR in the early 1930s. Then toss in the cherry on top that stocks had one of their greatest rallies ever from Election Day until the inauguration and it is clear that although maybe everyone might not like President Biden, but the stock market doesn\u2019t have many issues with him.\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the Dow has averaged 4.3% the first 100 days of a new President, while it has been higher the first 100 days in office for five of the past six Presidents. In fact, President Biden\u2019s return currently ranks as the third best since 1900, with only Taft and Roosevelt better. Lastly, breaking it down by political party and the first 100 days under a Democratic President was much stronger, up 10.3% on average versus down 0.2% for a Republican President.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/4.28-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Here\u2019s a chart we shared earlier this year that shows that stocks did amazingly well from Election Day until the inauguration under President Biden.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/4.28-Blog-CHart-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; What can we glean from those first 100 days? Is there any pattern that might suggest how stocks will do during the rest of the time President Biden is in office? You can look for yourself below, but there doesn\u2019t appear to be any clue as to what might happen. President Eisenhower had a weak first 100 days, then a big rally over the remainder of his time in office. Conversely, President Taft saw a big rally during the first 100 days, only to have negative returns for the remainder of his time in office. In the end, fundamentals, valuations, and technicals drive long-term equity returns. The good news is only once since the Great Depression did that mean lower returns for the remainder of time in office after the first 100 days.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/4.28.-Blog-Chart-3.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Wild Data Close To Q1\n\n&gt; Today was quite the day for economic data, with two key releases from the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) and Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). We'll start with BEA data on personal income and spending in March.\n\n&gt; First, as shown below, the savings rate surged in the month, with households saving 27.6% of personal income net of taxes. That's a huge number, even by the standards of the elevated savings rates that we've seen over the course of the pandemic.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/04/Eco-Review-1.png))**\n\n&gt; The reason there was so much saving going on is that transfer payments rose by more than $300bn on the month, driven by the delivery of economic impact payments also known as \"stimulus checks\" or even shorter: \"stimmies.\"\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/04/Eco-Review-2.png))**\n\n&gt; Incomes also rose thanks to rebounding labor market activity following winter storms in Texas during February and the longer-term trend of reopening across the economy. As shown, the 13.5% annualized growth of wage and salary income in the month was very strong. It was also helped along by wage growth, which we will discuss later on.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/04/Eco-Review-3.png))**\n\n&gt; With spending surging thanks to stimulus checks and other factors, core personal consumption expenditure prices surged by the most MoM since 2009, over 4% annualized. The 4% move was in no small part due to the swing in activity from February to March, and isn't likely to be sustained, but it is a helpful indicator that prices may be more robust in this recovery than they were during the low inflation post-GFC period.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/04/Eco-Review-4.png))**\n\n&gt; For broad inflation that will concern the Fed, one factor that will be needed along with steadily rising prices is strong wage growth. The second big report today was Q1 wages in the BLS Employment Cost Index (ECI). The ECI does a better job of measuring wage growth than other series because it accounts for changes in the composition of employment over time. As shown in the chart below, Q3 saw the strongest sequential wage growth on record, with a 4.6% annualized advance in wages versus Q4. Some of that came from incentive-paid occupations, which benefit from bonuses and related payments, skewing the results. As shown in the chart, though, there was very strong wage growth even excluding incentive-paid occupations. Anecdotal reports of very tight labor markets amidst booming reopening demand got support from this release.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/04/Eco-Review-5.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending April 30th, 2021** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIjA8Px0K-o))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 5.2.21**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5aQ1EZJdcmc))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt;

        "selftext": "Ticker: **$XIGM**\n\n**Why though:** After seeing it in April I decided \u00abwhy not, I love myself some cheapies\u00bb, it was on my watchlist, I did some research and jumped on board. Turns out it was a really good idea, because in that said month $XIGM made a full transformation from \u00aba company with an app with some clients and a 21% share in a shipping industry\u00bb into a complete ecosystem with a role in the remote economy.\n\n# What is Xigem - what they do\n\nXigem is a technology company from Toronto, with iAgent (Xigem Platform) as their main asset. Also, it works on a portfolio of companies in\u00a0various industries of the emerging trillion dollar remote economy. I'll cover the whole thing later in the text.\n\nMore - here, not to make it long: [https://www.xigemtechnologies.com/](https://www.xigemtechnologies.com/)\n\n# iAgent - what is\n\n**iAgent (or Xigem Platform)** is a mobile, cloud-based, geo-targeted customer acquisition and retention app, U.S. patented and Canadian patent-pending. Basically - an app (available in browser as well) to match sales and services with consumers, with a full real-time control of the operation.\n\nHere\u2019s a website [https://iagenttechnologies.com](https://iagenttechnologies.com/) you can watch a video there on the functions, or check the details in the prospectus, it was published on SEDAR on February 26, I just can\u2019t post a link here for some reason.\n\n# Tl;dr - what happened lately:\n\nIt turned from an \u00abambitious company\u00bb with nothing but forward-looking statements into a perspective one-stop-shop solution for all kinds of businesses and gathered a portfolio of companies in exploding markets, set to hit the market this summer.\n\n**A month ago they\u2019ve had:**\n\n2 LOIs with perspective clients\n\n**FluBusters**\n\n[https://www.flubusters.com/](https://www.flubusters.com/)\n\n&gt;Health Canada approved company in the disinfection market, with 3000 employees.\n\nAnd their own Germs Be Gone (I laughed hard at the name) sanitizer.\n\nBy the way, global sanitizers market is $2,64 Billion by now and set to grow **21.75% by 2027. A good client.**\n\n**ISI**\n\n[https://insurance-supermarket.ca/](https://insurance-supermarket.ca/about-us.html)\n\nDespite the fact that I\u2019m not the biggest fan of insurance companies, with\n\n&gt;..a client base of **100,000** Canadians, totalling to more than\u00a0**10 billion dollars**\u00a0in benefits\n\nISI looks like a good perspective client as well.\n\n**ISI is the original developer of Xigem\u2019s main app** \\- iAgent. From my understanding, they didn\u2019t find a way or resources to fully implement it in their workflow, and Xigem acquired it in an almost ready state to scale the thing and make it bigger. Spoiler: they did.\n\nOn April 27, they\u2019ve added **Baketree** to the list. It\u2019s a US baking company that will use XIgem Platform to manage their distribution network.\n\n[https://www.xigemtechnologies.com/xigem-technologies-to-develop-remote-technology-platform-for-baketree-inc/](https://www.xigemtechnologies.com/xigem-technologies-to-develop-remote-technology-platform-for-baketree-inc/)\n\n&gt;The U.S. bakery products market has been estimated at **US$94 billion in 2020**, with the global market expected to grow at a compound annual **growth rate of 3.9% through to 2027**.\n\nAgain, looking good as a client, and you can actually get their danish rolls in the US.\n\n**These 3 are huge, guaranteed, but just limited clients.**\n\nAdditionally, Xigem [decided to roll out](https://www.xigemtechnologies.com/xigem-technologies-to-launch-out-of-the-box-version-of-iagent/) a universal version for small and medium enterprises with CRM. **SMEs are estimated to represent over 90% of all businesses, 60-70% of employment and 55% of the World GDP.** It would be weird not to make something out-of-the-box at some point. Now basically any company can get Xigem Platform, when it will hit the market, and with CRM - it\u2019s a bigger thing than just a monitoring app.\n\n# Now - to the most interesting part. The portfolio.\n\nFirst - there's [Shipit.to](http://shipit.to/), a shipment tracking company from Israel. In fact, the **$1,1 Mil acquisition** was the start of their portfolio. Later, [Shipit.to](http://shipit.to/) signed **a new airline - AirBridge Cargo**, in addition to Lufthansa, Korean Air and a dozen of others. $XIGM assets are developing as well.\n\n# So what makes a new DD justified?\n\n**Today Xigem announced a new LOI - with FOOi Inc.** It\u2019s a P2P mobile payment system, and they didn\u2019t just get a share or agreed to sign a contract in the future. They basically bought it completely, with the whole team of developers, clients, and so on. Direct quote [from here](https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/xigem-technologies-enters-fintech-market-060000671.html):\n\n&gt;the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of FOOi Inc. for consideration of $500,000\n\n# What did they just buy:\n\nFOOi website: [https://www.fooi.ca](https://www.fooi.ca)\n\n(note: Fooi means \u201cTip\u201d in Dutch)\n\nA review by Itbusiness: [https://www.itbusiness.ca/news/fooi-the-tipping-point-in-cashless-transactions-in-canada/114304](https://www.itbusiness.ca/news/fooi-the-tipping-point-in-cashless-transactions-in-canada/114304)\n\n**My understanding:** A peer-to-peer/charity/business money transaction system with simplicity of the process as the key feature.\n\nI know that P2P is not exactly a new thing, but FOOi looks like it hits the competitors in the weak spots:\n\n**Venmo** is all about personal info and it charges 3%, **Zelle** doesn\u2019t work with half of banks and cards, **Cash App** charges fees even for a deposit, and I don\u2019t even won\u2019t to start **PayPal** commissions rage.\n\nFOOi charges only for withdrawal, **no extra fees**, doesn\u2019t require email/phone, can keep you anonymous, processes the transaction instantly, and works on any smartphone - not limited to iOS-only or Android-only.\n\nIt's a nice market with a lot of room to grow, not just in Canada, but globally:\n\n[https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/10/26/2114054/0/en/Global-4-49-Billion-Peer-to-Peer-P2P-Payment-Market-Outlook-to-2027.html](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/10/26/2114054/0/en/Global-4-49-Billion-Peer-to-Peer-P2P-Payment-Market-Outlook-to-2027.html)\n\n&gt;Global P2P Payment Market is expected to reach **$4,491.14 million by 2027**, growing at a CAGR of 11.8% during the forecast period.\n\nAnyway, that\u2019s just about FOOi. I didn\u2019t go deep enough into the analysis to scream \u00abIt\u2019s the new STRIIIIIPE\u00bb at the top of my lungs, it just looks like a perspective project that you can use right here right now.\n\n# FOOi+Xigem= ???\n\nThe most important part is that they say **FOOi won\u2019t be just a separate thing, it will be also integrated into the Xigem Platform.**\n\n**This fact kind of changes everything, and heres a** [direct quote](https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/xigem-technologies-enters-fintech-market-060000671.html)**:**\n\n&gt;Integrated with iAgent, Xigem's platform technology, FOOi can create a unique environment for the Company's clients and their users.\n\nThey seriously plan to integrate it.\n\nTo cut it short, iAgent now can do:\n\n* Customer acquisition;\n* CRM;\n* Service management and geo tracking of nearest employees (from a browser tab);\n* Network and field management;\n* Real-time control of the tasks;\n* And finally - **seamless instant payments**.\n\nCorrect me if i\u2019m wrong, but it LOOKS like a real problem-solver ecosystem for business owners who deal with a lot of network, people and asset management. Something that saves money, time, cuts risks and expenses. Also a convenient thing for clients. They should teach it to deal with taxes and do mailing lists now.\n\nIn addition - Xigem portfolio is now worth of 1,6 Mil, and growing (shipit - with new airlines, FOOi - with new clients). And some other developments:\n\n# Advisory Board:\n\n* **Avi Greenspoon** as the inaugural member, Executive Vice President and General Counsel of III Dune Capital Partners Limited.

So far we can trade on their FLS and LOIs. When it will start operating - it won\u2019t be at this price point, I believe.\n\n**Shares, issued and outstanding:**\u00a0106 Mil\n\n**Market cap:**\u00a044,7 Mil\n\n**Total funds available:**\u00a02,02 Mil\n\nDebt: Settled, as they [announced](https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/xigem-technologies-announces-shares-debt-120000546.html):\n\n&gt;Xigem Technologies has entered into the debt settlement agreements with three arm's length creditors whereby the Company will settle outstanding payables totalling $76,000 through the issuance of 361,904 common shares.\n\nPrimary Revenue Models (SAAS)\n\n* The **basic** plan will be priced at **$100 per month**, as basic as it gets;\n* **Pro Plan** (will include 24-hour live chat customer support and more users) will be priced at **$350 per month**;\n* **Enterprise Plan** (up to 100 users) will be priced at **$5,000 per month.**\n\n**Alternative Revenue Models are:** Freemium, Recurring Payments, Per User Pricing and Per Feature Pricing. (All from Prospectus)\n\n# Technical Analysis\n\nI\u2019m by no means good at it, but I tend to listen to the guys who know more than me, so here\u2019s the **report from Morningstar**:\n\n[https://www.xigemtechnologies.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Morningstar-Quantitative-Equity-Report-XIGM-April-28-2021.pdf](https://www.xigemtechnologies.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Morningstar-Quantitative-Equity-Report-XIGM-April-28-2021.pdf)\n\nAt 0,68 price per share they said it was **30% undervalued** and the **fair price was around 1,01 per share**. Note that it was **BEFORE the FOOi and the CRM announcement.**\n\n# My plan?\n\nAfter looking at the order book, I see that there\u2019s **no significant resistance up to 0,9**. The stock can easily go up. I have decided to break my investments in 2 parts on this one. 80% speculative and 20% investment. **I will sell 80$% at 0,85 and investment will be there forever (or until 1,5 lol).**\n\n# Instead of a conclusion\n\nI\u2019m not a meme guy, suck at it and basically too old for it, but the format sums up the whole idea pretty good - and every statement is justified either in the links or in the text:\n\n**Xigem a month ago:** we have 2 future clients and will develop an app they will use, patents and plans, remote economy boom, ummm yeah that's it.\n\n**Xigem now:** we bought a 1 Mil share in transportation, got our own successful mobile payment app, doubled the number of signed clients, settled the debt, have an ecosystem that will solve a good half of every business problems, established an advisory board with a rich asian dude that works with China and Amazon and also a lawyer named Avi that knows half of the top management in Toronto, implemented CRM, and decided to make it all available to 70% of the world\u2019s businesses by this summer. Yes, we\u2019re still a cheapie at around 0,4 per share, why do you ask?",

        "selftext": " Hi Everyone! Here is my Monday Newsletter :) Happy trades and please DM me with any questions you may have :)  \n**Week of 5/3/21**\n\nThe S&amp;P500 opened Monday 5/3/21 at 4205.86, above the previous close of 4181.61 on Friday 4/30/21.\n\nManufacturing numbers release early in the week, with the April Markit Manufacturing PMI released Monday, and trade deficit &amp; factory orders numbers for March releasing Tuesday, May 4th. Markit services PMI and ISM services index numbers for April release Wednesday, and productivity &amp; labor costs for Q1 release Thursday. The ADP Employment report for April releases Wednesday, and weekly jobless claims numbers release Thursday, May 6th. April unemployment rates release Friday, as well as nonfarm payrolls, and average hourly earnings.\n\nThe average cost to build a home skyrocketed by $36,000 according to the National Association of Homebuilders. The rising prices are likely associated with soaring lumber costs. Lumber futures are up 125% on a 6-month basis. REITs reflected the change, rising throughout April. March construction numbers release Monday at 10AM.\n\nVerizon has reached an agreement with Apollo Global Management to sell its Verizon Media platform, which consists of internet pioneers Yahoo and AOL. The agreement to sell the tech platforms to the private equity firm will be worth $5 Billion. As a stipulation of the agreement Verizon will maintain a 10% stake in the new company, which Apollo plans to call \u201cYahoo.\u201d Apollo releases earnings on Monday, May 3rd.\n\nChip manufacturers have been inundated with demand following 2020\u2019s COVID shutdowns and the, undoubtedly correlated, increase in demand for consumer electronics. Cisco, one of the world\u2019s largest chip manufacturers, is struggling to keep up with demand.\n\nCisco revealed several steps it is taking to alleviate the imbalance in supply and demand including a $4.5 billion acquisition of Acacia Communications and a $20 billion plan to build two new manufacturing plants in Arizona. Cisco CEO Chuck Robbins commented extensively on the situation, and estimates it could \u201c...\\[take\\] another six months\u2026\u201d for the company to resume normal operation. Around 85% of all internet traffic passes through Cisco hardware.\n\nThe effects of the shortage can be seen across industries. Among companies affected by the shortage are car manufacturers. Wayne Griffiths, head of VW\u2019s Spanish brand, spoke on the issue, stating that the company will, \u201c...need to face considerable challenges in the second quarter\u2026\u201d So far the shortage has prevented the company from building over 100,000 vehicles.  \nGM reports earnings on Wednesday and markets will be curious to see if the chip shortage has affected them. Despite supply chain concerns CNBC\u2019s Jim Cramer was optimistic in his recent review of the company, saying \u201cIf you want to bet on electric vehicles with much less risk, I say buy some Ford or General Motors\u2026 these are huge, established companies with improving balance sheets and real earnings, earnings that happen to be skyrocketing right now...\u201d\n\nThe United States Government has also expressed concern regarding the chip shortage. United States President Joe Biden held a conference with business leaders in April to address the issue. During the conference the President expressed a desire to move more chip manufacturing into American plants, citing 75% of global manufacturing as being based in East Asia.  \nMeanwhile Taiwan-based chip manufacturing giant TSMC announced a plan worth $100 billion USD to expand their companies manufacturing capacity. The announcement comes in tandem with company founder Morris Chang\u2019s plea to the Taiwanese government for increased support, citing a fear that if the Taiwan-based manufacturer fails to meet demand US or Chinese manufacturers will fill the gap.\n\nThe increase in demand for electronics caused by the pandemic has boded well for Apple, who reported earnings of $1.40 per share on Wednesday, April 28th, exceeding analyst estimates of $0.98 after a strong Q2 for sales. The earnings call comes on the heels of Apple\u2019s first product showcase of the year Wednesday April 21st, and the company\u2019s announcement that it will be taking steps to increase its footing in the instant messaging market. Apple stated it plans to increase the amount of features provided by it\u2019s iMessage app, with the objective being to bring it more in line with popular messengers offered by Facebook, WhatsApp, and Snapchat.\n\nMicrosoft reported earnings of $1.95 per share Tuesday, April 27th, beating analyst estimates of $1.78 by a small margin. Microsoft, who also saw an increase in demand for its technology as a result of the pandemic, has greatly benefitted from an increased demand for cloud-services. Microsoft\u2019s cloud-based service hub, Azure, posted 2020 growth of 43%. The company expects to post great earnings despite the current chip-shortage, having generated much of its growth from the pandemic in the software-as-a-service sector.\n\n**Some of the Companies with Earnings this Week**\n\n**Monday, May 3rd:**  \nEstee Lauder  \nApollo Global Management Inc  \nCarvana  \nON Semiconductor Corp  \nThe Mosaic Company  \nChegg Inc.\n\n**Tuesday, April 27th:**  \nPfizer  \nT-Mobile  \nCVS  \nActivision Blizzard  \nConocoPhillips  \nSysco  \nZillow  \nXilinx  \nHelloFresh  \nUnder Armor  \nWestern Union  \nMcAfee  \n**Wednesday, April 28th:**  \nPaypal Inc.  \nUber  \nGeneral Motors  \nTwilio Inc  \nMetLife Inc  \nBudweiser Brewing Company  \nBarrick Gold Corp.  \nFranco-Nevada Corp  \nEtsy Inc  \nFox Corp  \nGoDaddy  \nZynga  \n**Thursday, April 29th:**  \nSquare  \nNintendo  \nModerna  \nMonster Beverage Corp  \nRegeneron Pharmaceuticals  \nRoku Inc  \nAIG  \nAllstate  \nWayfair Inc  \nCBS Corp  \nPeloton Interactive  \nCloudflare  \nExpedia  \nKellogg Co.  \nAlliant Energy Corp.  \nPenn National Gaming  \nNorwegian Cruise Line Ltd.  \nDropbox\n\n**Friday, April 30th:**  \nDraft Kings  \nNCsoft",

Since the start of the year, PLTR stock is down about 15%. Its current market capitalization stands at $38 billion.\n\nThe company, founded in 2013, builds and deploys software platforms to businesses and governments worldwide, as well as U.S. federal agencies so that they can collect and analyze data to make better decisions. It has three main products: Gotham, Foundry, and Apollo. It operates a narrow-moat, as Morningstar analyst Mark Cash pointed out in his latest piece.\n\nFollowing the direct public offering (DPO) in September 2020, PLTR shares more than quadrupled and hit $45 by late January. But then profit-taking kicked in. On May 11, following the release of first-quarter results, the stock went below $17. Now, it is hovering around $20.\n\nWhat\u2019s next for PLTR stock? If you are a long-term investor looking to add a high-growth name to your portfolio, you could consider buying the dips. Here\u2019s why.\n\nAccording to research from SAS, \u201cBig data analytics helps organizations harness their data and use it to identify new opportunities. That, in turn, leads to smarter business moves, more efficient operations, higher profits and happier customers.\u201d\n\nInvestors expect software and data platforms like Palantir to capitalize on the growth of big data analytics. Its initial customers were mostly governments, starting with various U.S. federal agencies. However, 2020 also saw commercial contracts with metals miner Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO), and utility PG&amp;E (NYSE:PCG). It also partnered with Amazon\u2019s (NASDAQ:AMZN) AWS unit.\n\nThe group\u2019s Q1 results were robust. Total revenue jumped to $341 million, up 49% year-over-year (YoY). Its U.S. commercial revenue grew 72% YoY, and the U.S. government revenue grew 83% YoY.\n\nThe net loss was $123.5 million. Adjusted diluted EPS was 4 cents. A year ago, it had been a loss per share of 1 cent. Adjusted free cash flow was $151 million, increasing $441 million YoY.\n\nCFO Dave Glazer told participants on the earnings call that, \u201cWith over $2.3 billion in cash on the balance sheet and strong free cash flow in Q1, we paid down our outstanding debt in early April\u2026 For our Q2 revenue guidance, we expect year-over-year revenue growth of 43% or $360 million.\u201d\n\nFor the 12 months that ended March 31, 2021, the company saw a 29% YoY growth in revenue per customer. The Street was pleased to hear that management believes it can grow 30% per year, in the coming next several years.\n\nGlazer also commented on the possibility of Palantir\u2019s adding cryptocurrencies to its balance sheet. In fact, the group already accepts Bitcoin (CCC:BTC-USD) from its customers. \n\nFor a company co-founded by Peter Thiel, the decision to become involved in financial technology (fintech) was to be expected. He was one of the names who set up PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) and an early investor in Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).\n\nOna final note, we should note that despite the recent decline in price, PLTR stock is not cheap by traditional valuation measures. It trades for about 130x forward price-to-earnings (P/E) and 16x current price-to-sales (P/S). Therefore, the shares are likely to continue to be volatile in the short-term.\n\nThe Bottom Line on PLTR Stock\n\nBig data is becoming increasingly more important for governments and commercial enterprises. Palantir\u2019s recent results showed management has substantial long-term visibility. Although I\u2019d not want to bottom-pick tech shares amid the continuing volatility, I find PLTR stock to be appropriate for long-term growth portfolios.\n\nFinally, for investors who are interested in PLTR stock but are not ready to commit full capital into the shares, an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that holds Palantir shares could also be appropriate.\n\nExamples include: the ARK Next Generation Internet ETF (NYSEARCA:ARKW), the First Trust US Equity Opportunities ETF (NYSEARCA:FPX) and the FlexShares Morningstar US Market Factors Tilt Index Fund (BATS:TILT).\n\nOn the date of publication, Tezcan Gecgil is long PLTR stock.

        "selftext": "Goooooood Sunday morning to all of you here on r/StockMarket. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning May 3rd, 2021.\n\n# **More earnings, April\u2019s big jobs report and inflation worries could swing markets in the week ahead - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/30/more-earnings-aprils-big-jobs-report-and-inflation-worries-could-swing-markets-in-the-week-ahead.html)**\n*****\n&gt; April\u2019s jobs report and a barrage of earnings news make for another busy week for markets, as the calendar rolls into May.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks notched solid gains in April, as REITs, consumer discretionary names and communications services companies outpaced the broader market, all more than 7% higher. However, April finished on a sour note, with stocks selling off on Friday.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cSince November, there\u2019s been a 30% rally,\u201d said Jimmy Chang, chief investment officer at Rockefeller Global Family Office. He noted that historically the November to April period is historically the strongest for stocks. \u201cThere\u2019s the adage \u2018sell in May, go away.\u2019 It may be somewhat appropriate this year since we\u2019ve done so well in the last six months.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; # Big jobs report\n&gt; April\u2019s employment report is released Friday, and the market is expecting a big number.\n*****\n&gt; Economists say payrolls in April could easily reach 1 million, after 916,000 jobs were added in March. Estimates range from about 700,000 to a forecast of 2.1 million from Jefferies economists.\n*****\n&gt; According to Dow Jones, there is a consensus forecast of 978,000 among the economists it surveyed and the unemployment rate is expected to fall to 5.8% form 6%.\n*****\n&gt; Fed speakers will also be important after Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said in the past week that the Fed is still looking for \u201csubstantial further progress\u201d in its goals for the economy.\n*****\n&gt; The chairman emphasized that the Fed is not close to tapering back its bond buying program, a surprise to some investors. Some bond market pros had expected the Fed to start discussing cutting back purchases at its June meeting and begin to reduce its $120 billion monthly bond buying by the end of the year or early next year.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cNext week is all about the jobs number, because as part of the Fed\u2019s path to \u2018substantial progress\u2019 on their two roles, we\u2019ll see how much further along that path they are next Friday\u201d said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group. The Fed\u2019s mandate is to pursue full employment and a steady pace of Inflation, which it has targeted at 2%.\n*****\n&gt; The Fed has expected a temporary period of high inflation which it expects to see subside later in the year though Boockvar and others say inflation could be hotter than the Fed expects. The core personal consumption expenditures price index jumped 0.36% in March, with the year-ago rate rising from 1.4% to 1.8%. It is expected to go even higher in April. Headline inflation in the consumer price index is expected to begin running at 3% or better when it is reported May 12.\n*****\n&gt; Just days after Powell\u2019s comments on tapering, Dallas Fed President Rob Kaplan Friday said the Fed should begin the discussion on paring back bond purchases because imbalances in financial markets and the economy is improving faster than expected.\n*****\n&gt; The market\u2019s focus on the Fed\u2019s bond program makes the jobs report even more important. If the Fed starts to taper back those asset purchases, it would then signal it would be on the path toward raising interest rates. Most economists do not expect the Fed to raise interest rates before 2023.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIf this jobs number comes in super hot, it\u2019s going to make people up their estimate on when the Fed might taper,\u201d said Michael Schumacher, director rates at Wells Fargo.\n*****\n&gt; Powell is among Fed speakers in the coming week, but he is not expected to provide any new views when he participates in a National Community Reinvestment Coalition conference Monday afternoon. Kaplan speaks Tuesday and Thursday, and New York Fed President John Williams and Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester are also among Fed officials speaking in the coming week.\n*****\n&gt; # Earnings soar\n&gt; So far, a record 87% of S&amp;P 500 companies have beat earnings estimates, and earnings look to be growing by more than 46%, according to Refinitiv.\n*****\n&gt; Credit Suisse Chief U.S. Equity Strategist Jonathan Golub upped his forecast Friday for the S&amp;P 500 based on strong earnings. \u201cWe are raising our 2021 S&amp;P 500 price target to 4600 from 4300, representing 9.2% upside from current levels, and 22.5% for the year,\u201d he wrote.\n*****\n&gt; Earnings are expected from a diverse group of companies, from General Motors to ViacomCBS. Pharma will be in the spotlight as vaccine makers Pfizer and Moderna both report. Draftkings and Beyond Meat are also on the schedule.\n*****\n&gt; A host of travel related companies issue results, including Booking Holdings, Hilton Worldwide , Marriott Vacations, and Caesars Entertainment. Consumer brands, like Anheuser Busch Inbev and Estee Lauder also report, as do insurers including AIG, Allstate, and MetLife. (A calendar with some key earnings dates appears below.)\n*****\n&gt; Chang said the market has discounted a lot of the positive news already.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIn spite of the really strong reports from the bellwether companies, you\u2019re seeing some of the names starting to peter out a little bit,\u201d said Chang. \u201cI think it\u2019s a sign that so much good news is discounted. I suspect the market is due for a breather. I think in the next couple of months, we\u2019re likely to see sideways movement. There\u2019s likely to be a pullback which will be healthy.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 was up 5.2% in April, finishing Friday at 4,181. It is now up 11.2% for the year so far. The Dow rose 2.7% in April, to 33,874, and the Nasdaq gained 5.4% in April, ending Friday at 13,962.\n*****\n&gt; Chang said he expects some of the \u201cboring\u201d blue chips that haven\u2019t participated as much in the rally to do better. Some of those names can be found in pharma, he said.\n*****\n&gt; Heading into the coming week, investors will be watching for words of wisdom from Warren Buffett at Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s annual meeting Saturday.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/9wZQvOO.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE S&amp;P SECTORS FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/kGnKjBS.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/xazpmUE.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/ceFPlXO.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/N8zkbCl.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/EXJdhi8.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/a3EftWo.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/OA6dm0N.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/0UOEq2t.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/69XfINF.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/hdAqJr1.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/IEzICwV.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/9nsqXUH.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # S&amp;P 500 and DJIA Up Last 9 Post-Election Year Mays\n\n&gt; May officially marks the beginning of the \u201cWorst Six Months\u201d for the DJIA and S&amp;P. To wit: \u201cSell in May and go away.\u201d Our \u201cBest Six Months Switching Strategy,\u201d created in 1986, proves that there is merit to this old trader\u2019s tale. A hypothetical $10,000 investment in the DJIA compounded to a gain of $960,943 for November-April in 70 years compared to just $1,656 for May-October. The same hypothetical $10,000 investment in the S&amp;P 500 compounded to $788,997 for November-April in 70 years compared to a gain of just $10,145 for May-October.\n\n&gt; May has been a tricky month over the years, a well-deserved reputation following the May 6, 2010 \u201cflash crash\u201d. It used to be part of what we once called the \u201cMay/June disaster area.\u201d From 1965 to 1984 the S&amp;P 500 was down during May fifteen out of twenty times. Then from 1985 through 1997 May was the best month, gaining ground every single year (13 straight gains) on the S&amp;P, up 3.3% on average with the DJIA falling once and two NASDAQ losses.\n\n&gt; In the years since 1997, May\u2019s performance has been erratic; DJIA up twelve times in the past twenty-three years (four of the years had gains in excess of 4%). NASDAQ suffered five May losses in a row from 1998-2001, down \u2013 11.9% in 2000, followed by thirteen sizable gains in excess of 2.5% and five losses, the worst of which was 8.3% in 2010.\n\n&gt; Post-election Year Mays rank near the top, registering average gains on DJIA and S&amp;P 500 of 1.3% and 1.7% respectively. DJIA and S&amp;P 500 have advanced in every post-election year May beginning in 1985. Russell 1000 has been up ten years straight in post-election year Mays.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/4c1485a3ca7e34234ba1f7666450bc23/abec686095f47da5-c9/s400x600/90a50e5d1712125c12d3f5af1efad8228681daa0.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # S&amp;P 500 Up Over 10% First Four Months \u2013 Preceded Flat May to late-October\n\n&gt; As of yesterday\u2019s close, S&amp;P 500 was up 11.5% year-to-date. Provided these gains hold through the end of April, this year will be just the seventeenth time since 1950 that the S&amp;P 500 has finished the first four months of the year with a gain exceeding 10%. The best January to April span occurred in 1975, up 27.3% (S&amp;P 500 was in the early stages of a new bull market following the bear ending 10/3/1974 in which the S&amp;P 500 declined 48.2%). The next best year was, 1987 (most will remember what happened later that year) and the most recent year was 2019 (a solid year from beginning to end).\n\n&gt; In the above chart we have plotted all 17 previous years in which the S&amp;P 500 was up over 10% January through the end of April. Along side for comparison is \u201cAll Years,\u201d \u201cPost-Election Years,\u201d and 2021 through yesterday. In the previous 17 years, gains tended to fizzle in early-May before gaining some additional ground from around mid-June to mid-July before once again stalling out till late September with more weakness lasting until late-October. On average, by late-October arrived, gains from the previous three months were given back and since the start of May S&amp;P 500 gained around 2.5% on average. You don\u2019t have to go away in May but considering the historically modest gains from early-May to late-October, it may not quite be worth sticking around.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/ad49ec327ff1b942a31c993f0a0a82fe/79778de7b3df0abd-1c/s500x750/865ae39798a9e1d8450988b067a15e5a90a7c5bc.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Here Comes Sell In May\n\n&gt; \u201cThe sun was warm but the wind was chill. You know how it is with an April day. When the sun is out and the wind is still, you\u2019re one month on in the middle of May.\u201d American Poet Robert Frost\n\n&gt; One of the best known investment axioms is to \u201csell in May and go away.\u201d This is largely because the six months from May through October have historically been some of the weakest months of the year for stocks. As you can see below, the next six months have tended to be on the weak side.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/blog-4.30.21.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the next six months have indeed been the worst six months of the year, up only 1.7% on average. To add insult to injury, we are leaving the six most bullish months of the year. In fact, the S&amp;P 500 Index is set to gain close to 30% during these most bullish six months, one of the best six-month gains ever.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/blog-4.30.21-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; \u201cStocks are up more than 87% from the March lows, suggesting a well-deserved pullback during these troublesome months is quite possible,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cBut with an accommodative Fed, fiscal and monetary policy, along with an economy that is opening faster than nearly anyone expected, we\u2019d use any weakness as an opportunity to add to positions.\u201d\n\n&gt; Here\u2019s the catch, isn\u2019t there always a catch? Stocks have actually been higher during these worst months of the year eight of the past ten years.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Blog-4.30.21-3.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # U.S. Economy Jumps Out of the Gate in 2021\n\n&gt; In what was initially expected to be one of the slower quarters of the year, the U.S. economy jumped out of the gates in 2021, with gross domestic product (GDP) growing 6.4% quarter over quarter. A faster than expected vaccination program, nearly $3 trillion in fiscal stimulus\u2014including direct payments to consumers\u2014and faster than expected job growth helped fuel a surge in personal consumption\u2014the largest portion of GDP.\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, personal consumption grew 10.7% on an annualized basis in the first quarter, the second highest level since the 1960\u2019s:\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/4.29.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; \u201cThe U.S. economy is off to a great start in 2021, and this should set the stage for solid growth in the remainder of the year as pent up demand continues to flow through the economy,\u201d added LPL Financial Chief Investment Officer Burt White. \u201cMany areas of the country are still facing restrictions on activity, so we don\u2019t think growth will just be limited to the first quarter.\u201d\n\n&gt; However, the growth story in the first quarter wasn\u2019t solely about direct stimulus payments. While personal consumption has understandably gained a lot of attention, federal non-defense spending added the most to GDP in nearly 60 years, a segment of the economy unaffected by transfer payments like stimulus checks.\n\n&gt; Digging into the numbers even further, spending on services grew a modest 4.6%, which should accelerate in the second and third quarters as remaining restrictions are lifted in response to falling cases and rising vaccinations. As of April 28, the US is averaging around 2.5-3 million vaccines administered per day, which has helped over half the adult population receive at least one dose of the vaccine, while nearly 40% of adults are fully vaccinated, according to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n&gt; The U.S. vaccination program has helped pull the economy forward, but net trade was a modest drag on growth in the first quarter, where domestic growth pulled in imports at a faster pace than the recovery outside of the U.S. lifted exports. As the rest of the world gets better control of COVID-19, rebounding economic growth overseas should provide an additional tailwind for U.S. economy.\n\n&gt; We upgraded our forecast for U.S. GDP in our recent Weekly Market Commentary from 5\u20135.5% to 6.25\u20136.75%, and we expect to see the economy continue its pace in the second quarter as restrictions are lifted and activity normalizes.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Where Do President Biden\u2019s First 100 Days Stack Up Versus President Trump?\n\n&gt; President Biden\u2019s 100th day in office is tomorrow, on April 29. Hard to believe it has been 100 days already, but overall the economy continues to improve and stocks have done very well under our new President.\n\n&gt; We\u2019ve heard the question many times: Where does the Biden rally rank? That is what we will look at today. The term \u201chundred days\u201d was first used on July 24, 1933, on the radio by President Franklin D. Roosevelt (FDR). He was discussing the 100-day session of the 73rd U.S. Congress, but over time this term has changed to refer to the first 100 days of a new president.\n\n&gt; Per Ryan Detrick, Chief Market Strategist, \u201cPresident Biden has been quite kind for stocks, with the Dow up nearly 10%, which is on pace for the best first 100 days in office since FDR in the early 1930s. Then toss in the cherry on top that stocks had one of their greatest rallies ever from Election Day until the inauguration and it is clear that although maybe everyone might not like President Biden, but the stock market doesn\u2019t have many issues with him.\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the Dow has averaged 4.3% the first 100 days of a new President, while it has been higher the first 100 days in office for five of the past six Presidents. In fact, President Biden\u2019s return currently ranks as the third best since 1900, with only Taft and Roosevelt better. Lastly, breaking it down by political party and the first 100 days under a Democratic President was much stronger, up 10.3% on average versus down 0.2% for a Republican President.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/4.28-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Here\u2019s a chart we shared earlier this year that shows that stocks did amazingly well from Election Day until the inauguration under President Biden.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/4.28-Blog-CHart-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; What can we glean from those first 100 days? Is there any pattern that might suggest how stocks will do during the rest of the time President Biden is in office? You can look for yourself below, but there doesn\u2019t appear to be any clue as to what might happen. President Eisenhower had a weak first 100 days, then a big rally over the remainder of his time in office. Conversely, President Taft saw a big rally during the first 100 days, only to have negative returns for the remainder of his time in office. In the end, fundamentals, valuations, and technicals drive long-term equity returns. The good news is only once since the Great Depression did that mean lower returns for the remainder of time in office after the first 100 days.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/4.28.-Blog-Chart-3.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Wild Data Close To Q1\n\n&gt; Today was quite the day for economic data, with two key releases from the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) and Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). We'll start with BEA data on personal income and spending in March.\n\n&gt; First, as shown below, the savings rate surged in the month, with households saving 27.6% of personal income net of taxes. That's a huge number, even by the standards of the elevated savings rates that we've seen over the course of the pandemic.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/04/Eco-Review-1.png))**\n\n&gt; The reason there was so much saving going on is that transfer payments rose by more than $300bn on the month, driven by the delivery of economic impact payments also known as \"stimulus checks\" or even shorter: \"stimmies.\"\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/04/Eco-Review-2.png))**\n\n&gt; Incomes also rose thanks to rebounding labor market activity following winter storms in Texas during February and the longer-term trend of reopening across the economy. As shown, the 13.5% annualized growth of wage and salary income in the month was very strong. It was also helped along by wage growth, which we will discuss later on.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/04/Eco-Review-3.png))**\n\n&gt; With spending surging thanks to stimulus checks and other factors, core personal consumption expenditure prices surged by the most MoM since 2009, over 4% annualized. The 4% move was in no small part due to the swing in activity from February to March, and isn't likely to be sustained, but it is a helpful indicator that prices may be more robust in this recovery than they were during the low inflation post-GFC period.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/04/Eco-Review-4.png))**\n\n&gt; For broad inflation that will concern the Fed, one factor that will be needed along with steadily rising prices is strong wage growth. The second big report today was Q1 wages in the BLS Employment Cost Index (ECI). The ECI does a better job of measuring wage growth than other series because it accounts for changes in the composition of employment over time. As shown in the chart below, Q3 saw the strongest sequential wage growth on record, with a 4.6% annualized advance in wages versus Q4. Some of that came from incentive-paid occupations, which benefit from bonuses and related payments, skewing the results. As shown in the chart, though, there was very strong wage growth even excluding incentive-paid occupations. Anecdotal reports of very tight labor markets amidst booming reopening demand got support from this release.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/04/Eco-Review-5.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending April 30th, 2021** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIjA8Px0K-o))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 5.2.21**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5aQ1EZJdcmc))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt;

        "selftext": "The instant deposits are ACH transfer that can take up to 5 days for Robinhood, but wondering if there are any constraints on why not having an instant debit card deposit or withdrawal opt-in feature for added on fee- so funds can be instantly useable in the Robinhood cash balance as well or another investment app, not just the $5,000 for Robinhood gold investing, and no limits for other applications too.  What is the legal restriction behind these limits, and the best ways to transact with the highest amounts and lowest fees?\n\n  \nIt is possible to access Robinhood cash immediately if you deposit using CashApp's instant cashout feature to your Robinhood debit card, you can also withdraw instantly to CashApp as well.  Services like Earnin, Dave, CashApp, and PayPal all have instant withdrawals and deposits with fees (usually around $3) to U.S. residents and a few other growing number of supported countries. This means you instantly withdraw funds, and the funds are withdrawn from the account too within seconds, not sitting there longer waiting to post while you are able to still access it on an app like Robinhood.\n\nThis could be a feature Robinhood or another service is implementing, are there restrictions to this or more literature available?   \n\n\nIronically I asked this question in the Robinhood discord, not much of a nuanced discussion occurred.  \n\nI currently am using cold storage for crypto and want to stick to a new investing app.  Ameritrade, E\\*trade, Fidelity, Vanguard, and M1 are ones I keep hearing about, what are your guys' preferences &amp; thoughts?  \n\nI would enjoy one that has the ability to instantly transact, with the lowest broker fees etc.  \n\nThank you!",

        "selftext": "First of all, many thanks to all participants of wallstreetbets - you are to some extent responsible for the fact that a few money-hungry wankers of this world now have to sweat.  Only do not forget: Money can negatively influence the character - we humans are predominantly susceptible to such things with power. Quite another thing: I am a passionate weed smoker but live in extremely backward Germany, Bavaria. Here, the same repressive drug laws have been in place for more than 60 years. In the meantime, CBD products are allowed, but the consumption of CBD flowers is still prohibited. Like some people on this earth, I have also been through a lot in my past - but I came out of my past with more strength. At the end of last year I had a house search because of CBD flowers (!!!) - my laptop and smartphone, which I need daily as a freelancer, were confiscated among other things. I will now have a trial in July this year because of CBD flowers... Since I do not accept this tour of the German state under any circumstances and would like to set an example in Germany, I am looking for people who support me financially in my rocky road to the Supreme Court. Yes, I know that comes across a little shabby, but everyone would thus indirectly support a modern drug policy in Germany with a donation - I am ready to sue up to the European Court. If you find my request crappy, I understand it completely, if you kick me otherwise you can write me a PN and I give you my paypal address. By the way, I also produce videos about my cause, so that no one gets the idea I would be a lousy scammer. Unfortunately, the videos are currently only in German - I'm trying to expand this soon with English subtitles! Greetings from Germany and stay healthy people and keep it up - against capitalism!",

They had some sort of legal trouble and had to scaleback something, but they are managing fine and I don't believe more legal trouble is coming.\n\nThey have a 10% dividend, P/E of 4.85, rising net income, little debt, and a rising ROE at 30%. \n\nIs anyone onto this little stock?

        "selftext": "New guy question here- I recently decided to join the terrifying world of stock investments. My wife and I are about to pop out our first child (2 week countdown!) so I figured it was time to start paying closer attention to how my money works for me besides just our 401k. So I did the only (?) logical thing and put $10k on a variety of safe stocks. Microsoft, Amazon, Google, FB, Target, Walmart, Cisco, TMS, PayPal, Square, Applied Materials, Crowdstrike. Yes clearly I work in IT. Companies that are established and would generally be considered, at least from a company success perspective, low risk. And then I proceeded to lose a few hundred bucks in my very first day yesterday. Now I get that stocks are a long term investment. I\u2019m not trying to make a quick buck, day trade or participate in options speculation. I also am aware of the rule don\u2019t bet what you can\u2019t afford to lose. I can zero all of it without an issue\u2026this is a starting point for me. Nonetheless, the results last week left me feeling a little depressed and kind of wanting to take my ball and go home. Can anyone please point towards some good resources to learn more about how to be smart about this? I\u2019ve been lurking here for a long time but it\u2019s hard to tell sound advice from more meme-based advise. To give you an idea how much I don\u2019t know, I almost bought a Motley Fool subscription before reading comments on here about their service. Help my baby please!

        "selftext": "\nI have an idea and it's my way of giving back. Let me explain why \ud83d\ude42 Since the start of 2021 until now, you lot have helped me so much in life and I can't thank you legends enough. Because as of Friday, 2 in the arvo, one hour before the bell rang, while I sipped my coffee, about to get ready for rehabilitation (It's only 2 times a month now) I light a winnie blue up, and in a celebratory manner... Because my portfolio hit AUD $400 000. \n\nI started this year with Au $18,000, it was all my savings from my football days. And the only benefit of having to retire early from a broken back, because it helped me earn 400k lol.\nAnd btw, my personal story (Skip to the next paragraph if you want to get right to the proposal) \nI played rep rugby, 1 level before professionals, I was a forward and I won't like, i was decent, but I don't believeI would've been good enoughfor 1st grade, but that's not the point. The point is, I got tackled and done the good old...cervical\u00a0fracture. \ud83d\ude44 I'm ok now but it took 2 years to fully recover lol. Btw all I remember when it happened was this Samoan bloke and him saying 'Aw boys, this white fella isn't moving.. He is just... wait, he is looking at the clouds?' and then 'Aw wtf, and yelled out to the ref for help. And said calcmy 'its ok white brother, just don't move! I Or my mum will flog because I hurt someone (he was 20 \ud83d\ude02)  imagine a 6'3, 135kgs dude, crying over how he hurt someone, and how he said it.\n\nIt's both hilarious and sad. it makes me emotional just thinking of it.\n\n\n I'm now good mates with that bloke, and he plays first grade for a team in Sydney, Australia.. It's ok if you don't believe me, I wouldn't either. \n\nBut he was the one who suggested I give back to you legends here, so that's why I needed to explain all that.\n\nHe actually gave me 20k when he signed with (I can't say) so he is half the reason why I made 405k. And I agree with him, I should give back. \ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffc\n\n\nAnyway here's what I'm asking permission for...\n\n\nIf I purchased $16,000 GME or whatever the team suggests next time you the fellas organise a pump, and for the members here, could I give it away to the members? I'll explain. \n\nI would love for everyone to be in on it, but it's not worth it. So what im thinking... Have a specific number of people in on it? And have two different groups? One group: 10,000 people get equal share in any profits from its chosen stock. And have that for two groups, two different stocks. \n\n- The two groups can vote on what company i buy in on.\n\n\nAnd yes, I am saying profits.. But I do understand how unlikely it is, and how I'm risking $16,000.\n\nIt's just me speaking hypothetically. The $16k is real though lol \n\n\ud83d\ude42\n\n So 100% of the profits would be shared equally among the people here who enter, and I would only take back what I originally put in. (I'll chuck in 1k out of my own money if the profit IF it isn't much)\n\nSo..Could the mods and admins organise for a safe place where the members here can send me their PayPal addresses? (That's if I'm allowed to do this, and it's understandable if I can't)\nAnd I would prove everything first. Whatever you need, I will do or can provide. Finances, proof of purchase, etc.\n\nThis is my why way of giving back.. But I totally understand if I can't. I'll think of something else or I don't mind suggestions on what in allowed to do. \n\nAnyway.. Either way, yes or no.. I need to thank all you and I am, but words can't describe the way i feel.\n\nSo a cheers lads and keep up the good work \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc\n\nP.s \nSorry for any bad grammar, I don't have my\nContacts with me atm. If I have time, I'll fix any spelling mistakes and any bad grammar tomorrow.",

They are a fin-tech like PayPal and Squares, thus should be given a higher multiple for valuation. They got a lot of exciting and growth customers like Barstool (PENN), YouTube (Google), Twitch (AMZN), FanDuel (PDYPY), Roblox (RBLX), CoinBase (COIN), Visa (V), ApplePay (APPL), BetMGM (MGM), Spotify (SPOT), Microsoft/Xbox etc., and on top of that they got a huge digital wallet (#2 in market share) where you can trade/buy the fast-growing cryptocurrencies like Bitcoins. I truly believed this Paysafe is undervalued compared to its peers. You can read a very good Paysafe DD below on reddit and it gives a lot of insight of Paysafe valuation and bear cases: \n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/mysz54/reviewing\\_the\\_bear\\_case\\_on\\_paysafe\\_psfe/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/mysz54/reviewing_the_bear_case_on_paysafe_psfe/)\n\n(the link above is a really really good read with lots of info about Paysafe, so I\u2019m not going to repeat most of the good points the author mentioned in that sub.) \n\nMost of the time analysis use assumptions to make predictions on future growth. As an example, EV-related stocks (PLUG, BLNK, QS, LAZR, NKLA, BLDP, etc) get higher or ridiculous valuation based on assumption that gasoline cars will eventually be phased out. As you can see most if not all of these companies are unprofitable and some don\u2019t even have revenue, yet worth billions. While this assumption may be accurate, it is extremely hard to know 1) how big the market is 2) How many competitors each company has 3) when will growth begin to accelerate.  Because of this predictive nature, it\u2019s really hard to know how long you will have to hold onto the stocks before they pop. When or if it will pop is anyone's guess. So while holding onto these stocks will likely result in wild price swings thus high risk / high rewards.\n\nBut what if you have the data before you showing the financial growth of your customers or partners? If your customers/partners' revenue grows, it\u2019s more likely than not they are using more of your products or services.  Paysafe is one such company where you can actually look at their customers/partners' financial reports to predict where the company will go in the future and when growth will start.  For this reason, Paysafe is more of a lower risk but still has high reward potential.\n\nPaysafe will be reporting earning for the very first time as a public company again on May 11. The good news is we already have their customers results in and here are some breakdown of their 1st QTR results showing huge growth:\n\n1. PENN (Reported May 7, 2021) - \u201cPenn National\u2019s income from operations rose to $216.5 million in the first quarter against ($560.6) million in the prior-year quarter. Adjusted EBITDAR jumped 77.2% from the year-ago quarter to $447 million. Moreover, adjusted EBITDAR margin expanded to 35.1% from 22.6% a year ago.\u201d  ( source: [https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/1515673/penn-national-penn-q1-earnings-revenues-beat-estimates](https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/1515673/penn-national-penn-q1-earnings-revenues-beat-estimates) )\n2. DraftKing ( Reported May 7, 2021) - \u201cDraftKings is raising its fiscal year 2021 revenue guidance from a range of $900 million to $1 billion to a range of $1.05 billion to $1.15 billion, which equates to year-over-year growth of 63% to 79% and a 16% increase compared to the midpoint of our previous guidance\u201d\n\n(Source: [https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/05/07/2225374/0/en/DraftKings-Reports-First-Quarter-2021-Results-and-Raises-2021-Revenue-Guidance.html](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/05/07/2225374/0/en/DraftKings-Reports-First-Quarter-2021-Results-and-Raises-2021-Revenue-Guidance.html) )\n\n3. Spotify (April 28th, 2021)- \u201cRevenue increased 16% to \u20ac2.15 billion ($2.6 billion) from \u20ac1.85 billion ($2.22 billion) in the same period last year\u2026.\u201d  (source: [https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/streaming/9564180/spotify-q1-2021-earnings-report/](https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/streaming/9564180/spotify-q1-2021-earnings-report/))\n\n   4. Youtube/Google ( April 27th, 2021 ) - \u201c In its first-quarter earnings report Tuesday, Google parent company [Alphabet](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/GOOGL) said YouTube [brought in](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/27/alphabet-goog-earnings-q1-2021.html) revenue of $6.01 billion in advertising revenue during the quarter \u2014 up from $4 billion from a year ago, for a growth rate of 49%. That\u2019s an acceleration over its 46% growth in Q4. It\u2019s also nearly twice the growth rate of Netflix, which reported 24% revenue growth [in Q1](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/20/netflix-nflx-q1-2021-earnings.html), and [expects](https://s22.q4cdn.com/959853165/files/doc_financials/2021/q1/FINAL-Q1-21-Shareholder-Letter.pdf) growth to slow to 19% next quarter.\u201d (source: [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/27/youtube-could-soon-equal-netflix-in-revenue.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/27/youtube-could-soon-equal-netflix-in-revenue.html) )\n\n   5. Skillz ( May 4, 2021 ) - \u201cRevenue grew to $83.7 million during the first quarter of 2021, up 92% over the prior year. Gross profit grew to $79.4 million during the first quarter of 2021, up 95% over the prior year.\u201d (source: [https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210504006307/en/CORRECTING-and-REPLACING-Skillz-Reports-Record-Q1-Revenue-and-Raises-2021-Guidance](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210504006307/en/CORRECTING-and-REPLACING-Skillz-Reports-Record-Q1-Revenue-and-Raises-2021-Guidance) )\n\nAs you can see these Paysafe\u2019s customers/partners are reporting explosive growth. While some of these companies may report an earning loss it may be due to higher expenses such as customers acquisition cost (i.e. Draftking). However,  here we are more focused on their revenue as the more transactions they do the more likely all or part of that transaction is done by Paysafe. These companies reported earnings before Paysafe, so it can be highly expected Paysafe will report a very good earning and future growth projection tomorrow ( May 11).\n\nSeveral things to note about Paysafe besides their customer\u2019s earning growth. These factors will also influence Paysafe\u2019s future growth:\n\n1. They are a monopoly when it comes to iGaming/Sport Betting as you can see the explosive growth by DKNG, MGM, PENN, SKLZ, etc.\n2. Paysafe took a hit during the pandemic because they also do offline transaction processing, but now things are opening up we can expect going forward these offline transactions will grow again. Also, when re-opening occur, more sport events will occur thus more betting means more transactions for Paysafe. \n3. They are #2 in digital wallets and you can buy digital currency with the wallet. These currency has been generating huge revenue for PayPal and SQ (more on this below)\n\nFinally, both PayPal and SQ reported earning before Paysafe and their results beat estimation:\n\nPaypal earning ( May 5, 2021) \u201c Revenue: $6.03 billion vs. $5.90 billion expected by Refinitiv\u201d (source: [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/05/paypal-pypl-earnings-q1-2021.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/05/paypal-pypl-earnings-q1-2021.html) )\n\nSquare earning ( May 6, 2021 ) \u201cSquare reported a profit of 41 cents per share vs. 16 cents per share expected in a Refinitiv survey of analysts. It also brought in $5.06 billion of revenue vs. $3.36 billion expected by Refinitiv.\u201d ( source: [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/06/square-sq-earnings-q1-2021.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/06/square-sq-earnings-q1-2021.html))\n\nSo I can say with confidence Paysafe will likely beat their own guidance for Q1 on May 11th. For those of you who don\u2019t know Paysafe, they are not a small player.  Their transaction volume is about that of SQ \\~$100 Billion. If Paysafe is able to show growth on par with PayPal and SQ they should be trading at a much higher multiple. See the reddit link above for DD on valuation.\n\nPaysafe involved with Gaming, Sports, digitalcurrency which I find very exciting and feel that if I own the stock I\u2019ll be part of the journey of growth with these sectors. Roaring Kitty/ DeepFuckingValue simply invested in GME because he liked the stock. I\u2019m investing in Paysafe simply because it's cool and sexy, regardless of its growth potential. \n\nIn summary, I think Paysafe is a low risk / high reward stock compare to other fintech. Their growth is easier to predict as we can rely on their publicly traded customers data which is showing high growth going forward. They got the 2nd largest digital wallet. They are involved in the highly popular and fast growth digital currency market. I believe as a monopoly in iGaming/Sport Betting their growth will be massive when the 4 largest states: CA, TX, NY, FL begin to allow online sport betting. This is something about Paysafe that I like so much because no other fintech has this space. This is a massive high growth area and they own the space. For these reason, I am extremely bullish and I like Paysafe for both short and longer term play.\n\nDisclaimer: I own Paysafe commons, warrants, and option calls. I am not a financial adviser.

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, May 6, 2021**\n\nRemarkably, despite many individual companies pulling back steeply today, the three major indexes finished the day positive, driven by gains in financial stocks and stability in mega-caps. Growth stocks and more speculative plays have been hit hard by a combination of inflationary fears and recent suggestions by monetary officials that the interest rate should be raised. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) closed the day 0.81%, less than 1% below it\u2019s record high. The Dow Jones (DIA) recorded a new intraday record while the Nasdaq (QQQ) closed 0.76%. Market participants continue to monitor commentary from monetary officials, ongoing earnings season, and new economic data, particularly the April Jobs Report set for release tomorrow morning.\n\nAfter reclaiming the leadership in April as the best performing sector in the SPY, so far in May we have seen investors rotate out of big tech stocks and into financial stocks, with many big banks pushing all-time highs today. Market participants are worried that a suggested raise in interest would affect the already stretched valuation of some companies. Given the rally the market saw in April, some analysts are worried that positive catalysts for equities are getting harder to achieve and may be running out. The economy in the US is recovering faster than initially predicted by analysts, with this earnings season seeing 86% of companies in the S&amp;P 500 that have reported earnings  beat estimates, according to data from FactSet. \n\nTreasury Secretary Janet Yellen suggested that interest rates may need to rise in the near-term to prevent the economy from overheating, with the recent economic data and corporate earnings showing economic activity recovering much faster than expected as effective distribution of the vaccine in the US allows states to gradually reopen. Yellen said, \u201cIt may be that interest rates will have to rise somewhat to make sure that our economy doesn't overheat, even though the additional spending is relatively small relative to the size of the economy. It could cause some very modest increases in interest rates to get that reallocation, but these are investments our economy needs to be competitive and to be productive. I think our economy will grow faster because of them.\" In later remarks, she added that raising rates was not something she was predicting or recommending and that the decision ultimately rests with the Federal Reserve. She said, \u201cLet me be clear, that\u2019s not something I\u2019m predicting or recommending. If anybody appreciates the independence of the Fed, I think that person is me.\u201d\n\nThe Labor Department will release its April jobs report on Friday, which is expected to show a staggering nearly 1 million payrolls came back last month, accelerating March\u2019s gain. As a reminder, in March, the Department of Labor reported nonfarm payrolls increased by 916,000 for the month while the unemployment rate fell to 6% (unemployment rate was 14.6% in April 2020). Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been looking for an increase of 675,000 and an unemployment rate of 6%.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Weekly unemployment claims fell to 498,000 last week\u2014a new low since the Covid-19 pandemic began more than a year ago. The four-week average of initial claims is also at the lowest point since the pandemic began. Read more [here](https://www.wsj.com/articles/weekly-jobless-claims-coronavirus-05-06-2021-11620247798).\n* The Bank of England upped their growth estimates for the economy of the UK, anticipating GDP will grow 7.25% in the country, up from its forecast for 5% growth in February. The BOE also now sees inflation averaging 2.5% in 2021, up from its prior forecast for 2%, but said the rise in price pressures will likely be \"temporary.\" \n* NIO announced the company will expand into Norway, with the group\u2019s first service and delivery center set to open in the capital Oslo in September.\n* A lot of stocks pulled back despite posting better than expected earnings. The market is very narrow right now, with gains concentrated in the financials, energy, and mega-caps.\n* IBM introduced what it says is the world's first 2-nanometer chip making technology. The technology could be as much as 45% faster than the mainstream 7-nanometer chips in many of today's laptops and phones and up to 75% more power efficient, the company said.

        "selftext": "What if I told you that Qualcomm, Intel, Skyworks, Texas Instruments, Samsung, and Analog devices all had something in common in their supply chain? They all buy their testing capital equipment from Cohu. \n\nCohu offers a few different products. All of them are within the market of testing computer chips. Why is this market important? Well on the customer end, imagine if you spent 2500$ on a laptop and the intel chip inside didn't work. You'd return it to BestBuy, who would return it to HP, who would return it to Intel. A long and expensive chain of returns for a nonfunctional product. This issue can also be more than just an inconvenience. What if you bought a self driving tesla and one of the chips in the sensors didn't work? What if a Boeing airbus had some faulty chips in the navigation system? In short, it's very important that the semi manufacturers know that their product is working when they send it out. \n\n**Bullish trends**\n\n1. Semiconductor volume is increasing in the following industries, **mobile phones** (5g needs 2x the chips), **Computing**, **Automotive** (electric and self driving need exponentially more chips than cars of the past), **Cloud computing** (basically a warehouse of semiconductors) **AI** (not sure how this works, but it's going to need computer chips). Here's my main argument: ***Each of those markets is rapidly growing, and at the same time chip volume is rising in each of those markets***. This creates a sort of exponential effect for the semiconductor chain. Not only is there a strong catalyst from increasing volume in existing markets (phones, pcs), but we also see rapidly growing new markets that also have high density. (cloud, auto). This is very bullish for the entire semi supply chain.  But the key feature that benefits testing in particular, is increasing complexity of chips. A more complex chip requires more complex testing, which demands a higher premium. \n2. Semiconductor shortage. We all know demand for computer chips is very high. And supply has just about run out. This means that prices for semiconductors should increase due to scarcity. This is great news for Cohu, as it leaves more margin to charge for testing. If you were ford would you pay a premium on chips in order to produce your vehicles?\n3. Increasing chip complexity, on smaller wafers, demands a higher price for testing. AMAT recently noted on April 6th analyst day that capital intensity (% revenue spent on capital equipment) is returning to the 2000 highs of 16%. This increased capital intensity seems especially true when we consider the global chip shortage. Intel and Nvidia are opening new fabs in the last couple months. These factories are going to require a shit-ton of capital equipment. For example TSMC announced they'll be spending $100 billion over the next 3 years on capital equipment, as their fabs have been running at 100% for months and still can't keep up with demand.\n4. Trend of strong growth. Cohu has shown strong growth in the last year. In Q1 2020, revenue was $138.9 million, and gross margin was 41.7%. Q1 2021 revenue was just reported at $225.1 million, and gross margin was 45.6%. This is annual revenue growth of 62%, and margin growth of 9%. Business outlook in only getting better as the semiconductor shortage worsens, and demand continues to grow across sectors.\n5. Very high accounts receivable. Accounts receivable is up 30% annually to 197 million$. Recurring customers represent 48% of Cohu's revenue, so this is a very strong sign in my opinion. \n\n**Bearish trends**\n\n1. The company is on a huge downturn in the last few trading days due to announcing 42-45% gross margin for Q2 instead of 45%+, like Q1. This is on increased revenue of 234-250 million forecasted for Q2. A decrease in GM on growing revenue is never a great sign. The reason for this change is that much of the forecasted growth is in the automotive segment, which is lower margin than other segments I mentioned in the last section. Essentially the chips in cars aren't as complicated as the chips in PCs or phones, so they are less expensive, and therefore have a lower margin for testing. I will point out that the firm is likely to generate more gross margin dollars next quarter than this quarter, albeit on lower gm %. (.43x240=$103.2 gm, vs this last quarter 225x.456=$102.6gm). \n2. Recent stock offering. Cohu sold 4,950,000 shares at 41$ at the start of march. This diluted the shares available, but raised $202 million for the firm. They used this to pay off debt, and fund future growth. \n3. strong competition. Cohu's main competitors are advantest, and teradyne. These are two large global firms that have significantly more financial resources than Cohu. Cohu does have some advantages over these strong competitors, it's the global leader in Radio frequency power amplifier. RF amplifiers are a key component in mobile phones, and are increasing in volume with the 5g rollout. (more chips per phone, and more complexity) Essentially Cohu is in the dominant position in this growing market. Cohu is also the leader in automotive handling. (handling is a process where chips are moved into the testing device, then sorted based on results).\n\n**Fundamental analysis**\n\nI use a ratio similar to p/e. I use gross margin/market cap. (If I was buying the whole company, I'd want to know how much profit I'm purchasing, I don't like p/e because it can be manipulated by the # of shares issued).\n\nCohu annual gm=$316,000,000. Cohu market cap=$1,925,000,000\n\n$316 million/$1925 million=6.09\n\nThis is a very attractive price/gm ratio. Lets compare it to some other companies ratios. \n\nCohu-6.09\n\naapl-19.12\n\namzn-18\n\nter-11.3\n\nadvantest-7.19\n\nswks-17.9\n\nIf cohu were trading at the same multiplier as it's large cap competitor, Teradyne, the stock price would nearly double.\n\nTaking a look at the balance sheet, Cohu is in a much better position today than 1 year ago. They have $290 million of cash, almost double from a year ago. They also have significantly lower long term debt. \\~$200 million today versus \\~$300 million a year ago. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Technical analysis**\n\n[Cohu 1 year chart](https://preview.redd.it/pav84wurgjw61.png?width=1504&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3d65ce5a266334b6f1c8a9cd3fb344509441451e)\n\nAs we can see from the 1 year chart above, Cohu seems to find support around the $40 mark for the past 6 months. Currently it's chillin out on the support line, so this indicates to me that it's a good time to purchase cohu, as I love buying dips. We can also see it's found resistance at around $50, having tested that line 3-4 times since the start of the year. I cannot say with certainty that it will break this resistance line, but I do expect it to at least check this number again some time in the next 2-3 months. My expected range for this stock in the next 3 months is between $50 and $65, which leaves room for some nice profit if one were to buy at $40. \n\nIn conclusion, cohu is a small cap in an extremely hot market. It's got some big competitors, but it holds certain key advantages over them. The financial position of the company is really good currently, and it's growth should continue for the foreseeable future. It's strongest catalyst is that semiconductor density is increasing in existing markets, and new markets are emerging with high density, which has the potential to create enormous growth. For this reason, I think COHU is a great choice. (Even if you disagree on Cohu, you will want to have some semiconductors in your portfolio for the next few years). \n\nDisclaimer: I'm holding call options on this company. \n\ncheers",

        "selftext": "SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Epic Games faces an uphill legal battle against Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) in an antitrust trial starting Monday, and a defeat for the maker of \"Fortnite\" could make it harder for U.S. government regulators to pursue a similar case against the iPhone maker, legal experts said.\n\nBut win or lose at the trial, Epic, which has pursued an aggressive public relations campaign against Apple alongside its court pleadings, may have already accomplished a major goal: Drawing Apple squarely into the global debate over whether and how massive technology companies should be regulated.\n\nApple has mostly succeeded in staying out of the regulatory crosshairs by arguing that the iPhone is a niche product in a smartphone world dominated by Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s Android operating system. But that argument has become harder to sustain with the number of iPhone users now exceeding 1 billion.\nEpic alleges Apple has such a strong lock on those customers that the app store constitutes a distinct market for software developers over which Apple has monopoly power. Apple is abusing that power, Epic argues, by forcing developers to use Apple's in-app payment systems - which charge commissions of up to 30% - and to submit to app-review guidelines the gaming company says discriminate against products that compete with Apple's own.\n\n\"It's not a super-strong suit - I don't think they are likely to win,\" said Rebecca Haw Allensworth, a law professor at Vanderbilt Law School. \"But it has already achieved a lot of its purpose, which is drawing attention to some of Apple's practices that many developers see as abusive.\"\nUPHILL BATTLE\n\nEpic's arguments draw on major antitrust cases against Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Eastman Kodak and American Express (NYSE:AXP), but apply those precedents in new ways that have not been tested in U.S. courts, legal experts said.\n\nFor example, in arguing that iPhones are a software market unto themselves, Epic relies partly on a 1992 U.S. Supreme Court decision that rejected efforts by Kodak to force owners of its copying machines to use Kodak repair services.\n\nSpencer Waller, a competition law professor at the Loyola University Chicago School of Law, said the Kodak decision has had mixed success in subsequent cases.\n\n\"Plaintiffs are often unsuccessful because courts read Kodak narrowly at times,\u201d Waller said.\nEpic also faces hurdles in its contention that Apple's in-app payment commissions are too high at 30% and could be as much as 10 times lower if market forces prevailed. American courts have been reluctant to dive into setting specific rates, in large part because unlike Europe, the prevailing interpretation of U.S. antitrust law does not consider a dominant firm charging high prices to be anticompetitive in itself.\n\nApple argues that whatever dominant position it may have in mobile software is an outgrowth of its creation of both the iPhone and a curated App Store that makes consumer comfortable.\n\"If you obtained a monopoly legitimately, you're allowed to charge high prices,\" said Randal Picker, a professor at the University of Chicago Law School.\n\nRegardless of who wins at the trial expected to last three weeks before Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers (NYSE:ROG) in Oakland, California, the case is all-but-certain to be appealed to the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, which last year reinforced the notion that dominant firms can charge high prices in a case involving Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc.\n\"Anticompetitive behavior is illegal under federal antitrust law. Hypercompetitive behavior is not,\" Circuit Judge Consuelo Callahan wrote in the court's opinion.\n\nA federal antitrust official, speaking anonymously because the official was not authorized to speak to the media, said that an Epic loss would dim the chances of the government pursuing a similar lawsuit against Apple.\n\nBREWING ANTITRUST DEBATE\n\nEpic's suit has ramped up pressure on Apple in the court of public opinion at a time when the iPhone maker's business practices are facing fresh scrutiny around the world.\nThe U.S. Department of Justice https://reut.rs/3vAq5sD is probing the company's practices, Reuters has reported, and regulators in the United Kingdom and Australia have opened probes or called for regulation.\n\nEuropean Union regulators last week accused Apple of distorting competition in the music streaming market, siding with Spotify (NYSE:SPOT) Technology in the zone's first major anti-competition charge against Apple.\n\nEpic advertisements decrying Apple for taking such a big cut of revenue are landing aside those headlines.\n\"The public can understand these issues, and in many ways understand them better than these judges who have never played a game in their life,\" said Thomas Horton, a professor at the University of South Dakota School of Law.\n\nThe biggest threat to Apple's App Store is not lawsuits, but rather new laws regulating digital platforms, said Joel Mitnick, a partner at Cadwalader, Wickersham &amp; Taft and a former U.S. Federal Trade Commission trial lawyer.",

        "selftext": "What if I told you that Qualcomm, Intel, Skyworks, Texas Instruments, Samsung, and Analog devices all had something in common in their supply chain? They all buy their testing capital equipment from Cohu. \n\nCohu offers a few different products. All of them are within the market of testing computer chips. Why is this market important? Well on the customer end, imagine if you spent 2500$ on a laptop and the intel chip inside didn't work. You'd return it to BestBuy, who would return it to HP, who would return it to Intel. A long and expensive chain of returns for a nonfunctional product. This issue can also be more than just an inconvenience. What if you bought a self driving tesla and one of the chips in the sensors didn't work? What if a Boeing airbus had some faulty chips in the navigation system? In short, it's very important that the semi manufacturers know that their product is working when they send it out. \n\n**Bullish trends**\n\n1. Semiconductor volume is increasing in the following industries, **mobile phones** (5g needs 2x the chips), **Computing**, **Automotive** (electric and self driving need exponentially more chips than cars of the past), **Cloud computing** (basically a warehouse of semiconductors) **AI** (not sure how this works, but it's going to need computer chips). Here's my main argument: ***Each of those markets is rapidly growing, and at the same time chip volume is rising in each of those markets***. This creates a sort of exponential effect for the semiconductor chain. Not only is there a strong catalyst from increasing volume in existing markets (phones, pcs), but we also see rapidly growing new markets that also have high density. (cloud, auto). This is very bullish for the entire semi supply chain.  But the key feature that benefits testing in particular, is increasing complexity of chips. A more complex chip requires more complex testing, which demands a higher premium. \n2. Semiconductor shortage. We all know demand for computer chips is very high. And supply has just about run out. This means that prices for semiconductors should increase due to scarcity. This is great news for Cohu, as it leaves more margin to charge for testing. If you were ford would you pay a premium on chips in order to produce your vehicles?\n3. Increasing chip complexity, on smaller wafers, demands a higher price for testing. AMAT recently noted on April 6th analyst day that capital intensity (% revenue spent on capital equipment) is returning to the 2000 highs of 16%. This increased capital intensity seems especially true when we consider the global chip shortage. Intel and Nvidia are opening new fabs in the last couple months. These factories are going to require a shit-ton of capital equipment. For example TSMC announced they'll be spending $100 billion over the next 3 years on capital equipment, as their fabs have been running at 100% for months and still can't keep up with demand.\n4. Trend of strong growth. Cohu has shown strong growth in the last year. In Q1 2020, revenue was $138.9 million, and gross margin was 41.7%. Q1 2021 revenue was just reported at $225.1 million, and gross margin was 45.6%. This is annual revenue growth of 62%, and margin growth of 9%. Business outlook in only getting better as the semiconductor shortage worsens, and demand continues to grow across sectors.\n5. Very high accounts receivable. Accounts receivable is up 30% annually to 197 million$. Recurring customers represent 48% of Cohu's revenue, so this is a very strong sign in my opinion. \n\n**Bearish trends**\n\n1. The company is on a huge downturn in the last few trading days due to announcing 42-45% gross margin for Q2 instead of 45%+, like Q1. This is on increased revenue of 234-250 million forecasted for Q2. A decrease in GM on growing revenue is never a great sign. The reason for this change is that much of the forecasted growth is in the automotive segment, which is lower margin than other segments I mentioned in the last section. Essentially the chips in cars aren't as complicated as the chips in PCs or phones, so they are less expensive, and therefore have a lower margin for testing. I will point out that the firm is likely to generate more gross margin dollars next quarter than this quarter, albeit on lower gm %. (.43x240=$103.2 gm, vs this last quarter 225x.456=$102.6gm). \n2. Recent stock offering. Cohu sold 4,950,000 shares at 41$ at the start of march. This diluted the shares available, but raised $202 million for the firm. They used this to pay off debt, and fund future growth. \n3. strong competition. Cohu's main competitors are advantest, and teradyne. These are two large global firms that have significantly more financial resources than Cohu. Cohu does have some advantages over these strong competitors, it's the global leader in Radio frequency power amplifier. RF amplifiers are a key component in mobile phones, and are increasing in volume with the 5g rollout. (more chips per phone, and more complexity) Essentially Cohu is in the dominant position in this growing market. Cohu is also the leader in automotive handling. (handling is a process where chips are moved into the testing device, then sorted based on results).\n\n**Fundamental analysis**\n\nI use a ratio similar to p/e. I use gross margin/market cap. (If I was buying the whole company, I'd want to know how much profit I'm purchasing, I don't like p/e because it can be manipulated by the # of shares issued).\n\nCohu annual gm=$316,000,000. Cohu market cap=$1,925,000,000\n\n$316 million/$1925 million=6.09\n\nThis is a very attractive price/gm ratio. Lets compare it to some other companies ratios. \n\nCohu-6.09\n\naapl-19.12\n\namzn-18\n\nter-11.3\n\nadvantest-7.19\n\nswks-17.9\n\nIf cohu were trading at the same multiplier as it's large cap competitor, Teradyne, the stock price would nearly double.\n\nTaking a look at the balance sheet, Cohu is in a much better position today than 1 year ago. They have $290 million of cash, almost double from a year ago. They also have significantly lower long term debt. \\~$200 million today versus \\~$300 million a year ago. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Technical analysis**\n\n[Cohu 1 year chart](https://preview.redd.it/pav84wurgjw61.png?width=1504&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3d65ce5a266334b6f1c8a9cd3fb344509441451e)\n\nAs we can see from the 1 year chart above, Cohu seems to find support around the $40 mark for the past 6 months. Currently it's chillin out on the support line, so this indicates to me that it's a good time to purchase cohu, as I love buying dips. We can also see it's found resistance at around $50, having tested that line 3-4 times since the start of the year. I cannot say with certainty that it will break this resistance line, but I do expect it to at least check this number again some time in the next 2-3 months. My expected range for this stock in the next 3 months is between $50 and $65, which leaves room for some nice profit if one were to buy at $40. \n\nIn conclusion, cohu is a small cap in an extremely hot market. It's got some big competitors, but it holds certain key advantages over them. The financial position of the company is really good currently, and it's growth should continue for the foreseeable future. It's strongest catalyst is that semiconductor density is increasing in existing markets, and new markets are emerging with high density, which has the potential to create enormous growth. For this reason, I think COHU is a great choice. (Even if you disagree on Cohu, you will want to have some semiconductors in your portfolio for the next few years). \n\nDisclaimer: I'm holding call options on this company. \n\ncheers",
