        "selftext": "My post [last Sunday](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jmbuff/i_draw_with_crayons_so_you_dont_have_to_this/) where I talk about my positions. [On Wednesday I did a follow up](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jo3up7/4k_in_realized_gains_from_sunday_positions_next/) and discussed why I held some, closed others, and also why I opened up cash-secured-puts on QCOM right before earnings for a $450 pay-day.\n\nKeep in mind I only sell puts and buy shares. I made $4k on putting roughly $80k of collateral down for buying shares if I end up getting assigned. My true profit was about 5% last week with relatively low-risk positions where if they went against me I would bag-hold until profitable. When you are willing to bag-hold for months you literally cannot lose on any position (not financial advice). If you're ready to take your trading to the next level and do some technical ANAL(ysis) with me, then follow along. For those of you that hate money close this thread immediately.\n\nLastly, before I start. This is my game-plan for tomorrow's open. A lot depends on the price action in the morning. If market is down big or flat in the morning it will help me sell puts or buy shares, if we open hulk green then I just may need to wait. I haven't entered any of these positions yet. Normally I don't do this many positions, but it's earnings so its time to YOLO on some theta decay.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBefore we start, when you look at my charts:\n\n**PINK = CHANNEL LINES** where the stock bounces between that range. When a stock exits a channel it either:\n\n1. Comes right back down into the channel or\n\n2. Begins to form a new channel.\n\nYou will never know which option happened until after-the-fact.\n\n**BLUE = SUPPORT OR RESISTANCE LINES**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAll positions listed should be expected to expire this Friday the 13th of November. You can always go out further to collect more premium. It all depends on your strategy and what you are comfortable with.\n\n**DDOG - Earnings on Tuesday**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9quq9wx0i3y51.png?width=1964&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=91186ec0288bd562ee7a4fc31f96f4de3591efc7\n\nDDOG provides cloud-based services. They shit the bed last earnings and the stock tanked 20% the next day. Am I worried about that happening again? Of course. Do I think it will? No. They are currently trading 10% higher than they were from market-close of their last earnings call. For any of you that have been following the stock, they landed a huge deal with Microsoft and we are about to find out just how much value that contract will bring. For that reason I think it will put a hard floor on where the stock might drop to.\n\n**Positions:** \n\n$95p strike for $4.25 premium expiring this week will net you a return of about 4.5%. \n\nBreak-even only reached if stock drops to $90.75.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**RKT - Earnings on Tuesday**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1r6vebe2i3y51.png?width=1968&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9a41d32126ce49e2e91ec8b05af193af5bfd916a\n\nRKT is somewhat of a recent IPO so the stock price is all over the place. What I do see on the chart is some strong support at the $18 and $20 level. The trend is currently down, but it looks like the stock might be reversing and breaking into a new channel through earnings this week. Good earnings will rocket this stock back to $25+, poor earnings we can re-test the $20 level. I like the upside on this one relative to what the downside might be. I'll be selling puts here.\n\n**Positions:** \n\n$20p strike for $0.75 premium will have a return of 3.75%\n\nBreak-even is reached if the stock drops below $19.25\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**RVLV - Earnings on Wednesday**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dx4hk495i3y51.png?width=1954&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e262fb8fd220ac069fb0b822e6b2030c88392ec9\n\nRevolve crushed earnings on their last report and the stock went up 25%. You can see the stock has been trading in channel (pink lines) and is sitting comfortably somewhere near the high portion of the channel. Each time the stock price exited the channel to the upside it was rejected and pulled right back down. Generally it takes a break-through of the supply zones (resistance) or a big event to exit a channel and form a new trend. If we see some downside from earnings we might get a bounce off the $18 level. I'll be selling some puts there.\n\n**Positions:** \n\n$18p for $0.85 premium will have return of $4.7%\n\nBreak-even reached if the stock drops below $17.15\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**PTON - Earnings last week**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tqfvpvl6i3y51.png?width=1956&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0f4a5802a15a0769523eee117083da0b6805d19f\n\nPeloton reported earnings last week. Management summarized to us that demand was still very high and they had trouble keeping up with it. Pretty fucking solid. This stock is literally a meme, but I do think it will be bought up on any dips. IV is also pretty high so I'll be selling weekly puts at the $115 or $120 level when I get a chance.\n\n**Positions:** \n\n$120p at $2.25 premium for a return of 1.9%, break-even at $117.75\n\n$115p at $1.00 premium for a return of 0.85%, break-even at $114\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**V - Not earnings play**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ppd3x268i3y51.png?width=1836&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=58093caef63d46861d8751d5ea4826d9c69135f0\n\nVisa is one of the more predictable stocks. The dip to $180 two weeks ago was an early Christmas gift. I didn't draw any channel zones with my magical crayons here because this thing just bounces back and forth between resistance and support zones. V is currently trading at the pinnacle of the resistance line. If it gets rejected expect another dip back to $195 or even $190. If it breaks through we might see a continuation in momentum all the way up to $215. Why? We might see some follow through on last week's move. All the other times it was rejected by $200 from July through August it was on small moves and lower volume.\n\n**Positions:**\n\nIV is low on Visa, personally I would just outright buy the shares here. You can sell the weekly $210 covered call for some extra pocket money. I doubt this will break-through by end of next week and if it does you've already won on your shares.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Pro Tip:** Cash-secured-puts are a much \"safer\" way to make money. There is a misconception about selling higher volume of credit spreads instead of 1 or 2 cash-secured-puts because when you lose on a credit spread you are realizing and accepting the loss. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nListen here folks, we will NEVER accept defeat. We might lose the battle and get assigned some shares of these ultra high-quality stocks, but we will ALWAYS win the war and come out profitable. See how I am aiming here for 1-3% on each of these plays. We are winners baby so lets make that bread.",

        "selftext": "Warning: Post contains voodoo and magic line faggotry. Not Safe For Retards\n\nSo I was bored. Wife is out with her boyfriend, Cyberpunk was supposed to be out, NNN means I can't pull out my JPOW anime body pillow, etc. So with nothing to do and TSLA memes still fresh in the one crease on my silky smooth brain, I decided to read up on the dark arts (Investopedia) and this is what I unveiled.\n\nAAPL is the next TSLA.\n\nTSLA blasted off Monday after hours into new atmospheric highs. Could the voodoo have predicted this? Well let's take a [look](https://imgur.com/a/kHx0SI4). Tesla was consolidating within a pennant. Low [ADX](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/trading/07/adx-trend-indicator.asp) (lack of clear trend) and low implied volatility also suggested Tesla was laying dormant and ready to erupt. Volume was declining since the September highs verifying bullish consolidation. During the days before takeoff, volume was dead quiet, as quiet as it was in July, where it also consolidated within a astrology triangle before a bullish breakout. Then Elon launched astronauts to the ISS on Sunday, stockholders to the moon on Monday, and call holders to Mars on Tuesday. The green dildo volume spikes this week confirmed the breakout. The rise in ADX and IV confirmed this as well. Finally, [Andrew's Pitchfork](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/forex/05/andrewspitchfork.asp) (pink lines) is valid due to multiple reactions on the median and bottom line, which some autist named Andrew claims price will have an 80% chance of reaching the median of the pitchfork. In short, more magic lines screaming TSLA is going bigly up. \n\n\"Oh look now you bring up this hocus pocus bullshit after its muuned. Your retard ass could only stitch this mumbo jimbo wizardry together after the breakout.\" \n\n\"If this is legit, then why the fuck didn't you say anything earlier - you busy sucking dicks at the gloryhole?\" (they meet COVID safety standards btw)\n\n\"This is bullshit, if you knew this where are your gains? You don't earn enough flipping burgers to where you can't afford a tier 3 Pokimane sub and TSLA fds?\n\n\"This is a waste of time, you're such a gay cucktard that you make the bull on Wall Street, who's had its balls fondled everyday for decades look straight.\"\n\nOnly one of these is true. And is why I present to you all \ud83c\udf4e.\n\nApple is the girl you start dating, where after a few dates you find out she has a twin. Damn two hot girls that look exactly alike? You're a lucky man you think in your head. Then she takes you to her home for Thanksgiving and there you meet her sister, a celebrity. Her name's Tesla and she is S3XY. However, she doesn't look like the sister you're dating. She is the hottest girl you've seen and with curves all in the right places; it is no wonder why her assets bring her a massive cult following. This is when you realized you dated the wrong sister. But it's not like Apple isn't hot. Tesla is way out of your league anyways. With her beauty (stock) reaching new all time highs and her fame (IV) skyrocketing, perhaps you shouldn't chase. After all [Apple](https://imgur.com/a/bt0mJC6) is still hot right? They are twins and share [similar](https://imgur.com/a/ZaghU7R) features. \n\nApple is consolidating in a pennant. AAPL has declining volume since the September highs confirming bullish consolidation. ADX is low as well as IV. Low IV is when options (calls and puts) are typically cheap, so preferably you want to be on the buy side of option premium. Volume last week was noticeably silent marking some of the lowest traded volume this year. Simply put, AAPL looks just like TSLA two weeks ago, ready to go bigly up or bigly down.\n\nLet me tell you why Tim Apple is most likely polishing his rocket and not his drill. First, declining volume displays bullish consolidation. Second, AAPL has a valid Andrew's Pitchfork with reactions on the median and lower bound, so it has a higher likelihood of reaching the median. Third, the QQQ will print a new all time high. If SPY and IWM have printed a new all time high, whats the likelihood the monster that is Tech (up 36% YTD) would not go past its September high? Already large holdings in the Nasdaq are past the September high. For example, QCOM and particularly GOOGL. If Google can do it, why can't the rest of FANG?\n\n\"I'm scared. There's an autist here spewing shit about demonic triangles and pitchforks. All of a sudden dude starts a creepy cringe tandem about twin girls. This dipshit probably summoned a succubus with his voodoo bullshit, and gave up his soul for this shitpost\"\n\nShrooms are fucking amazing.\n\nBack to the topic. Don't forget Tim Apple and Papa Musk are basically [butt buddies](https://oracleoftime.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Elon-Musk-vs-Tim-Cook-2.jpg). When Apple said they were gonna split their stock this summer, who decided to throw his own tendie party weeks later? Now that Tesla is leaving the atmosphere to Mars, do you think Tim Apple will want to miss out?\n\n\"What will be the catalyst?\" Fuck would I know what Tim Apple is cooking. But this voodoo astrology can smell the tendies he's about to serve.\n\n\"But but the rising cases, the winter lock down, the fundament-\" Shut the fuck up. When was the last time fundamentals mattered? You gay bears like it up the ass so much, you fur fags can't shut up. Fuck the news, we'll only crash if JPOW runs out of ink and we have another liquidity crisis.\n\nI can't guarantee AAPL will be as explosive as TSLA. It's already a 2 trillion dollar company. I can't guarantee AAPL will even go up. This post is simply an argument why it is probable it will muun. But with 3 months of consolidation and eerily silent volume, Apple is gearing up for a big move that will move the markets with it.\n\nIf you actually got this far (wtf?), thank you for letting me waste your time. \n \nPositions: Well I'm fucking balls deep in GME, so this is all I could cough up. AAPL 11/27 125C. Will probably go for December/January expirations once I can get another paycheck from Wendy's.\n\nTL;DR: Yall autists clambering about those commie ass EVs being the next Tesla are missing the iRocket Tim Apple is building to join Elon on Mars. Buy calls. Or just do what you want. At the end of the day it's just magic lines right? It's fugazi. It's a whazy. It's a woozie. It's fairy dust.",

        "selftext": " So Friday we saw the stock market down again as the dow fell almost 0,6% percent while the s&amp;p fell over 1% and the nasdaq was crushed being down almost 2and a half percent as This last week we saw the dow fell 6,5% the s&amp;p 5,6% and the nasdaq 5,5% as all 3 ended the month of october down more than 2,3%\n\nOne good thing for the US economy is that the retail stores sales has recovered and consumers are still spending excess cash especially with the holidays and black Friday up next. I believe that as much as Tuesday is important for the economy, the events that will come later in the week as the FED holds two important meatings and the latest jobs report comes in at the end of the week far outweight that\n\nAs you can see the New York Federal bank economic index is still rising, that sugests a V-Shaped recovery is continuing in the US. This index takes into consideration lots of important data from the economy.\n\nThe unemployment in the US has been decling but that rate has sharply slowed down in the last months as it\u2019s still more than double the 3,5% at the start of the year as the latest number from September was almost 8% rate of unemployment.\n\nAs you can see the most affected people are still the middle and low wage under 60k/year. As the high wage jobs unemployment rate is barely down 0,5% since January.\n\nSo the fear in the stock market saw a huge pop in the last week as the VIX (the volatility index) rose from 27,55 more than 10 points to close at over 38 this last week. This next week is probably the last with such high volatility as the upcoming big events will pass and more certainty will be in front of us . The volatility was so high as we retested the June highs and have seen a pullback 3 times after hiting those levels.\n\nDespite strong earnings last week from all big tech companies (Alphabet,Amazon,Apple, facebook and Microsoft) the companies stocks dropped amid the broader stock market sell-off with the exception of Google which posted terrific numbers to crush analysts expectation.\n\nApple is down almost 19% since the highs of September and has lost 450 billion dollars in market cap since then.\n\nThis dropped in the company has been caused by a broader stock market sell off as well as missed iphone revenues. I do believe that iphone revenues will see a huge spike in the next coming quarters as apple customers as myself will finally upgrade from older iphone to this next generation iphone which is the first to have 5G technology as well as other great improvements in capability as well as camera.\n\nA couple analysts have recently changed they\u2019re target to between 132-140 which is over 20$ from where it sit\u2019s today. That is quite good upside for the company.\n\nAs you can see they are barely down 2,7% year over year in product revenue despite not having the new iphone launch included in this financials, and overall the company still saw a 1% increase in revenue due to the huge spike in services revenue that I believe will continue especially with the Apple One bundle just being launched at the end of last week. The Total Gross margin also increase slightly but I expect this to be just a small drawback in the short-term.\n\nAlso I believe that Amazon was dragged down because of the next quarter predictions of huge costs while they only forecasted a operating income of 1 to 4 point 5 billion dollars which is below what was anticipated despite amazon web services continuing to be the largest player in cloud spending. With a 32% share of total market and a revenue of 11,6 billion dollars which Is up 29% year over year, while Azure from Microsoft comes in second and google cloud in third. There is still a lot of room to grow for all of this companies as there is still over 37% of the market provided by other companies. Also this is a great company to own for the long term as digitazation and online commerce will continue to grow, some are estimating that by 2030 amazon could have annual revenues of 1 trillion dollars $ while using conservative projections of compound annual growth for e-commerce of 10%, for the cloud services of 15% and for ad revenue of 20%, amazon could hit that mark by then. But I believe this is possible even faster than that.\n\nFacebook is the one company that I will have to analyze more in this group. They will be hit with privacy issues do to the regulatory risk and Apple\u2019s announced privacy changes. But I still do believe this to be a great company as they also own Instagram, and I really like how that part of the company is innovating and growing.\n\nWhile google seems to be back on track as the company was the laggard in the group. They have become less reliant on the search ad revenue as growth in Youtube ads and Google cloud will push the company to renewed growth in the future.\n\nAlibaba will see two big events this week as they will kick off the singles day event next week, extending the event with 3 more days rather than the usual 24-hour event, in which they will also double the products on offer. Also another big event will be the IPO of ant Group in which Alibaba will still have a big stake. I believe they are a great company the forward revenue growth estimates of 31% are higher than other tech companies like amazon, google and Microsoft while the P/E for the company is the most attractive of the group also.\n\nFord just announced that late next year they will introduce a lower priced competitor for Tesla AutoPilot and GM\u2019s super cruise, this is great news for the company as they seem to be improving the company continuasly.\n\nSome important earnings coming this week are :\n\nPaypal on Monday, which I believe is the greatest fin-tech company, on\n\nWednesday Qualcomm will announce that will be a great insight to see what Apple\u2019s iphone 12 is doing as Qualcomm is the biggest supplier for apple and on Thursday Alibaba (with ant group ipo) coming also on the same day this stock could see a surge in value.",

Like I bought Cloudflare because I understand the company and I feel like their business model is strong, so it\u2019s a good option for the long run. My problem is timing. I bought it after the ER when it was around $69. It closed the day at around $64. My question is, how to find the right timing? Or does it even matter if you\u2019re planning to hold a stock for over a year?

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, November 6, 2020**\n\nStocks took a breather today, trading slightly lower after a continuous four-day rally. Market participants closely await the results of the US presidential election. The Nasdaq (QQQ) finished 0.07% up, the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) finished 0.02% down, and the Dow Jones (DIA) performed the worst, 0.26% down on the day.\n\nToday, the Labor Department released a better-than-expected October jobs report. The report shows that there were 638,000 non-farm jobs added to the economy versus the 580,000 expectation. The unemployment rate was 6.9%, compared to the 7.6% expectation (unemployment rate in September was 7.9%). The job report is surprisingly good, given the recent surge in coronavirus cases across the United States. \n\nThe US Presidential Election remains the key focal point for market participants and Wall Street. Because of the surge of mail-in ballots, three days after Election Day several key swing states, including Nevada, Georgia and Pennsylvania,  have yet to announce results. According to the Associated Press, Joe Biden has 264 electoral votes to President Trump\u2019s 214. Candidates need 270 electoral votes to win the election. As of this morning, Joe Biden took a very slim lead in Georgia and Pennsylvania and has increased his lead in Nevada. Below are the states that have been called, according to the Associated Press:\n\n* States called for Trump: Ky., W. Va., S.C., Ala., Miss., Tenn., Okla., Ark., Ind., N.D., S.D., Wyo., La., Neb. (4 of 5 electoral votes), Kan., Mo., Idaho, Utah, Ohio, Iowa, Mont., Fla., Texas\n* States called for Biden: Vt., Va., Conn., Del., Ill., Md., Mass., N.J., R.I., N.Y., N.M., D.C., Colo., N.H., Calif., Ore., Wash., Hawaii, Minn., Ariz., Maine (3 of 4 electoral votes), Wis., Mich.\n\nA win for Biden is looking increasingly likely, given he only needs to win one more of the battleground states in order to take the White House. During a press conference yesterday afternoon he said that he had \u201cno doubt\u201d that once the counting was complete he and Kamala Harris \u201cwill be declared winners.\u201d Trump, on his part, has doubled down on his calls \u201cstop the count\u201d, baselessly alleging widespread fraud during the election. His campaign has already sued multiple battleground states to challenge to ballot-counting process. A vote in Miching denied Trump\u2019s efforts. \n\nDespite some of the uncertainty still surrounding the election, stocks rallied strongly again in the immediate aftermath of Election Day. According to a number of analysts, traders like a divided government, where no single party would control each of the White House, Senate, and House of Representatives. Under that scenario, major policy changes are unlikely to get advanced.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* The US Office of Special Counsel has opened an investigation into allegations the Trump campaign violated federal law by using the White House on Election Day as a command center, according to Reuters.\n* Livent (LTHM) shares set new 52-weeks high after the positive earnings report and news of an expanded partnership with (TSLA) for lithium\n* NIO just unveiled its 100-kilowatt-hour battery and also announced battery upgrade plans at an event in Beijing, per a report by Benzinga.\n* Invesco's (QQQ) ETF of the 100 biggest Nasdaq stocks pulled in nearly $2.7B from investors on Thursday, one of its biggest single-day hauls of the year, according to data from FactSet\n* Shares of luxury e-commerce retailer Farfetch (FTCH) soared more than 11% today after it announced a partnership with Alibaba (BABA), 4.31% and Richemont (CFRUY) that includes an expansion in the Chinese market and a $600 million investment.\n* Tesla (TSLA) has added Tequila as a merchandise offering on its online store. The electric vehicle maker is taking orders for company-branded Tequila in select states in the United States.\n* Chewy (CHWY), the online pet-supply retailer, and brick-and-mortar stores such as PetSmart and PetCo will benefit from the closure of PetValu stores, Wedbush said in a note to clients on Friday.     \n* Alibaba (BABA) with target increase by Royal Bank of Canada from $300 to $335 at OUTPERFROM .

        "selftext": "Don't think I've seen too many discussions on here about Apple's new M1 based Macs - maybe i missed them when the M1 was first released.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTech reviewers are unanimously orgasming and drooling over this new ARM based Apple-designed chip because it fucking destroys Intel/AMD chips in both performance, efficiency and cost.\n\nSeriously, as a life long PC Gamer + MacBook Pro user, the stats on these new chips are amazing and I'm genuinely concerned about Intel's future in the consumer segment. How will beefier desktop versions of these chips perform with superior cooling. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe M1 chips are first generation, 'low-end' chipsets which are the first offerings from Apple for it's Mac. I think we will be blown away once again once they release their 'pro' chips for higher end machines (MBP high end, Mac Pro, iMac, etc).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCould licensing this chip technology and design out to PC manufacturers in the future be a viable new vertical for Apple (would this make sense for them to do? It's a solid XX-XXX digit $Billion TAM) Most other PCs can't fully utilize ARM chips because Windows is a POS. Apple is in the unique position to control every aspect of product design so it make sense that they've been able to come out with a laptop generation which is the largest leap in price/performance in recent history.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJust some anecdotal tweets I read\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/56g6n19tzb061.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1cf4e0f6d0e794ce9e1c800a31ad5987e87b1d26\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gvnhc9gv0c061.png?width=596&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f7bd74f8ec1da9a72a0813c9ddcef121213ec67f\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ln7u0mpa1c061.png?width=619&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=465d7fa8926293c426ad533a00dce0a0caf21baa\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSeriously wtf, this chip out performs the top spec Intel chip from last year in REAL WORLD APPLICATIONS to an insane degree. When a sub $1400 M1 MacBook Air can run laps around a $6000 2019 16inch Intel MacBook Pro, you know Intel is truly fucked.\n\nNow in terms of $AAPL, obviously this hasn't affected the stock at all because Macs are now such a small % of their business. I think that the Mac/iPad segment is going to start to see growth once again when the true potential of the new chipset is realized and discovered by the market. Potentially they can start selling these chips to OEMs in a few years time? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso where are all the Windows peasants who spam comments about how Apple hardware is overpriced and doesn't perform as well as similarly priced Windows machines.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLinks:\n\n[https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21574057/apple-m1-chips-laptop-performance-intel-qualcomm-competition](https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21574057/apple-m1-chips-laptop-performance-intel-qualcomm-competition)\n\n[https://www.theverge.com/21570497/apple-macbook-pro-2020-m1-review](https://www.theverge.com/21570497/apple-macbook-pro-2020-m1-review)\n\n[https://www.anandtech.com/tag/apple-m1](https://www.anandtech.com/tag/apple-m1)\n\n[https://9to5mac.com/2020/11/11/macbook-air-with-m1-chip-beats-16-inch-macbook-pro-performance-in-benchmark-test/](https://9to5mac.com/2020/11/11/macbook-air-with-m1-chip-beats-16-inch-macbook-pro-performance-in-benchmark-test/)\n\n[https://twitter.com/twostraws/status/1328704598962565122](https://twitter.com/twostraws/status/1328704598962565122)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPositions: long AF AAPL for life, INTEL AMD NVIDIA WATCHOUT",

        "selftext": "**TLDR:**\n\nIn one sentence a TML is an institutional quality stock in a leading industry group with superior fundamentals and technicals. These are monster stocks which over the course of weeks and months increase +100% to +5,000% . These stocks are disruptors which change how we work, live, or play.\n\nTMLs are popular with traders/investors whose methodology is based on the CANSLIM system developed by William O'Neil. He called them Model Book Stocks. Huge winners worth studying to identify common characteristics that they all share  O'Neil studied over 1000 model book stocks going back to the 1880s. Many are shown and discussed in these must read books\n\n* How To Make Money in Stocks, William O'Neil\n*  Monster Stocks: How They Set Up, Run Up, Top and Make You Money , John Boik\n* The Lifecycle Trade: How to Win at Trading IPOs and Super Growth Stocks, Eric Krull, Kathy Donnelly, and Kurt Dail \n\n**A few Historical Examples** from William O'Neil's How To Find &amp; Own America's Greatest Opportunities\n\nApple 2003  [https://imgur.com/2Egn9z5](https://imgur.com/2Egn9z5)\n\nNetflix 2009 [https://imgur.com/BHCtJpo](https://imgur.com/BHCtJpo)\n\nHome Depot 1982 [https://imgur.com/tBU3JgU](https://imgur.com/tBU3JgU)\n\nQualcomm 1997 [https://imgur.com/oYPItOW](https://imgur.com/oYPItOW)\n\nYahoo 1996 [https://imgur.com/ToOxnQJ](https://imgur.com/ToOxnQJ)\n\n**So what are the Fundamental characteristics of a TML? You want to see superior:**\n\n* Quarterly Sales Growth &gt; 25% YoY\n* Quarterly Earnings Growth &gt; 25% YoY\n* Pre+After Tax Margins &gt;20% Recent Quarters\n* ROE &gt;17%\n* Annual Earnings Ests for the next year &gt; 25%\n\nAnd above all else you want the stock to have a great story- A new and innovative product or service  that changes how we work live or play. Not every TML will have all of these criteria, but in general their record should be outstanding with regards to most of them. The higher these values the better. Earnings and Sales growth over 100% YoY is ideal. Annual Estimates for next year over 100% would be exceptional.\n\nTMLs are also often in the Top 20 Industry groups at the times of their runs. The TML is the leader of an overall top group which is riding the tailwinds of changing environments. Recent examples $SE $SHOP $AMZN Retail-Internet and $TSLA $NIO Electric Vehicles (Auto Manufacturers)\n\nAdditionally base liquidity is required for these stocks to be institutional quality. Dollar Volume &gt; $30 Million is essential and most should have DV much higher than that. Accumulation by big hedge funds and mutual funds like Fidelity Contrafund are what move the markets. They won't touch a promising stock unless it has liquidity.\n\n**Now for Technical (Price Action) Characteristics of TMLs.**\n\nThey should be:\n\n* Above a Rising 30 Week Moving Average\n* Breaking out of a Stage 1 or Stage 2 Base\n* Trending above Key Moving Averages (10, 21ema, 50sma)\n* Volume and Price contractions within bases\n* Up/Down Vol&gt; 1.2\n* Huge gaps up on volume after Earning Beat\n* And most importantly they must be showing Relative Strength, meaning they are outperforming the vast majority of stocks in the market. This. is. vital.\n\nDuring corrections and overall market weakness they should be near all time highs, above their longer term moving averages.  They should be standing out like a sore thumb and yelling \"Buy me\".  And during Market Uptrends they should be trending above the shorter term moving averages, forming sideways price shelfs during small pullbacks and then breaking out again. Most stay above their 50 SMAs and even 21 emas for extended periods of time.\n\n**So how to scan for them:**\n\nUse MarketSmith, the IBD Stock Screener, Finviz, or another screener and screen for the fundamental criteria mentioned above combined with the stock over the 200+50 SMA.  It's helpful to have multiple screens splitting up the criteria for instance one scan for the earnings and one for sales.\n\nHere is an example Finviz TML Scan: [https://imgur.com/a/CzwHdM8](https://imgur.com/a/CzwHdM8)\n\n**Recent examples to study**\n\n$LVGO 2020  \n$TSLA 2019-2020  \n$DOCU 2019-2020  \n$PTON 2020  \n$SHOP 2016-2020  \n$AMD 2018  \n$ZM 2020",

        "selftext": "Alright my fellow tards and degenerates.\n\nSo as the new year comes we\u2019re moving into the 5g era and all of you know that the phone companies will make bank and 5g will basically become standard. However money won\u2019t only be made by investing in these companies, money will also be made behind the scenes.\n\nFirst of all how are we supposed to use 5G if there are no 5G towers?? That\u2019s where NOK and ERIC come in, these are some of the top 5G manufacturers. NOK is not a dead company, while in 2000 they were selling phones made out of adamantium or some shit, now they\u2019re acquiring hella patents for 5G Now becoming the 2nd largest 5G manufacturer. \n\nThink of the wars, who came out on top? USA? No, the gun manufacturers came up on top, they made some fucking money selling weapons and with the era of 5G coming up do you want to be battling whether the iPhone 13 is better than the Galaxy S or do you wanna make some fucking money.\n\nWith huaweii out of the picture by being banned basically everywhere it\u2019s gonna be up to QCOM, NOK, and ERIC to fill most of the 5G demands. All of these companies have contracts lined up for 5G such as NOK and TU.\n\nWhy this is such  a good play right now??? NOK and ERIC  have 2022/2023 dated calls for less than an ask price of .9, this play is a no fucking brainer. Especially for NOK which has an upward potential of 50% gain. The opportunity cost is so fucking low I could shit a banana worth more.\n\nSpend 80$ on a LONG dated contract and what do you have to lose vs gain. Potential for gain is a lot greater than what you have to lose.\n\nHell idc if you inverse me but there is money to be mad on these stocks either fucking way. NOK is up 5% in the past 5 days get in while calls are piss cheap.\n\nIdk about you guys but I\u2019m here to make some fucking money, so for this new tech war on 5G where do you want to be? Do you want to be a soldier in line waiting to receive your new phone or do you want to be the mastermind that owns the WHOLE fucking fleet.\n\nTLDR: \n\nNOK 01/21/22 4c\nNOK 01/22/22 5c\nNOK 01/20/23 5c\nERIC 01/21/22 15c",

        "selftext": "Remember BlackBerry, the phone with the cool keyboard that went out of fashion? Well they haven't made phones in years.\n\nBB is a **cybersecurity &amp; software company** with the wrong name!\n\nThink embedded systems, data privacy, safety, endpoint security management, encryption, IoT, AI, zero trust architecture and so on. And think EV and AV (autonomous vehicles), too, where they have had a significant presence and continue to grow.\n\nLet me paint the picture for you with some recent headlines:\n\n* [BlackBerry Achieves NSA Approval for BlackBerry UEM](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/blackberry-achieves-nsa-approval-blackberry-130000862.html) (11/18/20)\n* [Plus Chooses BlackBerry to Power Its Class 8 Truck Automated Driving System First Self-Driving Truck Developer to Leverage Safety-Certified BlackBerry QNX Operating System](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/plus-chooses-blackberry-power-class-130000001.html) (11/17/20)\n* [BlackBerry AtHoc Integrates with Microsoft Teams for Critical Event Management](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/blackberry-athoc-integrates-microsoft-teams-123000549.html) (10/7/20)\n* [BlackBerry AtHoc and ServiceNow Partner to Deliver Secure and Reliable Incident Response Management](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/blackberry-athoc-servicenow-partner-deliver-120000305.html) (10/8/20)\n* [BlackBerry Unveils Industry's First Unified Endpoint Security (UES) Solution for AI-powered Cybersecurity](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/blackberry-unveils-industrys-first-unified-120000258.html) (10/6/20)\n* [The United States Air Force Chooses BlackBerry Spark for Secure Productivity](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/united-states-air-force-chooses-120000017.html) (9/22/20)\n\nDoes this sounds like a phone manufacturer? Heck no!\n\nAnd talk about being in the sweet spot. BlackBerry's flagship software, QNX, is embedded in more than 175 million cars, making it a foundational software platform for connected and autonomous vehicles. Just look at some of these names that BB can count as customers in the automotive space:\n\n* Audi\n* BMW\n* Mercedes-Benz\n* Toyota\n* ARCFOX\n* Xpeng\n* Desay\n* Canoo (yes, the EV maker merging into HCAC)\n* Plus Self-Driving Trucks\n* Arrival (yes, the EV company merging into CIIC)\n* Jaguar Land Rover\n* Damon Motorcycles\n* Elektrobit\n* Karma Automotive\n* Tata\n\nAnd on and on...\n\nQNX is amazing, but there's more (and zero phones!)\n\n**List of better known products**\n\n*QNX*\nA real-time embedded operating system, QNX drives multiple software systems in modern auto vehicles, and forms the basis of solutions like BlackBerry Radar, an IoT-based asset tracking system for the transportation industry. \n\n*Spark Suites*\nSpark offers visibility and protection across all endpoints, including personal laptops and smartphones used for work. It leverages AI, machine learning and automation to provide improved cyber threat prevention. \n\n*AtHoc*\nAn emergency communication system, AtHoc provides two-way messaging and notifications across a range of devices and platforms.\n\n*Unified Endpoint Manager (UEM)*\nAn enterprise mobility management platform that provides provisional and access control over smartphones, tablets, laptops, and desktops with support for all major platforms including iOS, Android (including Android for Work and Samsung KNOX), BlackBerry 10, Windows 10, and Mac OS.\n\n*SecuSUITE*\nAn anti-eavesdropping solution that provides voice, data, and SMS encryption.\n\nWant to see more? Check out all products here: [https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/products/all-products](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/products/all-products)\n\n**Patents, patents and more patents!**\n\nBB has 38K+ patents! They have been actively protecting them when they've been infringed upon.\n\nFor example, in 2017, BB was awarded a staggering $940,000,000 in overpayments of royalty payments against Qualcomm.\n\nAnd for FB haters (count me in!) BB sued Facebook (along with WhatsApp and Instagram) in 2018, alleging that many critical features of the Facebook messaging service infringe on Blackberry patents. In the past two weeks Facebook LOST their challenge to the mobile messaging patent lawsuit in a final decision, paving the way toward a settlement for 'rent due' for use. Time to pay up, Zuck!!\n\n**Recent refinancing &amp; the Importance of $6**\n\nIn late summer this year Blackberry entered into a convertible financing with a pre-existing large shareholder for $365MM. The Debentures are convertible at $6 and would effectively bring this shareholder's exposure on a fully converted basis to just under 20% ownership.\n\nThe shareholder would then be fully aligned with minority shareholders, thus causing support at the $6 level going forward.\n\n**Stock &amp; Valuation**\n\n* Stock closed at $5.91 on Wednesday (a six month high)\n* The stock is trading 14% below its 52 week high of $6.89\n* It's trading above its 50 and 200 DMA\n\nMarket cap: $3.21B\nRevenue: $1.01B\nPrice/Sales: 3.3x\n\nFloat: 502MM\nShares short: 30MM (11/13/20)\n\nThe best known publicly traded competitor in the connected &amp; autonomous vehicle software space is Cerence.\n\nCRNC (Cerence)\n* Market cap: $3.24B\n* Revenue: $329MM\n* Price/Sales: 9.58x\n\nThe best known publicly traded competitors in cybersecurity are:\n\nCRWD (Crowdstrike)\n* Market cap: $31.98B\n* Revenue: $654MM\n* Price/Sales: 40.43x\n\nFTNT (Fortinet)\n* Market cap: $19.17B\n* Revenue: $2.46B\n* Price/Sales: 8.18x\n\nPANW (Palo Alto Networks)\n* Market cap: $28.19B\n* Revenue: $3.58B\n* Price/Sales: 7.98x\n\nFEYE (FireEye)\n* Market cap: $3.24B\n* Revenue: $928MM\n* Price/Sales: 3.37x\n\nTaking out the richly valued CRWD and weakly valued FEYE leaves a combination of CRNC, FTNT and PANW to measure where BB stacks up. The average P/S of those three is 8.58x, whereas BB's P/S is 3.3x. This means that BB's P/S should float up to their level just to be in line with peers.\n\nThat would bring the stock price to just over $15, all else equal.\n\nWe are at the critical $6 level today.\n\n** Positions ** \n\n200 $10 1/22 calls!",

So, I have deposited and invested in the stock market all the money I managed to save up in the last month as I deposited 3500$ in my eToro portfolio on the 12th of November and I am already up more than 7% in just two weeks. \n\nAs my portfolio has constantly outperform the big 3 indexes the Nasdaq100, the SP500 and the Dow Jones 30 almost every day since starting my portfolio. Here is a comparison of my portfolio vs the indexes since starting as I am up over 7%. [Portfolio v Index](https://ibb.co/pRnQLQf)\n\nSo i wondered? Is it really bad to own more stocks? Is less &gt; more? What is your opinion on this subject? I believe that it is way better to be invested in more companies and to add and grow your position in time as you also see how the companies evolve and you can also do some price averaging.\n\nSo here is my current portfolio composition as I split all my money equally to start, I will go into very few little details about everyone so I don\u2019t make this a 2 hour read time.\n\nI will start now by going alphabetically and not in the most important order as the first company that I own is BYD which is a rival company for both Tesla and NIO in the EV market as they focus on cars, new energy solutions and electronics. They are also developing a lot of commercial EV like buses, coaches and taxis which will be a great addressable market for them as they are not rivaled in those segments at the moment. The company has gone up a lot in value this year as you can see in this graph and have a Forward P/E of more than 100 but I believe this company will greatly expand its sales and be one of the leaders in the segment especially in China which is the biggest EV market.

They are the biggest company in the world and they continue to expand with new products and services every day, I don\u2019t see this company going down in the short term or the long term as they have pretty expensive at a 35 P/E but earnings are still rising especially with more subscription based income coming in with the release of the Apple One Bundle.

[https://ibb.co/CVXgZD9](https://ibb.co/CVXgZD9) / [https://ibb.co/BPKxFfZ](https://ibb.co/BPKxFfZ)\n\nWal-Mart, the biggest employer in the US continues to do amazing stuff as they continue to expand they\u2019re online presence and compete with Amazon as they trade at a 23 P/E and also offer a dividend yield. they are a great play alongside with Amazon which trades at much higher valuations. [https://ibb.co/Sr9s83J](https://ibb.co/Sr9s83J) / [https://ibb.co/0CvZKkD](https://ibb.co/0CvZKkD)\n\nWynn is another great recovery stock that I like as recently we found out that foot traffic in Macau has ramped up, this bolds well for the company as they will be one of the biggest gainers on the reopening. So if you are a long term investor you should get into this stock I believe. [https://ibb.co/6rk2qNQ](https://ibb.co/6rk2qNQ) / [https://ibb.co/mC35VPr](https://ibb.co/mC35VPr)\n\nZoom is the one company that I will be selling in the next couple of days. I know they are one of the best video conferencing apps out there, but I believe they will have a lot of problem due to a number of free apps that also offer great quality while the company is trading at insane p/e numbers. I know this trend is here to stay, but I thing there are far better play in the stock market out there rather than Zoom at this price point.  [https://ibb.co/T1tStb8](https://ibb.co/T1tStb8) / [https://ibb.co/rmxh0x3](https://ibb.co/rmxh0x3)\n\nI know I didn\u2019t get into in-depth stuff, technical analysis, fundamentals and more but I will continue go more in depth with this stocks as time goes on. \n\nSo here how I want to make my portfolio look like when I have enough money to open all the positions. [TARGETED PORTFOLIo](https://ibb.co/CHWsb27)\n\nAs you can see a quarter of my portfolio will be invested in high quality companies that are pretty safe in my opinion. While over 45% of the portfolio will go to companies that I really like, that have a pretty low risk in my opinion and can offer great returns in the future. While I will also use about 22% of my portfolio into more risky companies that can bring very good profits for the portfolio but in my opinion are not as safe as the others. \n\nAnd finally I will invest about 7% of my portfolio into more speculative stocks or hedge stocks like Barrick Gold and Goldman Sachs. I don\u2019t want to keep money on the sidelines at the moment as I expect the stock market will keep rising for a couple of years at a rapid pace due to the recovery of the economy.\n\nThank you everyone for reading!

        "selftext": "**In this post I am going to share my experience as I start a new portfolio from 0$ and keep adding funds to it every month as I try to grow it as fast as possible**\n\nHey everyone Happy Thanksgiving and Welcome! So, I have deposited and invested in the stock market all the money I managed to save up in the last month as I deposited 3500$ in my eToro portfolio on the 12th of November and I am already up more than 7% in just two weeks. \n\nAs my portfolio has constantly outperform the big 3 indexes the Nasdaq100, the SP500 and the Dow Jones 30 almost every day since starting my portfolio. Here is a comparison of my portfolio vs the indexes since starting as I am up over 7%. [Portfolio v Index](https://ibb.co/pRnQLQf)\n\nSo i wondered? Is it really bad to own more stocks? Is less &gt; more? What is your opinion on this subject? I believe that it is way better to be invested in more companies and to add and grow your position in time as you also see how the companies evolve and you can also do some price averaging.\n\nSo here is my current portfolio composition as I split all my money equally to start, I will go into very few little details about everyone so I don\u2019t make this a 2 hour read time.\n\nI will start now by going alphabetically and not in the most important order as the first company that I own is BYD which is a rival company for both Tesla and NIO in the EV market as they focus on cars, new energy solutions and electronics. They are also developing a lot of commercial EV like buses, coaches and taxis which will be a great addressable market for them as they are not rivaled in those segments at the moment. The company has gone up a lot in value this year as you can see in this graph and have a Forward P/E of more than 100 but I believe this company will greatly expand its sales and be one of the leaders in the segment especially in China which is the biggest EV market.

They are the biggest company in the world and they continue to expand with new products and services every day, I don\u2019t see this company going down in the short term or the long term as they have pretty expensive at a 35 P/E but earnings are still rising especially with more subscription based income coming in with the release of the Apple One Bundle.

[TARGETED PORTFOLIo](https://ibb.co/CHWsb27)\n\nAs you can see a quarter of my portfolio will be invested in high quality companies that are pretty safe in my opinion. While over 45% of the portfolio will go to companies that I really like, that have a pretty low risk in my opinion and can offer great returns in the future. While I will also use about 22% of my portfolio into more risky companies that can bring very good profits for the portfolio but in my opinion are not as safe as the others. \n\nAnd finally I will invest about 7% of my portfolio into more speculative stocks or hedge stocks like Barrick Gold and Goldman Sachs. I don\u2019t want to keep money on the sidelines at the moment as I expect the stock market will keep rising for a couple of years at a rapid pace due to the recovery of the economy.\n\nThank you everyone for reading!

        "selftext": "**In this post we\u2019ll talk about what happened last week in the stock market and what to expect this week as earnings season is coming to an end**\n\n[THUMB](https://ibb.co/j64rkG0)\n\nHey everyone and Welcome, so let\u2019s start with a recap of Friday\u2019s movements in the stock market and what happened last week as we saw the Dow finishing Friday up 1,37% [CHART](https://ibb.co/HHPdbR9), the S&amp;P500 up almost the same while closing at a record level for the index [CHART](https://ibb.co/HTG25s0) and the Nasdaq composite being up just over 1% [CHART](https://ibb.co/274Gq6g).\n\nAlmost 80% of companies were advancing on Friday as the stock market finished the week strong with an almost 90% ratio of new highs vs lows but the volume was way below average on Friday as most investors finished restructuring they\u2019re portfolios in the early part of the week after the Vaccine news [CHART](https://ibb.co/sbn5dWp).\n\nAlso this week we saw the largest ever global equity inflow as you can see in this Bank of American chart as there were over 40 billion dollars being pushed in equities. [CHART](https://ibb.co/18g7xrJ)\n\nAll sectors finished in the green on Friday with real estate, energy and industrial leading the way with all 3 sectors having more than 50% of companies up over 2%, even tech kept up the pace after leading us through this recovery with over 37% of companies being up more than 2% on the day.\n\nWe also saw small-cap and value plays outperform again as people are betting that the economy will have a broader breadth of recovery after the vaccine will be available. [CHART](https://ibb.co/jTMx5ry)\n\nThe VIX also finished the week very strong as it continued to decline to it\u2019s lowest level, ending the week at the 23 level. [CHART](https://ibb.co/j4057B8)\n\nAs you can see in both the SP500 heat map [CHART](https://ibb.co/dW01vyR) and the world heat map  [CHART](https://ibb.co/G2Fvk7c) almost all companies were in the green on Friday with a few exceptions like Nvidia, NetFlix and Alibaba, as they were punished a little after the huge run they in the last 9 months while Alibaba continues to struggle with the Chinese government.\n\nThe COVID-19 numbers are dangerously going up as you can see, with daily cases going parabolic, indeed with a bigger number of tests being taken but there is still a huge rise in positivity rate, and as you can see this is the 3rd hump of the pandemic in terms of numbers of hospitalized people. The one positive thing for the moment is that deaths haven\u2019t gone up as much due to the better treatment but this number does usually trail the others so we will have to see what happens in the next weeks. [CHART](https://ibb.co/wdSTt4v)\n\nHere you can see better that weekly test are up almost 10% while weekly cases have gone up 4times that much almost at a 40% growth rate while the hospitalized and deaths have not increased as much as the cases yet. [CHART](https://ibb.co/QpzPbs8)\n\nThis weeks interesting earnings [EARNINGS](https://ibb.co/K5bMM4B) in my opinion will come from Walmart and Home Depot before the open on Tuesday as I expect both of them to dazzle in the earnings reports, while Walmart is expected to have an EPS of 1$ and 19 cents I expect them to be around 1,5$ at least like last quarter while Home depot is expected to have an EPS of just over 3$ I expect that to be at least 30cents to half a $ better then expected also as the companies look to continue the amazing earnings season that is mostly ending this week as we saw an overwhelming number of companies beating the estimates by quite a gap.\n\nThis will be followed after the close with the Concept company NIO which has been going up amazingly in the last weeks as it has touched even 54$ but has since seen a pullback of almost 10$, so be careful when trading this, it may be a bumpy ride as the company is still losing money and seeking to increase manufacturing and sales, as I don\u2019t see them having to much of a success in Europe even if the manage to launch they\u2019re cars there, this because people will have a stigma for the company as being Chinese, and not offering great quality. Despite the recent Chinese movements some good news came in on Sunday as China has formed the largest free trade block that includes fifteen Asia-Pacific Economies with big names like Japan, South Korea, Australia and others being included [NEWS](https://ibb.co/XbcqV80). This group will account for 30% of the global economy and population. This will probably bold well for NIO as it has tanked after Citron released a statement that they are taking profits in NIO [NEWS](https://ibb.co/SQBbW6s).\n\nMoving on Wednesday we will also get some other retailers reports with Target and Lowe\u2019s releasing reports also before the open. I believe this two will be impacted by what Walmart and Home Depot announce, if they have great results expect them the stocks to see a double move on Tuesday and Wednesday. Also, one of the biggest gainer of the stay at home moves, nVidia, will report after the close as I expect them do have great earnings again as they will continue to benefit a lot from the stay-at-home economy as October videogame sales were up 14% expect this also be translated into Nvidia\u2019s earnings as this was the month before the new consoles from Microsoft and Sony were released. [NVIDIA NEWS](https://ibb.co/kK3WWj4)\n\nSo I really like all 3 of Home Depot, Walmart and Nvidia and if you want to make a gamble you can also make a small investment in Nio, as there are no other big catalysts at the moment earnings may impact the stocks and we can see a re-test of highs for all of them.\n\nOne other company that I will keep my eye on is Disney as they beat the expectations for earnings, revenue and subscriber for the streaming business, I will watch what updates the investors meeting in December will provide us, as I really like the company and the stock very much, if they want to keep this going and become a rival for NetFlix they do have to invest much more money in content, as they will have to keep providing new content that generates growth for Disney+. [NEWS](https://ibb.co/QNCc3D3)\n\nSome other news from the last days are that Qualcomm has received an exemption to sell chips to Huawei, which is not was expected that they would be allowed to sell 5G chips, but still is good news for the company as it provides another buyer for its products. [NEWS](https://ibb.co/ZVp8gTw)\n\nWhile DraftKings soared on Friday after they announced better than expected results and guidance for the future. [NEWS](https://ibb.co/qy9vmyB)\n\nThis came alongside the filing of documents for the hugely anticipated of DoorDash the leader in food delivery with a 50% market share.

        "selftext": "Sup my stockbros. Sunday eve I [posted my plays](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jmbuff/i_draw_with_crayons_so_you_dont_have_to_this/) for the week and opened those positions Monday morning. Sitting on about $4k profits which I've closed out some and may or may not let the others ride out for a few additional percentage points. Think I might take out your wife for some nice lobster and then to pound-town to finish off a good week. My next play is absolutely free money and literally wont go tits up.\n\n**Weekend Plays**\n\nCRM - Salesforce: 100 shares @ $237 cost basis. Currently $251 per share and 6% profit or $1,400.\n\nDOCU: Sold 2x cash secured puts for $1,700 and closed them out this morning at $272 for $1,400 gain.\n\nJD: Sold 2x CSP for $640. Up $400 and will let the rest ride.\n\nPYPL: Sold 3x CSP for earnings and closed yesterday at $600 profit when the stock was flat in the morning.\n\nThese plays had minimal risk since the stocks would need to drop another 5-10% for me to be assigned. I knew mango man had my back and wouldn't let me down. Positions -Yes I'm using all the margin and buying power my account has to offer, but if I could use more I would since this put-selling is pretty fucking hard to fail at. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g4tss1y23ax51.jpg?width=1125&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4f0c4b547ee537007b8bed7e738750ef5fe19f1d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Next earnings YOLO - QCOM**\n\nIt doesn't matter if you know what QCOM does or doesn't do. The only thing you need to know is that it's a solid company that has absolutely m00ned over the last 6 months. I entered a earnings YOLO selling yet more puts expiring this fucking friday. You might think selling puts is some pussy shit, but if you hate money then definitely don't do this.\n\nPOSITIONS: 2x cash-secured puts sold at $124 strike price collecting $440 US-DOLLARS. Expiring this Friday just in time for lobster and doing some ANALysis with your wife on the weekend.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7jlo5ys14ax51.jpg?width=992&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=264d869879fde2a8643ee49dd64b8c5ce5c715b9",

        "selftext": " \n\n**TLDR:**\n\nIn one sentence a TML is an institutional quality stock in a leading industry group with superior fundamentals and technicals. These are monster stocks which over the course of weeks and months increase +100% to +5,000% . These stocks are disruptors which change how we work, live, or play.\n\nTMLs are popular with traders/investors whose methodology is based on the CANSLIM system developed by William O'Neil. He called them Model Book Stocks. Huge winners worth studying to identify common characteristics that they all share O'Neil studied over 1000 model book stocks going back to the 1880s. Many are shown and discussed in these must read books\n\n* How To Make Money in Stocks, William O'Neil\n* Monster Stocks: How They Set Up, Run Up, Top and Make You Money , John Boik\n* The Lifecycle Trade: How to Win at Trading IPOs and Super Growth Stocks, Eric Krull, Kathy Donnelly, and Kurt Dail\n\n**A few Historical Examples** from William O'Neil's How To Find &amp; Own America's Greatest Opportunities\n\nApple 2003 [https://imgur.com/2Egn9z5](https://imgur.com/2Egn9z5)\n\nNetflix 2009 [https://imgur.com/BHCtJpo](https://imgur.com/BHCtJpo)\n\nHome Depot 1982 [https://imgur.com/tBU3JgU](https://imgur.com/tBU3JgU)\n\nQualcomm 1997 [https://imgur.com/oYPItOW](https://imgur.com/oYPItOW)\n\nYahoo 1996 [https://imgur.com/ToOxnQJ](https://imgur.com/ToOxnQJ)\n\n**So what are the Fundamental characteristics of a TML? You want to see superior:**\n\n* Quarterly Sales Growth &gt; 25% YoY\n* Quarterly Earnings Growth &gt; 25% YoY\n* Pre+After Tax Margins &gt;20% Recent Quarters\n* ROE &gt;17%\n* Annual Earnings Ests for the next year &gt; 25%\n\nAnd above all else you want the stock to have a great story- A new and innovative product or service that changes how we work live or play. Not every TML will have all of these criteria, but in general their record should be outstanding with regards to most of them. The higher these values the better. Earnings and Sales growth over 100% YoY is ideal. Annual Estimates for next year over 100% would be exceptional.\n\nTMLs are also often in the Top 20 Industry groups at the times of their runs. The TML is the leader of an overall top group which is riding the tailwinds of changing environments. Recent examples $SE $SHOP $AMZN Retail-Internet and $TSLA $NIO Electric Vehicles (Auto Manufacturers)\n\nAdditionally base liquidity is required for these stocks to be institutional quality. Dollar Volume &gt; $30 Million is essential and most should have DV much higher than that. Accumulation by big hedge funds and mutual funds like Fidelity Contrafund are what move the markets. They won't touch a promising stock unless it has liquidity.\n\n**Now for Technical (Price Action) Characteristics of TMLs.**\n\nThey should be:\n\n* Above a Rising 30 Week Moving Average\n* Breaking out of a Stage 1 or Stage 2 Base\n* Trending above Key Moving Averages (10, 21ema, 50sma)\n* Volume and Price contractions within bases\n* Up/Down Vol&gt; 1.2\n* Huge gaps up on volume after Earning Beat\n* And most importantly they must be showing Relative Strength, meaning they are outperforming the vast majority of stocks in the market. This. is. vital.\n\nDuring corrections and overall market weakness they should be near all time highs, above their longer term moving averages. They should be standing out like a sore thumb and yelling \"Buy me\". And during Market Uptrends they should be trending above the shorter term moving averages, forming sideways price shelfs during small pullbacks and then breaking out again. Most stay above their 50 SMAs and even 21 emas for extended periods of time.\n\n**So how to scan for them:**\n\nUse MarketSmith, the IBD Stock Screener, Finviz, or another screener and screen for the fundamental criteria mentioned above combined with the stock over the 200+50 SMA. It's helpful to have multiple screens splitting up the criteria for instance one scan for the earnings and one for sales.\n\nHere is an example Finviz TML Scan: [https://imgur.com/a/CzwHdM8](https://imgur.com/a/CzwHdM8)\n\n**Recent examples to study**\n\n$LVGO 2020  \n$TSLA 2019-2020  \n$DOCU 2019-2020  \n$PTON 2020  \n$SHOP 2016-2020  \n$AMD 2018  \n$ZM 2020",

Wife is out with her boyfriend, Cyberpunk was supposed to be out, NNN means I can't pull out my JPOW anime body pillow, etc. So with nothing to do and TSLA memes still fresh in the one crease on my silky smooth brain, I decided to read up on the dark arts (Investopedia) and this is what I unveiled.\n\nAAPL is the next TSLA.\n\nTSLA blasted off Monday after hours into new atmospheric highs. Could the voodoo have predicted this? Well let's take a [look](https://imgur.com/a/kHx0SI4). Tesla was consolidating within a pennant. Low [ADX](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/trading/07/adx-trend-indicator.asp) (lack of clear trend) and low implied volatility also suggested Tesla was laying dormant and ready to erupt. Volume was declining since the September highs verifying bullish consolidation. During the days before takeoff, volume was dead quiet, as quiet as it was in July, where it also consolidated within a astrology triangle before a bullish breakout. Then Elon launched astronauts to the ISS on Sunday, stockholders to the moon on Monday, and call holders to Mars on Tuesday. The green dildo volume spikes this week confirmed the breakout. The rise in ADX and IV confirmed this as well. Finally, [Andrew's Pitchfork](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/forex/05/andrewspitchfork.asp) (pink lines) is valid due to multiple reactions on the median and bottom line, which some autist named Andrew claims price will have an 80% chance of reaching the median of the pitchfork. In short, more magic lines screaming TSLA is going bigly up. \n\n\"Oh look now you bring up this hocus pocus bullshit after its muuned. Your retard ass could only stitch this mumbo jimbo wizardry together after the breakout.\" \n\n\"If this is legit, then why the fuck didn't you say anything earlier - you busy sucking dicks at the gloryhole?\" (they meet COVID safety standards btw)\n\n\"This is bullshit, if you knew this where are your gains? You don't earn enough flipping burgers to where you can't afford a tier 3 Pokimane sub and TSLA fds?\n\n\"This is a waste of time, you're such a gay cucktard that you make the bull on Wall Street, who's had its balls fondled everyday for decades look straight.\"\n\nOnly one of these is true. And is why I present to you all \ud83c\udf4e.\n\nApple is the girl you start dating, where after a few dates you find out she has a twin. Damn two hot girls that look exactly alike? You're a lucky man you think in your head. Then she takes you to her home for Thanksgiving and there you meet her sister, a celebrity. Her name's Tesla and she is S3XY. However, she doesn't look like the sister you're dating. She is the hottest girl you've seen and with curves all in the right places; it is no wonder why her assets bring her a massive cult following. This is when you realized you dated the wrong sister. But it's not like Apple isn't hot. Tesla is way out of your league anyways. With her beauty (stock) reaching new all time highs and her fame (IV) skyrocketing, perhaps you shouldn't chase. After all [Apple](https://imgur.com/a/bt0mJC6) is still hot right? They are twins and share similar features. \n\nApple is consolidating in a pennant. AAPL has declining volume since the September highs confirming bullish consolidation. ADX is low as well as IV. Low IV is when options (calls and puts) are typically cheap, so preferably you want to be on the buy side of option premium. Volume last week was noticeably silent marking some of the lowest traded volume this year. Simply put, AAPL looks just like TSLA two weeks ago, ready to go bigly up or bigly down.\n\nLet me tell you why Tim Apple is most likely polishing his rocket and not his drill. First, declining volume displays bullish consolidation. Second, AAPL has a valid Andrew's Pitchfork with reactions on the median and lower bound, so it has a higher likelihood of reaching the median. Third, the QQQ will print a new all time high. If SPY and IWM have printed a new all time high, whats the likelihood the monster that is Tech (up 36% YTD) would not go past its September high? Already large holdings in the Nasdaq are past the September high. For example, QCOM and particularly GOOGL. If Google can do it, why can't the rest of FANG?\n\n\"I'm scared. There's an autist here spewing shit about demonic triangles and pitchforks. All of a sudden dude starts a creepy cringe tandem about twin girls. This dipshit probably summoned a succubus with his voodoo bullshit, and gave up his soul for this DD\"\n\nShrooms are fucking amazing.\n\nBack to the topic. Don't forget Tim Apple and Papa Musk are basically [butt buddies](https://oracleoftime.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Elon-Musk-vs-Tim-Cook-2.jpg). When Apple said they were gonna split their stock this summer, who decided to throw his own tendie party weeks later? Now that Tesla is leaving the atmosphere to Mars, do you think Tim Apple will want to miss out?\n\n\"What will be the catalyst?\" Fuck would I know what Tim Apple is cooking. But this voodoo astrology can smell the tendies he's about to serve.\n\n\"But but the rising cases, the winter lock down, the fundament-\" Shut the fuck up. When was the last time fundamentals mattered? You gay bears like it up the ass so much, you fur fags can't shut up. Fuck the news, we'll only crash if JPOW runs out of ink and we have another liquidity crisis.\n\nI can't guarantee AAPL will be as explosive as TSLA. It's already a 2 trillion dollar company. I can't guarantee AAPL will even go up. This post is simply an argument why it is probable it will muun. But with 3 months of consolidation and eerily silent volume, Apple is gearing up for a big move that will move the markets with it.\n\nIf you actually got this far (wtf?), thank you for letting me waste your time. \n \nPositions: Well I'm fucking balls deep in GME, so this is all I could cough up. AAPL 11/27 125C. Will probably go for December/January expirations once I can get another paycheck from Wendy's.\n\nTL;DR: Yall autists clambering about those commie ass EVs being the next Tesla are missing the iRocket Tim Apple is building to join Elon on Mars. Buy calls. Or just do what you want. At the end of the day it's just magic lines right? It's fugazi. It's a whazy. It's a woozie. It's fairy dust.",

        "selftext": "Sorry if questions like this aren't allowed but something I noticed a few times this year is that some companies are announcing note exchanges where if an investor chooses to exchange it, they receive a virtually identical note, but the new one is registered under Securities Act of 1933, whereas the previous notes were exempt. If you need an example, Qualcomm announced an exchange this morning and I believe Qorvo announced one 3-6 months ago. \n\nWhy would a company do this? Does having the note registered w/ the SEC allow more funds to invest in it (e.g. Corporate bond funds with stricter requirements)? \n\nHappy Friday!",

        "selftext": "**In this post I am going to share my experience as I start a new portfolio from 0$ and keep adding funds to it every month as I try to grow it as fast as possible**\n\nHey everyone Happy Thanksgiving and Welcome! So, I have deposited and invested in the stock market all the money I managed to save up in the last month as I deposited 3500$ in my eToro portfolio on the 12th of November and I am already up more than 7% in just two weeks. \n\nAs my portfolio has constantly outperform the big 3 indexes the Nasdaq100, the SP500 and the Dow Jones 30 almost every day since starting my portfolio. Here is a comparison of my portfolio vs the indexes since starting as I am up over 7%. [Portfolio v Index](https://ibb.co/pRnQLQf)\n\nSo i wondered? Is it really bad to own more stocks? Is less &gt; more? What is your opinion on this subject? I believe that it is way better to be invested in more companies and to add and grow your position in time as you also see how the companies evolve and you can also do some price averaging.\n\nSo here is my current portfolio composition as I split all my money equally to start, I will go into very few little details about everyone so I don\u2019t make this a 2 hour read time.\n\nI will start now by going alphabetically and not in the most important order as the first company that I own is BYD which is a rival company for both Tesla and NIO in the EV market as they focus on cars, new energy solutions and electronics. They are also developing a lot of commercial EV like buses, coaches and taxis which will be a great addressable market for them as they are not rivaled in those segments at the moment. The company has gone up a lot in value this year as you can see in this graph and have a Forward P/E of more than 100 but I believe this company will greatly expand its sales and be one of the leaders in the segment especially in China which is the biggest EV market.

While I will also use about 22% of my portfolio into more risky companies that can bring very good profits for the portfolio but in my opinion are not as safe as the others. \n\nAnd finally I will invest about 7% of my portfolio into more speculative stocks or hedge stocks like Barrick Gold and Goldman Sachs. I don\u2019t want to keep money on the sidelines at the moment as I expect the stock market will keep rising for a couple of years at a rapid pace due to the recovery of the economy.\n\nThank you everyone for reading!

[CHART](https://ibb.co/18g7xrJ)\n\nAll sectors finished in the green on Friday with real estate, energy and industrial leading the way with all 3 sectors having more than 50% of companies up over 2%, even tech kept up the pace after leading us through this recovery with over 37% of companies being up more than 2% on the day.\n\nWe also saw small-cap and value plays outperform again as people are betting that the economy will have a broader breadth of recovery after the vaccine will be available. [CHART](https://ibb.co/jTMx5ry)\n\nThe VIX also finished the week very strong as it continued to decline to it\u2019s lowest level, ending the week at the 23 level. [CHART](https://ibb.co/j4057B8)\n\nAs you can see in both the SP500 heat map [CHART](https://ibb.co/dW01vyR) and the world heat map  [CHART](https://ibb.co/G2Fvk7c) almost all companies were in the green on Friday with a few exceptions like Nvidia, NetFlix and Alibaba, as they were punished a little after the huge run they in the last 9 months while Alibaba continues to struggle with the Chinese government.\n\nThe COVID-19 numbers are dangerously going up as you can see, with daily cases going parabolic, indeed with a bigger number of tests being taken but there is still a huge rise in positivity rate, and as you can see this is the 3rd hump of the pandemic in terms of numbers of hospitalized people. The one positive thing for the moment is that deaths haven\u2019t gone up as much due to the better treatment but this number does usually trail the others so we will have to see what happens in the next weeks. [CHART](https://ibb.co/wdSTt4v)\n\nHere you can see better that weekly test are up almost 10% while weekly cases have gone up 4times that much almost at a 40% growth rate while the hospitalized and deaths have not increased as much as the cases yet. [CHART](https://ibb.co/QpzPbs8)\n\nThis weeks interesting earnings [EARNINGS](https://ibb.co/K5bMM4B) in my opinion will come from Walmart and Home Depot before the open on Tuesday as I expect both of them to dazzle in the earnings reports, while Walmart is expected to have an EPS of 1$ and 19 cents I expect them to be around 1,5$ at least like last quarter while Home depot is expected to have an EPS of just over 3$ I expect that to be at least 30cents to half a $ better then expected also as the companies look to continue the amazing earnings season that is mostly ending this week as we saw an overwhelming number of companies beating the estimates by quite a gap.\n\nThis will be followed after the close with the Concept company NIO which has been going up amazingly in the last weeks as it has touched even 54$ but has since seen a pullback of almost 10$, so be careful when trading this, it may be a bumpy ride as the company is still losing money and seeking to increase manufacturing and sales, as I don\u2019t see them having to much of a success in Europe even if the manage to launch they\u2019re cars there, this because people will have a stigma for the company as being Chinese, and not offering great quality. Despite the recent Chinese movements some good news came in on Sunday as China has formed the largest free trade block that includes fifteen Asia-Pacific Economies with big names like Japan, South Korea, Australia and others being included [NEWS](https://ibb.co/XbcqV80). This group will account for 30% of the global economy and population. This will probably bold well for NIO as it has tanked after Citron released a statement that they are taking profits in NIO [NEWS](https://ibb.co/SQBbW6s).\n\nMoving on Wednesday we will also get some other retailers reports with Target and Lowe\u2019s releasing reports also before the open. I believe this two will be impacted by what Walmart and Home Depot announce, if they have great results expect them the stocks to see a double move on Tuesday and Wednesday. Also, one of the biggest gainer of the stay at home moves, nVidia, will report after the close as I expect them do have great earnings again as they will continue to benefit a lot from the stay-at-home economy as October videogame sales were up 14% expect this also be translated into Nvidia\u2019s earnings as this was the month before the new consoles from Microsoft and Sony were released. [NVIDIA NEWS](https://ibb.co/kK3WWj4)\n\nSo I really like all 3 of Home Depot, Walmart and Nvidia and if you want to make a gamble you can also make a small investment in Nio, as there are no other big catalysts at the moment earnings may impact the stocks and we can see a re-test of highs for all of them.\n\nOne other company that I will keep my eye on is Disney as they beat the expectations for earnings, revenue and subscriber for the streaming business, I will watch what updates the investors meeting in December will provide us, as I really like the company and the stock very much, if they want to keep this going and become a rival for NetFlix they do have to invest much more money in content, as they will have to keep providing new content that generates growth for Disney+. [NEWS](https://ibb.co/QNCc3D3)\n\nSome other news from the last days are that Qualcomm has received an exemption to sell chips to Huawei, which is not was expected that they would be allowed to sell 5G chips, but still is good news for the company as it provides another buyer for its products. [NEWS](https://ibb.co/ZVp8gTw)\n\nWhile DraftKings soared on Friday after they announced better than expected results and guidance for the future. [NEWS](https://ibb.co/qy9vmyB)\n\nThis came alongside the filing of documents for the hugely anticipated of DoorDash the leader in food delivery with a 50% market share.

I still have no idea other than the basics about options but I understand how buying a lottery ticket works. \n\nFinally opened an account earlier this week with a (very) small chunk of change. Most of it went to dividend stocks for long term growth but as they say you gotta risk it for the biscuit. \n\nBought 30 shares of NMCI as a long play but what I\u2019m really excited about is Seagate (STX). I definitely don\u2019t have the capital to invest in shares but I\u2019ve been watching it and I think it\u2019s gonna continue the steady rise it\u2019s on. \n\nWith how fast tech advances and Seagate\u2019s new Lyve Drive I think they\u2019re poised for some great growth. Anyways what do you guys think about STX? I haven\u2019t seen many people talking about it on the sub. \n\nSTX 15 Jan 21 67.5 C\n\nOh and Go Retards! Or whatever y\u2019all say",
