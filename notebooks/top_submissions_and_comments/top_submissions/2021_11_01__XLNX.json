I know they have an upcoming merger with xilinx and they've partnered with Meta, but is more growth for the stock possible? I can't exactly see Semiconductors going anywhere, so I feel like the sky's the limit. What are everyone's thoughts?",

        "selftext": "Hello!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm fairly new to investing, and I'm looking to put more money in, but I'm a little hesitant. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have about $500 dollars in AMD @ around $85 in a Fidelity account. I also have $1,200 in my Robinhood account that I'd like to buy more AMD or XILINX. I'm hesitant to buy more because I was going to buy some when AMD was at $120, but I was hoping it would dip a bit. Turns out this was a huge mistake as you all know.\n\nOnto the bigger question, I'm a bit confused on how average share price, and either averaging up or down works. I understand the concept, but am unsure when it makes sense to do either. For example, If I wanted to buy $500 of AMD right now, would it make sense to transfer the money to Fidelity to buy it on there since my average is $85, or buy on Robinhood which would make my average whatever AMD is currently trading at?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHonestly any advice would be appreciated. Again, I'm really kicking myself for not buying AMD/XILINX 2 weeks ago when I was so close to doing it. If I decide to buy now, I don't want to mess up even more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you!",

The acquisition plan for the AMD XILINX deal is set at every 1xilinx share will be converted in to 1.7234 shares of AMD, as the deal approaches closing day the price of Xilinx will be infinitely close to the price of 1.7234 times the price of AMD. that means if every single one of us keep holding Xilinx and pump our robinhood gold money into amd, we can infinitely push our net higher due to the momentum and **getting more Robinhood gold in the same process.RAP.** At the current rate of how fucking hot these two are pulling up that means the market is  ready for this deal of the century! And guess what? IT GETS BETTER. AMD currently sits at a 5.72% of float  while Tesla has a short interest of 3.73% of float. A short squeeze may not be likely but a gamma squeeze might be already HAPPENING.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nfirst post, not a financial advisor. just for fun. I do own both of these stocks and I love them.

For every 1 Xilinx share you hold at the time of the merger, you receive about 1.72 AMD shares.\n\nLet\u2019s say I own 10 AMD shares valued at a total of $1000 and I bought 10 Xilinx shares with a total book cost of $1000. At the time of the merger, let\u2019s say my 10 AMD shares are worth $1100 and my 10 Xilinx shares are worth $1200. Would I have a total of 27.2 AMD shares with a market value of $2300, or would the market value be $2100 because I didn\u2019t realize those Xilinx gains?",

I also have $1,200 in my Robinhood account that I'd like to buy more AMD or XILINX. I'm hesitant to buy more because I was going to buy some when AMD was at $120, but I was hoping it would dip a bit. Turns out this was a huge mistake as you all know.\n\nOnto the bigger question, I'm a bit confused on how average share price, and either averaging up or down works. I understand the concept, but am unsure when it makes sense to do either. For example, If I wanted to buy $500 of AMD right now, would it make sense to transfer the money to Fidelity to buy it on there since my average is $85, or buy on Robinhood which would make my average whatever AMD is currently trading at?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHonestly any advice would be appreciated. Again, I'm really kicking myself for not buying AMD/XILINX 2 weeks ago when I was so close to doing it. If I decide to buy now, I don't want to mess up even more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you!",

        "selftext": "not financial advice! just personal thoughts. but I think I found the money glitch for all of us apes so please hear me out.\n\nI'm pretty sure some of us smooth brains have been paying attention to the recent AMD XILINX insane pull out as a FUCKING PAIR, let me explain to you why that it is an ABSOLUTE INFINITE MONEY GLITCH. The acquisition plan for the AMD XILINX deal is set at every 1xilinx share will be converted in to 1.7234 shares of AMD, as the deal approaches closing day the price of Xilinx will be infinitely close to the price of 1.7234 times the price of AMD. that means if every single one of us keep holding Xilinx and pump our robinhood gold money into amd, we can infinitely push our net higher due to the momentum and **getting more Robinhood gold in the same process.RAP.** At the current rate of how fucking hot these two are pulling up that means the market is  ready for this deal of the century! And guess what? IT GETS BETTER. AMD currently sits at a 5.72% of float  while Tesla has a short interest of 3.73% of float. A short squeeze may not be likely but a gamma squeeze might be already HAPPENING.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nfirst post, not a financial advisor. just for fun. I do own both of these stocks and I love them.

At the time of the merger, let\u2019s say my 10 AMD shares are worth $1100 and my 10 Xilinx shares are worth $1200.
