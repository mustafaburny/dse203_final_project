        "selftext": "I've been watching this site for forever and started trading in October with $5,000 and turned it into $40,000 trading earnings and Dis in Nov. It was awesome and I felt badass. \n\nAround Dec 1st I told my gf I would stop trading since I was having sleepless nights, stress headaches, and was somewhat obsessed with this shit. I had to get back in.... and that bad karma made me lose on almost every trade and added $30,000 of real money (to get above $25k) which I lost as well and am down currently $32,000 of real money in additions to all the gains from November. \n\nHere are some highlights: \n\nLulu earnings Dec 11th: I felt it would do well on earnings and lost $22,050 on a $25,000 yolo 10 minutes after purchasing. (My first big guh moment and I f'ing KNEW not to do this) \n\nNVDA Dec 23rd: Bought $25,000 of 1/10 calls that dipped 30 minutes after buying... got weak hands... and lost $13,384. (I bought at the ATH at the time and felt it would just keep going up) \n\nAMD Dec 26th: Bought $15,000 of AMD $50 calls at $47.10 (1/3 and 1/10)... dipped immediately after buying... got weak hands a couple days ago on Dec 30th... and sold around $45.80 for a $11,800 loss. Now I see that fucker is up around $49 today and figured it might since $50 seems doable next week. Fuck me and my shitty decisions... I knew I should have held until today with CES next week but Trump bombing Iraq got me twitchy and I just wanted out. (My $3k would be worth $18k if I would have stayed in one more day) \n\nThe highlight of November was selling my $28k of DIS fd's... 2 hours prior to the stock rocketing up once subscriber numbers were released. I took a $9,000 loss instead of a $150k+ gain. I still got in afterwards and it went up $40k.... which I held until it was a $12k gain and sold. (Selling 368 contracts 2 hours before subscriber numbers came out still makes my heart want to explode) \n\nWell that's my story. Not sure why I am posting but it kinda feels therapeutic in a way to let this shit out. I haven't told anyone since 1. Most my friends wouldn't understand 2. My gf would probably be pissed I lied to her. I have $3,200 left in my restricted from purchasing Robinhood account that I am transferring over to WeBull and the funds should be there in 2 days. I am thinking with earnings this month I can turn this $3,200 around with some smart purchases instead of yolo'ing stupidly. But maybe fucking not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n [https://imgur.com/gallery/4kVnfVS](https://imgur.com/gallery/4kVnfVS)",

([https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/anbr7e/first\\_year\\_into\\_stocks\\_summary\\_all\\_tech/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/anbr7e/first_year_into_stocks_summary_all_tech/)). I still follow buy and hold strategy and only sell stocks when I don't like certain changes in a company. Sometimes those decisions paid off, sometimes (AAPL) I missed out a bit (nevertheless I don't regret those decisions). \n\nAt some point I was down 30-50% on both NVDA and TSLA, I do strongly believe in both those companies and will not sell either of them in the next 5y for sure. Hitting a bigger number on the portfolio I started diversifying a bit as well. (MA,V,MRK)\n\nStrategy for 2020 is pretty simple for me, I'll invest mostly in AI and cybersececurity companies: First priority is to add a ton of Tencent. Highly recommend the book: \"AI Superpowers Book by Kai-Fu Lee\". imo there is no way around AI and probably Asia will be in the driving seat for the first time in 5-10y.\n\n**Be patient, don't panic sell, it might be swingy here and there but if you invest in strong companies it will pay off.** \n\nCurrent portfolio:\n\n* TSLA +56%\n* CRM +46%\n* FTNT +37%\n* MSFT +35%\n* AMZN +31%\n* MRK +9%\n* MA + 9%\n* NNND +8%\n* NVDA +7%\n* V +1%\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/6RJNKXU](https://imgur.com/a/6RJNKXU)",

        "selftext": "Hello everyone\n\nYou could say i am a fund manager at 21 years old, i came here to discuss something controversial you could say.\nLet me explain!\nI recently switched broker and opened up an account on eToro and soon i found out that people can copy my investments and i can get paid monthly for it. \n\nThe thing here is that you invest your own money and if people like your performance and portfolio they can choose to copy you. That basically makes me a fund manager but the thing is that i have to perform well in order for people to copy me and meet the criteria to get paid by the company (it doesnt cost anything for anyone to copy me).\n\nI started to pursue this thing around the end of 2019. I rebalanced my whole portfolio in order to meet certain criteria while keeping me invested in what i believe in.\n\nI have 100+ people copying me with around 80.000$ in Assets Under Management and returns so far for the year are at +14%\n\n\nAs of today my portfolio is :\n30.76% Tesla\n18.63% Facebook\n17.47% Amazon\n10.90% Uber\n9.40% Nvidia\n8.56% Disney\n4.83% cash\n\nNow the million dollar question:\nI am a long term investor but man Tesla has gone up to the moon. If it was only me i would not mind holding through the earnings but now 109 people are essentially invested in me and hurting my current profitability will result in people stop copying me (from my experience so far people are way too fast to pull the trigger in and out of you).\n\nTesla has to deliever a crazy earnings report in order for the stock to not fall dramatically.\nOn the one hand i dont want to sell anything because whatever the report is the long term dream of the company is more alive than ever.\n\nOn the other hand i want to cash out around 5-10% of my stake just in case the stock falls like 20% on earnings. If i sell some shares and remain with a 20% stake and the stock falls -20% the overall impact will be -4% on my portfolio which is like the worst case senario in my head. \n\nPersonally i dont want to sell but in my situation i have to keep in mind other people's \"risk-tolerance\" , most of them are short term in nature and if the worst happens they will pull out of me immidiatelly.\n\nWhat would you do guys if you were in my shoes?\n\nThanks a lot for your time!\n\nTl:dr : Should i reduce my stake in Tesla to 20% just in case?

Pretty much the main supplier for everyone aside from INTC or some shit, and who gives a shit about those clowns who can't even break 10nm. It's rumored they'll be manufacturing with TSMC too.\n\n5nm/3nm? Only 2 boys going hard on this, globalfoundries and TSMC. What the fuck is even a goldenfoundry, imagine actually paying Singaporean wages when you can pay Taiwanese wages.  Also Samsung apparently has some foundry or some shit but who cares about those gooks. \n\nEDA big boys - CDNS and SNPS - pretty much decide the market and no one even knows about them. They pretty much engineer the entire back end flow of IC manufacturing. What is their #1 foundry partnership? You guessed it. They don't even use technology libs from other foundries. If their customers go with alternative foundries they will spend millions resolving quality issues related to incompatibility between tools.\n\nWhen market goes into 5nm/3nm, 2-3 years from now, I bet these niggas at TSMC will completely dominate the market. Oh and coronavirus doesn't affect it, Taiwan is a literal island, but people will be scared of it because it's China, so I'm betting FEB/MAR will be the best months to buy, then it's moon only.",

        "selftext": "\u201c\u201cWe think Intel is benefiting from an improving macroeconomic climate versus company-specific improvements at this time,\u201d wrote RBC Capital Markets analyst Mitch Steves, who rates Intel\u2019s stock at underperform but took his price target up to $56 from $48. If his thesis is correct, Steves said Intel would simply be riding a \u201crising tide\u201d that\u2019s lifting all data-center competitors, and he expects rivals Nvidia Corp. NVDA, +1.12%  and AMD to keep outperforming Intel by picking up share.\u201d\n\nWhen Micron reported earnings in December they announced the bottom of the semiconductor market. And, they believe with their recent expansion in sales that the market it finally turning up due to 5G. With 5G more things are going to go into the cloud than we have now and new businesses will be born from this. You need data centers to power this. Micron makes the drives to hold the data for the data centers. AMD and Intel make the CPUs to process the data. \n\nIntel reported 1 billion in growth from the cycle turning out. Analysts are shrugging their shoulders because the conference call said they will experience a down turn in the second half, which is strange for a company that just beat by 1 billion. The banks grilled Intel about this and they answered that it is due to competition and they made their numbers \u201cconservative.\u201d\n\nAMD has released beefy 64 core processors so much cheaper than Intel and on 7nm technology, which Intel said won\u2019t have until 2021. This is why AWS and Azure and even Google Cloud are buying so many of these processors. They get better margins for their investors and they get better efficiency.

        "selftext": "TL:DR at the bottom.\n\nI have been studying options and practicing with paper trading, and I have gotten comfortable with picking successful, modest plays consistently. I'm trying to implement stop orders into my strategy to restrict the option moving against me. Let me give a practical example of a failure this morning.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn 01/17/2020, I sold 10 vertical credit spreads for NVDA with strikes of 235|230 for the sell side and buy side respectively. \n\nUnfortunately, I can't see the exact trade price of the options in the TOS account summary, but I know the option had a credit value of .20, so this entire set would net me $200 at the end of the week. This morning NVDA is at $248.5 and the value of this contract was .16. Everything looks good.\n\nSince I'm experimenting (and it's just paper trading), I figured I would sacrifice this trade to try to figure out how stops work in the context of options, so I put in a stop over the weekend for .18.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy thinking was, if this contract started to go against me due to NVDA decreasing, the extrinsic value of the options would increase making the value of the contract begin to approach .20. With a stop order of .18, if I sold when the contract reached this value, I would lose almost all of the money I made, but still have enough to cover the $.65/contract closing fee. However, if the contract is going below this value, that's good for me, and I would have no reason to sell.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe problem seems to be that due to the nature of a stop, the system saw that .16 was less than .18, and it sold my contracts. In the context of normal stocks, this makes sense, but I wasn't sure of the behavior since with this credit spread an increase in contract value is actually a loss, and a decrease is a gain. Essentially, I didn't know which way the stop was protecting against. Now I do.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TL:DR:**\n\nIs there an order that triggers when the contract value is greater than or equal to a certain value instead of less than or equal to? Alternatively, is there a trigger that has the stop associated with a stock price instead of an option contract price? My only thought is that using a limit is the proper way to go, but I'm not sure if there are better methods, since the limit could get blown by fast movement.\n\nThoughts?",

        "selftext": "**Growth Stocks (Medifast and Cardlytics)**\n\n**Medifast** $MED, the weight management company, presented at the ICR conference on Monday and restated its goal to double in size every 3-4 years and targeted 2021 revenues of $1,000 million (2019 guidance $700-$710 million)  That\u2019s reassuring after a disappointing Q3 when the company was hit by a credit card fraud.\n\nThe stock dropped 29% after those results which seemed a little harsh since the issue was fully resolved, revenues still managed to grow 36.5% and guidance for the full year forecast 40% revenue growth and 26% EPS growth.  It\u2019s not as if Medifast was trading on a big multiple.  The stock has since recovered from the post release drop and then, as it is now, trades on around 2x trailing revenues and 20x trailing earnings.  Pretty reasonable for a growth stock.\n\nThe problem is is that Medifast has been tarred with the same brush as Herbalife and other multi level marketing schemes which use agents to promote sales.  However, the model is quite different. Medifast sells direct to the customer.  Its agents don\u2019t get discounts or handle stock.  That means Medifast isn\u2019t artificially boosting sales by recruiting and selling to its own agents.\n\nA few years ago the company was a quiet and essentially family run affair.  That was until Dan Chard was appointed in 2015.  Formerly the President of Global Sales and Operations at Nu Skin he was the right person for the job.  He developed the Optavia Diet brand and put in place the direct marketing business model. Sales exploded from $273 million to $689 million in less than four years.\n\nWith a product that works and a growing level of demand (driven by obesity) coupled with a capital light highly scalable business model and effective management, Medifast looks very attractive.  The company also has a potentially huge global opportunity but only recently moved to grow internationally with expansion into Hong Kong and Singapore 2019.  Europe and South America and Australia would also make excellent markets.\n\nCEO Dan Chard\u2019s comments this week suggest the bright outlook has not changed.  2021 targets for revenue of $1,000 million and 15% operational margins remain.  That  would generate net income of $115 million if we apply the current effective tax rate.  The $115.58 stock price at Fridays close would represent a forward earnings multiple of just 11.7 (TTM PE 19). With a strong growth forecast, the stock looks cheap.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Cardlytics** $CDLX reported preliminary Q4 revenues this week that were up 44% at $69 million and thrashed estimates of $59 million.  The digital advertiser uses a proprietary native bank advertising channel that enables marketers to reach consumers through their trusted and frequently visited online and mobile banking channels.\n\nHowever Cardlytics\u2019 main advantage is the use of purchase intelligence outside the banking channel to boost advertising effectiveness. It\u2019s not difficult to see why knowing what customers have bought in the past is a good predictor of what they will buy in the future.  The company claims that its return on ad spend (ROAS) is 10x the industry average at $30 for each $1 spent. \n\nThe stock price has risen 22% since the announcement but (valued at 11.3x revenues) still looks reasonable compared to peers such as The Trade Desk (valued at 21x). With a huge ROAS advantage, it seems likely that strong growth will continue.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Value Stocks (Samsung, Signet and Fluent)**\n\nFool.com reported that this is an exciting and pivotal time for NVIDIA. The company remains at the forefront of gaming and is well placed to thrive in the new frontiers which lie in data center, artificial intelligence, and automotive applications.  However, if the valuation at 35x forward earnings is too much for you (and you don\u2019t mind looking abroad) then perhaps **Samsung Electronics** ($005930.KS) is a better buy. \n\nSamsung has a dominant position in memory chips and memory demand is exploding with the roll out of 5G and applications in artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things. The company is currently trading on just 9x last years earnings. Additionally, net cash (including short term investments) is equivalent to a remarkable 25% of its total valuation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Signet Jewelers** $SIG stock price jumped 40% on Thursday after the company reported a significant beat and raise. The company, whose outlets include Kay Jewelers, Zales and Jared, said comps were up 1.6% as a 13.5% growth in digital sales helped offset a 0.2% decline in brick and mortar sales.  That\u2019s encouraging as it seems jewelry buyers switching to online channels prefer to buy from names they know and trust.  The retailer still faces headwinds but its valuation doesn\u2019t look expensive.  EPS guidance was raised to $3.42 to $3.56 from $2.99 to $3.26 meaning, even after the recent price jump, the $29.52 stock is valued at just 8.4x earnings.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Fluent, Inc**. $FLNT announced on Tuesday that it expects to exceed its previously provided guidance for full-year 2019 with revenue now anticipated to be $280.8 - $281.8 million, representing growth of 12% and an increase from previous guidance of $265 - $267 million. \n\nThe company operates in a fast growing, fast changing and competitive sector - digital marketing. It has built up a huge database of (150 million+) that it can target on behalf of clients. It uses competitions to get details and, importantly, gets consent from clients to contact them. A former CEO has said that if European data protection laws were introduced in the US it would give Fluent a huge advantage as it (largely) already has consent. Indeed Europe offers a huge potential market for Fluent and the company has already reportedly started testing in the UK.\n\nThe news this week is an important development for Fluent whose stock has not had a good year. The data driven digital marketer is down 60% (with a valuation of 0.8x sales and 1.1x book) from the years highs after reducing guidance, not once but twice.\n\nIn fairness, management have been clear throughout that the outlook for the core advertising platform remains very good. The drop in revenues and rising costs are due to the company exiting peripheral ventures that have been explored and not met revenue/return targets (as well as a couple of bad debts deemed unrecoverable). \n\nThe recent results support that thesis and suggests growth should accelerate once the headwind of exiting non core businesses passes. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Insider (RumbleOn)**\n\nBoth the CFO and a director at **RumbleOn** $RMBL each picked up $114,000 of stock on Tuesday following $90,000 of purchases by the CEO last month.  (Warning RumbleOn is a high risk nano cap stock)\n\nMake no mistake RumbleOn is tiny with a market cap of just $16 million.  A development stage e-commerce platform that facilitates consumers and dealers to buy, sell, trade, and finance pre-owned recreational vehicles. It primarily focuses on pre-owned Harley-Davidson motorcycles and other powersports and also provides third-party financing services.  However, it is growing rapidly leveraging its capital-light network of 17 regional partnerships and disrupting the old-school pre-owned vehicle dealerships.  Thats a massive and highly fragmented market with around $1 trillion of sales.\n\nRumbleOn expects to achieve its first quarter of EBITDA profitability in 2020 and have a full year of EBITDA profitability in 2021. That seems reasonable given recent growth.  In November Q3 results reported revenues of $220 million compared to just $19 million in 2018. Last week the company reported preliminary results expecting full year 2019 revenue range to $837.7 million to $840.7 million compared to $156 million in 2018.  Margins are tight but the company is moving swiftly from dealers to consumer sales which are almost three times are profitable.  \n\nRumbleOn CEO Marshall Chesrown said \u201cWe are pleased with the progress we are making\u201d going on to add \u201cWe continue to expect an acceleration in unit and revenue growth in the first half of 2020\u201d.   \n\nThe company is a high risk development stage nano cap with dilution being more of a certainty than a risk.  However its fast growth suggests it is resonating well with users and, if it is even slightly successful in winning a small share of the huge vehicle sales market, current stock holders should do very well.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Follow\" me if you would like to be informed of updates during the week.\n\nThis is not a recommendation to buy or sell.  Stocks are not suitable for everyone.  Some of the stocks mentioned are risky small cap and/or highly speculative.  Please do your own research.",

AMZN outperformed for 5-year but underperformed for 1-year period\n\nYMMV\n\n&gt; **Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN)** is one of the best companies in the world, one we've recommended multiple times in Stock Advisor. And it's still one of our top investing opportunities today, because it's keeping up a fast pace of innovation. Consider ongoing successes like Amazon Web Services, the company's cloud service \u2014 AWS has captured roughly half of the cloud infrastructure market, and it's still Amazon's fastest-growing segment.\n \n&gt; It's been almost a year since we last named **Idexx Laboratories (NASDAQ: IDXX)** a Best Buy Now. Back then, I wrote that it had more than tripled for members who bought shares when we recommended it in July 2014. Well, Idexx has spent the last 11 months going even higher \u2014 it's now up 330% since that initial recommendation, better than a 4-bagger.\n&gt; \n&gt; It's been more than two years since **McCormick (NYSE: MKC)** last appeared as a Best Buy Now in Stock Advisor. Over that period, its stock is up roughly 70% versus the market's nearly 30% \u2014 and that's just in stock gains alone. This dividend aristocrat's total returns outperform the market by a whopping 44 percentage points over that same time period.\n&gt; \n&gt; In November 2018, **NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA)** fell from grace, never to recover \u2014 or so the talking heads would have told you. Back then, the company was dealing with the fallout of an unexpected drop in demand for its cryptocurrency mining products. Nowadays, the chipmaker's world couldn't look brighter. Its graphics, high-performance computing, and artificial intelligence chips are key to advances in gaming, cloud computing, automotive connectivity, manufacturing, and healthcare.\n&gt; \n&gt; There's an unquenchable thirst for data around the world, which is triggering an intense, high-stakes race in the semiconductor industry. That's great news for **Synopsys (NASDAQ: SNPS)**, a kind of behind-the-scenes quality assurance specialist that can benefit no matter which chipmakers have the upper hand.",
