        "selftext": "Hello fellow retards\n\nI know these are difficult times for this sub and it\u2019s almost impossible to post something solid which is not about the current meme stocks.\n\nInstead of jerking to some porn i did some research on PLTR and want to share my DD with you. This might be a longer text for your love dopamine level so maybe you should grab some your Adderall before.\n\nThe following text might you give your eyes aids since English isn\u2019t my native language. I will try my best.\n\n**Palantir as a Company \u2013 the beginnings**\n\nPLTR was founded by some people and one of them is Peter Thiel who worked alongside with our holy papa Elon at PayPal. As a payment-service they had concerns about money laundering and founded PLTR to tackle this issue early. The CIA also funded PLTR (they are always funding stuff like this \u2013 Siri as example). This actually might be the reason why people think that PLTR is a company which aggregates data and do data analysis for the government\u2026.but this is not accurate and not correct at all if you see the big picture. I will explain this point later.\n\nYou retard still reading? Nice here some rocket emoji\u2019s to pump your dopamine and keep you happy.\n\nLet\u2019s start with the DD\n\nFirst of all my POV is looking for a midterm to long term investment in PLTR. My valuation considers PLTRs current state and predicting from now on for the next few years.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **1. The Management**\n\nBefore I start with the product I rather start with the management. You can sell the nicest thing in the world. I can guarantee you that the product definitely won\u2019t be considered as the nicest thing after a while if you have a shitty management (Intel). With Peter Thiel on the leaderboard we got a competent asshole and CEO is Alex carp (co-founder) Peter Thiel is well known and Alex Karp is one of us. He yolod his heritage into some business and become a chad. Seriously tho, I trust Peter and if Peter holds on Alex since Decades so do I. Peter proved so many times how cunning he is and showed how to pick adapt problems early and create solutions.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **2. PLTR Business model/ products**\n\nBefore we understand how important PLTRs products are we have to understand that we are simpeltons who don\u2019t have any business with PLTRs. We create data. We don\u2019t fuck with it. We creating with using our phones or working in the office. Only a few of us may working with accumulated big data. PLTRs customers\u2019 base isn\u2019t neighbor Joe or Aunt Nancy. The products they offer are not even for midcap companies they are more designed for whole industries and governments. That\u2019s the reason why their products aren\u2019t so tangible for many people.\n\nPLTR basically offers systems to big companies/governments which import their data into these systems. PLTR doesn\u2019t sends workers to the client to collect data and analyse it. They sell platforms. They got 2 Products called \u201cGraham\u201d and \u201cFoundry\u201d You may think wtf is this guy talking about? Let me explain it in 2 examples:\n\nFirst example is Syria with Graham. It was impossible in the country to know who the good guys are and who the bad ones are. I know u muricans only know yourself and the rest of the world is the \u201crest of the world\u201d for you. But this wasn\u2019t so simple in Syria you had many factions with different intentions and some of them were allies and some of them were enemies. The lack of information or the ability of recognizing and sorting these information\u2019s are crucial in a war. PLTR solved the struggle with creating a map which provided resilient information for the marines so they can operate safely. Civil problems over there could also be fixed.\n\n[https://www.mercurynews.com/2016/10/04/palantir-using-big-data-to-solve-big-humanitarian-crises/](https://www.mercurynews.com/2016/10/04/palantir-using-big-data-to-solve-big-humanitarian-crises/)\n\nActually what the John Hopkins University does with the covid numbers and the map, is some sort of what PLTR offering with their solutions. There are rumors that the tracking of Covid and the vaccination will be done by PLTR.\n\nIn their S1 Form PLTR describes it this way\n\n\u201cGotham, our first software platform, was constructed for analysts at defense and intelligence agencies. They were hunting for needles not in one, but in thousands of haystacks. And they did not have the software they needed to do their jobs. In Afghanistan and Iraq, soldiers were mapping networks of insurgents and makers of roadside bombs by hand. Gotham enables users to identify patterns hidden deep within datasets, ranging from signals intelligence sources to reports from confidential informants, and helps U.S. and allied military personnel find what they are looking for.\u201d\n\n[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1321655/000119312520230013/d904406ds1.htm#rom904406\\_11](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1321655/000119312520230013/d904406ds1.htm#rom904406_11)\n\nThe second example is about \u201cFoundry\u201d and it\u2019s directly from the S1 File of PLTR (page 121)\n\n\u201cAn Airbus A350, for example, has five million parts and is built by hundreds of teams that are spread across four countries and more than eight factories. Companies routinely struggle to manage let alone make sense of the data involved in large projects. Foundry was built for them. The platform transforms the ways in which organizations interact with information by creating a central operating system for their data.\u201d\n\nBoth of these systems solving big issues with less effort. The arms industry as example would took billions for drones and stuff in Syria for the same job. The important fact is that PLTR does not spend so much resources for new clients they only have to provide access and support for their services and the client feeding the \u201cmachine\u201d with data.\n\nThe key point is to understand that PLTR benefits very huge from economy of scales. This is very important since their costs for additional revenue is basically flat while the profits growing exorbitant with new customers. They offer a software and platforms and not kind of services where they need man power. All they do is working on their platforms and improving it.\n\n[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-palantir-ipo-breakingviews-idUSKCN26E3I2](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-palantir-ipo-breakingviews-idUSKCN26E3I2)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **3. PLTRs big issue during the last decade**\n\nPeter Thiel was a great supporter of Trump and funded his elections campaign. The market thought that when trump wins then PLTR will get all the government (especially military) contracts.\n\n[https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/10/technology/peter-thiel-bet-donald-trump-wins-big.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/10/technology/peter-thiel-bet-donald-trump-wins-big.html)\n\nBut this didn\u2019t happened. Peter got cucked by the huge authority apparatus in pentagon. These dudes loves bureaucracy and they do it for a good reason. If you retire from your job in pentagon you usually get a high paid luxurious position at Lockheed, Raytheon or Bae Systems to make additional free money for your retirement. Many thousand people working in pentagon just to select and buy stuff for the government. They spending billions of dollars for purchases and then PLTR came around and said like \u201elook guys we can do this job for a few millions instead billions\u201c. Of course the arms industry was pissed and the pentagon boomers helped them out. PLTR got constantly scammed from boomers and didn\u2019t get the contracts. This was also the \u201eswamp \u201etrump was talking about.\n\n[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-10-28/inside-palantir-s-war-with-the-u-s-army](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-10-28/inside-palantir-s-war-with-the-u-s-army)\n\n[https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2017/03/27/palantir-trump-army-military-procurement.html](https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2017/03/27/palantir-trump-army-military-procurement.html)\n\nA fun fact to this matter: Before James Mattis got summoned as the Defense Secretary of the USA he was a general in Afghanistan. He ordered services from PLTR despite the fact the pentagon was against it. But the marines praised PLTRs software and valued it over the trash they used to know from the defense/arms industry.\n\n*Processing img 2os8izwwe4h61...*\n\n[https://www.military.com/defensetech/2013/07/01/special-forces-marines-embrace-palantir-software](https://www.military.com/defensetech/2013/07/01/special-forces-marines-embrace-palantir-software)\n\nEven with a James Mattis as the defense secretary, trump as president and regardless that PLTR does it better and cheaper than the arms industry, it wasn\u2019t possible for PLTR to get the government contracts.\n\n[https://www.politico.com/story/2017/06/11/palantir-defense-jim-mattis-inner-circle-239373](https://www.politico.com/story/2017/06/11/palantir-defense-jim-mattis-inner-circle-239373)\n\n[https://fortune.com/longform/palantir-pentagon-trump/](https://fortune.com/longform/palantir-pentagon-trump/)\n\nHow it\u2019s ended? Well Peter\u2019s wife doesn\u2019t have a boyfriend because Peter is the fucking boyfriend of their wifes. All ended at the court and PLTR won. All this injustice ended at the court. The judgements on these cases are true circuit breakers for PLTR. Not only because PLTR spent shit tons of money for law suits. The lawsuits were perfect uppercut hits on the arms industry and they ended some fraudulent behaviors and \u201ebest practices \u201ein the government\n\n[https://www.defensenews.com/land/2016/10/31/judge-rules-in-favor-of-palantir-in-lawsuit-against-us-army/](https://www.defensenews.com/land/2016/10/31/judge-rules-in-favor-of-palantir-in-lawsuit-against-us-army/)\n\n[https://www.defensenews.com/land/2019/03/29/palantir-who-successfully-sued-the-army-just-won-a-major-army-contract/](https://www.defensenews.com/land/2019/03/29/palantir-who-successfully-sued-the-army-just-won-a-major-army-contract/)\n\nPLTR will profit from a Biden who wants to decrease the military expenditures. They will get the job done and at the same time the costs will go down. With the recent judgements the door looks open.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **4. Valuation problems**\n\nI could spam some multiplication on revenue or even a DCF but I think it\u2019s not necessary. Expect the costs of research and development (maybe marketing) the costs of PLTR stood mostly flat in the last quarters. It\u2019s a growth stock and the pricing is mostly in the perspective of PLTR. This is actually all we need to know that the revenue increases while the costs staying mostly flat. Check out the balance sheets at page 12 on the S Form 1.\n\nLet\u2019s talk about the market. The whole market seems overpriced but it isn\u2019t tbh. Due to the low cost of capital there is no alternative than to throwing your money on stocks or on real estate. There is nothing with a solid interest rate around (not even in emerging markets). At the stock exchange like in 70s, the companies had to offer a return, a perspective which should be more attractive as putting your money on a saving account with 8% interests without risks. These times are gone since the 2000s. So before people discuss insane valuation they should check out the fiscal and economical policies.\n\nNow back to PLTR and why the price is difficult to set (cheap imo). First of all PLTR did a direct listing without an investment bank for their share offerings. Its lacking of the valuation which they usually would get through such a process.\n\nPLTR wanted to do IPO with Morgan Stanley but it was mess.\n\n[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-09-04/morgan-stanley-s-long-romance-of-palantir-pays-off-as-ipo-nears](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-09-04/morgan-stanley-s-long-romance-of-palantir-pays-off-as-ipo-nears)\n\nMorgan Stanley proved themselves many times as stubborn communists when it comes to valuations. I mean you guys remember their disgusting price targets for tesla like 100$ post split or stuff like that.\n\nThese guys are very focused on numbers and I know it\u2019s difficult to price in the potential and perspectives. But you can\u2019t ignore these things for a fundamental valuation. If you want to consider these things in the price you have to understand the business of the company.\n\nThis ended that one team at Morgan Stanley valuated PLTR with 5 billion while another team thought they worth 40 billion.\n\n[https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2018/11/14/palantir-ipo-valuation-morgan-stanley.html](https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2018/11/14/palantir-ipo-valuation-morgan-stanley.html)\n\nHow is this difference possible and why is this happening? Because people don\u2019t understand what they are valuating. This happened a lot in the last decade because the decision makers in these banks and many analyst don\u2019t have any idea which metrics they should use on companies like that. They are using the metrics from classical industries on new business. They freaked out when Facebook was valued with 100 billion as IPO. Same with Twitter and in the last years it was Tesla. They said apple going to tank every damn year in the last decade. I honor Warren Buffet so much since he has the dignity to realize that he don\u2019t understands something but at the same time he sees the potential and the trend. That\u2019s why he hired 2 Chads who bought Snowflake for him. The transformation and the generation change didn\u2019t happened yet. That\u2019s why they try to use the metrics from Caterpillar on Tesla.\n\nGuys the whole market is mooning with the cheap liquidity. Pennystocks and zombie companies transforming into billion dollar market cap companies. Facebook as IPO had a market cap of 104 billion back in 2012. At that time it wasn\u2019t possible for Facebook to monetize their users with selling ads. They just paid 100 billion for the potential in more difficult market conditions.\n\nLook at the IPOs like doordash, Bumble. I\u2019m not going to call this a bubble. Just check out their business cases and use the metrics. Maybe its easier for people to understand Bumble and Doordash\u2026\n\nOn page 12 of the S1 (balance sheet) Form you can already see the huge positive trends in PLTRs revenue and their costs. All this without all the positive events and contracts PLTR recently got.\n\nPLTRs valuation is difficult and I think it\u2019s miscalculated by pessimistic communist who don\u2019t understand that their products are game changers for industries, governments and defense forces. Because of these points I think there is huge price potential for PLTR\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **5. Risks for PLTR**\n\nDespite the general market risks PLTR mentions at page 29 of the S1 Form the competitors as the main risk: \u201cWe face intense competition in our markets, and we may lack sufficient financial or other resources to maintain or improve our competitive position.\u201d The S1 Form didn\u2019t aged well. Actually I don\u2019t think that PLTR would have any trouble with offering new shares. Also with Peter Thiel as one of the founders the financial side should be stable.\n\nAs PLTR competitor people use to mention IBM. The boomers from IBM already surrendered with their Windows95 computers and decided to cooperate. The biggest threat would be big tech with big money like AMZN or APPL. You all now the stories about APPL and Spotify or AMZN and all the merchants. Even if the big players would step into PLTR markets it would be difficult for them since PLTRs products doesn\u2019t rely on an Amazon store or on apple devices. PLTR is years ahead with their products.\n\nI think the greatest risk (still) are the boomerish arms industry and all the boomers in pentagon and other authorities.\n\nThere are very corrupt infrastructures when it comes to decision making and assigning contracts. People fear changes but they can\u2019t avoid the changes. With the recent judgements we can see a turn on the tables but the transformation will still take time. It\u2019s a circuit breaker with an avalanche effect.\n\nThe risk factors on page 16 on the S1 form mostly aren\u2019t relevant anymore. People complained that PLTR wasn\u2019t profitable for 18 years. Well PLTR was never designed to be profitable and Alex Karp once said \u201clove us or leave us alone\u201d.\n\n[https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2020/09/09/palantir-ceo-makes-livestreamed-pitch-to-investors.html](https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2020/09/09/palantir-ceo-makes-livestreamed-pitch-to-investors.html)\n\nBut even this changed recently. PLTR became profitable in 2020 with 130,000,000\u00a7. Now the same people complaining about how high the stock price compared to the profits. Well just you wait.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **6. Conclusion and Outlook**\n\nIf you still reading I have to admit that this was a lot text and i am sorry again about the lingo. Let\u2019s connect the dots and bring this information to a point\n\n1. The boomer coalition in the pentagon and in the arms industry is taken down by PLTR. They will able to get the governments contracts and the classic arms/defense industry is no match for PLTR products. The judgements of lawsuits were catalyst and the effects should be already shown in the next earnings. These were such underrated events but I think there still will be some odds but PLTRs situation is much better as it was a time ago. The chains are off!\n2. Military expenditures rising worldwide\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qqcv8vzee4h61.jpg?width=744&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=98d264f091b7ff80926038660f43c57b87fc8ef2\n\n[https://www.sipri.org/media/press-release/2020/global-military-expenditure-sees-largest-annual-increase-decade-says-sipri-reaching-1917-billion](https://www.sipri.org/media/press-release/2020/global-military-expenditure-sees-largest-annual-increase-decade-says-sipri-reaching-1917-billion)\n\nWith Bidens presidency we will see more disruptive technologies chosen by the government. Biden want to reduce the military expenditures. PLTR is able to provide better service for lower cost. Not only the recent judgements also the political change will help PLTR. Ironic if you remember that Peter supported Trump and getting his tendies from Biden.\n\n3. PLTR superior products profits hugely from economy of scales. They don\u2019t have any significant costs when they acquire new customers. Making the big data usable for decisions making is already very important and step by step people realize that this issue growing fast. We creating everyday more data than we did yesterday and leaving the majority of it as trace and unstructured data. We don\u2019t work with it but big Institutions does.\n\nHere is the passage from the S1 and I fully agree with it:\n\n\u201cThe systemic failures of government institutions to provide for the public \u2014 fractured healthcare systems, erosions of data privacy, strained criminal justice systems, and outmoded ways of fighting wars \u2014 will continue to require both the public and private sectors to transform themselves. We believe that the underperformance and loss of legitimacy of many of these institutions will only increase the speed with which they are required to change.\u201d\n\n4. PLTRs value. The current situation of the market with tons of liquidity seems like a bubble. People don\u2019t know what to do with the cheap capital and people throwing it even on meme pennystocks.\n\nFacebook had his ipo back in 2012 during much harder market conditions as now. The valuation of Facebook was over 100 billion and people called it insanely overvalued. They did it because Facebook didn\u2019t had a way to monetize their users (especially on mobile platforms). Facebook has a market cap of over 750 billion now and nobody calling it over valued.\n\nA remember the recent examples? Bumble?! Bruuuh. Don\u2019t get me wrong if you invested in Bumble but they have nothing special to offer and their business case can easily copied or improved by others. Its shows the current state of our market with the crazy liquidity that even zombie companies got astronomic valuations. Use these metrics on PLTR with great products, great management, low cost base and less odds as ever before\u2026.\n\nPLTR price is wrong imo especially in this market and with PLTRs current state and perspective.\n\n5. Do you use PLTR? Me Neither! It\u2019s not designed for us and we have to inform us about the success. PLTRs new contracts and their future are shining bright. With the settled lawsuits the sky is clear for PLTR. But their customer base is not only America. I\u2019m not a murican and 3 weeks before I just find out that the police departments in our state using PLTR products. I don\u2019t need to link endless evidences here since you can google it by yourself and see how many contracts PLTR recently got. Especially after the circuit breakers we talked about.\n\nI have genuinely trust into Peter Thiel and Alex Karp that their will make the best of PLTRs potential. The odds getting removed and the demand for PLTR is increasing.\n\nIf all these information would priced in correctly we would have a share price of at least 60-70$.  With upcoming and ongoing positive events PLTR share price should soar more..\n\n**What\u2019s next?**\n\nNow we have earnings ahead and the lock up period ending.\n\nFor the earnings I think the number will be fine and keep up the positive trend on revenue with a disproportionately trend of the costs. The most important part will be guidance for 2021. We should listen closely and see if the magic is already happening.\n\nThe second event is the ending of the lock up period. You all remember the end of the lock up period of Nikola? Just 1-2 days after they announced they don\u2019t got the GM deal? The stock tanked \u2013 for a good reason. You know the guy Trevor Milton.\n\nBut in PLTRs case everything is different. Despite the successful deals they got, does a guy who says \u201clove us or leave us alone\u201d sounds like someone who going to drop his shares at the first possibility? I don\u2019t expect such a behavior from Alex Karp and neither from Peter Thiel. If some employees drop their shares it should be fine.\n\nI would appreciate if the stock prices would go below 3\u00df. It would create a healthy bullish chart pattern and would be actually a nice discount to get in or stock up. I don\u2019t think that the shares going to dump a lot because of this event. The earnings and the guidance are more important and the key events if you want to invest mid \u2013 long term.\n\nWhat does all this means for you? Nothing! Please don\u2019t do any market activity based on my DD. I\u2019m just sharing my knowledge and looking for critics so I can reevaluate my theses. This is not a financial advice.\n\nMy hearts bleeding for all the GME holders. My last Reddit account got banned because I criticized \u201cthe pumpers\u201d. In one of the comments I called the mods gay and got banned permanently (bye bye 20 k karma). If you are new to this please don\u2019t do any decision based on this so I can sleep gladly.\n\nI\u2019m not well positioned and not trying to pump this stock. I have 70 shares and a CSP. Fair play and fuck all the bots and pump and dumper we recently got in the sub!\n\nLeave an upvote if this post helped you. I need some more karma to be able to shitpost everywhere again!",

        "selftext": "**__$HUT - A Safe Bitcoin Arbitrage Opportunity Amidst Crazy Valuations - Hut8 Bull Thesis__**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWhat's poppin' fellas, it's your resident ape gang professor Flux, here to lay down some knowledge. You may remember me from my AT&amp;T short term bull thesis where I managed to call the pop on AT&amp;T two days before it did, and helped a bunch of dudes \"risklessly\" bag upwards of 180%. This is my second attempt at writing DD, and I feel like I may have gotten a little lost in the sauce in this one, so I left midway TLDRs for people to read in case they don't really give a fuck about the nitty gritty. All that being said, buckle the fuck in, this is a long one.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n##__Introduction__\n\nI'm going to preface this by saying that I am *not* particularly fond of Bitcoin as a whole. I fuckin hate magic internet money. That being said, there are people who are way fuckin' smarter than me who are insanely bullish on it, and with major companies like Paypal, Tesla, and Apple starting to grab some, as well as major institutions like Blackrock starting to dabble in it, it would be stupid to ignore completely. For the time being, Bitcoin is here to stay, and although I despise it, I know that there's money to be made. Investor euphoria is at all time highs, with the price of mining companies rapidly outpacing and diverging from Bitcoin its self. After watching Riot Blockchain run up from a penny stock, to 3$, to 15$, to 30$, to now fucking 70$, you better believe I'm not passing up ***another*** opportunity to make some coin. If you want some exposure to Bitcoin in your portfolio, without paying fuckin' 70$ for $RIOT, you've come to the right place. Enter, Hut8.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n#**__What is Bitcoin Mining?__**\n\nBefore we get started, I need to lay down a few key concepts. In layman's terms, Bitcoin Mining is the process of creating new Bitcoin by solving a computational puzzle. The result of Bitcoin mining is twofold. First, when computers solve these complex math problems on the blockchain, they produce new Bitcoin. Second, by solving computational math problems, Bitcoin miners make the Bitcoin payment network trustworthy and secure by verifying transaction information.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nTo mine a new block on the Bitcoin blockchain you must find a number called a [nonce] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_nonce). This number is extremely difficult to get, and there's no easy way to cheese it ; Miners must try calculations over and over again until they brute force the correct result. The brute force method is extremely time consuming and computationally expensive, as you are literally trying every combination out there to get the SINGLE one that works. \"C'mon Flux, How many combinations could there possibly be\", you ask? A fuckload. A mega shitton. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIt's estimated that the total hash rate of the entire Bitcoin network is currently sitting at roughly [151 million TH's](https://www.blockchain.com/charts/hash-rate). That's 151 million, TRILLION nonces attempted, per SECOND. On average, the network ensures that it takes roughly 10 minutes to mine a block, so we can multiply 151 million trillion by 600 to get our answer. That's **9*10^22**, or **900000000000000000000000** different combinations attempted, to crack the block, grab your coin, and move onto the next one. And it's only getting *more* difficult. The network adjusts how many computations must be done on average to find a valid nonce every 2 weeks. The aim is to keep the mining times consistent at 1 block per 10 minutes. Therefore, if mining power is doubled, difficulty would also get doubled.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n#**__Rise of the ASIC__**\n\nBack in the day, any schmuck could mine Bitcoin and turn a slight profit on their personal computer. With the insane increase in hashing power, you actually end up losing more money to electricity costs than you would make mining, by a factor of 10. This was largely in part, due to some real smart mfs inventing what is known as the ASIC miner.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nASIC stands for Application Specific Integrated Circuit. Back in 2013, people started developing ASIC chips specifically designed to brute force the SHA-256 function, and find nonces. These chips are unbelievably good at what they do, with even a shitty chip being a factor of 100 times faster than your standard PC. ASIC miners are used by all Bitcoin mining operations, and it's important to know the costs, and overhead before we proceed. One final thing to note, is that Bitcoin mining becomes incredibly profitable when there is a rapid price increase in Bitcoin. This is due to the \"lag\" that occurs while new Bitcoin mining hardware is being built and deployed to capture this excess profit.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nNowadays, the average [top of the line ASIC miner](https://shop.bitmain.com/product/detail?pid=00020201222165500548JAa69Gvu067A) can generate roughly 110 tera-hashes per second. That's 110 Trillion attempts at finding the nonce, *per second*.Top mining companies run a fuckload of these miners in tandem, to get a couple of thousand *peta-hashes* per seconds. For reference, one peta-hash is equal to 1000 tera-hashes, meaning that companies running at 1000 peta-hashes are actually running at one million tera hashes, per second. One million, trillion hashes per second. Fucking unreal.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAs far as we're concerned, at current day conditions, if you're mining at 1000pH/s, you're generating 4000 Bitcoins per year. Obviously, this is far from reality as global mining power will increase, but keep this number in mind, as it's important. 1000pH/s = 4000 coins mined in a year.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Midway TLDR :** Under current conditions, mining Bitcoin at a rate of 1000 peta-hashes will generate roughly 4000 Bitcoins per year. 4000 Bitcoin * $50,000 USD = $200,000,000\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n ---\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n# **__Calculating Growth and Profit Margins among Mining Companies__**\n\nNow that we've got some basic knowledge of how Bitcoin mining works, as well as the general profits we can expect from it, it's time to start crunching some raw numbers for each mining company. I will focus on the general profitability of each company, how many coins each company has the potential to mine in a given year, and how many coins does each company have on hand. In this DD, I will be providing analysis on three different mining companies; $RIOT, $MARA, and the secret dark horse, $HUT.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n ---\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n#**__$RIOT__**\n\nHas been around since July 2000 doing nothing relevant. It formally became Riot Blockchain in October 2017, and has been focused on its Bitcoin mining operations since. Riot Blockchain is now partnered with Coinmint LLC, from New York, who is responsible for operating the miners. They apparently get electricity for around $0.01/kWh, which is absurdly cheap.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n- Currently, the combined power of their entire mining operation is [456 pH/s](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/investing/markets/stocks/RIOT-Q/pressreleases/974231/). Under current conditions, they are set to mine a little under 2000 Bitcoin this year. They are waiting on a shitload of new miners to come in, which will effectively raise their hashing power to 842 pH/s at some point in Q1, and then 1446 pH/s by the start of Q2. \n\n- In December 2020, when their stock price rocketed alongside Bitcoin, they took advantage of this and ran a [secondary offering which raised $200m](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1167419/000107997320001054/riot_s3.htm). They used $35m of this money to pay for the new miners.\n\n- They hold 830 self-mined Bitcoins.\n\n- They currently have $150m in liquid assets (Cash + Bitcoin), due to the secondary offering.\n\n- $RIOT is trading at 78$ per share, with a market cap of 5.3 *billion* dollars\n\n- [Up 1800% compared to Bitcoin's 200% run](https://imgur.com/VjQTaA3)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n ---\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n# **__$MARA__**\n\nThis company is kind of a fucking fiesta. It first engaged in the exploration and development of uranium and vanadium when it was first founded in 2010, then changed its mind and started fucking with real estate in Southern California, and most recently, has started patent trolling. I have no idea *when* they started dabbling in Bitcoin, but in 2019 they ordered a shitload of miners, so we can only assume that's about the time they got into the mining business.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n- Currently, the combined power of their entire mining operation is [258 pH/s](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/investing/markets/stocks/MARA/pressreleases/1151711/). The did however, order new miners like RIOT did, and once those arrive, they'll be mining at a cool 688 pH/s. Under current speeds, they are projected to mine 1000 Bitcoin this year.\n\n- Similar to RIOT, they also did a [secondary offering in December, raising $200m](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1507605/000149315220023410/forms-3.html). With this money, they ordered even more miners.\n\n- Just last month, they ran ANOTHER secondary offering, and raised $300m. They used this money to purchase 4,800 Bitcoin at $31,000USD per coin.\n\n- As a result, MARA has 4800 Bitcoins held, fresh off the press.\n\n- Since then, they've made $90m off of their Bitcoin purchases, leaving them with roughly $240m in liquid assets.\n\n- $MARA is trading at 48$ per share, with a market cap of 4.5 *billion* dollars\n\n- [Up 1450% compared to Bitcoin's 200% run](https://imgur.com/wwzoTn6)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n ---\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n#**__$HUT__**\nHut 8 is one of Canada's oldest and largest Bitcoin miners, providing value for investors through extremely low production costs, and appreciation of Bitcoin inventory. Their mining operation is self run and located in Alberta, allowing for significantly less overhead costs due to self management, cheaper energy, and colder climates.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n- Currently, the combined power of their entire mining operation is [**1073 pH/s**](https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/hut-8-mining-bitcoin-holdings-surpass-3-012-valued-at-186m-cad-804326405.html). This puts them ahead of most other mining operations by a landslide. Similar to the others, Hut 8 is looking to expand its' mining operation by adding more miners, bringing up their total hashrate to around [1500 pH/s](https://hut8mining.com/hut-8-finalizes-11-8-million-equipment-financing-loan-from-dcg-subsidiary-foundry).\n\n- Hut 8 holds 3000 self-mined Bitcoins on hand. 17% of their entire market cap is made up solely from the Bitcoin that they hold.\n\n- Out of the 3000 coins that they hold, 1000 of them are held in a Genesis savings account, generating a 4% yield, increasing their generated revenues from Bitcoin appreciation.\n\n- Currently possess $190m in liquid assets.\n\n- $HUT is trading around 9$ per share, with a market cap of 900 million dollars.\n\n- [Up around 500% compared to Bitcoin's 200% run](https://www.tradingview.com/x/8ZOvgAju/)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n ---\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Midway TLDR #2 :** $HUT out performs $RIOT and $MARA in every metric, but is only trading at 9$ opposed to 70$ and 50$ respectively.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n ---\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n#**__So... What Gives?__**\n\nComparing Hut 8's raw numbers to Mara and Riot, it's a night and day difference. Hut 8 has an astronomically greater amount of hashing power compared to its' competitors, meaning that it generates more coins on a day to day basis. Furthermore, Hut 8 is also holding 3000 Bitcoins that it self-mined, allowing them to reap the rewards of the appreciating price of Bitcoin. Riot has less than one third that amount, and Mara has **bought** 4,800 of its' Bitcoins, meaning they literally paid (lost) money to acquire them. Furthermore, Hut 8 also has fewer expenses and a much healthier [balance sheet](https://hut8mining.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Hut-8-FS-Q3-2020-v3.pdf) overall compared to its peers. Hut 8 mines faster, holds more, and is in a much better financial state than leaders in the industry. I believe that Hut 8 is **criminally** undervalued when compared to other companies in the same sector.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n#**__Minor Factors Holding Hut 8 Back__**\n\nThere are simply two factors which I believe are holding Hut 8 back. The first of which, is the lack of publicity. Up until last week, I straight up didn't know Hut 8 even existed. Furthermore, I can guarantee you that until this post, *you* also didn't know that Hut 8 existed. Hell, the only two blockchain related tickers I knew of were $RIOT, and $MARA. Hut 8 is relatively unknown, and once the mainstream catches wind of it, it'll likely pop just as hard as its peers.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe second setback, comes from the exchange Hut 8 is traded on, the TSE. Many investors don't care to look to, or don't have access to trade on the Toronto Stock Exchange. As a result, even if they wanted to trade on the TSE, they are limited. Hut 8 also happens to trade OTC, but those exchanges are even less popular than the TSE. Regardless, since many don't have access to the TSE, they can't buy in, even if they desperately wanted to.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n#**__Hut 8 Bull Thesis and the Ultimate Catalyst__**\nRegardless of the minimal downsides, **what we have here is an awesome financial arbitrage opportunity.** A company that substantially outperforms its peers is trading at a maximum of 20% of its competitors value. Hut 8 is an absolute steal right now. Furthermore, it also hasn't run yet. It's only increased around 450% in relation to Bitcoin's 200% rise. Its peers have run 2000% and 1450% respectively, meaning Hut 8 has lots of room for growth. Hut 8 also has a hidden catalyst which could help the stock truly explode.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIt is becoming increasingly clear that it is important for Hut 8 to get listed on  the Nasdaq. The difference in liquidity between US-listed $MARA and $RIOT vs $HUT is a staggering 100x. Numerous investors would be delighted to buy into the Hut 8 story but are currently unable to do so due to liquidity concerns. Nasdaq markets are much bigger and more liquid than that of the TSE, and listing on Nasdaq will open up the floodgates in regards to demand for the stock. In addition, listing on the Nasdaq will greatly enhance Hut 8\u2019s visibility and brand among US and international investors. A Nasdaq listing would be the ultimately catalyst for Hut 8, as more people would know about it, *and* more people would invest in it. There have been some rumblings and rumors about a Nasdaq uplisting for Hut 8, but  when asked, Hut 8 officials vehemently ignore all remarks.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n ---\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n#**__Bitcoin Bear Thesis__**\nWe've come to the point in the DD where the music stops, and the rainbows fade. Sure, as undervalued as Hut 8 is compared to its' peers, we still need to remember, that we're talking about Bitcoin mining companies. These companies are fundamentally dogshit. You're literally paying the executive team of RIOT/MARA/HUT to buy an ASIC miner, plug it in, and sell any Bitcoin for you. That's fuckin' it. You could literally do what these guys do by yourself. You're literally paying a premium to indirectly get exposure to Bitcoin. Long term, and as far as future earnings go, this play is likely a loser. Unfortunately, the market doesn't care for the fundamentals, and we can exploit it. Bitcoin has passed $50k, and the narrative says that its going to $100k. It's all sunshine and rainbows.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nRemember earlier in the article, when I said that as Bitcoin price goes up, mining becomes VERY profitable? As a result, there is, and always will be a rush to deploy more hardware. This is literally proven by the order book of the above companies. Remember 2017? When Bitcoin ran from 4,000 to 20,000 in a matter of months? The total overall hash-rate only increased by about 60%, compared to the 500% increase in the coin itself. Wonderful stuff. Can you guess what happened after? Hash-rate went up an astronomical [681%](https://www.blockchain.com/charts/difficulty) over the course of the following months, decimating profit margins as new miners were produced and deployed.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI'm not trying to sound all doom and gloom like the world is ending, but I also don't want any of you to get caught with your pants around your ankles.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n ---\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n#**__Conclusion__**\nAlthough I dislike this sector with a passion, I enjoy making free money enough to look past it. Compared to its' peers, Hut 8 is criminally undervalued. It does everything its' competitors do, only better, and it does it all while maintaining a better balance sheet. Furthermore, the \"blockchain\" sector is on fucking fire, with retail euphoria, and institutional money flowing in like a river. This presents us with an incredibly unique financial arbitrage situation, similar to what the homie Warren Buffet used to do back in the 1600s or someshit. Buy Hut 8, hold it, and wait for the mainstream media to catch wind of it to cash in on your tendies. Make sure you have a solid exit strategy in place, cause when the music stops, it's gonna be a bloodbath.

I love you all, and I wish you all bountiful gains.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n ---\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n**TLDR**\n\n$HUT presents us with a minimal risk financial arbitrage opportunity. It is criminally undervalued compared to its peers, while doing everything its' competitors can do, but better. It currently trades on the TSE and OTC markets, but there's talks about it being uplisted to the NASDAQ, where it will explode in popularity and exposure, resulting in its price inflating to RIOT/MARA levels.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**__TLDR of TLDR :__** Buy $HUT on the TSE or $HUTMF on OTC markets. No, it doesn't have options. Yes, you can still count on a modest 400% return.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n ---\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**__Sources__**\n\n\u2022 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_nonce\n\n\u2022 https://www.blockchain.com/charts/hash-rate\n\n\u2022 https://www.theglobeandmail.com/investing/markets/stocks/RIOT-Q/pressreleases/974231/\n\n\u2022 https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1167419/000107997320001054/riot_s3.htm\n\n\u2022 https://imgur.com/VjQTaA3\n\n\u2022 https://www.theglobeandmail.com/investing/markets/stocks/MARA/pressreleases/1151711/\n\n\u2022 https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1507605/000149315220023410/forms-3.htm\n\n\u2022 https://imgur.com/wwzoTn6\n\n\u2022 https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/hut-8-mining-bitcoin-holdings-surpass-3-012-valued-at-186m-cad-804326405.html\n\n\u2022 https://hut8mining.com/hut-8-finalizes-11-8-million-equipment-financing-loan-from-dcg-subsidiary-foundry\n\n\u2022 https://www.tradingview.com/x/8ZOvgAju/\n\n\u2022 https://hut8mining.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Hut-8-FS-Q3-2020-v3.pdf\n\n\u2022 https://www.blockchain.com/charts/difficulty\n\n\u2022 https://hut8mining.com/",

        "selftext": "This is my first DD post on any company, be gentle.\n\nDisclaimer: I am long RKT. This is not financial advice, and I am not receiving any compensation whatsoever from anyone for this post. I\u2019m not a professional, I\u2019m not even an amateur, this is a Wendy\u2019s.\n\nSources used: RKT investor relations website and company website, RKT earnings transcripts, SEC fillings, the SEC EDGAR database, sea king al pha, whalewisdom, finbox, yahoo finance, stockcharts, openinsider, Zacks, google sheets.\n\n\u200b\n\nSummary\n\nRocket Companies (RKT) is a fintech company that operates several brands including the flagship Rocket Mortgage. I think RKT presents an opportunity to buy serious value at a cheap price, because the market has not priced in the underlying fact that RKT is a tech company akin to Square, Paypal, etc.\n\nRKT has disrupted the lending industry and has embraced a fully digital ecosystem, which will continue to drive customer acquisition and retention in the future\nRKT spends considerable money and resources on UX/UI development, client experience, and marketing. This will also help drive their continued expansion into the lending market.\nThe RKT \u201cecosystem\u201d provides a \u201cfull cycle\u201d solution for everything related to real estate transactions and insurance. They serve real estate professionals looking to generate leads, develop those leads, better serve their clients, and make every stage of real estate transactions smoother. From the client side, they similarly just make everything easier - it\u2019s an app, it\u2019s online, it\u2019s doable from home and it\u2019s not complicated. There\u2019s an inherent advantage in what they\u2019re doing here because closing on real estate transactions has always been something that\u2019s complex, unpleasant, expensive, and not well understood. You need lawyers, you need agents, there\u2019s a ton of paperwork, it sucks. RKT is changing all of that.\nRKTs balance sheet, income, and liabilities support a stock price several times higher than the current one in my opinion.\nRKT is currently stagnant in price, and the market appears to be pricing it like a traditional mortgage company, not a rapidly growing tech company (which they are).\nRKT has been around for decades (skips the startup costs that will provide barrier to entry for newer companies looking to do what they\u2019re doing), but somehow seems to still be leading the tech charge in the industry. That\u2019s a unique and potent combination in my opinion.\nRKT needs a catalyst to get the market to value it as a tech company instead of a lending company. Once that happens, and I expect it to sometime within the next year, RKT should approach an appropriate valuation such as 20x earnings. That\u2019s an estimate I pulled out of nowhere, but is commensurate with the low end of P/E ratios for companies I see as similar to RKT.\nKey Point - RKT is Priced Like a Legacy Mortgage Company\n\nThe average estimate for 2020 year end revenue is $15 billion, and the yearly earnings estimate average is $3.85 per share.\n\nThis estimate gives a ttm P/E ratio of just over 5.5. The sector median is something like 8-12, which makes RKT cheaply valued relative to the earnings it produces, even compared to the financial/mortgage sector. What\u2019s key here is, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s really an appropriate comparison. I would place them more in line with companies like Square (ttm P/E ratio of 325x lol), PayPal (ttm P/E ratio of 69x, nice), or Fiserv (ttm P/E ratio of 24x). I used Zacks for all of these P/E ratio lookups.\n\nLet\u2019s assume RKT is conservatively worth 15x earnings, and that it hits the estimate of $3.85 eps. That would put its fair value right now at $57.75 per share. I think it\u2019s worth more than that but, we all should do well to remember that it\u2019s really only worth whatever the market will pay for it.\n\nKey Point - Catalysts\n\nThis thing needs a catalyst. Right now I am loading up. I\u2019m buying shares, I\u2019m selling SHORT TERM covered calls to reduce basis on those shares, but I will be stopping the sale of those covered calls within a couple weeks most likely. The Q4 earnings announcement will be on 2/25. I am not sure that the actual earnings numbers will be enough to wake this thing up, although I expect them to be good. But if that announcement comes with discussion of their focus for 2021 and beyond, and gets the market thinking about them as a tech company first and mortgage lending company second, things will start to heat up. I don\u2019t know when the real catalyst will hit that triggers the run-up, but I think it could start with the Q4 earnings call. I am looking at $21 as the floor for this stock, and I expect the price to double within a year. I will be acquiring OTM LEAPs, expiring next spring.\n\nSupporting information and background follows.\n\nThe Business\n\nRKT is in the business of providing solutions to financial transactions, including mortgage origination and refinancing, auto lending, and more. Specific subsidiaries and my simplistic view of how they interact:\n\nHome Financing\n\nRocket Mortgage - The mortgage company. This is a prominent \u201cpublic facing\u201d part of the Rocket ecosystem.\nAmrock - Amrock provides title insurance, property valuations, and other solutions. I see this as \u201csupporting infrastructure\u201d to keep clients within the rocket ecosystem where they would otherwise need to go elsewhere and is part of what makes RKT a one-stop-shop.\nAmrock Title Insurance (ATI) Company - basically does underwriting for Amrock. The \u201cbusiness end\u201d in my simple understanding of the world.\nNexsys - provides a streamlined approach to the closing process with their Clear Sign and Clear HOI technologies - taking care of closing day authentications and sharing of homeowners insurance information.\nLendesk - Lendesk specifically provides solutions for the mortgage market in Canada\nEdison Financial - Basically the \u201cfront end\u201d of Lendesk that Canadian clients would interact with.\nHome Sale and Search\n\nRocket Homes - Rocket Homes is a proprietary home search platform and real estate agent referral network. Basically this matches buyers, sellers, and agents, and is a key aspect of keeping clients completely working within RKT for all aspects of real estate buying/selling/financing.\nFor Sale By Owner - A digital marketplace designed to let clients buy and sell real estate on their own. I think it\u2019s absolutely brilliant that RKT owns this, but more on that later.\nAuto &amp; Personal Financing\n\nRocket Auto - Supports rental and online car purchasing platforms.\nRocket Loans - online personal loan solutions for clients.\nMedia\n\nCore Digital Media - a major advertiser in the mortgage, financial, insurance, and education sectors.\nLower My Bills - this company is basically a \u201cportal\u201d business model that connects people with providers of various loan and insurance products.\nServices &amp; Technology Development\n\nRock Connections - Basically a sales and support platform that handles appointments, prequalifications, generating leads, and data analysis among other things.\nRock Central - I will generalize this as \u201cbusiness support\u201d. HR, administration, etc.\nRocket Innovation Studio - A tech incubator to gather and engage top talent and ideas.\nRecent Acquisitions\n\nRKT, through Lendesk, acquired Finmo back in October of 2020 (https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rocket-companies-subsidiary-acquires-fast-182042594.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAALnvnNBoglSnmMP0O61AqgXBJokNS53LjJYuG3NvYKhayp4I6ZH2RpfmFUbSsCAU4xmnBNGMTwiEG-Ly29EabVy1-OjPIGfkYoQ3389gn3Edebs9sIwWOy1tPzqjRwOwwGA_PWg0cNzEFCe7HBTilMwADUT_y0QxWw8vizWecGcv) Finmo is a rapidly growing Canadian digital mortgage platform and this acquisition I think was perfect - it shows RKTs dedication to embracing a fully digital experience, and making sure they\u2019re the ones leading that charge.\n\nManagement\n\nI do not have much to say here, aside from this. The RKT team is not the new kids on the block, they have decades of industry experience. Also, I value leaders that make people feel valued. And on that note, under CEO Jay Farner Quicken Loans has been in the top 30 of Fortune\u2019s \u201c100 Best Companies to Work For\u201d list for 17 consecutive years.\n\nFinancials and Growth\n\nWhen it comes to the numbers, RKT is killing it. I don\u2019t want to just spout a bunch of numbers that anyone can easily go look up so here\u2019s a couple that stood out to me from the Q3 earnings announcement and related data:\n\n$4.63 billion in revenue, which is 163% YoY growth.\n\nFrom that revenue, they beat EPS estimates with $1.21 for the quarter vs $1.09 expected.\n\nNet income was $2.4 billion which represents a YoY growth of 365%.\n\nClosed loan volume YoY growth was 122% to $89B.\n\nNet rate lock volume was $94.7 Billion (101% growth).\n\nRKT has brought in $13.1 billion in revenue in the first 3 quarters and seems to be on track to close out Q4 with yearly revs above $15 billion.\n\nThat\u2019s awesome but what I really like is that they pair this amazing growth with $3.5B cash on hand. That\u2019s great because I want them to be able to scale as they grow, and make acquisitions as needed (see Finmo) to ensure they can keep that growth going without getting overextended and failing to capitalize.\n\nRKTs ability to recapture clients is one of the keys to their future success in my uneducated opinion. Their recapture rate is 4.6x the industry average. The Q3 earnings transcript includes a statement by the CEO on how when interest rates fall, retention rate falls, refinance activity is larger. The high recapture rate RKT has serves as a natural hedge to their retention of existing clients because their recapture is so much higher than average in the industry.\n\nQuick aside - RKT announced a $1 billion share buyback program. They\u2019ll be able to repurchase shares from time to time starting Nov10 2020, ending in two years. I don\u2019t love the idea of share buybacks because I think this can be detrimental to actual business growth for the sake of shareholder value. However, with the large cash position RKT has (and it doubled from December 2019 to September 2020) I think this is a reasonable way to deploy some of that cash for now.\n\nOk so what about valuation using DCF, free cash flow analysis, something like that? Honestly I\u2019m not convinced this is as useful as some people make it out to be. It\u2019s nice to know what the numbers indicate, but I don\u2019t spend a lot of time worrying about an exact price target based on anything like this. That said, you can crunch the numbers yourself or check out something like the Finbox resources:\n\nhttps://finbox.com/NYSE:RKT/models/dcf-growth-exit-5yr\n\nI don\u2019t believe that fair value estimate for an instant, but it's a part of the puzzle to consider. Finbox has various models you can check out, but it\u2019s also just a nice place to view aggregate data other than directly from the SEC filings.\n\nProduct Channels\n\nRKTs direct-to-consumer channel is their main source of revenue right now, but I think they will be successful in their efforts to grow their partner channels as well. Why do I say that? Numbers don\u2019t lie:\n\nDirect-to-consumer Q3 growth: 131% YoY ($53.5B closed loan volume)\nPartner Network growth 127% YoY ($29.6B closed volume)\nAdjusted Revenue for Partner Network is up 502% YTD vs 2019 ( see Q3 earnings transcript)\nThe partner network volume is a little over half of the direct-to-consumer volume but the growth rate is just so damn juicy. That revenue growth is hellathicc.\n\nCurrent Market and outlook\n\nRight now, rates are low. The average 30-yr mortgage fixed rate is 2.92% (https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/03/mortgage-refinancing-surges-but-high-home-prices-stop-buyers.html)\n\nI cannot say how long interest rates will remain low but I believe RKT is positioned to continue to grow regardless of what rates do moving forward. They just cover so much of the space, and they do it with a focus on applied technology.\n\nHere\u2019s some blatant speculation. I think as we move into 2021 and the vaccine becomes more prevalent, millennials will buy, sell, and borrow against real estate with renewed intensity. I think RKT is uniquely positioned to capture that market.\n\nPositions: RKT shares. Cost basis of $21.14.",

        "selftext": "By roll on, I mean knock out of the fucking park.\n\n\nHere\u2019s some DD for anybody who doesn\u2019t eat breath and sleep only GME.\n\n\neBay, like most other online retailers, are going to have ludicrous numbers in this last quarter due to the holiday season. That\u2019s just a given. \n\n\nI am an experienced eBay seller who on a weekly basis for the last few years, sells around 15-20 items. The last few months was ridiculous. Items which were posted that would have around 10 bids and 5-15 watchers, would have 25-30 with 20+ bids. The views on each item was double to tripe from early November until pretty much the last two weeks. \n\n\nLots of volume, lots of selling, lots of 10% commissions for eBay. Now we all saw what happened with Apple, posting 100+ Billion in revenue this last earnings report and being down 3% the next day. That shit happens, I\u2019m not a psychic with a magic ball. If the market is tanking, the market is tanking. Look at it this week. But I will say this, the volume on eBay isn\u2019t why I\u2019m going fucking hard in the calls. Here\u2019s the real cherry on top:\n\neBay has now finally implemented a payment policy they have been working on for a long time. Every single one of my sales went through PayPal, along with everybody else. Every single god damn transaction PayPal got their dirty little claws into. Since I think like the beginning of eBay, it\u2019s just been a given that they give PayPal millions of dollars every month to run their transactions.\n\n\nWell guess what you mother fucker. Shit had changed. Since they have now implemented their STRAIGHT TO BANK ACCOUNT POLICY, PayPal doesn\u2019t even exist. The money goes, you guessed it, straight to your account. They even have their own return feature which they deal with themselves now, instead of putting funds into hold on PayPal. eBay allows you to chose when you get paid and in what frequency. For example, I have mine setup for each Tuesday of every week. \n\nThis is going to and has already saved them MILLIONS in fees. Papa Musk has already moved on from PayPal, it\u2019s time we do the same.\n\n\nOh, did I mention all the new payment platforms introduced as well? I bought a Pok\u00e9mon card the other day without gay as shit PayPal but through god damn Apple Pay. It was way too easy. You can also link credit cards, bank accounts, whatever. It\u2019s 2021.\n\n\neBay posts earnings in a few days, Wednesday after close. Do what you want. If the stock goes down, call me a retard and make fun of me. If the stock goes up, fuck off and thank me later. Look at what it did today. I\u2019ll probably sell a third of my calls on Wednesday for an IV hedge as well. Play at your own risk. \n\n\nTLDR; My positions are eBay CALL 05/FEB/21 60CALL , 62CALL and 65CALL",

All 3 of them finished the week down more than 3% as the [VIX](https://ibb.co/cgz4N3r) spiked yet again on Friday, rising by almost 10% and finishing the week up more than 40%.\n\nWe saw over 70% of the companies declining [Friday](https://ibb.co/G3rX22D), as the number of companies trading above the 50-day moving average dropped under 50%, with all 11 [sectors](https://ibb.co/HKhY6hC) finishing in the red again, as Energy &amp; Tech were the biggest losers. \n\nSo, let\u2019s take a look at the HEAT MAP from [Friday](https://ibb.co/jVFqVbH). It\u2019s really hard to find any gaining companies, with big tech companies selling off yet again, as most of the small gainers were found in the Health Care sector. For the [WEEK](https://ibb.co/5Y5HR4q)  though, Microsoft was the only big tech name that managed to gain ground after smashing the earnings report, while most of the stock market faced sell-off pressures as the short squeeze mania might have pushed investors into a risk-off approach.\n\nWe also got some economic data on Friday as the December personal disposable [INCOME](https://ibb.co/Khyh7mP) increase by 0.6%, more than expected as this mostly reflected an increase in social benefits &amp; compensations, with the Q4 employment cost [INDEX](https://ibb.co/QcqbM5y) also rising by 0.7% to close out the year.\n\nMeanwhile we saw the Consumer Sentiment [INDEX](https://ibb.co/pX3mFgt) coming in at 79, slightly lower than expected, as this was also seen in the December pending home sales [NUMBER](https://ibb.co/m4tbnWN), which also came in with a 0.3% decrease month/month.\n\nThis week we have somewhat of a quiet economic [CALENDAR](https://ibb.co/LvYY84v), with a couple of interesting numbers through the week, while [EARNINGS](https://ibb.co/rxmpwVK) take center stage yet again, with interesting reports coming from companies like Amazon, Google &amp; Alibaba on Tuesday, while Wednesday we hear from PayPal, Qualcomm &amp; Spotify. We also get earnings reports from some recent favorites like Pinterest, Snap, Ford, Peloton and Penn on Thursday as the earnings season with over 100 companies from the SP500 reporting, might help push the stock market higher after the sell-off last week.\n\nIn some other stock market news, we saw [NIO](https://ibb.co/C0CSdJJ) reporting a new monthly record with 7225 vehicles delivered in the first month of 2021\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80, an increase of more than 350% Y/Y as the company is still ramping up production in an attempt to challenge Tesla\u2019s EV dominance. Nio has had a huge run in the past months but has a long way to go to grow into the big valuation, though the trajectory of the company looks very promising.\n\nMeanwhile the biggest development in the markets was the trading platforms [imposing](https://ibb.co/y5sPVJv) restrictions on the squeezed stocks and even many other stocks that didn\u2019t have such a big short % of the float with big names like AMD, Starbucks &amp; Moderna being affected. These restrictions were reduced back to only 8 companies [Sunday](https://ibb.co/GV5TKxf), but are still limited to whole share aggregate buy limits on the crowd favorites\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80.\n\nThe recent moves in the stock market have made some big changes in the social world as Steve Cohen deactivate his [Twitter](https://ibb.co/0KK2P59) \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80, while a recent [survey](https://ibb.co/Mf6V8tz) showed that more than \u00be of respondents are planning on leaving RBNHD while 13% already did it, with the limiting tactics being probably the biggest reason for retail investors to make this change.\n\nInteractive [Brokers](https://ibb.co/JzR5qCC) also re-opened trading on these names on Sunday, which brings to question if these platforms have insider knowledge of the future of the stocks, or did they just increased their liquidity just like [RBNHD](https://ibb.co/P6WXwDj) after they raised more than $1B earlier in the week.\n\nSo\u2026 I think the stock market is still very volatile and the short squeezes can keep on going for an unknown period of time as markets can act in an unusual pattern for longer than anyone can anticipate, or the short squeeze can vanish in a second\u2026 this one is very hard to predict\u2026 Yes, keep the pedal to the medal in the hot stocks\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 but also stay invested in great companies as good earnings reports haven\u2019t helped most stocks again this quarter, but may provide good buying opportunities for the long-term.\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nAnd finally, let\u2019s hope for a good day in the markets as the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/wc2P16r) are pointing to a good open with the Nasdaq leading the way as we await to see the Manufacturing Indexes numbers in the early [morning](https://ibb.co/LvYY84v).\n\n**Thank you everyone for reading\ud83d\ude4f Hope you enjoyed the content!

        "selftext": "Previously, I've made my case for Fiverr, a company for freelancers, only last week. Since my recommendation, the stock has grown from 270 to 320 as time of writing. That's an \\~20% increase. I believe the future of work will also be 'online' as opposed to traditional 'in office'. The last year, the coronavirus has only accelerated the shift to online-work.\n\nI now propose another stock, PayPal. What's my reasoning for this?  When you look at growth stocks, you also look at their suppliers.  For Tesla, for example, you look at who's supplying the batteries for electric cars and can bet on that as well.   The rise of Tesla and electric cars has created a halo effect, and the rise in their stocks for all of the industry.  \n\nNow, when you think of Fiverr, and the rise of companies based on online work, payment processing companies will benefit.  When you transact with freelancers half way across the world, we are looking at payment processing companies that serve as a method of  payment for your transaction.  The likes of Visa, Mastercard, and Paypal stand to benefit. Why specifically PayPal? \n\nBasically not only will PayPal stand to benefit from increased transactions as outlined above,  Paypal also looking to get into anything related to digital payments.  To quote,  PayPal has jumped into the mobile payments space with Venmo, which is now the most widely used mobile peer-to-peer payments app out there.  PayPal has also delved into cryptocurrencies, and now accepts cryptos on its payment platform. What\u2019s more, the payments company is also jumping into more direct shopping and stock trading. \n\nBasically, it\u2019s doing it all.  PayPal is turning into an all-in-one digital wallet for consumers. They are looking at doubling it's user-base and hence revenues.  It's parallel is Alibaba's Ant Financial. It's massive in China, and before the Chinese government clamped down on the IPO, it was looking to the biggest IPO in all history.\n\nIf you are looking to place a blue-chip stock in your portfolio, I believe Paypal will the next best bet.",

This change may open merchants up to new customers who are already flocking to digital assets,\" Mastercard said.\n\nMastercard specified that not all cryptocurrencies will be supported on its network, adding that many of the hundreds of digital assets in circulation still need to tighten their compliance measures.\n\nMany cryptocurrencies have struggled to win the trust of mainstream investors and the general public due to their speculative nature and potential for money laundering.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-crypto-currency-mastercard/mastercard-to-open-up-network-to-select-cryptocurrencies-idUSKBN2AA2WF?il=0](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-crypto-currency-mastercard/mastercard-to-open-up-network-to-select-cryptocurrencies-idUSKBN2AA2WF?il=0)",

        "selftext": "1 Transportation and Delivery\n\nTransportation and delivery stocks took a hit last March when the disruption of pandemic came. Almost one year later they have recovered strongly. Staying at home and working from home have created unprecedented demand for transportation and delivery of goods via vehicles on highways. As the vaccination looms and the economy reopens, the demand might drop, but the habits nurtured during the pandemic could linger for quite a while. I am still cautious about airline stocks; air travel is still far from recovering even 1/3 of what it was before the pandemic and I won\u2019t make a move until the volume reaches about 1/2 . \n\nLooking at: PAG, KSU, UPS, FDX, UBER, UNP\n\n======\n\n2 More traditional/\u201d big players\u201d financial stocks\n\nI have opened another post asking for advice, so I will just be copying and pasting:\n\nFintech stocks and ETFs are popular on the market nowadays and I\u2019ve reaped quite some profits from ARKF, PYPL, SQ, V, virtual currency ETFs e.t.c. But now I am eyeing in on the more traditional/big Wall Street players like Citibank, JPM, Morgan Stanley, Goldman e.t.c. All flaws and blames and crooked behaviors aside, they are still the biggest players in the financial market nowadays and the establishment can\u2019t be overwhelmed by a few Reddit short squeezes. I am trying to observe if these stocks could sort of \"recover\" from the shock and respond to the innovative trend.\n\nThere\u2019s also another realm of more diversified asset management player such as CG, BX, BLK, NTRS e.t.c. It seems the pandemic has a very strong asset/wealth reallocation effects and the wealthiest that could afford to have their assets managed by these players are doing well. These institutions also typically have quite established footings in emerging markets such as Asia and South America in both government and private businesses. CG has recently published a pleasant Q4 2020 report and their stocks climbed. I am waiting to see if BX, BLK and NTRS would follow suit.\n\nLooking at: JPM, BX, BLK, NTRS, CG, BAM\n\n======\n\n3 Military and Defense\n\nThe mainstream media tries hard to paint a layer of peaceful color to the new administration, but tensions around the globe won\u2019t just disappear. The US military has quite a few major contracts for new weapon systems delivery coming up, and US arms sales to allies could increase as many of them are located at the forefronts of tensions (Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Saudi, India e.t.c).\n\nLooking at: LDOS, LMT, GD, NOC, BA (more for its military contracts rather than for commercial airplanes)\n\n======\n\n4 Tech Infrastructures\n\nWith everything shifting to online platform, Tech stocks (IT, cloud computing, semiconductors e.t.c.) have done well in 2020. I am in MSFT and TSM, and I just want to take a look at stocks that offer a more infrastructural exposure to the tech advancements, such as base towers for 5G, solutions for cloud computing and online platforms, workstations, hardware production e.t.c.\n\nLooking at: CCI, AMT, CSCO, MSI, ERIC\n\n======\n\n5 Virtual Currency\n\nI am not a big fan of virtual currencies so far, and it might be a bit late to enter the game. but nobody could deny the soaring prices of every major virtual currency, and I certainly don\u2019t mind to ride the bandwagon and get a few extra bucks. \n\nLooking at: BLOK, KOIN",

        "selftext": "Been holding $135 leap calls since $92, playing weeklies for the short term trades, and it\u2019s only gonna get better as it has for me. Here\u2019s a little of my own DD.\n\nThere is So much to talk about. But, the First Data deal made Fiserv a powerhouse in payment processing and digital payments when they took over Clover. This market has three main pillars:\nPoint of sales (POS) terminals\nPeer-to-peer (P2P) payments\nE-commerce solutions\n  Being a leader in any one of these categories should make Fiserv a $100 billion company. Its current value is $70 billion. But Fiserv is now the largest POS provider and P2P payment processor... And the company is going to use its expansive network to quickly build out its new omnichannel e-commerce solution.\nA leader in all three of these categories has the potential to be well over a $300 billion company. FISV is partnered with Zelle, does more payments than PYPL\u2019s Venmo and SQ  CashApp. PYPL has a market cap of 278 billion as of last Friday. If FISV can get to $100 billion it should put its PT at $150 and that\u2019s very low ball. Their margins are going to continue to grow and if they just matched PYPL market cap, it would put them over $300 a share. There are several potential catalysts as far as buy backs, earnings, etc. \n\nAs I mentioned above, Clover is bigger than Square, yet is only part of FISV business, and the two go after different markets. Clover (generally) works with bigger businesses. Over 90% of Clover customers process over $125,000 in payments annually. Only 65% of Square\u2019s customers transact that much. Not trying to bash SQ, only showing that FISV has a lot of catching up to do as it is still trailing SQ market cap by 30 Billion. \n\nThe difference between Zelle and PYPL\u2019s Venmo and SQ (cash app) is that Zelle is backed by multiple large institutions like Chase, Wells Fargo, U.S. Bank, and Capital One. The traditional financial institutions basically joined together to build a network so they wouldn\u2019t be outdone by the likes of Venmo or Cash App. The advantage is that all of the financial institutions involved\nin Zelle are marketing the P2P service to their customers and it\u2019s only going to grow. Fintech will be one of the hottest sectors going forward and FISV will be the leader. No reason why FISV isn\u2019t at least $150-200 by EOY. Earnings 2/9. Don\u2019t miss this undervalued STRONG company.",

They use a credit card (or other payment method) to pay airbnb, a payment gateway facilitates payment acceptance. The payment is then processed and Airbnb ends up with the money from the transaction. Airbnb has now gathered cash through its acquirers (e.g., Adyen, ACI). Airbnb now needs to distribute funds to its SMB sellers. Airbnb uses payoneer to disburse funds to sellers. From this example, you can see Payoneer isn't competing with companies like Adyen or other acquirers/ processors, even though they are processing payments. \n\nPayoneer signs up individual sellers, which allows the sellers to use payoneer across platforms (e.g., facebook marketplace and amazon). Hyperwallet (owned by PayPal) is one of their competitors, but Hyperwallet operates completely differently, they sign up users via the platform, but this means you can't use hyperwallet for your business on both amazon and fb marketplace without going through the onboarding process again. Given the trend towards SMB sellers operating across multiple marketplaces, this is a huge benefit for payoneer, and makes PayPal's offering a lot less competitive. It also means Payoneer owns the seller relationship in a way that PayPal doesn't do as effectively, and makes it easier for them to package other offerings (e.g., working capital). These other offerings provide a two-fold benefit - their customer relationships become stronger, so revenue is seen as more recurring and investors will pay a higher multiple; and they'll make more money per customer. \n\nMy view is that Payoneer should see an S-type growth curve, where they'll hit a critical mass of users and see exponential growth, like cashapp, or venmo. Their investor presentation projects 25% revenue growth over the next couple years, I think this is super conservative, especially considering that 25% growth rate doesn't account for the two travel related marketplaces that got screwed by covid. Once they hit that critical mass of users, they'll pop off, sales &amp; marketing expenses will drop, and they'll become profitable.",

        "selftext": "Hello all!\n\nTest flight has been delay...so what? This is a long play.

This \"failed\" test flight proved that the fail safes in place are functioning and convinced long term holders to enter. One has to wonder if this flight purposely didn't succeed to change the fear and narrative regarding a fatal launch.\n\nFollowing this incident, there was a rather large decline in the price followed by a massive uptick where the price now floats between $50-60. \n\n**February 13 2021:** [The test flight was delayed](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/12/virgin-galactic-spce-shares-drop-as-company-delays-upcoming-spaceflight-test.html), and we saw an 8-9% drop on Friday due to that news. The news hit after hours and the market is closed today. It's hard to say if the price will continue falling this week or how the market will react to this. I follow the 3 days rule allowing news to circulate before assuming anything is complete. \n\n**February 2021:** I have heard rumors from other posts that a spokeswoman announced the test flight is still predicted to happen within the month of February. If someone could confirm or deny this that would be fantastic.\n\n**Q1 2021:** The [Q3 Earnings Presentation](https://s24.q4cdn.com/816362521/files/doc_financials/Quarterly/2020/q3/Virgin-Galactic-Q3-2020-Earnings-Presentation.pdf) outlines the plans that remain the same but are now pushed back. We are waiting on three flights before this gets really insane:\n\n1. This upcoming test flight will be the first spaceflight from Spaceport America, NM. It will be a revenue generating flight carrying NASA payloads, there will be no passengers (just the two pilots), and it will complete the data needed for FAA V&amp;amp;amp;V elements.\n2. The second test flight from Spaceport America will have two pilots and four employees in the cabin. \n3. The third test flight will be carrying Sir Richard Branson himself to space marking the start of commercial operations and PR. (I think it's likely this flight doesn't take place until Q2)\n\nOnce Branson goes up (presumably sometime in Q2 even though they are still claiming Q1) and commercial operations begin the 600+ individuals who have already purchased tickets will begin their flights. [Here is a list of some noteworthy celebrities who will be flying shortly after Branson.](https://www.thetravel.com/ashton-kutcher-and-19-other-celebs-going-to-space-before-you-are/) The amount of PR that will come from this is astounding. Imagine if Rhianna or Bieber record a music video up there? Or if Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis share a kiss or renew their vows in space? Even without these major kind of events, the PR from celebrities posting videos of them going up period is mind-boggling. \n\n**Surviving to 2025:**\n\nThis is all well and good, Space Tourism is a huge market waiting to be tapped that both Jeff Bezos (Blue Origin) and Elon Musk (SpaceX) are attempting to break into. Blue Origin is a director competitor in the space tourism sector as they will be providing a similar experience to sub-orbit. SpaceX is an indirect competitor because as it stands their space tourism will be orbital space, we are talking like a week long multi-million dollar vacation. \n\nCurrently, SPCE has one Space Plane and their second one is almost complete. They are predicting $1BN/spaceport/year.\n\nThere are other revenue streams such as running NASA payloads, scientists, data collection, and astronaut training as well. \n\nGiven that Virgin Galactic has this revenue plus $742 million as of September 30, 2020; I feel it is safe to say they will not have trouble surviving until 2025, in fact, it appears they will be quite profitable until that date.\n\n**Beyond 2025:**\n\n[Ark claims hypersonic point-to-point travel could evolve into a $270BN market](https://ark-invest.com/articles/analyst-research/hypersonic-flight-market/). Virgin Galactic is certainly leading the charge in this industry with Boeing, Rolls Royce, and NASA helping this come to fruition. Let's play with this number for a little:\n\nVirgin Galactic Shares Outstanding: 234.34M\n\nMarket cap of Hypersonic Travel: $270BN\n\nLet's make 3 assumptions, SPCE is the first and has 100% of the market, SPCE and SpaceX arrive at the same time and share 50/50 of the market, a lot happens over the next several years and SPCE has 20% of this market.\n\n1. SPCE has 100% of the market: $1152.17/share\n2. SPCE has 50% of the market: $576.09/share\n3. SPCE has 20% of the market: $230.42/share\n\nWhat's fascinating is even in the worst case scenario in this discussion we are looking at a 320.47% increase in price on hypersonic travel alone. That is very important to note. None of this includes the revenue generated elsewhere including the starting stream of space tourism.\n\nLet's look at Space Tourism, [the predicted market cap is $3BN](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/26/space-tourism-how-spacex-virgin-galactic-blue-origin-axiom-compete.html), which truthfully I find terribly undervalued. \n\nIf we account for hypersonic travel, space tourism, NASA payloads, gov't contracts, etc then my PT by 2025 is a $500 minimum. \n\n**Beyond 2030:**\n\n**Sci-Fi isn't really Sci-Fi anymore...it's just Sci:**\n\nThe possibilities of this company are about as boundless as space itself. Let's talk about some other future revenue streams that will be possible.\n\n1. Cargo transportation. If you thought 2-day delivery was imagine if cargo can be delivered anywhere on the planet in 90 minutes or less. Specifically time-sensitive cargo; something like a heart for a transplant or a vaccination that needs to arrive asap. We are long past the days of delivery via dog sled. Weather won't be a concern as these flights will take place ABOVE the weather.\n2. Military use - I mean the only difference between Virgin Galactic's space plane and something out of Star Wars is weaponry. I don't see why they wouldn't mount weapons and sell these space crafts to the Space Force. Think SpaceX is the main carrier and this space planes can launch from there.\n3. Interplanetary travel - Self landing rockets are all the hype, but what if a large carrier could orbit around a planet and send planes down for recon? They wouldn't need to use any fuel or anything to land so all their fuel could be used to relaunch back into space where they are grabbed by an arm on the carrier and pulled back in for refueling. The only thing that would be required is a place to land.\n4. Hypersonic travel - I already mentioned this but I need to emphasize how incredibly important this actually is. The airplane was invented in 1903 and for the past 118 years it has remained the fastest and most effective way for humans to travel. This industry is due for a revolution and I think this is it. I imagine when hypersonic first starts it will be akin to private jets regarding cost and public availability. But as the industry expands I think this will become the common way for humans to travel. Instead of airplanes and airports, it will be space planes and space ports.\n5. The list goes on and on and I don't want to speculate too far into the future of all the possibilities.\n\n**One thing is certain, the Space Age is upon us:**\n\nWhile there are many companies emerging in this market it is a HUGE market with near limitless potential. Virgin Galactic and SpaceX are leading the charge in these sectors. Companies like Momentus will be important to the industry as well, but the pioneers of this age are clear.\n\n**Let's Talk Technology:**\n\n[VMS Eve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VMS_Eve) is the name of the [WhiteKnightTwo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scaled_Composites_White_Knight_Two) mothership which is a custom aircraft. It looks like two airplanes attached together. [SpaceShipTwo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceShipTwo) is the space plane that attaches to the mothership. VMS Eve takes off like a normal airplane and ascends to 50,000 feet before releasing SpaceShipTwo. The boosters on SpaceShipTwo ignite and the space plane ascends 51.4 miles above the earths surface breaking into space (sub-orbit) where it conducts a slow backflip which creates microgravity (something NASA desperately wants to study). This is where the passengers become weightless in the cabin for 6 minutes. [The cabin](https://blog.dupontregistry.com/the-lifestyle/virgin-galactic-spaceships-cabin-interior-revealed/) has more windows than any other space craft and contains 16 cameras which will record the entire event. Once the backflip is complete the space plane re-enters the Earth's atmosphere and glides to land like a normal airplane. \n\nRegarding hypersonic point-to-point travel; last year Virgin Galactic and Rolls Royce [unveiled the Mach 3 design](https://www.virgingalactic.com/articles/virgin-galactic-unveils-mach-3-aircraft-design-for-high-speed-travel-and-signs-memorandum-of-understanding-with-rolls-royce/) which is expected to be completed by 2025. The altitude will be 60,000 feet and have a capacity for 9-19 people. At first, I think this will dominate the private jet industry. [On a large private jet:](https://www.afar.com/magazine/how-much-does-a-private-jet-cost) $51,600 to $78,000 (14 to 19 passengers) for a 6 hour cross-country trip. \n\nThe designs for the Virgin Galactic/Rolls Royce Mach III craft make a trip around the GLOBE in 90 minutes and with the state-of-the-art sustainable aviation fuel, it is quite possible, if not probable that this is a more energy efficient and cost-effective method. \n\nIn my opinion, the first industry that this will take over is the private jet industry and will slowly but surely make its way into the commercial airliner industry.\n\n**Key Staff and Players:**\n\nFounder - Sir Richard Branson: Founder of the Virgin Group (Virgin Mobile, Virgin Atlantic, etc.)  \nCEO - Michael Colglazier: Former President and Managing Director of Disney Parks International  \nCTO (Chief Space Officer) - George Whitesides: Former Chief of Staff NASA  \nCFO - Jon Campagna: Former Corporate Controller of ICON Aircraft Inc.\n\n**Noteworthy Investors**:  \nVanguard  \nBank of America  \nMorgan Stanley  \nARK  \nBoeing  \nChamath Palihapitiya (Also a Virgin Galactic Chairman)  \nCathie Wood (presumably through ARKK)\n\n**Partners**:  \nBoeing ( investor/hopes to be a part of the hypersonic point-to-point travel )  \nRolls Royce ( designing and developing engine propulsion technology for high speed commercial aircraft as well as interior design )  \nNASA ( a plethora of tasks including transportation to the ISS, research, and hypersonic point-to-point travel )  \nLockheed Martin ( developer of the Supersonic X-59 plane which will be used for testing hypersonic travel )  \nUnder Armour (suits)\n\n**Bear Case:**\n\n1. What if it explodes?\n   1. As I stated before the last test flight to me demonstrated that the fail safes in place will prevent this from happening and the chart reflects that notion. Aside from that, I hate to be that guy, but fatalities are expected with companies especially in emerging technologies. Remember when [Tesla decapitated someone](https://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-tesla-florida-accident-20190302-story.html)? Or [the growing list of Airline incidents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_accidents_and_incidents_involving_airliners_in_the_United_States)? Or how about when [a Remington trigger malfunction killed hundreds](https://cooperhurley.com/blog/remington-700-trigger-malfunction-may-have-killed-and-maimed-hundreds/)? While I will not justify these events, I bring them to light to allow us to remember, this happens. I do not think this would be fatal for the company. Virgin Galactic [had a fatality in 2014](https://www.space.com/30073-virgin-galactic-spaceshiptwo-crash-pilot-error.html) and not a single person asked for a refund on their tickets.\n2. SpaceX:\n   1. This one just bothers me. They are two completely different markets. Sub-orbital vs. orbital space. Even if they were in direct competition with one another, that's hardly a bad thing to be SpaceX's largest competitor. Competition is good for companies, it makes the market itself grow and the companies within the sector grow with it. When it comes to Space Tourism, SpaceX is a completely different type of tourism that costs millions and is a week long trip. The only real competition will be in the hypersonic market, however, Elon intends on using his [hypersonic capabilities](https://newatlas.com/elon-musk-mars-update-mars/51558/?itm_source=newatlas&amp;amp;amp;itm_medium=article-body) for Mars colonization although I think he would be silly to NOT also provide this service on Earth.\n3. It is a hype driven stock:\n   1. This is the one I can agree with. We are pre-revenue, pre-publicity, and pre-commercial operations. The price right now is pure hype and speculation on what Virgin Galactic COULD become. Once we start seeing ER after commercial flights have started a more fundamental approach could be taken based on actual profit. I think this will remain hyped for a very long time as I mentioned early, most investors aren't here for space tourism. Space tourism is the PayPal, hypersonic flight is the Tesla.\n\n**TL;DR:** Space tourism is the start, hypersonic point-to-point travel is the golden nugget. This isn't some new technology, it's a revolution in human travel. Watch carefully this week. The test flight was delayed and that news was announced ATH on Friday. It is possible that we see a sell-off happen at market open. I don't know how long the sell-off will go or how big of an impact this will have. In the past delays and issues made the price plummet, however, there are new long term investors who might not even flinch at this news. This week is a **buying opportunity**. \n\nDisclaimer: I am not a financial advisor. I love the stock. 1750 shares at $17",

        "selftext": "I just wanted to provide an update to my initial DD on Payoneer located [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SPACs/comments/ldsbq1/payoneer_ftoc_updated_dd_for_valuation/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3). Specifically, I received some very nice customer feedback from a fellow redditer. I also summarize my thoughts after visiting r/Payoneer. Finally, I offer some thoughts on valuation and why its not as straightforward as just applying a multiple to revenue .\n\n1. **User feedback.** I would very much like to thank [u/-Jack-The-Lad](https://www.reddit.com/user/-Jack-The-Lad-/), who provided some really great insights into his experience using Payoneer.\\* \n\n* Payoneer offers vendors the ability to move money with a U.S. bank account and pay suppliers, without having to deal with too many banking hurdles/red tape.\n* A lot of freelancers on [Upwork.com](https://upwork.com/)  use Payoneer because many of them live in countries that [Upwork.com](https://upwork.com/) can't wire money to.\n* Once vendors receive funds into their Payoneer account they can either withdraw the cash using their Payoneer provided Master Card or do a direct bank transfer from Payoneer to their local bank. Usually funds arrive within 1-2 business days.\n* Vendors can also pay suppliers directly through wire transfers and pay for services like hosting using the MasterCard. *However, customers can't fund their Payoneer account.* While Payoneer likes the reputation of being \"a U.S bank account\" they really are not. They are a service that allows you to receive payment from companies. While individuals can send money from and to other Payoneer accounts, wire transfers to the account can only be done by a business. \n* As a result of the Wirecard scandal, Payoneer now gives the users the option to choose to hold their funds on their MasterCard or on Payoneer own accounts. \n* From [u/-Jack-The-Lad](https://www.reddit.com/user/-Jack-The-Lad-/): \u201cOverall I think Payoneer is a good company. They have a lot of room for expansion and their market is beyond huge. One thing I am concerned about is the potential for increased regulatory scrutiny. As Payoneer grows, it will likely get noticed by countries and may face stricter regulations both from the U.S and abroad.\u201d \n\n2. **Customer service.** After spending some time on the r/Payoneer sub-reddit, I have a few initial impressions. \n\n* While the Wirecard scandal caused a headache for Payoneer\u2019s customers, it seems to be a transitory issue.  \n* The Wirecard scandal aside, Payoneer\u2019s customer service is less than perfect and needs to improve. (Note: few people go out of their way to praise a bank or their cable company for seamlessly delivering the services the customers pay for. Please keep that in mind when browsing r/Payoneer.)\n\n3. **Valuation.** A number of people are comparing Payoneer\u2019s multiple to those of PayPal and Shopify. While these are the right comps, Payoneer's multiple will be determined by its customer lifetime value (CLTV), which is an NPV of the total cash flows from each customer over his/her/its lifetime. (While technically FinTech companies are valued on revenue or earnings/EBITDA its CLTV which will determine the valuation multiple.) There's a reason why the company included different cohort growth rates and mentioned a less than 12-month customer payback in the presentation. These are the metrics that matter.\n\nAdditionally, many are looking at Payoneer\u2019s transaction fees to get a sense for the potential revenue opportunity. While this is logical it is somewhat misleading because these services are considered low quality revenue (cf. the race to sub-1% fees in China). Similar to the CDN business, where moving traffic is a commodity while providing web acceleration and cloud security offer higher margins, Payoneer needs to upsell higher value added service to its customer base initially attracted by low service fees. Once agin, Payoneer highlighted these value added services in its presentation\n\nTLDR: Based on first hand feedback, Payoneer proves a very needed service. While the Wirecard scandal and fallout seem to be transitory, Payoneer\u2019s customer service needs to continue to improve. Fortunately, like cable, FinTech customers seem willing to tolerate a certain degree of frustration.  \n\nI definitely believe Payoneer has potential as a long-term buy and hold and is also a likely take-out candidate. While the global B2B industry is fragmented, Payoneer is playing the long-game by transitioning from commodity service fees to high-touch and sticky value add services. The key metric analysts will focus on is CLTV which will benefit from the shift to these services. Moreover, Payoneer\u2019s valuation multiple should reflect this transition by increasing (or \u201cexpanding\u201d in WS parlance) as Payoneer executes on this strategy. \n\n**Disclosure &amp; Disclaimer**\n\nI am not a financial advisor. Please do your own due diligence.\n\nI have the following positions:\n\n1. 1,000 FTOC common shares\n2. 10 February/August Covered      Calls @ $12.50 (short)/$17.50 (long). I intend to write monthly calls      against the long option, which is known as a diagonal spread or poor man's      covered call (PMCC). If anyone has insight into the attractiveness of the      warrants, I would appreciate his/her perspective.",

SpaceX is an indirect competitor because as it stands their space tourism will be orbital space, we are talking like a week long multi-million dollar vacation. \n\nCurrently, SPCE has one Space Plane and their second one is almost complete. They are predicting $1BN/spaceport/year.\n\nThere are other revenue streams such as running NASA payloads, scientists, data collection, and astronaut training as well. \n\nGiven that Virgin Galactic has this revenue plus $742 million as of September 30, 2020; I feel it is safe to say they will not have trouble surviving until 2025, in fact, it appears they will be quite profitable until that date.\n\n**Beyond 2025:**\n\n[Ark claims hypersonic point-to-point travel could evolve into a $270BN market](https://ark-invest.com/articles/analyst-research/hypersonic-flight-market/). Virgin Galactic is certainly leading the charge in this industry with Boeing, Rolls Royce, and NASA helping this come to fruition. Let's play with this number for a little:\n\nVirgin Galactic Shares Outstanding: 234.34M\n\nMarket cap of Hypersonic Travel: $270BN\n\nLet's make 3 assumptions, SPCE is the first and has 100% of the market, SPCE and SpaceX arrive at the same time and share 50/50 of the market, a lot happens over the next several years and SPCE has 20% of this market.\n\n1. SPCE has 100% of the market: $1152.17/share\n2. SPCE has 50% of the market: $576.09/share\n3. SPCE has 20% of the market: $230.42/share\n\nWhat's fascinating is even in the worst case scenario in this discussion we are looking at a 320.47% increase in price on hypersonic travel alone. That is very important to note. None of this includes the revenue generated elsewhere including the starting stream of space tourism.\n\nLet's look at Space Tourism, [the predicted market cap is $3BN](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/26/space-tourism-how-spacex-virgin-galactic-blue-origin-axiom-compete.html), which truthfully I find terribly undervalued. \n\nIf we account for hypersonic travel, space tourism, NASA payloads, gov't contracts, etc then my PT by 2025 is a $500 minimum. \n\n**Beyond 2030:**\n\n**Sci-Fi isn't really Sci-Fi anymore...it's just Sci:**\n\nThe possibilities of this company are about as boundless as space itself. Let's talk about some other future revenue streams that will be possible.\n\n1. Cargo transportation. If you thought 2-day delivery was imagine if cargo can be delivered anywhere on the planet in 90 minutes or less. Specifically time-sensitive cargo; something like a heart for a transplant or a vaccination that needs to arrive asap. We are long past the days of delivery via dog sled. Weather won't be a concern as these flights will take place ABOVE the weather.\n2. Military use - I mean the only difference between Virgin Galactic's space plane and something out of Star Wars is weaponry. I don't see why they wouldn't mount weapons and sell these space crafts to the Space Force. Think SpaceX is the main carrier and this space planes can launch from there.\n3. Interplanetary travel - Self landing rockets are all the hype, but what if a large carrier could orbit around a planet and send planes down for recon? They wouldn't need to use any fuel or anything to land so all their fuel could be used to relaunch back into space where they are grabbed by an arm on the carrier and pulled back in for refueling. The only thing that would be required is a place to land.\n4. Hypersonic travel - I already mentioned this but I need to emphasize how incredibly important this actually is. The airplane was invented in 1903 and for the past 118 years it has remained the fastest and most effective way for humans to travel. This industry is due for a revolution and I think this is it. I imagine when hypersonic first starts it will be akin to private jets regarding cost and public availability. But as the industry expands I think this will become the common way for humans to travel. Instead of airplanes and airports, it will be space planes and space ports.\n5. The list goes on and on and I don't want to speculate too far into the future of all the possibilities.\n\n**One thing is certain, the Space Age is upon us:**\n\nWhile there are many companies emerging in this market it is a HUGE market with near limitless potential. Virgin Galactic and SpaceX are leading the charge in these sectors. Companies like Momentus will be important to the industry as well, but the pioneers of this age are clear.\n\n**Let's Talk Technology:**\n\n[VMS Eve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VMS_Eve) is the name of the [WhiteKnightTwo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scaled_Composites_White_Knight_Two) mothership which is a custom aircraft. It looks like two airplanes attached together. [SpaceShipTwo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceShipTwo) is the space plane that attaches to the mothership. VMS Eve takes off like a normal airplane and ascends to 50,000 feet before releasing SpaceShipTwo. The boosters on SpaceShipTwo ignite and the space plane ascends 51.4 miles above the earths surface breaking into space (sub-orbit) where it conducts a slow backflip which creates microgravity (something NASA desperately wants to study). This is where the passengers become weightless in the cabin for 6 minutes. [The cabin](https://blog.dupontregistry.com/the-lifestyle/virgin-galactic-spaceships-cabin-interior-revealed/) has more windows than any other space craft and contains 16 cameras which will record the entire event. Once the backflip is complete the space plane re-enters the Earth's atmosphere and glides to land like a normal airplane. [Here is the first flight to space that demonstrates the technology.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h8T9mVkGh3s)\n\nRegarding hypersonic point-to-point travel; last year Virgin Galactic and Rolls Royce [unveiled the Mach 3 design](https://www.virgingalactic.com/articles/virgin-galactic-unveils-mach-3-aircraft-design-for-high-speed-travel-and-signs-memorandum-of-understanding-with-rolls-royce/) which is expected to be completed by 2025. The altitude will be 60,000 feet and have a capacity for 9-19 people. At first, I think this will dominate the private jet industry. [On a large private jet:](https://www.afar.com/magazine/how-much-does-a-private-jet-cost) $51,600 to $78,000 (14 to 19 passengers) for a 6 hour cross-country trip. \n\nThe designs for the Virgin Galactic/Rolls Royce Mach III craft make a trip around the GLOBE in 90 minutes and with the state-of-the-art sustainable aviation fuel, it is quite possible, if not probable that this is a more energy efficient and cost-effective method. \n\nIn my opinion, the first industry that this will take over is the private jet industry and will slowly but surely make its way into the commercial airliner industry.\n\n**Key Staff and Players:**\n\nFounder - Sir Richard Branson: Founder of the Virgin Group (Virgin Mobile, Virgin Atlantic, etc.)  \nCEO - Michael Colglazier: Former President and Managing Director of Disney Parks International  \nCTO (Chief Space Officer) - George Whitesides: Former Chief of Staff NASA  \nCFO - Jon Campagna: Former Corporate Controller of ICON Aircraft Inc.\n\n**Noteworthy Investors**:  \nVanguard  \nBank of America  \nMorgan Stanley  \nARK  \nBoeing  \nChamath Palihapitiya (Also a Virgin Galactic Chairman)  \nCathie Wood (presumably through ARKK)\n\n**Partners**:  \nBoeing ( investor/hopes to be a part of the hypersonic point-to-point travel )  \nRolls Royce ( designing and developing engine propulsion technology for high speed commercial aircraft as well as interior design )  \nNASA ( a plethora of tasks including transportation to the ISS, research, and hypersonic point-to-point travel )  \nLockheed Martin ( developer of the Supersonic X-59 plane which will be used for testing hypersonic travel )  \nUnder Armour (suits)\n\n**Bear Case:**\n\n1. What if it explodes?\n   1. As I stated before the last test flight to me demonstrated that the fail safes in place will prevent this from happening and the chart reflects that notion. Aside from that, I hate to be that guy, but fatalities are expected with companies especially in emerging technologies. Remember when [Tesla decapitated someone](https://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-tesla-florida-accident-20190302-story.html)? Or [the growing list of Airline incidents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_accidents_and_incidents_involving_airliners_in_the_United_States)? Or how about when [a Remington trigger malfunction killed hundreds](https://cooperhurley.com/blog/remington-700-trigger-malfunction-may-have-killed-and-maimed-hundreds/)? While I will not justify these events, I bring them to light to allow us to remember, this happens. I do not think this would be fatal for the company. Virgin Galactic [had a fatality in 2014](https://www.space.com/30073-virgin-galactic-spaceshiptwo-crash-pilot-error.html) and not a single person asked for a refund on their tickets.\n2. SpaceX:\n   1. This one just bothers me. They are two completely different markets. Sub-orbital vs. orbital space. Even if they were in direct competition with one another, that's hardly a bad thing to be SpaceX's largest competitor. Competition is good for companies, it makes the market itself grow and the companies within the sector grow with it. When it comes to Space Tourism, SpaceX is a completely different type of tourism that costs millions and is a week long trip. The only real competition will be in the hypersonic market, however, Elon intends on using his [hypersonic capabilities](https://newatlas.com/elon-musk-mars-update-mars/51558/?itm_source=newatlas&amp;itm_medium=article-body) for Mars colonization although I think he would be silly to NOT also provide this service on Earth.\n3. It is a hype driven stock:\n   1. This is the one I can agree with. We are pre-revenue, pre-publicity, and pre-commercial operations. The price right now is pure hype and speculation on what Virgin Galactic COULD become. Once we start seeing ER after commercial flights have started a more fundamental approach could be taken based on actual profit. I think this will remain hyped for a very long time as I mentioned early, most investors aren't here for space tourism. Space tourism is the PayPal, hypersonic flight is the Tesla.\n\nThank you all for reading, **if you don't want to actually read this check out the video DD:**\n\n[Video DD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V4VxAuQDFM)\n\n**TL;DR:** Space tourism is the start, hypersonic point-to-point travel is the golden nugget. This isn't some new technology, it's a revolution in human travel. Watch carefully this week. The test flight was delayed and that news was announced ATH on Friday. It is possible that we see a sell-off happen at market open. I don't know how long the sell-off will go or how big of an impact this will have. In the past delays and issues made the price plummet, however, there are new long term investors who might not even flinch at this news. This week is a **buying opportunity**. \n\nIf this DD was too long and the video DD was also too long check out the Too Long Didn't Watch (TL;DW) video here: \n\n[TL;DW Video DD](https://youtu.be/AKhDnS3Ipic)",

Decided to start a new series of Units under 11 on weekly basis. Both as a way for me to keep track and also as a platform to discuss. Don't want to miss out on quick DA spacs (Matterport comes to mind) - buying units definitely has bigger opportunity cost but want to make sure I get it early and get in cheap.\n\nKnow that there are better SPACs out there, but this under 11 series is more of finding great opportunity with very low downside risk. Also, it is sorted by price and not preference or position to keep it objective\n\nMost of these have very little info out there, so it is purely a bet on the management team.

        "selftext": "**Preamble:** $SQ is currently trading at \\~$228. They report their earnings on 02/23 and they're going to crush it! I personally think it's pretty cheap and it'll definitely have a run up. $SQ has two Lines of Businesses: Seller and CashApp. The Seller segment includes Square's managed payment services, software solutions, hardware, and financial services offered to sellers. The Seller segment generated $409.3 million in gross profit in Q3 2020, up 12.5% compared to last fiscal quarter. The other line of business is CashApp which is like Venmo meets Robinhood. They offer retail trading for stocks like $AMC, $NOK, B\\*T\\*C, etc. and they charge a variable cost for each transaction. Hence, high-priced asset purchase = higher fee. High volume purchases = more $. And then of course, you have your cash wallet.\n\nHere are my bull points:\n\n**Seller Segment:**\n\n* Between November 5 (last ER) - February 23 (upcoming ER) there was Christmas, Boxing Day, Cyber Monday, New Year's and Thanksgiving. These are are all holidays that Small Businesses highly benefit off of\n   * Retail sales will be up and same store sales will be up. Hence, more $ for $SQ.\n   * Considering their Q3 revenues were up vs. last fiscal (when COVID didn't exist) and last quarter, Q4 revenue will be tremendous.\n* More small businesses are open compared to last quarter. Vaccine started being distributed late 2020 -&gt; more people shopping outside -&gt; more small businesses profiting -&gt; more $\n* Most states (including businesses) are open ([https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/states-reopen-map-coronavirus.html](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/states-reopen-map-coronavirus.html)).\n* 2nd round of PPP: Credit lenders approved $5 billion loans in 1 week starting 2nd week of January 2021([https://www.fool.com/the-blueprint/over-60000-round-2-ppp-loans-already-approved/](https://www.fool.com/the-blueprint/over-60000-round-2-ppp-loans-already-approved/)). Small businesses aren't going anywhere and are here to stay.\n\n**CashApp Segment:**\n\n[$SQ vs. $PYPL vs. B\\*T\\*C Relative Pricing Chart](https://preview.redd.it/dktqnolq5df61.png?width=1311&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=973334c125737ffdef02ed247bdadc27eb5fe56f)\n\n1. There was a very strong correlation between B\\*T\\*C and $SQ, but the derailment happened near the end of December. While B\\*T\\*C discovered new ATHs, $SQ remained stagnant. **Not priced in!**\n2. According to survey results, 40% of retail traders who switched brokerages when the $GME, $AMC, etc. trading restrictions came about, they had migrated to CashApp. From this survey data gathered, Mizuho gives a PT of $300 ([https://thefly.com/landingPageNews.php?id=3237659&amp;headline=SQ](https://thefly.com/landingPageNews.php?id=3237659&amp;headline=SQ)). **Not priced in!**\n3. $PYPL earnings came out and claimed that C-currency had a big influence. Meanwhile, more C-currency is being traded via CashApp. **Not priced in!**\n4. B\\*T\\*C trading volume nearly doubled vs. last quarter, and yet $SQ has only risen by 15%. **Not priced in!**\n\n **Other Bullish Points:**\n\n* 1% of $SQ's asset is in B\\*T\\*C. B\\*T\\*C nearly 3x'd in the past 3 months. Meaning their B\\*T\\*C asset value 3x'd vs. last quarter. **Probably priced in.**\n* CashApp 7th most downloaded in app store:\n\n[App store](https://preview.redd.it/zcuqy9iuddf61.png?width=374&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=983ac6fd8bf65f114c7a2f38849708f7186aef07)\n\n**Bearish Points:**\n\n* The gremlin look alike that is Jack Dorsey is currently selling\n* $ARKK is lowering the weighting of $SQ and $PYPL\n\n**Assumptions:**\n\n* EMT\n* B\\*T\\*C doesn't crash before earnings\n\nTake advantage of the low pricing right now to get in and using ER as hedge if you're planning to sell before expiry.",

        "selftext": "Payoneer has been silently \u201cdefeating\u201d PayPal in the B2B arena (which is potentially a larger market with higher growth opportunity than B2C):\n\n1) EBay in Greater China is exclusively partnering Payoneer (this is doubly ironical because PayPal used to be part of eBay)\n\n2) Amazon affiliates does not allow PayPal payouts, but accepts Payoneer. (Amazon is the largest online marketplace, top affiliates earn millions in revenue.)\n\n3) Just google or search YouTube \u201cPayoneer vs PayPal\u201d. Majority of the articles say that Payoneer is better (mostly in the B2B/gig economy context).\n\n4) Payoneer may have some customer service issues, but the problem is that PayPal is worse. (Trustpilot rating of 4.4 vs 1.2 for Payoneer vs PayPal.)\n\n5) Payoneer has better coverage in emerging markets and developing countries. For example, PayPal totally does not operate in Pakistan, but Payoneer does. Growth in US, Europe is stagnating while emerging markets have potential for triple digit growth.(Payoneer did in fact experience up to 900% growth in Philippines, Vietnam, etc.)\n\nWhat Payoneer lacks now is media coverage, and brand awareness. The average person doesn\u2019t hear about Payoneer because it is B2B, only businesses and sellers use it behind the scenes.\n\nMildly Optimistic case: \n\n- Betsy Cohen (or someone else like Cathie Wood) ups the game and promotes Payoneer for the great company it really is. (Currently the PR promotion and media coverage is really non-existent, to be honest Betsy Cohen is not good at this compared to Chamath.)\n\n\n- Payoneer captures 5% of PayPal\u2019s equivalent market share and hence market cap. PayPal has $300B market cap so that would make Payoneer a $15B company (which is roughly 2-3X its current market cap).\nThat would equate to a solid stock price of $20-$40.\n\nModerate Bull case:\n- Payoneer expands to B2C and directly competes with PayPal head on, capturing 10% of PayPal\u2019s market share. That would make Payoneer a $30B company at around 5X its current market cap, ie $60-$70 stock price.\n\nNote that the above cases does not even require Payoneer beating PayPal, it just requires Payoneer to be worth 5%-10% of PayPal.\n\nBear case (quite unlikely imo):\n\n-Payoneer does not get the media coverage it deserves. No one, even institutions, knows about Payoneer hence low volume in stock trading.\n\n- PayPal totally dominates &gt;95% of the market, does not allow Payoneer to grow to 5-10% of PayPal\u2019s size\n\nPayoneer remains at 2% of PayPal\u2019s size. (This is definitely already achieved based on Payoneer\u2019s revenue of $0.5B vs PayPal\u2019s $18B.) Then, Payoneer is a $6B company which corresponds to $13-14 stock price.\n\n\nReference article (old but still relevant): https://www.paymentsjournal.com/executive-spotlight-series-with-scott-galit-from-payoneer/\n\nHighlights:\n\nHow does Payoneer stand out from other fintech companies?\n\nPayoneer is really a pretty unique FinTech company.\n\n\u2022B2B Focus \u2013 we focus exclusively on business payments. While B2B payments has much larger volume than consumer payments, it has attracted just a fraction of the attention and the investment of B2C\n\n\u2022Global \u2013 we\u2019re a truly global provider and company. We support customers that come from over 200 countries and enable them to transact through us in more than 150 currencies, and settle through more than 170 local clearing systems. We are regulated in the US, Europe and Asia, have offices from Silicon Valley to Tokyo, supporting our customers in more than 70 languages. We\u2019re also really strong in emerging markets, with a lot of momentum in SE Asia, India, Latin America and Eastern Europe.\n\n\u2022Scale \u2013 we\u2019re a profitable, well-funded company of more than 600 employees that moves many billions of dollars annually, works with large companies like Amazon, Google and Airbnb, and generates more than $100 million in revenues annually. We have bank relationships and partners all over the world, and have built a robust and redundant global payment infrastructure that ensures our clients get a strong, secure, scalable infrastructure partner they can count on.\n\n\u2022Brand \u2013 our brand has become meaningful, and represents economic empowerment for businesses and professionals all over the world, especially in developing markets. We are one of the 2000 most trafficked web sites per Alexa, and we get more than 150,000 applications each month from SMEs that are looking to connect to their trading partners, and get paid in new and better ways for their cross-border sales.\n\nDisclosure: Long FTOC commons\n\nDisclaimer: Not a financial advisor",

        "selftext": "Im here to tell you to add $TSNP to your watchlist, do your own DD and take on a position soon if you like what you see. I have searched countless days/hours on this stock and can\u2019t believe my eyes. This company use to be a flooring company and was bought out by HUMBL PAY, a new mobile app similar to PayPal and square, app is launching any day this month.\nThe difference of this app and PayPal/square is this company will be worldwide and target the countries PayPal doesn\u2019t operate in. It\u2019s not just a digital payment method, it\u2019s a digital currency exchange from country to country. If you have family in Mexico, you can send USD and it be converted directly into pesos. They will launch in 40+ countries this month alone.\n\nAnother big part of their business model is Hmbl Financial, this portion of the app is directed towards blockchain and crypto capabilities. The CEO Brian Foote has mastered the blockchain industry and plans to utilize it like no other. He\u2019s a very motivated CEO eager to change the world and very open about it. One of the things I admire about him and the company is PR, they hold investor calls once every other month and have been smashing their timelines. Working 20 hours a day his app is launching 4 months ahead of schedule.\n\nThe third portion of the app, yes another addition...\nIs Humbl Marketplace. A very similar concept of Shopify and Etsy. They will have endless merchants on their market place and you can be one too, they make it so you can launch a business on their platform within a day, and with the crypto and currency exchange within its own app, it\u2019ll be easier than every to buy/sell globally.\n\nRemember, TSNP has ZERO of anything to do with HUMBL beside the fact that humbl bought them out, humbl wanted to shortcut its way to the market and get a ticker already listed. This is 1,000% a different company so don\u2019t judge the balance sheet off of that.\nThe ticker will be changed to $HMBL any day this month and that alone will wake people up that this company is transforming. Humbl hits 3 markets within one app and one day will be globally. The three markets have been proven to be successful and all within one app sounds astounding. Market place/digital currency, crypto buying and selling/world currency exchange. All with lower fees that any competitors.\n\nI rest my case, GLTA.\nBe HMBL.",

        "selftext": "**My positions:**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/q2blf3vc0ah61.png?width=444&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6ff0e236d10f44b9d4652f2b8d4b02b8e502c39e\n\n**Disclaimer:** If you are a conservative investor you will find reading this a waste of time. Everything you read is highly questionable and accuracy of information is not guaranteed. No financial advice here. I have a significant long position in PSTH. The merger target and date could be incorrect. I\u2019m talking up my book. This is not a research report, just speculation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Thesis: There is two parts to this speculation**\n\nA. PSTH will merge with Stripe. (For these see A-Exhibits)\n\nB. The announcement will come on Feb 17th. (For these see B-Exhibits)\n\n**What is Stripe?** A payment processing company that competes with Square and PayPal. In April 2020, the San Francisco-based company ra ised $600 million from investors including Andreessen Horowitz and Sequoia Capital at a valuation of $36 billion. It is currently being valued at $70 billion or more. Stripe was founded by Irish brothers John and Patrick Collison founded Stripe in 2010. I\u2019m very familiar with the Irish, and the duo are extremely smart and have European way of thinking and mannerisms. \n\n**Background:** I presented the speculative evidence for Stripe being the target in A-Exhibits and timing in B-exhibits. A lot of these are scraped from various people who have done lots of digging. A speculative trade like this has high risk but also high reward. Nailing the timing on this would be tickets to retirement for some. So SPACs move massively on any news of discussion with a good target. Stripe is in my opinion as sweet honey. I highly doubt that Ackman and all those big investors like Guggenheim would invest in a SPAC without having a solid short list. I think their short list had Bloomberg and Stripe on it. They flirted with AirBnB and Coinbase just to see their chances. If any of those happened or a new sweet target emerged then they would do a quick second SPAC. They used PSTH to grab attention of other companies and see what they can attract for their future SPACs. Kind of like what Chamat did. I speculate that Stripe was their target and Stripe was just spending time getting ready for the Feb 17th announcement. All this is speculation. I also have read speculations about StarLink and Plaid and those really didn\u2019t hold any water. Collison brothers\u2019 way of running their companies has been very European like. Very cooperative and trusting of the process. They didn\u2019t mind giving a big chunk of their company to Y-combinator. They didn\u2019t mind hiring agitators. They just seem to operate like they live in Ireland and everyone is trustable. They are not used to dealing with NYC sharks. They are easy prey for a top predator like AckFuckingMan.  \n\n**Exhibit A-1: Stripe has been going on a hiring spree. 973 job postings vs last year 260** \n\n[https://stripe.com/jobs/search](https://stripe.com/jobs/search)\n\nBelow is how their site looks now:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u404o2ce0ah61.png?width=722&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d8f2b63deb8432098c9ffd7c6f8d5a631276354f\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBelow is how their postings looked in April of 2020\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uwqdv8mf0ah61.png?width=684&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=622ccdaf94f6b5781f2e2e78be103256bf005c79\n\nHiring needs money! They are obviously seeing a huge injection of money coming their way. \n\n**Exhibit A-2: Privacy statement of Stripe updated** \n\nNew text added regarding \u201cother entity which buys us\u201d to their privacy statement. \n\nBelow is the privacy statement once updated:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ehnhm8jg0ah61.png?width=668&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3244068df641543e55fece6bd0306acc1e16c8ff\n\nBelow is how it looked in early 2020: (see it is missing that sentence)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kunyeoch0ah61.png?width=686&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8be19b5bf85f9e8b3614ab59f3dbddff23863084\n\n**Exhibit A-3: Bill Ackman follows 190 people on twitter and oddly 3 are stripe et al**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9x0tz0gi0ah61.png?width=658&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2678e3b0aeaedc4ee60b22533fcd3067ad2067c9\n\n**Exhibit A-4: Ackman mentioned that he talked to stripe** \n\n[https://youtu.be/GmaCarSyBk4?t=917](https://youtu.be/GmaCarSyBk4?t=917)   Minute 15:17\n\nStripe wasn\u2019t ready to go public but they sure seem to be working towards it. Bill mentions \u201cManagement\u201d, \u201cInfrastructure\u201d, and \u201csystems\u201d. So that ties into exhibit A-1. Stripe is ready now. \n\n**Exhibit A-5: Stripe hires Dan Pontes, a post merger specialist**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ge9ri9xj0ah61.png?width=550&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b5b05bd9db7f0906101427e69dee71ca9eaf95c1\n\n**Exhibit A-6: Stripe hires an army of lawyers in Q4 or 2020**\n\n[https://news.bloomberglaw.com/us-law-week/stripe-snags-half-dozen-lawyers-amid-new-fundraising-talks?context=search&amp;index=0](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/us-law-week/stripe-snags-half-dozen-lawyers-amid-new-fundraising-talks?context=search&amp;index=0)\n\n**Exhibit A-7: Stripe hires Christa Davies and Shannon Brayton**\n\nLooks like Stripe is getting ready to be public. \n\n[**https://stripe.com/newsroom/news/christa-davies-joins-stripe-board**](https://stripe.com/newsroom/news/christa-davies-joins-stripe-board)\n\n[**https://www.prweek.com/article/1704490/stripe-hires-shannon-brayton-comms-head**](https://www.prweek.com/article/1704490/stripe-hires-shannon-brayton-comms-head)\n\n**Exhibit A-8: Fundraising talks in Q4 of 2020**\n\nBloomberg reports that Stripe is in talks to raise money with a valuation north of 70B.\n\n[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-11-24/payments-startup-stripe-is-said-in-talks-to-raise-new-funding](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-11-24/payments-startup-stripe-is-said-in-talks-to-raise-new-funding)\n\n**Exhibit A-9: Ackman smearing the competition**\n\nStripe does not allow adult content payments. So Ackman starts smearing Visa and Mastercard\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gddulg8m0ah61.png?width=549&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2fdfb9a869996316bdad8cf4c50d1cc526b36d1f\n\nStripe terms of service:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bsp465on0ah61.png?width=558&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=396fa4d94906fb6c1f3772adc9b917482e78774f\n\n**Exhibit A-10: Corporations are usually expected to deny rumors.** \n\nSince December there has been no denial of rumors about this merger by either party. This points at NDA and ongoing developments. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vkuagypo0ah61.png?width=564&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=54260a89cf6ad6af5a0929a1a094cd27c0244846\n\n**Exhibit A-10: Jackie Reses** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ps3ln0jp0ah61.png?width=587&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d0d47a0dec06ba9da5c0a54fe0f031fdd1597de8\n\nShe has been liking Stripe T-shirts and was invited to ClubHouse by a stripe member via some degrees of separation. Jackie was the head of capital for square and stepped down. She has also been liking tweets from Ackman. \n\n**Exhibit A-10: Peter Collison interacted with posts about SPAC on Twitter.** \n\nThose were on Jan 8th. They have been deleted since. I could be wrong about this exhibit.\n\n=====================================================================\n\n**Exhibit B-1: Bill Ackman earnings call: Ackman gave a 2021 Q1 target**\n\n[https://centurylink.cwebcast.com/ses/2CUtOMyHmr7q63DSO2LpyA\\~\\~?ek=0fb7e9e1-3910-4dd3-a749-24f81df281ad](https://centurylink.cwebcast.com/ses/2CUtOMyHmr7q63DSO2LpyA~~?ek=0fb7e9e1-3910-4dd3-a749-24f81df281ad)\n\nMin 42:30\n\n*\u201cIn terms of timing, what we said at the time of the IPO is we said it would take us, we thought about six months to identify a target that we would be in a position to hopefully announce a deal by sometime in Q1 and then close the transaction in the ordinary course thereafter. Nothing that we have experienced to-date suggests that we won\u2019t meet our expected timeframe\u201d-* \n\n**Exhibit B-2: The two meetings are right one after another. Seems to be coordinated.** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img dqict6sq0ah61...*\n\n**Exhibit B-3: Note the bump in price and volume earlier this week**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8kc91bnr0ah61.png?width=645&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4bf1186fb68589b1a38dbccbb91f46d7a0b537dd\n\nThis points to some insiders getting ready for the announcement. \n\n**Exhibit B-4: IV on the call options suggest big imminent news**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/160of5js0ah61.png?width=630&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=94de0ac8eac7bbd6b0f281321ee5fb4f432ad818\n\nThis was captured before news of 13G filed on Friday. \n\n**Exhibit B-5: Twitter activity**\n\nOn Feb 8th Bill tweeted a Rap Song about SPACs: [https://twitter.com/BillAckman/status/1358799402371076096](https://twitter.com/BillAckman/status/1358799402371076096)\n\nBill is not too active on twitter, nor is John Collison.\n\nPatrick and John Collison both had a notable reduction in twitter activity in first week of Feb and all of a sudden they came alive on Feb 8th. This is the day that PSTH shares jumped \\~6% on no news. Insiders buying? There was a lot of unexplained excitement on that day both in twitter behaviour of parties involved and price of PSTH. \n\n**Exhibit B-6: 13G filing by PSH**\n\nNews of raising more money coming out just now! See 13G filled on **2/12/21** after hours. \n\n[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1336528/000119312521041777/d105691dsc13g.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1336528/000119312521041777/d105691dsc13g.htm) \n\nI think there is a lot of confusion about this. People are saying that it is PSH increasing the PIPE, and this is pointing to a bigger deal. I think this is false. I think for that you need an S-3 filing. This is obviously above my paygrade and we need a securities lawyer to decipher this for us. What is noteworthy is that this simple news made **the stock move 10% and warrants move 25%.** So you see any small hints of positive news make this baby move massively.  \n\n**=================================================================================**\n\n**Notable Institutional Investors:**\n\nPERSHING SQUARE CAPITAL MANAGEMENT, L.P.  200,000,100 $5,544,002,772\n\nGUGGENHEIM CAPITAL LLC    22,000,000 $499,180,000\n\nBAUPOST GROUP LLC     12,707,924 $352,264,000\n\nCITADEL ADVISORS LLC     2,167,041 $49,170,000\n\nPEAK6 INVESTMENTS LLC **(CALL)**    577,400 $16,006,000 **(New Position)**\n\nGOLDMAN SACHS GROUP INC    299,498 $8,302,000 **(New Position)**\n\nIt is speculated by redditors that the prominent wealthy investor that Bill Ackman was talking about is either Warren B, Bill G, or the Warlton family.

        "selftext": "eBay is going to roll on their earnings.\n\nBy roll on, I mean knock out of the fucking park.\n\n\nHere\u2019s some DD for anybody who doesn\u2019t eat breath and sleep only GME.\n\n\neBay, like most other online retailers, are going to have ludicrous numbers in this last quarter due to the holiday season. That\u2019s just a given. \n\n\nI am an experienced eBay seller who on a weekly basis for the last few years, sells around 15-20 items. The last few months was ridiculous. Items which were posted that would have around 10 bids and 5-15 watchers, would have 25-30 with 20+ bids. The views on each item was double to tripe from early November until pretty much the last two weeks. \n\n\nLots of volume, lots of selling, lots of 10% commissions for eBay. Now we all saw what happened with Apple, posting 100+ Billion in revenue this last earnings report and being down 3% the next day. That shit happens, I\u2019m not a psychic with a magic ball. If the market is tanking, the market is tanking. Look at it this week. But I will say this, the volume on eBay isn\u2019t why I\u2019m going fucking hard in the calls. Here\u2019s the real cherry on top:\n\neBay has now finally implemented a payment policy they have been working on for a long time. Every single one of my sales went through PayPal, along with everybody else. Every single god damn transaction PayPal got their dirty little claws into. Since I think like the beginning of eBay, it\u2019s just been a given that they give PayPal millions of dollars every month to run their transactions.\n\n\nWell guess what you mother fucker. Shit had changed. Since they have now implemented their STRAIGHT TO BANK ACCOUNT POLICY, PayPal doesn\u2019t even exist. The money goes, you guessed it, straight to your account. They even have their own return feature which they deal with themselves now, instead of putting funds into hold on PayPal. eBay allows you to chose when you get paid and in what frequency. For example, I have mine setup for each Tuesday of every week. \n\nThis is going to and has already saved them MILLIONS in fees. Papa Musk has already moved on from PayPal, it\u2019s time we do the same.\n\n\nOh, did I mention all the new payment platforms introduced as well? I bought a Pok\u00e9mon card the other day without gay as shit PayPal but through god damn Apple Pay. It was way too easy. You can also link credit cards, bank accounts, whatever. It\u2019s 2021.\n\n\neBay posts earnings in a few days, Wednesday after close. Do what you want. If the stock goes down, call me a dumb and make fun of me. If the stock goes up, fuck off and thank me later. Look at what it did today. I\u2019ll probably sell a third of my calls on Wednesday for an IV hedge as well. Play at your own risk. \n\n\nTLDR; My positions are eBay CALL 05/FEB/21 60CALL , 62CALL and 65CALL",

        "selftext": "Tl;dr Prosus trades for roughly half of its AUM\n\nProsus is the international investment arm of South African conglomerate Naspers. Having grown to the point it dominated the entire Johannesburg Exchange, Naspers spun off Prosus, basing in in Amsterdam.\n\nProsus makes it business investing in start up internet and technology companies. It holds stakes in India food delivery service Swiggy, International food delivery Deliver Hero, and Latin America food delivery iFood. It also hold 40% of US reseller OfferUp, and 28% of Russian internet conglomerate Mail ru. They also own 98% of PayU, a fintech payment system similar to PayPal, used across Eastern Europe, South America, and Africa. \n\nSounds decent, yes? The kicker, and the single most important investment is a 31% minority ownership of Chinese megacorp Tencent. In addition to owning nearly a third of the video game/social media/entertainment goliath, it also claims a board seat. Tencent has recently become involved in investing in startups of its own, and Prosus has direct access to sit in on those meetings, and get in on every potential deal on its own.\n\nAs of today, Tencent is worth just over $900B. At 31% ownership, this should give Prosus a valuation of $279B, off this one investment alone. And yet the company trades at a valuation under $200B. Prosus has specifically stated it has no intention of selling off its stake in Tencent, but it could do so and immediately have more cash on hand than its entire valuation. None of this even accounts for every other investment they have.\n\nManagement is acutely aware of the discrepancy between its valuation and actual AUM, and is working to get better correlation. It has approved a $5B stock buyback program, and is committed to taking further steps as necessary yo reach a proper valuation.\n\nIn short, Prosus is steeply discounted when you add up all of its total assets, and represents a fantastic buy opportunity. I've been in them since about fall of last year, and have been happy with CEO Bob Van Dijk's candid language and dedication to shareholders. Good luck to any potential investors.\n\nPosition: 1200 shares at $22.23",

        "selftext": "I\u2019m in the UK and have about $40,000 (\u00a330k) to invest. If I was in the US I would put it all in ARK ETFs, because I really admire the investment strategy and obviously the ARK ETFs have done incredibly well recently. However, you can\u2019t invest in any ARK funds from the UK. My intention at the moment then is to build a portfolio based on the ARK ETF holdings, primarily from the genomics and next gen internet funds but not exclusively. My thinking behind this is that my own independent research is never going to match up to that of these guys (and other large institutions); I was thinking then of looking through the ark holdings for the different funds and spreading my investments across a number of their holdings, such as Exact Sciences, Shopify, PayPal,Teledoc etc etc. To me this seems like a pretty sound strategy but I have a couple of concerns:\n\n1. A lot of these ark holdings have had some really good runs recently, and so there\u2019s obviously the concern of buying at the top.\n2. Sufficient diversification\n\nIf anyone got any thoughts on this idea I\u2019d really like to hear them. Cheers.",

        "selftext": "Feb.15 is Presidents\u2019 Day and market is closed. With the second quarter of 2021 coming and policies of the new administration becoming clearer, I am looking to allocate my extra cash into a few sectors that I believe will have potentials but are either absent or underrepresented in my portfolio. I don\u2019t talk about popular sectors such as Fintech, online retail, renewable energy, IT and cloud computing, medical and healthcare, online streaming, electric cars e.t.c. simply because I already have picked my stocks and/or ETFs from these places.\n\n======\n\n1 Transportation and Delivery\n\nTransportation and delivery stocks took a hit last March when the disruption of pandemic came. Almost one year later they have recovered strongly. Staying at home and working from home have created unprecedented demand for transportation and delivery of goods via vehicles on highways. As the vaccination looms and the economy reopens, the demand might drop, but the habits nurtured during the pandemic could linger for quite a while. I am still cautious about airline stocks; air travel is still far from recovering even 1/3 of what it was before the pandemic and I won\u2019t make a move until the volume reaches about 1/2 . \n\nLooking at: PAG, KSU, UPS, FDX, UBER, UNP\n\n======\n\n2 More traditional/\u201d big players\u201d financial stocks\n\nI have opened another post asking for advice, so I will just be copying and pasting:\n\nFintech stocks and ETFs are popular on the market nowadays and I\u2019ve reaped quite some profits from ARKF, PYPL, SQ, V, virtual currency ETFs e.t.c. But now I am eyeing in on the more traditional/big Wall Street players like Citibank, JPM, Morgan Stanley, BNY, Goldman e.t.c. All flaws and blames and crooked behaviors aside, they are still the biggest players in the financial market nowadays and the establishment can\u2019t be overwhelmed by a few Reddit short squeezes. I am trying to observe if these stocks could sort of \"recover\" from the shock and respond to the innovative trend.\n\nThere\u2019s also another realm of more diversified asset management player such as CG, BX, BLK, NTRS e.t.c. It seems the pandemic has a very strong asset/wealth reallocation effects and the wealthiest that could afford to have their assets managed by these players are doing well. These institutions also typically have quite established footings in emerging markets such as Asia and South America in both government and private businesses. CG has recently published a pleasant Q4 2020 report and their stocks climbed. I am waiting to see if BX, BLK and NTRS would follow suit.\n\nLooking at: JPM, BX, BLK, NTRS, CG, BAM\n\n======\n\n3 Military and Defense\n\nThe mainstream media tries hard to paint a layer of peaceful color to the new administration, but tensions around the globe won\u2019t just disappear. The US military has quite a few major contracts for new weapon systems delivery coming up, and US arms sales to allies could increase as many of them are located at the forefronts of tensions (Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Saudi, India e.t.c).\n\nLooking at: LDOS, LMT, GD, NOC, BA (more for its military contracts rather than for commercial airplanes)\n\n======\n\n4 Tech Infrastructures\n\nWith everything shifting to online platform, Tech stocks (IT, cloud computing, semiconductors e.t.c.) have done well in 2020. I am in MSFT and TSM, and I just want to take a look at stocks that offer a more infrastructural exposure to the tech advancements, such as base towers for 5G, solutions for cloud computing and online platforms, workstations, hardware production e.t.c.\n\nLooking at: CCI, AMT, CSCO, MSI, ERIC\n\n======\n\n5 Virtual Currency\n\nI am not a big fan of virtual currencies so far, and it might be a bit late to enter the game. but nobody could deny the soaring prices of every major virtual currency, and I certainly don\u2019t mind to ride the bandwagon and get a few extra bucks. \n\nLooking at: BLOK, KOIN\n\nI welcome your thoughts and hope you all have a bullish and profitable 2021.",

        "selftext": "## Purpose\n\nThe purpose of this post is to write out the thought process and analysis of some of my major investments. Each of these investments can take over a year to decide on, but cannot be invested in until I have written out the process.\n\nPart of this is also due to the fact that I believe that investing in securities will become increasingly complex yet accessible for a typical retail investor which will either result in isolation OR incentivize cooperation to open-source complex information.\n\n- Does the average retail investor really understand the core regulatory influences in investments like Square, PayPal, or even RH? \n\n- Does the average retail investor understand incentives vs. bias?\n\n- Is the average retail investor familiar with fashion trends that make Nike and Foot Locker valuable?\n\n- Is an average retail investor familiar with competitive types of manufacturing processes when they invest in technologies like AMD or GE? \n\n- Is the average retail investor familiar with the network models that govern software like Fastly and Twilio?\n\nAt the end of the day, I am an educator and I believe that the goal of education is to engage a reader into a deeper curiosity or discussion, so that\u2019s why I\u2019m sharing my writing. I\u2019m not here to convince you that this stock is even a good choice - but to explore the economics behind it.\n\n\n## The Fundamental Constraint\n\nThis one is not going to be easy to understand, so get your coffee ready and get comfortable. It\u2019s going to be difficult to digest the technology behind Square because it asks you to believe the premise that banking is going to change in unforeseeable ways in the near future. I currently work in the Banking-as-a-Service sector as an engineer, so I have some insight that I could offer.\n\nA fair amount of people may not know this, but organizations like Stripe, Square, PayPal, and other fintech infrastructures are just network layers over existing banks. For example, Stripe partners with Evolve Bank while Square partners with Sutton Bank. This is a win-win scenario, for now, where banks get to see the benefits of technology distribution powers, while tech companies gain a shortcut to regulatory requirements.\n\nIt may help to accept this by understanding the idea that drives the financial technology sector. In order to distribute financial services to people, regardless of net worth, trustworthiness and accountability must be established. These are regulatory frameworks developed by the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) or Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) that are also challenged by such technologies like B*tcoin, where validation is arbitrary and based on fingerprinting. This trustworthiness is also the reason why you\u2019re able to instantly invest in your RH account - you are a trusted user and there is no reason to believe that you are somebody else.\n\nIt is, then, no secret as to why Square invested in B*tcoin. There are other reasons, even cultural, as to why they did, but the basic root behind the decision is that it allows research into new verification methods that makes shipping financial services even more frictionless. It is a potential vector for changing the rules of the game and leveling the playing field, so to speak. Being a software-first bank allows you to distribute at a much more rapid pace than a traditional large bank.\n\nIn short, The fuel of fintech is the underbanked. The combustion engine that burns it is cybersecurity and AI to validate that a user is trustworthy each time they commit a transaction. This is known as the KYC Problem and how each organization approaches the regulatory requirement to verify that a user is not committing fraud will determine the outcome of who dominates the fintech sector. This is also why you see customer-service as a pervasive problem.\n\nNow let me just go ahead and take the opinion here - I don\u2019t think PayPal will achieve this in the US, but their investment in MercadoLibre might take them there in some way. Latin America is a particularly interesting case study in underbanking. The reason I hate this is because I feel that a lot of their services are disconnected and low-quality. For example, Remitly allows me to send money to Mexico in a highly informed and smooth way, while Xoom (a paypal remittance service) just about shits the bed the moment I touch it. Sure, that\u2019s anecdote - but I want my investments going somewhere where the design is ALWAYS built around the customer. PayPal\u2019s management resulting in the shipment of an unfinished and thoughtless product is just an awful red flag to me. I should not be getting unknown error alert when I send money to another country. \n\n\n# The Underbanked\n\nJack Dorsey is an interesting character, who views on technology can be highlighted:\n\n&amp;gt; \u201c...to develop an open and decentralized standard for social media. The goal is for Twitter to ultimately be a client of this standard. Twitter was so open early on that many saw its potential to be a decentralized internet standard, like SMTP (email protocol). For a variety of reasons, all reasonable at the time, we took a different path and increasingly centralized Twitter. But a lot\u2019s changed over the years.\u201d\n\nInterestingly enough, Twitter is used in such a manner. The Tweet system these days gets shared across all social media platforms due to its simple design and even appears interactively during sporting events or billboards.\n\nIn my view, Jack Dorsey sees the current period of time as a turning point in internet communications and the underbanked. It is clear as day in its marketing strategy, where Square seller services is marketed strongly toward immigrants and first-time entrepreneurs while Cash App is strongly marketed toward young, first-time banking customers. No really, go ahead and look at two things:\n\n- Cash App\u2019s Twitter and advertising strategy\n- The geographic results on Google Trends when searching \u201cCash App vs. Venmo\u201d. Southern USA generally sees less banking due to increased poverty.\n\nIt is clear as day and the reason is due to the nature of the demographics of underbanked users. You see, access to banking is not much different than access to the internet or access to clean water.  That is, the closer you are to poverty, the closer you are to lacking access to basic resources. What is interesting about Square\u2019s youth &amp;amp; culture strategy is that it builds a life-long trust with the org. You\u2019ve heard it before, \u201cwhy doesn\u2019t school teach us important thing like taxes or investing?\u201d. Square is attacking that pulse in its design. It offers:\n\n1. The ability to start a business\n2. The ability to invest and educate in basic stocks\n3. The ability to invest and educate in bitcoin\n4. The ability to save on basic purchases\n5. The ability to file taxes (not yet, but the company acquired the means to)\n\nWhat this inevitably means is that we probably won\u2019t even see Square operating at \u201cfull-force\u201d until at least 2030 and beyond, as these early aged customers grow with Square and embed more of their financials.\n\n# Speculation\n\nThis is what I expect after examining regulatory environments, product quality, and competitive outlooks:\n\n1. Square will either acquire Sutton Bank or reduce its dependency on Sutton Bank\u2019s regulatory offerings.\n2. Square will become a bank to avoid direct competition with Big Tech, while competing aggressively against Big Banking by offering the ability to ship financial services.\n3. The way they will achieve this is by developing a stronger form of cybersecurity and AI that will allow a smoother verification process.\n4. Square will develop an internet railway, where exchanging currency will be accessible in different mediums like video-games or streams that may compete with orgs like Visa or MasterCard.\n5.

        "selftext": "Contrast this with the recent news of PayPal shutting down its domestic operations in India.\n\nThis is an external source from Deutsch Bank, it is not Payoneer blowing its own horn. https://cib.db.com/insights-and-initiatives/flow/cash-management/prescient-on-payments.htm\n\nA key point that Payoneer is focusing on is \u201cworking capital\u201d. Essentially, it is money-lending to companies. Payoneer is focusing very hard on this. In fact, they have the Israel's former chief economist of the Ministry of Finance Yoel Naveh leading Payoneer\u2019s working capital division. Money-lending, as everyone knows, is very lucrative. \n\nNote that Payoneer currently doesn\u2019t do B2C, hence it may be quite common for people in India (or anyone in  the world) to never even have heard of it, unless they are a business or in the gig economy. That is one of the problems for the stock, no one has heard of it (yet) because it works quietly behind the scenes. Given enough funding, who knows, Payoneer may well expand to B2C. Alibaba initially started as B2B as well but has since expanded to B2C (Taobao).\n\nWe just need Payoneer to be 5% of PayPal (ie. $15B market cap) in order for stock price to be in the $30-$40 range. \n($6B market cap corresponds to around $13-$15 stock price.)\nGiven all the recent news and growth, it is hard to imagine Payoneer cannot achieve that?\n\n\nSource (Deutsch Bank): https://cib.db.com/insights-and-initiatives/flow/cash-management/prescient-on-payments.htm\n\nHighlights:\n\nThe growth of Payoneer\u2019s global network included a move into India in April 2016, following a partnership with Pune-based IndusInd Bank and expressions of interest in its services from more than 10,000 freelancers and small businesses across the country. Reports such as a 2018 PayPal study suggest that India\u2019s freelancers represent around one quarter of the world\u2019s gig workforce and, according to Payoneer\u2019s 2020 Freelancer Income Report, work for an average hourly rate of INR1,282 \u2013 just over US$17, against a global average of US$21.\n\nIn August 2019, Payoneer announced a year-on-year increase of 400% in its customer base and a threefold increase in payment volumes processed in India. It added that it was in talks with banks and non-bank financial companies to add working capital products to its payment services, although negotiations to gain the necessary regulatory authorisation have since been delayed by Covid-19.\n\nIndia is an FX-thirsty country which imports more than it exports,\u201d says Kulkarni. Indeed, OECD data for 2018 showed total exports at US$326bn and imports at US$492bn, an imbalance of US$166bn. \u201cIf you\u2019re an exporter and want to be compliant, you need to complete the documentation, but until recently it took months to complete a transaction. The banks also charged hefty fees that reflected the large amount of physical work involved and the rather chaotic process.\n\u201cDigitisation makes the job much easier \u2013 the documents can be downloaded, sent to the bank and the whole process completed within seconds, which helps merchants considerably.\u201d The achievement was recognised when Payoneer won in the Best Payments and Collections Solution category in The Asset\u2019s Treasury, Trade, SSC and Risk Management Awards 2020.\n\nDisclosure: Long FTOC common shares\n\nDisclaimer: Not a financial advisor",

        "selftext": "Elon Musk is a billionaire and the reason is that he has made an electric car company, a space company, a paypal company and much more. Jeff Bezos is a billionaire who has built one of the most incredible companies of our time in Amazon that provides value to people all over the world. Bill Gates is a billionaire who built a company Microsoft used by companies all over the world. These people have earned their money. \n\nWhat have the hedge funds built? What value do they provide to the society? I have long wondered about how billionaires make their money and I have never understood how those who did it by starting hedge funds make so much money. BUT, now it is CRYSTAL CLEAR.\n\nPerhaps not all hedge funds, but many of them are a HUGE FRAUD. They don't really \"do\" anything. Clearly they manipulate stock prices through short ladder attacks, naked short selling, media manipulation and much more. By limiting clients to net worth of at least 1 billion dollars, they have control over enormous amounts of dollars that allows them to move markets just by making buys and sells. On top of that, they participate in shorting like GME at ridiculous levels over 100% which is not even logical. They have their own brokerages, their own data on order flow. These hedge funds have figured out how to scam and manipulate the game in order to gain enormous amounts of money. They operate in secrecy with minimal reporting requirements. They buy off politicians by making enormous donations to candidates of BOTH political sides ensuring no legislation to halt their corrupt practices. They probably sit in the hamptons mansion laughing at how easy it is and how all the other stupid people in the country actually work hard for such little amounts of money.\n\nThis is their game. They have figured it out how to take advantage of the system. While other works hard in real jobs in healthcare or science or engineering or whatever else, they sit somewhere in the Hamptons laughing at how little work is needed for them to earn such ridiculous sums of money. Then, they buy sports franchises and yachts. Its all just a game that they have rigged. Just look at Jefferey Epstein, another hedge fund billionaire. Was he doing any work? Nope, he was running an elaborate child sex trafficking operation day to day because of all the free time he had. Epstein didn't even have much of any formal education. But, he probably knew the right people to get into the hedge fund world and learned the game.\n\nIts all an enormous game of manipulation, fraud and scams secretly known to a handful of people who believe the rest of the world are fools who will never catch on. The common man must find ways to follow their actions and look for more opportunities like GME to take them head on because there will be little or no action we can expect from incompetent and corrupt government officials.",

The system uses its own currency, the Q, and to get people to start using the system once it's ready they are allocating Qs for free to people that sign up now (the amount drops as more people join - so better to join early). Signing up is free and they only ask for your name and an email address. There's nothing to lose but if this payment system becomes a world leading payment method your Qs can be worth a lot.

        "selftext": "## Purpose\n\nThe purpose of this post is to write out the thought process and analysis of some of my major investments. Each of these investments can take over a year to decide on, but cannot be invested in until I have written out the process.\n\nPart of this is also due to the fact that I believe that investing in securities will become increasingly complex yet accessible for a typical retail investor which will either result in isolation OR incentivize cooperation to open-source complex information.\n\n- Does the average retail investor really understand the core regulatory influences in investments like Square, PayPal, or even RH? \n\n- Does the average retail investor understand incentives vs. bias?\n\n- Is the average retail investor familiar with fashion trends that make Nike and Foot Locker valuable?\n\n- Is an average retail investor familiar with competitive types of manufacturing processes when they invest in technologies like AMD or GE? \n\n- Is the average retail investor familiar with the network models that govern software like Fastly and Twilio?\n\nAt the end of the day, I am an educator and I believe that the goal of education is to engage a reader into a deeper curiosity or discussion, so that\u2019s why I\u2019m sharing my writing. I\u2019m not here to convince you that this stock is even a good choice - but to explore the economics behind it.\n\n\n## Investing in Internet Forums\n\nIn my view, Pinterest can be one of the most sound social-networking investments.  Let\u2019s keep one question in mind:\n\n&gt; Did Facebook\u2019s implementation of a hashtag kill Twitter?\n\nUltimately, what drives a social-networking site is a user\u2019s incentive to search and discover information in that particular forum. As a result, examining social-networking sites can be a lot like comparing shopping centers, such that a shopper is incentivized to go to a location for a particular reason that is served by that institution.\n\nThe forum may take on a different medium, but it is ultimately a forum none the less. If we try to categorize it roughly, the forums would look like this:\n\n- Google is fueled by user\u2019s need for answered information.\n- Facebook is fueled by a user\u2019s need to connect.\n- Pinterest is fueled by a user\u2019s need for ideas.\n- Reddit is fueled by a user\u2019s need for community.\n- Online video games are fueled by a user\u2019s need for adventure.\n\nWith this basic model, you can argue which forum may be inelastic. In my view, it ranks like this, where the top rank is the most inelastic due to human behavior:\n\n1. Google (need for information)\n2. Games (need for adventure)\n3. Reddit (need for community)\n4. Pinterest (need for ideas)\n5. Facebook (need to connect)\n\nThe reason I rank Facebook as the most elastic version is because I have already witnessed multiple transformations resulting in users connecting in various ways. I eventually expect this to replicate in other nations too because doing everything is simply just weird and scares users off. I also believe that people really underestimate how quickly humans find new ways to connect and can move to another platform for connection; which is quite a common occurrence in online gaming.\n\n\n## Searching \n\nThat being said, I think Pinterest is wonderfully positioned and has quite an interesting history. The network-effect that built Pinterest was mostly driven by women, which has profound economic consequences. As a result, Pinterest\u2019s recommendation model is geared to advertise to women-influenced interests and has already adopted the technology to be used a certain way: a search engine for ideas which is now beginning to permeate in households internationally. \n\nThis has long-term positive consequences for product messengers that can be the subject of such idea searches regardless of your culture. You can try it yourself to understand; it feels like what you want Google Images to do for you at times: \n\nBirthday gift ideas (Michaels, Corsair)\nSkincare ideas (Target)\nTips for traveling to another area (AirBnB)\nHome construction (Sherwin-Williams, James hardie, etc)\n\nThe fact is, it\u2019s the user who is actually voluntarily searching for ads in an ad space. \nBehaviorally, this means that Pinterest\u2019s users are in a \u201chigh willingness to engage\u201d with things that result in \u201caction\u201d. That is, a Pinterest user is logging in because they need to start something or they need to plan for something in the near future. This is basically a sweet spot for advertisers, as they know they\u2019re getting top real estate on BOTH Google and Pinterest as a result of their product design. \n\nPinterest was not designed to make a user spend hours mindlessly scrolling for content. It was designed to make a sale and keep a customer happy _outside_ of Pinterest. That is fundamentally different than Facebook\u2019s connect-everything approach to social-networking.\n\n\n## The Design\n\nPinterest ranks high in Google\u2019s results for specific reasons. Pinterest develops its own in-app browser that has particular consequences for:\n\n1. Security &amp; Privacy\n2. High demand for high quality ad-messaging and visuals\n3. Vectors to user\u2019s websites generated by hosts like Shopify or Wordpress.\n4. Vectors for advertisers\n5. Vectors for user\u2019s channels like Etsy, Zoom, or TikTok.\n6. A browser that follows Progressive Web App standards\n\nThe combination of these design choices ranks it high in \u201cGoogle\u2019s algorithm\u201d, while this search engine result increases its bar for ranking each year. This means that bigger organizations like Twitter, Doordash, and Pinterest will enjoy the tailwinds of these priorities.\n\nWhy is Google doing this? Because they want high web standards as a global competitor. Part of the global competition is shaping the internet\u2019s develop to consider people that have high latency connections since software can scale faster than some of the hardware that is available around the globe. The internet is ultimately \u201caccess to information\u201d, which is as scarce as \u201caccess to clean water\u201d around the globe. So it\u2019s carefully considered in strong engineering communities.\n\n\n\n## Summary\n\nI believe Pinterest qualifies as an excellent investment. I totally love the fact that the network-effect behind Pinterest is built by women, but not necessarily for women. I am carefully monitoring the results of this network-effect as I believe that it will have long-term consequences on family life. I feel that this kind of product design will eventually create a deeper gravity for advertisers, where they know that Pinterest users are essentially  sustainable top dollar advertising spaces - as users are looking directly to consume as a result of their usage which is far different than other social-media platform strategies.\n\n\nI use Facebook and Instagram every day, resulting in nothing. I use Pinterest a few times a month at most. The difference is, every time I use Pinterest - I follow up or plan to follow up with some consumer behavior. That, to me, is incredible.",

        "selftext": "Hi, investor newbie here (6 mo.). I want to trim the amount of individual stocks that I own as I believe I overdiversified my money. I own some shares in both companies and they are the least performing in my portfolio. I would like to sell one as I could use the money on a better performing stock that I have gains in (QCLN/AMD/APPL).  For what it's worth, I have a little more money invested in Verizon, than I do Coca Cola. Can someone help me figure out what's the better stock to keep between KO and VZ? After doing some DD, this is what I came up with:\n\n\\_**The case for selling KO:\\_**\n\nCoca Cola: I got into this last stock July for $48.80 and it's currently at $49.92, so there's been zero growth. Looking at their income statement from the latest quarterly report (Q3-2020), they haven't been doing well either. Their revenue is down 10% from a year ago and their gross profit has decreased as well. KO's balance sheet shows that their total assets have went up, but so has their debt. They have increased their total debt by 15%, which has decreased the total equity value of the company. \n\nKO has also tripled the amount of money purchased in investments (according to their cash flow sheet), leading me to believe that they have no plans to recover immediately and are playing the long term game. \n\n**My** **Conclusion:** The only case for keeping KO currently is because of their dividends and name recognition. The pandemic has really affected KO and will probably not recover until it's over. With that being said, other stocks are booming so it would be foolish to leave money here to trade sideways until the COVID is over.\n\n\\_**The case for selling VZ:\\_**\n\nThis stock has actually been in a steep decline for several months, since hitting their ATH in early December. I'm currently in the negative in this stock, which is insane giving that the stock market set a new ATH records across the 3 major indexes. Looking at their income statement from the latest quarterly report (Q4-2020), their net income is down 9.6% (their revenue only increase 1% for the year). \n\nLike KO, VZ has also increased their amount of debt, but only by 8%. Their total equity is good, as it has increased by 10% from the year prior. Their cash flow sheet shows that they've spent a lot of money in investment activities, but this is offset by the net cash they gain in the last year (10+%). \n\n**My Conclusion:**  The case for if I should keep VZ is a conundrum for me. Their financials show growth, but the value of their stock declining sharply during a record level boom market. They have a at great dividend (4.5%) but it is not enough to cover their stocks loss in value. It is concerning and selling this stock would incur a slight loss for me. However I could regain it back quickly if I took the money wasted here and invest it into another stock (PayPal for example). \n\n**TLDR:** I own both KO and VZ. I would like to sell one of the stocks to chase gains in growth stocks, while keeping the other long term. Which one should I keep?",

Their primary product is a mobile payment system (IPSI Pay) used for money transfers. For instance on 2019 alone, IPSI kiosks processed 4.5 million transactions in Mexico. The company is now focusing on the United States. 50 kiosks are planned to be operating by Q2 2021 in Southern California. The company is also expanded on other fronts. They are about to roll out their very own \u201cIPSI coin\u201d - backed by the US dollar.

        "selftext": "I updated the post below to reflect the current valuation and provide a context for evaluating FinTech companies. Obviously, I would encourage everyone to do their own DD starting with the investor [presentation](https://pubs.payoneer.com/docs/investor-presentation.pdf?_ga=2.142077554.1186770460.1612586492-2042252415.1612359068) and [webcast](https://viavid.webcasts.com/viewer/event.jsp?ei=1426630&amp;tp_key=f7e0f9ea11). I personally found the presentation short on key metrics and financial detail and long on buzz words. (I guess $95mn in bankers' fees only buys so much these days.) That said, the acquisition has yet to close and Payoneer needs to be prudent. I would also add that while I avoid stereotypes, Payoneer seems to be another addition to Israel's strong lineage and tradition of building great technology companies.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n**Payoneer (FTOC)**\n\n**Summary:** Payoneer offers investors exposure to mobile and digital commerce, particularly cross-border transactions, at a reasonable entry point. What makes the investment compelling is that Payoneer has been around for 15 years, which removes a fair amount of execution risk related to growth, i.e., the team knows what they're doing. The company is also investing in providing additional services for its customer base which should contribute to growth and strengthen its competitive position.\n\nIMHO the key for the company (and the stock) is to better explain the customer ROI at the unit level and why investments now make sense from a CLTV sense. The company also needs to address flattish margins on 25% revenue growth and negative EBITDA after 15 years of operations. I think the company missed an excellent opportunity to frame the discussion out of the gate by highlighting the benefits of its scale with detailed customer metrics, e.g., subscriber acquisition costs (SAC), churn, and most importantly customer lifetime value (CLTV). These are really the metrics which matter to thoughtful investors as well as the usual financials. If this was an obvious play, it would be trading significantly higher. (Un)fortunately, most investors don't like complexity or have the patience to watch a good company become a great company. I think this may be a situation where really digging into the financials and business model could reward investors handsomely over time. That said, far more DD is needed as well as much more disclosure from the company before one can make a decision. I would encourage investors to take a modest position and then build on it as the DD validates.\n\nThe acquisition is expected to close within the first half of 2021 at which point detailed financials should be available.\n\n**Company:** Payoneer is Paypal for B2B global commerce, particularly outside North American and Europe. The company provides B2B services for millions of SMB and enterprises around the world. In 2020, the company recognized $345mn of revenue (31% Y/Y growth adjusted for the pandemic) on $44bn of transactions. The company was founded 15 years ago and operates in over 190 countries (basically the whole world).\n\n**Customers:** Enterprises and SMB. The ideal customer is a small but growing SMB doing business all over the world which needs currency, compliance and business services. Payoneer is an obvious candidate to handles these needs given its global network.\n\n**Industry and market opportunity:** B2B global marketplace. The attractiveness of FinTech can be summarized in a few words, namely, \u201cscale\u201d and \u201cnetwork effects\u201d. From the metrics Payoneer shared, it looks like they\u2019re benefitting from these dynamics but the disclosure could have been better (more about that below). Analysts estimate the global B2B market at tens of trillions $ and cross-border payments at $300mn. Obviously, the pandemic only accelerated these trends. (From the presentation, it looks like company B2B AR/AP volume more than doubled at 140% in 2020 although the CFO later cited a 53% increase in volumes so not sure exactly how to interpret that.)\n\n**Management team:** Betsy Cohen led FTOC and has extensive expensive in the FinTech space, including leading previous SPACs and founding Bancorp Bank. Scott Galit has experience at Mastercard and First Data, which is exactly what you want to see.\n\n**Business model:** Volume and customer growth drives revenues. Volumes grew over 53% in 2020 (67% adjusted for the pandemic) and is expected to grow at 44% and 33% in 2021 and 2022, respectively, which translates into 25% annual revenue growth per year for the next two years. I would say all else equal flat revenue growth vs. decelerating volume growth is a good thing but again a deeper dive into the product mix is necessary. The key here is that these growth rates are higher than the overall market so Payoneer appears to be taking share but again more DD is needed.\n\nWhile the transaction margins have been growing, the company forecasted margins to remain flat at 72% for the next two years. I believe this forecast is due to a change in the blended take rate but unfortunately the company really didn\u2019t elaborate here. I would have expected the revenue growth to drive some incremental margin expansion but I\u2019m clearly missing a piece of the story. This may be an issue for investors. That said, the CFO offered long-terms targets of +20% revenue growth and +20% EBITDA margins. I was also surprised the company wasn't EBITDA positive given how long it's been around but I need to see how much of the costs were investment or subscriber acquisition related.\n\nAs for the all-important unit-economics, the customer payback period is less than 12 months, which is nice. Disclosing CLTV would have been better. The company also noted net volume retention (i.e., same store comparison of customer Y/Y volume) is over 100% but did not disclose exactly what the percentage is. This is somewhat irrelevant since anything less than 100% and the company wouldn't be getting acquired. I found the SMB cohort volume on slide 27 interesting. While it's lacking a Y-axis for volume (ugh!), its clear each year's cohort of customers are roughly following a similar trajectory although 2015 seems to be a slight outlier. Now, if the company would just disclose the unit economics for these cohorts, you'd have your investment decision made. I think at this point, you have to trust the quality of FTOC's DD. My guess is they drilled down and liked what they saw.\n\nNote: the adjusted numbers were a turnoff. Covid happened. If you're benefitting from the acceleration in cross-border traffic due to the pandemic, don't exclude those sectors negatively impacted by said pandemic. I believe the company was done a disservice by its bankers here in trying to manipulate the numbers. Investors aren't stupid and if they are, they're not the ones you want. This massaging coupled with the lack of PF shares outstanding is a little concerning.\n\n**Valuation:** FinTech companies such as PayPal, Square, and Payoneer are valued on subscriber growth. The key metric which the analysts will judge the company on is customer lifetime value (CLTV), which is an NPV of the total cash flows from each customer over his/her lifetime. (Analysts apply a similar approach to wireless companies and data center REITs where each new subscriber or data center build is viewed on a payback and NPV basis. Technically, these companies are valued on earnings, EBITDA or AFFO but its CLTV or customer NPV which determines the valuation multiple.) Counterintuitively, once the company reaches a certain scale and growth slows, the margins and FCF will improve but the analysts will become concerned that growth is moderating even though the financials are improving. (That's when the smart money will bail.) Again, CLTV is the name of the game and is the primary way to evaluate companies such as Payoneer. There's a reason why the company included different cohort growth rates and mentioned a less than 12-month customer payback in the presentation. These are the metrics that matter.\n\nBased on FTOC's current share price of $13.50, Payoneer is currently trading at roughly $6bn, which assumes \\~430mn total shares outstanding.\\* (This is a SWAG as management did not include a pro forma cap table with shares.) The current valuation implies an enterprise value (EV) to revenue multiple on 2021 revenue in the mid-teens, which is much closer to global payment processors such as First Data than digital payment and ecommerce companies such as PayPal, Square, and Shopify. FTOC shareholders will own 19.2% at closing. Finally, there is a management earn-out of 30 million shares at the $15 and $17 mark which will dilute existing FTOC shareholders but comes with 10-25% upside from current levels.\n\n* The initial valuation assumed an enterprise value (EV) of $3.3 billion, which equates to 7.6x EV to 2021 revenue. Just to clarify, FTOC was negotiating a CASH investment, i.e., the $755mn raised at IPO and held in trust, not an acquisition with its shares as currency. FTOC's pro forma ownership of 19.2% for a $755mn equity investment roughly equates to the pro forma market cap of $3.8bn mentioned in the presentation. Yes, there is some dilution from the sponsor's shares and the 30m share earn-out but I would argue that FTOC got a fair price for its investment as evidenced by the fact that FTOC shares are trading 30% above NAV.\n\n**Investment Thesis**\n\n**1.** **Majority of traffic stays within the network.** In my opinion, this is the key company metric because it reflects how valuable the network is to its customers. This metric continues to increase for Payoneer.\n\n**2.** **Exposure to digital commerce and mobility trends.** As everyone realizes, this is a big and growing market which the pandemic accelerated.\n\n3. **Global network provides network effects and is difficult to replicate.** The benefits of network effects cannot be overstated as Paypal has proven. As a company acquires more customers, the value of its network increases. Payoneer\u2019s business model leverages this same dynamic. Moreover, its network would be very difficult to replicate. The company\u2019s global platform includes over 80 banks and clearing partners in over 100 countries. The company also provides customers data about its transactions, which I believe will be increasingly useful and sticky.\n\n4. **Playing the long game.** The company\u2019s focus on investing for future services is actually what gets me most excited as it may ward off near-term investor interest and improves its competitive position. It\u2019s also a sign of a mature management team. The opportunity to provide additional services such as working capital, compliance and tax services seems like an obvious strategic move to drive growth. Expect M&amp;A to figure into the company\u2019s strategic plans as well.\n\n**5.** **Attractive valuation:** Payoneer\u2019s valuation is much closer to global payment processors than digital payment and ecommerce companies. The negative EBITDA, flattish transactional margins, and \"adjusted\" revenue are certainly issues and need to be addressed. However, as noted above, Payoneer needs to be viewed in the correct context to value it appropriately. While the company doesn't merit PayPal's multiple given it doesn't have its growth or scale (yet), the company is certainly benefitting from scale/ network effects and deserves a multiple which reflects this. I expect the valuation multiple to rise (or \"expand\" in WS parlance) as the business becomes better understood within the investment community and the company posts a few solid quarters of earnings results. I feel like this is more \"a when rather than if\" issue. Thus, the current valuation represents an attractive entry point for current investors.\n\n**Risks:**\n\n1. **Competition:** PayPal is a giant and only getting stronger as 4Q results testifies. The company has leveraged network scale effects to achieve a market cap rivaling MasterCard. Skrill is also well known in this space. MasterCard and Visa certainly play in cross border transactions but I don\u2019t think they provide the level of services Payoneer does. Definitely need to do more DD here.\n2. **Customer risk:** Related to the previous point, if Payoneer loses a large customer like AMZN, the stock will take a hit (cf AMEX walking away from CostCo).\n3. **Regulatory:** Payoneer needs to navigate every country\u2019s regulatory environment. The company has certainly done a good job but as the FAANGS can testify, the larger you get, the bigger target you become, e.g., Europe is trying to displace MA and V.\n4. **Crypto currency:** At this point, everyone in FinTech better have a crypto currency strategy even if its just allowing transactions in BTC. Crypto currency was made for seamless cross-border currency transactions which makes a crypto strategy doubly important for Payoneer.\n5. **FX exposure:** I\u2019m sure the company has a world class FX hedging team but I feel like this needs to be flagged given the scale of the business. Investors could unintentionally have FX exposure.\n\n**TLDR:** Payoneer is a proven company in a great space with a solid management team that is playing the long-game. IMHO, it could be a very attractive investment for LT investors at the current valuation with the caveat that far more DD is needed around competition and the financial model. I also would not be surprised if PayPal took them out given their $6bn market cap vs. PayPal's +$300bn. It would be a very nice complement to PayPal's existing business assuming the transaction past regulatory scrutiny. My advice is to spend more time digging and in the meantime acquire a small position upon which to build.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nI am not a financial advisor.\n\nPositions:\n\n1. 1,000 FTOC common shares\n2. 10 February/December Covered Calls @ 12.50 (short) /17.50 (long).

        "selftext": "Good morning everyone!\n\n**Small Cap Watchlist (under $10)**\n\n1. TYME: Gapping up on a COVID catalyst. Currently showing strength in premarket with high relative volume, I'll be keeping an eye on this one, but be patient and don't force trades. Resistance around 4.00 on the daily chart.\n2. CPSH: Gapping up on a seemingly pretty weak catalyst. Low float, so could see some volatile swings this morning. Be careful, and make sure to have an exit strategy if you choose to enter a trade. Premarket resistance around 9.80, with support at 8.85-8.90.\n3. AREC: Gapping up continuing momentum from yesterday's trading, no new catalyst. Low float so could see some volatile swings. Sometimes these day-2 plays die down early in the morning without providing trading opportunities, but it's worth keeping an eye on for a continuation play if price action and volume permit it. Premarket resistance at 4.63.\n4. ZYNE: Gapping up without a known catalyst. Seeing decent volume and price action in the premarket. Premarket resistance at around 4.40, with a potential gap to fill to a daily chart resistance of around 4.80. \n5. SNDL: Gapping up on momentum from previous days of trading, no new catalyst. Showing some strength in the premarket, with good price action. Extremely high float, so this could be a slow mover, but I'll be keeping an eye on it. \n6. SELB: Gapping up without a known catalyst. Good price action on okay volume in premarket. Showing some weakness now after if failed over premarket resistance, but I like it if it can get back up and cross that resistance at 5.74.\n7. CRBP: Gapping up on momentum from yesterday's trading. Seeing good price action and volume in the premarket. Premarket resistance around 3.14, with possible support around 2.50.\n8. CANF: Gapping up on momentum from yesterday's trading. Seeing good volume and decent price action in the premarket, with resistance around 2.55 and support at 2.10.\n\n**Large Cap Watchlist (over $10)**\n\n* Gapping UP: SLS, VCVC, ENLV, FUTU, CLNE, ZGNX, MJ, TLRY, APHA, GRWG, PYPL, CRSP, BEAM, MGNI, DKNG, PLTR, LAC, MARA, RIOT, GME\n* Gapping DOWN: SPOT, VXRT, X, HYLN, GSK, INO, CCIV, SQQQ, UVXY\n\nLots of stocks gapping up today, and good day for small caps in particular--lots of gap ups. We could see a push back to all-time-highs for SPY, but I expect to see some resistance. Silver up again today, and I'll be watching GME with popcorn once again. We've been seeing some little spikes in volatility, so things could potentially get choppy again. If it does happen to get choppy, use proper risk management and there is nothing wrong with sitting a day out. But until you see signs of choppiness, I'm expecting a relatively smooth start to the day. Selling cash secured puts is one of the strategies that I utilize, but I am currently being cautious regarding selling puts after we saw that recent correction.\n\nAlways remember proper risk management, and be a picky trader. Only you decide when you want to enter a trade, so don't force anything.

        "selftext": "  \n\nHi all,\n\nYesterday Enphase Energy published their Q4 2020 results. See my earlier DD here in this sub. \n\nWith this post I would like to discuss the results and the web-call with regard to future growth/earnings. So far my investment in Enphase was a solid move (5% after-market), let\u2019s hope that this momentum will increase. I have divided this post in three chapters: results, web-cast management notes and analyst Q&amp;A. However, before we continue let me first do a short into on the new C-suite hire. \n\n**Chief Marketing Officer**\n\nEnphase recently announced that they hired Allison Johnson as Chief Marketing Officer. Who is Mrs. Johnson and why did they hire her at this moment? Are sales declining or are there some amazing plans in the pipeline? \n\n\u201cJohnson brings decades of executive marketing experience to Enphase, including serving as chief marketing officer at PayPal, where she led a global marketing transformation, and as vice president of marketing communications at Apple, Inc., where she helped launch some of Apple\u2019s most iconic products and campaigns of the Steve Jobs era. Johnson received her Bachelor of Science degree in journalism and communications at the University of Florida.\u201d\n\nWhen checking her Linkedin, she started working at IBM as a Media Relations Director, moved to Netscape (1 year) \u00e0 HP (6 years) \u00e0 Apple (6 years) \u00e0 West (7 years) \u00e0 Paypal (1.5 years). \n\nLet leave it here for now. \n\n**Results Q4 2020:** \n\n\u00b7 We reported revenue of $264.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2020, along with 40.2% for non-GAAP gross margin. We shipped approximately 762 megawatts DC, or 2,292,132 microinverters.\n\n\u00b7 Revenue of $264.8 million \n\n\u00b7 Cash flow from operations of $84.2 million; ending cash balance of $679.4 million \n\n\u00b7 GAAP gross margin of 46.0%; non-GAAP gross margin of 40.2% \n\n\u00b7 GAAP operating income of $79.1 million; non-GAAP operating income of $72.4 million \n\n\u00b7 GAAP net income of $73.0 million; non-GAAP net income of $71.3 million\n\n\u00b7 GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.50; non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.51\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img 8rqzlro7vmg61...*\n\nThis was their forecast for Q4 2020:\n\nFor the fourth quarter of 2020, Enphase Energy estimates both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results as follows:\n\n\u00b7 Revenue to be within a range of $245.0 million to $260.0 million; revenue guidance does not include any safe harbor shipments\n\n\u00b7 GAAP gross margin to be within a range of 37.0% to 40.0%, excluding the recovery of the remaining $16.0 million tariff refund that has not yet been approved; non-GAAP gross margin to be within a range of 38.0% to 41.0%, excluding tariff refund and stock-based compensation expenses\n\n\u00b7 GAAP operating expenses to be within a range of $51.0 million to $54.0 million, including $16.0 million estimated for stock-based compensation expenses and acquisition related amortization\n\n\u00b7 Non-GAAP operating expenses to be within a range of $35.0 million to $38.0 million, excluding $16.0 million estimated for stock-based compensation expenses and acquisition related amortization\n\nSo one can say that they performed extremely well. \n\n**Management notes web-call:**\n\n**Badri:** \n\n**\u201c**Let's now talk about manufacturing. Our operations team did a great job flexing manufacturing as 2020 played out. When the pandemic began, we cut manufacturing in Q2 of 2020 and then had to quickly ramp back up to meet the surge in demand in Q3 and Q4. The production in Q4 was more than two times the level in Q2. I'm very pleased with the ramp of our Mexico factory that met our target of producing more than 1 million units in Q4.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs part of our supply chain strategy to diversify production to tariff free and cost competitive locations globally, we began microinverter production at Salcomp, India in October of 2020 and started shipping to customers during Q4. We have a high quality state-of-the-art automated line with a quarterly production capacity of 0.5 million units and the space to add a second line with the same capacity. The production ramp is going very well and we expect to produce approximately 400,000 microinverters in India in Q1.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet's now move on to the regions. Our US and international revenue mix for Q4 was 82% and 18%.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn Europe, we reported record revenue for Q4. Revenue increased 10% sequentially. On an annual basis, the revenue from Europe increased 32% in 2020.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn Australia, we built on our strong Q3 results and achieved record quarterly sell-through and record installer count in Q4. The results were fueled by the launch of our Enphase Installer Network or EIN as well as growing demand for our high power IQ 7A microinverters plus a favorable competitive environment as regulations continued to shift towards safer and smarter solar. We expect to introduce our Enphase Storage system for the Australian market during the fourth quarter of 2021.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn Latin America, we reported record quarterly revenue. Puerto Rico showed strength for our microinverter systems as well as our storage systems.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt the same time, the uptick in broad economic activity has stressed the global semiconductor supply chain. We are seeing constraints on a few semiconductor components used in our microinverters.\u201d \n\n**\u201c**There are two specific components that we are constrained on. One is our ASIC that goes into the micro and the other is the AC FET drivers that actually drive the high voltage FET. There the name of the game is we are qualifying multiple more sources so that we have more supply as well as expediting product. And I am in direct touch with the CEOs of those companies and they are helping as much as they can. We expect to get all caught up basically by early April. Our top priority through all of this is to ensure that we take care of customers. So we will do whatever it takes in order to ensure their lines are running and that they are not affected. So that's on the microinverter side.\u201d \n\n\u201cYou will see a lot more going forward. So we continue to grow at a nice clip. You can do the math. If we continue to grow at this 30%, soon we will need a third supplier, that might happen in 2022 and we are already talking to those people\u201d\n\n**TL:DR: They are growing in every aspect. They are trying to train installers internationally (Australia, Europe, South-America). Ones these installers are trained appropriately, they will start installing the products. Enphase will rather wait with the installment to only send very trained personnel, then just let a shitty installer do the job.** \n\n**Q&amp;A:**\n\n**Q1: \u201c**Thanks for taking our questions and congrats on the quarter. So you said you'll start shipping IQ 8 in 2Q. How should we think about IQ 8's standalone pricing versus IQ 7? What may be the range on the premium and might you expect over time a majority of installers shifting more toward IQ 8 versus IQ 7 or is the jury out on that question still?\u201d\n\nA1: \u201cWith regarding whether people are going to adopt IQ 8 over IQ 7, we think the answer is a no brainer. It's going to be, yes. IQ 8 is a grid-independent microinverter system. So, therefore, I expect the adoption to be high when it is released and there are obviously a lot of combinations with IQ 8 and in some cases, people might prefer to buy IQ 8 with a smarter storage system and we will be promoting the heck out of it.\u201d\n\nQ2: \u201cOkay. Thank you. And just on the R&amp;D cycle, are there any updates you can provide on the development of IQ 9 where that currently stands at this time? Is it still being developed or is it in testing phase? If you can provide any color there? Thank you.\u201d\n\nA2: \u201cYeah. We are actually working on IQ 9 at this time and IQ 9, our vision is basically obviously smaller, cheaper, faster, producing a lot more power than IQ 8. Right now, we are focused on a few areas. One is, we'd like to see how to reduce the footprint of the transformers, the \\[indiscernible\\] (00:49:10), the 600-volt AC FET devices through some semiconductor process innovation. GaN transistors are becoming widespread. GaN-on-GaN, GaN-on-silicon, they are becoming widespread.\u201d\n\nQ3: \u201cAnd just on the new acquisitions and the digital strategy, could you maybe talk about like what's the goal here in terms of reducing that soft cost? I think a couple in the solar developers have talked about $7,000 or $8,000 per customer of soft costs. So, is the idea here to kind of like bring it down similar to probably what the soft cost is in Europe and Australia or what's your thought process here? And I have just a quick follow-up after that as well. Thanks.**\u201d**\n\n**\u201c**Yeah. So, soft cost is an outcome of what our goal is. Our goal is to provide our installer partners with the best service possible, and so \u2013 installer partners actually as well as the homeowner. So, we have mapped out a very detailed journey of both how the entire installation process as well for both the installers as well as our homeowners starting with leads all the way through design, proposal, permitting, procurement, commissioning, installation commissioning, permission to operate O&amp;M, et cetera. And so, if we do an amazing job on that where we really create a very powerful platform and these acquisitions that we're talking about are important elements of that journey, then I think the natural outcome of that is going to be a reduction in the soft cost. But we are starting with a very clear focus that this is about bringing great value for our long-tail installer partners.\u201d\n\n**My thoughts:** \n\nStaying invested in a company post-earnings is normally not our strategy. We scan every company on the earnings calendar and dive in the fundamentals/growth of that company. If you find 3 solid companies which you want to gamble your money on per week, there is a possibility to earn 10% ROI on each of those companies. Investing in boomer company of which the stock increases 2% post-earnings is not interesting for us. It rather be +7% at least, or nothing. \n\nEnphase however is a different story. They keep beating their forecasts every quarter. There is enormous demand for their products and they a growing in supply and demand. \n\n\\- Management is amazing. The way Badri perceives the business is very client focused. They are well aware that this is a client focused business and quality and client experience are top priority. \n\n\\- With regards to future growth they have some very interesting things going on. IQ 8, which I expect to be finished during the 2nd quarter of this year. Then it is the job of the new CMO to promote the heck out of this. As Badri said in the call: \u201cpeople might prefer to buy IQ 8 with a smarter storage system and we will be promoting the heck out of it.\u201d\n\n\\- There is so much growth opportunity in this company. And yes the P/E is high, but you must see Enphase as a tech company and not solar producer. Last quarter they hired 85 employees. \n\n\\- So our plan: keep this gem for one more quarter to see how their results are in the next quarter. Have they improved their semiconductors problem or not? Are they still beating the forecast or not. Then we\u2019ll see from there on. This weekend\u2019s plan: scan earnings calendar of next week to find the next gem \ud83d\ude0a  \n\n**Q1 2021 forecasts:** \n\nFor the first quarter of 2021, Enphase Energy estimates both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results as follows:\n\n\u2022 Revenue to be within a range of $280.0 million to $300.0 million; revenue guidance does not include any safe harbor shipments\n\n\u2022 GAAP gross margin to be within a range of 37.0% to 40.0%, as there are no remaining tariff refunds pending approval; non-GAAP gross margin to be within a range of 38.0% to 41.0%, excluding stock-based compensation expenses\n\n\u2022 GAAP operating expenses to be within a range of $64.0 million to $67.0 million, including $22.0 million estimated for stock-based compensation expenses and acquisition related costs and amortization\n\n\u2022 Non-GAAP operating expenses to be within a range of $42.0 million to $45.0 million, excluding $22.0 million estimated for stock-based compensation expenses and acquisition related costs and amortization",

        "selftext": "Previously, I've made my case for Fiverr, a company for freelancers, only last week. Since my recommendation, the stock has grown from 270 to 320 as time of writing. That's an \\~20% increase. I believe the future of work will also be 'online' as opposed to traditional 'in office'. The last year, the coronavirus has only accelerated the shift to online-work.\n\nI now propose another stock, PayPal. What's my reasoning for this? When you look at growth stocks, you also look at their suppliers. For Tesla, for example, you look at who's supplying the batteries for electric cars and can bet on that as well. The rise of Tesla and electric cars has created a halo effect, and the rise in their stocks for all of the industry.\n\nNow, when you think of Fiverr, and the rise of companies based on online work, payment processing companies will benefit. When you transact with freelancers half way across the world, we are looking at payment processing companies that serve as a method of payment for your transaction. The likes of Visa, Mastercard, and Paypal stand to benefit. Why specifically PayPal?\n\nBasically not only will PayPal stand to benefit from increased transactions as outlined above, Paypal also looking to get into anything related to digital payments. To quote, PayPal has jumped into the mobile payments space with Venmo, which is now the most widely used mobile peer-to-peer payments app out there. PayPal has also delved into cryptocurrencies, and now accepts cryptos on its payment platform. What\u2019s more, the payments company is also jumping into more direct shopping and stock trading.\n\nBasically, it\u2019s doing it all. PayPal is turning into an all-in-one digital wallet for consumers. They are looking at doubling it's user-base and hence revenues. It's parallel is Alibaba's Ant Financial. It's massive in China, and before the Chinese government clamped down on the IPO, it was looking to the biggest IPO in all history.\n\nIf you are looking to place a blue-chip stock in your portfolio, I believe Paypal will the next best bet.",

        "selftext": "**My positions:**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sd68mdtiw9h61.png?width=444&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6f25eb5196dcc9424332c2c1216a093ffbab2142\n\n**Disclaimer:** If you are a conservative investor you will find reading this a waste of time. Everything you read is highly questionable and accuracy of information is not guaranteed. No financial advice here. I have a significant long position in PSTH. The merger target and date could be incorrect. I\u2019m talking up my book. This is not a research report, just speculation by a heroin addict.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Thesis: There is two parts to this speculation**\n\nA. PSTH will merge with Stripe. (For these see A-Exhibits)\n\nB. The announcement will come on Feb 17th. (For these see B-Exhibits)\n\n**What is Stripe?** A payment processing company that competes with Square and PayPal. In April 2020, the San Francisco-based company ra ised $600 million from investors including Andreessen Horowitz and Sequoia Capital at a valuation of $36 billion. It is currently being valued at $70 billion or more. Stripe was founded by Irish brothers John and Patrick Collison founded Stripe in 2010. I\u2019m very familiar with the Irish, and the duo are extremely smart and have European way of thinking and mannerisms. \n\n**Background:** I presented the speculative evidence for Stripe being the target in A-Exhibits and timing in B-exhibits. A lot of these are scraped from various people who have done lots of digging. A speculative trade like this has high risk but also high reward. Nailing the timing on this would be tickets to retirement for some. So SPACs move massively on any news of discussion with a good target. Stripe is in my opinion as sweet honey. I highly doubt that Ackman and all those big investors like Guggenheim would invest in a SPAC without having a solid short list. I think their short list had Bloomberg and Stripe on it. They flirted with AirBnB and Coinbase just to see their chances. If any of those happened or a new sweet target emerged then they would do a quick second SPAC. They used PSTH to grab attention of other companies and see what they can attract for their future SPACs. Kind of like what Chamat did. I speculate that Stripe was their target and Stripe was just spending time getting ready for the Feb 17th announcement. All this is speculation. I also have read speculations about StarLink and Plaid and those really didn\u2019t hold any water. Collison brothers\u2019 way of running their companies has been very European like. Very cooperative and trusting of the process. They didn\u2019t mind giving a big chunk of their company to Y-combinator. They didn\u2019t mind hiring agitators. They just seem to operate like they live in Ireland and everyone is trustable. They are not used to dealing with NYC sharks. They are easy prey for a top predator like AckFuckingMan.  \n\n**Exhibit A-1: Stripe has been going on a hiring spree. 973 job postings vs last year 260** \n\n[https://stripe.com/jobs/search](https://stripe.com/jobs/search)\n\nBelow is how their site looks now:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/flnlxlslw9h61.png?width=722&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=87db6dabc36405f78023b03d4bc034796b530c2f\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBelow is how their postings looked in April of 2020\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4i8x16pnw9h61.png?width=684&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=669af8e7fa5c787bf7d50335fbcf5d438fc95792\n\nHiring needs money! They are obviously seeing a huge injection of money coming their way. \n\n**Exhibit A-2: Privacy statement of Stripe updated** \n\nNew text added regarding \u201cother entity which buys us\u201d to their privacy statement. \n\nBelow is the privacy statement once updated:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rrtoyxcqw9h61.png?width=668&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=86a4c8d22787ba4f57c3d79d5afd555895de24e4\n\nBelow is how it looked in early 2020: (see it is missing that sentence)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img w9qghpxrw9h61...*\n\n**Exhibit A-3: Bill Ackman follows 190 people on twitter and oddly 3 are stripe et al**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bf79j3ntw9h61.png?width=658&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1595fba57ccfa27260e3d53f21e8b7b5140ce393\n\n**Exhibit A-4: Ackman mentioned that he talked to stripe** \n\n[https://youtu.be/GmaCarSyBk4?t=917](https://youtu.be/GmaCarSyBk4?t=917)   Minute 15:17\n\nStripe wasn\u2019t ready to go public but they sure seem to be working towards it. Bill mentions \u201cManagement\u201d, \u201cInfrastructure\u201d, and \u201csystems\u201d. So that ties into exhibit A-1. Stripe is ready now. \n\n**Exhibit A-5: Stripe hires Dan Pontes, a post merger specialist**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/iz9vke0zw9h61.png?width=550&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=11a6383d6d40914b6722e39748bacb69422b3feb\n\n**Exhibit A-6: Stripe hires an army of lawyers in Q4 or 2020**\n\n[https://news.bloomberglaw.com/us-law-week/stripe-snags-half-dozen-lawyers-amid-new-fundraising-talks?context=search&amp;index=0](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/us-law-week/stripe-snags-half-dozen-lawyers-amid-new-fundraising-talks?context=search&amp;index=0)\n\n**Exhibit A-7: Stripe hires Christa Davies and Shannon Brayton**\n\nLooks like Stripe is getting ready to be public. \n\n[**https://stripe.com/newsroom/news/christa-davies-joins-stripe-board**](https://stripe.com/newsroom/news/christa-davies-joins-stripe-board)\n\n[**https://www.prweek.com/article/1704490/stripe-hires-shannon-brayton-comms-head**](https://www.prweek.com/article/1704490/stripe-hires-shannon-brayton-comms-head)\n\n**Exhibit A-8: Fundraising talks in Q4 of 2020**\n\nBloomberg reports that Stripe is in talks to raise money with a valuation north of 70B. So they were talking about getting more money at the same time that we suspected they were talking with Ackman\n\n[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-11-24/payments-startup-stripe-is-said-in-talks-to-raise-new-funding](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-11-24/payments-startup-stripe-is-said-in-talks-to-raise-new-funding)\n\n**Exhibit A-9: Ackman smearing the competition**\n\nStripe does not allow adult content payments. So Ackman starts smearing Visa and Mastercard\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8168jff1x9h61.png?width=549&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fc4d14060d90986ea669296ea4864aec78be03be\n\nStripe terms of service:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6wa4i7n2x9h61.png?width=558&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8ba0da12441f5df893c041649ddff8c2154f6185\n\n**Exhibit A-10: Corporations are usually expected to deny rumors.** \n\nSince December there has been no denial of rumors about this merger by either party. This points at NDA and ongoing developments. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cl4w71t4x9h61.png?width=564&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6a7c4700a54a3ac65ad9d1fb506d1cf040831dbe\n\n**Exhibit A-10: Jackie Reses** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nwnoow46x9h61.png?width=587&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5c0eebb0de8cba03967d156e53fc2bf166e12002\n\nShe has been liking Stripe T-shirts and was invited to ClubHouse by a stripe member via some degrees of separation. Jackie was the head of capital for square and stepped down. She has also been liking tweets from Ackman. \n\n**Exhibit A-10: Peter Collison interacted with posts about SPAC on Twitter.** \n\nThose were on Jan 8th. They have been deleted since. I could be wrong about this exhibit.\n\n=====================================================================\n\n**Exhibit B-1: Bill Ackman earnings call:**\n\n[https://centurylink.cwebcast.com/ses/2CUtOMyHmr7q63DSO2LpyA\\~\\~?ek=0fb7e9e1-3910-4dd3-a749-24f81df281ad](https://centurylink.cwebcast.com/ses/2CUtOMyHmr7q63DSO2LpyA~~?ek=0fb7e9e1-3910-4dd3-a749-24f81df281ad)\n\nMin 42:30\n\n*\u201cIn terms of timing, what we said at the time of the IPO is we said it would take us, we thought about six months to identify a target that we would be in a position to hopefully announce a deal by sometime in Q1 and then close the transaction in the ordinary course thereafter. Nothing that we have experienced to-date suggests that we won\u2019t meet our expected timeframe\u201d-* \n\n**Exhibit B-2: The two meetings are right one after another. Seems to be coordinated.** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h61sx429x9h61.png?width=633&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=15612de8d048b82be6287c5626e9c086601e0c54\n\n**Exhibit B-3: Note the bump in price and volume earlier this week**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img raei4tsax9h61...*\n\nThis points to some insiders getting ready for the announcement. \n\n**Exhibit B-4: IV on the call options suggest big imminent news**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cd58eumcx9h61.png?width=630&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=93925ea255d0296de7b7b6f003af3846968d2993\n\nThis was captured before news of 13G filed on Friday. \n\n**Exhibit B-5: Twitter activity**\n\nOn Feb 8th Bill tweeted a Rap Song about SPACs: [https://twitter.com/BillAckman/status/1358799402371076096](https://twitter.com/BillAckman/status/1358799402371076096)\n\nBill is not too active on twitter, nor is John Collison.\n\nPatrick and John Collison both had a notable reduction in twitter activity in first week of Feb and all of a sudden they came alive on Feb 8th. This is the day that PSTH shares jumped \\~6% on no news. Insiders buying? There was a lot of unexplained excitement on that day both in twitter behaviour of parties involved and price of PSTH. \n\n**Exhibit B-6: 13G filing by PSH**\n\nNews of raising more money coming out just now! See 13G filled on **2/12/21** after hours. \n\n[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1336528/000119312521041777/d105691dsc13g.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1336528/000119312521041777/d105691dsc13g.htm) \n\nI think there is a lot of confusion about this. People are saying that it is PSH increasing the PIPE, and this is pointing to a bigger deal. I think this is false. I think for that you need an S-3 filing. This is obviously above my paygrade and we need a securities lawyer to decipher this for us. What is noteworthy is that this simple news made **the stock move 10% and warrants move 25%.** So you see any small hints of positive news make this baby move massively.  \n\n**=================================================================================**\n\n**Notable Institutional Investors:**\n\nPERSHING SQUARE CAPITAL MANAGEMENT, L.P.  200,000,100 $5,544,002,772\n\nGUGGENHEIM CAPITAL LLC    22,000,000 $499,180,000\n\nBAUPOST GROUP LLC     12,707,924 $352,264,000\n\nCITADEL ADVISORS LLC     2,167,041 $49,170,000\n\nPEAK6 INVESTMENTS LLC **(CALL)**    577,400 $16,006,000 **(New Position)**\n\nGOLDMAN SACHS GROUP INC    299,498 $8,302,000 **(New Position)**\n\nIt is speculated by redditors that the prominent wealthy investor that Bill Ackman was talking about is either Warren B, Bill G, or the Warlton family. I think this doesn\u2019t matter since there is enough institutional and big money interest in this that money is not an issue. A celebrity name like Bill Gates or Warren B would be nice.",

        "selftext": "\nHello all!\n\nTest flight has been delay...so what? This is a long play. You can turn around and make good money off the space tourism but truthfully, this play is meant for the hypersonic point-to-point travel that will be coming to fruition sometime near 2025 pioneered by Virgin Galactic with the help of NASA, Rolls Royce, Boeing, and Lockheed Martin. \n\nLet's talk most recent timeline:\n\n**December 12 2020**: [The test flight didn't go as planned](https://www.virgingalactic.com/articles/virgin-galactic-update-on-test-flight-program/#:~:text=Virgin%20Galactic%20announced%20an%20update,America%2C%20New%20Mexico%20as%20planned), a software issue prevented the rocket from igniting. What can we take away from this? Truthfully, this became a more bullish signal and the charts reflect that. A large concern with this company was \"what if it blows up?\". This \"failed\" test flight proved that the fail safes in place are functioning and convinced long term holders to enter. One has to wonder if this flight purposely didn't succeed to change the fear and narrative regarding a fatal launch.\n\nFollowing this incident, there was a rather large decline in the price followed by a massive uptick where the price now floats between $50-60. \n\n**February 13 2021:** [The test flight was delayed](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/12/virgin-galactic-spce-shares-drop-as-company-delays-upcoming-spaceflight-test.html), and we saw an 8-9% drop on Friday due to that news. The news hit after hours and the market is closed today. It's hard to say if the price will continue falling this week or how the market will react to this. I follow the 3 days rule allowing news to circulate before assuming anything is complete. \n\n**February 2021:** I have heard rumors from other posts that a spokeswoman announced the test flight is still predicted to happen within the month of February. If someone could confirm or deny this that would be fantastic.\n\n**Q1 2021:** The [Q3 Earnings Presentation](https://s24.q4cdn.com/816362521/files/doc_financials/Quarterly/2020/q3/Virgin-Galactic-Q3-2020-Earnings-Presentation.pdf) outlines the plans that remain the same but are now pushed back. We are waiting on three flights before this gets really insane:\n\n1. This upcoming test flight will be the first spaceflight from Spaceport America, NM. It will be a revenue generating flight carrying NASA payloads, there will be no passengers (just the two pilots), and it will complete the data needed for FAA V&amp;V elements.\n2. The second test flight from Spaceport America will have two pilots and four employees in the cabin. \n3. The third test flight will be carrying Sir Richard Branson himself to space marking the start of commercial operations and PR. (I think it's likely this flight doesn't take place until Q2)\n\nOnce Branson goes up (presumably sometime in Q2 even though they are still claiming Q1) and commercial operations begin the 600+ individuals who have already purchased tickets will begin their flights. [Here is a list of some noteworthy celebrities who will be flying shortly after Branson.](https://www.thetravel.com/ashton-kutcher-and-19-other-celebs-going-to-space-before-you-are/) The amount of PR that will come from this is astounding. Imagine if Rhianna or Bieber record a music video up there? Or if Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis share a kiss or renew their vows in space? Even without these major kind of events, the PR from celebrities posting videos of them going up period is mind-boggling. \n\n**Surviving to 2025:**\n\nThis is all well and good, Space Tourism is a huge market waiting to be tapped that both Jeff Bezos (Blue Origin) and Elon Musk (SpaceX) are attempting to break into. Blue Origin is a director competitor in the space tourism sector as they will be providing a similar experience to sub-orbit. SpaceX is an indirect competitor because as it stands their space tourism will be orbital space, we are talking like a week long multi-million dollar vacation. \n\nCurrently, SPCE has one Space Plane and their second one is almost complete. They are predicting $1BN/spaceport/year.\n\nThere are other revenue streams such as running NASA payloads, scientists, data collection, and astronaut training as well. \n\nGiven that Virgin Galactic has this revenue plus $742 million as of September 30, 2020; I feel it is safe to say they will not have trouble surviving until 2025, in fact, it appears they will be quite profitable until that date.\n\n**Beyond 2025:**\n\n[Ark claims hypersonic point-to-point travel could evolve into a $270BN market](https://ark-invest.com/articles/analyst-research/hypersonic-flight-market/). Virgin Galactic is certainly leading the charge in this industry with Boeing, Rolls Royce, and NASA helping this come to fruition. Let's play with this number for a little:\n\nVirgin Galactic Shares Outstanding: 234.34M\n\nMarket cap of Hypersonic Travel: $270BN\n\nLet's make 3 assumptions, SPCE is the first and has 100% of the market, SPCE and SpaceX arrive at the same time and share 50/50 of the market, a lot happens over the next several years and SPCE has 20% of this market.\n\n1. SPCE has 100% of the market: $1152.17/share\n2. SPCE has 50% of the market: $576.09/share\n3. SPCE has 20% of the market: $230.42/share\n\nWhat's fascinating is even in the worst case scenario in this discussion we are looking at a 320.47% increase in price on hypersonic travel alone. That is very important to note. None of this includes the revenue generated elsewhere including the starting stream of space tourism.\n\nLet's look at Space Tourism, [the predicted market cap is $3BN](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/26/space-tourism-how-spacex-virgin-galactic-blue-origin-axiom-compete.html), which truthfully I find terribly undervalued. \n\nIf we account for hypersonic travel, space tourism, NASA payloads, gov't contracts, etc then my PT by 2025 is a $500 minimum. \n\n**Beyond 2030:**\n\n**Sci-Fi isn't really Sci-Fi anymore...it's just Sci:**\n\nThe possibilities of this company are about as boundless as space itself. Let's talk about some other future revenue streams that will be possible.\n\n1. Cargo transportation. If you thought 2-day delivery was imagine if cargo can be delivered anywhere on the planet in 90 minutes or less. Specifically time-sensitive cargo; something like a heart for a transplant or a vaccination that needs to arrive asap. We are long past the days of delivery via dog sled. Weather won't be a concern as these flights will take place ABOVE the weather.\n2. Military use - I mean the only difference between Virgin Galactic's space plane and something out of Star Wars is weaponry. I don't see why they wouldn't mount weapons and sell these space crafts to the Space Force. Think SpaceX is the main carrier and this space planes can launch from there.\n3. Interplanetary travel - Self landing rockets are all the hype, but what if a large carrier could orbit around a planet and send planes down for recon? They wouldn't need to use any fuel or anything to land so all their fuel could be used to relaunch back into space where they are grabbed by an arm on the carrier and pulled back in for refueling. The only thing that would be required is a place to land.\n4. Hypersonic travel - I already mentioned this but I need to emphasize how incredibly important this actually is. The airplane was invented in 1903 and for the past 118 years it has remained the fastest and most effective way for humans to travel. This industry is due for a revolution and I think this is it. I imagine when hypersonic first starts it will be akin to private jets regarding cost and public availability. But as the industry expands I think this will become the common way for humans to travel. Instead of airplanes and airports, it will be space planes and space ports.\n5. The list goes on and on and I don't want to speculate too far into the future of all the possibilities.\n\n**One thing is certain, the Space Age is upon us:**\n\nWhile there are many companies emerging in this market it is a HUGE market with near limitless potential. Virgin Galactic and SpaceX are leading the charge in these sectors. Companies like Momentus will be important to the industry as well, but the pioneers of this age are clear.\n\n**Let's Talk Technology:**\n\n[VMS Eve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VMS_Eve) is the name of the [WhiteKnightTwo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scaled_Composites_White_Knight_Two) mothership which is a custom aircraft. It looks like two airplanes attached together. [SpaceShipTwo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceShipTwo) is the space plane that attaches to the mothership. VMS Eve takes off like a normal airplane and ascends to 50,000 feet before releasing SpaceShipTwo. The boosters on SpaceShipTwo ignite and the space plane ascends 51.4 miles above the earths surface breaking into space (sub-orbit) where it conducts a slow backflip which creates microgravity (something NASA desperately wants to study). This is where the passengers become weightless in the cabin for 6 minutes. [The cabin](https://blog.dupontregistry.com/the-lifestyle/virgin-galactic-spaceships-cabin-interior-revealed/) has more windows than any other space craft and contains 16 cameras which will record the entire event. Once the backflip is complete the space plane re-enters the Earth's atmosphere and glides to land like a normal airplane. [Here is the first flight to space that demonstrates the technology.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h8T9mVkGh3s)\n\nRegarding hypersonic point-to-point travel; last year Virgin Galactic and Rolls Royce [unveiled the Mach 3 design](https://www.virgingalactic.com/articles/virgin-galactic-unveils-mach-3-aircraft-design-for-high-speed-travel-and-signs-memorandum-of-understanding-with-rolls-royce/) which is expected to be completed by 2025. The altitude will be 60,000 feet and have a capacity for 9-19 people. At first, I think this will dominate the private jet industry. [On a large private jet:](https://www.afar.com/magazine/how-much-does-a-private-jet-cost) $51,600 to $78,000 (14 to 19 passengers) for a 6 hour cross-country trip. \n\nThe designs for the Virgin Galactic/Rolls Royce Mach III craft make a trip around the GLOBE in 90 minutes and with the state-of-the-art sustainable aviation fuel, it is quite possible, if not probable that this is a more energy efficient and cost-effective method. \n\nIn my opinion, the first industry that this will take over is the private jet industry and will slowly but surely make its way into the commercial airliner industry.\n\n**Key Staff and Players:**\n\nFounder - Sir Richard Branson: Founder of the Virgin Group (Virgin Mobile, Virgin Atlantic, etc.)  \nCEO - Michael Colglazier: Former President and Managing Director of Disney Parks International  \nCTO (Chief Space Officer) - George Whitesides: Former Chief of Staff NASA  \nCFO - Jon Campagna: Former Corporate Controller of ICON Aircraft Inc.\n\n**Noteworthy Investors**:  \nVanguard  \nBank of America  \nMorgan Stanley  \nARK  \nBoeing  \nChamath Palihapitiya (Also a Virgin Galactic Chairman)  \nCathie Wood (presumably through ARKK)\n\n**Partners**:  \nBoeing ( investor/hopes to be a part of the hypersonic point-to-point travel )  \nRolls Royce ( designing and developing engine propulsion technology for high speed commercial aircraft as well as interior design )  \nNASA ( a plethora of tasks including transportation to the ISS, research, and hypersonic point-to-point travel )  \nLockheed Martin ( developer of the Supersonic X-59 plane which will be used for testing hypersonic travel )  \nUnder Armour (suits)\n\n**Bear Case:**\n\n1. What if it explodes?\n   1. As I stated before the last test flight to me demonstrated that the fail safes in place will prevent this from happening and the chart reflects that notion. Aside from that, I hate to be that guy, but fatalities are expected with companies especially in emerging technologies. Remember when [Tesla decapitated someone](https://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-tesla-florida-accident-20190302-story.html)? Or [the growing list of Airline incidents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_accidents_and_incidents_involving_airliners_in_the_United_States)? Or how about when [a Remington trigger malfunction killed hundreds](https://cooperhurley.com/blog/remington-700-trigger-malfunction-may-have-killed-and-maimed-hundreds/)? While I will not justify these events, I bring them to light to allow us to remember, this happens. I do not think this would be fatal for the company. Virgin Galactic [had a fatality in 2014](https://www.space.com/30073-virgin-galactic-spaceshiptwo-crash-pilot-error.html) and not a single person asked for a refund on their tickets.\n2. SpaceX:\n   1. This one just bothers me. They are two completely different markets. Sub-orbital vs. orbital space. Even if they were in direct competition with one another, that's hardly a bad thing to be SpaceX's largest competitor. Competition is good for companies, it makes the market itself grow and the companies within the sector grow with it. When it comes to Space Tourism, SpaceX is a completely different type of tourism that costs millions and is a week long trip. The only real competition will be in the hypersonic market, however, Elon intends on using his [hypersonic capabilities](https://newatlas.com/elon-musk-mars-update-mars/51558/?itm_source=newatlas&amp;itm_medium=article-body) for Mars colonization although I think he would be silly to NOT also provide this service on Earth.\n3. It is a hype driven stock:\n   1. This is the one I can agree with. We are pre-revenue, pre-publicity, and pre-commercial operations. The price right now is pure hype and speculation on what Virgin Galactic COULD become. Once we start seeing ER after commercial flights have started a more fundamental approach could be taken based on actual profit. I think this will remain hyped for a very long time as I mentioned early, most investors aren't here for space tourism. Space tourism is the PayPal, hypersonic flight is the Tesla.\n\nThank you all for reading, **if you don't want to actually read this check out the video DD:**\n\n[Video DD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V4VxAuQDFM)\n\n**TL;DR:** Space tourism is the start, hypersonic point-to-point travel is the golden nugget. This isn't some new technology, it's a revolution in human travel. Watch carefully this week. The test flight was delayed and that news was announced ATH on Friday. It is possible that we see a sell-off happen at market open. I don't know how long the sell-off will go or how big of an impact this will have. In the past delays and issues made the price plummet, however, there are new long term investors who might not even flinch at this news. This week is a **buying opportunity**. \n\nIf this DD was too long and the video DD was also too long check out the Too Long Didn't Watch (TL;DW) video here: \n\n[TL;DW Video DD](https://youtu.be/AKhDnS3Ipic)",

        "selftext": "So most of the stocks posted that people like for the long term have some insane floats, about 1 billion+ and sure some have market caps that are low, usually 200-300m or less but even with low market caps I can't see a stock price rising higher than $1-$3 (this assumes ofc that the company is very very good for the future and truly can change things) because of the shares outstanding or am I wrong?\n\nNow TSNP kind of doesn't match up with what I said about in that it went from pennyland to dollar land even though it has 5b market cap and 3.9b shares outstanding but lets say a company like TSNP (ignore the HUMBL ticker change for a sec) if they were to stay the same company how much higher than $1 can they get with a 5b market cap and 3.9b shares outstanding? The only way I would see it going insane price is if they do something game changing which personally after ticker change I see them changing the game when compared to paypal so for this example I would say it def has potential to go much much higher than $1 if they execute correctly but assuming it was an ordinary company how much higher could it get with a market cap and shares outstanding that large?\n\nSome other examples is OZSC (1b cap, 3b shares outstanding) SNPW (139m, 966m shares outstanding), INND (215m cap, 3b shares outstanding).\n\nEach of those companies need to literally be game changers in order to get past $1 no? Like when I look at the Apples, Teslas, Amazons, and Microsofts of the world and other big time blue chip companies most have 1B shares outstanding or less but those companies are like literally game changer\n\nSome of these OTC stocks already have shares outstanding 1B+ and they are nowhere near the level of those blue chip stocks, so if these OTC stocks to have insane share prices they would need market caps that are just as big if not more than blue chip stocks so really my main goal behind this post is to try to find some sort of exit strategy for these \"long hold OTC\" stocks.  \n\nFinal summary: In my opinion, since OTC stocks have super high caps and shares, if they are truly a long term hold they should be able to reach $1 even with those high caps/shares BUT to get past $1 and get to $10 $50 $100+ is near impossible unless they completely change the game like the blue chips mentioned above, therefore, isn't it smart to pull out of these pennystocks once they reach dollar land because the odds of them \"changing the game\" is prob super low. \n\nWhats your thoughts? I understand most people trade pennystocks for a day or less, while others like to play the long term and wait for all PRs/catalysts before deciding what to do, for the people who like long term pennystocks do you plan to hold after dollar land and if so how high you think these insanely high caps/shares can go?\n\nThanks!",

        "selftext": "**Stocks end their worst week since October at their lowest point on Friday. Is the Short-Squeeze Over? Over 100 companies report earnings this week. Let\u2019s talk about this &amp; other stock market news**\n\nHello everyone and Good Morning! So, let\u2019s start with the recap of Friday as we saw the stock market finish with another sell-off, as the big 3 indices finished with the worst week since late October with the [SP500](https://ibb.co/Vpq92y3) losing almost 2%, the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/yN3b3RQ) losing exactly 2% and the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/D7Cy2YQ) shedding 620 points and dropping below 30k. All 3 of them finished the week down more than 3% as the [VIX](https://ibb.co/cgz4N3r) spiked yet again on Friday, rising by almost 10% and finishing the week up more than 40%.\n\nWe saw over 70% of the companies declining [Friday](https://ibb.co/G3rX22D), as the number of companies trading above the 50-day moving average dropped under 50%, with all 11 [sectors](https://ibb.co/HKhY6hC) finishing in the red again, as Energy &amp; Tech were the biggest losers. \n\nSo, let\u2019s take a look at the HEAT MAP from [Friday](https://ibb.co/jVFqVbH). It\u2019s really hard to find any gaining companies, with big tech companies selling off yet again, as most of the small gainers were found in the Health Care sector. For the [WEEK](https://ibb.co/5Y5HR4q)  though, Microsoft was the only big tech name that managed to gain ground after smashing the earnings report, while most of the stock market faced sell-off pressures as the short squeeze mania might have pushed investors into a risk-off approach.\n\nWe also got some economic data on Friday as the December personal disposable [INCOME](https://ibb.co/Khyh7mP) increase by 0.6%, more than expected as this mostly reflected an increase in social benefits &amp; compensations, with the Q4 employment cost [INDEX](https://ibb.co/QcqbM5y) also rising by 0.7% to close out the year.\n\nMeanwhile we saw the Consumer Sentiment [INDEX](https://ibb.co/pX3mFgt) coming in at 79, slightly lower than expected, as this was also seen in the December pending home sales [NUMBER](https://ibb.co/m4tbnWN), which also came in with a 0.3% decrease month/month.\n\nThis week we have somewhat of a quiet economic [CALENDAR](https://ibb.co/LvYY84v), with a couple of interesting numbers through the week, while [EARNINGS](https://ibb.co/rxmpwVK) take center stage yet again, with interesting reports coming from companies like Amazon, Google &amp; Alibaba on Tuesday, while Wednesday we hear from PayPal, Qualcomm &amp; Spotify. We also get earnings reports from some recent favorites like Pinterest, Snap, Ford, Peloton and Penn on Thursday as the earnings season with over 100 companies from the SP500 reporting, might help push the stock market higher after the sell-off last week.\n\nIn some other stock market news, we saw [NIO](https://ibb.co/C0CSdJJ) reporting a new monthly record with 7225 vehicles delivered in the first month of 2021, an increase of more than 350% Y/Y as the company is still ramping up production in an attempt to challenge Tesla\u2019s EV dominance. Nio has had a huge run in the past months but has a long way to go to grow into the big valuation, though the trajectory of the company looks very promising.\n\nMeanwhile the biggest development in the markets was the trading platforms [imposing](https://ibb.co/y5sPVJv) restrictions on the squeezed stocks and even many other stocks that didn\u2019t have such a big short % of the float with big names like AMD, Starbucks &amp; Moderna being affected. These restrictions were reduced back to only 8 companies [Sunday](https://ibb.co/GV5TKxf), but are still limited to whole share aggregate buy limits on the crowd favorites.\n\nThe recent moves in the stock market have made some big changes in the social world as Steve Cohen deactivate his [Twitter](https://ibb.co/0KK2P59), while a recent [survey](https://ibb.co/Mf6V8tz) showed that more than \u00be of respondents are planning on leaving RBNHD while 13% already did it, with the limiting tactics being probably the biggest reason for retail investors to make this change.\n\nInteractive [Brokers](https://ibb.co/JzR5qCC) also re-opened trading on these names on Sunday, which brings to question if these platforms have insider knowledge of the future of the stocks, or did they just increased their liquidity just like [RBNHD](https://ibb.co/P6WXwDj) after they raised more than $1B earlier in the week.\n\nSo\u2026 I think the stock market is still very volatile and the short squeezes can keep on going for an unknown period of time as markets can act in an unusual pattern for longer than anyone can anticipate, or the short squeeze can vanish in a second\u2026 this one is very hard to predict\u2026 Yes, keep the pedal to the medal in the hot stocks but also stay invested in great companies as good earnings reports haven\u2019t helped most stocks again this quarter, but may provide good buying opportunities for the long-term.\n\nAnd finally, let\u2019s hope for a good day in the markets as the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/wc2P16r) are pointing to a good open with the Nasdaq leading the way as we await to see the Manufacturing Indexes numbers in the early [morning](https://ibb.co/LvYY84v).\n\n**Thank you everyone for reading\ud83d\ude4f Hope you enjoyed the content!

        "selftext": "#Good morning traders and investors of the r/stocks sub! Welcome to Thursday! Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp; news on this Thursday-\n\n*****\n\n# [5 things to know before the stock market opens Thursday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/04/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-february-4-2021.html)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 1. Dow, S&amp;P 500 look to extend their rallies to four straight days\n\n&gt; * U.S. stock futures rose Thursday as the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&amp;P 500 looked to add to their three-session winning streaks. The Nasdaq on Wednesday dipped after two straight days of strong advances. The Dow and S&amp;P 500 eked gains Wednesday following rallies Monday and Tuesday as the Reddit-fueled retail trading frenzy dissipated.\n\n&gt; * GameStop was once again volatile, finishing up nearly 2.7% at $92.41 per share Wednesday but still down 71% from Friday\u2019s close of $325. In last week\u2019s 400% surge, shares reached an all-time intraday high of $483 each. GameStop rose modestly in Thursday\u2019s premarket.\n\n&gt; * The Labor Department is set to release its weekly look at jobless claims at 8:30 a.m. ET. Economists expect 830,000 filings for initial unemployment benefits for the week ending Jan. 30. That would be down from the prior week\u2019s 847,000. The government reports its January employment report Friday. ADP said Wednesday 174,000 jobs were added last month at U.S. companies, more than triple expectations.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 2. Ken Frazier to retire as Merck CEO at end of June\n\n&gt; * Merck Chairman and CEO Ken Frazier will retire effective June 30. He\u2019ll be replaced as CEO by company CFO Robert Davis. Frazier, 66, will become executive chairman for what the drugmaker described as a \u201ctransition period to be determined by the board.\u201d Frazier, one of the few Black corporate leaders in the United States, has served as Merck\u2019s chief executive since January 2011.\n\n&gt; * Frazier\u2019s retirement was announced Thursday morning shortly before Merck reported fourth-quarter earnings and revenue that fell short of estimates. Per-share profit was $1.32 on $12.5 billion in revenue. Merck forecast full-year 2021 earnings between $6.48 to $6.68 per share, which were higher than analyst expectations. Dow stock Merck was little changed in the premarket.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 3. Apple and Hyundai-Kia pushing toward deal on Apple Car\n\n&gt; * Apple shares rose nearly 2% in Thursday\u2019s premarket, the morning after CNBC reported, according to multiple sources, the tech giant is close to finalizing a deal with Hyundai-Kia to manufacture an Apple-branded autonomous electric vehicle at the Kia assembly plant in West Point, Georgia. The so-called \u201cApple Car,\u201d which is being developed by a team at Apple, is tentatively scheduled to go into production in 2024, though people familiar with the talks said the eventual rollout could be pushed back.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 4. Klobuchar unveils antitrust reform that would impact Big Tech\n\n&gt; * Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., unveiled a sweeping antitrust reform bill Thursday, setting a tough tone in her new role as chair of the Senate Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust. If enacted, it would bring significantly more risk to companies like Facebook and Alphabet-owned Google, which are already facing federal lawsuits, and to any dominant firm seeking to acquire another company. House antitrust subcommittee chairman David Cicilline, D-R.I., has similarly called for extensive reforms that would impact Big Tech.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 5. Biden signals flexibility on Covid stimulus\n\n&gt; * President Joe Biden encouraged Democratic lawmakers to \u201cact fast\u201d on his $1.9 trillion coronavirus rescue plan but also signaled flexibility. Changes he indicated he would consider include limiting proposed $1,400 direct payments to Americans with lower income levels, which directionally could draw support from Republicans who want a much smaller package. Biden told lawmakers in private comments Wednesday he\u2019s \u201cnot married\u201d to an absolute number for the overall bill but wants them to \u201cgo big\u201d on pandemic relief and \u201crestore the soul of the country.\u201d\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/7HyJrkD.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/4D1ZzFL.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/xv1RdWa.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/I3EtDfQ.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/oDg1a06.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/kyPHRhw.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/mrLePbl.jpg)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/qHQpeLy.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/XvyTr2i.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/7qIfxls.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/2Ygir5N.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/jOyOkJG.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/WnzRtqa.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/ouXy3Xv.png)**)\n\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/gBzCmaO.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/f8ItHFz.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/SS9oUVD.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/04/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-in-the-premarket-canada-goose-ebay-paypal-qualcomm-more.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; **Canada Goose (GOOS)** \u2013 Canada Goose shares surged more than 15% in the premarket after the outerwear maker beat estimates on both the top and bottom lines.

        "selftext": "Elon Musk is a billionaire and the reason is that he has made an electric car company, a space company, a paypal company and much more. Jeff Bezos is a billionaire who has built one of the most incredible companies of our time in Amazon that provides value to people all over the world. Bill Gates is a billionaire who built a company Microsoft used by companies all over the world.\n\nWhat have the hedge funds built? What value do they provide to the society? I have long wondered about how billionaires make their money and I have never understood how those who did it by starting hedge funds make so much money. BUT, now it is CRYSTAL CLEAR.\n\nPerhaps not all hedge funds, but many of them are a HUGE FRAUD. They don't really \"do\" anything. Clearly they manipulate stock prices through short ladder attacks, naked short selling, media manipulation and much more. By limiting clients to net worth of at least 1 billion dollars, they have control over enormous amounts of dollars that allows them to move markets just by making buys and sells. On top of that, they participate in shorting like GME at ridiculous levels over 100% which is not even logical. They have their own brokerages, their own data on order flow.  These hedge funds have figured out how to scam and manipulate the game in order to gain enormous amounts of money. They operate in secrecy with minimal reporting requirements. They buy off politicians by making enormous donations to candidates of BOTH political sides ensuring no legislation to halt their corrupt practices. They probably sit in the hamptons mansion laughing at how easy it is and how all the other stupid people in the country actually work hard for such little amounts of money. \n\nThis is their game. They have figured it out how to take advantage of the system. While other works hard in real jobs in healthcare or science or engineering or whatever else, they sit somewhere in the Hamptons laughing at how little work is needed for them to earn such ridiculous sums of money. Then, they buy sports franchises and yachts. Its all just a game that they have rigged. Just look at Jefferey Epstein, another hedge fund billionaire. Was he doing any work? Nope, he was running an elaborate child sex trafficking operation day to day because of all the free time he had. Epstein didn't even have much of any formal education. But, he probably knew the right people to get into the hedge fund world and learned the game. \n\nIts all an enormous game of manipulation, fraud and scams secretly known to a handful of people who believe the rest of the world are fools who will never catch on. The common man must find ways to follow their actions and look for more opportunities like GME to take them head on because there will be little or no action we can expect from incompetent and corrupt government officials.",

Big Investment by Warren Buffett Could Be Disclosed Tomorrow.Andrew Bary\u2022\ud83d\udcf7Last Updated February 15, 2021, 5:30 AM\n\nWhat is the Berkshire Hathaway mystery stock?\n\nWarren Buffett's conglomerate could reveal that equity holding when it discloses its stock investments as of Dec. 31, 2020 on a securities filing expected late Tuesday.\n\nSpeculation is that it could be Walt Disney (ticker: DIS), PayPal Holdings (PYPL), Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL), Home Depot (HD), Exxon Mobil (XOM), or Chevron (CVX).\n\nWhen it released its most recent quarterly filing in mid-November for about $250 billion of equity holdings, Berkshire (BRK.B) said that it had made a confidential filing for unnamed investments, stating \"Confidential information has been omitted from the public Form 13F report and filed separately with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\"\n\nBerkshire CEO Buffett has rarely made use of a confidential filing in the past decade. The last such one was in 2015, and the mystery holding turned out to be Phillips 66 (PSX).\n\nThe SEC can grant institutional investors confidential status if it agrees that public disclosure would move the stock price and make it more difficult for the investor to complete its buying program in the stock. It is possible that Berkshire will continue to keep the mystery holding confidential. News of a new Berkshire holding can sometimes boost the stock, thanks to the Buffett imprimatur.\n\nThe mystery holding could be sizable, at $5 billion to $10 billion.\n\nGary Black, a private investor and former CEO of both Aegon Asset Management and Janus Capital, surveyed his more than 50,000 Twitter followers and their top choices among four selections were Disney and PayPal.\n\nBlack has been an influential bull on Tesla (TSLA), but said last week that he was out of the stock, citing the company's lack of a clear forecast on 2021 deliveries and the risk of a first-quarter earnings miss.\n\nIn recent quarters, Buffett has sold out of Berkshire's holding in Goldman Sachs Group (GS), sharply reduced a stake in JPMorgan Chase (JPM), cut a longtime position in Wells Fargo (WFC) and bought stakes in a group of drug stocks notably Merck (MRK), AbbVie (ABBV), and Bristol Myers Squibb (BMY).",

Before I buy into them, however, i wanted to get any feedback or suggestions on those stocks and ETFs. I am aiming for medium risk, and i don't want it to be like a 3% yearly return from a saving account. I am still young and learning so I have time to win and lose. I'd say I'm looking for around 10% return per annum.  The list of stocks I have in my list so far is below. The stocks are mostly blue-chip stocks, but I chose those from a list of around 30 stocks based on my research, Also, I know an etf can cover most of those stocks, but i feel like i can get more from having them individually unless I'm wrong in this aspect.\n\n\\- Stocks: Facebook, Apple, Microsoft, Adobe, Airbnb, square inc, alphabet, Netflix, PayPal, Shopify, NVIDIA, Amazon, Walt Disney.\n\n\\-ETFs: IUSA, HMCH, EQQQ, VUSA, MSCI, IH2O, VWRL, IUKD",

        "selftext": "https://m.imgur.com/gallery/4ihSh22\n\n# Strategy\n&gt;...That was the unseen message. I mean, nobody ever said it that way. So, I have seen half of the United States\u2019 talent basically put off to the side. - Warren Buffet\n\nI find that the most valuable investing tool is to pay attention to the obvious and to keep investments simple to understand. I expect a few things to happen throughout the years as I invest, and I try to be sensible about those changes. Time is on my side.\n\n- Industrial processes will improve greatly by way of automation technology.\n- Research into materials improve, in order to solve significant challenges related to global climate &amp; health.\n- US women and minorities education rates will cause dramatic changes in economic opportunity.\n- Financial regulations will lower to adjust for the level of trust that cybersecurity applications bring to its system.\n- Trade between the US &amp; Mexico will increase.\n- Cloud computing will serve as a bridge for many economic frontiers.\n\nAs the saying goes, invest in what you know. So let\u2019s get on with it, technology and industrials.\n\nMy strategy is to build an engine that I can debate about and get behind the wheel on. It can change over time, but it\u2019s the critical thought process that matters at the end. It\u2019s an engine that I want to trust to run through the good times and bad so that I am not nearly as concerned with current financial statuses at certain periods of time.\n \n## Cash (15-30%)\n\nThe most critical element to my portfolio is a constant rate of cash per month. This is a \u201cjoker card\u201d, if you will, where eventually the growing cash pile will eventually be invested when the opportunity is right and resets to 0. This holding is reserved for highly desired investment opportunities like:\n\n- Impossible Foods\n- MOD Pizza\n- Reddit\n- RH (don\u2019t hurt me)\n\nIt is a pile of cash that searches for a wonderful company at a fair price. \n\n## Industrial (20-35%)\n\nThis element to my portfolio helps me sleep at night. The goal here is to try to capture important elements to a healthier North American industrial sector. The name of the game is **quality** and to capture broader markets. \n\nAt the speculative level, the economic consequences of industrial automation should start to gain more impact. One could argue that the value of precision measurement will increase as machines handle more material, for example.\n\n1. AMD - _Computing_\n2. Mettler-Toledo - _Precision Scales &amp; Analytic Instruments_\n3. Ecolab - _Sanitation, water, energy, and air management_\n4. Kansas City Southern - _Mexican-American Trade_\n5. Rockwell Automation - _Industrial controls_\n\n  \n## Cloud Compute (45-60%)\n\nThese are my general bets on technology. I found it enormously challenging to go through the exercise of selecting a stock between industry leaders like Square &amp; PayPal or Alphabet &amp; Apple.\n\nI\u2019ve included where these companies are consequential, and why they will sustain growth as a result.\n\n1. Pinterest - _Discovery Engine (Women driven markets)_\n2. Square - _Financial Access (Underbanking solutions)_\n3. Alphabet - _Internet (Distribution of education technology)_\n4. Fastly - _Networking (Serverless compute)_\n\n  \n## ETFS and Watchlist (10-20%)\n\nThese holdings are held in order to track certain industry \u201cbets\u201d like robotics, electric grids, cyber security, gaming, semiconductors and the like. The point is to diversify almost excessively here and to observe changes over time.\n\n- FTXL First Trust US Semiconductor\n- CIBR First Trust Cybersecurity\n- GRID First Trust Smartgrid Infrastructure\n\n- ARKQ Ark Autonomous Technology &amp; Robotics\n- ARKG Ark Genomic Revolution\n- ARKF Ark Fintech Innovation\n\n- ICLN iShares Global Clean Energy\n- EWW iShares Mexico\n- SOXX iShares US Semiconductor\n- IYM iShares Basic Materials\n\n- Berkshire\n- Tesla\n- Sherwin Williams\n- James Hardie PLC\n- AirBnB\n- Elastic",

        "selftext": "**Stocks end their worst week since October at their lowest point on Friday. Is the Short-Squeeze Over? Over 100 companies report earnings this week. Let\u2019s talk about this &amp; other stock market news**\n\nHello everyone and Good Morning! So, let\u2019s start with the recap of Friday as we saw the stock market finish with another sell-off, as the big 3 indices finished with the worst week since late October with the [SP500](https://ibb.co/Vpq92y3) losing almost 2%, the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/yN3b3RQ) losing exactly 2% and the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/D7Cy2YQ) shedding 620 points and dropping below 30k. All 3 of them finished the week down more than 3% as the [VIX](https://ibb.co/cgz4N3r) spiked yet again on Friday, rising by almost 10% and finishing the week up more than 40%.\n\nWe saw over 70% of the companies declining [Friday](https://ibb.co/G3rX22D), as the number of companies trading above the 50-day moving average dropped under 50%, with all 11 [sectors](https://ibb.co/HKhY6hC) finishing in the red again, as Energy &amp; Tech were the biggest losers. \n\nSo, let\u2019s take a look at the HEAT MAP from [Friday](https://ibb.co/jVFqVbH). It\u2019s really hard to find any gaining companies, with big tech companies selling off yet again, as most of the small gainers were found in the Health Care sector. For the [WEEK](https://ibb.co/5Y5HR4q)  though, Microsoft was the only big tech name that managed to gain ground after smashing the earnings report, while most of the stock market faced sell-off pressures as the short squeeze mania might have pushed investors into a risk-off approach.\n\nWe also got some economic data on Friday as the December personal disposable [INCOME](https://ibb.co/Khyh7mP) increase by 0.6%, more than expected as this mostly reflected an increase in social benefits &amp; compensations, with the Q4 employment cost [INDEX](https://ibb.co/QcqbM5y) also rising by 0.7% to close out the year.\n\nMeanwhile we saw the Consumer Sentiment [INDEX](https://ibb.co/pX3mFgt) coming in at 79, slightly lower than expected, as this was also seen in the December pending home sales [NUMBER](https://ibb.co/m4tbnWN), which also came in with a 0.3% decrease month/month.\n\nThis week we have somewhat of a quiet economic [CALENDAR](https://ibb.co/LvYY84v), with a couple of interesting numbers through the week, while [EARNINGS](https://ibb.co/rxmpwVK) take center stage yet again, with interesting reports coming from companies like Amazon, Google &amp; Alibaba on Tuesday, while Wednesday we hear from PayPal, Qualcomm &amp; Spotify. We also get earnings reports from some recent favorites like Pinterest, Snap, Ford, Peloton and Penn on Thursday as the earnings season with over 100 companies from the SP500 reporting, might help push the stock market higher after the sell-off last week.\n\nIn some other stock market news, we saw [NIO](https://ibb.co/C0CSdJJ) reporting a new monthly record with 7225 vehicles delivered in the first month of 2021, an increase of more than 350% Y/Y as the company is still ramping up production in an attempt to challenge Tesla\u2019s EV dominance. Nio has had a huge run in the past months but has a long way to go to grow into the big valuation, though the trajectory of the company looks very promising.\n\nMeanwhile the biggest development in the markets was the trading platforms [imposing](https://ibb.co/y5sPVJv) restrictions on the squeezed stocks and even many other stocks that didn\u2019t have such a big short % of the float with big names like AMD, Starbucks &amp; Moderna being affected. These restrictions were reduced back to only 8 companies [Sunday](https://ibb.co/GV5TKxf), but are still limited to whole share aggregate buy limits on the crowd favorites.\n\nThe recent moves in the stock market have made some big changes in the social world as Steve Cohen deactivate his [Twitter](https://ibb.co/0KK2P59), while a recent [survey](https://ibb.co/Mf6V8tz) showed that more than \u00be of respondents are planning on leaving RBNHD while 13% already did it, with the limiting tactics being probably the biggest reason for retail investors to make this change.\n\nInteractive [Brokers](https://ibb.co/JzR5qCC) also re-opened trading on these names on Sunday, which brings to question if these platforms have insider knowledge of the future of the stocks, or did they just increased their liquidity just like [RBNHD](https://ibb.co/P6WXwDj) after they raised more than $1B earlier in the week.\n\nSo\u2026 I think the stock market is still very volatile and the short squeezes can keep on going for an unknown period of time as markets can act in an unusual pattern for longer than anyone can anticipate, or the short squeeze can vanish in a second\u2026 this one is very hard to predict\u2026 Yes, keep the pedal to the medal in the hot stocks but also stay invested in great companies as good earnings reports haven\u2019t helped most stocks again this quarter, but may provide good buying opportunities for the long-term.\n\nAnd finally, let\u2019s hope for a good day in the markets as the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/wc2P16r) are pointing to a good open with the Nasdaq leading the way as we await to see the Manufacturing Indexes numbers in the early [morning](https://ibb.co/LvYY84v).\n\n**Thank you everyone for reading\ud83d\ude4f Hope you enjoyed the content!
