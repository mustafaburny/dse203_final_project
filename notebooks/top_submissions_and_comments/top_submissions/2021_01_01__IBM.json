        "selftext": " **Mods do not delete, this is important to me, please read**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was in my early teens during the '08 crisis. I vividly remember the enormous repercussions that the reckless actions by those on Wall Street had in my personal life, and the lives of those close to me. I was fortunate - my parents were prudent and a little paranoid, and they had some food storage saved up. When that crisis hit our family, we were able to keep our little house, but we lived off of pancake mix, and powdered milk, and beans and rice for a year. Ever since then, my parents have kept a food storage, and they keep it updated and fresh.\n\nThose close to me, my friends and extended family, were not nearly as fortunate. My aunt moved in with us and paid what little rent she could to my family while she tried to find any sort of work. Do you know what tomato soup made out of school cafeteria ketchup packets taste like? My friends got to find out. Almost a year after the crisis' low, my dad had stabilized our income stream and to help out others, he was hiring my friends' dads for odd house work. One of them built a new closet in our guest room. Another one did some landscaping in our backyard. I will forever be so proud of my parents, because in a time of need, even when I have no doubt money was still tight, they had the mindfulness and compassion to help out those who absolutely needed it.\n\nTo Melvin Capital: you stand for everything that I hated during that time. You're a firm who makes money off of exploiting a company and manipulating markets and media to your advantage. Your continued existence is a sharp reminder that the ones in charge of so much hardship during the '08 crisis were not punished. And your blatant disregard for the law, made obvious months ago through your (for the Melvin lawyers out there: alleged) illegal naked short selling and more recently your obscene market manipulation after hours shows that you haven't learned a single thing since '08. And why would you? Your ilk were bailed out and rewarded for terrible and illegal financial decisions that negatively changed the lives of millions. I bought shares a few days ago. I dumped my savings into GME, paid my rent for this month with my credit card, and dumped my rent money into more GME (which for the people here at WSB, I would not recommend). And I'm holding. This is personal for me, and millions of others. You can drop the price of GME after hours $120, I'm not going anywhere. You can pay for thousands of reddit bots, I'm holding. You can get every mainstream media outlet to demonize us, I don't care. I'm making this as painful as I can for you.\n\nTo CNBC: you must realize your short term gains through promoting institutions' agenda is just that - short term. Your staple audience will soon become too old to care, and the millions of us, not just at WSB but every person affected by the '08 crash that's now paying attention to GME, are going to remember how you stuck up for the firms that ruined so many of us, and tried to tear down the little guys. I know for sure I'll remember this. In response, here is a [list of CNBC sponsors and partners](https://www.cnbcevents.com/sponsors/). They include, but are not limited to, **IBM**, **Cisco**, **TMobile**, **JPMorgan**, **Oracle**, and **ZipRecruiter**. Their parent company is [NBCUniversal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBCUniversal), owned by **Comcast** and **GE**.\n\nTo the boomers, and/or people close to that age, just now paying attention to these \"millennial blog posts\": you realize that, even if you weren't adversely effected by the '08 crash, your children and perhaps grandchildren most likely were? *We're not enemies, we're on the same side*. Stop listening to the media that's making us out to be market destroyers, and start rooting for us, because we have a once in a lifetime opportunity to punish the sort of people who caused so much pain and stress a decade ago, and we're taking that opportunity. Your children, your grandchildren, might have suffered as I described because of the institutions that we're fighting against. You really want to choose them, over your own family and friends? We're not asking you to risk your 401k or retirement fund on a single GME bet. We're just asking you to be understanding, supportive, and to not support the people that caused so much suffering a decade ago.\n\nTo WSB: you all are amazing. I imagine that I'm not the only one that this is personal for. I've read myself so many posts on what you guys went through during the '08 crash. Whether you're here for the gains, to stick it to the man as I am, or just to be part of a potentially market changing movement - thank you. Each and every one of you are the reason that we have this chance. I've never felt this optimistic about the future before. This is life changing amounts of money for so many of you, and to be part of a rare instance of a wealth distribution from the rich to the poor is just incredible. I love you all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNote: I can't seem to get a hold of mods and they keep fucking removing the post. I have no idea how to get this to stick and its important to me that the people I'm addressing read it.",

And a look at recent news.\n\nAs a long on Nokia, I have been lurking this sub and I see a lot of the same misconceptions about Nokia and well, I believe its time for me to bring some clarity to the reality that is $NOK\n\n**Myth #1 Nokia is a phone company.**\n\nThis is wrong, Nokia is not a phone company. They sold their phone business to Microsoft back in 2013 for over 7 billion dollars, later it was sold by Microsoft to HMD for 350 million dollars in 2016, who currently makes the phones. Nokia just gets royalties for the use of their name.\n\n[https://www.geekwire.com/2019/microsoft-nokia-reunite-new-alliance-5-years-failed-7b-smartphone-megadeal/](https://www.geekwire.com/2019/microsoft-nokia-reunite-new-alliance-5-years-failed-7b-smartphone-megadeal/)\n\n**Myth #2 Nokia has been under the same failed management for 25 years.**\n\nCorrection, Nokia hired on a new CEO Pekka Lundmark in August of 2020 and took full leadership in September. He previously worked for Nokia between 1990 and 2000, when he helped oversee the company\u2019s emergence as the world\u2019s biggest mobile phone manufacturer and a significant player in mobile infrastructure. \n\nCareer history:\n\nPresident and CEO, Fortum, 2015\u20132020\n\nPresident and CEO, Konecranes, 2005\u20132015\n\nGroup Executive Vice President, Konecranes, 2004\u20132005\n\nPresident and CEO, Hackman, 2002\u20132004\n\nManaging Partner, Startupfactory, 2000\u20132002\n\nSenior Vice President, Marketing, Nokia Internet Communications, 1998\u20132000\n\nVice President, Strategy &amp; Business Development, Nokia Telecommunications, 1996\u20131998\n\nVice President, Access Systems Business Unit, Nokia Telecommunications, 1994\u20131996\n\nManaging Director, Nokia Telecommunications Denmark, 1992\u20131994\n\nAccount Manager, Nokia Cellular Systems, 1990\u20131992\n\n[https://www.nokia.com/about-us/company/leadership-and-governance/group-leadership-team/pekka-lundmark/](https://www.nokia.com/about-us/company/leadership-and-governance/group-leadership-team/pekka-lundmark/)\n\n# Nokia global head to go as executive exodus continues\n\nhttps://www.mobileworldlive.com/featured-content/home-banner/nokia-global-head-to-go-as-executive-exodus-continues\n\n**Myth #3 Nokia is not involved with Autonomous vehicles and cant be compared to Blackberry**\n\nNokia and SoftBank claim 5G first for connected cars\n\nFinnish comms giant and Japanese operator reveal trials that they say successfully demonstrate that 5G technology can be safely and efficiently utilised for connected cars\n\n[https://www.computerweekly.com/news/252478438/Nokia-and-SoftBank-claim-5G-first-for-connected-cars](https://www.computerweekly.com/news/252478438/Nokia-and-SoftBank-claim-5G-first-for-connected-cars)\n\n5G ecosystem paves the way to automated vehicles\n\n[https://www.nokia.com/blog/5g-ecosystem-paves-way-automated-vehicles/](https://www.nokia.com/blog/5g-ecosystem-paves-way-automated-vehicles/)\n\nNokia Future X for industries solutions can help you digitally transform your vehicle manufacturing operation and bring new levels of safety, engagement and \u201cconnectedness\u201d to your customers, partners, suppliers and to your own workforce.\n\n[https://www.nokia.com/networks/industries/automotive/](https://www.nokia.com/networks/industries/automotive/)\n\n**Myth #4 Nokia is losing market share due to competition**\n\nWhile yes, there is strong competition in the 5G market, Huawei the global leader, is facing bans across the United States and Europe, ZTE who makes up a small fraction of the market share is also seeing geopolitical pressure. Current estimates of market share show the following Huawei 28.5% Ericsson 26.5% Nokia 22% Samsung 8.5% ZTE 5% and others 9.5%.\n\nHere is an updated list on each countries stance on Huawei and ZTE.

I\u2019ve added a link for a recent BBC article on Tesla\u2019s stock performance that should hopefully provide some motivation. \n\n\n1) Understand stocks work, (dividends, stock splits, realised/unrealised gain or loss) \n2) Find a platform that works well for you (simplicity, commission free). Some investment accounts are also tax free. \n3) Invest in shares. Stay away from any form of derivative products (ie. options, CFDs). \n4) Pick a stock by seeing what people are talking about and do research into the company, to a level where you would be comfortable delivering a presentation about it. \n5) Ask yourself if you believe in the company\u2019s vision (is it working towards future innovation, is it creating value that is being recognised?) - Maybe avoid buying Coca Cola or IBM stocks as these are not growth stocks. You want the capital to work to its best efficiency. \n6) Be committed - you must have the temperament to withstand volatility along the way. It\u2019s a rollercoaster ride. \n7) Buy up any dips (price declines). Only invest the money you\u2019re willing to tie up and not use in the next 5+ years. \n8) \u201cDiversification is a protection from ignorance\u201d - Warren Buffet. \n\nPosition: 100% in Palantir. \n\n[Teslanaires](https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/www.bbc.com/news/amp/business-55391571)",

        "selftext": "Alright listen up folks. I know this industry isn\u2019t sexy like EV or FinTech, but this space is important. Let me tell you why Clover Health ($CLOV) is going to see a great returns within the coming months!\n\n$CLOV merged with $IPOC (Chamath\u2019s SPA). Chamath\u2019s track record speaks for itself. His investments including SPCE, OPEN, and his other current PIPE investment have all done really well and are quality companies. Since the merger with Clover Health, Chamath upped his stake in the Clover Health and now owns roughly 30%. Not long after, a 13D was filed by Clover\u2019s CEO to up his stake in the company and now owns around 37%. The CEO has a proven track record of building successful healthcare businesses on the services side that he\u2019s sold for billions. Another notable mention is Bill and Hillary Clinton\u2019s daughter, Chelsea. She is on the Board of Directors for Clover and has been a believer in the company for a while now. She recently opted to exercise her shares rather than sell after merging because she\u2019s in it for the long haul.  if there\u2019s one thing we know, it\u2019s that the Clinton family gets their bag. Numerous other executives at Clover and Social Capital have done the same  including Ian Osborne. There\u2019s 70+ institutions holding the stock but other notable \u201csmart money\u201d includes backing from Google and Sequoia Capital. If you don\u2019t know what Sequoia capital is, I encourage you to look up previous companies they\u2019ve invested in. Follow the smart money \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc8e\n\n\nLet\u2019s talk some numbers. Medicare Advantage spending was $270 billion in 2019, and is expected to expand to $590 billion by 2025. As of now $CLOV is only in 34 counties. That doesn\u2019t sound that impressive at first glance. However, just being in 34 counties generated them 507M in revenue. They already said this year they\u2019ll be in 108 counties which will take their revenue to just shy of a billion. There\u2019s 3,000 counties in the US. Being in 108 counties is just 0.03% penetration of the total addressable market.... They\u2019ve already said they want to be in every corner of the country and the cash generated from this IPO will help them expand to get there. Their market share is growing exponentially (9x faster than its closest competitors) and revenues are growing 50%+. Speaking of total addressable market, 10,000 boomers turn 65 a day. That\u2019s an extremely concrete and measurable customer base that can only expand. We now have president Biden who has sworn to revamp Medicare and possibly lower age of Medicare eligibility from 65 to 60. If that happens, that\u2019s fucking millions of extra potential customers a month. \n\nLet\u2019s talk a little more about what Clover does. They\u2019ve proven to build Medicare Advantage plans that balance quality and cost. They\u2019re fixated on how they can deliver the lowest cost possible. Any business obsessed with delivering value and cost savings to consumers is always successful. Always. To me this is reinforced through their very impressive partnerships with retail giants in the counties they operate in including: Walmart, CVS, Walgreens, Kroger, Costco. But wait, that\u2019s not all they do. Here\u2019s what makes $CLOV special. Clover is a double edged sword. In addition to their Medicare business, the other side of the business (that can be leveraged in conjunction to their Medicare plans) is called Clover Assistant. This is their proprietary AI focused and data driven software. It allows doctors to leverage historical patient data in order to create more effective treatment plans. This results in lowered costs, fewer visits, and better outcomes for everyone involved. Think of this as Einstein for Salesforce CRM or Watson for IBM. Clover Assistant can be the Einstein for the EHRS (electronic health record systems). This industry is prime for disruption. There are very few tech advancements in the healthcare world from an operations perspective. Keep in mind this side of the business is still in its infancy with only 2000 physicians on it. They plan to ramp exponentially with an upcoming direct contracting model in addition to using proceeds from IPO for further market penetration. \n\nFuture catalysts include:\n\n-$20 price target from Bank of America (doesn\u2019t seem to be on web yet but pic from Bloomberg Terminal shared on Twitter) \n\n-they were invited to speak at the prestigious JPM Health Conference on 1/12.

That\u2019s not too much left for retail to buy especially once there\u2019s more eyeballs on this stock via PTs and PR. That\u2019s getting close to low float levels.

        "selftext": "$CCIV had a volume of 108 million shares yesterday that\u2019s over DOUBLE what the S and P 500 index had!\n\nVideo version with visuals and sources\u2014&gt; https://youtu.be/B-8C2kXkoCw\n\nI would highly recommend the above video, as it is engaging and has great visuals for all the info.\n\n\nAnyways,\nBig news hit the markets yesterday when Bloomberg released this article [Here ](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-11/lucid-motors-said-to-be-in-talks-to-list-via-michael-klein-spac)explaining how Lucid Motors was in talks with Michael Klein\u2019s SPAC. BUT most of you reading this have probably heard this news already, so instead of regurgitating the same hype that everyone else does, I\u2019m going to give you a bunch of DD about CCIV. \n\nInvestor place and Bloomberg have both said if Lucid actually goes public through CCIV that the valuation would become $15 million. BUT IF THERES ANYTHING WE\u2019VE learned about ELECTRIC HYPE VEHICLE VALUATIONS it\u2019s they\u2019re completely meaningless and you may as well double or even triple it. Cough Tesla and NIO. I need to repeat this We had a volume of 102 million shares yesterday! If that doesn\u2019t tell you that this will be HUGE once the DA is finalized, then I don\u2019t know what else will.\n\nOh wait I have something or someone else that will tell you this will be big. One Name: Andrew Liveris \n\nAndrew Liveris serves on the Board of Directors of Saudi Aramco, IBM and Novonix. PLUS is a board member for Lucid and Churchill, which is the SPAC, CCIV. Another highlighting part here is their ties with Saudi oil. In September 18th 2017, Lucid motors was in talks with the public investment fund of Saudi Arabia valued at over $1billion. Now, The Saudi\u2019s own 50% of Lucid Motors.  Starting to see the ties here?? \n\nSo, let\u2019s assume Lucid Motors is going public through CCIV. What does this mean for us?\n\nWell, their car Lucid Air is the fastest charging, longest range and best performance luxury EV in market. Deliveries start Quarter 2 2021 as they completed their factory in AZ and CEO Peter Rawlinson was previously responsible for developing the Model S with Tesla. So, they definitely know what they\u2019re doing. \n\nAnother key takeaway: Lucid Motors is currently hiring and has 560 jobs available, this can actually be a good catalyst too because this means there\u2019s tons of room for growth. We saw this previously in my videos for ticker APPS. The company has since gone 800% in its stock price and is sitting above $50 a share.\n\nPLUS, did I mention they have a partnership with Amazon?? In this CNBC article: [Here](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cnbc.com/amp/2020/09/10/ceo-of-tesla-rival-lucid-motors-on-partnership-with-amazon-for-alexa.html) we can see that Lucid Motors is in a partnership with Amazon for Alexa compatibility in their car. This is really big and not many people are talking about this. Amazon in itself is an amazing asset to have. We\u2019ve seen how big this can be with SPAC\u2019s like $NGA and $GIK \n\nIf this rumor is true, which I believe it is, then we\u2019re about to witness the biggest SPAC Attack ever. A company that could potentially compete with Tesla and NIO. If you like my info so far, please subscribe as these videos take me 6-8 hours to make for free.\n\nAnyways, not only is the news good, but every single forum, group and stock channel is talking about this SPAC. The hype and FOMO will continue to be unreal leading up to the DA. \n\ndisclaimer: I already have a position of Commons at $12.22 a share but will be watching how this plays out as it\u2019s super overbought, rightly fully so. Once the DA news hits, ideally within the next month, then the algos will take this to around 17-20 a share in my opinion (assuming it sits in the 13-15 range, which it probably won\u2019t)\n\nOne crucial aspect to note is that a bunch of institutional shares were purchased yesterday, making this SPAC a prime target for heavy manipulation in the future, as we\u2019ve seen with many other SPAC\u2019s before. DONT be surprised when it falls big time one day in the future after it becomes overextended. \n\nAnyways, I\u2019m holding these common shares for a long time if the rumor is in fact true, and I hope you enjoyed my DD today and will consider holding as well. \n\nMore info and visuals are in my video as well, so feel free to check it out\u2014&gt; https://youtu.be/B-8C2kXkoCw",

When I first invested in Palantir it was under this public opinion that they're creating groundbreaking, innovative tech in the AI field. Pretty far from the truth. \n\nUnfortunately, there's nothing ground breaking or new about PLTR Gotham tech. It's a data aggregator. There's half a few other companies I'm aware of off the top of my head that do the same thing and have been around for over a decade. IBM datastage, Alteryx, and Tableu are the big ones that most people have heard of. It's just a platform that allows non technical people to do technical things with their data through the use of GUIs and form input. \n\nSorry to burst every ones bubble but the only thing that PLTR has going for it is government contracts. They are not first to market in the private sector at all. They've been beat by the greater part of a decade. Please let me know if there's features of the Gotham platform that I'm unaware of. Looking through their promotional pages I don't see anything outside of that.  \n\nThe company still has great potential but the expectation that this will moon because they're entering the private sector is high hoping.",

        "selftext": "This is my first DD so I hope it goes well.\n\nCC Neuberger Principal Holdings I (PCPL) has an agreement to merge with E2OPEN.\n\n**What is E2OPEN?**: E2OPEN is a cloud-based, artificial intelligence, on-demand SaaS platform company. E2OPEN is the largest cloud-based provider of networked supply chain applications. More than 70,000 partner companies and 200,000 users, many of the biggest companies in the world use the E2OPEN network today.\n\n**Who are E2OPEN's customers?**: Some of their customers include Google, Facebook, AMD, Nvidia, Intel, HP, IBM etc. [Complete list taken from the investor presentation.](https://i.imgur.com/FfcVX7o.png)\n\n**Who is leading the SPAC?**: The founder &amp; CEO of PLPC is Chinh Chu. A billionaire with 30+ years of investment experience, including 25 years at [Blackstone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Blackstone_Group). He has created 3 SPACs since 2016. The first SPAC, CF Corp, raised $1.2 billion and successfully merged with Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Life. The second SPAC, Collier Creek Holdings, raised $475 million and successfully merged with a company in the consumer sector. And now we have his most recent, third SPAC, PCPL. It has raised $414 million and will merge with E2OPEN. This man was also in charge of taking Dun &amp; Bradstreet private in a large $7.2 billion deal. Before joining Blackstone in 1990, this man also worked in the Mergers &amp; Acquisitions Deparment at Salomon Brothers. His experience is undeniable. \n\n**Backstory**: E2OPEN used to be a public company. Their stock price went as high as $28. They were bought by a private company and were taken off the market in 2015. Ever since they were taken private, E2OPEN was able to grow from $80M in revenue 5 years ago to $335M in 2020. They have acquired a handful of companies and continue to do so. E2OPEN's revenue is about four times what it was in 2015. The percent of revenue that is subscription-based, which is always a key metric for a SaaS company, was 80% in fiscal 2020 and is expected to grow in 2021. It also stands to benefit as companies automate their supply chains further in the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n**The potential negatives:** Their estimated revenue for next year is about +10%. There was an additional funding from instutions through a private investment in public equity (PIPE) of $175M which will be used to pay down existing debt. E2OPEN traded publicly before they were acquired by another company. Their stock price went as high as $28 but also went as low as $8. They were then acquired by Insight Venture Partners and have grown since. \n\n**The Merger**: SPAC shareholders will own 20% of the shares. The merger has a valuation of $2.57B. Upon closing of the transaction with E2OPEN, the ticker will change from 'PCPL' to 'ETWO'.\n\n**TL:DR:** A cloud-based SaaS platform company with customers from some of the biggest corporations in the world today, has a definitive agreement to merge with 'PCPL'. PCPL is run by a billionaire with an unbelievable resume that has already had two previous successful SPAC mergers and this is his third SPAC. The company's revenue has grown massively and their revenue today is about four times higher than it was in 2015. The percent of their revenue that is subscription-based is 80% and is expected to grow in the future. \n\n**Disclaimer:** I own 420 shares of PCPL. Invest at your own risk. As of this writing the price of PCPL is **$10,84.**",

So I ran a TOS screen: stocks in the Russell 1000 that are at least 10% below their 270 day, 260 day, and 250 day past values (3 filters to deal with noise). 226 companies fit the screen.

Kinda surprised to see Boston Scientific on the list! Some of these stocks will certainly rebound in a big way in the 2H of 2021. Anyone have a favorite from the list?\n\nThe defense stocks here actually look fairly attractive as a group, considering that their main income is from US and allied defense spending that is not going away. But, I'm sure their next quarterly earnings will be nothing to write home about. Longer term, there's a real good chance of increased world conflict in the aftermath of the pandemic (in my opinion) and their aviation-adjacent revenues will recover. The ETF plays for this sector are PPA (would be my choice due to $HON being in it) or ITA. Anyone think a contrarian defense sector play has value?",

        "selftext": "Obviously,  the SP500 inclusion was a big deal for Tesla. Therefore, DJIA inclusion  could be an equivalent or bigger deal. Right now I see three  underperforming companies in the DJIA that are likely to be removed due  to them no longer representing the American economy in the future. This  includes Intel, IBM, and Boeing.\n\n* Intel is about to outsource to TSMC and become a foreign company\n* IBM is stuck in the last century and still widely hated for ruining chess for everyone\n* Boeing is about to turn into a defense only company because they killed all their consumers\n\nThere  seems to be little information on how and when a company is added to  the Dow Jones Industrial Average list of 30 companies. I tried searching  [investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dow-30.asp) and [spglobal](https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/indices/equity/dow-jones-industrial-average/#overview), but found no indication on when they decide to add new companies to the list.\n\nThis  lack of information is very suspicious to me and indicates Tesla may be  added to the DJIA very soon.

        "selftext": "* The market was a bit mixed today compare to yesterday's - but tech continued its skyrocket after yesterday's bullish inauguration run. AAPL extended their rally to close the day up 3.67% to $136.87, nearing ATH once again thanks to some more positive comments from analysts this morning. Morgan Stanley up their AAPL PT from $144 to $152, while Bernstein notes Apple's strong iPhone 12 demand cycle. In other big tech moves, FB closed up 2% to $272 as Evercore ups their PT from $320 to $355; AMZN trimmed their earlier morning gains but still closed the day up 1.34% to $3,300; finally, after running up 6% yesterday, GOOGL retreated from a morning high that almost touched ATH to close the day at 0.22%.\n\n* GME euphoria roars along unabated as WSB continues to go all-in on the gaming retailer. With intraday moves of over 13%, GME is as volatile as ever. Shares initially traded red in the morning but soon rally to as high as $42 when it became apparent Citron's video was postponed yet again (damn hAxOr!), but the stock soon went red once the video was uploaded. Suffice to say, Citron's video on YouTube immediately accumulated thousands of dislikes while not revealing anything material that the market wouldn't know about already - and shares recovered after an initial dive. Through the rest of the day, shares bounced from low $40s to the ~$42 sell wall, but eventually broke through during power hour and closed the day up 9.99% to $43 - a relatively strong bullish close considering GME hasn't closed above $40+ since last week's big pump. Support appears to be around $35-$37 and resistance is around $42-$43.\n\n* Morning numbers had jobless claims falling slightly by 26k to 900k for the week ending in Jan 16 with consensus being 910k. Housing Starts saw another strong month with a 5.8% increase to 1.67m in Dec. Finally, Philly Fed manufacturing index showed a strong uptick with numbers at 26.5 vs the consensus of 12, representing an 11-month high. \n\n* Airlines took a beating today with UAL leading the charge. With steeper than expected rev miss from their ER, UAL closed the day down -5.7% to $42.69. DAL closed down -2.28%, JBLU -2.37%, LUV -0.91%, and AAL closed down -2.10%.\n\n* In an unexpected move, INTC released their earnings early before the market closed and the stock traded with strength to close the day up 6.46% to $62.46. After digesting the numbers, shares retreated in AH to a current -2% to around $61. INTC reports Q4 EPS of $1.52 while consensus was $1.10 (hence the pump minutes before close) and they also projected Q1 EPS of $1.10 while consensus is at $0.93. The blue-chip semiconductor company is also upping its quarterly cash dividend by 5% (boomers love their dividend). The sector performed well today with AMD up 3% and NVDA up 3.75%.\n\n* IBM took a heavy beating, with AH currently at -6.4% to $123 as the large IT company reports fell short of the street's expectation. While adjusted Q4 EPS was $2.07 beating the consensus of $1.79, revenue was $20.37 bil vs $20.67 expected. Especially troubling was IBM's cloud segment, producing 6.84 bil instead of the consensus of 7.18 bil.\n\n* In WSB meme stock land BB traded red for most of the day but edged out a flat close to 0.47% to $12.85 (though it is retreating again in AH as of writing at -1.87%). ICLN closed up 4.41% to $32.66, filling the gap from last Friday's sell-off. Meanwhile, MT continues being pressured and closed the day at -1.49% to $23.\n\n* More notable ER movers: STX reported ER and while numbers were decent, shares are retreating AH to -4.83%. WDC follows suit AH to -2.45%. TAL, the Chinese after school online learning platform, rocketed up 15% for the day after reporting a strong quarter. Shares of other Chinese ADRs in the sector also performed strongly with GSX (a Citron short) up 11.62% and EDU up 6.95% for the day.\n\n* The DOW closed down 0.04% or -12 pts, Nasdaq up 0.55% or 73 pts, SPX up 0.03% or 1 pt (look at all those gains), and RUT close down -0.89% or -19 pts.\n\n* Notable numbers tomorrow: PMI at 9:45 AM ET with existing home sales soon to follow at 10 AM ET.\n\n(Yesterday's recap: none. got busy enjoying AMZN scalp gains.

        "selftext": "Good Friday evening to all of you here on r/wallstreetbets. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning January 18th, 2021.\n\n# **Biden heads into inauguration with a stock market tailwind - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/15/biden-heads-into-inauguration-with-a-stock-market-tailwind.html)**\n*****\n&gt; President-elect Joe Biden moves into the White House in the coming week with the biggest stock market tailwind since a presidential Election Day going back to at least 1952.\n*****\n&gt; According to CFRA data that begins that year, the near 13% gain since Nov. 3 would be the biggest increase in the S&amp;P 500 between the election and inauguration if the gains hold. President John F. Kennedy\u2019s 8.8% gain had been the best, followed by President Dwight Eisenhower, with 6.3%, and President Donald Trump, with 6.2%.\n*****\n&gt; Biden\u2019s promise of the $1.9 trillion relief package he announced Thursday is one of the reasons for the stock market\u2019s surge, and it will be a big focus of markets in the week ahead as investors handicap its chances of winning congressional approval.\n*****\n&gt; The Martin Luther King Jr. Day holiday starts off the week, and over the next four days several dozen S&amp;P 500 companies report earnings. Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, IBM, Intel and Procter &amp; Gamble are among the companies reporting.\n*****\n&gt; # Biden will have no honeymoon\nThe $1.9 trillion stimulus package is at the top of the agenda. But there is also significant focus on whether his administration will be better at controlling the pandemic and rolling out the vaccine, as he has promised.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThis is the number he came in at. Where do negotiations go from here?\u201d Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial, said of the $1.9 trillion package. She pointed to worries about a weakening economy, evident in December\u2019s retail sales data, down a surprising 0.7%, and weekly jobless claims, at the worst level since August.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cYou could argue this is Covid-related and therefore what is most important going forward is to see the logistics of the vaccines, inoculations gain orderly momentum. That is crucial for the market,\u201d she said.\n*****\n&gt; Krosby said the market is focused on the inauguration.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThey want to see it go smoothly, and that there\u2019s not any security lapse. The market absorbed the events of Jan. 6. The market looked ahead and figured out that at this point it was a one-off, and the market ended higher on Jan. 6,\u201d she said. \u201cBut always the market becomes much more defensive if what we considered an isolated event suddenly broadens out.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; There will be heightened security surrounding the inauguration after a mob of Trump supporters assaulted the Capitol while Congress was in the process of confirming the Electoral College vote. The House last week voted to impeach Trump for inciting the mob, and now there is concern about further incidents in Washington or at state capitals.\n*****\n&gt; # Stimulus and stocks\nMarkets are also watching carefully to see whether Biden can bridge some of the deep divide between Republicans and Democrats, who now hold a thin majority in Congress.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe\u2019re getting stimulus, and now the question is \u2018OK, you\u2019re supposed to be this great compromiser,\u2019\u201d said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA.\n*****\n&gt; Political strategists expect Biden will get his stimulus package but it will be trimmed down. Ed Mills, Washington policy analyst at Raymond James, said the package could be cut to about $1 trillion based on the size previously discussed by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and outgoing Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cDoes Congress want to have a bipartisan show of support after what has been an extraordinarily tenuous beginning of this year, to put it mildly?\u201d Mills said. He said the stock market should continue to do well because it is going to get stimulus spending.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cD.C. is going to be there with more spending, or consumers are going to be there with more spending if they have the ability to get to a post-vaccine world sooner,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; Stovall said that if history is a guide, the stock market should do well with Biden. The average gain of the S&amp;P 500 in the first 100 days for Democratic presidents is 3.5%, going back to 1952. For Republicans in the same period, it\u2019s been an average 0.5%.\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 has also gained an average 11.3% in the first year of a Democratic president, but just 5.7% for Republicans, going back to World War II.\n*****\n&gt; The stock market will continue to monitor the bond market, after the 10-year Treasury yield reached a high of 1.18% this past week, the highest since March. It since slid back to about 1.08% Friday after the weak data.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cOther things are going on in the back room. Bond yields have moved up of late, and it was a change. It gave you a sense of how fast rates can move,\u201d said James Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Leuthold Group. \u201cIt might be a preview of what you can expect this year.\u201d\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/NdqXqj3.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/78MvG08.jpg))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/HogqBPe.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/yPgkKR9.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/o6jTeP5.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/7BeafeZ.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/zGNf0yh.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/MhhsYpF.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/yhXOGJz.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/1E2Rohq.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/a74UeZP.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/a97ysV9.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/skrsU4T.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Martin Luther King Jr. Holiday Week Trading: Leans Bearish\n\n&gt; Although Martin Luther King Jr. Day was a holiday in many states and cities throughout the U.S. beginning in 1971, it did not become a federal holiday until 1986. Even then it was not observed by the NYSE until 1998. In the 23 years since, the market\u2019s performance during this four-trading-day week has been somewhat lackluster with average weekly performance negative for DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ, Russell 1000 and Russell 2000. Average losses range from 0.81% by DJIA to 0.16% by NASDAQ. Of the five indexes, not one has a record better than 50/50. However, since 2012 performance has shown signs of improving. DJIA, NASDAQ and Russell 2000 have risen in six of the last nine years. S&amp;P 500 and Russell 1000 have climbed in five of the last eight.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/67df4ce1594bee9748fb885a5316ff07/b5f21cb74511d020-c9/s500x750/218ed920ea1a67d95ff97fd05a5b9bbdf2454805.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Seasonal Soft Patch Ahead Starting Next Week\n\n&gt; With nine trading sessions of the New Year complete, January and 2021 are off to a solid start. DJIA is up 1.26% as of today\u2019s close, S&amp;P 500 stands at 1.05%, NASDAQ 1.74% and small caps, measured by the Russell 2000 are up a whopping 9.14%. These gains all point to and confirm the return of seasonality that we have recently noted.\n\n&gt; Last September was weak as it has historically been, then October exhibited it historical tendency toward volatility while November and December were both positive, in line with typical seasonal patterns. A positive Santa Claus Rally and First Five Days are also encouraging indications that seasonal forces are once again tracking. We expect seasonality will continue to present itself going forward as extraordinary efforts are made to quell the pandemic and return to a pre-Covid, open-for-business, way of life.\n\n&gt; Due to the reemergence of seasonality, we would not be surprised to see some market weakness in the second half of January next week that could persist throughout the rest of January and possible spill over into February. In the following seasonal pattern chart of January, the last 21 years of data for DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ, Russell 1000 and 2000 have been plotted with January 2021 through today\u2019s close plotted on the right vertical axis.\n\n&gt; Over the last 21 years, it has been NASDAQ leading at the halfway point, this year it is Russell 2000. Other than that, the major indexes have been tracking their historical patterns fairly well. There was strength early on, followed by sideways action. Should the current trend follow historical patterns then weakness after the eleventh trading day (January 18) is possible.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/c921e48e1e14dd8a61d2ad5cc18d7f94/f775f74bce597bb1-b6/s500x750/409599af0a5ca5a6fbb2ba71a5b1ead87d5852f8.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 5 Charts on the Democratic Blue Wave\n\n&gt; One of the top questions we\u2019ve received recently has been what a blue wave may mean for investments. After the Democrats won the two Senate runoff elections in Georgia, they will now control the White House and both chambers of Congress. Our January 11 Market Policy Projections for 2021 gave some of the immediate and longer-term policy impacts of the Democratic \u201cblue wave,\u201d and here we surf the blue wave with some interesting charts.\n\n&gt; First off, blue waves have not been bearish for stocks, with the S&amp;P 500 Index higher 6 of the past 7 times and up a respectable 9.1% on average since 1950.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Blog-1.15.21-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; We shared this chart in 2020, and it shows that historically, stocks do better if an incumbent president wins versus a new president in office. This makes sense, as a new president will bring in new policies and likely question marks\u2014while you know what you will get with a re-elected president. Remember, markets hate uncertainty and surprises.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Econ-blog-1.15.21-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; \u201cMake it all nine new Democratic presidents since 1900 to bring with them both the House and the Senate. In fact, stocks do quite well that first year under such circumstances, up nearly 12% on average,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cMaybe investors shouldn\u2019t fear a blue wave after all.\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, when a new Democratic president has brought with them the House and Senate, stocks gained that first year of their new presidency 6 of 8 times. What stands out to us for 2021, though, is the House majority is only 11\u2014the smallest for a new Democratic president since 1900.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/blog-1.15.21-3.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Looking at all of the times the Democrats controlled the House (since the 35th Congress when it was Democrats and Republicans), the 11-seat majority is the lowest since 9 seats in 1879. Yes, the Democrats are in power, but this small majority will make it very tough for any of the more extreme policies to pass.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Econ-blog-1.15.21-4.png?ssl=1)**\n\n&gt; Lastly, the Senate is split a perfect 50/50, which is again extremely rare. In the chart below we share the seat difference between the two parties. \u201cA 50/50 Senate coupled with only an 11-seat majority in the House, and it is safe to say we have about as close to a perfectly divided government as we\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d said Detrick.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Econ-blog-1.15.21-5.png?ssl=1)**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Rest of the World Catching Up\n\n&gt; Over the past year, US equities\u2014proxied by the S&amp;P 500 (SPY)\u2014have consistently outperformed global equities more broadly. As shown below, over the past year the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) has risen just over 16%. That compares to 11.26% for the rest of the world as proxied by the Vanguard FTSE All-World ex US ETF (VEU). Breaking that down a bit further by developed and emerging markets, US equities have outpaced both emerging and other developed markets. While emerging markets (SPEM) are right on the heels of the US with just under a 14.78% gain, developed markets (SPDW) have lagged with just a 10.56% gain. So far in 2021, though, the rest of the world has been outperforming the US. Whereas SPY has risen around 1% YTD, VEU is up almost 3 times that. Emerging markets in particular have shown the greatest degree of strength currently having risen 3.87%. Meanwhile, SPDW has gained less (2.7%), though, it is still outperforming the US.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/01/011221-ETFs.png))**\n\n&gt; In the charts below, we show the ratio of SPY to these other ETFs. A rising line would indicate that the US is outperforming these other measures of global equities while a downward trending line indicates underperformance of SPY. As shown, the longer-term trend has pretty consistently been US outperformance over the past decade but that has faltered at the tail end of 2020 and into 2021. In the case of emerging markets, the line has been on the decline throughout the second half of 2020 as the ratio has hit its lowest level in a year in the past week. The S&amp;P 500's underperformance relative to other developed markets (SPDW) has been more recent as that line peaked in early September but the trend remains the same over the past few months with SPY weaker than global equities more broadly. That is further exemplified by the recent downtrend of SPY versus the All World ex US ETF (VEU).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/01/011221-RS2.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Small Business Owners Didn't Like the Election Results\n\n&gt; Today's release of the December Small Business Optimism Index from the NFIB saw a large drop as the index dropped from 101.4 to 95.9. After a sharp drop in the wake of the COVID outbreak, the index bounced back nicely but now looks like it's really rolling over.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/01/011221-NFIB-Small-Business-Chart.png))**\n\n&gt; Not only was this month's headline index weak, but it caught economists completely off guard. While the index fell to 95.9, economists were expecting a drop to 100.2. That 4.3 spread between the actual and expected reading was the biggest miss relative to expectations in more than five years (July 2015) and was the third weakest reading relative to expectations since the December 2012 report.\n\n&gt; Given the big drop in the headline index and the fact that it was so weak relative to expectations, should we be concerned about a double-dip? As an investor, we should always be worried about what could go wrong, but in the case of this report, you can probably wait for further confirmation from other data. The reason for the skepticism is that you could argue that politics plays a role in this report. To illustrate this, we would note that going back to 2010 (as far back as we have data) and right up through Election Day 2016, the NFIB only topped expectations 42% of the time. Following Trump's election in 2016, though, this index surged and has since topped expectations 63% of the time. Since Election Day 2020, though, the headline index has now missed expectations three times.\n\n&gt; From a longer-term perspective, dating back to 1974, the average reading of the NFIB Small Business Index during Republican administrations has been 100.1 while the average level under Democratic Presidents has been 96.2. Now, that would make sense if the economy was also in a recession more often in those periods, but over that same span, even though the percentages are low for both political parties (&lt;20%), the economy has actually been in a recession a higher percentage of the time during Republican administrations than it has in Democratic administrations.\n\n&gt; The lesson to take from all this is that even if it's often hard to separate when it comes to business or investing (or a lot of other aspects of our lives for that matter), it's usually best to leave politics outside.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/01/011221-NFIB-Small-Business-Survey.png))**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/yhXOGJz.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/DAPsqr2.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MOST ANTICIPATED EARNINGS RELEASES FOR FINANCIAL COMPANIES ONLY FOR THE NEXT 4 WEEKS!](https://i.imgur.com/aC5hzkZ.jpg))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MOST ANTICIPATED EARNINGS RELEASES FOR NASDAQ 100 COMPANIES ONLY FOR THE NEXT 4 WEEKS!](https://i.imgur.com/zIQniHK.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 1.18.21 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.

While not much really changed on the ground for Snowflake, which is on track to more than double revenues this fiscal year, there are a couple of factors that have likely driven the sell-off. Firstly, Snowflake stock remains very richly valued trading at over 130x consensus FY\u201921 Revenues and is up by about 130% from its IPO price. Considering these big gains, investors are likely booking some profits. Secondly, in mid-December Snowflake saw its first lockup release post its IPO, allowing employees to sell 25% of their vested options. While this only had a limited impact, investors are likely concerned that the full lock-up expiration, which happens this March, will put a lot more pressure on the stock. Snowflake\u2019s float, or the shares available to investors for trading, stands at just about 18% of its total shares outstanding currently. Thirdly, with Covid-19 vaccines being rolled out globally, investors could be rethinking their allocation to cloud computing stocks which were a hot theme through the pandemic, while shifting to more value bets. This could also be a factor hurting Snowflake stock. \n\n\\----\n\nwhat do people think, will there be a large sell off tomorrow? Is it currently overvalued? Will it sell off when it unlocks in March? Does it have a fighting chance against big tech? Is their low float (10% of outstanding shares) causing the high valuation and run up?",

        "selftext": "Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/smallstreetbets. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning January 18th, 2021.\n\n# **Biden heads into inauguration with a stock market tailwind - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/15/biden-heads-into-inauguration-with-a-stock-market-tailwind.html)**\n*****\n&gt; President-elect Joe Biden moves into the White House in the coming week with the biggest stock market tailwind since a presidential Election Day going back to at least 1952.\n*****\n&gt; According to CFRA data that begins that year, the near 13% gain since Nov. 3 would be the biggest increase in the S&amp;P 500 between the election and inauguration if the gains hold. President John F. Kennedy\u2019s 8.8% gain had been the best, followed by President Dwight Eisenhower, with 6.3%, and President Donald Trump, with 6.2%.\n*****\n&gt; Biden\u2019s promise of the $1.9 trillion relief package he announced Thursday is one of the reasons for the stock market\u2019s surge, and it will be a big focus of markets in the week ahead as investors handicap its chances of winning congressional approval.\n*****\n&gt; The Martin Luther King Jr. Day holiday starts off the week, and over the next four days several dozen S&amp;P 500 companies report earnings. Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, IBM, Intel and Procter &amp; Gamble are among the companies reporting.\n*****\n&gt; # Biden will have no honeymoon\nThe $1.9 trillion stimulus package is at the top of the agenda. But there is also significant focus on whether his administration will be better at controlling the pandemic and rolling out the vaccine, as he has promised.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThis is the number he came in at. Where do negotiations go from here?\u201d Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial, said of the $1.9 trillion package. She pointed to worries about a weakening economy, evident in December\u2019s retail sales data, down a surprising 0.7%, and weekly jobless claims, at the worst level since August.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cYou could argue this is Covid-related and therefore what is most important going forward is to see the logistics of the vaccines, inoculations gain orderly momentum. That is crucial for the market,\u201d she said.\n*****\n&gt; Krosby said the market is focused on the inauguration.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThey want to see it go smoothly, and that there\u2019s not any security lapse. The market absorbed the events of Jan. 6. The market looked ahead and figured out that at this point it was a one-off, and the market ended higher on Jan. 6,\u201d she said. \u201cBut always the market becomes much more defensive if what we considered an isolated event suddenly broadens out.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; There will be heightened security surrounding the inauguration after a mob of Trump supporters assaulted the Capitol while Congress was in the process of confirming the Electoral College vote. The House last week voted to impeach Trump for inciting the mob, and now there is concern about further incidents in Washington or at state capitals.\n*****\n&gt; # Stimulus and stocks\nMarkets are also watching carefully to see whether Biden can bridge some of the deep divide between Republicans and Democrats, who now hold a thin majority in Congress.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe\u2019re getting stimulus, and now the question is \u2018OK, you\u2019re supposed to be this great compromiser,\u2019\u201d said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA.\n*****\n&gt; Political strategists expect Biden will get his stimulus package but it will be trimmed down. Ed Mills, Washington policy analyst at Raymond James, said the package could be cut to about $1 trillion based on the size previously discussed by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and outgoing Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cDoes Congress want to have a bipartisan show of support after what has been an extraordinarily tenuous beginning of this year, to put it mildly?\u201d Mills said. He said the stock market should continue to do well because it is going to get stimulus spending.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cD.C. is going to be there with more spending, or consumers are going to be there with more spending if they have the ability to get to a post-vaccine world sooner,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; Stovall said that if history is a guide, the stock market should do well with Biden. The average gain of the S&amp;P 500 in the first 100 days for Democratic presidents is 3.5%, going back to 1952. For Republicans in the same period, it\u2019s been an average 0.5%.\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 has also gained an average 11.3% in the first year of a Democratic president, but just 5.7% for Republicans, going back to World War II.\n*****\n&gt; The stock market will continue to monitor the bond market, after the 10-year Treasury yield reached a high of 1.18% this past week, the highest since March. It since slid back to about 1.08% Friday after the weak data.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cOther things are going on in the back room. Bond yields have moved up of late, and it was a change. It gave you a sense of how fast rates can move,\u201d said James Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Leuthold Group. \u201cIt might be a preview of what you can expect this year.\u201d\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/NdqXqj3.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/78MvG08.jpg))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/HogqBPe.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/yPgkKR9.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/o6jTeP5.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/7BeafeZ.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/zGNf0yh.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/MhhsYpF.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/yhXOGJz.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/1E2Rohq.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/a74UeZP.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/a97ysV9.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/skrsU4T.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Martin Luther King Jr. Holiday Week Trading: Leans Bearish\n\n&gt; Although Martin Luther King Jr. Day was a holiday in many states and cities throughout the U.S. beginning in 1971, it did not become a federal holiday until 1986. Even then it was not observed by the NYSE until 1998. In the 23 years since, the market\u2019s performance during this four-trading-day week has been somewhat lackluster with average weekly performance negative for DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ, Russell 1000 and Russell 2000. Average losses range from 0.81% by DJIA to 0.16% by NASDAQ. Of the five indexes, not one has a record better than 50/50. However, since 2012 performance has shown signs of improving. DJIA, NASDAQ and Russell 2000 have risen in six of the last nine years. S&amp;P 500 and Russell 1000 have climbed in five of the last eight.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/67df4ce1594bee9748fb885a5316ff07/b5f21cb74511d020-c9/s500x750/218ed920ea1a67d95ff97fd05a5b9bbdf2454805.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Seasonal Soft Patch Ahead Starting Next Week\n\n&gt; With nine trading sessions of the New Year complete, January and 2021 are off to a solid start. DJIA is up 1.26% as of today\u2019s close, S&amp;P 500 stands at 1.05%, NASDAQ 1.74% and small caps, measured by the Russell 2000 are up a whopping 9.14%. These gains all point to and confirm the return of seasonality that we have recently noted.\n\n&gt; Last September was weak as it has historically been, then October exhibited it historical tendency toward volatility while November and December were both positive, in line with typical seasonal patterns. A positive Santa Claus Rally and First Five Days are also encouraging indications that seasonal forces are once again tracking. We expect seasonality will continue to present itself going forward as extraordinary efforts are made to quell the pandemic and return to a pre-Covid, open-for-business, way of life.\n\n&gt; Due to the reemergence of seasonality, we would not be surprised to see some market weakness in the second half of January next week that could persist throughout the rest of January and possible spill over into February. In the following seasonal pattern chart of January, the last 21 years of data for DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ, Russell 1000 and 2000 have been plotted with January 2021 through today\u2019s close plotted on the right vertical axis.\n\n&gt; Over the last 21 years, it has been NASDAQ leading at the halfway point, this year it is Russell 2000. Other than that, the major indexes have been tracking their historical patterns fairly well. There was strength early on, followed by sideways action. Should the current trend follow historical patterns then weakness after the eleventh trading day (January 18) is possible.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/c921e48e1e14dd8a61d2ad5cc18d7f94/f775f74bce597bb1-b6/s500x750/409599af0a5ca5a6fbb2ba71a5b1ead87d5852f8.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 5 Charts on the Democratic Blue Wave\n\n&gt; One of the top questions we\u2019ve received recently has been what a blue wave may mean for investments. After the Democrats won the two Senate runoff elections in Georgia, they will now control the White House and both chambers of Congress. Our January 11 Market Policy Projections for 2021 gave some of the immediate and longer-term policy impacts of the Democratic \u201cblue wave,\u201d and here we surf the blue wave with some interesting charts.\n\n&gt; First off, blue waves have not been bearish for stocks, with the S&amp;P 500 Index higher 6 of the past 7 times and up a respectable 9.1% on average since 1950.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Blog-1.15.21-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; We shared this chart in 2020, and it shows that historically, stocks do better if an incumbent president wins versus a new president in office. This makes sense, as a new president will bring in new policies and likely question marks\u2014while you know what you will get with a re-elected president. Remember, markets hate uncertainty and surprises.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Econ-blog-1.15.21-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; \u201cMake it all nine new Democratic presidents since 1900 to bring with them both the House and the Senate. In fact, stocks do quite well that first year under such circumstances, up nearly 12% on average,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cMaybe investors shouldn\u2019t fear a blue wave after all.\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, when a new Democratic president has brought with them the House and Senate, stocks gained that first year of their new presidency 6 of 8 times. What stands out to us for 2021, though, is the House majority is only 11\u2014the smallest for a new Democratic president since 1900.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/blog-1.15.21-3.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Looking at all of the times the Democrats controlled the House (since the 35th Congress when it was Democrats and Republicans), the 11-seat majority is the lowest since 9 seats in 1879. Yes, the Democrats are in power, but this small majority will make it very tough for any of the more extreme policies to pass.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Econ-blog-1.15.21-4.png?ssl=1)**\n\n&gt; Lastly, the Senate is split a perfect 50/50, which is again extremely rare. In the chart below we share the seat difference between the two parties. \u201cA 50/50 Senate coupled with only an 11-seat majority in the House, and it is safe to say we have about as close to a perfectly divided government as we\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d said Detrick.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Econ-blog-1.15.21-5.png?ssl=1)**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Rest of the World Catching Up\n\n&gt; Over the past year, US equities\u2014proxied by the S&amp;P 500 (SPY)\u2014have consistently outperformed global equities more broadly. As shown below, over the past year the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) has risen just over 16%. That compares to 11.26% for the rest of the world as proxied by the Vanguard FTSE All-World ex US ETF (VEU). Breaking that down a bit further by developed and emerging markets, US equities have outpaced both emerging and other developed markets. While emerging markets (SPEM) are right on the heels of the US with just under a 14.78% gain, developed markets (SPDW) have lagged with just a 10.56% gain. So far in 2021, though, the rest of the world has been outperforming the US. Whereas SPY has risen around 1% YTD, VEU is up almost 3 times that. Emerging markets in particular have shown the greatest degree of strength currently having risen 3.87%. Meanwhile, SPDW has gained less (2.7%), though, it is still outperforming the US.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/01/011221-ETFs.png))**\n\n&gt; In the charts below, we show the ratio of SPY to these other ETFs. A rising line would indicate that the US is outperforming these other measures of global equities while a downward trending line indicates underperformance of SPY. As shown, the longer-term trend has pretty consistently been US outperformance over the past decade but that has faltered at the tail end of 2020 and into 2021. In the case of emerging markets, the line has been on the decline throughout the second half of 2020 as the ratio has hit its lowest level in a year in the past week. The S&amp;P 500's underperformance relative to other developed markets (SPDW) has been more recent as that line peaked in early September but the trend remains the same over the past few months with SPY weaker than global equities more broadly. That is further exemplified by the recent downtrend of SPY versus the All World ex US ETF (VEU).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/01/011221-RS2.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Small Business Owners Didn't Like the Election Results\n\n&gt; Today's release of the December Small Business Optimism Index from the NFIB saw a large drop as the index dropped from 101.4 to 95.9. After a sharp drop in the wake of the COVID outbreak, the index bounced back nicely but now looks like it's really rolling over.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/01/011221-NFIB-Small-Business-Chart.png))**\n\n&gt; Not only was this month's headline index weak, but it caught economists completely off guard. While the index fell to 95.9, economists were expecting a drop to 100.2. That 4.3 spread between the actual and expected reading was the biggest miss relative to expectations in more than five years (July 2015) and was the third weakest reading relative to expectations since the December 2012 report.\n\n&gt; Given the big drop in the headline index and the fact that it was so weak relative to expectations, should we be concerned about a double-dip? As an investor, we should always be worried about what could go wrong, but in the case of this report, you can probably wait for further confirmation from other data. The reason for the skepticism is that you could argue that politics plays a role in this report. To illustrate this, we would note that going back to 2010 (as far back as we have data) and right up through Election Day 2016, the NFIB only topped expectations 42% of the time. Following Trump's election in 2016, though, this index surged and has since topped expectations 63% of the time. Since Election Day 2020, though, the headline index has now missed expectations three times.\n\n&gt; From a longer-term perspective, dating back to 1974, the average reading of the NFIB Small Business Index during Republican administrations has been 100.1 while the average level under Democratic Presidents has been 96.2. Now, that would make sense if the economy was also in a recession more often in those periods, but over that same span, even though the percentages are low for both political parties (&lt;20%), the economy has actually been in a recession a higher percentage of the time during Republican administrations than it has in Democratic administrations.\n\n&gt; The lesson to take from all this is that even if it's often hard to separate when it comes to business or investing (or a lot of other aspects of our lives for that matter), it's usually best to leave politics outside.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/01/011221-NFIB-Small-Business-Survey.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending January 15th, 2021** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmx1VYd-S_k))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 1.17.21**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED!)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$NFLX** \n&gt; * **$BAC** \n&gt; * **$FCEL** \n&gt; * **$GS** \n&gt; * **$PG** \n&gt; * **$INTC** \n&gt; * **$SCHW** \n&gt; * **$UNH** \n&gt; * **$MS** \n&gt; * **$HAL** \n&gt; * **$FAST** \n&gt; * **$CMA** \n&gt; * **$STT** \n&gt; * **$ASML** \n&gt; * **$UAL** \n&gt; * **$ONB** \n&gt; * **$IBM** \n&gt; * **$TFC** \n&gt; * **$JBHT** \n&gt; * **$MBWM** \n&gt; * **$CTXS** \n&gt; * **$USB** \n&gt; * **$UNP** \n&gt; * **$ALLY** \n&gt; * **$TRV** \n&gt; * **$BK** \n&gt; * **$AA** \n&gt; * **$LOGI** \n&gt; * **$SLB** \n&gt; * **$ZION** \n&gt; * **$CFG** \n&gt; * **$KEY** \n&gt; * **$FBC** \n&gt; * **$ISRG** \n&gt; * **$IBKR** \n&gt; * **$FHN** \n&gt; * **$BKR** \n&gt; * **$KMI** \n&gt; * **$NTRS** \n&gt; * **$DFS** \n&gt; * **$CSX** \n&gt; * **$EDU** \n&gt; * **$HOMB**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/yhXOGJz.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/DAPsqr2.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MOST ANTICIPATED EARNINGS RELEASES FOR FINANCIAL COMPANIES ONLY FOR THE NEXT 4 WEEKS!](https://i.imgur.com/aC5hzkZ.jpg))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MOST ANTICIPATED EARNINGS RELEASES FOR NASDAQ 100 COMPANIES ONLY FOR THE NEXT 4 WEEKS!](https://i.imgur.com/zIQniHK.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 1.18.21 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.

        "selftext": "Good Friday evening to all of you here on r/StockMarket. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning January 18th, 2021.\n\n# **Biden heads into inauguration with a stock market tailwind - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/15/biden-heads-into-inauguration-with-a-stock-market-tailwind.html)**\n*****\n&gt; President-elect Joe Biden moves into the White House in the coming week with the biggest stock market tailwind since a presidential Election Day going back to at least 1952.\n*****\n&gt; According to CFRA data that begins that year, the near 13% gain since Nov. 3 would be the biggest increase in the S&amp;P 500 between the election and inauguration if the gains hold. President John F. Kennedy\u2019s 8.8% gain had been the best, followed by President Dwight Eisenhower, with 6.3%, and President Donald Trump, with 6.2%.\n*****\n&gt; Biden\u2019s promise of the $1.9 trillion relief package he announced Thursday is one of the reasons for the stock market\u2019s surge, and it will be a big focus of markets in the week ahead as investors handicap its chances of winning congressional approval.\n*****\n&gt; The Martin Luther King Jr. Day holiday starts off the week, and over the next four days several dozen S&amp;P 500 companies report earnings. Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, IBM, Intel and Procter &amp; Gamble are among the companies reporting.\n*****\n&gt; # Biden will have no honeymoon\nThe $1.9 trillion stimulus package is at the top of the agenda. But there is also significant focus on whether his administration will be better at controlling the pandemic and rolling out the vaccine, as he has promised.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThis is the number he came in at. Where do negotiations go from here?\u201d Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial, said of the $1.9 trillion package. She pointed to worries about a weakening economy, evident in December\u2019s retail sales data, down a surprising 0.7%, and weekly jobless claims, at the worst level since August.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cYou could argue this is Covid-related and therefore what is most important going forward is to see the logistics of the vaccines, inoculations gain orderly momentum. That is crucial for the market,\u201d she said.\n*****\n&gt; Krosby said the market is focused on the inauguration.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThey want to see it go smoothly, and that there\u2019s not any security lapse. The market absorbed the events of Jan. 6. The market looked ahead and figured out that at this point it was a one-off, and the market ended higher on Jan. 6,\u201d she said. \u201cBut always the market becomes much more defensive if what we considered an isolated event suddenly broadens out.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; There will be heightened security surrounding the inauguration after a mob of Trump supporters assaulted the Capitol while Congress was in the process of confirming the Electoral College vote. The House last week voted to impeach Trump for inciting the mob, and now there is concern about further incidents in Washington or at state capitals.\n*****\n&gt; # Stimulus and stocks\nMarkets are also watching carefully to see whether Biden can bridge some of the deep divide between Republicans and Democrats, who now hold a thin majority in Congress.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe\u2019re getting stimulus, and now the question is \u2018OK, you\u2019re supposed to be this great compromiser,\u2019\u201d said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA.\n*****\n&gt; Political strategists expect Biden will get his stimulus package but it will be trimmed down. Ed Mills, Washington policy analyst at Raymond James, said the package could be cut to about $1 trillion based on the size previously discussed by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and outgoing Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cDoes Congress want to have a bipartisan show of support after what has been an extraordinarily tenuous beginning of this year, to put it mildly?\u201d Mills said. He said the stock market should continue to do well because it is going to get stimulus spending.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cD.C. is going to be there with more spending, or consumers are going to be there with more spending if they have the ability to get to a post-vaccine world sooner,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; Stovall said that if history is a guide, the stock market should do well with Biden. The average gain of the S&amp;P 500 in the first 100 days for Democratic presidents is 3.5%, going back to 1952. For Republicans in the same period, it\u2019s been an average 0.5%.\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 has also gained an average 11.3% in the first year of a Democratic president, but just 5.7% for Republicans, going back to World War II.\n*****\n&gt; The stock market will continue to monitor the bond market, after the 10-year Treasury yield reached a high of 1.18% this past week, the highest since March. It since slid back to about 1.08% Friday after the weak data.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cOther things are going on in the back room. Bond yields have moved up of late, and it was a change. It gave you a sense of how fast rates can move,\u201d said James Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Leuthold Group. \u201cIt might be a preview of what you can expect this year.\u201d\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/NdqXqj3.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/78MvG08.jpg))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/HogqBPe.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/yPgkKR9.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/o6jTeP5.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/7BeafeZ.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/zGNf0yh.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/MhhsYpF.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!]())**\n(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/1E2Rohq.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/a74UeZP.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/a97ysV9.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/skrsU4T.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Martin Luther King Jr. Holiday Week Trading: Leans Bearish\n\n&gt; Although Martin Luther King Jr. Day was a holiday in many states and cities throughout the U.S. beginning in 1971, it did not become a federal holiday until 1986. Even then it was not observed by the NYSE until 1998. In the 23 years since, the market\u2019s performance during this four-trading-day week has been somewhat lackluster with average weekly performance negative for DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ, Russell 1000 and Russell 2000. Average losses range from 0.81% by DJIA to 0.16% by NASDAQ. Of the five indexes, not one has a record better than 50/50. However, since 2012 performance has shown signs of improving. DJIA, NASDAQ and Russell 2000 have risen in six of the last nine years. S&amp;P 500 and Russell 1000 have climbed in five of the last eight.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/67df4ce1594bee9748fb885a5316ff07/b5f21cb74511d020-c9/s500x750/218ed920ea1a67d95ff97fd05a5b9bbdf2454805.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Seasonal Soft Patch Ahead Starting Next Week\n\n&gt; With nine trading sessions of the New Year complete, January and 2021 are off to a solid start. DJIA is up 1.26% as of today\u2019s close, S&amp;P 500 stands at 1.05%, NASDAQ 1.74% and small caps, measured by the Russell 2000 are up a whopping 9.14%. These gains all point to and confirm the return of seasonality that we have recently noted.\n\n&gt; Last September was weak as it has historically been, then October exhibited it historical tendency toward volatility while November and December were both positive, in line with typical seasonal patterns. A positive Santa Claus Rally and First Five Days are also encouraging indications that seasonal forces are once again tracking. We expect seasonality will continue to present itself going forward as extraordinary efforts are made to quell the pandemic and return to a pre-Covid, open-for-business, way of life.\n\n&gt; Due to the reemergence of seasonality, we would not be surprised to see some market weakness in the second half of January next week that could persist throughout the rest of January and possible spill over into February. In the following seasonal pattern chart of January, the last 21 years of data for DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ, Russell 1000 and 2000 have been plotted with January 2021 through today\u2019s close plotted on the right vertical axis.\n\n&gt; Over the last 21 years, it has been NASDAQ leading at the halfway point, this year it is Russell 2000. Other than that, the major indexes have been tracking their historical patterns fairly well. There was strength early on, followed by sideways action. Should the current trend follow historical patterns then weakness after the eleventh trading day (January 18) is possible.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/c921e48e1e14dd8a61d2ad5cc18d7f94/f775f74bce597bb1-b6/s500x750/409599af0a5ca5a6fbb2ba71a5b1ead87d5852f8.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 5 Charts on the Democratic Blue Wave\n\n&gt; One of the top questions we\u2019ve received recently has been what a blue wave may mean for investments. After the Democrats won the two Senate runoff elections in Georgia, they will now control the White House and both chambers of Congress. Our January 11 Market Policy Projections for 2021 gave some of the immediate and longer-term policy impacts of the Democratic \u201cblue wave,\u201d and here we surf the blue wave with some interesting charts.\n\n&gt; First off, blue waves have not been bearish for stocks, with the S&amp;P 500 Index higher 6 of the past 7 times and up a respectable 9.1% on average since 1950.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Blog-1.15.21-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; We shared this chart in 2020, and it shows that historically, stocks do better if an incumbent president wins versus a new president in office. This makes sense, as a new president will bring in new policies and likely question marks\u2014while you know what you will get with a re-elected president. Remember, markets hate uncertainty and surprises.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Econ-blog-1.15.21-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; \u201cMake it all nine new Democratic presidents since 1900 to bring with them both the House and the Senate. In fact, stocks do quite well that first year under such circumstances, up nearly 12% on average,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cMaybe investors shouldn\u2019t fear a blue wave after all.\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, when a new Democratic president has brought with them the House and Senate, stocks gained that first year of their new presidency 6 of 8 times. What stands out to us for 2021, though, is the House majority is only 11\u2014the smallest for a new Democratic president since 1900.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/blog-1.15.21-3.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Looking at all of the times the Democrats controlled the House (since the 35th Congress when it was Democrats and Republicans), the 11-seat majority is the lowest since 9 seats in 1879. Yes, the Democrats are in power, but this small majority will make it very tough for any of the more extreme policies to pass.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Econ-blog-1.15.21-4.png?ssl=1)**\n\n&gt; Lastly, the Senate is split a perfect 50/50, which is again extremely rare. In the chart below we share the seat difference between the two parties. \u201cA 50/50 Senate coupled with only an 11-seat majority in the House, and it is safe to say we have about as close to a perfectly divided government as we\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d said Detrick.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Econ-blog-1.15.21-5.png?ssl=1)**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Rest of the World Catching Up\n\n&gt; Over the past year, US equities\u2014proxied by the S&amp;P 500 (SPY)\u2014have consistently outperformed global equities more broadly. As shown below, over the past year the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) has risen just over 16%. That compares to 11.26% for the rest of the world as proxied by the Vanguard FTSE All-World ex US ETF (VEU). Breaking that down a bit further by developed and emerging markets, US equities have outpaced both emerging and other developed markets. While emerging markets (SPEM) are right on the heels of the US with just under a 14.78% gain, developed markets (SPDW) have lagged with just a 10.56% gain. So far in 2021, though, the rest of the world has been outperforming the US. Whereas SPY has risen around 1% YTD, VEU is up almost 3 times that. Emerging markets in particular have shown the greatest degree of strength currently having risen 3.87%. Meanwhile, SPDW has gained less (2.7%), though, it is still outperforming the US.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/01/011221-ETFs.png))**\n\n&gt; In the charts below, we show the ratio of SPY to these other ETFs. A rising line would indicate that the US is outperforming these other measures of global equities while a downward trending line indicates underperformance of SPY. As shown, the longer-term trend has pretty consistently been US outperformance over the past decade but that has faltered at the tail end of 2020 and into 2021. In the case of emerging markets, the line has been on the decline throughout the second half of 2020 as the ratio has hit its lowest level in a year in the past week. The S&amp;P 500's underperformance relative to other developed markets (SPDW) has been more recent as that line peaked in early September but the trend remains the same over the past few months with SPY weaker than global equities more broadly. That is further exemplified by the recent downtrend of SPY versus the All World ex US ETF (VEU).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/01/011221-RS2.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Small Business Owners Didn't Like the Election Results\n\n&gt; Today's release of the December Small Business Optimism Index from the NFIB saw a large drop as the index dropped from 101.4 to 95.9. After a sharp drop in the wake of the COVID outbreak, the index bounced back nicely but now looks like it's really rolling over.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/01/011221-NFIB-Small-Business-Chart.png))**\n\n&gt; Not only was this month's headline index weak, but it caught economists completely off guard. While the index fell to 95.9, economists were expecting a drop to 100.2. That 4.3 spread between the actual and expected reading was the biggest miss relative to expectations in more than five years (July 2015) and was the third weakest reading relative to expectations since the December 2012 report.\n\n&gt; Given the big drop in the headline index and the fact that it was so weak relative to expectations, should we be concerned about a double-dip? As an investor, we should always be worried about what could go wrong, but in the case of this report, you can probably wait for further confirmation from other data. The reason for the skepticism is that you could argue that politics plays a role in this report. To illustrate this, we would note that going back to 2010 (as far back as we have data) and right up through Election Day 2016, the NFIB only topped expectations 42% of the time. Following Trump's election in 2016, though, this index surged and has since topped expectations 63% of the time. Since Election Day 2020, though, the headline index has now missed expectations three times.\n\n&gt; From a longer-term perspective, dating back to 1974, the average reading of the NFIB Small Business Index during Republican administrations has been 100.1 while the average level under Democratic Presidents has been 96.2. Now, that would make sense if the economy was also in a recession more often in those periods, but over that same span, even though the percentages are low for both political parties (&lt;20%), the economy has actually been in a recession a higher percentage of the time during Republican administrations than it has in Democratic administrations.\n\n&gt; The lesson to take from all this is that even if it's often hard to separate when it comes to business or investing (or a lot of other aspects of our lives for that matter), it's usually best to leave politics outside.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/01/011221-NFIB-Small-Business-Survey.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending January 15th, 2021** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmx1VYd-S_k))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 1.17.21**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED!)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!]())**\n(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/JwUJdcm.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MOST ANTICIPATED EARNINGS RELEASES FOR FINANCIAL COMPANIES ONLY FOR THE NEXT 4 WEEKS!](https://i.imgur.com/aC5hzkZ.jpg))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MOST ANTICIPATED EARNINGS RELEASES FOR NASDAQ 100 COMPANIES ONLY FOR THE NEXT 4 WEEKS!](https://i.imgur.com/zIQniHK.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 1.18.21 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.

While AITX and recently SSFT is enlarging their caps IWSY is super modest with the following revenue numbers.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ikmn5jmpwod61.png?width=1298&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f4bcfea76d63dfcd6c13048ee813736c04a71ce1\n\n**Revenue:**\n\nMy most favorite metric. There's a draw between SSFT and IWSY here while AITX is still unbelievably low in revenues. I'm sure it will go up soon. But what comes first? Revenue or Share Price? I believe if your signal is Revenue you'll be safer. Otherwise you might just be blowing up a balloon.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wx0gorylwod61.png?width=1284&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e3af2e0afd08a7c39170fba7171a93ad4daae56c\n\n**Debt:**\n\nDebt is secondary to revenue in importance. Because debt might come from certain expenses that are essential to generate more revenue. IWSY here is more in trouble than SSFT with almost 3x debt with similar revenue. But I need to dig deeper into this to understand where it came from. AITX debt is still like a mountain in contrast to their revenue but at least they got a leeway until late 2022 to pay them back and I think 8 million is not going to be a big number for them when the times comes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img 0kbcpivwwod61...*\n\n**Gross Profit:**\n\nGross profit is the difference between sales and the cost of goods sold. Revenues (aka Sales) less Cost of Goods Sold is a company's gross profit. Increasing gross profits are a good sign for a company (it means the company is generating money from sales). Imageware is absolute winner here. I'd say software business is always more profitable than real goods sale but man IWSY here created a product that brings pure profits. Now compare this increase with the increase in share price and you'll understand why I'm so excited about this stock.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8e9zdmkzwod61.png?width=1291&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=39d7ff1826aae8fb9bf7d9bd57bd9f71c414cd3d\n\n**Total Operating Expenses:**\n\nTotal Operating Expense is the total expenses that are incurred over a given period of time as a result of normal business activities. Imageware CEO is doing an excellent job of lowering expenses while increasing revenue. This is a very strong indicator of a solid foundation. SSFT is also doing great in this department and AITX naturally needs to increase expenses to be able to scale up.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kkk3fje3xod61.png?width=1291&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4b711d62dc2697438736d2cad2a7818dea5d13ce\n\nAvailable Cash:\n\nNow this chart is not accurate because as I mentioned, ISWY did a special placement for $11.5 million in December and that's not accounted in here. But I still want to show for the sake of comparison. They have plenty of cash.\n\n*Processing img z91p4to5xod61...*\n\n**Popularity:**\n\nNo one knows. Really. [https://stocktwits.com/symbol/IWSY](https://stocktwits.com/symbol/IWSY)\n\n**Only 44 followers on Stocktwits today.** \n\n**So what is the short term price target?**\n\nInitial resistance is $0.5 if this is broken they have to reach and stay above $1 if they are really serious about **getting listed in Nasdaq**. I hope to see them reaching that goal in the first half of 2021.\n\n**Not Financial Advice**\n\nI'm not an investment advisor.

        "selftext": "First I want to say I'm a semiconductor permabull and this is 80% rant 20% question. \n\nIntel has shown time and time again that they won't get their heads out of the sand and admit defeat with their inferior node. Even with a new CEO, the same old mentality still persists with the company. Their atrocious guidance caused not only their stock, but the rest of the stocks in the semiconductor space to fall. I understand this is only temporary and the other semi stocks will go right back up. However, what bugs me is how this still happens even though it's obvious for over a year now that it's a problem internal to Intel and not an industry wide problem. I remember back in 2017/18 Intel's disastrous earnings always caused AMD to fall. Luckily it changed last year. \n\nI understand some investors see Intel as a money printing machine, but had they follow AMD for a past few years, they'd learn that most of the revenue were from deals Intel made way back when they forced AMD out of the space with monopolous policies. But that's besides the point. I'm curious what it would take for investors to stop associating Intel with successful semiconductor companies. Like IBM problems don't cause the rest of the tech industry to fall anymore does it? When will this happen in the semiconductor space? \n\nI have no position in Intel, but I'm long on countless other semiconductors stocks with my top five positions in AMD, NVDA, TSM, MU, and ASML. \n\nSidenote: we're in the semiconductor supercycle so semiconductor stocks should vastly outperform general tech stocks this year.",

        "selftext": "I will try to explain options as easily as possible due to the numerous questions on options from $GME &amp; $AMC, messages, and reddit posts.\n\nPlease, understand what you investing in before you do it. Be smart. I will try to explain options as easily as possible. Please feel free to do further research. I hope this inspires some intellectual curiosity.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. As simply put,  think of a call option as **a down-payment for a future purchase**.\n   1. For example, a call option for $1 will allow you to purchase $TSLA stock for $1,000 on a future date. With options, you do not need to purchase the stock, you are purchasing an option that allows you to purchase the stock, if you want to.\n2. One option is called a contract, and each contract represents 100 shares of the underlying stock.\n3. The two most common uses of options are for (1) as insurance to hedge long or short stock position, and (2) to speculate/ gamble.\n   1. You can make money in a Bull market by buying call options\n   2. You can make money in a Bear market by buying put options\n   3. You can make money in a neutral market/ sideways market by writing covered calls\n4. Options allow you to make money when the markets are going up, down, or not even moving/ neutral.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Tips:**\n\n* \"Volume\" refers to the number of contracts traded in a given period, and \"open interest\" denotes the number of contracts that are active, or not settled.\u00a0\u00a0A higher volume also results in increased liquidity, meaning it will be easier for investors to get out of a contract faster if needed\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Glossary:**\n\n* **Strike price:** The price at which you can buy the underlying stock\n* **Premium:** The price of the option, for either buyer or seller\n* **Expiration:** When the option expires and is settled\n* **In-the-money call option:** means the option holder has the opportunity to buy the security below its current market price\n* **An in-the-money put option:** means the option holder can sell the security above its current market price\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere is a real life example from Investopedia, who has great educational content:\n\nAs a quick example, let's say IBM is currently trading at $100 per share. Now, let's say an investor purchases one call option contract on IBM with a $100 strike price at a premium of $2.\n\nThat premium is the price you're paying for the right to buy 100 IBM shares for $100. But rather than costing us $10,000, like it would on the open market, we're only paying $200 (100 shares x $2 = $200).\n\n**Here's what will happen to the value of this call option under a variety of different scenarios:**\n\n**(1) When the option expires, IBM is trading at $105.**\n\nThe **call option** gives the buyer the right to purchase shares of IBM at $100 per share. In this scenario, the buyer could use the option to purchase those shares at $100, then immediately sell those same shares in the open market for $105. Because of this, the option will sell for $5 on the expiration date.\n\n**Since each option represents an interest in 100 underlying shares, this will amount to a total sale price of $500**. **Since the investor purchased this option for $200, the net profit to the buyer from this trade will be $300. That's a 150% return on a 5% move in the underlying shares**. Not bad.\n\n**(2) When the option expires, IBM is trading at $101.**\n\nUsing the same analysis as shown above, the call option will now be worth $1 (or $100 per contract). Since the investor spent $200 to purchase the option in the first place, he or she will show a net loss on this trade of $100.\n\n**(3) When the option expires, IBM is trading at or below $100.**\n\nIf IBM ends up at or below $100 on the option's expiration date, then the contract will expire \"out of the money,\" meaning it will now be worthless. In this scenario, the option buyer will lose 100% of his or her money (in this case, the full $200 that he or she spent for the contract).\n\nThat alone isn't the end of the world, since we're only talking about $200 and not thousands of dollars.

Since 2014, the firm has relied on M&amp;A to pivot its business toward software. It encountered nine straight years of revenue decline, ending in 2020. BlackBerry\u2019s ability to generate meaningful organic growth going forward will be paramount to its success. BlackBerry\u2019s future will also depend on its ability to integrate and expand upon prior acquisitions, specifically Cylance. As an endpoint protection platform, Cylance could bolster every other BlackBerry product by layering on advanced machine learning and artificial intelligence capabilities. However, we have yet to see management drive organic growth out of this addition in its early days. BlackBerry competes in highly fragmented and competitive markets, against some of the largest companies out there. It may be difficult for BlackBerry to maintain or steal market share from companies such as Microsoft, IBM, and VMware with 10 or more times the revenue and R&amp;D budget that it has. BlackBerry encounters the opposite problem with its QNX software, where it must compete with freely available Android and Linux operating systems. In these markets, it will need to continually innovate ahead of the competition to maintain pricing power, and thus market share, over these alternatives. BlackBerry faces risk from being a relatively small and unproven new entrant into its key markets. Customers that are highly risk averse might opt to go with a more established competitor for an end-to-end solution, especially when money is tight. While in periods of economic growth, its name recognition might help to attract customers, in downturns, customers might steer clear of a name they associate with a sharp drop-off from a leadership position in the smartphone market in the early 2010s.",

        "selftext": "Disclaimer: this is my first published DD post, I do not claim to know all there is to writing a good DD post and any feedback/comments are greatly appreciated.\n\nDisclosure: It is important to always do your own DD before investing. Everything in this post is based on my personal opinion and open-source information. Please don't see this as any financial or investing advice. I have no positions in Okta at the moment.\n\n**OKTA - General Description**\n\nThe company can be seen as providing Identity-as-a-Service (IDaaS) and is one of the leading companies in the IDaaS market. Okta primarily focusses on 6 main industries: Healthcare, Public Sector, Education, Energy, Financial Services and Technology providing their services to more than 9400 small, medium and large enterprises worldwide.\n\nOkta's main product is the Okta Identity Cloud which is comprised of 6 platform services:\n\n    Directories: stores users and attributes\n    \n    Integrations: ensures that apps (currently 6500+) can connect to Okta\n    \n    Insights: aggregates, analyses and disseminates data from Okta and its partners\n    \n    Identity Engine: customizable access experiences like authorization, authentication and registration\n    \n    Workflows: automates identity-centric processes\n    \n    Devices: collects device identity and context\n\nThese platform services can be leveraged using Okta's products, API's and SDK's like:\n\n    Single Sign On\n    Universal Directory\n    Advanced Server Access\n    Adaptive Multi-actor Authentication\n    Lifecycle Management\n    Access Gateway\n    API Access Management\n    Developer\n    One App\n    Enterprise\n\n**Okta Integration Platform**\n\nThe biggest part that makes Okta a key player is the fact that they integrated 6500+ applications into their cloud and on-premises systems which ensure that on all aspects, an organization can secure their processes. They integrated:\n\n* Human Resources Information Systems like bambooHR and Workday\n* Network Security like Cisco, PaloAlto and Fortinet\n* Application Delivery Controllers like F5, Akamai and Citrix Netsclar\n* Security Analytics like Splunk, Rapid1, IBM QRadar\n* Cloud Access Security Brokers like Bitglass and McAfee\n* API Gateways like AWS, Google Cloud, Apigee\n* Identity Governance and Administration like SailPoint\n* ID Proofing like Acuant, Evident and Experian\n* Privileged Access Management like BeyondTrust and CyberArk\n* Endpoint Security and Management like IBM, MobileIron and VMware\n* Healthcare Technologies like Cerner and AthenaHealth\n* Protocol Based Custom Integrations like Radius, LDAP and SAML\n* Bot Detection like Arkose Labs, Shape and Perimeter\n* Customer Data Integrators like Segment\n* Email Security like ProofPoint\n* SaaS Management Platforms like BetterCloud and Intello\n\nI've made this list, to show how versatile and broad their product is. They ensure that their single product can be used for a multitude of cases within the Workforce Identity, Customer Identity and Access Management market segments.\n\n**How they make money**\n\nOkta's business model follows a SaaS-based delivery model in which business subscribe to Okta's services and pay a fee per user per month. Okta's subscription revenues in the 9 months ending 10/31/2020 jumped 50% YoY to $571.2M.\n\n**Financials &amp; Valuations (as of** [10/31/2020](https://investor.okta.com/news-releases/news-release-details/okta-announces-strong-third-quarter-results)**):**\n\n* Current Market Capitalization (as of 1/15/2021) - $32.75B\n* Total Revenue (3 months): $217,379,000\n* Total Revenue (9 months): $600,684,000\n* Net Profit (Loss) \u2013 3 months: ($72,764,000) \u2013 Up from ($63,495,000)\n* Net Profit (Loss) \u2013 9 months: ($190,526,00) \u2013 Up from ($158,441,000)\n* Cash on Hand: $2.945B\n\n**Growth &amp; Opportunities**\n\nOkta is one of the companies that greatly benefited from the lockdowns all over the world, and the subsequent rise in the need for identity and access management services triggered by the  work-from-home wave. The company's momentum will highly likely continue through fiscal 2021 and beyond, with more and more companies looking to ensure safe and secure work-from-home environments that protects companies, their employees and their customers. CFO Bill Losch said on the company's third-quarter [earnings call](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/earnings),  \"We remain confident that the factors that are driving our business today will continue to drive our business well into the future.\"\n\nJust recently, [Okta's products were made available in the AWS Marketplace](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201202005943/en/Okta-and-Amazon-Web-Services-Bring-the-Okta-Identity-Cloud-to-AWS-Marketplace). It is expected that this move will drive top-line growth.\n\nOkta estimates that it will end fiscal 2021 with revenue of about $822.5 million, an increase of 40% from the previous year, and that it will surpass $1 billion in sales in fiscal 2022. Although Okta isn't profitable yet, one of its pro's is that the free cash flow consistently stays on the plus side and makes up 19% of Okta's revenue. One of the most important contracts in this business are annual contracts. Okta gained 100 customers in Q3 with $100,000+ annual contracts, totaling over 1700 customers. The number of large enterprise contracts ($500,000+) grew 50% YoY to 320. These now represent 80% of Okta's annual contract values.\n\nAs president-elect Joe Biden will take office later this week, one of the most anticipated moves is an [increase in cyber security](https://buildbackbetter.gov/press-releases/statement-by-president-elect-joe-biden-on-cybersecurity/) spending by the new administration. Putting Okta, among other big cyber security players, into an excellent playing field the coming years.\n\n**Price Target**\n\nMarch 3 is the expected Q4 earnings. Okta is in a good position to beat their ER once again.\n\n[18 Analysts](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/OKTA/analysis?p=OKTA) combined have an average price target of $262.44.17 (upside of \\~4%) with tops being at $313.\n\n**TL;DR Okta is in a great position within the Identity and Access Management market which makes the company one of the ideal high-growth stocks moving forward. Personally, I think it is worth taking a look at and most likely a stock that will pay off not only when Q4 Earnings are reported, but easily for the next 2 years at least.**",

        "selftext": "Original post: [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/c1v24n/success/)\n\nHi r/Stocks!\n\nA year and a half ago I posted here to celebrate hitting $16,000 USD from a $10,000 USD investment my mom gave me. I was 16 at the time and I am now 17, turning 18 in about a month. My stock picks included CRSP, ZIOP, FLEX, CELG (bought by BMY), TGT, IBM, and SGEN. You can see the amounts in my previous post. I entered the market on October 29, 2018.\n\nThe last time I posted there were concerns of underaged trading, but all trading was done through a custodial account by my mom. \n\nAnyways, when I posted the majority of responses told me to sell at least some of my position, but I decided not to. My account precede to grow to $19,500 before cashing down to $10,500 during the coronavirus crash. Now my account is at $33,000 and I am glad I never sold.\n\n Although I didn't mention it at the time , my mom also invest $10,000 in the stock market at the same time picking some of the same stocks as me, but also some of her own including QCOM, INTC, and TSLA (yup). I didn't mention it at the time because her account was not performing as well as mine. Now it is at $44,000. \n\nLast night I was able to convince my mom to sell her position in TSLA ($20,000) on the market open today. We both also sold other stock we didn't see much more potential in like TGT, FLEX and some USO we picked up when it was down. We made a nice profit on each of those picks. I now have $7,500 in cash and my mom has $24,000 in cash.\n\nI thought you all might like the update, so here it is. Also, last time I posted someone recommended picking up ENPH, which I didn't and is now up 500%. Oh well.",

        "selftext": "Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning January 18th, 2021.\n\n# **Biden heads into inauguration with a stock market tailwind - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/15/biden-heads-into-inauguration-with-a-stock-market-tailwind.html)**\n*****\n&gt; President-elect Joe Biden moves into the White House in the coming week with the biggest stock market tailwind since a presidential Election Day going back to at least 1952.\n*****\n&gt; According to CFRA data that begins that year, the near 13% gain since Nov. 3 would be the biggest increase in the S&amp;P 500 between the election and inauguration if the gains hold. President John F. Kennedy\u2019s 8.8% gain had been the best, followed by President Dwight Eisenhower, with 6.3%, and President Donald Trump, with 6.2%.\n*****\n&gt; Biden\u2019s promise of the $1.9 trillion relief package he announced Thursday is one of the reasons for the stock market\u2019s surge, and it will be a big focus of markets in the week ahead as investors handicap its chances of winning congressional approval.\n*****\n&gt; The Martin Luther King Jr. Day holiday starts off the week, and over the next four days several dozen S&amp;P 500 companies report earnings. Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, IBM, Intel and Procter &amp; Gamble are among the companies reporting.\n*****\n&gt; # Biden will have no honeymoon\nThe $1.9 trillion stimulus package is at the top of the agenda. But there is also significant focus on whether his administration will be better at controlling the pandemic and rolling out the vaccine, as he has promised.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThis is the number he came in at. Where do negotiations go from here?\u201d Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial, said of the $1.9 trillion package. She pointed to worries about a weakening economy, evident in December\u2019s retail sales data, down a surprising 0.7%, and weekly jobless claims, at the worst level since August.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cYou could argue this is Covid-related and therefore what is most important going forward is to see the logistics of the vaccines, inoculations gain orderly momentum. That is crucial for the market,\u201d she said.\n*****\n&gt; Krosby said the market is focused on the inauguration.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThey want to see it go smoothly, and that there\u2019s not any security lapse. The market absorbed the events of Jan. 6. The market looked ahead and figured out that at this point it was a one-off, and the market ended higher on Jan. 6,\u201d she said. \u201cBut always the market becomes much more defensive if what we considered an isolated event suddenly broadens out.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; There will be heightened security surrounding the inauguration after a mob of Trump supporters assaulted the Capitol while Congress was in the process of confirming the Electoral College vote. The House last week voted to impeach Trump for inciting the mob, and now there is concern about further incidents in Washington or at state capitals.\n*****\n&gt; # Stimulus and stocks\nMarkets are also watching carefully to see whether Biden can bridge some of the deep divide between Republicans and Democrats, who now hold a thin majority in Congress.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe\u2019re getting stimulus, and now the question is \u2018OK, you\u2019re supposed to be this great compromiser,\u2019\u201d said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA.\n*****\n&gt; Political strategists expect Biden will get his stimulus package but it will be trimmed down. Ed Mills, Washington policy analyst at Raymond James, said the package could be cut to about $1 trillion based on the size previously discussed by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and outgoing Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cDoes Congress want to have a bipartisan show of support after what has been an extraordinarily tenuous beginning of this year, to put it mildly?\u201d Mills said. He said the stock market should continue to do well because it is going to get stimulus spending.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cD.C. is going to be there with more spending, or consumers are going to be there with more spending if they have the ability to get to a post-vaccine world sooner,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; Stovall said that if history is a guide, the stock market should do well with Biden. The average gain of the S&amp;P 500 in the first 100 days for Democratic presidents is 3.5%, going back to 1952. For Republicans in the same period, it\u2019s been an average 0.5%.\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 has also gained an average 11.3% in the first year of a Democratic president, but just 5.7% for Republicans, going back to World War II.\n*****\n&gt; The stock market will continue to monitor the bond market, after the 10-year Treasury yield reached a high of 1.18% this past week, the highest since March. It since slid back to about 1.08% Friday after the weak data.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cOther things are going on in the back room. Bond yields have moved up of late, and it was a change. It gave you a sense of how fast rates can move,\u201d said James Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Leuthold Group. \u201cIt might be a preview of what you can expect this year.\u201d\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/NdqXqj3.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/78MvG08.jpg))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/HogqBPe.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/yPgkKR9.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/o6jTeP5.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/7BeafeZ.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/zGNf0yh.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/MhhsYpF.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/yhXOGJz.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/1E2Rohq.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/a74UeZP.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/a97ysV9.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/skrsU4T.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Martin Luther King Jr. Holiday Week Trading: Leans Bearish\n\n&gt; Although Martin Luther King Jr. Day was a holiday in many states and cities throughout the U.S. beginning in 1971, it did not become a federal holiday until 1986. Even then it was not observed by the NYSE until 1998. In the 23 years since, the market\u2019s performance during this four-trading-day week has been somewhat lackluster with average weekly performance negative for DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ, Russell 1000 and Russell 2000. Average losses range from 0.81% by DJIA to 0.16% by NASDAQ. Of the five indexes, not one has a record better than 50/50. However, since 2012 performance has shown signs of improving. DJIA, NASDAQ and Russell 2000 have risen in six of the last nine years. S&amp;P 500 and Russell 1000 have climbed in five of the last eight.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/67df4ce1594bee9748fb885a5316ff07/b5f21cb74511d020-c9/s500x750/218ed920ea1a67d95ff97fd05a5b9bbdf2454805.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Seasonal Soft Patch Ahead Starting Next Week\n\n&gt; With nine trading sessions of the New Year complete, January and 2021 are off to a solid start. DJIA is up 1.26% as of today\u2019s close, S&amp;P 500 stands at 1.05%, NASDAQ 1.74% and small caps, measured by the Russell 2000 are up a whopping 9.14%. These gains all point to and confirm the return of seasonality that we have recently noted.\n\n&gt; Last September was weak as it has historically been, then October exhibited it historical tendency toward volatility while November and December were both positive, in line with typical seasonal patterns. A positive Santa Claus Rally and First Five Days are also encouraging indications that seasonal forces are once again tracking. We expect seasonality will continue to present itself going forward as extraordinary efforts are made to quell the pandemic and return to a pre-Covid, open-for-business, way of life.\n\n&gt; Due to the reemergence of seasonality, we would not be surprised to see some market weakness in the second half of January next week that could persist throughout the rest of January and possible spill over into February. In the following seasonal pattern chart of January, the last 21 years of data for DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ, Russell 1000 and 2000 have been plotted with January 2021 through today\u2019s close plotted on the right vertical axis.\n\n&gt; Over the last 21 years, it has been NASDAQ leading at the halfway point, this year it is Russell 2000. Other than that, the major indexes have been tracking their historical patterns fairly well. There was strength early on, followed by sideways action. Should the current trend follow historical patterns then weakness after the eleventh trading day (January 18) is possible.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/c921e48e1e14dd8a61d2ad5cc18d7f94/f775f74bce597bb1-b6/s500x750/409599af0a5ca5a6fbb2ba71a5b1ead87d5852f8.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 5 Charts on the Democratic Blue Wave\n\n&gt; One of the top questions we\u2019ve received recently has been what a blue wave may mean for investments. After the Democrats won the two Senate runoff elections in Georgia, they will now control the White House and both chambers of Congress. Our January 11 Market Policy Projections for 2021 gave some of the immediate and longer-term policy impacts of the Democratic \u201cblue wave,\u201d and here we surf the blue wave with some interesting charts.\n\n&gt; First off, blue waves have not been bearish for stocks, with the S&amp;P 500 Index higher 6 of the past 7 times and up a respectable 9.1% on average since 1950.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Blog-1.15.21-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; We shared this chart in 2020, and it shows that historically, stocks do better if an incumbent president wins versus a new president in office. This makes sense, as a new president will bring in new policies and likely question marks\u2014while you know what you will get with a re-elected president. Remember, markets hate uncertainty and surprises.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Econ-blog-1.15.21-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; \u201cMake it all nine new Democratic presidents since 1900 to bring with them both the House and the Senate. In fact, stocks do quite well that first year under such circumstances, up nearly 12% on average,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cMaybe investors shouldn\u2019t fear a blue wave after all.\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, when a new Democratic president has brought with them the House and Senate, stocks gained that first year of their new presidency 6 of 8 times. What stands out to us for 2021, though, is the House majority is only 11\u2014the smallest for a new Democratic president since 1900.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/blog-1.15.21-3.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Looking at all of the times the Democrats controlled the House (since the 35th Congress when it was Democrats and Republicans), the 11-seat majority is the lowest since 9 seats in 1879. Yes, the Democrats are in power, but this small majority will make it very tough for any of the more extreme policies to pass.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Econ-blog-1.15.21-4.png?ssl=1)**\n\n&gt; Lastly, the Senate is split a perfect 50/50, which is again extremely rare. In the chart below we share the seat difference between the two parties. \u201cA 50/50 Senate coupled with only an 11-seat majority in the House, and it is safe to say we have about as close to a perfectly divided government as we\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d said Detrick.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Econ-blog-1.15.21-5.png?ssl=1)**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Rest of the World Catching Up\n\n&gt; Over the past year, US equities\u2014proxied by the S&amp;P 500 (SPY)\u2014have consistently outperformed global equities more broadly. As shown below, over the past year the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) has risen just over 16%. That compares to 11.26% for the rest of the world as proxied by the Vanguard FTSE All-World ex US ETF (VEU). Breaking that down a bit further by developed and emerging markets, US equities have outpaced both emerging and other developed markets. While emerging markets (SPEM) are right on the heels of the US with just under a 14.78% gain, developed markets (SPDW) have lagged with just a 10.56% gain. So far in 2021, though, the rest of the world has been outperforming the US. Whereas SPY has risen around 1% YTD, VEU is up almost 3 times that. Emerging markets in particular have shown the greatest degree of strength currently having risen 3.87%. Meanwhile, SPDW has gained less (2.7%), though, it is still outperforming the US.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/01/011221-ETFs.png))**\n\n&gt; In the charts below, we show the ratio of SPY to these other ETFs. A rising line would indicate that the US is outperforming these other measures of global equities while a downward trending line indicates underperformance of SPY. As shown, the longer-term trend has pretty consistently been US outperformance over the past decade but that has faltered at the tail end of 2020 and into 2021. In the case of emerging markets, the line has been on the decline throughout the second half of 2020 as the ratio has hit its lowest level in a year in the past week. The S&amp;P 500's underperformance relative to other developed markets (SPDW) has been more recent as that line peaked in early September but the trend remains the same over the past few months with SPY weaker than global equities more broadly. That is further exemplified by the recent downtrend of SPY versus the All World ex US ETF (VEU).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/01/011221-RS2.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Small Business Owners Didn't Like the Election Results\n\n&gt; Today's release of the December Small Business Optimism Index from the NFIB saw a large drop as the index dropped from 101.4 to 95.9. After a sharp drop in the wake of the COVID outbreak, the index bounced back nicely but now looks like it's really rolling over.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/01/011221-NFIB-Small-Business-Chart.png))**\n\n&gt; Not only was this month's headline index weak, but it caught economists completely off guard. While the index fell to 95.9, economists were expecting a drop to 100.2. That 4.3 spread between the actual and expected reading was the biggest miss relative to expectations in more than five years (July 2015) and was the third weakest reading relative to expectations since the December 2012 report.\n\n&gt; Given the big drop in the headline index and the fact that it was so weak relative to expectations, should we be concerned about a double-dip? As an investor, we should always be worried about what could go wrong, but in the case of this report, you can probably wait for further confirmation from other data. The reason for the skepticism is that you could argue that politics plays a role in this report. To illustrate this, we would note that going back to 2010 (as far back as we have data) and right up through Election Day 2016, the NFIB only topped expectations 42% of the time. Following Trump's election in 2016, though, this index surged and has since topped expectations 63% of the time. Since Election Day 2020, though, the headline index has now missed expectations three times.\n\n&gt; From a longer-term perspective, dating back to 1974, the average reading of the NFIB Small Business Index during Republican administrations has been 100.1 while the average level under Democratic Presidents has been 96.2. Now, that would make sense if the economy was also in a recession more often in those periods, but over that same span, even though the percentages are low for both political parties (&lt;20%), the economy has actually been in a recession a higher percentage of the time during Republican administrations than it has in Democratic administrations.\n\n&gt; The lesson to take from all this is that even if it's often hard to separate when it comes to business or investing (or a lot of other aspects of our lives for that matter), it's usually best to leave politics outside.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/01/011221-NFIB-Small-Business-Survey.png))**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/yhXOGJz.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/DAPsqr2.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MOST ANTICIPATED EARNINGS RELEASES FOR FINANCIAL COMPANIES ONLY FOR THE NEXT 4 WEEKS!](https://i.imgur.com/aC5hzkZ.jpg))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MOST ANTICIPATED EARNINGS RELEASES FOR NASDAQ 100 COMPANIES ONLY FOR THE NEXT 4 WEEKS!](https://i.imgur.com/zIQniHK.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 1.18.21 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.

        "selftext": "I have a small position in BB and have been considering expanding, but one thing I haven't seen much of in all the DD posted here is thorough analysis of Blackberry QNX's competition (I thought \"DD\" stood for \"due diligence\"? /s)\n\nAs a disclaimer, I have no auto industry background, but I do have experience in software.\n\nI'll be including hyperlinked sources for all stats and claims I make. \n\n# First off, reasons I like BB \n\nA lot of this has been overdone in this subreddit, but in summary:\n\n* Approaching $1B software and licensing revenue on $7.85B market cap (very reasonable price to sales for SAAS)\n* CEO John Chen has a technical background (BS in Electrical Engineering from Brown, MS in EE from Caltech) [from Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_S._Chen)\n* This is super important for tech companies because a technical CEO will actually understand their product and not just be a bean counter (case study: Bob Swan and Intel)\n* CEO John Chen made the bold move of pivoting from a doomed hardware business to software and has stuck at it for the last 7 years (he's not going anywhere until he accomplishes his mission)\n* Recent Sony/AWS/etc. partnerships\n* They are the incumbent in auto OS with Blackberry QNX running on 175 million cars right now [PR Newswire source](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/blackberry-qnx-software-now-embedded-in-more-than-175-million-vehicles-301081594.html)\n* 5 years ago, they were at 60 million, so that's a CAGR of 23.8% per year (though that's starting to slow - 2019 to 2020 was 150M --&gt; 175M so 16.7% as they reach saturation I imagine + COVID)\n* Diversified revenue streams (licensing, patents, QNX, Spark, etc.)\n* IEC safety certs + possibility of integrating with their own security products ([https://blackberry.qnx.com/en/resource-center/qnx-certifications](https://blackberry.qnx.com/en/resource-center/qnx-certifications)) (I haven't found anything similar for Android Automotive yet, let me know if there is)\n\n# What is Android Automotive? (hint: not the same as Android Auto)\n\n* First off, Google made this very confusing by having two different things called \"Android Automotive\" (the OS) and \"Android Auto\" (the app)\n* [Here's what they say](https://source.android.com/devices/automotive/start/what_automotive):\n\n&gt;**Android Automotive is Android**. Android Automotive is not a fork or parallel development of Android. It is the same codebase and lives in the same repository as the Android shipped on phones, tablets, etc. It builds on a robust platform and feature set developed over 10+ years, enabling it to leverage the existing security model, compatibility program, developer tools, and infrastructure while continuing to be highly customizable and portable, completely free, and open source  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Android Automotive extends Android**. In the course of building Android into a full-featured platform for infotainment, we\u2019re adding support for automotive-specific requirements, features, and technologies. Android Automotive will be a full-stack, turnkey automotive infotainment platform, just as Android is for mobile today.\n\n\"Android Automotive is Android\". That's a big thing. That means:\n\n* Android Automotive is backed by Google and Google's Android teams\n* Android Automotive is backed by the Android open source community \n* Android Automotive can integrate closer with Google Play Store, Google Maps, and Google Assistant (literal quote from Nissan's press release [here](https://global.nissannews.com/en/releases/release-860852d7040eed420ffbaebb22094eb4-180918-01-e) which I cover later)\n* Any Android developers should theoretically be able to write an app for Android Automotive without too much retraining\n* We're talking about software here, so ultimately it's up to engineers and developers to actually use it\n* In the past, software deals were signed by taking CTOs and account executives to steakhouses and golfing excursions. \n* These days, engineers are a lot more involved - oftentimes spinning up prototypes to demo for their leadership before any deals are signed. (Or if they aren't, that's a huge red flag for any company that relies on tech.)\n\n# Developer friendliness case study: documentation\n\nThis sounds dumb, but let's look at what documentation engineers would have to work with:\n\nVirgin Blackberry QNX docs: [http://www.qnx.com/download/group.html?programid=29183](http://www.qnx.com/download/group.html?programid=29183)\n\n* Folder icons and entire page literally look out of Windows XP\n* You have to download PDFs (what are you going to do, print them all out and arrange them in your cubicle?)\n\nChad Android Automotive docs: [https://source.android.com/devices/automotive/evs/camera\\_system](https://source.android.com/devices/automotive/evs/camera_system)\n\n* Super clean, super easy to read, all in the browser, well organized\n\nCompare these to successful API-based SAAS services like [Stripe](https://stripe.com/docs/api) or [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/docs/usage/api). If you were a developer and learning auto OS for the first time, what would you rather use?\n\nObviously, no company is going to pick an operating system based on their documentation alone, but I think it reveals a lot about the development ecosystem that their engineers will have to operate in. And ever more these days, engineers are empowered to guide their leadership in what software they want to use (e.g. engineers would rather use easy-to-use MongoDB than stuffy old Oracle).\n\n# Market Share\n\n* As mentioned at the beginning, Blackberry QNX is killing it with 175M cars on the road\n* That's the main reason why I like it in the short term - huge amounts of recurring SAAS revenue\n\nI'm worried that in 5-10 years, Apple and Google are going to come in and eat Blackberry's lunch just like they did with mobile:\n\n* GM will use Android Automotive in all their cars starting in 2021 [The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/5/20851021/general-motors-android-auto-google-infotainment)\n\n&gt;General Motors will use Google\u2019s new Android Automotive OS to power the infotainment systems in its cars starting in 2021, the two companies announced on Thursday. That means **Google Assistant, Maps, and other automotive-approved Android apps** will be available in GM\u2019s cars via the Play Store without requiring the use of an Android smartphone.\n\n* Nissan, Renault, and Mitsubishi are using Android Automotive [Nissan press release](https://global.nissannews.com/en/releases/release-860852d7040eed420ffbaebb22094eb4-180918-01-e)\n\n&gt;World's leading automotive alliance signs a global multiyear agreement to partner with Google to equip Renault, Nissan and Mitsubishi vehicles with intelligent infotainment systems  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The Alliance will utilize Android, world's most popular operating system, to offer customers a new array of services including **Google Maps, Google Assistant and Google Play Store**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;These services will be combined with Alliance Intelligent \"Cloud based\" remote software upgrades and vehicle diagnostics\n\n* Porche's new all electric Taycan will be using Apple Car Play for all the cool software stuff (infotainment, music, etc.) while maintaining Blackberry QNX for the car critical functions [source](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/drive/mobility/article-big-tech-companies-may-soon-edge-out-automakers-with-advanced/)\n* While BB still gets their share, if the Apple/Intel developments are any indication, Apple will use 3rd parties to get going but their obsession with seamless hardware/software in their products makes me wonder how long it'll take before Apple does their own car OS\n\n# Summary\n\n* Big picture, the auto OS market is huge, \"expected to hit $4.5B by 2026\" so there's plenty of money to go around. It's possible Blackberry QNX, Android Automotive, and other OS may all flourish together. [global news wire source](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/11/24/2132346/0/en/Automotive-OS-Market-to-hit-USD-4-5-Bn-by-2026-Global-Market-Insights-Inc.html)\n* That said, I find it very worrying that companies like GM, Nissan, Porsche are deciding to partner with the Google and Apple for their new models (obviously, they have no incentive to retrofit old/existing cars with new OS)\n* Short term BB's biggest moat comes from their incumbent market share + security guarantees (ie as a customer you'd get IEC certs for free by using BB QNX). I think their next few years will remain cushy.\n* Long term, I don't see any guarantee that auto manufacturers (especially start-ups composed of SV engineers) wouldn't go with open source Android Automotive over closed source Windows XP docs BB QNX that reeks of like IBM/Oracle/HP type boomer software.\n* BB does have diversified revenue with their security offerings, so though QNX is a large portion of their revenue, it's not all.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, I do have shares of BB (as well as GOOGL) and think BB will have a jolly good time in the next 3-5 years. But I do worry that Google and Apple will come in and repeat what they did to Blackberry with mobile.\n\nObligatory \ud83e\udd5c\n\nCheers.",

        "selftext": "Hi all!\n\nI own INTC IBM and AAPL.  Both IBM and INTC dropped a day after earnings and slowly fizzling out before Friday\u2019s close.\n\nAAPL earnings are coming out this week, would it be wise to buy puts expiring this Friday at the 130 strike?  Learning the options world, it seems it would be a good form of insurance to leverage, however if Apple rockets further to the moon, the puts will expire worthless.\n\nWould this be a good options play?  Also I haven\u2019t used spreads yet, but would welcome any suggestions I can research and perhaps paper trade on TOS.\n\nThank you in advance!",

        "selftext": "What's up fellas at r/options. I made a tool called [FD Ranker](https://www.swaggystocks.com/dashboard/stocklabs/fd-ranker) that logs the average IV of popular tickers. The tool is inclusive of almost 1,000 tickers now.\n\n**What is this tool good for**\n\nI posted in ThetaGang the list with HIGH IV options which is great for running the wheel or selling options. This list is an inverse of that list and displays tickers where IV is pretty low, thus, purchasing calls will likely be cheaper. For example, AAPL implied volatility right now is almost back to the pre-March lows. Remember a low IV can go lower and a high IV can go higher.

        "selftext": " \n\nAMD (Advanced Micro Devices) is a long for years to come as semiconductors start to completely dominate our world. The basic niche of the company is selling computer parts like CPUs,  microprocessors, motherboard chipsets, embedded graphics processors, and many others. As computers start to overtake our day to day tasks, AMD will be a key player in distributing the parts necessary for the globalized tech revolution. With the growing demand for computer parts and increased reliance on tech during the pandemic, the stock continues its bullish run from 2015 to the present day. \n\nAMD began in 1969 by Walter Sanders, a former executive at Fairchild Semiconductor, which was recently acquired in 2016 by ON semiconductor. AMD released its first product in 1970 and had its IPO two years later. Throughout the 1970s and until 1986, they were a second source computer chip manufacturer. These chips were supplied to Intel, which produced microprocessors for IBM PCs. In 1996, AMD began branching out of the second source market, and in 2000, it introduced the Athlon processor, which could run the Microsoft Windows Operating System. With this release, AMD became the first company to produce a 1 gigahertz microprocessor, cementing itself as a serious player in the chip sector. \n\nIt\u2019s safe to say that AMD has lived up to their potential since the 2000 tech bubble burst. Today, the tech giant has expanded beyond measure. They are not just second-source anymore; now regular consumers have access to their variety of products, which include computer processors, motherboards, and most recently, a GPU (graphics processing unit). Among their most successful items is the AMD Ryzen, a vast lineup of around 15 CPUs. The higher-powered CPUs appeal more to gamers while the lower end ones target average households and casual pc users. Included in the graphics processing unit lineup is the Radeon XT series, however, companies like NVIDIA hold the edge over AMD in this sector, as AMD specializes in CPUs. Overall, AMD has built a strong foundation and continues to be a mainstay company for gamers and computer enthusiasts alike. \n\nHowever, the future for AMD will not be easy. AMD is stationed in a sector filled with juggernauts such as Intel, NVIDIA, and Qualcomm. These companies have also taken major strides during this pandemic, with NVIDIA acquiring microchip company ARM, finally entering into the CPU business and Intel rolling out its extremely powerful 10th gen processor series known as Ice Lake in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic. It\u2019s safe to say that for AMD to come on top in this heavily occupied sector, it will have to cause a serious market disruption with a new product or software announcement. With many new products and acquisitions speculated to be happening soon, there is a tremendous opportunity for AMD to gain separation over its other competitors and develop something completely revolutionary. There are two main things I will discuss here: the finances of AMD and current growth, and the future forecast for the company\u2019s operations.\n\nWith that, let\u2019s take a quick dive into AMD\u2019s financials and compare them to some of AMD\u2019s competitors.\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\nCash was decreasing from 2016 to 2018 until seeing an increase in 2019. However, if you look at the total debt for AMD, this starts to make sense. The debt was decreasing as well, and the most likely cause was that the company was using some of its cash to pay it off. On top of this other assets for AMD increased which increased its current ratio. More specifically non-current assets (long-term investments) increased by 40% from 2018 to 2019, which is far above the previous 10% increase in long-term assets. This signifies AMD\u2019s commitment to their product and confidence in their ability as they reinvested into their core product. Overall, the cash to debt ratio in 2019 is beyond excellent, seeing a significant jump in cash from 2018, and seeing a gigantic plummet in total debt when compared to 2018. This ratio is definitely an eye-popping stat for skeptical investors.  However, it must be noted that the total current liabilities have increased quite a bit since 2018.  AMD has also seen constant growth in shareholder\u2019s equity, which indicates that AMD had to raise more capital in order to tackle some larger ventures, and in exchange for that they issued more common stock. This can dilute existing shareholders and it\u2019ll probably continue to happen if AMD follows its current growth trajectory, which will require even more financing. \n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\nAbove are the shares outstanding for the company (Macrotrends.net). Despite increasing equity financing recently, the stock has only gone up since as return on equity was sufficient to not scare away shareholders. This is an extremely good sign, as normally if the shares outstanding metric sees significant growth, the stock price becomes diluted because the additional amount of shares may decrease the overall value of the share for the other investors\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\nTaking a quick look into AMD\u2019s income statement, we can see that the revenue growth was gaining magnificent momentum until last year, where it plateaued. The same case is with net income; we saw substantial growth in net income from 2016-2018, however, the growth shrank after that. Clearly the largest growth and most prosperous period for the company was from 2017 to the start of 2019, where the revenue grew 28%, and not coincidentally, the stock rose 70% growth in the 2018 fiscal year (Forbes). EBITDA has also seen some good growth from 2017-2019. However, the drastic slowdown in growth might raise an eye to some investors. For example, the revenue grew 18% from 2017 to 2018 but grew a measly 3% the following year. This plateau is most evident in the EBITDA value. The EBITDA value rose 58% from 2017 to 2018 and slowed down to 13% growth from 2018 to 2019. This slowdown could be attributed to less inventory being sold in 2019 than in 2018, and the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry. Regardless of revenues, AMD has consistently spent \u2154 of OpEx on R&amp;D for its latest chipsets. This inherently makes it an unstable business, and the risk factors here are numerous (as they were with Nvidia which has also seen several swings in prices in the past). Regardless of this, fundamentals for the company still remain strong as CPU demand isn\u2019t expected to go anywhere. That\u2019s why despite the revenue growth slowing down in 2019, the share price continued to rocket because the semiconductor industry has a certain pattern that didn\u2019t phase any experienced investors. AMD is likely working on the next generation of chips that\u2019ll continue to pull them up sales-wise. \n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\nFree Cash Flow\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\nGross Profit Margin\n\n**The Future**\n\nWith better customer retention than Intel, and gaining in CPU market share from 28% to 32% between 2018 and 2019, AMD is solidifying its name in the semiconductor space for retail consumers. Eventually, they hope to reach much larger markets in order to keep up with companies like Intel and Nvidia in this crowded space. AMD will have to take advantage of this upcoming AI revolution by investing in the software. Nvidia has already capitalized on this and created SaaS solutions for self-driving cars, a first step in cementing itself into the AI market. As AI will start to become more and more evident and used in big cities, the demand for these technologies will start to increase. AI will start becoming increasingly more complex, requiring better processing technologies to support the infrastructure. However, this AI revolution will not be (for the most part) centered in households and individual customers, but rather in cities and localities using AI to build so-called \u201csmart cities\u201d. AMD can use this to their advantage and strike deals with the city government, providing them with computer processors and other hardware to make it happen. To do this, AMD will need to look outside the gaming market and develop a processor more suited to power enormous amounts of data, which can be used in building the smart city infrastructure. One current option AMD has is to tap into the quantum computing world. Investing tons of cash into the research and development of an AMD quantum computer will benefit the company greatly and help them gain an edge over other competitors in the field. These quantum computers can work extremely fast and will ultimately be an x-factor in the overall composition of the smart city. Either way, the road ahead for AMD is certainly an interesting one and should be paid attention to.",

Not pump and dump. Both are planning to be listed in Nasdaq. Both are OTCQB, which means they are middle tier OTC stocks, not Pinksheet scammers.

Meaning, I compare recent volume, like the last 1 to 10 day volume with 30 to 60 day volume average. There are many tools for that. I use Tradingview screener and compare last daily volume or last 10 day's average volume with 30 or 60 day average. I also set the share price below $0.10  \nI do this because this shows me that there is some unusual movement in the stock lately. It works great for penny stocks since they have very little volume. So if some people knows something before everyone, their buys directly show up on the volume. \n\nThen I check each one of these to see if they made a run yet and try to understand their story by looking deeper into fundamentals like revenue, OS, past performance, dilution, events like offerings and RS, then website, management/team, products and clients, social media etc...\n\nThis is my filter settings in Tradingview. Dont think it's perfect, you should tinker with it and let me know if you find a more accurate setting. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img nvmupwqnznd61...*\n\n# How do I invest in a penny stock if I'm outside of the US?\n\nIf you're not in the USA and still want to buy penny stocks there are couple of options that might work for you.\n\n[http://interactivebrokers.com/](http://interactivebrokers.com/) (I have an account here but never traded.

As its filed in Nov 19. Nantahala capital purchased 67% of shares. I need help from friends who understand share structures better than me. This number is very high in my view, I'm having hard time to see if this is good, bad or neutral.\n\n[If they have all the shares, what do we have?](https://preview.redd.it/7yt1b1exgod61.png?width=903&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=67d35da06b6cacf6bc4c40a5a28637b0610202a3)\n\n# Time to compare the fundamentals of 3 stocks. \n\nI'd like to compare **IWSF** with **SSFT**, which I made a DD yesterday, another SaaS company in AI field and **AITX**, which looks like a Security and Robotics company but actually planning to monetize data and software services that they provide with their devices. I do this comparison to see if these two can reach AITX's massive rise in a similar fashion.  \n**AITX** made and still making, an increase that reached 13000% or 130x since December 1st.  \n**SSFT** which I did a DD yesterday and made over 50% run subsequently, that's a buy and hold.  \n**IWSF** our target for this DD\n\n# Outstanding shares: \n\nIf our 2.5 billion heavy weight AITX moved like a butterfly and AI prince SSFT is carrying 447 million shares what can you say about this tech princess that only has 131 million outstanding shares AND at the current price of 0.012?  I can't say how much of a gem this is in all the OTC.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/oyj1vgp0bjd61.png?width=1298&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=71df6894a48b46a2aad075aca1ebf72de8ad5633\n\n# Market Cap:\n\nIf you have that low of a share price and float your market cap is naturally miniscule. While AITX and recently SSFT is enlarging their caps IWSY is super modest, but not for so long...\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i77le087cjd61.png?width=1298&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d2bbd6d179bc875bbdecd5679b2d95e07254f124\n\n# Revenue:\n\nMy most favorite metric. There's a draw between SSFT and IWSY here while AITX is still unbelievably low in revenues. I'm sure it will go up soon. But what comes first? Revenue or Share Price? I say if your signal is Revenue you'll be safer. Otherwise you might just be blowing up a balloon.\n\n*Processing img rcwasx02djd61...*\n\n# Debt:\n\nDebt is secondary to revenue in importance. Because debt might come from certain expenses that are essential to generate more revenue. IWSY here is more in trouble than SSFT with almost 3x debt with similar revenue. But I need to dig deeper into this to understand where it came from. AITX debt is still like a mountain in contrast to their revenue but at least they got a leeway until late 2022 to pay them back and I think 8 million is not going to be a big number for them when the times comes.\n\n*Processing img 8lu2t6iufjd61...*\n\n# Gross Profit: \n\nGross profit is the difference between sales and the cost of goods sold. Revenues (aka Sales) less Cost of Goods Sold is a company's gross profit. Increasing gross profits are a good sign for a company (it means the company is generating money from sales).  Imageware is absolute winner here. I'd say software business is always more profitable than real goods sale but man IWSY here created a product that brings pure profits. Now compare this increase with the increase in share price and you'll understand why I'm so excited about this stock.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/31am543vjjd61.png?width=1291&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8b7119fa3dd8edfdff8df9687f233ed59b528b46\n\n# Total Operating Expenses:  \n\nTotal Operating Expense is the total expenses that are incurred over a given period of time as a result of normal business activities.   \nImageware CEO is doing an excellent job of lowering expenses while increasing revenue. This is a very strong indicator of a solid foundation. She's basically rising this company out of ashes. SSFT is also doing great in this department and AITX naturally needs to increase expenses to be able to scale up. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ngh8o2c3jjd61.png?width=1291&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7ebde179e511fb5b968c99a565285ed000f36f4e\n\n# Available Cash:\n\nNow this chart is not accurate because as I mentioned, ISWY did a special placement for $11.5 million in December and that's not accounted in here. But I still want to show for the sake of comparison. They have da cash.\n\n*Processing img gcwy0xfkkod61...*\n\n# Popularity:\n\nNo one knows. Really.

        "selftext": " \n\nAMD (Advanced Micro Devices) is a long for years to come as semiconductors start to completely dominate our world. The basic niche of the company is selling computer parts like CPUs,  microprocessors, motherboard chipsets, embedded graphics processors, and many others. As computers start to overtake our day to day tasks, AMD will be a key player in distributing the parts necessary for the globalized tech revolution. With the growing demand for computer parts and increased reliance on tech during the pandemic, the stock continues its bullish run from 2015 to the present day. \n\nAMD began in 1969 by Walter Sanders, a former executive at Fairchild Semiconductor, which was recently acquired in 2016 by ON semiconductor. AMD released its first product in 1970 and had its IPO two years later. Throughout the 1970s and until 1986, they were a second source computer chip manufacturer. These chips were supplied to Intel, which produced microprocessors for IBM PCs. In 1996, AMD began branching out of the second source market, and in 2000, it introduced the Athlon processor, which could run the Microsoft Windows Operating System. With this release, AMD became the first company to produce a 1 gigahertz microprocessor, cementing itself as a serious player in the chip sector. \n\nIt\u2019s safe to say that AMD has lived up to their potential since the 2000 tech bubble burst. Today, the tech giant has expanded beyond measure. They are not just second-source anymore; now regular consumers have access to their variety of products, which include computer processors, motherboards, and most recently, a GPU (graphics processing unit). Among their most successful items is the AMD Ryzen, a vast lineup of around 15 CPUs. The higher-powered CPUs appeal more to gamers while the lower end ones target average households and casual pc users. Included in the graphics processing unit lineup is the Radeon XT series, however, companies like NVIDIA hold the edge over AMD in this sector, as AMD specializes in CPUs. Overall, AMD has built a strong foundation and continues to be a mainstay company for gamers and computer enthusiasts alike. \n\nHowever, the future for AMD will not be easy. AMD is stationed in a sector filled with juggernauts such as Intel, NVIDIA, and Qualcomm. These companies have also taken major strides during this pandemic, with NVIDIA acquiring microchip company ARM, finally entering into the CPU business and Intel rolling out its extremely powerful 10th gen processor series known as Ice Lake in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic. It\u2019s safe to say that for AMD to come on top in this heavily occupied sector, it will have to cause a serious market disruption with a new product or software announcement. With many new products and acquisitions speculated to be happening soon, there is a tremendous opportunity for AMD to gain separation over its other competitors and develop something completely revolutionary. There are two main things I will discuss here: the finances of AMD and current growth, and the future forecast for the company\u2019s operations.\n\nWith that, let\u2019s take a quick dive into AMD\u2019s financials and compare them to some of AMD\u2019s competitors.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img fofnabr323e61...*\n\nCash was decreasing from 2016 to 2018 until seeing an increase in 2019. However, if you look at the total debt for AMD, this starts to make sense. The debt was decreasing as well, and the most likely cause was that the company was using some of its cash to pay it off. On top of this other assets for AMD increased which increased its current ratio. More specifically non-current assets (long term investments) increased by 40% from 2018 to 2019, which is far above the previous 10% increase in long term assets. This signifies AMD\u2019s commitment to their product and confidence in their ability as they reinvested into their core product. Overall, the cash to debt ratio in 2019 is beyond excellent, seeing a significant jump in cash from 2018, and seeing a gigantic plummet in total debt when compared to 2018. This ratio is definitely an eye-popping stat for skeptical investors.  However, it must be noted that the total current liabilities have increased quite a bit since 2018.  AMD has also seen constant growth in shareholder\u2019s equity, which indicates that AMD had to raise more capital in order to tackle some larger ventures and in exchange for that they issued more common stock. This can dilute existing shareholders and it\u2019ll probably continue to happen if AMD follows its current growth trajectory, which will require even more financing. \n\n[Shares Outstanding](https://preview.redd.it/e1gg15f623e61.png?width=786&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=08f9318f1828228ec82b164bdca438d4ac892aaa)\n\nAbove are the shares outstanding for the company (Macrotrends.net). Despite increasing equity financing recently, the stock has only gone up since as return on equity was sufficient to not scare away shareholders. This is an extremely good sign, as normally if the shares outstanding metric sees significant growth, the stock price becomes diluted because the additional amount of shares may decrease the overall value of the share for the other investors\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Income Statement](https://preview.redd.it/v8g74so823e61.png?width=843&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5494365cc6470c4bd15f479a97a8eebb92189ba5)\n\nTaking a quick look into AMD\u2019s income statement, we can see that the revenue growth was gaining magnificent momentum until last year, where it plateaued. The same case is with net income; we saw substantial growth in net income from 2016-2018, however, the growth shrank after that. Clearly the largest growth and most prosperous period for the company was from 2017 to the start of 2019, where the revenue grew 28%, and not coincidentally, the stock rose 70% growth in the 2018 fiscal year (Forbes). EBITDA has also seen some good growth from 2017-2019. However, the drastic slowdown in growth might raise an eye to some investors. For example, the revenue grew 18% from 2017 to 2018 but grew a measly 3% the following year. This plateau is most evident in the EBITDA value. The EBITDA value rose 58% from 2017 to 2018 and slowed down to 13% growth from 2018 to 2019. This slowdown could be attributed to less inventory being sold in 2019 than in 2018, and the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry. Regardless of revenues, AMD has consistently spent \u2154 of OpEx on R&amp;D for its latest chipsets. This inherently makes it an unstable business, and the risk factors here are numerous (as they were with Nvidia which has also seen several swings in prices in the past). Regardless of this, fundamentals for the company still remain strong as CPU demand isn\u2019t expected to go anywhere. That\u2019s why despite the revenue growth slowing down in 2019, the share price continued to rocket, because the semiconductor industry has a certain pattern that didn\u2019t phase any experienced investors. AMD is likely working on the next generation of chips that\u2019ll continue to pull them up sales-wise. \n\n[Cash Per Share](https://preview.redd.it/s6tbr3ya23e61.png?width=763&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7031ca48a6eb2faafb56c3e443a69d8a233218b8)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img 102l4xuc23e61...*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Gross Profit Margin](https://preview.redd.it/8mlix6te23e61.png?width=583&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cc4fe9fce6a59328ca38f51a246498c093c15fd1)\n\n**The Future**\n\nWith better customer retention than Intel, and gaining in CPU market share from 28% to 32% between 2018 and 2019, AMD is solidifying its name in the semiconductor space for retail consumers. Eventually they hope to reach much larger markets in order to keep up with companies like Intel and Nvidia in this crowded space. AMD will have to take advantage of this upcoming AI revolution by investing into software. Nvidia has already capitalized on this and created SaaS solutions for self driving cars, a first step in cementing itself into the AI market. As AI will start to become more and more evident and used in big cities, the demand for these technologies will start to increase. AI will start becoming increasingly more complex, requiring better processing technologies to support the infrastructure. However, this AI revolution will not be (for the most part) centered in households and individual customers, but rather in cities and localities using AI to build so-called \u201csmart cities\u201d. AMD can use this to their advantage and strike deals with city government, providing them with computer processors and other hardware to make it happen. To do this, AMD will need to look outside the gaming market and develop a processor more suited to power enormous amounts of data, which can be used in building the smart city infrastructure. One current option AMD has is to tap into the quantum computing world. Investing tons of cash into research and development of a AMD quantum computer will benefit the company greatly and help them gain an edge over other competitors in the field. These quantum computers can work extremely fast and will ultimately be an x factor in the overall composition of the smart city. Either way, the road ahead for AMD is certainly an interesting one and should be paid attention to.",

        "selftext": "AMD is reporting their Q4 2020 results on the 26th. As a long-term investor and given all the events in the past months I believe AMD is still undervalued at $90. I\u2019ve made a previous [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AMD_Stock/comments/kwfxp7/amd_still_undervalued_at_95/) about this but there was some news last week which I incorporated in here is well.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Intel struggles**\n\nLast week Intel has announced that they will replace Bob Swan with Pat Gelsinger as their CEO. This has led to Intel stock going up 13% and AMD dropping 5-6%. Intel is trading above(!) above the stock price they were when they announced the delays in 7nm/5nm. I think this reaction is severely overdone. Note that Pat used to be CTO at Intel for many years and is not the fresh blood they need to turn this colossal company around. Also in the time he was CEO of VMware (since 2012) the stock only rose 60% which is not a great performance comparing it to competitors. Intel has already announced their Q4 ER will beat estimates but that was a given. The only thing that is relevant is their outlook, which is still going to be meager since a CEO impact the company over years time (see AMD themselves) . AMD popped 12% on Intel Q2 report when they first announced their delays. We could see something similar if Intel gives a weak guidance for the coming year(s)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**AMD Q4 and FY**\n\nEPS Q4 consensus estimate is 0.47 with a range between 0.43 to 0.58. I believe revenue will be higher than expected, mainly due to the huge demand in the console market (PS5/Xbox) but also the PC/notebook market in general since half of the world was in (semi) lockdown for some parts of Q3/Q4. The main thing I am hoping for is that profit margin stays (roughly) the same at 44%, even though margins on consoles are very thin. If they manage to maintain a margin above 40%, EPS could end up 0.55, which would be a 360% increase with respect to Q4 2019 and 280% year on year. That would be very impressive, given the fact that AMD is considered to still be in their growth stage.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**2021&amp;2022 Outlook**\n\nBut the main thing to look out for is the guidance for the coming years. Given the continuing lockdowns, the fact that all the market segments they are in (consoles/PC\u2019s/laptops/servers) are booming and the fact that they have GPU\u2019s that can go head to head with NVDA\u2019s I think they could raise their outlook for the coming year as well as 2022. Especially when the Xilinx merger goes trough and they have an increased TAM (total Accessible Market). Estimated EPS for the coming years are 1.83 and 2.42 but with all the mentioned tailwinds EPS targets of 2.00+ and 2.75 are not crazy. This would imply P/E\u2019s off 34 for 2022 which is lower than ASML\u2019s for example (50). Hence a stock price of 105-115 is a fair target in the short term and 137,50-145 as a long-term target.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Booming Market**\n\nFinally, we have been in the biggest bull market in a long time, mainly driven by central bank money. Biden is planning a 2.8T stimulus package in the coming weeks. The rising tide has lifted all boats, leading to insane PE valuations across the markets (Lemonade trading at 150x FORWARD P/E for example). A forward PE of 34 for AMD is a way better bet in my opinion.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPosition:\n\n2750 shares, 5000 LT warrants, 200 29Jan\u201921 100Calls.",

        "selftext": "I created an algo that scans the most popular trading sub-reddits and logs the tickers mentioned in due-diligence or discussion-styled posts. Instead of scanning for how many times each ticker was mentioned in a comment, I logged how popular the post was among the sub-reddit. Essentially if it makes it to the 'hot' page, regardless of the subreddit, then it will most likely be on this list. There are two parts to this post. The first is for posts that were submitted in the most active trading sub-reddits (such as this one), and the second part has the most mentioned tickers from the WSB sub-reddit.\n\n**How is \"Hype\" calculated?**\n\nWell, this is a little tricky but it's based on the engagement that the post received in that sub-reddit relative to other posts in the same sub-reddit\n\n**How can I use this list?**\n\nThe best way to use this data is to learn about new tickers that might be trending. As an example, I probably would have never known about the ARK etfs, or even Palantir, until they started trending on Reddit. This gives many people an opportunity to learn about these stocks and decide if they want to invest in them or not. The data on this list is limited to one post per ticker. I've taken the most 'popular' post for that ticker on whichever sub-reddit it may have been. What I've found is that normally if tickers begin to trend on one sub-reddit then generally-speaking there will be posts for the same ticker on various other sub-reddits.

        "selftext": "Prepare for a very lengthy post. **I have worked my ASS off on this**.  Fair warning, this post is an update for my Nokia idea on TradingView,  so when I refer to Reddit/WSB I am talking to you guys as if you are  looking at it from my TradingView idea. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSince my original ideas on TV and social media, there have been quite a few very interesting developments. For once, I'm not going to do just chart analysis. I am also adding a large amount of due diligence regarding options activity, social media activity, news articles, and comparisons against competitors. Financials are something I am still struggling to learn but hopefully will eventually get there. As far as financials are concerned, I do know that their revenue is down overall but their profit margins have increased. As far as revenue is concerned, Nokia has been acquiring a large amount of contracts lately in the 5G sector. Nokia also has a very good debt to asset ratio when compared against pretty much the entire industry they're attempting to capture market share in.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis will start off with some regular old chart analysis. Support and resistance levels, and candlestick and RSI analysis. Bollinger Bands are self explanitory for the most part.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLet us start with a crucial RSI trend I discovered on the 2 month time frame.\n\nSpanning from 2006, there has been a consistent trend of attempted breakouts upwards and above 50 RSI. Each breakout has been a lower high thus far. Currently, Nokia is contending with this 2 month RSI trend line for the 7th time. This is a MAJOR area of confluence when combined with MA's, Fib retracement levels, and reactions in candlesticks.\n\n*Processing img xuobh6uor6c61...*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn the monthly, we can see that this trend line coincided with a major selloff in October of 2019. This selloff was caused by a bad earnings report on 10/24/2019. Earnings were estimated to be $0.05 but reported $0.01 which had a -69.42% surprise of -$0.04. Prior to this, the month of August broke down below this trend line. During the month of September, Nokia attempted to rally back above it on low volume. The local support level it was testing at $5.18 or the 0.5 Fib retracement flipped to resistance and caused a 27.87% drop after the bad earnings report. It was not until the month of June 2020 that Nokia was able to get back above this trend line. 2 months later, Nokia tested that same resistance level and was able to get above 50 RSI, but was strongly rejected. This rejection dropped Nokia back below the RSI trend line, but it was able to hold support at 40 RSI. The month of November 2020 however had a bullish engulfing candle to bring Nokia back above the trend line. Then the month of October 2020 had low sell volume and thus held as support. For this particular trend line, support has not been tested successfully like this since July of 2018. Note however, that the mid line of the bollinger bands is so far holding as resistance.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNotice the giant bearish hammer the lower arrow is pointing to. That was the market-wide covid selloff of March 2020 and it closed directly at the 0.786 Fib retracement. There was strong bullish support residing at the 0.886 Fib retracement which not only caused the large wick, but strongly pushed Nokia back up and into the 20 year trend line zone of support. Since December of 2017, Nokia's price movement has been unable to close a monthly candle below this trend line. In October of 2020, Nokia once again successfully tested the 0.786 Fib retracement for support which coincided perfectly with the 20 year trend line and a diagonal trend line breakout.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/giukvukpr6c61.png?width=1930&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=613407c999d8e004c84d2943f562a04ef3ade19c\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe 2 month trend line also translates very well to the daily, where we can see that Nokia has successfully tested this trend line multiple times for support throughout 2020.\n\nSince 12/21/2020, Nokia has so far successfully tested this support on this time frame. According to the trend, this \\*should\\* produce at least some upwards movement to test local resistance levels. Namely, the 0.618 Fib level at $4.34.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yad5hm4qr6c61.png?width=1930&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b681b860cd1ad96f5260dcbd921187bfb59c1ba1\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAccording to the 3 month time frame, Nokia has \\*serious\\* support below the $tree fiddy price point, and 40 RSI. The October 2016 3 month candle tested 40 RSI and had a fairly strong bounce. Then a year later, same thing. From that point forward, this zone was not tested until the negative October 2019 earnings report pushed Nokia well below it. Then in April 2020, Nokia had a high volume bullish engulfing candle that brought the RSI back above 40 but was rejected at the 0.618 Fib retracement. After that 3 month candle closed in July, Nokia spent the next 6 months testing support. Bears were unable to close the next 2 candles below 40 RSI AND the 20 year trend line. The October 2020 3 month candle closed as a long legged doji on high volume indicating strong buyer support. This is a multitude of confluence that shows for the next 3 months at least, Nokia should have strong buying support.\n\n*Processing img tfl8spoqr6c61...*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow is time for perhaps one of the most interesting clues as far as Nokia's price action, the 6 month time frame.\n\nThe 6 month candle starting on January 2nd, 2020 is one of the strongest indicators that Nokia is soon to have some serious volatility.\n\nIt closed as a bullish hammer with very long tail and short upper shadow. This indicates buying support stepped in and held the line in a big way towards the end of the candle close. Volumes for this candle are the highest they have been since the giant hulk dildo starting in July of 2013.\n\nThe very next candle after this bullish hammer was a bearish spinning top doji- but was able to close WITHIN the body of the bullish hammer. This type of doji can indicate the beginning of a shift in sentiment, or a 'pause'. This 'pause' does sometimes precede a resumption of the prior trend. Considering the volumes in these 2 candles, Nokia is likely to experience serious volatility over the next 6 months. It is a very good sign though in my opinion that this doji candle closed within the body of the bullish hammer. The RSI however is pointing out a break of support, and subsequent confirmation of resistance. Nokia needs to break back above 45 RSI on this time frame in order to establish strong bullish bias.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mzv9hb6rr6c61.png?width=1930&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a9d86440e0fba694083f58982c61ee810a8b79a7\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*TLDR: Support is hodling but this is arguably the most important zone to decide Nokia's short, mid, and long term fate.\n\nImmediate support levels: $3.80, $3.70, $3.50.\n\nLower support levels: $3.15, $2.44, and ALL-IN anything below that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nImmediate resistance levels: $4.30, $4.50, $5.\n\nHigher resistance levels: $5.18, $6, $7.50.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n\\- 1/21/22 Leap options activity -\n\n\\- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - \n\nI happened to find a website to check historical data on options volumes and open interest. The position I currently hold are $7 call contracts expiring on 1/21/2022, so I decided to take a look at the data for them.\n\nI also checked the $10 call contracts with the same expiration as they currently have what seems to be the largest amount of open interest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is a short term screenshot of the volumes and open interest for the $7 call.\n\nBetween the end of December and January 4th, there were very slight fluctuations in the open interest, yet the volumes traded were above average.\n\nNote that on January 5th and 6th, the volumes skyrocketed while open interest decreased. Strange considering the premium price of the options were on a slight upwards trend from that date. After January 6th, however, the the volume was mostly flat/average while the open interest significantly increased. January 15th, open interest skyrocketed. Interesting to note that this increase came after a significantly high volume day in shares.\n\n*Processing img 7rh35wbtr6c61...*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is a longer term screenshot of the volumes and open interest for the $7 call. Unfortunately, without paying for a subscription this website only allows you to see historical data spanning roughly 3 months.\n\nStill, this screenshot shows multiple significant trends in the options for this particular contract.\n\nThe first thing that obviously catches the eye is the enormous volume and drop in option premium price/open interest that happened right before November. On October 29th, Nokia released an earnings report. This particular report showed an expected earnings per share of $0.06, but the actual reported earnings per share were $0.04, which was a surprise of -$0.02 or -36.37%. As of the opening bell for trading, Nokia dropped by 18.99% in 1 hour, eventually bottoming out at $3.21 a few hours later after a 20.72% decline in share price. After this 'cleanse', the $7 call option mostly traded flat for another 12 days thereafter. On the 13th day, open interest began rising again. Currently, Nokia's $7 call 1/21/22 contract has an open interest of roughly 135,000 contracts.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vy82mmstr6c61.png?width=720&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c37840bae667ba18c238536ad190d79240daaf38\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is a short term screenshot of the volumes and open interest for the $10 call.\n\nUnlike the strange activity in the $7 call, the overall trend for the open interest in the $10 call has only been upwards since the 17th of December onwards. Volumes have mostly been flat up until the 14th when Nokia had a very high volume day in shares. Otherwise, open interest and volumes in this contract have not had anything major to really report on other than a steady increase in open interest.\n\n*Processing img 0mk1qbsur6c61...*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is a longer term screenshot of the volumes and open interest for the $10 call.\n\nThis screenshot is quite interesting. There have been multiple high volume days for this option, but the one that specifically stands out was when the contract bottomed out at $0.08. From that point forward, open interest and volumes remained relatively flat. Notice that in the latter part of November, the high volume days preceeded a significant decline in the option premium price. From the peak option price premium of \\~$0.16 however, the open interest only increased unlike what happened with the $7 call option on October 29th for earnings. The highest volume days for this contract in the timeline that I have to work with were, interestingly, the 14th and the 15th. This could signal another significant decline in premium price, or it could be a signal that Nokia's share price may be in the beginning stages of a rally. Considering historical data, history indicates that this \\*\\*should\\*\\* unfortunately be a signal for a drop in premium price. Whales love to mess with the noobs.\n\n*Processing img jx75xh8vr6c61...*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is a screenshot that represents the grand total of all options traded versus share price.\n\nFor months, the options volume and stock volume have remained relatively flat until the 14th and 15th.\n\nImplied volatility as well as volumes are signaling there is likely to be a major move within the next few trading sessions.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ua8dxbkxr6c61.png?width=720&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=228aa40f5f450f8a1fb76cc0c94052c50dbdcd90\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*TLDR: Options Open Interest is skyrocketing. $7c has weird stuff going on but $10c is stronger than a held-in beer fart.\n\nOn the other hand, the amount of open interest in the $7 and $10 calls could very easily be used to create significant bearish options pressure.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n\\- 1/20/23 Leap options activity -\n\n\\- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - \n\nFor these particular calls, the images are self-explanitory when compared to above.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is a short term screenshot of the volumes and open interest for the $5 call.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d4inx3yyr6c61.png?width=720&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=594b3e7e3b7334f3178203e08133c0d0aa1a3860\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is a longer term screenshot of the volumes and open interest for the $5 call.\n\n*Processing img 524vekezr6c61...*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is a short term screenshot of the volumes and open interest for the $7 call.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ueawqh70s6c61.png?width=720&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fa7fe291df444f7e8e885797287ba0178f3ed97e\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is a long term screenshot of the volumes and open interest for the $7 call.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/l26jg2n0s6c61.png?width=720&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cd99cfe58aa0f22de9857580cabc506c5931713e\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - \n\n\\- News -\n\n\\- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - \n\nKinda serious.\n\nT-Mobile announces 5 year, \"multi-billion dollar agreement\" with both Nokia and Ericsson.\n\n\"These multi-billion-dollar deals with both Ericsson and Nokia will continue to supercharge T-Mobile\u2019s nationwide 5G network.\"\n\n[https://www.t-mobile.com/news/network/5g-best-coverage-ericsson-nokia](https://www.t-mobile.com/news/network/5g-best-coverage-ericsson-nokia)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen shit does get serious.

What angle am I getting at? H Y P E. How do you create serious hype/FOMO for a stock in todays world? It needs some sort of 'reputation'. A very negative one is best. Why?\n\nNokia is known for having a giant outstanding share supply. They're known for being in a decades long downtrend. They're known for not being worth investing in, plain and simple.\n\nSo, back to human behavior. If you look back at the past year ish or so of comments on social media regarding Nokia, the stock has built quite the negative reputation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou NEVER hear about Nokia. You never see it in the news. You never hear its name anymore other than when people reminisce of the good old days- where products were ackshually built to last!\n\nYou don't see the Nokia brand anywhere anymore.. Its name doesn't show up on TV, or in the newspaper, or on ticker news feeds, nothing. Nowhere. Nada. Zilch.\n\nWhat would happen if, say, Nokia suddenly had a +50% day out of nowhere? EVERYONE who ever doubted Nokia or even heard their name are quickly reminded that they are still alive.\n\nThese people are seemingly  so brainwashed at this point that Nokia is not a worthwhile investment, they don't even bother. Even though it just rocketed 50%. Meh, just a dead cat bounce. \n\nNah, they'll stay out and chase their gains in PLTR or GME or BB or whatever the current meme stocks are for the day.\n\nNext day, Nokia rockets again while maybe other meme/blue chip stocks and/or indexes are flat or negative. See where I'm going with this here?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTHE very M O M E N T Nokia rips a hulk dildo on the chart, everyone and their mother is going to know about it.\n\nMeh, just a dead cat bounce. Right guys? ...Right?\n\nThen it goes up. Again. While a lot of people including I/you were waiting for a pullback.\n\nSee where I'm going with this here?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSTRICTLY because of Nokia's reputation and the extreme negative sentiment surrounding it in Social Media, this is a perfect play.\n\nWhen it finally rips loose, everyone and their brother is going to be waiting for a pullback. What if it doesn't come soon enough?\n\nImagine the FOMO.\n\nA multi decade long downtrend is clearly reversing. You can see it in the chart, trend lines, and in the sentiment.

Nokia has a market cap currently of $22.1B.\n\nThat means when you multiply the total supply of tradable shares to how much money they each are trading for, you get the total overall valuation of a company.\n\nThe majority opinion everywhere on Nokia above all else, is that it cannot move due to its float size. Essentially, people are arguing that you'd need to buy substantially more shares\n\nin order to move the price than you would a different company. While this is generally true, the AMOUNT OF MONEY TRADED STAYS THE SAME.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo give you an idea of why the float doesn't matter, we can compare Nokia's market cap to the market cap sizes and share values of other competitors.\n\nFirst example I will use is Ericsson. Ericsson has a market cap of $36.13B. Their share price is currently $11.76. Now, again, think about the MONEY, not the shares.\n\nSay I wanted to invest $100 in a given stock. I could buy 8.5 shares in total of Ericsson. Or, I could get 24.5 shares of Nokia for THE SAME AMOUNT OF MONEY.\n\nWhat sounds more appealing to you? Owning 8.5 shares in a company, or nearly 3 times as much?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo let's compare market cap sizes with a few competitors to see just how much growth potential Nokia truly has.\n\nWe will just use the major companies listed alongside Nokia on the U.S. Federal 5G Cybersecurity Project.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAT&amp;T\n\nMarket cap: $207.87B\n\nShare price: $29.17\n\nFloat: 7.13B\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCisco\n\nMarket cap: $191.97B\n\nShare price: $45.43\n\nFloat: 4.22B\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDell\n\nMarket cap: $55.68B\n\nShare price: $74.26\n\nFloat: 0.77B\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIntel\n\nMarket cap: $235.96B\n\nShare price: $57.58\n\nFloat: 4.1B\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nT-Mobile\n\nMarket cap: $157.98B\n\nShare price: $127.28\n\nFloat: 1.24B\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThese figures show the valuation that Nokia can and will eventually hit.\n\nThe only real negative effect of having 5.6 billion outstanding shares is that it can take a while for them to become more widely dispersed rather than overconcentrated.\n\nMeaning a very select few absurdly rich people can and have been suppressing the price. The more they do it though, the more insane opportunities it gives you. That's the entire point.\n\nSo, in a way, float does matter, but that is EXACTLY WHY this is such a winning proposition. The more shares WE buy, the less THEY have and can control.\n\n \n\nanddd, I'm done. Finally. This is my  very last update regarding Nokia until $0.20 is no longer a gigantic  movement.\n\nShoutout to John. I just wanna help people too. Seems like I'm apparently doing it wrong but idk.\n\n**DISCLAIMER:  I am not a financial advisor. What is written in its entirety in this  idea is my opinion - specifically, MY thoughts on a chart.

        "selftext": "* The market opened slightly red but quickly reversed because JPow realized this was no way to start a New Year, with Chadsdaq and S&amp;P being propelled to green status thanks to Tim Apple and gang. DOW got further lifted by action from BA, GS, CVX, and INTC (who's really only being carried by MU). Small caps eclipsed SPX and IXIC today with RUT/IWM up as high as almost 2% during intraday high as value play starts looking more appealing. RUT closed up 1.7% and IWM closed up 1.61%.\n\n* \"I'm totes not dead.\" Says Jack Ma, according to a person familiar with the situation who's relaying the info to a CNBC  reporter on Ma's whereabouts. The beleaguered CEO who's in the crosshair of the CCP is keeping it easy and out of the limelight after running afoul of his overlords by talking up CCP's heavy handed action towards Ant Group. Who knew if your fucking financial empire touches the livelihood of 90% of the country there may be consequences if you don't toe the line. BABA closed the day up 5.51% to $240. Meanwhile, PDD touches new ATH and closed the day up 12.24% to $187 while JD is up 10.61% to $95.\n\n* The Chinese ADR/ADS sector gets a lift today partly thanks to NYSE's overnight about-face on delisting Chinese Telecoms. BILI hits new ATH and closed up 8.15% to $102.46 thanks to favorable reception from their secondary listing on the Heng Sheng\n\n* Semi sector is on a run today thanks to MU, with Citi upping, NAND and DRAM manufacturer from Sell all the way up to Buy with a PT of freaking $100 as we enter another cyclical season. RBC Capital also raised PT from $57 to $83, Deutsche Bank from $75 to $83. Will MU $90 be back in favor and no longer a meme strike? Find out later this week. F in the chat for MartyMoho. If only he bought fooking shares and ride through two more additional cyclical season and a global pandemic. Ez dub. MU closed up 4.33% to $77, LRCX closed up 3.46% to $494, and AMAT closed up 3% to $89. MU reports earnings this Thursday after market close.\n\n* GM pop 2% when news broke at 10:29 on positive US sales number from Q4, while shares were fading slightly as the market digest the news, eventually the positive momentum took over and shares closed the day up 2.84% to $41.66. ROKU pop to close up 5.44%, closing at $335 thanks to WFC analyst raising PT from $275 to $414 (yep) and keeping his overweight rating. \n\n* Today's big movers: FUBO was up as high as 21%, M-A-R-A was up as high 23% while B-N-G-O drilled more than -30% during intraday lows after an initial halt in the early mornings. FUBO closed up 12.83% to $27.35, M-A-R-A closed up 23.43% to $13.59, and B-N-G-O closed down -31.25% to $4.95.\n\n* The GA run-off election is on the market mindset as voters are heading to the polls. Meanwhile, Congress is set to confirm Biden's win over Trump, a procedural formality that generally receives little news coverage but not in the current timeline. Expect POTUS to rage over Pence on Twitter later tonight if the latter confirms Biden's Electoral College win. Look to weed and clean energy sector for pops if the Dems somehow wins both seat. No doubt many WSBer have already loaded up on FDs to showcase the sick gains porn tomorrow if the magic happens.\n\n* In WSB meme stock land, PLTR is up more than 5% but those with OTM Jan 15 calls are likely having their ass handed to them by the greeks, while a similar story exist over at GME as the stock fades away morning gain to close the day up 0.70% as theta rampage $20c, $22c, and $23c (if your strike is even further out then RIP to you). MT and steel gang are faring better, with the stock retaking yesterday's high and closed up 2.84% to 24.63. Steel prices continues to rip and earnings will be early next month on Feb 11th.\n\n* The DOW closed up 167 pts to 0.55%, Nasdaq up 120 pts to 0.95%, S&amp;P up 26 pts to 0.71%, and RUT closed up 33 pts to 1.71%.

VMW has traded side ways for the last 52 weeks! (wtf)\n\nJust days ago AMD hit an all time high of $99, today it's at $90. \nI'm sure some of you remember the massive rocket ship \ud83d\ude80 SuBae gave us back when everyone was praying to her before their mother tucked them in at night. Well, it's time to start dreaming of Dr. Lisa Su again because the only place AMD is going IS UP until at least until 2024. While Intel are crying about getting hulk smashed by SuBae, AMD keeps stealing massive market share, and the corona has increased the need for computers so much that TSM (the foundry who makes the chips for AMD) are at max capacity and will be for several years. The only other company that can compete with TSM is Samsung who are also at max capacity. Meanwhile, Intel's fabs are several years behind.\n\nI know you guys don't like to read so here's the CliffsNotes version:\n\n* AMD growing at rocket speed\ud83d\ude80\n\n* 20% of server market by EOY (Currently at 10%, up from 1% 2 years ago)\n\n* Notebook market share growing by 50% (Lisa just announced this at CES a few days ago)\n\n* Most products are constantly sold out - just look at all the people crying over at r/AMD and all those people that still can't buy PS5's. \n\n* AMD powers both XBOX and PS. PS5 sales topped 3.4 million units in the first 4 weeks. Sony has had to increase production by 50%!\n\n* TSM are trying to build new fabs asap to increase production of CPU's - Today they reported a 23% increase in profits.\n\n* PC shipments climb 13% in 2020, marking highest increase in a decade.\n \n* The gaming PC market is set to grow 25% by 2024\n\n* Intel's competitive advantage (their own fabs) is so useless that they are trying to buy space at the already full TSM fab. \n\n* Intel are 2-3 years behind AMD. \n\n* r/intel = 205,452 users, r/amd = 765,440 (hmmmmmm)\n\n* Lisa Su always delivers the promised numbers every quarter \n\nOh yeah, and mad lad **CRAMER** [just told everyone to load up during this buying opportunity.](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/13/intel-shakeup-creates-buying-opportunity-in-amd-jim-cramer-says.html)\n\nRight now the boomers who don't understand the PC market are shorting AMD and buying up Intel just because it's the only name the recognise from the dinosaur age. These are the same losers who just got wrecked by GME. Let's show these fools again. **Stop letting boomers control the OG WSB rocket ship!**\n\n**TL;DR -** AMD is an undervalued sleeping giant currently on sale. Most analysts predict $110, some $120.

He was the king of short term short sighted leadership. \n\nHe kept bailing ship right before companies would crash, like GE Financial, HP computers, Northrop, and eBay. But because he bailed on top, Boomers gave him credit for the rise, but not the fall. \n\nBoomers completely ignored how many companies he tanked. \n\nWell, he didnt bail from Intel quickly enough and they tanked 60 BILLION because he failed to develop new products. Instead tried to send jobs overseas and undercut development of new products in order to pump short term earnings, exactly like he did at his previous companies. This let AMD take the lead, and destroyed Intel stock. \n\nIt is incredible that Boomers failed to notice that nearly every company Bob Swan lead crashed right after he left. \n\nGood riddance.",

        "selftext": "Alright, as promised in some comments last night I\u2019ll give you retards some buy sentiment for Palantir.\n\nWHO AM I AND WHY GIVE A FUCK\n\nI am a big tendie eating retard that works military intelligence for the Marine Corps, I worked Palantir before they stopped funding. (Don\u2019t let that scare you). I bought in day one around lunch, if you wanna see DM me and I\u2019ll provide receipts. Additionally I\u2019m now 135 shares in and opened 5 call contracts.\n\nMilitary use of the program is simply not  \u201cspying on you\u201d bullshit they\u2019d have you eat up on the \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b articles that cause our tendie machine to slow down. In fact military intelligence is legally prevented from conducting intelligence on US Persons. I can\u2019t speak for other actors in the Intel community but it\u2019s expressly forbidden on my end. Palantir doesn\u2019t enable us to spy on you, but it allows for us to compile data and speed high level decision making up at a rate that was simply beyond expectations previous to utilizing it. What does that mean? Well for one, if you provide military organizations with success in \u2018killing bad dudes\u2019 then they\u2019ll always have you in their pocket. I say if your taxpayer dollars are funding a program, you might as well double down and buy what you\u2019re already paying for. I wouldn\u2019t bet against a country that nuked another...twice. We can talk about Japan more later tho.\n\nCommercial use? The fucking cuck circus over at shitron fails to see that they\u2019re reliably and consistently expanding business. France, South America, Africa, JAPAN \ud83c\uddef\ud83c\uddf5 (should\u2019ve put Japan first but stuck with caps to provide a bit less of a smooth read for you autistic cunts.) I\u2019ll elaborate that. Japan has been historically tough for US companies to break through to, but Sompo and its associates are big Palantir and we shouldn\u2019t be taking that lightly. The uses for Palantir are unlimited and can greatly improve over time, with new products ie. Palantir Apollo. The market for data collected or data synthesis isn\u2019t ripe with competitive companies like the \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3bs would have you believe. Sure snowflake and other peers have similar mission but none have the same reach and same customer specific outreach and development cycle. I can\u2019t express enough how much of a buy this is.\n\nPalantir as a company. This is huge because it speaks volumes about where they could go. Palantir was operating shy of 20 yrs before their listing, and they\u2019ve been increasing the amount of \u2018news\u2019 on their site loading up on contracts all over the globe. Sure their operating losses are scary at first sight but they\u2019re dumping heavily into R&amp;D, building new SaaS as mentioned before and expanding heavily into the commercial market. Karp is the new Jobs, or even the next Alphabet CEO. Palantir is headed to household notoriety. Expect it, sooner than you can imagine it\u2019ll be everywhere, even Queen Cathie bought in. \n\nTL;DR \nI wear camo and hate life...but Cathie, Japan, and Biden are fucking fueling our little rocket, next stop, fucking Jupiter \n\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udcc8\ud83d\udcc8\ud83d\udcc8\ud83d\udc8e\ud83e\udd32\ud83d\udd95\ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b",

        "selftext": "Some of you may know me from my weekly SPAC Rundowns that I post over on [www.thespacinvestor.com](https://www.thespacinvestor.com) . While I do chase some exciting flavor of the week plays I find my best gains come from identifying a quality SPAC at IPO and buying in early. If you want to buy now into a SPAC that is going to be blowing up later instead of FOMOing into it after its already run up 100% I present to you **$PIPP**.\n\n**$PIPP** is the ticker for Pine Island Acquisition Corp. and it filed its S-1 on 9/23/20. The initial float was 34.5 million units consisting of 1 common and 1/3 of a warrant. Units split on January 6th with commons initially trading at $10.12 and warrants at $2.43. Commons are now trading in the mid-$12 range with warrants around $3.\n\nThe focus of **$PIPP** is defense, government service and aerospace businesses. I see this as both a positive and a negative. On the negative side a business in one of these areas is less likely to have a \"meme factor\" that drives a ton of retail interest (i.e. EV targets). \u00a0On the plus side you do not have a ton of SPACs working in this space so deal terms should be more favorable and companies in this space are more likely to have real and steady revenue.\n\n**$PIPP** has been nicknamed \"**the Biden SPAC**\" for its ties to high level incoming administration officials. When you see the team below you will see why.\n\nThe real focus for a pre-LOI SPAC is the quality of the team and board. This is where **$PIPP** really shines.\u00a0\n\nThe Chairman of **$PIPP** is **John Thain**\n\nJohn Thain has a BS from MIT and an MBA from Harvard. He was formerly the CEO of the New York Stock Exchange, the CEO of investment bank Merrill Lynch and the CEO of CIT Group.\n\nThe team includes:\n\n**Tony Blinken**\n\nLong time Democratic official and diplomat. He stepped down from the $PIPP team when Biden nominated him to be the next **Secretary of State.**\n\n**General Lloyd J. Austin III, Retired**\n\nRetired four star Army General and previous CENTCOM commander.

        "selftext": "I'm in tech and I have good news if you like money. Shorting Intel is too obvious I don't know. why options are so cheap to buy. \n\n**Why Intel is doomed**\n\nIntel have missed their own deadlines for delivering newer manufacturing methods and their CPUs are falling behind AMD in terms of cost and performance for a while. That is not the news. The stock is already hit by AMD performance. Intel is doomed because our industry is moving to Arm. Arm processors are performing way better at a fraction of cost. See [this report](https://www.anandtech.com/show/15578/cloud-clash-amazon-graviton2-arm-against-intel-and-amd/9) if you're not convinced. What I'm seeing in the industry is that a lot of cloud computing customers are finding it super easy to switch to Arm. Developer computers are mostly Macs and the M1 Macs are just the tip of the iceberg on what's going to happen. Once developers can easily develop on Arm machines, they most likely will deploy their code to an Arm cloud server. Amazon's AWS Graviton is performing well enough to switch. \n\n**Microsoft will kill Intel** \n\nApple is doing their part with M1 and Amazon is balls deep with their Arm chips but what makes a huge difference is Microsoft's energy for fucking intel in the ass by making Windows Arm friendly and pulling a fast one on Intel by developing their own chips. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TLDR**\n\nAmazon, Apple and Microsoft are going to gang bang Intel's wife.

        "selftext": "I don't know much, but I know tech and AMD has A LOT going for it right now.\n\n[*Obligatory do your own research and draw your own conclusions statement.*]\n\n**POSITIVES**\n\n- Both Sony and Microsoft are using custom AMD APUs in their latest consoles. (APU = CPU + GPU combined into one.) In case you've been living under a rock for the past 8 weeks, both the Playstation 5 and Xbox Series X have been selling like hotcakes, with fresh inventory being depleted within minutes. \n\n- AMD has been the underdog vs Intel in the consumer desktop CPU space for as long as I can remember. But for the first time in 15 years, [AMD is winning in terms of market share](https://www.techradar.com/news/amd-overtakes-intel-in-desktop-cpu-market-share-for-the-first-time-in-15-years). Intel has been able to stay competitive with their latest generation of CPUs by offering significant discounts. Despite this, AMD's CPUs still remain in higher demand and sell out almost instantly (at MSRP). \n\n- AMD owns Radeon, which is their brand of Graphics Cards. These compete directly with Nvidia's RTX GPUs. Performance wise, they're up there with NVDA, but still lagging a bit in the ray tracing department which most will agree is the future. Key word being future, it's not a big deal *yet*. And thanks to the pandemic these too also sell out super quick. \n\n- AMD's next generation of mobile CPUs will be launching soon. Just like their desktop lineup, you can expect these to outperform their Intel counterparts as well. AMD's previous mobile generation of 4000 series chips crushed Intel - the biggest problem was availability. People wanted the AMD chips but for whatever reason, they were found mostly in the mid-range and lower end gaming laptops. I expect the availability issue to improve greatly this year. As we can see, certain manufacturer's like Asus are already featuring the AMD SKUs in their [top of the line gaming laptops](https://www.notebookcheck.net/Asus-ROG-Strix-Scar-17-ditches-Comet-Lake-H-for-an-unlocked-Ryzen-9-5900HX-with-liquid-metal-and-RTX-3080-Mobile.514702.0.html). \n\n**RISK FACTORS**\n\n- While speaking purely from a monetary standpoint, overall I think the pandemic has been a net positive for tech companies like AMD. However, AMD's own fearless leader Lisa Su recently said: [\"...the COVID environment has increased shipping and freight costs, which are hard to avoid. As we get into a more normal environment, this should improve. This also matters for our planned graphics updates through the first half of the year, as we have a lot of product coming to market.\"](https://www.anandtech.com/show/16409/amd-ceo-dr-lisa-su-interview-on-2021-demand-supply-tariffs-xilinx-and-epyc)\n\n- Unable to keep up with demand: [AMD and NVIDIA confirm that GPU stock levels will remain non-existent for the foreseeable future](https://www.notebookcheck.net/AMD-and-NVIDIA-confirm-that-GPU-stock-levels-will-remain-non-existent-for-the-foreseeable-future.514957.0.html).\n[Microsoft has asked AMD for help in combating Xbox Series X stock shortages](https://www.techradar.com/news/microsoft-has-asked-amd-for-help-in-combating-xbox-series-x-stock-shortages)\n\n- Apple has already started producing their own in house ARM processors for both their laptops and desktops. This doesn't really affect AMD (yet) because [Apple has been using Intel chips in their laptops and desktops for the past 15 years.](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/10/why-apple-is-breaking-a-15-year-partnership-with-intel-on-its-macs-.html#:~:text=Menu-,Apple%20is%20breaking%20a%2015%2Dyear%20partnership%20with,on%20its%20Macs%20%E2%80%94%20here's%20why&amp;text=Apple's%20new%20laptops%20and%20desktop,can%20improve%20laptop%20battery%20life.) And despite being a massive company, Apple only makes up about [13% of the PC market share](https://www.statista.com/statistics/576473/united-states-quarterly-pc-shipment-shareapple/#:~:text=In%20the%20fourth%20quarter%20of,the%20fourth%20quarter%20of%202020.). AMD is still Apple's partner for discrete graphics, but that could change soon. This is definitely something you'll want to keep your eye on though because other titans like [Microsoft](https://www.reuters.com/article/microsoft-processors-int/microsoft-working-on-in-house-chips-for-its-servers-pcs-idUSKBN28S2Y1), [Google](https://www.digitalinformationworld.com/2020/04/google-is-making-its-own-chips.html), and Amazon are all either working on, or producing their own in house chips. In my opinion, this is not nearly as bad as it sounds. Let's break it down by company.\n\n - [Microsoft currently uses Intel-based processors for the majority of its Azure cloud services, and most of the company\u2019s Surface lineup run on Intel chips, too.](https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22189450/microsoft-arm-processors-chips-servers-surface-report#:~:text=Microsoft%20has%20worked%20with%20AMD,move%20away%20from%20just%20Intel.&amp;text=Microsoft%20co%2Dengineered%20an%20ARM,a%20couple%20of%20months%20ago.) Only some of Microsoft's laptops run on AMD hardware. \n\n - [Google is readying its own in-house processors for use in future Pixel devices, including both phones and eventually Chromebooks, too.](https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/14/google-said-to-be-preparing-its-own-chips-for-use-in-pixel-phones-and-chromebooks/?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAADHPvna5MKFbSAnwNIPsW4kMhD7zhe-7IJtk0AzQP1Rrer78Olm_S_019orsNcQA9Ezk_sCz0z8My1nHGdTap_0-SYZtHKs1U9v9ni-AGkuJzp3cOHYUDSEu7b90qMQIDsc-PC8tFFceJElhUcPhJ3ctKtatuQcLkrIF1VotSBz1#:~:text=The%20Axios%20report%20says%20that,machine%20learning%20and%20Google%20Assistant.) Again, because Google currently relies more on Intel CPUs this is not a big blow to AMD's bottom line. A quick check of BestBuy's inventory shows [47](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/searchpage.jsp?_dyncharset=UTF-8&amp;id=pcat17071&amp;iht=y&amp;keys=keys&amp;ks=960&amp;list=n&amp;qp=parent_processormodelsv_facet%3DProcessor%20Model~Intel%20Celeron%5Eparent_processormodelsv_facet%3DProcessor%20Model~Intel%20Core%20i3%5Eparent_processormodelsv_facet%3DProcessor%20Model~Intel%20Core%20i5%5Eparent_processormodelsv_facet%3DProcessor%20Model~Intel%20Core%20i7%5Eparent_processormodelsv_facet%3DProcessor%20Model~Intel%20Core%20m3%5Eparent_processormodelsv_facet%3DProcessor%20Model~Intel%20Core%20m7%5Eparent_processormodelsv_facet%3DProcessor%20Model~Intel%20Pentium&amp;sc=Global&amp;st=chromebook&amp;type=page&amp;usc=All%20Categories) Chromebooks with Intel SKUs and only [7 with AMD parts](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/searchpage.jsp?_dyncharset=UTF-8&amp;id=pcat17071&amp;iht=y&amp;keys=keys&amp;ks=960&amp;list=n&amp;qp=parent_processormodelsv_facet%3DProcessor%20Model~AMD%20A4%5Eparent_processormodelsv_facet%3DProcessor%20Model~AMD%20A6%5Eparent_processormodelsv_facet%3DProcessor%20Model~AMD%20Ryzen%203&amp;sc=Global&amp;st=chromebook&amp;type=page&amp;usc=All%20Categories).\n - The chips that Amazon is producing are for their [cloud computing business](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/01/technology/amazon-apple-chips-intel-arm.html). These were also replaced by Intel.\n\nAMD has earnings coming up on the 26th which I think they're going to shatter. I probably would not recommend trying to play off of that though as ERs can be quite unpredictable, especially if the news is positive. Personally, I think AMD is going to \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 after ER, but I'm not betting on that. Which is why my current position (30% of my portfolio) is LEAPS: (x2) Jan 2022 90c.\n\nMy conservative 6 month PT for AMD is 110. Also open to hearing any other potential risks I may have overlooked. To be on the safe side I'm only including 6 rockets.\n\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80",

        "selftext": "**GameStop short squeeze is ON! Alibaba continues to push into the EV world. Intel spikes while AMD &amp; TSM suffer. Let\u2019s talk about this and other stock market news!**\n\nHello everyone and Good Morning! So, let\u2019s start with the recap of yesterday as we saw the stock market finishing mixed, with the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/qybhmjC) gaining .43%, the [SP500](https://ibb.co/YL4XS6m) also gaining .23% while the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/YTFwLcx) lost just 8 points to close out the day. We also saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/0r28dsT) dropping almost 5% again, continuing the downtrend after that huge spike with the Georgia elections, as it sits at similar levels to the ones before Christmas.\n\nDespite the positive gains for the broad stock market SP500, [OVERALL](https://ibb.co/PrDh7DD), we saw about 57% of the companies declining yesterday, with most of them trading below average volumes, as the number of companies trading above the 50-day moving average still sits over 70%, which is pretty high. Yesterday we saw 6 of the 11 [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/wJH4B8C) finish in the green with Real Estate and Utilities posting gains of more than 1% while the laggards were Energy, Industrials and Materials, as we saw large-cap growth companies finally [OUTPERFORMED](https://ibb.co/kKtRY96) for once in 2021, with small &amp; mid-caps giving up some of the big gains they have posted in this short year, though, Large-Cap Growth companies are still underperforming by 3% compared to the next factor group in 2021.\n\nHere is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/Ms0qkCh) from yesterday, which shows pretty mixed results as expected, with most of the big tech companies posting small gains like Apple, Amazon, Google, Netflix and the rest of the bunch, with Alibaba posting a 4% gain after some EV news popped up and Intel also gaining almost 7% and pushed the rest of the Semiconductors down with TSM and AMD both down over 3%.\n\nWe also got a lot of economic data yesterday as the US [DEFICIT](https://ibb.co/QXXDBrc) fell by $2B to $143B in December compared to the previous month, but is up 10 fold from the $13B deficit from the same period in 2019, and this doesn\u2019t even include any of the $900B stimulus packaged that passed late in December, while the December consumer price [INDEX](https://ibb.co/n1Jr9G2) increased by 0.4% m/m and Core CPI also increase by 0.1%, coming in-line with expectations, as the Atlanta FED business inflation expectations [ROSE](https://ibb.co/t2v98jw) to 2.2% in January compared to December, though sales and profit margins compared to normal, decreased since the last month, while one of the FED\u2019s Vice Chairs [RESTATED](https://ibb.co/WtNxQKM) that the FED won\u2019t raise rates until the average long-term inflation stands at 2% for a year.\n\n[Today](https://ibb.co/C79879d) we get lots of important economic data with Jobless numbers in the early morning, which are expected to come around the same numbers as the previous week and end with the Money Supply and FED Balance Sheet while the stock market will also turn its eyes to see what the FED Leader Powell announces in terms of the FED keeping the money printer going, and of course to see what Biden announces about a further stimulus packaged that is expected to be as big as $2T.\n\nIn some other stock market news, we saw [Intel](https://ibb.co/9bHNxrx) spiking yesterday after the company decided on a change in leadership, this move put some selling pressure on rival companies like TSM, AMD &amp; others, but I think this is more of a \u201chype move\u201d right now. Intel has still fallen behind it\u2019s competition and it will take massive Capex and R&amp;D investments to catch up, so the selloff in other players should rather be a buying point, especially for AMD.\n\nWe also saw [Target](https://ibb.co/Phk4N4s) reporting huge comp sale increases with a 4.3% increase in traffic and a massive 12.3% increase in the average ticket, as comparable digital sales more than doubled.\n\nWe also saw, their same-day services post an impressive growth of almost 200%, as they remain one of the best plays in the consumer discretionary sector, as 95% of their sales were fulfilled by their 1600 store that are within 10miles of \u00be of the US population.\n\nAlso, guys, these small cap companies keep on giving me reasons to come back to the same points I have been making in the past weeks, with company after company issuing shares, with the latest ones being [Nano](https://ibb.co/qDRKJ7Y) Dimension which are diluting their shares by about 20% while [Lemonade](https://ibb.co/27StT0c) has also increased their stock offering by another 300.000 shares.\n\nWhile in another kind of news we saw [GameStop](https://ibb.co/pLMSXrb) soar yesterday finishing the day up over 57%, after a huge short squeeze pushed the stock up as high as 90% at one point. This has happened after GameStop has [PUSHED](https://ibb.co/F3S2XTT) for a change in leadership with plenty of experience in the e-commerce and online marketing world, with 3 veterans from Chewy, which has been an impressive performer in the online e-commerce business. The [STOCK](https://ibb.co/y8XVnd7) Is up another 20% in pre-market right now as the short squeeze keeps increasing the pressure on the bears.\n\nWe also saw [Alibaba](https://ibb.co/vjKdwKW) making a couple of headlines yesterday, which helped push the stocks 4% higher, after the Wall Street Journal reported that the US is expected to continue to allow investments in Alibaba, Baidu &amp; Tencent, while also continuing their charge into the [EV](https://ibb.co/0tVsJSS) world, with a new electric sedan that features wireless charging in cooperation with China\u2019s state owned SAIC Motor. This is their latest push into the EV world, as Alibaba is also an investor in Xpeng. This news, might help the stock see a recovery, that could be boosted if Jack Ma finally appears and the Ant Group IPO eventually receives the green light.\n\nAnd one last piece of [NEWS](https://ibb.co/Z8RSWQL) is that Affirm went public yesterday and started trading at just over 90$, more than 80% above the IPO price, as the IPO mania keeps on pushing any recent IPO to big pops on the first day of trading, but unfortunately, retail investors do not benefit from this, as the actual return for people who manage to buy right at the open price, is under 10% while also risking a severe drop in the next days. Hopefully more companies will move to direct listings IPOs which will allow retail investors to get part of the action, which will benefit most of the people, not just the \u201cbig players\u201d who get in at much lower prices.\n\nSo, let\u2019s hope for a good day in the markets as the [WORLD](https://ibb.co/T8wRNxc) Markets are in the green while the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/LkrrWtc) are also pointing to a good open.\n\n\ud83d\ude4fThank you everyone for reading!\ud83d\ude4f Hope you enjoyed the content!

Achronix also licenses its intellectual property to **General Motors** for its advanced driver assistance system (ADAS). What a strong base of clients set-up for this company. Once the merger goes through, Achronix will gain more funding to scale their business.\n* Given its specialty in high volume and high speed data processing, **FPGAs are widely used for data centers, artificial intelligence, machine learning and 5G.** These industries are poised to grow significantly over the next few decades. Despite the buzzwords, they aren't buzzwords without validity. Achronix is positioned to serve these markets well.\n* The FPGA industry grabbed investors\u2019 attention when **Intel acquired programmable chip maker Altera in 2015 for approximately $16.7 billion**, followed by Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) acquiring the leading FPGA maker Xilinx for $35 billion last year. As of today's writing, ACEV/Achronix's market cap sits at \\~$330M. In my opinion, it is severely undervalued right now.\n\nAlthough the initial rumors and Definitive Agreement came out this week across major publishers, the hype riding clean energy in SPACs overtook this announcement across the markets. **I expect this to be a strong long-term hold over the next decade. Currently, the SPAC trades at \\~15% above NAV.**\n\n[More details surrounding the merger.](https://preview.redd.it/waf6127ks6a61.png?width=985&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b48fb1bb2e5098cc9162e805e2071960388f8b6a)\n\nSource:\n\n(1) [https://www.achronix.com/sites/default/files/docs/Achronix\\_Ace\\_Merger\\_Presentation\\_VF.pdf](https://www.achronix.com/sites/default/files/docs/Achronix_Ace_Merger_Presentation_VF.pdf)\n\n(2) [https://www.kedglobal.com/newsView/ked202101080005?lang=us](https://www.kedglobal.com/newsView/ked202101080005?lang=us)\n\n(3) [https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210107005892/en/Achronix-to-List-on-Nasdaq-Through-Merger-With-ACE-Convergence](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210107005892/en/Achronix-to-List-on-Nasdaq-Through-Merger-With-ACE-Convergence)\n\n(4) [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-06/achronix-is-said-in-talks-for-merger-with-blank-check-firm-ace](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-06/achronix-is-said-in-talks-for-merger-with-blank-check-firm-ace)",

        "selftext": "First off, full disclosure, I'm long AMD and frankly these last two days of AMD getting beat down over Pat Gelsinger, former VMware CEO and now soon to be Intel CEO has got me riled up. \n\nSo, a month ago, activist investors tell Intel they need to shake things up around the office because AMD is absolutely beating them to a pulp. And now here we are, an announcement that current Intel CEO Bob Swan is stepping down and VMware CEO will take over. \n\nAn analyst downgraded AMD over this move. Let me repeat that, an analyst downgraded AMD over Pat fucking Gelsinger. \n\nIn 2012 Pat took over as VMware CEO. Generally,  VMware traded sideways from 2012 to 2016, then saw a 50% drop. That's 4 years under Pat's leadership where there was no growth. 2016-19 were the best years for Pat, if you look at them in isolation. In 2016, VMware experienced a 50% drop in valuation, then rose from $50 to $200 in that time (400%). Pat took over when VMware was trading at $80-90 in 2012, and the stock currently trades at $135, only ~50% growth in 9 years. Over the past 3 years, VMware is actually down. \n\nWhen we compare what Lisa Su has done for AMD to what Pat did for VMware....there is just no comparison here. AMD over the past 3 years has increased 900%. If anything, Pat might make things worse at Intel. \n\nThe analyst logic for the downgrade:  \"missteps by Intel led to a Blue Sky opportunity for AMD.\" You know what? The sky is still Blue for AMD.",

        "selftext": "\\[I couldn't post yesterday: had to remove a link\\]\n\nAMD is reporting their Q4 2020 results on the 26th. As a long-term investor and given all the events in the past months I believe AMD is still undervalued at $90. I\u2019ve made a previous [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AMD_Stock/comments/kwfxp7/amd_still_undervalued_at_95/) about this but there was some news last week which I incorporated in here is well.\n\n**Intel struggles**\n\nLast week Intel has announced that they will replace Bob Swan with Pat Gelsinger as their CEO. This has led to Intel stock going up 13% and AMD dropping 5-6%. Intel is trading above(!) above the stock price they were when they announced the delays in 7nm/5nm. I think this reaction is severely overdone. Note that Pat used to be at Intel for many years and is not the fresh blood they need to turn this colossal company around. Also in the time he was CEO of VMware (since 2012) the stock only rose 60% which is not a great performance comparing it to competitors. Intel has already announced their Q4 ER will beat estimates but that was a given. The only thing that is relevant is their outlook, which is still going to be meager since a CEO impact the company over years time (see AMD themselves) . AMD popped 12% on Intel Q2 report when they first announced their delays. We could see something similar if Intel gives a weak guidance for the coming year(s)\n\n**AMD Q4 and FY**\n\nEPS Q4 consensus estimate is 0.47 with a range between 0.43 to 0.58. I believe revenue will be higher than expected, mainly due to the huge demand in the console market (PS5/Xbox) but also the PC/notebook market in general since half of the world was in (semi) lockdown for some parts of Q3/Q4. The main thing I am hoping for is that profit margin stays (roughly) the same at 44%, even though margins on consoles are very thin. If they manage to maintain a margin above 40%, EPS could end up 0.55, which would be a 360% increase with respect to Q4 2019 and 280% year on year. That would be very impressive, given the fact that AMD is considered to still be in their growth stage.\n\n**2021&amp;2022 Outlook**\n\nBut the main thing to look out for is the guidance for the coming years. Given the continuing lockdowns, the fact that all the market segments they are in (consoles/PC\u2019s/laptops/servers) are booming and the fact that they have GPU\u2019s that can go head to head with NVDA\u2019s I think they could raise their outlook for the coming year as well as 2022. Especially when the Xilinx merger goes trough and they have an increased TAM (total Accessible Market). Estimated EPS for the coming years are 1.83 and 2.42 but with all the mentioned tailwinds EPS targets of 2.00+ and 2.75 are not crazy. This would imply a P/E off 34 for 2022 which is lower than ASML\u2019s for example (60). Hence a stock price of 105-115 is a fair target in the short term and 137,50-145 as a long-term target.\n\n**Booming Market**\n\nFinally, we have been in the biggest bull market in a long time, mainly driven by central bank money. Biden is planning a 2.8T stimulus package in the coming weeks. The rising tide has lifted all boats, leading to insane PE valuations across the markets (Lemonade trading at 150x FORWARD P/E for example). A forward PE of 34 for AMD is a way better bet in my opinion.\n\nPosition:\n\n2750 shares, 5000 LT warrants, 200 29Jan\u201921 100Calls.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl:dr; buy AMD \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80",

        "selftext": "This is my first DD so I hope it goes well.\n\nCC Neuberger Principal Holdings I (PCPL) has an agreement to merge with E2OPEN.\n\n**What is E2OPEN?**: E2OPEN is a cloud-based, artificial intelligence, on-demand SaaS platform company. E2OPEN is the largest cloud-based provider of networked supply chain applications. More than 70,000 partner companies and 200,000 users, many of the biggest companies in the world use the E2OPEN network today.\n\n**Who are E2OPEN's customers?**: Some of their customers include Google, Facebook, AMD, Nvidia, Intel, HP, IBM etc. [Complete list taken from the investor presentation.](https://i.imgur.com/FfcVX7o.png)\n\n**Who is leading the SPAC?**: The founder &amp; CEO of PLPC is Chinh Chu. A billionaire with 30+ years of investment experience, including 25 years at [Blackstone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Blackstone_Group). He has created 3 SPACs since 2016. The first SPAC, CF Corp, raised $1.2 billion and successfully merged with Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Life. The second SPAC, Collier Creek Holdings, raised $475 million and successfully merged with a company in the consumer sector. And now we have his most recent, third SPAC, PCPL. It has raised $414 million and will merge with E2OPEN. This man was also in charge of taking Dun &amp; Bradstreet private in a large $7.2 billion deal. Before joining Blackstone in 1990, this man also worked in the Mergers &amp; Acquisitions Deparment at Salomon Brothers. His experience is undeniable. \n\n**Backstory**: E2OPEN used to be a public company. Their stock price went as high as $28. They were bought by a private company and were taken off the market in 2015. Ever since they were taken private, E2OPEN was able to grow from $80M in revenue 5 years ago to $335M in 2020. They have acquired a handful of companies and continue to do so. E2OPEN's revenue is about four times what it was in 2015. The percent of revenue that is subscription-based, which is always a key metric for a SaaS company, was 80% in fiscal 2020 and is expected to grow in 2021. It also stands to benefit as companies automate their supply chains further in the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n**The potential negatives:** Their estimated revenue for next year is about +10%. There was an additional funding from instutions through a private investment in public equity (PIPE) of $175M which will be used to pay down existing debt. E2OPEN traded publicly before they were acquired by another company. Their stock price went as high as $28 but also went as low as $8. They were then acquired by Insight Venture Partners and have grown since. \n\n**The Merger**: SPAC shareholders will own 20% of the shares. The merger has a valuation of $2.57B. Upon closing of the transaction with E2OPEN, the ticker will change from 'PCPL' to 'ETWO'.\n\n**TL:DR:** A cloud-based SaaS platform company with customers from some of the biggest corporations in the world today, has a definitive agreement to merge with 'PCPL'. PCPL is run by a billionaire with an unbelievable resume that has already had two previous successful SPAC mergers and this is his third SPAC. The company's revenue has grown massively and their revenue today is about four times higher than it was in 2015. The percent of their revenue that is subscription-based is 80% and is expected to grow in the future. \n\n**Disclaimer:** I own 420 shares of PCPL. Invest at your own risk. As of this writing the price of PCPL is **$10,84.**",

        "selftext": "# While there are many more companies that are discussed much more than TSMC (NYSE:TSM) on here, such as Apple, AMD, Intel, NVIDIA, etc, TSMC is a hidden gem that is getting ready to take off over the next few years. Here's why:\n\nTSMC was founded in 1987 with the intent of bringing Taiwan into the global tech market. Morris Chang, who previously worked at Texas Instruments for over 30 years, is the founder and former CEO of TSMC and widely regarded as the \"godfather of computer chips\". TSMC is currently the world's largest semiconductor producer, with over half of semiconductor revenue from TSMC. Other notable competitors include GlobalFoundries (AMD used them for Zen and Zen+, switching to TSMC for Zen 2 and Zen 3), Intel, and Samsung. TSMC is a pioneer in the pure-play foundry business, meaning that they do not produce any chips for their own products. Instead, they manufacture and sell chips to companies, meaning that those who choose to source chips from TSMC do not have to build expensive silicon fabrication plants to manufacture their own chips. TSMC currently operates 10 different silicon fabs, manufacturing over 10,000 different products using over 250 distinct technologies to cater to 499 different customers in 2019.\n\nNot only is TSMC the largest semiconductor foundry, it is also a pioneer in advancing semiconductor production and performance. Currently, TSMC has 7 customers for its new 5nm chips, including Apple, for A14/X chips and ARM-based chips for Mac products, Qualcomm and MediaTek for 5G smartphone chips, AMD, for next-generation Zen 4 CPUs, Bitmain, Intel, and NVIDIA. TSMC is also currently engineering its N4 chips, built on a 4nm process node, its 3nm chips, and its 2nm chips, which will use new GAAFET (Gate All Around Field Effect Transistor) technology instead of the traditional FinFET technology.\n\n**So who are some of TSMC's biggest and most notable customers?**\n\n# Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nApple is the world's largest company in terms of market capitalization (2.17 Trillion), and has become widely popular due to its heavy and cohesive integration between its products and widespread use by many prominent figures. Currently, it offers many products such as laptops, phones, smart watches, smart TV products, fitness products, and more. It also offers many services and software products, which all integrate with each other via iCloud, continuity software such as Handoff, and more. Recently, Apple has confirmed that they are cutting support for Intel CPUs on their Mac products in a few years, meaning they will shift to using entirely Apple Silicon chips for all of their Mac products. This is in addition to Apple using their own chips for all other products that they currently produce - iPhones, iPads, smart watches, etc.\n\nApple is one of TSMC's largest customers, and that is only expected to grow as they ramp up production for their M1 and next generation ARM chips for Macs. Apple's M1 chips are a strong competitor to AMD and Intel CPUs, especially if they can scale well up to 32 and 64 cores. They are extremely efficient and consume drastically less power than x86-based CPUs (Intel and AMD CPUs), meaning that thermal requirements are much lower. Macs have typically been targeted by PC enthusiasts as an overpriced, underperforming lineup, but we may see that change as Apple's new chips perform extremely well.\n\nApple reported a yearly revenue of 274.5 billion US Dollars in 2020, roughly a 5% increase from 2019. Since Apple relies on TSMC for their chips, and Apple's Mac lineup is likely to become more popular, I would expect that TSMC's revenue from Apple will increase more than we've seen in previous years.\n\n# Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD)\n\nAMD has certainly made a huge return since Lisa Su became CEO in 2014 and the production of Ryzen, which was widely popular due to its high core counts and high price to performance compared to Intel. Now, Ryzen has developed into a strong all-around player, sporting high core counts and great single thread performance. Currently, AMD Ryzen 5000 desktop CPUs outperform Intel's current generation Comet Lake CPUs in games, which is the first time that AMD has surpassed Intel in gaming performance.\n\nAMD has slowly been regaining market share, both in the PC enthusiast side and the server side. In the past two years, AMD has doubled their server market share from 4.5% to 8%. This may not seem like much, but considering that server upgrades are not frequent and those who buy Intel server CPUs are more likely to stick with Intel, that is a massive increase. On the PC enthusiast side, AMD CPUs have accounted for 84% of CPUs sold on mindfactory.de, a German PC Retailer. This is a massive increase considering that in 2016, before the release of Ryzen, Intel accounted for roughly 75% of CPU sales on mindfactory.de.\n\nAMD launched their Zen 3 chips in 2020, which was followed by huge demand and a shortage of these CPUs. This was in part due to demand at TSMC not being able to keep up with AMD's orders. Zen 3 CPUs perform extremely well, and next-generation Zen 4 CPUs, which will be on TSMC's 5nm process, point to a shortage of fab space at TSMC.\n\n# Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM)\n\nQualcomm is a semiconductor company that creates wireless technology chips, CPUs, software, and services related to wireless technology. Their most prominent products include their Snapdragon CPUs, used in phones from some of the largest smartphone companies such as Samsung, LG, OnePlus, Xiaomi, Motorola, and more. They also produce application specific processors for things like cameras, IoT devices, kiosks, robots, and a lot more. Additionally, Qualcomm offers desktop CPUs, such as their Snapdragon 8cx. Qualcomm also produces various connectivity chips for things such as WiFi (onboard chips in laptops, desktop Wifi cards, routers, modems, etc), Bluetooth, and internet connectivity chips on smartphones.\n\nCurrently, Qualcomm relies on TSMC for the production of its Snapdragon chips. Although Samsung beat out TSMC for the production of Qualcomm's upcoming 5G chips, mobile chips accounted for 44.8% of Qualcomm's total revenue in 2020, while RF Front End chips (smartphone internet connectivity chips) accounted for just 9.8% of Qualcomm's total revenue.\n\n# NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\nNVIDIA has been a long time customer of TSMC, dating all the way back to 1998 when NVIDIA switched over to TSMC's 350nm process for the Riva TNT. Since then, TSMC has manufactured nearly every NVIDIA chip up until RTX 3000 series, also known as Ampere. NVIDIA decided to switch to Samsung's 8N 8nm process node, likely due to financial reasons or fab capacity reasons.\n\nHowever, NVIDIA is allegedly moving back to TSMC to manufacture more Ampere GPUs using their 7nm process. There could be a few reasons for this - TSMC might have offered NVIDIA a deal, or capacity for 7nm fabs may have opened up due to large customers such as Apple and AMD shifting more focus towards TSMC's 5nm process.\n\nNVIDIA's RTX 3000 series GPUs, also known as Ampere, are a massive improvement in the GPU space compared to previous generations and just for performance in general. The RTX 3070 performs similarly to an RTX 2080ti, where the former has an MSRP of 499 USD and the latter has an MSRP of 999 USD. In addition to much greater price/performance, Ampere GPUs also heavily increase ray tracing performance so games that can take advantage of ray tracing hardware are actually playable. They are extremely popular, and currently Ampere GPUs are selling anywhere from 200 to upwards of 1500 dollars of their MSRP. NVIDIA is also huge in the AI/Computing space, teaming up with NIO for AI-based self-driving computation, Photoshop, for neural filters, and also  powers some of the fastest supercomputers in the world. In regards to AMD, NVIDIA blows the new RX 6000 series GPUs out of the water for things like streaming performance and workstation performance.\n\n# Intel (NASDAQ:INTC)\n\nWhile Intel has traditionally manufactured most of their products (Internet connectivity products, processors, chipsets, etc), Intel is reportedly shifting a fair amount of their chips to TSMC. Recently, Intel announced they would use TSMC for 7nm Xe graphics chips on their CPUs. In October of 2020, Intel CEO Bob Swan said Intel would decide by January whether it was going to expand its 7nm production, outsource it to a foundry, or both. Intel has severely underperformed in the CPU space compared to AMD, but if they decide to shift some production to TSMC, this could mean that Intel will make a strong return into the CPU space and strong entry into the GPU space.\n\n# Cool, but what does this mean?\n\nAgain, TSMC is the largest foundry, outclassing the likes of Samsung, GlobalFoundries, and other similar companies. There is an insane amount of demand for TSMC's chips, and they are extremely competitive compared to other manufacturers. TSMC has customers such as Apple, AMD, and Qualcomm, which all have great products and are only expected to grow with the release of new technology such as CPUs or 5G networking. Many of its customers are expected to have massive growth over the coming years, meaning that TSMC will reap some of those profits.\n\n# Ok, but why should I buy now?\n\nI mean, TSMC is already up over 100% over the past year, isn't it too late to buy in?\n\nWhen you consider its most important clients, all of them are going to use TSMC for future products that are important to their respective segments. Apple has just begun their venture into producing their own CPUs for Mac products, the release of DDR5 and PCIe 5.0 is right around the corner with AMD's Zen 4 processors, set to release late 2021 or 2022, Qualcomm producing next generation Snapdragon CPUs (and we may see 5G production shifted to TSMC), Intel actually producing competitive CPUs once again (which might be with TSMC), and NVIDIA continuing to dominate in the computing space and the GPU space. Considering that all of these things are happening in the next few years, TSMC is getting ready to take off.\n\nPositions: Currently holding 4/21 calls, will definitely roll calls and load up on more once we get closer to expiry",

        "selftext": "**GameStop short squeeze is ON! Alibaba continues to push into the EV world. Intel spikes while AMD &amp; TSM suffer. Let\u2019s talk about this and other stock market news!**\n\nHello everyone and Good Morning! So, let\u2019s start with the recap of yesterday as we saw the stock market finishing mixed, with the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/qybhmjC) gaining .43%, the [SP500](https://ibb.co/YL4XS6m) also gaining .23% while the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/YTFwLcx) lost just 8 points to close out the day. We also saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/0r28dsT) dropping almost 5% again, continuing the downtrend after that huge spike with the Georgia elections, as it sits at similar levels to the ones before Christmas.\n\nDespite the positive gains for the broad stock market SP500, [OVERALL](https://ibb.co/PrDh7DD), we saw about 57% of the companies declining yesterday, with most of them trading below average volumes, as the number of companies trading above the 50-day moving average still sits over 70%, which is pretty high. Yesterday we saw 6 of the 11 [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/wJH4B8C) finish in the green with Real Estate and Utilities posting gains of more than 1% while the laggards were Energy, Industrials and Materials, as we saw large-cap growth companies finally [OUTPERFORMED](https://ibb.co/kKtRY96) for once in 2021, with small &amp; mid-caps giving up some of the big gains they have posted in this short year, though, Large-Cap Growth companies are still underperforming by 3% compared to the next factor group in 2021.\n\nHere is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/Ms0qkCh) from yesterday, which shows pretty mixed results as expected, with most of the big tech companies posting small gains like Apple, Amazon, Google, Netflix and the rest of the bunch, with Alibaba posting a 4% gain after some EV news popped up and Intel also gaining almost 7% and pushed the rest of the Semiconductors down with TSM and AMD both down over 3%.\n\nWe also got a lot of economic data yesterday as the US [DEFICIT](https://ibb.co/QXXDBrc) fell by $2B to $143B in December compared to the previous month, but is up 10 fold from the $13B deficit from the same period in 2019, and this doesn\u2019t even include any of the $900B stimulus packaged that passed late in December, while the December consumer price [INDEX](https://ibb.co/n1Jr9G2) increased by 0.4% m/m and Core CPI also increase by 0.1%, coming in-line with expectations, as the Atlanta FED business inflation expectations [ROSE](https://ibb.co/t2v98jw) to 2.2% in January compared to December, though sales and profit margins compared to normal, decreased since the last month, while one of the FED\u2019s Vice Chairs [RESTATED](https://ibb.co/WtNxQKM) that the FED won\u2019t raise rates until the average long-term inflation stands at 2% for a year.\n\n[Today](https://ibb.co/C79879d) we get lots of important economic data with Jobless numbers in the early morning, which are expected to come around the same numbers as the previous week and end with the Money Supply and FED Balance Sheet while the stock market will also turn its eyes to see what the FED Leader Powell announces in terms of the FED keeping the money printer going, and of course to see what Biden announces about a further stimulus packaged that is expected to be as big as $2T.\n\nIn some other stock market news, we saw [Intel](https://ibb.co/9bHNxrx) spiking yesterday after the company decided on a change in leadership, this move put some selling pressure on rival companies like TSM, AMD &amp; others, but I think this is more of a \u201chype move\u201d right now. Intel has still fallen behind it\u2019s competition and it will take massive Capex and R&amp;D investments to catch up, so the selloff in other players should rather be a buying point, especially for AMD.\n\nWe also saw [Target](https://ibb.co/Phk4N4s) reporting huge comp sale increases with a 4.3% increase in traffic and a massive 12.3% increase in the average ticket, as comparable digital sales more than doubled. \n\nWe also saw, their same-day services post an impressive growth of almost 200%, as they remain one of the best plays in the consumer discretionary sector, as 95% of their sales were fulfilled by their 1600 store that are within 10miles of \u00be of the US population.\n\nAlso, guys, these small cap companies keep on giving me reasons to come back to the same points I have been making in the past weeks, with company after company issuing shares, with the latest ones being [Nano](https://ibb.co/qDRKJ7Y) Dimension which are diluting their shares by about 20% while [Lemonade](https://ibb.co/27StT0c) has also increased their stock offering by another 300.000 shares.\n\nWhile in another kind of news we saw [GameStop](https://ibb.co/pLMSXrb) soar yesterday finishing the day up over 57%, after a huge short squeeze pushed the stock up as high as 90% at one point. This has happened after GameStop has [PUSHED](https://ibb.co/F3S2XTT) for a change in leadership with plenty of experience in the e-commerce and online marketing world, with 3 veterans from Chewy, which has been an impressive performer in the online e-commerce business. The [STOCK](https://ibb.co/y8XVnd7)  Is up another 20% in pre-market right now as the short squeeze keeps increasing the pressure on the bears.\n\nWe also saw [Alibaba](https://ibb.co/vjKdwKW) making a couple of headlines yesterday, which helped push the stocks 4% higher, after the Wall Street Journal reported that the US is expected to continue to allow investments in Alibaba, Baidu &amp; Tencent, while also continuing their charge into the [EV](https://ibb.co/0tVsJSS) world, with a new electric sedan that features wireless charging in cooperation with China\u2019s state owned SAIC Motor. This is their latest push into the EV world, as Alibaba is also an investor in Xpeng. This news, might help the stock see a recovery, that could be boosted if Jack Ma finally appears and the Ant Group IPO eventually receives the green light.\n\nAnd one last piece of [NEWS](https://ibb.co/Z8RSWQL) is that Affirm went public yesterday and started trading at just over 90$, more than 80% above the IPO price, as the IPO mania keeps on pushing any recent IPO to big pops on the first day of trading, but unfortunately, retail investors do not benefit from this, as the actual return for people who manage to buy right at the open price, is under 10% while also risking a severe drop in the next days. Hopefully more companies will move to direct listings IPOs which will allow retail investors to get part of the action, which will benefit most of the people, not just the \u201cbig players\u201d who get in at much lower prices.\n\nSo, let\u2019s hope for a good day in the markets as the [WORLD](https://ibb.co/T8wRNxc) Markets are in the green while the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/LkrrWtc) are also pointing to a good open.\n\n \ud83d\ude4fThank you everyone for reading!\ud83d\ude4f Hope you enjoyed the content!

        "selftext": "* The market performed strongly today with tech stock leading the way. Big tech such as FB and GOOGL closed up 3.9% and 3.3%, while MSFT closed up almost 1.8%. Conversely, select sectors were punished today as a rotation of sort occurred. Retail/consumer storefront took a beating with WMT down -0.86%, COST down -2.12%, TGT down -3.41%, DG down -2.54%, and BBY down -2.11%.\n\n* It's another spectacular pump day for WSB cult gang as a new religion is formed where GME is the deliverance and the Moon (or Mars?) is the promised land. GME opened at a strong 15%+ and went as high as 25%+ intraday to $45.52 but a tweet by Andrew \"tool bag\" Left of Citron at 6:58 derailed the party and send shares under $37 before the bull run continued. Shares of GME closed $39.36 as shorts continue to be squeezed, though the momentum has clearly be snapped a bit.\n\n* Over at BB land, shares of BlackBerry Ltd. pumped another 25% as the market continues to shift the company's valuation as the Canadian company chugs on with their focus on enterprise security software/service. BB closed up 25.51% to $12.35. \n\n* NFLX reported stellar numbers as sub count tops 200 mil. New net sub numbered in 8.5 mil, an uptick of 2.2 mil from the previous quarter and beats previous projection of 6 mil by 2.5 mil. NFLX sees Q1 additions of 6 mil. While Q4 EPS was $1.19 vs $1.39, NFLX sees Q1 EPS of $2.97 vs consensus of $2.10, further propelling the stock. Implied move was about 8% for weeklies so for those who YOLO'ed you're gucci as long as you didn't buy some retardedly OTM strike. NFLX is up 12.5% as of writing in AH to $564. DIS is up 2% AH and ROKU is up about 1.6%.\n\n* GM pumped more than 9% today on news of MSFT 2 bil investment in GM's self-driving startup Cruise, valuing the side hustle at 30 bil. The boomer stock has low-key been killing it in the past few years and as Model 3 replaces the entry-level 3 series and C class in various neighborhoods, you'll likely see GM EVs replacing various Hondas and Toyotas in the coming years as well. GM closed up 9.75% to $54.84.\n\n* Bank/financial earnings continues with BAC and GS reporting this morning. Both reported strong quarters tho the run-up may have been a bit too much as both underlyings faced the same sell-off pressure their sector faced last Thursday. BAC authorized a 2.9 bil repurchase plan, shares closed the day down slightly -0.73% to $32.77 while GS closed -2.26% to $294.\n\n* Incoming Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen urges Biden to act big to further help the rona punished economy, but also made some notes on raising corporate rates eventually (once the US overcomes rona). With Yellen set to replace Mnunchin, those who enjoyed Mnunchin's various stimulus phone tag with Pelosi will no doubt miss the \"stimulus talks are going well\" pumps.\n\n* Shares of home builders reacted favorably to Biden's $15,000 first-time homebuyer tax credit proposal, though it will likely face an uphill battle in Congress given the various scope and size of the overall stimulus package. LEN is up 2%, DHI up 2.8%, PHM up 3%, NVR up 3.74%, and KBH up 5.5%.\n\n* In WSB meme stock land not named GME and BB, ICLN closed up 2.75% as the cleantech pump resumes, while MT took a beating of -4% to closed at $22.96, despite a slight PT raise of .5 Euro by Morgan Stanley. Surely metal gang won't be another tanker gang situation.\n\n* The DOW closed up 0.38% or 116 pts, Nasdaq up a strong 1.53% or 198 pts, SPX up 0.81% or 30 pts, and RUT is up 1.32% or almost 28 pts.\n\n* Notable ERs and numbers later this week: UAL, DFS after market close on Wednesday and INTC on Thursday after market close. Housing market index on Wednesday morning at 10 AM ET, jobless claims at 8:30 AM on Thursday, and on Friday PMI at 9:45 AM ET with existing home sales soon to follow at 10 AM ET.\n\n(Yesterday's recap: none as it was a holiday you addict.

        "selftext": "I'm trying to do some research about the current environment vs the dot-com bubble. I understand there are some major differences (such as the rate/inflation environment, the easy retail access to trading, Twitter/Reddit, high frequency MM environment, more access to financial news, etc.) but to me, the dot-com bubble is the closest I can think of to the current environment. \n\nI have a very fundamental question that no one has really given me a detailed answer for that I would be curious to see if anyone can shed some light/discussion on (especially r/investing since I know some of you are experienced enough to have traded back then and might still be holding on to CSCO jkjk). The question is why did the dot-com bubble burst and in particular, what made March 2000 special. \n\nThe answer I always get is \"valuations were overstretched...fundamentals caught up...people locked in profit\" but that was the case for 1998 and 1999 too. That was the case for January - February 2000 too. But the bubble only popped in March 2000. Why March 2000? What was special then? Did people see any signs in Jan - Feb 2000 (even in retrospect)? That's why question and any discussion would be appreciated. \n\nI'm also curious to know what the sentiment around certain stocks were (even with no Twitter/Reddit) and the volume of trading. In particular I'm interested in stocks like QCOM, CMGI, CSCO, INTC, the non-tech names like WMT and PFE which were big then (were they lumped together or did they rotate like today?), and also the great survival stories like AMZN. \n\nI also made a more technical post on r/options about this with the link below (interested in the data and also described some specific companies like comparing TSLA to QCOM of 2000), but obviously I don't want to get into that technical details here on r/investing. \n\nThanks!\n\nOptions post: https://old.reddit.com/r/options/comments/ktuvya/anyone_have_options_data_back_during_the_dotcom/",

        "selftext": "AMD is reporting their Q4 2020 results on the 26th (estimated). As a long-term investor and given all the events in the past months I believe AMD is still undervalued at $95.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Intel struggles**\n\nAs is known, Intel has been struggling to keep up with AMD when it comes to the CPU market. Intel is reporting their Q4 on the 21th. There is a chance that they announce any kind of further delays in their 7nm or an even weaker outlook than expected. This has been reinforced by the fact that Intel\u2019s CES presentation was disappointing to many. This could obviously be beneficial to AMD in the runup to their earnings. AMD popped 12% on Intel Q2 report when they first announced their delays. We could get a glimpse off production capacities (and issues) tomorrow when TSMC FY report comes out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**AMD Q4 and FY**\n\nEPS Q4 consensus estimate is 0.47 with a range between 0.43 to 0.58. I believe revenue will be higher than expected, mainly due to the huge demand in the console market (PS5/Xbox) but also the PC/notebook market in general since half of the world was in (semi) lockdown for some parts of Q3/Q4. The main thing I am hoping for is that profit margin stays (roughly) the same at 44%, even though margins on consoles are very thin. If they manage to maintain a margin above 40%, EPS could end up 0.55, which would be a 360% increase with respect to Q4 2019 and 280% year on year. That would be very impressive, given the fact that AMD is considered to still be in their growth stage.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**2021&amp;2022 Outlook**\n\nBut the main thing to look out for is the guidance for the coming years. Given the continuing lockdowns, the fact that all the market segments they are in (consoles/PC\u2019s/laptops/servers) are booming and the fact that they have GPU\u2019s that can go head to head with NVDA\u2019s I think they could raise their outlook for the coming year as well as 2022. Especially when the Xilinx merger falls trough and they have an increased TAM (total Accessible Market). Estimated EPS for the coming years are 1.83 and 2.42 but with all the mentioned headwinds EPS targets of 2.00+ and 2.75 are not crazy. This would imply P/E\u2019s off 34 for 2022 which is lower than ASML\u2019s for example (50). Hence a stock price of 105-115 is a fair target in the short term and 137,50-145 as a long-term target.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Booming Market**\n\nFinally, we have been in the biggest bull market in a long time, mainly driven by central bank money. Biden is planning a 2.8T stimulus package in the coming weeks. The rising tide has lifted all boats, leading to insane PE valuations across the markets (Lemonade trading at 150x FORWARD P/E for example). A forward PE of 34 for AMD is a way better bet in my opinion.\n\ntl;dr: Buy AMD before we go 100+ \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nPosition:\n\n2750 shares, 5000 LT warrants, 200 29Jan\u201921 100Calls.",

So, let\u2019s start with the recap of the last few days as I haven\u2019t made a post since Wednesday, as I was busy making a full stock analysis on Amazon which you can check by clicking [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ky3nxo/amazon_stock_price_target_prediction_analysis_dcf/).\n\nSo, on Thursday we saw all 3 major indexes finish in the red, with the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/MPQ6PVW) losing .12%, the [DOW](https://ibb.co/GJf3qV9) dropping almost 70 points and the broad stock market [SP500](https://ibb.co/r51hS22) dropping below $3800 to finish the day, as the [VIX](https://ibb.co/sq1P6gm) rose again by almost 5%, though 70% of the companies were [advancing](https://ibb.co/yhsdpZD) on normal volumes with just 8 new lows, as 4 of the 11 [sectors](https://ibb.co/ZW0k1VD) finished in the green with Energy outperforming by quite some gap, while Technology was the biggest loser, as Large-Cap Growth companies were the [underperformers](https://ibb.co/jZW53gf), while small-caps shined, with all 3 segments gaining more than 2% for the day.\n\nHere is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/hsmYfRz) from Thursday, with Amazon, Microsoft, Tesla, Netflix &amp; Facebook all losing more than 1%, while the biggest gainers were the Semiconductors, Alibaba and some companies from the Materials and Oil &amp; Gas Industry.\n\nWe also received the investor sentiment [survey](https://ibb.co/XZNYQHY), which for me came in better with a drop of almost 1% in bullish investors and 4% in neutral ones, as fear has reached almost 5% more investors in this past week, which is a good sign for opportunities in the stock market.\n\nMeanwhile, Friday was even worse for the broad stock market, with the [SP500](https://ibb.co/Ms5m47G) losing .72% as the [DOW](https://ibb.co/dKc4ZV0) dropped 177 points while the tech heavy [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/MkcyrQV) was the biggest underperformer dropping below $13000, as the [VIX](https://ibb.co/RSGmvvN) continued to rise near the 25 level and even had a spike near the 26 level in the early morning, but overall finished the [week](https://ibb.co/SnvsgHc) down almost 3%.\n\nWe saw again 4 of the 11 [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/0GTqNZG) finish in the green, but this time Energy was the biggest underperformer, losing almost 4% and giving up some of the huge gains made up this week, while Real Estate was the only sector to post a gain of more than 1% and Communications continued to recover after a bad start to the week, as almost 70% of the companies were declining on [Friday](https://ibb.co/grwfwwM), with Large-Cap Growth Companies slightly recovering to finish the [week](https://ibb.co/vX2mxss) down only 1.2%\n\nHere is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/GdWj575) from Friday, in which you can struggle to find some bright spots, with the gains being concentrated in the Health Care &amp; Real Estate sectors, while for the [WEEK](https://ibb.co/441kLYw), there is some more breadth with Energy, Banks and Semiconductors also posting some gains.\n\nOn Thursday we also saw [Powell](https://ibb.co/M7vznm4) reiterating the point that rates won\u2019t be raised unless inflation becomes a serious problem, as he believes there is still plenty of room in the labor markets until maximum employment is reached, with this point being sustained by the increase in initial jobless [CLAIMS](https://ibb.co/X5brzGZ) which jumped almost 200K, a lot worse than expected and the previous month, as continuing jobless claims also jumped by about the same to 5.27M, a big increase over last week.\n\nMoving on, Friday we also received more economic data, with the January [Consumer](https://ibb.co/n38hy4w) sentiment coming in at 79.2 lower than expected and the previous read, as consumers have lost confidence both in the current conditions and in expectations.\n\nWe also saw the New York business [activity](https://ibb.co/92Rydt9) coming in at 3.5, worse than the 6 expected and the 4.9 in the previous month, with new orders seeing an increase but being offset by a huge drop in shipments.\n\nBusiness [Inventories](https://ibb.co/TRs2SMW) came in as expected at a .5% increase M/M, while Producer [prices](https://ibb.co/py4bpTn) rose less than expected and retail [sales](https://ibb.co/X2v2Y0Z) fell more than expected with a .7% decrease M/M.\n\nThis [WEEK](https://ibb.co/VqGMnJT) we start of slow, with no big data coming in until Thursday as we await the Biden inauguration tomorrow while the most interesting [earnings](https://ibb.co/B2T64dc) for me are Goldman Sachs as a continued read on how the banks are doing after last weeks good numbers, Netflix to see how the stay-at-home stocks will continue to perform and Intel to see how they manage to turn around things.\n\nIn some other stock market news, we saw [Aphria](https://ibb.co/nwxNpm0) beat consensus in earnings and starting a broad rally in pot stocks, while [Lemonade](https://ibb.co/vw4dXQ7) dropped more than 9% after CITRON went at them again, implying a drop back to under 100$ expected very soon.\n\nWe also saw IPOs soar again in the first trading day, with [PETCO](https://ibb.co/KwTHrvY) popping almost 50% and [POSHMARK](https://ibb.co/3cGk45W) more than doubling before dropping 20% as this IPOs are way overbought on every single launch just like most of the SPACs, with [Churchill](https://ibb.co/6JGGKHP) Capital also climbing huge on reports of a Lucid Motors deal, but this is only speculation and could have massive downside if the deal doesn\u2019t go through.\n\nMeanwhile, [Delta](https://ibb.co/FzGKp9C) Airlines reported Q4 earnings and hinted at a positive cash flow by late-spring or summer as they reduced the cash burn from $24M to $12M/ day in Q4, which helped most of the airlines rally.\n\nThursday was capped off my [Biden's](https://ibb.co/bzh0fsV) new relief package proposal that seems to be around $1.9T. This will serve probably as a start point of future negotiations. This package includes $400B in crisis aids including $20B for vaccines, $50B for testing, $30B for supplies and $140B targeted at helping schools reopen and stay open.\n\nThe plan also includes $1T in aids to individuals including $1400 stimulus checks and extending the unemployment benefits to $400/week through September, $30B in rental assistance and extending the federal moratorium on evictions and foreclosure through September and increasing the minimum wage to $15/hour.\n\nBiden\u2019s propsal also includes the highly debated help for state &amp; local governments worth $350B &amp; $50B in small business grants and loans. \n\nThis will probably serve as a starting point and I don\u2019t expect everything to pass even with the blue sweep. It\u2019s likely going to be less than $1.9T, and most of the debate will continue to happen on the state &amp; local help and is also likely to exclude things like increasing the minimum hourly wage, as this is not something temporary like most of the other costs and is likely to receive big roadblocks. This will likely be a short-term boost for the stock market, but the impacts of this in terms of inflation, debt and other economic factors are still unknown in the long-run.\n\nAnd moving on, Friday we saw [Tesla's](https://ibb.co/Vqmf9Mm) forecasted deliveries increased to 1M cars by Wedbush who also raised their price target to $950 with a bull case of $1250, as the Tesla [Model Y](https://ibb.co/1Qws23d) has finally started deliveries in China and will be one of the biggest bets Tesla has made, as the affordable SUV demand is much higher than any of the other Tesla models, while in contrast [Nikola](https://ibb.co/r3dFQSk) seems to be having firms jumping board with an early investor recently selling over 7M shares. Some similar action was seen from the director of [GameStop](https://ibb.co/rvyQdvq) who sold 800K shares after the recent pop in the stock. This kind of companies provide high risk/high reward opportunities, but you should have a tight approach to them, you should take profits whenever you can and not risk losing your gains on these highly volatile stocks that don\u2019t have a good fundamental basis.\n\nSo, let\u2019s hope for a good day in the markets as the [WORLD](https://ibb.co/nr2Pw5W) markets seem to be pointing to a good day, as we await Biden\u2019s pick Janet Yellen\u2019s [remarks](https://ibb.co/bsjzK1b) on the proposed stimulus and the dollar while the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/S3cfpZq) are also pointing to a green open, with the Nasdaq leading the way. \n\nThank you everyone for reading\ud83d\ude4f Hope you enjoyed the content!

        "selftext": "I'm just curious to do some research to see how short dated call IV/skew/leap puts line up with some of the companies back then and how they transformed over the course of 1999-2001. \n\nIn particular, I'm interested in Qualcomm (QCOM), which to me could be considered a \"less volatile\" (ironic since it was quite volatile itself) version of Tesla. For those who don't know, QCOM was thought of the great next generation company back then, and it was actually a really, really good company. The only problem is it was about 10 years too early so it crashed along with the market. There was nothing wrong with QCOM (look at it now), and I believe Tesla will be higher in 20 years too, but the issue is if the market crashes, everything crashes and the high fliers go down the fastest, even if they are good companies. If Tesla does crash, 2000 QCOM is the closest comparison imo. \n\nI would also be interested in if anyone has options data for MSFT, CSCO, INTC, AAPL, GE, and DELL then (those would be like the MFAANGs of today), as well as some of the more stable stocks then like WMT, JNJ, PFE, and the big oil companies. Was there a constant rotation between them and tech every day like what we have now? \n\nFinally, there are the super high growth companies today like ROKU, TWLO, NET, FSLY, ZS, NIO and other EVs who have taken off today. I want to see how they compare to the super high growth companies like AMZN, CMGI, IPET, and JDSU back then (notice how some like AMZN survived but CMGI did not so not trying to be biased either way). \n\nOr in general, does anyone have any ideas/discussions on how to trade in this environment?",

        "selftext": "Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/wallstreetbets. Happy New Year! I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week, month and year ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning January 4th, 2021.\n\n# **Politics will be front and center as a catalyst in the first week of the new year  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/31/politics-will-be-front-and-center-as-a-catalyst-in-the-first-week-of-the-new-year-.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Stocks exit 2020 with strong gains and are riding a tailwind, but already in the dawn of the new year, the market could face its first big challenge.\n*****\n&gt; The final outcome of the 2020 election plays out Tuesday, when voters in Georgia will pick their senators and decide which party controls the U.S. Senate.\n*****\n&gt; With President-elect Joe Biden heading to the White House and a Democratic-controlled House of Representatives, Wall Street has been comfortable with the view that Biden and the Democrats could not succeed with tax hikes and more progressive policy changes while Republicans hold the Senate.\n*****\n&gt; The runoff election for the two Senate seats Tuesday is widely expected to result in one or both of the incumbent Republican senators retaining their seats. But Democrats are close in the polls and should they win, each party would have 50 seats with Vice President-elect Kamala Harris the tie breaker.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cGeorgia is the most important thing to the Biden presidency for the next two years,\u201d said Ed Mills, Washington policy analyst at Raymond James. \u201cIt\u2019s going to determine what is the legislative agenda and who can get confirmed by the United States Senate.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Sen. David Perdue is being challenged by Democrat Jon Ossoff, while GOP Sen. Kelly Loeffler is running against Democrat Raphael Warnock. None of the candidates had more than 50% of the vote in the Nov. 3 election, so Georgia law requires a runoff election between the two leading candidates for each seat.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIt\u2019s a binary event,\u201d said Mills, adding it\u2019s of growing interest to markets. \u201cThe general sense for the market is that Republicans are well positioned to maintain their majority in the Senate. But I think the 2020 election as well as the 2016 election and to some extent, the 2018 election has humbled us \u2026 The Senate outcomes, in particular, seem to be less predictable than almost any other elections.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Mills said the results may take several days to determine, adding to the uncertainty the event could hold for markets. According to an RBC investor survey, 88% expect Republicans to maintain control, and most say that is a positive for the stock market.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe market tends to shoot first and ask questions later. There will certainly be a reaction if Democrats win both those seats,\u201d said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group. Strategists say there could be a relief rally if Republican incumbents see a clear victory.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThat totally dominates [trading] because it\u2019s about do we have status quo or do we have Democrats controlling all parts of Washington and what that means for spending and taxes,\u201d Boockvar said. \u201cI think you could see the worries about taxes overwhelming any thoughts on the benefits of more spending\u201d by Democrats.\n*****\n&gt; # By the numbers\n&gt; A year of extreme volatility ended with a big win for stocks, as the pandemic steered the course for markets. The S&amp;P 500 was up 16.3% for the year, ending at 3,756. That gain comes after a 34% decline early in the year, followed by a powerful more-than 65% rebound. Technology was the big winner for the year, and the Nasdaq was up 43.6% at 12,888.\n*****\n&gt; Besides the runoff vote, the market will be watching a stream of data in the coming week, including the important December jobs report Friday. That could show fewer than 100,000 jobs were added as the spreading virus impacted hiring and layoffs. There were 245,000 jobs created in November.\n*****\n&gt; There is also ISM manufacturing data Tuesday, and a number of Fed speakers, including Vice Chairman Richard Clarida on Friday.\n*****\n&gt; The virus itself could also be a factor for stocks.\n*****\n&gt; Conventional wisdom for the coming year has been that vaccines will be widely distributed, and by the second half things will start to get back to normal and the economy will pick up. But the initial distribution has been slow, and far short of the 20 million targeted for December by President Donald Trump\u2019s task force.\n*****\n&gt; In that recent RBC survey, three quarters of investors were optimistic about vaccine distribution with 80% expecting a majority to be vaccinated by the end of 2021. \u201cWe suspect that the positive outlook for the stock market and the economy would deteriorate if expectations for a smooth vaccine rollout are not met,\u201d RBC strategists wrote.\n*****\n&gt; They also noted that nearly 60% of the investors surveyed believe high stock market valuations are problematic.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThis suggests to us that any threat to the economic and earnings recovery story could spark profit-taking. On this point, it is worth noting that the vaccine was the No. 1 issue keeping investors up at night, closely followed by monetary policy and excessive optimism on the recovery,\u201d the strategists noted.\n*****\n&gt; Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG Union Bank, said investors will also be watching the formal acceptance of the Electoral College vote Wednesday. Strategists expect the vote count to confirm Biden\u2019s presidency.\n*****\n&gt; However, Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley says he will challenge the certification, and several House Republicans have already vowed to contest the election at that time. If one House member and a senator jointly object to a state\u2019s slate of electors, the two houses of Congress must separately debate and vote on the objection.\n*****\n&gt; Strategists see little chance of any impact on the election outcome, but there could be fireworks. Trump has been claiming since the election that there was fraud but multiple courts failed to find any truth to the claims.\n*****\n&gt; Rupkey said investors are not taking into account enough potential for political risk from the deep animosity between the two political parties.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think the additional stimulus and hopes for additional stimulus, and infrastructure spending in 2021, I don\u2019t know that that is such a slam dunk, because of the issue of political instability,\u201d he said.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/cAXzkxf.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/HnhSggu.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Thursday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF THURSDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/5egoYkS.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/UlNY0Um.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/z4wSKuc.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/32Ma7rG.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Thursday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/mRJqU8A.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Thursday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/J7B4Njx.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/5udYrpD.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/JJmAiwp.png))**\n\n# **Thursday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/1ARzFfu.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Why A Year-End Rally Bodes Well For 2021\n\n&gt; Welcome to the last day of 2020! It has been a devastating year in so many ways, yet for investors it has been quite rewarding. Much of the gains in 2020 have taken place the final two months, with the S&amp;P 500 Index up more than 14% in November and December so far, the best end to a year since WWII.\n\n&gt; A big end of year rally could have bulls smiling in 2021. \u201cTurns out a 10% or more gain the final two months of the year has equaled a higher S&amp;P 500 the following year every single time since World War II,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cIn fact, January was also higher every single time as well, so maybe this strong rally to end the year is a clue for higher prices into next year.\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the S&amp;P 500 gained an average of more than 18% the year following a 10% or more surge during the final two months of the year. Meanwhile, January was up 5 for 5 as well, rising an impressive 3% on average.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/12.31.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Here\u2019s what the average year looks like after the prior year gains 10% or more the final two months compared to a typical year. Once again, strong returns are the playbook historically.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/blog-12.31.20-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; We wish everyone a happy and safe New Years Eve and we\u2019ll see you in 2021!\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Fifty to Zero in 283 Days\n\n&gt; In a year with some pretty crazy charts, the one below is right up there with some of the best. After all the markets have been through this year, bot the S&amp;P 500 and Long-Term Treasuries have seen nearly identical returns on a total return basis. That's right, with just a few hours left in the trading year, the S&amp;P 500's total return in 2020 has been a gain of 17.6%, while Long Term US Treasuries, as measured by the B of A Merrill Lynch Long-Term Treasury Index has rallied 17.3%. What makes this nearly identical performance all the more incredible is that on March 23rd, the performance gap between the two was more than 50 percentage points.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123120-Stocks-Bonds.png))**\n\n&gt; The fact that stocks and bonds have essentially seen identical returns this year isn't typical. The chart below shows the annual performance spread between the S&amp;P 500 and long-term US Treasuries going back to 1978. During that time, the S&amp;P 500 has historically outperformed long-term US Treasuries by an average of 3.9 percentage points per year, but the average gap in performance between the two has been over 15 percentage points. In the 43 years since 1978, there have only been seven other years where the performance spread between the two asset classes was less than five percentage points and just two years (1985 and 1992) where the performance spread was less than a percentage point.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123120-Stocks-Bonds-Annual-Spreads.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Back-to-Back Big Years for Technology\n\n&gt; With just two trading days (including today) left in 2020, the S&amp;P 500 Technology sector is on pace for its second year in a row of rallying more than 40%. Going back to 1990, the only time the Technology sector experienced back-to-back returns of more than 40% was in 1998 and 1999. Back then, not only was the Technology sector up 40%+ in back-to-back years, but it was also up over 75% in both of those years. If you think markets are pretty crazy these days, they still have nothing on the last two years of the 1990s!\n\n&gt; In terms of cumulative returns, the Technology sector is up 210% since the last trading day of 2018, whereas in 1999 it was up 317% in a two-year span. What's also interesting to note about the last 31 years of returns for the Technology sector is how it has only experienced five down years, while the S&amp;P 500 has been down in ten different years during that span. Furthermore, since 2009 there has only been one down year and the decline was a paltry 1.6%. Not a bad 12-year run!\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123020-Technology-Sector-Performance.png))**\n\n&gt; Given that the sector has more than doubled in the last two years, there have been some big individual winners. Topping the list with a gain of just under 400% is Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). On the last day of 2018, AMD traded hands for under $20 per share. Today's it's over $90. AMD has a lead of more than 100 percentage points over the next closest stock - NVIDIA (NVDA) - which is up 288%. Interestingly, there aren't a lot of major outliers to the upside compared to the sector's 210% gain, but that's because Apple (AAPL), the sector's largest stock, has paced the sector's gains by rallying more than 240%.\n\n&gt; On the downside, just four stocks in the Technology sector have declined in the last two years. The worst of these has been DXC Technology (DXC) which has lost more than half of its value, while Juniper (JNPR) and HP Enterprise (HPE) are down between 10% and 20%. Lastly, FLIR Systems (FLIR) has declined less than 2%, so depending on how it acts in the next two days, it could move into positive territory just as Intel (INTC) did yesterday after Third Point bailed it out and moved the stock barely into positive territory for the last two years.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123020-Technology-Sector-Stocks.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Growth Dragging on Small Caps\n\n&gt; In the past couple of weeks, we have frequently been keeping tabs on small-cap equities which have been particularly strong performers of late resulting in very overbought readings as well as extended valuations. More specifically, taking a look at growth-oriented small-caps, with only a couple days left in the year small-cap growth stocks\u2014proxied by the Russell 2000 Growth ETF (IWO)\u2014are on pace to have outperformed large-cap equivalents in 2020. On December 10th, IWO surpassed the S&amp;P 500 Growth ETF (IVW) in terms of YTD performance, and even after pulling back in the past week, IWO is still in the lead.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123020-Small-Large1.png))**\n\n&gt; As a result of recent moves, there has been a sharp reversal on a relative basis between the two ETFs in the past week. In the chart below, we show the ratio of the Russell 2000 Growth ETF (IWO) versus the S&amp;P 500 Growth ETF (IVW). This ratio took off beginning in the early fall meaning small-cap growth drastically outperformed large-cap growth. But the former's weakness in the past several days has put a halt to that move.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123020-Small-Large2.png))**\n\n&gt; As to just how sharp of a reversal this was, in the five days through yesterday's close, the decline in the ratio of IWO to IVW was the largest since June. Before that, April and March saw declines that were even larger. Not only was this one of the biggest drops in the relative performance of small-cap growth to large-cap growth in the past few months, but that also stands in the bottom 0.5% of all readings going back to 2000 when the ETF first began trading. Outside of this past spring, the only other periods that have also experienced this type of underperformance of small-cap growth relative to large-cap growth was at various points in 2011, 2008, and a handful of times in the early 2000s.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123020-Small-Large3.png))**\n\n&gt; Small-cap underperformance has not necessarily been broad though. For value stocks, small caps (IWN) have generally outperformed large caps (IVE) for the entirety of the new bull market. While there was a bit of a turn lower in recent days, it has been nowhere close to as dramatic of a move as growth stocks.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123020-Small-Large4.png))**\n\n&gt; In the charts below, we show average performance over the past week of Russell 2000 stocks broken into deciles based on their price to sales and price to book ratios. As shown, the most aggressively valued deciles have averaged the worst performance in the past week. Stocks with low P/S and P/B ratios have not been immune from the weakness, but they have held up significantly better.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123020-RTY-Decile.png))**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/5udYrpD.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/hQIRBYI.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 1.4.21 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 1.4.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday  1.5.21 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ZAbC0jw.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 1.5.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/wKzyMxp.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 1.6.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/BUFtffd.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 1.6.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/cDQHHqx.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 1.7.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/NhUT413.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 1.7.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/7p03h4M.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 1.8.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 1.8.21 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Micron Technology, Inc. $75.18\n**Micron Technology, Inc.

FuboTv keeps on crumbling while NIO posts great sales numbers, let\u2019s talk about this &amp; other stock market news**\n\nHello everyone and Good Morning! So, let\u2019s start with the recap of the last trading day of 2020, as we saw both the broad stock market [SP500](https://ibb.co/bHgX2sf) and the [Dow Jones Industrial](https://ibb.co/D471c7X) finish up over 0.60% and finishing at record highs, while the tech heavy [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/vzGgSBb)  finished barely up for the day, gaining .14%. We also saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/2YrvMpT) finishing just down for the day, but it\u2019s still up from a [week](https://ibb.co/LxdGJ8c) ago, as the volatility still remains way above the [levels](https://ibb.co/XbWkzW4) before March when it rose to over 80.\n\nWe just about saw a positive ratio of companies [advancing](https://ibb.co/5TwrM2m) to close out the year as the volume was belove average with just 100 new highs, as we saw 10 of the 11 [sectors](https://ibb.co/yyrTGGP) finishing in the green with Utilities, Financials, Real Estate &amp; Health Care gaining more than 1% while Energy was the only sector to finish the day with a loss.  \nWe also saw most factor groups [finishing](https://ibb.co/dmvNJgL) the day in the red with only Large-Cap Value companies posting a gain of .3%, as you can see in Thursday\u2019s [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/wBGr7cR) with gains all around the board, while losses were concentrated in the Biotech and Oil &amp; Gas industry.\n\nHere is the weekly [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/zQWD12B) with names like Alibaba, Shopify, Palantir, Square and Zoom being some of the biggest losers, while TESLA continued to push higher as Tesla finished the month of [December](https://ibb.co/ZX09X8Z) with a gain of more than 20% as you can see here, while many of the other big tech names also had a strong month, with most of the losses being concentrated in the communication sector and of course Alibaba which was hit by a lot of negative news.\n\nWe also [finished](https://ibb.co/r5JRk5b) the year with most sectors in the green as you can see here, led by Technology, Consumer Cyclicals and Communications. But gains were had in most other sectors as well, except the Financial, Travel and Energy sectors, which finished the year down.\n\nThe biggest [losers](https://ibb.co/nDgRs1S) in the SP500 which finished the year up more than 16% were by far stocks like Carnival, OXY, Norwegian Cruise Line, United Airlines and many more others. The Nasdaq 100 wasn\u2019t safe either despite jumping almost 50% in 2020, having the best gains in 11years, with companies like Walgreens, Fox and Intel posting losses of over 17%, while the Dow was the laggard finishing just over 7% up for the year as Boeing, Chevron and Intel dragged the index lower.\n\nWe also saw huge [winners](https://ibb.co/n7yP7cM)  in 2020, as the SP500 was led higher by stocks like Apple, Nvidia, PayPal, Amazon and many others that posted huge gains. While the Nasdaq 100 jumped to record highs lead by Tesla which posted an incredible year with other stocks like Moderna, Peloton &amp; Zoom also rising by more than 300%. The Dow also had big winners but still lagged as the biggest gainers here were the tech giants Apple &amp; Microsoft joined by some other stocks like Nike, Disney &amp; Salesforce.\n\nWe also got some economic data since Thursday as Macau\u2019s gaming [revenue](https://ibb.co/NWBrC3s) continued the slow recovery, but the visits in the travel dependent region were 20% higher in the Holiday period compared to the start of December, which may be another positive sign for the Macau Gambling business.\n\nMeanwhile we also received the latest jobless [numbers](https://ibb.co/Km8px8X), which dipped below 800K again, 19K less than last week and more than 40K less than expected, as the continuing jobless claims also fell to just over 5.2M more than 100K better than expected and the previous [report](https://ibb.co/gJLQYPB).\n\nWhile this [week](https://ibb.co/mDnXFZY) we start to receive important economic data that alongside the results of the Georgia runoff election might push the market either to more gains, or if the results and data don\u2019t show up as investors &amp; analysts expected it, we might see an increase in volatility again which will lead to a market pullback or correction, which in my opinion would be a good time to go out and find deals to buy again.\n\nWe also really don\u2019t get any significant [earnings](https://ibb.co/60QM77h) releases this week, with most of the interesting ones like Micron, Walgreens &amp; Bed Bath &amp; Beyond coming on Thursday.\n\nSo, in some other stock market news, Tesla topped [expectations](https://ibb.co/g9048Ry) of 163K deliveries in Q4 again but did finish just shy of the 500K mark. The company delivered more than 180K vehicle in the last quarter, as we saw [Tesla](https://ibb.co/th7Hhnc)  pricing the model Y at just over $50.000 in China and are expecting to start deliveries this month as they keep expanding their sales in the world\u2019s biggest car market, as they are targeting to make this their biggest market surpassing the US. Tesla closed over 700$ for the first time and if you want to see my opinion on this stock, check out my prediction on Tesla [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kci2lk/my_tesla_stock_price_predictions_buy_or_sell/).\n\nSome other EV makers from China also posted sales numbers with [Li Auto](https://ibb.co/LYCSs1N) increasing deliveries five-fold year/year with a 32% increase month/month in December, while [XPENG](https://ibb.co/Zc7FSQC) also announced record delivery numbers up 35% month/month and more than 300% year/year for December. We also saw [NIO](https://ibb.co/4VWGX78) posting a monthly deliveries record of just over 7K, up over 120% year/year and finishing the year with over 43K deliveries, which were also up over 110% year/year, as they are also planning on revealing some new sedan models and their latest developments on self-driving and other technologies next week.\n\nMeanwhile we saw [Lemonade](https://ibb.co/dKh6kx0) take a ride after another short-seller released a statement, pointing out to the final lock-up period after the IPO, as a moment that will bring huge selling to this stock, despite the [company](https://ibb.co/YWksq6g) needing just over 4 years to reach the first million customers, less than 5 times the time it took companies like StateFarm, Geico and Allstate to reach their first million. I personally am an investor in this company, and I really like what they are doing, so I am not going to sell my shares anytime soon.\n\nGuys, personally I can\u2019t wait to see the sales numbers and how the services business is growing for [Apple](https://ibb.co/cx07jJs) as the top-of-the-line products keep having great demand, but we do have to see what happens in the US-China relations, as this could impact the Apple revenue stream, this after the New York Stock Exchange has [started](https://ibb.co/599nrxc) the process of delisting telecom giants from China. You can check out my prediction on Apple [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kmzvqv/apple_stock_price_predictions_buy_or_sell_aapl/)\n\nWe also saw a [memo](https://ibb.co/qyBfzrq) from DELTA\u2019s CEO, as he expects the company to return to positive cashflow in the spring, as they are planning to start paying down debt as soon as that happens to reduce the burden the company has taken on since March 2020.\n\nMeanwhile [FuboTV](https://ibb.co/Dg5jZ6x) continues its sharp decline after a number of firms have started to short the stock pointing to insane valuations and outlook. Fubo plunged again almost 16% Thursday and is down almost 50% in the past week as the IPO lockup period expired, more than tripling the shares float.\n\nAnd on last piece of news that just came out is that [Roku](https://ibb.co/gM8Z4Bv) is looking to buy the content catalog from Quibi, this would give a boost to Roku\u2019s exclusive programming, as the stock has seen an immediate reaction and is up over 3.5% in pre-market trading.\n\nLet\u2019s hope for a good day in the market as US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/zf9tMYZ) seem to be pointing at a good open, with the SP500 leading the way to start off the year as we wait to receive the first economic [data](https://ibb.co/f24tRCS) this year in the early morning, while the global stock [markets](https://ibb.co/sjvZMrx) started on a positive note except Japan.\n\nThank you everyone for reading!

        "selftext": "#1) Invesco NASDAQ Next Gen 100 ETF (QQQJ)\n\nThe Invesco NASDAQ Next Gen 100 ETF (QQQJ) follows the immensely well known Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ) by investing in the 101st to the 200th largest NASDAQ listed companies. These companies are less mature than those in the NASDAQ 100 but with high growth potential.\n\nThe top holdings of QQQJ include Roku Inc (ROKU), Crowdstrike Holdings Inc (CRWD), The Trade Desk Inc (TTD), Zscaler Inc (ZS), Enphase Energy Inc (ENPH), AstraZeneca PLC (AZN), Take-Two Interactive Software Inc (TTWO), Old Dominion Freight Line Inc (ODFL), Fortinet Inc (FTNT), and Coupa Software Inc (COUP). Many of the most popular growth companies are included in this new ETF.\n\n#2) VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH)\n\nThe VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF tracks the semiconductor industry--one of the hottest industries of 2020. It isn\u2019t hard to be bullish on semiconductors when they are required by virtually all companies. Electric vehicles have put the spotlight on many semiconductor companies in the race for autonomous driving.\n\nThe VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH) has top holdings including: Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM), Nvidia Corp (NVDA), ASML Holding (ASML), Broadcom Inc (AVGO), Advanced Micro Devices Inc (AMD), Texas Instruments Inc (TXN), Intel Corp (INTC), Qualcomm Inc (QCOM), Micron Technology Inc (MU), and Analog Devices Inc (ADI). Semiconductors have had a killer year and the outperformance will likely continue in the future as demand for semiconductors increases.\n\n#3) Salesforce.com, Inc (CRM)\n\nSalesforce.com, Inc (CRM) develops cloud computing solutions for customer relationship management (hence the ticker \u201cCRM\u201d). Salesforce recently announced it was acquiring Slack Technologies (WORK) for over $27 billion. This deal was one of the largest acquisitions announced in 2020. Salesforce has fallen almost 15% since the acquisition announcement on fears it is overpaying in the Slack acquisition.\n\nHowever, Salesforce has continued to crush earnings estimates in the last quarters of 2020 with analyst consensus that this growth can continue. Salesforce operates in a growing market and continues to be the number one choice for customer relationship management.\n\n#4) Array Technologies, Inc. (ARRY)\n\nArray Technologies, Inc. (ARRY) is in the business of solar tracking solutions and services. The Company currently provides the DuraTrack solar tracking system and SmarTrack which is software that automatically adjusts module angles to compensate for environment changes.\n\nArray is quickly growing revenues with earnings and free cash flow remaining positive since 2019. The Company has stated its plans for continued growth and its willingness to make acquisitions. Array Technologies is a direct bet on the future of solar energy which will likely benefit under a democratic Whitehouse. This Company allows investors to invest in the future of solar without investing directly into solar panels.\n\n#5) Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (VRTX)\n\nVertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (VRTX) focuses on the treatment of cystic fibrosis through several drugs and has several ongoing clinical trials for the treatment of other diseases. Vertex collaborates with an impressive list of companies, including CRISPR Therapeutics (CRSP), Moderna (MRNA), and Merck &amp; Co. (MRK).\n\nVertex Pharmaceuticals has proven itself to be competent in developing market-leading drugs and securing lengthy patents on its treatments. The Company will continue to dominate the cystic fibrosis space in the future due to limited competition.\n\n**Honorable mentions:** CSIQ, AMZN, MSFT, PENN, ABBV, AZN, FUSE\n\n----\n\n**Note:** I hold positions in all of the mentioned companies and exchange traded funds. Many of these companies are valued at high multiples due to their growth potential. This is not financial advice; invest at your own risk.",

        "selftext": "**Biden unveils the $1.9T stimulus package proposal. Tesla starts deliveries of the Model Y in China. Lemonade drops after the latest Citron short opinion while Nikola &amp; GameStop shareholders jump ship. Let\u2019s talk about this and other stock market news**\n\nHello everyone and Good Morning! So, let\u2019s start with the recap of the last few days as I haven\u2019t made a post since Wednesday, as I was busy making a full stock analysis on Amazon which you can check by clicking [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kxurg0/amazon_stock_150_upside_amazon_stock_price_target/).\n\nSo, on Thursday we saw all 3 major indexes finish in the red, with the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/MPQ6PVW) losing .12%, the [DOW](https://ibb.co/GJf3qV9) dropping almost 70 points and the broad stock market [SP500](https://ibb.co/r51hS22) dropping below $3800 to finish the day, as the [VIX](https://ibb.co/sq1P6gm) rose again by almost 5%, though 70% of the companies were [advancing](https://ibb.co/yhsdpZD) on normal volumes with just 8 new lows, as 4 of the 11 [sectors](https://ibb.co/ZW0k1VD) finished in the green with Energy outperforming by quite some gap, while Technology was the biggest loser, as Large-Cap Growth companies were the [underperformers](https://ibb.co/jZW53gf), while small-caps shined, with all 3 segments gaining more than 2% for the day.\n\nHere is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/hsmYfRz) from Thursday, with Amazon, Microsoft, Tesla, Netflix &amp; Facebook all losing more than 1%, while the biggest gainers were the Semiconductors, Alibaba and some companies from the Materials and Oil &amp; Gas Industry.\n\nWe also received the investor sentiment [survey](https://ibb.co/XZNYQHY), which for me came in better with a drop of almost 1% in bullish investors and 4% in neutral ones, as fear has reached almost 5% more investors in this past week, which is a good sign for opportunities in the stock market.\n\nMeanwhile, Friday was even worse for the broad stock market, with the [SP500](https://ibb.co/Ms5m47G) losing .72% as the [DOW](https://ibb.co/dKc4ZV0) dropped 177 points while the tech heavy [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/MkcyrQV) was the biggest underperformer dropping below $13000, as the [VIX](https://ibb.co/RSGmvvN) continued to rise near the 25 level and even had a spike near the 26 level in the early morning, but overall finished the [week](https://ibb.co/SnvsgHc) down almost 3%.\n\nWe saw again 4 of the 11 [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/0GTqNZG) finish in the green, but this time Energy was the biggest underperformer, losing almost 4% and giving up some of the huge gains made up this week, while Real Estate was the only sector to post a gain of more than 1% and Communications continued to recover after a bad start to the week, as almost 70% of the companies were declining on [Friday](https://ibb.co/grwfwwM), with Large-Cap Growth Companies slightly recovering to finish the [week](https://ibb.co/vX2mxss) down only 1.2%\n\nHere is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/GdWj575) from Friday, in which you can struggle to find some bright spots, with the gains being concentrated in the Health Care &amp; Real Estate sectors, while for the [WEEK](https://ibb.co/441kLYw), there is some more breadth with Energy, Banks and Semiconductors also posting some gains.\n\nOn Thursday we also saw [Powell](https://ibb.co/M7vznm4) reiterating the point that rates won\u2019t be raised unless inflation becomes a serious problem, as he believes there is still plenty of room in the labor markets until maximum employment is reached, with this point being sustained by the increase in initial jobless [CLAIMS](https://ibb.co/X5brzGZ) which jumped almost 200K, a lot worse than expected and the previous month, as continuing jobless claims also jumped by about the same to 5.27M, a big increase over last week.\n\nMoving on, Friday we also received more economic data, with the January [Consumer](https://ibb.co/n38hy4w) sentiment coming in at 79.2 lower than expected and the previous read, as consumers have lost confidence both in the current conditions and in expectations.\n\nWe also saw the New York business [activity](https://ibb.co/92Rydt9) coming in at 3.5, worse than the 6 expected and the 4.9 in the previous month, with new orders seeing an increase but being offset by a huge drop in shipments.\n\nBusiness [Inventories](https://ibb.co/TRs2SMW) came in as expected at a .5% increase M/M, while Producer [prices](https://ibb.co/py4bpTn) rose less than expected and retail [sales](https://ibb.co/X2v2Y0Z) fell more than expected with a .7% decrease M/M.\n\nThis [WEEK](https://ibb.co/VqGMnJT) we start of slow, with no big data coming in until Thursday as we await the Biden inauguration tomorrow while the most interesting [earnings](https://ibb.co/B2T64dc) for me are Goldman Sachs as a continued read on how the banks are doing after last weeks good numbers, Netflix to see how the stay-at-home stocks will continue to perform and Intel to see how they manage to turn around things.\n\nIn some other stock market news, we saw [Aphria](https://ibb.co/nwxNpm0) beat consensus in earnings and starting a broad rally in pot stocks, while [Lemonade](https://ibb.co/vw4dXQ7) dropped more than 9% after CITRON went at them again, implying a drop back to under 100$ expected very soon.\n\nWe also saw IPOs soar again in the first trading day, with [PETCO](https://ibb.co/KwTHrvY) popping almost 50% and [POSHMARK](https://ibb.co/3cGk45W) more than doubling before dropping 20% as this IPOs are way overbought on every single launch just like most of the SPACs, with [Churchill](https://ibb.co/6JGGKHP) Capital also climbing huge on reports of a Lucid Motors deal, but this is only speculation and could have massive downside if the deal doesn\u2019t go through.\n\nMeanwhile, [Delta](https://ibb.co/FzGKp9C) Airlines reported Q4 earnings and hinted at a positive cash flow by late-spring or summer as they reduced the cash burn from $24M to $12M/ day in Q4, which helped most of the airlines rally.\n\nThursday was capped off my [Biden's](https://ibb.co/bzh0fsV) new relief package proposal that seems to be around $1.9T. This will serve probably as a start point of future negotiations. This package includes $400B in crisis aids including $20B for vaccines, $50B for testing, $30B for supplies and $140B targeted at helping schools reopen and stay open.\n\nThe plan also includes $1T in aids to individuals including $1400 stimulus checks and extending the unemployment benefits to $400/week through September, $30B in rental assistance and extending the federal moratorium on evictions and foreclosure through September and increasing the minimum wage to $15/hour.\n\nBiden\u2019s propsal also includes the highly debated help for state &amp; local governments worth $350B &amp; $50B in small business grants and loans. \n\nThis will probably serve as a starting point and I don\u2019t expect everything to pass even with the blue sweep. It\u2019s likely going to be less than $1.9T, and most of the debate will continue to happen on the state &amp; local help and is also likely to exclude things like increasing the minimum hourly wage, as this is not something temporary like most of the other costs and is likely to receive big roadblocks. This will likely be a short-term boost for the stock market, but the impacts of this in terms of inflation, debt and other economic factors are still unknown in the long-run.\n\nAnd moving on, Friday we saw [Tesla's](https://ibb.co/Vqmf9Mm) forecasted deliveries increased to 1M cars by Wedbush who also raised their price target to $950 with a bull case of $1250, as the Tesla [Model Y](https://ibb.co/1Qws23d) has finally started deliveries in China and will be one of the biggest bets Tesla has made, as the affordable SUV demand is much higher than any of the other Tesla models, while in contrast [Nikola](https://ibb.co/r3dFQSk) seems to be having firms jumping board with an early investor recently selling over 7M shares. Some similar action was seen from the director of [GameStop](https://ibb.co/rvyQdvq) who sold 800K shares after the recent pop in the stock. This kind of companies provide high risk/high reward opportunities, but you should have a tight approach to them, you should take profits whenever you can and not risk losing your gains on these highly volatile stocks that don\u2019t have a good fundamental basis.\n\nSo, let\u2019s hope for a good day in the markets as the [WORLD](https://ibb.co/nr2Pw5W) markets seem to be pointing to a good day, as we await Biden\u2019s pick Janet Yellen\u2019s [remarks](https://ibb.co/bsjzK1b) on the proposed stimulus and the dollar while the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/S3cfpZq) are also pointing to a green open, with the Nasdaq leading the way. \n\nThank you everyone for reading\ud83d\ude4f Hope you enjoyed the content!

        "selftext": "What's up fellas at Options. I made a tool called [FD Ranker](https://www.swaggystocks.com/dashboard/stocklabs/fd-ranker) that logs the average IV of popular tickers. The tool is inclusive of almost 1,000 tickers now.\n\n**What is this tool good for**\n\nI posted in ThetaGang the list with HIGH IV options which is great for running the wheel or selling options. This list is an inverse of that list and displays tickers where IV is pretty low, thus, purchasing calls will likely be cheaper. For example, AAPL implied volatility right now is almost back to the pre-March lows. Remember a low IV can go lower and a high IV can go higher.

        "selftext": "Good Friday evening to all of you here on r/wallstreetbets. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning January 18th, 2021.\n\n# **Biden heads into inauguration with a stock market tailwind - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/15/biden-heads-into-inauguration-with-a-stock-market-tailwind.html)**\n*****\n&gt; President-elect Joe Biden moves into the White House in the coming week with the biggest stock market tailwind since a presidential Election Day going back to at least 1952.\n*****\n&gt; According to CFRA data that begins that year, the near 13% gain since Nov. 3 would be the biggest increase in the S&amp;P 500 between the election and inauguration if the gains hold. President John F. Kennedy\u2019s 8.8% gain had been the best, followed by President Dwight Eisenhower, with 6.3%, and President Donald Trump, with 6.2%.\n*****\n&gt; Biden\u2019s promise of the $1.9 trillion relief package he announced Thursday is one of the reasons for the stock market\u2019s surge, and it will be a big focus of markets in the week ahead as investors handicap its chances of winning congressional approval.\n*****\n&gt; The Martin Luther King Jr. Day holiday starts off the week, and over the next four days several dozen S&amp;P 500 companies report earnings. Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, IBM, Intel and Procter &amp; Gamble are among the companies reporting.\n*****\n&gt; # Biden will have no honeymoon\nThe $1.9 trillion stimulus package is at the top of the agenda. But there is also significant focus on whether his administration will be better at controlling the pandemic and rolling out the vaccine, as he has promised.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThis is the number he came in at. Where do negotiations go from here?\u201d Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial, said of the $1.9 trillion package. She pointed to worries about a weakening economy, evident in December\u2019s retail sales data, down a surprising 0.7%, and weekly jobless claims, at the worst level since August.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cYou could argue this is Covid-related and therefore what is most important going forward is to see the logistics of the vaccines, inoculations gain orderly momentum. That is crucial for the market,\u201d she said.\n*****\n&gt; Krosby said the market is focused on the inauguration.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThey want to see it go smoothly, and that there\u2019s not any security lapse. The market absorbed the events of Jan. 6. The market looked ahead and figured out that at this point it was a one-off, and the market ended higher on Jan. 6,\u201d she said. \u201cBut always the market becomes much more defensive if what we considered an isolated event suddenly broadens out.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; There will be heightened security surrounding the inauguration after a mob of Trump supporters assaulted the Capitol while Congress was in the process of confirming the Electoral College vote. The House last week voted to impeach Trump for inciting the mob, and now there is concern about further incidents in Washington or at state capitals.\n*****\n&gt; # Stimulus and stocks\nMarkets are also watching carefully to see whether Biden can bridge some of the deep divide between Republicans and Democrats, who now hold a thin majority in Congress.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe\u2019re getting stimulus, and now the question is \u2018OK, you\u2019re supposed to be this great compromiser,\u2019\u201d said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA.\n*****\n&gt; Political strategists expect Biden will get his stimulus package but it will be trimmed down. Ed Mills, Washington policy analyst at Raymond James, said the package could be cut to about $1 trillion based on the size previously discussed by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and outgoing Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cDoes Congress want to have a bipartisan show of support after what has been an extraordinarily tenuous beginning of this year, to put it mildly?\u201d Mills said. He said the stock market should continue to do well because it is going to get stimulus spending.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cD.C. is going to be there with more spending, or consumers are going to be there with more spending if they have the ability to get to a post-vaccine world sooner,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; Stovall said that if history is a guide, the stock market should do well with Biden. The average gain of the S&amp;P 500 in the first 100 days for Democratic presidents is 3.5%, going back to 1952. For Republicans in the same period, it\u2019s been an average 0.5%.\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 has also gained an average 11.3% in the first year of a Democratic president, but just 5.7% for Republicans, going back to World War II.\n*****\n&gt; The stock market will continue to monitor the bond market, after the 10-year Treasury yield reached a high of 1.18% this past week, the highest since March. It since slid back to about 1.08% Friday after the weak data.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cOther things are going on in the back room. Bond yields have moved up of late, and it was a change. It gave you a sense of how fast rates can move,\u201d said James Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Leuthold Group. \u201cIt might be a preview of what you can expect this year.\u201d\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/NdqXqj3.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/78MvG08.jpg))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/HogqBPe.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/yPgkKR9.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/o6jTeP5.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/7BeafeZ.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/zGNf0yh.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/MhhsYpF.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/yhXOGJz.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/1E2Rohq.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/a74UeZP.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/a97ysV9.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/skrsU4T.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Martin Luther King Jr. Holiday Week Trading: Leans Bearish\n\n&gt; Although Martin Luther King Jr. Day was a holiday in many states and cities throughout the U.S. beginning in 1971, it did not become a federal holiday until 1986. Even then it was not observed by the NYSE until 1998. In the 23 years since, the market\u2019s performance during this four-trading-day week has been somewhat lackluster with average weekly performance negative for DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ, Russell 1000 and Russell 2000. Average losses range from 0.81% by DJIA to 0.16% by NASDAQ. Of the five indexes, not one has a record better than 50/50. However, since 2012 performance has shown signs of improving. DJIA, NASDAQ and Russell 2000 have risen in six of the last nine years. S&amp;P 500 and Russell 1000 have climbed in five of the last eight.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/67df4ce1594bee9748fb885a5316ff07/b5f21cb74511d020-c9/s500x750/218ed920ea1a67d95ff97fd05a5b9bbdf2454805.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Seasonal Soft Patch Ahead Starting Next Week\n\n&gt; With nine trading sessions of the New Year complete, January and 2021 are off to a solid start. DJIA is up 1.26% as of today\u2019s close, S&amp;P 500 stands at 1.05%, NASDAQ 1.74% and small caps, measured by the Russell 2000 are up a whopping 9.14%. These gains all point to and confirm the return of seasonality that we have recently noted.\n\n&gt; Last September was weak as it has historically been, then October exhibited it historical tendency toward volatility while November and December were both positive, in line with typical seasonal patterns. A positive Santa Claus Rally and First Five Days are also encouraging indications that seasonal forces are once again tracking. We expect seasonality will continue to present itself going forward as extraordinary efforts are made to quell the pandemic and return to a pre-Covid, open-for-business, way of life.\n\n&gt; Due to the reemergence of seasonality, we would not be surprised to see some market weakness in the second half of January next week that could persist throughout the rest of January and possible spill over into February. In the following seasonal pattern chart of January, the last 21 years of data for DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ, Russell 1000 and 2000 have been plotted with January 2021 through today\u2019s close plotted on the right vertical axis.\n\n&gt; Over the last 21 years, it has been NASDAQ leading at the halfway point, this year it is Russell 2000. Other than that, the major indexes have been tracking their historical patterns fairly well. There was strength early on, followed by sideways action. Should the current trend follow historical patterns then weakness after the eleventh trading day (January 18) is possible.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/c921e48e1e14dd8a61d2ad5cc18d7f94/f775f74bce597bb1-b6/s500x750/409599af0a5ca5a6fbb2ba71a5b1ead87d5852f8.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 5 Charts on the Democratic Blue Wave\n\n&gt; One of the top questions we\u2019ve received recently has been what a blue wave may mean for investments. After the Democrats won the two Senate runoff elections in Georgia, they will now control the White House and both chambers of Congress. Our January 11 Market Policy Projections for 2021 gave some of the immediate and longer-term policy impacts of the Democratic \u201cblue wave,\u201d and here we surf the blue wave with some interesting charts.\n\n&gt; First off, blue waves have not been bearish for stocks, with the S&amp;P 500 Index higher 6 of the past 7 times and up a respectable 9.1% on average since 1950.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Blog-1.15.21-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; We shared this chart in 2020, and it shows that historically, stocks do better if an incumbent president wins versus a new president in office. This makes sense, as a new president will bring in new policies and likely question marks\u2014while you know what you will get with a re-elected president.

In fact, stocks do quite well that first year under such circumstances, up nearly 12% on average,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cMaybe investors shouldn\u2019t fear a blue wave after all.\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, when a new Democratic president has brought with them the House and Senate, stocks gained that first year of their new presidency 6 of 8 times. What stands out to us for 2021, though, is the House majority is only 11\u2014the smallest for a new Democratic president since 1900.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/blog-1.15.21-3.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Looking at all of the times the Democrats controlled the House (since the 35th Congress when it was Democrats and Republicans), the 11-seat majority is the lowest since 9 seats in 1879. Yes, the Democrats are in power, but this small majority will make it very tough for any of the more extreme policies to pass.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Econ-blog-1.15.21-4.png?ssl=1)**\n\n&gt; Lastly, the Senate is split a perfect 50/50, which is again extremely rare. In the chart below we share the seat difference between the two parties. \u201cA 50/50 Senate coupled with only an 11-seat majority in the House, and it is safe to say we have about as close to a perfectly divided government as we\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d said Detrick.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Econ-blog-1.15.21-5.png?ssl=1)**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Rest of the World Catching Up\n\n&gt; Over the past year, US equities\u2014proxied by the S&amp;P 500 (SPY)\u2014have consistently outperformed global equities more broadly. As shown below, over the past year the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) has risen just over 16%. That compares to 11.26% for the rest of the world as proxied by the Vanguard FTSE All-World ex US ETF (VEU). Breaking that down a bit further by developed and emerging markets, US equities have outpaced both emerging and other developed markets. While emerging markets (SPEM) are right on the heels of the US with just under a 14.78% gain, developed markets (SPDW) have lagged with just a 10.56% gain. So far in 2021, though, the rest of the world has been outperforming the US. Whereas SPY has risen around 1% YTD, VEU is up almost 3 times that. Emerging markets in particular have shown the greatest degree of strength currently having risen 3.87%. Meanwhile, SPDW has gained less (2.7%), though, it is still outperforming the US.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/01/011221-ETFs.png))**\n\n&gt; In the charts below, we show the ratio of SPY to these other ETFs. A rising line would indicate that the US is outperforming these other measures of global equities while a downward trending line indicates underperformance of SPY. As shown, the longer-term trend has pretty consistently been US outperformance over the past decade but that has faltered at the tail end of 2020 and into 2021. In the case of emerging markets, the line has been on the decline throughout the second half of 2020 as the ratio has hit its lowest level in a year in the past week. The S&amp;P 500's underperformance relative to other developed markets (SPDW) has been more recent as that line peaked in early September but the trend remains the same over the past few months with SPY weaker than global equities more broadly. That is further exemplified by the recent downtrend of SPY versus the All World ex US ETF (VEU).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/01/011221-RS2.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Small Business Owners Didn't Like the Election Results\n\n&gt; Today's release of the December Small Business Optimism Index from the NFIB saw a large drop as the index dropped from 101.4 to 95.9. After a sharp drop in the wake of the COVID outbreak, the index bounced back nicely but now looks like it's really rolling over.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/01/011221-NFIB-Small-Business-Chart.png))**\n\n&gt; Not only was this month's headline index weak, but it caught economists completely off guard. While the index fell to 95.9, economists were expecting a drop to 100.2. That 4.3 spread between the actual and expected reading was the biggest miss relative to expectations in more than five years (July 2015) and was the third weakest reading relative to expectations since the December 2012 report.\n\n&gt; Given the big drop in the headline index and the fact that it was so weak relative to expectations, should we be concerned about a double-dip? As an investor, we should always be worried about what could go wrong, but in the case of this report, you can probably wait for further confirmation from other data. The reason for the skepticism is that you could argue that politics plays a role in this report. To illustrate this, we would note that going back to 2010 (as far back as we have data) and right up through Election Day 2016, the NFIB only topped expectations 42% of the time. Following Trump's election in 2016, though, this index surged and has since topped expectations 63% of the time. Since Election Day 2020, though, the headline index has now missed expectations three times.\n\n&gt; From a longer-term perspective, dating back to 1974, the average reading of the NFIB Small Business Index during Republican administrations has been 100.1 while the average level under Democratic Presidents has been 96.2. Now, that would make sense if the economy was also in a recession more often in those periods, but over that same span, even though the percentages are low for both political parties (&lt;20%), the economy has actually been in a recession a higher percentage of the time during Republican administrations than it has in Democratic administrations.\n\n&gt; The lesson to take from all this is that even if it's often hard to separate when it comes to business or investing (or a lot of other aspects of our lives for that matter), it's usually best to leave politics outside.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/01/011221-NFIB-Small-Business-Survey.png))**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/yhXOGJz.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/DAPsqr2.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MOST ANTICIPATED EARNINGS RELEASES FOR FINANCIAL COMPANIES ONLY FOR THE NEXT 4 WEEKS!](https://i.imgur.com/aC5hzkZ.jpg))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MOST ANTICIPATED EARNINGS RELEASES FOR NASDAQ 100 COMPANIES ONLY FOR THE NEXT 4 WEEKS!](https://i.imgur.com/zIQniHK.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 1.18.21 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.

        "selftext": "Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/smallstreetbets. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning January 18th, 2021.\n\n# **Biden heads into inauguration with a stock market tailwind - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/15/biden-heads-into-inauguration-with-a-stock-market-tailwind.html)**\n*****\n&gt; President-elect Joe Biden moves into the White House in the coming week with the biggest stock market tailwind since a presidential Election Day going back to at least 1952.\n*****\n&gt; According to CFRA data that begins that year, the near 13% gain since Nov. 3 would be the biggest increase in the S&amp;P 500 between the election and inauguration if the gains hold. President John F. Kennedy\u2019s 8.8% gain had been the best, followed by President Dwight Eisenhower, with 6.3%, and President Donald Trump, with 6.2%.\n*****\n&gt; Biden\u2019s promise of the $1.9 trillion relief package he announced Thursday is one of the reasons for the stock market\u2019s surge, and it will be a big focus of markets in the week ahead as investors handicap its chances of winning congressional approval.\n*****\n&gt; The Martin Luther King Jr. Day holiday starts off the week, and over the next four days several dozen S&amp;P 500 companies report earnings. Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, IBM, Intel and Procter &amp; Gamble are among the companies reporting.\n*****\n&gt; # Biden will have no honeymoon\nThe $1.9 trillion stimulus package is at the top of the agenda. But there is also significant focus on whether his administration will be better at controlling the pandemic and rolling out the vaccine, as he has promised.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThis is the number he came in at. Where do negotiations go from here?\u201d Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial, said of the $1.9 trillion package. She pointed to worries about a weakening economy, evident in December\u2019s retail sales data, down a surprising 0.7%, and weekly jobless claims, at the worst level since August.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cYou could argue this is Covid-related and therefore what is most important going forward is to see the logistics of the vaccines, inoculations gain orderly momentum. That is crucial for the market,\u201d she said.\n*****\n&gt; Krosby said the market is focused on the inauguration.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThey want to see it go smoothly, and that there\u2019s not any security lapse. The market absorbed the events of Jan. 6. The market looked ahead and figured out that at this point it was a one-off, and the market ended higher on Jan. 6,\u201d she said. \u201cBut always the market becomes much more defensive if what we considered an isolated event suddenly broadens out.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; There will be heightened security surrounding the inauguration after a mob of Trump supporters assaulted the Capitol while Congress was in the process of confirming the Electoral College vote. The House last week voted to impeach Trump for inciting the mob, and now there is concern about further incidents in Washington or at state capitals.\n*****\n&gt; # Stimulus and stocks\nMarkets are also watching carefully to see whether Biden can bridge some of the deep divide between Republicans and Democrats, who now hold a thin majority in Congress.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe\u2019re getting stimulus, and now the question is \u2018OK, you\u2019re supposed to be this great compromiser,\u2019\u201d said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA.\n*****\n&gt; Political strategists expect Biden will get his stimulus package but it will be trimmed down. Ed Mills, Washington policy analyst at Raymond James, said the package could be cut to about $1 trillion based on the size previously discussed by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and outgoing Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cDoes Congress want to have a bipartisan show of support after what has been an extraordinarily tenuous beginning of this year, to put it mildly?\u201d Mills said. He said the stock market should continue to do well because it is going to get stimulus spending.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cD.C. is going to be there with more spending, or consumers are going to be there with more spending if they have the ability to get to a post-vaccine world sooner,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; Stovall said that if history is a guide, the stock market should do well with Biden. The average gain of the S&amp;P 500 in the first 100 days for Democratic presidents is 3.5%, going back to 1952. For Republicans in the same period, it\u2019s been an average 0.5%.\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 has also gained an average 11.3% in the first year of a Democratic president, but just 5.7% for Republicans, going back to World War II.\n*****\n&gt; The stock market will continue to monitor the bond market, after the 10-year Treasury yield reached a high of 1.18% this past week, the highest since March. It since slid back to about 1.08% Friday after the weak data.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cOther things are going on in the back room. Bond yields have moved up of late, and it was a change. It gave you a sense of how fast rates can move,\u201d said James Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Leuthold Group. \u201cIt might be a preview of what you can expect this year.\u201d\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/NdqXqj3.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/78MvG08.jpg))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/HogqBPe.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/yPgkKR9.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/o6jTeP5.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/7BeafeZ.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/zGNf0yh.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/MhhsYpF.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/yhXOGJz.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/1E2Rohq.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/a74UeZP.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/a97ysV9.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/skrsU4T.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Martin Luther King Jr. Holiday Week Trading: Leans Bearish\n\n&gt; Although Martin Luther King Jr. Day was a holiday in many states and cities throughout the U.S. beginning in 1971, it did not become a federal holiday until 1986. Even then it was not observed by the NYSE until 1998. In the 23 years since, the market\u2019s performance during this four-trading-day week has been somewhat lackluster with average weekly performance negative for DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ, Russell 1000 and Russell 2000. Average losses range from 0.81% by DJIA to 0.16% by NASDAQ. Of the five indexes, not one has a record better than 50/50. However, since 2012 performance has shown signs of improving. DJIA, NASDAQ and Russell 2000 have risen in six of the last nine years. S&amp;P 500 and Russell 1000 have climbed in five of the last eight.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/67df4ce1594bee9748fb885a5316ff07/b5f21cb74511d020-c9/s500x750/218ed920ea1a67d95ff97fd05a5b9bbdf2454805.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Seasonal Soft Patch Ahead Starting Next Week\n\n&gt; With nine trading sessions of the New Year complete, January and 2021 are off to a solid start. DJIA is up 1.26% as of today\u2019s close, S&amp;P 500 stands at 1.05%, NASDAQ 1.74% and small caps, measured by the Russell 2000 are up a whopping 9.14%. These gains all point to and confirm the return of seasonality that we have recently noted.\n\n&gt; Last September was weak as it has historically been, then October exhibited it historical tendency toward volatility while November and December were both positive, in line with typical seasonal patterns. A positive Santa Claus Rally and First Five Days are also encouraging indications that seasonal forces are once again tracking. We expect seasonality will continue to present itself going forward as extraordinary efforts are made to quell the pandemic and return to a pre-Covid, open-for-business, way of life.\n\n&gt; Due to the reemergence of seasonality, we would not be surprised to see some market weakness in the second half of January next week that could persist throughout the rest of January and possible spill over into February. In the following seasonal pattern chart of January, the last 21 years of data for DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ, Russell 1000 and 2000 have been plotted with January 2021 through today\u2019s close plotted on the right vertical axis.\n\n&gt; Over the last 21 years, it has been NASDAQ leading at the halfway point, this year it is Russell 2000. Other than that, the major indexes have been tracking their historical patterns fairly well. There was strength early on, followed by sideways action. Should the current trend follow historical patterns then weakness after the eleventh trading day (January 18) is possible.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/c921e48e1e14dd8a61d2ad5cc18d7f94/f775f74bce597bb1-b6/s500x750/409599af0a5ca5a6fbb2ba71a5b1ead87d5852f8.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 5 Charts on the Democratic Blue Wave\n\n&gt; One of the top questions we\u2019ve received recently has been what a blue wave may mean for investments. After the Democrats won the two Senate runoff elections in Georgia, they will now control the White House and both chambers of Congress. Our January 11 Market Policy Projections for 2021 gave some of the immediate and longer-term policy impacts of the Democratic \u201cblue wave,\u201d and here we surf the blue wave with some interesting charts.\n\n&gt; First off, blue waves have not been bearish for stocks, with the S&amp;P 500 Index higher 6 of the past 7 times and up a respectable 9.1% on average since 1950.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Blog-1.15.21-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; We shared this chart in 2020, and it shows that historically, stocks do better if an incumbent president wins versus a new president in office. This makes sense, as a new president will bring in new policies and likely question marks\u2014while you know what you will get with a re-elected president. Remember, markets hate uncertainty and surprises.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Econ-blog-1.15.21-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; \u201cMake it all nine new Democratic presidents since 1900 to bring with them both the House and the Senate. In fact, stocks do quite well that first year under such circumstances, up nearly 12% on average,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cMaybe investors shouldn\u2019t fear a blue wave after all.\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, when a new Democratic president has brought with them the House and Senate, stocks gained that first year of their new presidency 6 of 8 times. What stands out to us for 2021, though, is the House majority is only 11\u2014the smallest for a new Democratic president since 1900.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/blog-1.15.21-3.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Looking at all of the times the Democrats controlled the House (since the 35th Congress when it was Democrats and Republicans), the 11-seat majority is the lowest since 9 seats in 1879. Yes, the Democrats are in power, but this small majority will make it very tough for any of the more extreme policies to pass.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Econ-blog-1.15.21-4.png?ssl=1)**\n\n&gt; Lastly, the Senate is split a perfect 50/50, which is again extremely rare. In the chart below we share the seat difference between the two parties. \u201cA 50/50 Senate coupled with only an 11-seat majority in the House, and it is safe to say we have about as close to a perfectly divided government as we\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d said Detrick.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Econ-blog-1.15.21-5.png?ssl=1)**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Rest of the World Catching Up\n\n&gt; Over the past year, US equities\u2014proxied by the S&amp;P 500 (SPY)\u2014have consistently outperformed global equities more broadly. As shown below, over the past year the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) has risen just over 16%. That compares to 11.26% for the rest of the world as proxied by the Vanguard FTSE All-World ex US ETF (VEU). Breaking that down a bit further by developed and emerging markets, US equities have outpaced both emerging and other developed markets. While emerging markets (SPEM) are right on the heels of the US with just under a 14.78% gain, developed markets (SPDW) have lagged with just a 10.56% gain. So far in 2021, though, the rest of the world has been outperforming the US. Whereas SPY has risen around 1% YTD, VEU is up almost 3 times that. Emerging markets in particular have shown the greatest degree of strength currently having risen 3.87%. Meanwhile, SPDW has gained less (2.7%), though, it is still outperforming the US.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/01/011221-ETFs.png))**\n\n&gt; In the charts below, we show the ratio of SPY to these other ETFs. A rising line would indicate that the US is outperforming these other measures of global equities while a downward trending line indicates underperformance of SPY. As shown, the longer-term trend has pretty consistently been US outperformance over the past decade but that has faltered at the tail end of 2020 and into 2021. In the case of emerging markets, the line has been on the decline throughout the second half of 2020 as the ratio has hit its lowest level in a year in the past week. The S&amp;P 500's underperformance relative to other developed markets (SPDW) has been more recent as that line peaked in early September but the trend remains the same over the past few months with SPY weaker than global equities more broadly. That is further exemplified by the recent downtrend of SPY versus the All World ex US ETF (VEU).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/01/011221-RS2.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Small Business Owners Didn't Like the Election Results\n\n&gt; Today's release of the December Small Business Optimism Index from the NFIB saw a large drop as the index dropped from 101.4 to 95.9. After a sharp drop in the wake of the COVID outbreak, the index bounced back nicely but now looks like it's really rolling over.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/01/011221-NFIB-Small-Business-Chart.png))**\n\n&gt; Not only was this month's headline index weak, but it caught economists completely off guard. While the index fell to 95.9, economists were expecting a drop to 100.2. That 4.3 spread between the actual and expected reading was the biggest miss relative to expectations in more than five years (July 2015) and was the third weakest reading relative to expectations since the December 2012 report.\n\n&gt; Given the big drop in the headline index and the fact that it was so weak relative to expectations, should we be concerned about a double-dip? As an investor, we should always be worried about what could go wrong, but in the case of this report, you can probably wait for further confirmation from other data. The reason for the skepticism is that you could argue that politics plays a role in this report. To illustrate this, we would note that going back to 2010 (as far back as we have data) and right up through Election Day 2016, the NFIB only topped expectations 42% of the time. Following Trump's election in 2016, though, this index surged and has since topped expectations 63% of the time. Since Election Day 2020, though, the headline index has now missed expectations three times.\n\n&gt; From a longer-term perspective, dating back to 1974, the average reading of the NFIB Small Business Index during Republican administrations has been 100.1 while the average level under Democratic Presidents has been 96.2. Now, that would make sense if the economy was also in a recession more often in those periods, but over that same span, even though the percentages are low for both political parties (&lt;20%), the economy has actually been in a recession a higher percentage of the time during Republican administrations than it has in Democratic administrations.\n\n&gt; The lesson to take from all this is that even if it's often hard to separate when it comes to business or investing (or a lot of other aspects of our lives for that matter), it's usually best to leave politics outside.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/01/011221-NFIB-Small-Business-Survey.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending January 15th, 2021** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmx1VYd-S_k))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 1.17.21**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED!)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$NFLX** \n&gt; * **$BAC** \n&gt; * **$FCEL** \n&gt; * **$GS** \n&gt; * **$PG** \n&gt; * **$INTC** \n&gt; * **$SCHW** \n&gt; * **$UNH** \n&gt; * **$MS** \n&gt; * **$HAL** \n&gt; * **$FAST** \n&gt; * **$CMA** \n&gt; * **$STT** \n&gt; * **$ASML** \n&gt; * **$UAL** \n&gt; * **$ONB** \n&gt; * **$IBM** \n&gt; * **$TFC** \n&gt; * **$JBHT** \n&gt; * **$MBWM** \n&gt; * **$CTXS** \n&gt; * **$USB** \n&gt; * **$UNP** \n&gt; * **$ALLY** \n&gt; * **$TRV** \n&gt; * **$BK** \n&gt; * **$AA** \n&gt; * **$LOGI** \n&gt; * **$SLB** \n&gt; * **$ZION** \n&gt; * **$CFG** \n&gt; * **$KEY** \n&gt; * **$FBC** \n&gt; * **$ISRG** \n&gt; * **$IBKR** \n&gt; * **$FHN** \n&gt; * **$BKR** \n&gt; * **$KMI** \n&gt; * **$NTRS** \n&gt; * **$DFS** \n&gt; * **$CSX** \n&gt; * **$EDU** \n&gt; * **$HOMB**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/yhXOGJz.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/DAPsqr2.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MOST ANTICIPATED EARNINGS RELEASES FOR FINANCIAL COMPANIES ONLY FOR THE NEXT 4 WEEKS!](https://i.imgur.com/aC5hzkZ.jpg))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MOST ANTICIPATED EARNINGS RELEASES FOR NASDAQ 100 COMPANIES ONLY FOR THE NEXT 4 WEEKS!](https://i.imgur.com/zIQniHK.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 1.18.21 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.

FuboTv keeps on crumbling while NIO posts great sales numbers, let\u2019s talk about this &amp; other stock market news**\n\nHello everyone and Good Morning! So, let\u2019s start with the recap of the last trading day of 2020, as we saw both the broad stock market [SP500](https://ibb.co/bHgX2sf) and the [Dow Jones Industrial](https://ibb.co/D471c7X) finish up over 0.60% and finishing at record highs, while the tech heavy [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/vzGgSBb)  finished barely up for the day, gaining .14%. We also saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/2YrvMpT) finishing just down for the day, but it\u2019s still up from a [week](https://ibb.co/LxdGJ8c) ago, as the volatility still remains way above the [levels](https://ibb.co/XbWkzW4) before March when it rose to over 80.\n\nWe just about saw a positive ratio of companies [advancing](https://ibb.co/5TwrM2m) to close out the year as the volume was belove average with just 100 new highs, as we saw 10 of the 11 [sectors](https://ibb.co/yyrTGGP) finishing in the green with Utilities, Financials, Real Estate &amp; Health Care gaining more than 1% while Energy was the only sector to finish the day with a loss.  \nWe also saw most factor groups [finishing](https://ibb.co/dmvNJgL) the day in the red with only Large-Cap Value companies posting a gain of .3%, as you can see in Thursday\u2019s [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/wBGr7cR) with gains all around the board, while losses were concentrated in the Biotech and Oil &amp; Gas industry.\n\nHere is the weekly [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/zQWD12B) with names like Alibaba, Shopify, Palantir, Square and Zoom being some of the biggest losers, while TESLA continued to push higher as Tesla finished the month of [December](https://ibb.co/ZX09X8Z) with a gain of more than 20% as you can see here, while many of the other big tech names also had a strong month, with most of the losses being concentrated in the communication sector and of course Alibaba which was hit by a lot of negative news.\n\nWe also [finished](https://ibb.co/r5JRk5b) the year with most sectors in the green as you can see here, led by Technology, Consumer Cyclicals and Communications. But gains were had in most other sectors as well, except the Financial, Travel and Energy sectors, which finished the year down.\n\nThe biggest [losers](https://ibb.co/nDgRs1S) in the SP500 which finished the year up more than 16% were by far stocks like Carnival, OXY, Norwegian Cruise Line, United Airlines and many more others. The Nasdaq 100 wasn\u2019t safe either despite jumping almost 50% in 2020, having the best gains in 11years, with companies like Walgreens, Fox and Intel posting losses of over 17%, while the Dow was the laggard finishing just over 7% up for the year as Boeing, Chevron and Intel dragged the index lower.\n\nWe also saw huge [winners](https://ibb.co/n7yP7cM)  in 2020, as the SP500 was led higher by stocks like Apple, Nvidia, PayPal, Amazon and many others that posted huge gains. While the Nasdaq 100 jumped to record highs lead by Tesla which posted an incredible year with other stocks like Moderna, Peloton &amp; Zoom also rising by more than 300%. The Dow also had big winners but still lagged as the biggest gainers here were the tech giants Apple &amp; Microsoft joined by some other stocks like Nike, Disney &amp; Salesforce.\n\nWe also got some economic data since Thursday as Macau\u2019s gaming [revenue](https://ibb.co/NWBrC3s) continued the slow recovery, but the visits in the travel dependent region were 20% higher in the Holiday period compared to the start of December, which may be another positive sign for the Macau Gambling business.\n\nMeanwhile we also received the latest jobless [numbers](https://ibb.co/Km8px8X), which dipped below 800K again, 19K less than last week and more than 40K less than expected, as the continuing jobless claims also fell to just over 5.2M more than 100K better than expected and the previous [report](https://ibb.co/gJLQYPB).\n\nWhile this [week](https://ibb.co/mDnXFZY) we start to receive important economic data that alongside the results of the Georgia runoff election might push the market either to more gains, or if the results and data don\u2019t show up as investors &amp; analysts expected it, we might see an increase in volatility again which will lead to a market pullback or correction, which in my opinion would be a good time to go out and find deals to buy again.\n\nWe also really don\u2019t get any significant [earnings](https://ibb.co/60QM77h) releases this week, with most of the interesting ones like Micron, Walgreens &amp; Bed Bath &amp; Beyond coming on Thursday.\n\nSo, in some other stock market news, Tesla topped [expectations](https://ibb.co/g9048Ry) of 163K deliveries in Q4 again but did finish just shy of the 500K mark. The company delivered more than 180K vehicle in the last quarter, as we saw [Tesla](https://ibb.co/th7Hhnc)  pricing the model Y at just over $50.000 in China and are expecting to start deliveries this month as they keep expanding their sales in the world\u2019s biggest car market, as they are targeting to make this their biggest market surpassing the US. Tesla closed over 700$ for the first time and if you want to see my opinion on this stock, check out my prediction on Tesla [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/kci399/my_tesla_stock_price_predictions_buy_or_sell/).\n\nSome other EV makers from China also posted sales numbers with [Li Auto](https://ibb.co/LYCSs1N) increasing deliveries five-fold year/year with a 32% increase month/month in December, while [XPENG](https://ibb.co/Zc7FSQC) also announced record delivery numbers up 35% month/month and more than 300% year/year for December. We also saw [NIO](https://ibb.co/4VWGX78) posting a monthly deliveries record of just over 7K, up over 120% year/year and finishing the year with over 43K deliveries, which were also up over 110% year/year, as they are also planning on revealing some new sedan models and their latest developments on self-driving and other technologies next week.\n\nMeanwhile we saw [Lemonade](https://ibb.co/dKh6kx0) take a ride after another short-seller released a statement, pointing out to the final lock-up period after the IPO, as a moment that will bring huge selling to this stock, despite the [company](https://ibb.co/YWksq6g) needing just over 4 years to reach the first million customers, less than 5 times the time it took companies like StateFarm, Geico and Allstate to reach their first million. I personally am an investor in this company, and I really like what they are doing, so I am not going to sell my shares anytime soon.\n\nGuys, personally I can\u2019t wait to see the sales numbers and how the services business is growing for [Apple](https://ibb.co/cx07jJs) as the top-of-the-line products keep having great demand, but we do have to see what happens in the US-China relations, as this could impact the Apple revenue stream, this after the New York Stock Exchange has [started](https://ibb.co/599nrxc) the process of delisting telecom giants from China. You can check out my prediction on Apple [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/kmp7x1/apple_aapl_stock_price_predictions_buy_or_sell/)\n\nWe also saw a [memo](https://ibb.co/qyBfzrq) from DELTA\u2019s CEO, as he expects the company to return to positive cashflow in the spring, as they are planning to start paying down debt as soon as that happens to reduce the burden the company has taken on since March 2020.\n\nMeanwhile [FuboTV](https://ibb.co/Dg5jZ6x) continues its sharp decline after a number of firms have started to short the stock pointing to insane valuations and outlook. Fubo plunged again almost 16% Thursday and is down almost 50% in the past week as the IPO lockup period expired, more than tripling the shares float.\n\nAnd on last piece of news that just came out is that [Roku](https://ibb.co/gM8Z4Bv) is looking to buy the content catalog from Quibi, this would give a boost to Roku\u2019s exclusive programming, as the stock has seen an immediate reaction and is up over 3.5% in pre-market trading.\n\nLet\u2019s hope for a good day in the market as US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/zf9tMYZ) seem to be pointing at a good open, with the SP500 leading the way to start off the year as we wait to receive the first economic [data](https://ibb.co/f24tRCS) this year in the early morning, while the global stock [markets](https://ibb.co/sjvZMrx) started on a positive note except Japan.\n\nThank you everyone for reading!

The Dow also had big winners but still lagged as the biggest gainers here were the tech giants Apple &amp; Microsoft joined by some other stocks like Nike, Disney &amp; Salesforce.\n\nWe also got some economic data since Thursday as Macau\u2019s gaming [revenue](https://ibb.co/NWBrC3s) continued the slow recovery, but the visits in the travel dependent region were 20% higher in the Holiday period compared to the start of December, which may be another positive sign for the Macau Gambling business.\n\nMeanwhile we also received the latest jobless [numbers](https://ibb.co/Km8px8X), which dipped below 800K again, 19K less than last week and more than 40K less than expected, as the continuing jobless claims also fell to just over 5.2M more than 100K better than expected and the previous [report](https://ibb.co/gJLQYPB).\n\nWhile this [week](https://ibb.co/mDnXFZY) we start to receive important economic data that alongside the results of the Georgia runoff election might push the market either to more gains, or if the results and data don\u2019t show up as investors &amp; analysts expected it, we might see an increase in volatility again which will lead to a market pullback or correction, which in my opinion would be a good time to go out and find deals to buy again.\n\nWe also really don\u2019t get any significant [earnings](https://ibb.co/60QM77h) releases this week, with most of the interesting ones like Micron, Walgreens &amp; Bed Bath &amp; Beyond coming on Thursday.\n\nSo, in some other stock market news, Tesla topped [expectations](https://ibb.co/g9048Ry) of 163K deliveries in Q4 again but did finish just shy of the 500K mark. The company delivered more than 180K vehicle in the last quarter, as we saw [Tesla](https://ibb.co/th7Hhnc) pricing the model Y at just over $50.000 in China and are expecting to start deliveries this month as they keep expanding their sales in the world\u2019s biggest car market, as they are targeting to make this their biggest market surpassing the US. Tesla closed over 700$ for the first time and if you want to see my opinion on this stock, check out my prediction on Tesla [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/kcjd36/my_tesla_stock_price_predictions_buy_or_sell/).\n\nSome other EV makers from China also posted sales numbers with [Li Auto](https://ibb.co/LYCSs1N) increasing deliveries five-fold year/year with a 32% increase month/month in December, while [XPENG](https://ibb.co/Zc7FSQC) also announced record delivery numbers up 35% month/month and more than 300% year/year for December. We also saw [NIO](https://ibb.co/4VWGX78) posting a monthly deliveries record of just over 7K, up over 120% year/year and finishing the year with over 43K deliveries, which were also up over 110% year/year, as they are also planning on revealing some new sedan models and their latest developments on self-driving and other technologies next week.\n\nMeanwhile we saw [Lemonade](https://ibb.co/dKh6kx0) take a ride after another short-seller released a statement, pointing out to the final lock-up period after the IPO, as a moment that will bring huge selling to this stock, despite the [company](https://ibb.co/YWksq6g) needing just over 4 years to reach the first million customers, less than 5 times the time it took companies like StateFarm, Geico and Allstate to reach their first million. I personally am an investor in this company, and I really like what they are doing, so I am not going to sell my shares anytime soon.\n\nGuys, personally I can\u2019t wait to see the sales numbers and how the services business is growing for [Apple](https://ibb.co/cx07jJs) as the top-of-the-line products keep having great demand, but we do have to see what happens in the US-China relations, as this could impact the Apple revenue stream, this after the New York Stock Exchange has [started](https://ibb.co/599nrxc) the process of delisting telecom giants from China. You can check out my prediction on Apple [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/kmoxky/apple_aapl_stock_price_predictions_buy_or_sell/)\n\nWe also saw a [memo](https://ibb.co/qyBfzrq) from DELTA\u2019s CEO, as he expects the company to return to positive cashflow in the spring, as they are planning to start paying down debt as soon as that happens to reduce the burden the company has taken on since March 2020.\n\nMeanwhile [FuboTV](https://ibb.co/Dg5jZ6x) continues its sharp decline after a number of firms have started to short the stock pointing to insane valuations and outlook. Fubo plunged again almost 16% Thursday and is down almost 50% in the past week as the IPO lockup period expired, more than tripling the shares float.\n\nAnd on last piece of news that just came out is that [Roku](https://ibb.co/gM8Z4Bv) is looking to buy the content catalog from Quibi, this would give a boost to Roku\u2019s exclusive programming, as the stock has seen an immediate reaction and is up over 3.5% in pre-market trading.\n\nLet\u2019s hope for a good day in the market as US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/zf9tMYZ) seem to be pointing at a good open, with the SP500 leading the way to start off the year as we wait to receive the first economic [data](https://ibb.co/f24tRCS) this year in the early morning, while the global stock [markets](https://ibb.co/sjvZMrx) started on a positive note except Japan.\n\nThank you everyone for reading!

        "selftext": "References to begin with:\n\n* [A short recent video interview with the CEO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YD_OY9Enww)\n* [Investor presentation](https://www.achronix.com/sites/default/files/docs/Achronix_Ace_Merger_Presentation_VF.pdf)  PDF\n* [DD post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SPACs/comments/ktdtzp/dd_acev_achronix_is_a_strong_buy/) by  [u/kaizenn7](https://www.reddit.com/user/kaizenn7/)  \n* A[ recent presentation in a conference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQezG9H9qbE) \\- 30 min, a bit more technical but I personally found it interesting.\n\nMy 2 cents: \n\n1. **The elephant in the room - why did the stock go down 5% on announcement?** I think it's this business with intel - from the investor presentation, it seems all of the 2020 revenue was from selling the speedster22i chip (old version) - apparently to intel... So is this a complete red flag? Obviously, it would be better to see a diversified client base. But you could also look at this as a startup (see point 2) with the intel deals being proof of competence. Tell me what you think.  ---- Side point: What exactly is intel doing with these outdated chips? Is this expected to continue? Maybe someone on here has a clue. \n2. **Achronix has been trying to pivot** into a different business model of licensing their design \"fabric\" - (which is generally considered high-end - [Source](https://ww2.frost.com/news/achronix-commended-by-frost-sullivan-for-its-flexible-fpga-solutions-speedster7t-fpgas-and-speedcore-efpga-ip/) ) to allow anybody to embed FPGA into their own SOC (system on chip) or other chip/system designs. They are catering to what they expect to be a high growth market of IoT devices, edge computing devices, 5G wireless infrastructure, etc. --- Strong point: They are the only serious FPGA company to offer this currently. \n3. **One example** is the computer systems to be used in electric vehicles and autonomous driving. Autonomous driving requires AI and the algorithms are constantly changing and updates would be frequent, If you want to keep the cost +power consumption down having flexible hardware is key. The old standard was that the Autonomous driving company would have to buy the entire \"one size fits all\" FPGA chip and integrate it into their system. This adds constraints to the design and usually not all of the chip's capabilities are utilized, adding to the cost, size, and power consumption. What Achronix are predicting, is that these companies will design their own chips and add FPGA blocks to them as needed - creating better designs and saving money. Achronix will also provide technical support and the necessary design and verification tools.\n4. **Another example** included here for irony is HFT firms that use FPGAs for latency arbitrage plays, they are probably using Achronix chips to manipulate ACEV stock right now (and HCAC-GOEV OFC :). These companies are at war and every incremental improvement to their hardware means big bucks. I find it hard to believe that they will be making their own ASICs due to lack of scale - but they will buy the standalone chips.. and who knows - those guys are very discrete. \n5. Achronix will still be selling the standalone chips because (a) they are needed for the initial stages of design .i.e first you put the whole chip in, calibrate and test - then remove or add FPGA blocks as needed, and then mass produce. (b) some designers may prefer the faster easier integration of the ready-made chip. [e.g. this plug and play card for data centers](https://www.bittware.com/fpga/s7t-vg6/).  \n6. **The Big Questions are**: Will they be able to expand their client base and grow? Will there be a market for their products - how many companies are really going to be making their own custom silicon? Is the IP licensing profitable enough? They seem to have some business in the pipeline including 6 design wins (see page 24 of the investor presentation)  \\[A \"design win\" is a phrase used in the semiconductor industry to indicate that a company's chip/product has been designed into a fairly large design that will result in a lot of on-going, volume sales of the chip. It's used in similar ways in other related electronics industries. \\]",

        "selftext": "Good Friday evening to all of you here on r/StockMarket. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning January 18th, 2021.\n\n# **Biden heads into inauguration with a stock market tailwind - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/15/biden-heads-into-inauguration-with-a-stock-market-tailwind.html)**\n*****\n&gt; President-elect Joe Biden moves into the White House in the coming week with the biggest stock market tailwind since a presidential Election Day going back to at least 1952.\n*****\n&gt; According to CFRA data that begins that year, the near 13% gain since Nov. 3 would be the biggest increase in the S&amp;P 500 between the election and inauguration if the gains hold. President John F. Kennedy\u2019s 8.8% gain had been the best, followed by President Dwight Eisenhower, with 6.3%, and President Donald Trump, with 6.2%.\n*****\n&gt; Biden\u2019s promise of the $1.9 trillion relief package he announced Thursday is one of the reasons for the stock market\u2019s surge, and it will be a big focus of markets in the week ahead as investors handicap its chances of winning congressional approval.\n*****\n&gt; The Martin Luther King Jr. Day holiday starts off the week, and over the next four days several dozen S&amp;P 500 companies report earnings. Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, IBM, Intel and Procter &amp; Gamble are among the companies reporting.\n*****\n&gt; # Biden will have no honeymoon\nThe $1.9 trillion stimulus package is at the top of the agenda. But there is also significant focus on whether his administration will be better at controlling the pandemic and rolling out the vaccine, as he has promised.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThis is the number he came in at. Where do negotiations go from here?\u201d Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial, said of the $1.9 trillion package. She pointed to worries about a weakening economy, evident in December\u2019s retail sales data, down a surprising 0.7%, and weekly jobless claims, at the worst level since August.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cYou could argue this is Covid-related and therefore what is most important going forward is to see the logistics of the vaccines, inoculations gain orderly momentum. That is crucial for the market,\u201d she said.\n*****\n&gt; Krosby said the market is focused on the inauguration.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThey want to see it go smoothly, and that there\u2019s not any security lapse. The market absorbed the events of Jan. 6. The market looked ahead and figured out that at this point it was a one-off, and the market ended higher on Jan. 6,\u201d she said. \u201cBut always the market becomes much more defensive if what we considered an isolated event suddenly broadens out.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; There will be heightened security surrounding the inauguration after a mob of Trump supporters assaulted the Capitol while Congress was in the process of confirming the Electoral College vote. The House last week voted to impeach Trump for inciting the mob, and now there is concern about further incidents in Washington or at state capitals.\n*****\n&gt; # Stimulus and stocks\nMarkets are also watching carefully to see whether Biden can bridge some of the deep divide between Republicans and Democrats, who now hold a thin majority in Congress.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe\u2019re getting stimulus, and now the question is \u2018OK, you\u2019re supposed to be this great compromiser,\u2019\u201d said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA.\n*****\n&gt; Political strategists expect Biden will get his stimulus package but it will be trimmed down. Ed Mills, Washington policy analyst at Raymond James, said the package could be cut to about $1 trillion based on the size previously discussed by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and outgoing Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cDoes Congress want to have a bipartisan show of support after what has been an extraordinarily tenuous beginning of this year, to put it mildly?\u201d Mills said. He said the stock market should continue to do well because it is going to get stimulus spending.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cD.C. is going to be there with more spending, or consumers are going to be there with more spending if they have the ability to get to a post-vaccine world sooner,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; Stovall said that if history is a guide, the stock market should do well with Biden. The average gain of the S&amp;P 500 in the first 100 days for Democratic presidents is 3.5%, going back to 1952. For Republicans in the same period, it\u2019s been an average 0.5%.\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 has also gained an average 11.3% in the first year of a Democratic president, but just 5.7% for Republicans, going back to World War II.\n*****\n&gt; The stock market will continue to monitor the bond market, after the 10-year Treasury yield reached a high of 1.18% this past week, the highest since March. It since slid back to about 1.08% Friday after the weak data.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cOther things are going on in the back room. Bond yields have moved up of late, and it was a change. It gave you a sense of how fast rates can move,\u201d said James Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Leuthold Group. \u201cIt might be a preview of what you can expect this year.\u201d\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/NdqXqj3.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/78MvG08.jpg))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/HogqBPe.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/yPgkKR9.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/o6jTeP5.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/7BeafeZ.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/zGNf0yh.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/MhhsYpF.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!]())**\n(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/1E2Rohq.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/a74UeZP.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/a97ysV9.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/skrsU4T.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Martin Luther King Jr. Holiday Week Trading: Leans Bearish\n\n&gt; Although Martin Luther King Jr. Day was a holiday in many states and cities throughout the U.S. beginning in 1971, it did not become a federal holiday until 1986. Even then it was not observed by the NYSE until 1998. In the 23 years since, the market\u2019s performance during this four-trading-day week has been somewhat lackluster with average weekly performance negative for DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ, Russell 1000 and Russell 2000. Average losses range from 0.81% by DJIA to 0.16% by NASDAQ. Of the five indexes, not one has a record better than 50/50. However, since 2012 performance has shown signs of improving. DJIA, NASDAQ and Russell 2000 have risen in six of the last nine years. S&amp;P 500 and Russell 1000 have climbed in five of the last eight.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/67df4ce1594bee9748fb885a5316ff07/b5f21cb74511d020-c9/s500x750/218ed920ea1a67d95ff97fd05a5b9bbdf2454805.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Seasonal Soft Patch Ahead Starting Next Week\n\n&gt; With nine trading sessions of the New Year complete, January and 2021 are off to a solid start. DJIA is up 1.26% as of today\u2019s close, S&amp;P 500 stands at 1.05%, NASDAQ 1.74% and small caps, measured by the Russell 2000 are up a whopping 9.14%. These gains all point to and confirm the return of seasonality that we have recently noted.\n\n&gt; Last September was weak as it has historically been, then October exhibited it historical tendency toward volatility while November and December were both positive, in line with typical seasonal patterns. A positive Santa Claus Rally and First Five Days are also encouraging indications that seasonal forces are once again tracking. We expect seasonality will continue to present itself going forward as extraordinary efforts are made to quell the pandemic and return to a pre-Covid, open-for-business, way of life.\n\n&gt; Due to the reemergence of seasonality, we would not be surprised to see some market weakness in the second half of January next week that could persist throughout the rest of January and possible spill over into February. In the following seasonal pattern chart of January, the last 21 years of data for DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ, Russell 1000 and 2000 have been plotted with January 2021 through today\u2019s close plotted on the right vertical axis.\n\n&gt; Over the last 21 years, it has been NASDAQ leading at the halfway point, this year it is Russell 2000. Other than that, the major indexes have been tracking their historical patterns fairly well. There was strength early on, followed by sideways action. Should the current trend follow historical patterns then weakness after the eleventh trading day (January 18) is possible.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/c921e48e1e14dd8a61d2ad5cc18d7f94/f775f74bce597bb1-b6/s500x750/409599af0a5ca5a6fbb2ba71a5b1ead87d5852f8.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 5 Charts on the Democratic Blue Wave\n\n&gt; One of the top questions we\u2019ve received recently has been what a blue wave may mean for investments. After the Democrats won the two Senate runoff elections in Georgia, they will now control the White House and both chambers of Congress. Our January 11 Market Policy Projections for 2021 gave some of the immediate and longer-term policy impacts of the Democratic \u201cblue wave,\u201d and here we surf the blue wave with some interesting charts.\n\n&gt; First off, blue waves have not been bearish for stocks, with the S&amp;P 500 Index higher 6 of the past 7 times and up a respectable 9.1% on average since 1950.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Blog-1.15.21-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; We shared this chart in 2020, and it shows that historically, stocks do better if an incumbent president wins versus a new president in office. This makes sense, as a new president will bring in new policies and likely question marks\u2014while you know what you will get with a re-elected president. Remember, markets hate uncertainty and surprises.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Econ-blog-1.15.21-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; \u201cMake it all nine new Democratic presidents since 1900 to bring with them both the House and the Senate. In fact, stocks do quite well that first year under such circumstances, up nearly 12% on average,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cMaybe investors shouldn\u2019t fear a blue wave after all.\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, when a new Democratic president has brought with them the House and Senate, stocks gained that first year of their new presidency 6 of 8 times. What stands out to us for 2021, though, is the House majority is only 11\u2014the smallest for a new Democratic president since 1900.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/blog-1.15.21-3.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Looking at all of the times the Democrats controlled the House (since the 35th Congress when it was Democrats and Republicans), the 11-seat majority is the lowest since 9 seats in 1879. Yes, the Democrats are in power, but this small majority will make it very tough for any of the more extreme policies to pass.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Econ-blog-1.15.21-4.png?ssl=1)**\n\n&gt; Lastly, the Senate is split a perfect 50/50, which is again extremely rare. In the chart below we share the seat difference between the two parties. \u201cA 50/50 Senate coupled with only an 11-seat majority in the House, and it is safe to say we have about as close to a perfectly divided government as we\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d said Detrick.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Econ-blog-1.15.21-5.png?ssl=1)**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Rest of the World Catching Up\n\n&gt; Over the past year, US equities\u2014proxied by the S&amp;P 500 (SPY)\u2014have consistently outperformed global equities more broadly. As shown below, over the past year the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) has risen just over 16%. That compares to 11.26% for the rest of the world as proxied by the Vanguard FTSE All-World ex US ETF (VEU). Breaking that down a bit further by developed and emerging markets, US equities have outpaced both emerging and other developed markets. While emerging markets (SPEM) are right on the heels of the US with just under a 14.78% gain, developed markets (SPDW) have lagged with just a 10.56% gain. So far in 2021, though, the rest of the world has been outperforming the US. Whereas SPY has risen around 1% YTD, VEU is up almost 3 times that. Emerging markets in particular have shown the greatest degree of strength currently having risen 3.87%. Meanwhile, SPDW has gained less (2.7%), though, it is still outperforming the US.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/01/011221-ETFs.png))**\n\n&gt; In the charts below, we show the ratio of SPY to these other ETFs. A rising line would indicate that the US is outperforming these other measures of global equities while a downward trending line indicates underperformance of SPY. As shown, the longer-term trend has pretty consistently been US outperformance over the past decade but that has faltered at the tail end of 2020 and into 2021. In the case of emerging markets, the line has been on the decline throughout the second half of 2020 as the ratio has hit its lowest level in a year in the past week. The S&amp;P 500's underperformance relative to other developed markets (SPDW) has been more recent as that line peaked in early September but the trend remains the same over the past few months with SPY weaker than global equities more broadly. That is further exemplified by the recent downtrend of SPY versus the All World ex US ETF (VEU).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/01/011221-RS2.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Small Business Owners Didn't Like the Election Results\n\n&gt; Today's release of the December Small Business Optimism Index from the NFIB saw a large drop as the index dropped from 101.4 to 95.9. After a sharp drop in the wake of the COVID outbreak, the index bounced back nicely but now looks like it's really rolling over.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/01/011221-NFIB-Small-Business-Chart.png))**\n\n&gt; Not only was this month's headline index weak, but it caught economists completely off guard. While the index fell to 95.9, economists were expecting a drop to 100.2. That 4.3 spread between the actual and expected reading was the biggest miss relative to expectations in more than five years (July 2015) and was the third weakest reading relative to expectations since the December 2012 report.\n\n&gt; Given the big drop in the headline index and the fact that it was so weak relative to expectations, should we be concerned about a double-dip? As an investor, we should always be worried about what could go wrong, but in the case of this report, you can probably wait for further confirmation from other data. The reason for the skepticism is that you could argue that politics plays a role in this report. To illustrate this, we would note that going back to 2010 (as far back as we have data) and right up through Election Day 2016, the NFIB only topped expectations 42% of the time. Following Trump's election in 2016, though, this index surged and has since topped expectations 63% of the time. Since Election Day 2020, though, the headline index has now missed expectations three times.\n\n&gt; From a longer-term perspective, dating back to 1974, the average reading of the NFIB Small Business Index during Republican administrations has been 100.1 while the average level under Democratic Presidents has been 96.2. Now, that would make sense if the economy was also in a recession more often in those periods, but over that same span, even though the percentages are low for both political parties (&lt;20%), the economy has actually been in a recession a higher percentage of the time during Republican administrations than it has in Democratic administrations.\n\n&gt; The lesson to take from all this is that even if it's often hard to separate when it comes to business or investing (or a lot of other aspects of our lives for that matter), it's usually best to leave politics outside.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/01/011221-NFIB-Small-Business-Survey.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending January 15th, 2021** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmx1VYd-S_k))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 1.17.21**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED!)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!]())**\n(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/JwUJdcm.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MOST ANTICIPATED EARNINGS RELEASES FOR FINANCIAL COMPANIES ONLY FOR THE NEXT 4 WEEKS!](https://i.imgur.com/aC5hzkZ.jpg))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MOST ANTICIPATED EARNINGS RELEASES FOR NASDAQ 100 COMPANIES ONLY FOR THE NEXT 4 WEEKS!](https://i.imgur.com/zIQniHK.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 1.18.21 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.

Wall Street looks to start another mixed session\n\n&gt; * Dow and S&amp;P 500 futures rose but Nasdaq futures dipped slightly Thursday, a day after a mixed session left all three stock benchmarks less than 1% from their record highs. Shortly after Wednesday\u2019s market close, the House impeached President Donald Trump for inciting an insurrection at the Capitol last week. Premarket stock reaction was relatively muted because the House vote was widely expected.\n\n&gt; * Investors will also focus on the Labor Department\u2019s weekly jobless claims data at 8:30 a.m. ET. Economists are calling for a rise to 800,000 in weekly new filings for unemployment benefits.\n\n&gt; * Delta Air Lines cut in half its cash burn and narrowed its losses in the fourth quarter as the coronavirus pandemic drove the carrier to its worst year ever. Shares in the premarket rose more than 1%.\n\n&gt; * Shares of BlackRock were higher by more than 1% Thursday after the New York-based firm reported better-than-expected profits and revenue in the fourth quarter. BlackRock\u2019s assets under management surged to a record $8.68 trillion at the conclusion of the quarter.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 2. 10 Republicans vote for Trump impeachment\n\n&gt; * Ten Republicans joined all of the House Democrats in a 232-197 vote to impeach Trump. GOP Sen. Mitch McConnell, majority leader until Georgia certifies the Democrats\u2019 two runoff election wins, said the Senate won\u2019t start Trump\u2019s trial until Tuesday. That\u2019s one day before President-elect Joe Biden\u2019s inauguration, which is expected to be locked down with unprecedented security. In a video released Wednesday, Trump sent his clearest condemnation yet of last week\u2019s Capitol riot. However, he took no responsibility and made no mention of impeachment.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 3. Biden to unveil Covid mitigation plan\n\n&gt; * Biden is expected to unveil Thursday a coronavirus action plan, centering on a mass vaccination program and closer coordination among all levels of government. The Biden plan comes as the U.S. battles another surge in Covid cases and deaths.\n\n&gt; * Mainland China on Thursday reported its first Covid death since May as authorities try to control a spike in cases just outside of Beijing. The flare-up unfolds as a WHO team arrives in Wuhan, where the coronavirus was discovered in late 2019, to investigate the origins of the virus alongside Chinese scientists.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 4. J&amp;J\u2019s one-shot coronavirus vaccine safe: Study\n\n&gt; * Johnson &amp; Johnson\u2019s one-dose Covid vaccine is safe and appears to generate a promising immune response in young and elderly volunteers, according to trial data published in the New England Journal of Medicine. J&amp;J is expected to release results from its 45,000-person phase three trial later this month, which could then lead to a third vaccine approved for emergency use in the U.S. by the FDA. J&amp;J is using the same technologies behind its Ebola vaccine. Pfizer and Moderna employed a new approach for their respective two-shot vaccines.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 5. Petco, Poshmark set to debut on Nasdaq\n\n&gt; * Two initial public offering are debuting on the Nasdaq on Thursday. Petco priced its IPO at $18 per share, above the expected range of $14 to $17, valuing the pet products retailer at nearly $4 billion. Poshmark priced its IPO at $42 per share, above the expected range of $35 to $39. The offering gives the online secondhand goods seller an initial valuation of more than $3 billion.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/BRd9Yd4.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/MS8vXxs.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/kxhhvOm.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/mRvY2KC.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/Dr7cIXH.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/fuVlrhi.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/nM5oV77.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/xVZMg74.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/DTmidUm.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/Z39U4RB.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/duiiAuN.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/wsMxjtf.png)**)\n\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/xSJAWwz.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #1!]()**)\n(N/A.)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S MOST ACTIVE TRENDING TICKERS ON STOCKTWITS:\n\n* GME\n* CCIV\n* DPW\n* NNDM\n* AMD\n* APHA\n* CEMI\n* INTC\n* PSTH\n* DAL\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/14/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-in-the-premarket-gamestop-tesla-nordstrom-more.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; **GameStop (GME)** \u2013 GameStop is jumping once again in premarket trading after surging the past three days in what some analysts are calling a short squeeze.

        "selftext": "Hello you glorious retards, here's my GME DD covering both the bull and bear case. I also included my own trade plan. Hope this is useful!\n\n# Bull Case\n\n* STRONG FINANCIAL POSITION - GameStop has non-trivial cash flow ($8B revenue and $232M free cash flow in 2019), $500 million in cash, and manageable debt. Recent share price increase also opens up the option to raise more cash through equity offerings.\n* ACTIVIST INVESTOR RYAN COHEN - Activist investor Ryan Cohen is campaigning to focus the company on ecommerce instead of brick-and-mortar retail. Stocks tend to do well if a company is targetted by activist investors and Cohen is the perfect activist investor to drive change at GameStop given his experience running Chewy, an online retailer for pet products. Cohen and two former Chewy execs were recently appointed to GameStop's board.\n* LEVERAGE EXISTING ONLINE FOOTPRINT - GameStop can leverage its existing online footprint (GameStop.com and GameInformer.com) as a low cost starting point to grow its ecommerce business.\n* 5,000 BRICK-AND-MORTAR STORES FOR OMNICHANNEL RETAIL - GameStop's 5,000 brick-and-mortar stores is unintuitively an asset for its ecommerce pivot. Market research shows that omnichannel retail strategies perform better than purely-online strategies (e.g. Apple and its iconic Apple Stores). The real-life experience of physical stores increases customer spending and brand loyalty. GameStop's focus on gaming and its many physical stores give it an omnichannel edge over other gaming ecommerce retailers. For example, its stores can be optimized for gaming experiences while Walmart and Best Buy don't have room to be specific.\n* OPPORTUNITY TO CUT FAT - GameStop's stores have short term leases (24 months average lease duration) which gives it opportunities to cut fat by closing underperforming stores.\n* LARGE LOYALTY PROGRAM - GameStop's PowerUp loyalty program has 55 million members that are, or can be converted, to dedicated ecommerce customers.\n* LOW PRICE TO SALES RATIO - Even with a $2.5 billion market cap ($35.5 per share), GameStop has a relatively low price-to-sales (PS) ratio of 0.4. The SP500's median PS ratio is 1.5. Chewy, the company co-founded by Ryan Cohen, trades at over 6 times sales. Even with just a PS ratio of 1, GME's price would be around $90.\n* GAMING INDUSTRY GROWING RAPIDLY - The gaming industry has been growing rapidly over the last few years and GameStop is in a great position to capitalize on this growth if management can successfully pivot the company.\n* INVESTOR MINDSHARE - GME's explosive move last week caught everyone off guard and now everyone's talking/thinking about it (especially Jim Cramer). With so many people watching the stock, expect any modicum of good news to propel the stock upwards.\n* SHORT SQUEEZE - A short squeeze can happen when many short positions are forced to close at once when the short stock's price increases rapidly. This creates a temporary burst in buying pressure that can rapidly increase a stock's price in the short term. GME is a heavily shorted stock and is at high risk of short squeezes.\n\n# Bear Case\n\n* FAILURE TO PIVOT - GameStop's biggest risk is a failure to pivot to an omnichannel ecommerce business. To reach this goal, the company has significant hurdles to clear. For one, there are many competitors in the gaming ecommerce space. Walmart, Amazon, and Best Buy compete with GameStop in selling physical gaming products like consoles and accessories. If GameStop starts to sell digital goods like downloadable games, it'll face intense competition from Steam, EA's Origin, and Microsoft's Xbox Game pass, as examples. To succeed in this hyper competitive space, GameStop needs to find a niche and grow from there. This is a difficult journey requiring business acumen, finesse, and dedication from its executive team.\n* UNFAVORABLE BROADER MARKET CONDITIONS - GME is a speculative stock and speculative stocks are the hardest-hit during a market downturn. Economic conditions remain uncertain with the slow rollout of the vaccines, the fact that we don't know how _practically_ effective the vaccines are, the apperance of multiple COVID-19 strains around the world, and the likely resumption of debt payments this year (e.g. end of the student loan moratorium in May and the end of the eviction moratorium in February). The chances of a market downturn in 2021 is non-trivial. In addition, even if the pandemic does end and North America and Europe opens up again, expect a short term decline in gaming interest as everyone rushes to go back outside. This can negatively impact GameStop's earnings for a couple of quarters.\n\n# Trade Plan\n\nGME has been a red hot stock in the past few months and last week's giant push to almost $40 will be followed by a period of consolidation as bulls take profit and bears place shorts. During this time, the stock will trade sideways or downwards.\n\nIf you're a GME bull and hold shares, consider selling out-of-the-money covered calls during the consolidation period. Adventurous investors could even sell at any price above $37.5 and re-enter at a lower support level (e.g. $33).\n\nIf you're a GME bull but don't hold shares, you should wait for price to consolidate to a lower support level before buying in. Selling out-of-the-money puts is a good way to get paid while waiting.\n\nIf you are a GME bear, I don't recommend shorting the stock. Stocks with so much retail investor fervor can skyrocket to astronomical prices before settling back down to reason.\n\nThe next few quarters are key for GameStop's transformation. During this time, any positive news is a strong price catalyst. I'm most interested in what changes will come from Ryan Cohen now that he has board representation. For example, it'll be very bullish if the current CEO, George Sherman, is replaced. Sherman is a brick-and-mortar retail veteran and not the best CEO to change GameStop into an ecommerce giant. I won't be surprised if Sherman stepping down is a similar event to Intel CEO Bob Swan's resignation announcement, which caused Intel's stock price to jump by more than 10%.\n\n___\n\nI write over at a small blog called [FinanceTLDR](https://www.financetldr.com/) but it's always great to share the research with fellow degens in /r/wsb.",

        "selftext": "*TL;DR - There is a major undervaluation and more than 15x near-term upside in a long-term structural winner in*\u00a0***GSI Technology (NASDAQ:GSIT),***\u00a0an AI chip company*.*\u00a0They are solving a painful and rapidly growing pain point in similarity search on large data sets. Their solution is a next generation chip with novel \"in-memory\" architecture specifically designed to be a much more powerful and energy efficient solution. This architecture leverages deep memory expertise, resulting in a better solution vs both semiconductor heavyweights like INTC / NVDA and vs upstart competitors like Graphcore\u00a0([whitepaper with benchmarks](https://www.gsitechnology.com/sites/default/files/Whitepapers/GSIT-Gemini-WP-Final-Linley.pdf))\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**They are riding multiple significant macrosecular tailwinds into a large emerging market opportunity:**\n\n*1)\u00a0Cambrian explosion in size and scope of data*:\u00a0more compute, more data, and more search is happening throughout consumer and enterprise environments. Exponentially more data is generated as companies scale.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n*2)*\u00a0*A large emerging market opportunity as deep learning transitions to specialized vs generalized workflows*:\u00a0NVDA grew into a defacto GPU monopoly as the best raw compute solution for the first phase of generalized learning. Specialized silicon that is more effective at solving specialized workflows will enable the next big opportunity in semiconductors. There is currently no clear market leader in similarity search but I believe GSI will be the structural winner.\n\n*3)*\u00a0*Novel chip architecture for large datasets as von Neumann architecture plateaus*: Looking through history, each new paradigm is dominated by a new chip architecture. The timing is ripe as\u00a0compute on large datasets is reaching scalability limitations via traditional von Neumann architecture due to the IO bottleneck and significant power drain. Other competitors add more cores, or increase memory, but this continues to rely on old assumptions around chip architecture. The Gemini chip is a new architectural paradigm for in-memory compute designed with first principles that is only possible due to their legacy memory expertise.\u00a0It reduces compute time by 100x while reducing power consumption, resulting in efficiency gains and cost savings.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGSI has been consistently overlooked due to its legacy business producing profitable high-performance memory chips. Over the past few years, they've been using profits from this legacy business \u2014 \\~$100m of cash over 5 years into R&amp;D \u2014 to bring this first generation \"Gemini I\" AI chip to market. They have intentionally been lying low to detract attention but will soon be launching their\u00a0product and begin recognizing Gemini revenue in Q1 2021, and management expects growth to ramp exponentially into a growing\u00a0market for their\u00a0product. Immediate addressable markets for their AI chip are for large similarity search datasets,\u00a0encountered with high frequency across e-commerce, genomics, and drug discovery. The large-cap tech companies are generally the biggest players in large-scale similarity search, and the use of large scale similarity search is growing exponentially as the size and scope of data increases. This creates a greenfield opportunity for GSI to be the at scale market leader with first mover advantages. These first mover advantages compound as they become the defacto standard for hardware, software, and services around these core workflows.\u00a0Next week on 1/12/2021, they'll be presenting at a growth conference which I expect they'll do significant marketing around. They'll likely do more marketing and PR as they launch in the next few weeks. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGSI's downside is very well protected by $50m in cash and $100m in tangible assets / IP. The upside is potentially large, underscored by their current market cap of just shy of \\~$200m. Startups like Graphcore, Cerebras, Tenstorrent that have yet to launch a chip are already being valued at $2-3B+. As for comparables, conservatively applying NVDA's 25x P/S multiple to a potential $100m of 2022 revenue from both hardware and software from Gemini I, yields 15x near term upside. Further upside will come through a fundamental re rating of their market position as the market opportunity becomes clearer next year and beyond. Conversely, the biggest risk is a premature buyout that significantly undervalues GSI's long term potential.\u00a0GSI has a high likelihood of being the permanent structural winner in this space, with significant time and technology advantages vs the legacy and upstart competition.\u00a0\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDisclosure: I'm long shares and 7/2021 calls",

        "selftext": "Guys, look at this. In an email, so all I can do is copy/paste.\n\n WallStreetBets Impact on the Market\n\nIn 2020 retail-investor representation in the stock market surged by 4.7% to a record 19.6%. Spurred by zero-commission trading and COVID tailwinds, this booming segment of stock market traders has reshaped market behavior. As a result, forums for financial discussion and inspiration have exploded in growth as well. WallStreetBets (r/WSB) is one of the most popular, with over 1.65m followers as of January 15, 2020.\n\nQuiver Quantitative has been scraping discussion on WallStreetBets for several months, and tracking how often different tickers are mentioned every day.\n\nThe graph below visualizes yesterday's discussion on the forum. Size represents the number of times a ticker has been mentioned, whereas color brightness represents the performance of the stock. GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME) had the highest discussion count with 495 mentions and returned 10.89% for the day. To view the most recent data, click [**here.**](https://hs-7275785.t.hubspotstarter-i2.net/e2t/tc/VVrvWd3cbzC9W3Tyg6W20HFZjW6TYKFS4m2yGQN1-yX_G3lGn5V1-WJV7CgBpxN3v-rCLs8pWlVk7FqR6zmLC7W4Nz_Vx8-4ytYW1bcGhz1b2L9NN7PRQMP7ln2TN7HnQVvg1K0FW3ltK5z3QsgsGW4X_xY55JxS5-W210xk_2DYNWzW6vSyn23JblhPMV0pBbg-qpPW1TfHqq8zJJllW6G3Cfk83Q2TgW89KGh27zMHzyW6Hx_VG3t5BN8W56HHTv19KTkyW40PKXv5Xv7NCVFnyFT2QrNVjW2g5H2f4bPj3NW13_zBT2mYBrfW1tfZZf87ht4dW7qfNTT5hcdGsW1GGlTC5-N8SrW5JbHnD7dC07g3gn51)\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\nA quick look at the above graph shows that many of the companies listed have experienced parabolic stock growth and volatility over the last several months.\u00a0This begs the question: **Has** r/WSB **discussion been a leading indicator for stock performance?**\n\nTo test this question, we backtested a simple strategy that buys and holds the 5 stocks that were most discussed on WallStreetBets in the previous week. We ran this backtest using data from 2020.\n\nThe graph below shows the portfolio holdings by week (click for full-size image):\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\nTesla, Apple, AMD, Nio, and Microsoft were among the stocks that most frequently cracked the weekly top five most-mentioned tickers.\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\nOver the last year this simple strategy was up over 61%, with especially strong returns in the last quarter of 2020. The \"WallStreetBets Portfolio\" was more volatile than the S&amp;P 500, but outperformed even during the downturn at the start of the year.\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\nTo take a look at the relationship between WallStreetBets discussion and market activity at a stock-level, we\u2019ve picked 4 stocks that were among the most popular on r/WSB in the last 120 days and examined them to determine if there is a correlation between r/WSB discussion and share price and volume.\n\nPalantir Technologies Inc (NASDAQ: PLTR)\n\nBig data analytics company, Palantir Technologies Inc, had its highly anticipated IPO on September 30, 2020 trading at $8.20. Shortly after, on October 14, the discussion volume of PLTR tripled to nine counts as well as achieving a 4.65% gain on the day. r/WSB count and share price activity continue to share a positive correlation coefficient of 0.592 as the stock reached a 52-week high of 33.05 on November 27, 2020. *\\[Note: A value of greater than 0.7 is considered a\u00a0strong correlation. Anything between 0.5 and 0.7 is a\u00a0moderate correlation, and anything less than\u00a00.4\u00a0is considered a weak or no\u00a0correlation.\\]*\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\nr/WSB counts and PLTR volume for the same dates recorded a correlation coefficient of 0.803. This could indicate a large amount of individual-investor interest driving the recent valuation of Palantir which features a low proportion of institutional ownership at 14.41% (3Q20), compared to the industry average.\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\nPLTR received three downgrades from investment banks between October and December 2020 but added a price target increase to $30.00 (from $18.00) by Jeffries on January 11, 2021, well above its current price of $25.64. Risks still linger as 2Q20 to 3Q20 EBITDA losses increased by 83% to an $848.1m loss and, as of now, positive investor sentiment continues to support an uptrend.\n\nGameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME)\n\nGameStop Corp. has experienced financial stress in recent years as the retail trends which had worked in its favor continue to decline globally. Total Liabilities climbed 12.18% to $2.26bn from 2Q20 to 3Q20. Before May 5, 2020, r/WSB activity on GME had been dormant averaging 3.83 counts daily YTD.\n\nShortly following this, several threads on r/WSB began to speculate on a GME recovery due to increased gaming activity and a large existing short position of 57 million\u00a0shares at the time. r/WSB counts would be amplified after an investment from activist investor and founder of Chewy (NYSE: CHWY), Ryan Cohen.\n\nSince May 5, 2020, GME has rallied 755.33% and r/WSB discussion counts averaged 55.34 a day making a positive correlation coefficient at 0.688.\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\nThe r/WSB counts and stock volume also shared a correlation coefficient of 0.628. This was exemplified on November 30, 2020, when stock volume spiked by 31.3m and discussion counts followed suit at 227 for the day.\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\nThe mainly optimistic speculation of a GME recovery in May on r/WSB contrasted with most major media outlets at the time, which appeared to focus on store closures due to the COVID-19 outbreak. The rally and enthusiasm behind GME since that time was in stark contrast to many other corporations, 630 of which filed for bankruptcy in 2020 marking a 10 year high.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices Inc. (NYSE: AMD)\n\nOn January 4, 2021, Advanced Micro Devices surpassed long-time competitor Intel in 1Q21 in desktop CPU sales and additionally had record revenue of $2.8bn in 3Q20, representing 164% of growth from the same period five years ago. These factors have been reflected in its valuation as the stock hit a 52-week high of 99.23 on January 11, 2021.\n\nWhen we look at the r/WSB discussion counts and compare them to the share price, we encounter a unique occurrence:\n\nWhen evaluating these figures from August 8, 2018, to the present, the correlation is 0.187, however, when we look at just the past 100 days the same metric it\u2019s -0.238. The graphs and table below illustrate how in almost three months, share price correlation slumped while price continued increasing.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\n\ud83d\udcf7\ud83d\udcf7\n\nIn further analysis, the r/WSB discussion counts for the past 100 days averaged 29.6, higher than the previous 400-day previous average of just 20.7. Nevertheless, the correlation with the share price declined. **This occurred because once a stock reached a high enough market valuation, the influence** r/WSJ **has on its price is reduced because it is weighted more.**\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\nVisualized in the graph, the volume can be seen maintaining similar levels to the previous period. The dip in overall volume can be deceptive due to the share price increasing substantially, climbing 1,600% in a rally over the past year as of January 11, 2021.\n\n## NIO Limited (NYSE: NIO)\n\nTo substantiate the previous claim regarding AMD we tested this on several other companies with similar scenarios to it statically, one notable company being Chinese auto manufacture, NIO Limited (NYSE: NIO). The table shows how as the company grows in valuation, correlation declines:\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\nTo further illustrate the theory, the graph below depicts how r/WSB count begins to deviate stock price growth on September 20, 2020 and again on November 30, 2020:\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\n## Summary\n\nThere is no universal method of finding actionable insights when analyzing r/WSB, but discussion on the forum can serve as a useful estimation of retail interest. Companies that have had exponential growth with help from forums such as r/WSBs are more likely to become transition to an organic growth phase with more institutional investors and less volume. Keeping an eye on rising companies on r/WSBs could help identify an opportunity that many may have overlooked.",

        "selftext": "What's up fellas at smallstreetbets. I made a tool called [FD Ranker](https://www.swaggystocks.com/dashboard/stocklabs/fd-ranker) that logs the average IV of popular tickers. The tool is inclusive of almost 1,000 tickers now.\n\n**What is this tool good for**\n\nI posted in ThetaGang the list with HIGH IV options which is great for running the wheel or selling options. This list is an inverse of that list and displays tickers where IV is pretty low, thus, purchasing calls will likely be cheaper. For example, AAPL implied volatility right now is almost back to the pre-March lows. Remember a low IV can go lower and a high IV can go higher.

        "selftext": "It seems that every time I look at literally any stock graph, you can see a massive peak from March 2020 onwards resulting in the stock being 3-5 X more expensive than it was just one year ago. Examples are: Tesla, Square, Zillow and many others.\n\nLet's say though that I'm a value investor who wants to avoid overpaying for a technology/growth stock, what options do I have? My criteria are the following:\n\n1) Stock's value growth has been less than 2x since March 2020.\n2) Company's Debt to Equity ratio is less than 2, preferably less than 1. (This minimises the probability the company will go bankrupt if the stock market crashes).\n3) Company still has at least 5% annual growth projected in the next years.\n\nBased on this, literature the only option I could find was Intel! And I might consider dropping \u00a31000 into Intel as my long term play. However, I am looking for other finds from people here, please share any knowledge you have!\n\nTwo more ideas: Ericsson stock has been stagnant however they have growth potential from 5G, lastly, Blackberry stock has been low for the last few years, however with company strategy changing, they might make a come back?",

        "selftext": "Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/smallstreetbets. Happy New Year! I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week, month and year ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning January 4th, 2021.\n\n# **Politics will be front and center as a catalyst in the first week of the new year  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/31/politics-will-be-front-and-center-as-a-catalyst-in-the-first-week-of-the-new-year-.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Stocks exit 2020 with strong gains and are riding a tailwind, but already in the dawn of the new year, the market could face its first big challenge.\n*****\n&gt; The final outcome of the 2020 election plays out Tuesday, when voters in Georgia will pick their senators and decide which party controls the U.S. Senate.\n*****\n&gt; With President-elect Joe Biden heading to the White House and a Democratic-controlled House of Representatives, Wall Street has been comfortable with the view that Biden and the Democrats could not succeed with tax hikes and more progressive policy changes while Republicans hold the Senate.\n*****\n&gt; The runoff election for the two Senate seats Tuesday is widely expected to result in one or both of the incumbent Republican senators retaining their seats. But Democrats are close in the polls and should they win, each party would have 50 seats with Vice President-elect Kamala Harris the tie breaker.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cGeorgia is the most important thing to the Biden presidency for the next two years,\u201d said Ed Mills, Washington policy analyst at Raymond James. \u201cIt\u2019s going to determine what is the legislative agenda and who can get confirmed by the United States Senate.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Sen. David Perdue is being challenged by Democrat Jon Ossoff, while GOP Sen. Kelly Loeffler is running against Democrat Raphael Warnock. None of the candidates had more than 50% of the vote in the Nov. 3 election, so Georgia law requires a runoff election between the two leading candidates for each seat.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIt\u2019s a binary event,\u201d said Mills, adding it\u2019s of growing interest to markets. \u201cThe general sense for the market is that Republicans are well positioned to maintain their majority in the Senate. But I think the 2020 election as well as the 2016 election and to some extent, the 2018 election has humbled us \u2026 The Senate outcomes, in particular, seem to be less predictable than almost any other elections.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Mills said the results may take several days to determine, adding to the uncertainty the event could hold for markets. According to an RBC investor survey, 88% expect Republicans to maintain control, and most say that is a positive for the stock market.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe market tends to shoot first and ask questions later. There will certainly be a reaction if Democrats win both those seats,\u201d said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group. Strategists say there could be a relief rally if Republican incumbents see a clear victory.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThat totally dominates [trading] because it\u2019s about do we have status quo or do we have Democrats controlling all parts of Washington and what that means for spending and taxes,\u201d Boockvar said. \u201cI think you could see the worries about taxes overwhelming any thoughts on the benefits of more spending\u201d by Democrats.\n*****\n&gt; # By the numbers\n&gt; A year of extreme volatility ended with a big win for stocks, as the pandemic steered the course for markets. The S&amp;P 500 was up 16.3% for the year, ending at 3,756. That gain comes after a 34% decline early in the year, followed by a powerful more-than 65% rebound. Technology was the big winner for the year, and the Nasdaq was up 43.6% at 12,888.\n*****\n&gt; Besides the runoff vote, the market will be watching a stream of data in the coming week, including the important December jobs report Friday. That could show fewer than 100,000 jobs were added as the spreading virus impacted hiring and layoffs. There were 245,000 jobs created in November.\n*****\n&gt; There is also ISM manufacturing data Tuesday, and a number of Fed speakers, including Vice Chairman Richard Clarida on Friday.\n*****\n&gt; The virus itself could also be a factor for stocks.\n*****\n&gt; Conventional wisdom for the coming year has been that vaccines will be widely distributed, and by the second half things will start to get back to normal and the economy will pick up. But the initial distribution has been slow, and far short of the 20 million targeted for December by President Donald Trump\u2019s task force.\n*****\n&gt; In that recent RBC survey, three quarters of investors were optimistic about vaccine distribution with 80% expecting a majority to be vaccinated by the end of 2021. \u201cWe suspect that the positive outlook for the stock market and the economy would deteriorate if expectations for a smooth vaccine rollout are not met,\u201d RBC strategists wrote.\n*****\n&gt; They also noted that nearly 60% of the investors surveyed believe high stock market valuations are problematic.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThis suggests to us that any threat to the economic and earnings recovery story could spark profit-taking. On this point, it is worth noting that the vaccine was the No. 1 issue keeping investors up at night, closely followed by monetary policy and excessive optimism on the recovery,\u201d the strategists noted.\n*****\n&gt; Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG Union Bank, said investors will also be watching the formal acceptance of the Electoral College vote Wednesday. Strategists expect the vote count to confirm Biden\u2019s presidency.\n*****\n&gt; However, Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley says he will challenge the certification, and several House Republicans have already vowed to contest the election at that time. If one House member and a senator jointly object to a state\u2019s slate of electors, the two houses of Congress must separately debate and vote on the objection.\n*****\n&gt; Strategists see little chance of any impact on the election outcome, but there could be fireworks. Trump has been claiming since the election that there was fraud but multiple courts failed to find any truth to the claims.\n*****\n&gt; Rupkey said investors are not taking into account enough potential for political risk from the deep animosity between the two political parties.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think the additional stimulus and hopes for additional stimulus, and infrastructure spending in 2021, I don\u2019t know that that is such a slam dunk, because of the issue of political instability,\u201d he said.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/cAXzkxf.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/HnhSggu.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Thursday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF THURSDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/5egoYkS.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/UlNY0Um.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/z4wSKuc.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/32Ma7rG.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Thursday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/mRJqU8A.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Thursday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/J7B4Njx.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/5udYrpD.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/JJmAiwp.png))**\n\n# **Thursday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/1ARzFfu.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Why A Year-End Rally Bodes Well For 2021\n\n&gt; Welcome to the last day of 2020! It has been a devastating year in so many ways, yet for investors it has been quite rewarding. Much of the gains in 2020 have taken place the final two months, with the S&amp;P 500 Index up more than 14% in November and December so far, the best end to a year since WWII.\n\n&gt; A big end of year rally could have bulls smiling in 2021. \u201cTurns out a 10% or more gain the final two months of the year has equaled a higher S&amp;P 500 the following year every single time since World War II,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cIn fact, January was also higher every single time as well, so maybe this strong rally to end the year is a clue for higher prices into next year.\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the S&amp;P 500 gained an average of more than 18% the year following a 10% or more surge during the final two months of the year. Meanwhile, January was up 5 for 5 as well, rising an impressive 3% on average.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/12.31.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Here\u2019s what the average year looks like after the prior year gains 10% or more the final two months compared to a typical year. Once again, strong returns are the playbook historically.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/blog-12.31.20-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; We wish everyone a happy and safe New Years Eve and we\u2019ll see you in 2021!\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Fifty to Zero in 283 Days\n\n&gt; In a year with some pretty crazy charts, the one below is right up there with some of the best. After all the markets have been through this year, bot the S&amp;P 500 and Long-Term Treasuries have seen nearly identical returns on a total return basis. That's right, with just a few hours left in the trading year, the S&amp;P 500's total return in 2020 has been a gain of 17.6%, while Long Term US Treasuries, as measured by the B of A Merrill Lynch Long-Term Treasury Index has rallied 17.3%. What makes this nearly identical performance all the more incredible is that on March 23rd, the performance gap between the two was more than 50 percentage points.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123120-Stocks-Bonds.png))**\n\n&gt; The fact that stocks and bonds have essentially seen identical returns this year isn't typical. The chart below shows the annual performance spread between the S&amp;P 500 and long-term US Treasuries going back to 1978. During that time, the S&amp;P 500 has historically outperformed long-term US Treasuries by an average of 3.9 percentage points per year, but the average gap in performance between the two has been over 15 percentage points. In the 43 years since 1978, there have only been seven other years where the performance spread between the two asset classes was less than five percentage points and just two years (1985 and 1992) where the performance spread was less than a percentage point.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123120-Stocks-Bonds-Annual-Spreads.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Back-to-Back Big Years for Technology\n\n&gt; With just two trading days (including today) left in 2020, the S&amp;P 500 Technology sector is on pace for its second year in a row of rallying more than 40%. Going back to 1990, the only time the Technology sector experienced back-to-back returns of more than 40% was in 1998 and 1999. Back then, not only was the Technology sector up 40%+ in back-to-back years, but it was also up over 75% in both of those years. If you think markets are pretty crazy these days, they still have nothing on the last two years of the 1990s!\n\n&gt; In terms of cumulative returns, the Technology sector is up 210% since the last trading day of 2018, whereas in 1999 it was up 317% in a two-year span. What's also interesting to note about the last 31 years of returns for the Technology sector is how it has only experienced five down years, while the S&amp;P 500 has been down in ten different years during that span. Furthermore, since 2009 there has only been one down year and the decline was a paltry 1.6%. Not a bad 12-year run!\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123020-Technology-Sector-Performance.png))**\n\n&gt; Given that the sector has more than doubled in the last two years, there have been some big individual winners. Topping the list with a gain of just under 400% is Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). On the last day of 2018, AMD traded hands for under $20 per share. Today's it's over $90. AMD has a lead of more than 100 percentage points over the next closest stock - NVIDIA (NVDA) - which is up 288%. Interestingly, there aren't a lot of major outliers to the upside compared to the sector's 210% gain, but that's because Apple (AAPL), the sector's largest stock, has paced the sector's gains by rallying more than 240%.\n\n&gt; On the downside, just four stocks in the Technology sector have declined in the last two years. The worst of these has been DXC Technology (DXC) which has lost more than half of its value, while Juniper (JNPR) and HP Enterprise (HPE) are down between 10% and 20%. Lastly, FLIR Systems (FLIR) has declined less than 2%, so depending on how it acts in the next two days, it could move into positive territory just as Intel (INTC) did yesterday after Third Point bailed it out and moved the stock barely into positive territory for the last two years.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123020-Technology-Sector-Stocks.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Growth Dragging on Small Caps\n\n&gt; In the past couple of weeks, we have frequently been keeping tabs on small-cap equities which have been particularly strong performers of late resulting in very overbought readings as well as extended valuations. More specifically, taking a look at growth-oriented small-caps, with only a couple days left in the year small-cap growth stocks\u2014proxied by the Russell 2000 Growth ETF (IWO)\u2014are on pace to have outperformed large-cap equivalents in 2020. On December 10th, IWO surpassed the S&amp;P 500 Growth ETF (IVW) in terms of YTD performance, and even after pulling back in the past week, IWO is still in the lead.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123020-Small-Large1.png))**\n\n&gt; As a result of recent moves, there has been a sharp reversal on a relative basis between the two ETFs in the past week. In the chart below, we show the ratio of the Russell 2000 Growth ETF (IWO) versus the S&amp;P 500 Growth ETF (IVW). This ratio took off beginning in the early fall meaning small-cap growth drastically outperformed large-cap growth. But the former's weakness in the past several days has put a halt to that move.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123020-Small-Large2.png))**\n\n&gt; As to just how sharp of a reversal this was, in the five days through yesterday's close, the decline in the ratio of IWO to IVW was the largest since June. Before that, April and March saw declines that were even larger. Not only was this one of the biggest drops in the relative performance of small-cap growth to large-cap growth in the past few months, but that also stands in the bottom 0.5% of all readings going back to 2000 when the ETF first began trading. Outside of this past spring, the only other periods that have also experienced this type of underperformance of small-cap growth relative to large-cap growth was at various points in 2011, 2008, and a handful of times in the early 2000s.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123020-Small-Large3.png))**\n\n&gt; Small-cap underperformance has not necessarily been broad though. For value stocks, small caps (IWN) have generally outperformed large caps (IVE) for the entirety of the new bull market. While there was a bit of a turn lower in recent days, it has been nowhere close to as dramatic of a move as growth stocks.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123020-Small-Large4.png))**\n\n&gt; In the charts below, we show average performance over the past week of Russell 2000 stocks broken into deciles based on their price to sales and price to book ratios. As shown, the most aggressively valued deciles have averaged the worst performance in the past week. Stocks with low P/S and P/B ratios have not been immune from the weakness, but they have held up significantly better.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123020-RTY-Decile.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending December 31st, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFRABTKrDl8))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 1.3.21**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prYPiK171zk))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$MU** \n&gt; * **$BBBY** \n&gt; * **$SMPL** \n&gt; * **$WBA** \n&gt; * **$STZ** \n&gt; * **$RPM** \n&gt; * **$MSM** \n&gt; * **$CAG** \n&gt; * **$UNF** \n&gt; * **$HELE** \n&gt; * **$ANGO** \n&gt; * **$SGH** \n&gt; * **$AYI** \n&gt; * **$REVG** \n&gt; * **$LW** \n&gt; * **$WDFC** \n&gt; * **$LNN** \n&gt; * **$LNDC** \n&gt; * **$SAR** \n&gt; * **$RGP** \n&gt; * **$GBX** \n&gt; * **$ACCD** \n&gt; * **$DCT** \n&gt; * **$FC** \n&gt; * **$NTIC** \n&gt; * **$SCHN**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/5udYrpD.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/hQIRBYI.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 1.4.21 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 1.4.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday  1.5.21 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ZAbC0jw.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 1.5.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/wKzyMxp.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 1.6.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/BUFtffd.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 1.6.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/cDQHHqx.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 1.7.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/NhUT413.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 1.7.21 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/7p03h4M.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 1.8.21 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 1.8.21 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Micron Technology, Inc. $75.18\n**Micron Technology, Inc.

        "selftext": "**GameStop short squeeze is ON! Alibaba continues to push into the EV world. Intel spikes while AMD &amp; TSM suffer. Let\u2019s talk about this and other stock market news!**\n\nHello everyone and Good Morning! So, let\u2019s start with the recap of yesterday as we saw the stock market finishing mixed, with the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/qybhmjC) gaining .43%, the [SP500](https://ibb.co/YL4XS6m) also gaining .23% while the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/YTFwLcx) lost just 8 points to close out the day. We also saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/0r28dsT) dropping almost 5% again, continuing the downtrend after that huge spike with the Georgia elections, as it sits at similar levels to the ones before Christmas.\n\nDespite the positive gains for the broad stock market SP500, [OVERALL](https://ibb.co/PrDh7DD), we saw about 57% of the companies declining yesterday, with most of them trading below average volumes, as the number of companies trading above the 50-day moving average still sits over 70%, which is pretty high. Yesterday we saw 6 of the 11 [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/wJH4B8C) finish in the green with Real Estate and Utilities posting gains of more than 1% while the laggards were Energy, Industrials and Materials, as we saw large-cap growth companies finally [OUTPERFORMED](https://ibb.co/kKtRY96) for once in 2021, with small &amp; mid-caps giving up some of the big gains they have posted in this short year, though, Large-Cap Growth companies are still underperforming by 3% compared to the next factor group in 2021.\n\nHere is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/Ms0qkCh) from yesterday, which shows pretty mixed results as expected, with most of the big tech companies posting small gains like Apple, Amazon, Google, Netflix and the rest of the bunch, with Alibaba posting a 4% gain after some EV news popped up and Intel also gaining almost 7% and pushed the rest of the Semiconductors down with TSM and AMD both down over 3%.\n\nWe also got a lot of economic data yesterday as the US [DEFICIT](https://ibb.co/QXXDBrc) fell by $2B to $143B in December compared to the previous month, but is up 10 fold from the $13B deficit from the same period in 2019, and this doesn\u2019t even include any of the $900B stimulus packaged that passed late in December, while the December consumer price [INDEX](https://ibb.co/n1Jr9G2) increased by 0.4% m/m and Core CPI also increase by 0.1%, coming in-line with expectations, as the Atlanta FED business inflation expectations [ROSE](https://ibb.co/t2v98jw) to 2.2% in January compared to December, though sales and profit margins compared to normal, decreased since the last month, while one of the FED\u2019s Vice Chairs [RESTATED](https://ibb.co/WtNxQKM) that the FED won\u2019t raise rates until the average long-term inflation stands at 2% for a year.\n\n[Today](https://ibb.co/C79879d) we get lots of important economic data with Jobless numbers in the early morning, which are expected to come around the same numbers as the previous week and end with the Money Supply and FED Balance Sheet while the stock market will also turn its eyes to see what the FED Leader Powell announces in terms of the FED keeping the money printer going, and of course to see what Biden announces about a further stimulus packaged that is expected to be as big as $2T.\n\nIn some other stock market news, we saw [Intel](https://ibb.co/9bHNxrx) spiking yesterday after the company decided on a change in leadership, this move put some selling pressure on rival companies like TSM, AMD &amp; others, but I think this is more of a \u201chype move\u201d right now. Intel has still fallen behind it\u2019s competition and it will take massive Capex and R&amp;D investments to catch up, so the selloff in other players should rather be a buying point, especially for AMD.\n\nWe also saw [Target](https://ibb.co/Phk4N4s) reporting huge comp sale increases with a 4.3% increase in traffic and a massive 12.3% increase in the average ticket, as comparable digital sales more than doubled.\n\nWe also saw, their same-day services post an impressive growth of almost 200%, as they remain one of the best plays in the consumer discretionary sector, as 95% of their sales were fulfilled by their 1600 store that are within 10miles of \u00be of the US population.\n\nAlso, guys, these small cap companies keep on giving me reasons to come back to the same points I have been making in the past weeks, with company after company issuing shares, with the latest ones being [Nano](https://ibb.co/qDRKJ7Y) Dimension which are diluting their shares by about 20% while [Lemonade](https://ibb.co/27StT0c) has also increased their stock offering by another 300.000 shares.\n\nWhile in another kind of news we saw [GameStop](https://ibb.co/pLMSXrb) soar yesterday finishing the day up over 57%, after a huge short squeeze pushed the stock up as high as 90% at one point. This has happened after GameStop has [PUSHED](https://ibb.co/F3S2XTT) for a change in leadership with plenty of experience in the e-commerce and online marketing world, with 3 veterans from Chewy, which has been an impressive performer in the online e-commerce business. The [STOCK](https://ibb.co/y8XVnd7) Is up another 20% in pre-market right now as the short squeeze keeps increasing the pressure on the bears.\n\nWe also saw [Alibaba](https://ibb.co/vjKdwKW) making a couple of headlines yesterday, which helped push the stocks 4% higher, after the Wall Street Journal reported that the US is expected to continue to allow investments in Alibaba, Baidu &amp; Tencent, while also continuing their charge into the [EV](https://ibb.co/0tVsJSS) world, with a new electric sedan that features wireless charging in cooperation with China\u2019s state owned SAIC Motor. This is their latest push into the EV world, as Alibaba is also an investor in Xpeng. This news, might help the stock see a recovery, that could be boosted if Jack Ma finally appears and the Ant Group IPO eventually receives the green light.\n\nAnd one last piece of [NEWS](https://ibb.co/Z8RSWQL) is that Affirm went public yesterday and started trading at just over 90$, more than 80% above the IPO price, as the IPO mania keeps on pushing any recent IPO to big pops on the first day of trading, but unfortunately, retail investors do not benefit from this, as the actual return for people who manage to buy right at the open price, is under 10% while also risking a severe drop in the next days. Hopefully more companies will move to direct listings IPOs which will allow retail investors to get part of the action, which will benefit most of the people, not just the \u201cbig players\u201d who get in at much lower prices.\n\nSo, let\u2019s hope for a good day in the markets as the [WORLD](https://ibb.co/T8wRNxc) Markets are in the green while the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/LkrrWtc) are also pointing to a good open.\n\n\ud83d\ude4fThank you everyone for reading!\ud83d\ude4f Hope you enjoyed the content!

        "selftext": "**Biden unveils the $1.9T stimulus package proposal. Tesla starts deliveries of the Model Y in China. Lemonade drops after the latest Citron short opinion while Nikola &amp; GameStop shareholders jump ship. Let\u2019s talk about this and other stock market news**\n\nHello everyone and Good Morning! So, let\u2019s start with the recap of the last few days as I haven\u2019t made a post since Wednesday, as I was busy making a full stock analysis on Amazon which you can check by clicking [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/kxwje8/amazon_stock_price_target_prediction_analysis_dcf/).\n\nSo, on Thursday we saw all 3 major indexes finish in the red, with the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/MPQ6PVW) losing .12%, the [DOW](https://ibb.co/GJf3qV9) dropping almost 70 points and the broad stock market [SP500](https://ibb.co/r51hS22) dropping below $3800 to finish the day, as the [VIX](https://ibb.co/sq1P6gm) rose again by almost 5%, though 70% of the companies were [advancing](https://ibb.co/yhsdpZD) on normal volumes with just 8 new lows, as 4 of the 11 [sectors](https://ibb.co/ZW0k1VD) finished in the green with Energy outperforming by quite some gap, while Technology was the biggest loser, as Large-Cap Growth companies were the [underperformers](https://ibb.co/jZW53gf), while small-caps shined, with all 3 segments gaining more than 2% for the day.\n\nHere is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/hsmYfRz) from Thursday, with Amazon, Microsoft, Tesla, Netflix &amp; Facebook all losing more than 1%, while the biggest gainers were the Semiconductors, Alibaba and some companies from the Materials and Oil &amp; Gas Industry.\n\nWe also received the investor sentiment [survey](https://ibb.co/XZNYQHY), which for me came in better with a drop of almost 1% in bullish investors and 4% in neutral ones, as fear has reached almost 5% more investors in this past week, which is a good sign for opportunities in the stock market.\n\nMeanwhile, Friday was even worse for the broad stock market, with the [SP500](https://ibb.co/Ms5m47G) losing .72% as the [DOW](https://ibb.co/dKc4ZV0) dropped 177 points while the tech heavy [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/MkcyrQV) was the biggest underperformer dropping below $13000, as the [VIX](https://ibb.co/RSGmvvN) continued to rise near the 25 level and even had a spike near the 26 level in the early morning, but overall finished the [week](https://ibb.co/SnvsgHc) down almost 3%.\n\nWe saw again 4 of the 11 [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/0GTqNZG) finish in the green, but this time Energy was the biggest underperformer, losing almost 4% and giving up some of the huge gains made up this week, while Real Estate was the only sector to post a gain of more than 1% and Communications continued to recover after a bad start to the week, as almost 70% of the companies were declining on [Friday](https://ibb.co/grwfwwM), with Large-Cap Growth Companies slightly recovering to finish the [week](https://ibb.co/vX2mxss) down only 1.2%\n\nHere is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/GdWj575) from Friday, in which you can struggle to find some bright spots, with the gains being concentrated in the Health Care &amp; Real Estate sectors, while for the [WEEK](https://ibb.co/441kLYw), there is some more breadth with Energy, Banks and Semiconductors also posting some gains.\n\nOn Thursday we also saw [Powell](https://ibb.co/M7vznm4) reiterating the point that rates won\u2019t be raised unless inflation becomes a serious problem, as he believes there is still plenty of room in the labor markets until maximum employment is reached, with this point being sustained by the increase in initial jobless [CLAIMS](https://ibb.co/X5brzGZ) which jumped almost 200K, a lot worse than expected and the previous month, as continuing jobless claims also jumped by about the same to 5.27M, a big increase over last week.\n\nMoving on, Friday we also received more economic data, with the January [Consumer](https://ibb.co/n38hy4w) sentiment coming in at 79.2 lower than expected and the previous read, as consumers have lost confidence both in the current conditions and in expectations.\n\nWe also saw the New York business [activity](https://ibb.co/92Rydt9) coming in at 3.5, worse than the 6 expected and the 4.9 in the previous month, with new orders seeing an increase but being offset by a huge drop in shipments.\n\nBusiness [Inventories](https://ibb.co/TRs2SMW) came in as expected at a .5% increase M/M, while Producer [prices](https://ibb.co/py4bpTn) rose less than expected and retail [sales](https://ibb.co/X2v2Y0Z) fell more than expected with a .7% decrease M/M.\n\nThis [WEEK](https://ibb.co/VqGMnJT) we start of slow, with no big data coming in until Thursday as we await the Biden inauguration tomorrow while the most interesting [earnings](https://ibb.co/B2T64dc) for me are Goldman Sachs as a continued read on how the banks are doing after last weeks good numbers, Netflix to see how the stay-at-home stocks will continue to perform and Intel to see how they manage to turn around things.\n\nIn some other stock market news, we saw [Aphria](https://ibb.co/nwxNpm0) beat consensus in earnings and starting a broad rally in pot stocks, while [Lemonade](https://ibb.co/vw4dXQ7) dropped more than 9% after CITRON went at them again, implying a drop back to under 100$ expected very soon.\n\nWe also saw IPOs soar again in the first trading day, with [PETCO](https://ibb.co/KwTHrvY) popping almost 50% and [POSHMARK](https://ibb.co/3cGk45W) more than doubling before dropping 20% as this IPOs are way overbought on every single launch just like most of the SPACs, with [Churchill](https://ibb.co/6JGGKHP) Capital also climbing huge on reports of a Lucid Motors deal, but this is only speculation and could have massive downside if the deal doesn\u2019t go through.\n\nMeanwhile, [Delta](https://ibb.co/FzGKp9C) Airlines reported Q4 earnings and hinted at a positive cash flow by late-spring or summer as they reduced the cash burn from $24M to $12M/ day in Q4, which helped most of the airlines rally.\n\nThursday was capped off my [Biden's](https://ibb.co/bzh0fsV) new relief package proposal that seems to be around $1.9T. This will serve probably as a start point of future negotiations. This package includes $400B in crisis aids including $20B for vaccines, $50B for testing, $30B for supplies and $140B targeted at helping schools reopen and stay open.\n\nThe plan also includes $1T in aids to individuals including $1400 stimulus checks and extending the unemployment benefits to $400/week through September, $30B in rental assistance and extending the federal moratorium on evictions and foreclosure through September and increasing the minimum wage to $15/hour.\n\nBiden\u2019s propsal also includes the highly debated help for state &amp; local governments worth $350B &amp; $50B in small business grants and loans.\n\nThis will probably serve as a starting point and I don\u2019t expect everything to pass even with the blue sweep. It\u2019s likely going to be less than $1.9T, and most of the debate will continue to happen on the state &amp; local help and is also likely to exclude things like increasing the minimum hourly wage, as this is not something temporary like most of the other costs and is likely to receive big roadblocks. This will likely be a short-term boost for the stock market, but the impacts of this in terms of inflation, debt and other economic factors are still unknown in the long-run.\n\nAnd moving on, Friday we saw [Tesla's](https://ibb.co/Vqmf9Mm) forecasted deliveries increased to 1M cars by Wedbush who also raised their price target to $950 with a bull case of $1250, as the Tesla [Model Y](https://ibb.co/1Qws23d) has finally started deliveries in China and will be one of the biggest bets Tesla has made, as the affordable SUV demand is much higher than any of the other Tesla models, while in contrast [Nikola](https://ibb.co/r3dFQSk) seems to be having firms jumping board with an early investor recently selling over 7M shares. Some similar action was seen from the director of [GameStop](https://ibb.co/rvyQdvq) who sold 800K shares after the recent pop in the stock. This kind of companies provide high risk/high reward opportunities, but you should have a tight approach to them, you should take profits whenever you can and not risk losing your gains on these highly volatile stocks that don\u2019t have a good fundamental basis.\n\nSo, let\u2019s hope for a good day in the markets as the [WORLD](https://ibb.co/nr2Pw5W) markets seem to be pointing to a good day, as we await Biden\u2019s pick Janet Yellen\u2019s [remarks](https://ibb.co/bsjzK1b) on the proposed stimulus and the dollar while the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/S3cfpZq) are also pointing to a green open, with the Nasdaq leading the way.\n\nThank you everyone for reading\ud83d\ude4f Hope you enjoyed the content!

        "selftext": "So just to preface, I am very new to investing. I am just starting my career and have started to invest. I opened a Roth IRA and plan to open a 401K. Last week, I inherited the following stocks in a taxable account :\n\n* AAPL\n* CSCO\n* INTC\n* JNJ\n* MSFT\n* V\n* DIS\n\nNow a few of these I do plan to keep for sure, since I feel like there is a lot of growth potential (AAPL, MSFT, V, and DIS are all ones I plan on keeping). But the rest of them (CSCO, INTC, JNJ) are companies I really don't know anything about and not sure if it makes sense to hold. Would it make sense to sell these and then put that money in my Roth IRA or 401K, am I even allowed to do that? It seems like if I just sold them all to buy something like VOO in my Roth IRA it would be better since it could grow tax free and probably outperform these individual stocks in the long run.\n\nAny advice would be appreciated.",

        "selftext": "Hi, I recently been looking into semiconductors industry as it looks like a lot of growth could be generated there. I've been looking at companies in SOXX ETF and some other prominent companies in this industry. There are companies that I really like and that I don't like. However, it seems to always come down to ASML in one way or another. Many companies that make advanced chips use ASML equipment. Heck, even TSMC use ASML equipment. The thing is that ASML has monopoly in EUV (Extreme Ultraviolet) Lithography equipment. They are the only company in the world able to make this equipment. And it is equipment required to make the most advanced chips we can currently make. No matter where I look, Intel, Nvdia, TSMC, it always comes back to them using ASML equipment either directly or by proxy. ASML seem to have wold-wide monopoly on one thing that everyone in the world needs and will need even more so in the future. \n\nWith that in mind, why not just allocate all the money that I have currently allocated to Intel, Nvidia, AMD, etc to ASML? What is the mistake I'm making with this line of thinking?\n\nTo be clear, I'm not talking about 100% ASML portfolio, just rolling up all semi companies into ASML. I suppose loss of diversification is an issue. ASML valuation is also at all time highs. But then if what I assumed previously is correct, in the long term does it matter?",

These companies are less mature than those in the NASDAQ 100 but with high growth potential.\n\nThe top holdings of QQQJ include Roku Inc (ROKU), Crowdstrike Holdings Inc (CRWD), The Trade Desk Inc (TTD), Zscaler Inc (ZS), Enphase Energy Inc (ENPH), AstraZeneca PLC (AZN), Take-Two Interactive Software Inc (TTWO), Old Dominion Freight Line Inc (ODFL), Fortinet Inc (FTNT), and Coupa Software Inc (COUP). Many of the most popular growth companies are included in this new ETF.\n\n#2) VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH)\n\nThe VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF tracks the semiconductor industry--one of the hottest industries of 2020. It isn\u2019t hard to be bullish on semiconductors when they are required by virtually all companies. Electric vehicles have put the spotlight on many semiconductor companies in the race for autonomous driving.\n\nThe VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH) has top holdings including: Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM), Nvidia Corp (NVDA), ASML Holding (ASML), Broadcom Inc (AVGO), Advanced Micro Devices Inc (AMD), Texas Instruments Inc (TXN), Intel Corp (INTC), Qualcomm Inc (QCOM), Micron Technology Inc (MU), and Analog Devices Inc (ADI). Semiconductors have had a killer year and the outperformance will likely continue in the future as demand for semiconductors increases.\n\n#3) Salesforce.com, Inc (CRM)\n\nSalesforce.com, Inc (CRM) develops cloud computing solutions for customer relationship management (hence the ticker \u201cCRM\u201d). Salesforce recently announced it was acquiring Slack Technologies (WORK) for over $27 billion. This deal was one of the largest acquisitions announced in 2020. Salesforce has fallen almost 15% since the acquisition announcement on fears it is overpaying in the Slack acquisition.\n\nHowever, Salesforce has continued to crush earnings estimates in the last quarters of 2020 with analyst consensus that this growth can continue. Salesforce operates in a growing market and continues to be the number one choice for customer relationship management.\n\n#4) Array Technologies, Inc. (ARRY)\n\nArray Technologies, Inc. (ARRY) is in the business of solar tracking solutions and services. The Company currently provides the DuraTrack solar tracking system and SmarTrack which is software that automatically adjusts module angles to compensate for environment changes.\n\nArray is quickly growing revenues with earnings and free cash flow remaining positive since 2019. The Company has stated its plans for continued growth and its willingness to make acquisitions. Array Technologies is a direct bet on the future of solar energy which will likely benefit under a democratic Whitehouse. This Company allows investors to invest in the future of solar without investing directly into solar panels.\n\n#5) Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (VRTX)\n\nVertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (VRTX) focuses on the treatment of cystic fibrosis through several drugs and has several ongoing clinical trials for the treatment of other diseases. Vertex collaborates with an impressive list of companies, including CRISPR Therapeutics (CRSP), Moderna (MRNA), and Merck &amp; Co. (MRK).\n\nVertex Pharmaceuticals has proven itself to be competent in developing market-leading drugs and securing lengthy patents on its treatments. The Company will continue to dominate the cystic fibrosis space in the future due to limited competition.\n\n**Honorable mentions:** CSIQ, AMZN, MSFT, PENN, ABBV, AZN, FUSE\n\n----\n\n**Note:** I hold positions in all of the mentioned companies and exchange traded funds.

        "selftext": "I'm curious as to what more educated folks think about the chip wars these days. Things got juicy back in the summer with INTC falling on it's face and AMD taking the reins. But now it seems that AMD has cooled off a bit while MU is making a strong move.\n\nWhere do you see these companies going? Will INTC make a comeback? I mean, the stock's fundamentals look pretty healthy. Was the last 6-7 rough months for INTC a realignment for the better?\n\nI finally took a position in this space with MU recently. I like how they're positioned in the DRAM and NAND markets...should be lots of demand in the future and they're a strong brand I think.",

        "selftext": "Original post: [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/c1v24n/success/)\n\nHi r/Stocks!\n\nA year and a half ago I posted here to celebrate hitting $16,000 USD from a $10,000 USD investment my mom gave me. I was 16 at the time and I am now 17, turning 18 in about a month. My stock picks included CRSP, ZIOP, FLEX, CELG (bought by BMY), TGT, IBM, and SGEN. You can see the amounts in my previous post. I entered the market on October 29, 2018.\n\nThe last time I posted there were concerns of underaged trading, but all trading was done through a custodial account by my mom. \n\nAnyways, when I posted the majority of responses told me to sell at least some of my position, but I decided not to. My account precede to grow to $19,500 before cashing down to $10,500 during the coronavirus crash. Now my account is at $33,000 and I am glad I never sold.\n\n Although I didn't mention it at the time , my mom also invest $10,000 in the stock market at the same time picking some of the same stocks as me, but also some of her own including QCOM, INTC, and TSLA (yup). I didn't mention it at the time because her account was not performing as well as mine. Now it is at $44,000. \n\nLast night I was able to convince my mom to sell her position in TSLA ($20,000) on the market open today. We both also sold other stock we didn't see much more potential in like TGT, FLEX and some USO we picked up when it was down. We made a nice profit on each of those picks. I now have $7,500 in cash and my mom has $24,000 in cash.\n\nI thought you all might like the update, so here it is. Also, last time I posted someone recommended picking up ENPH, which I didn't and is now up 500%. Oh well.",

        "selftext": "As many of you know, Apple is in talks with Hyundai to collaborate on an electric vehicle. Hyundai said they were \u201cin early talks with Apple\u201d.  Which confirms the rumors that they are in fact talking. [Article About Deal](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/08/hyundai-motor-says-it-is-in-early-talks-with-apple.html)\n\nBefore the rumors were confirmed, I doubted they were true. Apple hates working with other companies. They have made it a goal of theirs not to rely or parter with other companies to create their products. \n\nThey just recently they started making their own silicon [M1](https://www.apple.com/mac/m1/). They designed  and built their own silicon in house for their laptops and plan on eventually using in house silicon on the rest of the Mac products. All that just to cut the reliance on intel. Apple also uses their own chips in their phones and tablets unlike most of their main competitors. \n\nHyundai is one of the fastest growing electric vehicle companies in the world. Although we don\u2019t see electric Hyundai\u2019s in the United States. Here is a list of the [Top 10 Most Sold Electric cars](https://www.kbb.com/most-popular-cars/electric-car/2020/). Hyundai also bought robotics company [Boston Dynamics](https://www.forbes.com/sites/ralphjennings/2020/12/14/hyundai-buys-boston-dynamics-from-softbank-in-11-billion-deal/?sh=2b0095195341). Which is very very useful for self driving technology. Hyundai is looking to have one of the brightest futures in the electric vehicle space. \n\nI actually believe this partnership will end with Apple acquiring Hyundai. Take this with a grain of salt since there is not conformation of this. \n\nThe situation with Apple is very similar to what happened with beats, Apple bought them because they were the fastest growing headphone brand. The wireless headphone Industry was growing fast and the best way Apple thought they could catch up was by buying beats and using their technology and ideas to build their own headphone. Fast forward a few years and air pods have way more market share than beats. Apple also wanted their own modems in their phones. At the time they were using intel modems and so were they\u2019re competitors. Instead of developing their own modems, they bought [Intels Modem Division](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/26/apple-spends-1-billion-to-buy-intel-modem-business.html). They felt they want the best modems in their iPhone but didn\u2019t have the means to develop them, so they bought the intel modem division instead. \n\nI think a similar thing is happening with Hyundai, Apple wants to get in on the electric car market and they want to do it well. I believe that in typical Apple fashion, they will buy the company with the most value in the space and use them to make their own product. This strategy is something that most companies are not capable of but since Apple is such a big company, it really works for them. \n\nWhat do you guys think? It\u2019s somewhat of a shot in the dark but it would just make sense that Apple buys them.",

        "selftext": "Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning January 18th, 2021.\n\n# **Biden heads into inauguration with a stock market tailwind - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/15/biden-heads-into-inauguration-with-a-stock-market-tailwind.html)**\n*****\n&gt; President-elect Joe Biden moves into the White House in the coming week with the biggest stock market tailwind since a presidential Election Day going back to at least 1952.\n*****\n&gt; According to CFRA data that begins that year, the near 13% gain since Nov. 3 would be the biggest increase in the S&amp;P 500 between the election and inauguration if the gains hold. President John F. Kennedy\u2019s 8.8% gain had been the best, followed by President Dwight Eisenhower, with 6.3%, and President Donald Trump, with 6.2%.\n*****\n&gt; Biden\u2019s promise of the $1.9 trillion relief package he announced Thursday is one of the reasons for the stock market\u2019s surge, and it will be a big focus of markets in the week ahead as investors handicap its chances of winning congressional approval.\n*****\n&gt; The Martin Luther King Jr. Day holiday starts off the week, and over the next four days several dozen S&amp;P 500 companies report earnings. Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, IBM, Intel and Procter &amp; Gamble are among the companies reporting.\n*****\n&gt; # Biden will have no honeymoon\nThe $1.9 trillion stimulus package is at the top of the agenda. But there is also significant focus on whether his administration will be better at controlling the pandemic and rolling out the vaccine, as he has promised.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThis is the number he came in at. Where do negotiations go from here?\u201d Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial, said of the $1.9 trillion package. She pointed to worries about a weakening economy, evident in December\u2019s retail sales data, down a surprising 0.7%, and weekly jobless claims, at the worst level since August.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cYou could argue this is Covid-related and therefore what is most important going forward is to see the logistics of the vaccines, inoculations gain orderly momentum. That is crucial for the market,\u201d she said.\n*****\n&gt; Krosby said the market is focused on the inauguration.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThey want to see it go smoothly, and that there\u2019s not any security lapse. The market absorbed the events of Jan. 6. The market looked ahead and figured out that at this point it was a one-off, and the market ended higher on Jan. 6,\u201d she said. \u201cBut always the market becomes much more defensive if what we considered an isolated event suddenly broadens out.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; There will be heightened security surrounding the inauguration after a mob of Trump supporters assaulted the Capitol while Congress was in the process of confirming the Electoral College vote. The House last week voted to impeach Trump for inciting the mob, and now there is concern about further incidents in Washington or at state capitals.\n*****\n&gt; # Stimulus and stocks\nMarkets are also watching carefully to see whether Biden can bridge some of the deep divide between Republicans and Democrats, who now hold a thin majority in Congress.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe\u2019re getting stimulus, and now the question is \u2018OK, you\u2019re supposed to be this great compromiser,\u2019\u201d said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA.\n*****\n&gt; Political strategists expect Biden will get his stimulus package but it will be trimmed down. Ed Mills, Washington policy analyst at Raymond James, said the package could be cut to about $1 trillion based on the size previously discussed by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and outgoing Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cDoes Congress want to have a bipartisan show of support after what has been an extraordinarily tenuous beginning of this year, to put it mildly?\u201d Mills said. He said the stock market should continue to do well because it is going to get stimulus spending.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cD.C. is going to be there with more spending, or consumers are going to be there with more spending if they have the ability to get to a post-vaccine world sooner,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; Stovall said that if history is a guide, the stock market should do well with Biden. The average gain of the S&amp;P 500 in the first 100 days for Democratic presidents is 3.5%, going back to 1952.

Even then it was not observed by the NYSE until 1998. In the 23 years since, the market\u2019s performance during this four-trading-day week has been somewhat lackluster with average weekly performance negative for DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ, Russell 1000 and Russell 2000. Average losses range from 0.81% by DJIA to 0.16% by NASDAQ. Of the five indexes, not one has a record better than 50/50. However, since 2012 performance has shown signs of improving. DJIA, NASDAQ and Russell 2000 have risen in six of the last nine years. S&amp;P 500 and Russell 1000 have climbed in five of the last eight.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/67df4ce1594bee9748fb885a5316ff07/b5f21cb74511d020-c9/s500x750/218ed920ea1a67d95ff97fd05a5b9bbdf2454805.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Seasonal Soft Patch Ahead Starting Next Week\n\n&gt; With nine trading sessions of the New Year complete, January and 2021 are off to a solid start. DJIA is up 1.26% as of today\u2019s close, S&amp;P 500 stands at 1.05%, NASDAQ 1.74% and small caps, measured by the Russell 2000 are up a whopping 9.14%. These gains all point to and confirm the return of seasonality that we have recently noted.\n\n&gt; Last September was weak as it has historically been, then October exhibited it historical tendency toward volatility while November and December were both positive, in line with typical seasonal patterns. A positive Santa Claus Rally and First Five Days are also encouraging indications that seasonal forces are once again tracking. We expect seasonality will continue to present itself going forward as extraordinary efforts are made to quell the pandemic and return to a pre-Covid, open-for-business, way of life.\n\n&gt; Due to the reemergence of seasonality, we would not be surprised to see some market weakness in the second half of January next week that could persist throughout the rest of January and possible spill over into February. In the following seasonal pattern chart of January, the last 21 years of data for DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ, Russell 1000 and 2000 have been plotted with January 2021 through today\u2019s close plotted on the right vertical axis.\n\n&gt; Over the last 21 years, it has been NASDAQ leading at the halfway point, this year it is Russell 2000. Other than that, the major indexes have been tracking their historical patterns fairly well. There was strength early on, followed by sideways action. Should the current trend follow historical patterns then weakness after the eleventh trading day (January 18) is possible.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/c921e48e1e14dd8a61d2ad5cc18d7f94/f775f74bce597bb1-b6/s500x750/409599af0a5ca5a6fbb2ba71a5b1ead87d5852f8.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 5 Charts on the Democratic Blue Wave\n\n&gt; One of the top questions we\u2019ve received recently has been what a blue wave may mean for investments. After the Democrats won the two Senate runoff elections in Georgia, they will now control the White House and both chambers of Congress. Our January 11 Market Policy Projections for 2021 gave some of the immediate and longer-term policy impacts of the Democratic \u201cblue wave,\u201d and here we surf the blue wave with some interesting charts.\n\n&gt; First off, blue waves have not been bearish for stocks, with the S&amp;P 500 Index higher 6 of the past 7 times and up a respectable 9.1% on average since 1950.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Blog-1.15.21-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; We shared this chart in 2020, and it shows that historically, stocks do better if an incumbent president wins versus a new president in office. This makes sense, as a new president will bring in new policies and likely question marks\u2014while you know what you will get with a re-elected president. Remember, markets hate uncertainty and surprises.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Econ-blog-1.15.21-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; \u201cMake it all nine new Democratic presidents since 1900 to bring with them both the House and the Senate. In fact, stocks do quite well that first year under such circumstances, up nearly 12% on average,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cMaybe investors shouldn\u2019t fear a blue wave after all.\u201d\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, when a new Democratic president has brought with them the House and Senate, stocks gained that first year of their new presidency 6 of 8 times. What stands out to us for 2021, though, is the House majority is only 11\u2014the smallest for a new Democratic president since 1900.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/blog-1.15.21-3.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; Looking at all of the times the Democrats controlled the House (since the 35th Congress when it was Democrats and Republicans), the 11-seat majority is the lowest since 9 seats in 1879. Yes, the Democrats are in power, but this small majority will make it very tough for any of the more extreme policies to pass.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Econ-blog-1.15.21-4.png?ssl=1)**\n\n&gt; Lastly, the Senate is split a perfect 50/50, which is again extremely rare. In the chart below we share the seat difference between the two parties. \u201cA 50/50 Senate coupled with only an 11-seat majority in the House, and it is safe to say we have about as close to a perfectly divided government as we\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d said Detrick.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Econ-blog-1.15.21-5.png?ssl=1)**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Rest of the World Catching Up\n\n&gt; Over the past year, US equities\u2014proxied by the S&amp;P 500 (SPY)\u2014have consistently outperformed global equities more broadly. As shown below, over the past year the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) has risen just over 16%. That compares to 11.26% for the rest of the world as proxied by the Vanguard FTSE All-World ex US ETF (VEU). Breaking that down a bit further by developed and emerging markets, US equities have outpaced both emerging and other developed markets. While emerging markets (SPEM) are right on the heels of the US with just under a 14.78% gain, developed markets (SPDW) have lagged with just a 10.56% gain. So far in 2021, though, the rest of the world has been outperforming the US. Whereas SPY has risen around 1% YTD, VEU is up almost 3 times that. Emerging markets in particular have shown the greatest degree of strength currently having risen 3.87%. Meanwhile, SPDW has gained less (2.7%), though, it is still outperforming the US.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/01/011221-ETFs.png))**\n\n&gt; In the charts below, we show the ratio of SPY to these other ETFs. A rising line would indicate that the US is outperforming these other measures of global equities while a downward trending line indicates underperformance of SPY. As shown, the longer-term trend has pretty consistently been US outperformance over the past decade but that has faltered at the tail end of 2020 and into 2021. In the case of emerging markets, the line has been on the decline throughout the second half of 2020 as the ratio has hit its lowest level in a year in the past week. The S&amp;P 500's underperformance relative to other developed markets (SPDW) has been more recent as that line peaked in early September but the trend remains the same over the past few months with SPY weaker than global equities more broadly. That is further exemplified by the recent downtrend of SPY versus the All World ex US ETF (VEU).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/01/011221-RS2.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Small Business Owners Didn't Like the Election Results\n\n&gt; Today's release of the December Small Business Optimism Index from the NFIB saw a large drop as the index dropped from 101.4 to 95.9. After a sharp drop in the wake of the COVID outbreak, the index bounced back nicely but now looks like it's really rolling over.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/01/011221-NFIB-Small-Business-Chart.png))**\n\n&gt; Not only was this month's headline index weak, but it caught economists completely off guard. While the index fell to 95.9, economists were expecting a drop to 100.2. That 4.3 spread between the actual and expected reading was the biggest miss relative to expectations in more than five years (July 2015) and was the third weakest reading relative to expectations since the December 2012 report.\n\n&gt; Given the big drop in the headline index and the fact that it was so weak relative to expectations, should we be concerned about a double-dip? As an investor, we should always be worried about what could go wrong, but in the case of this report, you can probably wait for further confirmation from other data. The reason for the skepticism is that you could argue that politics plays a role in this report. To illustrate this, we would note that going back to 2010 (as far back as we have data) and right up through Election Day 2016, the NFIB only topped expectations 42% of the time. Following Trump's election in 2016, though, this index surged and has since topped expectations 63% of the time. Since Election Day 2020, though, the headline index has now missed expectations three times.\n\n&gt; From a longer-term perspective, dating back to 1974, the average reading of the NFIB Small Business Index during Republican administrations has been 100.1 while the average level under Democratic Presidents has been 96.2. Now, that would make sense if the economy was also in a recession more often in those periods, but over that same span, even though the percentages are low for both political parties (&lt;20%), the economy has actually been in a recession a higher percentage of the time during Republican administrations than it has in Democratic administrations.\n\n&gt; The lesson to take from all this is that even if it's often hard to separate when it comes to business or investing (or a lot of other aspects of our lives for that matter), it's usually best to leave politics outside.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/01/011221-NFIB-Small-Business-Survey.png))**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/yhXOGJz.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/DAPsqr2.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MOST ANTICIPATED EARNINGS RELEASES FOR FINANCIAL COMPANIES ONLY FOR THE NEXT 4 WEEKS!](https://i.imgur.com/aC5hzkZ.jpg))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MOST ANTICIPATED EARNINGS RELEASES FOR NASDAQ 100 COMPANIES ONLY FOR THE NEXT 4 WEEKS!](https://i.imgur.com/zIQniHK.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 1.18.21 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.

        "selftext": "**GameStop short squeeze is ON! Alibaba continues to push into the EV world. Intel spikes while AMD &amp; TSM suffer. Let\u2019s talk about this and other stock market news!**\n\nHello everyone and Good Morning! So, let\u2019s start with the recap of yesterday as we saw the stock market finishing mixed, with the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/qybhmjC) gaining .43%, the [SP500](https://ibb.co/YL4XS6m) also gaining .23% while the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/YTFwLcx) lost just 8 points to close out the day. We also saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/0r28dsT) dropping almost 5% again, continuing the downtrend after that huge spike with the Georgia elections, as it sits at similar levels to the ones before Christmas.\n\nDespite the positive gains for the broad stock market SP500, [OVERALL](https://ibb.co/PrDh7DD), we saw about 57% of the companies declining yesterday, with most of them trading below average volumes, as the number of companies trading above the 50-day moving average still sits over 70%, which is pretty high. Yesterday we saw 6 of the 11 [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/wJH4B8C) finish in the green with Real Estate and Utilities posting gains of more than 1% while the laggards were Energy, Industrials and Materials, as we saw large-cap growth companies finally [OUTPERFORMED](https://ibb.co/kKtRY96) for once in 2021, with small &amp; mid-caps giving up some of the big gains they have posted in this short year, though, Large-Cap Growth companies are still underperforming by 3% compared to the next factor group in 2021.\n\nHere is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/Ms0qkCh) from yesterday, which shows pretty mixed results as expected, with most of the big tech companies posting small gains like Apple, Amazon, Google, Netflix and the rest of the bunch, with Alibaba posting a 4% gain after some EV news popped up and Intel also gaining almost 7% and pushed the rest of the Semiconductors down with TSM and AMD both down over 3%.\n\nWe also got a lot of economic data yesterday as the US [DEFICIT](https://ibb.co/QXXDBrc) fell by $2B to $143B in December compared to the previous month, but is up 10 fold from the $13B deficit from the same period in 2019, and this doesn\u2019t even include any of the $900B stimulus packaged that passed late in December, while the December consumer price [INDEX](https://ibb.co/n1Jr9G2) increased by 0.4% m/m and Core CPI also increase by 0.1%, coming in-line with expectations, as the Atlanta FED business inflation expectations [ROSE](https://ibb.co/t2v98jw) to 2.2% in January compared to December, though sales and profit margins compared to normal, decreased since the last month, while one of the FED\u2019s Vice Chairs [RESTATED](https://ibb.co/WtNxQKM) that the FED won\u2019t raise rates until the average long-term inflation stands at 2% for a year.\n\n[Today](https://ibb.co/C79879d) we get lots of important economic data with Jobless numbers in the early morning, which are expected to come around the same numbers as the previous week and end with the Money Supply and FED Balance Sheet while the stock market will also turn its eyes to see what the FED Leader Powell announces in terms of the FED keeping the money printer going, and of course to see what Biden announces about a further stimulus packaged that is expected to be as big as $2T.\n\nIn some other stock market news, we saw [Intel](https://ibb.co/9bHNxrx) spiking yesterday after the company decided on a change in leadership, this move put some selling pressure on rival companies like TSM, AMD &amp; others, but I think this is more of a \u201chype move\u201d right now. Intel has still fallen behind it\u2019s competition and it will take massive Capex and R&amp;D investments to catch up, so the selloff in other players should rather be a buying point, especially for AMD.\n\nWe also saw [Target](https://ibb.co/Phk4N4s) reporting huge comp sale increases with a 4.3% increase in traffic and a massive 12.3% increase in the average ticket, as comparable digital sales more than doubled. \n\nWe also saw, their same-day services post an impressive growth of almost 200%, as they remain one of the best plays in the consumer discretionary sector, as 95% of their sales were fulfilled by their 1600 store that are within 10miles of \u00be of the US population.\n\nAlso, guys, these small cap companies keep on giving me reasons to come back to the same points I have been making in the past weeks, with company after company issuing shares, with the latest ones being [Nano](https://ibb.co/qDRKJ7Y) Dimension which are diluting their shares by about 20% while [Lemonade](https://ibb.co/27StT0c) has also increased their stock offering by another 300.000 shares.\n\nWhile in another kind of news we saw [GameStop](https://ibb.co/pLMSXrb) soar yesterday finishing the day up over 57%, after a huge short squeeze pushed the stock up as high as 90% at one point. This has happened after GameStop has [PUSHED](https://ibb.co/F3S2XTT) for a change in leadership with plenty of experience in the e-commerce and online marketing world, with 3 veterans from Chewy, which has been an impressive performer in the online e-commerce business. The [STOCK](https://ibb.co/y8XVnd7)  Is up another 20% in pre-market right now as the short squeeze keeps increasing the pressure on the bears.\n\nWe also saw [Alibaba](https://ibb.co/vjKdwKW) making a couple of headlines yesterday, which helped push the stocks 4% higher, after the Wall Street Journal reported that the US is expected to continue to allow investments in Alibaba, Baidu &amp; Tencent, while also continuing their charge into the [EV](https://ibb.co/0tVsJSS) world, with a new electric sedan that features wireless charging in cooperation with China\u2019s state owned SAIC Motor. This is their latest push into the EV world, as Alibaba is also an investor in Xpeng. This news, might help the stock see a recovery, that could be boosted if Jack Ma finally appears and the Ant Group IPO eventually receives the green light.\n\nAnd one last piece of [NEWS](https://ibb.co/Z8RSWQL) is that Affirm went public yesterday and started trading at just over 90$, more than 80% above the IPO price, as the IPO mania keeps on pushing any recent IPO to big pops on the first day of trading, but unfortunately, retail investors do not benefit from this, as the actual return for people who manage to buy right at the open price, is under 10% while also risking a severe drop in the next days. Hopefully more companies will move to direct listings IPOs which will allow retail investors to get part of the action, which will benefit most of the people, not just the \u201cbig players\u201d who get in at much lower prices.\n\nSo, let\u2019s hope for a good day in the markets as the [WORLD](https://ibb.co/T8wRNxc) Markets are in the green while the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/LkrrWtc) are also pointing to a good open.\n\n \ud83d\ude4fThank you everyone for reading!\ud83d\ude4f Hope you enjoyed the content!
