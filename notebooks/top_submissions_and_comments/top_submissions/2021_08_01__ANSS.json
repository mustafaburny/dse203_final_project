        "selftext": "As an investor, you may have the benefit of a custodian without giving much thought to the importance of their role. The Securities Exchange Commission\u2019s (SEC) custody rule requires that Registered Investment Advisors (RIAs) safeguard their client\u2019s assets, by imposing requirements designed to protect client funds and securities. Custodians also process trading, settling, and reconciling of assets purchased and sold. Additionally, they maintain all economic benefits to account owners including collecting income, corporate actions and proxy issues.\n\n#### Qualified Custodians\u00a0\n\nAn investment advisor is required to maintain client funds and securities with a qualified custodian, which can be a bank, registered broker-dealer and a few other types of entities. Examples of large custodians include Charles Schwab, TD Ameritrade and Fidelity. The qualified custodian either maintains client funds and securities in a separate account under the client\u2019s name or, in accounts under the name of the investment advisor, as agent or trustee for the clients. Second, the investment advisor opening the custodial account must promptly notify the client in writing of the qualified custodian\u2019s name, address, how the funds or securities are maintained when the account is opened and following any changes to this information. Account statements from the qualified custodian must be provided to the client at least quarterly, permitting advisory clients the opportunity to compare these statements with any statements they receive from the advisor.\n\n#### Annual Exams and Additional Protections\n\nIf the investment advisor has custody of client assets, they must enter into a written agreement with an independent public accountant to examine the assets on a surprise basis every year, with the examiner contacting some advisory clients to confirm their holdings with those listed on the advisor\u2019s records. If the qualified custodian is the investment advisor or, is affiliated, they must meet additional requirements, including obtaining an annual opinion from an independent public accountant regarding the effectiveness of the custodian\u2019s procedures for safeguarding client funds. Safekeeping of assets includes maintaining ownership, providing valuation, accounting, and reporting assets.\u00a0\n\n#### Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC)\n\nAn SIPC is a nonprofit organization that protects against the loss of cash and securities held by a customer at a SIPC member firm. The SIPC will cover up to $500,000 in securities, including a $250,000 limit for cash. In addition to SIPC, some custodians provide their customers with additional \u201cexcess of SIPC\u201d coverage through private insurers. The excess coverage is only used when SIPC coverage is exhausted and, like SIPC, does not cover investment losses due to market fluctuation or other investment losses.\n\n#### Steps Investors Should Take\n\nWhen working with an investment advisor, ask about the custodian they will use for your accounts, are they an SIPC member and do they provide an \u201cexcess of SIPC\u201d coverage. Will accounts be in your name or the investment advisor\u2019s name, as your agent? When you issue checks for deposit, always make your check payable directly to your custodian. If your investment advisor is registered with the SEC, you should always receive a separate statement, at least quarterly, directly from the custodian. Even with the protections offered by the \u201ccustody rule\u201d and SIPC, investors should exercise care when making investment decisions.  \n\n\n  \n[https://www.pantagraph.com/business/kingston-safeguarding-your-investments/article\\_9a55c4e8-12d2-554a-b6bd-3afaa429e29a.html](https://www.pantagraph.com/business/kingston-safeguarding-your-investments/article_9a55c4e8-12d2-554a-b6bd-3afaa429e29a.html)",

Yeah, I know you are.\n\nHere's one simple trick: learn to read a chart. Yes, these crayons seem to just be lines over a chart and spy only go up haha brrr. That is not the case. Indicators tell a story on when money will move in nd out of a security. SPY is a great chart for TA, because it works. SPY breaks ATH's every other day but yet you're constantly -80% on your 3DTE 450C.\n\nAs you know spy got absolutely hammered today, but if you go back the last 3 months SPY has drilled to earths core. On the 18th. Every single time. For the last 3 months. Last month in July the market was not open the 18th, so we drilled on the 19th. You get the point though. \n\nMay 18th: SPY Open: 415.80, Close 411.94\n\nJune 18th: SPY gapped down from 421.97 (6/17 Close), Open:  417.09, Close: 414.92\n\nJuly 19th: Open: 426.19, Close: 424.97\n\nAugust 18th: Open: 442.96, Close: 439.21 \n\n\"So, what you're saying is every 18th MM's or Algo's or JPOW or Bears or the Taliban or Drill Team 6 or Xi seem to push it down.\" No. Retard. It seems every 18th (or next trading day if 18th is a weekend) SPY tests its 50-day MA. (moving average). \n\nI wont get technical, but basically the 50MA is the closing price of the last 50 days added up divided by 50. \n\nToday was the 18th, yet we did not test the 50 day moving average. So, of course that means it will get tested tomorrow. Do not rush to buy 2DTE 443 calls tomorrow at open. \n\nThe currents 50-day MA seems to be hovering around 433-434. (50-day Simple MA= 433.37) (50-day Exponential MA= 433.91)\n\nSo it is possible we will see SPY drop to 433-435 before rebounding to ATH and printing calls as usual. This would be a great time to get into calls. but make sure it bounces off of this moving average first before getting into calls. If it manages to drill right past that 433-434 area, it is possible we could see SPY trading around 425. If you have calls and would like to save yourself from your  \\~\\~asshole\\~\\~ Portfolio being gaped, I suggest you wait for this level to be tested. I'm getting rid of my calls at open, buying puts to make back the gains from my calls that will get down tomorrow, sell at the bounce, and purchase more calls. \n\nMy positions: 4x 08/23 444c, 2x 08/23 444c, x2 08/27 445c, 1x 08/27 BABA 167.5p (not related, but BABA puts have been free money since July). Will be getting rid of my calls, day trading puts down to that level, then switch to calls once I see the rebound: or alternatively we break the 433 level and drill to the 420's and I ride the puts down.  \n\nTomorrow at close you will come back and thank me from saving your portfolio from none other than yourself. When you see that I am not a retard, you will enjoy my next post on why PFE will put me in a Ferrari next month.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR Stop being a retard and learn to read a chart. don't buy calls tomorrow until SPY tests the 50-day Moving Average at 433.37-433.91, then get into calls. If SPY manages to break 433, load the boat with puts and hold on to your tapered shorts, shit will get messy tomorrow and you will be forced to ask your boss for an advance on your paycheck.",

        "selftext": "A UK court has approved an over \u00a310 billion ($14 billion) class action suit against financial services corporation Mastercard for overcharging fees to millions of British consumers using their credit cards for payments.\n\nBritain\u2019s first mass consumer class action suit with 46 million claimants was brought by former financial ombudsman Walter Merricks to the Competition Appeal Tribunal (CAT), which formally approved it to proceed to trial on Wednesday.\n\nThe case will be probed under the Consumer Rights Act 2015, which entitles claimants, both consumers and small businesses, to compensation for Mastercard\u2019s alleged anti-competitive behavio\n\n\u201c*Mastercard has thrown everything at trying to prevent this claim going forward, but today its efforts have failed*,\u201d Merricks said in a statement on Wednesday.\n\nMerricks alleges that the global payments system charged unreasonably high interchange fees between May 1992 and June 2008, which resulted in higher prices for consumers and violated EU competition laws. The fees in question are paid by retailers to card-issuing companies when consumers use their cards to shop. The class action suit has been brought on behalf of all individuals over 16 years of age who bought goods and services from UK businesses via Mastercard in the specified period.\n\nThe CAT has not, however, included Merrick\u2019s claim for compound interest and claims from the estates of consumers who died between 1992 and 2008 in the case. According to Mastercard, this reduced the claim\u2019s size to around \u00a310 billion from the initial \u00a315 billion. The company is hopeful that further proceedings will cut the overall claim even more.\n\n\u201c*The decision reduces the value of this spurious claim by more than 35%.

        "selftext": "In summary, I expect another wave of lockdowns to go into effect, but they will go into effect too late, and do too little to have any effect on containing the next COVID19 Delta Variant outbreak. \n\nUnfortunately, I also don't think there's any market play beyond building up 12 months of cash for rent/daily expenses, and to stockpile on toilet paper now before the next shopping spree starts.\n\nIn general, when dealing with disease, the public health options are development of a cure, development of vaccine, or implementation of quarantine. Remdesivir is the only available treatment, and requires IV application, and thus is not effective for widespread use. Regarding quarantine, I point you to the news.\n\nRegarding the vaccine, it seems that the recent mRNA vaccines only have \\~50% efficacy in preventing infection. The CDC tracked an outbreak in Massachusetts due to a July 4th party in Provincetown, MA\n\n[https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7031e2.htm?s\\_cid=mm7031e2\\_w](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7031e2.htm?s_cid=mm7031e2_w)\n\nThe study shows a nearly 1:1 infection count of vaccinated to unvaccinated individuals. \n\nFor those of you not in the know, this is one of the biggest LGBTQ parties in the US, so is pretty left leaning. We can assume a pretty high vaccination rate. This is actually good for vaccine efficacy due to Simpson's paradox, but it does show that breakthrough infection is real, and not to be underestimated. The CDC did not estimate vaccine efficacy and warned not to do so due to small sample sizes.\n\nThe UK did.\n\n[http://hdl.handle.net/10044/1/90800](http://hdl.handle.net/10044/1/90800)\n\nBased on their REACT study, which randomly samples ALL UK residents, and not just sick people, they estimate a vaccine efficacy of 50%-60%. Do note that the error bars on these numbers are BIG, like 20%-95% big.\n\nThe vaccine seems to be on par to a flu shot in terms of efficacy. Unfortunately, flu has an r0 of 1-2. The original COVID19 had an r0 of 2-3, and delta looks to be 4-9.\n\nGiven delta is about 2x-3x more transmissible, and the vaccine is 1/2 has effective, lockdowns and masking are inconsistent, I'd estimate we're going to see COVID spread on par to the early pandemic. We're currently back to infection numbers similar to Nov/Dec 2020. Even if all vaccine hesitancy vanished overnight, given the mediocre efficacy coupled with high r0, vaccinations must be coupled with social distancing to control the spread. \n\nGiven human nature and politics, a lockdown NOW could theoretically control the spread. That is politically unviable. A lockdown later will be too late due to exponential growth, but will occur anyway once bodies start to hit the floor. \n\nThe doctor's haven't figured out why the vaccine isn't working, it could be waning immunity amongst the early vaccinations, or just a poor match. This would necessitate a booster, which the WHO just announced a moritorium on so poor countries can get vaccinated, or a delta specific booster, which Pfizer and Moderna are working on, but there's no data if it works or not. Of course, rich countries will likely give the WHO the finger, but this only helps if this is waning immunity and not vaccine mismatch.\n\nSo, what's this mean for the markets? Likely \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b \n\nBut in the mean time, everything's stupid expensive and I have no idea if/when this would occur. So, I'll give the personal finance advice to keep 6-12 months of cash to pay for rent/food if everything goes to shit. Even assuming that an uncontrolled pandemic occurs, I'd estimate a COVID-19 mortality of 1%-3% to not permanently cripple the economy. Unless your country is like Peru with a case mortality rate of \\~10%, in which case you're pretty f\\*cked. \n\n[https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/mortality](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/mortality)\n\nBoomers are probably going to get killed by this virus, so investing in Zacks Funeral Services industry may be a good call: SCI, HI, MATW, CSV. Unfortunately, the market looks like they already priced this in.\n\nSo, stay safe. Get vaccinated. Socially distance. But it probably won't be enough.",

        "selftext": " \n\n**PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, August 17, 2021**\n\nStocks fell firmly on Tuesday, with the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Dow Jones retreating from record levels yesterday amid a mixed batch of earnings results from major retailers and new economic data regarding retail sales. Looking ahead, market participants are waiting to hear from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, who is scheduled to speak later this week. Market participants will be waiting to see if there is any new information regarding a potential taper timeline. \n\nShares of Dow component Walmart (WMT) fell even after the big-box retailer posted second-quarter results that blew past estimates and raised its full-year guidance. Stimulus check spending, strong grocery demand and e-commerce sales helped push U.S. comparable sales excluding gas up by 5.5%, topping estimates but still slowing from last year's 9.9% surge. Home Depot (HD), meanwhile, missed on comparable sales for the second quarter, with these rising 4.5%, way below consensus estimates of a 5.5% increase. \n\nAccording to the Department of Commerce, for the month of July, retail sales in the US fell 1.1%, much higher than the drop of 0.3% expected and below the 0.7% increase in June, a sign that economic activity is slowing down, likely to the surge in the coronavirus delta variant and government stimulus drying up. Consumer spending makes up nearly 70% of US GDP, so market participants closely track these reports. \n\nChina released economic data for July that showed growth rates slow down dramatically as the world\u2019s second largest economy battles with summer flooding and the resurgence of coronavirus thanks to the highly contagious delta variant. Industrial production, a gauge of activity in the manufacturing, mining and utilities sectors, grew by 6.4% year-over-year in July, a sharp deceleration from the 8.3% rise in June and below the 7.9% growth expected. Retail sales, a key measurement of consumer sentiment in the world\u2019s most populous nation, grew by 8.5% in July, way below the 12.1% increase in June and missing the 11.5% expected by economists. \n\nThe National Bureau of Statistics noted \u201cthe impact of multiple factors including the growing external uncertainties and the domestic COVID-19 epidemic and flooding situation,\u201d according to a release. The bureau added that the \u201ceconomic recovery is still unstable and uneven.\u201d\n\nLooking ahead, market participants are set to receive the Federal Open Market Committee's July meeting minutes (which are basically notes of what was discussed) on Wednesday, offering more context around how much more amenable central bank officials have become to the notion of tapering their crisis-era asset purchases as the economic recovery takes place. As I have said in the past, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if there is more discussion about a potential timeline to begin tapering quantitative analysis, though I remain unconcerned. While the markets may react negatively, the real test will be in 2022 when discussions of raising the interest rates are brought to the table.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen doubled down on her support of President Joe Biden's plans increase investments in physical and human infrastructure in [an op-ed published on Yahoo Finance Tuesday.](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/infrastructure-bill-a-down-payment-on-the-economy-america-can-and-should-have-133058095.html) \n* Microsoft (MSFT) is investing in software startup Rubrik Inc. and the two companies will combine on products that will help customers hit by ransomware recover their critical data without paying hackers.\n* The Chinese government is at it again. In their latest move, CChinese tech companies lost roughly a combined $50 billion in market cap today after the government proposed a sweeping new rules on how companies collect and use user data. Alibaba (BABA) is now at the lowest price since late 2019.\n* The world's largest nonfinancial companies had a record $6.85 trillion in cash on their balance sheets as of the end of the second quarter, according to data from S&amp;P Global Ratings. (Banks and other financial firms are usually excluded from corporate cash lists because they are required to hold a lot of money in cash due to the nature of their daily business operations)\n* **\\*\\*Please note that current stock price was written premarket and does not reflect closing prices\\*\\***\n* Accenture (ACN) target raised by JP Morgan from $308 to $364 at Overweight.

        "selftext": "Disclaimer: This is not a financial advice, and I am no expert. I have a position in $CLOV and below is my reasoning on why I am bullish on $CLOV. \n\nI have some professional experience in U.S. healthcare and have analyzed Medicare claims data. Healthcare spending in the U.S. is HUGE and the system is very complex. I am not going to talk about all that here but feel free to refer to [United States Health Policy](https://www.edx.org/course/united-states-health-policy) for more info. Clover Health is here to disrupt it in few years.\n\n[Clover Health](https://investors.cloverhealth.com/static-files/ed2bc09d-cd96-4759-897e-862c2b250213) offers Medicare Advantage plans and Clover Assistant (a point of care platform). About 10,000 baby boomers are joining Medicare every day and this number is expected to go up even more if the new $3.5 trillion infrastructure bill is passed. Clover Health offers superior MA plans and has wider physician network. Clover Assistant is personalized for every member and their physicians. You are at a higher risk of developing heart diseases if you have high cholesterol, high BP, Diabetes, family history of heart diseases etc. Clover Assistant uses machine learning to help physicians make better decisions by identifying high risk patients through analyzing large amounts of claims and diagnostic data. This is highly scalable and cost efficient. Clover Health disrupts healthcare by combining their MA plans and Clover Assistant to provide a pleasant healthcare experience. This may allow Clover Health to receive incentives from CMS (Next Generation ACO Model). Their employees are among the highly talented in their fields which further strengthened my confidence in $CLOV. This is a long term play.\n\nTl;dr: Long $CLOV",

        "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nI have noticed that's there so much negativity and fear about the CCP wrt Alibaba on this subreddit which I think is extremely unlikely and very unreasonable.\n\nI appreciate that some have extremely entrenched positions and would thumbs-down me, but here are the reasons why I think Alibaba is safe stock to buy:\n\n***(1)*** Why would President Xi - who has overseen the greatest transformation his nation has ever experienced - suddenly cut the international investment pool that made that wealth and transformation possible. He has been elevated to the level of Mao in the party. See this amazing BBC article: [China's ruling Communist Party has voted to enshrine Xi Jinping's name and ideology in its constitution, elevating him to the level of founder Mao Zedong](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-41730948). President Xi is the embodiment of China's destiny. China intends to become the major international player of the world. President Xi is the modern China: communism with Chinese characteristics. Why on earth would he cut off international investment and relegate China back to penury. Anyone who reads anything about China can see just how ambitious and determined they are to be elevated.\n\n***(2)*** The Chinese anti-trust arm of the state has levied a $3B fine. If they levied a fine, then that suggests they looked at the company, thought about it, and made the decision as to how they would deal with Alibaba/Jack Ma. Why would they go back and reopen the file and add extra fluff? If they were going to make any additional pronouncement or proclamation they would have then. The CCP is perfectly aware of the Cayman Islands arrangement - and have not said a word against it. It suggests they don't object to international investment - they object to CEOs who get ahead of themselves. The fine was a trivial slap on the wrist. The state reminded Jack Ma of his place. I wish the US antitrust state was much tougher with American IT/Tech companies. The EU has been fining Google and Facebook much larger sums - and without much pain being felt by shareholders. Companies like Alibaba don't need the 3B cash to operate their enterprise. That's why they were fined that sum. It was to make a point. Case closed, and they moved onto other tech companies in turn.\n\n***(3)*** Why would President Xi jeopardise the thousands of employees who have jobs at BABA (and other Chinese Tech firms), and all the other industries and people who depend &amp; rely on those tech jobs - when there is no obvious replacement by the central committee for those people. China has a huge population and there would need to be a replacement for IT services for the citizens and they would need to provide jobs and industries. Well, communism and state engineering didn't work and the CCP is perfectly aware that the centralised organisation of the means of production leads to starvation. Unless the state will intercede in all tech industries (as interntional investment would disappear), then China goes back to being hungry. \n\n***(4)***  Alibaba is crown jewel of China. It's a source of national pride. Jack Ma is a Chinese man who achieved something incredible. Why would the Chinese state destory its own hero story. How many countries have trillion-dollar market cap companies? President Xi will have signed the death sentence for the CCP.",

        "selftext": "# Major US indices pulled back Friday, but not all that much. I believe we are almost at a tipping point for an after summer correction, which will pull down the market across the board, gearing up for a run into the holiday season.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1bcspupbkue71.png?width=864&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=02a41e032419f26faad300dd4bb7390095aacc6e\n\n Only one alert triggered Friday and that was an $**ABNB** put.  After starting on this project, I believe that $**ABNB** is overvalued and doesn't have the sustainability that the current market price implies. Therefore, I've put in two put alerts. Go small.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ejhnm9agkue71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=40397c1f5393200798dd4c6033b186b808f6d782\n\n A better positions that I would prefer is entering into a bigger put at the YTD VWAP. I have already set an alert for this stronger resistance, but there is no guarantee if and when it will reach it.  \n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n#  Positions from Last Week\n\n**Ongoing** \t\t(I will consider cutting if Monday starts off red; still plenty of time left on)\n\n**$COIN** **-0.2%** (Shares)\n\n**$CAT -10%** (Calls)\n\n**$LOGI -7.2%** (Calls)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**New**\n\n**$ABNB +1.3%** (Puts)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n### Closed\n\n**$TSLA +10% (**Closed)\n\n**$EBON +29%** (Closed)\n\n**$IRM +25%** (Closed)\n\n**$TSLA** \\+**117%** (Calls) \n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n#  New and Adjusted Alerts \n\n $**HOOD** IPO'd last week and I will be waiting to enter at $10... (Just Kidding) I'm staying away from **Robinhood** for now.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j2n60j2pkue71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9b8caa6b52af8d8929c9c14ba5553cd9a6df1037\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n After a great week with $**TSLA** calls, I've entered in another similar alert as the last two. If **Tesla** pulls back to the 50MA, I'll buy more calls. However, there is a chance that $**TSLA** keeps running next week therefore I am not interested in short term puts.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xusig0cqkue71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=22d5c663bbebc6b93cb2bf8f818047304dcf42da\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n $**MT** is looking a little bit overbought, and even though I and many other analysts are bullish long term, I believe that this can be a good time to lock in some quick profits. Once it consolidates toward the 50MA, or even the YTD VWAP, we can re-enter with calls.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ju2q5ggrkue71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bd9e8be9ff1955c146f200b161d86d67da242b7a\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n I'm really liking $**CRM** going into August. The 180MA is approaching a large volume shelf that indicates a lot of buying will happen there. More so, the YTD VWAP is lurking at those levels as well. Long term bullish on **Salesforce**, and August is historically one of the best months for the stock. October or November calls, look tempting around the $230 level.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/udz6h6jskue71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=07559317d5d5618e74012c3ab7e3ae858b4b86db\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n \n\n$**TSM**, **Taiwan Semiconductor**, is, I believe, an undervalued company that has a fair price of around $130+. This is a great opportunity to pick up calls for November or EOY. September and October are some of the best months for **TSM** according to Trend Spider's Seasonality Chart. At current levels, the 50, 180, and a huge volume shelf are converging. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/21u9xyiukue71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0c03a9034effbf1c0594ba5aa34a48a6db2978b4\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n $**AXP** has had an amazing run this year August is one of the better months over the past decade. I believe consumer spending has and will increase and monthly calls or vertical spreads are perfect here.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jpgpa2hvkue71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0c2b50116bebade25f92b68a5e8f9b4437295997\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n **$AAP, Advance Auto Parts**, is still an interesting play for me. Everyone has probably heard by now that used car prices have gone up a lot. If we can get a consolidation around the 50MA, I think it is worth it to buy calls. However, I won't be waiting much longer for this one. I'll give it another week.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g655tlewkue71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0966c88748b44fd8f3317333e8233339c43c3644\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n $**VRT** also had a good week, up from the 50MA. I'm waiting for a resistance bounce to enter some short term puts.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r3kkaddxkue71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=87d502222fa3701d87bf608c6284efa2dbc8fad2\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n I'm still waiting for **$X, US Steel**, to pull back to the 180ma. As you can see last it just came off a 180ma bounce, but not quite low enough to hit my trigger. I'm a patient man and I'll wait again. This is a good play going into October and November, so we have some time to enter.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/09oy8sgykue71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ea114b1ade318baa53487eac738ca13ff3002470\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n **$AI** is to overhyped, and puts at upper resistance will pay significantly in my opinion. I've reupped the time on this alert and will wait for a bounce to enter.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/snkwzjizkue71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=acdd5c9d6fa626471ff21cf572b84a84a18343c7\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n One of my favorite shorts is $**EBON**. Probably by now you know I have personal experience with this company. Sort them into the ground, please. This time the alert is set to trigger at the 50 MA and I'll go into a bigger position.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bgr3pqj0lue71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=20bef00a73ba2a1e68a0f2e2af0930cede9b9a95\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n $**ETSY** is next and the interesting thing about this stock, since its IPO, it has never had a positive October. I will be keeping this in mind when I buy calls at support. September usually is a good month. Getting in and out of this one is most likely the key.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/whhewch1lue71.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=58fd6d95a96e7fb55d0089c593522f3863b47043\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n ^(Disclaimer: The comments opinions and analysis expressed herein are for informational and educational purpose only and should not be considered as individual advice or recommendations.)",

        "selftext": "**The Challenge:** *Double a $30K account in four months - 88 trading days, without using low float momentum trades. This is the update after two weeks, or ten trading days.*\n\n**The Reason:** *I set up this account specifically for this challenge.  Posting trades from my regular account was not instructive - mainly because, the trades were not relatable (e.g. most people are not buying 10 ITM TSLA calls that are 3 weeks out).  However, I wanted to show traders that it is possible to quickly grow your Day Trading account without having to do low float momentum trades (which is a fast way for traders, especially new traders, to lose a lot of money).  Instead, this challenge intends to utilize foundational Day Trading methods (i.e. Relative Strength to SPY) in a completely transparent way.  The amount I chose to start with was $30, as the federal guidelines requires $25K to Day Trade and I added $5K for some cushion.*\n\nIn order to reach this goal I would need to average $341 a day.  \n\nEvery trade since this challenge has started has been live posted in r/RealDayTrading as they happen.\n\nI am also providing the link to the accounts' TraderSync log.  Here is the updated log as of the end of day today:\n\n[https://shared.tradersync.com/hariseldon2021](https://shared.tradersync.com/hariseldon2021)\n\nI have not finished updating the \"setups\" and \"mistakes\" in Tradersync, I will do that this weekend.\n\n*Note: There are still some open positions that TraderSync does not report until they close, including calls for* ***DDOG*** *and puts for* ***CL.***  *As well as an open* ***/ES*** *short.  Thus, the total is overstated by about $1,700.  Only closed trades are included.*\n\nAlso being carried into next week are **IR** calls, **MA** puts, **SFIX** puts, **SNAP** calls and **SPCE** calls.\n\nThe total account value is at $35,321.48, almost $1,000 over goal.  \n\nCommissions and Fees paid so far: $669.82\n\nTotal number of trades: 223 - with 30 trades considered \"Breakeven\" (*within $25)* and 8 open trades.  Of the 185 remaining trades that were either winners or losers:\n\nWinners: 139 - 75.1%\n\nLosers: 46 - 24.9%\n\n**Notes:** Computer issues limited me to only a few trades today, and I took part of yesterday off.\n\nI made several mistakes (**PINS, MRNA**) that I outlined in other posts, and Ameritrade closed a lotto trade last Friday which cost me roughly $500 in profit. \n\nThis challenge is not for me to prove anything about my trading - to be honest, I do not need to - I have traded for a living for the past 3 years, make a good living out of it and have absolutely no need for validation.  However, after posting on the various trading forums here and speaking to hundreds of traders over the past two years, several things have become clear:\n\n1) Most people believe Day Trading is primarily *Gap n Go* strategies, which is what most so-called \"gurus\" market to people.  **This is not Day Trading**.  In fact, this method is *extremely difficult* and the last thing new traders should be trying.\n\n2) Everyone else believes that it is impossible to be a consistently profitable Day Trader.  Now I know this isn't true, because I am one.  Many of the professional Day Traders I know, also know this isn't true, since they do it as well.  Unfortunately, people here got it into their heads that 95% fail and technical analysis is bullshit.  Well most people *do fail* but that is because nobody tells them how difficult it is, and how much time (about two years of training) and effort it takes.\n\nSo I set up r/RealDayTrading to be a place where people can learn how to actually do this for a living.  I am not selling anything, have no desire to have any channel and do not have a product.   Once again, don't need it, don't want it.   However, I did want a place where other pros could come and teach people how to Day Trade without constantly being attacked by trolls (shocking I know, but Reddit has trolls).  I am very thankful that several of them agreed to come on board as mods and have been posting excellent content.   However, advice only goes so far - hence, this challenge.\n\nI hope some of you are finding it helpful.\n\nSee you next week!\n\nBest - H.S.",

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, August 2, 2021**\n\nStocks continued volatility from last week, with the three major indexes opening the day in the green before turning lower towards the end in the first trading session in August. As has been the case for at least a few weeks now, it seems the market will continue to perform a careful balancing act between record corporate profits and expectations for economic expansion and concerns surrounding the highly contagious coronavirus Delta variant and inflation. \n\nSo far, 59% of the companies in the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) have reported Q2 earnings, with 88% of these beating analyst expectations, according to FactSet. This quarter is shaping up to be another record-breaking one, with corporate earnings growth rate expected to accelerate 85%, which would be the biggest jump since the Q4 20009. \n\nHowever, it is important to note that, despite beating earnings expectations, a number of these companies have pulled back, with tepid outlooks moving forward overshadowing strong results. Moving forward, given that most companies have so far exceeded pre-pandemic levels and the current quarter has an easy comparison to last year, expectations for growth are inevitably going to moderate. This said, I think the pullback in some stocks following earnings is an overreaction. \n\nIn the last few weeks, concerns over the coronavirus Delta variant are increasing, which inevitably, has injected volatility in the markets. Last week, the CDC reversed their indoor mask policy. The agency now recommends that even fully vaccinated individuals begin once again wearing masks indoors in areas with high coronavirus transmission and in K-12 schools. Dr. Rochelle Walensky, Director of the CDC said, \u201cIn areas with substantial and high transmission, CDC recommends fully vaccinated people wear masks in public, indoor settings to help prevent the spread of the delta variant, and protect others. This includes schools\u201d. \n\nAs I have said before and will explain further below, while the surge in cases is unfortunate, it is important to note that the surge is largely concentrated in areas with high vaccine hesitancy. Moreover, while cases are surging, thankfully, hospitalizations and death rates are much lower when compared to previous surges, a sign that the vaccine is doing its job. While it doesn\u2019t prevent one from becoming infected, it greatly reduces the possibility for complications. \n\nIn the US, despite roughly 50% of the population being vaccinated, in the past two weeks, infections across the country have roughly doubled, with new cases jumping from 13,200 on July 4 to 78,433 as of July 31, according to data compiled by John Hopkins University. However, it is important to note, despite the surge the 7-day average of deaths is 360, once again according to John Hopkins University. \n\nAccording to data from the CDC, 97% of people who have died or been hospitalized with COVID-19 since the vaccine became widely available are unvaccinated. Dr Rochelle Walensky, Director of CDC said of the rising cases, \u201cThere is a clear message that is coming through. This is becoming a pandemic of the unvaccinated. Our biggest concern is we are going to continue to see preventable cases, hospitalizations, and sadly deaths among the unvaccinated.\u201d Sadly, despite the widespread availability of the vaccine in the US, hesitancy in certain places remains very high.\n\nMoreover, last week, the Fed released its July Monetary Policy Report largely reiterated what members of the Fed have been saying for months, but did include some new language hinting that the economic recovery is getting closer to the Fed\u2019s stated goals. The report also acknowledged potential risks and stated the Fed was ready to act if \u201cappropriate risks arise\u201d. The statement read, \u201cIn assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee's goals. The Committee's assessments will take into account a wide range of information, including readings on public health, labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments.\u201d\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* In a big industry move, Square (SQ) acquired Australian fin-tech company Afterpay, which allows customers to pay in installments, for $29 billion in an all-stock transaction. Square released a statement that read, \u201cSquare plans to integrate Afterpay into its existing Seller and Cash App business units, enable even the smallest of merchants to offer BNPL \\[buy now, pay later\\] at checkout, give Afterpay consumers the ability to manage their installment payments directly in Cash App, and give Cash App customers the ability to discover merchants and BNPL offers directly within the app.\u201d\n* Along with the Afterpay announcement, SQ unexpectedly announced Q2 earnings, which showed gross profit growing 91% thanks to strong Cash App and Seller ecosystem growth. The company reported revenue of $4.68 billion, 87% growth year-on-year but below the the $5.03 billion expected. Earnings per share skyrocketed to $0.66 compared to $0.30 expected.\n* Google announced it was moving away from Qualcomm (QCOM) and would begin manufacturing its own in-house processors for new Pixel phones launching later this year. This follows a similar move to what Apple (AAPL) did to Intel (INTC).\n* Ford Motors (F) Chief Financial Officer John Lawler said the company hopes to reinstate a dividend by the end of the year. He said, \u201cWe've had a really tough period of time here the last couple of years with Covid last year and now the chip shortage. We plan to bring the dividend back as soon as we can...depending on how the second half goes with \\[computer\\] chips, it could be as early as the end of this year.\u201d Ford suspended its dividend last year.\n* Electric vehicle sales in China more than tripled in July compared to a year ago. \n   * Nio delivered 7,931 vehicles in July, 124% increase YoY\n   * Xpeng (XPEV) delivered 8,040 vehicles, 228% increase YoY\n   * Li (LI) delivered 8,589 vehicles, 251% increase YoY\n* \\*\\***Please note that current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect closing prices\\*\\***\n* Abbvie (ABBV) with two target raises.

        "selftext": "In my last post, I went over how to value stocks based on the discounted cash flow of a company. If you haven't read it yet, [start here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/o8ygn4/how_stocks_are_valued_part_1_discounted_cash_flow/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) This post will go over ***relative valuation***, rather than the absolute value of a company.\n\n# Comparables\n\nWhen you're buying a house, how do you determine what the fair value of the house is? Appraisers often look at similar homes in the neighborhood to get an idea of how much the house should be worth.\n\nIf the house on 123 Potato Street were similar to all the other houses on Potato Street but was selling for 20% more than the average, odds are it's not going to sell. This concept of comparing assets to similar assets also applies in stock valuation.\n\n# How Do We Compare Stocks?\n\nRemember that stocks just represent a fraction of a company's future earnings. For similar companies with similar industries, earnings, and, $1 in earnings for company A should be worth the same as $1 of earnings for company B.\n\nA lemonade stand that makes $10 on Potato Street should be worth about the same to an investor as a lemonade stand that makes $10 somewhere else in the same neighborhood. If one is valued at $100 and the other at $120, the first lemonade stand might be undervalued.\n\nThere are several metrics we can use to compare stocks. Some ratios include:\n\n1. Price to Earnings (P/E). This ratio is calculated by dividing the stock price by its earnings per share. For example, WFC and BAC are (at a glance) similar companies since they're both in the same industry. It makes sense that they have similar P/E ratios, with WFC at 13.16 and BAC at 12.83. However, we see that BAC is relatively cheaper as we pay less for each dollar of earnings compared to WFC.\n2. Price to Sales (P/S). This is similar to P/E, except that we compare the stock price to the revenue of a company instead of its earnings. This is good for companies that aren't profitable yet, since comparing negative P/E ratios seems a bit silly. Uber, for example, has a P/S of 7.40. If we use only P/S to compare Uber to Lyft, which has a P/S of 8.71, UBER seems to be the better investment since we're paying less for each dollar of revenue.\n3. Price to Earnings Growth (PEG). This ratio measures the stock price as a ratio to the company's earnings growth (typically over the next 1-3 years). This ratio is calculated as the P/E divided by the earnings growth rate. For example, if AAPL has a P/E of 28.3x and a growth rate of 1.3%, AAPL has a PEG of 22.6x. MSFT has a higher P/E (35.09x), but because of its higher growth rate of 8.9%, has a much lower PEG of 3.92x.\n\nWe can use these ratios (and others) to identify whether stocks are relatively undervalued compared to other similar stocks, or we can compare stocks to the industry average. If we buy companies that are relatively cheaper compared to their peers, we should (in theory) perform better over time.\n\n# Short Term Relative Value Trading Strategies\n\nWe can also make relative value in the short term. \n\nA common retail trader\u2019s strategy is to buy a stock for a few days or a few weeks, hoping to scalp a few dollars and turn a profit. However, what if the market drops? Your stock could outperform the market by only falling 3% while the market falls by 10%. You were right but you still lost money due to your market exposure.\n\nHedge funds also bet on stocks, except instead of looking for a return on a single stock, they bet on stocks going up or down relative to another. They buy stock A and short-sell stock B, hoping A will outperform B. This is aptly named the Long-Short trading strategy or the pairs trade. If A falls 3% but B drops 5%, the hedge fund makes money overall.\n\n# Short Term Relative Value Trade Examples\n\nHow can we apply this to our trading? What if we think GME will outperform AMC? At $161 its may or may not be a good idea to be strictly long GME. However, we can hedge by shorting AMC. If all meme stocks crash, we still make money as long as GME doesn\u2019t fall as much as AMC does. If GameStop stays flat, we make money when AMC falls. (Of course, if you think AMC is the winner you can just inverse the above strategy)\n\nWe can apply this strategy to stocks in similar industries such as GM/F, V/MA, and KO/PEP.\n\nA second example would be a pairs trade I closed earlier last week.\n\nGoogle has two classes of (publicly traded) shares: GOOGL (Class A) which has voting rights, and GOOG (Class C) which has none.\n\nTheoretically, GOOGL should always be more expensive because they have voting rights, but because Alphabet is conducting share buybacks of GOOG exclusively, GOOGL was cheaper for a while - [We can see this in the trading view chart here.](https://imgur.com/a/Qng5vyG)\n\nBy buying GOOGL and shorting GOOG, I\u2019m betting the gap between the two stocks will close. I don\u2019t care if the market rises, falls, or goes sideways. I don\u2019t even care if google falls 50%. The only thing I\u2019m betting on is that GOOGL will be the same price as GOOG eventually, and after Alphabet announced it would start buybacks of both share classes, the gap closed.",

Still one of the best plays for me this month has been puts on **EBON**. As some of you may know, I have personal experience with this company. I've been in their industry since 2016 and they are known as a joke company in my industry circles. No one in their right minds actually wants to buy their hardware. More so, I've visited their factory outside of Hangzhou and it is one of the most dirty computer manufacturers I've every seen. It is an easy decision to buy puts. Every time it touches the 50MA, I buy. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lvps2oi391h71.png?width=1208&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=37601245dd5ea381206b194adbeb14614effbeda\n\n# New Plays I'm Considering\n\nAn interesting opportunity, pointed out by a member of the Discord, to buy puts on $**YUM**. The stock is very overbought at the moment, and closing in on some sort of upper resistance that dates back exactly a year. I think that this is is a good chance to get cheap puts and right them down to at least the 20MA, maybe 50MA.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/q5ym0twbb1h71.png?width=1143&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=277d78ffcc715daba5a5db9a0d2b4a867298214d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n The financial sector is hot right now, to hot. Let's get some cheap puts on $**GS** if it bounces on the upper resistance that has formed more than a year ago. I like playing the bank stocks, as they are easier to predict. More of the same story for the **GS** put, ride it back to the 50MA.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/l7zsx16fb1h71.png?width=1150&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3f477434519dbb1310d41cee4afae0ebec7eb7a6\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n \n\nI like **NFLX**, but not so much. If **Netflix's** price consolidates more toward support, which it bounced on 5 times over the past year, I see myself going into some more dollar heavy calls. I think 3-4 months out, around a $550 strike work best here. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/o9ogdy2ib1h71.png?width=1151&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8c69f868452ae9fce105c14521fdb81cdc1a9b9c\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n I used to like $**NIO** and the other Chinese electric car manufacturers, now I like them even more. Beijing has given their approval in pushing this industry forward for the 'betterment of society'. I did a [review on the ES6/8 on YouTube ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvT3RLVPm6A&amp;t=37s) (not the best quality) and you can check it out if you want. They are very nice cars, however not as cool as Tesla, but they are everywhere on the streets of Shanghai.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0vcjghfqb1h71.png?width=1150&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=74476d2bb5b6e73e407e842f45e02096c880b4ff\n\n $**ROKU** has pulled back so much from its upper resistance to the lower support of the support (180MA). It looks like an interesting point to get some short/mid term calls. Let's see if we can get a confirmation on the bounce tomorrow.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8q27o15wb1h71.png?width=1161&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0213cf6ba6c855f0bda887b86eb050671a0e6b07\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n $**SOXL** is pulling back the last few days, which is no surprise coming off of all time highs. The leveraged ETF provides great swing plays, and possible huge exposure in the form of LEAPS. I've still got an alert set on the 180MA, waiting for it to pull back further. September usually is a pretty good month for **SOXL.** \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/eg8metdyb1h71.png?width=1153&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=75d8e4739891b5e8a9277e27e43312db18a80899\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n $**MA** fell and I cut my position at a 6% loss today. I plan to re-enter at the support that it appears to be headed toward.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/raa2kzo1c1h71.png?width=1128&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6889343e3a1a826c077905398c295273fb04f5ea\n\n Last but not least, $**AMZN** is now on the 180MA. I still haven't gotten the LEAPS that I want. Considering the seasonality looks pretty bad in the upcoming months, I'm certainly in no rush. However, the offer is tempting.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mgo663a4c1h71.png?width=1146&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bba6f5b530645f89195c3a25c1f1a4310674d079\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n ^(Disclaimer: The comments opinions and analysis expressed herein are for informational and educational purpose only and should not be considered as individual advice or recommendations.)",

        "selftext": "Good evening everyone and thank you so much for taking a time out to read my post. I wanted to shine a little light on Gohealth symbol GOCO. They operate an online health marketplace. They are actually one of the leaders in this field. The growth online to do insurance has been extraordinary as seen with the company\u2019s growth. This past quarter sales were up 55% year over year. I have traded GOCO by the way around 10-11 in the past. I still believe the stock is worth 11-12 but at the moment the negative sentiment will over take everything. This market unlike no other wants instant gratification, so you have extreme movements up and down. Let us first look at some highlights from the report.\n\n\u00b7 Second quarter 2021 net revenue of $196.9 million increased 55% compared to the prior year period. YTD 2021 net revenue of $401.1 million increased 50% compared to the prior year period.\n\n\u00b7 Second quarter 2021 Medicare\u2014Internal revenue of $160.4 million increased 84% compared to the prior year period. YTD 2021 Medicare\u2014Internal revenue of $317.8 million increased 74% compared to the prior year period.\n\n\u00b7 Second quarter 2021 Medicare Advantage (\"MA\") Approved Submissions of 152,749 increased 58% compared to the prior year period. YTD 2021 MA Approved Submissions of 323,876 increased 52% compared to the prior year period.\n\n\u00b7 Second quarter 2021 MA LTV Per Approved Submission of $953 increased 5% compared to the prior year period. YTD 2021 MA LTV Per Approved Submission of $975 increased 11% compared to the prior year period.\n\n\u00b7 Second quarter 2021 net loss of $39.2 million compared to a net loss of $22.9 million in the prior year period; Adjusted EBITDA1 of $14.3 million decreased 47% compared to the prior year period due to the 2021 strategic investments in agent capacity, marketplace technology, branding and the Encompass Platform. YTD 2021 net loss was $46.4 million compared to a net loss of $23.8 million in the prior year period; Adjusted EBITDA1 of $46.4 million decreased 25% compared to the prior year period.\n\n\u00b7 The Company tightened its full year 2021 revenue outlook to $1,200 - $1,300 million (+37% to +48%) powered by commission net revenue of $1,000 - $1,100 million (+49% to +64%) as agent growth is tracking at the high end of expectations. The Company lowered its Adjusted EBITDA1 outlook to $300 - $330 million (+11% to +22%), primarily due to higher agent costs expected in 2021.\n\nNow, because of the losses and as the CEO has said most of this cost is going to be attributed to the cost of labor, as they have retained more staff and increased bonuses to retain customers, this indeed will be a strike on margins, however one must ask themselves since growth is there and there was a slight miss\n\nBottom line if this drop was warranted.\n\nAlso note the CEO who gets stock options/warrants for free, did not want to wait for options that may take 3-6 months to exercise he went into the market and bought 1.5 million worth of shares. 253,000 shares @ 4.68.. The initial reaction the next day could be expected. It ran to 5.41, I do not know how it fell back Friday. So you are aware the CEO is not a billionaire. He gets a 325,000 salary and with his bonuses and options he gets about 4 million per year. Clint has been at GOCO since 2001!\n\nAlso please note the form 4s, other insiders are buying since the drop, also around the same price. They are buying because they do not believe the stock can be bought cheaper than this, otherwise they would wait for options and warrants! The strongest conviction for me is when insiders buy. A company can announce a buyback, and that is fine and dandy, that is cash the company makes, but when 3-10 board members buy at the open market and use their own cash!!!??? I love it! \n\nI will also be the first to say that earnings report was not good, however it was slightly bad, wasn\u2019t absolutely atrocious. A 60% drop is as if the company is going out of business. So you have to ask yourself in 3 \u2013 6 months if the company keeps growing sales and they said they will have 1.2-1..3 billion in sales for the year, should drop this much? Please share thoughts and ideas..",

        "selftext": "I've have some issues trying to find information about the easiest way to backtest a strategy that uses variables such as P/E,  EV/OP, ROA, ROE etc... Every guide, video or article I have read trying to get information about backtesting has always ended up with them explaining how they do their \"MA 20 / MA 50\" backtesting.  \n\n\nI know value investing maybe isn't the best type of investing strategy that you can backtest since you can't just look on the earnings report and then know if the company will soar or not the upcoming decade, it's way more complex, I know...  \n\n\nBut I've been manually exercising my strategy out for 3 years now with great result on the swedish stock market, I've beat index each year. And the strategy narrows down the amount of suitable companies to just a 10-20 from around 800 in total and it is done only by using a screener and inputs of different variables that are obtainable from annual reports and the stock price. So I think it is doable to make somewhat of a reliable backtest on it, atleast it would be interesting for me to see the result since beating the index 3 years in a row is worth nothing more than just luck or coincidence.\n\nDo you know any good tools for backtesting strategies with inputs from annual reports and not the average TA that it feels like everybody is doing? Even if the tool doesn't support data from swedish markets I'd gladly try it on whatever stock market that is available.",

These risks stem from the whipsaw regulatory caprices of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). Well, now, here's some more of that same talk.\n\nChinese gaming stocks were in free fall after CCP state-run media (like most large companies, media in China is subject to state control) suddenly referred to gaming as \"spiritual opium,\" and then deleted the remark, letting shares regain some of their losses. Deleted or not, this pronouncement harbinges future CCP crackdown and intervention in names like Tencent, Bilibili, and XD. The CCP sparked similar fears recently vis-a-vis Chinese tech and internet names, as well as education names, see, e.g. [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/23/us-listed-china-education-stocks-plunge-as-beijing-regulators-crack-down.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/23/us-listed-china-education-stocks-plunge-as-beijing-regulators-crack-down.html) . The CCP has particularly targeted foreign listed companies for crackdown, especially those listed in the US. Again, the message could not be clearer: China has placed foreign--and, especially, US--investors in its crosshairs. The CCP is purposefully swinging its weight around to remind everyone who is in control in China; this is their overriding concern, to maintain control. It would not do to have Jack Ma, for example, stand up to Secretary General Xi the way, say, Mark Zuckerberg recently stood up to a certain orange-hued Tariff Man by banning him from FB. The CCP is about maintaining power and face: it is not about to let such a thing happen, even if it has to inflict a lot of pain on a lot of people.\n\nNow, there is nothing wrong with government deciding on and implementing policy to shape its society in a given way, and there is nothing wrong with government incentivizing the public to go along with it; that is indeed the nature and essence of government, and every government has the right to do this, including the CCP. We have heard they wish to curb monopoly power among the tech sector; to make education more broadly available to meet public demand by nationalizing those services; and now, it appears, they wish to curb the influence of gaming among the Chinese populace. All well and good.\n\nThe problem here, however, is that the CCP does not do this in a measured, deliberate, transparent, and predictable way; it instead acts whimsically and capriciously, without warning and without any attempt to gradually telegraph its plans to the investing public so that the market has time to react in a more measured fashion. This stands in stark contradistinction to the deliberative, telegraphed, and gradual process that marks US and European lawmaking and regulation, where statutes like the US' Administrative Procedures Act (APA) mandate public comment and interactive dialogue in regulated industries. The CCP's willingness to act in such a way is deliberate: the party moves swiftly and without warning not only to implement its goals as expeditiously as possible, but also to remind people--and especially foreign and US investors--who is in charge. Lack of reciprocity thoroughly characterizes the Chinese/Rest-of-the-World relationship, and this business with the gaming stocks today is one more example of that lack of reciprocity; other governments do not treat Chinese investors like China treats its foreign investors. It would not surprise me if the CCP turned around and ordered app stores to remove gaming apps within a week, just as was done with Didi.\n\nMany other r-slurs and I have reminded our fellows that the CCP could nullify the VIE contracts that allow Chinese companies to trade on US exchanges; they could pocket all your hard-earned money in a heartbeat, just as quickly as they've struck out at gaming industries today. Far be it from me to tell you where to put your money. But today's action vis-a-vis Tencent and other gaming companies presents another opportunity to repeat: be aware of the outsized regulatory and governmental risks imposed by the CCP if you are going to go long on juicy-looking Chinese stocks.\n\nVarious obligatory INB4s:\n\n\"Gosh, Romulus Augustus, China wouldn't shoot itself in the foot and injure its standing in the world by bilking foreign investors and taking all their money, leaving them high and dry.\" Recall what was done with the National Security Law in Hong Kong, in violation of a treaty the CCP signed (see one such recent arrest pursuant to that law: [https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/hong-kong-investigates-china-anthem-booing-during-olympics-broadcast-mall-2021-07-30/](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/hong-kong-investigates-china-anthem-booing-during-olympics-broadcast-mall-2021-07-30/)) . Recall also that the CCP signed the Paris Accords, and before the ink on their signature was even dry, turned immediately around and built a metric ass-ton (yes, that's a technical unit of measurement) of new coal plants: [https://e360.yale.edu/features/despite-pledges-to-cut-emissions-china-goes-on-a-coal-spree](https://e360.yale.edu/features/despite-pledges-to-cut-emissions-china-goes-on-a-coal-spree) . The CCP does not care overmuch for niceties or proprieties: they will think nothing of lulling you, and then taking your money and rugpulling you without compunction or hesitation if they deem the time is right.\n\n\"Gosh, Romulus Augustus, China is just getting several monopolistic and socially toxic industries under control, you should want the increased competition and improved Chinese society that will come from these measures.\" As I said before, all well and good. But do it in a measured, telegraphed, transparent, and predictable way: don't make a point of purposefully rugpulling and whipsawing foreign investors in a way other governments don't do with Chinese investors.\n\n\"Gosh, Romulus Augustus, isn't this just racist and anti-Chinese? Why are you so bigoted against Chinese people? #StopAsianHate. \" It\u2019s racist to point out that the CCP is bilking investors here of *all* ethnicities and creeds? I think not. Moreover, lobbing this accusation is a common wumao ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/50\\_Cent\\_Party)/tankie/](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/50_Cent_Party)/tankie/) r/ sino tactic often used on social media. They\u2019ve learned they can deflect from the CCP\u2019s misdeeds by crying that any criticism of the government or enterprise is racist. But like Eric Carmen and the Raspberries, let's go all the way! Assume I am indeed a racist (I\u2019m not). How does that factually alter, rebut, or contend with the substance of anything I\u2019ve said here?\n\n\"Gosh, Romulus Augustus, don't you wish the US government had taken some action against its bad apples like Enron, Theranos, Your Hometown Deli, Lordstown, et al.?\" Someone will inevitably bring up Enron like they always do when this topic comes up, and, like always, it will drive me absolutely nuts. Besides the fact Enron was decades ago, it spawned disclosure and accounting laws that American companies now must comply with. Elizabeth Holmes (and that affected husky voice I'm sure some of you degens around here have busted one out to) is facing down a court for the shit she pulled with Theranos. NKLA somehow still has a 4 billion market cap despite Trevor Milton's crazy lies and fraudulent statements for which he's now facing criminal charges. Again, the US takes action against its bad apples in a measured, orderly, transparent way when compared with the CCP.\n\nI can already hear xupamos87, BVB\\_TallMorty, and the China Apologist/China Bull Crew now: \"Gosh, Romulus Augustus, the Chinese stocks present a great opportunity, boast great fundamentals, and I've already realized sick gains on DOYU and NIO and a whole host of others!\" More power to you! I'm glad you made money off these names! But that's besides the point of this post and other posts on this topic. The overarching point is, the CCP imposes regulatory risks and rugpulls foreign investors in a way that other governments don't do to Chinese investors: the point of this and other similar posts is to describe this risk if you're going to try to make money off these names, and also to point out the lack of reciprocity between China and the rest of the world. And as for the stellar fundamentals, well, they are cheap for a reason.\n\n\"Gosh, Romulus Augustus, the CCP has made clear it wants to work more closely with US regulators like the SEC to clean up its act and become more transparent.\" OK. Words are great, but actions are better. At this point in time, it sounds like a strategic attempt to lull US investors into a sense of security before yet another rug gets pulled or more foreign money gets siphoned off. Remember how I said above that the CCP signed the Paris Accords and then turned around and built more coal plants? (See, e.g., [https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-50474824](https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-50474824) ). It strikes me the same is going on here with promises of greater transparency and cooperation with the SEC. China lulled the rest of the world into hamstringing itself to meet agreed-upon emissions targets while going full-steam (or coal) ahead on its own plans. Lull into a sense of security, then go back on your word in bad faith, and then pull ahead while others are struggling behind in an attempt to conform in good faith to the agreement and mutual commitments made.\n\n\"Gosh, Romulus Augustus, the US is so awful compared to China, how can you trash China and not recognize the US is evil, racist, and has done terrible things in the past?\" I hear this one a lot from younger-sounding Gen Z folks and tankies whenever the topic of China treating foreign investors poorly is brought up. I don't dispute the US bears its share of sin. But we are talking about problems today that are directly affecting all of us and our money. And China behaves less transparently and fairly towards foreign investors in its companies than the US behaves towards Chinese investors in US companies. That is the problem, and it is a problem that deserves addressing, regardless of what the US has or has not done.\n\nBottom Line: Be very, very aware of the outsized regulatory risks posed by the CCP that you will not face from the US or EU governments. Factor those risks accordingly into your personal risk tolerance matrix when going long Chinese stocks.",

        "selftext": "I am sitting here preforming my nightly Tendies analysis of different stocks and I believe I have found the perfect storm.  I am entering into a position tomorrow.  The due diligence below is my personal opinion and is by no means financial advice. \n\nT (Technical Analysis): The ticker has clearly broken above the EMA and the 50 day moving average. The MA appears to be curling pretty quickly in the upward direction, along with a close at the average last Friday and a clear bounce upwards yesterday.  I believe that if we can break above the 14.80-15.00 range that the stock will be quickly headed towards 25.20 (ATH), if that happens to break then there is a good chance this continues to go parabolic.   To cap it off, all of this has occurred with MUCH higher than average volume, signaling that this is most likely a legit break out. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nE (EV):  The EV space has been absolutely HOT recently.  Given the recent runs up for TSLA and the LCID IPO, there is a lot of attention in this sector for good reason.   With a very high barrier to entry in electric charging, MVST sits far ahead of its competition.  They are focused on fast charging, which is what is needed before the globe transitions to all electric vehicles.  In my opinion, it would be smart for Tesla to look into buying this company out to further their transition into a future energy business of the world.  Charging stations will replace all your local Shell gas stations in the future, mark my words. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nN (News): This one is pretty simple, the infrastructure bill  is expected to be passed any day now.  This bill may include up to 85 billion for the charging companies.  Putting this large number aside, it is a sign that further is to come in the future and that instead of credits towards cars specifically, there may be more money going towards the charging end.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nD (Downside): With pretty heavy support around $9 this represents a downside of approximately 30%.  However, with the electric industry bound to be over a trillion dollar industry (in my opinion), this represents a very high upside for both the short term and the long term.  If the stock does happen to reject at its all time highs, then this would still be a much better risk to return ratio.  Anyways, you really thing Microvast at a 4.1 billion dollar valuation is fair compared to Nikola who may potentially go bankrupt?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI (Innovation):  There is not much to say here.  Its fucking electric.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nE (Earnings): There is little word on earnings and I do not want to make any predictions that I cannot 100% confirm.  I know that there has been rumor about them releasing their earnings report very very soon and I bet this stock could run up on this rumor and into the eventual date.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nS (Short Interest): The most recent short interest report I have seen shows the short interest to be around 9%, but some have rumored for it to be much higher.  With more and more interest in the stock, it is bound that some better numbers will start to come out soon.  I don't think the institutions want these numbers out, because they know what we will do.  Even putting short squeeze potential aside, this is an ACTUAL company with tons of growth ahead.  Remember when NVDA had market caps of 50 billion?  EV is the next round of innovation to come.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDo with this info as you wish and do not make your decision based on me, I may be falling asleep as I write this.  I will see you all at market open.  Cheers and goodnight.",

        "selftext": "4th day in a row when sales out number buys by at least 4-3! And she held the critical support above $6.85! Even after the SPY and DOW dumped because pansy traders are scared of the fed minutes, she held! This girl right here is at a YTD low! And a possible double bottom from last week\u2019s low! Volume is low allowing shorts to manipulate price and have a greater affect! But that doesn\u2019t matter, because support held through dump after dump after dump! Sure it didn\u2019t take off today, but we know that any volume sky rockets this thing! \n\nAnalysts maintained the outperform, but lowered the PT to $16... wait... $16?!?! That\u2019s 2.5x the damn price!!! Who cares if the fed tapers?! This is a damn value company that\u2019s about to get fueled by a $3.5T infrastructure bill that allocated $30B into its EMERGING market! That\u2019s right! This is a pioneer in its space and will likely get awarded most of it! Not to mention the released signed deals that came out of the news yesterday! \n\nSo we have higher revenue, more growth, more earnings, more contracts, an infrastructure bill, and climate reports literally begging to find alternative fuels? And it\u2019s down 12% for 2021?  \n\nSimple institutional investors want lower prices to keep finding ways to get higher returns. So they short and they wait. But right now shorts have 3 days to cover, and she\u2019s oversold 4 sessions in a row, why more selling? Because if she doesn\u2019t break below $6.82 then this will be a double bottom and she will rise to cut above the moving averages which are consolidated and the short term MA will cross as well triggering a huge pump because algos are built by developers not traders. So a golden cross off a double bottom is extremely likely. So MMs and institutions that are short need this to stay down long enough for Friday and their options need to expire OOTM. \n\nYou might say, \u201cwell isnt institutional investment up on this?\u201d. Yeah on 16Aug there was an incredible amount of 13Fs filed but those were shares bought mostly. And many of them also bought puts to cover risk going down. So now we are 2 days from options expiring with an incredible amount of shorts, short calls, and OI on calls below $9. \n\nOnce the options expire MMs and institutional investors will let this baby run free because fed minutes and taper talk is incredible bullshit to give a reason why there needs to be a sell off. Because selling in order to manipulate the price to have your sold options expire OOTM sounds unethical? \n\nLong story short. This is about to pop, she just needs volume. Retail can\u2019t do it alone, that\u2019s why the shorts have to cover and options need to expire. Then watch this thing become a gem of a stock analyst will rave about in the emerging clean energy sector and it\u2019s extremely undervalued.... after they\u2019ve been manipulating it to get their friends a better entry. \n\nThank you for coming to my Ted talk.",

        "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, August 17, 2021**\n\nStocks fell firmly on Tuesday, with the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Dow Jones retreating from record levels yesterday amid a mixed batch of earnings results from major retailers and new economic data regarding retail sales. Looking ahead, market participants are waiting to hear from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, who is scheduled to speak later this week. Market participants will be waiting to see if there is any new information regarding a potential taper timeline. \n\nShares of Dow component Walmart (WMT) fell even after the big-box retailer posted second-quarter results that blew past estimates and raised its full-year guidance. Stimulus check spending, strong grocery demand and e-commerce sales helped push U.S. comparable sales excluding gas up by 5.5%, topping estimates but still slowing from last year's 9.9% surge. Home Depot (HD), meanwhile, missed on comparable sales for the second quarter, with these rising 4.5%, way below consensus estimates of a 5.5% increase. \n\nAccording to the Department of Commerce, for the month of July, retail sales in the US fell 1.1%, much higher than the drop of 0.3% expected and below the 0.7% increase in June, a sign that economic activity is slowing down, likely to the surge in the coronavirus delta variant and government stimulus drying up. Consumer spending makes up nearly 70% of US GDP, so market participants closely track these reports. \n\nChina released economic data for July that showed growth rates slow down dramatically as the world\u2019s second largest economy battles with summer flooding and the resurgence of coronavirus thanks to the highly contagious delta variant. Industrial production, a gauge of activity in the manufacturing, mining and utilities sectors, grew by 6.4% year-over-year in July, a sharp deceleration from the 8.3% rise in June and below the 7.9% growth expected. Retail sales, a key measurement of consumer sentiment in the world\u2019s most populous nation, grew by 8.5% in July, way below the 12.1% increase in June and missing the 11.5% expected by economists. \n\nThe National Bureau of Statistics noted \u201cthe impact of multiple factors including the growing external uncertainties and the domestic COVID-19 epidemic and flooding situation,\u201d according to a release. The bureau added that the \u201ceconomic recovery is still unstable and uneven.\u201d\n\nLooking ahead, market participants are set to receive the Federal Open Market Committee's July meeting minutes (which are basically notes of what was discussed) on Wednesday, offering more context around how much more amenable central bank officials have become to the notion of tapering their crisis-era asset purchases as the economic recovery takes place. As I have said in the past, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if there is more discussion about a potential timeline to begin tapering quantitative analysis, though I remain unconcerned. While the markets may react negatively, the real test will be in 2022 when discussions of raising the interest rates are brought to the table.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen doubled down on her support of President Joe Biden's plans increase investments in physical and human infrastructure in [an op-ed published on Yahoo Finance Tuesday.](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/infrastructure-bill-a-down-payment-on-the-economy-america-can-and-should-have-133058095.html) \n* Microsoft (MSFT) is investing in software startup Rubrik Inc. and the two companies will combine on products that will help customers hit by ransomware recover their critical data without paying hackers.\n* The Chinese government is at it again. In their latest move, CChinese tech companies lost roughly a combined $50 billion in market cap today after the government proposed a sweeping new rules on how companies collect and use user data. Alibaba (BABA) is now at the lowest price since late 2019.\n* The world's largest nonfinancial companies had a record $6.85 trillion in cash on their balance sheets as of the end of the second quarter, according to data from S&amp;P Global Ratings. (Banks and other financial firms are usually excluded from corporate cash lists because they are required to hold a lot of money in cash due to the nature of their daily business operations)\n* **\\*\\*Please note that current stock price was written premarket and does not reflect closing prices\\*\\***\n* Accenture (ACN) target raised by JP Morgan from $308 to $364 at Overweight.

        "selftext": " \n\nGood MORNING everyone and thank you so much for taking a time out to read my post. I wanted to shine a little light on Gohealth symbol GOCO. They operate an online health marketplace. They are actually one of the leaders in this field. The growth online to do insurance has been extraordinary as seen with the company\u2019s growth. This past quarter sales were up 55% year over year. I have traded GOCO by the way around 10-11 in the past. I still believe the stock is worth 11-12 but at the moment the negative sentiment will over take everything. This market unlike no other wants instant gratification, so you have extreme movements up and down. Let us first look at some highlights from the report.\n\n\u00b7 Second quarter 2021 net revenue of $196.9 million increased 55% compared to the prior year period. YTD 2021 net revenue of $401.1 million increased 50% compared to the prior year period.\n\n\u00b7 Second quarter 2021 Medicare\u2014Internal revenue of $160.4 million increased 84% compared to the prior year period. YTD 2021 Medicare\u2014Internal revenue of $317.8 million increased 74% compared to the prior year period.\n\n\u00b7 Second quarter 2021 Medicare Advantage (\"MA\") Approved Submissions of 152,749 increased 58% compared to the prior year period. YTD 2021 MA Approved Submissions of 323,876 increased 52% compared to the prior year period.\n\n\u00b7 Second quarter 2021 MA LTV Per Approved Submission of $953 increased 5% compared to the prior year period. YTD 2021 MA LTV Per Approved Submission of $975 increased 11% compared to the prior year period.\n\n\u00b7 Second quarter 2021 net loss of $39.2 million compared to a net loss of $22.9 million in the prior year period; Adjusted EBITDA1 of $14.3 million decreased 47% compared to the prior year period due to the 2021 strategic investments in agent capacity, marketplace technology, branding and the Encompass Platform. YTD 2021 net loss was $46.4 million compared to a net loss of $23.8 million in the prior year period; Adjusted EBITDA1 of $46.4 million decreased 25% compared to the prior year period.\n\n\u00b7 The Company tightened its full year 2021 revenue outlook to $1,200 - $1,300 million (+37% to +48%) powered by commission net revenue of $1,000 - $1,100 million (+49% to +64%) as agent growth is tracking at the high end of expectations. The Company lowered its Adjusted EBITDA1 outlook to $300 - $330 million (+11% to +22%), primarily due to higher agent costs expected in 2021.\n\nNow, because of the losses and as the CEO has said most of this cost is going to be attributed to the cost of labor, as they have retained more staff and increased bonuses to retain customers, this indeed will be a strike on margins, however one must ask themselves since growth is there and there was a slight miss\n\nBottom line if this drop was warranted.\n\nAlso note the CEO who gets stock options/warrants for free, did not want to wait for options that may take 3-6 months to exercise he went into the market and bought 1.5 million worth of shares. 253,000 shares @ 4.68.. The initial reaction the next day could be expected. It ran to 5.41, I do not know how it fell back Friday. So you are aware the CEO is not a billionaire. He gets a 325,000 salary and with his bonuses and options he gets about 4 million per year. Clint has been at GOCO since 2001!\n\nAlso please note the form 4s, other insiders are buying since the drop, also around the same price. They are buying because they do not believe the stock can be bought cheaper than this, otherwise they would wait for options and warrants! The strongest conviction for me is when insiders buy. A company can announce a buyback, and that is fine and dandy, that is cash the company makes, but when 3-10 board members buy at the open market and use their own cash!!!??? I love it!\n\nI will also be the first to say that earnings report was not good, however it was slightly bad, wasn\u2019t absolutely atrocious. A 60% drop is as if the company is going out of business. So you have to ask yourself in 3 \u2013 6 months if the company keeps growing sales and they said they will have 1.2-1..3 billion in sales for the year, should drop this much? Please share thoughts and ideas..",

        "selftext": "Hi All,\n\nI\u2019ve been trading on the stock market for around four months now. Most of that has been trading shares, but I\u2019ve gotten into options during the past month. I\u2019ve developed a strategy that has largely served me well, but I would love some advice/cautions/feedback.\n\nThe whole idea is to play off of rebounds of early morning drops.\n\nI\u2019ve compiled a list of around 50 companies, mostly well established (TGT, MA, MSFT, etc.), that I watch closely each morning. I watch to see which ones drop during the first ~2 hours of the day, especially drops that seem to happen for no reason. I wait for it to rebound slightly (compared to the drop), then I load up on ITM calls, which hopefully pick me up some cash. The following morning, if the stock is up sometime within 30 min of market open, I try to close the options, rinse, and repeat.\n\nFor example, look at MasterCard $MA from today (6/10). I waited for the morning drop to start to slow, before putting in a bunch of calls. I ended up buying slightly too early, but still managed to score towards the end of the day.\n\nI also watch for companies that do very well in earnings (ones that beat their estimations) but show sudden drops anyways. \n\nLastly, before dumping my money, I look at the chart over the past month. If it has been steadily increasing, or if it seems to be at a trough despite it being an established company, I feel more reassured.\n\nThis strategy has done me well so far, but I acknowledge that by putting all of my cash into calls I am taking some serious risk, which is largely why I make them ITM calls.\n\nLet me know any thoughts, or if y\u2019all have any feedback or questions, as I\u2019m still very new to this and hoping to improve!",

        "selftext": "I am looking for some advice from someone who may genuinely know what they are talking about.\n\nOne of my favourite stocks, EGLX, has recently seen an incredibly large amount of institutional purchasing. The stock was essentially wholly owned by retail last winter, but now like 70 institutions have taken a position following their Nasdaq uplisting.\n\n&gt;*Source:* [*https://fintel.io/so/ca/eglx*](https://fintel.io/so/ca/eglx)\n\nI have been considering this an extremely bullish signal. Especially since there is one whale position that I took particular note of.\n\nBoothbay Fund Management purchased 4.7% of the company's shares outstanding. While Boothbay is managing about $3B in assets, EGLX is actually now **their third largest position**, with only SPY puts and Mastercard calls options being ahead of it.\n\n&gt;*Source:* [*https://whalewisdom.com/filer/boothbay-fund-management-llc*](https://whalewisdom.com/filer/boothbay-fund-management-llc)\n\nI also recently noted, that a company's reporting requirements change once they own 5% or more of a company. Once they hit that threshold, they trigger the requirement to file a 13G or 13D forms that increase transparency. So this position standing at 4.7% does not seem like an coincidental quantity to me.\n\n&gt;Source: [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/schedule13g.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/schedule13g.asp)\n\nMy question is this, what are the chances that this huge whale is going to short EGLX or buy puts and then completely obliterate the price by dumping everything? That is illegal right?\n\nHas anyone ever seen such a scheme play out or am I being silly?\n\nIs a 4.7% ownership position by a major institution definitely a huge bull signal, or is it reason for concern?\n\nI can tell you with certainty that EGLX's trade volume is low enough that someone with this many shares could drive it down to damn near 0 if they wanted.\n\nAny wisdom folks can provide would be greatly appreciated.",

        "selftext": "**The Alibaba sexual assault scandal has provoked heated discussion in China.** \n\nIn an 8,000-word revelation post, the female employee in question described the incident in detail. It is roughly as follows:\n\nThe victim\u2019s superior, Wang Chengwen, asked her\u00a0to go on a business trip on a typhoon day and demanded her to drink wine with clients. During the process, she was molested by a\u00a0client. Later, Wang Chengwen entered her room four times after she was drunk and raped\u00a0her.\n\nWhen she woke up, she called the police immediately, but Wang Chengwen was released a day later for lack of evidence.\n\nOn the company\u2019s side, she wanted to resolve the matter through proper channels and minimize negative\u00a0impact on the company, but her appeals were treated indifferently. So she started to hand out flyers\u00a0in Alibaba\u2019s public cafeteria and turned to social media for help.\n\nNow\u00a0she has\u00a0proposed\u00a0two demands\u00a0to Alibaba after her experience attracted nationwide attention:\n\n1. According to the company's rules and regulations, dismiss the relevant persons in charge, and Alibaba company shall\u00a0never hire them;\n\n2. Give her\u00a0a long vacation to recover\u00a0physical and mental health.\n\nThe two demands are both consented to by Alibaba, according to its CEO Zhang Yong\u2019s announcement on August 9.\n\nMany Chinese netizens compared Alibaba\u2019s reaction this time with the 2016 \u201cMooncake\u201d\u00a0incident.\n\nIn 2016, 5 programmers of Alibaba took advantage of their jobs\u00a0and snapped up 133 boxes of special-priced mooncake on Taobao. 30 minutes later they were caught and two hours later were dismissed, reflecting Alibaba's super high efficiency. At that time, Alibaba\u00a0officials stated that it was\u00a0to maintain corporate culture.\n\nHowever, in 2021, the sexual assault incident\u00a0occurred on July 27, and Wang Chengwen was not dismissed\u00a0until August 8.\n\nComparing the two, netizens said that they could not accept Alibaba\u2019s different treatment. In Alibaba\u2019s culture, female employees are not as important\u00a0as mooncakes.\n\nNetizens commented: \"Any enterprise with normal values will never force female employees to drink with clients. Like male employees, they are workers. They are not \"escorts\", sexual resources, and certainly not the last dish served on the table.\u00a0\"\n\n**Alibaba needs to upgrade its corporate culture urgently**\n\nOn \"Ali Day\" every year, Alibaba\u00a0will organize a collective wedding. Jack Ma and Zhang Yong will personally send blessings and explain Alibaba's values in the most easy-to-understand terms. Every year when the New Year comes, Alibaba\u00a0will send an \"Ali Family Letter\" to all employees and customers, writing down the little progress and changes of the year, expressing gratitude and blessings one by one. From the outside, Alibaba pays more attention to the construction of corporate culture than other major companies. However, in the past year or two, Alibaba has encountered a series of problems linked to its values.\n\nIn April 2020, Jiang Fan, the former CEO of Taobao, was exposed to have an affair with the Internet celebrity Zhang Dayi,\u00a0and was also suspected of improper trading behavior. In the end, Jiang Fan was removed from Alibaba's partner status, downgraded, and canceled of all rewards. In June of the same year, an Alibaba\u00a0P8\u00a0level\u00a0employee was exposed\u00a0to harass\u00a0a job seeker under the pretence of recruiting a \u201cpersonal assistant\u201d, and\u00a0eventually got dismissed. \n\nToday\u2019s sexual assault scandal got the public to question again Alibaba\u2019s corporate culture and values. What's wrong with Alibaba?\n\nAlthough Alibaba\u00a0has always used various methods to convey its values, its values are still based on the previous sales culture.\u00a0Alibaba used to deal more with small merchants, and the best way to bond with merchants was to drink together. However, today, the post-90s and post-00s employees\u2019\u00a0mindset are more diverse, and Alibaba\u2019s cultures have lagged behind. \n\n**For the future**\n\nNetizens have reached an agreement: The perpetrator must be brought to justice, the responsible persons must be punished, and Alibaba\u00a0must give society a satisfying result.\n\nIn addition, netizens found that Alibaba did not respond to the incident until the tenth day. The public doubted that whether Alibaba had conducted public relations operations\u00a0to prevent the scandal from spreading out. Actually, since Jiang Fan\u2019s scandal, the government has made it clear that\u00a0capital must never \u00a0control\u00a0media\u00a0and manipulate public opinions. Let all tech giants take a lesson from this scandal and upgrade their cultures accordingly. After all, entrepreneurship is not easy. \u00a0",

        "selftext": "Recently, Bright Health Group landed on the New York Stock Exchange and made $924 million in its initial public offering. The IPO pricing values Bright Health at $11.23 billion, according to\u00a0[a report](https://www.reuters.com/legal/transactional/tiger-global-backed-bright-health-raises-924-mln-us-ipo-2021-06-24/)\u00a0from Reuters. The startup insurer initially priced its IPO at $18 per share, and issued 51.3 million shares. At present, Bright Health's stock price is $16.7 and the market value is $10.277 billion.\n\nFounded in 2015, Bright Health is a medical health insurance and technology company. Through cooperation with top suppliers in the medical system, it establishes connections between medical consumers and suppliers, and is committed to providing users with reasonable medical insurance solutions\u00a0and high-quality medical services through advanced technology.\n\nThe company raised $500 million in a late-stage funding round in September last year from investors such as Tiger Global Management, T. Rowe Price Associates and Blackstone Group Inc\u00a0[(BX.N)](https://www.reuters.com/companies/BX.N), bringing total equity raised to over $1.5 billion.\n\nIn 2020, Bright Health generated more than 1.2 billion U.S. dollars in revenue, an increase of more than three times compared with the 280 million U.S. dollars in 2019. The total revenue for the first quarter of 2021 was US$874.6 million. While revenue has increased, the company's losses have been expanding. From 2018 to 2020, the company lost 62.6 million U.S. dollars, 125.3 million U.S. dollars and 248.4 million U.S. dollars, respectively, and its net loss almost doubled.\n\n**Business Model: 2C+2B**\n\nBright Health runs two businesses, NeueHealth(2B)\u00a0and Bright HealthCare(2C). In particular, Bright HealthCare sells Medicare and commercial health insurance to about 623,000 consumers in\u00a014 states of\u00a0the United States. NeueHealth offers virtual and in-person clinical care to patients through affiliated primary care clinics.\n\n**Bright HealthCare: diverse strategies serve different groups of people**\n\nBright HealthCare offers health plans for individuals and families, small businesses and employees, and Medicare Advantage plans for seniors.\u00a0Five years ago, Bright Healthcare only offered a single product in one state, and the number of users was only 10,765. As of now, this department operates in 14 states across the United States, and plans to expand to more states by 2022.\n\nCurrently, Bright HealthCare provides health care benefits to approximately 623,000 consumers. Customers include: 1) Commercial customers. Bright HealthCare provides commercial health plans in 11 states, including personal and family plans and employer plans, serving approximately 515,000 people; 2) Medicare Advantage users. Bright HealthCare provides Medicare Advantage products in 11 states, serving approximately 108,000 people, usually focusing on high-risk groups with special needs.\n\nIn addition, Bright Healthcare operates a small Managed Medicaid business in California. Regarding self-funded employer support, Bright Healthcare is currently establishing ASO business (ASO, administrative services only) for self-paying employers through multiple strategic partners. Administrative services only (ASO) refers to an agreement that companies use when they fund their\u00a0[employee benefit plan](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/employer_sponsored_plan.asp)\u00a0but hire an outside vendor to administrate it. Bright Healthcare\u00a0believes that to continue expanding self-insurance market is\u00a0an important part of its diversification strategy. Bright HealthCare also participates in a number of specialized plans and is the nation\u2019s third largest provider of Chronic Condition Special Needs Plans (C-SNPs).\n\nFrom 2018 to 2020, Bright Healthcare\u2019s total premiums were US$127 million, US$272 million, and US$1.18 billion, with growth rates of 114.17% and 333.82%, respectively. The growth rate was tripled.\u00a0Its commercial insurance premium income was 111 million U.S. dollars, 236 million U.S. dollars, and 692 million U.S. dollars, with growth rates of 112.61% and 193.22%, respectively. Commercial premiums accounted for 87.64%, 86.77%, and 58.66% of total premiums, respectively, and their proportions dropped to about half in 2020. Medicare Advantage\u00a0premium income was 15.71 million U.S. dollars, 36.03 million U.S. dollars and 480 million U.S. dollars, with growth rates of 129.34% and 1232.42%, respectively. The growth rate in 2020 is particularly astonishing. MA premiums accounted for 12.36%, 13.23% and 41.34% of total premiums, respectively, and their proportions increased to nearly half in 2020.\n\nIn terms of users, the number of commercial users in 2020 was 145,000, and this number soared to 482,000 in the first quarter of 2021, an increase of 232.41%. The number of MA users was\u00a062,000, and reached 67,000\u00a0in the first quarter of 2021. Although Bright Health has achieved amazing growth in both premiums and the number of users, combined with its acquisitions, both the surge in users and the increase in premiums were driven by Bright Healthcare's acquisition of Brand New Day.  \n\n**NeueHealth: Healthcare services empower 2C business**\n\nNeueHealth is a comprehensive medical institution that provides local and personalized care services in a variety of ways. Its services include: \n\nIntegrated Care Delivery \u2014 Operating clinics that provide comprehensive care to all populations.\n\nBright Health Network \u2014Ecosystem of Care Partners.\n\nValue Services Organization \u2014 Empowering high-performing primary care practices and care delivery organizations to succeed in their evolution towards risk-bearing care delivery.\n\nIts income consists of two parts, namely service fees and premium income. Service fees\u00a0mainly refer to NeueHealth affiliated medical group\u2019s pay-for-service\u00a0income and\u00a0the network service income generated by Bright Health Network under NeueHealth; the premium income refers to NeueHealth\u2019s value service organization and its affiliated medical group\u2019s income from taking charge of patients\u2019\u00a0medical care.\n\nIn 2020, NeueHealth's service fee income was 29.35 million U.S. dollars, and premium income was 7.79 million U.S. dollars.\u00a0In the first quarter of 2021, service fee income increased by US$8.1 million year-on-year, reaching US$15.6 million, mainly due to the increase in revenue from the inter-company network contract service of the Bright HealthCare division. Premium income increased by US$26.7 million year-on-year, an increase of 1,330.8% to US$28.7 million. Similarly, the increase in revenue was driven by the acquisition of PMA.\n\nAs of April 2021, NeueHealth works with over 200,000 care provider partners and operates 28 managed and affiliated risk-bearing clinics within its integrated care delivery system. Through those risk-bearing clinics, NeueHealth maintains nearly 75,000 unique patient relationships as of April 2021, approximately\u00a030,000 of which are served through value-based arrangements, across multiple payors. In addition to the\u00a0directly managed and affiliated clinics, NeueHealth manages care for an additional 33 clinics through its Value Services Organization.\n\n**Competitive advantages: technology empowerment + extensive customer base + full chain**\n\nAfter summarizing Bright Health's business model, we found that the company's competitive advantages include: extensive customer base coverage, technological empowerment, and full-chain services.\n\nOn the customer side, Bright Healthcare offers plans covering all groups\u00a0of people. In particular, the currently developing Managed Medicaid business covers children and low-income groups; the personal and family plans in the business plan section cover self-employed and part-time groups; Medicare Advantage covers groups over 65 years old; and Employer ASO covers self-financing employer groups. At the same time, many of Bright Healthcare's professional programs target the chronically ill population.\u00a0In other words, regardless of customers\u2019\u00a0income, age, work or the way to obtain insurance, Bright Health can provide products or services in a direct or indirect manner.\n\nHowever, at present, Bright Healthcare\u2019s two largest customer groups are business plans and MA groups. Both in premium income and customer groups, business plans make up the most part. Products and services for other groups are still in their infancy, and the development of these product lines in the future will still require a lot of effort.\n\nIn technology, Bright Health\u00a0has developed\u00a0\u201cBright Health Intelligent Operating System\u201d or \u201cBiOS\u201d. It \u00a0refers to Bright Health\u2019s end-to-end intelligent technology platform comprised of consumer, care delivery, and administrative solutions, all designed to enable an integrated, aligned, and consumer-focused healthcare ecosystem.  \n\nBiOS uses the powerful data generated by Care Partner model to achieve integration of the healthcare system, including smart data center Consumer360 and the solution DocSquad for consumers and suppliers. \u201cConsumer360\u201d refers to Bright Health\u2019s proprietary intelligent data hub, which aggregates clinical and administrative data, as well as information derived from the consumer experience (i.e., from call center and other consumer interactions) and data relating to Social Determinants of Health. It could create a personalized digital care plan to empower DocSquad.  \n\n\n\u201cDocSquad\u201d refers to Bright Health\u2019s consumer and care provider solution, comprised of a purpose-built set of tools and experiences connecting consumers with the organizations responsible for their care, while giving providers a 360-degree view of a consumer to better manage their healthcare needs. Its services include virtual care, personalized care team, smart warning, and other healthcare services.\n\nAnother advantage of Bright Health is that\u00a0it both provides 2C and 2B services. On the one hand, it provides customers with Bright Healthcare\u00a0products, as well as customized and market-specific nursing services through NeueHealth's network and other healthcare providers. On the other hand, for business clients, NeueHealth helps healthcare providers gather consumers and provide care partners with multiple value propositions, while providing innovative tools and solutions to support population health management and development of value-based care. For payers, NeueHealth allows Bright HealthCare and other third-party payers to participate in value-based payment arrangements, while managing risk-bearing care delivery. It\u00a0provides payers with predictability of medical expenses, allowing them to focus more on benefit design and management.\n\nIn sum, Bright Health integrates financing and delivery of healthcare through the division and collaboration of the two departments, covering both payers\u00a0and suppliers. The payer\u2019s funding not only focuses on preventing losses, but also on creating overall consumer value and increasing access to medical care through effective resource allocation. Suppliers construct value-based arrangements that aim to reward the quality of care provided, rather than the number of services. It could\u00a0reduce the total cost of care and\u00a0improve\u00a0clinical outcomes.\n\n**Future challenges: loss doubles, and medical cost ratio increases**\n\nApart from\u00a0advantages, Bright Health is also facing some challenges. To achieve future development and even profitability, these challenges need to be overcome.\n\nFirst, the problem of customer groups. At present, the company's main customer base is divided into commercial\u00a0users and MA users. Commercial users\u2019,or personal insurance\u2019s\u00a0market share is relatively small, and the number of users in this market has grown rapidly after the enactment of Affordable Care Act. But in the later stage, the user group who cannot receive premium subsidies will have adverse selection.\u00a0The data shows that the total number of monthly registrations in the personal market increased from 10.6 million in 2013 to 17.4 million in 2015, reaching a peak, and then fell to 13.8 million in 2018. One reason is that from 2017 to 2018, insurance premiums rose sharply, and many people were unable to receive premium subsidies, so adverse selection occurred. Consistent with the number of users, operators that provide individual insurance plans have also seen a general trend of growth first and then decline, which also means that this market is very difficult for insurance companies.\n\nIn addition, there are many other participants in the personal insurance market, including Oscar Health, which went public not long ago. Although Bright Health claims to be able to compete with the former in terms of healthcare\u00a0networks, Oscar has 400,000 individual insurance members, just slightly less than that of Bright Health in personal insurance market.\n\nOn the other hand, the MA market is full of giants, and leading insurance companies occupy a large part of the market share, leaving Bright Health only a small part. Whether it is in personal\u00a0insurance or MA, customer acquisition\u00a0is quite\u00a0difficult, which is why Bright Health has adopted mergers and acquisitions to grow its customer base.\n\nAlthough Bright Health said it would expand to other customer groups, including self-funding\u00a0employer market and small business market, the development of these strategies is still in the early stages and has not been reflected in the company's financial data. In the future, much\u00a0resources must be invested, and even mergers and acquisitions and other means\u00a0will be necessary\u00a0to seize market share and customer base.\n\nIn addition, although Bright Health has both an insurance supply department and a medical service department, its medical cost ratio(MCR)\u00a0has been growing. From 2018 to 2020, the company's MCR\u00a0were 75.8%, 82.4% and 88.7%, which did not have any advantages compared with other companies. In other words, the company's efforts to control medical expenses through NeueHealth do not seem to have worked.\n\nThe company's operating costs have also been increasing. From 2018 to 2020, operating costs were US$95.83 million, US$180 million and US$410 million, respectively, with growth rates of 88% and 127%. With high medical expenses, coupled with increasing operating costs, the company still has a long way to go to achieve profitability.\n\nNevertheless, Bright Health is committed to controlling the entire value chain including users, payers and suppliers. This model is still a core competitiveness, which distinguishes it from competitors such as Oscar, and also reminds people\u00a0of United Health.\n\nWhat we can learn from Bright Health is its practice of complementing business through acquisitions. Bright Health turned NeueHealth into an independent department and constantly emphasizes the possibility of its future development. This differentiated department is built through continuous acquisitions. At present, 3% of the revenue contributed by this department is contributed by the acquisition department. Furthermore, the success of UnitedHealth Group is also on the basis of continuous acquisitions.\n\nAnother lesson\u00a0is the construction and integration of technology platforms. The intelligent\u00a0platform built by Bright Health integrates users, payers, and suppliers, and its solutions for suppliers or patients, such as applications, are based on this\u00a0platform. It aggregates\u00a0all user data and claims data to achieve transparent exchange and empowerment of data.\n\nBright Health\u2019s future is worth looking forward to.",

        "selftext": "I have been a poster/lurker on this forum for around a year and a half.  I have gained a lot of valuable knowledge and insight from reading posts and asking questions, so I figured I would give this a shot.\n\nI am posting this for my significant other since she doesn't have Reddit.  I am going to post her question verbatim but can respond to any further details needed.  Anything in parentheses is my  thoughts:\n\nI'm 34, live in Massachusetts, and am approximately 31 years away from retirement. I make $106k per year before benefits and taxes. I currently have two 401(k) accounts through former employers that I'm thinking of consolidating, and I'm wondering how to maximize the long-term growth of my money.\n\nThe oldest account is with Fidelity and contains approx. $25k. Throughout the year, I am docked various amounts due to items called \"Employee Deferral\" and \"Non-Safe Harbor Match.\" I can't figure out what these are or how the amounts are calculated. (I tried to figure this out myself but this is costing her a good deal of her gains, not to mention that the account has severely underperformed the market indices the last year.  They are $11-25 debits every two to three weeks.  I looked up safe harbor but I cannot figure out what it is in relation to her situation).\n\nThe next account is with ADP and contains approx. $72k. My former employer has alerted me that I need to move this money out of the account by October 10th or they'll put it into a money market account (that's been under-performing for ten years) for me. \n\nBased on my research, I know that I can roll my two 401(k) accounts into a Traditional or a Roth IRA. Living in MA, there's a possibility that I'll retire in NH. Since NH doesn't have an income tax, I'm wondering how my withdrawals would be affected for each IRA type. Specifically, with a traditional IRA, I'd typically pay taxes in retirement when I withdraw the money, but because NH doesn't tax income, does that mean I'd avoid taxes altogether? (I was recommending a Roth IRA but if this is true about NH I can't see how that wouldn't be a huge advantage.)\n\nI also learned through my research that I can only contribute up to $6k per year into an IRA. Because my two 401(k) accounts are way over that threshold, would I incur penalties? Or are rollovers exempt from that stipulation?\n\nAlso, are there other 401(k) rollover options besides the traditional and the Roth IRA that I should consider?   \n\n(I was recommending to her to roll one of the accounts into a Roth IRA with Fidelity and to throw the money into some of their mutual funds - nothing over a 0.6 expense ratio and maybe roll the other into a regular investment account and buy some safe individual stocks and ETFs).",

        "selftext": "  \n\nLook for a test of the 50-day MA before the close Friday. Yesterday the FOMC minutes revealed that members had discussed a reduction in asset purchases. Was this really a surprise?  The table was set for a drop. This morning the best scenario is an early bounce that tries to recover some of the losses overnight. If this happens I suggest looking for stocks that have breached major technical support overnight and that are substantially below that support. That is where sell stops will be triggered and those stocks are likely to see sustained downward pressure. Those key support levels are typically where traders sell out of the money bullish put spreads. Once that support is breached, traders will be forced to cover (buy back the put spreads). This will fuel the move lower in those stocks. If we get the early market bounce above SPY $436, wait for signs of market resistance and start buying bullish put spreads that are ATM and that expire tomorrow. I suggest not paying more than 35% of the difference in the strike prices. This will give you a chance to make twice as much as you are risking on the notion that we will see the 50-day MA tested on the SPY. This is how I am playing it today. The downside will be tested today. \n\nSupport is at SPY $433.30 and $436. Resistance is at $442. \n\n[Click here to ready my full market comments](http://www.1option.com)\n\nTrade well",

Then you should look at the biometrics company Fingerprint card which is traded on the Swedish market (mid cap Stockholm) At the moment, the hedge fund sylebra has increased its short-selling position to about 8%.

        "selftext": "4th day in a row when sales out number buys by at least 4-3! And she held the critical support above $6.85! Even after the SPY and DOW dumped because pansy traders are scared of the fed minutes, she held! This girl right here is at a YTD low! And a possible double bottom from last week\u2019s low! Volume is low allowing shorts to manipulate price and have a greater affect! But that doesn\u2019t matter, because support held through dump after dump after dump! Sure it didn\u2019t take off today, but we know that any volume sky rockets this thing! \n\nAnalysts maintained the outperform, but lowered the PT to $16... wait... $16?!?! That\u2019s 2.5x the damn price!!! Who cares if the fed tapers?! This is a damn value company that\u2019s about to get fueled by a $3.5T infrastructure bill that allocated $30B into its EMERGING market! That\u2019s right! This is a pioneer in its space and will likely get awarded most of it! Not to mention the released signed deals that came out of the news yesterday! \n\nSo we have higher revenue, more growth, more earnings, more contracts, an infrastructure bill, and climate reports literally begging to find alternative fuels? And it\u2019s down 12% for 2021?  \n\nSimple institutional investors want lower prices to keep finding ways to get higher returns. So they short and they wait. But right now shorts have 3 days to cover, and she\u2019s oversold 4 sessions in a row, why more selling? Because if she doesn\u2019t break below $6.82 then this will be a double bottom and she will rise to cut above the moving averages which are consolidated and the short term MA will cross as well triggering a huge pump because algos are built by developers not traders. So a golden cross off a double bottom is extremely likely. So MMs and institutions that are short need this to stay down long enough for Friday and their options need to expire OOTM. \n\nYou might say, \u201cwell isnt institutional investment up on this?\u201d. Yeah on 16Aug there was an incredible amount of 13Fs filed but those were shares bought mostly. And many of them also bought puts to cover risk going down. So now we are 2 days from options expiring with an incredible amount of shorts, short calls, and OI on calls below $9. \n\nOnce the options expire MMs and institutional investors will let this baby run free because fed minutes and taper talk is incredible bullshit to give a reason why there needs to be a sell off. Because selling in order to manipulate the price to have your sold options expire OOTM sounds unethical? \n\nLong story short. This is about to pop, she just needs volume. Retail can\u2019t do it alone, that\u2019s why the shorts have to cover and options need to expire. Then watch this thing become a gem of a stock analyst will rave about in the emerging clean energy sector and it\u2019s extremely undervalued.... after they\u2019ve been manipulating it to get their friends a better entry. \n\nThank you for coming to my Ted talk.",

        "selftext": " If I\u2019m reading correctly and with what we know up to this point. The Q2 earnings is gonna fuck up estimates. Their guidance and commentary estimates between 66K-70K MA membership by 12/31/21. Membership was approximately 66,300 as of 3/31/21 (a full 9 months before schedule). Their GAAP MCR reported was 107.6% (but that\u2019s taking into account COVID-19 costs; without which was only 95.4%). Their expenses was $104.6 million, but that was \u201cprimarily due to an increase in non-cash stock-based compensation to certain executives in relation to the merger\u201d with SPAC. Which won\u2019t be on Q2 financials. Their GAAP net loss was $(48.4M) but that was primarily due to the fact the SEC made them change warrants to a liability in their balance sheet, which since have been redeemed and will affect their bottom line significantly (won\u2019t be a liability any longer). Their EBITDA (earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortization) was ($76.2M) with COVID-19; without it would\u2019ve been only ($52.1M). Revenue generated by Direct Contacting estimated between $20-$30M depending on finalization of accounting \u201cwhich they expect to be completed by end of the second quarter.\u201d Reconciliation of Adjusted Operating Expenses (non-GAAP) to projected salaries and benefits is not provided because stock-based compensation cannot be reasonably calculated without unreasonable efforts (which won\u2019t matter for Q2 because they haven\u2019t further compensated executives and already have been accounted for as an expense in Q1). A reconciliation of projected normalized MCR (medical cost ratio, low number is better) to GAAP MCR cannot by calculated because of COVID-19. Which we did see a decrease in COVID-19 so those numbers can\u2019t be anywhere close to Q1. Th numbers are going to be awesome. Revenue will be higher than estimated ($205.39 Q2) because of estimated $20-30M due to direct contacting. And costs will be lower because Q1 included compensation to executives by way of non-cash stock-basis. They will show that even with COVID-19 costs, with their membership growth already at their estimates for the whole year, operating expenses what they really will be moving forward without the stock compensation, and warrant liability accounted for. This earning call is going to be HUGE! They\u2019re doing a live webcast on 8/11/21 at 5 pm EST on",

        "selftext": " **The Case For Turning Point Brands (TPB)**\n\n The owner of the U.S\u2019s most popular rolling papers (Zig-Zag) will see continued growth through cannabis legalization, new product offerings, and their strategic investments.\n\n Company Overview\n\n**Website**: https://www.turningpointbrands.com/\n\n**Price at publishing**: $47.22\n\n**Price Target**: $61.44\n\n**CEO**: Lawrence S. Wexler\n\n**Headquarters**: Louisville, KY\n\n**Founded**: 2004\n\n**Employees**: 408\n\nTurning Point Brands, Inc., together with its subsidiaries, manufactures, markets, and distributes branded consumer products. The company operates through three segments: Zig-Zag Products, Stoker\u2019s Products, and NewGen Products. The Zig-Zag Products segment markets and distributes rolling papers, tubes, finished cigars, make-your-own cigar wraps, and related products under the Zig-Zag brand. The Stoker\u2019s Products segment manufactures and markets moist snuff tobacco and loose-leaf chewing tobacco products under the Stoker\u2019s, Beech-Nut, and Trophy brands. The NewGen Products segment markets and distributes cannabidiol isolate, liquid vapor products, and other products without tobacco and/or nicotine to individual consumers through VaporFi B2C online platform, as well as non-traditional retail through VaporBeast. The company sells its products to wholesale distributors and retail merchants in the independent and chain convenience stores, tobacco outlets, food stores, mass merchandising, and drug stores. The company was formerly known as North Atlantic Holding Company, Inc. and changed its name to Turning Point Brands, Inc. in November 2015. Turning Point Brands, Inc. was incorporated in 2004 and is headquartered in Louisville, Kentucky. They run a very asset-light business resulting in low overhead and a minimum CapEx requirement as roughly 80% of their products are manufactured by third parties. TPB currently has a presence in over 210,000 retail outlets and several B2C online sites.\n\nI recall being an adolescent hooligan being dismissed from school and waiting for my friends in the warm, smelly summer air outside of LICHS of Queens, NY. I knew and they knew that when we were united there was something we had to do before partaking in our highly important evening activities, smoking some totally legal botanicals. Our first order of business to make that happen was going to the deli and buying some Zig-Zag rolling papers. Why Zig-Zags? I have no idea, they were just popular and had a cool-looking guy on the packaging. They burned well and tasted good\u2026I guess? I believe we eventually moved on to e-z widers because they were wider and in our feeble minds that meant we would get higher. Little did I know that almost 20 years later I would be writing an article about the company that is responsible for those papers and how upbeat I am about their future. If I had known that, I probably would have been very disappointed because I hated writing so much back then.\n\nWhile this company is mostly driven by their sales of Zig-Zag paper products to the tune of $165M in sales for the TTM (34% rolling paper market share), they are actually more than that and are continuing to add to their reach. Their Stoker\u2019s products sell chewing tobacco and moist snuff tobacco which are addictive and are both seeing strong growth (16% from 2019 to 2020). They also offer vapor products via their NewGen division which they are using to make an exciting push into the marijuana industry. Recent cannabinoid investments include Wild Hemp, dosist, Docklight, and [Old Pal](https://oldpal.amuse.com/), another cool company with a cool-looking dude as a logo. Although the NewGen products\u2019 operating margin is severely lagging behind the other two segments, there is a lot of upside potential once the ball gets rolling.\n\n### Financials\n\nTPB is profitable and has had steady growth in sales and EBITDA. Here's a segment breakdown of their revenue and the overall growth they\u2019ve had over the last four years.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[TPB Segment breakdown 2017-2020](https://preview.redd.it/knjm2biwrci71.jpg?width=1259&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=156a178c6ef1707f640218422f12958a30e1e560)\n\n \n\nOne of the best things about TPB\u2019s products is that they are non-cyclical, people smoke every season of every year. Even a pandemic proved to be beneficial to their sales as total net sales rose 12% from 2019 to 2020.\n\nSome of my own YoY growth comparisons I like to make:\n\n[Financial quarterly comparison](https://preview.redd.it/70626de0sci71.jpg?width=654&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4f170f27d2bb77a46ac2134350015363ee115d42)\n\nKeep in mind that 2020 was already a great year for TPB due to the rising interest in extracurricular activities brought on by the pandemic and still 2021 is comparatively strong with a 17% increase in revenue,\u00a0 50% increase in EBITDA, net income increases, and 145% increase in cash just to highlight a few. Yes, their debt increased \\~40% however, the company's equity still increased by 17%. They also have a high D/E of 4.83 but as long as they continue to produce cash flows this shouldn\u2019t be a problem especially since $418M of the $495M is long-term debt.\n\nGoing further back than just 2020 we can see below that TPB knows how to consistently grow revenue, almost doubling sales in just 5 years.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Revenue growth 2016-2020](https://preview.redd.it/5iksrrz4sci71.jpg?width=1163&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d7af6b2b194f40e73f2a8d32bff6765b5a24a8ec)\n\n \n\nSmooth and steady revenue growth since 2016, CAGR: 14.46%\n\nEBITDA has also grown consistently although at a slower pace than revenue with the CAGR: 9.38%\n\n### I Like The Stock\n\nTPB which is currently trading at $47.22 has a market cap of $894M. The stock is up 56% this year and is still 23% off their 52-week high of $60.94.\u00a0\n\nHere are some pricing comparisons against the sector median.\n\n[Price ratio comparisons](https://preview.redd.it/f1vva888sci71.jpg?width=655&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e647b6aa60b30317916390196cf66114f5792276)\n\n \n\n**Analyst Consensus**\n\nAccording to wsj.com, the average analyst price target is $64.60, roughly in line with my own estimate below.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img 89kdd96dsci71...*\n\n **Technical analysis** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img s5uudpvhsci71...*\n\nThe chart above shows the stock with a resistance along the 9-day exponential MA (yellow line) in August. At the time of writing there is strong upward pressure with the stock being up 6% today (yellow arrow). TPB has ripped past this resistance and I would look for that to continue.\n\n### Outlook\n\nThe million-dollar question everyone asks when potentially investing in a company is where will the growth come from? Well, there have been few cases where I was more convinced of a company's future growth than this one. I think the opportunity for growth will be there and more importantly, I think management is taking the right steps to capitalize on that opportunity.\n\n* Legalization\n\n&gt;Marijuana legalization will be the biggest driving force behind TPB\u2019s growth. While new and innovative ways to consume weed have been developed and will continue to be developed, I\u2019m not at all concerned about the demand for smoking a good ol\u2019 fashioned joint and of course, you\u2019ll need rolling papers for that. Being the iconic brand that it is, I expect Zig-Zag to hold their market share if not gain some as more people discovered their products during the pandemic. In addition to their traditional retailers, TPB is expanding into dispensaries, further improving their presence.  \nWith just 19 states having fully legalized cannabis, there is plenty more to go. If you are unsure of whether the growing cannabis market will impact TPB, take a look at this slide from their website\n\n[Legalization impact on TPB's sales](https://preview.redd.it/y1uv91tlsci71.jpg?width=1265&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b8a33bd2274530bdcd27401542d6374a608e4461)\n\nThe highlight is the 59% growth in their wraps business in states where recreational use is legal vs 24% growth in states where it\u2019s not and 23% in papers vs 19% in states without rec laws.\n\nThis is an example of one of their products aimed specifically at weed smokers. Pre rolled cones that only require to be filled and lit. These now compromise \\~20% of their papers business. This is great news for TPB as these cones sell for much higher than standard papers with better margins.\u00a0\n\n[Zig-Zag cones](https://preview.redd.it/tly5r9upsci71.jpg?width=600&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3fb7c3f980334c02b0f6aab824a6a8fcd874f2b8)\n\n \n\n\u201cZig-Zag paper cones are crafted from an ultra-thin paper to deliver a slow, even burn with zero hassle \u2013 just fill, pack and burn. Our crush-proof slide box fits easily in a pocket or purse, so you\u2019re always ready for a smoke break.\u201d\n\nHemp-wraps, another new product for those who would prefer to not use tobacco-based wraps to avoid nicotine and whatever other harmful chemicals come with it\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img kvkccw5tsci71...*\n\n&gt;\u201cZig Zag Hemp Wraps are the perfect go-to when seeking a refined and clean wrap for your legal blends. Each pack houses two 100% tobacco-free hemp wraps with included packing straws. Reseal your pack for later use and keep your wraps as fresh as the day you opened them with the resealable packaging! These smooth and slow-burning wraps deliver an exceptional draw and also come in a variety of flavors to fit your high-brow smoking style.\u201d\u00a0  \nIt\u2019s been a while but this actually makes me want to go see if Lawrence is still on the corner slinging dime bags.\n\n* Investments\n\n&gt;TPB have made some smart investments both to complement their current offerings and to enter new markets. One example is their acquisition of Unitabac\u2019s cigar/cigarillo assets for $9.6M. Analysts have estimated that this investment alone could bring in roughly $100M/year in sales, not too shabby for a $9.6M investment.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5ea0mm8wsci71.jpg?width=1265&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c6517aebe0a51b8e51de3d9cb602ff71d384cc49\n\n&gt;TPB is not just trying to capitalize on the marijuana legalization market via papers alone but also through strategic investments in existing marijuana brands such as Wild Hemp, dosist, Docklight, and Old Pal.  \nJust like I did many years ago, people will continue to buy Zig-Zags in some shape or form for years to come, the only difference will be the newcomers won\u2019t have to hide like I did.\n\n### Valuation\n\nI use a simplified discounted cash flow analysis based on Aswath Damodaran\u2019s teachings at NYU which uses assumptions about future cash flows to get a present value. Here are some of the assumptions I made about future cash flows. I used an average revenue growth rate of \\~8%, lower than historical values for the sake of being conservative and an 8% FCF margin in line with historical values. The weighted average cost of capital or discount rate I got was 3.4% using values on the balance sheet from their latest filings. For the terminal value, I again used a conservative continuous growth rate of 1.2%. The present value (market cap) I get from my analysis is **$1.28B** or **$61.44/share** which, compared to the current price represents an upside of 30%.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[TPB DCF analysis](https://preview.redd.it/sjekamrysci71.jpg?width=1416&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=128563cbae8c1118247bb1de823d34d7b58e206d)\n\n**Price Target**\n\nI have a price target of **$61.44** for Turning Point Brands\n\n**TL;DR:** Major growth to come for the company behind the famous Zig-Zag papers through marijuana legalization, strategic product offerings, and some great investments.\u00a0\n\n**My position**\n\nI have not initiated a position in any companies mentioned in this article however, I may purchase shares within the next 72 hours.\n\n**Disclaimer**\n\nThe contents on this site/article are for informational and entertainment purposes only and does not constitute financial, accounting, or legal advice.

I believe we eventually moved on to e-z widers because they were wider and in our feeble minds that meant we would get higher. Little did I know that almost 20 years later I would be writing an article about the company that is responsible for those papers and how upbeat I am about their future. If I had known that, I probably would have been very disappointed because I hated writing so much back then.\n\nWhile this company is mostly driven by their sales of Zig-Zag paper products to the tune of $165M in sales for the TTM (34% rolling paper market share), they are actually more than that and are continuing to add to their reach. Their Stoker\u2019s products sell chewing tobacco and moist snuff tobacco which are addictive and are both seeing strong growth (16% from 2019 to 2020). They also offer vapor products via their NewGen division which they are using to make an exciting push into the marijuana industry. Recent cannabinoid investments include Wild Hemp, dosist, Docklight, and Old Pal, another cool company with a cool-looking dude as a logo. Although the NewGen products\u2019 operating margin is severely lagging behind the other two segments, there is a lot of upside potential once the ball gets rolling.\n\n### Financials\n\nTPB is profitable and has had steady growth in sales and EBITDA. Here's a segment breakdown of their revenue and the overall growth they\u2019ve had over the last four years.\n\n  https://imgur.com/a0zOjn9 \n\nOne of the best things about TPB\u2019s products is that they are non-cyclical, people smoke every season of every year. Even a pandemic proved to be beneficial to their sales as total net sales rose 12% from 2019 to 2020.\n\nSome of my own YoY growth comparisons I like to make:\n\n https://imgur.com/UdUDfsA \n\nKeep in mind that 2020 was already a great year for TPB due to the rising interest in extracurricular activities brought on by the pandemic and still 2021 is comparatively strong with a 17% increase in revenue,\u00a0 50% increase in EBITDA, net income increases, and 145% increase in cash just to highlight a few. Yes, their debt increased \\~40% however, the company's equity still increased by 17%. They also have a high D/E of 4.83 but as long as they continue to produce cash flows this shouldn\u2019t be a problem especially since $418M of the $495M is long-term debt.\n\nGoing further back than just 2020 we can see below that TPB knows how to consistently grow revenue, almost doubling sales in just 5 years.\n\n https://imgur.com/bELjVBI \n\nSmooth and steady revenue growth since 2016, CAGR: 14.46%\n\n https://imgur.com/2ahtxNf \n\nEBITDA has also grown consistently although at a slower pace than revenue with the CAGR: 9.38%\n\n### I Like The Stock\n\nTPB which is currently trading at $47.22 has a market cap of $894M. The stock is up 56% this year and is still 23% off their 52-week high of $60.94.\u00a0\n\nHere are some pricing comparisons against the sector median.\n\n  https://imgur.com/lRNg5oj \n\n**Analyst Consensus**\n\nAccording to The WSJ, the average analyst price target is $64.60, roughly in line with my own estimate below.\n\n https://imgur.com/SUUuY73 \n\n **Technical Analysis** \n\n https://imgur.com/wYeVVGs \n\nThe chart above shows the stock with a resistance along the 9-day exponential MA (yellow line) in August. At the time of writing there is strong upward pressure with the stock being up 6% today (yellow arrow). TPB has ripped past this resistance and I would look for that to continue.\n\n### Outlook\n\nThe million-dollar question everyone asks when potentially investing in a company is where will the growth come from? Well, there have been few cases where I was more convinced of a company's future growth than this one. I think the opportunity for growth will be there and more importantly, I think management is taking the right steps to capitalize on that opportunity.\n\n* Legalization\n\n&gt;Marijuana legalization will be the biggest driving force behind TPB\u2019s growth. While new and innovative ways to consume weed have been developed and will continue to be developed, I\u2019m not at all concerned about the demand for smoking a good ol\u2019 fashioned joint and of course, you\u2019ll need rolling papers for that. Being the iconic brand that it is, I expect Zig-Zag to hold their market share if not gain some as more people discovered their products during the pandemic. In addition to their traditional retailers, TPB is expanding into dispensaries, further improving their presence.  \nWith just 19 states having fully legalized cannabis, there is plenty more to go. If you are unsure of whether the growing cannabis market will impact TPB, take a look at this slide from their website\n\n  https://imgur.com/8xRODKf \n\nThe highlight is the 59% growth in their wraps business in states where recreational use is legal vs 24% growth in states where it\u2019s not and 23% in papers vs 19% in states without rec laws.\n\nThis is an example of one of their products aimed specifically at weed smokers. Pre rolled cones that only require to be filled and lit. These now compromise \\~20% of their papers business. This is great news for TPB as these cones sell for much higher than standard papers with better margins.\u00a0\n\n https://imgur.com/emNvtzr  \n\n\u201cZig-Zag paper cones are crafted from an ultra-thin paper to deliver a slow, even burn with zero hassle \u2013 just fill, pack and burn. Our crush-proof slide box fits easily in a pocket or purse, so you\u2019re always ready for a smoke break.\u201d\n\nHemp-wraps, another new product for those who would prefer to not use tobacco-based wraps to avoid nicotine and whatever other harmful chemicals come with it\n\n https://imgur.com/Rev8j2f \n\n \n\n&gt;\u201cZig Zag Hemp Wraps are the perfect go-to when seeking a refined and clean wrap for your legal blends. Each pack houses two 100% tobacco-free hemp wraps with included packing straws. Reseal your pack for later use and keep your wraps as fresh as the day you opened them with the resealable packaging! These smooth and slow-burning wraps deliver an exceptional draw and also come in a variety of flavors to fit your high-brow smoking style.\u201d\u00a0  \nIt\u2019s been a while but this actually makes me want to go see if Lawrence is still on the corner slinging dime bags.\n\n* Investments\n\n&gt;TPB have made some smart investments both to complement their current offerings and to enter new markets. One example is their acquisition of Unitabac\u2019s cigar/cigarillo assets for $9.6M. Analysts have estimated that this investment alone could bring in roughly $100M/year in sales, not too shabby for a $9.6M investment.\n\n  https://imgur.com/S4yzRuU \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;TPB is not just trying to capitalize on the marijuana legalization market via papers alone but also through strategic investments in existing marijuana brands such as Wild Hemp, dosist, Docklight, and Old Pal.  \nJust like I did many years ago, people will continue to buy Zig-Zags in some shape or form for years to come, the only difference will be the newcomers won\u2019t have to hide like I did.\n\n### Valuation\n\nI use a simplified discounted cash flow analysis based on Aswath Damodaran\u2019s teachings at NYU which uses assumptions about future cash flows to get a present value. Here are some of the assumptions I made about future cash flows. I used an average revenue growth rate of \\~8%, lower than historical values for the sake of being conservative and an 8% FCF margin in line with historical values. The weighted average cost of capital or discount rate I got was 3.4% using values on the balance sheet from their latest filings. For the terminal value, I again used a conservative continuous growth rate of 1.2%. The present value (market cap) I get from my analysis is **$1.28B** or **$61.44/share** which, compared to the current price represents an upside of 30%.\n\n https://imgur.com/B6ho8h6  \n\n**Price Target**\n\nI have a price target of **$61.44** for Turning Point Brands\n\n**TL;DR:** Major growth to come for the company behind the famous Zig-Zag papers through marijuana legalization, strategic product offerings, and some great investments.\u00a0\n\n**My position**\n\nI have not initiated a position in any companies mentioned in this article however, I may purchase shares within the next 72 hours.\n\n**Disclaimer**\n\nThe contents on this site/article are for informational and entertainment purposes only and does not constitute financial, accounting, or legal advice.

        "selftext": " \n\nGood morning and thank you so much for taking a time out to read my post. I wanted to shine a little light on Gohealth symbol GOCO. They operate an online health marketplace. They are actually one of the leaders in this field. The growth online to do insurance has been extraordinary as seen with the company\u2019s growth. This past quarter sales were up 55% year over year. I have traded GOCO by the way around 10-11 in the past. I still believe the stock is worth 11-12 but at the moment the negative sentiment will over take everything. This market unlike no other wants instant gratification, so you have extreme movements up and down. Let us first look at some highlights from the report.\n\n\u00b7 Second quarter 2021 net revenue of $196.9 million increased 55% compared to the prior year period. YTD 2021 net revenue of $401.1 million increased 50% compared to the prior year period.\n\n\u00b7 Second quarter 2021 Medicare\u2014Internal revenue of $160.4 million increased 84% compared to the prior year period. YTD 2021 Medicare\u2014Internal revenue of $317.8 million increased 74% compared to the prior year period.\n\n\u00b7 Second quarter 2021 Medicare Advantage (\"MA\") Approved Submissions of 152,749 increased 58% compared to the prior year period. YTD 2021 MA Approved Submissions of 323,876 increased 52% compared to the prior year period.\n\n\u00b7 Second quarter 2021 MA LTV Per Approved Submission of $953 increased 5% compared to the prior year period. YTD 2021 MA LTV Per Approved Submission of $975 increased 11% compared to the prior year period.\n\n\u00b7 Second quarter 2021 net loss of $39.2 million compared to a net loss of $22.9 million in the prior year period; Adjusted EBITDA1 of $14.3 million decreased 47% compared to the prior year period due to the 2021 strategic investments in agent capacity, marketplace technology, branding and the Encompass Platform. YTD 2021 net loss was $46.4 million compared to a net loss of $23.8 million in the prior year period; Adjusted EBITDA1 of $46.4 million decreased 25% compared to the prior year period.\n\n\u00b7 The Company tightened its full year 2021 revenue outlook to $1,200 - $1,300 million (+37% to +48%) powered by commission net revenue of $1,000 - $1,100 million (+49% to +64%) as agent growth is tracking at the high end of expectations. The Company lowered its Adjusted EBITDA1 outlook to $300 - $330 million (+11% to +22%), primarily due to higher agent costs expected in 2021.\n\nNow, because of the losses and as the CEO has said most of this cost is going to be attributed to the cost of labor, as they have retained more staff and increased bonuses to retain customers, this indeed will be a strike on margins, however one must ask themselves since growth is there and there was a slight miss\n\nBottom line if this drop was warranted.\n\nAlso note the CEO who gets stock options/warrants for free, did not want to wait for options that may take 3-6 months to exercise he went into the market and bought 1.5 million worth of shares. 253,000 shares @ 4.68.. The initial reaction the next day could be expected. It ran to 5.41, I do not know how it fell back Friday. So you are aware the CEO is not a billionaire. He gets a 325,000 salary and with his bonuses and options he gets about 4 million per year. Clint has been at GOCO since 2001!\n\nAlso please note the form 4s, other insiders are buying since the drop, also around the same price. They are buying because they do not believe the stock can be bought cheaper than this, otherwise they would wait for options and warrants! The strongest conviction for me is when insiders buy. A company can announce a buyback, and that is fine and dandy, that is cash the company makes, but when 3-10 board members buy at the open market and use their own cash!!!??? I love it!\n\nI will also be the first to say that earnings report was not good, however it was slightly bad, wasn\u2019t absolutely atrocious. A 60% drop is as if the company is going out of business. So you have to ask yourself in 3 \u2013 6 months if the company keeps growing sales and they said they will have 1.2-1..3 billion in sales for the year, should drop this much? Please share thoughts and ideas..",

        "selftext": "This is a textcopy of the extreme bullish article written by Bashar Issa , 15 august 2021\nLFG \ud83c\udf40\ud83c\udf40\ud83c\udf40\nClover Shorts Will Likely Burn - Valuation Revisited\n\n\nThe Hindenburg Research report overstates the implications of the DOJ's inquiry, which hasn't transformed to a legal probe or subpoena since its start at least one and a half years ago.\nPent-up demand for healthcare services due to COVID lockdowns is temporarily increasing policy utilization, increasing CLOV's medical costs.\nMCR will likely return to normal levels as this backlog loosens.\nWe are upgrading our rating from Neutral to Outperform given the unexpected increase in revenue, bringing the Company's valuation multiples closer to peers' average.\nCaretaker assisting senior man with walker\nFG Trade/E+ via Getty Images\nInvestment Thesis\n\nClover Health's (NASDAQ:CLOV) short positions, which constitute 23% of outstanding shares, sit on shaky ground, given the Company's high growth and strong financial position. Revenue grew 140% in Q2 2021, while the number of beneficiaries grew more than 126% in the same period.\n\nWith the recent unexpected growth in revenue, CLOV's valuation multiples are closer to industry peers, encouraging us to upgrade its rating from Neutral to Outperform. At the current revenue run rate ($1.6 billion-$1.7 billion), the Company only needs to increase its sales by 130% to match its peers' E.V./Sales multiples. This target is achievable, given the expanding market and CLOV's small market share. We also believe that weakly-founded short positions create an opportunity for extraordinary returns, as mutual funds following the Hindenburg Research realize they are at the wrong side of the trade.\n\nToo much Pessimism - CLOV's Short Interest\n\nAt the time of this writing, CLOV's short interest stands at 23% of total shares outstanding, mirroring a pessimistic sentiment, possibly stemming from a scathing Hindenburg Research published by the short-selling investment firm earlier in February. The report cites several issues that we believe are blown out of proportion.\n\nThe main issue relates to CLOV's failure to disclose a DOJ's \"active investigation\" around its marketing practices, kickbacks, and undisclosed third-party transactions. Before highlighting these issues, one should note that the insurance industry is plagued by fraud, misconduct, and abuse of CMS rules. For example, data from Violation Tracker show that Humana (NYSE:HUM) has made 72 violations since 2000, costing shareholders $47 million in penalties. UnitedHealth (NYSE:UNH) has 316 records with total penalties summing to $610 million. We believe that the high number of violations causes the bad publicity currently lining the health payers' industry, stimulating regular audits and inspections by the CMS, Inspectors General Office, and the DOJ. The DOJ's request for information about the Company's practices doesn't constitute a Subpoena or a Civil Investigation. Instead, it is an inquiry that falls within the normal course of business. Below are excerpts from industry peers pointing to the regular inspections and regulatory inquiries within the industry.\n\nAuthorities regularly scrutinize the business practices of health insurance, health care delivery and benefits companies - Humana\n\nBecause of the nature of its businesses, the Company is frequently made party to a variety of legal actions and regulatory inquiries - UnitedHealth\n\n[..] These investigations, audits, reviews and administrative proceedings include routine and special inquiries by state insurance departments, state attorneys general, the US Attorney General and subcommittees of the US Congress - Anthem (ANTM)\n\nFor this reason, we believe that the DOJ's information request doesn't constitute a solid foundation for a short position. It is worth noting that the \"active investigation\" is old news, at least one and a half years ago. If the DOJ had an intention to pursue the issue further, it would have done that by now. The Hindenburg report stimulated an SEC investigation, which also hasn't developed into a Civil Investigation or instigated a subpoena, seven months after the SEC's information request. For this reason, we believe that the \"Existential Risk\" mentioned in the Hindenburg report is an overstatement.\n\nThe Obvious Choice - Clover's Business Model\n\nMedicare Advantage is a government program allowing insurers to provide coverage on behalf of the government. The industry is heavily regulated, with the CMS mandating that participants offer at least the actuarily equivalent of its original/federal Part A and Part B Plans. CLOV can exceed this target, providing what it calls \"the obvious choice\" in terms of affordability and service due to its contracts with its healthcare provider network. While Original Medicare offers national coverage across almost all hospitals and healthcare providers nationwide, CLOV has a limited network of hospitals that it contracts for its beneficiaries at a lower price. This allows the Company to pass these cost savings to its beneficiaries in lower co-pays and Part D premiums. The figure below shows that almost two-thirds of MA enrollees don't pay a premium for Prescription Drug Plan.\n\nPrescription Drug Plan\n\nSource: www.kff.org\n\nCLOV shares this business model with the remainder of the industry. Today, 50% of people registering for Medicare choose a Medicare Advantage plan.\n\nA complicated model determines CLOV's premiums and rebates by incorporating variables such as service quality (measured by a star rating), risk factors (measured by patient's medical history and individual characteristics), and a base rate set by the Health Secretary's Office. Generally, the algorithm allows insurers to maximize revenue by lowering costs and increase service quality. This is the reason CLOV (and other insurers) touts its software capabilities, given that optimizing costs is paramount to its business models.\n\nExpanding Market - Revenue Trends\n\nThe Medicare Advantage, \"MA,\" market is proliferating, with 13,000 individuals becoming eligible for the program every day. The percentage of beneficiaries choosing MA is also on the rise, driven by the valued-add third-party insurers bring to the market. Politically, Washington wants the program to succeed, given the risk/reward shift it brings away from CMS to the private sector.\n\nTotal Medicare Advantage Enrollment \n\nSource: www.kff.org\n\nCLOV's MA beneficiaries grew 18% in Q2 2021, from 56,815 to 66,566 members. Moreover, the Company entered the Direct Contracting market, increasing the lives covered by approximately 100%. As of June 30, the total number of beneficiaries stood at 126,591 individuals for both the MA and Direct Contracting segments.\n\nRevenue increased 140%, driven mainly by the Direct Contracting business. Although the CMS closed the door for new applicants, existing members such as CLOV can continue receiving premiums and rebates beyond the 2021 year-end, providing revenue stability within the segment and supporting our growth thesis.\n\nSufficient Liquidity - Financial Position\n\nCLOV's 126,591 beneficiaries generate $1.6 billion run rate annual revenue according to management estimates. This is worth something, even though CLOV is currently unprofitable. In worst cases, if the Company fails to monetize its customer base, it can seek a strategic alternative, e.g., an acquirer with a lower cost base than CLOV.\n\nHowever, the base case scenario is that the Company will find its footing in terms of costs; Medical Cost Ratio, \"MCR,\" has been disrupted in recent quarters by pent-up demand due to COVID. Beneficiaries who postponed physician visits during lockdown are now highly utilizing their policies in the form of hospital and physician visits, pushing MCR above premiums. MCR in the last three quarters was 111%, 108%, and 109%, compared to an extraordinary low utilization in Q2 and Q3 2020 when MCR dropped to 70% and 87%, respectively. We believe that MCR will return to normal rates as the backlog loosens.\n\nIn any case, CLOV's financial position buys it time to adjust its operations and optimize profitability. As of June 30, cash and cash equivalents stood at $600 million compared to an operating cash burn of $64 million during the quarter. The Company can adjust its plan prices and coverage annually. Given the stickiness of beneficiaries, it can do this with low customer attrition, needless to say, within reason, given the competitive market and the regulatory limitations.\n\nGrowth Changes Everything - Valuation Revisited\n\nThe Medicare Advantage market is highly concentrated among a few prominent players. However, an expanding market and low barriers to entry allow CLOV to find its footing in the market. At current price levels, the Company is undervalued in light of its growth rate and revenue base. The average industry EV/Forward Sales is 0.7x. This means that for CLOV to reach a similar valuation, it needs to increase its sales to $3.9 billion. TTM annual sales are $900 million; however, its revenue run rate is $1.6 billion and Q2 revenue is $412 million, translating to $1.6 billion in annualized sales. This means that for the Company to reach its peers' valuation, it only needs to increase its revenue by 130%, which is reasonably achievable, given its small market share, low revenue base and expanding market.\n\nClover Health vs. Peers EV to Revenues\n\nData by YCharts\n\nSummary\n\nThe Hindenburg Research report blows CLOV's troubles out of proportion. The insurance industry is plagued with bad publicity due to repeated violations from long-standing peers, pushing the DOJ, Inspector's General Office, and the CMS to conduct regular inquiries and audits, which don't constitute a Subpoena or a Civil Investigation. It's been seven months since the SEC initiated an investigation into these issues and at least one and a half years since the DOJ's probe. If any of these entities wanted to pursue these issues, they would have done it by now. The fear and pessimism over CLOV are overstated, opening an opportunity for extraordinary returns as the Company continues to grow its revenue base and most likely its net income.\n\nPent-up demand from COVID is causing high policy utilization, as people are finally making the physician visits postponed during the lockdown. This is increasing the Company's costs relative to premium revenue. We believe that going forward, the rate of utilization and medical care ratio, \"MCR,\" will normalize as the backlog loosens.\n\nWe are upgrading our rating from Neutral to Outperform given the unexpected increase in revenue, bringing the Company's valuation multiples closer to peers' average.\n\nThis article was written by\n\nBashar Issa",

Who knows how many common they or their agents have bought at pennies per share? \r  \n\r  \nThe last 6 days over 2M shares traded on $NOVC of which 52% was shorted www.otcshortreport.com/company/NOVC on no news, no Q, Going Concern in 10K created by concealing the fact same investors www.Fortress.com and EJFcap.com own both the NOVC common and NOVC only Sr Debt, hidden by them behind CDOs they paid very little to own via CDO Service Rights; Fortress owns 2.3rd of NOVC only Sr Debt/31.3M common via Taberna CDOs I and II Fortress bought from #MILE Board Member Betsy Cohen RAIT Financial https://www.inquirer.com/philly/business/homepage/20100422\\_RAIT\\_sells\\_Taberna\\_CDOs\\_for\\_\\_16\\_5M.html Who would short a penny stock?\r  \nThey can copy their restructurings at Dynex Capital DX and Newcastle $NCT Fortress split into 3 tax exempt MREITs $NRZ, $SNR, $NEWM aka $GCI before changing Newcastle name to www.driveshack.com $DS. \r  \n\r  \nI have reason to believe they will duplicate or cut and paste these restructuring blueprints at Novation Companies, Inc. $NOVC by separating NOVC ex MREIT Novastar Financial Inc that holds rights to rich, seasoned collateral assets to most of $3 Billion portfolio of RMBS, Non-QM collateral assets that can be leveraged 15:1 say 10:1 into 30 B portfolio x NIM of 500 Bpts say 400 Bpts that is $1.2B NIM less some SGA, Other Ex and you have annual dividend est at 3-6.00 (DX pays .13 ct MONTHLY dividend .39 cts per Qtr, NRZ in 2019 paid common 2.00 annual or 50 cts qtrly dividend). At 10% yield that is as much as 60 stock you can buy today for much less and this does not include like $DS another tax free company operating with 730M NOL www.healthcare-staffing.com. NOVC provides no transparency because by failing to be transparent and misleading Mr. Market they drive share price to pennies while they award the Board 18M RSU and give Note Holders hidden behind CDOs 31.3M common at less than ONE CENT. https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2019/08/09/1900133/0/en/novation-companies-inc-executes-first-amendment-to-senior-secured-note-purchase-agreement.html \r  \nCDOs owned by Fortress/EJF Capital are would be worth almost $2B (31M shares x 60/share) and they still collect dividends and another lucrative management fee like NRZ per 10K at NRZ paid Fortress in 2019 alone $170M two part management fee. They still hold like DS HCS owned by NOVC www.healthcare-staffing.com \r  \nWhere is ex MassMutual Employee aka #RoaringKitty aka Keith Gill American financial analyst Keith Patrick Gill is an American financial analyst and investor known for his posts on the subreddit r/wallstreetbets.

Its really simple and essentially says to wait for the stock to gain momentum and reverse upwards to the 20MA, use the 20MA as a buy signal, and then use 50MA as a sell signal. \n\nHe goes more in depth about it in this video below:\n\n[https://youtu.be/AZX2voRaD9w](https://youtu.be/AZX2voRaD9w)",
